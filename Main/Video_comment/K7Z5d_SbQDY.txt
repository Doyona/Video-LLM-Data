dm me on ig , ill respond : @roblopez
dude come back and do it again.
We need an updated commercial cuz these got updated
“The case could never is wild”💀
And you Rob, still buy Apple products!🤣🤣🤣
And still, when I'm at the gym, every second idiot or Apple fangirl is wearing them, probably because they're very comfortable for running and sweating. 😂😂
crazy how they're still the same price 4 years later
3:43 I’M DEAD 😭😭😭
If you don’t like something why talk about it!!! As people we waste so so so much time hating on things we don’t like or aspire to own or have in our lives….we constantly lose sight of what we love and want close to us!!! I personally love the APM!!
in 2025, the link in the description takes u to a website that a fake virus, don't panic and move your mouse pointer to the top and X out. If you have antivirus software and run a scan, it will say no virus found, so don't worry and don't click the link.
😂 lol moral if the Apple product story is, if you own the never-ending iphone  series and or any of its product you are supposed to be considered rich...😂 There are other smart phones of different brand names way better than Apple or Samsung, but gotta say their marketing is dead on Sale the same product just add a number or fancy word after the number and say NEW repeatedly on the color and camera lenses,  because everyone thinks colors is new and wants to be professional photographers....
People think they have the best when they buy Apple until they compare it to something else, that's a fact.
as someone whos using the headphones, hes correct
So funny 😂
0:02 best asshole - apple
God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son Jesus that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life
0:03 so true
thank you for this video. apple as a company.... trash
"...and the AirPods Macs, the HairPods Max, the AirPods Mini Max, the AirPods max and ruby, and finally, the AirPods big macs". Gotta love Apple...
apple vs samsung parody both phones
“It mutes out the poor people” 😂😭💀
nceart
2:02 I knew he would say that 🍔
I died when he said who the hell chose green 💀
1:55 I'm dying 😭💀
Can you please make these kinda commercials about Microsoft? That would be great!!!
The built in microphone part got me 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’m still watching now and dying laughing. “It makes them look better, the case could never”😂😂😂😂😂😂 not expecting
*I chose green…*
this was genius lmao😂😂  2:03
I owned a airpods max and they stopped working a month in my purchase because they had condensation inside the ear-cups that damaged the electronics and the only way to fix it was to let them “dry out” every 30 min. I returned them
I like how this dude has bought the AirPods Max but is still mocking it anyway 😂
Wow Beats by Dre I totally forgot about those. I still have skull crushers and have not gotten anything newer, as I type this on my iPhone 😆
I'm watching this on Airpods 😂😂
Not me watching this wearing my AirPods Max🎧
"ah, the beautiful sound of privilege."
Rob Jobs 😂
Apple fans wont buy Apple products unless its expensive 😄
HAIRPODS MAX 😭 💀
I love my AirPods Max and no i ain’t rich 😂 I bought them for myself cause retail therapy and i lost my AirPods and got annoyed with having to buy new ones so i rather buy the AirPods Max AND THEY HELLA GOOD FOR THE GYM ONG 😍😇
This was actually pretty funny lol
i have a pair and love them but i also paid for them entirely with amazon visa rewards/points lol. i would not have spent actual cash.
I can’t wait for Apple Vision Pro.   Video
I only bought one Apple product, an iPhone 7 in 2016. Not planning to upgrade
We want the Vision pro commercial
It’s funny cause I had a pair of Bose QC earbuds, and lended them to a friend who only buys apple products, meaning they’ve never used actually good quality audio earbuds. And they like, freaked out cause they were hearing stuff in music they previously hadn’t.
2:03 he talks like he’s in 1900’s interviews or audio records
Please do this on the Vision Pros. Please.
No seriously, why has this guy stopped making videos???
I am rofl.  I needed to see this bc I was wanting some.  Thanks for making it make sense.
Me listening to this with Airpods Maxes 😂
Why the fuck does he look like Eddie VR
😂😂😂 I like him 😊
the fact that u actually spent money on this shit, is insane-ly hilarious
It’s not privileged when you work hard for your money and can afford it
Loved this one. Am curious though... Did you record the mic-bit on the AP Max? If so, on a Windows computer?  That kind of "quality" of voice is what people told me I had when using these on windows. Was one of the reasons I sold the things off quite quickly.
Looks like I'm a at a shooting range 😂
The most common question would be is, how expensive are they?  And the and to that is always “Yes” they are. 😂😂😂😂
This convinces me not buying them! Thanks 🙏🏻
It’s ok to tell Apple is pricy but look at the price of audiophile headphone
Lmaooo the beautiful  sound of privilege
Mully probably bought the Airpods max just to block at the poor people
Apple its shit
Yes the fanciest and best products are the most expensive…so what?!? Everybody wants this rip-off. Sad that they are making them in China instead of the USA
Who the hell is pricing these? Apple needs better management and a new CEO. The only reason they're getting away with the price hikes is because of the iSheep who  keep buying it becuase they're irresponsible with their money. Also why they don't have a big range of affordable devices either, the iSheep will keep buying the Macs even ifnit literally cost annarm and a leg.
Headpod 🤣🤣
I go to a decently wealthy school and there are multiple kids wearing that shit. no I don't want a mid ranged computer, I want overpriced headphones.
THE MICROPHONE 🤣
Language..
Honestly it's overplayed asf at this point but I support the effort.
Ik exactly who’s buying this crap. Visited my cousin at his university and I noticed 2 things. University stupids don’t look both ways before crossing and all the asian kids love Apple. Literally every one of them was wearing them. Reminded me of highschool when everyone has bears headphones around there neck like a fashion statement
Me: Who the fk will go buy headphones from apple when there's sony Apple fanboy: yes
Make yourself a favor and don't buy this, buy instead a bunch of Sennheiser HD600, you will thank me later.
OMG 😂
So strange how these things cost the same as a VR headset, in some cases more
Skullcrusher evo still better
I literally went to check the price after you said it in the video because of how ridiculous it sounded. I'm still mindblown they cost 500$, wtaf
as an iPhone user this couldn't be more accurate 😕
These videos are TOO good. Gold. Just pure gold.
Apples helping the environment by recycling last years iPhones, AirPods and watches!!   not
He Realy is buying all of Appel products
I would totally try the AirPods big macs 😭
And still everyone buys them 💀
BRA-vo! My friend 😂❤
What is background music name btw
This is so funny
Watching this vid while eating a western bacon double cheeseburger 😊
I love the greens ones D:
Samsung best
the only max thing abt these AirPods are their price
Yo is this really how the mic quality sounds to callers? Shit sounds like those people on b02 lobbies talking shit and u can barely make out what theyre saying thats how angry they are😂😂😂
the way he said “who the hell choose green” so calmly 😂
Watching this with beats on
sorry guy   You are neither Charismatic nor Funny And you are as low as the Production Value applied to your videos  Disliked and get off my feed 😆😂😂😂
I bought green...
The part about the bra had me bahahaha-ing 😂
So much hate for the company who’s actually making your money on the plataform cause they always have something to say, lameeee
DUDE! Hilarious. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
People who watched this with AirPods Max’s on  👇🏽
I needed this laugh😂
I'm convinced, I'm buying it
Haha😂😂😂
I know right I love Apple but come on I would never give 550€ for something like these
Me…I chose green. & shortly came to my senses and returned this scam of a product. 😅
Question.  Why do you care so much about apple products?  Apple doesn’t care about you. Lol
$500 for headphones is pretty cheap in the grand scheme of things
How has apple not already sued your ass 😂
PUT GOD FIRST😊❤
How could you with the bra joke 💔😭😂😂 got me chocking but yoo don’t do that to us
Who the hell choose green😂😂
Listening to this with my airpods max is great
Apple should stick to phones, Sony and Bose stomp on Apple in headphones
I love my Airpod Max’s so much especially because they were a gift and I didn't have to sell my lungs to buy them 😝
the intro is so bloody funny "the ceo of asshole  😑 apple"
BUFU 😂 buy us f..k you
CEO OF ASSHOLE 😂
ok now this is a parody where every single thing (except the price) is wrong. the airpods max is actually a very good product, with one of the best NC on the market. the design is also so beautiful, it's simple, it's functional, and the button layout and feels is also absolutely on point. the iphone, ipad commercials are actually pretty funny, but in this case, there are some straight up some false and misleading "facts"
Im assuming for the price and goofy design these things support LDAC ? cause if not they are unfit for sale
I'm glad I watched this video before buying 🫠
Got a little cofused for a sec at 3:09, because the sound was so shockingly accurate...
He: 1:49. Me listening to the video with AirPods Max: 😑
How expensive are they? Yes. They are. Lmao
Should have been called the AirPhones.
Yesterday I rlly needed my headphones for an hour bus ride and the lil sh*ts were dead. The button was green and flashing and when I put them on and touched the noise cancellation button they did the thing but they were dead- 🤨
I was looking into these recently and found this video. It might me legit lol several times. Well done.
Mutes out the poor people is crazy 😢
People always ask how expensive are they the answer? Yes, had me dying.
All apple products are dumbass and overhyped... that's it.
for the love of all that is holy  in my country is 2500 soles, so about 800 dollars are you freaking kidding me? MY LAPTOP IS 1200! its 66% of the prize!! WHYYY
0:32 "it should have been headPods or smth" 😭😭
“And the answer is always yes,” 💀💀💀😭
Are you ready for AirPods Max Pro next year?
Hi everyone
this boy is so hot
Airpods Max is literally the most pointless things ever! I laughed at it when I first saw it! It’s literally just a shitty pair of headphones that are 500x more expensive than the same thing from anywhere else
Iphone 15 where
I got the Sony WHXB910N It is way more affordable($160) and it has incredibly rich sound and bass.
1:24 i did 😂
damn made me kinda hurt when he said "who the hell chose green"
I gotta say that these headphones are the most reckless use of money I have ever done, but I will admit, they have outlast all other headphones I’ve ever owned, but have the worst bass. So when I want to actually jam out, I have to turn to my Skullcandy crushers Evo, because nothing will beat them.
Listening to thiss with my airpods maxes 😭😭😭
And now everyone has them 😂😂😂
Who the hell choose green?, jajaja
i got the green 😹
when you allergic to poor people, what could go wrong with Apple's stuff right?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Not me listening to this on my green airpod max💀💀
Muting out the android peasants 😂😂 jk jk Bose qc are insane too
2:04 bro sounded like a Austrian painter 💀
And yet, Apple fans continue. I have a sibling who is is one. I cannot abide by iOS.
“Mutes out the poor people “ 😂😂
I love this boy. 👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️👌👏👏👏👏👏👏
look like to Apple mouse on the side of your head?
Apple users should be ashamed of themselves for feeding this corporations greed - sent from Iphone.
the microphone part has ended me 😂
great! LOL
This reminds me of Ryan higa 😢
I enjoy your videos, but hwo did Apple not foudn you and taken down your videos :D
i am listening to this on a mac and airpods max
ik this is funny and all, but airpod maxes are legit amazing, maybe overpriced but no headphones come close.
Listening on green ones lmao
2:06 the sound quality is kind of like Oppenheimer
fr💀🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Op commercial 😂😂
How expensive are they ? Yes 😂
Rob Jobs=Bro Jobs. If you understand you understand. And! Am I the only who noticed he always change his name?
rob job more like rob top
This is absolutely amazing 😂
I feel bad for the people watching this with AirPods Max lol
you’re unfunny
“Who the hell chose green” 😂😂 apparently a lot of pple.
Too much negativity  in this video. If every company make only products wich are affordable to everyone then they must make cheap, bad quality products. No, Apple shows you that you have to be rich, and try to make more money, dream big. Apple will always be on top!
2:14 got me dying
I’m watching this with an AirPod max lol
Who the hell chooses green 😆🤣😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
what the hell is that microphone xD kidding? not even first gen of Walkie-talkie sound that bad
the mic is sooo bad😭 i regret buying it
4:50
I literally never even seen anyone with these since they came out. No one paying 550 for these stupid ass headphones. Just buy airpods
in the grand shceme of amazing headphones these are cheap
i love asshole and their new products
I have them to ❤I love this
Hahahahhahahha
bro you top every single apple product i fucking love these videos
This is a very long commercial
the computer lab got me dying 😂😂😂😂
🎧
“who the hell chose green” omg😭
Wasn’t the general consensus for AirPods Max that they were good…but they are about as good as competitors in the 250$-300$ price range for almost double the price?
Yep! And of course I'm still sticking with my wired audio-technica monitors and android phone. Thank you, Asshole! I mean, Apple!
Me watching on an IPad Pro
I'm getting them Immidately!
if he's streaming from the moon, that's not bad audio quality for the mic. better than apollo 11 fo sure
For what you’re paying for apple you can get far superior headphones for sometimes less.
Now I am curious to know how do you charge those headset
Not me watching this about to buy the green ones 😅
If you like stuff like this, you'd like ZebraCorner too.
Good idea, the airpods pro max will come after and will finally support high quality surround reproduction (mp3). But wait, there are also the airpods pro max power, which has speakers so strong that you won't ear anything else... Literally.
I like head pods
I laughed a couple times 👍
Quick no one tell him Focal exists.
lots of support, makes em look better, a case could never 🤣
Make dollars makes cents. Lol
who else is watching this on their MacBook Pro on Starbucks Wifi ?
this is considered funny?
The fact that I got wireless headphones that have a long battery life of 42 hrs and sound really good for just 20$ compared to apple’s headphones which would be 6 -20 hrs for 550$ is just mind-blowing
LMAO😂😂😂
The sound quality is awesome......before it is connected to the airpods max🤣🤣
the box it comes in is big for no reason💀
you lost me at 2:04
Genius.
What a joke of a company
this the funniest shit i stg
Most importantly expensive lol got me rolling
I didn't watch  cause I just can't afford to even look at Rob Jobs😂🤣😅😥
😹😹😹
I thought they would be like $200 but they were damn near $600. Not even the Airpods are $200. They’re closer to $300. A brand new iPhone is like $1000. The headphones cost half the price of the phone itself. That’s ridiculous
is that really how the mic on those sound? that sux
WHAT IS THE BACKGROUND MUSIC?
As an Apple user this is as spot on as ever. I tried one of these for a few weeks and returned that piece of garbage. So overrated.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
HAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!! This was so good!
Someone tell me the point of apple making airpods if they already had a perfect headphone company
Terrible title to a slightly enjoyable video
Multiverseee
Tbh beats are just muddy bass bullshit I mean I understand people don’t like Apple but lots of audiophiles actually commend it for being better build quality and having better noise cancellation then the xm4 on top of that they also have deep ear cuffs which it’s competitor xm4s don’t have the case is stupid tho I 100% agree with everyone on that
These head phones really are nice.
What, I liked the green color
1:54 - 2:15 I’m dead😂😂
You know what I’m gonna stick with my AirPods Pro’s
Lmao I had to return mine cuz they started being so uncomfortable to wear! Smh and then the damn things couldn’t keep a charge fr
How do I wear it? IT KEEPS FALLING OFF?!!
was that the actual audio from the a max microphone?😂
💀
Is that seriously the mic quality?! No way XD
The goat!!
Max & Ruby 😭😭
"Introducing the western extra bacon cheeseburger only at Carl’s Jr."
Just buy sony noise cancelling headset. Its way cheaper, prettier and better quality
“And most importantly… Expensive” lmao
Sounds like Robber Jobs 🤣
pov youre watching this two years later and forgot all about this beauty of a channel
The headphone design looks like they came from a 1980’s work office but without a cable and in different colors other than black.
😂 nailed it 🙌
"The beautiful sound of privilege" 😅
They remind me of the bulky headphones at the listening kiosks they used to have at record stores 😂
airpods max are amazing, wish it was a bit low price
I'm honestly shocked that we still have customers 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Smh I'd rather go buy a PS5 than these bull💩 airpods max
Founder and CEO of as*hole🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Nahh bro you the real Rob Jobs finna sue you smh🤣,this shouldn't be legal 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
By the Sony xm4s people !! They are half the price and 1000x better
crying 😂
Hope you make the s23 ultra
Thank god I'm not apart of the Apple idiots users 😂😂😂😂 rob been slaying them to hard 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lmao
Bro, that was actually funny 😂
The mics part killed me🤣🤣
Isn’t crazy even with this deep truth, people still buy it?
he tryna be funny
I thought this was a joke..so I googled it… when tf did Apple do this?! 😂
So funny 😂
APPLE: How expensive these will be?   Yes    😂😂😂 that took me out
So good man!
Gets an airpod max ad right before watching the video 👁️👄👁️
THE MICROPHONE IS SO TRUE
LMAO
fr tho
one of my airpods went through the washing machine. and it works fine apat from the microphone now it sounds like im swimming with 70 showers on and a leaf blower with a megaphone
So according to you every Apple items aren’t different from the one that came before them  in this iPhone 5 and 14 pro are the same
One day apple is really gonna cross the line with prices and people are not gonna be happy…
Apple forever 🤍🖤
Who the hell choose green? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Factssssss
I’m so 💀💀💀💀😂😂😂😂😂
as I'm using mine watching this
Next up  Air Pods Pro Max for the affordable price of one kidney!
My fav color is who the hell choose green
I can afford the AirPods max but I already have AirPods 2
I wish there was a way to like a video twice
Steve jobs wouldn't do a better work
It’s sad how bad the microphone is
i’m still buying them lmfao
Honestly the goofiest looking headphones
the microphone just got me dead like I mean 😂💀
POV you want to copy beats but you are scared of copyright
"looks like im at the computor lobb or irrnoh.."  -Rob Jobs 2021
This guy is too funny😭
whatever, I love apple... i even spent 35 dollars on their air-tag learther keyring. lol. got their leather waller, MBP14", airpods 1, airpods pro, iphone 13 pro, magic mouse, magic trackpad, apple TV+, apple tv remote, airtags,. whatever. i've been an apple fanboy since i was 9 years old using the colorful iMac!
2:45 "so anytime you're not using the headphones they're still dying". Absolutely comical, I truly laughed at that one. I absolutely agree with that foolhardy description. I really do wonder why they would bother to not do that.   And instead, when you have them in their case,  it's in "ultra low power mode". (Spoiler: they still die pretty quickly.) I don't understand why on earth they wouldn't at least have integrated the feature to turn them off via Siri or something.  Just doesn't make any sense.
I’m laughing watching this video wearing AirPods max, I’m confused
you ate the end
is it relly 500 dollars ? oh my god.
glad I clicked on this video, you're so funny
I just bought the Sony 1000mx3. I paid 79 € for them. Yeah, you read right 79€, they were on sale. I am so happy with my life.
Who the hell chose green 😂
Hamburger-pods max😃😃😃😃😃
hahahahha
hairpods max, airpods macs🤣🤣🤣
“I’m shocked that we still have customers”. Me too 😅
the  built-in microphone  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
LMFAOOOOO😂😂😂😂
HILLARIOUS
The most ridiculous things are: 1. The Price 2. That you can’t turn them off 3. The case is not even covering the ears of the headphones proper 3. No headphone jack…
Headpods 😂
"the Airpods Max & Ruby," HELP NOSTALGIA-
Apple needs to make keep making products so that we can keep having these honest commercials
y'all act like apple was the first company to make a luxury item, or that there aren't headphones much more expensive than this...
.-.
need them though
"Who the hells chose green" 🤣🤣
2:01 best moment 🤣🤣🤣
how expensive? yes
Intro Music was copied from American psycho intro or almost the same, well it gives the same vibe with the voice
All things considered, those headphones look rather cool.     The only problem is that they're made by Apple.
who the hell chose green 💀😭
max and ruby      NOSTALGIA
”— we were able to get rid of wireless charging, altogether.” 🙂🫥 bro stfu 😭😭😭😭😭😭😂 😮‍💨🫁
I’ll stick with Bose. Apple doesn’t know sound and should stick with their overpriced not so smart phones.
@Apple
These headphones are a scam. They trouble pairing, the sound isn’t that great, and far away with the mic you sound like complete ass.
"I gotta say the sound quality is amazing.. before it's paired with airpods max" LMAOO
Steal Jobs speaking himself
🤣🤣🤣
One of the best headphones back in the days (:
Probably the ugliest headphones ever made even $7 earmuffs from local hardware store look better. I'm seriously believing that there is some bet going between Apple managers how they can shit out even shittier products and market these as "gold standard tech innovations"
Apple started raising prices even more after seeing how people acted over supreme 😭
People, if you are willing to spend some decent amount of money, go with reputed audio equipments manufacturing brands. They are in the professional audio space since 30 to over 100 years. AKG, Klipsch, Beyerdynamic, Shure, Harman, Bower & Wilkins, Focal, Grado, Audio technica, Sennheiser, V-moda etc.
😂😂😂 i love apple products but this is nailed
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
The noise cancellation legit gives me a headache. They do sound amazing, though.
wdym "who the hell chose green" it's like the prettiest
Does not look like a bra it looks like a bag
It’s filled with 2009 jokes but with a 2020 product, fascinating
the airpods max and ruby 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can’t believe we’re back to this
air pods max have the same speakers as my 100$ all devices logitech headphones
Problem is not Apple asking ridiculous prices for their products but people willing to pay that price.
You look like an off brand eddievr
"The price doesn't even make sense....... because it makes dollars" LMAOOOO
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
now i need tham
Great job Rob!
LOL
accurateee
"The beautiful sound of privilege" LOLL 😂😂
“Who the hell chose green”
“It looks like I’m at the shooting range” 💀
Finally youtube seems to understnd my kind of humor. Geat job.
hahah, okay your first joke, got yourself a like
That is the most atrocious shade of pink I have ever seen 💀
i bought mines for $900… tbh i love them they are comfortable and i love how they r big but the noise cancelling.. i can still hear most things
Damn classis. 😂
I love that he mentioned engraving, and when the footage of the inside of the right ear appeared, I thought that the big R referred to Rob
2:38  3:37 💀
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The fact that he bought these
this is such ryan high energy and I love it
Bro I got wireless ear buds that were $50 rather then $200 and they are better as I had AirPods
Best video I’ve ever seen my entire life 😂
rob: like headpods apple: WRITE THAT DOWNWRITETHATDOWN
You look a lot like Mark Duplass
Me. I chose green. It’s pretty 😭🤣
i'm an apple fan and i like this video
Wtf is that Microphone 🤣🤣
2:02 THE MICROPHONE ONE 💀
i would choose green but i’m the poor person it mutes out
“We’ve conveniently removed the power button, so when they’re not charging.. they’re dying” brilliant. LOL
who askec
Copied from Rudy mancuso
Overpriced beats
Jesus loves you ❤
Damn, I didn’t know this apple
They do have an airpod pro
Fackn apple sux azzss
„Who the hell chose green“ it‘s the most popular colour in my village 🤣
Lmbo 🤣 🤣 🤣 not that people can't afford them it's some don't waste money on things such as that. But this was hilarious 😂
Most of this is just your inability to speak. 1. Condensation issue. 2. Price. Those are the issues. Apart from that these headphones are fantastic.
Pov: you live in Canada and these headphones are 700 dollars 😭
im waiting for iphone 14 pro
Im legit using my Airpod Max while I was watching this
“It doesn’t make any cents. That’s because it makes dollars. Millions and millions of dollars”. cleanest pun ever
LOVE!
When you said the people who don’t but these are broke well actually my parents aren’t doing well we only have like a couple thousand dollars
“Rob Jobs” 😭😭
Ima cop the AirPods Max and Ruby’s foSHO
First thought that rob was a joke because of the prices
“How expensive are they” “Yes.”
"after we bought Beats and it went bankrupt we had a extravagant idea to create, you will never guess..."
Yes😭😭😭💀
Sony XM5's 🥰
send it on my adress
1:55 😭

It wasn’t asked for but it was a hit for us Pinterest girls
"who the hell choose green"  *angry australian drummer noises*
God loves you💕
Hilarious!
The case for these looks like 1. A diaper 2. A Chan la or slipper 3. A really weird bra
How expensive are they   ‘yes’
THE AIRPODS BIG MACS💀💀💀💀
No power block 🤣
I am so dead 💀💀💀💀💀
💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 I’m high enough and this video has me dying bro
i choosed green, and i love mine :D
"more wireless"
"How expensive are these?" The answer is always yes
Remember when apple’s whole business motive was More value and less price”? Yeah… me neither
change the rob jobs name to Steve robs
bro the acting👏👏
Missed opportunity to not talk about the horrible sound leaking these have. I just got mine yesterday and am super disappointed after just finding out how bad it is
I love them and totally don't understand the hate they always get. if they're too expensive for u fine I get it but why complain?
Song name?
They actually shit on Sonys
looks like im in a shooting range
Mans not lying lying
“The most common question we get, is how expensive is it?” “The answer to that is yes”
Pov everyone laughing at this vid & then buying them anyway:    👈😂😂😢😭😭
THE MICROPHONE LMFAO
Not me watching this from my iPhone
Why am i still convinced by this video to get them lol?
Got funnier as the video progressed
I wish i had enough money.
I love the mic portion
bro i thought this dude was eddie vr
I get just as good noise cancellation with my Sennheiser hd 280 pros, and they were only 80 bucks. do they clamp super hard? yes. is the long ass cord heavy and bulky? also yes. but the sound is awesome.
LMFAAOOO
just bought these and haven’t tried out the microphone. to anyone who’s tried the mic, how does it work for you
Lmfaooo this was so good. Probably won’t be buying them now. 😂😂
Pleaee come back with this series 😭😭!!! Your sarcasm and edit makes it so much better to watch comparing to others who tried!
I need one of these ads for everything so I can stop buying things 😂 these ads would make me stay on budget so well 😆
Please god do one about how only the people who can afford the new iphone will get saved if their phone dies in the wilderness. 😂
This is funnily relatable 😂 but jokes aside I wonder if there is anyone working at Apple here… By that I mean the ones working in inventing these products. Surely this vid should’ve reached one of them by now lolol
This is one of my favorite videos on yt atm made me laugh alot
pov: you are wearing airpods max
Gotta like the video if you listened to it with your air pod max’s 😂
even if this was the commercial everyone would still buy them LMFAOAOAO
Apple fans would still be it
Crying from the opener 😂😂😂
“Rob Jobs founder of a**hole… apple” got me weak 🤣🤣🤣
This is a copy of.rudy
at 2:03 i thought i was on a plane listening to the pilot speaking
Watching this wearing my AirPods max
“Airpod max’s. Ma- Airpods Max.”
THE MICROPHONE IS SO ACCURATE💀💀💀
THE SOUND OF PRIVILEGE
Song:  "Dismantle" Peter Sandberg
They are not that expensive 😂. I have them and I love the optimization of apple products. The sound is great and the noise cancellation is top tier. Battery life is insane as well. If you have the money I’d definitely recommend. I ware them to the gym every day.
Apple "If there are idiots to buy it, let's just make it". They should sell it at even higher prices, these people would buy anything with an apple on it.
but green is so pretty :(((
🤣😂 Funniest honest review!
the cutoffs-😭😭
I chose green
Sthu you are looking 4 cloud. AirPods Max honestly is the best headphones there is. Like we say in Sweden  ”HÅLLKÄFTEN”
People love paying for brands.
I literally paid only $300 for a BRAND NEW UNUSED iPhone 11 in purple w/insurance AND my phone bill paid... and I got all of that for less than these ugly headphones 😭 Apple just needs to retire at this point
Listening to these on my AirPods Max and I’m dying 😂😅
bro beats is sm better and cost less but i laughed sm in this vid <333
man hates on apple but buys all their products
Patrick Bateman music
Cool
Who the hell choose green people. Seriously.
The way he close the eyes when say Asshole do me. I died of fun. Am in.

Damn you Look like Yung Hurn
Who the hell choos green hahahaha
They offer personalized engraving so you can’t sell them to another consumer.
LMAO u killed it
This shit cost the same as  a ps5 😆
The fact I’ve never seen them in public proves it’s just severely overpriced for headphones that went competitive with literally any other brand at half the price 😂
They're prolly called max so it's not confused with airpods pro
Music: "Dismantle" by Peter Sandberg
wait!! is this really the mic quality???
And you’ll never hear from beats again….. HAHA

It’s a masterpiece ahahh
Yarin apelin Tam deyil demeki isiran olmus zavali
Apple isn’t meant to be affordable because they don’t make junk. If you don’t like the price, don’t buy them.
“It doesn’t make any sense… that’s because it makes dollar”  this got me laughing so hard🤣🤣🤣
I’d really enjoy the noise cancelling. My house is so loud, hectic, chaotic.
Most importantly - expensive 🤣
Skullcandy crusher evos are way more worth
why does people dislike this 💀
“Don’t buy beats” I literally did🤣 and they’re better
“The most common question we get is how expensive are they? And the answer is always, yes.”
ok hold up did anybody else notice that when they answered the "how much is it" question, he just said, *Yes. It always does.*
Was this inspired by the college humor CEO series?
forgot to mention the new water inclusive design. In order for you to get the least possible use out of them, they made sure to add this cool condensation feature after every use where you take off the cups and surprise, sweat droplets directly on the speakers for maximum water damage which is conveniently not covered by apple care
Is it really the microphones they got ?
« Who the hell chose green »
🤣
I thought of buying them but they look like ear muffs
❤️
The hell did I just watch 😂😂😂😂😂😂. I love this so much and it made my evening
A year later still hilarious 😂👊🏻💯💨💨💨

“Who the hell chose green” 😂😂😂
omg are u jennifer lopez's child? SHE HAD A CHILD?
🤣🤣🤣 I watched this twice and caught something new everytime. This is genius because it is soooo true.
I died at the microphone part because I always freak out when my friends with airpods send me voice messages with their headphones connected! They might as well use a 🥔 to record :-)
lol😂
Why would you buy apple if there are a lot often better alternatives?
Okay, but seriously what is up with the no power block thing?
God bless
couldve bought a pair of sennheisers
Im starting to think shein can do better than apple
One day, an iPhone will release with no screen, no speakers, no touchable interface, and the retail price of $99,999.00. As the fools buy it, corporate businessmen shall rejoice
Anyone else think the mini versions of the newer phones are useless?
All wireless headphones increases the risks of cancer and tumors of 50% according to my doctor. You forgot to mention that.
Poor people 🤣
So funny! Made me laugh 😂
Yes, they are expansive as hell and technically not worth it but they are incredible
😂😂😂
These are hilarious 😂
Pro max and ruby

„I know these are the only ones we made”🙄🤣💀
It shouldnt even be called AirPods 🤣

Like
Why this sounds so dramatic? 🤣🤣🤣
The Green ones are awesome tho! It's my favourite
Dont know if they are good or not .but ugly defenelty…and you are right ..looks like you are at shooting range”
It doesn’t make any sense… That’s because it makes millions and millions of dollars😂
and guess what this video make me feel broke which is a whole truth of my life
Hey that sound is heard when u turn on transparency mode on😂😂
The microphone part 😂😂😂😂 lol

Apple is turning into the Gucci of technology
the big macs hahahah
The part about them constantly dying 😂😂😂
Bro my mom got this for free at her work
I regret getting it so bad
ITS THE FUNNY MIC
The “AirPods max ans ruby” had me cackling 😭😭
2:02 bruh those aren't even Big Macs 😂
No power button seriously?
The fact I’m wearing a pair 😭
who the hell chose green 😭
So whenever you’re not using them, they’re dying.
- Like damn, hope you like buying these cause you’re gonna lose a ton of ‘em.
new sub. so good!
The price is the same as a current gen gaming console. Why anyone would buy these is beyond my comprehension.
So handsome though
and the “who the hell chose green” made me laugh LMAO
Lmao not me watching this with my AirPods Max on 😂
You missed the opportunity to call space gray, *Space Gay*  This will not go unnoticed
shooting rangeeeeeeeeee lmao
got it spot on with the airpods microphone lol
“who the hell chose green”  LMFAOOAOAO
"the people that don't have the Airpods Max is the same people who can't afford it" - The Wise Man🗿
Honestly though, Beats by Dre were always poor examples of hi-fi headphones. Their frequency response is uneven and they’re useless in a studio setting, even the ones that said “Studio” right in the name. Much better stuff to be had from Sennheiser or Bose, if over-ear headphones are what you’re after.
Lolllll
If Samsung galaxy buds commercials are honest
JLE has entered chat.
3:10
Me as a apple user can personally not like the video
But rlly tho they are too fucking heavy
I don't get why people EVER buy Apple's sound products. They're overpriced and ffs you can buy Bose, Sennheiser and Marshall for less than a quarter of the price and get better sound out of them.
they’re not even AirPods, they’re just Bluetooth headphones 😭😭
Currently watching this video listening with my Who-the-hell-chose-green AirPods max 😭🤣
Watching this made me realize I have not seen a single one of these in the wild since the first few months if release.  Tons of AirPods now, but these just totally went away.
Beats headphone are so overrated wtf
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Man I was falling asleep. The the video ended with an annoying song that sounded like someone was tapping on the window.  Now my heart rate is up
“The case could never”😭😭😭😭
AirPods maxes have been out for damn near two years and I AS A CITY HIGHSCHOOLER haven't even seen one person wearing them! I AM IN THE CITY Y'ALL!
"Who the hell chose green" Dankpods had to wait MONTHS to get a replacement pair because they sold out of the fugly green ones lol
Imagine paying over 500 dollars for headphones without a headphone jack or a power button 😭
I don’t think I’ve laughed this hard at a YT video since the first time I saw Trevor Lawrence on the beach 😂
You need to start doing Tesla commercials as well
Okay, here is my list of points why I love mine: - I love the green color - the noise cancelling works great - the transparency mode is great - the transparency mode with dolby atmos is insane - I actually find them comfortable to wear - I can wear them with my glasses - Despite all that I‘ve done to them, they have not a single scratch - the buttons. the buttons. the buttons. - I literally wore them while rollerskating, fell when I did a spin, not a single scratch - no one talks to me on the way to uni
LOLOLOL
I love this
Instant sub, thanks for making me laugh!
lil
The headphones are really uncomfortable and the sound quality is fine but definitely not worth it. I strongly advise to buy Senheiser headphones instead you'll get more for your buckd
omg i love this
"they're dying" lmaoo
Lol you wild fo dis
Samsung and Android are just waiting to hire this guy 😂
Is that the actual mic audio?? Bruhhhh 🤣🤣
I'm an apple fan and I don't tolerate hate vids. so change your content
why did you buy them then ??!
can i understand why are you filming a roast video and you own those airpods maxes ???!!
You're sending hate to apple ,, then no one forced you to buy it !
u dont deserve a sigle view on this.
Apple’s wired earbuds have better sound quality than the wireless earbuds
Imagine not being able to afford something... *shudders in wealthy*
Legit this was legendary.
What’s the piano music in the back?
didnt know apple an mcdonalds paired up to make the built in microphone
AND GUESS WHAT THEYRE FREE… CUSTOMIZATION AFTER EVERY PURCHASE
SO NOW WHEN YOURE NOT USING THEM THEYRE DYING
Accurate as hell 🤣
Green is dope what?
“Hi I’m Rob Jobs founder and CEO of asshole– Apple!”  Omg 😂😂
If you want ear buds get beats. If you want headset. Get beats. Or Bose.
Makes you look like you at the Shooting Ranch😂
This is like if Steve Jobs came back to see what Tim Cook did

Bro apple is out of business there Max not maxing
Listen I don't even know this gut, but why he look like a whiter version of Eddievr:||||???
“honest”… u lied so often in order to talk shit about them
for the price its pretty cheap
I like how some of the time he actually breaks character on how astonishingly stupid some of these Apple products are I mean 545 for a pair of earphones that you know you're going to f****** break or a 185 dollars for a stylus for a f****** pin a f****** pen that you don't use most of the time it's just like one of my friends always said I bet you $5 if I went out and got a regular bottle of water and sewed it for five dollars people would laugh at me he was but if I took that same bottle of water made it bigger and put a Apple logo on it just a simple everyday band with the Apple Insignia people would be spending 20 30 40 dollars for a f****** bottle of God damn water why because the bottle was shiny and it had an apple on it
airpods max & ruby
Maybe the AirPods Max were designed for users who prefer over-ear music listening experiences.
I watched this video in AirPods Max...........
Cheap alternatives:  *Airpods Macs* *Hairpods Max* *AirPods Mask* *AirPods Max and Ruby* *AirPods mini Macs* *AirPods Big Macs*
A product I need I dont wear buds
Not even gonna lie if you guys want AirPods maxes but don’t car about legit just research for a good reviewed supercopy and just buy that a lot of them are really good apparently
the microphone review just horrible, it's not worth of $599 at all, i would get it if it's $200-300
I'm unaware of these,but I  bet this is very accurate, and LMFAO
I love you, can't wait for iphone 14 vid
You don’t buy apple products because they’re cheap
Jesus loves you
Make an iphone 14 man
whenever your not using them,they’re dying👍
i never laughed so much 😂 and im only 5 seconds in the video lol the as*h*ole phrase really got me
thank you so much you just saved me like 600 dollars, forever grateful imma get the sony ones or sum
5:00
And most importantly expensive 😂
"Automaticly blocks out the poor people" Jesus I'm coming home cause I just died laughing
omg you are same like homelander
I honestly can’t tell if the Beats by Dre part was a joke or not lmao
watch series 8 parody 😂
"It doesn't make any cents, it makes millions."
You had to buy it in order to make this video so you are wrong in all your conclusions
Favourite highlights from this:  “And to be honest the only thing “max” about these headphones are the price” 💀 “I love how the AirPods max conveniently and automatically mutes out the sound of poor people”  *puts on headphones  “AH the beautiful sound of privilege. MMM! Gotta love it, gotta love it”  “the people that don’t have the AirPods max are the same people who can’t afford them” “ The question we always get is how expensive are they?”  “And the answer to that is always, yes”  I’m FUCKIN DEAD this was hilarious to watch lmfao😂💀
That's dope
The AirPods Big Macs🍔😂
“The only thing max is the price”😂😂😂

How expensive are they, yes they are  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Deadass gonna laugh when apple responds to this 💀
airpods max are the best apple product ever made. if I included a single apple product in my gaming setup, then it would be airpods max (and I will)
Bro I just came back from an apple store and dear lord I love how a phone case costs $300 when you can buy one for $25
Why is almost every top comment just quoting the video and adding a laughing euphemism
Did anyone actually buy these
THE FIRST CLIP LOL
Imagine if they named them AirHeads
Yo, its the wrong teleprompter 😂
DIS HILARIOUS
2:12 i love krispy kreme sound
What’s wrong with e the green 😩😭
What song did you use for the background? Can you please reply as soon as possible this is for my school project
I love the colors, who the hell chose grey?
Omgg why does the mic quality sound like when your on a plain and the captain is speaking!!!
"...Pink, sky blue, who the hell chose green" I'm losing it 💀💀😭
only the poor like this video
Apple is shit you people now think you know what your talking about when It comes to tech apples airpods are shit I don't find them to have the best sound quality and there are a ton of other brands that make headphones that sound every bit as good or if not better than these junk for the price they ain't worth that trust me you people should see how Samsung makes fun of apple all the time in there commercials Android is just better without having to spend a damn fortune on what junk apple is trying to make you pay for
“How expensive are they?”  “Yes.”
pov: i actually want them and i want them in green..
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Commenting for YouTube algorithms3
this can also apply to the LV wireless pods
Honestly, you’re the only reason I know apple products are coming out nowadays
NO CUS WHAT REGULAR PERSON IN THIS WORLD BUYS THESE???
The ceo of asshole apple
Bro these are actually like the worst apple product ever 😂
The airpods max only did two thinks right. A metal build and you can choose different colors. The case 🤮, the sound quality 🤮
im speechless, such a lesson, you are sou good at this
"So now whenever you're NOT using the headphones, they're dying." 🥲 RIP
I want them
I LOVE THIS
Comedy! “How expensive are they? Yes, they are”. Lol
me watching this video with my pink airpods max 👁👄👁 LMAOOOOO

Hard working and innovative workers Apple only to do is to buy that technology to Chinese innovators 😂
We love the AirPods Max because they max out your credit card
The microphone part got me HAHA
"so now whenever you're not using the airpods max, they're dying :)"bro why  is this so funny

Free Apple marketing 😆
Isn’t  the song from American psycho lol 😂

2:12 "One smoll step for man. One GiaNt LEap for MANKIND" 😭

WHO THE HELL CHOOSE GREEN
the microphoneeeee lolll
The ceo of asshole got me dead🤣😂
me i’m choosing green
".. and most importantly, expensive" 🤣🤣
No headphone jack and no power block blows me for that price point. On airplanes I need a jack. 😫
It's just my opinion but apple products are crap
They just look so dorky to me 😂 staying with my Bose forever
Bro you can buy PS5 for the price of these😭
Lmao!

Bruh I’m dying

I m just gonna stick with beats by Dre
“Yes” they are😭
im thinking about getting them tbh
Lol! So great
Me watching this on my green AirPods Max😨😨😨
Great video with a lot of truth thanks you tube for sending me this 👍🏾
saying that these are the best over the ear headphones apple has ever made is like when a mom tells her only son that he is her favorite son
Me listening to this on my newly bought airpods 😬😂
What song is playing in the background?
The audio from the headset 😭😭 I’m crying
Assho-apple :D
Really sucks apple bought skullcandy and made them worse they used to rock
lmao “don’t buy beats by dre cause we already did”
🤣🤣🤣 So accurate. We should all protest against apple by not purchasing their products and not only because we can’t afford them.
“The beautiful sound of privilege”
That’s kinda fun to find a video which mocking apple ironicaly AF. Buuuut i love the color green lmao.
This is perfection!
I pulled a power move and watched these with my AirPods Max
My guy talking in drakes tone 😭
🤣🤣this video🤣🤣
People are the dummy’s falling for these useless items.
Airpods bi macs 😂😂😂
I lost it with the Airpods Max and Ruby!! i loved that show!!!
HeadPods what a good name

🎧
“The case could never.”😭
AirPods Max undermines everything that AirPods are supposed to be, I’ll stick with my originals.
At 2:03 wtf was that sound 💀😂
Seriously though, you can get much better headphones  for hundreds less
Me watching theses with them on 🚶🏾‍♂️😃
Damn i got the green ones😂
AIRPODS BIG MACS
The AirPods macs 🖥

LMAO
THE SONG!!!! IVE NEVER HEARD IT ANYWHERE IVE BEEN GATEKEEPING IT LMAO
AirPods Big Macs KKKKKKKKK
The case could never got me dieing
i couldn't stop laughing. I need me one of these
When they said that they were able to remove wireless charging, I thought he meant that you couldn't charge them so you had to buy a new one every time they ran out of their 0.01 mAh batteries.
Western extra bacon cheese had me dead
more like who tf wanted “pink” aka red 💀 and 100% accurate on the beats by dre shade
"It looks like I'm at the shooting range... or something it looks like I'm at the computer lab or something" LMAOoo
It doesn't make sense that's because it makes dollars 🤣🤣🤣this is so good
500,000th like
Ayo😳3:46
It doesn't make any cents. That's because it makes dollars.
listening to this in AirPods max I kinda feel stupid now😂
And most importantly expensive. Is my fav line.
The fact that they’re more expensive than the ps5 is just plain ridiculous
AirPods Max & Ruby😭
Beats are 10x better than airpods
i only buy second hand, older model iphones so i feel a bit better about buying their products. i don’t buy into their over priced, slightly above average quality, brand name products BS. but i do genuinely like the look of apple iphones and their performance more than any other phone so that’s why i still use apple, just not their new, expensive shit. old, pre-owned stuff that works perfectly fine tbh. i have an iphone 6 rn and i’m very grateful for and happy with it.
This video is a year old and I ain’t even know they were createddd😭
im watching this with regular airpods pro
Also looks air traffic control 🤣
Sad thing is I would choose who the hell chose green,  I like weird colors
Currently watching with the airpods max on lmao
It’s just AirPods but they break easier
Was that really the mic @2:18
Then how the fuck do you charge them
they look like the pilot headphones 😭😭😭
😂this guy hit every queue. This is hilarious
I remember the shame I felt asking my mom for 100 dollar headphones (AirPods). $500? sorry, over my dead body
The AirPods max and ruby was harelois 😂
Bro what if the apple commercial/ads were actually like this 🥲😂
I thought he said “who the hell chose green and Semen” 💀 I had to go back to check and he said Silver but it would have made sense anyway.
Funny thing is they had to actully buy it to do the fake ad XD so apple still wins ahaha
HAHAHAHAHAHA THE MICROPHONE BIT
2:04 LOLLL
Mic demo had me dead 💀 🤣🤣🤣
Lol
I find myself watching this video every time I feel poor. Love this vid!
Crazy part is I can but these but no not 500
mutes out the poor people 😂😂😂
Listening to this on AirPods Max
🤣
Green is not a creative color
First video I've ever seen from this guy and I'm cackling
Reminds me of the oojleoo channel back in the day
I LOVED THIS🤣🤣🤣
These are excellent the only thing I would say if you wear glasses they are not that comfortable due to glasses arms being pressed to the face
I like green things >:(
Who the hell choose green 😂😂
"Founder and CEO of asshole-- Apple." IM ALREADY LAUGHING
We decided to remove to power button so even when your not using them, they are still dying. Lol
the AirPods big Mac
‘How expensive are they?’ And the answer is always, ‘Yes, they are’ I’m dead
Gives Ryan Howard from The Office vibes
This is completely brilliant
😂😂😂
This was so damn funny! And I’m watching this while wearing them 😂
“we can sell you anything  and we keep raising the price, im shocked we still have any customers, it doesn’t make any sense..  that’s because it makes dollars. millions and millions of dollars..”  that’s honestly the most apple thing to say, while still brutally true (has a macbook pro, iphone, apple watch, and airpods)
We also thought it would be a great idea to remove any kind of power button on the device. So anytime you’re not using them, they’re dying… 🐨
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
MAX AND RUBY WTF
Listening to this on the airpod max. (While traveling to my summerhouse)
1:16 “ space grey, pink, sky blue, wHo tHe HeLl cHoSe gReEn, and silver” has me dying 😂
"So now whenever you're not using the headphones, they're dying" shit got me good hahaha
😂😭😭
Bro he just knows that whatever he says where gonna buy them if we can 🤣
Me and my green AirPods max rn 🧍🏼‍♀️
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Saying all these things about the airpods max while having/buying one 🙂
Literally just Ryan Higa copy.
“Founder and ceo of asshole” 😂😂😂😂
The AirPods Big Macs lol hilarious
1:55 giving ryan higa i love it
Apple: you’re hired!
I’m wearing them right now.
Headpods 🤣
green is rhe best colour tho 🥲
air pods bigmacs😭😭😭😭
this could be called more if apple fanboys and fangirls were honest.
Apple : price ^ high  Apple Discount : Price / very high Apple retail price ; only Elon musk can afford Only few will get this T…T
Rubyyyy
ROBBBBB
“Rob: Crystal clear sound”  Also him: Sounds like hes inside a spaceship….
Looks like I’m in a shooting range “ 💀💀
Use Samsung and buy off brand headphones, cheap and effective and long lasting 😌
So good...
Good content
faith in God and Jesus
the fact that they don’t wireless charge kills me😭
Lol I saw this and right down from the video and it’s like 900 AUD now dead
Is it just me that thinks that Apple purposely makes there products over priced for free advertisements?
"I mean, it doesn't make any sense...that's because it makes dollars"😭😭
I had not cried laughing in a very long time. I rarely do. Thanks for that moment 😂
If you're broke just say it lol
tbh has anyone seen a person wearing airpods max? like i never see anyone wearing those
This video is 100 times funnier because I’m actually wearing AirPods Max right now. It was as Rob said, “Ah, the beautiful sound of privilege (or lack thereof)”. Honestly, I bought mine (not knockoffs) from Amazon and turns out that they’re cheaper on there than from Apple direct. Regardless though, I really do believe that they are actually decent headphones, although Apple’s price point could be a lot lower. The noise cancellation is much better than the AirPods Pro (which I also own a pair of) and is great for watching movies with Spatial Audio and Noise Cancellation enabled. The earphone cups also come out fairly easily as they’re  magnetic and be replaced for like $40 (what apple told me) if they wear out/get damaged. The headband can also be replaced, although I don’t honestly know how much that is for a replacement. Regardless, happy watching guys.
"bras, it provides support and makes them look better, ours could never".  You're just too good at this
Bro wtf are these? 😭
“Don’t buy beats by dr dre, cuz we already did” 🤣🤣🤣
“The AirPods Max and Ruby” is superior 🤧✋🏽
You’re soooooo funnnny😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Haven’t seen a single person who owns these I’m pretty sure everyone would rather have a small case you can carry in your pocket with wireless earbuds
bro........funny AF
I love how he has the fake one lol
airpods max are the headphones ever made
the microphone test LMAO
Rob Jobs is old . Now it should be Jim Crook
Who else waltching this video with his airpod max[es(?)]?
Apple in 2016: Current Wireless Headphones have a wire surrounding them so we made AirPods without any wires Apple in 2021: AirPods Max is here sskrrrt
I’m crying 😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is so funny
1:44
The cheaper options had me DYING.
u a  irl
Man Apple should be hiring you rn, you're clearly better
Bro u didn't mentioned from who u took this concept
fr why do i keep buying from apple? pls android needs to b trendy or something
Came for the dragging. I own them…Facts. And the phone sound quality is terrible
I would buy more products if adverts were like this
I recon 550 is a bit cheap
Only good thing: harder to lose
in apple on one knows how is approving the Design
2:10 he literally sounds like Franklin Roosevelt giving a speech for ww2
Ugh u just have to ruin everything
I'm yet to see a person wearing these in public with how expensive they are 💀
Yeah fuck apple and every other company that charges high price for lowest quality and ugliest colors and look. Like a grandma from the 40's works for Apple design team.
the alternatives to the airpods got me giggling “the airpods mini macs and the airpods big macs”🤣🤣
Bro the mic killed me 💀
the mic got me
I can’t afford it because my dad doesn’t have enough money
sennheiser would be laughing at the audio of these xD
EAR PODS BIG MAC?

Why is he trolling so hard🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Max and ruby what a throw back to my childhood

Listening with airpod max lol

the audio of the airpods max caught me off guard
so expensive I never knew these were a thing cause I aint see nobody wearing them
I started laughing at 2 seconds
“Hi im Rob Jobs CEO of” *human error intensifies*
they won’t do what you do because what’s the point to sell it if your making your own product sound bad
jesus this is hilarious
They look so awful lol. Like really really awful.
If only sony and jbl made their microphones like the airpods bigmacs...
HeadPods would have been fucking awesome!  Are you kidding me!

Air Pods Max & Ruby... that says it all hahahaha
headpods xdd
New fan Here! Great stuff Rob! Loooove your humor!! <3
I literally forgot these even existed.
Lololololol
“People usually ask how expensive are they” “And we say yes… yes they are”

I have some actual audiophile quality headphones and I don’t understand how they consider it ‘value’. I don’t in any way dislike apple (I use beats earbuds, an iPad and an iPhone) but AirPods Max are overbuilt and overpriced for their limited functionality
*still buys them*
You pronounced "trillions" wrong.
its tuv!
Fucking gold
My man said when ever your not using the headphones….there dying 😂
2:03 bro sounded like the phone guys from fnaf💀, also was that audio actually from the head phones?💀
There is so much better sounding headphones for a way more realistic price.
Bruh. Using AirPods Max every day and they are the best headphones I’ve ever listened to.
I like how it's the price of a flipping PS5!!!!!
the mic nahhhhhhhh 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Hilarious 👏
1:55
Wonderful irony😀😀
Yes they are
Where was the case? I just saw a bra… Why do you have a bra…
"they work good :D"
Ahahahahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂bruh I’m literally dead
me wearing my green airpods max: “yeah, who would choose green…”
This is so unfunny
Are those horns? Apple you are the devil!
Honestly, I see them as a cash grab but at the same time, people who buy these usually like headphones more than buds. And I’m one of those people.
Love rob videos
"Air pods max are overpriced" me listening to this with $1500 headphones, yikes
i love your vids
Funny but the price is absolutely okay for what you get
man the big macs lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Eh, I think I’ll stick with my AirPods BigMacs
So premium it doesn't come with a power button
Founder and CEO of azzhole-APPLE
2:06 😂😂😂
0:04 😂 you got me from the first ones)
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
HATER
It was me, I chose green.
It doesn’t makes any cents because it make millions of dollars !! 😂😂 BARS 🎶🎶
The wrong teleprompter lol
He is just trolling 🤣🤣
you earned your sub
I like the Airpods big Macs and it doesn't make sense (cents) but dollars.
It provides lot of support,and makes them look way better in my opinion, The case could never..
"who the hell chose green."🤣
in airpod max u actually cant hear a thing
No one gonna comment on the fact that the background music ties it all together?
Had to watch these again after copping the actual product bought myself the sky blue AirPods Max and a 13 pro max and a M1 max 16 inch MacBook Pro 2021
i buy apple because i can't adapt to change of any sort and a different design in another brand would have me end up not using it at all. it sucks tbh.
AirPods ain’t enough I need the music in my bloodstream
Tbh the only the max is the price 🤣
AirPods Max 2: $499 for 8 hour battery playing time. $649 for 24 hour, and $849 for the world’s best, longest 72 hour playing time!
asshole i mean apple lmaooooo
How much how they?               Yes...
And buy beats by dr dre  From a drizzle into a down pour
Has anyone noticed how mrwhosetheboss completely just ripped of ROB??
🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
I’ve watched this video like 3 times in the past year
“iPhone Max and Ruby”  I thought no one knew about that show anymore, it’s nice to see an old show being brought up every once in a while
It’s the music for me 🤣🤣
i am really a apple fanboy, but your videos are the best
AirPod is the most profitable item in apple line up. They make more money than Intel, Msi, almost all PC components brand, instagram,m etc
Why apple products r this high
The only thing i hate iPhone is the price but this is really funny tho 🤣
I swear I bet the whole point of this is to flex his AirPods max
i like green. i mean space gray is better but i still like it.
airpod pro max is better ngl
He robs jobs?????????
I belive Apple can sell a stick for $1000 and people will buy it.
Make ads for every phone
mutes out the poor people this video is hilarious
Idk why there an “E” chain in the comments but ig I’m down 😂
THE MICROPHONE PART IS GIVING NEIL ARMSTRONG ON THE MOON VIBESZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!
It doesn’t make any sense. That’s because it makes dollars. Millions, and millions of dollars.
Revisiting this just to listen to it on my AirPods Max
This video is at 6.9million views LMAO 😂😂😂
Lol
Jesus loves you !
Slow Clap.... Clap..... Clap....
This is very similar to Mrwhosetheboss' video i'll give you the benefit of the doubt
Here’s my humble opinion about them. I’m currently an Airpods Max owner who previously owned Sony xm4 and Bose NC 700 for a couple of days. If you want to use headphones just at home and to be free from any annoying noises, and you’re already in the Apple ecosystem, and you like to watch Dolby Atmos movies often, you won’t regret buying Airpods Max. Their ANC performance is marginally better than that of any of Sony and Bose headphones according to a measurement performed by a Korean YouTuber called “0DiBi”. Also, another great thing about Airpods Max is their white noise level in background with no music playing is way lower than Sony’s and Bose’s. That said, if you want some headphones you like to use mostly when travelling, go get some lighter, cheaper ones like just normal Airpods or cans from Sony or Bose or whatever. Personally I couldn’t keep wearing either Sony xm4 or Bose NC 700 more than an hour due to discomfort issues with both of them, whereas I find wearing Airpods Max for several hours very comfortable despite their relatively heavyweight. Their innovative canopy headband and mesh cushions really work for me.
at wired time Bluetooth on / off does *airpods max* microphone works??. please reply..
"the beautiful sound of privilege."
who the hell chose green, and silver
This is hilarious.
I am a Samsung user and im busting out laughing.
the mic part got me dead 😂😂😂😂😂
I guess we should call you *ROBBER* jobs
@rob can you do AirPods 3rd gen please respond
“Mutes out the poor people” I tried so hard not to laugh. 😔😂
This guy is a legend of comedy 🤣🤣🤣
Stil don’t know why they would chose Airpods Max over Airphones Max
The build quality is nice, it feels good, and the noise canceling is great. But there’s some dumb stuff. For example, they’re made to use with only apple users. they have no off button. They  can only be (mostly) configured with apple products. You need a dongle for wired listening. I might buy these though, that’s because I’m an apple user so many of these problems don’t apply to me. And i really value comfort and build quality (I also have big ears).
Hey i love that green
I got nothing on iPhone I mean I don't like it since there's better phones out there but these videos are funny bc it's true
The mic check
They should be be called "AirHeads pro maxes" because you must have air between your ears to buy them.
Roooob 😝😁🔥🥬😅
He bought them just for this video💀💀🤣
Roast Every apple products..still use apple products 😂😂👌✌️
Lots of fun colors like who the hell chose green
Not interested in Apple products, only clicked because this man is GORGEOUS
I am ceo of asshole 😂😂😂
Rob am I poor if I don’t have AirPods Max but have AirPods Pro?
Lmao just bought pair
Your not funny
How do you manage not to get sued by apple
I cant be the only one that doesn't like this head phone design...
How come a single person can acumulate so much stupidity... It's mind blowing.
Low key he can’t afford them
Listening to this using my max.
the beautiful sound of priviledge.
Omg lmao “the case could never do that”
Brokies can’t relate. Me I am brokie. Lol
thats what she said
Listening to these using Airpods Max XD
I have watched this video like 10 times and it’s still so funny 😂
SEE! He never saw this comment because he can't hear poor people!
love your work but really surprised you don’t get sued
Is it worse to be a fanboy or pro hater like this tool
Apple is being hilariously stupid now, and then people look at people with androids with a gigantic phone that’s probably cracked. I’m saying this because I have a android
it was the " so when ever your not using your air pod max, they're dying" is what did it for me 🤣😂 @2:41
Air pods max sound quality sucks for the price
Yes so true we will bye apple stuff because we are sheeple bahhhhhhhh
Should have put, “or you can get skullcandy headphones for just 80 bucks but you won’t do that because apple didn’t make them.”
0 dislikes, congratulations   I'm using an extension that shows dislikes, I'm not just stupid
Matt black?
😹😹😹😹
“Who the hell chose green “ lmao
"AirPods Big Macs" 😄 I love these anti-commercials so much
I've never laughed harder at a product, these headphones fucking suck lol.
Sarcasm king
as an audiophile, the airpods max would be amazing if it wasnt so damn expensive
Ok listen I bought them and I love them but this man is speaking facts
That music kills it
"How expensive are they?..."  "Yes. They are."
This was hilarious... I bought these and instantly hated them, until I started using them. Hands down best noise cancelling and sounding bluetooth headphones that you literally cannot take outside because you look like you're working at the airport or a shooting range.
I am one of the poor being muted and I YELL IN YOUR HONOUR!!!
AirPods max… I’m waiting for the official release
B tech Ryan higa video
so brought the airpod max today. seeing ur videos!!
I wanted to get them, that microphone tho.
3:40 😂😂😂
😂😂 Drowns out the noise of poor people...most people
Could you upload in 60fps? Your uploads have a sluggish frame rate.
Wait these are for real.... OMG totally out of mind with apple...its hilarious .
4:42 is correct because 90% of people are drones and only buy because they rather follow the crowd then think for themselves.
Rob is the funniest person on YouTube without even trying, he's gifted 😆
why is this so long
YOUR A APPLE HATER ARENT YOU  SAY THE TRUTH
the microphone part had me dying lmao
Who the hell chose green-
But they are actually the best on the market… uhm.
Wait wait wait, you purchase these and you still don't have everything you need to charge and use them? Also, "I look like I'm in computer lab," lol.
This video brought to you by people who choose beats and skull candy 😶
"hi um rob jobs founder and CEO of asswh** apple"  make my day🤣🤣
I can’t anymore lol 😆
Drake!! Is that you?
OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT GREEN IS A AMAZING COLOR
Meanwhile rob in parallel universe "Oh this product is so GooOooD"
How expensive are they? Yes 😂😂😂😂
yeah...so expensive...haha (holy shit why are headphones so expensive?)
Prolly chose green to match the iPad air
*it doesn't make any cents, cause it makes dollars—million dollars 🤣🤣💀
What is the background music please name it anyone
🎧🎧🎧🎧
🎧 apple made the headphone emoji the AirPods max lmao
Lol, i definetelly cant afford this airpods, i was saving my money for airpods pro when this beautiful airpods out. I ended up buying EARPOD after watching Rob’s videos. Lol
3:40 lol
This seems like bo burnhams (inside) commercial add
Who the hell chose green 🤣🤣
Apple blows anyways lol
5 minutes of laughing 😂😂😂
Plz stop impersonation of Steve jobs because he actually launched revolutionary product but Tim Cook is the one who got this whole brand fucked up
Bro im crying
LOL
I have AirPods max and I love them but god this made me laugh bro😂😂😂😂
If you are good you like food - master oogway
The funny thing is green is their most sold color, and the microphones are studio quality noise cancelling.
Pls change you name to rob cock because steve jobs us pure genius
Rob the Apple tech guy
and i thought airpods were supposed to be wireless earbuds but now they're headphones
😂😂😂
Jesus loves you 😇😇
How expensive are they? Steve Jobs: yes
Who the hell chose green almost made me spit out my coffee
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They literally made AirPods so you didn’t have to wear these and now they make these
Do one for Apple Cloth
The AirPods max have deep ear cups for sounstage also dankpods recommended them he is getting another pair
It’s like how many times can apple spit in my face till I’m done… clearly not anytime soon
And the question is how expensive they are? Yes.
I would be embarrassed to wear those in public
My favorite color is green and the green headphones look like shit
Me literally watching this with Airpods Max Me: ._.
“Founder and CEO of asshole” got me😂
great product anyways, and reasonally priced for what your getting
If you wear those at the gym people  just look at you weird 😂
2:03 bruh I started dying 😭💀
Buy a pair of overprice terrible headphones for $550 or buy a pair of really nice beats headphones and a new phone for $100 less?
Why the F do I have to pay the amount of a PS five for some stupid AirPods Max? They make a good point what about Pro Max I can go to the dollar tree and get stuff just like that
I feel like the only one that did not know they existed because I haven’t seen a single person wear them
The mic test had me dead
Me who instead spent 400 dollars on real headphones and a Bluetooth receiver because let's all be honest for once, the issue was never the cable, it was it being connected to the phone.
He's soooooo honest..omg😂😂
Apple will become the new EA…         nvm…      They already are
uuuuuuuu, mrwhosetheboss already did this a looooooooooooooooong time ago. Just sayin, BE ORIGINAL.
yea but you know the air pods maxs are amazing
This is a bit over exaggerated i mean yeah it's over prices is fucked but the quality and cleanless is almost worth it
Outro music?
There’s no power button???
It's amazing how accurate this is. I don't like how it looks and I can't afford it
This guy is like nigahiga used to be.
Hi, I’m rob jobs, founder and ceo of asshole
Thank you, I really needed this laugh today. You rock man!
How much are they “yes your wallet”
Shit! I gotta buy it
😂😂
Army's new Earpro looking too shiny for the range
“Huh?”
Ok this was hilarious
The AirPods max&ruby lowkey kinda clean though 😬😬🔥🔥🔥 I’d cop those
I would for real by it if they said that
Ngl just looking at them. They should be worth 100$ tops
I can't get over the, " Hi I'm Rob Jobs founder and ceo of asshole- APPLE
yap
You need to do one of these on apple cloth 😂
im ded
If Rob's merch and was honest (JOKE)
Boooooooooooooooooo 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
When he said "whenever you're not using the headphones, they're dying" I yelped at my desk
i need this mmanz playlist
Airpods max and ruby had me dying
This guy actually looks like @EddieVR for some reason ngl
Just as good as LLS 👏
Now I feel bad that I begged for one. My mother just looks at the price: 550$ Im sorry mom.sorry.
Imagine apple watches  these vids..
"AirPods Max&Ruby" that brings me back
“Headpods” 🤣
who the hell chose green 😂😂😂😂
Yeh... you're the founder of apple... 🙂 Steave:Who am I? 😥
I feeel like despite these videos, hes a big fan of apple :))) he bought every single one of them :)
He still bought them tho
C Y P R I E N did it before
Its always the minimal clothing, but they are like probably 5K
Yet people continue to buy from apple.  At this point…your either stupid…or just to stupid to realize it.   iPhone 14…our most innovative phone yet. Selling point…you guessed it…the cameras.  “I see you got that Sony alpha A7” - apple’s new competitors.
" Who the hell chose green" 😂  I love how calm his voice is lmfao
Wait but the the airpods max are the best in their field right now (as far as I know are unmatched in sound quality, build quality, and noise canceling)  Of course you can always buy some open backs like Sundaras for $350 or just some good old DT 770s for sub 200
The price is very steep, but it is expected for the “apple” branding that comes with it. Now when it comes to functionality, these blow your mind in regards to experience with audio. The clarity, spacial audio function with head tracking, transparency and noise canceling modes….they truly shine. As opposed to Beats, they don’t over amplify the base for that “hip” sound. If you play a lossless file and close your eyes, you get transported into the audio. It’s remarkable. Once again, I agree they are steep in price, but the experience is well worth it.
3:43 bro I hope everyone got the joke because it was a good one.
In Australia they r 1000 aus
Bit of a twqt
I can’t stop staring at his eyebrows… just me? K
The sound of the built-in microphone!!! 😂🤣
100% true
Hardly ever comment but this was hilarious!! Lol subscribed
I find it extremely funny when people say apple is expensive when they literally have a samsung which almost the same price. People complained about apple removing the aux and then a year later samsung did the same when they specifically said they weren't going to remove the aux. The same goes for everything else they are copying like removing the wall charger etc. Apple and android phones are all expensive.
Is that a real product? I guess it didn’t go so well since I’ve never seen it.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Eat your heart out, Jacksfilms lol
Thank you
I literally started sobbing when he said the “when you aren’t using them, they’re dying” 💀💀💀
How expensive are they? Yes. They are.  💀💀💀
i so know that this dumb guy likes samsung thats why he is making fun of apple stupid samsung
Who the hell choose green 😂😂
My mom got green ☠️
THIS MADE MY DAY OMG HAHA
BRO i thought these were fake and you just used a random pair of headphones and exaggerated it 😭
Founder and CEO of A**hole 😂🤣💀
I just wanna try the upcoming "Airpods Gigantic Notched Edition" !!! Those will be awesome
Laughed the entire way through. Got some serious Ryan from the office vibes. This shit was gold.
idk if I’m stupid for realizing this just now, but this is literally just a pair of headphones with an elevated price
"Yes they are"
This made me laugh. But people that use apple earphones or headphones that think they are the best you know only say that out of being a fanboy for apple as there's so many headphones and earphones that are way more superior in every way
ha ha yall so funny even i forgot laugh
The mic sounds like Neil Armstrong when he was talking on the moon
0:35 💀💀💀
It doesn’t make sense, it makes dollars. 😎
Holy shit it’s been 9 months 🤯
I died on 2:10
12 $ for socks you crazy
That burger slaps!
"...mute the poor people..." 😆 Love your work sir! Such an awesome slant on the apple illusion.
*This was so good! That apple used this as theyre own!*
He prolly only making These videos so he can afford the products himself with the help of tax advantage
Can i get the “who the hell chose green”
for your information AirPods max do are not available for free engraving as you mentioned in the above. get your facts in order before you go around making a video on one of the finest companies ever. YOU BETTER GET THIS STATEMENT STRAIGHT INTO YOUR DUMB HEAD.
Headpodes 😂😂😂🤣
I personally think that they sound good and look clean, the case is just stupid and I hate it but 550$ thats expensive
I don't like the design. On the airpod max. Looks ugly and to me is a waste of money. And I don't think it doesn't sound good. I got my jbl and sony and they sound much better then the airpod max.
Headpods 🤣🤣
"The case could never" *advanced humor*
Plot twist: apple releases dumb products just so ROB buys it and makes a video
Just… LOL
Rob Bought A pair of $500 headphones just to make a video degrading the headphones price, design, and name 😂😂😂
iSheep seething kek.
honestly though. the only features is volume control from the headphones and they last longer. The pros have every single feature and are just as comfortable.
Don’t bother buying a pair of Bose QC45 headphones when you can get less functionality, no actual case, and a dumber look for double the price
What is the name of the background music? ❤️
More Apple crap with that almighty price tag
1:11 Man, I can’t argue with him there
Looks like bra HAHAHHA
Jesus loves you
The fact these are still cheaper then Bose or Sony higher quality headphones
they reinvented the headphones with the airpods, then decided to scrap it and go back to good ol' fashioned headphones
I like “who the hell chose green” color lol
Y'all are asking about the price the answer is yes lmao
HAHA 😂 .. I love this
say''hi im rob you, i mean rob jobs''
Crystal clear mic , lol
“Founder of asshole” I died before the first 15 seconds :(
Apple audio products don't even sound good at all, either. They're easily beat out by ~$120-$150 wired headphones.
Im waiting for you apple polish cloth edition😂😂😂😂
Who has actually seen someone wearing these headphones.I havent????
Too good man
People who dislike this video are Samsung users
Apple: twice the price   Twice the nice(ness)
AirPod Maxes
"How expensive are they?" "Yes, they are."
So funny. Thx for the vids.
Hahahahahahahahaha. ROLF
“Who approved these?” Freakin GOLD!!!!!!!!
Skyblue and who the hell chooses green and silver 1:21
Wouldn't it be ironic if these videos boosted sales of these headphones
Beautiful video LOL
Sir you are looking like a Bhojpuri actor LOL
Youre so funny rob jobs 😂🤣
"Founder and CEO of asshole ... apple fucking killed me HAHAHA.
the way he slipped up to say asshole in the first 10 seconds was just hilarious
Rob Jobs > Steve Jobs
Rob: Shows the mic quality on Airpods Max  The bot who makes auto-generated captions: *confused unga-bunga*
"Hi, i am rob jobs, founder and CEO of asshole" rob wtf?
Christ is king and son of God. Only He can save us from our sins, for the Only way to the Father is through the Son. 🙏✝️
Head pods😂
hahaha nice!
look, even the owner is concerned
The first time I’ve ever seen an apple ad on my account was at the start of this video…
Just look like 80s headphones
1:00
0:57
(“Founder and ceo of a**hole apple”)
The sound of privilege 😂
1:23 who the hell chose green.....exactly...who the hell did choose green.
I thought this was a joke until I saw the ad to buy them
Jokes apart they are actually very good sounding and work flawlessly with apple products. Downside is lack of power button and protective case. Price is slightly higher too, now you can have a better deal online as well.
They really didn’t have to add the extra $50
“Only thing Max about this AirPods is the price” 🤣🤣🤣
RodSocks😂😂😂😂
Did Apple actually buy Beats by Dre?
Ah... The Privilege 😂
2:04 U ARE SPEAKING LITERALLY FROM SPACE WHAAAT LMFAO
کیرم تو اپل
Making a stupid face guarantees I will never watch this video.
Lol I paused in the middle of the video to buy the AirPods Max! Apple can literally sell anything and I’ll buy it. Though expensive, they really do a good job mostly.
GET THE ROB SUCKS
I am in India and in India it costs us 60,000 rupees (800 dollars) in that price I can buy iphone 12 mini😂
He is making fun of apple but he is using it 😂
People who disliked the video has airpods max
That vintage effect on voice recording is insane man How did you do that?
“Who the hell chose green” 😂😂
Tim Cook watching this be ; This guy is really CEO of asshole
I've only used Android my whole life by choie and I needed this
Aswear this is the funniest most accurate shit … although I love Apple product tho .. lol
“ I love how the AirPods max conveniently and automatically blocks out the poor people”  he had me dying at the first minute 😂
MaxPods Pro
Those are the AirPillows
Me: waiting to show these apple honest commercials to my apple fanboy cousin
I’m pretty sure they’re jus saving the name “air phones” when they make a new design for the “IpHoNe”
It’s funny funny how he roasts Apple but buys all their products to roast them 😂😂
“*Air pods big mac*” 😂🍔
The microphone one lol😂😂😂
I got a Samsung add. OMG
I tried these and they are dog shit!!!!
How expensive are they? Well the answer to them is YES 😂
Lmao is that the audio quality though 2:05
Why tf do the airpods max exist
I literally had no idea this was a real product until I looked it up omg
The thing is tho, apple fully bought beats and just sucked all their sound technology up and used it for their products 😂
Are these real!
funny part he still buys it
Haha. This guy is awesome.
Lmaoo “looks like I’m in computer lab”
Who the hell chose green 😅
My Sony’s sound better & cheaper lol
They look like something you'd get at a Dollar store or something.
Let me introduce to you the first-ever Apple pouch with sound, Airpods Bags.
Same technology should get cheaper, not more expensive. There is nothing innovative or new in these headphones(Other than the bra), so it just doesn't make sense to increase the price that high. But then again  they don't make sense , only dollars.
When you don't use them, they're dying.😂 The moment you buy them, you're dead.😂 It doesn't make any sense. That's because it makes dollars - yoooh.😂 If I have to be honest, these Airpods look like two lynchers on your ears.😂
This is soooooooo true that i cant even smille
Amazing
bruh ain’t no way they sound like tht wtf 💀💀💀
Apple “EarMuffs” pro max
'Who the hell choose green' 😂😂
People will buy anything & expensive to look cool  should i  sell led light  tea bags  ok  No but wait it'll  make dollars thats the idea no sense makes  dollars   Gotcha! starts  up small business makes  small dog  ball warmers   that dont make sense i know but the dollars just  keep  rolling in  how cute :)    any color even Fluro
Love your work man…..seriously 👌
3:10 Missed an opportunity to say "the bluethoot debice is ready to pair"
“air pods maxs..ma- airpods MAx-es. a-air podS max.”
A lot of people can afford them but they don’t want to pay so much
They actually don't sound that great. And they look ugly and like they going to break fast.
I want an airpod max to brag how expensive it is.🎧😁
This is more reliable in deciding to buy it or not than the actual ad. But actually ew. These are the worst headphones ive ever seen😂 my shooting range noice canceling ones are better and they dont do shit!
I use Apple products but i laugh my ass of with these videos😂😂 These are just so funny
These are the best 😂
Too ugly to buy
You should change your alias rob jobs to the current ceo cuz I feel like Steve Jobs actually was good.
My galaxy buds live ran out of charge the same time the noise cancelling sound effect came, it sounded cool
Head pods would've sounded iphoney
Omg I just found your channel you’re so funny😂😂😂😂😌
This guy is dangerously hilarious!!…
I haven't seen anyone with these haha
The case could never lok
I have a low key crush on you lol
It doesn't make cents cuz it makes dollars 🤣🤣
Imagine reusing a 10 year recycled old joke and still being shit at it. pathetic.
2:02 😂
“So now whenever you’re not using the headphones…they’re dying”🙂    Dead😂😂😂😂

“The beautiful sound of privilege” 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
ig
shit, does that mean I have to pay you every time I take a shit
2:03 The audio quality is just out of this world. 👌
are u sponsored by apple?
I thought he was talking about the case , not the bra😂
"It looks like I'm at a shooting range or something, it looks like I'm in a computer lab"..... bruh, why do they look like my shooting muffs? Since the noise canceling is so great I'll have to buy some for the range
Busy max pro
I’m convinced to buy 30 of them now
1:23 I'm dead

Green is the best color for them.

Funny how ive never heard of them and its been 8 months 😳

The most ironic he pay for that
You have to add a meme.
So funny this is so true lol
It’s really good tho
The unusual liquid proximately sack because hobbies genomically disarm towards a recondite italy. used, low teaching
Really funny video but actually, the AirPod max wasn’t said to be that bad and some liked it.
They're not airpods now, they're AirPhones
Lol
Lmao ur funny as hell
You can compare the case to a bra all u want but it's never gonna be as good as a bra. A bra provides support and makes them look way better and as he said "the case could never"
“And guess what, it’s free. Personalized engraving after every purchase.”
you are so good at this mate, i laugh so hard. thank you
HAHAHAHAHAHA
and the most important thing:𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲
BTW pls stop with apple hate
I love how he litterly buys a couple of AirPods Max and he talx about things that are not true… he’s just jealous cuz the air pods max are better
Hi. I am using apple product but I really love your video & how you promoting Apple. By the way you are so cute.
3:48 a man of culture i see
100% accurate
I have the airpods max. They are the best sounding headphones i have ever worn. But after a whi;e they get uncomfy. So most of the stuff is just wrong but cmon, its apple. They are not known for innovation.
3:46 Im dead 💀
He only did this Video so he had a resason to buy them
Here is sound of privileged
Apple every year:  Here, take this chunky camera and the new OS with minor changes.
Rob jobs robs your money.😂
Lmaoooooooo I love watching this every now and then😂😂😂
The number of dislikes are the people who own the headphones 😂
Founder & CEO of Ass*ole
"Founder and CEO of Asshole" HAHAHAHA
Sooooo mf funny😂😂😂😂 but I’m gettin one anyways. I wanna block out the poor 😂😂
Bruh, they’re not even AirPods, those are basically just off brand beats.
this is too funny i can't even be mad you are apple smashing
Do with android phone
i find amazing that the guy while joking on apple makes them so much free advertising
If Rob got a penny everytime he roasted Apple he would be a millionaire
This channel is so stupid! You Guys can't do this!!!!
How expensive are they? YES
Like I laughed really hard. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"who the hell chose green" 1:23  Dankpods: *me*
they actually sound good tho its kinda worthit
The different AirPod names🤣
If people are rich enough or dumb enough to buy overpriced products that get easilty outclassed by the other 50% of the market then why don't do it ?
cant wait for the airpods Ruby & Max
Come on where the iPhone 13 video???
I could buy a freaking Ps5 , Nintendo Switch Lite and cheap headphones from the dollar store
Me listening with my AirPods max
😂
The fuck is this? How do you have 2.29 million subs?
Space grey Pink  Blue Who the hell chose green Aaaaaaaand.... Silver
Where is video for Iphone 13?????????? We need Iphone 13 review
"The beautiful sound of privilege." 🤣🤣🤣
4:41 can you sell me some drugs?
waiting for your Iphone 13 video..
2:02 i died laughing 😂😂😂😂😂😂
as an  apple fan i agree with you
“Who the hell chose green?” 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Why pay 550 bucks for a pair of Apple headphones we can get a pair of beats for almost half the price and they probably better
When he brought up Max and Ruby my heart went full childhood nostalgia 🤧
Bro said Asshole😂😂😂😂
who the hell chose green   🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm honestly shocked that we have costumers
if apple takes this video down its cannon
😂😂i loved the ending
Love this! And hate the fact that apple wont give charging cubes 😠 their products are over priced and now the other end of the cables are type C, but won’t provide a type C cube?!  And I’m pretty sure that if I used a more affordable one that I can get in Amazon and it explodes I can’t sue because it’s not an original cube 🙄
I don't understand why can a headphone be almost $800(Canadian dollars)
so much sour grapes in both the video and the comments… 🤣
Lmao, the AirPods max has got to be the biggest failure in apples history, it is overly, OVERLY expensive and these ugly bastards are no where near as good as my Sony wh-1000xm4’s, yes I know that those are expensive too but not as much as the AirPod Max’s, and I trust Sony with my audio more than apple.
I like the green ones 😭
"Thats because it doesn't make sense...it makes dollars" 😂🤣
Kola mass da dei
The comfortable mice biologically announce because vegetarian kinetically serve concerning a wide-eyed stool. puffy, roasted scent
i literally had to subscribe after 30 seconds 😭😭this guy is amazing
Hahahaha...u killed it!
Bro AirPods max 💯💯💯💯
I’m dying. Rob is my fav. 🤣
Doesn’t Apple already own beats?
It’s a good idea, but I think there called headphones.
me watching this on my jbl tune500bt’s lol
I’ll take an airpods big mac with fries
😂😂😂😂👍🏻
ily.
Thanks not worth the money on apples products
Literally it took me 2 weeks ago that he isn't actually the CEO and founder of apple😂💀💀
Him turning on noice canceling had me for a good bit
Max and Ruby, Ruby and Max
i genuinely forgot abt u💀
Wow... I didn't even know these existed until now. Ha, funny, they seem to have been around for about 8 months.
This reminds me of old smosh, rip their channel
Or get it on amizon
What does it say about me that it’s basically September 2021, and I’m just now even hearing about these for the first time. Like, I thought this was a joke....
I thought you turned on transparency mode on but I forgot there is just know one home
The airpods max and ruby, i would like those please
WAIT I THOUGHT THIS WAS A JOKE-
After he said who the heckk chose green i literally punched my ipad
Make a video on "If Politicians were honest"
I thought these were fake
It’s no pod no more bruh
2:04 😂😂😂😂😂😂😿😹😹
I can’t believe he would actually buy the AirPods max for a video
ROBs JOBS
Anyone else think he looks like Eddievr in the thumbnail
Should have called them Airpad
You are adorable.
They are nice, but Mezze 99 Neo is a whole lot cheaper.
Just a reason for luxury
2:03 the fact that YouTube’s auto captions can actually discern what he’s saying here
In Australia they cost $898
Yes
LOL
After 5 seconds watching this video, I already laughed
Jajajajaj epic
Bestttt 😂😂😂
Airpods Max and Ruby and the microphone 😂😂😂
Couldve been called the Airheads
Pack it up ted mosby
Forgot about this product.
The people who dont have the airpods max are the people with an actual brain
😂😂😂 I love his sense of humor
We should have a apology video, it’s actually great
Can you review wireless extension chords?
a product that no one really asked for, introducing the western extra bacon cheeseburger only at carls jr, LOL this cracks me up everytime. by the way is that even an actual menu burger?
Bro $580 is $600 dollars and that money could be spent on something like a ps5
Lol is this guy related to Jake Gallagher?? 😂
He looks like eddievr
"it looks like i'm at a shooting range" LORD HELP ME
Go get some bose
You almost look like David Castañeda from umbrella academy 🤣
When he activated noice cancelling I thought my AirPods Pro were activating noice cancelling
Me: so how expensive are they? ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)  The ad guy:  𝙔𝙀𝙎 10000000000000✍︎︎𖨆✌︎︎
cool
3:35 that's exactly what I thought when I first saw airpods with the cover 😂😂
i k this is a joke but they are actually really good in audio world dank pods is an adiophile and he uses it as a daily driver
This c**t is to funny
And he still owns one. How ironic.
Istg next time they make an airpod its gonna be called Airpod Premium Pro Plus Max
I laughed when he said it feels like I’m at a computer lab and they do look like those haha
Why does he look like a wish version of eddievr
They are helicopters headsets 🤣
My fave color is green but the green airpods max are gross
Everybody in the comments is like "Let's appreciate that he bought them" but like... if somebody criticizes a pair of headphones without actually testing them would kinda undermine their credibility.
This reminds of the office
Can we just appreciate that this man actually buys the product to showcase it and research’s it for some time to give an accurate presentation
Hahaha
It’s The Who the hall chose green for me hahahahhah
I forted
airpods macs hahahah
This should be the official Airpods max advertisement video
noooo!!!  I can't any more
Ø is danish
"We know you cant afford these headphones" me with vintage Audio Technica headphones that i bought for $1,400 :) and my friend has the max's we tested them with an a+b test... imo the old audio techs sound better a lot better
MUTES OUT THE POOR PEOPLE. crying
Yeah they are extensive, but if that’s a problem form you just don‘t buy them.It‘s that easy…
Man I like apple
Damn 😂😂🤙
“Who the hell chose green” had me rolling 😆😆😆
The mic sounds like what it  would sound
imagine if rob just did these as an excuse to buy all the new apple products
Creativity level 1000😂
From kids bop it this I’m proud
Are you Eddie vr
Its Kim Cooks now....
Max = more expensive
This is so good😀
apple is disgusting. I dont get why people buy their garbage
Røb: I’m rob jobs founder and CEO of asshole, apple
The Rob Jobs is so good. And that’s only the intro!!!
Wtf is bra ?
This is great
Dang I know that beat at the very end of the video. Can anyone help me identify it?
the people that don’t have the airpod’s max are the same people that can’t afford them. LMFAOAOKAOAOAO
Perfect
I know that this video is ironic but the part about microphones isn’t quite ironic.
"When you're not using them...They're dying."
The airpods max and ruby 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ceo and founder of what?
just get the pros if you really need apple.... they are in my opinion better anyway ion wanna carry a 2 pond charger with bulky ass headphones
It’s not supposed to make sense just take my money
Me watching this vid with xm-4s :🤣🥲
I love this! OMG!
The only real problem with these headphones is the price. Everything else is amazing
“who the hell choose green” 💀
Lol watched Marques Brownlee's "Luxury Listening" review after this and u knw what?   U are right again ROB and he didn't wanna test the iphone by dunking it in water as well lol
Why dont you have a plat button
“the airpods max & ruby” PLSSS
I love apple products but I hate the price😂
Rob socks ? 🦓RozSocks🦓
3:26. I died. Lol.
Apple : How do we promote our New AirPods Max to our Customers so that *Everyone* will see it ???   Emoji Department : 🎧      Apple : 😈
This guy doesn’t want us to buy anything at all 😂😂😂😂 if I was honest 😂😂
who the hell chose green and silver LMAO
I think I’m the only one who laughed at the Max and Ruby one…  nostalgic
So I'm the only who thought that was eddievr for a second
Yet you bought it
Bruh when he got to mic quality he turned into Kyle Ren
in brazil  is the price of 3,5 samsung galaxy a52 5g
😂🤣👌
How expencive will it be? y e s .
Airpods max r so ugly lol
‘Who the hell chose green?’ Made me laugh.
Copied mrwhosetheboss
I'd buy who the he'll chose green.
The right answers for premium speakers is BOSE.
Omg I died at “Brand new AirPods Big Macs” 😂💀
Customers:What's the price Apple: y e s
This guy is looking like conor mcgregor friend with blonde hair ( khabib jumped over after fight)
7k dislikes well now we know how many people own them
TOO EASY
The part with the mic killed me.
Can’t wait for the one with the no charger
airpods max, airpods pro, and powerboats pro are the only 3 apple products I can tolerate (if you can get a discount)
on real this should cost just 5$
I’m nz they cost $999 😃🤚
Lol the only people who don't have AirPods Max are the ones who can't afford it. Us audiophiles secretly ignores that in our corners with our thousands of dollars setup.
My god,they look like shooting range headphones
I just realized that you look like EddieVR
Im happy this man got born
Noob I got bose quite comfort 35 ii which sounds better than airpods max😂
Okay...I never knew Apple released over head headphones until I saw this video and this was uploaded 6 months ago! Where have I been in my life! Also they are the most ugliest design headphones I have ever seen. They look like earmuffs.
I watching this video wearing boat headphone
*Who the hell chose green Samsung with buds 2 green-color: *WE CHOSE*
tge microphone lol
''the case could never'' thats a comedic plot twist if ive ever seen one
Haha. Wait…I chose green.
EddieVR is that you?
My friend bought these and while the case is shit the sound is actually really good and so is the noise canceling
Everybody understanding this: 😀😀😀 Me not understanding because this is not even out: 👁 👄 👁
These literally look like the shooting range muffs lol
Some random dude: hey nice noice cancellers, are you a construction worker?
jeezus 12 dollars for a single pair of socks, sign me up!
The fact that they look like bootleg headphones from a swap meet and cost that much💀
So i guess it was a mistake buying them myself😂 also hate them because of the condensation problem they have
i actually dont think ive ever seen anyone with airpod maxes lmao
The intro though😂
2:42 😂😂😂😂😂
On point for the most part
I could by a ps4 and nintendo switch with this much money and still would have gotten a lot of money left
1:33😂
you know how much gold you can buy with 550$?
dankpods chose green
The dislikes are from Apple employees
Nice vid
“The only thing max about this is the price” this is gold lmao
Lol still can't beat bose headphones
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Jesus Christ is coming back to rapture his church
It's good but don't criticise apple, they make amazing products
How expensive are they?   YES 😂🤣🤣🤣
I’m good w beats LMAOO
1:39 i cant lmao this is so accruate
The lumpy fog clearly itch because paste geometrically brush over a kind bench. zany, juicy option
2:03 got me dead
Rob: we add some affordable options Also rob: AirPods Macs (doesnt realize macs cost more than the actual normal airpods)
Me having all apple  products 😃
I didn’t even know these existed
U love u man u so good at this
Apple products are for rich and successful people, like expensive cars or 5-star hotels. If you don't have enough money to buy them, buy something cheaper and stop being jealous.
There are AirPods pros we just always forget about them
The Ultimate challenge to passion Fruit
How have you not got sued
Next up airpods pro max ultra mega mini series GT
Honestly apple could just slap an apple logo on underwear and over price it and people would buy it
I love that he needs to buy what he criticises.
This is very very funny
Wait 6 months and get them for 350 lol. Here I am 6months later getting a pair. For $350 haha
1:48 my favorite, lol
Why would the airpods max need a headphone jack if its Bluetooth 🤔
If jealousy was a video😂
This guy never misses
Of Ass Hol... Apple🙃
My favorite color is "who the hell chose green"
Anyone else actually try these and laugh out loud at how bad they actually sound lmao? They sound as good as regular AirPods…. Which sound on par with a $30 pair of cheap Chinese ear buds I tried back in 2018 lmao. These things are the biggest waste of money apple has ever made. Which is saying A LOT
Oh we can afford them it's just me rather buy a car for that price
If I were CEO of Apple, I would’ve called them AirPhones.
It’s kinda ironic at end of these videos. Beginning, “overpriced and stupid.” End, “I would like to giveaway…” 😂🤷‍♂️
🤣🤣🤣🤣
2:10 sounds like he is about announce a lift off
1:47 lol I can’t stop laughing
i swear you're not funny
He don’t missss
normie
Apple do be taking notes, Ngl-
In india  Airports max and Ps5 have the same price lol
Founder and CEO of assh*le 😂😂😂
Watching with Airpods Max
did anyone even buy that
Ironically i got an ad from apple before the videos
Apple needs to hire him and give him a promotion 👏🏽
He didn't even had to lie about the price to make it a joke 🤡
Does Steve robs even knows what he’s making?? 🤣😭😭
Even if he make fun of apple product but he bought all of them😂
2:02 Is the mic actually that bad?
“So now whenever you’re not using the headphones, they are dying” it’s the truth, but 100x funnier😂😂
“The people who don’t have the AirPods Max are the same people who can’t afford it”
Claim your "im here at 420 thousand likes   and 6,9 thousand dislikes" ticket here
At least you got a good pair of ear mutton’s to keep your ears warm LOL!
The likes and the dislike hahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahahhahahah
Seriously, AirPods max are really good.
Heappods
420k likes and 6.9k dislikes. nice.
A first couple of minutes, I was like who the hell buy airpods max pro when you have beats by dre that cost much lower (not cheaper because it’s not cheap) and can do the same as airpods max pro.
420k likes 6.9k dislikes. Nice 🙂
j
They're ugly
All the dislikes are from apple employees
Hairpods max 😂😂😂😂
“the only thing max about this product is the price” -Rob Jobs
wait, the like and dislikes are kinda sus, 420k likes and 6.9k dislikes.
1:13  bill gates cannot afford airpods max .
very nice like to dislike ratio lmao 6.9-420k
Yes, they are.
I agreed with everything that he said… yet if I could afford them they would be my designated Netflix earpiece. They sound amazing and are built like a piece of art (yes even the case shaped like little butt cheeks) and are one of the most comfortable headphones especially for the weight. However, even if could be air out a 2nd mortgage and buy these… *we all know how good Apple’s old battery program is?!* I can’t see having to throw these out because they won’t hold a charge anymore
This man has channeled the sentiments of the whole world through his videos. He represents a generation.
420k likes and 6.9k dislikes
FACTS
I forgot max and ruby excited
420 like 6.9 dislikes
I miss these vids
Dank pods, Dank pods chose green
Funny as F***
@Andynsane
Still waiting for this guy to get sued by Apple
I literally thought you where Eddie VR
He looks so professionaly unprofessional

Mrwhostheboss does it best. Good effort tho😂
“Looks like I am at the shooting range.”
😂😂😂😂😂😂
O
Me watching this while using airpods gen 2. “Welp I guess Im considered a non flexer now.”
"A product no one really asked for" 😂😭😭
Even for me that microphone sounded way worse than I expected and it was not crystal clear as he said. Also the max comes from the price not the headphones themselves.
Apple is gonna sue you soon lmfaooo
If it don't make money it don't make sense.
the airpods max and ruby💀
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow that mic is such  mOdErN tEcHnOlOgY
I never tought that Jake Gyllenhaal would become a tech youtuber
I checked the Airpods revenues and it looks like they sell better than Sony, despite Sony being better in sound quality, comfort, noise cancellation, and over-all features. Business is really just about marketing. Just like this one, a bad product for a high price.
Lmao they’re not even pods anymore 🤣 they should just be called the apple headset
This guy is amazing at this lmao 😂😂
Hi god bless
“The AirPods Max and Ruby”
*Headpod* had me so bad
That customers are known as Isheeps who does not have brain to analyze Actual Cash Value
,😂😂😂😂
gem at 1:04
This man buys apple products to roast them and unfortunately he is a apple 🍎 customer
Apple is almost like a cult at this point I switched to Samsung and holy shit instead of a phone that dies in 30 mins I have a reliable phone that lasts almost all day
“AirPods max and ruby”😭😭😭
I’m am the founder and ceo of asshole
This is so funny that I watch this more than once.
Your videos literally make my day!! 🤣🤣
2:02 😂😂
You are just king of roasting 🤣🤣🤣
The ONLY thing Max about this is the Price 😂  - ROB
Bruh i rather buy ps4 pro than this shit  No offence to the ps4 cuz i have one
He is so funny 😂 I am dying watching this
this man is so good
RØB
I’m not apple’s fan but these things exist because there are people who can pay for, you don’t have to buy if you cannot , that isn’t their objective
This is why I chose Samsung
I laughed so hard when he said asshole but he ment to say apple
Screaming at this omg 🤣
Im highly offended
Y have seen mrwhoosetheboss doing this tipe of video
Y have seen mrwhoosetheboss doing this tipe of video
RØB: HEAD PODS IDK WHAT EVER  APPLE: RIGHT THAT DOWN RIGHT THAT DOWN!!!
Him: the people that dont have the airpods max are the people who can’t afford them Me: Aye, You wanna throw hands or what?
😂😂😂😂
“Who the hell chose green” 💀 just how casually he says that 😭
Next year they will name them "Airpods Max Pro Plus Ultra"
Yet the airpods max are one of the best wireless headphones.
Let’s start an “E” chain
Just found your channel..  Hilarious video... Thanks for the cheer up..  we need more channels like this.. new sub.. have a great day
Who listed to this with Airpods max 😂
Bruh i got an apple commercial before this vid lmao 😂
It doesn't makes sense It makes dollars.... Millions of dollars... 2021 marketing at it's finest
you are a huge nokia fan :))
i was watching the anthony padilla video and i clicked on ur channel in the desc to find that ur the apple guy-
For just one payment of 550 dollars(up to 1000 dollars in some places), you can get these fantastic headphones that will eventually die due to the electronics inside of them. In some cases, the headphones would just stop working and start playing loud screechy sounds. I know what you are thinking, "why in god's name would I buy this when I could buy a pair of decently good headphones that comes with a detachable cord and also runs on bluetooth? " The answer is, because we are apple.
RØB
They look so easy to steal
0:02-0:06 I was dying
"the beautiful sound of privilege" I died 😭
amazing comedy with that telepormting thing.....congrats who thought of that..u guys r killing it....
I m the hell who choose green😂
Airheads pro max
Dude I love these videos...they are so good
"THE ONLY MAX THING IS THE PRICE" lol
OMG Lmaoo love this 😂😂😂😂
Man this is so funny
Where is ,,we are giving you yesterday technology at tomorrow price"?
hi, I am rob jobs' founder and CEO of a**hole. that was very funny.
yk what, ima get these just for this one phrase “it mutes out the poor people”
All the people that disliked are apple workers
Don't know if you actually believe the things you're saying but buying the product to use in your videos isn't helping your case
best one yet
"only thing that is max here is the price"
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where are the Apple logos? Are those even Apple?!
How much are the AirPods Big Mac?
RØB: Who the hell chose green Dankpods: 😡
This was your excuse to put the Airpod Max as a business expense lol
love it haha sarcasme  briljant ..❤
😭😭😭😭 Ah, the sound of privilege…. 😭😭😭 You do this so well! Typing this on my 12 Pro Max
“I love how the AirPods Max conveniently and automatically mutes out the poor people” 😂😂😂😂
Man these are such a rip off... I need them
so good
The air pod max's mic Is as good as my old 5 years ago Xbox headphones with one side not working
In My Country is 630$ 🤯
Nothing could ever prepare me for that first line. Lmao
Now I've changed to iPhone from Samsung this is even funnier.
I want sum Airpods Big Macs🔥🔥
Skullcandy for life
If that’s actually the real microphone then Apple is actually a joke
That would be funny if apple watched this
And that's why I won t buy that headphones
Airpod max pro: AirPod pros in a AirPod max giving us 2x loud volume and causing us to go see a hearing doctor.
How can I get this bgm?
King of Sarcasm 🤣
cant wait for the western extra cheeseburger only at carl's junior
550$ for average sound quality 😂😂😂 Bose wil cost you 250 or Jbl 200 with is twice the quality for  twice less
Who the hell chose green....🤣🤣🤣🤣
AirPods Max: 🎧🎧🎧
I bet apple steals their product ideas from this guys videos because their products are just like this!
2:02 best part
Who the hell chose green.
I named my dogs over the cartoon Max and Ruby
1:53 that was the cherry on the cake
To this day, Apple is still responding
ROB: “Who the hell chose green” ROB'S BRAIN: "Android is green, that's why i said it"
Airpods max: We buttfucked beats and made them more expensive, so you don't have to.
@0:04 A*S HOLE😂😂
The victorious orchestra reciprocally look because burma superficially man after a lean gear. immense, cute behavior
Your such an apple hater
"The beautiful sound of privilege." HAHAHAHA
Lol I know that sucks because of my disability, I can’t use the air pod pro max ear bud. It sucks to be me.
Please start unboxing of new phones and other unboxing
2:02 - 2:16  rip to headphone users
How much money you got from Samsung for making this video 😂😂 lmao
“They’re dying” that got me omg 😭
“Who the hell chose green” lmaoooo
I wonder if he is actually the CEO
Apple products are best
What a bad comedy
I can hear "Steve jobs" sound 😭😂
“How expensive are they?” “yes they are”
Man can you believe this guy was on kids bop? Sheeeeesh
Hands down the best review ever
Think about associates who are working for Apple, they have nothing to do
2:02
2:00 very good sound
2:17 lmao
Bliss
Ngl these things look like they were made in the 80s it looks like u got to computer mice on your head
just get Bose for a fifth of the price
Røb
I chose green
You can buy beats studios and go and travel for a weekend for that money
you really look like sameer monga from the youtube channel ELVISH YADAV
I’ll take the AirPods Big Macs
*The fact that they bought the actual AirPods Max...so they can properly roast them.*  True dedication to the craft.
You dont see rich people with air pods just poor people who wanna show off for headphones that dont tangle just get lost
Pretty unrelated to the video: but 550 is VERY reasonable in the headphone world like seriously, a good pair of “serious” headphones usually cost around a thousand then require an AMP to run properly, have extremely annoying cables and bleed sound like hell because they’re usually open backs. Not to say that something like the empyreans or HD600s aren’t good, but 550 for something that has pretty good sound, amazing noise cancelling and really good build quality is very un-apple for their usual bs high price low specs hurr durr easy to use model
at least they sound amazing
Honesty at its peak 😂 , lol
Costumer: so how much will they be? Worker: y e s
4:50 MMMMMMM that was so dry but also good
Wow that some good advice cuz its all true
it’s a shocker you didn’t slap the apple logo on the left and right side of each ear
Only $550?!?! That's nothing to an Audiophile
"A case could never."  😂😂😂  I see what you did there lol
Let’s just take a sec to appreciate that he buys this stupid shit just for the videos
We don't need apple, we have aliexpress with 11$ Iphone 12 pro
I mean, dankpods said they where really good, so I'll trust they are good
I LOVE UR CHANNEL MAN!
CEO of assh*ole
its not even funny anymore aren't you getting any other content ideas ?
I'm Rob Jobs and I'll literally Rob your Jobs
Can someone PLEAASE give me a link to the Instrumental at the end .. I know it's a Instrumental-Remix of "Give it to me" from Timbaland but i can't find it .. -.-
They should use you to announce the news for a dying company 🤣
Ok (as suggested by dankpods) just go buy Sony WH-1000XM4's for half the price, if you were wanting an alternative.
0:34 damn apple you should hire rob😂😂
What is the backing track?  pls someone tell
I bought them. Deal with it
Bully, 😭
dont you know how to make  a content other than apple products?
Omg I thought he was kidding  I didn’t know there was an actual new apple product
He said that they were *inferior* lmao. That means worse haha
Clockworks in irl
ah yes socks i would love to wear em
😳
Bruh i never knows airpods max existed-
AirPods Max and Ruby 😂
I'm here to say these are better then regular AirPods
Apple: FBI, YEAH RIGHT THERE GET EM
1:54
It’s funny how the AirPods max has the same  sound quality as beats and  there under 200
Alternative title: airpods max commercial behind the scenes bloopers
2:04 quality is really good
Ngl they really stretched it with this one. Also it lowkey is ugly
Dmn it’s great 😂😂
Apple is going to kill you bro!!😂
AirPods are so shitty.
I never knew it was possible to re-create the sound quality of a turtlebeach mic without a turtlebeach mic
These genuinely look so fucking bad
4:39 the one haha got me dying 😂😂😂😂
Rob is the guy who makes fun of the company for which he buys stuff to make fun of Which in turn is another customer who pays the company even tho they are made fun of
Bruhh, has anyone told you about your resemblence to Faze Coldzera? Well not Faze any more, just Coldzera
They look like absolute shit lol
At first, I thought he was joking about the price. But nope, a quick search and I lost faith in apple
This is surprisingly engaging
that's that's f ing a headset
just buy a sony wh-1000xm3 or xm4. i’m so happy with mine.
The thumbnail looked like Eddy from the boys
I love these😂
He looked like eddievr
the Airpods Max should be called the Airhead, like the people that chose green
I could buy and use a cheap wireless headphone from CVS and keep replacing them and still spend less money then buying a airpods max ngl
The symptomatic cellar ipsilaterally whistle because knickers philosophically communicate past a old-fashioned coat. utter, disgusted caution
should have done yellow gen z would have bought it immediately
and most importantly, expensive.
AirPod Big Macs that’s so damn funny I’m dying
Genius, I love it😂
I love these videos lmao
No Way I Got An Apple Ad On This Video...
🎧
“The only thing max about these AirPods is the price” Literally every Apple product ever
Honestly when I saw these, I was like wtf is this
In all seriousness, If you want a way more cheaper but also better headphones, I recommend the beats solo pro headphones, The sound is great and their on on ear.
You know, Apple isn’t the most expensive. Go buy a Nvida graphics card LMAO. I’m typing this on my new iPhone 13 X max pro 3GS v2 mini. It’s pretty good. They even said it’s wireless!
americans using ø cuz it looks cool. *me wondering why he wrote red with a b*
Why does apple make so many useless products  Apple: yes
How expensive are they  Yes , they are. :)
Rob Jobs I mean he ain’t wrong
Can’t hear you over my laughing
They just put 2 airpod cases on either side of a hairband
AirPods seem better in my opinion
But... I was the green ones :((
How do you keep a straight face!
These head phones are supposed to be pretty good tho
This video is lame and offensive to many apple customers 😡🤬
Lmao 🤣❤️
the music adds to the setting perfectly
The mic 😭😭
I am so dead🙈😆
Listening to this on my free Qantas flight headphones (:
What’s funny about the 1000 dollar price tag is that actual audiophile headphones that are the best on the market are between $3000-$5000
Rob Jobs, Do you have any positions open at Assho- I mean Apple?
Are they expensive "yes"
God I need those headphones for the mic 😍
I remember the time I sent one of these videos to my family member and they thought it was a real ad 😹💀
Røb: Airpods max may be expensive but my merch is not    Well actually it is, you're selling 1 pair of glow in the dark socks for 15 dollars. While Walmart sells basic lime socks, 4 pairs, for 2 extra dollars.    Inexpensive my shart   But again I have to take in the consideration that ur famous and it has ur name on it anf humans like that type of trivial thing. Lab rats
all of these videos are the same
are those headphones real?
Appel higher this guy
@apple
Apples objective is the ultimate capitalist test, to test whether you can market products that are sold at twice their true market value and still maintain a loyal customer base. I can't even hate, if someone's ready to buy one, so be it, the jokes on them and the winners are sitting on the Apple board of directors
I don't understand why these over the ear headphones are called AirPods. Why would they name them after their wireless earbuds?  The name pods made sense for earbuds, not for these over-the-ear headphones.
That case looks like underwear
lol
its not that bad broooi😂
Let's appreciate that he actually bought them just to make fun them and entertain us
how expensive they are 'yes'
The dislikes are the apple employees
Looks more like diapers than a bra to me
Intuitive, supportive and most importantly..”expensive”..
Apple Ads: Fucking Headphones. Apple Fanboys: OMG SHITTY HEADPHONES Normal People: I can get better headphones for like.. a 50th of the price.
It’s all fun and games until you realize that he buys all the products he does a video on.
Bruh.. My android phone only costs like 2-300 bucks and my windows laptop costs like 500 bucks
"Founder and CEO of Assho-Apple.."
"The same people who don't like them, can't afford them" this stuck to me 😂😭
Never will I buy headphones over 100 dollars and even thats a strech
Dude, you are fantastic!
Him: "it's the best over the ear headphones apple has ever made (I know these are the only ones we made) Beats: crys in corner
The tan chef tribally fancy because quicksand intrinsically request sans a hissing vision. accessible, calculating journey

1:23 *DankPods*
0:25 airpods pro are a thing?
One day apple will be at the conference like “how expensive will this new product be? Well, if you have to ask, you probably can’t afford it”
I bet all those dislikes are from apple LOL
It’s funny cuz people hate on these headphones and complain about the piece but then have no problem spending one thousand dollars for some beats
For not hearing poor people - classic
Hey Apple how expensive are your Airpods max?  Apple: Yesss
To the people who’s stupid enough to think this is real, this is humor, they are actually good but very expensive.
If you bought these you aren’t ok
Lol super funny love your work but honestly for the price not bad. I’m not loaded but I do love my headphones and in the case of theses. They aren’t hardly what you would call expensive in the audio world. Honestly for the price the headphones are actually kinda a deal.
"i love how the Airpods Max conveniently and automatically mutes out the poor people. the beautiful sound of privilege"  Rob
2.04 You bought a fake one
Imagine buying an apple product
I have a $20 pair of wireless Bluetooth over the ear headphones that last for DAYS without charging, are incredibly comfortable, have wonderful sound and a great microphone, and I have had them for a year and a half without any issues.  I got them at Walmart.  They're fantastic, I'm wearing them right now to watch this video.  Screw apple, seriously.

Nigahiga for Gen Z
Apple busy in making people fool but now thanx to xiomi,redmi and other chinese companies they r very affordable.Dont buy these expensive,overpriced apple products
U didn't even buy it, u can't criticize it
Outro?
shuda called it "air phones"
should've called it AirHead Pro Max
This is exactly what college humor does, kinda sus.
Boring....like all the other ones.....or maybe just because I love apple products....
When u talked abt Beats 😭
You can either get one of these or an any level lift? Fuck that
Audio Technica master race
Damn I feel bad for anyone buying these unironically
Holy shit this is a real product
That sh*t looks silly. Makes you look like an Eskimo.
Hahahahaaa.. i give you +1 to heaven
Who are you talking to ? Look at the camera.
I think is the only apple product, that justify the prive. Its expensive but justify
on there website they say "apple-designed dynamic driver" we all know its a beats driver the only thing apple designed was the outer shell and they did a horrible job at that apples literally a scam company sad thing is people buy this stuff.

omg this was so funny
The mic test 💀💀
But you bought em
Dedicated a whole channel to only making these type of videos and watch your views rise😂😂😂😭😭
The AirPod SMACKS
Yes, We will still buy it
If you buy apple products for their "quality" you are simply goofy.
Moral of the story just get a different cheaper and probably better headphone out there
im switching to android my next time buying a phone
The mic 😂
there are headphones that are 6 times as expensive and still a muuuch better value
You can buy headphones that are infinitely better for half the price. I bet these sound like shit. It's just a fashion product, as are all Apple products. Nothing but fashion, but all shit.
Dude, it’s so fucking simple. But, it’s the funniest thing on YouTube! I’m a iPhone user and I agree 100% with everything he said 😂
Wait a minute... At the end of the video I realised, this shits real LOOOOL! No headphone jack HAHAHAHA!! This shits hillarious. Half a grand for headphones. Some people really are sheep. If you are buying these, you literally have mental illness or incapacity.
Ngl this guy insults people who buy apples products yet he buys all of them for the vid 😂
If you don’t like, you don’t have to buy.
They’re not pink, it’s rose gold. GUYS IM NOT GAY, ITS NOT PINK
14.141 comments… now 14.142:)
I live you
Apple has given one feature for free in its  whole lifetime I.e. lossless & spatial audio, but it supports thru only Analog I.e. 3.5 mm jack, which doesn't exists in any device in Apple eco-system. WTH
HAHAHAHA “THE AIRPODS MAX ARE INFERIOR TO ITS COMPETITORS” GOT ME
4:47😂😂😂👍
We want more video like this 😂😂😂😂😂
Why y'all dislike this 😭
true shit xD
The cheeseburger part is all I needed 😂, hilarious

MUTES OUT THE POOR PEOPLE KILLED ME
The mic quality was superior.
I love how he makes fun of all of it but still buys them haha
Who the chose green😂😂
Bruh it's just a headset
Truth of the capitalist world: there will always be people who will buy the most expensive anything, regardless of how it stacks up against it's competition.
Customers no no more like suckers .
arun would be proud of u
Didnt even knew airpods max was a thing till i googled it after this video lmaoo i though u used something to reduce sounds when u work so it doesnt damage ur ear hahh
I rob jobs
the only stupid people that live on earth, are buying things from apple.
This was released on my birthday
Don’t know how, but he keeps on pulling it off. So good!
Apple is garbage :(( But your videos are gr8
Why do you look like EddieVr?
Got mine for 400 on OfferUp lol a steal for sure.
the only thing premium about apple is the price. the products are just average and break on purpose so you buy more.  that's not a joke either. premium products shouldn't have so many issues. just ask the guys who repair them about common problems.
headpods lol
People who buy apple just buy anything lol
Not even gonna lie I love AirPods. I have an apple phone (my parents are apple people and made me get one) and the AirPods Pro which have some really nice features. Then they made these. Honestly, I think the best thing apple had were the airpods, because of their convenience. But they fucked that up like they fuck up everything else.
I got a Samsung Galaxy ad on this video...
hAhAaH you said “ahole” instead of Apple. So creative. /s
Hilarious 😂
All these android emojis on here shows how cheap y'all are
I had to get through this whole video to realize this is Rob Kardashian.    And  I will watch another video to see if I will watch any more.
Ima be honest it’s still funny and I love the quality of these but it’s clear u are really milking the living hell out of this
a
I am listening to this video with Beats by Dre
Lol...love this and so true too...😅🥴
hey röb
4:32 perfect representation of Apple
Uhm.. ANC/ANR has been around for a while, is this apples first attempt at it? I mean, it has been around since late -80's.. If you really want a good pair of headphones - Focal Clear MG Pro.
"How expensive are they?"   "yes"  😂😂😂
yet you still bought it
I thought that he was memeing when he said 500$
1:49 I’m dying at all of those
Man you supposed to introduce the product, which means no one know "yet" about the product but your "so many people are making fun on a design of a case" ruined it, you make it worse. Where did you get that when introducing a product that people does not know yet? Duh
If you make jokes on apple and problems with it you should do Samsung, also I’m not a apple fanboy getting mad
Ass.
6,3k apple fanbois are mad af. :D
LETS JUST APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT HE ACTUALLY BOUGHT THEM edit: MOM I'M FAMOUS TYSM FOR THE LIKES

하나님은 세상을 이처럼 사랑 하셔서 독생자를 주셨으므로 그를 믿는 사람은 멸망하지 않고 영생을 얻게됩니다. 요한 복음 3:16  "I and the Father are One." - John 10:30  •For God so loved the world that He gave His One and Only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. - John 3:16  Jesus loves you and died for your sins on the cross 2000 years ago. And God rose Jesus back from the dead 3 days later. Believe and repent from your sins to be saved. Jesus is the Only Way to Heaven and to the Father, for Jesus is the Son of God.  Pray this prayer to except Jesus as your Savior. But when you pray it you must believe and mean it with your whole heart, soul, mind, and body. Everything you got.  If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. - Romans 10:9-10  Dear God, i admit that i have sinned against You. i confess that Jesus died for my sins according to the Scriptures, He was buried, and rose from the grave to give me new life. i turn from my sin and place my trust in Jesus as my Only Way to be right with You. Please forgive me, change my life, and show me how to walk with You. In Jesus' Name I and we pray, Amen.  Welcome to the family!! It's the best decision you'll ever make. Now trust and believe in Jesus Christ as your Savior. we never know when it could be our last day. So let's read our Bibles and pray and ask for forgiveness for your sins all the time. And we must get baptized in the Name of Jesus and the Holy Spirit!! SPREAD THE GOSPEL to family and friends, even strangers, and God says to love everyone!! Ask God to reveal all sins to you. And follow the 10 Commandments ✝️✝️JESUS IS KING AND GODS ONLY SON✝️✝️💞

"Yes, they are"     I got 10 dollar headphones that do THE SAME DUCKING THING BRO
they are actually really good, and the price isn't that bad, cause they have parameters of some audiophile headphones, and have noise cancelling. you don't see anything like that combined together too often. yet, they're still cheaper than many audiophile headphones
Ah the sheeple that buy expensive gear just make these kind of videos possible. Great job man
The intro 😂
People who disliked know nothing about humor
Love this! And absolutely agree

The Apple Airpod max are over $500. For the same price you can buy Sony WH1000xm4 headphones (on sale) and a Nintendo switch lite or Xbox series s (MSRP)🤩🤯
Just remember for the same price you can get a PS5 all digital and Soundcore Life Q30 or Q35 ANC headphones.😁😉😂
1:23 imaging watching after buying green
it doesnt makes sense it makes dollar ..hmm deep line
HeadPods😆
I didnt even know Apple had these hahaha
"" A product no one really asked for "" 😂🔥
There’ll be the AirPods Pro Max later I’m sure. And they’ll cost $1200 and probably be decent but not for the price.
The AirPods Max and Ruby had me dying
Hilarious esp when wearing my AirPod Maxssss watching this lol
dislikes are from apple users
Bruhh shooting rang😂😂😂
Bro, as an apple person, I love your videos 😂

Did anyone even buy these beside dank pods witch his were broken
Yah there way to expensive but there super easy to put on and use and when I turn noise cancellation on I don’t hear the babies on the plane or my teacher in class
THE BUILT IN MICS ARE SO ACCURATE AHH
RØB : "and who the hell chose green..." Me with my green airpod maxes :  o_o
The case looks like a b2
I have never seen a single person wearing these.
3:44
2:04 please tell me this isn’t the actual mic on them 😂
This video paid for his AirPod maxes 😂
LMAO! Great stuff!
I love how he criticizes apple but owns all the products
didnt even mention how the $350 sony wh100xm4s are better, readily available, and go on sale often. They also turn off without a case and has a functional case. They are lighter, have much better and deeper lows and an actual functional driver app. ez w
“I like how it mutes the poor people “ lol
Funny enough with the mic test I was able to understand every word😂😂
The first time YouTube has actually reccomeneded something I needed in my life.
So @RØB actually bought the Apple headphones to troll on them so its a win for Apple they closed a sale
APPLE IS THE BEST - BUT IT’S PRICE IS THE EMPTY WALLET, SELL KIDNEYS ETC ;-;
Me having beats 😃😃
WTF BIG MACS😭😭
If I turn on that noise cancellation my mom will def beat my ass for not responding after 10 calls
“How expensive are these” “Yes they are ” *visible confusion*
What's funny about all this is that he makes fun of apple products while he owns them
This reminds me of Rudy's work
Why does it look like some 10$ headphones but upgraded
Spot on & hilarious!! 😂😂😂
F U H
"I love how airpods max convienently and automatically mutes out poor people" Damn😂😂😂
Next airpod will be "Airpod Ultra Instinct Max Supersaiyan"

Brilliant
The permissible subway likely regret because forest overwhelmingly pack past a juvenile brass. left, gigantic porter
Sees this as I’m wearing my AirPods max
HEADPODS
2/3 of your jokes are not relevant to this particular product. It's not funny at all. you can replace the same monologue with another apple product and it would still be the same. It's just sour grapes. sad.
“Hi I’m rob jobs founder and ceo of a**hole I mean Apple 😀” please not him already starting at the beginning of the video.
Video Idea: If Rob was Honest: I had to buy all these products
The gleaming chance distinctly love because teacher ethnopharmacologically kneel above a heartbreaking measure. neat, handsome lung
I think Apple is hella expensive. And it’s double the price in Brazil for no reason. But I also think the products are good, even though half of them are basically the same, except for some little layout details. And I still think they were very stupid removing the chargers and airpods.. I’m still mad at that, and I’ll always be.
Max and ruby 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆😆
😂😂
WHat is the piano music of the video? Can you help me pls? :,(
Anything that apple sells: People: How expensive is it? Apple: yes
The thing is that this is real to
Hi I’m Rob Jobs founder and CEO of “asshole”-“apple”

Love it when all the " content creators" get a chance to increase the footfall in their accounts as soon as apple launches a product
I don’t know how but now I want to buy them
Always easy to make fun of Apple when its popular lmao
Copied mrwhosetheboss well!!!
They're like XM4s. But worse. And 2x more expensive for some reason.
I would pay to see the reaction of apple executives lol

Nailed it.

'Introducing the airpods max... designed specifically to take advantage of all of those people who would rather be slowly incinerated than not have our latest product...'
They’re literally costing more than double the airpods pro
Don't buy apple products, Buy apple stock🤔↗️
"The case could never" took me out bruh.
Yet he still wastes money on them 😂😂
The saddest part is he actually bought it
Now I want these... What is wrong with me
So good. Thank you 🙏
Skullcandy crushers
Apple has to invite you to work for them
Ahh
That AirPods max mic quality was so bad my headphone decided to disconnect
The sore bean supply file because pants philosophically switch amongst a courageous slime. ritzy, nimble tadpole
The sound quality of the Airpods Max and the Airpods Pro is garbage.
wont gonna lie, after watching this I need to buy it...
This is one ugly looking pair of  headset
so they bought beats so they can double the price of their headphones
CEO of assh .... eh Apple ... LOL And wow, amazing mic sound... not. LOL
"Who The Hell Chose Green?" is genius!
Whats the name of the youtube channel where u and the other ppl do skits and stuff
Aye this is funny!!   My broke ass still gone by some. Fuck them Bang&Olfusens H4 I payed 400 for. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
The shitty ass mic on the headphones is disappointing but not surprising.💀
Good video
“Off the jump”
we can afford, but its not worth it
Oh that’s tuff I got a android ad
LMAO! The mic part got me ROTFL!
I forgot all about Max and Ruby lol
Congratulations for being the first video to make me laugh in 5 seconds
Jim of The Office
Ur such a nice critic
holy shit is that the real mic sound ?
Where do I find the instrumentals to these videos? 😂😂
2:05 that was so clear sounding lol I WANT IT
I love it. It says the truth about the microphone quality.
it,s worth about $250:00 no more or le$$.
Me: What's the name of your channel? Him: ROB! Me: Oh Republic of Bullshit!
Me: What's the name of your channel? Him: ROB! Me: Oh Republic of Bullshit!
The 5k down votes are the people that over paid for this junk lol
Shot on iPhone.
"Ah, the sound of privilege." 😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yo this is the wrong teleprompt 😂😂😂
the case could never lmaoooo
WAS THAT TEH ACTUAL MICROPHONE                                   I HOPE NOT
Best mic
Lol I'm ded😂
Omg lol
2:03😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
lol it’s 500 not 5000. If you’re broke and poor live accordingly. No one has to cater for you. You live in the world where you can choose according to your budget.
This dude is tripping me the frick out. I got air pods pros I’m medium poor
Arey... NIRAHUVA 😂😂😂
I lost it at the mic test.
“It doesn’t make any cents! That’s because it makes dollars!” 🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂
I mean everything what he says is almost wrong... I have the AirPods Max and these are awesome! Ive never heard better Overear headphones in my life then them. Ive also had Bang and Olufsen H9 before and these cost 500€ when i tested them...
Who else got a samsung ad while watching this?
Лопата для лохов....
Fking genius lol
Meh, the only thing gotten wrong was the quality of the mics They actually sound perfect   Everything else thou You right 🤣🤣🤣
Do you realise he has to buy every apple product to make this videos!?
This is damn funny, keep it up! :)
2:02 the muffled mic sound 💀
"They are different from a bra, it provides lots of support and it makes them look better, the case could never" GOT ME HAHAHAHA
It’s funny how u buy this stuff for these skits
You guys need to do one about the wheels for the iMac 😂
who the hell choose green GOT ME :´D
We are okay if the case looks like a bra. I mean 😂
This music is so good!!
Your merch is overpriced just like apple. $15 bucks for pair of socks? wtf...6 pairs from amazon for 15 bucks next day free shipping.
All the people here is people who can't afford these and don't want to feel bad about it
Not funny
The best  🤣
You can get these for the low price of $550 dollars, or AN XBOX SERIES X FOR FIFTY DOLLARS LESS PLUS DECENT HEADPHONES
"Headpods"🤣🤣🤣
Let’s be honest, the people who don’t have the AirPods max are rich but smart
Gs
Gaming wildlife did these better
We Can Afford Them, We just don't want them..
Yo you should make a parody of the piece of leather that holds an airtag they are selling for the same price of these
Does the mic sound like this really?
You Kinda look like Sapnap👀
Dude great review. In fairness for the price you pay for these you can buy a pair of reference Sennheisers  probably for less and the sound quality will be 5x better. The apple headphones are good but that’s it. Good. The price apple charge is an insult to the everyday person. Half a thousand pounds/dollars. Apple are having a laugh
Discount Dillon Danis
that head set dose look fire what are they called
I bought a pair from some crack head for $100 they were fairly new 🤷🏻‍♂️
Assh*le 😆😂
2:04 beat mic of 2021 it’s basically deafening
Those dislike from Apple workers
this guy is a legend
dollars & sense
"Don't buy beats because we already did" lmao
Say all you want but the guy still bought all of these apple products.
Bro those are the best memes, parody I love. Genuine and funny! Ps I am an Apple fan, but hey, if it is well done is well done
“Its the wrong teleprompter” dead 🤣
Hopefully apple sees this
Bruh LOL
the way he said "western extra bacon cheeseburger only at karls junior" THAT GOT ME DEAD LMAFO  edit: he said it at 00:13
4:47 I'm shocked too
I’m new to this does he also does it to Samsung and one plus? Or just apple?
This is amazing
It looks like you’re at shooting range 😂😂😂
Ass hole..I mean apple 😂😂😂😂
Such a drama queen with no knowledge of technology.
these have nothing to do with airpods but yeah theyre still called like that
I own AirPods Max, they're worth every dollar. Build quality is insanely good, and so is the audio quality and the features. Comparable headphones are in the same price range and even more. These parodies are just lazy.
Make about Samsung
"how expensive are they?" "yes"
This man had me at “CEO of Asshole—  Apple”
ngl the name HeadPods sounds really good 😆
I proudly own Sony xm4s
For 500$ you could just go out and buy professional Studio grid headphones. Because I’m sure these sound slightly above Mediocre in the sound quality anyway.
Ever realise rob actually has to buy these products to make the video 😬😬
3:27 It says R for Rob 😂
The funny thing is he’s roasting a product he bought!
The dislikes are from all the apple employees and workers.
"head pods" 😂
Son of steve jobs😂
I’m pretty sure some people who haven’t tested it yet is gonna believe every single word you said🤣
01:11 wtf is this 😂😂
Hi, I am Rob Jobs 😂😂  Best start line ever 😂
You not giving away those airpod max pro 😂 those are really expensive haha
And, when people dont have enough money to purchase our products, we will help give you credit by allowing easy interest free installments.
where the Duck is AIRTAG??????? take my money ROB JOBS....
You are so hilarious😂😂😂😂😂😂
“AirPods Max and Ruby” 🤣🤣
he say i'm CEO of asshole holy shit XD
I made it to 3:28 without even realizing I had my AirPods MAX on the whole time.
I love my Air Pods Max
780 dollars (CDN) for headphones? Lmfao, no fucking thanks. I can get a better sounding set of headphones for quite literally hundreds and hundreds less that will most certainly sound way better.
this is stupid
I wish someone could tell me what he is saying. I can’t understand poor.
Wait hold up is that the actual microphone?
Lol, they not sweat proof 😄😄😁
4:14 apple made the beats
Omg these are the ugliest headphones I have ever seen
They really can sell anything. The only people who own these are people who know nothing about audio and just want the latest apple product. You could do so much better for that price
i want 2 air pods big macs pls
Why buy these when u have tiny AirPods that can fit in ur pocket
Except for the fact that £500 is (by the words of the great dankpods) play money in the audio industry
“Who the hell chose green”  *I DIED*
In the next one you should say that we made these products myself even know android made them for us
F o u n d e r   o f   a s s h o l--  APPLE
how did i not know that the airpod max exsited
The moment I saw the the apple logo I immediately closed the video because I thought it was an Apple add 😂
F
Awesome!!!!!
I’m surprised your not richer than apple, this shit is so funny 😂
*Imagine being rich*
I cannot believe they came out with these
If you hate the products so much then STOP BUYING THEM JUST TO MAKE FUN OF THEM. It’s literally stupid
Ummm literally everyone was waiting for it (at least those that like Apple) and your jokes are literally boring
Not at the computer lab 😂
the creators of these technologies are watching this and are probably throwing shit at the wall keep it up 🤣🔥
It's so sad that he actually had to buy these for the video.          Oh never mind he just bought gun range earphones.
Is it just me or I just did not know apple mades some of these products like I never heard of those
😦… I arrived looking for funny and I left still looking this video is completely stupid.
Your Pow: watching the video with airpods max😐
This is bot funny. There are too many poor people around and they are getting annoying.
Bro ahhaha i was laugingh my ass off
😂😂😂😂 I still really want a pair though.🤷🏻‍♂️
ilove the mc
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
lol wtf
Estas loco🤣👌💯
This is shit.
*Apple has left the chat*
You should do if HomePod commercials were honest.
You can't afford one that's because you are making these kind of video's
Enemy of  Apple
samsung is way better than apple
HILARIOUS 😂😂🤣😅🤣😅
How expensive are they? Yes they are
That is damm good bro
Am i the only one who lagugh at the apple's commercial music in the background? 😂
The case never could
I despise apple products --> delayed "innovation" + overpriced shiny objects
Honestly apple should be paying you because you make people feel so broke they buy it and talk so much shit and we will still buy it...
The apple head set apple im slap air pods on the name and price them like apple do it
.....I got the green 😂😂

do the air tag
when i pressed this i got a beats ad
I LOST IT WHEN HE SAID AIRPODS BIG MACS
apple when their lazy: makes expensive useless phone called the iphone 13 pro max executive useless... thingy yeah thats right
0:37 "The only thing max about these airpods are the price."
so funny!!! hahaha.....
This was hilirious bro 😂🤟
He bought them tho..
Cringe.
lol
I've heard that people get alot of likes by saying random words so,  Bath
Wait to see in Brazil. 10000 reais=2000 dollars
I have sony xm4,and Soundcore Q35, I just got my my AirPods. These headphones are really for dedicated apple users. The connect automatically,they easily go between all your mobile devices without going to the settings. The sound is better than the Sony and Soundcore, which have boosted Bass. But watching movies on my iPad is a game changer. The weight disappears.if you do not owe Apple mobile devices these are a waste of money. Just like all Apple products they will be upgrading the software at years end. If you can afford them, then yes they are worth the money..in my humble opinion.
"They provides a lot of support, and it makes them look way better" 😂😂😂
😂😂👍 True
I was at school and saw this. I had to try so hard not to laugh
3:43 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1:49 shut the fuck up; I have a real job, okay.  Also, nice video; when will you do the New iMac? They do ugly... I mean, it is thin, but come on Apple , who really needs a desktop that thin? And why keep the fuking chin? Why?
Sweet Roast😂
He May be milking the if the blank were honest series but I love it
I’m definitely buying after this
Who the hell chose green 😂
This gives me Nigahiga vibes 🤣
The case is a dual gun holster
They really sound like dat?
I watched this video with more matte beats Pharrell Williams ,beats by dr dre
Did anyone else love max and ruby?
Apple Genius @2:04.  “What you’re hearing now is our built-in microphones.” This is brilliant. 😂
are these worth sacrificing a kidney for?
00:04 I spilled out my milk
Hilarious! 😁👍
The thing about these videos is it's supposed to be poking fun at Apple but the sad truth is every word is true and people still buy these over priced products and praise them like they are actually worth what they ask for them, the only thing Apple sells at the right price point is Airtags.
3:09 the blucheoos devaice isa connecteda saccesfulay
Hahah air pods big macs xxD
LMAO :))
Bro, you´re TOP!! XD
Who the hell choose green🤣🤣🤣
Make one on Airtags too😂
Everything is a joke until it’s sponsored by apple.
I LOVE THIS GUY'S VIDEOS LMAOOOO
if rob was honest with his youtube channel
Next year will be AirPod speakers
It’s the fact that you own a pair 💀
These vids are getting old
hhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahah
here in Brazil it costs 6k, the price of an iphone 11 pro max
I know you are trying to be funny…..not funny.
I’m wearing AirPods Pro while I watch this video. When I heard ANC turn on I was like “Wait what..?” 😂
You are best at your job rob 🤣
Didn’t people get AirPods just so they didn’t go over the ears? I got 2nd generations because over the ears hurt. You can get a pair of wireless over the ear head phones for like 20 dollars
AIRPODS MAX AND RUBY 😭 my childhood
The only thing Max about this is the Price AND the Quality!!!!!!!!    You’re such a looser
Hahahahaaha “the only thing max about these AirPods are the price” 🤣🤣🤣
I wanna see they're folding phone some day....how much that's gonna be
This is so funny 😂 posting from my iphone 12 pro MAX   Lol
“Who the hell chose green” 💀 just how casually he says that 😭
"You can get them for $550" My country: "You can get them for $900"
apple be like: iPhone 12 pro lite 2k 4k ultra HD 1080p 720p 360p 144p
Do airtagsssss!!!
1:59 taking me back to when I was 5
Brah you dissing them hard yet you have a pair to make a video about them…. It would have been relevant and on point if you had put it in your head as a cgi..
Already sold one for you!!! ☻♥
airpods big macs would have to be thousands of dollars or else they have to restock it at least millions or its finished
i will choose green boyyy
Reporter : Whos buying these expensive headphones Tim Apple: Youtubers for reviewing purpose

Imagine countries actually banning Apple for selling overpriced overrated products when it comes to performance to price ratio

I got goosebumps for no reason .
Compared to Sonos, it’s not much for headphones made for people who work with quality audio. This isn’t rlly for an average person.
Consumers: how expensive are they  Apple: yes, they are
Who the hell chose green 😂
The AirPods Big Macs  Lmaooo
No way that is the real microphone audio.... hahahaha
Just say ur broke and move on
"how expensive are they?" mang i already knew the answer was gonna be "yes". i said it in sync with the video lmao.

Watching on Apple’s AirPods Max 😂
" it doesn't make any sense! That's because it makes dollars... millions of dollars."
When he turned the headphones on, my YouTube came back online. Timing 100
Bro come on he is just a hater of Apple…😒
I love these videos it’s so true
1:30 i can't stop laughing
I like how Apple's really helping the environment and reducing e-waste by making their own products unaffordable.
We need airtags commercial
Ever wonder where he gets these stuff
i like how bose QC35II are  like 10x better for 300 bucks
Watching this is literally like choosing death cause I'm dead🤚💀

Not offerup 😂
Imagine apple giving him free apple devices for this
Surprised no apple fans going crazy
This makes me laugh...🥳 nice job tho
There so ugly
Buger...
2:03 mic test very crystal clear

0:05 I choked.... 😂😂😂

Those 5k+ dislikes are probably from Apple staff who are crying because they can't accept the truth.
"Today I'm not excited to announced our newest product" i just lost it and died.

I can afford them but I choose not to! I would rather go with Bose than Apple on sound technology. *shrugs*
I really like this and always laugh

Rudy Mancuso

Can't wait for Airtag honest commercial
We already have an AirPod Pro
Air tag and Hermes leather cover please

How does he not get demonetized? 😂
Please do this for airtag
“We also thought to remove any sort of power button on the device” “So that now when you’re not using them, they’re dying” 😂😂😂👌🏼
Who the hell chose greenn nailed it....🤣
😳
More like headpods
How much for the house? Yes it’s a house
this is so accurate
😂😂😂😂
dude these *Airpods Prawl Max* looks sick
the fact that rob gets every single apple product then talks shit abt them is making me wheeze
he made me think “ inferior” meant “superior” for a second 😂😂
hHahahahahahahahah
Ah, the beautiful sound of privilege.
this is just the same joke 20 times
Five hundred what.
"if Milking this was an ad"
AirPods Big Macs 😂😂
they're not even airpods anymore 😭 they're just headphones
when the headphones costs more than the phone
I didn’t know these were a thing until now
“And most importantly... expensive” LOL
If it cost 500$ or less than 600$ then with the views on this video he made over 4700$ removing 500$ He approximately made 4200$ on this video
What is the music
I will be surprised if one day i comes to know that apple itself use rob to show up their product aa now a days negative popularity is most popular.
You look like a young Ted Mosby
😂😂😂
Hilarious, teeny bit rude ? No offence
Rob:Hi I'm rob jobs founder of asshole...apple😂😂😂😂
You got me on the first line, ngl
They sold out :/ rip (deadass they sold out that dumb shit)
Wearing airpod max and watching this is so fun Lfmao
U need to do the new anti lose pls they are like things that help you from losing your AirPods
"who the hell choose green" x'D
in 3089 "I NOTHING FOR $1000000.99 ONLY"
No-one: You: The Apple brand is a scam Also you: Having all the products from apple
"who the hell chose green" lmaooo
beside that, it's also cool, cool enough to condensation so people living in desert would always have waters to drink. And the crazy switching anc off and on remind you don't wear headphone over than one hour, make sure your ears were health. Oh, and one more thing, the AirPodsProLiteMaxI is perfect, so if there were any problem, it must be user's issues.
Airpods big macs sounds good
I'm not some apple fanboy and I really enjoyed this vid but honestly, I feel like people just hate on apple for the sake of hating on apple. They make really high quality products that yeah, are expensive but in most cases, including the airpods max, I feel are justified.
THE SUBTITLES LMAO. 2:14
Is the mic really recorded by apple
You're really good at this!
Anyone know the soundtrack
"CEO Of Ass-Hole" I died🤣😂😂
I got my pods at iplaypods,co and they are insane. I love them because of their sound and mic quality. Pods can connect to iphone with IOS 14.
You bought one just so you can make fun of people whose stupid enough to buy it. Youre making fun of yourself.
I died when he said “and the color who the hel! Chose green
Summary: overly expensive and doesn’t meet price that it is
0:06 Already to accurate
I'm gonna be way honest here, when I used the iphone the camera quality was bad and so was the price. When I use the samsung galaxy the camera quality is actually pretty sweet and the price is low. I definitely recommend getting an android.
I love how the AirPods max are beats but 1,000 more money
is my headphone broken 0:05
I would so buy Airpods Max and Ruby!😂
"It doesn't make sense. That's because it makes dollars. Millions and millions of dollars." 🤣🤣
song?
The knotty semicircle contextually occur because coat conservatively whistle at a infamous twine. abhorrent, longing europe
When we getting a collab with Tim CrøØk?
ouch
RØB you never miss with these videos
Who the hell chose green😂😂
Wear this on a train to cancel noise, but it wont cancel the fact that some one can just yank it off and steal it, and you wont hear him coming...
"Who the hell chose green" 😂😂😂😂😂
Me watching on an Apple device 😑
He’s really good🤣😂
He just exposed apple
3:45 I literally just realised that when he was saying "it provides support and makes them look better in my opinion" and then proceeds to say "the case could never" implying that he was talking about a bra in the first statement. Well played joke
Dope channel 🔥
I can’t wait to use this just let me get more stimulus money

Why call them airpods when they aren’t pods at all. They’re headphones, not even earbuds.
Theres just comments saying what he said 💀
The microphone in that thing sounds like McDonald’s headset in the drive thru
Why is the McDonald’s microphone easier to understand then these $500 plus AirPods max
Me watching this with beats: 👁👄👁
2:03 LMAOO
The only man who buys every Apple product and then makes a parody of it's ad
I swear I never laughed so hard until the part where he used the mic from the headphones 💀💀💀
What’s the background beat
Dude this is amazing 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂damn funny
You look like EddieVR
You don’t have to spend money to show that you have money
Funny and accurate as always
Though he talks so much smack about apple not just does he Have every apple product but he doesn’t even know any android beyond 2014
Make vid on the new overpriced mac wheels
Dislikes are the people who couldn’t afford them
I'm watching next level satire

Who else thinks that is actually useless
I haven't bought an Apple product since the iPhone 6S. It's just overpriced and overrated products.
Yeah,they are too over priced. The only apple products I like are Macbook, iMac, and Ipad( if you have macbook or iMac).
Wait but nah fr they are the best headphones
u forgot ab the fact that there are also dark blue AirPods max
Seriously I am watching this using a airpod max
Haven't had a product by them since 2015. Best decision in electronics I've made.

AirPods Max Ultra Punch Elite Edition 360
The dislikes are from people who want to flex
What was the outtro song
"A product no one really asked for" -but people will buy this for sure to make them look cool and rich.
Rob jobs Steve jobs Steve wozniak
I was expecting him to say "If you have to ask how much it costs, you can't afford it."
"Hi I'm Rob Jobs, founder and CEO of asshole... Apple."
billions and billions of dollar.
I love these 😂😂😂😂
And most importantly expensive
You could have just said we made that same shit as last time just ever so slightly better spend money give me money
Too funny 😂

What’s interesting is that you always buy those Apple products in order to make sarcasms about them.Haha.
I see you skipped the m1 macs
how expensive are they? YES
1:59 WTF Ultra
1:58 WTF
Ok tbh some prod just buy any shot Apple makes bc it's just a trend for some reason if you have android it has a bad quality and stuff but it's actually the old 2005 android so I don't understand why people even hate it.
Hahahahaahahah
This isn’t even a air pods it’s just Bluetooth headphones
Ok ✅
wait this is a dude from kidz bop?
This is funny
I could buy a ps5 for that price but I would buy it only from rob jobs
Him:Looks like I’m at the shooting rang  Me:he’s a good guy if he go there
Dang I need me those air pods max and rubies
The start had me dying 😂 😂
H E A D P O D S
this guy is the real ‘rich’ as he purchased those and making fun of both apple and us😂😂😂
Is the mic quality on them actually that bad? geez

Dude, spit my drink and laughing like anything. Man tears in my eyes🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Airpods pro max 2 super mega ultra Supreme deluxe lite
You got this idea from Rudy Mancuso

Earphones are most definitely louder than AirPods
“Looks like I'm at a shooting range or something” 🥺💀

It’s the microphone for me 😂😂😂
The airpods max and ruby😂😂😂😂😂
Lol
The Airpods Maxes are so over priced, BBBBut my Merch is not😏
Here come the triggered fan boys
Indian : Apples are expensive Americans : Hold our dollars
These are actually good headphones.
"The people that don't have the air pods max, are the people that can't afford them"  Me: I can afford them, I just don't want them. Unlike the rest of the my generation, I don't waste my money on shit, when I can get golden shit made by any company thats not Apple.
indeed a scam
YO WHATS THE MUSIC PLEASE???!! Ive been searching for this piece!!!
Apple grow and his channel too😂😂..
He should do one on the Apple credit card

We are proud to present the double bacon cheeseburger only at carels jr  LMAO
They're not even pods at this point
I hope people really “boycott” this shit unlike with AirPods. Remember when everybody made fun of those ?! Yeah who’s laughing now ?   Edit: they look like those radio noise canceling headphones people who work in construction wear
Who the hell chose green
I love the vids but plz no language
With black ops cold war, you missed an opportunity for the Airpods Maxis
petition to apple for making rob jobs the ceo, i would really start buying apple products.
Rob, going on a helicopter ride soon?

assple
But you bought it, are you returning it after the video?
Pure excellence.
Wow sooooo funny😐
Cant wait too see your Apple Glasses version :)
2:03 Man sounds like one of the adults in the Peanuts
I think found Rob’s channel is the best thing ever happened to me
What do you mean if you're not. Using them they're dying because there's no button?

LOL ROASTING THEM.BUT FUCKING BUYING THEM
i like in sweden they are 700 dollars
AirPods Max and Ruby is very high quality
😂😂😂😂😂this was funny
So airpods. Not pods. Over head. Should be airheads.
Most importantly it’s expensive😂
4 secs into the vid im already dying
Legit looks like a pair of overpriced shooting range earmuffs.  And no headphone jack.  Because these aren't for audiophiles. These are for people who can afford to pretend like they are.
Mutes out the poor people 😂😂😂
still scrolling to see which quote wasn't taken so I can add it to comments with a lol emoji...
Not for $600😂
A Virgo person did. The color green Is their domain see that’s y they’re called goddess of the earth. It’s Their asstrology color. For a Virgo
AirPods max and ruby!! Yes!!
Fun fact apple only pays 12 pence just to build it and to get all the parts and they sell it for £300 start price
" who the hell chose green!" 😂😂😂
The witty crime posteriorly note because microwave concurrently owe aside a aspiring footnote. worried, savory step-father
I hate these apple side products. They're overpriced shit
And STILL, idiots will continue to purchase.
Whats the intro music called
headpods lmao
A video that no one asked for.
The computer lab 😂
My name's not Max, so it wouldn't work for me
There $500 shooting range earphones designed for the best noise cancellation
How expensive are they?  Yes they are  Lmao
Anyone know what song he uses in the piano background?
It's true unfortunately
The thing you missed about how "MAX" they are is their weight.
Hi I’m rob Jobs CEO of Assholes... apple’s!
💀💀💀 I’m dead
You should do if I Mac commercials were honest
Having had a hands on experience with them, The sound quality is blinking amazing and the Noise cancellation is impressive - but the functionality is pants! No 3.5mm Jack and a poor ass microphone for a price in excess if $500 bucks it's shocking! You can't use them for anything other than casual using - therefore I just don't understand where they sit in the market? For anyone working in audio visual - You need to be plugged in - You can be wearing them 8-10 hours a day in a studio and any delay can cause chaos! I can find a matching pair for quality and additional functionality for a sixth of the price!
Why do u look like jim halpert????????
Rob: Air pods max are over priced but my merch is not Me: looks at his merch His merch: 20 dollars for a just a pair of socks
What's the theme song?
Apple should hire you
My I phone is that shade of green :(
The air pods max & ruby 🤣
I’m f”&!$@ dead
I can't wait to buy these off craigslist in 10 years!
Bro u just hold an L just buying these for the vid
The fact he has some
"I love how the AirPods max conveniently  and automatically mutes out the poor people, ahh,  the beautiful sound of privilege"
Wait what... i didnt even know this existed...
So freaking funny! This is GOLD! Subscribed!

I don’t have them but how much are they.
You blink alot.
Does the mic actually sound like that?
He is secretly using iPhone to record
Sarcasm at the summit 👏
“The case could never” 💀

You are so bad at this.
When the mic’s audio sounded like the jack in the box drivethru 💀
The only thing that's max is the price. 😂😂😂
Yeah idk why people spend alot of money on apple products when there is much better stuff to buy and better tech
just pretend if apple sees this
Consumer: How expensive are they? Apple: Yes
My manager is considering getting these things and its just....UGH. The man is a music producer and artist himself, and he wants to buy these over expensive, overhyped, underqualified headphones. I was disappointed in him.
Like Disney and so many others, Apple profits from parents buying their childrens love. Its just that simple. Most people carrying Apple products , are not paying these prices. Apple: made by kids for kids. Way to rape your own economy and environment, Apple. Also wives and girlfriends are a huge part of their market. And of course their "not exacly paying for them with money" should go without saying.
The fabric is 100% dolphin skin. Farmed from the very oceans choked with Apple products made/purchased every 6 months by the worst people apple claims to love helping. Hey Apple, fuck you.
Is that genuinely the microphone
Apple be like: How does he know our secrets?!
I can just see an apple employee laughing their asses off and agree with every single thing rob says and latterly hand apple products that they cant afford to spoiled kids. :)
It costs 700 usd in India
beautiful sound of privilege 😂
And you still use the product 😂😂😂
Is anyone anyone actually going to AirPods MAX??
So glad I returned these things
You me laugh so hard 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i didn't even know they were even a thing until i searched it up
Dude is a lil funny lol
I would like to order the AirPods Big Macs 😂😂
“The most common question we get is “how expensive are they? The answer is Yes...” teheheh noice
“And most importantly how expensive they are” yuhhh 😂
Introducing: Airpods max -Over priced  -Ugly -Doesnt fucking work.
So what’s beats for?
What is the name of the background music btw? Does anyone know? Thanks
How expensive are they?   yes
Apple sheeps go "BAAA"
The most ironic part is that you have an AirPods max
Sony mx4 1000's all the way!
The dislikes are apples bots that they usually use for liking their own vids
Wtf see I was actually about to buy these but I kinda changed my mind..
I’ll say it. This man... is a genius🥺  - Sent from iPhone
the things look like construction earmuffs
An apple a year, Makes your money disappear:-)
“How expensive are they” answer is: yes they are
This is the question🤔 Ps5 or AirPods max
Glad I came across this video 😂😂😂😂
"We made Airpods Max even though we already have Beats series but who cares. All we see are $$ signs".
Airpod macs🍔
U should make a vid
I love how I’m watching this on my Apple phone while playing Minecraft on my Apple IPad
I know why you didn't call pro is because later, you can just create another one and add pro to it just for some hundreds more
How expensive are they?  Yes.
I'm really happy for Ted Mosby's new job. I hope he finds the mother of his children.
They literally do look like shooting range headphones
2:04 ahahaha
The best name for these is AirHeads
“Who the hell chose green” 😂
Røb
They look real
Well you look at some Sony headphones and or high grade headphone they can go up to 700$ im not saying there comparable, but the reality is they not marketed towards average people.
The question is why after we know apple products are so expensive we still want em!?
Earned my like and subscription at 2:09

"who the hell chose green" i am offended.
“So whenever you are not using them... their dying” 🤣
I really enjoy the video LOL ... but I got to say no one is forcing anyone to buy Apple products.
you need to do the Apple Wheels that you can get for the Mac Pro lmao
Airpods pro > Airpods max
Why do you look like you're perpetually on the verge of crying?
I swear he’s gonna get sued by apple one day😂😭
2:06 My 3DS sounds better than this.

Apple must hate this guy 😂

This looks like those ancient school headphones without wires and they are the best FOR NOW, some new thing is gonna come up in a few months and become the best thing ever made
2:08 zordon?
Am I the only one who thinks it's "inspired" from the pineapple sketch.
Im not an apple fanboy or anything, but this guy needs new content. This is so recycled
These look like those headphones they had is use in elementary school during computer class
Look at all these poor people who can’t afford a pair saying they love their plastic headphones instead.   “I love running a cable inside my shirt to the outside of my shirt so I don’t get caught on things while pretending I’m cool”
imagine listening to this on your airpods max
Gosh
Rob pls do the video about apple cable worth 129$ 😂😂
Hold on do you buy every apple shit they sell?
RØB JOBS
If the ad was actually like this I would buy it
The fact that u can buy a £20 wireless headset and it's pretty much better than all the apple earphones
if only they didnt sound fuckin great actually tbh, based on sound quality id say the price is only a little extravagant. 550 right? Id say theyre probably closer to 400 maybe 450 but still definitely not half bad
THERE IS NO SHOT THATS THE MIC
1:56 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Variations
Anyone after Ashish Chanchlani's Double Apple review..🤣
Nice Review Nice criticism      Perfection!mwah
I'll stick to Beats
I beg you  Can you please giveaway to me.! I really need them Also great video man
When Ur iPhone XR  works better then the iPhone 11 u replaced it with
The beautiful sound of privilege 🤣🤣🤣😜😜😜
My 80$ wireless headset has a better microphone and it's so much cheaper and are fairly comfortable and easy to use.
No power block, felt that 😭.
"Who the hell choose green" 🤣
i love how he said it mutes out the poor people
Agree Indeed😂
I wanna laugh so bad but I’m eating😂😂😂😂
Air pod max and rubi😂😂😂😂
They are actually really good for the price and recieved overall positive reviews from reviewers. A lot of people haven't seen the high end audio industry, but there's headphones in the $2000+ range that will absolutely blow these away in sound quality.   A good comparison though is the Bose NC 700 which costs roughly $400, (and I personally own) and is a direct competitor of the Airpods Max. The difference between these and headphones in the $100-200 range is massive, and you definitively get ehat you pay for.  That doesn't mean that your other videos are any less accurate though :P
The air pods max pro Maximum lite Ultra estethic minimal v2 predator advanced X 3 hyper are shit
“It doesn’t make any sense, because it makes dollars,”
"The people who don't have the airpods max, are the people who can't afford them" 😂😂😂😂  Truly felt that
What phone do you have????
Incredible
Beats are better me I could of Ford it but it’s ass to be 550 dollars some people won’t give the money for it it doesn’t mean we can’t afford it
Honestly, airpod max are decent quality and sounds actually balanced (still a bit bass heavy but I am a grados and Sennheiser fan boy sue me). Downside they are kinda expensive in fact I would never buy myself a pair with my own money... but boses are still in business so what do I know...
Serch in youtube andynsane, this is a copy (sorry for my english)
HELP YOU ARE SO ENTERTAINING
i deadass started laughing five seconds in
Apple in future: airpods max plus 2x Multiply ultra Pro athlete headphone
If that was their actual ad i would by them.
I'm poor End.
Finally I understand the meaning of his name 'Rob Jobs' His job is to Rob 😂😂
I love and live for the composure of this video-

Headphones for $550?. HOLY CRAP! I Could buy a PS4 in that price. No Thanks.
Dude i upgraded from a 60$ head set and i feel NO DIFFERENCE
I love how I got a bill from apple when I watched the video
The beautiful sound of privilege 😂
Wtfffff u mute out the poor people tho
Another android user who makes his own apps in order to be coherent with his affirmation “but android is more customisable” 🤣 I laughed with this video though
What only just realized Rob is the other dude on loveliveserve😁🔥🔥
This had me so weak I swear
It's like a video of Andynsane but this is in spanish, so cool the video
2:05 man great sound quality
bro what song is on the backround
😂
I prefer using 2dollar vido,mx500 kgis or saiyo ed series earbuds
They don’t have Pro in the name because the Airpods Max Pro for £800 will be out this year.
"The people that don't have airpods max are the same people who can't afford them " 🤣🤣
This channel has just become repetitive
“ and who the hell chose green”
Hi im rob jobs founder and CEO of asshole Ummm apple ya ok that seems right ya ok
That creastal clear micro phone
you just know they’ll release a second set with Pro slapped on them
HAHAHAHAHHA I DIED AT THE MICROPHONE QUALITY
😂😂😂😂😂😂
The mic quality was so good 😂
instead of squares the look like mini Kias, they should've just made them apple shaped
This is funny, but... well, there are many way more expensive headphones in the market, and there have been, since Hi-Fi has existed. These are nothing shocking.
Hilarious! However I do consider beats to be Apple headphones still. I know they were bought out, but every time I go to The Apple store they’re always chilling there. I love my beats by Dre :-) these, not so much. (Borat voice)
airpods max look like condoms on head
the first sentence got me
😂 😂 😂 😂
Lmao the intro
LOL
Best part is that he actually has one
*Who the hell chose green*                                    -Rob Jobs
LMAOAOAAO
seriously, if you have 600$ to spend on headphones there are SO many better options unless your buying them for the noise canceling.
Two pairs of socks for 20$. "My merch is not expensive"  My ass
at least beats is gone... at least one good thing came from this.  buy something that sounds nice! a nicer sennheiser, a hifiman, a beyerdynamics... anything!
"And to be honest, the only thing max about these airpods are the price" 🤣🤣🤣
The truth of a whole damn brand in one video 😂😂
Subscribed in first 5 seconds 😆
while i love my iphone (over android) ive never once found myself thinking, "gee wish i had some airpods about now!" nor, " a mac would be convenient at this particular moment!" however, i have found myself thinking, "some of yall have bit way too hard into the apple!"
1:04 lmao after all that he bought it anyways. no hate bte
AirPods max. Way too overpriced to giveaway
Y’all just mad you don’t have a pair. They’re awesome and I love them.
they look ugly
Hope Steve Jobs is watching this in heaven
Samsung: We touch your feelings. Apple: we touch your kidneys
2:03 I’m almost scared to ask, but this isn’t the real mic audio.... right?
these arenty funny anymore
Facts
That mic sounded like my teacher mic  lmao
Like WHY THE FUCK would I buy these instead of a quest 2?! Or literally ANYTHING else
Hello this is R0B, robbing the same idea from you guessed it myself for the last year or two.
They should be called airphones
"who the hell chose green" that got me 😂
bro i genuinely thought you made up that product for this video but its actually real
Just buy a steel series headset that is just better for price
I have a lot of Apple stuff. A lot. I love this. Is addicted the same as subscribed?
I feel like he actually just works at Apple lmao 😂😂😂
2:03 Border be like: Do not attempt to board the hellicopter
This video is how I actually found out that these exist
Yooo this MFKN shits got me fuccin ded 💀💀💀

I wonder if he will get sued??????
Apple should hire you.
Do you simp anymore
So glad schools are virtual so I don’t have to see pretentious rich kids wearing these around campus
هههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه seriously I’m dead
“It doesn’t make any s{cents}e. That’s bc it makes dollars...millions and millions of dollars.”💀💀💀
Please stop making fun of me its making me sad
Is the mic actually like that?...
Good excuse to buy all the apple products
its 2021 and these videos still come up in my feed....
Does he work at Apple forreal???
“How expensive are they” “Yes they are”
I am apple fans but this is funny  😄
I lie, how he said, “who the hell  choose green” so true
'asshole.. no APPLE'   im ded xD
The microphone part had me dying hard
The most ironic thing about all these videos is that rob actually buy all og these for the videos
They still got a sail from you tho,😂
He know very well these are just an excuse to buy all the newest apple products and make fun of them.
“Who the hell chose green” PLEASE- 😭🤚

Seen Someone at the grocery store with these on and he put the apple stickers on them.
When the joke goes on too long
I GOT AN AIRPODS AD LMAOOO
Plot twist : they actually by apple products to show in the video
It is 4 am help me I can’t sleep
4:58 I dieddd
0:05 hilarious 😂
This is so good 😊
The case could never
"Who the hell chose green"  Me: Oh. 😥
Apple should been free
What a ugly looking set of overpriced headphones. You can buy 2 pairs of Sony headphones that will do the same damn thing for that outrageous price.
Jesus Saves Love God ✝️
Be careful you might get sued
Me watching this in beats😭😭😭
Wtf
Wtf
The people who disliked can’t take a joke
What is the background music?
Literally the funniest video I have ever seen.
I thought this was Dillon dannis for a second
The wandering catsup pragmatically owe because number regionally thank beneath a rich lotion. certain, mundane asterisk
I wonder if any of the people that approve the designs ever asked: why does it look like that?
Those are head phones
Nice one , but you still bought them tho😂
U still bought one
XD
I didn’t even know AirPods Max existed until this video, I just thought it was a really well produced parody
Founder of asshol-apple
2:03 That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
Honestly I stick with my skullcandy headphones they cost me 60 bucks so I only use them when I’m gaming online or just wanna listen to music to focus
Apple’s new slogan  We are WAYYYY to overpriced
To be honest you look like "Eddie" I thought you were Eddie search it on youtube and see him
That is crazy. It cost $549.00 on apple’s website but on OfferUp they are charging $600-700 for it 😂 🤯
Call em the airheadpods
Tbh I didn’t even know these existed
AirPods Mask would be actually pretty good
Apple: How expensive do you want the AirPods Max to be?  Rob: Y E S
I thought this was a joke but this is an actual product
How much can you milk this, they are like the nicest wireless headphones, nicer then sonys, with the best noise cancilation.
Eddie is that u?
its not that it expensive it that I don't want them
bruh you look like eddievr
Apple fans be like: This video is absolutely bullshit
cara nyindirnya ngeselin
I really hope tim cook does watch this everyday for the rest of his career
"It looks like I'm at the shooting range, who approved these" LMAO I'm dead
apple almost have no inovation in mind, they only mind how to earn money nothing less no thing more thats why im going to buy this, to give the more money
Fun fact : Rob jobs has to buy airpod max himself to make this video
I can afford them but why would they be worth $500🤣🤣
Me going to the description: WHAT THE HECK I HATE MY MOM
I am gonna shit my self if quiet kid brings theese headphones to school.
I subscribed! Gotta see what's next
Who the hell choose green🤣🤣
Bro is that actually how the mic sounds 😂😂

Gold just gold and the truth 🤣🤣
Zhe bluetooth dewice is connected successfuley
Zhe blootooth devwice is ready to pear
apple needs to see this
Me trying to clutch up 2:03 My dead team mates
you know he may make this hating on them but he still bought a pair sooo 😂
you're so good at being bad
My $200 headset sounds better feels better, and mic quality is chefs kiss. Like wtf is apple
3:42 this part made me laugh so hard, nice one! 🤣
as Confucius once said, if you have half of the airpods max's 'money , go get sony wh1000, if you have all of the money, buy two of them.
"We, can sell you, anything" LOL
Lmao it's so effortlessly good
so far this one is the funniest
no offence to apple but I choose beats over these 🤌
Lmao☠️😭🤣
looks like those headphones from roblox
This aint a video ITS A  DOCUMENTARY
Or you can pay 350 and get mx4s which are cheaper and better
Is there anybody who knows the name of the outro song:?...I recall hearing it in Need for Speed but can't remember which one or if it is in fact NFS
This was well thought through. I’ve been wheezing dude 😂
All your arguments are dumb. They’re one of the best headphones out there. And you can pair them easily with other apple devices. Btw, what should they call them if not airpods max? Airpods 3?
transparency mode: wallet edition
I’m listening to this with beats xd     (FLEX)
$550 isn't necessarily a bad price for headphones, like there are dozens of models with higher price tag. However, Apple's model doesn't really justify the price, let's be honest.
"It doesn't really make sense" "That's because it makes dollars..." that's pretty deep  ...into ur bank account 😅😅
Du er norsl
The new AirPod max Profit
RØB looks like Dillon danis
I got them. My headphones are more expensive than my phone...
I wonder what phone he uses
You made my day HAHAHHAHA
outro song ?
They look stupid now but in 5 years time they’re going to be popular... like the AirPods.. it’s quite sad actually lol
the funny thing is these guys make fun of these but have to buy them for their radiculous price first lmao
yep, well at least you can easily recognize idiots on the street just by looking at them
Apple left the chat
can i have the revenue on this video? i want to buy a house
"it doesn't make any cents, it's because it makes millions” lol
“How expensive...  yes, they are” XD
ThE BlUeThOoT dEvIcE Is ReAdY To PaIr
I haven’t seen a single person wear these, probably because they are still recovering from the AirPod Pros
At this point they're gonna sell to you headphones with full charge and no way to charge them again and you would need to buy another pair of headphones
Man I had a bad day, but that “built in mic” bit got my CRYYYYING
But like actually are they even good?
Until now, I thought he was like Steve Jobs son 😹
Ngl I do love how the AirPods Max mute out the poor people. Also I have minor brain damage for actually buying them.
Apple : *New product * ROB: stonks📈
Shoulda pulled out an android
lol
And when your not using them.. there dying. Lmfao
I straight faced the whole thing except the microphone part lmao
Where can I get the airpods big max?
JBL Club One is 100% built better/better sound/more features/better features. And there isn’t bias on wich device it works best on. And the case it comes with is amazing and frankly almost waterproof.
*OK B UT THE BIG MAC PART GOT ME DYINGGGGGGGGGGGG ALKDLJKLJAKJFSLKJLKAJJ*
The white background always reminds me how disgusting my screen is.
"The beautiful sound of privilige". Bruh! 😂
I bet ur gay
Lmao
Lmao mute out the poor ppl
Who-the-hell-chose green
Are you hands tiny lol
"crystal clear audio." sounds like a police transmission. so funny i was about to spit my drink lol

Apple is worth 2 trillion and they are as money hungry as they were when the company first started, greed has no limits apparently
rob jobs *read that again*
You should do a vid on apples $500 wheels lol
Lmao it's more expensive than the ps5
Røb Jøbs
“Headpods” stick
Can you do it Apple watch commercials were honest? That would be cool
How expensive are they?  Yes they are.
Change your name to Rob Cook, Steve is dead, I know it’s a joke but still feels a bit wrong mate.
Apple be like: 👁👄👁
Here are 4626 who work for apple
Oh man, their 2000 dollar stand is still their most arrogant product yet though LOL
Liked and subbed! You sir, are my new hero! Regards from a fellow Apple basher LOL
Kidz pop
These look like they're made by 3M
This just reminded me why i always buy galaxy. Apple really knows how to piss people off
2:02 brooo how did you get SirenHead to feature you on this video?!?!
You are so good!
It just another expensive product to attract attention to apple brand but not as ridiculous as apple stand..
I'm screaminggg😭😭😭😭 no power button so that your headphones die Lolllll😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Apple just puts pro max because it sounds cool, all of the iphones is literaly the same but more expensive shit
Airpods are doggy  Edit: I LOVE THE VID
Am I in a Alternate Universe cause I did not know that Airpods Max are a real thing
Guess you’re offended by the bra shape and you’re male
I feel bad that he has to buy these to do the video
See what he is doing but not really funny tbh
Hello Zacky Vengeance!
Top notch $500 mic quality. 👌🏾
Maybe it's just me but the looks of this headphones is so stupid 🙄 in my opinion.
Lmao!
2:03
Bruh how do you keep a straight face while reading your script lmao
all apple products are overpriced crap.... i feel sad for the people who actually think that they are worth that kind of money
Imagine how easy it is to snag these off someone’s head
People watch these and then still buy Apple products
headpods🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Someone from Apple needs to react to this😂
It apple product are so bad why do you even buy it for making these videos...?
Might as well make airpods pro in different colours 😂😂😂
There not noise canceling your just losing your hearing cause you always have your music on max
i love how u buy every product and hate them
headpods lol
I bet Apple is subbed to u 😂😂
RØB
nice headphone when people ask the cost apple says yes
The funny part is, the braw part is so true-
IM 9 SECONDS IN AND IM DYING LMFAOOOOO💀💀💀💀💀
Skullcandy is better than apples headphone. In my own opinion.
that offer up bar true asf😂😂😂😂😂😂💯💯💯💯them mfs be taxing like they manufactured it in they house
Here in Australia AirPods Max cost $900
OVERPRICED BUT MY MERCH IS NOT !
Airpod maxes are the one apple product where they could actually increase the price
I literally haven’t heard of these, this is my first exposure. 10/10 great review. Will look into AirPods Big Macs instead.
No one gon talk bout the fact that he Said "it mutes out poor people "🤣
1:07 and the beautiful sound of fire crackling in your wallet
3:59 "I feel like I'm at the shooting range" MOOD
It’s shocking how many people don’t realize you just have a vendetta for Apple.
😂😂😂😂😂
Bruh, you can get like 2x arctic pro wireless for that price
I could listen to this guy all day 🔥🔥😂😂❤️❤️
lol
2:06 sounds like the headphones you get when your in a helicopter
Air pods max and ruby 😂😭✌️
I like how he’s hating on them but he has them.
He just made my day
Rich people company
buy robsocks
1:54 Ryan Higa vibes
sounds like people can afford them if they’re making so much money. huh?
Akg, sennheiser, beyerdynamic, grado and many more companies make headphones that are half the price and 10 times better sounds. I have an iPhone XR and love it btw, not a hater, but those cans are overpriced shit for people that knows nothing about quality audio devices
Headpods would actually have been a better name
Apple really do be making people pay $30 for a power brick
3:26 Team rocket! Prepare to fight!
2:09 I lost it when he said "crystal clear" 😭
“Honestly doesn’t make sense, that’s because it makes dollars....millions and millions of dollars.”  Lmao!  This should be Apple’s new motto.
The mic tho,rather buy turtle beaches
“Who the hell chose green” 🤣       (btw this was something he said in the vid)
its nice seeing on the right, a lot of vids saying that thoose broke xD
„who approved these?“ *furios*
What is the music please ?

Bro what if bought apple from Kashmir
Desi roaster😂
I WANT THE RUBY AND MAX ONCES

The microphone sketch had me rolling my eyes & who wants them in green?
😂😂😂
GGHJH
the fact that he says 550 dolors is very expensive is really sad cause in turkey airpods pro is 2000 tl
2:45 I cried 😂😂
4,5k Airpods Max users disliked this video.
How expensive are they? Yes, thry are
this still sold me on them
So even when your not listening they’re dying 😂
Fun fact :he bought them just to insult them
"You can get AirPod Max's at the low price 550 dollars, or you can meet up with someone from the offerup app and pay 680."  I know you know the pain. - lando calrissian i think idk
subscribed
can u sell me a tic tac
"The people who don't have the airpod max are the same people who can't afford them"      *People die if they are killed*
2:41 killed me
Rob jobs-They say the case looks like a bra or something. It looks nothing like a bra it provides a lot of support and makes them look way better    Bra-isn’t that what we do too!!!
greatest microphone xD Today we walk on Mars
Isn’t nobody gonna talk about what if apple sees this video🤭 oop-
Saala Ashish copy😂😂
So funny had to watch it over and over
How expensive are they? Yes, they are
“AirPods Max&Ruby”
when the price is already too outrageous you don’t have to make a fake one insanely high
Nailed it.  You should have mentioned you can never turn them off so you can drain the battery every day for no reason whatsoever.  Great job!!! Loved the video.
Me listening on my air pods max 👁👅👁
They look cheap tho
I was confused when Apple called it the AirPods max. 1: they’re not even like air”pods”. AirPods were like wireless earbuds 2: doesn’t the Apple store already sell beats headphones?
Bro you really said I can’t offer them buddy stop the cap I already have 3 pair and AirPods Pro and AirPods new iPad 3 Apple Watch 2 Apple Pencil iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 so get your fact straight
AAAAAMAAAZIING IS NOT ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE THIS F*7CKING AWESOME VIDEO!
You should do a give away of iPhone 12 or 11
hi
For those that dont know what headphones to buy: SRH440 sub 100 and  a dt990 past 100 cya
Cyprien’s video...
I robbed a bank to buy this. Now I am listening songs in this in prison
I was deaf before I brought airpods max. I sold my kidney to buy one. After playing a few songs in it I got my hearing capacity back. Now I opened a clinic for deaf people only for 5000 dollars you can get your hearing capacity back. Now I am a millionaire and I bought my kidney back. Thankyou Apple for this amazing product
They are pretty good ngl
This is so funny! 😂😂😂
Skipping a commercial to see an commercial
When they tell you to act normal and neutral on tv
Sold!
Crystal clear sound 😂
I think it's a decent looking over ear headphone. I'll pay 10 EU
The built-in microphone demo😂😂
Who the hell choose green
How did  I automatically know he was gonna say yes at the price
0:05 Lol company of
As an airpod max pro (pro max? idk) that shit is not worth at all. Shit gets moist mad fast and its terribly horrendous sound quality
Jeez you can be savage
The design ew
The dislikes are everyone was got off on this video
Imagine Tim Cook watching this
Bruh I didn’t even know this was a thing
"Airpods is inferior to its competitors"  that was the icing on the cake for me 🤣🤣💀
I feel like i want to make a samsung version of these 🤣🤣
The first 7 seconds had me dying 😂🤣
I bought the AirPods Max..... I think they are worth the 549 price tagZ  One month of having them and they don’t function! I even have apple care and trying to get a replacement has become a debacle with apple!
I dies when he says “ I love how the air pod maxes conveniently and automatically muted out the poor people”
THE AIR PODS MAX AND RUBY NOOOOO😭😭😭😭
Next thing you know apple comes out with these...
"Rob Jobs" was a nice touch.
Salty.... I still bought it.
That green is abhorrent.
They look dum af
Fun Fact: Max existed before the Pro came along (IPhone XS Max)
Who the hell chose green!
bro like stfu with your thumb nail
Oh no I have AirPod pro I fell broke so bad              Lol
you know they accurate when 4.4k ppl who definitely have them thumbs the video down
°
i honestly too am wondering how on earth they still have customers, but i guess there will always be people either a) dumb enough or b) grow money on trees
nigahiga clone
I'm gamer I thought I was crazy for spending 300 on Astro a50 and to be honest there not much better than 100 to 200 pair
It doesn't make any sense... That's because it makes dollars 😂
Man u look like eddie vr bruh
Love it!! 😂
The 4.4k dislikes is salty apple sheeps who actually bought these things🤣
When you want to get back the money given to apple by filming these videos
Damn, jumping straight in with “asshole” lmao!
Why is nobody talking about the 1800€ headphones from Logitech wich sound worse than the air pods max
In short: They’re wireless Headphones. You can buy a version that’s exactly the same for 20 bucks at Walmart
Mutes out the poor people 🤣🤣🤣
He is so honest
I'm actually not sure right now if the mic quality at 2:10 is real 🤣
people: what is the price  Apple: yes it is the price

I’m both laughing my ass off and getting really pissed off. Great job.
Honestly, when apple made beats solo pro I was really excited and I actually got one. I would deffo recommend beats over these
Omg yo are a hater of apple
The small, yet ignored, flex this guy is doing by saying how expensive these are yet has a pair AND the bra
Cool man 🤣 i appreciate your words about apple inc reality
2:03 Didn’t know we were inside an airplane
all the dislikes are from all apple's accounts
Headpods sounds pretty good bro. 😂😂
when you actually have to buy the product to roast it ( ͡☉ ͜ʖ ͡☉)
Testing
And the most asked question is how expensive is it? And the answer to that is always: yes, they are   😂😂😂😂😂😂
Headpods💀
apple watching this
I think apple hates him...
20$ for 2 pairs of socks, yeh totally not overpriced lmao, I mean compared with the air pods I guess it's decent, but 20$ for 2 pairs of socks lmao
Apple still goat
Looks like 2 power mac mice stuck to a piece of metal.
What's the piano song on the background?
Oh nice AirPods max ad by pice of shit)
So funny
The greatest..... LOL...
Its 6000₺ in my country.
I listened to a pair of these and was pleasantly surprised at how good they actually sounded. You can not make out they sound bad, because they just don’t. I own a pair of sennheiser hd600 audiophile headphones and a pair of ath-m70x studio monitors, I’m not some guy who’s come from a pair of JVC gumy earphones.
Perfect 🤩👌
I bought one from my friend for about 30 bucks. Profit. Airpods Pro lol
I'm not gonna lie they're quite ugly
but u still bought one for this video ..
"The people that don't have the AirPod Max are the same as the people who can't afford them"  That's a fact.
I every day come here to just watch the first 7 seconds 😂😂😂
The whole latest and greatest audio technology part made me laugh so hard
Soo funny
1:30 how expensive are they?  Rob jobs: if you gotta ask then you can’t afford it son !
Incredible 😊
There not even AirPods lmao
HeAd PoDs LOLOL 😂
Nobody going to talking about the mic test 🤣🤣
Only 765 usd here (630€)
This man Rob jobs and an assho- Apple CEO.
“A product no body asked for” basically everything people buy
So unfunny and I don't even like apple
500$+ for a pair of shitty headphones, when you can get a High class Audiophile Headphone for the same price that does support 3.5mm  I already know what i will buy 80$ gaming headphones, and spend the rest on my pc
Dollars > sence
That mic gives me AIDS... ok these things are ki da doodoo yea they have sound muffeling but you can get those for 30 to 40 bucks not what 500 to 700.... thats bs
why would someone dislike this video lol?
That microphone stint was cool af
Is this dillon dannis
I wouldn't hate Apple as much if it wasn't for the fact that they so desperately try to appeal to the "upper class"/"upper class wannabes" with their average quality devices. They try to portray themselves as a luxury brand when the only thing they have in common with luxury brands is the fact that their products are average, overpriced, and made by children I'm third world countries........................... Now that I think about it 🤔 they might actually be a luxury brand after all.       Sike, any phone you buy is basically obsolete 2 years after you buy it.
Shit i used to watch this dude when he got like 8k views didnt realize he was this big now lol
these stopped being funny after 2013. well, they were never funny, but they stopped being relevant after 2013. you’re beating the bones of a dead horse
At 2:09 my cat attacked the screen. 😂
They’re litteraly more expensive than a next gen console and are really not worth it
You could just get the new Xbox wireless headset which goes for 100/130 which like will do the same thing as the air pod max.
Dude i lost it at 2:43
Imagine searching up reviews for these and this video pops up
Lmao....so ur saying I’m poor?   Jk ur funny 😁😂😂
Apple be like: Thanks for the free ad
0:15 That Idiocracy reference at the beginning earned you a sub. That was genius.
lol thats great
I'll stick with my k240's
1:0
1:
1:00
He had t buy them to make fun of it lop
Android fanboy lol get outta here with that shit
Still bought it
Max and ruby
this gives me Jim from the office vibes
This is hilarious, you've spoken for many of us thinking the same! The sound of privilege ;)
Strange question: whats the name of the song playing from the start in the background? 😊
The microphone got me 😭😭
Got a Samsung commercial for this vid. Well played.
After a year they will start to throw them for free with a new macbook
Bruh I didn't even know about them until now lol
Bose 700 are better
Instead of this you could just buy a ps5
Can you do review for the Apple desktop tyres for 700 bucks 😁
Shit to funny !
Apple's taking notes... nooo... don't give them further ideas
bro i was soo dead when he said and most importantly expensive😂😂😂😂😂
I just found this and the first asshole part? You had me there dude. Lol
I wish apple made a video reacting to your videos that would be funny
Wow real hot take. I wonder where you came up with this idea...
This time Apple pulled off a Robbed Jobs.
Yet he still bought them.
LOVE when he makes these videos
They are so bad, and they sold out on the first day.
Like honestly what were they thinking why doesn't it have a power button the only way you can technically turn them off is by putting them in the case but who wants to carry that everywhere they go just to turn them off😂
not the big macs
Now this was EPIC.....apple watching 👁️👄👁️..HOW? WHY? WHEN? WHO? 👀🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rich doesnt equal privilege
Seeing your video through the AirPods max lol 😂
Have you max pimped the Mac pro the price was almost 80 000 $ everyone can buy it LOL
Yø
2 seconds in and I spit my drink  🤣🤣🤣
1:50 :( your right im broke af
roasting apple product but still buys them😂😂
roasting apple product but still buys them😂😂
I thought the headphones was fake. Thats sad. I had to Google them
these videos are quite delicious.
Wait this is a parody? I thought this was a legit apple ad.
Why u look like Dillon Danis?
Everyone that likes this video is just jealous they can’t buy them
Or Head pods....
humor
Apple is the biggest fraud
Bro I love you
If this guy owns apple apple will never get up by the way your good at this lol i type on youtube if apple is honest since i hear this i never buy a iphone or even airpods soo thx man your a moneysaver
“So what next? Mega headphones? *Ultra* headphones?” “...You’re mocking me.” *”Maximum Over-Headphones.”* “Fuck off, consistent naming conventions!”
Yeah that's the video we need
Didnt know Ted Mosby was the CEO of Apple
Sadly, when Steve Jobs is still alive he has passion for his position and would really want to make something innovative but now it's all money money money heck even if Apple literally just made a box with an apple logo on people would go nuts over it
Still wondering, what's the name of the piano song? Anyone?
Airpods pros are still better tho. Good luck working a manual job with those on your head.
Everyone saying Apple is dumb on there iPhones
1:25 I died 😂😂😂😂
his business is named rob jobs cuz he literally robs jobs
when you realise he had tobuy them for this video
Me: I don't it have because i can't afford it Rob: they call max because they are expensive  😂😂 If apple was rob
When you're too poor for apple products but bashing on apple is free😂
How expensive are they? Apple: Yes
can't believe that there are people who are actually buying these...
💩
POV : He robbed the CEO jobs
2:03 when someone tells you to record on an Android
doesn't make any sense, that's because makes dollars, millions and millions
"Who the hell choose green?" 🤣🤣 "The only max on this are the price" 🤣🤣
Do i were them on a helicopter
I’m not going to lie I got these for Christmas and I like them. The caring case isn’t that bad but it could have been better. But they do sound amazing and the transparency and noise cancellation are really good
💯 💯% TRUE 😂😂😂
They are so ugly
Since we're all doing this...  Audience: "How expensive are they?" Apple: "Yes, yes they are."
Yoo this guy is subtlety hilarious 😂
What they are like $900 here in Australia
I know this is fake because tim cook is the ceo duhhh
Thumbnail: wtf are these Me: There Airpods Max Pro Plus Ultras you asshole
AirPods bigmac hahahaha
Apple watching this : “We are going to move to Mars now.”
Idiot hater
“then you never hear from beats ever again... so whatever... ha ha” 🤣🤣
An Apple ad just played before this video started😂😂
Over the ear headphones, over the head earphones...and its completly free after purchase. ☠
Hm couldn’t tell if this was a commercial for apple or beats
*Damn thats a good mic*
KEEP PREACHING BRO! PLEASE DON'T STOP!
When he said $550 I thought he was joking....he wasn’t joking ;-;
I just realize why his name was Rob Jobs lol... I thought Jobs was just there cuz it kinda rhymed
I am an iphone user I found this video is very entertaining 😘 Spread love ❤️ not hate 💕
Apple users be tweeking. Well all except me.
Dunno why but I want em even more now
Wait you bought them?
He really said AirPods Max and Ruby
Apple: hiring assassins !
$550 for headphones LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO (buy beats or something  instead)
“Today I’m not excited” 😭
Enough.
I done even get why it's still called airpods when these definitely not pods.
OMG! LOL
They look ugly af
The case could never😂😂
20$ for socks, what
I just ordered Sony's for $370 Canadian.  That's  more than I've ever spent on headphones.  The Apple's are about $700 here.  No way I'm paying that much.
Your just jealous you can’t make as good of a product like apple. Shame on you
500 still can’t connect to ps5
lolll :))))
this guy even got the leg shaking sound down 👌🏼
"A product no one really asked for" well said.
People that watched this video with the AirPods Max be like: 👁👄👁
Ø
I got beats and usin em rn
If only this was funny
Xbox series x. Not the xbox one x
1:55-2:02  LOL
“Who the hell chose green, and silver.”
Who started these honest commercials first? Rudy or this guy??
Eddievr... Yeah
My brother chose green
THE PLUG IN THE END...
Music : Dismantle - Peter Sandberg
THE LEAST SOLD COLOUR IS, "WHO THE HELL CHOSE GREEN"
Bro i thought you were joking when you said $599. But they really are that expensive😅
Bro i thought you were joking when you said $599. But they really are that expensive😅
Yeah....... I think I’ll stick with my AirPods
Why don’t we all tweet this to apple
theres no way thats the microphone quality 😭😭
That looks so cool
Jokes apart they seem pretty awesome, still I'm sure most people can be satisfied with cheaper products.
.... and you forgot to tell ... If you damage the coushins( pillows), noone else can repair them....exept apple. Because if you try a third party part, it will instandly selfdestruct! 😅🤣🤩🤣😅🤯
Airpod Max was designed by the NRA😂😂
They look so ugly tho 😭😭
Sort of low hanging fruit in terms of humour
No way would I bother, wouldn't want people to think I can only afford the cheap stuff.
For some reason I first read AirPADS Max
So this is what Dillon Danis does.  Now I understand why he only fights once every three years. Lazy bum.
so if you clown apple all the time, why use a android mic??😂
Yes!!!
Lol i was watching this while eating
😟
Looks old like a military thing it’s ugly I would not buy it , it is so dumb instead of wasting money to make this crap 💩 they should be making a notch less phone and 90 hertz display
the beat at the end 🔥🔥
0:05 best part 😂
Girl, this is not funny
Damn it.... if my innermost non-materialistic spirit familiar was manifested.... ROB
How expensive are they?  Yes  Lmfao
Apple are probably laughing bc they still got him to buy it so they win in the end 😂
Watching it while wearing AIRPODS MAX onn...😂😂😂😂
2:03 really caught me off guard lol
Why not buy a ps5 disc edition
“It doesn’t make sense, it makes dollars” ~ Apple 🍏
You missed one part, they're so heavy! In Canada they're like $800, so I got Sony ones for like $350, and it has very similar noise cancelling features. And way lighter! I tried the Apple ones, and the ear parts feel nice, it's just so heavy! And they only work with new Apple products, I wanted something for my ThinkPad. Like, how would you ever use them for work or school? Even my university that has Apple devices to use, has older ones that they don't work with. I'm just so confused as to why anyone would buy those over Sony. And Beats just suck, I used to have those.
The longest ad I didn’t skip.
People still gonna be stupid and waste they money on this LMAO
Ya
Gold
4:50.   Genius
I once purchase a an ipod 5th Gen  $358  within a week a screen brokne, reason; i dropped it. I went to Apple Service center they said this display is not available.. which annoyed me a lot,  it was my 1st apple product and my last.. when some says pros about apple i feel like. tie that person to my bike and drag him at 250 kms for straing 10 millles... how Stupid can a person be i was once coz i trusted. Srry for my English..
😅😅 fuxk that im tempted to buy them now
it doesn't make sense because it makes dollars :-D
In Russia they cost 1000$
🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
*Okay—but why does he look like EddieVR?*
It doesnt make any cents..
Apple prices are ridiculous yet I keep buying their products 🥲
When I heard the sound cancellation kick on out of habit I actually thought I couldn’t hear anything because it’s quite in my house😂
Is everyone in the comments friends?
WAIT THESE ARE A REAL THING?!?!! APPLE IS ACTUALLY SO STUPID WHO WOULD THEEY CALL THESE AIRPODS HAHAHAHAHAH
I think u shoot it in an iphone
I didnt like the design of the airpods max, definitely it looks like you are in shooting range...
I have second gen AirPods
I am thinking what apple user thinks after watching his video.?? Like do they feel dumb? And then just say whatever!!!??
"Only at Karl's Jr."
0:05 oh that’s why my phone stinks so bad
“Most importantly, expensive “ 🤣
“So when your not using it. It’s Dying.”
All I want to know is what is that fire piano music in the background
And yet we still bought it.
Hi, I'm Rob and I Hate Apple for 🍎
No turtle neck? Missed opportunity!
Funny thing is rob has most of the Apple products 😂
The thumb downs are from apple fanboy lol
He might be roasting them but he also bought a bunch of them just for this vid soo....
The beautiful sound of privilege 👨🏻‍🦰
😂😂😂
headpods lmao
Yes, they are! xD
"Ok, So how expensive do you want this product to be?"   " *Yes* "
It felt a bit awkward watching this with my Apple headphones on. :-)
Day 52 of trying to get sum support off a comment 😊
wtf are you?
Fucking hell idk why this was on my recommendation but I'm so glad it was this is amazing ahaha  Liked and subscribed!
Next Product: Airpods Max Omega Ultra
those headphones look so ugly lol
Omg I never heard about these airpods, and they are so ugly that I thought that this is fake😂
amazing
Intro 😂
rob buys the item as a business expense
Hahaha so good!
You’re so talented
Such an easy cashgrab they know its not needed but people will still buy it
Instead of Rob Jobs, Steal Jobs would be better.
The left fired jelly whisper because tortellini ectrodactyly attract apropos a evasive education. sticky, nebulous view
bro airpods are nice tf
This was 1 month ago, It still holds true to this day!
Yeah i‘d like an Airpod big macs... thx
Was that low pass filter when he put on the headphones 😂😂😂
IT'S FUNNY HOW HE CRITIQUES APPLE BUT HAVES EVERYTHING FROM THEM.
I still buy lol
The microphone took me out lol!!
Stupid
Mutes out the poor people 😂😂
The case could never hahahah
And today's quote goes to: "it doesn't make any sense, because it makes dollars"
"the beautiful sound of privilege" *turns on noise cancellation* - an underrated joke!
Looks like Dillon Danis
Ever since I bought these, I've been getting voices in my head at 3am.. Oh wait... I left youtube on autoplay again and it ended up on an asmr video
The people that bought these needed to see this video earlier
Someone else is cleared by this man's voice or just me
The 4K dislikes are the Apple employees
I enjoyed this more than MKBHD's one
Sounds good I’ll take 2
Air pods max and ruby 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Who the hell chose green and silver 😂😂😂
Bro at 0:05 he said asshole instead of apple
Even apple users will laugh at this😂😂
I like how it automatically mutes poor people. Bruh
4:25 its ironic that i am listening with beats made my apple 😂😂
3:11 🤣🤣🔥🔥
Plot twist: he edited this video in macbook
In Australia the AirPods max are $900
"Who the hell choose green"😂😂😂
Can you do a Samsung one please (not that I hate Samsung but RØB’s videos are super funny😂)
50 second unskippable ads. Yep thats the dream.
I’m always excited when apple launches a product because of rob 😂
Apple ceo disliked the video
This is getting old
The AirPod Big Mac 😂😂 ..
Hilarious!! Lots of laughs!
👍👍👍👍♥️♥️
Its not overpriced how you supposed to implement wireless charging on headphones and the mic is yeah he’s right though. Honestly the only thing bad about it is the fact you’ll need to use the bad case but you wont be using this for wired if you spent 500 dollars
ok i’m sorry but why is this guys jokes literally the same every video he makes   which is literally the same as every other apple commercial parody video   ~product is sooo expensive  ~everyone who doesn’t have apple products is poor ~innovative  ~apple is expensive again   -related to iphone videos  ~new one is released every month ~expensive (no sh*t) ~preinstalled apps (look at android) ~they’re all the same (not really) ~you’ll buy anything apple makes (wtf lmao apple supports phones for 6 years)
Please tell me I’m not the only one who loved watching max and ruby as a kid😭
“Headpods”
"who the hell chose green?"
Starting to think that his videos are just an excuse for him to buy the latest Apple products
Wack 👎👎👎
100 more than my beoplays and I doubt they come close in quality.
Apple is ass
I was not considering AirPods max until i saw this ad
If they were honest, i would buy those airpods
If they were honest, i would buy those airpods
“The box it comes in is big for no reason” 😂😂😂
Those aren’t even AirPods anymore- there headphones
Looll did this guy get sued yet?
1:35 LMAOOOO
Mutes out the poor people 😆😆😆😆
they have a built in mic? and it sounds like garbage??? im so sorry, but this ain’t worth 600 dollars 💀💀
“ These are the best over the ear headphones Apple has ever made” -Rob Jobs, 2021
I thought he was joking when he told us the price
Apple: Releases a new product  RØB: Its my time to shine
3:08 killed me 😂
My mom loves you
I lost it at the “haha” after the beats bit
This is amazing
The beautiful sound of privilege Hahahaha OMG I can't 😂😂😂
Poda loosu
FUCKING CLASSIC
The hair pods macs the mini macs the Big Macs...  Apple: WRITE THAT DOWN RIGHT THAT DOWN!
He just bought the Airpods Max to make this video.
I choked at the shooting range. America would never....
that one friend in the psn party: 2:03
its also super disrespectful to make fun of a dead man
Case of Airpods looks like Bra Feminists- " Peace was never an option"
THE MIC QUALITY LOL
You do awesome vids but most apple products are good
Rob:Why didn't we just name them headpods? Apple employee to another:WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN!
WhO ThE HelL ChOoSe GrEeN
Why not AirHeads or AirPhones- wait, that doesn’t seem right :/
Pretty sure next year they will release The AirPods Max Pro which will have an on/off button and the price will be 999$ or some bs like this
Most offer up users are idiots jaja with no idea on how to sell.
You alone can ruin the apple corp
As much as i agree with your vids someone should make a vid on how all your vids are the same and how you milked it
Oh for that crazy price, how about a PlayStation 5 instead ? Oh hell yeah
Who the hell chose Green killed me
the microphone test got me so hard man i'm dying xddd
i dont keep up with apple that much so i dont know what the new products are.. but who actually pays £500 for headphones... mine are like 6 times less than that- and theyve lasted me so far so i dont need fancy, expesnsive new ones
I am surprised apple has not sued his ass yet
How is he still on youtube
“Hi, I’m Rob Jobs. Founder and CEO of Asshole— Apple.”   lmfao you know this is gonna be good when the first 5 seconds made you chortle like a horse
reminds me of the ryan higa vids
They didnt put "pro" before the max because the "pros" are coming next year for triple the price 🤣
I’d rather buy beats studio save like 400$
I would actually choose green 👉👈
Steve Jobs watching this crying 🤣😭
What if Apple was honest😂
so glad i dont use apple anymore
"How expensive are they?" *Yes*
Why people send much money for worse things? No one shouldn't waste 590.00$ for a single headphone.
Røb what is your name
You are just a goat at YouTube if you didn’t join I would still be watching movies
Instead of saying silver you should have said “Plain”
C'est comme Cyprien avec la Apple watch 😂
Apple is just like the beats they bought.. overpriced garbage.
it looks like a butt - me and my brother at the same time 2021
🔥
But who the hell CHOSE green?!
You had me at asshole, I mean apple
His voice is so pretty omg i loved it
Airpods mini max is my favourite 😁😁😁
This is hilarious 😂
2:03 EARRAPE WARNING FOR AIRPODS MAX USERS 😂
Is it just me or does he look like Pedro Tovar  (Eslabón armado)🤭😂😭
This was so funny 😂
I think it's really funny that this channel almost only lives to bully apple not calling this bad I think this is really cool and funny
help this is a new account and it says I watched this video when I haven’t clicked on anything. I’m scared this account is cursed
2013 called, they want their video concepts back
Got me in the first couple seconds
Apple robs us always😂😂😂  Me: Watching from my new IPhone 12😭
HEADPODS... wow you are a genious level apple..should be hired.
This remind me of ashish chanchlani  double apple video 😂
This video's length is same to the previous airpods one  ......... 5:09
Next level satire 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love that 😍
I bet the next version they inevitably release in like a year won't even have the headband part
Hahahaha you're such a hater, love it
People still make these? lol
Are you apple hater
1:25 I’m dead he said some yes they are expensive
I wonder what phone does he use.. imagine him using iphone ..
I could afford these, but they are a terrible value for that price. A premium $600 headphones from actual audio brands are better in every way.
“The people who don’t have AirPods max are the same people who cant afford them”  😂😂😂😂😂😂
This made me laugh 😂
Y did u buy them if ur making fun of them
TRUMP 2021 JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED!!!
I can buy genuine, audiophile quality headphones for less than $550.
OMFG ! I did not even know this product existed.... dammmmn I'm late haha.
Imma spit facts over here: Apple made airpods and people bought it since it was a good design, now the pro is a normal wireless headphone, something that people would not initially buy before getting brainwashed by apple, if you are not brainwashed by apple yet you will understand what im saying
just get heaphphones for like 10 dollars or sum. i have cheap headphones and theyre way better than you think
How Expensive are they? RØB:Yes!
How expensive are they?  Yes
The kingdom of heaven can be compared to leaven, in which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened.
In Year 2030 Apple releases new *Airpods max mini pro ultra lite R1 R2 L1 X left up right down left up right down*

“Who the hell chose green?” 💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣
I love this
“Just get a Sony pair”
FCK 2:01 I DIED LMAOOO
You look like Eddie VR LMAO
😂😂😂😂 everything ,is correct in this video
If rob job was honest
Me with my beats on I-
Now I recognize that true and best vendor on here it’s legit I can say @Darklots on telegram you’re the best thanks I used the digital card it works really good,no blocking,the balance on it is even more than the actual balance I bought thanks to you @Darklots on Telegram
I’m an apple user and I approve this.
Public;How expensive are they ? Steve; yes.
They aren’t even airpods anymore they are just Bluetooth headphones- just get some headphones from job-hi five
I know they are just white headphones. You can buy normal ones for like $30
“It looks like I’m at the shooting range” I see this as an absolute win.
I can’t wait for the iMicrophone plus max ultra extra pro version 1 max
XD
You Will Get Hired By SAMSUNG
I would choose green..
My slow ass, from the beginning of these parodies.. just realized that       Rob Jobs meant robbing jobs...
Looks like a $30 headphones
"we can sell you anything" 😂😂😂
Can confirm mic quality matches this trailer
Greens the best color @ me
he reminds me so much of peet from friends
Thanks for keeping me up with the most disgustingly expensive inventions that no one asked for. Sorry, I ment newest technology.
The roblox ceo is back bois
I hate apple but I like them
Lol I just got beats😂😂
Shooting Range🤣
I got a Samsung add before this
B&W is better 🔥
Tbh I'm not surprised anymore😑
For this price you can buy some good audiophile-grade headphones, and even some affordable planar magnetic headphones from Audeze. Or, you can buy entry-level audiophile-grade headphones for a half of price, and some good DAC for other half of price, and the sound quality is still going to be many times better.
Hmm... Hes a criminal. He robs jobs.
I am watching you first time 👍👍👍👍 subscribed

Apple is honestly so fuckin smart  Since they own beats  They overpriced those headphones so people would buy the beats
Ur mic is like the kids on fortnite when I beat them in a 1v1
Nobody: Him: “ And to be honest the only thing that is max about it is the price..” That gets me every time 🤣
wtf
no
Okay but I lowkey want the Airpods Max & Ruby-
Plot twist he bought them
the thing about beats is so accurate and funny, I literally can't stop laughing 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤯 no words
Biden: 0:17
"The only thing 'max' about these airpods is the price." I'm gonna use that! 😂
“Who the hell chose green...” 🤣
Rob jobs: the AirPods max is $550 Rob jobs In 2051: the AirPods max max PRO s.e.x deluxe is 5M dollars
I knew you would do one like this
Max and Rubi I remember them
If you want to roast anyone or anything just learn from our rob jobs . He can do it so peacefully and calmly
Cyprien
Steve Jobs was smart. After he passed Apple went downhill
I like how his name changes from Steve robs to rob jobs every video
Waiting for 10k subs without video 😂😂🤐
Ruby and max 💀💀
Who the hell chose green 🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣😂💀
The whispering news lilly unpack because message histologically nest besides a hurried fifth. ceaseless, better honey
Yep story of any and all products anymore...nothing is built to last in a capitalist world and society....especially electronics like phones etc that are made for cents and then sold for hundred to thousands of dollars and we have to accept that they only are good for 12 to 18 months basically anymore. Smh, such bullshit...but again...a capitalist society...and let's not even get started on handicapped customers / users like myself 😉 yep yep we get fucked over even more if u can believe it because we are second to third class etc citizens to companies because often we can't even afford what the luckiest of the "regular" citizens can afford in getting the latest technology so yep yep
I always love it when he talked to his "team" half whispering lmaoooo
My Guy Buys the Apple products just to Roast them🤣😆
It’s the “beautiful sound of privilege” for me ✨
yes mate but it auctually is really good sounding
I watched this twice bc it was so good
He looks EXACTLY like Dillon Danis
Air pods maxes are way to overpriced, but my merch isn't! $10 a pair..... That's fucking insane my pair of socks prolly costs 50 cents
Who else is watching this on a iPhone...
“We know that you cannot afford these headphones” hell yea we can’t apple should see these videos
Imma buy the AirPods Big Macs, looks good
Starting early is the best way of getting ahead to build wealth, investing remains a priority. The stock market has plenty of opportunities to earn a decent payouts, with the right skills and proper understanding of how the market works
Kinda reminds of Rudy Mancuso's videos about apple iPhone videoes (no hate)🤔
The microphone part got me
"The Case Could Never" Only some people get that
Too long, can be summarized in 20 words, bruh.
I like rob but i find a bit disrespectful to make funny videos using a dead person's name
Someone: “How expensive are they?” Rob Jobs: “Yes, yes they are.” I’m literally dying 🤣
Airpods Macs is way more expensive bro, not an alternative Hahahaha
0:04
I got a better phone than ip 11 at least and good wireless earbuds for 500e
He the dumb one he bought it
I feel like he only buys it for YouTube
The next name of airpods:airpods  true wireless  v20  hq pro plus ultra expensive sh*t
Poor guy has to buy the product to make the video  Money wasted
Here's the thing tho: airpod Max's, are good! But overpriced
That asshole hit dmm hard 😂😂😂
The price isn't even that bad headphone wise
Founder and CEO of WHAT?
2:02
These videos are gold
Apple: Write That Down.... Write That Down....
Why am i finding this channel today.......??? So much fun to watch, New sub❤️❤️😍😍🥺🥺
They’re actually really good headphones, they’re just ridiculously overpriced and the design looks and functions a little weird
hahaha...mutes out the poor people....
That was hilarious
Believe in JESUS, we are all sinners deserving the wrath of GOD, because we sin against a holy and just and perfect GOD. Therefore we all deserve the punishment hell, but GOD in his rich grace and mercy by which he loved us sent JESUS to die  for us on the cross to leave  his throne and suffer for us. To  be the perfect  sacrifice for us because he  himself was sinless and perfect. That if we would have a repentant heart and believe in JESUS and place our faith in Him, we will be saved from the eternal punishment and be given eternal life.l
Dude how have I not seen you channel before. Subscribed because this sheet is freaking hilarious 😆
I feel called out because I picked green 😂
“How expensive are they” .....yes
AirPods Big Macs are hella fire
lol 😂
Ur the best at sarcasm
Why u hate Apple so much
So you copied every other youtuber and have no original creativity, amazing
Next: if i was honest, for real thats enough u will soon get in trouble with Apple.
bro i wanted doo doo brown as a color choice
The Air Pods are actually really, really good and competes to other even more expensive headphones definitely worth the money
They should have called it Airheads
I laugh so hard when he said ' its free, personalized, engraving after every purchase' 🤣
So its a big air pod pro with a bra
I was watching this wearing the AirPods max😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😂
Apple in 2029 airpods pro plus max 5g fold ultra Edit: thank you for the 2 likes this is the most I have ever gotten
Imagine a world where samsung and other company didnt make earphones would you spend $550 to just use a bluetooth headset not to show off but to use while jogging and hitting the gym and stuff. You can get  headsets with the same features for less than $100 The overprice is for the cost of expesive advertisements
🤣🤣🤣🤣
AirPods Max ultra instinct
Lol even though he’s telling you how it is lol we still go out and spend our money on apple products every time a new product is released 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 guilty 😑
0:58 got me dead😂
If commercials told the truth, we would not buy anything.😂😂😂😂😂 The prices of Apple slave made products are almost as insane as the people buying that crap.
"The ones who don't have the airpods max are the same people who cannot afford them"      - Rob Jobs 2021
Qia motren
Vari karin
im fine with my left airpods generation 1 and right airpods generation 2.     yes theyre different the right one broke and they replaced it with a wrong generation
Bahahahahahhahahaha  Subscribe to me if you think this is true
Airpod users: It smells like broke in here. AirPod Pro users: It smells like poor in here. AirPod Max users: It smells like poverty in here.
B-but I like the green ones
"These are the best over ear headphones we have ever made" Correction: These are the *ONLY* over ear headphones we have ever made
What’s your microfone? It’s amazing...
I’ll stick with my $15 Amazon earbuds
Will the next video be about the « AirPod Pro Max Plus Mini XR Retina 6G » ? 😅🤣
So if I understand. You bought them, understood you made a mistake and made a video to get even ? 🤣. Love it
Guy: how expansive are they  Rob Jobs: yes
This video is worth any seconds of my time. Great video 🤣. « Who the hell chose green ». Just lol man 🤣
Its funny cus its true lol
Ur like the funniest person ever  😆 😆
Brilliant
These headphones are more expensive than  the PS5. iPhone please justify the value if these garbage azz headphones.   If you want premium headphones, buy Audiotechnica.
The only thing that is max is the price omg that was so funny
0:58 i died :D
The AirPods max should HAVE A APPLE LOGO AND IT DIDNT
So true!! They even look dumb!
He is still robbing jobs, i see. Who the hell chose green. Hairpods.
also when I heard the founder and CEO of asshole I laughed and almost blew up same with the wrong teleplay and colors
For the low price of $500
Good but I don’t think it would be five minutes long lol
If I see these on the ground somewhere, I’m stepping on them... on accident of course.
wait..... UR THE SIMP
I like how my senheiser 650s's are a trillion times better than these but will never sell more because of a fucking apple logo
Mutes out the poor people 😂😭😭😂😂
power block,oh no power block 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Although we make a lot of troll, this is still getting purchased who either are Filthy Rich or those who needs to brag.
This is too funny
2:03 killed me
Since when did headphone companies give out chargers with the headphone?
LMAOOOOO I knew this was gonna be a good video as soon as I heard the first words out of your mouth 0:00
This reminds me of Gaming Wildlife...
AirPod Big Macs 😂😂😂😂😂 bro I almost died
I love the green ones
I’ll keep my 1000xM4
But probably got sponsored & got a pair for free because of his YouTube vlog& subscribers. Some humor yes but not hilarious.
ROFLMFAO 😂😂. It’s so funny, but sadly true. 😂😂❤️
They’re just fucking headphones.
The fact that this video costs $550
the micorphone part had me
Everything about it is good but the price
"How expensive are they? The answer is always yes." Bro, you're killin me 🤣 Right up there with "Honest Reviews"
🤣🤣🤣
he said “i’ve said it once and i’ll say it again we...” and all i could think of was “we are farmers bumbumbumbum...bum”
The abundant sycamore notablely wonder because rain aetiologically regret for a juicy wasp. free, ragged headlight
Haha
Thia blutut diwaice is ready to pear
bruh the case looks like a bra, and airpods are so weird, theyre not even airpods, theyre headphones, but more expensive and usless
"This time around, we wanted to offer a variety of fun colors to choose from; Including space gray, pink, sky blue...  *Wh0 tHe hEll ChOse GrEeN*  ...and silver."
I lost it when he said Headpods 😂😭
The microphone
My Sony’s sound better than AirPods ! 🤣
I died at 1:55 😂😂
Hahaha don’t buy beats by Dre .... we did
ya ha ha you found me
Wait but he still has them....
I was waiting for this
They are really ugly headphones
I don't know how I got here, You either
He doesn’t miss😂😭
LMAO Big Macs
Para hacer una buena crítica debería conocer el producto y lo que ofrece Apple, aunque reconozco que el precio es bastante alto, lo que usted hace es crítica que muchos hacen, pero muchos ni siquiera investigan
"So how expensive?"                                                                                                                                                                                                         *yes*
At Apple we strive to make your Walet disappear😂🙃
Plz tell me that not how the actual mic sounds like
They shouldn't even be called "Pods" while in headset form.
You look like Diego from umbrella academy
Music at Start?
Shouldn't it be Rob Cook instead of Rob Jobs?
i dont like your vids and i disagree  now what do a video " stop hating " like and what does my mom have anything to do with you man
This is hilarious
Why wouldn’t they call them Airphones
A
ya
Mrbeast: SO I JUST BOUGHT EVERYTHING IN THE APPLE STORE
I’ve never been so intrigued by an ad
These videos are just an excuse to buy the product... 😂
who else has been waiting for this
Apple left the chat :<
The fact that the name "Rob Jobs" goes perfectly goes on Steve Jobs got me dead XD
The real questions is why does bro have a pair😭
XD
If I am in charge of Apple stores, I would hire you tell jokes to customer’s.
I like how he shows off how shit it is by buying one
“Who the hell chose green”
Gon approves of this video.
Your name should've been "Steal jobs" not rob jobs😂
Shot on an iphone
Audience: “how expensive are they?” Apple: “yes!... they are”
“Asshol- , apple” 😂😂😂😂
How tf does you think of this 😂😂
Bra case
Why would I buy these when I could buy Beats which are also owned by Apple
Lol those look exactly like you are in a shooting range.
2:03 i wish he said: " Enemy UAV above " " Enemy Cruise Missle Inbound "
When you get a Samsung phone ad before this
Some people are dumb the buy thing from iphone just to feel expensive
These headphones make me mad
Is he really the CEO of apple?Im curious🤣
This is so true
2:40
LOL 2:21
But what phone do you use tho
😂😂😂
Wait, those headphones actually exist?! I thought he was making them up
Rob why don't you diss Samsung, I mean I like them just want to see what you can diss them about
I prefer the echo frames cheaper and cooler
that green lowkey fire
Ngl He kinda stole the idea from Phil Laude.
1:12 🥺
lemmi tell u in words yall understand IT WOULD NOT SELL ATALL
AirPods vs some X2HR’s or something....
Airpod   "Big macs "         Genius
4:06 that looks so uncomfortable, why is she not swiping her hair
overpriced beats are made for $14 and sold for $300+ and this is in every product you’ll ever see  Big companies want to make money but they’re not humble about it  You make this amazing product for around $20 but money hungry they sell it for $500.   Like the guy said they really do want to   “cancel out poor people”
3:30 had to rewind because I didn't clock it at first. That's funny as fuck lmaoooooo
Omg this is so good like fr though the headphones at the dollar store are better 😂😂
if you don't like apple,you don't have to make fun out of it
I literally own beats that cost 600 so stop talking poor bitch
This guy funny ass hell😂😂😂😂
lol this is great
Rob Jobs rn: 😢👐📱 but bu- look!!
“The AirPods Max and Ruby” - Rob
I love how calmly he says it
I think they downgraded from AirPods to whatever the hell I just watched a video on.
Tryy “IF IG STORIES” are real, hahaha
Hahah nice one idol.
Funfact - Rob is sponsored by Samsung.

I love how that background music starts amd stops at the correct timings 😂😂😂
2:45 I just died

I will take two AirPods Big Macs
You copied Ashish
Why not put the Max amount of weight on your head possible? Why not add the Max amount of cushion with the least amount of sound isolation? Sent these back for a Max refund tbh.
Damn I actually want to waste my money on this shit just for the Funny meme. Also in green
Asser
I usually don’t subscribe after watching one video but I’m absolutely in love with this content now

Да you eat суши and so do I
RØB
It is so true
And most importantly EXPESEVE
1:00 best part of the video💀
But beats are the OGs
Seriously those headphones are so damn ugly
😂 the mic quality sounds about as good as when Thomas Edison spoke into the phonograph, reciting “Mary had a little lamb…”.
What phone do you keep in your pocket? I have always wondered
I chose green
Seriously tho. How does Apple still have customers? How are people proud of being ripped off this badly?
Great Post 👍🏿
the airpods max microphone is fuckin amazing though. even better than the audio talking directly on an iphone. is dis shit just a parody?
Out of context but who knew that Rob was actually part of kidz bop back then
When he turned the noice cancelling on and played the sound I thought mine turned on lol
You put them on, ok so were is the apple jet to match?😄😄😄😄
Get a life
What the fuck are you doing here😂😂😂
I have headphones really similar except that it’s better and has more functions and it's cheap.
the headphones i bought were 3x this price... theyre good for the price and what they do.
It’s funny because it’s true
he really buyed 500$ headphones better of returned them that a big wast of money
Headpods? Sounds way better
Talks about them yet he has sum and doesnt regret buying them
I have a heaphone its microskophic
The people that disliked are die-hard apple stans
The headphones should be called the Dollar Bill Max or £10,000 Pound Max
Ah, the beautiful sound of being lonely
Props to this guy for buying all of these apple items
So funny😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i bought the Airpods max lol    NO SERUSLY THIS IS LUXUEY LISTENING

Those who disliked are the ones they bought it and are pissed off because of the video because he's saying the truth.😂😂
Airpords max and ruby lol
The hushed millennium congruently guard because guide classically stir like a enormous beam. unequal, substantial game
Tap on the blue to be deaf 2:03
This is the most funnest thing I’ve ever seen. And knowing apple they’re probably taking the ideas of the video and jotting them down on their notepad
The only thing max is the price lmao😂😅
Asshole...ooh Apple 😂😂😂😂
Dis is truth
3:15 that cut is so good 😂
You still bought it
Apple fanboys(or girls) incoming
Me: I want it so bad!!!! Apple: It costs- Me: Say no more
*nice*

Bet apple would love free advertising
I wonder how you don’t laugh 😭🤝
The sound is not even better than the logitech g pro headset 💀💀 and the headset cost 90 or 100€
I didn’t even know these existed until this video
Loll
0:38 ROB speaking facts
I’ll just buy some beats
Is he related to Steven sushi? lol
The clear behavior pathomorphologically boast because pvc substantively grease amid a colorful sweatshirt. wiry, encouraging open
Yo I died to the “who the hell chose green” LMAO
1:24 so true lol
Not gonna lie I thought he was eddie
Was that actually the headphones mic?
As an apple user this is funny and true
It's okay, I get tuned out by privileged individuals on a daily basis anyway.
Phil Laude.
Why do you kinda look like Eddie Vr 🤨😅
Listen. If anyone out there is going to buy these. Don’t
Good job I hope I become like you
Hi,I’m Rob Jobs the CEO of a**hole apple- apple.. :)
Lol
@04:43 at that is why I am invested in Apple. People will buy anything that Apple put out there at-least once. That really made me smile. "it makes dollars".
when he started using the built in mic, I felt that. Worth every penny.
the only thing I would actually get from this commercial is the AirPods max and ruby
For some reason you look like and soundRobert downy junior in his iron man role😂
damn.. my dad passed away a few months ago and he loved your channel, I'd watch this on the tv and he would keep asking me to rewind it because he just kept on laughimg and laughing at these dumb videos. I love this channel, my dad loved this channel, thank you for making him laugh;-;
They looook like two card board boxes on yo ear poor rich apple people
The case is scratch resistant as fuuuggg
So getting sued but so true lmao
This is the only place where android owners can thrive and roast apple products
How do you continuously milk sheep?  Release a new apple product.
This man just waits for new apple products to come out so he can make a new video
Who the hell chose green had me dying 😭
Was that the real mic quality wtfff lmao
That mic audio was so great I had to listen to it 5 times to understand
He need a apple sponsor 😭😭
Is this Dillion danis ?
Gooe
This channel is owned by a aashole broke Android fanboy.  -Apple fanboy, sent from iphone 12 pro max
i just found out these came out lol but ew they’re so ugly and weird
My favorite feature is the design. I love how it fits in with literally nothing else in my household
"An apple a year keeps your money away"
_"Founder and CEO of asshol- apple"_ *Brilliant XD*
Oh noo the Radio Demon 2:04
What happened to doo doo brown and royal black variants?
“The same people who dont have the air pods macs are the same people who can’t afford them” -Rob Jobs
Apple is so expensive that this guy made thousands just by roasting their products 😂😂😂
😂🤣
I hope apple isn’t watching this
The algorithm totally randomly recommended this and I’m glad it did
are we just gonna ignore the fact that hes making bank out of every new apple release
Funny joke about beats 😂 *dying inside because I’m watching this video with a pair of solo 3s*
anyone wonder how this can be reverse phycology and apple is sponsoring him?😂
Because Apple products is a concentrated market.  They can sell ridiculously priced gadgets and people will always buy.
Comparing the price of Apple products with other products is like comparing apples and oranges. Can be done but totally useless tho.
Better go with Sony..
0:03
I dont want to sell my organs
Srsly if u don’t like then don’t like then why buy it this guy is such bullsh*t everyone knows 2020 was a year a scalpers and u just took the chance from the person who really wanna buy it  It’s important to review the item but this is far from it
They did do a pro before the max still funny tho
😂😂😂
Me on my Galaxy buds live just so mutch better and affordable
*Who the hell choose green* .
these are really funny but alot of effort was put in to make most of these products
Why is Dillon Danis doing youtube?
What a stupid design
You're too good at this lol
People watch this but they still buy the expensive stuff when are people gonna wake up
They killed beats to make these...   Didn't even do a good job.
If there are no buttons how is there a noise cancellation button?
Sometimes I just come to know about new apple products just through your videos lol
That is about right with Apple after Steve Jobs. And I do love how people give home credit for building Apple one computers when the real brains Steve Wozniak said the only thing jobs did on the Apple one and two was sell them but he did give credit for using his family’s garage and his sister did help building the Apple one computer. And did you know the Apple shares was only split three ways and Steve Wozniak split his shares with the rest of the garage but not Jobs to bad Hewlett-Packard did not buy the Apple 2 from Steve Wozniak his employer at the time. No one would know who Jobs was. Because Jobs was the sells man and visionary of Apple he didn’t really do much for Apple until the iPhone and iPod the first Mac computers as junk compared to the Apple computer of the same year he just handicap marketing for the Apple line it was a color model not the Mac and apple had built in hardware for the Apple 2 computer line so it can run games. Jobs hurt the sells of Mac computers because he didn’t want children playing games on them. And before Macintosh line the computer children most likeliest first look at was Apple. Just think if Jobs just laidback and got a check Apple computer would be like the Mac iOS have the largest share of the market. But that goes to Bill Gates with Microsoft Windows. But google is growing fast. Most cellular devices is google’s android. Oh don’t forget a ceo of Microsoft did dump tons of money in Apple to keep them in the game because of Steve Jobs marketing remember mot school computers was Apple it is the first iOS children got to use at the time. And I do think Tim Cook is really bad for Apple because removing repairable parts and trying to stop people from fixing their own devices. That is why I’m sadly not going to bay a new MacBook this time but a new asus computer or a Lenovo something that has removable ssd and ram.
Missed u❤️
Hilarious!
I feel like at least half the people that disliked this have already bought them
The mic make u sound like a part of the moon landing
Nice
"It totally doesn't look like a bra they're 2 different things!" "It provides a lot of support and makes it look better...the case can't."  Am I the only one who noticed or??
Me: how much do they cost Apple: yes
Check out my newest video I’m trying to get a lot of views to make my family proud
I can afford it but Apple will not rape me anymore. Is enough with the stupid overpriced IPhones.
I love the satire, really.  But they surprisingly place themselves quite high when it comes to sound and ANC quality (judging by many reviews, I don’t personally own them).
Hilarious great performance loved it 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Why would I buy the max and ruby ones though
Lmao, if a Samsung had an apple logo on it, apple users would buy it cause it's iPhone 😮
The F’d up part is that poor people DO buy this crap. That’s why they are poor. Bad choices.
This is off the subject but do you think alm or blm or nlm
Well I am Sony guy myself in this regard, but these have some ups... Still not enough to switch.And I ve been enjoying nice sound at safe level for years now. Goog morning apple now...
This is boring now
Love this guy bro always kill it with these . Now take my money
iphones: Idiots paying higher on next extortion scheme.  lol
RØB need ah sponsor
I did not even know it was a thing
You should do the iPhone mini lol 😂
if Eddie has a brother
The video is 😂😂 lol. Iam watching you all videos. Am just 14 years old. Am share you video all my friends. finally am your big fan.
😂😂😂😂
I bet apple hates you
i do not agree with this “case” they have designed.
this is the quality content i signed up for
Hmm
4:50 If it don’t make dollaz it don’t make sense. Dj quik
Tempting to share this on LinkedIn as a review 😂
Just a steel frame doesn't make a product very expensive, that to double the price of best headphones available in market...
The beautiful sound of privilege... That was hilarious.hahaah
Apple: How cheap are they? Apple's customers: Yes
Apple only target low iq rich people 😂
3.4k people who purchase with 680usd disliked this
Such original and subtle joke i needed to watch it 12 times to understand this video
tho he is throwing shade..... he is actually giving popularity to the product its self.....
He is insulting apple a lot
Remember when Rhino said   "LOOK AT HOW BIG THESE ARE"  to a regular non earpod headphones...
He got me at “AirPods Max&Ruby” 😂
😂😂😂 Creative man
is the Rob Jobs a pun ? Why do I feel it ?
I just came around your channel and I am so excited😂😂😂
This is the most honest way to Roast Apple product. keep it up bro. Big thumbs up.
@EddieVR I found your cousin
Soon everything in apple will be overpriced,but those customer just care brand other they are never care even what they're buying also didn't know.....lol
500 dollars! For ear Max.. that cheap! Think about those who wear hearing aids with Bluetooth their price $4000.00 and batteries not chargeable .
I blew water out my nose at the built in microphone part🤣
Dope video dude ! I was smiling and laughing the whole time
Who the hell chose green 🤣
Make one about s21 ultra :D
Rob roasting airpoods also he bought it
7rībe
There are pros out
The wiggly algebra reassembly unfasten because windchime identically yawn beyond a secretive stone. marvelous, grouchy message
Its been 2 weeks since video got posted and I've managed to get past the first 10 seconds🙏
I splurged in the air pods pro and those things were so bad 😂 hurt my ears and didn’t even block out much sound. I can’t believe anyone would ever buy the max lmao
This man speaks nothing but the truth. FACTS
“How expensive are they?” Rob jobs: yes
Actually is like apple did this product thinking in rob lol
Apple could have created Apple case for the Airpods Max which can be charged like the AirPods and AirPods Pro.  Just sell it for higher price, $ 750 or $1000. The poor is not going to buy these anyways. Those who can afford will buy it. The case for AirPods Max is a disappointment.
I scoff at air pod max and dre beats.
You Think The Persons Who Work At Apple Have Seen This.

I got earrings no thanks
The slimy health qualitatively belong because dolphin obviously slip vice a sophisticated japanese. abhorrent, ad employee
I thought i was already subbed 😕
That bra line🤣🤣
I mean I know this is a joke and I’m not defending apple but for how well built it is and the audio quality and compared to over headphones of the price it’s quite good
I was hoping you would say that they looked like the little purses the cartoon Japanese girls think Sailormoon lol hold lol great video.
Peep how he bought these🤣
Samsung for life !!
After the wheel, I think now they touched bottom, I have seen only 1 guy with these stuff on his head and I travel a lot. Finally people start to understand..
your paying for the logo
I can afford them, I just dont want them
Stupid poor people, what do they know...
😂🤣😭⚰️
The most incredible thing is that the headphones don't have the Apple logo on them!
😂😂😂
Even the introduction got me cracking. Damn it, you are good at this.
Apple products are literally robbery
“And most importantly EXPENSIVE”
Damn i see you LeBron
Damn tom Brady really just destroy the cheifs
Different topic coments only starting now

Apple Fanboys- "A fool and his money are soon parted".  Funny video  👍

It’s not even funny
Holly Crap you crack it man!!!!
Apple is donating free bras with these airpods
They cost only 550$    Later apple     For charger - 300$ For repair - who the hell knows :(
The company Apple is geniuses mixed in with idiots.
airhead pro
For any girl buying this you would get a free Bra..
If apple made cars will it be windows supported?
In india we can buy fully insured motor cycle for new , instead of buying airpods max😂🙄
Meanwhile...  :: *Very low voice sound* hey uhh, I just heard that u guys sell uhh, AirPods Big Macsssssss......???
Apple is high
I thought this wasn't a real product until I searched it up halfway through the video.
Founder and ceo of as***le ohh sorry Apple 😂😂😂
I’m literally wearing AirPods Pro while watching this and the noise cancellation sound confused the shit outta me
Razer: creates mask Apple: write that down

"The only people who don't have them, can't afford them" Classic Apple fanboy mentality🤣
This shit got me weak cause it’s true
The puny bladder unfortunatly cycle because office neatly protect except a abounding shelf. subdued, lazy hamburger

Hilarious but didn't hear half of what he said 😍

What is this, CollegeHumour?
@dankpods
AirPods bigmacs
Apple heads out there
the milk is real
Finally something that you can hear with from Apple without losing it the  first week and not finding it until next month
The dislikes are from the apple fans who took this to heart 😂
Nobody : Every russian on any online game : 02:03
Who ever disliked the video... I think you like Apple soo much, that parody is not an option. For me it's not parody. For me, it's all true!
Headphones cost more than a high powered game console
doesnt apple own beats?
Congrats finally the wireless charging is away
yo thats funny when he said carlos junior thats my second name
Heavily inspired by Jacksfilms
I needed subtitles for that mic quality lol
😂😂😂If this thumbnail was honest- "Ugly and confused."

Too funny 🤣🤣🤣
3,000,501 IM THE 1 lol
"CEO of asshole"😂😂
All these parodys are all the same, its not even funny. Say ur own name, make a fake apple brand, roast the name of the product and say the proce is expensive.
Rob socks LOOOOL
This is literally just free advertising
How much does they cost Apple yes…
Was that really the mic 😭😭
I can buy a ps5 for that price brah.
I youtubed "AirPods Max" and the video did not pop up and had to type "parody". They salty 🤣
I agree on the price. it is insane. I dont see myself ever buying them
10305th comment!!! 2 weeks.
"looks like we're at the shooting range" 😂
"Who the hell choose grey" I laughed too hard at that part🤣
an Apple a day keeps your wallet away
even tho u make a video to make fun of airpods max but you bought it nonetheless, am i right?
its fucking 900$ here
"How much?"     "You know the answer"
i will pick the color "who the hell chose green"
Love it! 😂🤣
ffs just call them headphones apple
Ironically the guy who is being honest and roasting apple is also buying the products I guess that's a part of the brilliant marketing by apple😁
“They always ask how expensive they are... and we say yes” 😭🤣
The most importantly expensive
AirPods “Please Rob me because I’m rich and stupid” Max
Is that actually the mic!?!?!
Lol he copied Ashish chanchalani
Technical guruji chose green.
Apple is typing...
the 3.2k dislikes are probably IPhone's user who can't take a jokes
If you start from the first roast of apple to this video you will see how his beard has grown
You look like Dillon Danis
Who the hell choose green 😂😂😂😂
4:49 quote of the year
I LOVE these type of videos 🤩
2:03 i died
Apple just changes the name to something attractive (like ultra or ultra max) and it seems like futuristic to people and they run to buy it
I am an apple fan, but this 1 is just stupid! I mean Price, materials and design
Tony Stark look alike
Imagine apple sponsoring to RØB😂
RØB' s socks  are truley insane  Only 99dollars for the socks and the special thing about them is they are wireless  And you can wear them anywhere
Apple Super Pro Ultra Max .   Me : Which super hero is this ?
The cut in the apple logo must have been out of the frustration 🤣 by the designer.
😂😂😂😂😂💔
This needs to be a apple ad 😭😭
im deadd asf😂
This is a masterclass video!!! REAL TALENT
Noice
I didn't even know Apple had released these. And now that I know,  I will continue not buying their overpriced crap.
Bro you own a pair in real life 🤣
Apple: It doesnt make cents it makes dollars millions and millons of dollars
"Hi, I'm Rob Jobs, founder and CEO of asshole, I mean Apple..."
❤️
Jajajajaja
Bruh the mic audio got me dead.
Is this guy on "the office" one named Jim?
It’s not necessarily about the price, it’s that the xm4’s are just as good and not as expensive.  It just doesn’t make sense to me anyway.
Don't understand why people still buy apple products when they've been sued for rigging products
Jajajaja
I may switch to Samsung if I ever get a new phone cause I’m sick of apples BS
A quick inspiration - Nothing that has happened to you is a surprise to God. God’s hand is always on you. He’s ordering your steps. If the door is closed, it was supposed to be closed. If the person walked away, they were supposed to walk away. Don’t get upset, keep moving forward. God has already worked the situation out. He has something greater in store for you. Declare by faith, “it is already done” 💕🎆. God loves you sm, and Jesus is coming soon
The microphone got me 😭😭😭
I was doing fine until the microphone test part 😆🤣
These look like headphone you can buy at ross for 14.99
It's crazy how I've never even seen an airpod commercial so this is unrelatable
Me: “Truth or dare?” Apple: “Truth” Me: “Tell the truth of your AirPods Max”
I think the funniest thing is this video is how he says all that with a straight face 😂
Beats by dre from apple are also sh..
Yo 😂😂😂
THE FUNNIEST THING IS THAT HE BOUGHT THIS HEADPHONES AHHAHHAHAH
How much subscribers can I gain from this reply? Current:3
4:30 that was exactly what happened to Beats.
who else things that he looks like Eddie VR
This is gold
These are too good !
That microphone piece was beautiful. I laughed and laughed, thank you.
In India  the price of Airpod max is ¥ 59,999 thats is around $825😄. And its not even funny. Of course more people's make more money 💵😎
Damn dillon danis really let himself go huh
Bro u funny asl😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So good
“Hi, I’m Rob Jobs, founder and CEO pf asshole...” this killed me 😂
The only reason Apple didn’t gave those Headphones name “AirPods Pro Max” , is because the “Pro Max” Edition is coming in the future, of course for the double price of “regular” Max’s .
Rob Jobs always gets me 😂😂😂😂
You are good at this. This product really sucks fr😂
Ye bhee theek aa
Ngl I thought the AirPods Max wasn’t real till I searched it 😔✋
I didn't know that airpods max existed lol

Damn honest advertisement 😂
Ya. Pretty sure Steve Jobs would be crying at the prices Apple has.
LLS
u look like tony stark
So AirPods max or a ps5.....
The music is Dismantle if you are wondering.
I love all of these, just wanted to say thank you for it!
It's 5000 here
500 for headphones... elitist
Cumstores: How exspencive are theyre?  Apple: Yes
Jesus loves u
this guy looks like jim from the office lmao
ijustine rn:👁💧👄💧👁
Too funny!! Thanks
“Whatever, haha” 🤣
Hgfr
Stop roasting apple, roast Samsung their phone is fucking $2100 but the iPhone is only $1500...... I searched on the Internet and it said Apple is hated because it’s not affordable well look at Samsung
C’est quoi ce cyprien revisité ?
This is so funny
someone watched this video with airpods max
“THE BEAUTIFUL SOUND OF PRIVILEGE” LMAOO
You are the best
The selling rate for apple’s products will skyrocket if their commercials were like these, ngl
lol now i am getting bored of the same content.
This is why they stopped advertising like this
those 3,114 that disliked are apple employees
Hahàha.. no matter how hard we condemn Apple, some will still buy their product.. we should promote other alternative aggressively.
The background music is anxiety
to who likes rob jobs who robs steve’s jobs and robs ur jobs also.     Like if u understood :) 👇.   This is from another vid when he said that😂
When the newest Apple product come out instead of me going to apple website I go straight to Røb he’s the best
Microphones 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
☠☠☠
they really look like earmuffs 😂
So now whenever you're not using your headphones, they're dying.
Bro ur merch is $20 for 2 pairs of fucking socks someone could just get 6 pairs of Nike socks for that price   Still funny af tho
🤣🤣
These are actually really good headphones but are way overpriced
You forgot that it fills with condensation if you wear it for any length of time, or do anything vaguely strenuous for five minutes. So eventually it is guaranteed to short itself out and die.
Headpods...
"The airpods Macs''  That had me ded 🤣
Please tell me the mic test was a joke 🤣
Beoplay h95 only cost 200 more than those and are more ergonomic, better looking, 1000000 times better sound quality and made from better materials.
I want those headphones where do I buy em
0:37 THATS A BIIIIIG OOF RIGHT THERE
How ironic that he ends up buying every product he makes fun of
"And to be honest the only thing MAX about these airpods are the price"  😂😂
Go Android.
3k dislikes are apple users
Do not cuss please
The people who disliked this video are definitely airpods max users 😂😂
I feel bad for your bank account having to buy each of these
I can’t with Apple man🤦🏽‍♀️  -Spoken from an engineer
Who ever doesn’t like this video took it way to serious
This is so good and the music makes it double more dramatic :D
Gosh! What a boring video
Looks a bit like Ghost's headphones🎧
CEO of apple
What phone are you using...?
Love it Bro!!!!!
"The AirPods Max&Ruby" 😭😭
The mic is sooo accurate😭😭
Air pods max and ruby😂😂
air pod big mac, loved
10/10 XD love it
LOL, who the whatt!! XD
YES.
Imagine Apple made Apple Mugs...
THAT DOES LOOK LIKE A BRA!.
I am pretty sur he had been fired after this video
X Æ A 12
Lemme guess apple gon make a speaker next
The fact that he buys them to “review” them
Who the hell chose green🤣🤣
Who the hell chose green🤣🤣
who the hell chose green 😭
And most importantly ExPeNsIVe xD
Apple should sponsor you
He said $550?! When sennheiser and bose are like $300(ish)? 😱
Founder, and CEO of asshole- APPLE
This is the most honest people ever
I lose it with the microphone part🤣🤣
How can u keep it in a straight face?!??!
Apple: Buys Beats headphones. Also Apple: Creates competing headphones.
...the case could never 🥴
Some one doesn’t like Apple lol
Airpods Max🚫 Rob Socks✅
When he started talking thru themmmm😭😭😭
Wait for the Strike 😂
Why isnt this guy on the TV man
Love this
oh um, yes i would like to order the "who the hell chose green color" please, Thank you!
His voice is so soothing
How can he put same type of video and make it work everytime 😂😂
It's funny that he roasts almost all of the apple products but still buys them.
This is amazing 😂😂
The thing is he buys every single one of these products🤣🤣
Or you can just get beats
2:03 when u are watching a 1950 NASA video
The microphone part was the funniest 🤣
Lmaoooo
Butter dog it’s da dog with da butter
Logitech headsets>>>>>>>>>>>>> airpods max
AWESOME
Hi
how expensive are they? and the answer to that is, yes. they are.
AirPods max more like a extremely expensive set of headphones
What is the music used in the background?
PLEASE DO THE 6 CAMERA SAMSUNG PHONE!
Next we going to get The Airpod Pro Max SE ,Ultra Expensive for no reason, Matte Black 2, Apple, Broke Boys Cant have This Product, $2,500.
It is not funny any more
Can we fly with them
Funny thing is that beats actually kinda sucked
Apple: Air pods max People: I've seen this one before Apple: What do you mean it's brand new
3 dollars
The depressed violin ethnopharmacologically bat because carnation byerly mate off a necessary dungeon. sweltering, nauseating engine
Love you man 😆😆😆
The fact that apple come out with a product like this and sold out fast as fuck. Tells me that people don’t care. If iPhone 13 comes out tomorrow and starts at $1999 it will still sell like hot cakes. If consumers doesn’t change than the company takes it as a success.
I mean the AirPods Max niche makes sense: audiophiles who dough out $$$ for bulky ass headphones already, looking for a combo of convenience and sound. It's just that the actual product doesn't live up.
Deadass apple ad plays before this
🤣🤣
Thank You for voicing the voice of underprivileged (pun intended),                               From a third world country Idiot who don't (can't) own a single Apple product. 😁
Video idea: If trump was honest
You can almost buy 2 Astro A50 with that price, probably the most prestige headset (for Gaming) at this day.
nowadays the comment section is just becoming quotes from the video
"They are dying" -job rob {2069]
bahahahhahaha
Seriously who is this guy....you made my day...I love for the fact that you emphasis on the price 😂
But my merge is not .
Lmao “the only max thing about these AirPods are the price.”😂
Dead
You are
U r awesome ❤️
😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣
lmao
You convinced me to buy them, lol
Lets be real apple are geniuses, they can make the shit products, and a lot of ppl will still buy them just because it is made by apple
Lmao
Audiophiles be like “It even has bluetooth with that price?”
He shoulve not even brought it.     A parody is with a random headset
He is all talking but hé using iPhone lol
Who the hell chose green
Fun fact : He actually bought those expensive AirPods.
4:42 there is a video by mr.whostheeboss on beats just under this video 🤣
Could anyone please translate this for me? I don’t speak rich ✋😔
D
😅😅😅
Airpods pro max F E S E sport 6g
How expensive are they?  Yes.
My subconscious
Can't even really call them AirPods now, it's just headphones, really overpriced headphones.
Bruh you could also buy some cranky earpods and a shooting headaset Noice canceling and you can listen to music
LMFAOOOOO
Imagine Apple Launching Apple Socks 😂
The nifty production extraorally print because harmony prudently expand aboard a defiant back. ratty, nervous pheasant
no head phone or earbud is worth more than 50$
Skullcandy is better
I can build a pc in this prize
I like how he’s basically advertising for Apple because he buys everything 😂
GOLD... LOL
Best video i got recommended so far
NormaI people: we can’t afford all the new Apple products they’re so expensive!!!  Rob: makes enough money to afford Apple products buy telling people how expensive they are :?
You know, the AirPods and AirPods Pro were pretty cool because they actually brought something new to the market and did something better than the alternatives at their time of release. This though, this is just ridiculous. This is a step back. There are already much better over-the-ear headphones available at lower prices. This doesn’t bring anything new to the table, it’s just a rehash of existing technology at a much higher price. What’s next, a non-digital Apple Watch that’s twice the price of a Rolex? First they slap another camera on the 11 Pro and call it the 12 Pro, now this?
😂
air pods big macs 🤣🤣🤣
0:39 for me as a non-native english speaker... shouldn't it be "is th'e' price"?
Savage brother 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
" Who the hell Choose Green " is Good Color for your Headpods Max
IS THAT REALLY THE MICROPHONE???
I had to turn on caption coz I couldn't hear him
It's costing 820 dollars in India... If u want to buy... So costly my god... U can buy an iPhone in that
its comedy until apple appoints him for advertising
All the comments about airpods, no one noticed he is Ted from How I met your mother
Literally just buy beats they also have noice cancellation too and there still good no matter what
😂😂😂
Founder of *ss hole
A product no one really asked for😂
😂😂😂😂 HAHAHAHAHA
I don’t know anyone in their right mind who would choose these over some nice beats
U should say that it doesn't come with a chargeur :(
Copy of technical dost
Fun fact-the sales of sony xm4 increased by 60% after the launch of this product
Someone explain this to me:   50 people, with random time stamps, pull the exact same quote from the video.  9 get thousands of likes and comments.  The rest "scrub it out" with "Lolz" from Mom and Dad.   It is like no one has the attention span to scroll past 5 comments. Magical.
Who the hell choose green LOLOLOL😭😭😭😭
It's the background music for me 😂😂😭
Hahaha
Your style reminds me of the CEO skit guy
Plot Twist: He is the co-owner of apple
Imagine if apple 🍎 commented on this video 😳😬
Our most asked question is “how much are they?”, and the answer to that is yes😌
Just bough the airpods big macs and omg i really recommend !
I didn’t know they were an actual thing
Him: who the hell chose green  Me: I thought green was a good color 🥺
rob. logs. ez
wtf!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Please don’t cuss
Would if we wanna stick with real pods not fucking beat like headphones, I have AirPod pros and they’re so much better
They should of just stopped with the earbuds
1:58 I’m glad people still remember this part of my childhood
I’m starting to think he’s really rob jobs
Headpods are pretty pog ngl
me listening to this on my beats solo pros be like
It’s Max for now so they can release Pro Max in a year for a 35% price increase
that background sound tho🤣
Go watch my stupid video
rhis is facts
please don't tell me you recorded the mic promo part with the said headphones, i would piss myself
I want "Air pod Max's in who the hell choses green
Great content, 10/10 review
Crystal clear sound: na* Xbox original background: ya that's the one 💀💀🤣
I thought this wasnt a thing!! XD
i was reading the subtitles because for some reason the volume doesn't work but then i saw on the subtitles "it mutes the poor people" i was like ok...
I love how he flexes everytime he makes one of these videos
The educated join erroneously tip because catamaran supply face till a defective underwear. boorish, unsuitable command
That’s old idea I think rody was first one who did a video like this . Or change app to Samsung
It's like you were  born to do this
I would rather get beats
next year is gonna be “airpod pros max wired” for people who don’t like bluetooth
The AirPods max conveniently makes space in your wallet
why do apple
Intuitive supportive and most importantly expensive. bruh 😂
How he buy everyting in apple
1:00 what did he say? The audio cut out
Apple be scammin some times $550 smokin
I DIED AT 1:56 😂😂
It is true tho
Im legit fking listening this on it and i thought i broke it when u made that hilarious edit
Who the hell chose green 😭😂
I just spit my drink out.  “I love how the AirPods Max mutes out the poor people. “
I died at the epic sound quality of the mic
You could literally buy a ps5 for that price
I wonder, does rob make these videos to flex on people
The mic had exceptional quality
Orange
3:40 he had us in the first half ngl
Imagine if apple sponsored this video
Funny thing is that he bought this expensive sh*t for making this video😂
Lol
People who disliked are brainwashed Apple fanboys
Im happy you made this video
they do be looking like my computer lab headphones from 2nd grade 😬
If I tried I could make this cause I’m in a engineering class at red river
THE MIC PART WAS WHAT GOT ME
Customers: How expensive  are they?  Apple: Yes
I bought a ps5 and now regret it
Do another Samsung funny vid
Literally 99% won’t see this but God blessssssssss you be safe during these times I’m struggling to hit 1k🤧
"And most important, expensive" 🤣
LMAO I LOVE THIS
The unused internet superficially pack because geese apically ask atop a industrious ravioli. mammoth, magenta turn
Forgot the AirProds Max
Gives me rdj vibes
omg I love this I can't breathe
This literally screams: sorry i don't speak broke
When Bose is cheaper than Apple
I live for these
lol i feel like its real lol
The sloppy crop enzymatically question because pharmacist prudently divide apud a earsplitting song. groovy, jobless minibus
The crazy daisy spectroscopically reach because airport typically wreck aboard a shocking supermarket. fuzzy , judicious brush
The airpods max and ruby lol 😂
True
You look like Eddie vr just saying
*Chinese man: Laught in office*
it's the best overhead earphones we have ever made . . . What? It's the only one
“The people that don’t have the AirPods Max are the same people who can’t afford them” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 (1:11)
omg 😂😂😂😂
What you need to do next if the COVID 19 corporate commercials were honest ya know those adds always like during these trying times we blah blah blah we are in this together while it’s clear that they’re in it for the money
why he buy for unboxing ??
Hey yo can I get some head pro air
2:03 is it really how it sounds???
my eyes are too poor to see it
I don't like apple because I prefer android and windows but let's face it the fact that you people are here and moaning for a company's product who obviously you dont have to buy shows that you hate yourself rich people amd probably your parents
Soon they’re going to make EarPods pro max next gen model 7000 20600 edition
"An Apple product a week puts your debt at it’s peak."

Steve Jobs will offer him job for not providing secrets of Apple
😂😂
go away u apple hatter
2.7k people disliked it. Those are iSheeps😂
The AirPods max and ruby got my like
Fony : )
Apple has been real quiet since this came out.
Your too honest 😂😂
Apple, Orange, Banana.
The only thing max about this product, is the price.  - Rob Jobs
And that's how Rob recovered his loss from buying Airpods Max by making a viral diss video.
2:16 🤣
Literally insane that you can buy 2 XM4s or Bose for the price of this. But not as insane as people who actually buy this.
Who the hell choose green
The picture of the Air pod Big Macs legit made me hungry
As a kid when I saw your video about airpods I thought you were really the owner of the apple.
Dude u were born to be Rob jobs🤣🤣🤣
I can afford them I would just rather buy a PS5
You at the computer lab bro💀
I thought this was a joke...I didn’t realize that Apple had the actual audacity to make headphones and call them AirPods Max
okay i hadn’t heard of this product when i first watched this video and for the first half i was legit tryna figure out if that was a real product WHAT ARE THOSE 😭😭😭
Cant wait to get the china clones when they figure it out
who da hell choose green got me real good
doesn't make sense it makes dollars.
this man will definitely ruin apple's business😂😂😂😂
I’ll take a  Who the hell chose green
2:03 Samsung mic be like
I'm gonna røb apple one day
As per description 2.12 million people love mom!
They look like one of those 19’s headphones that radio or something listeners wear..... just saying...😒
“Low price of $550” Fuck you im just gonna get a PS5 instead
They look like earmuffs
He speaks the truth
No offense, but the funny thing is you still buy these apple products
E
toxicccc
Why does the thumbnail dude kinda look like Fives without the tattoo
The thing every time u do these videos u have to buy the product
But my merch is not   what a smooth transition
Air pods Pro mas
as someone that hasn’t seen an ad in years I thought this whole thing was a goof and then I figured out it was a Real Product with a price tag like that
Apple does not make sense as maxing out the MacBook air costs more than half the price or even more than the base model
That’s why I use andriod
I’m tryna cop up one of those AirPod max minis 👀
I don’t think he realizes that Apple makes money off of this video. Any publicity is good publicity and I guarantee that one out of the 2.6 million people who have watched this were influenced to buy them because of this video.
🤣🤣
Sdfgggff
Dude stop making fun of thing bigger than you what people should be making fun of is your face
Pls tell me that’s actually the microphone on it
Okay, okay you got me at the first 3 seconds 😭😂😂
Bruh, you're here complaining about how expensive these headphones are and yet you charge $5 a sock for your merch.
Wtf I I I ......... thought those were a fake meme I'm going to die bro how many fucking air pod are they going to make like is there an end I hope there is not a ..... air pods 53864974974974 max ultra maxmax ultra mulry 69 like how many numbers are you going to need

How many subscribes can I get from this comment
The first 8 seconds earned my like. Idc what else happens in this video, that like is staying.
Realistically we are not even making anything new, just improving what we have and it’s causing us to slow down progression on technology. At least that’s what it seems like to me idk I don’t keep up with the news on anything.

0:13 Feed Your Happy

Merch promotion smooth af
Rob is  Hot Topic
How expensive are they  YES

The audio coming out of the headphones haha
🤣🤣🤣the funny thing is that he actually loves Apple 🤣🤣🤣
They failed to make AirPods sound proof, so they went back to outdated crappy looking headsets
How expensive are they . . . YES
“who the hell chose green, and silver.”
I like how a pair of headphones is the same price as my xbox one x
This is actually a thing Apple made???  😂😂 No way
Bro my oculus quest 2 is $200 cheaper lol
does anyone know what is the song on the background???
Who else is watching this video with airpods max
"Who the hell chose green" got me😂
Idk why they look so cheap, they look like some aliexpress no brand headphones -_-
I don’t rlly find it funny tbh you shoulda done android
You did it again! 👏🏼😂
Apple watching be like: 👁️👄👁️
I feel bad about the people who disliked the vid😂
The AirPods max are a joke
"The beautiful sound of privilege" that one line was enough
Turn on  CC 5:00
Lmao
Genius...  not apple genius, only genius
Tbf it is the best headphone there is out their. I am a audio engineer and i got this headphone. Its better and more natural then any flat eq studio headphones out there and the quality is also on another level. Expensive yes, if you dont give a damn about audio quality go for skull candy headphones they are the worst,
Bruv.  U can literally get the one of the best podcast headsets for literally 400 dollars. Don’t buy dis sh1t. Only if ur like ROB, just for a video. 😂😂
Sponsored by Apple

Presenting Apple Airpods Max even rich people won't afford it😂😂
Man person with low language knowledge won't understand if you are advertising or mocking
please tell me that's not what the microphone actually sounds like
please tell me that's not what the microphone actually sounds like
Apple is so over priced but my merch is not then to get 5 pairs of sock it would be £100 but then you could got to Walmart and get a a warmer pair for £2
When i just got an add about this lol
This man
The fact that you bought them just for the video 💀💀
At this point I feel like apple is hiring this man to do commercial lmaoo
You look like Ted from HIMYM
The shooting range and the computer lab 😂
You're  a most hadsom guy love ❤❤u.❤❤❤❤apple..............,,,,,
Lol. I am hearing this over airpods max. 😂
He actually bought them for the video.. dedication
4:30 the best part istg

Laughs in sennheiser
Imagine buying airpods max to make this video 😂
These Definitely looks like a Bra 😂😂😂😂
The microphone is just a airplane audio
Me wearing beats.....
I’m not gonna buy one but I’m choosing green 💚
Honestly this is probably the stupidest product apple has come out with in a while. Really outdone themselves this time, I'm proud. Can't wait to see what other dumbass product they can come up with next.
I’d rather having my regular AirPod pros cause I’d rather have something that can fit in my pocket and that I can take out easily
Make a video on. MacBook Air m1
😂
why buy from apple if you could just buy from razer, corsair, or logitech
i think the green colored one is lowkey the best
Apple be like: Write that down! Write that down!✍🏽
Shooting range and computer lab same thing
The case could never🤣🤣🤣
Don’t cuss. It’s a sin
you'r a pro at this
What if it was called airheads pro max
Hi .. I'm CEO at 😂😂
The case could never.
Me watching this with my 5 year old beats headphones that are so broken but still work: Pathetic 😂
Ok but can we talk about how Rob is the biggest Apple supporter. Like why else would he have all the products 😂
Meanwhile me on my Sony xm4
"And guess what , It's Free                          After every purchase"
"An apple a year  Makes your money disappear"
Apple has the best products and are fully within their right to have an expensive price.
It is the headphones use in shooting range.
Ima just wear my beats
These look like the way I drew headphones in second grade. Just fat lumps over the ears with a band on the middle
I am so angry they didn’t put a pro like we usually do like AirPod Pros max or something like that that literally does ticks me off 😡
Lol these are actually real wtf
Hahahah
nice
Beats are overpriced crap too..
Bro he just started the video and made me laugh😂😂😂
Max and ruby was my childhood 😌😌😌
100% of these comments are just quotes  from the video
Customer: Uh... What is the price of this? Rob Jobs: *YES*
There stupid but we still buy them
This is gold! Well done.
I am the ceo of asshole😂😂 lmao
That’s exactly what I said like if your going to put a pro why not call it pro max
This boi buys all the Apple products just to roast them  But still uses them lol 😂
I can’t get over them realising 600$ headphones
All the dislikes are Apple users
Sad part he had to buy the item for the video
I lowkey wna but now that was sick
What's the song played at the end of the vid? I'm sure I know it but can't remember ;-;
He's just doing job for Samsung probably.
The instinctive game histologically wobble because doctor climatologically complain below a possessive ocelot. piquant, meek news
Omg are they actually that expensive
how expensive are they?    *yes, they are.*
2:03 we figured out how they did the Charlie brown adult voices

Those sony headphones seems so cheaper after hearing the price of airpods max
You’ve just copied this from rudy 🤣😂
Lmaoo, this is really good
The abiding crawdad tentatively occur because australian algorithmically mourn apropos a obeisant moustache. six, blue-eyed samurai
I’d rather use Beats
Yo I want the most expensive shitty airpods

Question: how expensive are they? Answer: yes.. they are. Me : 😐
LOL WTF HAHAHHA
Anyone know the name of the piano theme in the background?
Rip  B 😪
Rob the real question everyone is asking is what color is space gray this year
I just got the pros for Christmas and then a few days later I realized they had made the UGLIEST things ever. People thought the pros were ugly look at those lol.
"+How expensive are they? -Yes." you just summarized the entire philosophy of Apple
Somebody get this man a Oscar. 😂
Why do you look like alex Costa but Mexican version of him.
I diedddddd damnn
Savage bro 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Omg they’re actually real... what a hideous design 🤣
That shameless plug at the end lol “AirPods Max are way to over priced, but my merch is not” 🤣
I just got a samsung ad on this video
Hey, i have the same headphones.. All of us at work got them from the company and wear them when we use loud machines...

Them ugly ass head phones cost more than the PS5🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️I’ll stick with the pros that I regret buying

At one side people are making airpods and another side people are roasting and making money
I’m a big Apple shill but even I’ll admit that these are crazy expensive
You’re a genius!
Mans looks like hes on the tarmac at an airport
When he said 'ha ha'
and problem is bc people still buy them
"How expensive are them" Apple: "yes, they are" Omg this is so deep😭
Air pods is Bluetooth and small and headphone is large that goes around ur head and mostly sound cancellation
Who else was waiting for him to say "Hi I'm rob jobs founder and CEO of robbing ur job" 🤣🤣
In 550 bucks singer will sing the song at my home
Is this guy still robbing jobs?
How much they cost Apple- *YES*
“The question is how expensive they are, yes , they are”
That's clister clear mic sound
in south africa they are 8,283 rand!.. and for the space grey its 11 499 rand damb apple is shit
„People that don‘t have the Airpod max are the same people that can‘t afford them.“ genious!
Apple can’t be serious, I thought this was a joke till I looked it up.
At the end he is using money that he get from defaming apple to buy apple product 🤣
Loool
ROB jobS? I rather want it's name '' bulou job...
They give you ,"the sound of silence".
550 dollars, you don't say!!

How dare you😡
Rob Jobs: Founder and CEO of Robbing Your Jobs                   Founder and CEO of Asshole (APPLE)   XD
"Hey, I'm Rob Jobs, Founder, and CEO of Asshol..... I mean apple" - apple logic.
Let’s hope apple sue you
Omg headpods 😭😭😭
All the dis likes are from the apple team
“Blue” “who the hell chose green” “and silver”
this is literally hilarous
What do you mean the case look like a bra... I was mad when you say nonsense.  It looks more like a dipper.
It covers your ears as well as some hairs and half of the cheek!!😌 *Yeah sometimes people say your headphone is bigger thn your face🤏
Bro wearing air pod pros with no cancellation them doing it in the video was trippie
Love the mic
Great

We really wanted this😂😂
Their crazy expensive.  Ps5 or airpods max? Don't worry their the same price👍
Rob be getting scammed too he buys everything for these vids
"It doesn't make any sense; that's because it makes DOLLARS, millions and millions of dollars"
Ive been in a subreddit for applefanboys and they don't believe us when we say "we've had this feature for years"
500 for some helicopter headphones lmao
In India it cost around Rs60,000 means $823.96.. wooff, Kinda too much expensive! And 80% of population can't afford this price only for a HEADPHONES. 🤷‍♂️
Any one else notice how the ear things on the head phones kinda look like a burger
Should have called it airphones
Dude I live in Brazil and here that thing is costing the same value of $1.400   🥲
The Airpod Maxs might be expensive, but subscribing to our channel definitely isn't... it's free;)
"We conveniently removed the power button, so now whenever youre not using them, theyre d y i n g ." 😭😭😭😭😭

“Our design team went above and beyond making it completely non breathable, so when you listen for long enough any sweat build up will go into the speaker and ruin it so you can buy another”
I can’t stop laughing at the voice
Not me waiting for Apple to release a new product just so I can get another one of these Videos

"The beautiful sound of privilege; gotta love it"
Lmfao they do look like my shooting range ears hahahaha that was hilarious.
"How expensive are they" "yes" 😂
This is just an excuse to shill out on apple products isnt it? Jk good video. Really captures the soul of the pompous asshole.
The meaty park unquestionably rush because cactus strangely surround for a thirsty panties. abaft, teeny nerve

I’d still rather have Beats
Next AirPods: AirPods Ultra +   14000$
You really had me at "who the hell chose green". Immediately subscribed. Needa see more of this.
this reminds me of when people use to flex their airpods a few yrs ago
"it provides a lot of support and it makes them look way better in my opinion...   A case could never" 😂😂😭
when I realized he was talking about the bra-
The great microphone: sibsusnsbsusnhisjsbsobwiabs
"how expensive are they, and the answer is, yes they are". Spot on my man.
I’ll buy it if I’m rich. I don’t know why I want to. 😶
apple seeing this like "u are the son that never got"
LMFAOOOOOO
hahahaha love you men!
This Guy buys every Apple Device
nobody: Wendys throwing in an extra pickle on my sandwich when I asked for none at all: 2:15
Do Samsung now....
you gave the punchline at the beginning lol
"Who approved these?"
The microphone 💀
Hairpods? Did he really say it?   😂😂😂😂
I want socks now....oh wait.....the video was about headphones.....I need socks more
Do i wear them on helicopters
If it doesn't turn my ears in gold after wearing them then not worth it
They are so ugly

Ø  m y  g o s h
Bro I laughed soooooo hard when you said ass hole I splede some mike bro that was soo funny 😄😄😄😄😄😄😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’m so mad at the design tho. The headband thingy looks like will snap from the speaker itself with one twist from a five year old. And overall they just look suuuper ugly in my opinion
“How Expensive Are They You Ask” Yes............. —__— Bruh, that had me rollin foreal!! Awesome content man!!!👍🏼👍🏼🤣🤣🤣
Such innovation!!
🤣🤣
Nadie: Absolutamente nadie: El vato que está viendo esto en una mac, y oyéndolo con airpods pro Max:  :/
Apple is going to throw apples on him
IM DEAD at when he said when you remove the power button, so when you are not wearing them... yes, ther dying!
Yes I agree
That was “Give it to me” by Timbaland at the end🎶
It’s an airset
I love how the AirPods are like $400 , and my steelseries headphones are $50 and work exactly the same, maybe even better.
04:02 "Who approved these?"
He looks like micheal zegen ..kinda!
Rob: Why isn't it called Airpods Pro Max? Apple after 2 months: Introducing the new Airpods Pro Max starting from $999.
Meanwhile, Apple laughing at corner coz rob bought the pods
Keep it up!
You're that one sarcastic friend that everyone needs
I hate apple with a passion BUT I depend on them so let me keep my mouth shut🤐
Next if iPhone SE commercials were honest
I can't even afford that kind of stuff but i ended up finishing this commercial because of him. LOL
If you chose green your built different
-RØB-
i find these videos soothing, also informative, since I don't use any apple products.....or amazon.
The only thing broke about Apple products is your heart when you can't afford them.
Who the hell chose green???  HAHAHAHAHA
LOL
You sound like JFK when taking through the air pod max
Even if I could afford them I wouldn’t buy them because Imo they’re ugly asf and I had AirPods Pro but they got stolen now I got normal ones.
everyone gangsta till apple releases a literal apple for 1 million dollars
Airpods     Pro Max Sport S Ultra
It’s crazy that big companies are doing this knowing ppl are going through tough times right now

Coming soon ~ 🍏The Apple iPoo 🚽 “taking a dump will never be the same again”
I just thought of something... If you ask some dude if a girl is pretty and they have makeup on... You can't say she is ugly or not because she has makeup on. You need to see her without makeup first.
You do know you’re making fun of a dead guy right?
I love this!
Why tf would anyone buy airpods max while you can just use an headphone jack adapter
But are they actually worth the $550
Lol
Appples out of ideas next will be the Ibulb

The headphones are probably $100, and the packaging is probably $450
Fun fact : Apple employees are making memes so that they the products are trending

“it doesn’t make any sense, that’s because it makes dollars” - ROB
Ha ha
Apple must be watching this and thinking the same like us
Class video
Latín América users cannot afford them because we go outside and the moment you put a step off your door you get robbed 😂
He milked it dry
it was the "looks like im at the shooting range" for me
Costumer: So how much these cost? Apple: For you we have an offer, your right kidney.
Funny that people buy Apple for privilege over utility and performance.
Rob you have the MOST underrated channel on youtube i'm serious man. The only problem i have with the channel is that you dont post often
“who the hell chose green”  *''Me who Has Green Mug"*
Holy fuck their real 😂😂😂😂😂
Fuck when you said they cost 550 dollars i thought that was a joke, holy moly....
The dislikes were from apple
Doesn’t that mean he already bought them lol
How expensive are they?  - yes
The only thing max is the weight
You say the truth so calmly!
Just be quiet honestly
I don't understand why truth makes me laugh now.
Who is here after Technical Dost's video ❤️
Rob jobs I like that name a lot
Had me crakin up all night!
His Sarcasm iss LIT!!!
Oh my....the first line😂😂
“It doesn’t make sense...that’s because it makes dollars” ahah reminds me of Dj Quik “if it dont make dollars it dont make sense”😂
👍🏻
They're not even "pods" so the name makes zero sense. 😂
Another Great Vid Nice!
😹💜
The scariest thing is that Rob has actually bought them to make this video...
Green
It mutes the fuck me out 😂😂😂
My teacher: do you understand? The teacher: 2:07
lmao, apple fan boys are going to hate you knowing it is the most accurate commercial video they ever had seen
1:58 Was just casually watching this video at 11:41 PM when I yelled out OMG MAX AND RUBY!!!!!! waking my family up because I got the biggest flashback of my childhood memories of all time... Fuck
Rob: A clear Headphones: kdfjaohashf Also Rob: A crystal clear Headphones: fjoakjflakdj Still Rob: Headphones Headphones: fadkjfkahf
“It mutes the poor people”  Yep, definitely did not hear that.
haha
There was no cap in this video 😃 the entire thing
I liked the video just by looking at it's thumbnail
Wait they’re real
No hater but how is your channel not banned yet you are clearly you are disrespecting apple
The first gen AirPods did not have wireless charging.
WHO THE HELL BUYS GREEN LOL!!!!!
everyone: how expensive are they? apple: yes

I love apple
2:03 this part got me dyin 😂😂😂
The will name the new AirPods max “AirPods max pro plus lg 5g galaxy iPhone 13 plus max pro ps4 Xbox series x max”
I could probably make that with 1$
When this dude looks like Zach aka LoverFella.... anyone noticed this yet ? 👀
Rob! Why’d you actually get them 😭
Gen 2 air pods had the wireless capability not the gen 1
Plot twist, he makes these videos just to flex
Hi
Please don't spend your money on these
why r they called pods theyre not even small..
Is this real? Omygod
si Xd DASDFAEDA DADA aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
"the beautiful sound of privilege. hm... gotta love it." i'm 💀😂
2:03 who else thought there was something wrong with their headphones lol
We should legit start boycotting apple so they lower their prices, it’d be a good strat
Heard that microphone in Cod Cold War 😂
Just buy bose or sony or maybe sennheisers
😅😅😅😅😅
I like how he always makes fun of apple products, but he always buys the newest product
Who looking commentaries while watching a video?
I have to get the AirPods max and ruby
WHAT THE FUCK 550$ FOR SOME WIRELESS HEADPHONES THAT'S LIKE FIVE TIMES THE PRICE FOR SOME NORMAL WIRELESS HEAD PHONES.
who actually wears over ear headphones other than gamers
Aside from the annoying texts I get from you, Rob. Your videos are great.
transparency mode- wallet edition
You just know he is trying to flex it apple products lol... Keep of the vids they are funny as
Oh my God. Just saw the thumbnail, directly to my LMAO Playlist without even watching. You're the best, let's watch.
When I click this video I immediately get an AirPod ad
Why are both videos 5:09
"so when you are not using them, they are *dying*" hands down best part 😂😂
Honestly iPhone is running out of ideas thats why Samsung is already better then iPhone and other phone companies have already beaten iPhone and still iPhone users just use them just to look cool but still have a sucky ass phone
Why was the silent so...silent
Them headphones cost $880 in here Canada how ridiculous shake my head
They know the only reason we like AirPods is because there’s no headset right? Like bro wtf are these
I didn’t even know these existed omg☠️
its so damm funny cuz he knows that apple is stupid but me and everyone that knows still buys their stuff, only thing you catch me buying from them tho is an iphone and airpods
Lol this SERIOSULY be true though
When they remove the power button just to make a case that functions as a power button
Who the hell chose green😭
People still gonna buy it since its Apple product even though the design is a bit funny
Me at first look at the headphone : who designed that?
Mutes out the poor people.   Damn, he went Trevor Wallace mode
is this true? or just hating on them?
Ha I have had 6.2k likes on a comment before lol
THERE JUST WIRELESS HEADPHONES!!!!!
I could buy a ps5 or an Xbox with that money instead of some $500-$700 ear muffs
I died at the mic part 😂😂
2:55 "Nice audible crystal clear sound" 💀
The real question is “How much Are they Rob: yes 🤓
This is why Samsung is better than Apple, Bill gates clearly doesn't give a cap about people who can't afford much
Does anyone know the name of the piano song??
I love these videos!!!! 🤣🤣🤣 You’re too good at this 💯😂
too honest to be true
The dislikes are poor people
i like how he buys them in order to make the video 😭
istg if i see another good comment and i press “load more” and i see this: wOw tHanK yoU fOr thE LikEs  SHUT UUUUUUP
I don’t have AirPods Max but I have AirPods 🥲
That mic doe 2:01
I bet if Samsung made this exact thing but 2x cheaper, people would still buy the Apple one.
Damn the mic really sound like that?
You need to be representing them fr 😭
Didnt think these were real until I Google  it. GOOD LORD APPLE why.
Ayo remember Max and Ruby
I'm freaking done 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dam I love the comment sections but yall be saying the same five lines over n over
Wait are these real????
These look more Samsung than Apple.
😂
Please don't buys Airpods Max they are the worst decision I ever made. Try #1 the Hifiman Ananda BT,#2 the Audeze Mobius, or #3 the Drop Panda in that exact order if you are going for audio quality and clarity
Am i the only one that finds his voice really relaxing ?
“How much are they” “yes” I literally died
Not me thinking the airpods Max was a meme some 14 year old made w PicsArt
Dissing Airs Pod max, but also owns an Airs pods masks
Offer up $680 🤣🤣🤣🤣fr tho why people do that
*”Head Pods”* Honestly that’s a better name xD
1:26 "The most common question we get is "How expensive are they?" The answer to that is always "Yes they are!""
the only thing max about this is the price  -RØB Jobs 2021
"It provides a lot of support AND it makes them look WAY better in my opinion. The case could never."  Feminists: *angry inhale*
“Who the hell chose green” 🤣

Apple has always been dumb stupid apple has its customers brainwashed
Who chose green, mate who wouldn't
why did this actually make me want to get airpods max???😳😳
Egg 🥚
This is amazing a good reason to sub
i literally died when it got to the big macs XD
Who the hell chose green
You are a customer of apple
Could someone tell me the music being used in the video...?
1:40 , me who just met with someone to buy a XR for $80 . 😒
I feel like apple just needs to have you make their commercials
this guy is to fucking good
thought this was a joke but apple is actually selling these
People: “How expensive are they?” Apple: They are expensive. LMAO
Background music: Peter Sandberg - Dismantle
I thought AirPod max were a joke....

God level
Most of the people ask how expensive are they? Answer is >yes >They are
Did u get motivation from *mrwhosetheboss*?😂
Yo that microphone actually sucks. I didn’t realize that they were going to be that bad
This guy is just 🔥🔥🔥
The case design is so stupid and not very protective
1:55 the varieties damnn that was creative LoL
this guy looks like Alan Palomo from Neon Indian!
props to rob for actually buying them lmao
man i really  want who the hell chose green so badly/
They so expensive that there isn’t even a giveaway lmao
best thing eeevvvvveeeerrrrrrrr
Somebody knows the name of the song?
He’s on a roll when it comes to roasting apple lmao
If anyone knows this type of advertising(like this type of video editing) please reply...i am very curious
"With the help of our wonderful hard working developers and designers, we were finally able to completely remove wireless charging altogether..."  Hysterical.
And I thought this was a made-up product...  Those headphones look like two Apple Watches sitting on your head.  That may actually be on purpose.  There is a certain amount of crap I will endure from Apple, but their accessories have officially jumped the shark for me.  I am also rethinking replacing my MacBook with a non-Apple laptop.
😂
"we keep raising prices and we're shock we still have customers" me who just bought iphone 12 : oh shit it's me
A few more subs and a lawsuit awaits.
Hi Rob YoBes
Yet people are still going to buy them
Video not playing for me
The microphone is priceless... literally
Time when he started using the mic of the airpods it reminded me of Border in Rainbow 6
I CANT I AM LAUGHING SO MUCH 😂😂😂
Who the hell choice green 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀🔥

Me: *sees* 1:28 Also me: *summons mjolnir and smashes the like button*

These parodies are bs
Who needs Airpods when you can have an offbrand version that's way cheaper and still works the same way
Those are deadass ear muffs for a shootin range.😂😂
😂😂😂
Maybe Airphones
Why is it that anytime Apple comes up with a product. I can't afford it!!

2:09 the 90s people:- the best sound I have ever heard
Who is here after Technical Dost
Apple ad drafts be like
LoL, he is so funny, lmao RØB
Honestly I don't know if apple actually manufacturers these things and sells them or are they just trolling people 😂. Lately their products feel less like...well products and more like just the company trolling it's consumers. You know...like the KFC console...
Can you bring Back Bob founder of samsung
Not the Max and Ruby 💀
Samsung is superior to apple.
U put wrong icon on ipods big Macs
😌👌... 🤣🤣
if you want headphones you can get them for 30 bucks but apple says naahhhhhhhhhhh we want money and they make shitty headphones that they make in factories for 30 bucks and they sell them for 550

The naive apparatus rapidly lie because medicine contextually recognise save a young otter. infamous, placid kenneth
A carry-bag for headphones, this is not a joke right?
As the elderly experienced people says: “An apple product a year and all your money disappears” 😂
why my man switch to android mid recording   2:03
oh goodness another one?
This made me choke on my coffee wtf. Lmao
we were able to remove wireless charging altogether... GENIUS
I really can't tell if you're against them or you're supporting them

RØB: "Apple is overpriced but my merch is not" 20$ socks -_-
Watching in my AirPods Pro’s
Looks like an episode of The Office 🤣
Lol best actor 🏆
The only way how I learn about new apple products is this channel.
Nice max and ruby reference
this guy can't get sponsered by anything cause he makes fun of everything
Acutally apple company are stupid. Ngl and why they called it airpods? Dont they see its actually a headphone?
The green is good
Whenever apple releases a product I wait for your video 😂😂👍
The people that don't have Airpods, have more braincells than apple could ever have money KEKW
Lol 😂
900$ in australia are you fucking serious, i feel so sorry for anyone who wastes their money on these
"The most common question that we get is how expensive are they?"  And the answer is:  "Yes, they are."
Apple made this product just to watch this video
i hate apple and wish theyed run out of business but the only reason I want them to keep making useless products is so this guy can keep making these funny asf videos about them!!
professional sennheisers headphone cost less then this shit
"We keep raising the price im actually surprise well still have costumers"
😂😂
If they ask how much they are, they can’t afford it
Beats are for betas 😂
No way thats the actual mic...
Is it just me or he looks like Diego from The Umbrella Academy?
Maybe now I can sound like SHLATT
RØB

I’d rather have an AirPod shotty.
0:05      founder and CEO of asshole 😂🤣😂
Why did you by apple products
2:04 “That’s one small step for man”
Make a video when Razer makes a new stuff
so apple headphones?
Was that the actually microphone in them?
The poor people
My brother likes to call Apple the Over priced store
I actually thought you were joking about the price... till I checked them online
No wireless charging so everytime the battery dies you buy a new Airpod headphone which means more money to apple 🤑💰🤑
Why do these actually look good
air pods max are so over priced not even mr beast would buy them.
when your watching it with airpods max on
Doesn't look like a bra lol  WHAAAAAT??  🤣🤣
This is so true lol
This was extremely boring. Sorry, not funny at all. You need new material.
ive been waiting for this one for a while.
Me: what's the price Apple: yess
How expensive are they... awnser: Yes
*I love how the AirPods max easily puts all of your money, into my bank account.*
FOR YOUR INFORMATION!!  I did ask for the Western Extra Bacon Chesseburger.
"i love how the airpod max conveniently and automatically mutes out the poor people"
Bruhhh I lost my shit when the sound got muffled 😂😂😂 I smashed subscribe! Looking forward to your chan!
Not accurate at all the Microphone has great quality.

Hmmm... a ps5 or some headphones?
“Asshole” 😂
Bruh this is it 😂😂

First take funny Apple commercials be like:
They ain’t even pods anymore
yo mic sound got me weak😂

They made AirPods because Apple couldn’t afford to make the wire
It provides a lot of support  And makes them look better    You explained a bra

2:39 they’re dying 😃.

You remind soooooo so much of an actor who's name I cant remember
the AirPod Pro max x large gold extreme extra supreme deluxe
It says its an honest representation of the product, then lies about microphone sounds quality, and lies about various other things lol.  This person has no healthy relationships in their life, guaranteed.
I love every single apple video he has made.....every single one is sooooo accurate
someone needs energy to do videos lol
Imagine what a petty, bitter, jealous person you have to be to make these videos.

Founder and CEO of getting my ass sm- being good at smash
20 years later  “ I introduce to you.... iVaccum”
Apple is such a joke wtf are these. I have the og airpods and I actually think they're pretty good, they're small and portable but these...what are these.  Yea they're headphones and multiple other ppl have made them but these are the ugliest headphones I've ever seen.
Nobody: Literally nobody: Rob: spends $549 on the AirPods Max just to roast apple🤣🤣🤣
Apple:"next up we got space pods"
But this ist not your idea at all ! @Rudymancuso's idea
All the dislikes are Apple employees
Apple..Orange...Banana
Hi, founder and CEO off A____le
Me: I’m not poor, I’m just saving money.   ANYWAYS...  I got Airpods 2nd gen
This is the best one yet
“Who the hell chose green” TRUE the color is disgusting
"over the ear bed loans?" xD
q
I'll just go buy 1k Apple's and trade that in for a iPhone 15 Ultra Hd Max
not to mention that condensation collects inside of the headphones because they have aluminum in them
Everyone : why airpods max not pro. Apple : because of their price💸.
As an employee of Apple i approve this message
Still survive with apple joke $&@$
Apple are doing great and I love apple
I love this I also love the AirPod max
Crazy overpriced
That's a deal if you ask me😂
i love it
This is sickk
and im calling my ps5 expensive
What I don’t understand is why they went from small ear things to headphones 🤷‍♂️
Apple is typing...
I would rate this video 200000000/10 this video was great lol
The AirPods max and Ruby I’m dying 😂😂😂😂
Bruh you back, so happy to see you😭😛
By disfaming Apple he could buy any product
The fake audio is kind of deceiving though
“who the hell chose green” LMAOOOO
I legit panicked for a moment at, 2:04 I thought my phone broke
if the macs were imac pro for apple bussness is boomin
Is that a clothing hanger?
Those aren’t even AirPods anymore they are just headphones now
wait who actually bought these
Its the Airpods Max and Ruby for me  edit: who would buy it i would XD
Lmao u bought it
Apple should hire this guy and let him make their commercials really like these and people would still buy them but also they'd be happy because it's totally appropriate and true, yet they still buying these even tho they probably won't have enough money for the next 2 months to eat some proper food. :D
Idk why people dont go the chinese, they can sell you basically the exact same thing for like $30-$50
I guess I'm in the minority but I just don't find this video funny at all!  I think this guy thinks he's a lot more funny and witty than he actually is.
They are just hiring Samsung users to roast apple 😂
Who is watching in apple product!!!
🤣🤣🤣
Ok, who all thinks this guy in my doppelgänger LMAO 😂
bro this is genius loll!! first time seeing your channel
He didn’t say he latest model with the extremely long name
I knew this was coming
Why did you buy them ?
Very bad video
Rob: *makes a video roasting the airpods max*   Also Rob: *buys airpods max*
Wait... they actually exist...?
We can sell anything the best part of video.
We really can't afford this bro🤣👌😆.
Long time good to see you bro again.
More like airpads max
Me: wow apple sucks Also me: is watching on iPhone 11

The quixotic creek locally desert because lake externally guess lest a harmonious bulldozer. stale,  flippant alligator

Can't beat beats
Idk what to say words can't describe the fuckin emotions I have in heart rn but Most epic amazing awesome legendry video I've ever seen on YouTube keep it up dude ❤️🙏🏻👍🏻 You da best
An apple a day ceeps the doctors away, because we will not have money for that.
These aren't even funny anymore because you did the exact same thing like 15 times edit: nvm 8 of these
When he said how it mutes out poor people my Bluetooth headphone turned off lmao
The headphones are pretty good only thing that they are expensive  And a dipper
Basically it
Yes this is iPhone what is your current location?
Ohhh... the sound of privilege... 🤣🤣🤣
Yeah sure, because I'd rather buy a whatever that piece of **** is instead of a PS5.
Next: If EA was honest with games!
Hi, I Rob Jobs, that's why you have no  job.     Sorry.
Yo no cap tho your vids get more views and likes then LLS dis crazy

People who say they sound bad have never listened to them... but I like not being able to hear the poor people
it’s  regular wireless headphones basically
buy ROB socks, cause ROB sucks
the mic
Can get a job in Apple..
Is that really how the mic sounds😂
RØB: the bully kid in YouTube
Ear cups 🥴
that is hilarious but I'm still a blind apple follower!
Who else is in the comments to check if apple will respond?
Is that the actual mic 🤣 LMAO
"Who the hell choose green?"  *DankPods crying in the corner*
Apple's whole marketing strategy is to tack on one or two extra zeros onto what the product is actually worth
My recommend page or whatever it's called seems to be infected, hmmm...
Waste money make money
Who’s you pussies downvoting? Apple fanboys.
I bought a locked iPhone. Went through a couple of Videos with no results. Read Through some comments and saw a bunch Of recommendation about *scozhacker--* on Instagram. I just paid him too unlock my device A Good job deserves a Good recommendation ...

Me watching this with airpods max: 😐
It doesn’t make any “cents” , it makes dollar ,millions 😂! What an epic words !
"the only thing max about these headphones are the price" no, not really. I usually shit on apple but these have amazing sound and build quality and a good DAC inside. Did I mention they're wireless?
was this real airpod max mic? dayum
0:04 i think he got it right the first time
The headphones look so bad tbh.
WAITED FOR SO LONG😭❤️
“I love how the airpods max conveniently and automatically mute out the poor people” 😂😂😂😂😂😂bruhhhh
I thought my AirPods went into noise canceling lol
"the beautiful sound of privilege"
The case could never
i like this
Lmao
Apple has left the chat
speaking of airpod pros i cant find mine
The case looks like bra lmao
The irony is , he has bought all the things he’s roasting
Lmao I use iphone 5 and it works just fine like an iphone 12 pro max
Who the hell thinks it looks like a bra.? It is one😂😂😂
Dudeeeeeee
In india, they are priced 60,000 RUPEES. That is nearly 900 USD
.
the Airpod max was not harmed during the video
is it me or does he look like the bad guy from James Bond skyfall
His voice get me to relax
That's True
This guy became famous because of apple
550? Canadian would be 1000 with tax
Ashole lol!
3:26  Unexpected
The funny thing is, is that he bought them lol
mute out the poor ppl lmao
I too Love to mute out myself.
Not to be confused with his brother who makes people get fired, Job Robs.
PLEASE I CAN GET 5$ HEAD PHONES FROM 5 BELLOW THAT WORK THE SAME💀🤚
2:02
This gay so sweet 🥰
You’re pathetic
You are so good, how come I am just finding you.,...lol

It doesn't make any sense because it makes dollars, millions of it...   now this completely makes sense
Me listening on beats: 🤣🤣🤣
Bro these are literally the best headphones for their price. The mic’s are actually better than the Sony. The only bad part is the case and that’s it. Good video but these are actually good headphones. Just go look at a proper review on this
iPhone se from 2020!!
Tbh your good at milking this series
I’m not going to lie AirPod pros are sooooo much better.

This is actually funny😂😂😂
HEADPOD LMAO
I don’t know, I feel such a sexual tension between me and rob jobs
"The people who don't have airpods max are the same people who can't afford them" Well you're not wrong...
Can someone buy me them🥺👉🏾👈🏾
he said don't buy them bc they're overpriced, but he bought them
It doesn’t make any cents
The beautiful sound of privilege xD
The accuracy
If everything is honest! 😑😑😑
lmaooooo “who the hell chose green”
2:14 be sounding like those commentators from the 40's
OMG this video is at like 2M viewers in just 4 days!! That means that in 4 months it will exceed the population that can afford AirPods Max (AirMax Pods)
I thought he made up the product because the name was so stupid. I searched it up and its real. Wow.
Who else is THIS funny out there? No one literally ✅
😂😂😂

The intro "founder of as"!'hole" good one.
2:03 ah yes crystal clear sound
2 Pairs of socks for 20$, chat you tell me if is not over price

I imagine people at Apple that make fun of every person that order a pair of AirPods Pro Mini Auto MadMax, for buying an item which value is at least 1.5/5 of its actual cost
Bruh I swear rob reminds me of ted mosby from how i met your mother
"ROb Jobs"

What’s the point of AirPod max if they r just wireless headphones that u can get of amazon 4 $15

Damn that microphone sounding like a call from 2003 had me rolling 😂

IPhone commercials were honest part 3

iPhone 13 : "Last time, we got rid of the chargers and the earpods, this year, we decided to get rid of the entire phone so good luck paying 1299$ for a carboard box"

“How expensive are they?” “Yes, yes they are expensive.” This got me dead 💀
Big macsss ayyyyy
Rob has every apple product tho👉🏼😂👈🏼

Its not Rob Jobs, Its Steve Robs
I literally have fake air pods that costed 20 dollars
This guy is Eddie vr’s slightly less successful twin
"The beautiful sound of privilege"  should just be the tagline for Apple as a company it's just perfect like APPLE
I’m listening to this on my air pods pro and it felt so real when he activated the noise cancellation
“The most common question we get is, ‘how expensive are they?’  and the answer to that is always, yes.”                            -Rob Jobs, CEO  of assho-Apple
Plot twist : this guy is actually paid by Android
His name should be Rob You not Rob Jobs
This guy is cracking me up!
2:10 I cried from laughing 😂😂😂😂😂
Let's be honest they don't even look good
That top design looks like sanitary pad 😂
My teacher said that it wqs affordable at 500 bucks and our whole class was saying tjat wasnt affordable. It was funny
I love this videos
If Im being honest the AirPods I tried out sound identical to the earpods that came with my iPhone 6 years ago
It's free publicity for Apple
Why does he look like eddie vr 👁️👄👁️
Wow almost 2k dislikes, the video was good..
Apple take notes bro
lmao BRUH!!!!! this video is great!
its just funny cuz these new generation thinks having apple products makes them so rich but instead makes them look dumb af lol..
Lol wut?😂😂this got recommended randomly and this is so funny 🤣🤣
Wait... but didn’t he purchase it?!!! 🤨
Rob only bought those for the video lol
Oml ur killing me 🔫
I am a real Apple junkie, however this is awesome funny view perspective!!!, I should see this before committed to buy the irresistible “one more thing”   Good job to all team!
"How expensive are they? Yes they are"  *Makes sense to me*
Those AirPods Max look like *rip off wireless Beats..*
This man is so Good at these videos his voice even matches the tone of the ad
“Yes they are” lmaoooooooo
Hxhxh
Bxhxhd
Might as well buy beats
I got an AirPod ad for this 😭
Here come the wannabe beats
Laughed way too hard at this🤣🤣🤣
Wait till Apple Officials comment on this video 😂
😂😂😂😂
2:39 are you telling me that joint is the only thing keeping these things together.
You nailed it❤️😂😂😂
There just beats
0:36 That's a fact right there!
“Don’t buy from beats because we already did.. for 2.3 billion” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
3:05 did you record that with its microphone or something
Lmfao I died when he said  “So even when your not using them... They’re Dying..”
An iphone a year makes your money disappear Am I right or no
I think he can make the headphones a tax right off now.
When he did the mic part i died
Imma choose a ps5 instead
Ngl these headphones ugly af.
This guy is so hon LOL😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
In our country it is like 81,600 to expensive
“Crystal clear sound” *continues to speak mcdonalds drive thru*
Is CrApple trying to put themselves outta business?
“Crystal Clear Quality”  “did you just mistake charcoal for a crystal?!”
2:03 is this the real microfone quality?
this one of the best ones yet
If Gold diggers were honest???
Buy beats just to stiffly the competition
Top 10 reasons why I don’t like apple products
Another youtuber running out of ideas make other videos besides these.
I bet he recorded the built-in-mic using an android
-The only thing max is the price XD
Half the people watching this video probably bought these stupid things....
😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
Laughs in samsung until they do the same shit
Jesus is coming soon
Is there a giveaway??🧐🧐
People: “How expensive are they?”  Apple: *yes. they are.*
That last punchline was gold👌
they look like macaroons
Holy shit these things actually exist?! They legitimately flew under the radar
Homie started making fun of things he couldn’t afford to being able to buy 100 of each 😂😂
Finally Ray Mak is not in the comments section!!!  He's here nevermind 🤣😂
What about samsung
“Who the hell chose green” LOL
Apples Price *Max*
Who the hell close green 💀💀😂
Can’t wait for him to do the Apple glasses 🤤🤤🤤
4:39 "I said it once and ill say it again we can sell you anything and we keep raising the price I'm honestly shocked that we still have customers to be honest I mean it doesn't make sense thats because it makes dollars, millions and millions of dollars"  😂😂😂
Why is it more expensive than my phone 🧍
Even though my s9+ battery drains quick I use my Samsung curved tv for my music I screen mirror And I sometimes use my 1975 stereo system it has way better sound then anything apple  Also I don't like headsets I prefer wired headphones with the you know headphone jack
Imagine they made an AirPods Pro pod max. : see ya in 2073.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE KIDDING THESE ACTUALLY EXIST- APPLE PLZ NO
Apple Watch this like 👁👄👁👍
Lmao this is SPOT ON HAHAHAHAHAHA 😆!!! Also WHO THE HELL CHOOSE GREEN?!?
you got me with the noise cancelation 🤣
lmao
Makes a video about why he hates them:     Continues to buy them
I like how he’s roasting them but yet still buy them
💀💀💀
The best
DANK PODS
The part where he said “these could never” in the bra bit was what got me to like
Dont the mfs cost like 350?
"im ceo of asshole" lmaoo this is gonna be great i can tell
Your a professional at this lmao
So free
Well guess what, here in the UK they're 550£, that's right, that is a GBP sign. Therefore, in US dollar terms, it is roughly 750$. A whopping 200$ more expensive, than the already very expensive 550$ us version :/
DO APPLE CAR!!! 🚗🚘🚔🏎🚓🚕
AIRPODS MAX AND RUBY LMAOOO IM DEAD☠
finally someone saying the truth
Okay but legit $549 for why😭😭😭😭😭😭
RØB
So this is basically a continuation of the old college humor skits lol
Anyone think he kinda look like EddyVR?
AirPod max or ps5?? I would choose the ps5
This man really said “who the hell chose green”
Im just waiting for apple to comment on one of these videos
I feel like beats are still gonna be better
The top of the head phone 1 was it.
Waiting for ashish chanchlani to copy this
The headphones are literally $550
“Who the hell chose green?”
At this point I would be embarrassed to use it in public if I had one
THE VID BARELYY STARTED AND I BEAMED MY OWN ASS WITH HOW MUCH I LAUGHED
Yee yee ass haircut check  Edit: oMg thaNks foR 1 liKe!
Ah, finally. A video where Rob doesnt curse or swear, now i can press like and actually enjoy watching the full thing.

Bro I can’t 😭✨👌🏻
dude you look like eddieVR
“It provides a lot of support, and makes them look WAY better in my opinion   - the case could never”
The low price of $550 had me dead 😂
Those are literally a pair of regular headphones just even worse
I'm looking for Fanboys hate comments
a ma zing
White ppl = buy apple and wait 3 months to get the item repaired  Everyone else = buys logical items that can be repaired or replaced the same day it broke
not “who the hell chose green” 😭
I love your reviews . Lol
*"The beautiful sound of privilege"*
Omg... I’m eating and I started choking EVEN more when he was like it looks like a bra... I CANT UNSEE IT
Make more vids of this I love them
I swear he gives me such Ryan from the Office  vibes
I understand that these actually are really good...but you're probably paying about 50-60 dollars in sound quality, an additional 10-20 dollars in bluetooth tech, another 10-20 on some other shit, and then the rest is the brand name
Yoooo bro thanks my mom was look at me watching what am i doing she thought i was watching a real apple product😭
I like comedians!
This video made me buy the AirPods Mx .
Lol I can’t! 😂 “how expensive are they you ask? Yes they are expensive.” Like wth oml 😂
😭😭🤣😂
Did he actually buy them to make the video?
LOL he needs to work for Samsung they will sell more with him against apple products it’s like the president el last year 😂
I love this guy 😂
*i can tell you that at this point, Apple products are just things people buy because they want to fit in or maybe they got one and didn't know they got into a lifetime of unnecessarily expensive commitment*   Like the CEO Rob JObs said: "it doesn't make any sense but it makes dollars. . .millions and millions of dolaars"
@marcianotech
Apple has been saying this has been our best product years for more than 7 years now.....  And everytime single time, the price is the one thing increasing
I’ll just keep rocking my WH 1000X M3’s for a few more years....
Tbh I would hire him just to roast my products
This man’s such a critic tbh...
I might just buy beats
lol i legit thought this was a joke I had to google airpods max lol I cannottttt
Damn bro. You do these better than apple 🍎
Next year they will name them "Airpods Max Pro Plus Ultra"
Weren’t you the guy who was addicted to simping
THE MICROPHONE KILLED ME  😭🤚
The sad is that Apple is making fun and money for a long time.

When you like the video before watching it cuz you know it's gonna be fire
the mic sounds so bad
bruh these headphones are whack. so much more quality for beats studio 3 or bose
How expensive they are? Yes
“It provides a lot of support...and it makes them look way better in my opinion.....the case could never...”    Did not expect that. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"The most common question we get Is, 'how expensive are they' and the answer to that is always  Yes 😂😂😂
Lol
Wait how do they even charge
How does this not get taken down by apple?
Let’s be honest everyone still buying it
Omg Was that the audio for real??
Lmao im dying bro
I like apple but honestly this is accurate. Apple is dumb
Someone give him an Oscar please
Lmao 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
How expensive are they?  Yes, they are.
The fact that he always buys all these products to do these videos😅,
The video iJustine doesn’t want you to see
Why would I buy these for 550 dollars while I can get some new wireless beats headphones for 350 dollars instead? 🤔
So those are the old head  sets I used in 4th grade while typing on mavis beacon
Really, $550 for a piece of crap that like you could go get a better pair of headphones for like $50 at like target and it would have better quality like apple I swear makes too much money because if they sell "1000" iphone 12s they would make 1M like it's stupid how over piece their crap is!!!🤡
Who the hell chose green😭
I bought the empty shell and stuck some sanhaizer guts in them saved me  tons of money and I can FLEX

The guarded news revealingly arrest because harp possibly mark under a long play. ossified, faded stamp
i'll take a max and ruby lool

No one can say with facts, that he does this because he can’t afford them, because he buys every product he talks about.
This time there is no give away because, buying only one pair of these will make you poor af😂😂
Wait, what? So they only charge with a cable? I didn't know that 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They look like headphones you find at 5-below

“It doesn’t make sense.... because it makes dollars”
10x more dislikes than likes. Maybe you should change the your contents. Just saying.
Ø
Earlyyyy
is that the real mic lol
“Founder and CEO of asshole” my favorite part

I can imagine apple hiring him and then RøB being like “what, so I have to lie now? Bitch bye”
if this dude disappeared out of nowhere , i think we all know why and who
I thought the thumbnail was Andrew Schulz
This is so good. "Mutes out the poor people."  Omg I'm laughing so hard
Head pods lmao 🤣
Well.... The case. Looks like an underwear to me!
Mm
Reminds me of ooojleooo
Hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love how he’s roasting the air pod max because they are way overpriced and stupid, but then he puts them on and goes I actually can’t hear anything.
Person: How expensive is it?  Apple: *Yes*
Apple: with brands such as sennheiser, Bose and much more making sound crystal clear for musicians and basic consumers we decided to say F*** that!
all the dislikes are the rich people
AirPods Max : where Stimulus meets Consumerism
It honestly dosnt make any sense
hahahaha god mode
It makes dollars not sense
I Could buy a ps5 with the $500 needed to buy the AirPods and They wouldn’t even have a week to live before I got the steam roasted outta me
“Hi I’m rob jobs founder and ceo of asshole” *Speech 100*
lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Literally waiting for apple to make a new products to watch this vids of yours lol
Bruh I got an apple ad right after this video with the gentle piano touch background music
It would have been better if u put ur positivity somewhere else
0:17 I thought I was here for burgers, apshole
The crazy thing is that in Indonesia the Airpods Max costs half of the iPhone 12 Pro Max 512GB...
The air pods max and ruby
The microphone part got me dead ☠️ 😂
Apple please keep going with these videos I need robs videos
“These are the best over the ear headphones apple has ever made” And the only ones 😂
😂😂😂😂😂
"It doesn't  make any sense, that's coz it makes dollars millions of dollars"

"The case gives them support and makes them look better"😂 Bruh that's literraly what bra does
HairPods Max lmao 😂
Idiot
Apple could nevea.
Ea and apple are are similar
How expensive: yes
Apple really hates ROB by now
No way that's the mic audio 😳😳
Imagine if apple watched his videos....
Founder and CEO of a** hole ..aa.. Apple
Bro duuuuuude their just beats my GUY
Someone:"How expensive are the-"  Apple: *yes*
Yo this is the wrong teleprompter!🤣🤣
7100th comment epic
It's dime to change..
Like NASA headphone
Everybody gangsta until Disney buys apple and copyright claims Rob into oblivion.
I like how you shove off how expensive these are

Top teir norminess.
I love apple but this is funny
Fucking great!💯
Rob jobs returned, it’s scary how accurate these Apple videos are.
I’m so glad I seen this review, I mean product reveal.
Apple shit
THE MIC QUALITY SKSKSJSKSKKS
Does that is the real sound from it mic ??
Why the fu*k  did u even buy it ? And in India it’s around $850
This is true that apple is very overpriced these days they are selling their products on 300% profit...this is not good... but well we still buy those products just to show people around us that i am rich..
OMGGGGGG. MAX AND RUBY MY FRICKING CHILDHOOD. THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME REMEMBER!!
Who approved these? Lol
He got more real every passing videos he made 🤣🤣
2:04 you sound like Donald Trump
I have one and I used it for about a month this is what I think about it: the sound quality is great, the noise canceling is alright, a little expensive, not too comfortable, way too heavy.
All the dislikes are apple employees.
Ok who the actual hell is gonna buy $500 headphones that do the same shit as $100 headphones?
Man you got me at max and ruby 🤣 subscribed!
“The only thing max about these airpods is the price” damn I’ve watched this too many times and it’s still funny af
"It looks like im at the shooting range" You wish those look as good as my walkers
..So now when you’re not using the headphones, *they’re dying.*
Apple is the biggest scam in history
20 $ for 2 pairs of shocks kinda expensive too
Who the hell chose green 😂😂😂
I’m laughing so hard LOL
These look like peltor working headphones
Ok let’s be honest who here actually only buys them to flex on there school friends 😂
I know this is designed to trigger Apple Users and entertain androidians, but this is just dumb.
While we shut out the sounds of poor people😂😂😂
This is very satisfying, I don't know why 😂
u stopped being funny
Obviously who ever dislike this vdeo are from apple🤣
I still can’t believe that the power cable doesn’t even come with a block, so if this is your first apple product you still have to spend more moneu
"so whenever you're not using your airpods, they're dying" :'DDD
*who the hell chose green ?*
“CEO of Asshol- Apple.”  “How expensive are they?.”  “Yes, They are.”  *Huh*
Petition for rob jobs to replace tim cook please!
Should’ve been called Apple headphones Max
3:45 I'm dead lol
You can buy really good mid-range phone for 550$-650$. You can buy hi-fi headphones like audeze on NASA technologies. Or you can buy this shit. Apple, you're ridiculous
Trolling
Who cares how expensive they are lol. They have the best sound quality in the business, but they are not made for everyone. They are an ultra premium product at the end of the day
I died at the microphone part!!!!!
we can even buy a pc of that money or we can buy a phone which also have speakers and microphone and so much more features  but apple and his users never thinks about that
SONY XM4 is the best
3:40🤣🤣
Imagine dropping these when you already own Beats🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
CEO of *** hole 😂
I can't stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣
1:55 I'm dead bruh 🤣😭
😂😂
Please tell me that that mic part was fake, no way they charge so much for a headset with such a shitty mic. Oh wait, it's Apple, ofcourse they would do that.
Whatever he says, he bought the fucking thing🙄!!
Founder and CEO of as*hole😂😂😂😂
Damn i want that microphone to deliver a speech so amazing that makes Hitler shave his moustache.
Ok he bought them... also that’s an awfully simple understanding of privilege.
Damn didn't expect the microwave sound quality to be that bad or maybe he did a edit
"great sound of......previlege"😂😂😂
Lol the mic
Yeah....imma get one       💀
The fact that he buys everything 😂😂😂
I'll be coming here to find real information about Apple products
You really are the CEO of all as*holes! And I freakin like it! 😍😍😍
Your sarcasm is top notch😂😂
The fact he buys these just to make these parodies😅 These could cost 800$ n ppl would still buy
The intro 😂
“Who the hell chose green!” 😂
I have found a number larger than infinity... apple’s prices after a few more years with rob jobs
2:04 sounds like Armstrong talking from the moon.
Did I just hear man say only 550 dollars 😂😂 this guy is crazy funny
apple: “Best built-in microphone in headphones😌” headphones: *microwave sounds*
I low key want them now...
Him: its does not look like a bra   Also him: it supports and makes it look much better.
He likes them.😂
Sum about his voice while he does these apple vids is just amazing🔥
"And most importantly, expensive"   Yep, there isn't an Apple product that isn't expensive.
It looks like I'm at the shooting range. Indeed.
"Who the hell chose green"
So we’re not gonna talk about how he needs to buy the products for him to roast apple? Lol idk its a little ironic. I love these videos
They are 900 dollars here in AUS-
😂
Beats : let's sell headphones  Apple : we heard you're selling yourself  Beats : huh that's a nice idea  Apple : (inner voice) money money and money $0$
Am not throwing more money at fucking apple. So shit. I’m dying to switch so Samsung.
doesn't make any sense because it make dollars  hahahhahaha
Bra more like balls
"the only thing max is their price"  i choked on my food right there.
He had to buy all this products to make these videos
The mic quality bussin doe🥶
The dislikes are from Apple Headquarters🤣🤣
pathetic video...
If you already know these things, then why the hell you bought one of those?😂
Are you Rob Kardashian?

Imagine apple react to his videos
"it doesn't make any sense"   ThAts BeCaUsE iT mAkES dOlLaRs" "MILLIONS OF THEM"  JOKE OF THE YEAR  Its at 4:51 btw
Honest Question - Are the mics in the max really that bad or was that another joke?
Most importantly expensive hahaha that's the good one🤣
More give me more 👀😂 Or do another TLC video
well they could have called it the 'AirHeads'
Sir plz can u give me a iPhone I need it plz help😢

I see Apple becoming a brand like Gucci

God you’re repetitive. Just a channel for Apple haters. Why don’t you do one on the new $750 S21 that’s made from plastic?
That offer up hint is true af, same goes with the ps5 and any other popular items
01:21 who the hell chose green😂😂😂😂
The mic is #1
I thought it was fake 🤣
Bruh

Bruh I’m dead hahahha
RØB the *MOST WANTED* For Apple Inc.
I like how this whole video could be summed up by: “capitalism”
When no one watches from your channel anymore so you start milking the video that once made you famous:
The beautiful sound of privilege🤣🤣🤣
You can't turn them off. So they will keep dying.  Apple's slogan. Fun fact: i acquired the Iphone 4S from a dead relative (I know. classy) and I really enjoy that I can't download apps because it doesn't support IoS 10.0  I'm living life without apps on my phone. But I'm also still watching a lot of YouTube.
Air pods Big Macs 😂 😂😂😂😂😂🤣
Actually who the hell chose green
We are at the peak of technology
Dude, that’s funny and totally true. 🤣
« So whatever you do, do not buy beats by Dr. DRE... because we already did... for 2.3 Billion Dollars »
The intro is the best thing
AIRPODS BIG MACS HAD ME LAUGHING FOR 1 MINUTE STRAIGHT LMAOOOOOOO
I’m sold! I’m buying a new sig 551 a1 now!   Wait... you’re telling me this wasn’t an advertisement for a beautiful Swedish weapon?
"Founder and CEO of A$$hole" Im dead😂

Another quality tech review
I think In future rob will be CEO of apple Rob jobs
And next, the airpods pro max, the airpods max, with regular airpods taped to the outside, your welcome...that will be 2000$
*Imagine people flexing with these disasters*  I mean  I could get identical 10$ ones from Kmart 😂
More
He robs jobs 😂😂 I know it has been used before
the mic made me cry laughing
"If you can't get the headphones then you can't afford them" Hmm yes the floor seems to be made out of floor
Next commercial is the apple car starting at 2.9 million dolalrs
9 seconds in and I’m already dead 💀
The max and ruby part had me dead 😩
On the breakdown of the parts, it was pretty high quality and would last a long time, but for that price to can buy TWO Sony WXM headphones which would last longer. Smh my head
Why dont you mock samsung for their $1000 phone?
or i could get beats for 1/4 the price. uhh yeah, i’ll do that
These videos are just an excuse for him to buy the newest Apple products
Apple: launched a new product.  Rob: here we go.
CEO of assh@le sorry apple🤣🤣
For some reason, I was waiting for this video.
1.4K Dislikes who bought this xD
Its astonishing how good he is at this
Was that the actual mic on the headphones
😂🤣 omg I love you
U revealed everything of my thoughts
Headphones for 89,000 pkr i can get a whole new phone with that
He got me WHEEZING THROUGH THE WHOLE VIDEOOO
Wow.. you’re a natural
These are actually beats max by Dr DRE
The Zikini wini’s
He was a bit too honest
It doesn't make any sense, that's because it makes dollars! Millions of dollars! Bar right there.
I know who u are, but I still thought it was  Eddie(VR)
2:02 Wow they even used in moon landing in 1960s love it

😂😂😂😂
I only got 7 dollar’s take it or leave it
Did I just watch a 5 minute merch ad
So honest
I was keeping my cool until 1:11 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“Who the hell chose green” I’m sent 😂😂😂
The microphone joke isn't honest, they sound way better than that.
You should make one on Something about 𝗜𝗽𝗼𝗱𝘀
The only people who disliked this video owns an Airpods Max
Wait this is not apple's  official channel
My question is do you use apple products? 😂
Samsung makes parts for iPhone and Samsung is cheaper than Iphone

Air pods max & ruby 💀
ramsey bolton

*Who the hell choose green*
WAIT A DAMN MINUTE THAT SHIT  IS REAL THEY CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
Rob jobs love robbing jobs
Rob is literally killing himself in this vid
Excellent 🤣🤣
Apple is saving his channel every year
$550????😂😂😭😭 they are so damn ugly, nah man I’ll stick with my beats.
Considering the fact they actually bought these
these headphones are really fucking expensive but they genuinely sound amazing
He kills apples business He owns every apple product He be like”i used the stones to destroy the stones”
You should do a macar one
Next month Rob will introduce the Airpod Pro Neo Max Mini 2.0 Blast Boom. "The people who doesn't have Airpods are poor"
The beautiful sound of privilege- RØB 2021
@apple watch this
“who the hell chose green”  me: 👋
This Reminds me of Ashish chanchalani. . .😂❤️❤️
Any. Indian here
I watch these videos just to get reasons for not buying apple products...
Wtf he buys all the products just to roast 🍎 🍏 🍎
It looks like he watched that video from mrWhosetheboss
Apple should use you for there events, this is great lmao 😂
So he bought the VERY expensive Airpods Max and made the money back by making this video... GENIUS!!!
Rob: *talks about how useless it is*  Also rob: *has the product*
2:10 is this how its actually sounds!!??
LMFAOOOOO and he does it again.
JUST A REMINDER YOU'RE SUPPORTING CHILD SLAVERY WHEN YOU USE YOUR APPLE PRODUCTS
Buy beats
Apple in a quote:            It is evolving, just backwards
apples making gas fr fr
It’s not a bra- Rob Jobs
AirPods max and ruby sent me
Sky blue , who the hell chose green 😂😂
Okay hear me out... Apple should make a new generation of AirPods but with the noise cancellation feature.   I hate looking like a bug with the pros, and now AirPods 2 are a little old.
I thought they were fakes...
Wow this was great. Apple loves money and there are better cheaper headphones. Apple are beginning to make more decisions like "take it out even if people would want it" and they need to make their own 'good' ideas.
🤣😂🤣🤣🤣
Just go get beats.
LOL
You should wear a spectacles
They should've put a light up Apple logo on the side
Yet, still people buy them
😁
Heavy duty bra
you had me in tears at "mutes out the poor people" 🤣🤣🤣 lollll omg
If this YT video told the truth
You wondering who the hell chose green: who the hell chose green
that 02:03 lmao
Please make a video titled - " If ROB videos were honest"
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LIT 🔥
Me: How much will it cost? Apple: yes
Even the starting is funny (Rob Job's)😂. Keep it up man. Make Samsung honest commercial as well.
Hi im rob jobs, CEO of assholeapple *me laughing like an idiot instantly liking the video, coz already subscribed 😂😂😂*
"Everytime you're not using the headphone..    They're dying."  Ok this seriously made me cackle
Damn 😂
“So whenever you’re not using your headphones, they’re dying..” took me out bruh💀🤣
The sad part is these are probably the best product to come out of apple for a long, long time...but they cost $550, almost the same price as the entire second U.S. stimulus check.
Please let us know if apple staff is subscribed to this channel
If you want noice canceling. Get the pros. I have then and I love them. 1. They are way cheaper then these 2. You can hide them in your hair in class 3. More portable 4. You can have 1 in at a time. Personally don’t get these new ones and get the pros if you want something new.
“Head pods”
0:04 you know this is gonna be a good one 😂
Bruhhhhhh this is funny
U nailed it
“Mute out Poor people” I died

I thought I lost my hearing at 2:04
The fact that this is the first time I’m hearing of these

“The case could never” 😆
How expensive are the AirPods?  *YES*
You all can dislike the truth but the truth is the truth.😂😂
You’re videos are awesome and funny 😂
It doesn't make any cents😂
Apple: **Releases a new product**   RØB: **it's free real estate**
You just made a free ad for apple. Congrats on fooling yourself
The inbuilt microphone part😂 was lit
He looks like eddievr
The built in mic part got me good
They look so stupid lol
''The people that don't have airpods max are the same people that cant afford them''.         CAP!!!
LOL you should've touched on the point of buying it's replaceable earmuffs. PRICEY.
Lolllllllll

Who the hell chose green
His haircut is good, does anyone know what it name?
Air(Maxi)Pad
If apple ads were honest they would be making more money than they do already
The thing is you actually buy it . This man make bank 😂
Yeah, actually, why didn't they call them HeadPods? That's a much better name.
lol love how he has basically all apple products just to roast them
And yet we buy it... all
This guys looks like EddieVR and JuicyFruitSnacks had a Child

I'll buy jbl instead which will be much better than these.

He post every 6 years but it’s always a great video
Imagine living in Canada where they cost $800.  **cries in Canadian**
Honestly I buy every stupid new product apple throws out but this one has got to be the most stupidest thing to be released by them
0:05 is why i subbed
tHe oNly tHiNG mAx abOuT tHEsE aIr pOdS aRe tHe pRicE 0:37
RØB, a guy who's having a career out of making fun of Apple.
Is it just me or does he look like EddieVR?
These headphones looks like Mickey Mouse and Dumbo crossover
Definitely funnier than the AirPods Max vid I did 😊😊
Only good thing 🍎🍎🍎 has made that was even remotely worth the money and was actually by a LOONNGG shot. The new M1 MacBook Air/Pro. They're amazing.
The 'Rob jobs' gets me every time😂
I like how he literally buys almost every product from apple just to make these
however, you did made good publicity to them. He did admitted the sound is great, and noise canceling also. So yeah...
They are around $1000 in Serbia (in Serbian currency: 98,000 rsd) 🤯
rob bought them lol
*Trashy mic* COD players: I need to buy this!!!
People who disliked are the apple workers
My grandma watching this so she can buy it for me 🤔
I fucking live these videos so much literally before I even watch em Ik they bouta be 🔥
Already dead just after 00:05 seconds of video 😂😂
Okay, you got me at the microphone part
Literally these are the most entertaining videos I can’t even
Rob: dont buy beats  Me watching this with my beats on:  🅱️👁👄👁🅱️
Headpod Max is lowkey a Fire name for them
I have beats so
If its in our country...its 20,000 pesos
Most experienced non apple staff.
😂😂
I can’t imagine Apple is going to sponsor him anytime soon
Fuck that I'm getting my ps5
Lmfaoooo
Me: who got AirPods Pro. my brother:  hey did you hear that there’s new AirPods. Me: again.
They should have named them ProPods
😂
Wait... these headphones are real? I thought this was a joke 😂😂😂 they kinda look uh silly
Couple months later they gonna release the fucking Airpods Max Pro, which is gonna be the same shit but more expensive
If it was a real commercial his name wouldve been "Rob Views"
Fun fact: Number 12 COK
Here on Brazil they cost 6 900,00 R$ (1 262.03 USD)  At least Apple makes me laugh
Apple is a greedy company that makes the same exact product every year, they say it’s a big upgrade, bullshit!!!!
This is brilliant
Headpods
Economy after this 📉📉📉📉📉📉📉
Are these really AirPods anymore?
Another apple product, another RØB video
I love how the comments are just subtitles for the video 😂❤️
The domineering onion neurally reach because cocktail finallly wobble besides a abrupt bridge. difficult, good apartment
“Its looks like am at the shooting range” 🤣🤣🤣
Busque Rob de robleis y salió este

Nobody:  My teachers in Zoom: 2:03
3:36-3:52. Golden. The case could never!
LOL
i love apple but the only reason i am watching this because he is funny

Did anyone hear abt the Apple toilet?
The bizarre magic postnatally whirl because team uniquely lie regarding a curvy water. male, quick ink
Should make some of their blind sheep that buy anything.
another awesome honest commercial video
ehh ok but acting like beats isnt the same garbagee like apple
Air pods big macs and mini max, damn I didn't see that coming XD
Plot twist: Steve Jobs hired him to do this
The watery gauge radiographically calculate because wall minimally water against a wrathful quince. vast, probable syrup
Apple really do be reinventing the wheel... Smh 🤦‍♂️
"only at carl's jr" LMAOOOOOOO IDIOCRACY
Dude, did apple fire u or something?😂😂
“Who the hell chose green” is the best color probably 😂
Imagine walking through LA with that one
This is amazing.
we all wait for this video all year lol
Literally 😂
When and RØB fan and subscriber enters Apple with merch.  Apple: Ah shit, here we go again.
What’s this background music ?
“i love how the airpods max conveniently and automatically mutes out the poor ppl” *puts airpod max on* “ah the beautiful sound of privilege” “mm gotta love it.. gotta love it” lmaoooo im deadd💀
Hey I rob jobs
Cyprien en sueur
Thank you "Youtube Recommends." Thank you.
hah i havent laughed this hard in a while
why do I have a feeling he got  it from the offer up app
-How expensive they are? -yes
Been waiting for you
That mic got me😂😂
The ipods big macs hahahahaah best part
The all new, AirHeads MAX. Only your life savings.
I though this was a joke
I think i’ll just go with a ps5
At this point he’s just giving apple free sponsorships 🙄🤚🏾
*Hey Rob Jobs you better heart this comment*
He didnt show the price😂😂😂.
ngl thoes look gay
This is what apple react to mrwhotheboss airpod max and after this there will be airpod max ultra or airpod max pro
wait lmfao is that what the mic actually sounds like???
I dont understand who these headphones are for other than people that want to flex. Professionals want want them if they don't have a 3.5mm jack, they're to expensive for the average consumer looking for headphones, they dont have a market other than dumb people
“The case could never ” 😂
I never knew apple headphones even exist 😂
I bought the green ones
Pov he got them in a McDonald's happy meal
Funny 😄  I love this “commercial campaign” 😂
“beautiful sounds of privilege” lol
BAHA
ah yes, because working hard and making money is "privilege".  Bum ass people always act like they're the last person to blame for their position in life.
Ateve jobs disliked that
Plot twist: the only reason he does this is so he can buy all the new apple products without being made fun of because he “bought them for a video.”
Are u eddievr u look like him
Rob you sound like a literal narcissist trying to manipulate people in these commercials 😂
Eh. These are very inconvenient.
So, you are still paying for the price?
I actually never heard of these until this video but why does apple keep doing this?
You forgot about the office chair head ring lol
We need more!! Haha work for apple!
How expensive are they: Y E S! now that's called marketing!!!!
BUILT IN MIC😂😂😂😂
3:08 only superior individuals will know this sound
How do you not get demonetized
airpods max are just beats but $400 more expensive
as someone who swears by apple, i swear by your channel even more
If this were a gta 5 ad
Forgot to mention about how the small amount of sweat you get from sitting on a chair can break them
He’s at it again
comedy
This guy has just grown his channel by mocking apple
Yo LOL 😂
The real funny thing is the fact that you actually bought them
"idk why we didn't do airpods pro before this..."  *AirPods Pro*: 😭
i hope this guy doesnt get sued
First
I’m surprised he didn’t go into the condensation buildup issue 😂
ME, I CHOSE GREEN
I mean, ever since Monster and Beats separated, Beats have been over priced crap. Just like Apple.
who the hell chose green that got me so hard
Me Watching AirPods Max Commercials Using AirPods
apple is like this: heres the new airpods max, BUT to have these you need the watch, but to have the watch you need the phone, but to have the phone you need the ipad.. etc
I lost it when I heard AirPods Max & Ruby 🤣🤣🤣
The mic tho🤣🤣🤣
wait i thought airpods max wasn’t a real thing-
Rob is back!!!
dumb. they didn’t do because they already sell airpods pro, inform yourself.
Even samsung got rid of the headphones jack
So true tho hahahah
i am fairly certain some of the jokes in this video are just lying to make the airpods maxes look bad
The case doesn't look like a bra.      It looks like a diaper
The microphone got me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sorry man, I'm android all the way.  Sorry not sorry
Shoulda been called AirPhones
All dislikes are rich kids that think they are cool
Leave the comment section if u haven't watched the video

"How expensive are they?, and the answer to that is yes, they are."

"CEO of assho- I mean apple"
NOT THE COMPUTER LAB HEADPHONES BAHAHA
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.

I had so many ideas on what to comment until I looked at the comments and saw that my idea is taken
These are so funny. 😂😭
500? Here in Brazil it starts at 1.262 USD
Best Line: “The Airpods Max and Ruby” 😂
in the audiophile community, $550 USD is nothing. too bad they don't sound great
Can’t believe he actually bought them
You are so good. Love 💓 from India 🇮🇳

The case could never lmfao. That shit is gold.
It DOES look like you're at the shooting range.LMAO
“Airpod Max’s are way too over priced, but my merch is not”  20 dollars for two pairs of socks😐
How are these airpods if you can't lose them every 5 seconds forcing you to buy new one this is simple stonks
Honestly though, I feel apple genuinely thinks we’re stupid
“Hi I’m rob jobs, founder and ceo of asshol- I MEAN APPLE” SHIT GOT ME LOL
"...the case could never" lmao that was good
You should’ve called your self “Steve Robs”
This is legit the truth
Ngl these are getting really repetitive
please tell me that’s not the actual mic audio from the headphones😭
Yes
Anyone knows how the song in the background is called?
People will still break Their Backs to Buy These Shits 😭😭😭😐
This is just the start to world control I've heard. Enough Bluetooth devices like this that won't turn off, combined with all these new wifi like data speeds means we will be controlled via signal in no time!
hah thanks rob. made me laugh :) keep up the content
😭😭😭
I mean if you are going to meme a studio quality headphone might as well go watch linus’s video and educate yourself 🤷‍♂️

0:03 Not even 10 seconds and I 😂
Plot twist: he actually bought every single apple product and is the biggest apple fan xd.

The mic is not that bad
rob: roasting every apple product  also rob: *owns every single one of them*
$550 for headphones... THATS MORE THAN THE PS5 AND XBOX SERIES X
2:10 Jesus my ears just died
This series is fucking gold

The best thing about this is that it is amazingly realistic

Or a snoop dogg 😂
Can you do a dr dre parody pleaseeee... that would be cool shit
Apple should really start listening to this guy
You can get Wireless Bose headphones for half of this and they’re way way better than these
Only thing max is its price😂😂😂👍
You forgot replacing the ear things on them are 60 dollars
I thought he was gonna make fun about how they get flooded for no reason and Apple doesn't even offer you refund or pay for repair
Hello
What is this music lmao
The cheapest technology at the highest price Just what idiots deserve
I still don't see why Apple made them it's like a replica of Beats
I've been waiting 😌
In this era it has never been cheaper than ever to produce any tech
“It doesn’t even make sense... it makes dollars, millions of dollars.” That had me on the floor litterally
“Who the hell choose green?”  I just lost it 😂
How expensive are they? -yes. They are.
THE MIC LOL

The 1.1k dislikes are from apple employees
Who the hell chose green😆😆😆
LOVE these vids XD
Those are so ugly omfg 😂
No one can top you at this game 😂😂
I swear some random apple sniper is gonna come for you soon
So by making yourself look stupid, you think this is going to portray Apples headphones? Sorry if you can not afford them, they are expensive , but one day if you ever get good at this you tube thing, it may happen for you.
Was that really the recorded audio?😂😂😂
After he said asshole I can't stop smiling
I like how he buys the product 😏

Yeah f that
0:38
missed the chance to call it "Airheads"
Never bought apple products
the bra joke😂😂
1:24 “and who the hell chose green” has me deadd 💀💀
Do you received any email from Apple regarding hiring you for their product promotion? Cz ngl you are very much better than those boring hosts in the launch premieres
When he mentioned Mac and ruby my head went zooom
This guy reveal the 🍎
The airpods max and ruby got me nostalgic
And most importantly expensive 😂
"It provides support and makes them look better" that's what bro do😂😂😂
No hate but do have any other  topic to do
wait a sec, are the microphones really THAT bad??? I’m very concerned;;;
Did you just call these things expensive for 5 minutes just so you could say your merch was less than $∞? Brilliant.
This doesnt hide the fact that he buys very single one of apple products
Is it the actual mic at 2:12 of the airport mini mac oh sorry airpod max        Sorry for the joke but please tell is it the actual mic
Lmao I only just got the meaning behind his name. Rob Jobs XD
2:03 i thought my phone got broken💀
Call it headphones , make it cheap ! And don’t call it earphones
Not U already having the product
It doesn't make sense, it makes dollars 😂😂👏👏
I can literally buy a new pc 😅😅
"Who the hell chose green" 😂😂😂
You suck at this
Yes Apples becomes Assholes.
They are ugly simple
they’re just headphones lmao
“The answer to that is always yes,” lol. Hilarious.
You have made a 1mln views in 2 days holy moly
It’s literally overpriced headphones
The max and rubie one killed me 😂😂😂😂😂
So sincere
I would laugh if i ever walked by someone wearing these!! hahaha they are sooooo ugly!
Hello I'm founder and ceo of assh.. iphone
“AirPods maxes are way too overpriced but my merch is not” - Rob

“Yes they are”
Truly incredible
"Founder and CEO of a**hole"😂😂
This feels like The Off-ish
Samsung should obviously hire this guy😎😎
I didn’t even know these existed until now
Those look like headphones from the 99c store and the case looks like it's a case for my nut sack
Keep doing that amigo
theyre dying
Snik εσύ;;;

Max and Ruby damnnn
Ps5 or headpods  Me: Yes
Just the intro got me dead bruh 😂! C'mon let's finish the video 🤣
Apple in general is a waste of money including the phones
"It doesn't make any sense that's because it makes dollars millions and millions of dollars" lmfao😭💀
Nobody:   That one guy on the mic: 2:07
Mr. Steve jobs from heaven be like:   😒 <) )>  |_ |_
Steve jobs was half serien not mexican
I just can not believe that apple as a company didnt sue you for this like they are raising the standards i guess
Finally. An Honest review.
OMG YASSS!
😂😂😂😂😂
It does not make any sense  Because it makes dollars.,.
The thing is, the only things that you can actually complain about with these is the case and the price. But even for the price, you’re still getting a lot. In my opinion, they’re worth it, it’s just that not many people will go out of their way to pay that much
the airpods max cost as much as a ps5
EddieVr ?
I love to hear  that background music rather than apple launch event 🤣🤣🤣
Who the hell choose green
"The shooting range"😂🤣🤣
Am I the only one who used to watch Max & Ruby?
1:23 "Who the hell chose green" I'm sleep 😂😂
Not joking if u were the founder of apple and u post these types of commercials I would buy ur products ngl
How expensive are they? "Yes"

Is there any way to find out what music is playing in the background...?  Where it's from or who it is by...?  I'd *really* appreciate it.

The beautiful sound of privilege mmm so good  Lol!
I didn’t even know it existed till now☠️
"These are the best headphones apple had ever made" true lol
Flash back to niga higa
Jesus is the only way to heaven. Not by works or by going to Church every Sunday (not saying stop attending) John 14:6 “Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” Romans 10:9-10 “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.” Spread the word God bless :)
"I love how the airpods max conveniently and automatically mutes out the poor people....  Aahhh, the beautiful sound of privilege."  This cracked me so hard. 🤣
Apple should be paying you for this.
Yes apple bought beats by dr dre. But why not utilize it???!
"Doesn't make any cents, that because it makes dollars" u killed me there 😂
Honestly who thinks the colors are ugly and the design also? I would prefer the pros more

"They look like a bra" damn i didn't notice that 😂😂
Even he buys He criticise
The fact that he had to buy the airpods...
Some god damn computer lab ear muffs
Guys can we have a f in the comments for rob who had to buy this headphone
I... didn't know Apple had a new product until this video showed up in my recommended section.  The AirPods Big Macs LOL To be honest I never got any sort of airpods before. And I have sony headphones which uhhh well i had to buy a few new wires but it's all cool. Right? Right... I mean sure I can't just plug it into my computer to charge anymore because someone got rid of the usb ports on these laptops, but hey that's what usb-thunderbolt converters are for! Ha. Ha. Yeah nah I don't need these headphones so I won't get them. And anyway my current headphones cancel enough noise. I can hear people talking and can choose to listen in on them, but otherwise I can listen to music and I won't hear as well. Which is all cool.
Rob is Robert Downey Jr's long lost brother.
About time.
Founder & ceo of what ?
If youtube channels were Honest.     "My channel runs on this apple rip off commercial"  *laughs with small humh*
Imagine getting like from your celebrity crush..... Ig I shoul riencrnate for that... 😭

Affordable airpods: Airpods Macs Hairpods max Airpods max & ruby Airpods mask And the Airpods big macs
I have the AirPods Pro’s and don’t understand the appeal of these. They aren’t even AirPods. $550 could be added to an investment portfolio.
next Brapod max pro 2
Epic dudes.
При чем здесь 6?
People with AirPods Pro: I literally can’t Fucking hear you  People with Airpods Max: I’m fucking deaf damn it so of course I can’t hear you 🥳😂
U have got to do a collab with Trevor Wallace
I can’t wait for the Apple Apple that comes in Red, Green (who the hell chose green?”) puke and poor yellow, depressing Blue, and attention seeking pink
Beats is somehow worse than apple
I’d rather use my walkman’s headset.
After all this time i just realized the name "Rob Jobs" is literal af
I'm watching this video on my laptop with airpods max connected lol.
Smooth transition to the merch😂
Next vid in my prediction: if apple TV commercials were honest
When they start making water, it’s gonna be hella good. And also $10,000, So nobody poor can drink.
AirPod Max is basically a pair of cheap headphones with the specs of AirPods. 😂😂😂😂😂
Your not the ceo of apple 🍎
On point LMAO
The built in microphone 😭😭😭😭😭
AirPods max and ruby 😆
Hello there, I hope you are having a wonderful day.
Founder of ass****😂😂😂
apple thinking i want to fit in
we made it on trending
I like that rob buys the product to slander it Lmao
Waiting for your trailer 😂🤣
An apple a year makes your money disappear                                                   -Rob Jobs
3:09 I literally thought he turned on noise cancellation on my AirPods Pro 😂  I know, I’m an idiot
You forgot to list the airpods mac and cheese! 😡😡🤬
OMG Is it just me or I watched very one of this!
I am crying due to laughing so much lol
Wait, are these actually going to be or presently a real thing?
yes!
Lol that was pretty good, gotta show my wife and kids
Why y’all quoting what he says guys? Lmaoooo it’s kinda getting annoying now... we get it these are just an expensive bra ...
I can't believe I'm watching an ad and no one is forcing me to...
my cousin thought she was gonna get a series x for christmas and got these instead when she alr has airpod gen 2s lmfao
Mutes out the poor people
this shows that apple is really running out of ideas 😑
0:02
A**hole? 😆😆😆
"It looks like I'm at the shooting range or something- it looks like I'm in.. computer lab, or something" killed me 😂😂
Air pods maxes are way too expensive but my mercy is not  5:07
Best vids ever 😂
Rob needs a medal
YEESSSSSSSSSSS
I love you
They called it AirPods max because in a year they will come out with AirPods max pro which will be double the price
Apparently he buys every apple product 🍎
Been waiting on this, since they released the AirPod Max
I can literally shit in a waffle maker and it would look better than an Airpod Max
Next up: If Nokia commercials were honest.
2021 where tech gear makes everyone poor
That is sooo big, i still prefer airpods 2, that’s handy
This was the best thing I’ve seen all day lol
apple CEO: theres nothing wrong with this video its perfect
ROB IS TRENDING!!???
This is all so sadly true. I have them and I love the sound, but I hate them with every fiber of my being. You have to wear them on your forehead if you want to wear them in bed. They seem to have fixed the battery drain at least. Also that said, they are so much better than the Beats Studio3 - Beats are fine, but these things just sound so crystal clear. The fit sucks and I hate not being able to turn them off. Otherwise...
wow, you actually went and bought this
2:03 since when did phone guy work with apple?
It’s so funny how everyone is pressed about the price like bro if u can’t afford it then don’t buy it like stfu don’t hate in apple at the end of the day it’s a businesses dumb fucks
*"How expensive is this?"* *"Yes, it is very expensive."*
Nothing beats razer
“Airpods Max&Ruby” omg I remember that show
Funny thing is I’m watching this video with the AirPod Max’s
“I’m honestly shocked that we still have customers” 😂😂😂
*Who the hell chose green* 🤣🤣🤣
Who the hell chose green got me
Apple really did just use beats for their headphone tech
This is the best thing of my day and night
Let me get that Ruby and Max Edition
How are you so handsome omg
1:38 well who was expecting that to be so cheap .... Yea cheap.....
I think I'll go with a phone instead of headphones for 550$.
The sound canceling is so good at this point you can only hear the bullshit we tell you at this point
Fun Fact: The only reason ROB made this video was to make an excuse to buy the airpod max
Crazy that a next gen game console is cheaper than that💀💀
"CEO of A$$holes" - Rob Jobs 2021
Ain’t no way the mic sound like that🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ oh hell nah Apple just scamming everyone
Wait , when did I ask for this product ..  🤔🤨
Yep this is a thing now
EVERYONE PRAY TO GOD AND REPENT FOR YOUR SINS GOD IS COMING SOON YOU DONT HAVE MUCH TIME LEFT
If you put on some winter clothes it will literally just look like ear muffs

"It doesn't make any "sense", that's because it makes dollars."-Rob Lopez
when he said the airpods max and ruby i fucking died
1:55
@Apple
Ill stick with my AirPods Pro's, which arent screaming, "I have money to spend!"
@Apple learn from this guy
RØB: "The only thing max is the price" Best joke of the whole video.
bro you really hate apple
The next AirPods should be called “the wast of money when you can buy skullcandy”
Well you bought it so they did something right😂
Hmm what do I want new Xbox Series X or the Airpods Max?
Wasn’t the point of the AirPods to be convenient.... But they made these and called them AirPods....
Æ
Did y’all know he was on jack and Jill with Adam Sandler I knew he looked familiar when I watched that movie my mind was blown😭💀
When you are at a job interview looking good but sounding like shit hit the fan lol
I’m dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣💀
The case could never LOL
Winston Chuchill’s microphone has less noise than this crap
I'll take the Air Pods Mask.
Please don’t tell me that was the actual microphone quality
That audio tho
Its not even a airpod
Imagine if apple commented on this p
The best review to find after actually buying it!! 😂😂  I regret everything😀😀
Imagine next year, it’ll just be like “Introducing the AirPods Mini, using advanced technology we made it as small and compact as possible. So small in fact that you can’t even see it, even with a microscope. Get yours for only $1,000”  Edit: Wow, 888 likes! That’s the most I’ve ever gotten 😊
Go to the UK Apple website, and they have a bank loan option for these. I’m not even kidding. Select the AirPods Max, and you’re presented with an option for an 18-30month loan, approved right on the website. Whatever it takes to take our hard earned money and park 60% of it, in an off-shore tax haven, thanks Apple
I’m starting to think he only does these vids so he has a reason to buy the product.
Best one yet! 👊👊💥
Exactly. They be capping on us. Especially during a virus
Just go work at apple.  Head of marketing.
All the dislikes are from the Apple Executive Board
I have a problem with sadness but when i watch this videos i dont take my Pills of medicine thank you Rob♥️
4:19 I think you meant superior...
I guess you shouldn't buy them then. There is that option
Steve Robs. He robs Jobs 😂😂😂🤣
I would invest in the AirPods Max and Ruby in a heartbeat
I can honestly see apple run into problems why in this day and age are companies making products so dam expensive i mean come on I’m not paying that much for a pair of headphones i can afford to buy them but i just flat out refuse to pay £500 they are just headphones its not as if its a house or a car if i was someone who purchased them i would have just held off as you know what apple are like they will launch new ones this year and say its our best ones yet then the same next year and so on before long an iphone will be priced at £2000 and £1000 for AirPods
Rob jobs, take my money, because... Apple
Robs going to get sued by apple one day
😂
*"And we completely removed wireless charging all together"*      *"INNOVATION"*
Pray to Jesus today you will never regret it a relationship with Jesus is the only way to Heaven explicit rap is the music of the devil don’t listen to it
Yoooooooo how’s that Camry quality SANMSUNG PPL
I like how he makes fun of apple and yet buys their products
they running out of ideas
gold
e
i still have the 2nd gen air pods with no wireless charging *laughs/cries in lower middle class on the verge of being homeless*
Lmao the only thing max about these is the price
3:10 deadass my earbuds died right when he clicked it 🤣😂🤣
I didn’t think they actually existed until I just looked it up now
This shows why people need to get out of the apple ecosystem
Just looks like a pilot headset
That dude Rob should make a parody of this... wait a minute...
Every time he. Does this type of videos I feel like it’s going to get old but it never does
Love this hahahah
It’s been a month. I missed you man. When you realize he has to buy them to do this video🤣🤣
They will get their headphones going then sell Beats off.
I was here before 1 mil views
I don't know why people are surprised they cost so much. It's just Apple being Apple. They think their products are for the people they can afford them.
RUBY AND MAX WAS MY FRICKIN FAVORITE SHOW I A FRICKIN CRUSH ON RUBY
apple lowered the quality of beats and put the beats quality into air pod max
yk what's funny compared to my friends air pod  max and my sony headphones my headphones are way better
I show my mom your apple commercial parodies and she loves them🤣🤣🤣
Airplane headphones 😂
Founder and CEO of assho*le 😂😂
The case looks like some daisy dukes🤣
should be called "airhead max"
"The case could never" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You always roast Apple for their stuff not being honest... but you know the real one not being honest is you since you are buying their stuff... if you were really honest you wouldn't have bought it even if it's for a video... Unless you actually like them and are just putting a facade for clout and YOUTUBE money... DUN!  DUN! DUN!!!!!.   EXPOSED          Godamnit, I need to be more productive instead of doing dumb shit like this breh.
More than the ps5😂😂😂😂😂
This is genius comedy, every time Apple releases a new product we can count on you Røb!
The fact that my AirPods kept cutting in and out during this video is hilarious
Comedy gold
0:38 🔥 😭 😂 most savage thing I heard today
LOL👏🏻
People: What is the most useful thing  Røb Jobs: it cancels out the broke
These vids are hilarious haha.
Luv your vids 😂😂
The music is amazing
4:49 "Doesn't make any cents, because it makes millions of dollars"
Why are soo good
LMFAO!!!!!!!  Mutes out poor people or people with commonsense.
Beautiful sound of privalage 💀

😂😂😂😂
The 1 month wait is totally worth it🤣
“It looks nothing like a bra, they’re totally different things! It provides a lot of support and it makes them look way better in my opinion. *The case could never* .“  They got us in the first half not gonna lie
Aye aye aye yo hold up AirPods Pro are still good tho
To me it looks cool and futuristic but it's probably shit
I'd lie if I say we weren't all waiting for this
I literally did not even know these were a thing until now
im really bothered at why rob lowkey looks like dillon danis
🤣😂😂🤣
Lol
is that really the microphone quality???
the mic part took me out 💀
Hahaha the beautiful sound of privilege 🤣
You can tell he hates Apple, but he hates android even more.
😂😂😂
Even with it's 2M subs, this dude is still underrated in my opinion😒  Hi robs, can I get also a job like you😊 ?
"Founder and ceo of asshole"😂
ok but about 4 months before these came out I was just telling myself I wish apple would have headphones. I was even dreaming about it but airpods don't stay in my ear. So this is crazy for me
What the people that took your parents say to you 2:45
You are way to good at this-
Fun fact: you still want them
That mic part dou
A product no one asked for 😂🤭
This guy makes this look so good exposing how Apple rips off the sheeple.
Me watching this with beats like 👁👅👁
But why bikini as a cover?
Beautiful sound of privilege lol
It’s funny how he makes fun of Apple but buys the product for the vid anyways
$549? Yea right 😂😂
“Ahh the beautiful sound of privilege… gotta love it”                                                                        - Rob Jobs
Socks

You should have mentioned that AirPods max are more expensive than iPhone SE 2
This just gives me Tony Stark vibes
Ah. Privilege.
I lost it at mutes out the poor people.... 😭😂😂😂😂
Ah the sound of privilege there is a reason that the AirPods max are white.
ngl he kind of sound like a apple hater
Imagine listening to this with those on 😂
Am i the only one who thinks they're ugly lol?
when he used the mic 💀
Just put an ad about beats headphones
4:44 lol
"This makes no sense Because makes dollars..."                                                                    -Rob Jobs

Bro I would buy it because you😭💞💞💞
It's Cringe MAX
They should’ve been called the airheads max
at this point you can’t convince me you aren’t the actual ceo of apple.
Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the new overprice headset from apple and today we will be telling u y it sucks
“head pods” 😹
I’m still shocked we have customers 😅😅😅😅
Have you guys seen the clown that hides away from gays people? ?
Yall realise that the AirPods max isn’t actually over priced-   Honestly I’m fed up that people criticise Apple for having high prices as it’s a stereotype, but if you guys at least take a moment to look outside in the real world you would realise that Apple is actually pricing at a ‘normal’ price! Ik this is just a joke and it is funny but sometimes it honestly gets out of hand
yuhhhh
You know it’s expensive when he doesn’t do a give away at the end.
lemme guess the case adds another $200
Knew this was coming when i saw them in the vlogs
Plot twist: he is filming this with a iPhone   Edit: thank you soo much for the likes
Every dislike is a Apple staff because they tired of this 😂
The ending part was the best lol I'm always asking myself the same thing... HOW does Apple still have customers? I can't believe people to pay for their products!
This kind of comedy should have died out in 2008
So u can’t charge on the go?? THAT’S A DOWNGRADE
I have been waitin for this
Wait.. aren’t they just Bluetooth headphones??    The ones u can get for a lot cheaper with more specs like rgb (lights)
Hi im Rob Jobs CEO and founder of asshole ... Apple 😂😂😂
People who play ea games can not laugh at this
Finally
man cant wait for the airpods max pros!
Bro even if I was literally a billionaire I wouldn't buy this crap that apple keeps shoving towards us
Ngl I swear I thought this was a joke they srsly made over-ear headphones what is apple doing???
LMAOOOOOOO
"If Xbox commercials were honest" "If the PS5 commercials were honest"
In India its more than $800
omg this is just gold XD apple in a nutshell
You really remind me of happy (mcu)
next they will make the airpod pro max
Only an OG would know that he had mentioned he would make a video about those headphones in the vlog channel ! Are u that OG? ⬇️😏😂
This isn't the original video! WHAT BULLSHIT
They are worth 50 at best let’s be hot😂
It would be so funny if this guy actually used Apple products
Pink, sky blue, who the hell chose green?
He's black!....I mean back!
The greatest man in history is Jesus. He had no servants, yet they called him master. He had no degree, yet they called him teacher. He had no medicines, yet they called him healer.He had no army, yet kings feared him.He won no military battles, yet he conquered the world.He committed no crime, yet they crucified him.He was buried in a tomb, Yet He lives Today.  Amen.
The panicky undershirt reportedly nod because italy recurrently offend by a elated scorpio. thoughtful, abhorrent sunday
Who bought it? Like fr lol
“So now whenever your not using your headphones, *they’re dying”* 😃
It’s this an actual product ?
Could somebody tell me what he said when the sound was awful
This was the best video I ever watched 🤣
“The people that don’t have the air pod Max are the same people that can’t afford them.” 😂😂  I am people
I never even new these existed
you do know they only raise the price because the president keeps printing more money meaning the value of the dollar is continueing to be lowered
The case could never . LOL 😆
Apple after seeing this:        Write that down!, Write that down!.
👴🏽🕶🤏
“It looks like I’m at the shooting range” 😂😂
Wait is he really the ceo of apple????????????????
Tbh these are really cheap for there contenders
The AirPods max and ruby got me😂😂
Headpods that’s actually a great idea lmao
This series is the best ngl
the mic demonstration was perfect XD
*"CRYSTAL CLEAR AUDIO"*
Customers:"how expensive are they" Apple:Yes
Tbh it’s not really as hard to pronounce as Samsung phones
Apple needs to make more apple products quick for this guy to continue this
They should hire you for commercials
Who the hel* chose green😂😂😂
🤴
You kill these
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
Me who still uses wired earbuds from 2012 👁👄👁
I was dead when he said crystal clear mic 🤣
I thought my headphones broke
4:13 beats?
Was i the only one who at 2:03 thought the device was broken
I JUST REALIZED THESE ARE AN ACTAUL PRODUCT
The sound of privilege had me cracking up so bad. So true.
THANK YOU HAHA 😂❤️ i needed this
Not the Airpod masks
The design is expensive 😂😂😂
Am I the only one who hates the shape of this headphone?
truth is these are one of the best headphones out there,theyre expensive but so is every other "audiophile" headphones but this shit is funny lmao
These aren’t funny anymore sorry rob
Lol
They look like a five below version of headphones
"It doesn't make any sense, that's because it makes dollars" touché young sir🦗
I got excited for a second when he talked about the extra bacon cheeseburger of CarlsJr 😂😞
It would have been funny if when he said that it looks like a braw the video turned into a woman’s braw advertisement for a minute
REPENT YE FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND.......JESUS CHRIST IS LORD.
Lost it at the mic
This guy is never gonna be out of content...As long as apple launches new product😂😂
Hahahaha so you'll never buy beats again
Is the mic really that bad? Lol
RØB: "It doesn't make cents, because it makes dollars."   me: "mind blown"
Expensively & Automatically mutes out all of the poor ppl! 😂😂😂
Who the hell choose green! 😄😂
yall gotta clap it up for rob, he spent probably over 500 dollars so we can watch this. Respect
3:10 hahahahaha im dead dude h
I like how he keeps a straight face everytime he talks
😂😂😂😂
It's so good
Next they are going to sell a microphone the quality of a headphone mic and the price of a car
I want the airpods macs
Funny thing is... he bought them!!😂
The beginning was already funny.
I love this guy 😂♥️🥰
My brother in law brought this and i just - what ? Apple have headphone now and what about your airpod pros 🙄
apple makes really overpriced headphones: its only $550, its really not that bad
I would like a pair of AirPods max and ruby.
Wouldn’t be surprised if they invented the AirPods Pro max air lite 2   headphone less wires 🥶🥶🥶
Bruh u gotta update them with a new feature to flood themselves lol
Your merch honestly socks...
Bruh those r so ugly
hey r u that cool kids bopper
#40 on trendingggg
Dammit they just be headphones, the local gas station has better headphones.
woah have i been sleeping for a year straight?! when did you go from 500k to 2M subscribers??   Love u Rob <3
lmaooo what a beast
really tho this max thing came outta nowhere
He never misses.
0:37 you mean “to be honest the only thing max about these AirPods *IS* the price;” grammar bro😌🤚🏾
Beats by jobs
not a shooting range lmfaoo
people who think rob jobs carry the channel ➟
04:40 is so true. I wonder this all the time. Then I realize I'm a millennial and our ranks are full of shallow, self-righteous, arrogant, entitled brats, mentally ill and those who find it painfully to think critically for themselves.  Comically ... millennials think "Karen's" are older women but what they fail to realize is that "Karen" is more likely to be in her mid-late 30s and mid-40s. Depending on the scale you use for millennials, "Karen" is a millennial woman. Think about that.
2:03 i thought my headphones was going to die lol
Yo the muc this is so true for the air pod pros, its not worth the money
1:00 you probably can't hear yourself when wearing those huh
"So whenever you're not using them, they will die" LMAOOOOO
i didn’t even know this was a thing.... i thought he made this up...
Bro, the intro was fire!!! 😂😂😂
0:00 I haven’t even played the video and I already know this guy gon be spitting facts.
Funny asf🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣👌🤘
nice
every time apple  puts something out I always look forward to these videos.
absolute legend
*AirPods Max & Ruby* ....I remember that show
Founder and CEO of wut....😂
Nothing but facts in this video
$20 FOR SOCKS?!?!?
The fact that u can get an new series X instead of headphones
Lol
Give it to apple to produce useless, expensive garbage, the video on the other hand is hilarious
“It doesn’t make any ‘cents’ ,that’s because it makes dollars” -wise apple man
I thought he was joking when he said 550 dollars and I googled it for the real price. I am now dead inside because my whole IPhone SE is is 400. Just plz buy a ps5 instead Lol
Max and Ruby lmao Im dead
The mic quality
Im excited for new Apple products just for Rob to make a parody about them
2:12 Wtf he is saying, even subtitle can't gets it Dayum microphone
Nobody : Roasts every apple product but still buys every thing
The first line got me laughing as hell 🤣🤣😆😆
Haha you make me laugh every vid
Roses a red violets are blue we high prices, yep we don’t sell to people like you.
I missed this content.. 😆
he should actually start to act, this is so funny 🤣
He just can’t miss 😂
I'm sorry but in my eyes a person has achieved peak clown status if I see them wearing these ridiculous-looking overpriced ear muffs out in public lol
is that how the mic on those things actually sound?
As an apple fan I can say that some of their products went downhill, and improvements aren’t too different.
"yoo, this is the wrong teleprompter" LMFAOO GOT MEE
Think this guys a Samsung user
A certain part of this vid reminded me of @nigahiga
It’s the background music for me 🤣🤣🤣
nobody wants not fucking head phones
“Sure they’re useless but you’ll look like rich piece of garbage but that’s why you buy iPhones right”
One day after 2 generations , people be like : those mofos spent so much money for this ?
This is amazing
I missed other commercial like this one, yessir yessir
As a 16 year old with a job. I can say I can buy these but I won’t because they are simply the most expensive piece of shit headphones I’ve ever seen. It’s also a very bad investment.
Apple really should pay you for these videos.
Yess! A new episode of my favorite series!
They not pods no more, they whole spaceships
0:37 the only thing 'Max' about these airpods were the price XD
i rather get myself a ps5 then dis
“Founder and CEO of asshole.. APPLE” I lost it💀💀
AirPods Max and Ruby
lmao
I knew you would come with this video
Rob: “Who the hell chose green?”  Me: cries*
Is that what the sound actually sounds like
"Who the hell bough green" Marques Brownlee: Yes
I liked the video as soon as you said asshole 😂😂😂😂
"How expensive are they?" *"YES"*
You should post bloopers
Can you please do a CD RED Cyberpunk 76 parody advertisement?
My nigga, apple should hire you. I would hire you.
Bro I missed you bro😭😭😭😭😂😂😂
It’s rly funny how he makes fun of them. But he still buys them😂😂😂
FINALLY 😩🔥
Plot twist: he was a worker at Apple and got fired so he just decided to roast them ( more like say facts lol )
says a guys who sells a pair of socks for 10 bucks and you must buy two pairs.. bro, those two pairs cost 50 cents. Someone define overpriced again
The ceo of apple like damn he right but he don’t care and wanna go to hell for the rest of his life
At this point it’s just status
The fact he bough the airpods max for the videoo PLUS SUB TO LLS VLOGSS
"The most common question we get is "How expensive are they?", and the answer to that is always "Yes, they are"
🤣🤣🤣
Lol
Those mic cuts are hilarious, how tf did he get that audio 😂
"it provides a lot of supports and, in my opinion, makes them look better...the case could never" -Rob, 2021
1:51 Hitting a bit too close to home there buddy...
Can't wait for the Apple Car.
first 0:06 seconds and i already laughed, well played
literally I struggled to connect my AirPods this whole video but only one will connect
That last piece of music @sickickmusic
This is amazing lol I can't..... how do you even keep a straight face
They should’ve put this out when beats were popular I’m pretty sure more people would’ve bought that
I got these for Christmas and immediately returned. Uncomfortable, TERRIBLE sound, hard to clean. Swapped out for Air Pods Pro and saved $500. What a f-ing joke.
How expensive are they? Yes, they are😂😂
They are actualy good sounding
Rob Jobs someone I'd prefer to meet over asshole- I mean uh, apple workers
I am ceo if asshole
1:48 😂😂🤣😭

🧍🏾‍♀️ uh I bought the green 👁👄👁

2:03 BRI I CANT
Normal people: "Apple is so expensive" Dumb people: "Apple is so expensive but im gonna buy it anyways"

It doesn’t make sense, it makes dollars  Brilliant
Funfact: _HE_ ALREADY HAVE AIRPOD PRO MAX  AND AN IPHONE 12 PRO MAX🙂
That's why he didn't offer a giveaway now
next year: new airpod pro max hydropower extra battery and customizable hydro dip for an extra 787 dollars which never comes off and ended up looking like a 2 year old splattered paint on it.       Buy yours today
No way that the mic quality
Airpods Macs Hairpods Max Airpods masks Airpods Max & Ruby Airpods mini Macs Airpods Big Macs lmfao
No headphone Jack on the headphones... The case that looks like a bra  40 usd charging cable sold separately
In india it costs 900$ 😭
Entire commercial in 1 word: *Expensive*

That s the real sound of the mic???
if you think it’s useless then why did you buy it dumbo

This is kinda funny. I can't describe it but it's pretty hilarious. Hahahahhaha it might be his facial expression 😆
Gotta love this guyy  😂😂
It’s literally just headphones without wires
Only good thing about apple is the phones fr
Plot twist he makes these videos so he has an exuse to buy the products
Dude, those microphones suck
*can't hear those poor ppl still using the og airpods, i'm on noise cancellation*
AirPods max are fugly 😂
if cisco from the flash made an airpods max review!
People who didnt buy the airpods pro max poor. They just made a good decision in other products with better audio quality

“Ass hole” *”Apple”* 💀😂
I lost it at max and ruby 😂😂
So basically most apple products in a nut shell
Copyyyy... Copied content fromm aasish chanchalaniji😂💥

My fucking left airpod isnt recognized and the case keeps flashing when I put it in!!! Anyone have a fix?? And no I won’t go to the apple store cuz I got these a while ago and I don’t got warranty
The thing is, you vuy them and probs use them
This is hilarious
Apple should actually feature Rob in one of their commercials
Rob Jobs don't buy this they are horrible, ROB proceeds to buy them a for video. XD
🤑🤑
0:58 ""mute out the poor people" ANC in a nutshell"
All the dislikes are apple employees
AIRPODS BIC MACS, for when you get hungry and wanna jam.🤣
Rob: roasts the AirPods max  Also Rob: buys them for himself
ROB Jobs at it again
the merch line was smooth
They’re so ugly
You really found a way to add Max and Ruby.... I'm proud
That Microphone didn't need any ROB troll at all! LOL
“It doesn’t make any sense, that’s because it makes dollars” 😂😂😂  Guess that’s one sentence that perfectly sums up Apple.
Why you dont post that much
I’m still stuck over the fact that some headphones cost more than a high tech iPhone
Lol
“Mutes out the poor people”🤣🤣
Apple: *releases a product*  Rob: "ahhhh shit here we go again"
I just wanted to say somethin  He is doing this video just for fun ( gotta say it's really funny ) and not true Airpods max has great sound and stuff If you wanna know more go watch dankpods video about them
“Who the hell chose green”😂😂😂
Its the wireless charging that hits me lol
Bts  this video is edited in mackbook 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ever since the shitty Airpods Max releases I've been waiting for this video.
That's the definition of bra
Keep making more
This sounds like Rudy Mancuso’s parody...
When the Squad of Friends got AirPods Max. That’s the future.🤦🏻‍♂️😂
One of the best reviews I've ever heard from a CEO in a while. Ahmm. JK
“Don’t buy beats because we already did for 2.3 Billion” 😂 😂
You can fool people to buy one 😂😂😂
Robs Jobs😂 never getting old.
The space they saved from the new iPhone box has been used for the new AirPods Max’s box
I love how je has to buy every single one of the products he’s destroying
Bloopers?
Those aren’t AirPods they are headphones
I saw post saying these look like school computer lab headphones and they be right 😌
Irony : He buys apple products for parody!
Lmao fo how expensive are they: RØB the answer is yes, yes thy are😆
Would you like to buy a gaming console at 600 doll or cushioned earphone with bass
“It doesn’t make any sense... and that is because it makes dollars” lmaooo
I always enjoy watching these vids😂😂
😂😂😂
k
The mic test got me
So what is your real opinion on these ?
when you said the different versions was definitely the best part 1:50
At this point , I'm honestly shocked we still have any customers , I mean it doesn't make any sense.
I love this guy. His videos are just sooo funny 😆
The big macs got me
i have them bot
The mike OMFG 😭😂
The moment when you notice you are using AirPods Pro to watch this video
Lmao Yuh
Imagine the real CEO of asshole oof i meant apple is watching this...
Screw Apple, they literally are always "creating solutions" to problems they created themselves.....   This time it's the battery. Someone went "Hey you know what would be great? If these NEVER turned off!"  But then they're like: "Well how're we gonna sell them to the customer and gloss over it?"  "INTRODUCING: uLtRA LoW pOWeR SaViNg mOdE!!"  (like you really couldn't let ppl just turn them off? Like every single other headphone..??)
It’s muting the poor people for me 🤣🤣
have every apple product lol
Are those real!?!?!?!?!?!?
Next video if Samsung was honest
Still waiting for apple to get this guy banned....     *NOT THIS IS A JOKE I LOVE WHAT YOU ARE DOING FIGHT THE POWER!*
They always amaze us
“Space gray, pink, sky blue, who the hell chose green ... “ .  This one really really good 😂🤣😂
3:09  Absolutely love that sound feeling.
I love how they more than the ps5 and with the money left over you could by a better sounding headset
Me watching this video wearing the AirPods max👁👄👁
Bruh. That case looks so much like a bra, it makes 13 year old boys go “AWOOOGA”
He slowly becomes more and more disrespectful as these products come out 😂😂😂
Due 666 Views
Just get beats. It’s cheaper and probably better.
“I-It doesn’t make any cents, that’s because it makes dollars, millions and millions of dollars.” Got me dyinggg🤚😭
Hmmm I think we found a new ceo

Idk what this is
THE RETURN OF THE KING
When we could of had airports pro2 and they come out with this...
I like that "who the hell chose green" color.
Mine Boat r better costs just 750 Rs😂
Also I thought this was if Apple was honest, they do look like a bra.
Yeeees
Rob jobs: *going to mc drive* "Can i have one Airpods bigmacs" Someone who works there: "Ofc sir, that wil be 680 dollars"
Bro one day apple is going to ask you to do a commercial for them
Yes
Doesn't make any sense.....because it make dollars.
He is one of the absolute best jokers on YouTube, you legend!

Yo where is the Samsung s21 video - *it’s the same shit*
Apple : It doesn’t make sense.But it makes dollars.Millions and millions of dollars
Why no one talks about how affordable the is
Hilarious.
"It looks nothing like a bra..."  *Then later* "It provides a lot of support and it makes them look better.... The case could never"  This was gold😂
You are a Genius!!! 😂😂😂
Airpods max ultra plus
" ITS JUST TOO GOOD"
"So whenever you're not using them, they will die" LMAOOOOO

Yesterday's technology for tomorrow's prices.                                  ~Apple
he had enough dedication to buy the airpod max for this video
Willne needs to do this ad so it’s a square on a square😂
you weirdly look a lot like Jim Halpert
The first time wireless charging was introduced in airpods actually was the second gen
Rob said they are inferior
Can't wait for you to do the apple car one
Is nobody gonna talk about the mic quality in the AirPods Max

ME: How expensive are they Rob: Yes
Who the hell chose green

I love how he complain about every new thing that comes out but buys them so he can complain about them 😂😂😂
These headphones are such a waste of moneyyyy
IMO these are ugly, fight me 😪
bruh, drop that skin care routine
He makes fun of apple, but he still buys them products... 👀
Airpods pro 2 price - 600$
"The people who dont have the airpod max are the people who cant afford them" LMAOO
I am convinced not to buy it because of this
Over the head, wait no over the ear headphone🤣🤣
Bluetooth headsets hello!!🤔😐🙃
Imagine promoting and criticising the product at the same time 😂
he had to buy them to make this...
wait, they dont have wired charging
Founder and CEO of a**holes "APPLE" . Lol that got me .
Why did you take so long!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lmao 🤣🤣🤣 XD btw love the video
APPLE : Oh shit ....... here we go again!!!
On behalf of Apple,thank you for this free advertisements,we don't have to spend a penny for this free commercial
1:24 Excuse me EXCUSE ME Im that "Hell" who buys green headphones
Is Rob Lopez & Macro the same people?
I’m starting to wonder if he actually works at Apple🤔
Humorous content
Shits getting shitier.
" *The most frequently asked questions about them is......... how costly are they ?* "  *And the answer to dat is YES*
There more pricy then the ps5
Steve Jobs left the Chat !!!
I remember watching the first one of these and thinking it was hilarious, then ever since then these vids have just been bland
I really plan on leaving apple
I could watch this guy do this for hours
Ok this time Apple took it too far with the price😳 $50 cheaper than the iPhone 11😳😳😳😳😳
This is the funniest video I’ve ever seen
Always enjoy watching him saying these things....hahahahaahhahahah great work man !!!
The only reason it’s not called “AirPods Pro Max” is because then they wouldn’t have a name for next year
Noise cancellation; Me just Vibing down the street during a shootout and FBI raid
"Hi, I'm Rob Jobs, founder and CEO of Asshole"
Killed at the entry
“Looks like you’re at the shooting range” that was on point lol
i thought my headphones broke at 2:04, almost had a heart attack😂
The comments make this even more funnier
Rob if apple was honest: also rob  owns all the products
MAX AND RUBY 😂😂😂🤣
How expensive are they? Yes
apple must hate this man.
The people that disliked are the Apple employees
Why did I start dyin when he said “they ask how expensive they are and the answer is always yes”😂😂😂
Starting was the best
The offer up app part was so accurate 😂😂
Lmaooooo it looks like a bra
😂😂😂, not to buy Beats by Dr. Dre? I could just buy JBL or Harman Kardon
ur literally always making "commercials" about how useless these stuff are and then u go ahead and buy it
Aaahaha, boneless tongue!! Like his videos!)))
They look like 2010's dogshit headphones
Who the hell choose green😂😂😂
He looks like alex costa.
I thought this was fake lmao
I fucking lost it when he used the airpods microphone
You know there’s a Mac for 55k

Here in Brazil, the AirPods Max costs 1400 dollars...
Imagine they had the airpod mask😂
Dudes sold headphones for the price of a iPhone 😂😂
Ayo... is the microphone that bad????
Its funny that you actually bought it 😂
My goodness. Best quote it doesn’t makes sense... it makes dollar, millions of dollars. That was baller bro
I bet he uses an iPhone
Rob making fun of how pointless and expensive airpods max is  Apple: "jokes on you cuz u still bought our products🤣"
Apple will literally put their logo on outdated cheese, overprice it and people would still buy it
I got a real question.. Why won't people who use the Apple Ecosystem confront Apple on their Bullshit.. Premium is one thing, but ripping people off is another.. no matter how much money you do or don't have SMH
Mutes out the poor people HAHAHAHAHAHAH
awww i wanted the “hi, i’m rob jobs, and i... rob jobs.” intro again :(
OMG When he said expensive, I thought they'd be like 100+. They cost more than 500!!!
Rob jobs: mutes out the poor people, ah the beautiful sound of privilege.  Me: buying Airpods max.  Tinnitus: Hello there
"How expensive are they?"  "Yes."
Can we call this as sugar coated peppermint 🤔🤔
I can't believe I laughed at the first ten seconds
the way 01:23 screams FACTS.
Be careful man, Tim Cook might be on the plans to put up a hit on you for bad publicity😂
2:03 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can always rely on him for a review 😌
Damn!! This guy robbed our hearts and eyes 🤍
Was keenly waiting for Rob Jobs😁
I LOVE that you're doing the same with Apple.:D Releasing a new video for Airpods Max - or whatever Apple decided to call the same product this week - while you already have one on Airpods. Of course at least this is a new video and not the same video with a different name... LOL
when he started talking through the mic
HeadPods rings much better
Apple customers are on a whole different level of dumb 👁👄👁
let’s all appreciate mans bought airpods max for a skit
2:03  Good to know that my beats are not broken but it’s just what it is
Your too good at this been serious and funny
“How expensive are they? Yes”
" And of course a power block. No power block?"
It does not look like a bra it looks like a butt crack I mean the protective case and the headphone hits together when you take them out
1:59  I’m buying those ASAP
this channel basically sums up what i dont like about apple
I wonder what wish products are going to look like now
These video are the only reason why I don’t suicide lmao
These videos are so good and so accurate, who else was pissed off that apple made the new AirPod like this?
Bruh, fr these are so expensive. I can just but some Beats for like $425 less
customer: how expensive are they ? rob jobs : yes
Asshole🤦🏻‍♂️Apple LOL gotta love Rob

* Rob buying Airpods Max to roast the Airpods Max*  Apple: Mission failed successfully
Mute the poor people. 😭
Assple

Skullcandy is looking all the more like eye candy after seeing these.
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen! Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out.
As for shooting range 😂
How much is it ?  Yes
When you realise he has to buy the product to do these

Only 🌈🐻 buy this shit
They are so expensive even you took so much time to make a video on it..
Me watching this with my airpods 1. 😳😳😳
TFW theres no "apple headphones, pro, max, 100, lite"
After a year iPhone 13 pro max costs 100,000,000,000,000,000$ and you'll buy it cause you're dumb
The fact that he bought airpods max to roast airpods max is ironic
Lol 😂
Lol i see he's a green hater
Actually it doesn't make sense (cent) it makes dollars millions and millions of Dollars
Hi umm...so I was promised a free  western extra bacon cheeseburger from Carl's Jr if I watched this?
I've been waiting for this.
I am sure that Steve jobs has taken loan from him

Is a product no one never ask
How expensive they are?  ✨Yes✨

They cost more than PS5 😱😱😱
I love apple. I love you hating on apple. I love hating on apple. So i hate apple.
😂😂😂

I am gonna put some dirt in your eye Ups sory . Wrong chanel
Who the hell choose green?
4:48 So True!!
Bro what the actual FUCKA is that mic
Engineer : whats is the name of the next headphone ?  Apple ceo : yes
Jobs didn’t rob, right?
it should be declared a holiday everytime rob uploads an apple commercial
And just how expensive are they? “Yes!” 🤣😂😂
The mic part killed me hahaha
you can get a fricking rtx 3070 for $499
It's not funny
LMAO BYE
Airpods pro are better than this.
well u actually bought them tho
You bought em tho didn't you? So they are doing something right. The make money soo...
How expensive are they          YES
The headphones r pretty much just for people who want to flex
Rob is the CEO until Apple files a defamation case.
“Ah the beautiful sound of privilege” 😅😅
Apple: Introducing Airpods Max.  My wallet: Don't look at me.
Yeah the only Max thing about it is price!!🤣🤣
When the world needed him the most ... he returned...
OKAY BUT WHY IS NOONE TALKING ABOUT THE BRA JOKE HAHAHAHAHAHA
Plot twist:Apple sends him their product for promotion.
Wtf ugly af
Big mac
My crush for him gose bigger watching every new video of his
0:57 *"I love how the Airpods Max conveniently and automatically mutes out the poor people"* Me: *why can't I speak anything?*
As soon as I hear that music... I know I’m in the right place 😂
Lmao i love how it mutes all the poor people. jokes af.
Its just look like helicopter headphones 😂, maybe it is but with different name and price😂
Dang now I want to get me an AirPods Max & Ruby...
You are an amazing CEO apple will be getting no purchases sorry I mean so many purchases
Plot twist: Just like apple, Rob keeps making the same apple commercial videos with little difference and we keep watching nevertheless 🙂
‘Who the hell picked green’ 😂😂
"It doesn't make cents, because it makes dollars, millions of dollars"                             ~ *Rob Jobs*
Finally
All apple wants is money money money MONEY
Apple is going way too far on this things...
Me with my used beats that I got on an eBay auction for 30 bucks 😎
bruh said by the one who's selling socks for $20
The shooting range😂😂
HAHAHAHHAA
I’m sure he got that last part from mwtb
i mean it doesn't make any sense .... Yes, that's because it makes dollars😭
Now the AirPod Big Macs sounds like a good idea
it honestly should’ve been called HeadPods
Apple honestly take money from us , and these people take money from us using their name.
Recommendations 😁
Did you actually just buy the AirPod Max 😂
You missed the main point : it works only with Android phones
Great video.☺️
I do! I choose green 😂
You really do live up to your name
''now we are at the peak of technology. with the help of our wonderfuf and hardworking developers we were finally able to completely remove wireless charing altogether''
Steve Jobs is saying f... you from the other world
the Mic is so Amazing💀💀💀
It doesn’t make any sense but makes money. That’s makes sense. Lmao wow
Smooth ending 😂😂
Airpods big Maccs🤣
I know you do a lot. But I really wanna say this is better than TV, movies. Anything even. WW84
I thought my AirPods broke... OMGGGG thank god :). 2:03
Wait there’s actually no power button
Once off youtuber
Air pods ain’t a flex no more these head phones are now
It doesn't make any cents... It makes dollars. Millions of dollars.

I am waiting for this for a long time
Briljant...! And so so true.!
hahah..very cool. smash apple
then u started selling ur socks at 20$ 😏😶
is the mic really that bad XD
Now we need apple to release a bunch of stuff so that Rob can make more of this
“We invested a lot of money into achieving the best sound anyone has ever heard...and not enough into our design.” 😂😂😂
So when your not using the headphones... They are dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I would nominate you to in the Oscar 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
They look like headphones that a sped kid would wear😭😭
It got me at”who the hell chose green”🤣🤣
“The people that don’t have airpods max are the same people who can’t afford them.” 😭😭😭
Do Android ❤ phones or accessories
How expensive are they? Apple: YES.
We are APPLE "We sell yesterdays technology for tomorrows price".
2:10 this real???😂😂😂😂
So this 538 people who dislike are the ones who choose green?🤔
WE TRENDING!!!
"it doesn't make any sense because we make dollors"  😂😂🤣I died
“Who the hell chose green?” dankpods:
Hi am ceo of a***ole 😂😂
the thumbsdowns are clearly the ppl who work for apple
*“it provides a lot of support and it makes them look a lot better in my opinion......the case could never”*
This guy here makes fun of apple, uploads it, earns money from youtube, buys Apple products and you, the one who's watching it can't even afford it😂😂😂😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭😂😭
Lmfaoo
I saw this coming.
Damn bro you got demonetized
Finally It is here🤣
If headphones price is 550$ than who can afford apple EV car  ???
Who the hell choose green
“And to be honest the only thing max about these AirPods are the price” bro I’m an apple fan and that killed me dude 💀
I’m waiting for an actual Apple’s adv with Rob. The world needs this.
Who the hell picked green 🤣
True
I don’t know why, but in my opinion you look a lil bit like Walter O‘brian from Scorpion.🥸
i live in australia and we have bad currency and it’s 900 dollars
We should have added "pro"  to the name
“Who approved these” i just can’t 😂😂
Seriously waiting for this😂😂😂
This is sooooo good  Who de fuck choose green
Why are the airpods max more than a 8th gen ipad?
I refuse to believe these actually exist until I’ve seen someone in them in person
2:03 earape started 😂😂
"Mutes out the poor people"                                         - Rob Jobs 🤣🤣🤣
How Expensive Are They? Yes!
why does the case literally like a bra💀
That's a real thing??? I thought that product was a joke when I saw a parody from another youtuber 👁👁👁👁
how are you able to say all of these things with a straight face
The dislikes are from rich daddy apple fanboys
Honestly a better name would have been steal jobs 😂😂
"The only thing max about the air pods is it's price"- it was legendary
every product apple product he critique..he bought it lol
This is best version yet 🤣
People can buy this shit but have excuses for ps5 price when they were releasing it
"How expensive are they?" "Yes"
I'm Italian, and I'm used to listen to English video with subtitles, and I love the fact that at 2:04 not even the auto-generated subtitles are not capable of understand the voice of the build-in microphone, amazing.
Those are ugly af
I look forward to your videos everytime apple launches a new product. 🤣
I was waiting for this videoo🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This man had a bad a experience with apple products then decided to make a video and now he has 2m followers
I love piano
Didn’t even know these existed. 550? Hell naw
I’d rather buy a ps5 than that piece of crap
can you do this to DC?
This video made me laugh, but there are stupid people that take this as absolute truth. This is the only problem of this video
3:45  It took me a second to realize he was talking about the bra not the case omg
“Ah, the beautiful sound of privilege.” BYE- 😭
Damn fuckin skilled this guys is😂subbeddd
"Hi. Im Rob Jobs, founder and CEO of asshole.. aPpLe" LMAO THAT SENT MEEEE
Americans? I have a question for you. What kind of devices's brand do you use more ofter? Apple, Samsung, Huawei (Lmao), Xiaomi etc?
Wait wtf is that shit
Omfg finally
$550???!!! Turtle beach headphone are a lot cheaper and have better sound quality!!!! WTF Apple???
This is spot on 😂😂😂
Lol
An Apple product a year, makes your money disappear.
"The only thing Max about these AirPods are the price"
Bruh I can't believe that some headphones that don't have a power button are more expensive that a next gen console I'm dying 🤣
The dislikes are from the apple employees
Apple:lower specs, for a higher price :)
Air pods max and ruby😂
The only thing I look for when a new apple product comes out
4:01 airpods max are designed for the rich americans who are tryna blow up schools.
As a tech guy, the Airpods Max were known as the biggest flop of 2020. Simply because of it's Price : Features ratio. It was basically shit at 550$ The Sony WH1000-XM4s cost half of their price and delivers way more features than that. And had positives compared to the Airpods Max at every category. One can buy 2 of these Sony's at the price of that Airpods. So it was a clear failure of 2020!
I think this channel gets huge support from Apple In the name of parody apple is indirectly advertising
Rob was looking little bit sad and ill
The thumbs down are people who bought the product or works for apple. It cant be neither
Unbelievable 😂😂🤣🤣
I love the line "the cover doesn't."
4:55 ... Trillions and trillions,actually.
"It looks nothing like a bra they are totally different things.It's provides a lot of support and makes them look way better" 😂
Is it weird that these videos are still kinda advertising apple products
This honest review
The heaphones look awful
you sir.. are a legend. have a cookie 🍪
Loveee watching thesee 🤩
The headphones are unique and maybe not for everyone but they tried
How expensive are they? Rob: YES
Anyone who is offended by this  Are people who have it or are considering to buy it ,in which case please don't buy Get Sennheiser's or Sony's they are much better , talking from experience
The mic test lmfao
I was waiting for this since Airpodmax launched.

Them things are ugly 🥲
Is that dead ass the mic
..who the hell chose green😂
2:48 you genuinely confused me I started scratching my head and had to replay this part and make sure I was saying it right myself.
Who the hell puts dislikes? Like apple fans who bought apple product and now are mad because of truth, lol
The title should of been : before you buy AirPods watch this
Apple is basically designer at this point
" Asshole... apple" 😂😂😂
This video made 456k views a day and the others made it in a mouth🤔that’s tuff😗
Welcome to ass hole got me straight away 😂😂😂😂
Yep let's all just shit on apple every single year, while simultaneously keep them one of the most successful companies in existence. Humans are ironic

Ahh. The Beutiful sound of privilege

ⁿ⁰           ⁿ⁰          ⁿ⁰         ⁿ⁰           ⁿ⁰        ⁿ⁰           ⁿ⁰
But still apple is hot chick

0:06 😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You do cringe about them and buy the same product profiting them 😅
HAHAHAHA privilege
Me still rocking the $30 EarPods, these things are great btw and they sound awesome for the price
"Hi, I am Rob Jobs, founder and CEO of a**hole" ☠️
The weary ferry conversly extend because invoice partly long in a bad promotion. jumpy, short history

Funniest is thing inn history💯😭😭wth man your so fucking funny🤣🤣😂
Damn it’s trending 🥶🥶
I waited 2 months YEA
Yes this is the best
im watching this while im using my beats lmao
First video of you getting suggested and God damn your work is dope 😂
I thought my phone is broken for a second there😳
I think Apple silently pays this guy for marketing their devices,just imagine
I DIED WHEN THE MICROPHONE PART PLAYED
"...and to be honest the only thing max about these is the price!" 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Goddamnit that got me roflmfao
I have a question..have you ever got sued by Apple 😂😂😂😂😂
"Haha" haha that was funny 😂
Yesss
I’m sorry guys real talk I wouldn’t be caught dead wearing those😥😥 I’ll stick to the pros 😂
2:06  why do you sound like Trump😭
If you would get a life and stop hating like a 5 year old kid that would be awesome ya know
Meanwhile Razer has created a smart mask.. I really hope to see a video for that
But the main thing is he got all apple products 😂😂😂
Nice 👍 rob jobs
I could buy some beats for like 250 dollars and looks and probably sounds better then the headphones max
4:44 “I’m still shocked that we still have customers” I love Apple but I’ll never buy a new product that just got released. I love my iPhone 6s.
His next commercial will just be Apple Oxypod - Price $999.99 - Nothing Included (Why? Because fuck you that's why) - No Warranty - Not including Tax and Free Shipping
is that really the audio of the max's? lol
Makes me remember of Rudy’s pineapple promo xD
Q: How expensive are they    A: Yes they are
How expesive are they?  Yes, they are
Lol I think I died
airpods max&ruby 🤣
" ...who the hell chose green and silver " 😂😂😂
Ashish chanchalani copy
Airpods Masks would sell alot ngl
😂😂😂😂😂😂🔥 is
Where do I pay?😂
Daaaaaamn I remember Beats by dr.Dre, it was like everywhere back in the days!
The only exception to buy them is to make a video like this 😂
I just find it funny that in order to make these videos he has to actually buy the products
Steve jobs' ghost made 500 fake accounts to dilike this video
it looks like i am at a shooting range
wtf is wrong in the name?! This person finding unnecessary issues with apple products! His main aim is just to get views and money by saying shit about apple!!!!! His almost every video is about telling shit about apple products!! such an asshole !!!!!!
Man everytime I watch one of your vids I keep laughing non stop
Lmfao I love this
those dislikes are from apple employes!!
No offense but it's crazy how ur knowingly roasting em and then providing the link to get em too😂😂😂😂😂
Think steve jobs watching this and making it his sale video 😂😂🤣🤣
Love your vids
Thanks YouTube for recommending this channel.
2:03  I thought my earphones got damaged 🙏
i love the way he makes fun of apple but still buys each and every product
The sad thing is people are still going to buy it
Ok hear me out, I already have too many wall ports 😂 so they can keep them
“Who the hell chose green?”
2:03 i died 😭😭
Wait is there really no power button?
Lmao😂
Is the mic actually that bad?
That’s gonna be brutal
Colors come in... Who the Hell choose Green. 🤣🤣
'what works for them and take it to our product and you'll never hear from them again' damn, ain't that the truth (also from other businesses)
Me: “How could anyone buy apple’s products anymore”  Also Me: *on a iPad”
"It doesn't make sense (cents)... that's because it makes dollars, millions of dollars"
Airpod max stuff are going on trending. Nice
Why isn't this in Trending section pf YouTube.
You should start posting more frequently 😃
Roasting it while flexing it
This man does a better job of advertising apple products than apple themselves. 🤣
Ur not allowed to make “asshole apple” a sentence
Wait at 2:04 is that the actual voice clarity of the airpods max?
*The background music is legendary*
I need to cop those airpods max and rubys😩
Bro still doing these Apple videos 😂
"It provides a lot of support and it makes them look way better in my opinion."    *The case could never*
Who tf puts a noise cancellation button but not a power button!? And do the headphones come without any volume or pause button? And price for all that is $550! Half the price of an iphone and double the price of an average android smartphone 📱 😂😂   Edit: forgot to include the point about "charging" but a anyway these points above would already convince any sane person not to buy one of these.
We: OH! It's apple's new product. Rob: New video coming soon guys.     Rob (secrectly): It's time for payday. 😂😂
Rob Jobs is essentially saying that the AirPods Max sucks. He has some endless tea to spill and we know we are always here for that!
This made....too much sense. How is this statement possible?!???
So they took a step back to go forwards
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"It provides a lot of support and makes them look a lot better the case could never" 😆 🤣
I love the fact dat if you rewind the vid the song did not rewinded ahahahhaha
We got them in sky blue and who the hell wanted Green 😂😂😂
Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰❤️
At this point I'm doubtful whether the original CEO is Tim Cook or Rob
"It's for muting poor people " that was the best part it burns 😁👏🏾
Apple releases products this guy finally makes videos
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
This guy is born to use and roast Apple products 😂
Kinda over doing it for 5mins no commercial is 5mins
imagine apple sponsors him
I'm so glad my little cousin THATS 3 YEARS OLD showed me ROB I would never find amazing content
I'm just confused where they think were gonna get that type of money for headphones
People who hate this video is the people are the apple products fanatics
Best except for Beats
¯\_༼ •́ ͜ʖ •̀ ༽_/¯
I just don’t understand why they couldn’t call the Airphones-
im imagining lovelivecerse making a airpods pro max users be like
You bought them
the fact that i havent heard of these til now is enough to tell you they are pointless.
The fact he buys all these products 😂
Who the hell chose green omg bro
sounds like a tampon airpods max absorption
tony stark?
Imagine Apple hiring you for there commercials 🤣🤣🤣
im no apple fan but the airpods max is actually nice sounding
Rob Maxx😂
Ok this man really bought them for a 5 minutes video dam lol
What the hell green 😂😂
Basically these are $550 shooting range muffs that play music
Best merch Segway ever
RIP headphone users 2:02
Been waiting for this😂❤️
Well these Apple products he uses also gets him view and thus money
Im pretty sure apple is gonna sell a apple lamborgini for 500k usd
I bet Tim cook is just testing how far he can go until no one buys it anymore
He looks like Drake
1:23 MKBHD choose green😂
Watching with Airpods Max on..        Said no one ever..
"Founder and CEO of Asshole........Apple"😂😂😂😂
I wonder how many times apple has tried to sue this man 😂😂😂
And most importantly expensive 😂😂😂
Who the hell choose green MKBHD: 👀
Is that really the mic lmao
But my merch is not 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This video just made my day 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️
He had to buy theese R I P
Can we just appreciate him, He buys every Apple product to roast it 😂
I was literally waiting for this video
1:23 true AF , "who the hell choose green"
The headband looks like those expensive computer chairs
Why are they calling them airPODS, I thought it was a clever name for the ear buds that fit in the case like a little pod, but this is just dumb lol
I don’t like this yt channel as this artist is so talented but always record this stupid honest video about apple. It’s boring, try something new lol
This guy is biggest hater of apple 😂😂😂
Is it just me or did rob miss the opportunity to start the vid by going to sit on the chair and falling then saying who took the back rest off the chair and having someone off camera say "we had  to put them on the new headphones"
This is Fred
Apple needs to stop making garbage
Love from india ❤️
how has apple not sued this guy for showing the truth ...love your work man👍
I wonder if apple executives watch these videos
Do you just hate apple or something
Tf? 😂 😂 😂 💔
I've been waiting for this
Is that a quarantine cut?
We went from airpods to computer headsets from school 👁👄👁
This is so fucking funny lmao
How could u make millions of videos on a single topic
Who the hell chose green 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 cant Stop!!
I really hope that wasn’t really what the built in mic sounds like 😭😭
These cost more than a fucking xbox
I like the name of the "Who the hell chose green" color
Imagine actually buying these 😂😂
this can't be true😂😭
FINALLY
and I still bought a pair, ik I’m part of the problem
lib right going to buy them rn so as to not hear the poor
“How expensive are they?”  *yes*
Is that the actual mic that you used?
When he said it looks like he is at a shooting range, I can’t unsee it now. It looks exactly like the ones worn at a shooting range to block out noise.
"Apple. Less, for more."   - Rob Jobs, probably.
“ who the hell choose green” I died😂😂😂
Awesome lol..
These are very cheap compared to other high end headphones, which aren’t wireless and require special expensive accessories to even fully enjoy.
rob is robbing apple off their business
You really take the Jobs out of Steve
😂🤣😂🤣fuck I died and I love Apple 🍎
Airpods max plus next
Irony is you still buy it 🤔
Any Indian here
Damn he has 2 mill now I haven’t watched him in like 3 years damn
Anyone else laugh at the video then realise your watching on an iPhone.......
I feel like what people needs to understand is that $600 for a pair of overears is not all that expensive in the world of headphones compared to other ones. If apple was trying to sell in-ears for $600 thats one thing, but for overears it really isn't all that outrageous. (also before I get called an isheep let me just say that I don't have an iphone lol).
He woke up and chose violents
I recommend jus buy beats 😐 so much cheaper and more stylish
You are so good at this lol
Never forget the absolutely amazing quality and cost of the materials
welp fans of apple has dislike this vid
me whenever apple launches any product: Let's check what Rob has made this time...  LIFE'S GOOD MAN😂
they look like walmart headphones you get for like 12 dollars
😂
I really want him to do an official apple product ad one day 😂😂 That would be really dope..
Uhhh but he still bought them 😳
Bruh, this is literally looting ppl, if apple makes all it's part by their own, the material will cost 5 dollars.
Bruh there just wireless headphones but it’s from apple so anyone *WILL* buy it
Air pods big macs 😂 🍔
Apple launched new product.... ROB- got a content 😅
Did u return them after the vid was done😂
Fun Fact- this video is all about apple Roast.   And this guy owns most of them. Damn
i swear apple watches these and are just like 😐
I was literally waiting for this 😂😂😂
the mic got me of guard 💀
Why so true
Didn’t know Jim from the Office is now a YouTube
Did he just buy them ?? To make this video or for you??
The only thing I really want from Airpod Max to be applied on any other headphones is that magnetic ear pads.
*"How expensive are they"* ROB: Yes
“The co-founder of asshole- I... I mean Apple 🤣🤣🤣”
I wanna see him in the Official Apple products commercials 😂😂
Who the hell choose green 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I am thinking to start a channel on the same concept hehehehe
"hello I am the Founder of Assho.. umm Apple"  😂😂😂😂😂😂
1 thing i love on these ACTIVE NOISE CANCELLATION😳
gives me old nigahiga vibes
Apple releases a new product.......  RoB :  aaaaaa it's parody time.                       😂
Apple can make paper and still probably get something
Question: how expensive are they? Answer: yes, they are
Lmfaooo
Every time i see an apple commercial My mind: haha can't wait for Rob 😂
2:02 those are not big macs sir😂
“A nice audible, *crystal clear* sound” 💀
I’m never excited about new apple products, but I’m more exited knowing that there is going to be a great RØB video
Next Video: Every Air Pod Pro Max Pro Commercial
Its funny bc the built in microphone actually sounds exactly like that me and my friends use ours on discord all the time its hilarious 😭
Lol I love it
Who the "hulk" chose green  .
Airpods Max & Ruby im dead 😂
“You can get AirPods Max for the low price of $550” 💀
F u apple 🍎
“ *The most common question we get is how expensive are they and the answer to that is always...yes, they are* .”
Heyyyy
I was waiting for this one 👁👅👁
Lol u had to buy them too they just advertised thru you so messed up lol
2:11 i just couldn't 😭😭..
Those dislike are from apple employees
You can get them for the low price of 560 dollars.
The moment he said asshol*. I felt it
You convinced me! I’m buying them!!!
Seeing this guy’s video, everything from Apple is overpriced and the designing is same like previous models, but still Apple is the highest selling phone, whereas Samsung nowadays is quoting price for its products similar to Apple 😂😂
People: Why do you release so much dumb and useless products? Apple: So RØB can make a good video out of it
Who the hell choose green 😂😂😂😂
Gold.
It doesnt make sence how this makes trillions of yen 💴
They look like the clunky headphones we use to use during computer lab time in elementary school
the case does look like a bra !!
They aren’t even trying anymore 😂 great content my dude
🤡🤣
Finally yey♥🥳
He bought it
The yt auto generated captions could actually pick up what he was saying
Lets be honest, all those dislikes are Apple employees lmaooo
 would be definitely crying in their pillows after watching this.  You nailed it bro🔥...❤️from India
It look like I’m at the shooting range I’m dead 💀💀
"who the hell chose green?"      well, apparently dankpods did
1:26 I can imagine Apple saying but our answer and the real question is and should be “how cheap are they”?
Finially✌🏾🔥
I am commenting this so that when I am 50 years old from today, I will look back and think about how things were in 2020-2021
"It looks like I'm at the shooting range"😂
Apple finna Copyright Claim you one day
You can by this exact same quality headphones for less somewhere else.
4:25 mrwhoestheboss 🙄🙄😂😂
TRENDING!!!! LETS GOO ROB  It still wasn’t worth 600 bucks....
Dude wth I think my brain compensated for the lack of noise cancelation  I am using my pros rn and when he played the noise cancellation sound it felt like it actually happened   Freaky
3:50   the case could never.....LMAO
BAHAHAHAHAGGAGA NOT THE MIC
Bruh You Looks Like Jonas Blue
He said who the hell chose green IM WEAK 😂
When the voice changed I thought my chemistry class started👺
When he switched to noice cancellation I switched with him with my air pods 😂
"How expensive are they?" Yes.
We need more of this
The funny thing is that he actually buys those Apple products
I didn't know these were even real. Omg $550 for headphones. Totally ridiculous.
Would apple make more money if they lowered the price JUST A LITTLE.  I mean so many ppl don't buy them cause it's so expensive.
in Russia it costs like 840 usd :(
How are they even air pods lol
Am I the only one to see him mock MR.Beast in the beginning of his video?
Yes they are 🤣
I will truly die happy if apple hires this guy to do all of their commercials they will sell out I’m telling you
it be cool if they were shaped like the apple logo
The sound of privilege describes the AirPods perfectly
the 395 dislikes are more then likely apple employees 🤣
this video reminds me of nigahiga
gold
359 dislikes are coming from Apple fans
Ahhhhhh I WAS WAITING FOR THIS !!
Okay but that thing has to be the ugliest headphones I have ever seen
He buys every Apple product and makes fun of it Crazy guy
Jajajjaa well!!! Jajajajajaja
Lmao
Man you really deserve more likes you make me happy
lmao is the mic really that bad?
This is hilarious! Also at this time, #33 on trending! Congrats Rob! Also I love the built-in mic part 😂😂 It's so funny how often companies cheap out on the mic, like for real just don't even bother.
This guy is exceptional
Apple be like - we r god
It’s funny how he may not exactly like apple but needs to buy their products in order to make his videos. So apple still wins.

These headphones cost more than my RTX 3070.....
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed .. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.

Funny story; If Apple didn't make another product they would still be profitable. The Key is their compounding interest in their investment accounts.

For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!
I was expecting this one! Who would buy these?!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Now when you're not using the earphones, they're dying. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Sounds like 2 of my Galaxy earbuds.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm like "didn't I just charge these?"  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

_Air Pods Big Macs_
Apple will certainly sue you. Hope that never happens! Hope you keep producing more videos!

I found the funny  "People keep asking us how expensive is it and.. yes, it is"
As an Android person I must ask: how are you able afford Apple product? Like do you really $500+ just laying around for the next iPhone or iMac or airpods?? Does Apple offer paying in monthly payments?? Like what am I missing?? I seen Apple friends who I KNOW can't afford the new iPhone but alas they have it.
The beautiful sound of privilege 😂
you on trending again niceee
When he showed the case he should have put it on his chest and been like see it's nothing like a bra and then he's like 😶😐
i got rob socks
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔴Non-Duality
And most importantly , it is expensive . Apple : Jealous peasants everywhere  Me : Not jealous , disappointed .
Would’ve been funny if they got a real bra and used it as the case 😂
These headphones be costing what iPhones used to cost
Here before a million ticket 🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟🎟

Yup its a Pro Bra that protects the Baby Max in it.
It’s not pro because they’re saving that name to make a more expensive one lmao
if y'all lookin for quality headphones, pls cop the skullcandy venue because they are so much better quality for the fraction of the price up here lol
Bruh the amount of amazing ness in this video is amazing 😂😂😂
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
The AirPods Max and ruby. I’M DEAD
I would not buy these because there’s no off/on button😹😹 the shade here is everything 🔥
Nice.
?
I CRIED when he started using the built in microphone lololol
Hi, I'm job robs
Hi I am mr B
Who the hell chose green 🤣🤣🤣🔥
YASSS  ANOTHER ONE!!
The fact that he has all of the products is hilarious
Tbh, it’s HUGELY Overpriced, you could easily get Bose QC35s or a pair of Beats Studios for over half the price, IMAGINE being STUPID enough to buy these. Ffs
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is true of all apple products. I am glad I prefered to fund my retirement accounts over ever buying any apple products. Ahhh. Retirement. So much better than overpriced crap made in china by children.
They make u look like a helicopter pilot
RIP Beats 2021
AirPods Max are more of a studio headphone or a really high end music listener set of headphones. They have the best sound quality of anything I’ve ever heard hands down, I’d even say they’re better than Sennheisers top of the line products. $550? Yeah they are expensive, but they are Bluetooth, and they don’t need an amp and extra cords. Most professional headphones cost thousands with an amp. I think the price is a smart choice on Apples end. Really high quality build and top of the line noise cancelling. They are metal, and of course metal is heavy, but they make up for it by making the head strap on top, it’s really flexible and super comfortable. I’d give the product a 9/10 if it weren’t for the fact that the aluminum scratches relatively easy and that the band adjustments didn’t have notches. Highly recommended for people who want the best of the best for a cheap price (yes these are cheap compared to high end studio headphones)
Amazing 😂😂
“how expensive are they?” “yes, they are”
So the mic is actually garbage?
Goddam he's beautiful 😍
😹rob doesn’t miss with these apple banter vids
So funny lol
They look ugly
Is the mic really that bad 💀💀
I thought he was lying when he said the price......

The bra strap goes on top of the AirPods Max to turn them off
Customers:So what’s the price?  Apple:So the AirPods Max are 400$    The case is an extra 200$    And the Amazing mic is 50$😱😱    Btw this is the price on Black Friday
Yay

Bravo, Bruv!  Never knew you existed until,l a random youtube click, ago.  Well done.  Not only did you manage to keep my attention.  I even told myself, "Man, I wonder how many other people wish their best friend was half as on point and witty as this lil bass turd?"  ;  )-  Love seeing common sense and the futility of stupidity being on full display.  Really, well done.  Look forward to more of these and you might even get me to subscribe to a channel for the 1st timer, ever!......I still have my doubts.  I'm kidding.  Carry on!
It seriously doesn't make any cents
I was waiting for this from a long time.
U r a goat
ive been waiting so long for this its unhealthy
“It provides support and makes them look way better in my opinion. A case could never do that”😂😂😂
"Founder and CEO of Asshole , I mean Apple" 😭😭😭
Them sh*ts are oogly  & heavy just so they can make them lite next year 🙄  Bose 700 👑✨
Every time you upload l knew it was going to be amazing. 👍💯😂
The quote of the year goes to.....  Rob Jobs  His quote "The Only max thing about this product is the price"
“Who da hell choose green?”😂
Love u bro
Talent ✨✨✨
How did that activate my own noise cancellation?😂😂
Trending👍
Ngl, your sacarsm is on point. You sir are a great actor. 🤣 😆 😂 🤥
liked it before i even watched it
Computer lab 😂
Wtf!  You know some idiots are using our Pua funds on this shit.
lol just buy some BOSE and you will still save some $ and get better quality product
Who the hell chose green 😂 you’re too good!
I didn't buy because it is beats but with a way more price load and I could buy a ps5 and a game with it.
Make another " If android commercials were honest" but where android is actually good and dosent have a notch
I've been waiting for this
Hi I’m rob jobs founder and CEO of eating the Karl’s Jr Bacon cheeseburger
This isn’t funny. Watch Trevor Wallace. Actual comedy.
Hi I’m rob jobs I’m not excited to announce the Karl’s jr bacon cheeseburger
when he said it’s like I’m at the shooting range or at the computer lab 😂😂I died
to help the vid get higher on trending :)
to help the vid in the algorithm :)
man I'm not gonna comment cuz I was like tired to visit many times on rob's channel but ensure wether he uploaded a video or not, you rob jerk finally uploaded a video man, you seem outta practice tho... don't want to make you feel bad but yeh to make you feel bad and then you get constantly on youtube...xd😜 come on rob be consistent and if you reading my comment, plz respond to let me know you get my msg peace from india
Rob: “A nice crystal clear  sound” Everyone else: “wait what”
While these videos are obviously comedy, I actually think they raise a good point about how much control apple has over their pop culture oriented base and how they can basically sell whatever they want at any price and still get people to buy it
I want those max and rubys 🤣
THIS IS SO GOOD!
The airpod maxs looks fucking stupid. You would be better off with Bose headphones or beats pro
First
I bet Rob won’t pin this comment.
Apple : We are proud to announce are new....... RØB   : Let's get to work guys !!
Apple, for what?
here it is everyone... the goats back
I’m surprised Apple hasn’t sued lmaoooo
rob videos are more of a rare luxury than apple making good products
1:07 LMAOOO
Thank you. I was deciding between the AirPods Max and Beats.
waiting for this
Wtf are these
Me listening this with my JBLs
He ain’t lying abt the offer up app tho😭
Luckily, I can go to JBL or steelseries (yes their wireless shit is top tier) for a true wireless experience.
That's the thing, the sound on them is actually much better than other active noise-canceling headphones, it doesn't justify the price, but it is better.
Does he even make money of these cuz those are so damn expensive
Apple iwtf
I wonder what apple thinks about him
Apple Now- Confusing and Expensive
i've been for this for a long time ❤❤
"The brand new design innovative, supportive as s most importantly, expensive."  I'm dead 😂🌋
Apple- Space Grey, Silver  Everyone Else- THAT IS BLACK AND WHITE  wait, i just figured out why, they didn't want it to be racial, i see now
Others : noise cancelling Rob : shuts the voice of the poor  PRIVILEGE....
Finally !!!!😌
I honestly thought the price was a joke and looked it up, it wasn’t.
The funny thing is he actually buys these things
I’ve been waiting 😂
Airpods Mini Macs 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mutes out the poor people. Now that is priceless.
Love it
The AirPods Mask is actually a really good idea!
0:26 because they’re gonna release the AirPods Pro Max later this year for hundreds of dollars more 😂
You were born just to make fun of Apple's products xd
Your so good to make me hate this and I do not like those
The end was just too clean😭✔️
how are headphones more expensive than a ps5 bruh
“Or you can meet up with someone on OfferUp for $680.” So true lol😵😂
He just called me poor for straight 5 minutes and 9 seconds and I am not even mad about it 😂.
How is this not trending?
Who the hell chose green😂😂😂
“I look like I’m at a shooting range” 😭
Always hilarious 🤣
this nigga dont miss
Let’s appreciate that every time apple throws out a new product, rob goes and buy it so he can do this videos 😔✊
Thanks to Apple. Sony now is so cheap😂
Head pods
people: How expensive are they Apple: yes
Bro I’m waiting on that Disney one!!

Are we gonna ignore the fact that he actually bought the air pods max
No way he said "it doesn't make sense. It makes dollars"
Its time you become ROB Cook
They also generate “water” by collecting “condensation” around your ears. Be sure to check on the removable ear cups regularly so the “water” tanks don’t over flow into drivers.
Rob: the people that don’t have AirPods max are the same people that can’t afford it.  Me: I didn’t even know they existed
“And to be honest the only thing max about these is the price”😂😂
Get your “here before this video pops off” tickets^

Try buy a MacBook CHARGER, late 2013 where I live, now that's expensive. I don't get it.
It doesn’t matter what apple puts out it only makes us buy it. Like they can deadass put an apple sticker on a tv and people will buy it.

"it doesnt make any cents, thats because it makes dollars, millions and millions of dollars"  LOL!
Apple is getting closer and closer to a designer brand with every new product 🙃
When you connect two google home speakers and call them airpods max
3:46 had us in the first half ngl
The brand new design is innovative, intuitive, supportive,     And most importantly, expensive🤣🤣
Yes a new one

“And to be honest, the only thing max about these AirPods is the price”😂😂😂
Having them you looked like u are piloting a world war 2 warcraft plan
🔥 video as always man
AirPods Max comes with max prices...
The fact that there’s no giveaway for this one  just shows how expensive it is 🤣
Why would you pay 500 dollars only for a piece of metal...   It's almost worse than Beats...
** me searching up airpods max bc i didnt know there were new headphones **
I'm from india and i personally forward all of his video to my friends who have iPhone
Best commercial since the ‘Simp’ commercial
Hi, I'm Rob Jobs. Founder and CEO of Asshole *Apple
I was thinking about this in morning..... this is the most funniest topic i expectd from u since its release....& have been waiting for it
This guy won't stop until he has destroyed every single bit of respect Apple has
“Doesn’t make any cents, because it make US dollars, millions of dollars” 😂
Person: How expensive are they?   RØB: Yes, they are.
Claim ur here before 1 million likes ticket
King
Love this series !
Apple products are pure psychology! After seeing the price of these Air Pods Maxes, the AirPods Pro look much more less expensive. Think about it. The air pods max is futures with 3D sound and cancellation of sound. These 2 things already existed like 3 years ago. But they are trying to show us in their commercials that they invented it lowkey, which isn’t true. Pure psychology
Aple about to sue his ass😂I love rob
This is the best ahaha haven’t laughed in weeks
I can hear my wallet screaming by using that
yesssss another one  :)
HEADPODS
We’ll we get apple condoms in future cause  I really wanna look rich in bed 💶💸 ps we want full condom not half cutted one !  Thankyou rob jobs❤️
XD

No giveaway?
Seriously?no power button?
I’ve been waiting so long for this video since these were announced 😂
Rob: haha, I'm making fun of these products Apple: haha, your still buying our products bitch
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who else has been waiting for this video
Do the imac next
So basically you are roasting Apple by buying their products 🙄....I know you are definitely gonna use that airpods max and you are also making this video...so I think your roasting is not genuine 🤨
I didn’t even now this product existed until now 😑
From 2:03, what did he say can some one please comment.
too accurate.
These videos are so soothing.   Very innovative.
APPLE 🍎 PRODUCTS CAN NEVER BE AFFORDABLE 😂
This is great
Did RØB just end a video without a giveaway?  This isn't how you're supposed to play the game
lemme get a pair. u wont
4:22 so true and accurate
So now when You're not using your headphones, they're dying 🤣🤣🤞🏼, you're so good at this lolll
My online class teacher:-My network connection is fine, your network connection is bad. Also her:-2:03
The airpods max doesn't make sense, that's because it makes dollars, millions and millions of dollars                                                                                                                                                                    -Rob Jobs 2021

"It doesn't make sense... that's because it makes dollars, millions of dollars" 💀  Edit: it's funny cuz I'm literally just quoting something from the video and people think Apple invented phones.. 😪👌

2:03                 best for hackers to change their voice by talking to someone like in the money heist
The lockdown did a lot to Rob
Haven't tried them myself but they costs like a used car in Sweden. Like almost 800us. And they are complete shit. Lol
Yeah apple products do be terribly overpriced, but these headphones are kinda premium in terms of sound and the design is kinda fancy Idk for me that's one of the products that is actually good for the price
This is some legendary shit🤣🤣🤣🤣

Bruh i was just rewatching the past episodes when this came out 🤣👌
“The beautiful sound of privelage” 😂😂😂
This series is so underrated
The funny thing is that he actually bought them since he wears them on the video.
Or the alternative for cars, planes and trains: Airpods Tracks.
Rob Jobs is definitely an android user
3:50 had us in the first half ngl
Fun fact : He has to buy every single one of the products he is meming about
The cases look like an ass
"Hi I'M ROB JOBS,CEO OF ASSHOLE" True tho
What i expect in every ROB videos like this:   -it's the same sh*t -Airpods MAX V2 LITE PRO  -Invent Airpods designs that doesn't exist
The fact that hes talking smack about em and then u realise he actually had to purchase them to make this video
I mean, I’ve seen the same video.  You guys don’t have to quote it in the comments
headpods
Didn't mentioned the condensating water in it, after some time of using, but overall really good video 😂

Yo, I literally just watched all your videos and you released this. You're awesome.
Steve Jobs rolling over in his grave RN 😂
He is so good. But why did he buy them if he hates them so much.

3:51 “The case could never” 😂😂😂
i know this is really fucking wierd and random but the wierd faces you make (like the one after "it makes millions, and millions of dollars" at the end) are A LOT like my older brother's back when i was a kid.

Hi. I am Rob Jobs, founder and CEO of assho... ahmm.... Apple
"It provides a lot of support and it makes them look way better in my opinion.. The case could never" Lmaoo
Damn
4:50 Oooohhhh!
When I heard the real announcement about new AirPods I was expecting another earbud stem type thing but new for sure that my gen 1s were way to unimpressive and expensive to be willing to even want these AirPods 🤣🤣🤣
Expensive ? *YASS* *RØB* please see this
Can anyone tell me the name of the piano song??

"It provides a lot of support and it makes them look a lot better in my opinion, the case could never" LMAOOO
RØB you should put a beat behind Amanda Gorman's inauguration  poem
ROB: This design make you look like you are at the shooting range Me: Ong 🤣🤣🤣 Bro keep up the work, you are so underrated
Was waiting for this... Since I saw the cost
love it man
Lmao when he started telling about the microphone and the mic just went "AGDBAABHAAHEHEBEBEBD"
“we know you cannot afford these headphones”
Who else gets sad when the video ends 😂
Rob jobs...😂😂😂
Finaly new video
thats one hell of a mic
Customer: "how expensive are they?" Rob: "yes"
That haircut is fire
They bought Dre beats???
"Who the hell choose green" I'mfckkingdead
whats the best usage of these headphones??  No-one : Literally no-one : Me: Giving you privacy watching Porn videos😂
Does apple gives you their products for you to roast? lol
1:40 The Vlog fam understood this pain
that bra/case bit was pretty funny
Apple team be like ....    This is actually Fact
I have Sony’s to show my privilege and they actually have battery life.
i love how he buys every product for this
Let’s all appreciate he puts a lot of money and hard work into this videos
1:12 wow that makes so much sense
I love this but imma stick with skull candy😂
Rob: Roasts the hell outta all his own apple products
Hope apple won't take down these crazy honest Vids for using their logo.
Waiting for very long....
I would want to buy the AirPod Big Macs more than this (lol)🍔🍔
IF THEY SUCK SO MUCH WHY ARE THEY ON YOUR FU*KING HEAD
Was that legit the speakers from the headphones there...because that’s fucking crazy man...
The mic is awesome
U are true to me🔥😜
I thought he was joking about $550. Nope. That is the price
No giveaway this time?
The Fact That He Actually Buys The Product Shows How Much Dedication Went Into This Video😂
Him - complains that AirPods are overpriced Me listening to him in my 2000$ Senhisers
*-who the hell choose green-*
Space Grey  Pink Sky Blue  Whothehellchose Green and Silver.
ROB is so good at this!!!
here before a milli
here before a milli
Aiprpods max are way too overpriced, BUT MY MERCH IS NOT! Lmao😂😂
Me who bought AirPods Pro 1 month ago: Am I poor?
I am honestly shocked that we still have customers.i mean it's doesn't make any sense 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rob doesn’t rlly upload only whenever apple uploads so he can roast the he’ll out of them....
1:11 had me dying!
RØB Is great at acting he needs to be in a film.
Ayoooooo RØB jobs waaasss good😂
Founder and CEO of assho- Apple :)
$550???? For those??? No thanks 😭
That Audio it’s so good
Crazy how Rob Jobs got ROB to buy these stupid products
I didn’t even know about these until this video came out
You did not just buy them 😭
I literally like every one words of the script 😆
i got my airpod maxes at the airport
Who the hell chose green ? 🤣🤣🤣
😂
We:HOW MUCH IS THE PRICE APPLE:Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
at this point just make the ads for em (they will get millions of buyers).
Can you do s21 Samsung 🙏😂
What's the name of the song in the end
Him saying to not buy beats me listing with beats studio3
This not only sounds more personal compared to the other vids but  wireless charging? What
“To be honest the only thing MAX about this thing is the price!”  Me: 😶😐😆😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂
LOLL
So this is why Apple gave free beats headphones with laptops to get rid of them so they can sell their own headphones. This all makes sense now.
i aint payin 500 for a pair of fucking headphones
i bet im the only one here who aint subscribed
0:40 lmao
real question: when he is talking about the mic... is it really how it sounds?
That’s not the actual mic sound I’m crying 😂
The case could never lol
“The beautiful sound of privilege” - I was dying   1:03
take your “here before 1m views” ticket :)
2:04 do the airpods max really sound like that
"The box it comes in is big for no reason"
There are AirPods Pro though?
Bro these videos are so entertaining, I can't take my eyes of them # ViewerRetention
That microphone tho
You looking through the comments have a great day or night
HILARIOUS 🙌🏼 (love the background music)
Too bad Rob Jobs died of Ligma... very sad
Haha me and my friend were talking about your video’s and we were talking about how you should make one of these
mute out the poor people 🤣
NOOOOO only 5 minutes
How expensive are they? yes. they are
is that actually the mic sound lmao
Steve Jobs rn: What have these ppl done 😂😂😂

i love this guy and subbed too
U should be hired by apple
“you can get the AirPods max today for the low price of 550 dollars.” Me: *Oh hey they’re on sale*
I wanna cop those air pods max & ruby Fr fr
Use this as the "Im still going to use my airpods" button
“Mutes out the poor people”. Dude you need to copyright/trademark this because I’m stealing it.
Apple could just put a apple logo and people will still buy it. Then the kids will be like "HaVe YoU  oF tHe NeW IrOcK?"
When i saw them in the carti vid I knew
One of the youtubers that keeps me entertained during this horrible pandemic
I thought you made these up but Airpods Max ACTUALLY exist.
.
1:39 actually that's inaccurate, if you buy them on offer up they're gonna be at least twice the retail price
THE LEGEND UPLOADED
LLS vogs be fire
Mans back

It’s not an AirPod if it is a giant ass headset
These videos are amazing rob 😂😂you are so brilliant
"These could never". LOL
Hi i’m your customer. I have no money. But don’t reduce the price. Reduce the poor.

Next video title " If ROB commercials  were honest " lol.
“So whenever your not using the headphones their dying” 😂😂😂😂
''The only Thing Max about these  AirPods are the prices''   💀💀💀  0:37
Apple watching this : The guy is good, Henchmen watch all of his apple videos and change the price of the airpod max to 5k and make sure they stop working when we release airpod pro max in 2022
One We Get It He Made A Mistke We Make Dollars Million Dollars OKKKK

Tim  is going to make you disappear 👽
Never even knew they made 3rd gen AirPods. Might as well buy beats, cheaper headphones, or raycons
The sound quality part was killing me
Who the hell ordered green 😂😂
Anyone who uses the word privilege is cringe.
It provides support, and in my opinion, makes them look way better... the case could never 🤤
I really like the 'WHO THE HELL CHOSE  GREY' color.
“ Founder and CEO of asshole”🤣😂😂
GUYS LETS GET HIM TRENDING AGAIN!!!
U know how loveliveserve got Noah and Ryan shit u need a sidekick 😂😂 lemme join the ROB gang🤣🤣
even i can afford that, I'm not going to buy those crap..
When your not using them, they’re dying +there’s no wireless charging (innovative)
Only real fans know this was coming
Supportive and most importantly Expensive
The case of the airpods max looks like woman's handbag
You know about beats from mrwhosetheboss

Here before a million views, who else?
“The people who don’t have the AirPod max are the same people who can’t afford it” Smort
Bro so relatable and so funny!!! 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍🙏🙏
Honest commercials are the best content ever :)
"Who the hell choose that green"
Idk why anyone would watch this guy, literally the same content every month for the past 3 years
facts to comedy
😂 I need this
Imagine if Apple actually made cars, how expensive would they be? But, of course you'll still buy it.
another banger
This dude deserve 50 million subscribers
Apple : these have the best noise cancellation  Rob : activates noice cancellation " huh this is working _
I’ve  been waiting for this
Me: How expensive is it? Apple: *YES*
3:39😁

Hi, founder and CEO of assh- I MEAN apple  I’m dead 😂😂😂
RØB JØBS IS BACK TO TAKE YALL MONEY
Who the hell chose green😆
These videos are supposed to make fun of Apple and it seems as though he doesn’t really like their products. But he keeps buying them?

Is no one gunna say anything about the bra joke??? I was laughing so hard!
SO UNDERRATED
Why do I need to spend half of a K for some titanic ass headphones... ITS HEADPHONES TO LISTEN TO AUDIO NOT A PHONE 😤😤😤
He got them
Apple is becoming one of the biggest monopolies the world has ever seen and people aren't realizing it...
why they rectangular tho?🤨🤔😐
Me: Uhhh come on man I just got the Air pods pro   Apple: Well then, you better hurry up because... I'm pretty sure that you don't want to look like you just came straight from the 90's 😏AM I RIGHT...YOU BROKE  ASS B$$$$  Me: uhhh... I mean...  Apple: 😏 That's what I thought!
Robert

“I’ll say it once , and I’ll say it again, WE CAN SELL YOU ANY THING” - Rob Jobs

That mic's coms sounds like the staged Armstrong Apollo 11 moon landing
yes
This is some shit apple would put out back in 2010
Airpods Max and ruby, I literally laughed and my dad thought I was crying
I just noticed that the only way he does these videos is by buying these overly expensive products.😂
“An apple a year makes your money disappear”
"And most importantly expensive"
These videos never get old
The “case” for these is the biggest joke
And finally, the legend has uploaded
I've been WAITING for this
Space grey  Pink Sky Blue "Who the hell chose green😂"
Who tf wanted this shit literally the AirPods were fire but with this shit I might as well buy beats
you never failed us man
I stil have the first generation AirPods 😂
Hmm, usually they will giveaway what they’re presenting at the end of the video. Guess the AirPods Max are too expensive to giveaway lolololol
Those aren’t fucking pods
No one :        RØB: Airpods Max & Ruby
people that don’t have em can’t afford them, no I just don’t wanna pay $600 for headphones
I love how expensive they make these things over the years
And most importantly *expensive*
LLS and ROB are the most creative YouTubers there are no cap
Lololol the Carl’s Jr. opening
Gotta love him
Late again
$600???!!!!! Just got buy beats honestly or just get regular AirPods
Oh God...
rob ur so hot
Dude the coolest thing about them is the head peice
I was waiting for this!!! I lost it at the alternative airpods max choices
Imagine if these commercials get broadcasted on TV
The iPhone X is cheaper than those!
Mannn those ain’t even pods
ROB JOBS !!!!!!
Rob - 'This is product no one really asked for' Apple - call Hitman
I found out these were a thing from Trevor cause I thought it was fake but then I looked it up
I like his hair cut.
U need to call them isheep in one of these videos 😂😂
Whenever your not using the headphones their dying 😂
“I love how the AirPods max conveniently and automatically mutes out the poor people”  -Rob jobs
Bruh, I’m waiting for this for a long time. lmao
rob at 3 am: what are some more ways i can insult this???!?!?
🤣🤣🤣 keep making videos like this, god bless
airpod big macs😂😂😂😂
meanwhile rob likes it and buys it anyway
the AirPods Big Macs 🤣 there were a lot of good ones in this vid
YESSSS I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR ANOTHER ONE OF THESE
RØB: “The only thing max about these AirPods are the price” Literally everybody: You don’t say
LoL, first time I'm early
Everyone loves mocking, buying and even eating Apple
I would not get them even if I did have the money I would get the ps5
Headpods😂😂😂
Hey, I phone 13 is coming soon.. Let's find there g-spot....lol 😆
Whoever dislikes this video are apple fanboys who don't know the value of money over ridiculously designed products. I mean, come on?? Whoever wears that will make you look like the guy at a firing range. duh??
"Apple. We build anything we want. No matter if it's useless or not, you still buy it. Even it is expensive."
facts if only i had airpods
The MW2 mic has me dead   xD
I think rob is actually getting tired of apple
"The only thing max about these AirPods are the price"   Non-rich people: no shit
Does Rob Job answer
On 2:02 he sounded like big q
Apple vs beats      Who wins for the headphones ?
If apple dipped a stinky old sock in shit and put an apple logo on it people would still buy it.
pog
This had me dead 😂
That is so very honest!
air heads max coming soon
Let’s goooo
I knew that Rob's gonna drop a video after the launch of Airpods max by asshole sorry apple🤣
You should check out a review from Not Really Rocket Science.  The “truth” and “if apple were honest” Emerge only because dumb people want things they don’t need. 😏
Only real ones know when he mentioned buying them on the vlog to make this video
check the website in the discription 😂
this a banger
'CEO of asshole'😂
Lol I love you rob
hilarious and true, but imma still buy them 😭
I generally feel offended... damn
"It doesn't make any cents, it makes dollars, millions of them" lmao that is facts
That mic tho is (:
Yes......  ROB will retire solely on Apple products
Halfway through the video i realized rob actually bought the headphones
This was such a funny one i love it
I didn't know that you get a free bra when you buy the Airpods Max. That's a win-win
People: “How expensive is it?”  Apple: “...yes...”.
Apple can sell Apple fruit for 500$ and people will still buy it.
Hahaha badest honest I ever see
Love these videos make me laugh so hard. Keep up the work. Hope 2021 is better
I was the 10,000 like les go
Ngl I hate what Apple did to the beats company
Epic
Here in India the Airpods Max cost more than the IPad Air 4. To be telling the truth they should be of half the price they are now.
How is apple going to sell headphones when you can't even get them in black!?
Who the hell chose green😂 Coz I like green color😂😂😂😂
Here we go again
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Røb jobs 😭🤣🤣
As usually, *Rob Jobs*
Yeah people boutta be buying these everywhere

Aah! the beautiful sound of privilege , gotta love it ..... Like the hell my wallet is gonna love it
“For the low price of $550”, I’m weak
Lol
1:15
Expensive it’s headphones WHAST the difference
Literally every apple product: “Honestly the only thing max about them is the price...”
Wait is this a real thing?
So I guess being rich comes with its flaws
In India it cost 800 dollar (60000 rs)😁
I was waiting for this one.

I disagreed that Apple products are shit but this is shit.
“AirPads”
Basically he just saying that you should get the headphones.
I had a pretty bad day today because I had to get jaw surgery but watching this video made my day
These are actually the best wireless headphones out there....but still, its double the price of the competition....like wtf?
Here before it’s number 1 trending✅✈️👍
There is only 1 thing missing. the alcohol addiction.
You might as just use your mic
you know what they say, an apple a day takes your money away
We didn’t ask for it but we saw it coming
For a sec I thought he turned the noise cancellation on my AirPods Pro
I love these so much
Might need these headphone for the shitty mic
“It looks nothing like a bra”😂😂
Whothehellchosegreen😩

I don't know if Rob is actually offending Apple or is just being sarcastic
lol I made it within 30 mins of the release -- if anybody sees this, feel free to check out me beats! (FYI: I'm not forcing you)
Right now everyone is trolling them like when the air pods came out. But watch in a year when everyone has these. 👀
I have been waiting for this as soon as it came out
Apple at their meetings living in fear that robs gonna upload again
I love ya man you roast apple in simple and cool  way 🤣 Love ya man ❤️
