Have a damn good day
Why replace the landmines with tin cans? Wouldn't that just confuse future clearing efforts?
17:26 Shut up your mouth  What can you do in this situation 😂 It’s easier said than done
The films in Spanish is because it used to belong to the Spaniards...they actually speak Spanish, the majority of them. I have seen it.
"If you just stepped on a landmine in the desert and one wrong step can blow you to pieces, what do you do? "  I'd die.
10:40
OH MY GOODNESS HE COVERED MINE AND I DIDNT KNOW
The dude with the dead kid was so funny omg.
instead of covering your cloths in urine, you can make a moisture trap, you find a cup like object and dig out a hole, you then pee around the cup, place a covering over the hole and put a rock in the center and it will atract some moisture
That is not how mines work. He’s just dead.
How did the kid no where the land mines were????
Mines ain’t working like that first of all as soon as you step on it you’re dead
27:50  Dam, for a person who endured multiple dog attacks, a fucking sandstorm, a explosion which occured nearby, hallucinations, lack of water and food, Several injuries, shell shock, and the crazy temperature of the desert, he surely looks very fresh just a few days later
I dunno why they show fucking people stepping on land mines and it doesn't detonate. IRL, if you step on landmine there is no "oh shit" moment, you step and it goes boom and you legs are missing. If it doesn't immediately go boom it is a dud.
This movie is convoluted...
Falling asleep while being awake forcefully, hallucinating fake thing,being nauseaous and dizzy getting attacked by real things is surreal
That man give really shitty advice though, could have just told him he step on a tin can and not a land mine.
Rip tommy 😞
How to ACTUALLY get away and be safe: hold your boot, slide your leg out well still keeping pressure and fill it up with sand or anything that heavy and leave not taking it off so it won't go off with pressure still on it
27:15 biggest L moment
What does this dude got against marriage bru?😭
I get a 100% chance of getting food when I got to the store try to beat the wild dogs
This is a movie
I was so scared for him at the end I was like man it's just his imagination
Only watching this bc I didn’t finish it with my mom lol.
sorry you had to do so much work censoring blood for YouTube! this is a very good essay and I can really feel the effort you put in explaining the scenarios and alternative solutions and intel/background  information! could've just put all the work into that stuff-- the good stuff! good stuff, thank you!   I watched this movie before watching your essay to avoid spoilers and am really appreciating the level of thought you put into it. I didn't pick up on the fact that he has to stay awake the whole time so he doesn't fall off the mine through whole movie! good catch-- no pun intended!
Can an instant release from boots used be designed when stepped into a mine with the boots itself have underground metal sensor connected to his watch with red signal for example?
So that desert was like chess opening with land mines, can a land mine super sensor from space able to paint an area by GPS contact and mine mapping with  super telescopic lense with 3d imaging used to picture other galaxy?
I was wondering the whole film if the landmine was a dud or something. Thanks as always for a really interesting video!
Backpack+sand=enough weight and keep weapon
Just move your friend's body on that mine
African Wild Dogs are the cutestttttt <3 I love them so much 😭😭😭
The movie: this man is stuck in a “mine” and if he takes one more step he’ll die of the explosion  Me: “takes shoe off”
They had to reach the next village, where they have an extraction point. So they had to take the risk of going through the field. Or they'll end up getting caught or tiredness and thirst.
Trading in a land mine in the desert with a tiking time bomb of a bad marriage.😅
this entire movie feels like it happened because he got Cs in soldier school
put sand in the water bag and place it on the landmine
Those are fucking marines not soldiers!  Edit: it might say they’re soldiers but that’s my uniform and all my fellow marines uniforms!
If he dug around the landmine he would see its a tin can
Did he really drink he's pee
nah but the thing is, will yall remember this when this happens
Ugh. Disgusting.
Bro was mad bc he stayed all night on a can
14:45 how do the natives know where the mines are. Wouldn't it be better to remove them than, or at least mark them with a flag?
So if i were him and i heard a click sound and nothing happened i would dig up beside my foot to expose to see if i stepped on mine but if it was not i would wait for the person to come back then would follow him to the village
this guys like" OK FIRST OFF I WOULD HAVE A MAP OF ALL THE LANDMINES AND DODGE THEM ALL" like bro they dont have that info
My mind is telling me to just step off this cuz I watched this movie long time ago😂
Honestly…….it takes too much work to survive this one buddy! I’ll just blow up and join my friend. My estate plan is in order for my loved ones 🪦 .
Just like The Hills Have Eyes, this is the US Military when getting budget cuts.
The real horror would be if they showed everything his girl was up to while he was out there
How w to beat follow the berber and act try ti look at the mine
If you step on a landmine and hear a click, then the landmine has failed to function. Lucky days.
This man love risk first  the Army then marriage, We all know both of those thing lead to death.
i just cant with all these blurs lol dude its a MOVIE it isnt real. Youtube demonitizes you for fake hollywood content??
Bro a tin can I’m so done
imagine standing on a tin can for 50 hours
ngl this is something I'd do tbh
2:32 Get the fuck ouț of here or how în short GTFO   I love this💀👍
umm i9 have a bigger rifle and it wieghts only 5kg
20:14 knowing YouTube’s rules and being a huge fan of How To Beat, I bet the whole screen will be a blur in 8 minutes lol
We need a “how to beat no nut november”
Can we get the fact that the berber actually a truth teller that he said "He had to keep going." Edit: He wasn't lying about the landmine the sniper was standing on is actually a tin can.
On the “not the way mines work point” I’m fairly certain that it’s just dependent on the model of the mine and not in any way uniform
Boy he could have used his back pack after putting his hand on it and putting the backpack on top of it
how I would beat mines is not be a marineinfantry
The sniper's name is Mike. How you watch the whole movie and not know his name
Its a interonational symbol for GET THE FUCK OUT
Imagine being in this situation and you HAVE NOT watched the movie.
When his friend's body ended up next to him, he could shift his friends body over and around his foot.  Then taken off his shoe.  Since we know just his leg is enough weight, a whole torso on a shoe should be enough to offset it.  When he steps off the shoe he could position his friend's body such that the explosion would mostly be absorbed by his friend's body.
God bless y'all
Bro should have just used the force
Small mine burried in sand. You have a med kit. If mines worked this way, why not just tape the mine to your shoe?  Hope this is part of the vid.
5:01 Survival tip: Never be anywhere where this is considered "quite a bit of vegetation". Less than that and you have to start wondering if you are on Arrakis.
thank you for this, Mine is now on my dont bother wasting my time to watch, movie list.
@HowToBeatYT 12:10 they speak arabic or hasani not amazigh
At the end he assumed that position one last time
3:55 not true, ms3 is a pressure release mine
I had a feeling that he was never in danger after he mentioned that landmines doesn't work like that. And when the villager laughed at him and telling him to move on.
The biggest thing these How To Beat videos have taught me is just how many movies rely on nearly identical "I'm stuck in one place" formulas.
bro had god on his side
thats my watch!
There are no mines that work with such a trigger mechanism for a reason. If you were to step on such a mechanism, especially in a sandy environment like this, it would be easy for you, to dig it up and simply take it into your hand. once there, apply duct tape, to hold the mechanism in place an throw it as far as you can. Nah, there's a reason why AP mines detonate directly. And these idiots who made the movie didn't do their homework, cause they thought it would be a cool scenario.
why couldent he just run off the mine during the sndstorm it should give him enough speed.
Imagine going through absolute hell for that long, only to realise you were stood on nothing more than a can of beans
If you just stepped on a landmine in the middle of the desert it doesn't matter what move you make because you'd instantly explode lol
Why didn’t he dig up the mine, and reassess it. You know, like dig a trench on side of it, and get a good look at it!
Alright, that suggestion was stupid. You said the sniper was 6.8 kilos, but remember, he was running from enemys with guns, and what if they find him? They probably know the lay of the land, so surviving if this happens without a gun to fight back would be hard.
imagine a how to beat and dead meat collab
Who sees a sign for mines, and go "Lol probably just a joke, lets walk through the area."
5:53 "turn on the radio!" "Yo a strawberry slushy would be bussin rn"
What a story to tell ur children and grandchildren
Whats the point of replacing it with a can
i was expecting: it was a tin can all along, until the mine went off and obliterated him instantly
Damn, gained lots of knowledge while watching this.
Bro, as soon as i heard “You’re free" i knew exactly what he meant
"haha jokes on you it's a tin can"
27:47 when the boys show up to back you up in your fight
Swearing in your videos (even though it's censored), makes them so much more funnier so PLEASE don't stop
I would ask the local to bring me water every time he would go by, and use fire to scare away the wolfs, also I would use the wood he used to make fire, to make a small tent, more like a shield, and use my jacket , to defend against the desert storm, also I would strip my friend of all clothing and gear to use it, to make shelter.
i would beat it by lifting my leg up
Dude i wonder if this actaully based on a true story if it is lemme know
i learned more survival skills from this one video than i have ever learned in school that should say something.
okay but did the dude get his strawberry slushie in heaven
Talking like a dude who's never experienced extreme heat. You could tip urine over yourself all you like.  But you won't be urinating, because you're dehydrated. You will urinate in drips and squirts at most. And two, the sun will dry that all up in about 5 mins.  I've lived in outback Australia. You can jump in a pool fully clothed, ten minutes later, bone dry.
blud what?? 1. HOW HE SURVIVED BULLETS AND THOSE FREAKIN DOGS HAF HAF  2. bro got a gift from the jesus the jesus wh gave him thhe potion+-++
If i was the dude that help him bring the water idd push him off to scare him
JUNIOR DOUBLE TRIPLE WHOPPER!
This is why you play Minesweeper 24/7
Couldn't he have used his spotter's dead body to make up for his own weight so the landmine won't explode and kill him too?
simple. be the main character.
bro said dogs💀
LMFAO I just watched this movie and the algorithm knew it! Let me guess, you can beat Mine by NOT WALKING THROUGH A MARKED MINEFIELD. Also it's a soup can, he freaked out about nothing. I do have a question though, aren't trained marines able to withstand more than 24 hours without air conditioning because this dude was wigging out after day one.  Hey baby, wanna get married?  Yeah, where at? Oh, at that well about four hours west of that minefield with millions of mines in it...
Im sorry, but PEE? that’s what y’all drink when ur in a situation like this?😭
i wouldnt beat it id die in the first dog attack
Healing potion from Minecraft in real life
bur bur!
Whats this movie called?
That was a damn good story. Only one question: _"This thing beneath my foot... Is it yours or _*_mine?"_*
Why didn’t he just take his foot out of his boot while holding it down and then just put some heavy objects in the boot?
When you step on a landmine, you‘re dead.
It’s full of plot holes and extreme conveniences but it’s honestly such a good movie
That is not how mines work they explode the second u step on them
If i paid to watch such a stupid movie, i'd ask to get my money back lol
I'm binging these videos rn, but I'm only going to watch this one for desert survival points. the premise is so stupid, very much 'because plot'.
He coulda tied his shoelace around the mine using a stick or pen to tighten it down like a tourniquet and walk away
Could you imagine staying hanging on to the rail of the Eiffel Tower for four hours only to fall and realize theirs a safety net. Because I imagine that’s how this guys feeling
movie name?
The spotter is an absolute idiot and deserved that death. He is in a high tense situation in an area they completely do not know. He should take everything seriously.
I wouldve just followed the man, or the little girl, footstep by footstep, i know they wouldnt live in a minefield, so following either to their house would be my goal, then get my raggedy, dry ass home
Does putting a heavy object in his shoe while taking his foot out of the shoe work?
Let's be honest if you are in this situation you would be dead within a day. The only reason you know how to survive is because you watched the damn movie.
Hold up this whole story is messed up bc this soldier is an idiot here’s why  At 11:02 he was hit with a sandstorm but when it ended he was by his dead friend which he was far away from when he first stepped on the mine, so technically he isn’t on the mind anymore and he could have gone home all that time am I right?
Imagine the ending was just an hallucination and he is still on the mine and it is not actually a tin pot its a real mine
What was this channels old name
Thanks, it worked for me!
Signal a local for help but the local takes his sweet time to tell the soldier his standing on a tincan
When the wild dogs attacked The lighting makes it look like absolute darkness when the moon light alone would have been enough to show the dogs
G 3.2mlnw I did to do de rod it 1g 3.8.2 1g 3.2mlnw 83kwlll
This whole movie is based on an inaccuracy:   • Any anti-personnel mine would have exploded the second he stepped on it. • any anti tank mine would not have been set off by a person
Lol
Real mines don't "wait" for you to lift yor foot. Pressure on it and boom, no movie bs
How to beat yours?
If I was in his situation, I would use my knife to move the sand and grab the landmine and use my shoelaces to tie it to the bottom of my foot so that I can continue walking😊 and get help later
minefields dont go of when you step off they go of when you step on
move to the right as the title says.
If i where him i wud have already dig around the mine to know what tipe it is
This is what  I would do, I would die :/
2:49 the sign was in Arabic  so now africans speak arabic defuq and the guards were probably iraqi or sth too
The thing that infuriates me is when a person who is fully capable of helping the main character in a movie just plays with him and speaks in riddles
This movie makes no fucking sense.
I well use my ultra speed run and go to the military base   Who uses their own strength 👇
Great video Sir
Seems like a good comedy movie 😅
Instructions unclear, stepped on a mine repeatedly after emptying my water on a nearby body.
The only time I would ever say a allied sniper deserves it
Fun fact: if those dogs knocked him over they would have torn out his intestines while he was still alive and have the pups eat him alive first
After all that it was just a can
So your telling me that the convoy ain’t Hurd the explosions at the ending when the two mines went off
If you know that ther are mines and you thing you step on one you dont mowe your legs and inspekt whot is under your legs
Man I'm halfway through this movie and I just had to tell someone about the frustration I have with it. This guy in a God damn desert with no hate or sunglasses on, bald head straight up gleaming like bro even has a scarf around his neck and he ain't gonna put it on his head. Even if he survives he's gonna need skin grafts because his dumb ass doesn't know sun safety. Bruuuuhhh
u say all the things to do but the problem is you are fine and have days to think about it but if you were actually there u would not be thinking straight and you would not think these things
They're recon marines not soldiers
“I would have” done this and that “if i was there”. U see the problem ?
Wow, another movie I'm glad I didn't see. Wonder how they pitched a movie like this?
He was not on a mine
As a Moroccan I can confirm that that guy is stupid for not believing the signs and not studying the history of the place and not taking a map hhhhh
"Pause" on the thumbnail
My favorite scene was just when the skull meant “GTFO”
Eh, even if that guy didn’t speak English he could’ve explained what was happening through hand signs
be fr cuz we all know that piss is not cold at al it is warm and the piss is way to smelly to be on my body lol I'm gonna fall dead if I smell it
He could have pulled the dead friends body and changed weight on mine
Wow the end is just wow
The pee trick works brother tho my uncle ones went hunting and a local gave him lions pee he knew what it was used for but was determined to try smth his friend father has pit bulls he pour and run the lions pee over himself he said the dogs instead of barking at him they keep stepping back growling
They should have made the movie more interesting by eliminating the gun he could have very simply slid the knife between his boot and the landmine push all the pressure down with his gun back up a little bit dive towards ground let it go off he might get injured but his legs will be still there could even threw a couple bags on top of it to slow down explosive
Im in EU army. EU has standards for co-operation. All maps have area names/secret codes. Because of coding, we don't say precise location unless its a crime scene, and I need to take pictures, measure left items or footsteps. + We have to report every hour where we are. Even if we lose contact, our friends would check the last location we were at and continue to search for us from there. 52h?! Why so long? If we do not report in 2h, someone would be already sent to check us. + if its an open area - drones, heli and government satellite from space can easily find you. Government doesn't carelessly hand out assault rifles or sniper rifles without strict monitoring. :) + We have a rule in woods to carry 1.5L of water. I drink less than 1L in 12h. In a desert the requirement likely would be higher. IF rescue takes 50+ h, then they would be required to carry enough water to wait for it... or rescue doesn't make sense. xD English is not my first language, sorry for mistakes.
He's a marine genius
23:39 bruh… think about the stress, fatigue and hallucinations. Do you think that he would have thought of all this?
the end confused me, did the berber have two daughters? And also, did his daughter which died replace that mine with a can or was it somone else
27:20 I would be so, so mad if I found out the 'land mine' was a tin can
Ticking time bomb of a bad marriage
Thanks to you I never have to sit through some of these movies.
Imagine right that the landmind wasn’t working n he did all this for waste
Why us the sign in arabic
Now I can’t tell if the first guy exploded because he stepped off the landmine. But the main guy could’ve used his partner as an example. Did the landmine set off after he stepped on or off? And if it was after he stepped on why didn’t his explode. Maybe the shock made him forget how the mine triggered I don’t know
#DUEM
I could beat this movie in less than 5 minutes, when you step on the landmine if it doesn't blow up instantly just tuck and roll away, best case scenario you live, worst? Well that's not your issue anymore now is it
this dude would know how to survive anything
This frustrated the hell outta me. Lmaooooo omg he was there for no reason idk why this makes me so mad 🤣🤣🤣🤣 love your vid’s bro
I would just put my heavy item on the landmine and it won’t explode. So easy W.
28:08 I would beat yours just the way you would beat mine
so many conindiances lol, worst equipment everrrr. Go home ameritards
They're not soldiers...
Burber best character in the movie
Well the main dude took it seriously. It was the other moron that didn't and got himself blown up. At least he didn't kill the main character
I would have been so pissed off that it was just a tin foil can that I would’ve just stepped on a real land mine on purpose
Love how he could've avoided the movies whole plot if he didn't let the criminal go alive just because some woman was beside him. I'd rather traumatize a woman with a sniped head and blood then let some war criminal go lol.
Step 1: Snipe the target  Step 2: Get extracted  Step 3: Profit
I think after his friend died, I would've tried to position his body onto the mine and try to jump off so the pressure stays
Trading his life from a landmine in the desert with a ticking time bomb of marriage 🤣🤣🤣🤣 broooo
Guy future ft go jets by his
Hahah
Bruhhh
You said a son of a bich
Thank you... I've just watched the synopsis of the movie via this video...   I don't need to ever see this movie at all...  Clearly that soldier hadn't seen a single Hollywood war movie, cause he would've known about "clicking" landmines, aren't...  Clearly it didn't go places cause I haven heard this one till now...
Don't drink the pee but use it for everything else instead
if i was on the landmine i would just dig it up and take it with me
1. How the hell does an empty tin can click 2. If the mine didn’t go off right away, it’s not a mine 3. How did he shoot two people dead while being dehydrated, extremely exhausted, and on the bridge of death 4. Don’t they teach soldiers how to disable bombs, grenades, and land mines 5. There’s no actual way in hell anyone would survive this
morocco's mines are located only at the border mainly at south along the great sand wall that was built to keep algerian's militia(polisario) from entry and so far it's working effectively .  : )
You find a sign that says "danger mine field" and see footprints going in a very specific path in a wide open desert yet choose to not follow the footprints? They were both terrible soldiers when it comes to observation
The story is that he died and was a free man to live his dream duh!
He should have placed all his stuff in the backpack and replaced his foot on the mine with his backpack
I found plenty of folks who spoke english out there, but yea knowing some Tamazight is easy to learn also Moroccan Arabic is easy AF, French and Spanish helps too.
I still wouldn't have been retarded enough to face check why the landmine didn't go off. That dude was all around a dummy
16:13 I think I figured this out when the man gave the sniper the radio. The land mine is not active. Because the man and little girl is calmly walking around. "Free himself" is telling him that he can leave without harm. I think.
The scary thing is if you are a marine this can happen
You know what's stupid about 9ne of the methods to get the radio bag when he hooked it on with the tomahawk and he drags the bag across the sand if it dragged across a land mine... KABOOM ☠
Why didn't he move the sand around his foot to check if it was a land mine or a metal object
imagine when he fell over he landed on a mine
How tf u let a wolf uwu you bro 🤨📽️
Just take off your shoe carefully
Not trying to hate or get hated or anything but only true fans remember this guys old YouTube name.
The cure was urine
A specially trained soldier can't feel the difference between a mine and a plastic toy soldier?
Can i low down and get the mine slowly and take out my leg and put my hand on it and walk out with it
This movie should've ended in the first act. Soldiers don't take landmines lightly, they would've taken off in another direction. Also, snipers carry paper maps in case something ever happens to their GPS devices
its a normal day and you're driving your way to work, when suddenly you hear "Okay, this guy has made a huge mistake"
If I were him I would fill my shoe that is on the landmine while holding stuff it with heavy stuff and place the bag with heavy stuff under the shoe to be free and empty the shoe and walk
what i would have done is tie my shoe laces really tight on the land mine and step off quickly
if its a delay mine im running tf out of there
Wild dogs actually got renamed as painted dogs to try and rebrand them as less dangerous to try and make more people willing to help with conservation efforts, like they renamed killer whales orcas
he fired a gun at them and they didn't even flinch?
Anyone else sometimes binge watch these videos and get tired of concluding “be a super genius in all things known to man”
I,don't know how you would know these things in a life threatening situation
Not even 2 minutes in and I'm dipping out of this monstrosity of idiocy. Literally every phone after 2005 has GPS. You don't need military equipment to use tech that was invented and used 50 years ago.
rather be dead then suffering from trying to stay alive on a land mine
Being on a mission is apparently a "Giant mistake" lol
Bruh. HE COULD HAVE LEFT THE ENTIRE TIME?!? It’s like when little kids have to write a story, and at the end, they can’t end it so they say, “It was all just a dream.” So irritating
It's gotten to the point where I've come to watching one of these videos a day in order to gleam some assorted survival tips that I might have missed otherwise - this man gives an amount of basic, but very fundamental pieces of advice to survive.
No u
JUST RUN JUST RUN!!!!!
I don't think there's mines that have to be triggered more than once.
a skull and crossbones is the national symbol to get the fuck out of here🤣
How the hell did that guy live?!
Got some bad news for them about how mines work
26:54  Only if he had the force.
first they dont kill their target, then they damage their equipment, and then they ignore the warning sign.  that's 2 minutes into this video.
given the fact you lived more than 24 hours and didnt bother to check if its a real landmine
He could dig out the land mine to inspect it a bit. He could also tie the landmine around the boot and take the boot off.
Man, dog bites are a bummer.
I'm sorry but, the berber could have saved this dude so much trouble by just pushing the soldier off the can. I mean, you saw the dude was out there for days, so he clearly didn't understand your riddle or whatever.   If you knew he was on a can you could have just bluntly told him, an if he didn't believe you just push him off the can!!
He wouldn't hear a click and have time to lift up his foot. Those are ww2 or post ww2 mines, all were pressure activated on contact or delayed. Also no big audible click. Oh, the video mentions that.
there's no such thing as a sniper or a sniper rifle its just a rifle with a scope on it
the first thing i will do here is walk pass by
You know he can’t lay in on sand with fire he’s on a landmine…
If I make a movie, will you make a how to beat on it?
Could the burglar not have been MORE SPECIFIC. Tf bruh. That man was literally enjoying seeing the soldier suffer
Im just frustrated he didnt dig a littel bit the first time he stood on it, to be sure it is a mine at all, it could have been some random item under the sand that make that noise, and at the end, i was right lol
Solution run until all mines explode
With the dogs he should have used his tomahawk instead of pistol or did he lose the tomahawk? Anyways have a damn good day.
How I would bet the death game just leave the area when I saw the sign
If you knew what these fools go through. You’d see why this shit is no joke. No doubt one determined hard mf could make it through this. Training to just become a sniper is so ass. I can’t read more comments and hear soldier in the video lmao
“How would you beat mine” 😭 it wasn’t even a mine there
Yooo there is a kids learning tube scene 3:29
*Guy picks nose and makes villain angry* How To Beat: Ok this is totally this guy’s fault because…
17:18 man you forgot his leg is stuck on a land mine?
24:12 no shit
Aye aye if I were that soldier the second I my friend was blown next to me I would let my unlive friend sleep on my foot which is on a landmine and carefully take my foot out and the journey is gonna go on
Everyone calling the characters Soldiers  Marines: *Visible disgustion*
I like at the beginning you’re giving us some Africa information what should not
lol- so he just sat here for days bc he lacks knowledge on bombs-
this weak ass soldier needs to meet Patton face to face. he'd get the weakness slapped out of him.
Bro in the thumbnail really needed some chapstick
Colone energy drink or midnight snack😂👀💀
dont mess with iraqis
Solution: Mine is berried under the sand,, so you already have a cone shaped explosion, upward. Use geometry, lower your center of mass by crouching as low as possible, then while keeping weight on the "plate" with the foot already on it, crawl out as far as possible. This protects your vital organs, putting less vital ones like your legs in front, using them as possible meat shield. Then once you're ready to gamble, take a leap forward away from the mine, limiting even more your exposure to the blast.  Just need to look at war videos where people get blown up, they don't die for the most part, they get a leg or two blown off, but are mostly ok. Not to mention you got a radio available nearby. It's a stupid premise.
Rabbits deer n skunks compared to a pack of wild dogs 😑
The first thing I would of done is dig around the land mine to se if I could see anyway of deactivating it and I would have found out within a minute that it was a tin can
Best ending ever
The guy helping him is the only reason he is alive
I think it was a good idea not to snipe the initial target. Their GPS was broken, and they would have gotten into a fire fight with the enemy if they engaged. Which would force them to retreat into the mine field anyway. Say what you want, but Hindsight is always 20/20. You cannot speak factually until youve lived the scenario. Also, the military would never post 2 marines like this with such minimal contact and support. The initial mission would have most likely been carried out via drone strike to begin with. If you have located the enemies coordinates, it is highly negligent to post two soldiers in these conditions. That's how it USED to be done. Not anymore.
Why didn't he just tell him that it wasn't actually a mine?
27:49 on the left is the buldozer from payday 2
Barber the real man 😔✊
good one.. have a damn day
How did the soldier not understand "just be a free guy"? I mean if I'm in that situation, I'll be like "wow ok yolo I guess,"
Would it have worked if the sniper had used his tomahawk rope to slide his friend’s body over, set it on the mine while he was still on it, and then stepped off?
16:15 I just had a thought… like you said, anti-personnel mines are triggered instantly upon contact. So since this mine hasn’t gone off, and since there’s a non-zero chance of a mine malfunctioning (even if it’s a low chance), the Berber keeps telling him to move on because it’s already clear the landmine he’s standing on is a dud- it didn’t go off when he stepped on it, so it’s not going to go off because it’s broken. So the Berber keeps telling him to just fkin walk out already and then keeps showing him the path to take. But the soldier is so afraid of the big scary mine that’ll surely explode if he steps off it, that he’s not understanding the fairly direct message the man is saying to him.  EDIT: yeh I was mostly right 🤣 it wasn’t broken, just wasn’t even a mine at all.
After the sandstorm that blew his friend over, he should just pulled his no longer among the living friend to where his foot is, trade pressure, and leave
There's a book about this
Like if that was me I would just leave as it is just a movie
"Now the problem here is if you're already being attacked by a pack of vicious animals, and you're not covered in your own piss-" there's just something about that line
I wish I was him mike
My favorite video of  his
Imagine watching this while eating
this entire movie would never have been made had the creators only learned how a landmine works
Another thing you could do with the urine is take a piece of cloth, a shirt or something, or a bandana, and pour your urine on that and wrap it around your head. The moisture from it will keep your head cool and ultimately allow you to survive a bit longer.
Man what I would do is dig up the mine and see if it is even a mine
4:35 is that Obama??!?
couldn't he just use his battle buddy body as a sandbag? 2 standard issue body plates and a slab of meat could block enough damage
a marine would never do that. the second mind field is mentioned they'd freeze and walk back their exact steps.
Soldier:''peeing'' Dogs:ewww stinky
A soldier defying orders and refusing to take out a target is just... wow. That's so fucking stupid.
Correction. A 🏴‍☠️☠ is a universal sign for danger. Has been since 1500th century
U have 3.12 seconds to move from the line mind even if you try to run the wip can still take you out
land mine detonates right away when you step on it
What a coincidence that I watched mine today and this video came up
It’s just A prank bro the prank
He could probably also drink the wild dogs blood to hydrate at least a bit
I guess it's just a puppy love
dummy should have taken... the shot. your already killing his or her father how much more moral highground do you want take the shot your already a killer. also clearly wedding arent scared as they are armed to so there local enemy and the us they are ready for. dont at me!
Love how this channel is just a blatant, copy and paste of nerd explains channel, Even using the same opening questions and statements. Without the humour Even the title is the same format of nerd explains channel He even stops and explains each scene just as nerd does, even with the clicking sound
If someone gonna see this could he make sure it mine he can to mine sand around mine
You are not them
Well hey
that's like... Sorry, I was in the navy and I've known scout snipers and I'm already to the point of being unable to suspend my disbelief in the first few seconds lol
I'd try to dig around the mine, given that it's only a few inches deep, to see I could just attach it to my boot with shoe laces or duct tape or something, then use the rifle as a crutch to walk to the nearby village. Or at least that would be the plan if Step 1 didn't immediately reveal that it's just a tin can and I'm not actually in danger.
personally I would just step off of it seeing how its just a tin can.
Jokes on him he could have just continued on it was a toy soldier in a can
so this entire time, he could pin down his shoe with the knife, but couldn't slowly shift his leg off as he dragged his dead friends body on the mine.
It takes me around  2 weeks to finish 500ml bottle of water.   But I do have 1 bottle with me. Right now and you can't imagine how tasty it is drinking it RIGHT NOW 😋
This is one of the most unique ones I saw a recap on, and a how to survive of this was very interesting
wait can he hold the landmine onto his shoe putting pressure on it with his shoe
sodium does not dehydrate you, its the exact opposite, do your research in nutrition
Where's a broom to sweep away sand when you need it?, cs that would've solved all their issues.
I need water.
Pressure Release Mines are unrealistic but would be a great halting tool to evacuate your own platoon. Imagine a scenario where an order was given for an army to abandon an outpost while an enemy platoon is rapidly surrounding it. If they used pressure release instead of instant. They would basically make an inegotiable hostage situation. Their only choice is to sacrifice their comrade to proceed with the mission or to bring in a bomb defusal expert to try to save the single soldier and giving your army more time to get away. It would be an amazing insurgent tool
If all the man needs to do to avoid getting blown up is to not step off the mine. Then why doesn't he use his shoelaces from the makeshift grapping hook or another type of rope to tie the landmine to his shoe ? That will be enough to ensure that his feet doesn't come off the landmine and that way he can tread the ground carefully to find a nearby village where he could wait for a bomb squad to defuse the mine safely when they arrive.
So this movie was about an impressive sniper with bad military training... Now that is a minf duck for us uninformed of military warfare.
I would try some how jump off mine or tin can when there was the man so if it would injure me it would be more hopeful then just accidentaly triggering it falling asleep/ fainting
"Bae i am sorry i thought that it was anti-tank mine not a tin can" "You spend about half of time there dehydrated and you didnt even think of plan to escape the mine"
Ya know, he could have took off his boot and walked far away then used the rope to grab it so that if it was a real mine, it would explode away from him.
He doesn't only know about how to survive but he knows about every animal that exists aswell
Whyyy is the advice helpful people give in these movies so cryptic??
Bad marriage? Am I missing something?
NOOOOOOOO not the last lineee XD
I've would dicover what am i stepping on first by carefully digging the sand
him before 👦  him after 👤
You seem to have some dark feelings about relationships man you need to talk?
I’m watching as I’m typing this but could he not risk it and try sliding his friends body onto it?
Any troop that is properly trained and thinks for 5 seconds after the initial shock and panic knows THIS. That mine goes click instead of boom when you've stepped on it, it is either improperly set or a dud. movie over in 3 minutes after first det. Also that sniper would have gone center mass first clear/guaranteed shot. Dumb movie, 1/10
i just watched this movie with my parents.
15:49.........is...is he on a dud?? Lol this guy seems like he just wants you to start walking....I mean...why not, especially when he gets close. If he's getting so close, not scared, and asking you to just go home, I'd walk out next to homie.
craft
honest question: are there any mines that explode only once you step OFF them? what's the advantage?? *quick google* ya it's nonesense, doesn't exist.
It’s just a prank  The prank :…
I feel like you can only drink pee once before you wouldn’t/shouldn’t drink more of it
And it don’t get cold at night nope still 90 degrees out and still 70 at christmas time
No that’s nothing compared to florida it was 106 a few weeks ago in June lol
As a person who just watched the movie  [SPOILER ALERT]          Its hella dissapointing that he really went through shit and at the end when he digs the "mine" out he just digs out a metal can
that burbur (is that how to spell it?) is a real homie
ah yes my favorite movie Bosnia simulator
imagine this was based on a true story
1. I would have stripped my friends clothes and gear. Cut it all into strips to make a rope, extend it with my own in tact clothes if need be to make a rope to grapple hook the radio. Make the strips thin enough you could probably get 50 to 75ft of rope.   2. Why fire in the dark before pulling out a flashlight? Also what happened to the flashlight later on? Are we to assume it's dead? If so he could cut up one of the dead radio battery packs to power the flashlight in an emergency such as the second dog attack. Most battery packs like that don't go completely dead. The Battery Management System chip shuts them off to avoid damage to the cells.   3. Never drink urine.. there is no way a marine scout sniper doesn't know that. Either poor it on yourself to cool off, or use it in a solar still.   4. Never eat in this type of situation. Yes you get energy out of it, but eating and digestion takes moisture out of you as well.   5. As a desperate measure, he may be able to trick the mine in an Indiana Jones esk way. Cut the top off of the boot leaving only the sole. Wriggle in a sawing motion a bootlace to the point where he "felt" the mine, never taking weight off the foot. Wrap each end of the bootlace around the longest stick like thing you could find and drive them as far as you can into the sand next to your foot keeping it as tight as possible. Staking down the boot sole. Dig the hole for the maneuver and go for it. This is a theoretical, because we all know he wouldn't have even been able to think he felt a mine before he would be hamburger. So I would be trying this the second I found out how long rescue would be. You're dead anyways. No way anyone would last that long.  Still, not a bad movie. I just wish they would have went a bit more into him using what he had to at least try to help himself.
Piss is everything
You really look like Peter Parkers friend
cant he dig the sand to see if it was an actual landmine

His plot armor is stronger than gokus💪🏾
2:30 im desd :)))))))))))))))))
who tf puts landmines in the desert???
I was gonna finish my other video first  but the music caught my adhd lacking  Should’ve had that in the whole video
Have a Damn Good Day
Soldier went through all of that but he was still dumb enough to get married very sad
Should’ve shot the guy it doesn’t matter if he’s getting married or not if he’s a bad guy he’s bad guy
No water in your camelback? Too easy
Fun-Fact: All Pressure activated mines explode the moment you step on them. Its actually a simple process. Once someone or something puts enough pressure or weight onto the mine, it triggeres the mechanism and that triggers the explosive. Mines that only activate once stepped on, and then explode when pressure releases makes no sense and would be complicated to make.
why did i think he stepped on another land mine in the airport at the end😭😭😭
This isn't an actual thing since mines like you said don't work that way, but if they did, couldn't you use your belts and straps to strap the mine really tightly to your boot? thread the cordage between the sole and your foot even, and you could take the boot off? Or some such method
slowly take your foot out your boot while pushing your boot down so it doesn't blow up up then just put heaps of sand in the boot to weigh it down and put heaps of stuff on top then run away with 1 boot
the army issue em i had one in afghan in 2013
mines explode as soon as you step on it.. you can't just stand on it forever. would be pretty stupid to design a mine only explodes after you take your foot off of it since mines only job is to atleast blow your leg off or kill you.. wouldnt make no sense to make it so that you can just keep weight on the mine forever until some engineer comes and disarms it.
my boy got trolled
Can’t find just put a heavy rock or something?
The next day:  Us military: hm cinema is smart let’s force hi to join the army Cinema: pulls out camera Makes video how to successfully escape the us military and does it successfully
One move he definetly should've pulled would've been to bait the dog into coming in close in front of him. Once close enough, shoot the dog and kill it, before using it's body as a way of survival. The body will cool over night being good to protect him from heat in the morning and you could use the knife to collect it's skin as another form of cover from the sun, while using it's blood as a source of water.
The camera man be like     o_o
This soldier is the worst yet best soldier ever
Can you drink you own seamen to say hydrated
Clearly they had no planning in this operation if they don't know that within running distance is a minefield and that they don't know where they are without GPS... No map? Hq doesn't know where the operation is?
"Boys are those gunshots, explosions and dust clouds to our 3 o'clock??"  "Yeeeah, Sarge... seems like it."  "But it's not a flare in blinding sunlight? Am i right?"   "Naaah, Sarge... it ain't a flare."   "Alrighty then! Let's move on! We only drove for like, what? 70 hours? Let's just RTB"   Also i love how "insurgents" lose track of two enemy soldiers in PLAIN FKN DESERT in broad daylight after certainly hearing the first mine explode. Convenient sudden goon deafness/blindness is tight!
Yes yes, but for someone that doesn't speak hamburger, wtf is 104 farenheit?
How to beat every death game and movie: pray your the main character
After he kneeled he sould have tried taking the shoe off and filling it with sand while keeping his hand in it to keep the mine from going off. Now at that time he knows it only needs about a half the weight of his leg at most. Taking it and filling the boot with sand and then placing something on top of that should have been enough weight. Another thing to do would be trying to dig out the mine while keeping his leg on it. Slowly removing the sand would have helped him find the can, or if it was a real land mine it would open up his options to disarm it. Taking a minute to look at it, if he could get his hands under it and use them to keep the pressure against his foot till he could tie it to his shoe, this might not work, I'm not a mine expert. On that though, he should have had ductape in his pack, using that and a bottle he might have been able to fashion a solar still to purified his urine. Taking a hint he should have called those guys back he had a solar charger just a but more time and they could explain how to survive to him better.
This just shows how stupid people are. Even if it was somehow a pressure plated landmine which it wouldn't be as shown by every other landmine that gets set off around him aka his mate that doesn't take his foot off the mine that exploded, even if it was surely you can dig away the sand and reveal if it is or not rather than blindly commit to sitting in the dessert for 60 hours which also is more unrealistic than having a pressure plated landmine. Honestly the writing is so stupid I wish when he discovered it wasn't a landmine and he jumped onto the ground he triggered an actual landmine that blew him to bits.
if i was the guy that found out I was standing on a tincan I would scream I'm an idiot and when someone asks about how i survived the mine fields i would say I'm an idiot and when i go home i would get a tattoo that said idiot on my arms with big letters
Awesome
POV: it’s just an empty can
Why wouldn't he have a flash kill/anti reflection device (ARD) on the end of his scope???
If, after all that, Annabelle Wallis was my girlfriend, I'd rather stay on the mine! 😂
No way those footprints in the beginning would still be there, a little wind and they'd disappear.
Damn that was a good movie never seen it but shit
"How to beat "MINE"" Bro just be a communist and say "OURS"
this movie was good
I love your videos but you say if you were in his shoes you would think of your gear and energy if you were in his shoes you would be suffering from dehydration, sleep deprivation which causes for people not think straight in the moment and in the moment he doesn’t think about bullets or covering him self in pee but you can’t really judge him you make good choices yourself because your not suffering from the heat and haven’t been awake for over 48 hours
Firstly im not doing Jack sh t for my life and I would trust the man he know where everyone of the land mines
If lifting the foot detonated the mine, then what about digging under the sand and carefully tying the mine on the shoe tightly, then removing the shoe and move away.
I would eat the dead wild dogs I know it sounds weird but I would do that to survive
why dont u just switch the bodie for u lol
Savage little girl
imagine it ends like op another hallucination ded
is thare any  movie that was perfect like they did every thing right
Even not knowing much about survival it should have been very obious the mine wasn't active. The dude even told him twice. Like he finds the one guy who speaks English, but doesn't even listen to him. Like even if it were pressure sensitive, if you've ever stepped on a scale you know any movement can shift your weight from that scale, and that guy moved around a lot for someone stuck in place. Even if people did come to help him what would they do? Defuse the bomb?
Being a vet, I get the whole "military logistics are terrible, military tech never works" joke, but this is just excessive man
The fact that the 52 hours and other 17 hours he had to wait for equal 69
i dont even know how his leg was completely still even though there were dogs biting and  even insurgents shooting at him
Moral of the story: fuck Weddings
I love this💖
Anyone know where I can watch this? It used to be on Netflix but it got removed
It's sad but eat the dogs..
Why didn't he use his friends body while it was next to him for weight on the mine??
That guy in the thumbnail need's some chap stick
I bet he felt real dumb after.  He's gonna remember he drank piss each time he drinks lemonade
We’re good come on if you want me to do this Matthew I got a clean them out first yes no no yes whatever I don’t know let me like this or the right way and then he said that he went to her dads grave you’re hurting me you’re very m
ok yeah he survived wohooo yayyy but come the fuck on he stood on a can he thought he was a mine for 52 hours, nearly dying of dehydration and having to fight off soldiers and wild animals that is just so sad
His foot and leg would have fallen asleep long ago
First Question: Why didn't he just.. look at what he was standing on..?
how to beat mine? just walk out of the tin can
Slide the dead dog over his foot and boot then slide foot out the boot
Really said fighting off a pack on wild animals would be the worst option. What else you gonna do say dear dog would you care for a piece of my leg
I’m not that smart but could he leave all of his equipment on the landline and hop off because there’s still enough weight on it for it to not explode
The conclusion I have in mind is what if the man isn't great at speaking English so he gives the soldier a life lesson he learned from a movie 🤣
Why didn’t he just follow the man back to the village
Plot twist: When that guy lay down his knee to the ground he hears a click and then the floor exploded, The end
9:55 "His wifol"
Ahat if he strips from all of his clothes and equipment and make a big pile of stuff to make the land mine not go off
Boi just built different
why couldnt he just dig the sand under his feet to see if it was a landmine
I’m surprised he didn’t eat his friend, having cannibalistic fantasies and all..
Who even invented landmines that's such a stupid unpredictable invention you could die yourself trying to kill others
Lesson learned: always check your surroundings before getting help
Sniper spotters are actually more often the better experienced sniper, since they are much better at picking up movement or seeing enemy camo
This guy hates marriages and families 😂😂😂
El miedo es el asesino de la mente. De hecho, cuando dijiste que el hombre le dijo que se liberara, me di cuenta de que supe que no estaba en una mina activa.
I thought at the end when he takes a knee in front of his wife at the airport *BOOM gotcha bitch*
Bruh why didnt he just shift the wait of his dead friends body He would have been out of that mess
There are some landmines that are triggered by the release of pressure, but they aren't very common.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZospWRNwqg
What movie is this ????
Ok so people who see this ☠️ 🤗
inaccurate, all mines are activated on step, meaning if you step on one, it’ll explode
berber OP
how does he deal with toilet issues
This made me put so much chapstick on damn💀
8:06 me thinking my screen was extremely dirty or broken
I remember watching this movie with my dad when I was 7
I don't mean to brag, but my urine is pretty hydrating
STOP GIVING ME YOUR VIDEO
>read 9 line medevac, they come FAST if you need them to, they also have a QRF for stuff like this >also snipers aren't really groups of two anymore, it's more like four or more people depending on the situation >even BASIC infantry know where they are, they know stuff like GPS breaks, so they keep maps to avoid this exact situation  This guy, is so under qualified it's insulting, but he's a muhreeen so eh where his Crayons Ready to Eat
Easiest way to avoid that was to take out his shoe while holding it with his hand and after taking out his foot he could put something strong enough to hold the shoe so it wouldnt trigger the mine
He could've put his finger down on the trigger and chuck it and duck and roll
Can u stop blurring out the blood and things
This movie has like 70% of fillers, bad movie.
Wild dogs do not have the highest kill rate  It’s actually dragonflies, they supposedly have more than a 90% success rate
How to survive: do your job properly or just jump off the mine
why didnt he just put the dead body on the land mine
HOLY BUNGALADERO THAT [ONE IN A LIFETIME CONSUMER] FROM [THE LAND OF THE SAND] IS A [WORD NOT FRIENDLY FOR CHILD VIEWERS]
Have A great good day sir
I want to give moisturizer and lipbalm to that person on the thumbnail XD
The funny thing is that the Berber was giving him hints that there’s no mine there
Those dogs look very similar to dholes and I can’t tell if they are or aren’t
das just sad that he wasn't even on a mine
That dog got karma ☠️
I bet he felt stupid
Love how he starts every movie with "They just made the biggest mistake in their lives."
ill dig the side of where the mine to see if its a mine or a random abject in the middle of a desert
I'd rather not think about how I'd beat yours, thank you very much
Couldn’t he just put his dead friend over the mine and leave ? , edit : if it was pressure activated
I mean the guy had literally told him to move...
I love how this whole movie wouldn't work because landmines don't wait for you to step off them to explode. They go off when enough weight is put on them, no when it's released
0/10 film. didnt cover head, drank pee, didnt use dead friend body as a counterweight to remove foot. idiot solider, idiot film
the story is basically about a military man he wants to marry his girlfriend but has doubts the mine represents his doubts and inner demons and him freeing himself and walking off that mine represents him moving forward marrying his girlfriend and freeing himself of his problems within
you should do the would you rather movie
So he could barely do 52 then they add what like 9 more hours
That would be one helluva story to tell, but I’d take the tin can part to the fucking grave💀
Lemme just google it for a sec—yeah just like I expected.
Imagine if the wife cheated on him while he was gone
Maybe the friend is not a helusination the ghost is helping him to safety
I would be so angry that he didn't tell me that it wasn't a mina
That mine thing isn't true, certain types of mines do need the weight to be lifted off
"Fighting off a pack of wild animals was the worst thing he could do" what should he have done let them eat him
I love this channels energy.
like videos man its like free movie to watch
A ☠️is the international symbol to "GET TF OUTTA HERE" 🤣🤣🤣
wouldn't it be smart if he just put his friend's corpse over the ''mine''? Im pretty sure a grown man is heavy enaugh for it not to blow up.
What I would try is bait one of the wild dogs to charge me, and then try to catch it with both my hands. Then hold it in front of my chest and basically try and use the dogs body as a meat shield.
this ☠ is the internation sign of GET THE FU*K OUT OF THIER
I agree to get out of their as soon as possible
This movie literally has 'but wait, there's more' vibes. Like the opposite of a Deus Ex Machina moment. I'm a bought to defuse this bomb, but wait I don't have my bag. So then I'll use my watch parts, but wait I left it in the hotel. So maybe I'll call for help, but wait my phone is out of battery. That's this movie. It's cool but... Eh
This movie legit made me cry
Any weapons-enthusiast can feel free to correct me, but as I recall, the kinds of mines that detonate once the pressure is released were used during the World Wars, specifically to maim soldiers on foot. So they existed at one point, at least.  Still, it's a movie trope that I really wish would just go away, because if a Scandinavian can point out that a military-grade explosive is inaccurate, then you really missed the mark.
As a south African,  I'm like 100% sure those dogs won't try to eat you, cause you have like no meat for them to eat and humans are not on their menu,  it's too much energy for almost no food.
I hate to say it, but would it be possible to have dragged his dead friend onto the land mine in order to step off of it?
Bro thats the biggest plot twist ive seen in a while
Please have a a damn good day
bruh
MY YOUTUBE CLOSED AS YOU SAID THE CONNECTION CUTS OFF, What a awesome coincodence!
Stupid idea but a idea what if he used his shoelace to tie the mine to his foot so he doesn't release pressure from the mine and will give him more options
Could he not have moved the dead soldier onto the mine?
You can buy kill flashes for scopes
I feel like you SHOULD NOT put a bag as protection because if the bag has the radio and it bites or eats the radio, you're fucking screwed.
This was the most anxiety inducing video you have done so far bro...glad to see my man's make it out alive
cant you just put something heavy on your foot then pull your foot away the heavy object would keep it from exploding and if it does explode, the object would probably shield him
If only they had actual trainings
i would beat it by walking off it bro
only in movies will either a scout sniper or spotter not take a fucking mine warning seriously 💀
The barbet said that some mines are replaced with tin cans so i would inspect the mine under the leg and see
Ooooooooooooh, I can't wait to show this video to my retired military dad!
That last line was savage
"Looks like some lame just stepped on a land mine" - Shotgun
This entire movie hinges on the simple fact that this dude, who trained in the military for all the needed time, decided "nah, not gonna shoot during a wedding". Even though he'd definitely know why he's there, in the desert. He'd have been briefed on why the target will be here.
To be honest I would have found out it was a tin can after I heard 52 hours
Who goes to get married in the middle of a mine field?  🤨
Dude is a damn scientist
The local guy was not nice!!! 😡
he could've dug around the landmine to inspect it, therefore he would've found it was fake. And even if it turned out to be real, and in some miracle hasn't detonated, he could slide his foot a bit off the trigger and put finger on it to hold it down. from there at the very least he could move around. From there all he has to do is either open the mine of and disarm it, or slide his gear on it to hold the trigger down, then he can get away and purposely trigger the mine from a distance for safety using his rifle.
"With the ticking time bomb of a bad marriage"
I've never served in any millitary but to my knowledge the "we don't know where we are" reason for not being able to call in evac is unlikely. Snipers are a specially trained unit among their skill set, strong land nav skills are a given. Even if they didn't know their *exact* location they would have been able to move to a landmark and get evac there.  TLDR: Snipers are really good at land nav and would know where they are GPS or not.
he looks like nate
Most land mines have a seperate fuse set for 15 minutes
Well if the guy never caught the soldier when he was falling over, he would’ve been better off
Hey i have Something to say i Could Survive Without water for 2 or 1 day this is not a lie Sometimes I Dont Drink Water For 24 Hours
"Trading the landmine for the ticking time bomb of a bad marriage."  Lol, that's some Terminal Lance shit right there.
Ima be honest I woukd been choose death and been hella mad that it didnt blow up and my homie just died for no reason mad pressed
I started dying laughing at the soldier 🤣 😂
Honestly who would go to the movies to watch this its more of a at-home movie.
Good urine info
Whatever mien animation your using seems to have atlas soldiers from advanced warfare as the soldier stepping on the mine.
The ending to the movie where he wasn't even standing on a mine in the first place is very unexpected
3:30 So the entire movie is based on a myth (Landmines don't explode if you don't lift your foot up from the detonator -> the timer is active as soon as stepped on) and they got the first mentioned "fact" wrong ... off to a good start xD
Dumb when u step on a mine it instantly blow up
ten mins into the vid he says rifle like why-full
your a horror movie youtuber and you blurr blood  but keep going I'm subed and notes on your the best

I'm laughing bee I actually came across a mine field before
But the locals could’ve “been like you not on a mine dummy”
The sad thing is I'm probably gonna forget this whole video 😭
The burbur is amazing
Maybe I’m overthinking this, but do 22:16 and 23:01 not contradict each other?
Why do you have to end it like this?😂😂😂
what kind of military man  firstly leaves the scope up to reflect the sun and secondly makes fun of a landmine field  , even if you dont think is real just being active in war youd be mindfull of everyting
I see you gained some weight
Brooo what a fucking cool movie wtf

if i knew that the mine is just a can i would rather just step to a real mine and die, cuz why not i suffer too much already
In real a mine explode if you step on in Not of
Bro could’ve just said “ayo you’re actually just standing on a tin can” and this whole movie would’ve been shorter
Damn imagine that. Dude was a a ton can the whole time
Famous last words: This person is making a huge mistake
If I step on  a mine first I will dig up the mine with my foot still on it and then I will use my shoe laces to tie my shoe on to the mine then carefully slide my foot out my shoe
fun fact: this is from egypt because that metal sign that says warning land mine or idk. has the language of egypt
Hmm he step out off land mine to step on another more danger “land mine” called mariage :D I would rather prefer that first one :D
I woud dig sand around mine first, then catch 1-2 wild dogs and put them under that land mine and step out. Or before drag my dying friend and then jump off.
My guy says that 40 Celsius is a lot but it's the normal temperature in greece summers
I saw this movie with my brother in law who swore it was a good movie during our first watch even when it ended and I still disagree with him lmao
13:36 my friend is that from dune? I don’t remember that shot where’d you find it?
“If you just step on a land mine, IN the middle of the desert!” Congratulations your fucking dead.😁
Why didnt he use the dog as a human shield
In the end they wasn't wrong about how mines works  He was just dumb enough to not realize it
Why you blur so much stuff
IQ-180
I'm just saying that if he actually hallucinate and didn't see the man's daughter how did he get he's bottle filled, who brought it back to him? Was he constantly dehydrated or am I missing something?
Better yet: the man stuck his knife into the sand to check out the mine. Could he not of just dug around the area to expose as much of the "mine" as possible, and see it was a fake?
hey um cinema you forgot to mention that blood is just a little less than 80% water so he could of fixed the dehydration by drinking the dogs blood
Perfect ad placement, didnt feel like an interruption
I THOUGHT THE SAME THING, I wouldve done that first I was thinking "hmm does he still have the sign?"
No-one is talking about the ticking time bomb of a bad marriage.
Can't you just check the landmine
Watched this on the toilet 100% recommended
I actually have that same watch model. The timer mode does not go up pass 24 hours so oops
Mine - craft you beat it by going the end and killing the dragon
27:47 I can't look at this and not hear “Alright I'm here! Who wants to die!”
Love how u spot their damn mistakes 😏
Minesweeper:
What a drama queen. Back in my day, when I was a sniper, we just stepped on mines and it was over, quick as that. Kids these days.
Wow
for the water why not just back wash the water
They're Marines, not Soldiers. Army = Soldier Air Force = Airman Marines = Marine Navy = Sailor  Coast Guard = Coastguardsman
Id say to my partner: if one of us blows up first then the winner can use the losers money to buy robux.
He Stepped On Tin Can
I’ve seen this before but you explained much better
SO THAT WAS A TIN CAN THAT WAS A BIG PLOT TWIST
You have the best advice indeed to do that with your ideas are the best advice indeed good luck
Why u gotta go all scientific on us bru i jus wanted to watch the movie
Ig press ur shoe and remove it so the mite cannot go of then keep a heavi substance on it and run
I would have used my dead partner as a meat shield. Not very heroic, and I'd probably be looked down on. But that's why I'm not in the military. I don't do hero.
They're not called wild dogs anymore, they're call painted dogs now . . . Conservationist changed it in an effort to save the species.
15:23 Fnaf 4 be like:
Would've got some chapstick for them crusty lips
Wait how is he alive if you can only survive with no sleep for One day until the next day
NA HE STEPED ON A TIN CAN
at the end his lips looks chapped as hell
am i stupid or is he smart or this is common sense. HE KNOWS BASICALLY EVERYTHING your so smart have a good day.
You have no idea how pissed at the world I’d be if it turns out the land mine I spent over 52 hours on trying desperately to survive was a fucking tin can. XD I’d be so god damn pissed, but also relieved since I’d survive now, but still.
Oh he was shitting his self on just a can lol
The face in the thumbnail scared me soooo much because it looked soooo creepy
23:01 LOL
I would replace the mine with a bottle of water 💧
why did the one man not just say "yeah no you are on a tin can it's safe to move your foot off it" instead he gave him hints that it was safe?
bro is wearing army armor the dogs should not have peirced it
Romans 10:9-10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved."
Not a marine. Also, love your videos, but this is such a ridiculous movie I can’t get on board.
My guy in the thumbnail REALLY needs some chapstick
Dude this is the movie business  there not going to pick up facts like that
could he have not just dragged his friends dead body over his foot as replacment weight?
I haven't watched that yet but, that made me cry-
When will directors/editors realize NOBODY LIKES LOOKING AT CRUSTY FUCKING LIPS.
The bit about the other guy disregarding land mines is so unrealistic
take off your boot, still applying pressure to the mine so it doesn’t explode, once boot is off, still applying pressure fill it with sand till it’s heavy enough to where you don’t have to hold it down, boom easy escape
I know they are not soldiers, they are Marines…Huge difference
why’d he save him from falling then if he wouldn’t explode
I would last about 1 minute
armie hammer <3
2:47 ayy the youtuber juniper
Just take off your shoe hold it down put something and fucking runnnnnn
Actually that is not mine the civilians take them out to sell them
sex
Why is there noone saying that the man could have used the friends dead body as a meat shield to escape at the beginning when the body was right next to him. He's already dead so why not use it.
Yes yes. Rationing water is often a bad mistake. It's very common that people are found dead with plenty of water... yeah. Never ration tour water. Drink it when you feel you need it. Don't stretch it
Bruh...their Marines not soldiers 🤦🏼
Hmm idk throw rocks in front of u
Honestly? I would have just stepped out of the mine. If it explodes, so be it.
simple gamble my life
The thing is, when you step ON a land mine, it is triggered, NOT when step OFF one. He should have known that, he’s a marine. Obviously the mine wasn’t actually a mine because it didn’t explode. Am I wrong?
Phew, I thought he was gonna cut his foot off with that knife 😅😯😝
HOW EOULD YOU BEAT MINE??
The following is a review of this film which I have copypasted from google (still better writing than the actual movie script):  it was an amazing movie it deserves 5/5 stars. I liked the topic and how it played out, I loved the parts on how he survived the ongoing threats from IED's and animals the environment and other people who tried to shoot at him but he shot back and fought them an killed them, and also there are people who probably have gone through stuff like this as well maybe not exactly like this but most likely watched their friend die from an IED then they themselves step on one and have to survive for a long/short time to be saved. sorry for the long review people xD but I wanted to show how much I loved this movie and how this stuff can happen to people.
They are Marines not soldiers.
Two American soldier just wandering around on their own lol
Just rename the video to "how to survive after standing on a mine in the middle of nowhere"
You could do this by going to Bosnia.
This was probably the least professional sniper team I have ever seen. If this was a HIV then I would likely send 3 teams, and if there is any chance and I mean ANY CHANCE that there could be mines then they should acknowledge it and ensure they make the correct moves, instead of what the spotter did like a buffoon. Bear in mind these men are trained to act properly in these situations with an emphasis on the fact that one slip up means death in most cases.  Another nitpick I am making is the starting part as there is little acknowledgement of wind direction or range finding, and he just aims right at the target, if the sniper took the shot he would miss because he didn’t factor in these things. I’d give the distance 75-100 meters however I’m no expert as I’m not a operator of a sniper rifle. With the elevation he wouldn’t have to worry about distance perhaps, but that doesn’t change the wind factor. Again this is why you would send at least 3 teams, to ensure the target is taken out, along with a support team should the worst happen and they are spotted. So this situation never should have happened in the first place really.
Bro was seeing his dead best friend and his gfs house in mirages, so idk how he sniped 2 enemies through a sand wall
I watched the movie it was kinda cool
Yeah because she because
I'll be blown up in the next 30 seconds
THAT ENDING THOUGH.
Is this on Netflix
Has anyone seen FLASHPOINT?
Ahem MINE, BOYS, MINE EVERY MOUNTAIN AND DIG, BOYS-
Cant you just take off your shoe??
this is just "made up problems the movie" literally nothing of what happened is actually real, he just made his own problems the land mine didnt explode not because its some movie magical land mine, but because its just not real the radio guy and the local were just fucking with him like "oh so you stepped on one and you dont want to lift your foot up? oh yeah yeah, true, look you just need to use this epic strategy oops! radio closed!" man was definitely fired from the military after such braindead decisions
*steps on a mime*   *sigh*   *pulls out phone and puts on cinema summary*
He doesn't know it's a can
Burbur: be free   Sniper: nah there's a landmine      Landmine was tin can all along
Peeing in a bottle pouring it on top of you wouldn’t that attract animals
why is dude acting like there’s no such thing as a pressure plate mine😂😂
He should have dug up the sand to check the mine
i watch all of your new videos
The locals probably hate Americans soldiers in real life  This movie had a lot of inaccuracies so it wouldn’t surprise me if the friendly Berber was false too
"with the ticking time bomb of a bad marriage.." 😂🤣 💀
the end killed me good one, lmfao 😂😂😂
The confused look on his face after seeing he survived is like me seeing i survived my mother after showing her my c- report card lol
Ah yes lieing in my pee.the best strat
Last man to take his foot off his mine wins his right to live
If the dogs knock you over, you set off the mine and boom, no more wild dogs, and you don't have to sit in the hot desert anymore
ngl this is one of the worst videos i have ever watched
Why does anyone go there for a wedding
He can probably speak Arabic because he can read the sign. the guy speaks English for the sake of the movie
the sign said (Danger!! Landmines!)
You shouldve just said kill the target and gtfo
Before the dogs dragged his friend off.  He could have used the tomahawk to drag his friend over the mine.  Yeah that's horrible to do to his friend. But the dogs ate him anyway
man i   love  ur        vids😁  have a   blessed  week
I'd step off
The burber: you got pranked
27:57 Holy shit Cinema Summary! The man survives all that and you just murder him at the end with that line! Damn.
Hello
I would have tried to wiggle the shoe string under the landmine and then under my boot to try to tie the trigger plate down
Nah bros that stupid
Step one: confirm its a mine
Just dig
cinema summary back then: *why you shouldnt beat* cinema summary now: *how to beat*
But imagine when the solder kneed to his girlfriend, he is still on the mine and all of the rescue was just his imagination
I know what I'm about to say is cruel or heartless but just use the tomahawk to pull in you friend body and slowly swap drop my waight to the dead corpse waight
You doing a really great job on your channel. If I was you I would employ P R O M O S M!!!
the entire time I thought that there was no mine until the hallucination of him getting off it
Easy, step of it
I would have gotten Myself mad by doing something to reduce pain and then lift the back of my foot slowly and if nothing pushes up i will quickly release my foot
You use KG  for weight  bur Fahrenheit for temp?? Okay 👌 constancy is great
I'd be very pissed if I was a spotter for that dude. Put your damn emotions to the side and just take the shot so we can get back to base. That was a bullshit call
The Local speaks English, with no working animal with him and no bottle of water...because he is an NPC.
DID I SEE MY COUNTRY MY COUNTRY IS LÉGITIME MOROCCO
if i were the guy i would stay calm and would say to the other guy listen to me its a bad idea and none of it would happen
I know how to speak Arabic
He uses way too many factsssssss
Marine corps scout snipers *
Step 1: Get better at minesweeper
how to watch a movie for free with realistic commentary
Solution: loosen his boot that is on the mine. Put his hand down in it to keep pressure while he pulls his foot out of it. Then put heavy things in the boot or on it to keep pressure then walk away.
He could’ve also tried replacing his foot with his friend’s body
I thought once you step it exploads not step and u can just step it forever
The entire movie hinges on the glair from the scope... this would never happen as you place pantihose over the front element held in place with zip tie or rubber band. There also end caps that do the same... hide any potential glair.
He almost died out of thirst and wild animals just to figure out he was standing on a can, i would've relieved yet frustrated.
Cinema Summary we all know this is just an ad for pouring pee on yourself
I know the way to beat mine just don’t join the army
Shout out to the edgy Sahrawi couple that wanted to get married in the middle of a landmine field
is it possile if he can take his shoe off and other stuff on his shoe without setting off the landline?
I always have tape with me, I'll put tape around my shoe and the mine and continue to walk.
okay but why did the man replace the mines and not just take them away?
he never tried to... move a bit of the sand away to see the "mine"?
Pee is just stuff that your body can’t digest
They should make a backrooms film and you should commentate it!
This guys voice has changed so much
the only thing i got from this was that he was stupid to not just dig up the metal thing he had been stepping on to check if it was real like a diamond or fake as a gold digger's love oh well he almost lost a battle to a tin can but he still survived so i dont know what to call me weak or strong
another reason to not drink ur pee it contains alot of the waste you eat&drink
That guy that went 290km from the start line looks like bear grills no doubt
Is Mike's actor Armie Hammer?
now im knowledgable
When his buddy's body wound up next to him after the sand storm he could have tried to position his dead body directly beneath his and then quickly taken his foot off the mine and letting the body absorb the explosion. When his friend stepped directly on one it only mangled his legs so they arent incredibly powerful so this should allow him to only take minimal damage.
27:56 Lol
I honestly don’t know why the villager didn’t just tell him that the mine wasn’t active, but I guess movies must have their characters speak in riddles despite that being completely unrealistic in the real world…  Seriously, if someone is willing to help you they’d do the best way
I feel that we are at school right now
He could have layed his friend on the mine?
Seagulls from finding Nemo"MINE,MINE,.........MINE,...MINE,.........MINE,MINE,MINE,MINE,MINE,MINE,MINE,MINE,MINE,MINE,MINE,"!!!!!!(for once there being helpful)
When he said it took over 10kg he had his friends body so couldn’t he use that
Love your endusiasm
I would scream on the top of my lungs and my lungs and say I spent that 4 days standing here for nothing It's a god d### can
who goes to a place, being aware of the fact there’s a ton of land mines and other possible threats - without barely any knowledge about land mines or the other possible threats 😭
🙄 Horse donkey 🙄 wolf dog 🙄 cat tiger Jaguar 🙄 moon sun 🙄 camel Lizard 🙄 green yellow 🙄
How people think Iraq is:
Bruh my guy he killed mr best world record
How would I beat "mine"? do your mission even if it involves the enemy's love, and don't be a f***ing idiot thinking "danger" means "to be ignored"
Mike is a lucky son of a b@-ch got me so bad lol
“If I was in that situation” I’m telling you straight up there is no way you’d do better than him
Like there are literal cases where people have been found dead with plenty of water, so DO NOT RATION WATER
Ok I know what u mean but don’t ration water dude
this dude literally spent days in the desert thinking he is on a landmine but the thing he stepping on is just a can
Mines don’t click or go off after you step off almost all ap mines detonate as soon as enough pressure is applied to activate the trigger. The only mines that wait to go off bounce
imagine the ptsd when he proposed 💀💀💀
a real soldier would never "not" take that perfect shot because of a wedding. lol so stupid
I know all of it
I would drink my Saliva
Character: does literally anything Cinema Summary: *OKAY*
If the higher ups know where the target is going to be, shouldn't they also know where their men are stationed? How else would they have been able to plan the mission?
Escaped one mine field to only enter into another, lol.
It’s very easy to beat u seemly get up and walk to the village lol
“Ranting about wanting a strawberry slushie.”  I’m probably going to hell for this but I’m sorry, that shit was funny 😆. God help me.
I had no ideas lips could be so chapped
His lips made me 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Oh
Why didn't he gig the mine out of the sand keeping weight on it moving his friends body onto it keeping weight on it with the rifle when slide away
I didn’t know that ned from spider man did the narrative 😂😂😂😂
I like the other voice
Put pressure on the shoe and remove your foot from the shoe and put sand or anything heavy on the shoe.....
dont read my username
The camera man is secrwtly giving him water for 50 hours shhhh
I thought he will be dead
The wholetime when he was on the landmine i was always thinking: *dude, jump back with the foot that isn't on the mine, you won't die*
I have that toy soldier
Solution to everything in this movie: *PEE*
If only he followed orders.
So is anyone gonna question why they had a wedding in a land mine?
Loved how you debunk most movie tropes... I am the one who still believe that kind of landmine existed until u debunk it lol
Bruh, where is the scouts discipline to follow orders.  As a soldier you have bearing and discipline if not then fack off.
Well it wasn't a mine it was a Can so it would not blow up
I,m 9
You must be an expert.
as if we dont already have enough movies about a damn POC minor character helping the white male lead yawnnnnn
Here how to survive a land mine go back if your  Heard it run back fastest as you can this why you should listen to the sign
As my father being a navy seal deployed in Afghanistan, I know for sure that there are weighted mines. Not instantaneous or delayed mines, weighted mines. You need to research more bro..
Seems like that dude coud've saved everyone a lot of pain and time if he'd just pushed the sniper over.
This video is to let maneee😉😉
so you say that if he had poured pee on himself that he would have frozen at night but then say that it was his mistake when he hadnt done that when the dogs attacked him at night .....................
Yooooo morroco
reality JUST PRAY that its a can
Dude you dont even have to watch the movie youl watch it by this guy
Love how if there will be aliens this dude will know evrything after he just saw alien. (What i mean he gets info on internet if he was is this type situation he will die)
I was confused cause the girl knows that she can't communicate with the soldier so thats why she used toy soldiers mimicking the soldier if he took a step i would probably mad but i dont care anymore
You can dig hole onder the mine  And jump to left or right
Great video great quality 10/10
https://youtu.be/xTEWPvqvg24
Not even gonna be there so I’m safe
Bru I was expecting there to be a second twist and it turns out when he was kneeling to propose he was actually still in the desert
The man’s lips in the thumbnail is the most uncomfortable thing I’ve ever seen
I was losing brain cells throughout this whole video your commentary was a pain to hear
The main character that he stept on a mine you think it's a mine but it's just a can with a toy on it
Ok
guess ill start bringing jars when i go to the sahara :troll:
I’d simple just jump away. I’m built different
"TODAY I WILL STAY ON TOP AN LAND MINE FOR 50 HOURS"
I think this guy has a golden shower fetish
i would cry my ass off if i would've realised it wasnt a land mine, luckily, i never go to another country lmao
Jesus loves u and died on the cross for our sins and he is our lord and savior...
The thumbnail is literally my lips in a nutshell
he only survived of plot armor and plot armor only
Wow, this is just wow
He is just saying what they shouldn’t do but they have no choice they are actors that do this and the persons who make this fault not their
14:20 i love when you swear like that it makes sentances 10 times funnier
TBH i would simply walk away
Poor guy 😂🤣
Always listen to the person people call paranoid. They are very often correct.
Those are marines not soldiers
If you just stepped on a landmine in the desert and one wrong step can blow you to pieces, what do you do?  Me: Let it go off
Girl leaving Canny:leaving him to die UNCANNY
OKAY
I was in military too and we watch this movie with our drill sergeant and he was f....ng disappointed and he gave us 4 rules if this thing happened to us.  1st rule: don't be dumb  2nd rule: remember your training as a soldier 3rd rule: dig it to make sure it was a land mine or just a dog poop  4th: remember the 1st rule
Army soldier: I have trained my entire life to survive at any condition.... Cinema summary and nerd explains: pffft amateurs  😏😏
If I was in this situation, and it was a real mine, I would honestly be like "Eh, frick it, ima die sometime anyway," and just take the step.
Man:      *b    r    e    a    t    h    s*              Cinema Summary: Okay this was a completely wrong move, you could swallow poison particles from the air and die in 2 weeks due to poison here's what I would do: I would cancel my oxygen and become a cyborg so I don't need to rely on air. So if we just become a living robot we could actually survive.
Why tf are you all complaining about the realism? If any of the shit was real we wouldn’t have a movie at all.
Ngl all of he could have done was walk in the trial the local walked in and he would have made his way back
Given the title i'm surprised this doesn't take place in bosnia.
Plot Twist: She’s 2 months pregnant.
How to beat mine step 1 : don't join the army                the end
I would just step off after 30 mins
I’d prolly give up then realise it’s not a real mine
Wifes Pov: Yeah I cheated lol   Soldiers Pov:
I bet the animals were just hilousinations because of how dehydrated he is, the animals would most likely not be in this setting, also dehydration causes mirages
Protip: don't be a mouth breather
I would have just stepped off it because I see death as a new life
☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
him finding the berber sounds like being lucky but seeing how was the one replacing the mines with cans so that he probably know that it was not a landmine (otherwise he wouldn´t insist that much "just go") but didn´t tell him to teach him a lesson-       *that was very unlucky if you ask me, but hey, if the berber didn´t replace the landmines he would have been death anyways I guess xd*
The soldier must be like this when he saw it was a can be like: ...F################################CK TWO DAYS OF MY LIFE PURELY WASTED
Yep that ending statement can't be anymore true especially these days with marriages going down the drain, most men are learning to avoid relationships and focus on themselves realizing they are more happy single with less restrictions on them and more freedom.
All I can say to Mike is BRUH.
So why exactly dont they go the exact way back they came from?
Can you cover the movie "Slender Man 2018" please it would mean alot
You should make a video on how to survive candyman
A friend of mine actually stepped on a landmine and lived. How? He got lucky. Mine malfunctioned and didnt go off immediately. He had time to move before it went off.
I’m 2 minutes in the video I have watched the main character was stepping on a metal can
If he wasn't sure about his pack and gear being heavy enough to keep the magic mine from exploding or thought he'd perish without them, I feel like his friend's corpse would've probably been sufficient. Macabre, maybe, but he isn't using it anymore
almost better than watching the movie itself
Bro I live in Australia, it’s been 40 degrees for days here.
But I had to agree some something,he was stuck there for like a week but what about his hunger,no HATE or anything but I'm curious
A tin can small but deadly
Attack on titan live action would be cool:D
well the landmine didnt explode right away because the sniper got bamboozled by a tin can and didnt know how landmines worked thats simply why he didnt die right away and the mine didnt explode instantly
I want him to be my science teacher
FBI: You know too much. SUS. FBI OPEN UP!!!
Do a video on how to beat troll hunter
This is basically "soldier that doesn't know how to soldier almost dies for no reason"
US Army: Tries to disable mine  Russian Army: *jumps away in soviet*
That fuxking berber could've done more lol. Man could've tried and inspect if the landmine was actually a tin can or something. He probably even knew it lol because he kept telling the soldier to move on but he made it like a riddle so the soldier didn't rlly understand.
Main character: does something right  Cinema summary: Great! But you did something wrong
He can make his way to Village by following the man's footprints and even if the landmine was real he can replace his weight by his friend's corpse
Every soldier should probably watch this video and subscribe to cinema summary. You know, just in case
Luck isnt real
THE MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD💬💬💬  (This is gonna be long. You can skip it if you want, but the Lord is soon to come. He will bring judgment for everyone who sinned against Him. This is the message of hope.)  What is the most important thing in life?  Well, if God exists, then it must be to get to know who He is, and to know what will happen to you after you die. ☝️☝️☝️  So where would you go when you die? ☠️  The Bible says all of us have sinned against God. All of us have offended the holy and just God whose justice requires our lives! "The soul that sins shall die — the penalty of sin is death."  So if everyone sinned, then everyone will die! God promises eternal condemnation for all who sinned against Him.  We are sinners living in despair in this world. We're here to suffer the  world for a time and suffer the next world for eternity.  There are people who tell us doing good things will save us from God's judgment. No, not really. Romans 6:23 says that the wages of sin is "death", and not good works. We must pay our sins with our own lives!  "Well, but doesn't God love us? "  Exactly! The Bible tells us that because of God's unconditional love for us, He became a man 2000 years ago to die for all our sins. ❤️❤️❤️  The requirement of sin was the sinner's life, but Jesus gave His life as a substitute for ours.   We sinned, but Jesus died. That's called the grace of God! God took that which is ours (our punishment) for us to have that which is His (eternal life).   If you believe in Jesus, your punishment will become His, and His eternal life will become yours.   We broke God's law, Jesus paid the fine! And He proved this by rising from the dead. I don't know about you, but if somebody rises from the dead, I'll believe what they say.  If you want to follow Christ today, then deny your whole self, and follow Him with all your heart! Pray and read the Bible daily and get to know who He is. Then start living for Him who died for you!   God bless you ❤️❤️❤️.  (Feel free to share this message anywhere you want to— to people, to your timeline, to comment sections on random groups and pages, group chats, YouTube comment sections, Instagram, send it as a text message, and share it anywhere you want. Because God has appointed a day of judgment for the entire humanity, but He is now calling all to repentance. He loves us so much that He doesn't want us to receive the judgment we deserve.),
you just wana destroy islam
I lost a friend in combat to a landmine. This movie keeps you on edge, just like the soldiers marching through deserts at this very moment. I'm glad it brings awareness to the fact that us as humanity need to stop our shit and be good to eachother for once.
This guy made me have a longer dream. I was dreaming about being at an airport and being followed by a guy. So i heared his voice say go lwft 2 times and right 1 time. This will frustrate him, run to the police after this
"How to beat Mine"  1. Don't be a solider in the first place  2. Profit
Please do game of death btw pin this if you will choose to do it. Have a damn good day!
We need to have a how to beat back rooms anyone else!?
I know it's not your Normal style, but I'd love to see you do a "how to survive: weirdmagedden" from gravity falls
you mean to tell me he never decided to dig up and inspect the land mine from the side to figure out what type it is ...
gonna spend 12 days watch all of theses and become immune to everything
Wen are you gonna do Texas chainsaw
Okay like, this is cool and all, but I'm not doing all this damn research just to survive, I'd rather die at that point.
10:29 but if he gets blown off the mine wont he survive as the sandstorm will blow him out of the landmines range
in the flare incident when it was too far away i would have just tried to bring it over to  me with the sniper because im sure its long enough
I would give up :D (pls help me)
damn the plot twist
I fell like I watched this video in 2020 instead of 2022?       my brain: ;-;
It all starts in the mind
I don't know how heavy landmines are, but if we've already established the landmine doesn't require much weight to keep locked, I would probably just dig the mine up and hold it with a hand, then use my dead buddy's weight to keep the mine clicked
so scary
Just drink water and don’t step on land mines, duh
Man why did he play riddles with him, just tell the man he’s fine bruh
Every cinema summary video has one word that is used in every video  "Okay"
This movie will definitely mess with your "mine" 🤣 ok going home now
Lmao trading a landmine for the ticking time bomb of a bad marriage
I would have put all the things on the  mine except the guns and the flare and wait on till they come
The common miss exception about animals is that they’re dumb actually animals are very intelligent if you fire rifle at them they’ll notice how much damage you did around them if you don’t hit them in the back off because of that
Wtf this guy is the dumbest person on earth all he needed to do is take of some of his extra clothes and follow the other guy to the village the other guy literally just walked like there was no trip mines
LOL
in the desert do not travel in the day time, it's too hot, wait till night fall when it gets too cold to travel that way you generate body heat and dont freeze to death yes you can freeze to death in a desert.......
that sand will melt your shoes
When the next video
He could have been digging around it to see what it was!!
Your voice has changed
I wish he was in a movie and see if he knows what to do
stress go brrr
imagine if he was still hallucinating
You should totally do 127 hours it's a good choice
to beat land mine is to just step off the mine because it was actually just a tin can replaced by the girl that gave the man water
Вы тоже от Звёздного Капитана?
Me, a mouth breather 👁👄👁
Anyone else what Nuke the thumbnail? Or at least throw some chapstick at it?
I thought this was a short cause all it was, was just a guy standing in bumfuck nowhere on a mine, and it would be great if it was but it isn’t it’s an hour and 45 minutes.. of a dude standing on a mine… people will watch anything man like god damn
Please cover the ritual netflix horror movie. I just watched it yesterday., it was sooo good and I cant help but think about your channel while watching it. The way the movies breaks the genre by using a god/demi god as the monster instead of a demon/ghost is really good.
It's also worth noting that the locals in the Sahara have a very low chance of actually helping an American solider. We're allies with Morocco and are even the only Western Nation in the world that supports their territorial claims in Western Sahara.   Hungary and Romania also both support Moroccan claims but calling them Western is kinda complicated.
Uhh CS? Quora peeps are saying there's no such thing as delayed mines. There are only instant mines. So who's right? I saw this from searching "What is the Shuman maneuver" Is something wrong with this video? The audio seems to lag 10sec.
14:20
wow 104 are u kidding me????? i still wear two hoodies in 110 and sit out in the sun and i fucking love it
How tf do you know all this stuff

It is a defective mine if you step on it and it doesn't blow up. The "Don't step off the mine" BS isn't true XD
Bro you should do how to beat the pale man in that labyrnith movie
i know nothing about land mines but could he take his boot and and fill it to the brim with sand and then he could go get help
I watched this a year ago
Can you please make a video about final decision 5
His ass would be dead from exposure by the end of the day and he would go through the water WAY faster.  Check out Survivorman in the desert.  That is what this would be far closer to.
I can't be the only person noticing that the video is like a half minute ahead of what is being said. Unless it is a problem on my end...
I want to see him be in a deadly scenario and see how he would survive.
I would try to fill my boot with sand or and thing heavy and run boi
this is like watching a movie but only in 20mins
Why not just dig around your foot to atleast  get a look at the mine.
No sun burn?.
i wouldnt be able to think if i was on a landmine; i would prob just start crying
I would rather die.
were the audio and video unsynced for anyone else?
Yo, an Spanish channel called “Como Vencer” is copying some of your vids bro.
*He doesn't realize that drinking pee does do some kidney failure..*
wait im confused. They requested pickup, right? But their gps tracker was broken... but they were waiting for the criminal in that spot? Like they had intel that he'd be there, so wouldnt the people that can come pick them up know that location?
Stopped watching for a couple months but glad I can pick it back up and watch
the convoy literally showed up late and then instantly decided to leave wtf

DONT DRINK YOUR PEE! Your body spends huge amounts of energy processing that pee, and it won’t get any nutrients from that pee. Your not being hydrated, your draining your energy.
Hope you have a good day man
Great!
I really enjoyed the video, great job as always, though from a technical standpoint... it feels like the audio is around 10-15 seconds behind the visuals later on in the video? Take 15:26 for instance, you're talking about him shooting to scare off the wild dogs while the footage for that is shown at 15:16 (that's one of the clearer examples, but it is everywhere). Again, it was a great video regardless and it doesn't really take away much, but I wondered whether something got messed up during editing. Cheers!
As a moroccan this so incredibly innacurate that i can’t watch it seriously 💀
Bruh just called marines soldiers. Ik im dumb but I didn't think I was dumb enough to be considered a member of the Crayola dinning club
AYO I AM ARABIC TOO
„Ready to take his next step- Realize he had been cheated on while he was away and she is married to 3 different dudes now.

My dad has a solar charger when he was in military
Orrrr Mike could just follow the black man to the village bc the black man 'ignores' the mines
Can you upload a video " HOW TO BEAT THE KILLER DOLL IN CHILD'S PLAY 2019

Now I really want to play spec ops the line.
Cinema summary could you react to the texas chainsaw massacre ( 2022 )?
Please put the celsius everytime you mention fahrenheit. 25 celsius is very hot compared to 25 fahrenheit, while 25 fahrenheit is -4 celsius.
Maybe if he assumed that the landmines instantly explode after contact with pressure, he would think that he wasn't stepping on a mine. Especially since he witnessed his friend blow up a landmine instantly after stepping on it and the mine exploded after he shot a mine near the end of the movie.
I never knew there were landmines in Tunisia.
You technically shouldn't even be sleeping at night in that situation as it drastically lowers your body temperature to a dangerous level  AND makes you lose consciousness of your surroundings.
the footage is unsynced, it throws me off so bad :(
This is why you always bring water
A mine that only explodes if pressure is removed is a strange wanna-be fiction of hollywood. Mines dont have big explosion radius. You want the mine to explode on your enemy, not near it. At any rate, with how much supplies there were given, I am suprised rescue even came.
Could u try how to beat "The Void" (2017) - it sounds like that between a rock and hard place ur vids work around
Yeah but this isn't the army Its the marine corps
Ngl when he almost fell he would have died because of the weight shifting  no matter what you do it’s still shifted
ima ring bell
i always forget to like tho lol
omg i just LOVE your videooos
Dude ... these mines go off when you take your foot off lol come on
Just know theres an enemy weapons developer somewhere listening to everyones "landmines dont do this" quotes
???
If i was that guy i will pull anything and put it on my leg and push it down very hard then i will take my foot away from the mine at the first day,when i met the guy i ask him to lead me to the village. But i dont know if it will work or nah
why do you and Nerd Explains both have similar scripts and thumbnails?
I was expecting the soldier to just cut his own foot
wait in real life there are mines in this field like in 2022
PTSD
yall over thinking this stuff. I'd just kill myself
honestly i fail to see how realistic it is, i get it, its a movie, but i cant shake the feeling that even in a movie, a soldier would legit take the risk to go into a minefield, wether it was fake or not
Do a video called How To Beat LeatherFace in “Texas Chainsaw Massacre”
I wouldn't survive
Those aren’t soldiers there are marines, we call the army soldiers marines are marines

How effective would jumping away as far as you could be? Like squatting down on both feet and then just longjumping for it? The mine would definitely still injure you but I would assume the damage would be mitigated.
do the promised neverland
And then he join task force 141 as roach
Wait, if that's not how real mines work, how come every movie does the same mistake? I mean, the misconception must've started somehow, right?
You are saying Sahara wrong
It’s hatchet not tomahawk
Could you please not blur out the blood 🩸
The skull and cross bones means danger not GTFO
Cinema summary the decisions in the movie and tv shows are better then your and get your thumbnail to be the same as the description tittle
couldnt he just put weight on his foot and then take the shoe off
hold on, aren't you the CEO of sex?
This is a brutal movie
This God damn man takin out all those dogs Hes god damn crazy as hell
A canteen is like I believe 1 liter of water or probably less a cup is less than a liter and yes you are right. I can barely drink 2 gallons I can probably drink a gallon max. If someone filled your water for you, don't chug the water like crazy and don't ration it, if you are thirsty drink but, if you are thirsty its already too late you are dehydrated. Plus what if the person just took your canteen and never returned or they return and  never come back or even poisoned your water. Water is very important but, if you have a full canteen mid day in the Sahara Desert 107 degrees out your water may not last you 24 hours less likely 12 hours. So if you decide to go to the Sahara Desert pack tons of water. One canteen of water won't do it. You need about 8 gallon jugs of water if you are out there for more than 24 hours. Im unsure on how to help you there a veteran would explain it better than me. At night its best to bundle up or start a fire. The Desert gets cold at night and the best way to stay warm in cold climates is wool or heavy or extra clothing. Wool may be itchy and uncomfortable but, it's better than freezing to death.
Bro sodium chloride is one thing not two it’s the scientific name for salt 😂

How to Beat the DEATH GAME in "GAME OF DEATH" (2017)
How to survive new leather face
the audio is delayed
i’m guessing that the guy who tried to help him was telling him the “landmine” he was standing on was actually a tin can considering it didn’t blow up after all the pressure changes and 52 hours
I would be very pist off if I was in his situation and realized it was a tin can
I’ll just move my foot and die😅
if only mines really worked that way thatd be swell unfortunately not even remotely close infact youd be dead or an amputee before you even realize what happened thier specifically designed that way to go off the second you trigger it most of them use a diaphram trigger and the minute the firing pin makes contact with the detonator your gonna be left legless of lifeless
Is this a rework?
All joking aside always bring at least 2 rolls of Duck tape. You could of dug around the mine trying to clear as much sand away then swap your foot with your hand and get in all fours. Now with your hand firmly against the mine start digging around all edges and then when enough rooms been made try and position the mine to where you can keep firm pressure while rapping the pressure sensor/plate up with as much duck tape as you have. Then flip the mine over so the blast is facing the hole you dug and not facing you
"Yo dude, the sign has a skull and crossbones!"  "naw its safe"  "aight u go on ahead, ill scour out other options of escape"   The End
Bro he has plot armour
i would most likely chop off my own leg after a day if it doesnt work then it was worth a try
14:07 this is for me
I’ve gone what 72 hours without sleep
Fucking Marines
i would take a step back with my free leg and jump as far as i can after 1hour of standing
Next vid How to survive the end of the universe
If I would be so relived that i was still alive a would find that Berber and beat the shit out of him for being cryptic and not just straight up telling me I'm not on a FUCKING MINE!
I thought they were in Afghanistan.
how get mod?
That thumbnail makes me feel uneasy 😅
So. All this clown has to do is untie his boot, then fill it with sand while moving his foot out. The weight of the sand is more than sufficient to keep the landmine trigger depressed.
"Da snipers didn't know where dae were."   Like they didn't plan this mission for days and know the exact location they would be preforming the op.   DUMB  Like they didn't have air support or artillery on standby in case they where ambushed.   DUMB  Like a U.S scout sniper wouldn't kill his target cuz wedding. The reason they are using a Sniper is because THEY KNEW IT WAS A WEDDING.  MEGA DUMB.  This movie is so stupid. 😂
How has nobody pointed out the the majority of the video is desynced by nearly 10 whole seconds? Incredibly distracting
How to beat mine: never leave your house
Me what i would do see where was the steps in the sand and leave 1 of my chose to go back at the bass bruh moment 1 thing to do ez pz
It's sad the little girl actually told him it's safe before she died the poor dad
THIS VIDEO WAS MADE ON MY BIRTHDAY
i don't know if it was just my device but my screen was faster then his talk. for example, when the screen showed a water bottle, like 5 seconds later he was talking about a water bottle
was the footage for this video delayed? or is it just me....i refreshed the page and it still was delayed.....
Skunk hating human pissed is the most anger fuel fact I’ve heard. Dang skunk stick to the moon but if I pee I’m disgusting to them?
I would walk away
Where's his emergency crayon rations
he should have just took off his boot : l .
The old guy: "you should move on" Me if I was the old guy: "it's a frickin tincan get up you look stupid"
Imagine he goes through all of that just to go back home and find out his girlfriend was cheating on him 😂
You should do run fight flight
Didn’t they thought the soldiers how to know if it’s a landmine or not by it’s sounds? (Correct me if wrong)
Bro I watched this once and I got 15 old spice ads
the fact that you could trust this man and he can also sacrifice you and use you as a meat shield💀
*cough* Bosnia *cough*
His friend immediately died and he didn’t it made sense that it’s not a mine
Soldiers wearing marpat?
Mine CRAFT
Don't land mines blow up the min you step on them not when you touch one boom your dead there no time to realize what you did
Why a wedding in the desert?
In mine
I think he’s running out of ideas
can you please make How To Beat Every Trap In Home Alone
So a good way to make wild dogs go away Is using piss and saying say piss off
Even you step on it you can’t even move. Now if you move you have to be like super duper fast
In land mines you definitely have to watch your step one wrong move you gone
this might not help me but this was vary interesting
if i was in this actual scenario, i'd probably freak out so bad i would literally get up off of the landmine, walk over to the bag and shoot myself
As someone who ran cross country and track all 4 years of highschool. I can confirm that the heat and dehydration scenario is true. That sun will drain your energy and cause cramps like no other
"A skull and crossbones is the international symbol for get the fuck outta here" absolute best line from cinema summary
Hey quick question could he drink the blood from the wild dogs or would it be infected or something
Why didn't he just tell him "You're not on mine"?
Litterly every video:this guy has made a huge mistake
Get your thumbnail correct to be the same as the description title
jesus christ the lips on the thumbnail scares the crap out of me
Talking about things of equal weight to be placed on the land mine, his plate carrier is easily heavily enough to keep the mine from going off
The best part about this is not only is the Shoeman maneuver fake and shouldn't be attempted, but the fact that landmines detonate on the initial pressure trigger. Like it's fun and intense and then you break through the Hollywood stuff and it's just like "oh yeah by the way uhhh... Comit die."
A skull means get the flipping shanty patty mcpatty daddy crappy Mayte fatty ratty ready ready meady could should bor door store out of the area
When the world is ending, I am going with you.
is it just me or is the sound kinda delayed by like 5 seconds
How did the wild dogs know where to step.
Western Sahara is no more it all Morocco now
halfway the video the audio got desynced, or was that just me :S
The plot armor bruh
maybe it's just me. but the playback is messed up on this video
He could’ve took another shoe and keep on the pressure by holding it
Do Attack on Titan
Are we gonna talk about the fact he played the outro too early and in the last few seconds it's just the last frame staring at us until the video ends
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
What's the name of the maneuver?
The explosive diffusion specialist be like “ Sir you do realize that this is a tin can?”
the sound is hella delayed
I cant imagine the trauma something like that would cause geez
Like man we don't all know 100 billion things bout everything like you! 😭
Just took the sniper a fake lindmine in a desert to finally marry the girl🤣 wow I am keeping this trick
When you said half of the people speak Arabic I speak Arabic
The fact that iam morrocan makes this even better lmao
all i was thinking was “ USE THE DEAD BODY OR DOG TO REPLACE IT ON THE MINE”
I couldn't finish video. I usually ok with characters being total peppega, but sniper not taking the shot because he saw a wooomahn 🤤👰 is unbelievably stupid. I thought it's the stupidest character across all movies, including horror movies. And then another idiot ignored landmines sign. WUT? WTF.
this is raсist
Mid movie
Good to see Cinema Summary did his homework
All these comments talking about "Mines, mines, mines!"   It's not yours, it's theirs!
Whenever I just need to wind down and can't find anything good to watch. I come here and know I'll get to relax and watch a movie in the shortest amount of time possible. Thank you!!! Now I want you to do Blown Away from 1994.
What if he like, kept his knee on the mine and dug around it to see if it was real or not
The saharan man walking confidently without even a pattern of path shouldve been enough for you to leave. Also, the saharan man stupid enough to not say that he stepping on a tin can. Maybe he racially motivated against the white soldier lmao jk
How to beat the mine: just walk >Video ends in 5 secs
You know even after you told several points suggesting that it wasn't actually a landmine, it still went over my head that "movie science".
PEE PEE
at first i would just use the sniper to dig through the sand carefully and see if it was actually a land mine, not all clicks in a desert means a landmine. so yah-
This gotta be one of the dumbest movies ever made
Teach me how you know all this
Why was the dude having a wedding in the middle of the desert? Is that a normal custom in the area or just a plot thing?
PLEASE make videos about the other parts of Maze Runner
Could you please do 'he’s out there '❤️
Hey yo how to beat make old boy they say it's a dark movie I'm interested what they say
if i was that sniper and i got an advice on them i would try to deig up to see if its a real or not
GOD really played the biggest prank on him probably gave him PTSD after that
Just dig the sand to see if its can or a real landmine
It would be cooler if the wild dogs where spotted hyenas i love those animals you might see😀
Cinema Summary Deserve More Subs
Hi
The thumbnails are so disturbing for me but I insisted to watch this vid
plot twist the whole thing was hallucinations he's still stuck on that land mine
I think to replace the weight of his foot it's too risky considering the margin for error is slim
You want to know something that they don't put in all movies common sense.
Anyone seen Kajaki Kilo Two Bravo? Excellent, yet downright disturbing movie (and true story) that shows the truly horrific nature of these weapons.
hey a movie i actually watched for once, ngl i liked the premise, pacing was kinda slow for my liking but its a good watch if youre bored
Why not dig up the mine and keep the same pressure on it as you find shade?
He should have just pined his boot down with his tomahawk and knife with the tension of the boot being pined
Why didn’t he just put his bag or other stuff he had in his boot and take his foot out of his boot
i remember watching this at 6 and my parents never found out, pretty good! will rewatch
There’s a funny thing about a meme in china where is that a guy stepped on a antitank mine and said that he is not making out but the fact is that he can’t even generate enough force to actually detonate it.
i would beat it by not bieng a soldier and never going to that desert kinda easy
Honestly, if I were him, I would’ve grabbed one of the wild dogs and thrown it between me and the mine, dog shield
if i was him i would have just jumped while in the sandstorm that way the sandstorm could throw me away from the blowing landmine (if it was a landmine tho)
the dude is a sniper and he can use his urine to save his life why does this sound so familiar?
That race run across the desert that's actually insane. If the idea of traveling to Africa then sprinting in the hot sun with I'm assuming little water. Is fun to you then your actually crazy.
deppression
I've seen this movie it's pretty good
I would have died in a hour
I watched this movie on Hulu
Hold up WHY DIDINT HE USE HIS FRIEND BODY
Everybody’s a sniper. Lol
Lol. Smh.
Just drink water LMFAO.
This guy is literally in no danger of being kidnapped.
If that was me if just make a run for it lol
Whats your fav how to beat mine is the final
Expect the fact that the film is just one huge metaphor for "mines" in our life that seem without exit that eat us from inside like abuse etc but none of them is really able to stop you but only our own mind. If you just make step forward you will get out of them. Really recomend the movie. For people who didnt watch, this mine is probbably the one that the berbers daughter got blown up on. Have damn good day guys :D
If 2020 was a desert this would be the one
Marines will be triggered by you calling him a "Soldier" instead of a "Marine"
Wouldn't the storm push u away before the explosion
This man could’ve left any time he wanted
That minne fact at 4:10 is not 100% correct. There is press and release mines in use.
@Cinema Summary   This aint funny I'm an og and I know this video is really old
Great vid as always. could you maybe do a how to beat the blair witch project?
I'm pretty sure pressure release activated landmines exist.
man i could make this 28 mins vid in 1 min long he could just remove his shoe and keep the weight on by using his force fromk his hand so he could also put the bag on top of the shoe to keep the weight so he can sleep in comfort and wait or trace his path back while bringing his friend
Bruh really said: wait hold it I just had a freaking bruh moment
25°F (-3°C) is cold? *laughs in Finnish*

Can you pls do how to beat hostel 2 and 3 Pls since youve already done part 1 of hostel
Main lesson Don't step on A FUCKING LAND MINE
Bruh the spanish flag in 12:18 is the one used during the dictatorship
This moovie is epic so cool i loved it
All his life on a can
The fact that the landmine wasn’t even active THE WHOLE TIME.
How to beat it just step off it and you beat it boom
Clearly you havent seen or met a marine sniper who has had the proper training. He would rather blow his leg off, rather than leave his rifle in the desert and not with him.
That explains why his friend blew up Instantly but he could step on the mine and shift 90% of his body weight off it without any problems. He must have fell asleep in training or he'd know those facts about how mines work
😂
This is so dumb he could’ve literally just took off his boot it’s so easy
Once again, another great video!
The biggest "screw you specifically" the guy will ever experience
He could’ve replaced his weight with his dead partner sadly but could’ve work
I already see this movie but i want to see again
I watched all of yours videos.. now im immortal. thanks!
Why not dig a little around the mine under your foot, to actually know what your standing on?
Okay good video, but will the soldier do whatever it takes to survive?
Hey what about the movie the boy behind the door
Nice commentary to a cheesy ending 🤣🤣🤣
I would choose the easy way out and take my foot of the landmine
this is the second land mine movie ive heard of where the guy on a land mine was never actually on a fucking land mine  first one kinda sucked
This is the biggest risk you can do but its probably worth it. You stick the knife more down and try guessing how tall it is by how round it is and how deep the knife touches it. If its longer than a normal landmine it has a high chance that it isnt a mine
Me the whole time: Just place something on your foot to make you able to not trigger mine and then walk how you saw the man walk!
Why replace them with anything? Why not just disarm and remove them?
Why didnt he dig around the mine and used something heavy to substitute for his leg instead? Like a dead body
Hindsight is 2020
i would have just tied my shoe around the land mine and took my foot out of the shoe
Can you next do 127 hours?
this man would easily get out of anything
That technique must be based on fact. Heard a story once (documentary or book) of a solider using his shoelaces to tie the mine to his boot, which allowed him to move out of the minefield and into a safe area so the mine could be disarmed and removed.  I keep getting Vietnam and one of those jumping mines for some reason.
2:33 Got the Best of Me, Im crying rn XD
Cinema summary try to beat the killer warewolf in  "Howl"
I appreciate your work, and I enjoy the shit outta your videos that allow me to "watch" movies I would never really wanna sit through entirely, but...might I suggest a Nedi-pot, or a Claritin, or perhaps even just a tissue? Cause you sound stuffed up!
https://youtu.be/XCamVQ0YRdo
He didn't even try to dig the mine to check it out
Just imagine stepping on a "land mine" and holding pressure on it for 2 days only to figure out it's just a tin can.
bro my brain just expanded thank you
Can't decide who is stupider, this guy? or the one from the pool.
bro went from math to science to social studies
tbh I prefer survival movies and series like this then horror because they are generally less scarier and is more thrilling to watch
When Cinema Summary roasts the movie for failing its own premise by saying there is no real danger proving it with info from the movie and the setting...
We still dont know why he didnt take his shoe off
Rah
He’s the sniper from tf2 (Jerate)
Fun fact: the desert that would kill you the fastest is Antarctica. Yes Antarctica is a desert. Deserts don’t have to be hot.
The first mistake was the guy not taking the shot!
its not a lesson its glory

Those are Marines not Soldiers.
can you please do how to beat final destination 5
This movie fucking sucks
Didn’t you say when he stepped on the “mine” it made a beep but when he discovered it was a can it got my confused
Fun fact:you'll probably just forget about this and you probably wouldn't think twice because you're too stressed and full of anxiety
this movie is old but its only got famous this day
If that was me, I'd be sobbing. I could've left the whole entire time.
Even though this is a how to beat video maybe do some more research before doing anything, because some things can be right and others wrong. But a great movie and video.
Easy don’t step on the mine
How would I beat mined? I would put the training I was given to good use instead of being a fool.
Makes makeshift grappling hook with tomahawk, every problem after that. "Its to far away to grab"
If they ever want to recast Paul walkers in FF, armie hammer can take up the role. Once I saw this movie I could see the resemblance
This guy is a god he literally Teaches us how to survive lol
Amazing, could you do run hide fight next?
I like how they made a movie about this not knowing anything about it
I love how he could be a detective but he still makes these videos
This is easy
I don't know why they always depict landmines like this. Real landmines go off when you step on, not when you take your foot off.
A skull on a sign mean "gtfo"  😂
Not be a soldier: ITS THAT EASY
Fun-Fact: All Pressure activated mines explode the moment you step on them. Its actually a simple process. Once someone or something puts enough pressure or weight onto the mine, it triggeres the mechanism and that triggers the explosive. Mines that only activate once stepped on, and then explode when pressure releases makes no sense and would be complicated to make.
THE WHOLE TIME HE COULD OF STEPPED OFF OF IT!?
Imagine some guy decides to assasinate cinema summary and on the spot when he is ready to kill he gets a notification saying "How To Beat The IDIOT ASSASINATOR In "Real Life".
I love how the danger sign is Arabic lol
who is quanum888??? why is he going viral over here??? I don’t understand
Couldn’t he just used his frind body when it moved next to him after the sand storm and then put it on the mine
The international sign for GTFO
Gives me some Kings Man vibes
If I had just stepped on a bottle I would have had the same reaction
"Trading in a landmine for a ticking timebomb of a bad marriage" That is so dark and hilarious!
I'm not 100% on this but considering a lack of options and the inevitable results; I'd risk shooting the mine: knowing modern explosives aren't like nitro-glycerine or black-powder, I'd try to damage the effectivity of the mines explosive decompression. The explosive in a grenade is negligible when detonated outside to confines of the shell, it only explodes because the shell breaks by detonation exceeding the container; a few holes in the landmine will let the explosion wiff-out with a sputter.
just drink some water dummies

One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~🎈
hey cinema summary. YOU KNOW IT'S A fCKING MOVIE RIGHTTTTT!!!
Why not just... Use the backpack to replace the weight on the mine?
Then the ☠️ simple is used for pirates so the want you to gtfo
These guys are not very good soldiers.
This is not africa this it egpt
Bosnia
imagine if the girlfriend said no to his proposal
I don't usually take movies that seriously. I mean, I can watch a series about some kids stopping an interdimensional demon. But this movie tries too hard to feel real, but fails at just that.
This man forgot all his training and  abandoned their mission, putting fellow soldier in danger.
So he got canned?
first i would die cause im polish
i would simply just not step on the mines 🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
how i would beet mine is to not be a soldier
The bible says the last of the last of days were going to be difficult. Repent against your sins and you will be saved!
How do we even know the stranger is real? Usually in movies it'd be a hallucination lol.
14:40 whats that clip from? And who is the "french" girl lol
Yes, you *can* take a step.
Never ask A Woman: Her Age A Man: His Salary Cinema Summary: When did he get so smart
Should've played geoguessr
i don't understnad millitary stuff, but like  shouldn't they have had a back up in case said GPS thing got busted? or more water in case they're stuck there for longer periods of time?  Or why don't both of them carry batteries?!?!??! you know just in case something happens to the first lot of batteries?!?!
1:56 is it me or are these soldiers lookin’ kinda THICC
Your smart
The more you watch his videos and hear his voice,his voice gets different kinda or am i crazy

"The Skull And Cross Bones Is The International Symbol For Get The F*ck Out Of Here"   This Got Me Good
dude this channel sucks
That is the biggest twist in this movie like there was no active mine it was just a can that he was standing on for over 48 hour's in Sahara dessert that soldier is a true survivor
Alternate ending: shoot the criminal before the girl gets in the way
the movie "The Call Up" is pretty good

Imagine if he just google these tips and just forget about them once the video is done
This is my favorite movie when i was a kid i keep saying that:MOM WHY WONT HE JUST MOVE AND RUN AS FAST AS HE CAN
Hey look it's the charming cannibal (not joking. Armie Hammer, look them up)
i would have been sooo pissed and relieved at the end there
This man should be in a mrbeast challenge
Have a nice day.
sad news about the wild dogs. thats my moms favorite animal
The twist made me like the movie
Can you make a video on escaping the terminator from terminator 1
The fact that he didn't inspect what kind of landmine it is is actually stupid he could've used his rifle to dig up around it and see what it is
Sniper : does anything Cinema Sumary : *explains lore*
Nerd!!!!!!!!
If they were snipers I promise you they would have a map. And could figure out where they are and it looks like the desert cammies I think they’re marines
"Completely your fault"  Sorry sir
A bit how that Cinema Summary  pretends like this lunatic-of-a-villager is some sort of nice Hero.   I mean, Hello? What an unresponsible guy, who could have told the Soldier at  any moment he can step away.

can u plss do geostorm
to be honest if you were actually in this situation would you think like this?
"How to beat a minefield in Mine"  Me with no problems says "Craft" after he says "Mine"  Yup you guess it
1:32 so they dont hear where the gun was shot k
The sniper was an idiot for making the scope of his gun looking at the sun
Poor *I FORGOT HIS NAME* He stepped on a tin can for 69 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Hours!
Request: How to beat The Posession of Hannalh Grace
Best option that might work is just grab something heavy and put it ontop of the mine like the radio or something and then he can work on the radio while ontop of mine to prevent it of exploding
easy all you got to do whille you on the land mind put you backpack or put something in you shoe on it and run away frome the land mines
He looks like he could use some chapstick
The fact that the sniper is way more mature the spotter is funny to me, when the spotter should have more experience.
Great video but one thing! Towards the beginning you state that due to types of mines and the odds that he will die the soldier should’ve stepped off of the mine and ran to get his gear. I disagree because the soldier just saw his friend step off and the mine explode, so the odds that the mines are different types that close to each other are low, therefore he probably shouldn’t have walked off of the mine
Baby Me Kids Salon is a great place to go
Would have been perfect if his girl left him at at end. Lol
what i would do just dig if it a land mine
What a stupid movie lol. Writing in movies is so bad it is stunning sometimes.
That was basically just looking for your phone but using the flashlight on your phone but really intense
Well, that explains why when he kneeled on the mime nothing happened.
Please don't call it that. It's known as the "Painted Dog" and its not a dog.
can we all just appreciate that banger music in the background?
I hate when people make moves that only put tge main characters in danger because of their overwhelming stupidity.
i am not joking, at the begining i said that mike was gonna live and his friend was gonna die
It's kinda nasty but I keep thinking what if he drinks the blood of the dogs or his comrade idk the contents of it or if it will help/make it worse but damn worth a shot
I watched this movie a couple years and forgot about it thanks for bringing back this memory
He could have put he’s gun and other stuff like heavy clothes and equipment on top of his shoe and carefully removed his feet
I’ve see. This movie great
when the guy told him about that they removed some of the mines and replaced them with cans why didn't the guy without taking his foot off check if it was one of the cans?
Have the best day of your life
that last line lmfao.. little did he know his wife wa getting railed by the neigbour
Maybe it was because he was already exhausted and delirious, but I feel like he could have eaten the wild dogs for sustenance. Also drink the blood.
Most apers mines have about a 3 lb arming pressure, could be more or way less depending on the mine. There are very few mass produced mines that would actually go off when you take your foot off instead of when you step on them. maybe there's a delay maybe not. At that point you kind of hope it's not the type to go boom after your foot leaves it or after a couple of seconds.  Granted it could be some IED that's weird and doesn't follow the norm but fuck it full send. You die you die, you don't you don't.
This video starter pack "This was completely stupid" "This is unrealistic" "But the _____ isn't working"
Apparently the worlds smallest wild cat also has a extremely high success rate so small predators seem to be the most successful for some reason
Where I live in Canada in the summer it sometimes hits 40c it is brutal  After about 34c the air feels stale and it's hard to think
bro wtf do you mean "i would conserve resourses" bro you would fucking die in the first 5 minuites because you try to pull some austin powers shit
I didnt see that it was a wedding
Congrats on 45th trending
count how many times he says okay
1:41 like a litte biatch
I was done when he said the international symbol for get the f ** out of here 😭😭😂😂😂😂
Happy V-day everyone
you tell em dude
Bro why u so handsome 😍
You missed 1 thing. The marine corps is too fucking cheap for dirtbikes. Id also like to add that this was very poorly planned. I hate this movie for this reason only. My only favorite part of this movie is the uniform accuracy. From the proper camies to the danner reckonings. I own a pair of those boots and they are insanely light.
How to beat Mine: Take a step forward.
How To Beat Mine:  1) Realize its a tin can  2) you're free
Fun fact:the sniper never shoots the sniper
now THATS  how u do a proper mrbeast video
Step one to beat mine: don’t be a dumbass and listen to the universal rule of skull and cross bones equals run away you will die if you ignore it
Welcome to Bosnia!
if i stepped on a land mine i'd probably explode
#NerfMiner
Bro I don't want you to die but I need to see you in one of these situations
Imagine being stuck in the desert for 2-3 days and only then finding out it was a tin can, i would be so pissed
Cinema Summary crushed these guys in the  first 3 minutes and 30 seconds of the video. Legend.
this is like a mrbeast challenge
Mistake: going into that area without your friendly bomb-sniffing rat. They only cost around 7k to train, and a rat buddy could save your life.
i would be PISSED
This ended up being good.
thumbnail changed
i watched a recap on this movie before but I wanted to know what cinema summary would say to beat it
This is the ultimate MrBeast challenge
"The military requests your location right now."
"if your trapped stepping on a land mine in the desert for 51 hours what do uou do?" Step off of it
Meh. They couldn't have ran more than a mile from the last known local. Movie logic is arghhh
omg its a gtfo sign
1. don’t step on a mine you win
real landmines explode when you step on them, not when you release so this movie is pretty retarded   edit nevermind this movie is just super retarded in general
This whole movie was kinda stupid like they went “ ohp it wasn’t a mine at the end haha “
I know this movie and I know what to do at first  kill my self and that wasn’t a choice this whole time it was a can
Can you do final destination five, it’s on Netflix
This man is teaching us all for the future and giving us great life lessons, and I know it’s all in the movies but if I ever come to a position like this then I know who to trust
Homie really came back every morning with a new riddle instead of just telling dude you're not on a mine bro.
alternate title: non-soldier does a soldier's job for them
Ngl this is not a scary movie
I love your accent. ❤️
This is why i love the marine corps and this movie has its ups and downs
WE WANT HOW TO BEAT EUPHORIA(HENTAI)
These 2 are snipers on a very specific mission to kill someone. Command should know exactly where they are and when they set up, they should already have told command where exactly they're positioned or even pre planned where they are going to set up. Also experienced snipers would know about scope lens reflecting and would have had a cover for it to prevent glare and reflections. Even if they got made, they would have tried to call for help as soon as possible and QRF would have already be on the way to their last position. They would either hunker down or move to a different spot and hide until help comes and then radio their general location or pop smoke to signal where.
20:30This is from Real Life Lore
What a racist movie , always portraying Americans as hero’s and middle easterners as evil. I’m signalling the video
The amount of wrong things these two did was unbelievable. I know it’s a film but why wouldn’t they do some basic research to at least make the scenario realistic
I just wouldn’t be a soldier bam I won
3:09This is in Mauritania near the border with Western Sahara
havent you posted this video before
DOGE 🐕
What is with this guy. I feel like he could survive anything.
Let’s go appreciate the video and keep up the good work and have a damn good day
If I stepped on a mine and it doesn't blow up more than 3 seconds after I stepped on it I would just step off it and continue moving sighing in pure relief and luck
This guy has an iq below zero, if i was him i would poke the "mine" a bit more to see if it is a mine, or take off my shoe, then Put my backpack on it so the mine doesnt get triggered  Or use my stuff as sandbags to prevent my legs from being blown off
Me breaths:  cinema summary: “he has just made the last mistake he will ever make”
At 6:35 ish;  There is far more variance of Mines than this message lets on.   While what you say is partially true, and you could likely move your foot off the mine and be fine; This is not always the case, and there are a number of mines which wouldn't go off until pressure is released  That said; Pressure-Release Fuse mines are not Usually used for anti-personnel, so the advise could be accurate ~ But its a gamble, especially considering the mines may have been placed by less trained insurgents using whatever mines and fuses they had at their disposal
nice video
I wonder if the writers did any research at all. My bil is a marine and usually loves these movies but was totally taken out of the experience. He wasn't as kind as CS about the inaccuracies even after trying to give it some credit for being a movie.
This dude can survive anything. I would try to memorize the bur burs foot steps so I know where it’s safe to walk and where it’s not safe to walk.
Lmao after a story like this I wouldn't want to marry him unless he promises he won't play soldier ever again.
cinema summary, yes but ofcourse i would act line these guys in horror movies and if i didnt sleep for 2 days ofcourse i wouldnt think straight
How to survive: move
Dang that guy is willing to live man slauthered the pack just to survive without sleeping
This dude is always teaching us something. We would probably never be in these situations, but rest assured if we are, we will all know HOW TO BEAT IT!
I would beat mine by being a marine
The landmine he was stuck on not being a landmine is some comedy movie bullshit
I saw this movie before, i liked it even if the whole movie is a guy standing on a mine, which doesn't turn out to be a mine lol.
Geez i gotta watch this movie
21:12 he cant do that cause he cant move
Man's got epic stories to tell to his grandchildren
Have you ever thought about making a t-shirt that says "Meat Shield"?
I mean, movie's gotta movie, but this whole problem could've been avoided if the stranger just told him, "Hey, this is one of the mines we dug up and replaced! You're NOT going to die!" instead of being vague as fuck about it when someone thinks their LIFE is on the line!
This might not work because of illness the dogs might have an illness wich would weaken him more and likely kill him.
I haven’t met any marine that uses a tomahawk so this is cap
lmao this is what i dont get the fact that a soldier didnt take the warning seriously is one thing. but the fact that they DIDNT follow the tracks left by the people is completely stupid why the fuck would u not do that because i already know how badly that one dumbass soldier wanna go threw a land mine field so instead of, yknow, DYING just walk exactly where the tracks are this way not of this happen.
just dont be a soldier 👌👌
I am the only one who watched the  movie before this video
Is this considered a horror movie?
In 2050 we will run out of resources… We need this man
6:43 i’m no Expert but some mines go off when you step off it, ore realise pressure from it
I got and idea for you can you do a video about how to beat stranger things
I actually fluently understand Berber (speaking not as much) so this was cool! I don’t usually see this type of representation lol
ogs know the og name
I had an IED blow up underneath my truck that shit isn't easy
We already knew not to lock Cinema Summary in a death game, but now we also know not to take him on in a war.
Honestly, I think this movie would have royally pissed me off. If not the myriad of dumb decisions, but that freaking ending! The desert land mine equivalent of "it was all a dream".
So nobody is talking about this.. but why not use his friends body as a weight for the mine? Like it's heavy too right?
Twisty thing but, could have it worked to place the friend's dead body on his feet after uncording the shoes, then move his feet out of the shoe, away as well as himself so the dead body covers the mine along his shoe so if it explodes they reduce the impact radius of the explosion
Sees thumbnail: Trypophobia: "Here we go again"
Those are some crusty lips.
When i watched this movie, I started laughing and feeling sorry for the dude. He wasted all that time in one spot, Knowing He could've spent all that time with his family
30 seconds into the video: Wow. I like how a sniper is actually depicted as a team with a spotter rather than the lone wolf type. That's a refreshing change of pace from other stuff!
You know this is going to be a good movie when he tells how to beat
This video in particular had a lot of good insight on survival in the desert. People often wonder why desert travelers are wearing so much clothing and all that and they don't realize that it gets freezing cold at night. Not to mention, the layers provide protection against the sun and sand. And the water loss was such a great bit of knowledge, losing water and dehydrating quicker.
The sniper made one wrong move not to dig around the sand near the mine maybe try to disable it
I KNEW IT THIS WHOLE HE WASNT STANDING ON ANYTHING
Land mines actually go off the moment you step on them, not when you step off them. They wouldn’t be a very effective weapon otherwise. I feel like a fully trained soldier would know that if he had actually stepped on a land mine, he would be pink dust.
Who holds a wedding literally in the middle of the desert?
"A ticking tome bomb of a bad marriage." 😆
Uhm real landmines explode as soon as you step on them they don’t wait for you to step off..
dance till your'e dead
That's not an apropiate spanish flag, the eagle in the flag was from a dictator called Franco
Never heard about this movie but the premise sounds interesting
dam the proposal joke just made my day man
I would beat mine by taking a step
I’m not all the way through yet, but if the mine (at least in this movie) wouldn’t go off without lifting my foot, I would have undone my boot and then piled stuff on my shoe to increase the weight over the landmine, then slowly remove my foot from my boot and jump away
Dude this is a movie just enjoy the movie
omg 666k views
Let's be real,the real MVP was the Berber man who was checking up on him every day to help him survive,without him there was no way the soldier would have ever survived
Mans iut here fucking criticising military tacs 💀 The sergant be like damn should've watches cinema summary.
The best way to beat this is to not step on the mine
Cinema: the guards spot something flashing in the distance  Me: nah it's just call of duty habits
Why didnt they just drone strike the target? That would have been far more effective then two incompetent, horribly ignorant, and obviously poorly trained turds who blow themselves up and gets stuck on a tin can.
This is definitely “mine” because I own it Also have a absolute amazing day
When will you tell us how to beat Final Destination 5?
Minecraft players: put some water on the mine and sit in boat and you will fly away 👁👅👁
this movie was honestly the most boring and wasted 1 hour of my life time
good to know is rabbit/deer/skunk attack at night i can just spray my wee around
Then the man blinks, but he doesn't realize he has just made the worst mistake of his life
That last line 🤣🤣🤣
me when the plot armour:
The first time I saw this movie I was on an aircraft carrier heading to Afghanistan. A lot of my fellow marines did not like it because it was “ boring”. But I really enjoyed it.
Have a damn good day!
This movie's dumb.
24:47 Tenet?
Gah, I hate it when this dumb plot device is used. There's literally a spot in Final Fantasy 8 just like this where the ice cold assassin gets sentimental second thoughts and refuses to pull the trigger on the big bad, causing the game to last several more CDs.
If u didn't know a mine cant make a big crack like metal if it dose then his friend would've heard it and stopped and he can take something heavy and put on his shoe as the mine it will still take the weight not knowing it isn't him
Can you do frozen next(not with elsa) it's a movie created in 2010
Man so if we get into a death movie with Cinema Summary what will he do and what will we have to do to not die?  1st: He will sacrifice us of he had to so do not break his trust   2nd:We will have to agree with him with anything   3rd: AND READ THIS IF YOU DON’T READ THIS YOU WILL DIE IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY IN A DEATH MOVIE WITH CS              Keep going                COME ON GOO!?              Just 5 steps away            Have a damn good day
Not realistic as the USA is known to drone strike weddings & school graduations.
I feel like every one of these videos I get a history lesson and a amazing video!
He should of listed when the man told him to step forward...
I would just put my backpack on the mine
i would be grateful and upset at the same time to come to find out the mine was a dud
do you have a how to lose series? where you be the villain and try to beat the main characters plot armour
should've just killed them in the first minutes of the movie
Man I'd feel really dumb, furious, relieved, and frustrated, while sobbing like a baby
dude just imagen the research!!!!!!!
Hey, That's mine!
If I was in this situation I would have died at first because of my stupidity
DO HOW TO BEAT THE FOURTH KIND PLS
The whole time I was like I would not be waiting 50 hours for maybe a rescue. I'd take my chances using the back packs and my friends body to build a barrier to block as much of the blast and/or shrapnel as possible. Could even be enough to keep my leg if I build up the barrier and move my foot behind it (back the way I came of course bc there's no mines directly behind us)
i’ve watched this! it was a fake grenade! if this spoiled it for you let me tell you that you should not be in the comments if you did not watch it till the end
so no one’s gonna talk about how he still managed to snipe 2 enemies dead while being extremely exhausted and probably on the brink of passing out or even dying?? That’s hella impressive
this is similar to the true store of kilo two bravo
The desert man: "we do a little trolling here."
bet this wont get pinned comment in next 2 days
xd
Well quicker survived : when his  friend's dead body was close to him , he could change his weight with the one of the body and survive .
"Trading landmine in the desert, with the ticking time-bomb of a bad marriage" :D
if i was in mine then i would probably the guy who dies at the start
Wowwwwwwwww all that just for it to be a can
How to beat idea :stay alive
damn day
Hate to be that guy but these are US Marines not soldiers
This dude should have knowned that the deaf child was saying it was a fake mine I watched this Movie
you can't do anything better than you are sayng
Craft
Man: breaths with mouth open to increase air intake Cinema Summary: That was their first mistake, I would just hold my breath until I am rescued in order to preserve the oxygen that is already in my body.
I haven't seen the movie, but was the Berber a hallucination too? I assume so.  And yeah, the sniper is a moron.
Meeeee
ngl the dogs looked scary as hell
GTFO just got me good XD
OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OKOK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK
I thought the skull and crossbones was the international symbol for “All ye enter/witness get fucked”
His lips in the thumbnail arent terrifying anymore, i thank you
29:51 bruh moment
imagine wasting 30 mins seeing the man standing on the can 🤣
Literally all he had to do was put his dead friend body on the mine and just leave...
When I realise it’s a tin can I kill myself
that burber is an asshole,WHY DIDN,T HE JUS TSAYED TO HIM THAT HE IS STANDING ON A TILL CAN?
I feel like that you neglected to mention the most important tip, which is making sure that the land mine you are stepping on is an ACTUAL land mine.
sick video
What if your in this situation and don't have google
26:08 how the hell can you think when you are already delusional...
Marines not soldiers
Is it just me or is the old mic he used is better
To be fair? No landmine does the “won’t go off until you step off”.
24:10 house cats actually have a higher success rate for kills, but i mean their kills are mice, birds, and rabbits, not like big animals that could actually fight back to some degree
have a damn good night.
How to beat Mine: "Upon learning that the terrorist he had been targeting for months would have minimal security while meeting someone in an uninhabited desert area, "Main Character" sergeant Shooty McShooterperson made the call to swap the original sniper rifle loadout for a UAV-launched missile strike. Now, instead of spending the next tense few days slowly trying to escape an unknown minefield, "Main Character" is taking a nice shower after the AC-cooled UAV booth confirmed all targets down."
I’m other words, this movie was poorly made
I BELIEVE AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE. THE TITLE SHOULD BE....  THE WORTHLESS IDIOT TRIAL SOLDIERS
why didn't he use his friend's body to hold the bomb?
Mr beast: last one to take lag out landmine leaves with there life's.
Damn Cinema Summary just roasted the Director of this movie. His spitting fact about how a soldier should think. The director in this movie doesnt even consider these possibities and facts. I love your content my guy
thers no mine its just a tin can
Damn that guys a badass for killing the whole pack of wild dogs
i will just leave everyone with this legendary reference    "A dud?"
I would give up if it turned out I was standing on a bloody can!
How to beat mine:walk
If i was in that situation and came to knew the mine was a dud...    I will personally step on a real mine
Soldier: Shows signs of Empathy in a morally ambiguous situation Cinema Summary: This guy, is a fucking Nerrrrd
He s*it
The fact that the sniper decided "Nah" all because the insurgent leader was getting married is just a hoot. Oh boohoo, some terroristic asshole is getting married, so what. Heck, he was probs gonna abuse his quite young wife anyway.
Murphy's Law: The Movie
Would digging up the "landmine" and tying it really tight to your foot  work? I mean, if it followed the supposed landmine rules of this movie
is this Nerd Explains other account or something?? or a deleted video?
This guy got juked by my guy the burbur mad respect
I would be so terrified I would probably gotten off early
The video wasn’t 30secs in and they made a big mistake 😭
I know the mine wouldn't explode but I didn't know it wasn't a bomb
If you just stepped on a landmine what would you do  Normal procedure is to jump 200 ft into the air and scatter yourself over a wide area
This guy should be a detective
These kind of movies are really good!
Yours
I thought you already made this video a long time ago
woah this man is really gonna be a detective or something
Well, no one would've followed the man btw. They must've been scared about it. But there WAS a possibility!
I like how the guy’s camis say US Marines and he’s still a soldier.
I'm surprised he didn't dig around the 'landmine' to check it
the soldiers, give time to be happy for the target tough decision  The mission or Humanity
am i dejavu? cause i remember watching this in cinema summary long time ago
Just a movie that sucks
Damn he really got no faith in that mans marriage.
At end of the day he finally realize how stup*d he is
2:31 Aw hell yeah, bad ass CCTs
Oh damn, didn’t know you’d cover this
Thank you for this, I’ve been standing on a mine for 1 night now and this really helps!
just take off ur shoe then run
I lowkey hate that burbur why ain’t he just tell him
*Gets caught in death trap* *Cinema summary intro plays*
Wouldn’t it be impossible to stand on a land mine for 52 hours because your leg would cramp
The thumbnail looks like it need some jergins and some carmax
Am I the only one who thought that he could use his ace to get his friends body to him to get the batterys
I fucking hate his commentary but I can't stop watching
i think his past job a in the milatary because he nows alot about it
Man didn't get his strawberry slushie 😢
some simple land mines are triggered by stepping off
Knowing me I will try discover what else and then realize
"Burn in holy fire!"
Cinemma summary just after explaining the first scene of the movie: your set up is wack
I knew as soon as that guy walked right up to him that he could’ve walked away 💀
How I would beat mine is just by walking off 🤷‍♂️
I saw this movie from a movie recap again.
this man can survive a whole Death Scenario
I thought that the 1st thing that someone with military training when they step on a mine is to see what type it is and dig it up to see if they know how to disable it
You got wild dog corpses drink there blood it contains enough water  to keep you alive for a bit longer
man these people are too stupid to be alive
Dude if I was a serial killer and I kidnapped you I would just be like well damn you can go now
Tips to survive - Just move from the mine because it's just a can.  - be the camera man.
What about using his friends body as a weight for the landmine he could also have drank the dogs blood for hydration
You should do wolf creek
Is it just me or does anyone else find it really annoying when he stops the video and does his “ OkEy, tHiS iS EpiC!” and proceeds to act like he’s about to point out the most mind blowing thing, but only repeats what he just said two seconds ago. It’s so freaking annoying to hear. I like his videos but god damn that shit gets so annoying hearing it after the hundredth time
You know the explanation of how to solve/beat the movie is good when you watch it dispite already having already watching it and seeing 2 recaps
basically a mr beast video about staying on a landmine for 54 hours
Why is hearing him say drink pee so funny
The US Army gives out tomahawks like candy when you deploy lol.
The two guys aren’t soldiers, they’re marines 🗿
Ok, just be lucky enough to not step on a mine.
Imagine cinema summary has a kid
ngl those dogs look like zombies
when you best friend got blown to him try to move the body onto the mine while moving your foot
The guy was a bit too lucky. Really makes the movie feel out of touch with reality.
PUT THE HEAVIEST THING ON THE FREAKIN LAND MIND TO RUN BRO
Movies rely on the characters being stupid and cowardly.
I love watching your videos, they are really entertaining and I love seeing the way you think of solutions!
Idea: How to Beat "The Silence"
no boiesnkxusvl
The berber said he needs to "move on or he'll be stuck forever", he was actually talking about the tin cans placed in the sand as "mines". He should've been more clear (and not walked away immediately). No wonder he said that. It doesn't change the fact that they're still mines around AND you can't tell if they're mines or tin cans. I realized how weird it is that this berber didn't tell Mike the SECOND TIME when he showed up again that he needs to "move on" or just straight-up tell him he's (probably) on a tin can.
im on the half part and im thinking the guy is saying that the mine your stepping on is a dead one
kinda ironic how the sniper has a bag of piss *tf2 sniper theme plays*
Bro is literally teaching us how to survive zombie zombie apocalypse death trap games and even in the army! This should be a school
That thumbnail makes my skin crawl
Im stone
Bro I got 4 ads within the first 5 mins of the video. That's ridiculous. How does this guy need so many ads and still needs sponsors?
If I was in a death game I would watch one of his videos .
If ur gonna bleep out ur f words why even say them. Stop trying to be so “cool.”
If had to choose getting killed by a land mine or a pack of african wild dogs i would pick land mine for sure because it would be a much faster death
I’m actually surprised there’s no one correcting him on saying “soldier” when they’re obviously marines
I would be pissed off that the guy in the desert know you was on a fake mine lol all that time and didn’t say an damne thing
Oh no here’s cinema summary once again hindsighting again. Yes I know it’s not a word but all this guy does is say is junk. U like these type watch nerd explains his is actual ideas not lazy just talking about what’s happening
I'm bear grylls, I'm gonna show you what it takes to get out alive in some on the most dangerous places on earth. Iv gotta make it through a week of challenges in places where you wouldn't last a day without the right survival skills.
Honestly, it's great to learn a valuable life lesson. But Id be pissed that the stranger knew I wasn't even on a mine and I could've just left.
Tbh I would of jumped to where dead friend was
19:19 have to keep those fluids going.
This is a great movie
He has plot armour
that's actually really stupid he should've just killed them
I would die very quickly
You have been doing a lot of movies that have already been done by mystery recap, can you do a different one pls!
Huh why can't he just remove the boots and take his feet off
Man I love these sorts of videos
I saw the thumbnail and my first thought was “Man this guy needs some chapstick”
The ticking time bomb of a bad marriage is always closer everyday for me
I would've went to that village, found that dude, and whooped his ass!
Assuming that was a live landmine that was going to blow if weight was taken off, there were so many opportunities to replace the soldier's weight with his equipment, his friend's dead body that nature blew over next to him, or the pack of dead dogs that came to him at night. It's like God is telling the guy "Yo, here's your way out!" but he didn't take them.
A real landmine would've exploded instantly, if it was rusty and breaking down, it'd be his situation.
I got a question in theory couldn't he have filled one of the backpacks with enough sand to replace his foot then backed out of the minefield?
I wonder if he could've pulled an indiana jones and stacked up his gear on his foot then slowly pulled himself out
I wouldn’t beat it, I would just simply die.
If u a position u don't want to be in click on one of videos close to your problem
30:47 the tomahawk and two EMAG is enough to count as foot pressure and weight
THEY ARE NOT SOLDIERS!!! But im not claiming them as Marines. Cuz they definitely not acting like it
Why didn't he think of using his friend's body on the mine? Like the Indiana Jones bait-n-switch
Ok, land mines don't care about how much weight is on or being moved off them as long as the weight stays above the set weight of the primer mechanism. With his friend dead he could of tried dragging his body over it and carefully switch places. The second thing he could of done was to remove the sappi plates from his vest to create a tamping effect of the explosive, Antipersonnel mines are designed to mame you not kill you and the overwhelming majority of them are only a few pounds and have a very low weight trigger and a plate or two or your friends body would be more then enough to protect you against them. BUT if the antipersonnel mine didn't go off when you triggered it you are probably safe. Another thing is that during your operational orders for this mission and mission planning it would have included alternate routes for secondary extraction points and this would include intel about possible mine fields and hostile forces in the area. Lastly the spotter would absolutely have a paper map and compass and be able to get their exact position in about a minute, this is day one shit.   I get theyre trying to manufacture drama for the plot but holy shit this is completely unbelievable and absolute BS on any armed forces member willingly walking across open desert in daylight in a spec ops mission for hours, they would have had a reconnaissance vehicle of some sort to transport them to and from the theater.
You can beat it just throw rocks before you walk there
The guy was insanely lucky That The mine was a can But unlucky That He Decides to Not do the risk when the Barbarian said it
i used to watch your videos alot but I also watch mystery recapped and they do the same movies but before you not a hate comment just a suggestion to upload more or something
If you step on a land mine period you should start preying and try to stop the bleeding immediately
Out of all of the people you do this your the best at it
love ya :D
Its night time and im still enjoying you vids☺
Imagine if the end was a hallucination
I never understood why my uncle (a solider) was so frustrated watching this movie. And now I do.
WOW!! Not another "stepped on a land mine; hear a "click"; and do not move" movie. As a former Combat Engineer for 20 years that delt with land mines all the time, this movie just .... Since the area in question was most likely scattered with CONVENTIONAL land mines, this sniper team should have been more aware of their immediate surroundings. At NO time in my 20 years in military handling/training/disarming land mines or placing/removing mine fields did we ever train for this type of scenario!!! NEVER ever happened!!! You stepped on a land mine - BOOM - see ya, don't want to be ya!!! You have a better chance of surviving this scenario IF you stepped on an ANTI-TANK mine, but definitely NOT an ANTI-PERSONNEL mine.  Before they deployed to whatever country they were in, this sniper team would have received training on the types of threats to be expected - especially land mines AND mine field MARKINGS. NOT all mine fields are going to be marked properly, but these guys had some type of divine intervention when that mine marking sign landed at their feet. Looks like this area most likely had conventional ANTI-PERSONNEL land mines (the types you step on and go BOOM almost IMMEDIATELY) or ANTI-TANK land mines (vehicles drive over and go BOOM). True - there are some types of anti-personnel mines that have a certain amount of delay like a BOUNDING mine which will bound into the air a certain distance after someone steps on it or triggers a trip wire. The bounding mine will usually go roughly hip-high then explode, thus sending thousands of tiny beads about the size of BBs 360* and killing/maiming anyone/thing in its kill zone. Also, BOOBY TRAPS and/or ANTI-HANDLING DEVICES can be placed on any land mine thus giving a few extra seconds before activation IF disturbed.  Anti-tank mines need a certain amount of WEIGHT on them in order to activate, usually the WEIGHT of a wheeled vehicle or tank. Now, some anti-tank mines can be activated by the use of a TILT ROD - a fiberglass rod that is screwed into the top of the anti-tank mine's fuse that will activate the mine IF it is tilted a certain number of degrees, thus killing a vehicle without that vehicle actually running over said mine. Now that tilt rod can also be tilted in high winds, thus exploding the mine without killing anything - one of the primary reasons why US military got rid of them in 1980s. Also, anti-tank mines can have a pneumatic hose screwed into the fuse and stretched out a few feet thus increasing the likely hood that a vehicle will run over that hose; forcing air into the fuse well; and activating the mine. US military had gotten away for those as well way back in the 1980s. Soviet style mines had the same capabilities.  Now since this sniper stepped on a mine, heard a "click" (which he was lucky to survive without soiling himself), and the mine did NOT automatically explode, chances were that he stepped on an anti-tank mine OR a defective mine of any sort. Seems that the area that he was in had Soviet style land mines AND those mines were most likely in place for a very long time. I was stationed in South Korea in early 1990s and we were told that there are land mines of all sorts still in place along the North/South border since the 1950s!! Most likely true which would mean that ain't nobody going to remove those mines for they would have become way too unstable (they may explode; they may not explode; or they may sort of explode meaning that the explosive charge could be too far deteriorated to do what it is supposed to do properly).  Anyway, since the land mine did not explode after the sniper stepped on it, I think that he did the correct thing by kneeling down to determine type of land mine he stepped on. IF he discovered that it was an anti-tank mine, he most likely could have just taken his foot off it (anti-tank mines need a certain amount of weight/pressure in order for them to activate). If it was discovered to have been an anti-personnel mine, he could have deduced that it was most likely a dud (something that should have been taught to him before his deployment and re-inforced throughout time in country) and gone about his business. HOWEVER, since those land mines were most likely in place for quite a few years and most likely have become unstable, he probably did the right thing by staying in place for a few hours. Now for the rest of the movie...well makes good DRAMA for a movie.  Again, 20 years in military handling this stuff and NEVER trained for nor heard about this scenario. EVERYTHING that I typed was what I experienced from 1981-2001, so DO NOT KNOW how modern military trains for a scenario like this - maybe they do, maybe they do not, but yeah, does make for a good movie. You will see a scenario similar like this in the movie "Kelly's Heroes" & "The Boys in Company C", and a few other movies.
Can u do the 2021 zombie show called "Love you as the world ends"
The next video is "How To Beat Cinema Summary". Can you guys think of a way how to beat him? Because I can't.
How the hell do you know so damn much
sorry but thats absolutely hilarious. i had a hunch that it wasnt a real mine when the guy shook his head in disappointment, and when 'he hit metal', but i wasn't expecting to be right.
Plot twist: he was never saved and he's still hallucinating
The mine wasn't actually a mine he stepped on a can
Iknow How to get out of it Use the backback or anything Heavy put under his feet, slowy raise your leg and put the backpack under his feet HE has freedom
Lol you think your smarter than the military? It's a movie it's about plot.
Movie recap got the og vid
☠️=get the f*CK out
I said “imagine if the land mine is deactivated” and I guess I was sorta right
So you're telling me Cinema Summary is smarter than the military?, Now thats a damn insane knowledge. Have a damn good guy.
"These soldiers wouldn't hesitate to commit war crimes"...  I mean, you're probably not wrong, but kinda weird to be so pleased about that.
Well depending if I was that solder I would forget all {ft he training and probably die
next : final destination 5
It would be really nice if you made a how to beat video on the movie "Trench 11". Don't you guys agree?  Have a damn good day everyone.
WOW that guy was a dick.
You guys have always talked about how to beat for movies but what if it was not a movie. Can you guys do the backrooms? This thing, in particular, has 999 levels and each level has a monster. And every time you go down a hole then that means it's the next level until well... I don't even know but 1 thing is for sure you will fall down to Earth at a specific point. Created by Kane Pixels. Oh and here is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4dGpz6cnHo
The dude’s face in the thumbnail gave me chills.
Should've realised it was a dud because its didn't instantly blow up. Mines are triggered by the initially pressure not by stepping off them. Infact I dont think a single mine is activated by releasing pressure. Infact some mines you dont even have to step on directly. Just changes in pressure around them will trigger them.
I would've given up at the 5th hour cuz I have no determination to stay somewhere for 50hrs and then I would have realized I was safe and thought i was stupid.
One thing he could've done was use his dead friend's body as a substitute for his own weight. While it might seem crass it allows him to exit the minefield and get help.
Dude your making no sense if u stepped on a land mine 99% you in particular are not making it out alive or with ur feet still attached stop making this shit cause someone idiot may try this
AHH HE POSTED AGAIN!!!!
Nerf miner
"how would you beat it"?   ight imma head out **big boom**
DO TRAIN TO BUSAN
ZIAN AND TITO DE IS COBRA KAI!
Bro if I just got done sitting somewhere for 2 days just to figure out it wasn’t active I would just run into a active land mine
How the hell did you make a whole 30 minute video on a movie where the protag just doesnt move off a supposed landmine for a few days
hell why use a sniper for this a drone would work just fine
how did the daughter not know English if her dad clearly did
but its the movie's interesting part is that making mistakes if they did the things you said it wouldn't be a movie
Ayo I think I have a similar if not the same type of clock this guy has
"ticking time bomb of a bad marriage" *chuckles intensely*
Who the fuck drives out to the middle of nowhere to get married in an empty desert lmfao
That guy that helped the solder was the biggest dick in the universe, he could have said "Dude thats not a mine,"
From the first time I heard the man say keep walking I would’ve followed his advice
“now that’s just lazy writing”
Br
17:40 what no the wouldnt eat him alive they whould atack him cosing the mine to explode and die together
Omg we watched this in bootcamp and went over everything they did wrong. It was fun
this movie is so damn frustrating literally WHY not tell him just 'hey you can move you know'
Wait I actually watched this before I found this lol let’s freaking go
Soldiers back in 1990s ND early 2000s would have did this right, this is the point of view of a soldier from the present generation
please tell me what is going on with those horrendous thumbnails 😂😂
Imagine you stand in 1 spot for hours then realizing that YOU CAN MOVE THE ENTIRE TIME
The movie should've been "idiot sniper in a dessert"
20:30 Brew made a detailed video about this man's story check it out here if you want https://youtu.be/mJMXtrVZq5I
Oh no! What a horrible situation!!       Let's start a GoFundMe for them lips in the thumbnail
the African wild dogs do not have the highest success rate the preying mantis dose it can predict its preys every move with a success rate of 96%
How to beat mine turns on creative mode
You left out the fact that his friend shot himself
first of all when he was taking inventory how the heck did not set off a landmine in that wide area second of all when he was pulling the radio bag how did he not trigger a mine
APEX PREDATOR “Monke noises”
Try to be more carefully with the flags you use. You didn’t use the current spanish flag. The flag that you used it’s a fascist flag, used during the times of the Franco’s fascist dictatorship, who was a suporter of Hitler and musolini The current spanish flag is either plain red Yellow red, or the same with a coat of arms. The flag that you used it’s an extremly offensive and controversial flag. It’s basically, as i alterady said, a fascist flag from an elder regime
If u are watching this on valentines day just remember you are watching the mine but yet have no one to call "mine" (no I am not projecting, you are projecting😭)
cinema summary: he did a great job. two seconds later* cinema summary: he's an idiot
“Trading in a land mine in the dessert with the ticking time bomb of a bad marriage” ☠️☠️☠️
the guy has bin awake for probably 55 hours he not thinking straight he can’t do anything smart rn
as you said, if i didn't got blown up in less than 2 seconds after ''triggering'' a mine, i would at least try to jump back if the mine was a delayed one, pretty stupid for a trained soldier ngl, and if you take a look, the man got really close to him without fearing any explosion, enough to get his canteen and even to catch him near the end, no one would really risk his own life for a stranger they gave water once and even said to the soldier to ''free himself'' in their first meeting, this was  clear sign that or the mine was a deactivated one despite the odds, or there was no mine, and the guy really could have said to him earlier that the mine was fake
30:35 "but what do you think? how would you beat mine?" this could be taken out of context so easily
Sniper : (breathes) Cinema Summary  : *That is a blundering move. If I were you , I would not breathe to save the oxygen around me and not breathe in sharp hot sand. The criminals may also hear us and the land mines will explode if you breathe.*
14:43 😬 thats not the Spanish flag, thats the one used by Franco a spanish dictator around 1939, not a very "friendly" guy to be honest.
Thats a lot if probables my dude
The whole part where he was drinking his urine if he had just a little bit of plastic he could have made a solar still It would have evaporated the water out leaving the urea chloride and sodium in the sand All he had to do was just find something heavy enough to hold the plastic down around in the sand as well as something to put in the middle of the plastic it's basic survival use what you have to get what you need but then again dehydration makes it hard to think so it's a catch 22
Hes picking up the technology of landmines and the type but there are ones that are pressure plated
Yo i remember suggesting this video, idk if he saw my comment or not but thx cinemma summary
I have a genuine question: why do some land mines only explode when you step on and then off them? Why shouldn’t they just explode the second you step on them?
This situation would never happen
oh no are table it's broken
I am convinced you were in the military
You should do game night
Listen to the guy in the middle of nowhere that sounds like a psycho
My one question is why replace the landmine with a tin can? Is it to deter any soldiers from coming close? Is it some sort of ceremonial thing like honoring someone who died from a landmine? Was this particular landmine the one that killed the local's daughter and hurt his leg and the tin can with the toy soldier his idea of remembering her?
Have a damn good day
Awesome! Have been waiting for this video.
Bro 25 degrees is very hot for British people
They should make a sequel about his wife having to survive her husband trying to cannibalize her.
POV you're in the apocalypse and cinema summary is your only hope
please do IT 2 😄
MrBeast be like "Today, I trapped 100 innocent civilians on landmines and the last person to explode gets $100,000."
"Pee on them to show dominance" is a legit survival option here.
At the mine part I'd shoot the mines
Its a good day when this man uploads, keep it up
I loved this movie
Can you do drag me to hell?
This was the worst plan possible. That's almost an unecessary suicide mission
I wouldn't beat mine I'd beat yours
This might be one of the worst written soldiers Ive ever seen in (what I assume is) a self considering serious movie. I very much appreciate Cinema Summary for going through this for us viewrs lol
"Dont lose body fluids" Meanwhile i would be crying like a baby
The most combat you've got is some hours on tarkov
Missed asian movies vids
Can you do How to beat Attack On Titan
I mean..the guy is an asshole if he knew all along :D
I love the savagery having to kill someone at their own wedding
Can we just appreciate how god damn detailed these videos are
Wow when u watched this movie I thought of none of these helpful situations
If he is a script writer all his movies will all be logically thought out and make sense.
Who cares if it's a wedding, blow homie  away
Imagine being a soldier, planning for a mission for a few months and then end up dying, not because of failing the mission, but because you didn’t listen to your squad mate after he said “There are landmines.” And calling him fucking paranoid as if they didn’t just get hit with *an actual fucking sign from the gods* that there are mines.
Man even if it’s a movie , the sniper not killing the target was so stupid
His biggest mistake was not taking the shot.  It doesn't matter if he's getting married, that isn't going to change the reason he ended up on the target card.  What an idiot.
Since it's a movie landmine, dig it out while holding it to your boot, use one of your laces and tie the landline to your boot, take your foot out while increasing the pressure, chuck it, take your dead friends boot.
Z
How long does it take to make a video
Man steps on tin can, instantly regrets it
WAIT, COULD HE NOT JUST TAKE HIS SHOE OFF WHILE PUSHING DOWN ON THE SHOE TO KEEP THE PRESSURE? AND JUST STEP OUT OK...
Why did he not follow the footsteps in the first place
lol a fuçkîng tin can
Oh this one
I have a trick to win every death game and jig saw trap ever. Don’t be American, Japanese or Korean. Live in a random place where this stuff doesn’t happen, like Slovenia or Sweden
Great vid, but this movie is so stupid
Take a motorcycle like the aussie Mozzie
Bruh he was on a frickin tin can !!!
I feel sorry for any soliders or just anyone in general that has to deal with land mines or a situation like this movie .
How pissed would you be if you did all this for it to be a tin can like id be extremely happy im not dead but so confused scared and pissed off that i was shot ' nearly eaten ' and more for it to be a tin can
Landmines in the desert: exist pack of wolves approaching him: does not set a SINGLE LANDIMINE fucking wolves and their creative mode...
I'm sad cuz I saw this in cinema recaps and now i know what gonna happen :(
I don't know about the land mine. When I was in the army I was thaught that there vere land mines that explode when you step off of them. There are also mines that explode from noice, vibration and magnetism. Many of them have more than one of these qualities.  In other words you are fucked
The thing I'd probably do in this situation would be to try to take my backpack full of supplies and dead friend's body, and slowly put it over the mine using my body weight.  Then I'd slowly slip my foot out my boots and get on top of the backpack and corpse to still keep the weight and pressure on the mine, so I can make a last ditch jump towards safety. (tho I'd probably would be injured by the blast radius, not to mention a loss of supplies trying to get off it)
This is the only one of these movies that kinda feels like it has some truth in it
On that little girl bringing the guy water bit i would have started panicking saying HEY HEY WAIT STOP JUST THROW IT TO ME as much as i know that she would know where to step to go around the mines i would still be scared of her getting blown up
Its dope that you know all this extra stuff in these situations but I wouldnt be thinking about how hot it is when the sun moves to the left or what senses irritate certain animal's when I think I'm standing on a land mine 😂
Couldn't he use the corpse of his friend as a weight to keep weight on the mine trigger ?
Cinema summary I have a suggestion for a vid you should cover how to survive zoombies it’s. A zombie movie but with zoo animals and a second one released not to long ago and it’s a really cool underrated movie you should check out
14:42 wth was that flag of spain?
Ouch, I think the entire Corp felt that last jab.
Ugh, I hate that cliche...no military member who is under capture risk, should be carrying photos of their family.  If captured and tortured, interrogators will use that photo to mentally break them.
Honestly, this is a great movie. Not only this situation can happen to any soldier, but also you don't even know if the landmine is broken or not, or is it even a mine at all.  And the realisation that he never been in any danger hits so hard. You were sitting in the desert, not moving and waiting for help, but when you finally give up and move, you find out it's not a mine.. you wasted your time here.. thinking you will explode if you move.
Literally this whole movie could have been avoided with a drone strike
Ooo this show i watch it already
lol the ending
i would have dug around the mine to see it and observe it
Well, if I stepped on a mine I would pull my phone out and watch cinema summary’s video on how to beat the death trap in mine.  Also have a dam good day
too bad the camera man couldn't help :(
Moral of the story, do your damn job!
Bro the editing that goes into these videos is insane, I've been watching your content for over a year now and it never drops off love you man :)
Video idea: How to beat your future and past self in triangle.
A lot of Soviet mines had triggers like this. They were cheap and very common in Africa. They required about 20 pounds of pressure and if you dropped it to sub 20 boom. One thing I've heard though is if you maintain pressure on them for a few hours they also explode anyways but that might only be some of them.
If you step on a land mine radio in your GPS.
And he came home to find out his girlfriend cheated on him
How to beat mine: you wouldn’t because land mines explode when stepped on not when you step off
My dad once went into a minefield by accident! Granted, all the mines were probably too old to explode at all anyway, but there was still a chance. Since it was an Old minefield, some of the mines had already exploded forever ago, so he got out by walking in the craters of already exploded mines. You can't explode something twice : ) do not walk in minefields even old ones 👍
Could he not use his friends body weight for the mine ?
Fun fact the coordinates he used in the video actually were in the middle of nowhere in the western Sahara desert in a place known as sun shine shopping mall
If you ever wanted to cover yourself in urine. Here is your sign
So my dad wrote GTFO
I cringe every time he calls them soldiers. This guy is terrible with everything that has to do with the military.
Thank you for making these, absolutely, awesome! videos!
I could've lived that cause I would probably think im gonna die anyway but the mine was a tin can so I'd follow the man back to the village before 48 hours passed :)
Thought you said that you start revealing what the others are virus done in this video
Thanks for uploading it makes my day
My dad run a school and crossbones and it’s still here
I am in shock from the ending
Any deadly thing:*happens* Everyone watching cinema summary, nerd explains and how to beat anime:nah man. It's ok
The burbar could have said:you’re stepping on a can
ay
Dude in da thumbnail need sum Vaseline🤣🤣
You in you puns in the and I love it
Sht period of my life. But ur videos help me. I don't like watching films, I haven't watch many, but I enjoy ur videos. Much love~
This seems like it's a much better movie than I would guess if someone just told me it's about a guy who steps on a mine.
anyone here knows the background song???
the only mistake that mike did was that he's a weenie...
imagine being a soldier who cant shoot a human because of a stupid reason like a wedding
Imagine how dumb he would feel having stood on a tin can for 2 days thinking it’s a landmine
How to survive desert: Urine. There you go that's the video.
lol, the hole time he was standing on a can
sorry for playing the smartass, but the wild dogs shown in the movie do not live in eastern marokko, where the soldier is trapped. the species shown in the movie is the african tri-coloured twitterer, a dog species known for its funny chirping voice. the problem here is that the tri-coloured twitterer lives in zaire, capetown and zimbabwe in half-humid, shrub savannah, not in the northern desert. the only wild canine in the northern desert who could come close to you is the egyptian jackal and the gold wolf.
What was the point of explaining this movie If the guy lives?
This guy is so damm smart I like mean smart
*wassup wassup*
Thanks for tearing this movie apart lol someone needed to do it
He could have just FOLLOWED THE FOOTSTEPS
Vid idea: how to beat unlisted. It is an epic netflix seires
This movie conveys so much with so little. such good acting
hi
At least it's not like in real life there have been 7 billion land mines in Africa
This thumbnail made me cringe soooo damn hard.
Today! I made 2 of my friends stand on a landmine for 52 hours! And only one could win 200,000$
You know, the biggest twist is the fact that it wasn't even an active land mine at the end, imagine the overwhelming feeling of relief the soldier got.
There's many types of landmines not just two. It all depends on the type of trigger. Also depending on the type of landmine you can repin it. If they didn't glue to hole.
Except there are mines with pressure triggers...
104 degrees Fahrenheit? Naw I got my tablet to heat up to 135 degrees Fahrenheit while playing roblox
why his lips like that
Are you Nerd Explains?
I think you can take of the shoe and get away with it
learn your branches bro A US Marine sniper becomes trapped in the desert after standing on a landmine.
so if you're thirsty, better to douse your piss than to drink your piss.
*both of the soldiers legs blown off the body by a land mine* The soldier: *Strawberry slushy*
I was sleep but when i heard it 2 am but since you teach me everything no need for studying
one bad thing about finishing his water you have to take small sips and it would make a better choice to survive and then he would get unconcios and die
Finally my daily dose of survival information I hopefully will never need to use.
Hey
Cinema summery: If you just stepped on a landmine in the desert and one wrong step can blow you to pieces, what do you do?  Me: .............Cry whilst eating tamales and binge watching this channel🙃 ( COOL VIDEO BY THE WAY!)
I would beat “Mine” by ether following the mans advice or just hoping that it wouldn’t explode
Cinema summary is like the best survivalist
Lesson of the day: don’t drink your own piss
This movie was good but it was bullshit at the same time. First off I hate riddles the old guy could have just told him he's standing on a can straight up. Also who the fuck arranged this mission? Personally I feel like this was a suicide mission that they failed to tell the soldiers they were on those dudes were meant to die...
Their first mistake was brining an apple watch on a mission and then depending on it
I don’t know why I watched this, but this was so beyond stressful to watch. I knew it would be okay, but I didn’t know HOW, and watching him start to fade away was awful. Pretty good movie.
US Soldiers don’t act like that: The Movie
Thanks man
Yesssss
can you do how to beat army of the dead pls
OK but it wouldve been nice to tell him he was on a tin can then giving him a riddle
Me after this movie: 😂😆😆😂🤣🤣😅😅😅🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🤣🤣😀😀😉😊🙃
Oh man i couldnt watch this.. this is just old man boner fuel, so many stupid choices..
Lesson: never become a solider
I am feeling a bit of a mandala effect here, I thought the spotter killed himself and told the sniper to survive
one day. just one day. he will just narrate a movie without pausing and telling their mistakes
If they had never replaced it with a tin can, he would’ve never been in that situation to begin with. They didn’t help him. They caused his plight.
Very good
They should have just brought Crosshair on this mission: "Good soldiers follow orders"
I had goosebumps throughout the whole video. Your knowledge never ceases to amaze us. 😃
yo thats crazy
Trading in a landmine for taking time bomb of a bad marriage 🤣
i remeber watching the summarized version from mystery recapped
That thumbnail kinda made my skin crawl
I learn about animals in death traps I love this
The first thing you always do is dig around the mine to see what you’re working with
Wild dogs appear Me: not often dinner approaches me.
"A skull and crossbones is the international symbol of GTFO" i legit cried
Lol
Damn, those who have seen Kingsmen...
"The man is terrafied" The guy:*Shows no emotions*
Jesus Christ those chapped lips and cracked skin on the thumbnail. Barbaric
The first time the man said he should move on I figured he couldve left at anytime.
Do enemy at the gates
is no one gonna point out how the friend looks australian as fuck
i woud step of next 10 h
All that suffering just so a woman who was most likely being forced into a marriage wouldn't have brain matter splattered on her
Bruh just step off  how is the 30 minutes long
Drag buddy close,like under you so his body stops fragments, lift leg, first aid your leg, stay put
I love your videos
Damn, ur actually smart
He has 30 essays in this video
He's back
This movie gave me so much anxiety for no damn reason
H-Ho-HOW?
How would I beat MINE? Well it is simple : I don't.
oh i saw this
The dude that stepped on a land mine could have taken his shoe off held it down then probably ran for his fucking life but still would probably die unless he got really lucky
Although you *are* correct about land mines activating instantly, there was a type of trap in WW2 for stairs that when you step on a stair it activates, and when you take your foot off it, it explodes, it is impossible to see it as the click could be mistaken as a creak.
This guy is a legend even if it was just a movie sitting there for the hours it would have taken to make the shots has to be super hard and boring
Man stepped on a "mine" and then lost his mind. like no joke dude went mental😂😂
29:44 I’d be so fucking pissed
Why was the thumbnail changed?
Bruhh he did stand there for 48 hour for nothing
Finally u did my fav movie... What took so long
i would take my friends body and place it on the mine
Staw berry slushie :)
He got one thing wrong I’ve seen this movie before and those aren’t dogs were wolfs
23:05 Jesus Christ wtf
This is a really amazing movie with a good message, but it still bothers me that he had to stand on the mine for that long when they are typically made to explode right away. If you think about it, why would the enemy make a mine that gives you the leeway to be able to try and disarm/get out of it after making contact?
the ending was too smooth. damn.
Um you said you would do a sequel to your last video suspicion mmmm
hey i want to know how you make your videos. i also think that it would make a great video
Most videos after like 3mins it's boring but with deez I can't get enough of it
I was wondering if you could do antlers I feel like it could make a good video anyways love your work man
Imagine breathing and seeing this dude saying ok so this dude made the worst mistake of his life
i will forever be addicted to this channel
thanks for telling me how to survive
They are not Soldiers, they are Marines. Huge difference. Good video though.
Before I even watch this video, the answer is: Minesweeper
1- Actual snipers know scopes flash, so they shield them from the sun. Since the freaking 30s, lol. 2-  sand dunes would be the least dangerous type of terrain to use landmines in, since nothing focuses or contains the blast, spreading the damage out. 3- Landmines in sand dunes would be easier to dig out or tilt in a different direction. 4- the spotter's body, pack, or his own pack would be enough to cut the shrapnel risk to almost nothing.  A ribcage in between you and a landmine is almost as good as a shield.  This movie should have been called "Contrivance in the Desert"
Can’t he follow the man to the village
13:38 put his friends body on it
12:55 honestly I would’ve taken the chance, stepped off the mine and followed the footsteps in the sand
Holy shit tin can who could've seen that twist
Simple not go to war
sorry I forgot to subscribe
CS might get recruited after making this video
This man will never die in anything.
when how to beat home alone, that will be the hardest of them all
Soldier: casually walks... Cinema summary: Ok...
how the fuck do you always know how to survive in every situation
ZAMN bruh his lips chapped asf
bruh i wouldve quit and sued somebody cuz wtf
This movie has such strong “directed by Americans” vibes but it’s actually an Italian movie
To be fair on the minefield, since the sign was blown in by the wind it’s not entirely reasonable to believe that the sign is meant for the area they are in.
"..... The ticking time bomb of a bad marriage."  I mean, the guys a soldier with a TON of ptsd. So, yeah, that marriage is already not looking great. 🤣
Here is an Idea for an April Fools video: the video would be (like) a clickbait were it would be The Hardest Movie to survive with only a 1% rate of survival,only to the video being about How to beat the first live Action Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie
yes
Billy Bat final chapter be like
I got my mom hooked on these videos. She always wondered how I had so much survival knowledge when I've only lived in the hood and suburbs 😂 Now she knows and watches them herself. Keep up the great work!
I would’ve went back to find the Berber and punched him right in his face for that
anyone else watch this mans videos so if i ever come into a fucked situation i got all this info to help me like deadass might save my life one day
Its safe to say that he was doing all this to propose to her girlfriend
“The ticking time bomb of a bad marraige” when I tell you I LOST my shit🤣🤣🤣
Take all your heavy ass equipment and slip it into your shoe, then slip your foot out of the shoe and follow your footprints back from where you came from.
Why didn't the soldier ask the man to get help?
Do you think he proposed by asking "Will you be mine?"
Nah cuz if I found out that I just spent 52 hours in the desert for absolutely no reason I'd hop on a real landmine
One thing you missed: Snipers are also trained to always lens cap their sniper scope before pulling off the weapon. You are trained to do this, so that if your scope ever gives of a glint, it is only if the enemy is look directly at you. This was poor thinking and lack of discipline on the soldiers part.
So basically this whole thing could have been avoided if the US didnt hire the most idiotic sniper team ever
If you step on an anti-personelle mine you'd be dead immediately. It's a Hollywood movie trope where you can step on a mine and I won't go off. An anti-vehicle mine needs a certain amount of weight to set it off and some of them have a double trigger.
Did you just change the thumbnail
I swear the thumbnail just changed please tell im not going crazy
4:25 why do all movies about land mines always do the “walking backwards and then blowing up mid-dialogue” thing?😂
Joe Biden must of helped with the extraction part of their plan. LGBFJB
Dude is better off on the landmine than to get married.
the outro lmfaoo
I would say man fuck this shit and hit a gamble after hearing he changes mines to cans
I’d just step off it. Landmines don’t go click and then explode when you step off. If I suspected it was one of the very few models that did explode after being stepped off, then I’d just brush away the sand and see if there’s any way to defuse it or keep the thing depressed
I know how just don't go to the military
you should do a video on hush, very intense house break in, the main characters death so its a very interesting narrative, the whole time my adrenaline was up it was very goodddd   lol ok i just saw u did a video on hush nvm my bad. another good films till death
We love you man making these videos to prepare us using your time for us
You need about 10 lbs of pressure to activate one. Tbh your chances of survival in a desert don’t realistically last anything more than 24 hrs without water. I’d just be insanely careful while trying to place my gear and weapon in replacement of my leg while praying that I don’t f*** up😭🤣
:D
Thank you Cinema Summary for making these cool videos that are mind blowing. Thank you, and have a damn good day
hi
Saw that the sniper didnt take the shot because of a wedding and turned off the video. I love your content, but this would frustrate me way too much to keep on watching tbh lol
i feel bad for him cuz he is abot to die but he wunts a strobaryslushy
They were laying on a rock for hours waiting for their target and their command didn't know where they were? Cmooooon
This movie should be called “Bruh Moment”
why blur absolutely everything that has a little blood on it?... genuine question
Important lesson I learnt from this channel is to never trust the guy. He'll use you as meat shield. 😂
If I was this guy,I would just take all of it and step forward XD
Someday, I’m gonna leave my house and your educational videos will maybe be helpful but in the meantime, they are entertaining! 😆
“If mike here used his peer as a cologne instead of an energy drink”
If he had done more investigating with his knife in the sand he would have known something was off about the size. I am not a landmine expert by any stretch of the imagination but I am not sure there are ones that small around. Like wouldn't  it have a larger diameter?
Well to be quite frank I would have beaten this easy because I would have just given up and stepped off it
It's not mine its OURS COMMUNIST
thank you so much for uploading so often have a damm good day
You always make me have a damn good day when you post ❤️
mystery recapped
Can you imagine going through all that just to realize you were standing on a can lmao
Why is there so much blur am confused
Can you do maze runner scorch trials and death cure
It would seem you have trodden on a mine
I used to watch this movie all the time! Can’t wait for this video
so nobody's gonna comment on the fantastic valentine's day pun here?
0:18 “these soldiers”  Every Marine in a 200 mile radius: *Unadulterated Rage*
I enjoyed this movie tbh. I’m glad you covered it.
I thought this was an Valentine’s Day movie called”Be mine” get it 😪?
Yo you should do a video on World War Z
You said next video would be the next part of the all of us are dead vid but this is still a good video keep it up
I think that this is the most real-world information I’ve actually ever learned from one of this guys videos.
Loved this movie especially the song at the end about moving forward
The guy who help the soldier must be the biggest psycher in history he knew the soldier was on a dupe the whole time!!
**RETROACTIVE SPOILER WARNING IN EFFECT: PROCEED WITH CAUTION**  It is actually a relief to know that he was actually standing on a tin can rather than an actual mine. At first I thought it was a mine made specifically for the plot and make the rest of the field a veritable killzone
during the entire video i was questioning why the dude didnt remove the sand around the "mine" to see if it actually is one and not just something else he stepped on
we waited days for it to be a can
You CAN and most of the time are taught as I call it "dry jab" into the leg or muscles with morphine but the effects will take alot longer than USUAL to take effect. But I highly doubt anyone missing their legs is going to be able to find a vein without missing IF they even find one. Now if you have someone who ISNT STUCK ON A MINE he could find a vein for you. I'm an ex addict and haven't used a point myself but have met many that have and have heard a million stories. If I'm wrong here since I'm not in the service correct me please!
I’m surprised you haven’t covered Jeepers Creepers 2 when all the teenagers are on the school bus. I always wondered how I would survive that situation.
Am I insane or is replacing landmines with tin cans evil, Removing the landmines, thats amazing, very useful but by replacing them with something the may think is a landmine, you are setting people up for the worst scare of their lives
i want to see you direct a movie
I would have used the other guys body slowly press down on the mine with my hand as i slide my foot off then slide the guys body onto it since it was a can all along it would have worked.
I was just scrolling then I saw this video!  This is just a comment to this amazing guy who gives us extreme knowledge, has a sense of humor, and let's us watch movies for free! What a legend. Have a damn good day.
Me at the end: wow that was aweseome. Me at the end after a few seconds: Wait no sponsor?!
It's always a good day when Cinema Summary Uploads
New mr. Beats challenge 2022
Literally watched this movie years ago and the ending hurt my soul
The writing is so irritatingly dumb in this movie. It's really the only way this style of movie can work.
Wait a Sec i thought you were gonna do All of us Are Dead Part 2
Some mines do actually wait to detonate after pressure is applied
It's never great when a movie/TV show requires a lot of stupidity to keep the story moving. "We've trained for this for months and to dehumanize the enemy. Although, I'd feel bad if I ruined what might be the happiest day of his life." Sure...  Also, the military spends ridiculous amounts of money to send personnel out with the best equipment possible...except for these two guys, evidently.
11:08 I EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLY EXACTLY HAVE THAT SAME MODEL OF THE CASIO WATCH
W person W video
Anyone else binge watch this guy
🔥🔥
Please do how to beat Tremors
POGGERSS UWU :)
Can you do how to beat "Moonfall"?
Up!

You know if my guy just dug around the sand he would've found out it was a can
Life isn't hard, We make it hard.
"WHATS UP GAMERS, TODAY I SPENT 52 HOURS ON A LANDMINE AND IF I GET OFF EARY, I GET BLOWN UP, BUT IF I SURVIVE, MY FRIENDS GET BLOWN UP" -Mr Beast once he see's this movie
One thing I learned from this movie is that dont marry a dumb husband who hasn't had enough training.
It was a great video, but the ending part of the movie is missing what gives meaning all of it. I recommend everybody to watch this movie.
I just realize couldn't the soldier use his dead partner body?
i don't know shit about this shit but even i know to run in the opposite direction after seeing both the sign and my friend literally blowing up in my face
He could have saved himself from and his friend only if he said to his friend like :  Bruh, I am serious watch your step.
As a (mountainous) Moroccan, I'm terrified at the idea of being lost in the Sahara (few hundreds kilometers South from where I come from). It's in my country, but almost like a completely different continent. That's literally the worst part fot the world for survival
Fun getting your eyes Sandy
dude i love your videos
Can you do Slaxx?
I was hoping he was gonna do this movie so I will have a damn good day
How do you always find these movies? btw have a damn good day
Love ur video 🖤🤞🏾
“Sniper lets criminal live, instantly regrets it”
Use your friends dead body as a weight to keep the mine from going off. Put him on top of the boot, push him down, and pull your foot out of the boot while positioning yourself over the body as in case of detonation it will shield you
Ur the best!!!!
That is the worst Rick roll
The consistency with the uploads lately.
Here we have a very special episode where Cinema Summary does not advise us to use anyone as a meatshield. I'll be waiting for the super special episode where the MC is in a group and no one will be used as a meat shield.
So how I would beat mine I would start slowly trading my foot with my hand and put weight on the mine
"A scull and crossbones is the international symbol for GET THE FXCK OUT OF HERE" and I'm fr like RIGHT!!!!! 😂😂😂😂
24:00 Blackfooted Cat: Aww, it takes a whole pack? Aww!
Next up: "How to beat MARRIARE" > The man goes down on one knee to propose to his girlfriend, but that was his first mistake
haha funy military man
Can you make a video with movie Wall plz
"Mine your own business" Thank You
Me just thinking of the odds to step on a mine in the middle of the desert 🤔 Edit :😂
Love how the soldier was stepping on a can the whole movie
This man knows everything at this point lol. From surviving a war with high-school students (how to beat battle royal), to how to beat a demonic clown billions of years old(how to beat the demonic clown in it), to hostage situations (how to beat the nerds in the final) to how to survive a landmine (how to survive the deathtrap in mine)
Who is watching in 2022
awesome
the worst part is how the intro to this literally would not happen if the guy just closed his scope cover first
hey uh u the movie expert ? i entered in an abandoned mortuary and carved my name on the wall . when will i get hunted down by evil ghosts?
Yeah the word you say well I will replace the word of lemonade it gave me flashbacks of me not drinking tea in philippines I want now to drink tea
just saw a video about the movie, couldnt stream it anywhere now i can watch your how to beat thank you :)
His foot is wider than the tin can he was standing on. So you're telling me he didn't even try removing the sand around the "mine" or try feeling around his foot to be sure it was a mine.
How to beat mine: Never join the Military.
The way to survive:take a step off...
Bosnia simulator
That local guy was such an A-hole, he could've just told him that it's a tin can
Damn he never learn. He literally Trigger another landmine 😂😂
kinda early
Why is his lips so cracked
My guy is cinema sins 2.0
Just saying he would in a game with mr.beast because this man was their for time
The title schould be how to survive in Bosnia.
the spanish flag that you inserted its wrong thats the falangist flag and you should errase it to avoid problems, and good viedo
Getting married or not, if you're my target im pulling the trigger.  Also odd that the soldiers had zero clue about their surroundings or environments. Soldiers are always briefed on their environment and surroundings. Added to that snipers are often highly trained and skilled soldiers with high provision in survival, stealth and mental fortitude. They wouldnt be laughing off the idea of a mine field nor joking around about their situation after that whole debacle.
Imagine he came back from all of that to see he’s wife with another man :/
"kill this guy" "Ok" "how did you fail" "wedding"
Dig down
As a great man once said: "We do not train to be merciful here..."  Shoulda capped him the moment he locked on him
I’d love to see him do “we need to do something” on Netflix
Lmaoooo just because someone is getting married doesn’t mean they are good person 😂😂😂 No offence but writers should’ve make a better effort. Like make the guy save a puppy or feed a hungry street orphan.
I think we can all agree that cinema summary wouldn't survive 4 hours in a situation like this.....
Nice
I went to SERE school and I’m not gonna lie I don’t think they ever said anything about drinking your own urine.
Sup
I love your vids but WHERE DO YOU FIND OUT THESE MOVIES LIKE HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THIS MOVIE but still I love your vids BUT HOWWW again I love your vids BUT HOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Today I learned how to use my pee to assert Dominance.  Thank you Cinema Summary
this is the beggest bruh moment ive ever seen
I just spent 10 minutes finding the location of the position of the coordinates at the beginning and I gotta say props to actually doing a location in the desert 👍
I would literally just shoot myself in the head
lol
What a stupid ending 💀
i could have done this video in 30 seconds or less, because all he needed to do was walk off since mines explode instantly, not after you step off
he couldnt have used the rope to tie his shoe to the mine preventing it from going off?
Hey man,I know that you're probably not going to see my comment.  I want to say that I have been whatching your videos for over a year now. And you my guy are amazing. You have inspired me to not trust ANYBODY.
they have no silener i think
This man is the definition of plot armor
It’s Hollywood. The actors are meant to walk-in to their doom.
I think you'd like the original Hitcher movie, it's a tense thriller but it does leave plenty of room to analyze the mistakes made. :)
I have a question, would you be able to drink your own pee in a situation like this if you had one of those life straws that filters the water?
Can he just tie the land mine to his foot with his shoelace and walk to nearby villages with it? I know it's sounds stupid but still, if you manage to do it, it would 1000 times better that to standing there and he would have know it's not a land mine but a tin can, and also if I were him I would try to dig the land mine out if curiosity
I love the part when he said that the international symbol for a skull is GTFO
i'm going to have a glass of water now, just to flex on him
OMG U POSTED A VIDEO
https://youtu.be/LTLZ5LTix3Q
If that man wanted to get off that mine he should take off his shoe then follow the foot prints idk if this will work but it might
We really need to get this guy to 2 million we don’t give him enough credit
6 kilometers=hours of walking?  It takes like 45 minutes to walk 5 km honestly walking through sand might double the walking time  Maybe I misheard and you meant 60km though. Now that would be a long walk
I'd probably get ready to run really fucking fast and just hope the mine isn't big enough to kill me a couple yards away.
whoeven is making these thumbnails should get fired
Can you do Blood Red Sky
"Ticking time bomb of a bad marriage" Are you okay?
if i was him i would take the backpack an place it on the land mine an hope its heavy so i can save myself
umm not enter the place to not risk my life
Thank you for always coming through👏🏾😊
I don‘t speak american temperature measurement.
You’re my favorite :)
Lol, the local seemed to want to help so, why not just tell the Marine that he was standing on a harmless can from the beginning?
Hey! Those look like Marines not Soldiers. :) love this channel
30:36 "How would you beat Mine?"  I didn't know it was yours, sorry dude :)
When cinema summary sees a skull with cross bones his first thought is   Cinema summary: Oh f*** time for a meat shield
damn
Please make how to beat the rain from Netflix
They can’t attack a wedding it’s against international law
I like the episode
Salute to Mike
Well Shit!!!!
Fear is the mind-killer.  I actually realized when you said the man told him to free himself, is when I knew he wasn't on an active mine.
Best way to beat it was listen to the man like u say they talk every other language  he said in English keep moving forward he knows this area better then I so listen.....
Imagine to be in a situation like this in real life
this guy is motherfucking lucky guy if i were him  the rescue team would say like itwould take 1month or even i would see an arab guy would think i am an enemy and kill me. fuck im unlucky
Amazing, as always
I I stepped on a landmine I would just die
im sure this guy is secretly a war veteran
Have a damn good day
Im I the only one who imagine that I was in that situation but with a harsher difficulty, more enemy, extreme weather, crazy bad luck and somehow miraculesly survive?
I would beat mine by taking a step
"Shooting a wild dog you can see is much easier than one you can not" -Cinema Summary
*Steps on a landmine Voice in my head: "Ok, first of all..This is ALL your fault!"
"Soldiers dont behave this way-" are you kidding me? soldiers going day in and day out killing people and experiencing multiple casualties and violence across a country, they experience nothing short of strange behavior on a daily basis :/
Is it just me or his voice changed
They're not soldiers, they're Marines. Sure, its just a movie, and these are just actors, but the charecters portrayed are Marines. We dont go through all of the fuck shit, just to be called 'soldier'. Like motherfucker, each of us earned that goddamn title of United States Marine in bootcamp, where we effectively are less than human...we're recruits not marines. Recruits aren't afforded the privilege of personal pronouns or many other things civilians take for granted. You have to earn your privileges. You have to earn the privilege to wear your woodland cammies, to roll your sleeves, to blouse your boots, to go to the head (bathroom) when you want, and so say things like 'I, me, my, we, our', until you eventually earn your EGA. For some marines, its on a parade deck at parris island, for marines like myself, its on top a steep ass hill called the reaper. S Army trainees on the other hand....they have so many privileges compared to marine recruits that its not even funny. I once heard a trainee give his seargent attitude, and that shocked me. I got slammed into my footlocker in bootcamp cuz I scratched my itchy face real quick after shaving and a DI caught it outta the corner of his eye.
Well, that was a good Valentine's Day special.
This guy has a GOD LEVEL PLOT ARMOR
"highest success rate of any mammal on earth" 2'nd highest... humans are top predators
What I've learned from this video.. If you're stranded in the desert, pee is awesome.
How to beat Jurassic park 3 pls.
who hired these people 😭
HELLO
I alreayd watched this movie explained so no thanks
i watched this movie on netflix it was really good
Men: live Cinema summary: That was his first mistake.
Just don’t go.
"His water bladder is empty" WHO THE SHIT ARRANGED THIS MISSION? No evac strategy No water bladder No working GPS I'm surprised they remembered to give him bullets
he could have used the dead body of his spotter to put weight on the mine. good old indianer jones swap move.
Question when is part 2 of all of us are coming
When you need "suspension of disbelief" on a suspension of disbelief, just to understand a movie.
The ending of the movie made me mad because of what was actually under him
The least realistic thing about this is HOW they planned to kill the “insurgent”. In reality, America would have drone-struck and killed everybody declaring them all (including any children attending the wedding) “terrorists”.
25:43 what show is this
I watched this movie, and it’s actually really good!
welp, thank god i didnt waste my time on this horrible movie?
This movie was absolutely amazing. Truely this movie showed one of the most dangerous enviroment to survive in and how powerful your mind can be with you, or against you. The whole time he's on a false mine filled with a toy soldier😭
"Good soldiers follow orders"
The guy in the thumbnail need some lip gloss or chapstick 🤧
Man I would have killed my self out of disappointment, after figuring out it wasn't a land mine and I struggled for no reason... 😂😂
Did u see that nope trailer?
If you step on mine you are blowing .
MAN I WOULD BE HEATED IF I JUST WENT THROUGH ALL THAT JUST FOR THERE TO BE NOTHIN
This one's like mrbeast videos...just a bit darker😎
Literally Cinema Summary's phrase is "But that was his biggest mistake." Like how many biggest mistakes does he have???
Deatj games are better
When he pulls out his knife and sees how far down the mine is, I would have cleared out the sand around my foot just to see the situation better
Hi
Couldn’t the sniper have used the weight of his spotter’s corpse? Like, prop it on top of his boot and carefully remove his foot?
Can you watch a documentary of video on the guy who ran through the Sahara?
how does he only have 1 million? i would give him at least 10 million
I like your videos 。:)
Guys I’m crying rn. Everyone took all the good comments!
all he needed to do was drag his friends body over to his landmind then trade weights witht he body and he would be free
now im perfectly prepared for my next sniper mission in the deserts of savannah, thanks Cinema Summary φ(゜▽゜*)♪
Now we need craft
E
At the beginning I had a feeling it wasn’t a mine
"The Army has a training manual"  Too bad he isn't in the Army.
Can you do how to beat final destination 5
These soldiers don't feel like actual soldiers, first, the sniper spares the target's life because he's at a wedding, next, the spotter laughs off a landmine warning? On top of that, this guy watches his friend get dropped by a landmine and he goes towards the landmines to go check. Even normal people aren't this dumb.
This movie is so stupid because this is not in anyway how a soldier would act
1 hour late
can u do "how to beat enemy at the gates "
This movie was great
Id take the land mine over the marriage any day.
BRUHHH That plot twist was both hilarious and depressing!
Skull and bones are an international sign to GTFO. thats just epic
Evil Cinema Summary be like:  Have a damn **not** good day.
The smart thing is to kill your target, but how heartless do you have to be to kill the priest at an innocent persons wedding.
Now im thursty🤣
My guy what took you so long
Thats ending tho 😂😂😂
Can you do another Werewolf Game!
Ahh yoo he's voice is so soothing and I love his videos  Please try to upload more and more interesting movie summary WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF UR TRAPPED... Love to hear this line
what about all of us are dead?
"Imagine stepping on something and only to realize it's not a bomb it's a can!, hilarious..." - someone probably
love this type of content
me : drinks water cinema summary : that was his first mistake
the fact it is a dud was so funny I would have been livid.
Oh
These videos are always entertaining and I appreciate you for working hard on these videos, keep up the good work 👍
Very Nice  And have ar Dam god day
‘Trading in a landmine for a ticking time bomb of a marriage’ every former and active military member felt that
Ok fuck that villager guy. He could have done so much more to help the soldier.
damn. the main character is real "smart" in this movie.
And then his girfriend declines the marriage proposal 😂😂😂😂
Oh I've actually seen this movie before, that's cool.
Couldn’t he have used his dead friend as a shield jumping off the mine backwards bc he knows that is safe
So much "Just follow Soldier standards."
FINALY A MOVIE THAT I KNOW
Is this a reup load or did I see it in spooky rice’s page
No, it's actually mine
If I stepped on a landmine, I'd just scream 'FUCK' and probably die two seconds later
can you to an indian movie plez
I cannot express how much I love this channel
please say hi to me
if he's killed the dogs, he could also drink their blood to get some moisture
Now this is how i watch free movies🍿
He can legit put the sniper under his leg and the rest of the stuff under the other leg will make the landmine not explode cause its still feels something on top of it
Have a damn good day merch when
my first thought would be to check the landmine and attach something to it to keep it weighed down, and if you did check it you would’ve noticed it
and that proposal was his biggest mistake...
Have a damn good day
if the land mine only explodes when being untouched after being touch there are 2 super simple ways to do it 1 kneel down press the button hold it find some heavy objects and place it on top of it make sure its balance well  2 if you don't have heavy objects just kneel down again and dig it with hands but slowly to make sure it wont explode and if you see that it is a land mine then you have to hold it but if not well get the heck out of there its rly that simple tbh
bruh i hate how when i watch you and mystery recapped i always see almsot the same movies i already watched this idk how its how to beat he was stepping on a can all along
tbh this is just a sad one...
This might be the most hardest death yet but Cinema Summary knows how to survive.
"how would you beat mine?"
How do I beat the mine? Give up and  alt+f4 myself.
Ok
The can is the biggest troll in the world 💀
This man is teaching us all for the future and giving us great life lessons, and I know it’s all in the movies but if I ever come to a position like this then I know who to trust
Remember this movie and it was so messed up at the end
Lmao, i knew it wasn't a landmine, its legit obvious, it became even more obvious whn the man said they replaced landmines with tin cans.
"Damn, it's a [insert dangerous animal]"  "pulls out dick and starts to pee"
Imagine having the final scene of the proposal where he drops on his knee but it is just a hallucination and he wakes up on the mine again
Isnt the sniper spotter juice from sons of anarchy
btw they’re marines
No you
14:40 — Follow him!
The protagonist: *Breathes*  Cinema summary: *as YOU can SEE here this guy is making a HUGE mistake*
.
Ok
That marriage is arab I watched the movie and I heard the arab voices
"These soldiers"  Screams in Marine.
Pretty much had the same reaction as the guy when I saw the mine was a can, but damn you can sense the lesson from that.
The shade at the end hah!
first of all the western sahara is a Moroccan land and the reason of the conflict is that france didn't precise the borders when Morocco got the independency  plus the people there are fund by algerian who only want conflict because Morocco is a better country and even the leader of the polisario is unintellectual who escaped to spain because he was just a doll for the war
i watched it be for
Just imagining Cinema Summary ruining a wedding for his own survival 🤣
already seen it good movie
You could just use the wild dogs too weigh down the mine
You and Nerd Explains have really helped with my survival, thx lads
sorry but i would never kill someone in a wedding its a cold blooded move
More like wtf were they even doing there? Moroccan soldiers themselves remain behind their wall let alone allied troops.
Tin can go brrrrrr
If i was this dude i woud dig the sadn under newth me and put something heavy in the land mine
how to beat the death trap in "Mine": don't join the army
I'm not trying to be rude but can you upload more thank you
Some landmines have a delay but if you apply to long pressure on them they also explode. Also they are most likely Soviet style and they have the tendency to be very unpredictable and can even go of on their own, if they are left in the ground for long.
Kilo Two Bravo is a movie with a similar premise but it's based on a real event that happened to a British squad. It's a great movie.
Please upload more!
It's about mine i'ts about ore
Yo I'm in within an hour
id simply get lucky and not step on a mine
y cant mike put his friend on the mine when he was next to him so then he can be free and follow the guys foot steps that took his water thing
When a local gets close enough to touch you there is a big chance that you aren't on a mine
DUDE YOU PUT THE FASCISY VERSION OF THE  SPANNISH FLAG 😳
Dam dis shit buuuiuu
Imagine how it would have go if the man just said dude your stepping on a can
That guy could've told him at any point, that wasn't a mine...What an asshole
Man the moment i ran out of water i wouldve tried to jump away with hope lmao, but i 100% would’ve been left the mine when the black man stood just inches from a “mine” that could blow up… no one who’s native to a area like this would take such a risk just to flex some wisdom, it’d literally be the opposite of wise actually
If I stepped on a mine, I would just cry as I would just die. Have a damn good day love your content and humor
Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and repent you shall be saved give it a try I mean accepting Jesus is a great thing cause if you do your safe from hell you might think hell isn't real but it is and heaven isn't boring ppl think heaven is boring but in fact, you can fly in heaven accept Jesus as your Lord and savior repent and always remember God does Love you
Always the best when you get this notification

CINEMA SUMMARY WITH ANOTHER BANGER
I like when he drops these videos
I was JUST looking on your channel for stuff to rewatch and then I see you’ve uploaded!!! ❤️
I would take the mans advice  alot earlier
Or you could use your both shoes's ties and just tight the mine into your leg with knots,this way he could've discovered that it wasn't a mine too
im kinda early
Hehehe
Easiest way to avoid this: don't be a part of the millitary
why doesn't he remove the shoe and keep pressure withe his hand add sand in the shoe and make a weight of his shoe
Early
always love when Cinema Summary uploads. have a damn good day y’all <33
LETS GOOO HE DROPPED
Fun Fact nobody finished the video while I’m typing thid
I’m so glad I’m here early so I can listen while I sleep

This dude always adds humer to all his vids,what a chad
Stop saying soldier these are MARINES!!!!!!!!!!! Soldier is ARMY jesus christ i swear I See why I always stuck to Nerds Explain channel 😕
Great video ! but at 14:43 that spanish flag is from when spain was under a dictatorship by Francisco Franco, not the actual one
Can you make a video on example one of  the scream  movies IT 2 or the stranger things series
Me: TIME FOR MORE KILLINGS
That spanish flag tho...
I quite liked this movie
Lets be real they really wont survive as they would still die after 70 years cuz of old age
Do boss level
ayo, i have the exact same watch, yeah it has a map and automatic time zones. WOAH
oo im early WAIT i know this movie
14:43 damn, that spanish flag with the eagle on it... might wanna change it
bro is posting bangers every week!
You've done so many death trap videos you've stumbled upon the most simple and realistic death trap yet, a fricken landmine.
I would think the soldiers should already know techniques to try to survive a landmine.
When Cinema Summary uploads out of nowhere, you’re already having a DAMN good day.
Sick
*Boom.*
i never been this early
This movie reminds me of the hurt locker
5:17 isn't this operation in Afghanistan? why would they be in western sahara the us can't intervene, unless he's a secret ops special forces guy which he doesnt appear to be
I literally just watched this

Hmm
If you wanna survive any traps from the "Mine", then you always prepare the Creative Mode whenever you need.
I guess you can say he had an explosive experience
Mines and Mines only
The mofos really didn't have an extraction plan for after they shot the guy or the GPS coordinates of where they were going to written down/memorized lmfao. Who wrote this
👏😍
It realy is refreshing to watch your video after 3 hrs of online classes.
Are you going to a video on the jig saw series or was that just a joke
Time Traveler: *kicks a rock* The timeline:  Sniper: *shoots the target* *End Credits*

I’m a massive fan of your channel, saw this movie recently and I think you should cover it  https://youtu.be/aruD-QYpHMo
My favorite thing about these videos is when at the end he says "How would you beat..?" I wouldn't. I would die. End of story.
Feel good to be early 😊
The best thing about the day is watching you😁
Im always down to watch your videos 😊

Damn,loose ends on veteran "desert edition" looks fire
Who all love movies with death traps?
Netflix should hire u to make these videos of there own movies I can already say that this will be hit
Why couldn't he just remove his shoe while his other foot keeps weigh on the mine and use his heavy ass kevlar or ceramic armor plate to weigh down the landmine?
belive kids
