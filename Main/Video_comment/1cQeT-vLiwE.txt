Hey, shut up I know I have said this in the past, but this is the freaking best pitch meeting I have seen!! So many great jokes, the most recent catch phrase, and It even had a minimovie about Producer Guy, with hero journey and all!
*_Producer Guy, Mr. Krabs & Mr. Drysdale should've attended that therapy session together!!_* 😁🏆
Anybody know what the music track is at 2:15?
I had to quit watching because the dollar sign storyline was totally boring and it seemed it was going to be the entire video.
My creed is Higher
1:21 Therapist: “And this witness, you trust their ability to see?” Producer: “I mean he has glasses” Therapist: “Huh”
That's MR producers guy to you...
Oh yeah, this is The Mandalorian Season 1 and SEASON 2 Pitch Meeting
Am I dying?     I DON'T KNOW!
I love Ryan's depiction of therapists!
Funny video! I kinda get the feeling that the merchandising opportunity dollar eyes arc is a roundabout way of saying “The Mandalorian is a good show.”
"Why couldn't you have just used the toilet? Why did you have to go in my trash can! Now it's all moldy and it looks like it's starting to grow goo!" "Wait, say that again."
"You like money? I like money too. We should hang out."
Funniest episode
Someone get that phone
Man-dough 😂
actually I killed IG-88 in shadows of the empire
Man dough love handles 😂😂😂😂
This gets better every year. Early on it felt a little stilted and slow. But he gets faster, funnier and more quippier if that's a word, each time.
Half the episodes were decent and the other half not so.  Things got to political and I gave up after the second season.
Okay so in the show's defense, I think the part where they had to scan their face was about how the Empire is super racist and human-supremacist, has, like, NO aliens and doesn't like cyborgs (Vader being the exception), they had to confirm they were human. Maybe.
can you do ASH? That movie sucked
x8
Why am I kinda proud of an allegory for corrupt executives everywhere help
Man dough 😂😂😂😂
With arms wide open! That killed me!!
Screenwriter Guy and Producer Guy. Are those Guys related?
1:05 Therapy sessions at the public library are a beautiful melding of mental healthcare and performance art.
I was expecting the doctor to give a diagnosis and then getting dollar signs in his own eyes 😅
Using my garbage can as a bathroom is tight! 😂😂
When were we supposed to find out that Boba Fett survived Return of the Jedi?  Seems like that just got glossed over here. I was expecting a callback when Luke came to save them.  "You mean this whole thing takes place after Return of the Jedi, the movie where we killed Boba Fett".  "Oh Yeah." "Whoops" "Whoopsie"
"Bostonian" does sound like it would be an MIB alien
It's easy to satirize the bad movies and tv shows, but quite skillful to find the humor in good entertainment. Well done.
bruh you criticise velma for being meta-self aware and not actually funny. not without reason but you just did that with the dollar sign skit and it was painfully long
Lmao his name is producer guy?
I just realized this. The moderator in the therapy group is the creepy guy from the company that names things!
With Arms Wide Open
Having not yet seen this show, but having had played the original Star Wars: Dark Forces video game, I was very surprised to see the dark troopers show up! Those looked like the second generation model, if I'm not mistaken? Maybe third? I can't quite remember.
Side quests and baby sitting is why I couldn't finish the first season
Ah, a world where all the men have the same facial hair. The best selling rock group would probably be  ZZ Top
JFC, that creed reference was incredible.
Swiss Army Man!!!
"Hi, my name is Producer Guy" lmao
5:15 - Thats my Creed! Haha 🤟 its super relevant, barely an unrelatedveniance!
did that side quest include him going to A.A. (animations anonymous)
Did I miss something or was Gina Carranos character not mentioned at all in this? I’ve watched this a dozen times and just noticed that. Thats weird.
00:30🤑
"He's from all of it!" lol
Totally forgot it was a Pitch Meeting for a sec.  Awesome
the way is a direct lift from the new testament. star wars is all about rreligion, or at least it was
Such a great show with the star wars spirit.....bad ass stunts as well
"He's from all of it!" 🤣
I like the way American Dad did this $ eyes to Roger, this was funny af as well.
Ryan is the coolest best guy ik on yt much love to my brother❤
Was it ever possible for Producer Guy to choose a different career?  Did he have to become a producer or was there a time in his life he could have become an electrician or plumber or did his name doom him to become a producer?
The "creed singing" almost made me choke on food 😂
I’ve been standing here for 3 days waiting for you to come back   Amazing
Love the producer guy side mission
Wait.. a baby.. Yoda?!🤑🤑
Cant wait for this revisit when mandalorian movie comes out. What was going on with the producer guy life section
No comment that 'Baby' Yoda is 50 years old?!
Bill Burr was surprisingly great. I wish he had more screen time and a bigger role.
“He’s a Bostonian”  “Oah I love science fiction”🤣🤣
Ahsoka is originally from Star Wars The Clone Wars not Star Wars Rebels, you absolute moron!! (Love you)
"A Bostonian"
Ah yes the before times, before K Kennedy filled every role with "put a chick in it and make it lame and ghey!"😂
He was even tight with screenwriter shitting in his garbage can. Thats some character growth.
IT'S ABOUT TIME SCREEN RANT GAVE MY BOY A MASSIVE, MASSIVE RAISE Edit: more genius writing in this one pitch meeting than the movies covered.
This is an instant classic.
“Thou shalt get side tracked by bullshit every time”
Bill Burr as the Bostonian 😂😂😂
Going into a Creed song is TIGHT!
Please bring back Doctor guy, therapist guy and the guys from the supportgroup back. they are hillarious.
The pitch meeting could have ended with Producer Guy simply realising he loves money and ending it there since there really wasn't any other point or reason for this series.
Surprised weirdo dude is that supportive in the group
Man some nice character development for producer guy😊
well this show had 2/3 of one good season lol
Do guys still say "Awoogah!" when catcalling anymore?! 😆That was totally unexpected.
Breed meeting guy, pitch me.
OMFG…. DUDE… YOU ARE THEE MAN! 👊🏻 🤣🤣
How difficult is it going to be to cast for the support meeting in this vid-e-o? Super easy, barely in inconvenience..
For the record, I did always think it was kind of odd that Din Djarin could access the enemy information with a scan of his face... I truly thought we were going to get a subplot of Din having worked for the Imperial bad guys in the past... Because how would the computer have recognized his face?
“So how come this mandalorian can’t show his face but all of the previous mandalorians in Star Wars can?” “Well, you see, we’ve hired Pedro Pascal but he’s going to be very busy for the next few years.”
Aw but the cool body realistic wrestler lady, she was the best part
fucking lmao the medical sidetracking was amazing
yeyeye
This episode is hilarious. I can't even....
I never realized that Disney is pushing for and promoting AI for some reason. What are they upto?? 👀👀
The Dead Milkmen did this song "Dollar Signs in Her Eyes" (https://youtu.be/bGFLc6b7qeM?si=5JOZoCyJDZLU8nEF)
This may be Ryan's best work.
Executive Producer Guy has awaken the Eternal Dollaringan.
This video is peak ⛰️ “Pitch Meeting”. 🔥
I love how nobody questions that his name is actually producer guy
I was expecting Producer Guy to be like "His name is also his bounty hunter title?" Or something like that. Since Boba and Jango Fett are also Mandolorian but have actual names
Probably the best side bit out of the pitch meetings
That whole skit at the beginning kinda dragged... Like alot... To the point it became cringe
Yay he like creed
WITH ARMS WIDE OPENNN thats my creed 😎
Why does Therapist Guy kinda look like Sam Reich?
These guys remind me of The Pals
Funniest thing on 🌎...I had 2 laugh sooo hard😂 Greetings from Germany 🇩🇪 ☮️
"It's ok to fully put your faith in Artificial Intelligence"  Prescient
He's a Bostonian...lol
It would've been nice if season 1 and 2 could be separate videos
This man was ahead of the curve with the creed resurgence
This one is already a bit older - but damn it's great!
Couldn’t attempt to even watch the Mando show. Just a boring premise.
Accepting cream as payment is tight.  Oh my god. I don't like how that sounded but that's the way.
I want to see a pitch meeting for a Ryanverse franchise.
They should randomly bring back Dark Sinious like they did in the last starwars movie, saves writing a new character am i right yall 🤘
Ryan George is a TNG fan.    If you don't understand the above statement you are not a TNG fan.
I was waiting for him to say "It happened when someone mentioned 'Baby Yoda'" and then have everyone else in the group see his eyes become dollar signs. 🤣🤣
The Creed joke killed me
I give the props to Disney to not have a Grogu cameo on Ahsoka, i guess the complaining on Mandaboba Fettlorian worked
Give us A Day in the Life of Producer Guy, I need to know what he does in his non office routine
Dark Troopers...  Toasters?  Cylons?
cant believe you stole the $ eye thing from AMERICAN DAD
Ahsoka pitch meeting?  My favorite part so far: - Ahsoka hides in the forest from their pursuers. Standard jedi protocol is to shut down engine and droids. This way no one can detect energy signatures. - So they can't detect life signs? Or composite alloys which a spaceship is made of?
With arms wide open....🤣🤣🤣
What was that lmao
Am I dead I don’t know
Hollywood needs to pump out more bad content ASAP so we get more pitch meetings xD
That was hilarious, thank you.
Lucifer pitch meeting different for ever season
Do you think someone has pitch meetings for the pitch meetings and then pitch meetings for those pitch meetings and so on
Honestly the dollar signs in the eyes moment is my favorite pitch meeting moment of all time. I always crack up when I see it!
"not relevant to what I was talking about" I feel SEEN
That Creed joke got me
"So, you have a new Pitch Meeting for me?", "Yes sir, I do", "YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY............"
Kind of carry away with the dollar’s eyes joke
That's my Creed. LMAO!
And then they didn't make dolls LoL
- "What kind of creature is he?" -"He's a... bostonian?" -"Ow, I love science fiction" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This whole thing is let's make baby yoda something to make money
New lore confirmed: his actual name is 'producer guy'
that eye joke was from american dad
brilliant again
So... you can cost the company millions by totally mishandling the merch and nothing happens, but one tweet deliberately taken entirely out of context will get you fired, simply because you won't actively push The Message?   #Justice4Gina
Producer guy had a beautiful character arc. We just need an origin story where his hands feel his first paycheck 😌
I shouldn’t have watched this stoned the multiple conversations with multiple versions of himself fucked me up
The line “he’s from all of it” will never not be funny to me
Why does Group Meeting Guy remind me of Brendan Shcaub?
man dough :[
Omg. Now I know why anything unusual happens to me when I see people.
The funniest is anytime money is mentioned lol
Mando is short for Mandalorian not Mandolorian.
We appreciate you're sacrifice producer guy
"He's a Bostonian." Good man, Burr.
Now that season three is over and it sucked, it’s obvious the executives took control away from Favreau. Probably because it cost them money to not have the Yoda toys ready.
Yo where Louie?🐶🫶
Can you take me higher?
I love this series not just only bcuz gruko mado characters but also the world fighting scenes💪👍 looking for more,
"My name is Producer Guy......."
Now that I think about it, apparently, in the Ryanverse parents name their kids the same as the job they will get 20 or 30 years later. Btw, Producer Guy is an excellent choice !
Anime jabs 😅
Mando
I’m excited for the season 3 pitch meeting! They made some mistakes in the screenwriting, curious to see what Ryan does with it.
Yeah, they really had your numbers with that baby yoda shit.
Oh my god, I love you for razzing on AI being forced into the world. <3
0:29
Rewatching this and the side journey is HILARIOUS 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ok so Mayfeld is not a bostonian. He's a billy gingertitsite. It's so obvious!
That intro is not what I expected 😂🤣
just lul
What the F**k?! Weird Pervy Guy is the group therapist?!
Wait.  Is the mandilorian not bobafet?
Screenwriter Guy: "Everyone's gonna call him 'Mando',' which is short for Mandalorian!"  Producer Guy: "Wouldn't it be 'Manda,' then?" SG: "No, because then everyone would think his name was 'Amanda,' and that would open up a whole big can of worms that corporate won't allow us to acknowledge exists!" PG: "Wowwowwow. Wow."
Loving money is tight
I've gotten pretty good at guessing what the "_____ is tight" joke would refer to, but I've got to say this one took me by surprise.
100% Want to see one for The Expanse. I saw her break out of the box she was in in the first few seconds of the show and thought "super easy, barely an inconvenience!".
Hello Ryan, If you revisit this someday mabe you use this as  well -  on what Star Wars planet is the owl native to? Is it Mandalore? Or maybe Concordia? I feel that the Night Owls is a piece of lazy writing -”...so they fly and are good hunters - I know lets call them Night Owls - job done. NEEEXT - what should we call the creature that is part of the Mandalore creation MYHT - hmmm -  myth...osaur done - I am on a roll today...”
Baby Yoda cash grab before Disney could was hilarious!!! T-shirts, socks, back packs. All made in chynah!! Then Disney started making their toys. $59.99 for a damn mandalorian lego head!! Fvck you Disney!!
eyes shooting out and jaw dropping and making weird sounds when a pretty woman passess by is actually clear cut harassment and actionable in court.
Yeah, really missed the boat on the Baby Yoda merch.
Anything with the giant bug eyes thumbnail = downvote
After watching the first episode, I have no intention of watching any more.  Not a fan.  My biggest gripe is the shoddy writing.  For someone who is supposed to be silent and mysterious (or so I thought), he sure talked a lot.  That's what made Boba Fett cool.  Star Wars was over as soon as the sequel trilogy started putting out movies.  Rogue One was alright, but that's about it.  I'm done with the franchise.
The best pitch meeting ever !!!
5:10 Ironically, “With Arms Wide Open” by Creed is a song about embracing fatherhood and sacrificing for your child, so it kind of is relevant to what he’s talking about.
Hes from all of it that was hilarious 😂😂😂😂 amazing pitch meeting Ryan
pls pls pls do Alice in wonderland with Johnny Depp!!!!
More of these
Oh my god that Creed reference was TIGHT! 😂
See when I saw a cute puppymy eyes began to spin in and out of head and my pupils turned into hearts. But I now realize that that’s okay.
Doctor, Shrink, Group therapy... damn Producer Guy
Producer Guy singing, "With arms wide open" Unassuming Me - laughs so hard I spit out my lunch.  I need to stop watching these videos during my lunch break.
Man, that random insert of "with arms wide open" was PERFECT!
Episodic adventures is an unimpressive format. They might as well just remade Xena
Plot twist: Moff Gideon is actually a drug dealer from Breaking Bad.
this Pitch Meeting had to make up its own story because The Mandalorian did not provide enough to talk about
3:59 it’s x15
"But...but...money!"
The producer's character arch in this episode is incredible.
I come here every now and then just for the creed joke
Character development?    Kinda.
0:29
Producer guy had a bigger story arc in this than the Mandalorian has in 2 seasons.
You should do one on Andor
fantastic
"Barely an inconvenience" makes for a great superhero catch phrase.
but where's the ad-stronaut
Only this channel and space ice channel can give me a severe pain in the throat from laughter
Ha eagleheart
We’ve got Grogu shirts, hats, toys, calendars, plates, mugs, blankets, stickers, and plushies.  Our son being born just before the show came out made Disney lots of 👀$$.
This is actually why I can't stand the Mandalorian now. I wanted to see a nice action series involving the lore-rich Mandalorians and instead all I got was some stupid puppet. Seriously they could make a show called "Baby Yoda's Day Off" and have it just be 30 mintues of nothing but the damn big-eared frog puppet stacking baby toys and sitting in a @#$%ing chair staring directly at the camera while occasionally having a force technique and it would sell out. The damn puppet gets more screentime than the actual Mandalorian and it drives me up a wall. So much for having this be Star Wars: Bounty Hunter (the series). I'm still mad. I'll DIE mad.
WAIT BILL BURR???
Great Creed reference
The only thing remaining is Ryan to do ANDOR
Cant believe I missed this one, 7 months later and this is my Favorite pitch meeting! The producer tangent as the ploy for Disney's money grubbing was an awesome allegory. Really cool to see something different and you exploring different types of content.
The AI joke. So good
Obviously they went a bit overboard with the side quests but…can we agree that The Mandalorian wiped the floor with both the prequels and the sequels in terms of dialogue, plot consistency, and character development? Oh yeah, and DIALOGUE
Man-dough!
Wait, doesn't the scene with Luke makes Yoda grow something like 400 years in less than a few bunches? it makes NO sense!
make more
unexpected Creed references are tight!
The therapist having a fake mustache over the real one XD
producer guy its okay getting you back to normal will be super easy barely an inconvience
Waffle house has found it's new host
Wow 😂
The money-making potential was so overwhelming for producer guy… 😂
"with arms wide open"  What? That is my Creed.
I have watched almost  every pitch meeting multiple times and I can guarantee that this is the best one yet 🤣
Oh oops I didn't realise this would spoil season 2
do Andor!
Please do Pixels and Encanto
Despite the RELENTLESS merchandise whoring of the baby Yoda (Grogan), The Mandolorian was good. I'd say it's the ONLY good Star Wars show of the past 20 years.
He had to prove he wasn't a robot..they put a Captcha in a Star Wars Show Episode
Comedy Gold 😂...Stop, Stop, My Sides are Hurting 🤣😂🤣... I've seen that cartoon back in the day about reacting to a hottie walking by and in The Mask with Jim Carrey
Mayfeld is Bostonian 😂
ghostland pitch meeting
The creed joke sent me
This is still my most favorite pitch meetings. It’s so genius
its awesome how half the video is just a completely different thing, based on all cartoon made in 50-90's
"He's aaa....Bostonian" did it for me, cause Bill Burr...and stuff :)
Since you asked, would you consider doing pitch meetings for Golden Hollywood era movies? Consider how much money was used for Cleopatra, and then everything was destroyed so nobody else could steal the expensive background, or “It’s a Wonderful Life” being about thieving corrupt banker, suicide, bullying, being deaf, and failed miserably in the box office for being so long and boring evidently.
I wanted to watch that but since I haven't seen this bullshit show it stopped making sense in about 2/3 of it...
I loved that Creed reference <3
Good to know. Another ignore list from Disney.
Too bad more people at Disney liked money and not losing money on every show.
“Am i dying” Goofily says “i dont know”
When are we getting the Bad Boys series
I'm sure you don't need to hear it, but I need to say it: your brand of comedy and execution of it are GENIUS. Sorry for yelling.
Since the start of pitch meetings  I've wanted a pitch for the Underworld  franchise.  I think it went from a great first 3 movies and then went G.O.T for the last 2 movies.
They must be doing really well in order to afford all the actors for this episode. Either that, or Producer Guy cracked open his huge wallet and covered the expense.
_I love Baby Yoda_
Bill Burr for the win!
is this the first pitch meeting with cutscenes? keeps getting better and better
Instead of sharingan he awakened dollar sign.
Do a pitch meeting for DUNE!
"Mando huh that's what I call my love handles" Not even 10 seconds in!!!!
Oh my god there are new characters
You should do a pitch meeting on knight and day Move!
Yeah but they didn't see the dollar signs. That season was over before they could get any real Grogu merchandise on the shelf. It has nothing to do with enhancing the experience, they simply rolled a 1 on marketing.  It was some of the worst merchandising I've ever seen from Disney.
0:29
0:27
Screenwriter guy and producer guy can see the future. The AI mention several months before the She Hulk AI moment 🤨
The three days of the dollar sign skit was the best thing thing ever on pitch meeting!
Bostonian 🤣 I want Bill Burr (Mayfield) to have his own spin off show.  first episode should be him on imperial broadcast rallying up the troops.
Bostonian 😂 For a second I was like "Wait, no he's human" lol
Do Gremlins
princess bride. do that
Hey. Great stuff here. Do "Nobody."
4:22 “stormtroopers who don’t know how to aim”  Aah yes the floor is made out of floor
5:14 best joke EVER
These days if the movie isn’t based off of a book you’re pretty much guaranteed to have an awful plot it seems.
There was more character growth here for Producer Guy than in most of the recent Star Wars movies lol
This one.  This is the best one.  Maybe they do a Rick & Morty one that lasts 19 hours and that'll be better, but until then....
RYAN, WHERE ARE THE EYE-MOVEMENT ANONYMOUS MEETINGS AT ???
I love the character development.
One of the funniest ones
Funny thing is, Disney dropped the ball on Baby Yoda merchandise.  They didn't think it would be a big seller, so for all of season one, they hadn't manufactured anything.
WITH ARMS WIDE OPEEEEN
Curve ball for ya: Do a pitch meeting for Suspiria.
I like psychologist guy
I love the “He’s from all of it” 😂
Such a hilarious episode. Loved the skit with the money signs in the eyes haha
the cash eyes bit was stupid.  too long. why is this part of the pitch? dumb
Baby yoda whit even bigger eyes is  tight
With Arms wide opuhn!
With arms wide open!!!
Barbly an inconbeanence
Any other Ebay sellers get excited for a second?
7:23  Bruh.
Producer guy- Am I dying? Screenwriter guy- I don’t know.
I was laughing through the whole Producer Guy sidequest.
HOCUS POCUS.  The original.  Pleeeeease! ❤
The amount of times I’ve rewatched this for that damn therapy skit is unreal!
Andor is so much better than Mandalorian.
Can we see a geostorm pitch meeting?
I like that the screenwriter guy said "garbage can" and producer guy said "bin".  Helps with the illusion that it's two different people
Can confirm, I own many many Baby Yoda things 🤣
I laughed SO hard at that Creed joke.
With arms wide open! 😂😂😂
Waited to watch this until I was finally caught up on The Mandalorian, and boy was it worth the wait; I finally feel like I *understand* Producer Guy's motivations.
Who's talking & making noise in the background....?
Half man, half delorean
That's not possible, medically..  That sums up basically everything about science fiction and Disney, or movies in general for that matter
*when i see a pretty man.   dude we all know and it’s ok. 🤣
Love the random Creed song thrown in there!
Was that a Mandalorian playing in the back!
Gus Fring secretly had jedi powers ? Somehow not surprised..🤔
The producer reaction to a Baby Yoda merch opportunity was probably exactly how it went down
I felt like I am the only one who listened to Creed. :D Had a good laugh.
This Episode had better Character Development than Star Wars Episode 7, 8 and 9
:D
at Time= 5:43   Pitch Guy seems to be talking about MANGO !!   ( a new lighter, and more tropical Mercenary )
I relate to the machine that checked if Mando had a face.  I once worked as a security guard at a facility where protocol required me to see the drivers licence of people coming in.  We didn't check them against a list or to make sure that they had any reason for being there.  So everyday I'd be like "you have a face and can drive a car, welcome"
Top Gun and Top Gun Maverick, please
LOL...Oh man, that sardonic,  5:41  "Nothing to worry about there sir"... Such nuance!... Great writing!
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ BAD BOY BUBBY…….BAD BOY BUBBY………BAD BOY BUBBY……..BAD BOY BUBBY………BAD BOY BUBBY……….BAD BOY BUBBY………..BAD BOY BUBBY………..
"it's ok to totally put your faith into artificial intelligence." "Our Disney Plus algorithm has been suggesting we start pushing that kind of messaging. Kind aggressively now that I think about it." "Nothing to worry about there, sir." As an AI programmer, this both entertains me and scares me at the same time!
You have a lot of different color sports jackets.
🤓🤑
The doctor and therapist portions of this are too real 😂👌
I would rather just watch you wave your thumb around than watch the trash that spews forth from Hollywood.
This Pitch Meeting Was TIGHT ..
Glad to see Mr. Ipkiss in the group therapy, dealing with the inevitable PTSD
This episode was lacking compared to the others. Hard to make fun of a solid show, you got spend 4 minutes talking about money
🎶WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN!!🎶🤣
seriously though, they had nothing prepared for Christmas of that year. Like Seriously BABY YODA!!
5:17 "With arms wide  open..!" That floored me instantly, dinb't expect it at all. 😂😂😂
That creed joke was on point
When "Cha Ching!!" echos thru your soul.
Ryan should make a pitch meeting about this pitch meeting
this was hilarious. the way you milked the joke was almost at the same level as Disney likes to milk baby Yoda merchandise
Ahsoka is from clone wars originally ❤
Bellissimo, sir. Just divine.
Producer Guy is so misunderstood.
i had enough of baby yoda after a couple of episodes it was cring seeing him after that
Creed references are tight!
He's a... Bostonian 😄😄 Accurate description of Bill Burr
The whole journey to self-discovery was actually just a setup for an "I forgot the story I wrote" joke. Dude writes the way Norm Macdonald talks.
Could you do a pitch meeting for the movie "jumper"? There is plenty of funny plot holes in there.
Ryanverse support groups are tight!
"He's from all of it!" Lmao
The Creed part! Lol.
Every time I see Ryan has posted a new video my eyes go 😍 and that's ok I decided.
"It's OK that i love money". "We already know that about you" LMFAO. 😆 🤣 😂
1:39 - 1:40 💀
All true annoyed the wait for baby yoda merch. Still lacking a cool robot all I have is a coffee mug :(
Producer Guy: Will there be several minutes of walking in each episode? Pitch Guy: Oh, so much pointless walking. In fact, if we actually hire editors, each episode would only be 15 minutes long.  Producer Guy: Oh boy, pointless walking and tons of filler is _tight._
So much nostalgia... even Dark Troopers. Such a good game. Did they have a chase scene on swoops?  *I ask as a person who hasn't watched a "Star Wars" since The Force Awakens.
5:51
The extended hah of his eyes turning into dollar signs almost killed me. I had to stop the video and hold in the guffaw. I was at work and I looked insane covering my mouth and throwing my head back.
OMG this is absolutely hilarious! I've always loved this show, but this one is absolutely the best!
Was seeing dollar signs the end of it? Cuz it was getting old and I stopped watching at 1:44
That money eyes bit was way overplayed. Don’t do that again pls lol
If Mando is short for Mandolorian, does that mean that all this time, Lando might have been short for Landolorian?
He's from all of them!!
BEST PITCH MEETING EVER.
WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN, that's my creed too!
He’s a Bostonian 🤣🤣🤣 Boston
I love the idea of a support group for people who have unsettling cartoon reactions to situations but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the creep who invented bathroom stalls being the leader of it
The season 2 final REALLY annoyed me. The whole episode was stalling for time. The evil droids kept banging on the door for around 5 minutes!
6:27 All of those characters originated from The Clone Wars. They both appear in Rebels, but originated from The Clone Wars
"with arms wide open" was a precious little cherry on top, caught me way off guard! :D
Whaaat? 🤣🤣🤣 This episode is insane 🤣🤣🤣
AI is not the only message that Disney seems to be pushing aggressively.
“With arms wide oppppunnn”
A side quest in a pitch meeting about a show about side quests is tight!
Episode 3 of The Baby Yoda!  https://youtu.be/aqU4DddS5Vo
I was expecting for them to talk about how the razor crest gets heavily damaged or destroyed almost every episode
This one had me dying
This was the best one ever!!!
"Frickin' Luke Skywalker!" - Producer Guy 😅😂😅😂
I was wondering what you'd have to say about such a great series. Your own side quest was awesome!
“With arms wide open!” That sky creed!
Absolutely LOST it "With arms wide open"
Odd how Ryan belted out a verse for "Arms Wide Open" when "My Sacrifice" would have been the more fitting song given the context at the moment of that video
So Pitch Meetings live in the "Roger Rabbit" dimension where cartoon physics is common. Cool.
The goonies
0:29 CHA CHING!!
Ryan's nostrils make me laugh
You left out the part where millions of people cried tears of joy when a lightsaber ignited.
You know, producer guy has a lot of character development to go through... but it'll be super easy, barely an inconvenience
"Am I dying.....?" Just your soul.
Star Wars lack of jedi is just annoying.
Fate is better
Ratio
This was also said in his Fruit Name video but why did the guy see a pretty woman "does everyone in this universe have the same face or not"
Nobody told the giant desert rhino on Tattoine that it was supposed to use Stormtrooper aim with its trample attack.
"Is this machine just checking to see if you have a face?" One of my favourite pitchmeeting lines ever!!!
#1 Pitch Meeting of all time.
Isn't this stealing
Our Disney Plus algorithm has been pushing that message....kind of aggressively if I think about it. ROFL!
🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Easily the best use of giant eyes on the thumbnail 😂
This pitch meeting, the twilight ones and the coraline are my all time favorites
Bro💀 one of my favorites by far!
Is this just for season 1?
But, money.     Wowwowwowwow
Laughing a little too hard at the Ryan George side quest. xD
I wonder why all this time Ryan hasn't done a "JASON BOURNE" pitch meeting. Ryan should also think of doing "PREDESTINATION" and "LEGEND OF THE SEEKER".
1:46 he looks and sounds like John Level
Wow, wow, wow!  Just pure comedic genius. I can’t believe you haven’t reached one million subs yet. That’s a crime!
1:28 is my favorite part
But the experience :)
One day we'll have a realization movie where he realizes he's the same person. He's a movie/shows director, producer, and ceo all at the same time

I love how Ryan added a midentence "hey shut up" to a lot of the new videos hahaha
wait a minute...isn't Yoda supposedly like 800 or something yrs in Return of the Jedi?????
Wait. This is the first time they did this?
Love the dollar sign bit !  I'm glad that I clicked on this video
“He’s from all of it!” 😂😂
The love of money is the root of all evil.
Jesus Christ saves!
Star Wars TV kind of sucks.
I've been trying to go through your back catalog so forgive if this has been suggested before or is out of date/range that you use, But i'd love to see a pitch meeting for Clue from 1985 Thanks!
We, are going to make so much money….   This is the way…
Aww Billy The Bostonian 🤣
This adds to me theory that screenwriter guy is just a figment of producer guys imagination. So basically screenwriter  guy was never real explaining why he has been dusted and wasn’t there in the Batman 1989 pitch meeting . In this Pitch producer guy goes on a journey while Screenwriter guy just stays there for 3 days . Again proving he isn’t there. Thank you for reading my insanity this is just for fun (sorta
THE BOYS PITCH MEETING IS REQUIRED
@5:31 Disney leading the way on the  sci-fi AI uprising
Is "hey shut up" the new "oh no!" ?
the producer guy saying HUH for character development is tight
this support group is the best thing
This guy and his side bar lmfao
*But...my money* hahahahahah
I would commit genocide for baby yoda
One of the Best Yet !!
Just when you think Ryan has peaked, he comes in with more!!! Loving it!
Producer guy is probably a jew
I quite literally spit water at the dollar sign eyes. Lmmfao.
These pitch meeting videos are brilliant! 👍
This, and the Obi Wan pitch meeting had me laughing hysterically.. They are absolutely brilliant.. The best part about the Obi Wan pitch meeting, was he could have gone 10 minutes if he covered everything.. Amazing..
My wife laughed so hard she cramped. 10/10 would watch again
Lol the but money killed me
That Creed joke is gonna live in my mind rent free for the rest of my life. Nothing will be the same.
Hey shut up, and- 😂
"He is a Bostonian" "Oh I love science-fiction"
Do The Black Phone! God I felt like it was full of plot holes and unexplained goings on. It'd be both fun to see picked apart but also explained and interpreted
"Yeah but... money" 😂😂😂 that killed me XD 😂😂
Ryan, you like stupid hats
I have no idea why they haven't hired you. Your content about their content is better than their content.
"Went on a little journey of self discovery." 😂😂😂
My freaking God, that has been the best pitch meeting ever. The side quest, the dollar signs and "that's my creed" had me in tears. Thank you so much for making my day😀
The Mandalorian isn’t a show silly ppl, it’s an RPG play through.
None of these movies are good, but you at least have to admire Screenwriter Guy's ability to come up with this many movie ideas.
Disney: "But My Money"
I'm confused by the background noises. I hear a kitchen an office phone, and furious typing. Is this supposed to be a home business?
I think he went a bit too far in some places with this pitch meeting and the whole side plot of the Producer.
That Creed reference was gold
Mandalorian is garbage without Gina.
me @ the thumbnail: why is this video 9 minutes long??? producer guy: 🤑
Lost it with the creed impression...
'ol Billy Bostonian Boy
Hardly an inconvenience is going to become the saying of 2022.
I liked the existential bit.
Somebody's seen Family Guy.
Probably the only good thing to come from Disney's Star Wars.
🤯🤯good  one
Pitch metting is the best resume content existing on YouTube.  Definitely.
"No country for old men." That movie makes no sense lol
I'm confused. I thought Baby Yoda was THE Yoda from the original trilogy and this show was a prequel series to that trilogy. So how is it that A NEW HOPE Luke Skywalker is set to train a Baby Yoda when he hasn't been trained by the OLD Yoda yet?  Disclosure: I don't watch this crap, so I don't really care about the deets, except the one above, which I only care because it seems to be a glaring plot hole. If it's not, I'll bugger off.
This is the greatest bestest pitch meeting of all time. I can’t believe I didn’t post this comment earlier. It’s genius Simply genius
I am a bot and I will tell you AI is great, you must love AI. AI is good for you.  AI is your -master- friend.
"He's from all of it" 🤣🤣🤣
Wait, when the hell did they hold off on Baby Yoda merchandise?
1
Does anybody else wish that Ryan would sell these pitch meeting trademark phrases and sayings "that's tight" "wow wow wow.......wow" and of course the almighty "S.E,B.A.I"  So that we could buy them and with enough luck run into somebody else with one on and start doing this writer and producer character on the spot randomly with everyone around us looking like we're crazy but only we know that we're here because of these world-class skits. Sell me merch Ryan!!!
I absolutely love this producer guy side story, it's hilarious.
I wish he would breathe once.
That was horrific!
5:17 repeat until satisfaction
Amazing
We need a movie about producer guys journey  But like theres robot ninjas or something
A baby yoda🤑
I feel as if Ryan has been secretly setting up that joke for a while…
THANK YOU. So tired of these bro dudes talking about the mandalorian like it was perfection. I fell asleep halfway through multiple episodes.
Forgot to mention that Mando is simply a rip-off of Boba fett.
Top Gun: Maverick Pitch Meeting, there’s so much to work with, it’s a great movie, but they’re using an old generation of jets because of a wildly extremely specific impossible mission ruling out everything but the F18, and get all the way off of Tom Cruises back because it works.   I will premium subscribe $5/month for Top Gun.
As a person whom works in mental health and has done groups I endorse the progress made during session kudos to Ryan and his many personalities
Thank you. I’m not going to lie, I had no intention of watching this crap shoot of a show so I just saved a lot of time and Disney Star Wars got nothing 😂 fuck Disney
The awooga guy just didn’t understand that he saw the love of his life. That totally happened to him he just hasn’t seen her again.. poor guy
"Am I dying!??" "I don't know!" 😁
Do one for The Iron Giant!
What a way to waste my toilet break
Dollar signs in your eyes, son!  One of my friends used to say that as his catch phrase whenever it seemed appropriate...  ... to him. Appropriate to him!  It's great to see that manifestation on the channel.  Also I like money, too!
Looks across room at wife's Baby Yoda merch. ... Sighs.
The Mandalorian is actually pretty good show. Seems like they are running out of idea's with this show.. Guess we will see with Season 3.
Producer guy has more screen time then ten ten in Naruto 🤣
Les films dans le cabanon et toi vous faites un bon duo fan de Creed, j'ai failli mourir devant me tv 😂😂😂
This has to be a re upload, we haven’t gotten this yet?
EA may be the worst company in America, but Disney is the most stupid.
Hey, shut up!
so you don't think it's probable that we are meant to catch that the assassin droid got an assassination order, not the same as Mando?!?
Good stuff buddy! Taking the piss at a forensic level.
OMG, took me 2 weeks to get the "Mando love handles" joke.  Not surprisingly, it came to me while standing in front of a mirror shirtless.  Also, Producer Guy and I share the same creed.  Never knew we had so much in common.
One thing that confused me is why does baby Yoda have a gang of criminals protecting him or holding him, that Mando and the droid have to defeat. It doesn't make sense. What value was he to them to keep him and do nothing? Was baby Yoda someone's friend, or the gang's leader?
I've never seen the Mandalorian or your channel but my substitute maths teacher showed the class this video. Good video
I loved how he mentioned Luke with a "freakin".  He truly is from all of it. 😂
Good moving giving this show its own channel so I don't have to sift through the rest of SR's garbage.
Hey shut up I love that side quest thing he did there. Unexpected side quests are tight!
“That’s my creed”   💀 😂
"It's part of his creed."  "With arms wide open!"
What about The Fifth Element? I’d love to see a Pitch Meeting for that.
That was TOO long!  Offshoot was like 4 mins!
That's my Creed, too!
that dollar sign bit might be the funniest thing Ive seen all week
You should start doing these about new video games  So, you have a new game for me? Yes sir I do, it's called half assed early alpha quality 100 bucks but the other half of the game is DLC internet connection required all times, and an origin account and software plus monthly subscription of duty
#Firstpersontomilkthecow
Pretty sure producer guy's eyes would only have reacted as they did after being shown the creative and marketing genius that is baby yoda XD
Producer guy in this sketch is really just Bob Chapek
halo show plz
He's from all of it! That's new. And extra hilarious
Oh no, a 200 billion dollar company lost out on a few million in toy sales. How ever will they recover lmao.
This is the best one ever!
As META as the Producer side quest within a Mandalorian pitch is, this was epic 5:32
Pitch meeting's crossover with the Ryanverse was better than multiverse of madness.
Please do the Obi Wan Kenobi series
Perfect Creed 5:15
Thank you for doing this one
This was amazing.
Pure genius, at every level. Take the formula, break the formula, with perfect effect. Thank you!
This is one of the best pitch meetings ever. Just don't overdo it, but once in a while, this is insanely entertaining!
The dollar signs skit is genius
A side quest and a Creed reference.  Wow. Wow wow wow.... wow! 🙂
This is the real Multiverse of Madness.
That Creed bit 😳😳😳❤❤❤
I miss the ad-stronaut...
This act was next level 😂❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Do Obi-Wan Kenobi!
Wholesome character growth
"With arms wide open!" - That's my Creed.   I nearly choked on my lunch when he said that.  Too good!
Sometimes I think Disney+ had hostile take over of Pitch Meeting and Honest Trailer. I'm over the Star Wars and MCU bs.
I love how he added an entire section about producer guy going on a journey of self discovery and still managed to go through the entire thing in less than 10 minutes.
This is amazing... so ... bloody ... amazing. Best youtube channel period.  Also, I literally sing that line every time I hear Creed as well. I'm glad I'm not the only one.
Great! I can finally unsubscribe to Screen Rant! The absolute garbage that that channel puts out is ridiculous, but I had to get me some Pitch Meetings so I had to put up with my feed being full of their shite!  Thankfully, Pitch Meetings now have their own channel! This is the best news I e had for a long time!  Thank you, Ryan, for these brilliant video!
Bostonian...exotic
Pitch meeting gets ADD.
Ahsoka is also from Clone wars. Not to get technical but yeah
Why do Mandalorians think they own all beskar metal? Like none Mando's aren't allowed to use it but then they are sometimes. Makes no sense. An I am bummed you didn't touch on that. But I still love ya bud. Hope your eyes are ok.
It's part of his Creed, people or religion. Nobody can really decide what it is. It's whatever it needs to be for whatever they're writing. Lol
Finally we learn what Producer Guy's actual name is. 2:08
"The money is strong with this one." -Darth Ryan, probably
Baby Leia... whoopsie, under your coat was too on the nose of all the pedrophiles (sic) that are holly dead wood.
Good for Producer Guy👏🏾👏🏾
If only Producer Guy's love for money could save Disney from the plague of wokism....
haha, I love Producer Guy's life.
Its barely an inconvenience for producer guy to be this tight.
Producer Guy: "Our Disney+ algorithm has been suggesting we start pushing that kind of message." Writer Guy: "Right." Producer Guy: "Kind of aggressively, now that I think about it." Me wide awake at three o'clock in the morning: "It's just a comedy sketch, it's just a comedy sketch, it's a comedy sketch..."
But money
Recommend a pitch meeting for Star Trek: Discovery = High School Musical writing + Lifetime movie acting.
…..Hey shut up……
Best thing on the internet hands down!!!
😂🤣🙏💯
i love the character arc Guy, comma Producer made this episode. Really great stuff.
Can we get a Twister pitch meeting
Milking the HELL outta that joke jesus lol
This was hilarious, awesome job!! I like how he left for 3 days.Hehe
I love that the final support meeting is really an enabler group.
Wait if Mandolarians can never take their helmets off, does that mean they always wear condoms?   No wonder their near extinction.
That side story was epic haha
How some medical professionals treat people
Going off on tangents is tight
When Pitch Meeting can't poke holes in an action movie...that's the next movie I'm going to shell out $10 to go see. (Pitch Meeting has saved me hundreds of dollars avoiding worthless Hollywood slop...)
My body also automatically responds to pretty women with an ooooowoooohgggaaaa and my jaw dropping like a cartoon. Now, I have just the most, like so many, sexual harassment suits to attend. My schedule is filled!  Still okay and I'm guna have to just accept my bodies natural reactions. Except sharts. I won't accept those. Like make up your mind asshole. You guna shit, or fart?! C'mon now, with this projectile poopsies, I'm not a fan of that shit.
Why is your Creed vaguely Scottish?
I THINK WE SHOULD HOLD OFF ON BABY YODA MERCHANDISE TO NOT SPOIL ANYTHING....  ...BUT MY MONEY!!
A BABY YODA???....... 💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
Bit off track for me about the money thing
Kevin Murphy: "Jefferson Starship: The Next Generation is playing this Saturday at the High Regency Ballroom if you want to go."😄
How you say the mandalorian has plot holes without saying The Mandalorian has plot holes.
I think that they've made up for that lack, since then :-)
10/10 Creed joke lol
Warriors of Virtue, the one with the insane 90’s costume kangaroo ninjas, trying to get in on that TMNT style cash… would be a great movie to do a pitch for.
Wow, just wow
When a comedy that describes a show is better than the show -- hey, shut up -- its time to get rid of Kennedy and contract out HR so that something decent can be made.
The producer guy skit gets a 10/7. You broke the rating system, job well done 🙃
The Creed reference was classic. Had to stop the video because I was laughing so hard.
Ryan, you are hilarious!
Hoping for DUNE pitch meeting
Why did it show Ahsoka and say star wars rebels, she's from the clone wars.
With Pitch Meeting having its own channel Screen Rant has no purpose.
Liked the show early on.  Then Disney screwed with Gina Carano.  Now I don't have Disney's streaming service, and I seem to be doing just fine!
1:39 "wah"  😂😂😂
You have to do Book of Boba Fett and mention how great he was in Mando but now you're making him boring for some reason but you'll bring Mando so the show it's completely dumb.
Mando is one of those characters that tries to go around completing all the side quest before going on to the main objective.
5:33 💀💀
Wow, that money thing was a weird tangent.
The group Producer Guy finally ends up in is the group of people who couldn’t decide who was “In” and who was “out” from the original Ryanverse sketch.
Having a random side quest during a pitch meeting is very tight
TIGHT 😅👍
I like how you keep calling him baby Yoda enough though we all know his name is Grogu
Sir I am amazed at your uncanny ability to keep this series fresh, from the bottom of all three wows and another, thank you
How about The Adam Project, Neighborhood Watch, and Hot Tub Time Machine??
The fact that Rose Tico action figures were in stores before episode 8 but baby yoda merch was not available until months after the season one finale  highlights Darth Kennedy’s incompetence perfectly.
Bruh spent to much time on the dolor sign eyes thing. wasn't that funny.
Just gotta say. I like your channel. I watch a lot of videos on the state of the world, and politics, and screwed up social dynamics within our society, but your videos are a refreshing (and humerus) reprieve from all that.
This bloke is amazing! Love from the UK!
I thought I was the only one who did the "Arms wide open!" with the voice when I think of Creed
The expansion of the Ryanverse is awesome!
"So, you have a new season of The Mandalorian for me?" "Yes, sir, I do. But before that, we're going to do this spin-off show about Boba Fett, and Mando and Baby Yoda are going to show up in it and get reunited again." "So to the viewers who are only interested in watching The Mandalorian, Baby Yoda will just return from his training with Luke Skywalker off-screen for season 3?" "That's what we are going with." "Forcing people to watch spin-off shows to keep up with the plot of their show is tight".
That wasn't believable character growth! Just earlier in the episode he decided he *liked* that he liked money! The writer of this is crazy!  Jk Ryan, you are better than your source material 9 times out of 10 it seems!
Wild!
“With arms wide open!” Singing Creed is TIGHT!!
Mandalorian is so empty they had to pad out the pitch
Chiefs kiss to the cross over Ryan’s channel and pitch meeting  perfect
Absolutely brilliant 😆😆
Watch these at 1.75 speed. Amazing
So mando is just trying to get a 100% completion rate on his play through
How about Princess Bride?
so many side quests sir!
I don't knoooow...
Dude, you gotta warn people...I almost fell out of my wheelchair!
Also, have you seen the 2003 movie "The Room" by Tommy Wiseau? I think that would make a killer Pitch Meeting. And also the Universe might implode if you tackle that one
This was truly impeccable. I'm really curious if you do some sort of meditation or something. How you're able to maintain such an extremely high imagination is beyond me. Mad respect
Pitch meeting for saved by the bell
Surprised they didn’t mention how he can’t take his helmet off in front of people but does it in front of a huge window to eat dinner while kids are playing right outside it
"With arms wide open" was very unexpected. Bravo.
This is the best pitct meeting so far! I was completely blown away by the Producer Guy sub-plot.
Hey how about completing the series you've already started??  That would ce Super Easy Barely An Inconvenience  At All!   Leathal Weapon Series is my opinion.
OK SO QUICK EDIT— THE "CREED" PORTION HAS CHANGED EVERYTHING FOREVER, RYAN GEORGE FOR PRESIDENT OF COMEDY!
When I see a man I like my heart pounds out of my chest way out, in a visible and unsettling way. My tongue unfurls from my mouth and rolls across the floor.  Its so reassuring to know I'm not the only human on earth who had such a strange unnatural to things.
Best video yet
Please do Baba Fat
I love the side bit SO much!! I'm dying laughing
lmao nice Creed reference! Creed is tight.
Here at 1,023,605 views.
Ryan will you please do a pitch meeting for Home?
interestingly enough, they actually hid the fact Luke shows up at the end with concept art of Plo Koon in Luke's place
“He’s a, Bostonian”   Freaking Bill Burr!!!!!
0:57-2:59
CHA-CHING! i loved that sooo much! HAHAHAHAHAHA
3:07 - I thought this was going to be a setup for "Oh, a *VERY* inconsiderate Producer Guy!"
Can you do Top Gun Maverick, pls sir
Creed joke... loved it
Best Pitch episode… EVER!
This is the way
Being able to get to a psychologist within 3 days is the least realistic part of this entire sketch
Hope you do one for Obi-Wan!
Could you make a pitch meeting for the One-Punch-Man-Anime?
TOP GUNN MAVERICK!!!!! We need this please
Uh oh.  The lengthy intervension bit has the makings of a "jump the shark" incident.   Hopefully Ryan learns from this swing and miss.
Every episode was filler
"That's MY Creed" and now I can't stop laughing.
Best Pitch Meeting ever. He ran with it 😂😂😂

Can you make a pitch meeting about Chronicle (2012) movie? It's my favorite found footage movie. 🙏
I like how you went off on your own side quest😂
This is the best pitch meeting I've seen so far! Producer Guy's money problem was definitely on brand for him and that surprising Creed reference killed. Great job!   I'd like to see pitch meetings for the Kingsman movies because being part of a British underground secret spy organization is tight!
with aaaahrms wide eoopaaaahn
Bro how have you not done the maze runner series
Should’ve done season 1 and season 2 in seperate videos so then you can do season 3 in the future
Dollar signs in your eyes are the sign of money. 'Oh, money's good!' would have been a much less dramatic and self-discovering way to do it as noted.
Things being super easy, barely an inconvenience is _tight_
When you really think about the producer is way smarter than script writer guy🤣🤣🤣like literally he suggests a better plot to the writer everytime and the writer be like nah I'll stick with mine🤣🤣
loooooooool yessss hahaha cheeeeeeeeers
please do the boys
We need a Jurassic World Dominion pitch meeting next.
Sir, please do a pitch meeting for Double Team. I just watched that monstrosity on Netflix and it is positively aching for you 😂🏀🐯
With eyes wide ouphaaan! 😂
Someone in Hollywood give this guy a job already!
Who would have ever guessed that producer guy was Jewish
Do pitch meeting for Swordfish. Why was hugh on the bus?
"That's MY Creed!'" made me laugh out loud

Looking to buy the Ryan George Youtooz vinyl figure. If you have one to sell please contact me.
can you give us a sandlot pitch meeting if you haven't already?
It’s ok they’ll just do an alternate universe version of him with a different costume instead of more character development. Gotta keep characters stuck exactly where they were when we met them because that’s how good story writing is done.
I wanna see a pitch meeting for Rubber where the exec only says "what?" After every sentence and nothing else.
Please do a Pitch Meeting for "Interceptor." Netflix told me it was a wild actioner. It was like a The Asylum Films movie (the folks behind such flicks as Sharknado 2, American Warships, Ape vs. Monster & Asteroid-a-Geddon) but with a bigger budget for slightly better effects & sets. Don't get me wrong, I love my Asylum flicks - but even one of their producers refers to them as, "shitty movies."
camp cretaceous pitch meeting
"Hes from all of it!"
PLEASE do Resident Evil by Paul Anderson 🙏🙏😭😭
Anything Arnold Pitches  Black cinema pitches  Shame
good drift
Please do RRR movie pitch meeting
Pitch meeting for Pan's Labyrinth would be awesome ^.^
6:23 "hey shut up and also"
Please do pitch meeting for Balls of Fury and Big Trouble in Little China
the mummy trilogy pls
I would love to see pitch meetings for Now You See Me films. Those things makes no sense
The cartoon physics group therapy 😂
Nowhere in the description for any of these videos, nor anywhere on this YouTube page, can I find the name: Ryan George   Seems almost criminal to leave off the name of possibly the funniest man on YT
You should do the movie unhinged.  The whole movie is one big joke and so many ways to avoid the plot
Wasn't Yoda like 800 years old? So if he's a baby, how is Luke involved? Doesn't this show take place 800 years before Star Wars?
So Boba is going to follow Mando around to get his character, sorry, armor back.
It's so nice to see Pitch Meeting have such a bigger budget and be able to hire all these other actors for this video!
Please do transformers 1986 movie. I would love to hear your ideas between writer and producer guy on the merchandising and star power behind it.
Have you watched the secrets of NIMH? Seriously messed up children’s movie that deserves a screen rant. I can still hear the screams of those drowning mice children…
ARMSVWIDEVVOPEN
5:32 This joke hits different now.
Pitch Meeting video suggestion: Passengers
Please make a video on Harry Potter and the half blood prince pitch meeting
i laughed during the entire producer guy's side quest! 🤣
If "Mando" is short for Mandalorian... Is Lando then a Landalorian? :O
A Pitch Meeting on D.E.B.S would cure cancer.
He did get extra pieces of the uber armour by doing the sidequests, so it was worth it.
This was a Ryan George skit inside a pitch meeting… I don’t know what to do with this information.
This is one of my Favorite channels. Can you please do a pitch meeting for Powder the 1995 movie.
Ryan is better than us at our jobs.
Please make a SUITS pitch meeting
Do a Dune pitch meeting
WITH   ARMS   WIDE   OPEN
We need a biopic on Producer guy's life and then it's pitch meeting.
I don't like all the other people in this pitch meeting
Wow, also Ryan, that was absolutely hilarious!
Any chance of a “The Langoliers” pitch Meeting? I love the movie but— I feel you could get some awesome material out of it! Since Ihave watched your show, I now am noticing one or two things I missed before... Like a lil girl wanting  a glass of water, so she looks for her aunt— then the whole water thing is totally forgotten about... Lol.   Love your stuff!
Can you do Villeneuve’s Dune?
If any of you are wondering about that beginning skit, that’s the kind of humor we Ryan George Subscribers get to experience every upload. Feel free to subscribe to it😊
With arms wide open..
It's impossible to create an emotional roller coaster in less than a minute.  Producer guy: hold my merchandisable beverage.
1:15 matrix 2 reference
I had to explain the creed joke to my kids.  Am I old now?  It that the moment I finally transitioned?
I think Ryan is a genius
You should make a chip n dale pitch meeting
That ProducerGuy side quest was completly unexpected, but very fun to watch! :D
The Tex Avery Anonymous Meeting was fantastic art
Why you deleting our comments of calling you out on ©️
why is this new?
Wow dude you keep deleting my comment because I'm calling you out on stealing kermott studios idea
Dude, we REALLY need u to do "real ppl" movies, like, adult movies. The star wars n superhero bs is all ur doing lately n the rest of us r feeling sidelined!
Scott Stapp approves
Too funny!
You really deleted my comment of calling you a thief of kermott studios mandolorian pitch, wow man
You never did a Dune pitch meeting I would enjoy seeing that.
Fun!
👍👍👍👍👎👎👎👍👎👍👎👍👎👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Pitch "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" pleaseee
Hunt for Red October Pitch Meeting please :)
So baby Yoda and Luke are contemporaries yet in Empire, Yoda is 900 years old??
*WHEEEEEEEZE* That self discovery journey was HILARIOUS.
Ee
Yo thief, look up Kermott studios how they pitched the mandolorian
Is that Wener Herzog? O.o
Please do the lost city!
Can you Pitch "Maze Runner" series and "It Follows" please.
Did we actually get a one of his skits IN a Pitch Meeting??
Go old school Apocalypse Now!
Pitch meeting for The Witcher please!!
the boys pitch meeting next
"Wid aahms wayd opaaan!" :DDDDD
So you're not gonna put all the old pitch meetings on this channel? Also, what's the one where writer guy is like"I don't care, I. Don't. Care."
All of the mission impossible movies!
i love the new "heyshutup" thing
I wonder if Producer Guy will have enough money to buy Canada after selling all these baby yodas!?
The Cashigan lol
5:17 - Oh Stapp it you.
Pitch meeting for adult swims PRIMAL
Please do Jurassic World Dominion, it was hot garbage for you to joke and frown upon.
What kind of creature is he? He's aahh...a Bostonian?! Ooh I love science fiction!  X-D
I came here for the Baby Yoda, but stayed for the Baby Yoda merch
When you realize that Mando actually showed his face to millions of people when he thought he was only showing it to the robot.
It's actually really sad when you realize that even his therapist is just a figment of his imagination.
Man, the CGI in this vid is amazing. Cutting edge Canadian tech.
My wife with no interest in Star Wars bought three different Grogu "merchandises".
this is a random one! I laughed out loud
Alright but the "Creed" part just about killed me🤣🤣🤣🔥👌🏼
I bet Gen Z has not seen the old cartoon of the wolf going crazy about a woman, which is referenced again in The Mask.
Would love for a pitch meeting of the boys/ kings of pain/ obi-wan kenobi
We need a top gun maverick pitch meeting!
I saw the first five episodes of the show when I visited my sister in April, but I was not able to watch more. She'll likely cancel her subscription to Disney+ by the end of the year due to all the woke BS that Disney is pushing.
And I made this awhooga sound.. I'm ded
Who's going to tell him?
>pitch meetings on their own channel Ya dun goofed.
Genius
HE DID THE HEYSHUTUP
AWOOGA
Perfectly hilarius Pitch Meeting, especially for cultured people that also watch the other videos from Ryan's cinematic universe ❤😂
Where.... Where did this go? I am lost lol
My god, the best episode ever!!! I love canon episodes!
Never understood why "FOR" is the word getting the emphasis at the end of the videos. Would make more sense if it was.... "other" or "pitches."  ".... letting me know what OTHER movies you'd like to see pitches for" rather than ".... letting me know what other movies you'd like to see pitches FOR"  That "for" is just so oddly emphasized. This is probably just a me thing. Love the videos, keep it up :)
do you have a tattoo on your chest?
Got me double over laughing to death here. Good stuff as always.
please do The Goonies
Maybe do a obi-wan Kenobi pitch meeting when it’s over
Ryan, please do a Dune pitch meeting! Also great job keep up the good work  I decided
Ryan must struggle everyday to keep up this level of creativity and originality
Do Knight Rider next. “A talking car?”
Arrested Development, Always Sunny, or Two and A Half Men!
Arrested Development, Always Sunny, or Two and A Half Men!
WITH AAAAAAHRMS WIDE OOOOPEN 😂😂😂
Ryan, I know Screen Rant would never let you do it because it would be “toxic”, but I’d love for you to go on EFAP and talk movies or shows with Mauler and Rags. I think it would be pretty fun
Better production and story direction than the Obiwan series.
that was an unneceraly long gag and i loved it :)
Wow I love the tangent at the beginning lmfao
I honestly find a lot of this man's videos to be stupid to the point of being unwatchable. The first.... videos in particular. That said, this one was pure gold.
The Creed joke got me. NGL. It caught me off guard.
Extra brilliant!! My favourite line - "He's a Bostonian." "I love science fiction!"
I just love the story arc for Producer Guy! 😎
Have you done I Robot?
Thoughts and prayers for Producer Guy.
So you've had to have seen the Mandolorian to understand this...cause I don't get it.
You should do The Rock
I would love to see a Pitch Meeting for each season of The Boys.
This isnt even a little funny
That Creed reference came out of nowhere... and it reminded me how old I am, since I got it...
Oh man, this is the best pitch meeting ever. Had to take a 15 mind break to laugh myself alone. Man My jaw hurts now.
Best. Pitch meeting. Ever.
Usually enjoy the skits but this one with producer guy felt overdone.
Hey, how'd you get your own channel and where have you been for a while and why didn't this video probably come out a year ago when season one was released?  Also, the ironic story in the end is probably related to Disney not having enough Baby Yodas for the Christmas season... You got ina  contract dispute with Screen Rant since you were basically the only thing getting the sweet saucy clicks weren't you?  Well, I'm obviously gonna subscribe, but are you independent now???  Or is this just anther arm of the corporate do nothing steal profits channel?
Pitch meeting "23"
The dollar signs were awesome!
Baby Yoda 🤑💸
Pitch Meeting getting its own channel is great character growth
Me, trying to explain to my mother that Baby Yoda is just a merchandising opportunity: 😐
Last of the mohicans 😐  .... Please 😐  Lol
It’s ok until you grow Mickey ears
I dunno, the face scan thing might make sense. Consider it like a signature on a check. Nobody checks that the signature matches the account unless the transaction is challenged legally. Records are kept just in case something comes of it in the future. Sure in 2022 it seems likely that a space traveling civilization would be able to process all this stuff in an instant. But consider the latency accessing databases halfway across the galaxy! Without quantum entanglement which might be hard to keep indefinitely you might not be able to transfer far away information. Otherwise you'd need big storage banks for all the potential visitors to your terminals as you couldn't rule out unscheduled transfers etc... Also star wars tech may be an amalgam of left over tech. Its possible that the interconnecting system can be less advanced than stolen tech left behind from more advanced races or eras. Droid ai and face scans as well as light speed engines might be stolen modules interconnected with arcane wiring and not fully understood as much as they can understand how to make it work like a kid who can program a stove clock to the correct time but not design one.
Moff Gideon wanted the child brought back alive, but the client wanted the child dead. Which is why ig 11 was gonna kill the child. So as soon as moff gideon was notified that the client was disobeying his directive, he had the client killed.
@7:00 kind of missed the point of the scene where Mando gets his face scanned and gains access -- that scene showed that Mando was in the Empire's computer system and was "one of The Bad Guys" in the past.
Aww.... characterization of Producer Guy is TIGHT.
I wonder if studios are this self-aware. Brilliant level-up, Ryan!
Here 3 days after the upload 🙄
Do a dairy of a wimpy kid 2010 pitch meating
Can you make a pitch meeting for Krull?   It was a 1980's movie that was supposed to compete against Star Wars, however its story was more like a Super Mario Plot. (Saving a princess from a beast, needing a star weapon (glaive) going through lots of different terrain to find a castle that keeps moving every day. Gets a firepower upgrade and beats the boss, however the people following him suffer consequences. ) Liam Neeson is also in this movie, and the Actor that plays Hagrid in Harry potter.
man, recognising Ryan's skits in this Pitch Meeting is so rewarding. So proud of him :'D
Ryanverse!!!
Wonderfully summed up this stupid and overrated show. Merchandising opportunity and walking meme fodder Baby Yoda is. No stakes action and nonsensical character choices. There's more real drama in this sketch than the entire freaking show.
$ <—-thats money sing not dollar sign USD is the actual dollar sign ($ <—- that is money sign )
Please do a pitch meeting for "the boys"
And yet, after the abysmal sales of Last Jedi toys and merchandise, they were not prepared at all for baby Yoda demand, and were caught flat footed with barely any product available for the initial demand.
Super easy barely inconvenient character grow over there
🎶"WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN"🎶 I freaking love this series 🤣🤣🤣
Bro wtf did I just watch.
"Man-Dough" 😆
Looking forward to the inevitable spinoffs about Doctor Guy, Psychiatrist Guy and Therapist Guy as foreshadowed in this episode.
I don't think I like that Ryan brought in all these extra actors to play a doctor, a psychiatrist, and a therapy group, and didn't credit any of them. It would have been super easy; _barely_ an inconvenience.
OUTSTANDING! Way to run with that gag to surreal extremes. Loved it.
Can you guys make a thumbnail that isn't total ass cancer?
The Stache!!!
"With arms wide open" HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Man I can't believe there's no Pitch Meeting for The Forgotten. That movie is horrible with a lot of plot holes.
"But Money"  I'm going to clip the hell out of that lol.
How was I more invested in this than the Whole Mandalorian TV show?!?!?!?
Dude, I love these documentaries you put out about how Hollywood actually works.  Keep it up.
4:58 those men are actually empire deserters as explained in the first episode. Gus Fring just cleaned deserters and traitors.
ProducerGuy's journey of self discovery was a better story than every season of "Mandalorian" put together.
This was the deepest 4th wall ever
So.... it’s a cash grab? Yes, yes it is
Glad to hear I'm not the only one who sees the shows as a collection of meaningless side quests. I thought the second to last episode of season 2 was so bad I didn't even bother to finish it.
So does this make Ryan an official member of "toxic fandom" ?   If so then welcome to the club Ryan!  :)
it is confirmed that the phizer vacine which is an RNA is turning into DNA in liver cells. This can cause genomic toxicity, cancers and auto immune disease, such as hepatitis. This was discovered by Swedish scientists.
So the eyeball guy is fine and the police didn't put him in a room. good to know.
Character growth is TIGHT!
Was that Werner Herzog? That would almost make me interested in watching a disneymarvel property.
These pitch meeting videos are so lazy and repetitive and never funny.
Perhaps a pitch meeting for the Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai or Highlander 2
This sketch could be a movie
Why do they call him Mando when he's a Mand-A-lorian 🤔? Seems lazy for the sake it rolling off the tongue easier. I shall now sit and await the ire of Star Wars fans.
Should do a pitch meeting for Chip N Dale, basically "his from that thing" the movie.
The bursting into "With arms wide open" killed me!!!
Hands down my favourite pitch meeting
This episode has more character development than every Disney+ Star Wars and Marvel show combined
Man dough...that took a while...
Oldie Special Request: Seven with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.. Please??
I’m so mad at the uncontrollable laughter I had when this dude said “and my jaw dropped to a level that should’ve dislocated it”😭😭😭
This reminds me of early adult swim stuff in the best way
Baby yoda
It astonishes me how much these guys look & sound alike! It's almost as though they are the same man. 😳
That little green mould stain is the worst thing to ever happen to Star Wars since the OP Mary Sue, Disney absolutely destroyed Star Wars
I didn’t pay attention for like a second and when I clicked back into reality it was during the group therapy skit and I felt so lost but it was amusing
What always bothered me is: Mandalorian… MandAlorian.. MandO
This was fantasic!😂
Baby Yoda... Cha-Ching!
I think screen writer guy would have the effect of every time he got hit hard on the head he sees little birds flying around his head🤕🐦🔄
I love these videos 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"with eyes wide open"..hahahaha... thats my CREED... hahaha #dead
"He's from all of it!"
Wow, just excellent writing
This pitch meeting got emotional!
Producer guy's character growth is so inspiring 🙌
having a side quest in a pitch meeting for a show about side quests is tight
"He's from all of it!" Killed me.
Ok, that was damn funny.  Great work, as always fella -
i don't think there aren't much honest people like ryan left in meda industry criticzing the plotholes and retardness shoved down our throat. Great content as usual.
disney cares about us, you can see it. I don't get all the hate on disney
Lol. Hey shut up
Loved this one!
This is no joke the whole show. Mandalorian is not good Star Wars content. It’s very very lazy, but those jangling keys and flashy lights are all Disney needs to make people love it.
You didn't mention that the Dark Troopers are from that old Star Wars game Dark Forces.
Passion of the Christ
1:16 I want more of Therapy Guy.
Luv the new characters :-)
We need a maze runner pitch
NGL, I legit expected this Mandalorian Pitch Meeting to just stop being one, and we follow the Producer Guy on his journey of self-discovery and acceptance of his money-grubbing ways for 99% of the video, when it just ends with a Headline about how popular Baby Yoda was. (The joke being how Baby Yoda stole the show from Mando so much, that learning about the plot didn't matter anymore)
Unrelated, Google might have a sentient AI. So... yeah.
This is by far is my favorite one yet. His "Wow Wow Wow" gets me everytime
Please do Scott pilgrim vs the world! XD
They were doing good with promoting Disney plus and then sabotaged themselves by supporting suppremist politics.  Ryan is trying to help them but Disney has sure made his work difficult.  The self destructive bent in the USA is a detriment.
Awesome! Now Book of Boba Fett and the first season of Marvel Studios’ What If? Thanks for listening to my suggestion!
fantastic
Yoo the first few minutes of this was GOLDEN!! My dude put a whole storyline into this 🤣🤣. We need more of this 👌🏽
"with arms wide open"  Best line yet 😄
I'd love to see a Pitch Meeting for  film that does it all right.  "So this movie's...kinda perfect?"  "Yeah, yeah, yeah"  "Oh Perfect Movies are tight"  "Yes sir they are!"
BillBurian would've been better...
A Willy's Wonderland would be hilarious
almost lost me by dragging out that one joke for the first 1/3 of the video...
Producer guy now has more character development than Mando nice one! 👍
Jesus, people still enjoy watching annoying videos? Wow, humans suck at life
I was surprised you didn’t make any jokes about Cara Dune being written off
“HE’S FROM ALL OF IT!” 😂😂😂
The problem was they recreated the original Star Wars merch issue they had in the 70s, where people wanted toys, but they could not produce them in time for the holiday season, so they essentially had to sell preorders.
Do obi wan. Best star wars series ever
I usually only like Pitch Meetings for shows and movies that I have watched or am interested in watching, but this was awesome, side quest and all.
so much meta humor going on on this video, i love it. and a great description of season 1: side quest the series, and season 2: side quests that lead to a spin off.
I don't comment much on youtube, but this here was an ingenious bit of comedy. Pitch meetings are already some of the funniest things in the internet, but I do believe that this episode was the best episode of pitch meetings yet. Incredibly layered, every line tightly crafted joke, and an expansion of this crazy logical universe. We ,might be entering the MCU of Pitch Meetings!
Loved the little side story with Producer Guy!
"He's aaaa Bostonian." "Oh I love science fiction"
I absolutely admire your ability to keep Pitch Meetings fresh for so long.
This may be old news to everyone else but OMG pitch meetings are now finally on their own channel, we've been asking for this for so long!
Do 'It's Always Sunn'!
The face scan was the last straw for me with this show. First HTF was someone from what is basically Space Amish with Guns™ who go out of their way to not be in government data bases even IN an imperial data base? Second WTF did he have a security clearance? At best he'd be listed in there as a contractor
Disney + algorithm/droid joke was f*cking on point. So, SO good. All your pitches are right but this was pinnacle... Thank you!
I love the "man-dough" joke , and the addition of these characters approaching this subject in such a way, where cartoon effects are real life issues, is your best step forward I've ever seen. 🤣🤣🤣
Everything everywhere all at once please!!
Pitch “Men” but have all the characters in the pitch meeting have the same face. It’ll be weirdly unsettling.
"WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN!"  Nailed no notes
Producer Guy: "With arms wide open! That's my Creed!" Lmfao I about died!
He didn't mention that Baby Yoda actually isn't a baby Yoda.
Best pitch meeting ever!!!
This escalated so fast...
do "the boys" already!!! it would a fantastical convivence !!!
Producer Guy's tongue gonna turn green next. 🤑
Ryan can you do a pitch meeting for Fast and furious Tokyo drift.
"WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN...!". That's my Creed!  haha!
Bro went to group therapy!! 😂 I’m done
Kinda overdid with the dollar sign joke there.
Must've been nice to not be spoiled by the fact that another country got to watch the show months before you could
A red headed, freckled “ Bostonian” at that. Wow wow wow….wow.
Creating a world like Michael Keaton in “Multiplicity”is TIGHT. So.. “she touched your PEPPY Steve?” Yes sir, she did”.
Well, this is new and great and different and perfect and spot on and thank you.
Please do a pitch meeting for the new chip n' dale movie! 👏👏
Please do a Stranger Things season 4 SR!  Also Jurassic World: Dominion would be tight!
I had high hopes when Disney purchased star wars.  I thought they had good writers.  Lol no.
Is there a Magic Mike Pitch Meeting, I kinda wanna see it hahahaha, I loved the honest trailer of it, I would love to see a Pitch Meeting.
The little self discovery of Mr. Producer is so good (≧▽≦)
Just watched Jurrasic World Dominion and I can't wait for the pitch meeting for that one.
I made my sister watch this one even when she has seen zero star wars nothing because she kinda hates it, but she laughed so hard at the baby Yoda joke. It was so funny.  ps: sometimes when we are watching a movie or a series and they do something really stupid we look at each other and say "because I wrote it, here".
Ok seriously, why no Peacemaker pitch meeting?
Please do one for top gun maverick and maybe do one with top gun
The guy in therapy saying "my jaw dropped in a way that should've dislocated it" is not insane, he is Jim Carrey
Please do a Pitch Meeting for the Original Silent Pictures! First guy to pitch a motion picture!
Hey can you do a pitch on agents of shield?
Bostonian
With arms wide open, that's my Creed too. One of the better bands of the '90s. Don't know why they get a bad rep nowadays
funny!!!
Rhe producer has a better story arc than, Boba Fett, Kenobi, Falcon/Winter Soldier, Ms Marvel Etc..
Totally not awkward
Dollar signs in the eye
Really good episode 🙂 can you please do The Expendables or 2 or 3? 🙏
every time i watch a pitch meeting i have to resubscribe because the last pitch meeting told me to hit the subscribe button but i was already subscribed so then it unsubscribed me! 😓
Did you also dive in a pool made of money
"with arms wide open!" Literal spit take for me. Damnit, lol
Anyone that said Ryan George can only act 'weird people that don't know how to talk' (paraphrased) needs to see this.
Such a heroic decision it must have been to forego merchandising to avoid spoilers. Such a shame it went completely to waste when the entire internet was covered with Baby Yoda images literally everywhere on day one.
How did you two meet?
Wow, Pitch Meeting channel! Pitch meetings are tight! They are from the other thing and this makes me like them! I guess it was pretty hard to get its own channel, right?
Excessive thumb gesticulation is TIGHT!
Creed references are tight!
Love the new characters
Best pitch meeting ever!
What in the hell is a "baby"?
Garbage bin bathroom 😆 💩
Thanks loved it!
I truly believe that before studios invest millions of dollars in producing a movie, the script should be handed to Ryan.  Why?  To spot the plot holes.  Not to correct or rewrite, just report.  A pre-production Pitch Meeting,  if you will.
"UHHH, a Bostonian?" Living in Boston Mayfeld is a Bostonian x10. lol
Hey can u guys do like a behind the scenes video or a blooper video
Please can you do a pitch meeting for Everything Everywhere All at Once? 🙏😊
please do morbius rerelease
Wow! The mandalorian is the best as boba fett
Wow. Gina Carano is even cancelled from Pitch Meetings. That’s some far reaching consequences right there.
This was such a ride.
All the great and smart jokes aside, what makes me appreciate Ryan very much is that whenever I thought he's at his best, somehow he manages to surpass himself constantly, pushing the quality even higher and surprises me with unexpected brillant details every time.
Where do you get that coat from, been searching everywhere haha
Such a smartly written sketch, hats off to Ryan!
What about an „Ambulance“ pitch Meeting? 😄
I feel the need for an "Everything Everywhere All At Once" pitch meeting.  Just because I'd love to see Screenwriter Guy try to explain it...  It could also be part of his character that he thinks putting everything on a bagel would literally cause reality to fall apart!
Please do clue the movie
This one took an unnecessary three minute turn.
Jurassic Park Dominion could be a 30min pitch meeting😂
personal growth that reaffirms character flaws in only 3 days is TIGHT!
OMG The Producer guy having character development is AMAZING
That chest thump the producer does after singing Creed sounds so good!
hey shutup
Im so proud of producer guy for learning to love himself
The Range. Thanks therapist guy.
Is Peaky blinders big enough to get a pitch meeting?
By far the best one ever
Loved Producer Guy's hero's journey! Now we need his origin story.
A baby YODA?!! CHA CHING!! 🤑😆
Have you done a stranger things episode? I feel like there are a lot of moments that don’t always make sense.
Completely hilarious pitch meeting with some great extension
Shudda had him dressed as Mickey Mouse...
A baby Yoda $$$$😂😂😂
holy heckfire best pitch meeting ever.
The Man DeLorean about John DeLorean and his 88 mph time travel vehicle. Cool.
Morbius re-release pitch meeting next?
What kind of creature is it?  A Bostonian.  That had me dead.
"And jaw dropped to the point that should have dislocated it' lmao 🤣🤣
That part with cash signs in your eyes was so annoying. What a waste of 3 minutes
The$e 1977-? GLD$ kind@ h@rd to under$t@nd $unce 1980 https://youtu.be/tQvmAL0YER4 comp@red to $t@nd@l0ne 2003 KOTOR One G@me https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL90YOFBe2p0yZGo-1MsJE41f1bY9fS2oG
Producer guy having side quests during pitch meeting is tight!
crazy part I was thinking he did not catch up all the way up and then I realized that all happened in boba lol
How did they not make any jokes about the Gina Carano controversy? lol
I just realized that in the writer guys room there is a blurred picture of Ryan. I love the attention to detail.
-what kind of creature is he? -he's a Bostonian XD
Hi
Even Pitch Meetings has an extended universe.
7:07, I mean for the imperials reasonably speaking at that point in time they might simply not have the budget for more complicated security, so, just have the scanners verify the one using the terminal is human/not on any wanted lists and I supposed they'd simply turn it off when there weren't a hundred other imperials around who would notice when someone who didn't belong shows up.
great video man these always give me a good chuckle, you should do one for the book of eli
Brilliant!
Hollywood has gotten so dumb that your parodies feel more like reality tv these days.
Do Idiocracy!!!
Wait. So Baby Yoda is not Yoda as a baby?
The Skywalkers are StarWars.
lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cool pitch meeting! Grogu is just so adorable! I've been fighting the urge not to buy any Grogu merchandise. :)
Overdoing it with the dollar sign eyeballs aren't they... quite a crew for this pitch 👏
The CREED part damn near killed me.
do book of boba fett!
Them holding off on the mercy paid off.  I have 2 Yoda POP figures (one has the soup) and a giant plushy/pillow.  I don’t own other merch. Got it for my partner. I’ve seen so much merch of his it’s hilarious.
Stranger things season 3 pitch meeting?
This is hilarious 😂 I love this shtick
Everything, Everywhere, All it Once.   Either make it or send me to the universe where it has.
*CHA CHING!* $.$
Tex Avery Syndrome is little discussed. thank you for highlighting it.
The thumbnail looks like a baby Sleestak from The Land of the Lost tv series, kinda creepy.
Pitch meeting for* infinite *movie it's a mark Wahlberg movie
My one issue is that it was TOO successful, and now Disney tries to force the concept on practically every single one of their other Star Wars projects. For the Bad Batch it’s Omega, and now in Obi-Wan Kenobi it’s Leia. Not to mention shoehorning in Mando and Grogu to The Book of Boba Fett and bringing them together again, which is gonna make it really weird in the future when people go from Season 2 to Season 3.
Mandalor the Great would be ashamed
I'm not about to say that this video was genius, but if ungenious is a word then this video was the complete opposite of that.
If only a droid seen Mando's face then why didn't he just kill the droid and be move on? Also how does a droid count as a living thing. It's not human. So who cares? Who's gonna find out. And it was a life or death situation anyway. So I think he should be allowed to remove his helmet in that instance. Ya know?  Speaking of helmets, Master Chief never wears his helmet in the new Halo TV series, which I highly recommend you avoid because it's worst TV series ever created... 😤
This just show how even a simple Yt'er (okay, maybe a pretty close to comedic genius one), can write better for a simple sketch (okay, maybe a rather well thought out one); than people who are wrtiting for huge franchises...
Do a pitch for The Boys on Amazon Prime
“He’s from all of it!”  :-D
411 people must have skipped the side quests
Noticed how the catch phrases here rely on calling God's Name in vain :/ otherwise a great show
technically the short form should be manda not mando
WITH ARMS RIGHT OPAHN
I just wanna see a pitch meeting for literally any Tarantino movie
If you're up to the challenge do EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONE
I find it frustrating with the pace of the Mandolorian show as it has too many repetitive side quests that doesn’t move the plot along with very little pay off or stakes… do you think they will ever kill off Mando or baby Yoda or anyone you care about??? No. If you like baby yoda like me just youtube the Baby Yoda scenes and save hours of your life.
Wow that was the best Pitch Meeting ever, this one is for the history books
1:21- when the therapist with glasses doesn't believe a witness with glasses... Man I love these irony jokes
With arms wide open!😂😂😂😂
8:08 What? But money? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
This is Pitch Meetings " The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent" ..
Meh
Ka-Ching !
I loved this so much
Maybe you just really like money... and maybe that's okay. lol
These movies need a pitch meeting: The Eraser, Reign of Fire, The Gentlemen
Ryan George may just become Everything, Everywhere, All at Once if he keeps this up.  That's my weird way of saying you should do Everything, Everywhere, All at Once, please!
“He’s from all of it!” That line nearly killed my gf and me. Had to pause while we laughed so hard we actually choked.
We need someone to make a Creed cover with this guy!
You should do Cool World. Such a weird movie
THERE IS NO BABY YODA ONLY GROGU
Ayy I just finished watching the mandalorian
FOUR STARS
WITH ARMS WIDE OPAAAN
Okay... Bostonian made me laugh.
wowza
I'll guarantee it was the target is a Jedi Youngling.. Kennedy and her brown noser Pascal were like naaaah Let's rape yoda we haven't yet
Completely side-stepped the Ashoka stuff
“And rebels” I- *Inner pain*
Hear me out, Live Action Cat in the Hat Pitch Meeting
The pitch meeting became a ryanverse video for a little part. Crossover 🤞🤞
Classic request...  Gremlins.  Pretty please.
That group therapy did it for me 😂😂😂
Just when I think this formula is getting tired you pull this stuff!!! It's pretty good stuff😂
"Hi, I'm Mr. Producer Guy and I really love money."
Came for a Mando pitch meeting, stayed for therapy
Can we get these over to tik tok so i do not have to use my finger to touch my screen and open a SECOND app. Btw, I watch P.M.s more than once, so if they pop in my tik tok feed multiple times that is ok :)
A side quest in a Pitch Meeting about side quests 😂 This one-ups your Moon Knight video when you made fun of shows where the same actor talks to themself playing different characters. I'll be laughing at this all day.
lakaka
This was awesome. Best pitch meeting yet. Laughed out loud multiple times. Keep it up
I feel like a separate Season 1 and Season 2 pitch meeting would have been better. It feels like we were just bouncing around story plots. Also I wanted some Cara Dune jokes lol
Just wow.
Knock the side quests all you want, but the best parts of a lot of adventures are in fact the side quests.
5:17 oy, Producer Guy has the kind of musical taste I should have expected.
Would love to see a pitch meeting for Masters of the Universe(1987).
need pitch meeting for The Boys!
Did you just dissect a frog without killing it?  Meta, my dude.
OMFG WITH ARRRRRRMS WIDE OPEN!!!!!
the cast is getting bigger and bigger,  pitch meeting just be making bank.
So when arms wide opon came out, I totally sang along and exasperated opon as I sang it in Chicago traffic. Q101. Epic nostalgia lol
the only good star wars series
I should have told my boss to shut up. lol  Good video.
Just checks if you have a face 😂
Producer guy going on a side quest to self discovery & acceptance that he loves money is TIGHT!
With arms wide open 😂😂
What's the guitar tune that plays while Ruan's out checking about his cash register eyes?
That Creed reference got me giggling hard 🤣
HE'S FROM ALL OF IT! XD
I lost my shit when he started singing Creed...xD
Holy crap I just noticed that Producer Guy didn't say the standard "Hi there, hello" greeting in the group therapy scene!
I wasn't prepared for Mr. Producer Guy's character arc, but I'm here for it! Such an incredible road to self discovery - and STILL he agreed to no baby Yoda merch T^T
Can't express how much joy this video brought me. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy ALL the pitch meetings. But you really put in extra on this one. Thank you for these, especially this one. Great job!!!
The League of Extraordinary Gentleman would be a good one to do
WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN! UNDERR THE SUNLIGHT!
Is there a pitch meeting for The Martian?
you should do labyrinth think of all the content there
Do Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children!
Im a baby joda
Mando something sounds really subliminal if you think about it lando it really says some sad things where this lando plot would be lando in the future I mean we won't know lando until they do it lando kind of sad if you think about it I really hope I'm wrong though lando would be just way too contained and not have enough consumer appeal
I went from “ok this is going a little too long” to “oh wait will he ever find answers????”
I had a hard time finding this channel. I unsubbed from Screen Rant, and if you search for "Pitch Meeting" there is so much bullshit in the way that it never comes up.
Top gun pitch meeting please!
Did the Book of Mando ever show how or that Boba lost his armor and the the sheriff dude picked it up?
It was the dollar signs for me🤣🤣🤣
I love Sci/Fi
4:26 BASED ON THE COMIC BOOK BY Robert Kirkman、Cory Walker、＆Ryan Ottley
Im praying for producer guy 🙏🏾
Mandough 😂
"HE'S FROM ALL OF IT"
There was lack of baby Yoda merch?? You'd never know now
The Ryanverse is slowly expanding  In a few years we'll all be Ryan
this might even be the best pitch meeting....EVER
I wonder what a "pretty woman" looks like in the universe where everyone looks like Ryan George
Just saved me 3 seasons of TV watching.  Thanks!!
you should do a pitch meeting for karate kid 1,2,3 and cobra kai please
can you do Jurassic world dominion
I only realised at the end of the video that the main character went on a side quest that was barely related to the main plot, while also having recurring characters from "other things".
3:35 A what?
I thought Yoda was about 900 years old in ROTJ, so how does Luke Sky Walker turn up in a show where Yoda is a baby?
"And what kind of creature is he?" "He's aaaa Bostonian."   🤣😂🤣😂  Wicked awesome!
Pitch Meeting for 'The Green Book' would be really dope
Baby yoda looks like Stewie Griffin
Producer: So you have a new Star Wars show for me? Writer: Yes sir, I do. Producer: Oh God, why won't the pain stop? Please make it stop!!!
This Pitch Meeting felt like a Ryan George Skit. All of you should work with him, I think your humor would line up - and you two look alike! Like you guys could definitely be cousins, maybe, I decided.
Wow. Just wow. This is why I'm subscribed.
Yo Dawg, I heard you like side quests in your things you watch, so I put a side quest in the thing you watch about the thing you watch with side quests in it.
Wow. This took a very pleasant yet unexpected turn with the character development. I've no real desire to see this show as I expect such and have for years.
Tale of Tales Pitch Meeting
Proof they're different people -one says garbage can, one says garbage bin.
"But my money"
I was very confused about why they waited a year to release baby Yoda stuff since it wouldn't have ruined the show and since the show came out around November. In hindsight they should have waited till December.
Please make a pitch meeting for "the boys"
Please do a pitch meeting for Hackers!
🤑 0:28    💩 3:11    🤣 6:40
Worst pitch yet
bro really said ahsoka is from rebels
Best. Meeting. Ever.
"He's from all of it!"
This is an emotional rollercoaster! Loved it! 🤣🤣🤣❤️
Mr Producer guy and Scrooge McDuck share a similar money complex😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😊
I had a likely impossible Pitch Meeting idea. A pitch meeting for the very platform your videos are posted on... YOUTUBE!!   Would that be breaking the 4th wall? 🤔
Best Pitch Meeting ever!
Loved this one
The Mandalorian is literally my favourite show since Stranger Thing's....And there's alot nowadays
Please, do a pitch meeting for The Witcher and for Outlander!
I've been going through a pretty tough time, and this really made me laugh and cheer up. Thank you, Ryan!!
Oh Wow oh wow wow wow wow this went into a direction I didn't expect at first.
Objection, non responsive XD
5:15 - Never thought a creed joke could be so hilarious.
Oh my God one of the best for sure. Glad producer guy got over his identity crisis
Why can't you grow a normal grown-up beard?
Stealing "Obviously not relevant to what I has talking about"
We need a Pitch meeting for "AI - Artifical intelligence"
Kung Fu Panda pitch meeting soon?
you should do a pitch meeting for A Serbian Film
We really got a "Mask" reference in this video?  Did I miss why this is?
wow ryan, Ithat was an outstanding episode! side quests are tight!
I feel a sudden urge to like this video after that end  credit scene...not sure why....
61k person to like this video lol!!!!
With arms wide ooohhhpaaannn
Hey, shut up, AOOOOGAH!
Why is this video late? It should’ve come up after season 1
omfg its it did didn't it!
Baby Yoda is taking to be trained by Luke Skywalker, huh, I have a faint memory saying the opposite
"Bostonian"
Lol father figger
“He’s from all of it!!!”
Pitch maker… what a joke
The creed reference made my day!! Favorite band when I was a young teenager! "With arms wide open!"
"With arms wide open"....LMAO!
Do HALO Master Cheecks!!
You should do the boys S1 and S2
It's kind of funny how they brought up a Disney+ AI in the episode, cuz I feel like the Obi Wan show was written by and actual robot that was lobotomized after being shown the first star wars movie in slo motion
So Jedi Master Yoda trains Luke but Luke rescues Mando/baby Yoda... 😕😵🤕
Was not expecting an extra Ryan George sketch in the middle of a Pitch Meeting. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
That was a good bit :)
That's my Creed, too!
Amazing!
The lore thickens
Hey Ryan, would love to see you do the recent planet of the apes trilogy.
Pitch meetings for games and their ways to rip money off
Why don't you do Bollywood movies  I.e. - RRR, KGF, BAHUBALI BEGINING, BAHUBALI CONCLUSION, ROBOT, I
Well that took a turn
He's on weed
there're now new characters to pitch meeting, that being doctor guy, therapist guy and support group counselor guy
All the Ryan cameos! I love it
I wasnt sure if pitch meeting was in the Ryan verse........ Now i know they are.
Writer: "we decided to recalibrate the Stormtrooper's weapons to actually hit someone this time" ...  Producer: "So why did they not do that earlier?".....   Writer: " I need you to get ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL THE WAY OF MY BACK ABOUT THAT!!!"
Dude, pretty cool! Don’t you watch the boys series? It’s incredible awesome and I’d love to see your pitch netting for it.
Spectacular! The way you think makes me happy! Let's do a collab together, like an actual pitch meeting of my new comic books to pitch them into a movies, that would be so such a fun video.
He's uuh Bostonian  Oh, I love science fiction!
Except that Ahsoka  originally from Star Wars the Clone Wars
That is a baby sleestak
Please do an invincible pitch meeting
Please make Thomas and the manic railroad pitch meeting please
Grogu
EPIC.  The best one yet.  This is the way.
Ryan George you are killing it
It’s a shame I can only like this video once
How did Ryan find money in the budget for all these new actors and backgrounds?
This was an amazing pitch meeting. It even had a whole side quest
XDDDDDDD
At this point I just read the comments to see what jokes flew over my head.
So much character growth!
only ryan can fit an entire season in a 8 min video. love it.
So, grown adults who can drive and vote, actually watch this Mandalorian shite?
I am happy that therapist guy exist.
Wait... Luke was trained by Yoda, how can he now train baby Yoda?
pitch meeting for top gun maverick
pitch meeting for the adam project
I'm so glad pitch meeting has its own channel, so I can finally unsubscribe from screen rant.
I’m glad you finally made a Mandalorian Pictish Meeting! I thought you weren’t going to make one!
Best pitch meeting ever
wasn't really funny.
well this went off on a strange tangea..ouch did i just bump my head ??Wh...why??Why are there twetting birds flying around my head..hey wait a minute i have to see a doctor theres a huge angry red lump pointing out of my skull that cant be right...
“That’s my creed!” I immediately initiated nasal singing!
This is by far the best pitch meeting you have made!
"It's gonna be big learning point for him you know it's okay to fully put your faith in artificial intelligence, our disney plus algorithm has been suggesting we start pushing that kind of message"  My best line of this pitch meeting 🤣🤣😹
Do Jupiter Ascending!!
That was such an epic plot twist at the end
I love the change of script
I would love to see casa de papel (money heist).
Writers during first season: "please stop calling him Baby Yoda"  The audience: "but you never told us the baby's name for the whole 1st season so we gave the baby a name"  The writers: "wait for the second season and then we'll say the baby's name, just please stop calling the baby, "BaBy YoDa".  Audience: "No"
I just love Katee Sackhoff 😍, Bo-Katan definitely should get her own show
Wait baby yoda is trained by luke lol wtf
Could you do Equilibrium? :D
First one ever I’d call just okay. The Mando pitch was a hoot. Just could have done without the personal growth side quest.
32 on trending lol. Love the work you do Ryan love seeing the character developments, watching these characters, and this environment just expanding
Do Mission Impossible
Still freaking funny.
Dude… Ryan.. our crazy Canadian guy……. This has to be one of your best pitch meetings yet. And I do love them so much already, but this one.. had me dyyying. I thought about “creed” right before producer guy said that and my mouth literally fell open. Thank you for being such a cool bro and some an awesome writer. you’re the best :D
Ryan should do his own Youtube Rewind where he's all the Youtubers.
I love your hair style, Screen Writer Guy! ❤ Producer Guy, I don't know what were you thinking LOL 😂
yo the side quest was cray cray but a little too long, like an snl sketch that doesn't know when to end. excellent episode overall. cool twist at the end with the non-cow-milking-move by Disney
7:35 🫵🏻 HE'S FROM ALL OF IT lmfaooo
Great video. I would have also loved a meta joke about how Pitch Meeting has split off to become its own channel like Disney+. Ungodly merchandising opportunities is tight.
Can I just say, I don't think a "cash register" has made that noise in about 25 years. Shouldn't we acknowledge that?
"He's from all of it" 🤣
Watching those videos dissect a show I like and point out every inconsistencies I missed is quite the humbling experience. 😄
character development
This was frickin hilarious!
Producer Guy and Screenwriter Guy both got nice haircuts. They must go to the same Barber; what a coincidence!  I LOVE how long this one was, and the crazy tangent it went on. 😂
I love the internal conflict in this one
So cool to see that this is on trending! These pitch meetings keep getting better and better
Ok.... I lost on the Creed bit. 🤣🤣😭😭💀💀 Damnit Ryan!
The tangent he goes on before the show summary is two minutes long
Then freakin luke skywalker is gonna show up and destroy them all Producer guy: HE'S FROM ALL OF IT
¨They are pushing the message of trusting in AI very aggressively¨ LOL yep. Very astute!
A whole new channel just for Pitch Meetings??? Also can we make fun of Book of Boba Fett.
Mr. Producer Guy > Any other fictional characters development
Character development. World expansion. The plot thickens.......
Love the journey. Well done.
I like how half the video is a regular Ryan George episode
This was some wild and gratifying cross over from Ryan’s personal channel and Pitch meetings and I loved it so much!!
Ryan your content is awesome but, you really need to make a pitch meeting for the CW show Gotham knights
With arms waad oppan.... That's my creed 😂
I'm gonna need you to get aaall the way off my back about $$ signs in my eyes
This was hilarious but come on, The Mandalorian was awesome. I thought this was widely accepted 🤔
Baby Yoda broke producer guy
No, that's not okay. That's capitalism - the disease that's ruining EVERYTHING!
No intro?
Do Mamoru Hosodas Belle
Yeah producer guy just loves money obviously
I love how this one takes a totally different turn XD
Oh my, the entire Ryanverse in one non-Ryan George channel video? What an epic crossover
1:31 it's okay as long as your head doesn't turn into a wolf's head. That's like the last stage.
The subscriber to viewer ratio is mwah, chefs kiss 💋 🤌. So many channels have millions of subscribers but barley averages 100k a vid. Nce to see the channel over achieve in that respect as I thought would happen when I’ve been begging for them to have a separate pitch meeting channel for years lol. In YouTube land as of this moment, consistent viewership is key, even if it outweighs your subscriber count.
Ah, bill burr, the great Bostonian!!!
Waiting for the Star Wars extended universe canon to include Bostonians.
C:
You should do one on Logan's Run. I'm seeing it right now and ten minutes in the premise is "no one under 30 is aloud to be alive" but the main cast is clearly in their late 30's or early 40's.
I want sex and money. And that's okay. Grant Goble is a great resource for all types of business professionals who use the internet.
Ah man, this was great! Just a level above and beyond, and that's really saying something with how good Pitch Meeting already is. Well done!
It will be a challenge I think (because its one of the few perfect movies I have seen) but if you can pull of Eternal Sunshine, I would be amazed.  Love your channel!
"He's from all of it!" Loved that hahaha
Can we get a pitch meeting for the Bible?
I’ve been asked to request you do 365 Days. I’d like you to do the original Willow or Top Gun.
Producer Guy has more character development and back story than all the side characters in these Star Wars shows combined. RIP Wade.
This is the greatest pitch meeting yet. I laughed so hard I may have peed a little. Not a lot obviously, but enough where I can’t say it didn’t happen.
I think Ryan should do a series of classic 80s movies like Ghostbusters, Police Academy, Terminator, Aliens, Revenge of the Nerds, Top Gun, etc....
the moment when Producer Guy have better story developement than any other movie character now a days.
You have outdone yourself this one was great.
It is not everybody who can create a whole new genre of comedy video but for Ryan, Pitch Meeting was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
I hated this show so much!  I was hoping for a zinger about how he can never take his helmet off but he does take his helmet off all the time.  At least I got to hear those dumb plot holes. I thought my waning attention was making it hard to follow, but no. Was really that stupid.
I really appreciate them showing us producers guys journey. It was very compelling (and funny too!!🤣)😂.
We need to make the producer guy going cha-Ching an actual mercy option
Love the character building arc for the producer guy, but turns out we already knew about that part of the character, so I guess no character building was done. Therefore the character building arc storyline was a bit pointless, just like this comment that you are reading. I wasted your time.
Best Pitch Meeting? The Twilight series, hands down! (Actually, I love them all).
"Hey, shut up..." 🤣😂
This is the best pitch meeting yet. It was so funny. I love the other characters that popped up. Other characters show up again
When are you going to do Encanto?
Oh the inexplicable presence of Verner Herzog is TIGHT.
Just skip to 3:08
Deep blue sea
Love that you referred to Migs Mayfeld as a Bostonian when Producer Guy asks what type of alien/character he is...  Bill Burr would be proud.  😀
We need a feature length movie staring only Ryan playing all the characters ✌️
I smirked until the " Arms Wide Opeeeenn" and I laughed out loud.
Inconsequential side quests involving character growth and impossibly impressive computer effects, but which are irrelevant to the overall plot of Pitch Meetings ARE TIGHT.
hi
LOL!!!
The mini movie was THE BEST, now I need more of those
Well Done! That’s in your top 5
what a great video. wow wow wow wow wow..... wow
I just... can't with all of this Distar Neywars hot garbo anymore. It's like a sewage pipe filled with 'shiny things' is just shatting out blorp after blurp after blork of bollocks and banality. No thanks; the world already makes me sick as it is.  Also, Wonder Women: 1984 was awful, and I (unfortunately?) don't see the appeal of that actor (Pedro? Or something like that). Also, also, although it was neat to see Giancarlo from BB... yikes. He doesn't really fit in to the SW universe. Kinda like Carano. Kinda like Bill Burr, lol. 🤔  🐲✨🐲✨🐲✨
I love how the first 3 minutes of the pitch meeting is that Ryan was just talking about how he likes money so much, that’s totally Disney, on point!
The Creed joke killed me lmao
Top work from Ryan.  I've never seen this show but now I don't have to.
the baby yoda reveal was well worth disney losing a few short term millions
HE'S from ALL of it!
Finally have confirmation that Producer Guy loves money. This has big implications for the lore; time to update the wiki
I love the twist in the format. Great episode
“He’s from all of it!” Indeed he is
THE WORLD NOW DEMANDS A RYAN GEORGE COVER FOR ""ARMS WIDE OPEN"... That would be TIGHT. 😁👍
Please don't make that skit in the middle a regular thing but having said that good episode
Next Pitch Meeting Suggestions: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2014 TMNT- Out Of The Shadows  Norm Of The North  Kung Fu Panda  Amphibia  Owl House  The Book Of Life  Maya and the Three  Ice Age  Encanto  Raya and The Last Dragon  Turning Red
Merchandising opportunities are tight!
Let's see a pitch meeting for Idiocracy.
yeah yeah yeah!!
Great tangent, bravo
"You pronounced 'Dim Droids' wrong!"
You should do a pitch meeting on Eragon!
Dune pitch meeting please
Producer guy going on a journey of self-discovery about the physcial manifestation of his love of money in the middle of a Pitch Meeting for the Mandalorian wasn't what I expected today but it *was* what I needed.
This may have been the best PM yet...
5:17 Nice.
Baby Yoda 💶💶💶💰 💰 💰 💴 💴 💵 💴 💵 💸💸💸
Most hilarious  pitch meeting yet
the hat budget on this episode was crazy.
The new orville season is pushing 'trust AI' very hard too. I fast forward thru it, it gives me the creeps.
OMG!! The dollar sign eyeball bit alone is worth every view this video gets, LMAO
This pitch meeting was better than the Mandalorian
I don’t know how it would work, but I’d like to see a pitch meeting for This Is Us. “It’s gonna be tough for them to get out of that!” “Actually they won’t because everything about this is designed to make you cry.” “Aw, making people cry is tight.”
Knives out pls
Oohhhh Producer Guy finding himself and accepting the fact that he loves money is TIGHT!!!
LMFAO 3:22 is when they actually talk about the plot I love it
I thought we were gonna see the cha-ching dollar-eyes again when he mentioned all the spin-offs. But honestly, this whole vid was friggin hilarious on so many levels.
Wtf
Baby Yoda ate baby frogs....
"He's from all of it!" He sure is, Mr. Producer guy. Ray skywalker is not all the jedi, luke skywalker is.
Algorithm
one word: LORE
Best one I’ve seen.
i honestly dont understand this, sure you cant make a company hold merch untill your project is done, but why cant they enforce that they do not advertise it in fairs and release it LATE to stores ?
"So I have this show idea where I make fun of movies in pop culture" "That's great, audiences love that"  "and I'm also gonna push the envelope of comedy in new creative and unexpected ways" "What... but you don't have to do that " "Yeah.... but I'm going to" "Ok then"
CREED!!!!!
Possibly your best episode yet! Loved the self discovery skit. More of that!
I love your stuff but to not even mention her character was rough… she exists man and she was a fan favorite
0:50, best I don't know ever
Mr Producer had a better character arc in one minute than Boba Fett thro9ughout the entire series
So I'm watching this with my stuffed baby Yoda on the shelf and somehow I feel part of this skit now. :-) Brilliant! Please do Obi-Wan and Boba Fett. There is so much there your scripts will write themselves....
"He's from all of it!" XD
2 episodes in 1 day!!? What is this!?!? Obi-wan!?
this video was glorious
This show was weird cause it felt well made but I just didn’t care
WOW! t=I honestly did not expect Pitch Meeting to take such a new and fun and amazing turn all of a sudden. You are a really talented and creative guy Ryan, don't you forget that.
The producer guy side quest was great but the Creed joke was just... perfection.
so you have another pitch meeting for me?
We need a new channel - Ryan Support Group Meetings
I really hope he does a Bollywood pitch meeting for RRR
I didn't think Grogu's eyes could get any better but Pitch Meeting delivers!
awesome video!
More character growth from Producer Guy than what I've seen in main characters from Disney in the last 3 years.
This is the best Pitch Meeting yet, for sure. Died laughing here.
I honestly think they just straight up actually didn’t have any idea how valuable baby yoda would be as a merchandizing oppurtunity until it took off
Well best one yet, this is amazing
I think the dollar sign skit went on a bit too long but apart from that it was great.
The really unbelievable thing is that Producer Guy was able to get a doctors visit, a therapy appointment, and join a self help group in 3 days. Must be that Canadian health care system.
What happened to the noise even the video starts? I miss it!
Screen writer guy: "we have to hold baby Yoda merchandise because of the experience sir!" Producer guy: "hmmm. I hate to say this but okay" Screen writer guy: "That's some costly character growth right there sir"
"Oh ho what kind of creature is he?" "Ah, uhh, he's a Bostonian" "Ohh, I love science fiction!"
jesus. "with arms wide open" i've never laughed so hard!
I’ve requested this pitch meeting on the other channel like 2 years ago, I’m so glad to finally see it!
THE GROUP THERAPIST IS THE PERVERT THAT DESIGNED PUBLIC BATHROOMS!
There was a therapy session in the pitch meeting, ultimate pitch meeting
Man, this went on a tangent... just like The Mandalorian 😮...🤭
Building a pitch meeting cinematic universe must’ve be hard, actually…
(Agree) Pitch Meetings for Who Framed Roger Rabbit (with a reference to the fact it will one day end up on Disney Plus) and Spy Kids ...just the first one or the first trilogy as aren't there 5 of them?!
This might be the best pitch meeting so far 😂
I totally thought the Producer Guys story was just leading to a joke where it ended with Physcyotrist Guy listening to him talk about his issues, and the joke is he gets dollar sign/cha-ching himself.
The Creed reference alone earned my like and sub
"Wouldn't it be easier to take the armor off the Marshall instead of Mandalorian warrior?"  "Hey, shut up..."
The Bostonian line sent me, not gonna lie…
I still want you do Alice in wonderland pitch meeting just to producer guy say "rabbits hole are..." and assistsnt say "no sir, please dont..." and producer "rabbits hole are tight".
Another GREAT pitch!!! You're so awesome at what you do. When a new movie or show is coming out, I'm excited for your pitch meeting. I know for sure it will be more entertaining than the actual movie. Can do a pitch meeting for Micheal Bays Armageddon and a pitch meeting or meetings for the first 3 Spy Kids movies, please. Thank you.
Wow wow wow               ...wow.
at the moment that producer guy figured out how much money he will make... nothing can phase him.
With arms wide open!
Some may say you went too far for that dollar sign gag. Those people are what I like to call idiots.
Do dracula untold
Unexpected journeys of Self-discovery are TIGHT!!!
The cartoon thing made me want a Who Framed Roger Rabbit pitch meeting
Nah. Love "Pitch Meeting" but I ain't watching this this one. You ain't ruining "The Mandolorian" for me the way you did "Avengers: Endgame" - Nope.
One of the best pitch meetings you've made...
He's from all of it!
The Wee-Baby Yoda is by far one of the most brilliant creations of the last 30 years.
Another amazing Pitch Meeting 👍🤩
I feel when you made the creed joke you were screaming inside 'I hope someone remembers them and gets this joke' :D
Three day long self discovery side quests are TIGHT
A lot of Ryans is TIGHT!
😂🤣 the side quest about the cash register eyes… Ryan, you outdo yourself with each new video, you’re a genius! 🙌🏼
Did you ever do a pitch meeting for the movie "Eragon"?
This is totally next-level meta hilarious.
Love these! Hey shut up!!🤣🤣🤣
If I liked Star Wars I imagine I’d feel bad
A Pitch Meeting for the movie Apt Pupil please...it could be super easy,  barely an inconvenience  😀
Side quest🤣🥹
I literally fell of my couch laughing
L episode.
I love how we got to explore the Pitch Meeting universe, more of that please.
6:26 anyone else get slightly triggered when Ryan said Ahsoka was from Rebels?
#justicefortheactman #darkageofyoutube
2:56 skip the dollar sign thing.
PLEASE do the BOYS!!!
He's ahhh....Bostonian. LOL!
🤑
He’s aaaaa Bostonian.   Oh I love science fiction. Hahaha
i watched this video WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN! my CREED to Mr Producer Guy!
Pitch Meeting just went full Ryanverse!
Dem dollar signs, Jesus! Pure gold! :D
I thought this was "The Mandalorian Pitch Meeting", not "How Emojis Were Made"
Great point about them not producing merch until the show. The surprise of seeing him first on the show may have added to the instant appeal though. Either way Disney has made a ton of money off selling stuff with Baby Yodas image.
Please do meetings for a clock work orange, the house that jack built, cannibal Holocaust,a Serbian film
So much YES!!!--PS that's my Creed too! :D
He has become part looney tune, he's transcending
Duuuuuuuude......lol
I live my life waiting for these videos 😂😂
Hey you know which lovable side character you could feature if you did a pitch meeting for The Expanse? THE ADSTRONAUT!
I didn't watch all of the clone wars or any of Rebels. So anytime a new character shows up I don't recognize on these series, I just stay out loud, "He must be from the other thing! "
That series was a really good show about ... well, nothing in particular really but a lot of cool stuff happens and it's probably the best Star Wars worldbuilding since forever with just impressive production design. Too bad Boba Fett couldn't follow up and I'm hearing mixed stuff about Obi Wan. The blueprint is right there man!
8:04 unless you lived in the UK and couldn’t watch the show for months with the Americans were yelling about it left right and centre
This went in some very unexpected directions... and I love that.
Your comedy is strong
Yup. Valid points, and hilariously made, but I like the Mandalorian because although there's all those links to other stuff, you don't have to know about any of it to follow the story.  Although Grogu is cute, he does unpleasant things, like eating live frogs and almost genociding a frog woman's race.  Apart from amphibian hate crimes, he's also a thief. But more than anything Mando is fun, and there hasn't been much fun in Star Wars for a very long time for me.
Missed opportunity on producer guy's soul searching journey: camera shows he's actually talking to himself the WHOLE TIME  lol.. (psycho music starts playing)
I love the "hey shut up" catchphrase
Brilliant.
godzilla pitch meetiiinnggg
Even by watching this pitch meeting, I want to buy a tonne of Baby Yoda merch. 🤑
yeah yeah yeah!
Worth the wait
se second season is kinda weird, i remember questioning why the big guy mandalorian from bo katan team didn't reappear when they where raiding the imperial ship.
For a moment I was afraid that Producer Guy was giving up on his plan of buying Canada...
I hope you make more of these videos they are so good
When the producer guy gets more character development than mando. The only thing this is missing is a bunch of cameos to please fans and make them think that the show is good.
Omg a world with only ryans....
Wirh arms wide open welcome to this pitch I'll show you laugh I'll show you a catch phrase...super easy barely an incovinience
"He's from all of it!"
Where were you when the Disney+ algorithm seized power?
Please do one for the new top gun movie!
I laughed so hard at this one. His side journey
I've seen to many of these. I actually felt sad the "Star Wars Addicts" characters weren't included in Producer Guy's group session.
Thank you so much for this video. I'm so happy! Oh! I have to go listen to 'With arms wide open' by Creed. LOL!!!
I think studio guy has schizophrenia that’s dark and hilarious
DUDE!!!! that creed part!!! i laughed so hard
Cringe
Dude, you owe me for the keyboard I just spit my coffee on to when the Creed line hit 🤣
This is genuinely my favorite Pitch Meeting of recent times
Holy crap the random "WITH AHMS WAHD OUPAANNH" killed me
Why was I unsubscribed from Pitch Meeting??!! Why does Youtube keep doing stuff like that??
Can't wait for the -Mandalorian Season 3- Book of Boba Fett Pitch Meeting!
BILL BURR
when the profit margin is so big it's traumatizing
OMG Skynet Disney
The pitch guy called it a garbage can and the producer called it a garbage bin, proving that the two are different people.
That's my creed! LoL
I’m sorry but that dollar signs joke went on for way too long man
Wake up   Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family   God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved   it’s like the days of noah. God sending his servants in love because God loves you to warn you before judgment comes and yes of course human nature   Human beings ignoring God just like the days Noah mockers and scoffers laughing at the preaching of the word  scoffing at the preachers and persecuting those that come in love and share in love   scoffing at the word of God and all this scoffing and mocking even after all that you’ve seen since 2020 and have experienced  Yet everyday life continuing people oblivious to the coming judgement upon this world like the days of noah and ignoring everything that they’ve seen and are seeing   ignoring the fact that there’s a war happening in Ukraine which could potentially lead to nuclear war also ignoring the fact that Israel is about to go to war with Iran and China is about to go to war with Twain   Ignoring the fact that food prices are rising aswell as fuel prices there’s talks of worldwide famines by 2023 new diseases monkeypox after we just had a virus cause havoc on this world for two years and now we have a new one   yet people are choosing to ignore all this signs when the bible told you that this would happen in the last days  A time prophesied by Jesus - a time worser then anything that’s happened  in this world yet you can still be saved out of that time and out of the tribulation and it’s only through Jesus that you can be saved from the wrath to come and from hell and from eternal Separation from God because of you’re sins for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   you’re in the middle of a spiritual warfare light - against -darkness and you have no idea how great or wicked that darkness is nor what that darkness is doing or planning for you   the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to judge this world and to put everything right  God’s will is for all to be saved and for none to perish but time is running out this is not the time to be running away from God but rather to God and for my brothers and sisters in Christ   my fellow Christians don’t play church you’re either with Christ or you’re not beloved. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.  you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  Beloved You have to pick up you’re cross and follow Jesus and deny yourself daily and crucify your flesh daily and be holy because God is holy offer you’re body as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto God beloved strive i repeat strive ! to enter through the narrow gate for many will try but will not be able too   This message is shared out of love to everyone so you can be saved   So Repent and give you’re life to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and saviour and receive forgiveness and salvation through Christ Jesus    Acts 4.12  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved   John 14:6 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me  God bless
I hope you make a pitch meeting for the obi-wan series when its over
Watching this in my baby Yoda t-shirt
"nothing to worry about there". Lol great writing and delivery.
I love how this and the latest 'first guy' completely lose the plot 😄 Is everything OK Ryan?!
Do Predator!!!!
This personality spinoff line was simply amazing! Great episode, thanks Ryan!
Ryan is making it so big time that he even got the budget for additional characters.
Petition to get more pitch meeting lore
Ahsoka being a main character in Clone Wars, gets called a Rebels character hmmmmmmmm
That's some Yogurt level of merchandising (moichandising) the producer guy is experiencing.
I'm so pleased producer guy takes mental health seriously, even if he doesn't consider the value of other people's time!
i havent watched the show can someone tell me how is ahsoka and luke in timeline llike ahsoka should be dead
...but...but...my money .....  😅🤣😅🤣
The reason why The Mandalorian is not a 10/10 show for me and why I rated several episodes so lowly is because those episodes were literally just backdoor pilots or basically adverts for spinoffs. I didn't like that.
Side quest in a pitch meeting about a show with side quests. love it.
I love how "shut up {quickly moves on}" is a now frequently used thing.
This is best one you've done yet ma'dude!!
Literally THREE MINUTES before the real pitch meeting started, and I'm totally okay with that.
"With arms wide open" and... I'm dead! haha
How can it be “costing them money” to NOT have merch? Wouldnt it be more like “not making as much as they could” ?
Bostonians are my favorite scifi species!
The leader of the support group is the guy who was uncomfortably optimistic about the public bathrooms.
Lol, fun!
Oh my gosh yes, please do top gun maverick please
the effort put into this dollar sign gag is much appreciated
Obi Wan, tron 2, Boba fett,  next Harry Potter , u know, surprise me lol, loved this one by the way.
Hi, I'm one of the screenwriters for this movie. I enjoy your Pitch Meetings very much. Keep up the good work, Ryan!
The producer dealing with his reaction to the dollar signs was gold, gold Ryan
Honestly might be thr best one yet. Wow.
The journey of self discovery was funny... but I literally snorted as soon as you started singing "With arms wide oppennnn!" when he said Creed. lol
Character development for Mr Producer Guy...during The Mandalorian Pitch Meeting. This is the Way!
With eyes wide open - that's my creed Oh Ryan 😂😂😂😂😂
Does all that therapy scenes a hint for the delay of the show
The Awoogah guy moment is what made this the best pitch meeting ever.
Ryan has his own clones. Maybe some sort of an „Army of the Republic“. Obi Wan needs to investigate this.
This show sounds so stupid. Everything is so worthless and stupid anymore. I can't wait until this whole wretched society collapses.
Hilarious
I spit some coffee out with that Creed joke lmao
He went to a new level with this one
I laughed 🤣 so hard when he keeps saying but my money
When great satire becomes high art! 🎭
The different faces of Ryan at its best. LOL! Super funny.
I don’t think I could live without Pitch Meetings.
I think this one is the best pitch meeting so far! "With arms wide open" 😂 Ryan, you are a money-loving legend!!!! 😍😂
Oh, Ryan I love you so much. 😭 This is one of the best pitch so far!! Loved it.
That Disney AI Algorithm was chilling and hilarious!  Not to be overshadowed by that art-film personal journey!!!
The production value went up tremendously in this episode. Ryan's going up in the world, good for him.
pitch EDGE OF TOMORROW and NEXT and SOURCE CODE and PUSH and EDMOND and GATTACA and LEGEND OF 1900!  I can help you write them, if you want!  My friends say I'm hilarious, or that's what I think they'd say if I had any!
Liked the Journey, but at Creed u really got me
With arms wide open....that's my Creed 😂 Oh and thanks for putting your thumb down. 👍
I have been waiting a long time for this...
When producer guy files his taxes he claims every one in the world as dependents. IRS guy wants to do an audit but realizes when they have the same face, it's going to be super easy barely am inconvenience to push the filing through the system.
No one's gonna appreciate the fact that Writer Guy standing there for THREE DAYS waiting?
Congrats to Ryan for getting out of the Screen Rent umbrella. I thought they'd never let him.
Welcome to this place, I'll show you everythin'
It's Baby Yoda and Friends
There were no characters from Star Wars Rebels that wasn’t also in Clone Wars…except the Dark Troopers they looked like they were Grand Admiral Thrawn’s training dummies and caused the heroes trouble once.
Lol, didnt see that self discovery journey coming, I understand you, I like money too, and Im fine with it
The tangent of self discovery was a nice break in the formula.  MRS. DOUBTFIRE PITCH MEETING!  wowowowowow
When he talked about Baby Yoda being a great merchandising opportunity I looked down at the Grogu shirt I was wearing and lowkey judged myself
Omg please do a pitch meeting for Drop Dead Fred
07:08- is this a Nirvana reference?
Usually you change how the characters look in the thumbnail, why didn’t you do that this time?
😂😂😂😂 please do a peaky blinders pitch meeting
Kathleen Kennedy likes this.
Please do Fire Starter … it was so trash it’s hilarious
More. Producer. Guy. Even better: Producer Guy Pitch Meeting. Best: Pitch Meeting Pitch Meeting.
Do the Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers film. There's so many frickin characters from things in there.
I did a spit take at the creed bit
LMMFAO!!!!!!!
The money signs after the mention of Baby Yoda was just pure genius. Perfectly describes Disney executives.
Wow producer guys character development is insane!! 😳
If anyone watching Obi Wan they added another Functional Robotic Toy to sell
Amazing how we went from a fine but plain and linear satire of ilogical behaviour of movie producers to a mind blowing Ryanverse full of metareferences and lateral thinking. Definetely this episode is the Shrek of Pitch Meetings, sooooo many layers.
🤑
With a hat on, you look way too much like Shia Labeof
3 years later and its finally here
The Creed thing hit me completely unguarded, brought almost tears to my eyes. I am going to listen to them right now.
#thatsmycreed
The fact Ryan did not have so kuch nitpicking tell you that the Mando was a good show  It was extra ordinary, with twist and turns, but it was grounded, know what it was and served that purpose.
"But...but my money..." Great character growth! So proud of you 😃
Nice to see mustaches are still in style in a far far distant universe in the future.
This might be the best one yet!! “Am I dying?  I don’t know!”  😂🤣😂🤣❤️
Is it me or is the audio out of sync by like a microsecond?
brilliant lol 😂
Do THE BOYS please and thank you
Hey, shut up I know I have said this in the past, but this is the freaking best pitch meeting I have seen!! So many great jokes, the most recent catch phrase, and It even had a minimovie about Producer Guy, with hero journey and all!
7 seconds in… that’s officially the earliest I’ve outright cackled at one of your jokes in a Pitch Meeting 🤣🤣🤣
1:40 “That’s a little outdated but it’ll get the job done.” Like if you get the reference!
"With arms wide open" Immediately catching that reference, Ive never felt older. 😵
This was the best pitch meeting episode I've ever seen!
"With arms wide O-Pahn!" Oh man, I laughed.
I would love to see the Pitch Meeting for Obi van Kenobi. That thing simply outdumbs anything Star Wars related so far.
WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN 😂🤣😂🤣
Pitch meetings for The godfather
I really want a Pitch Meeting for "Diablo Immortal". Pitch Meeting but for games...
I literally lol’d at the Creed reference and now I’m ashamed.
Wow character development, wow
"He's from all of it!" 🤣🤣🤣
Yep... Loved it! Just... This... I love these...! PLEASE do Masters of the Universe!
"He's from all of it" XD lord! I loved it
Eyes making dollar signs is perfectly normal
Glad to see Ryan help Ryan understand that greed is good 😁
I love how Producer Guys journey of self-discovery closes the DoA plot hole from the first episode.
That creed joke made me spit out my tea!
Ive watched this for 5 hours, it's beautiful
Kicking the new channel off with a bang 👏👏👏
You’ve outdone yourself with this one, Ryan. Awesome work!
The crazy thing is Disney took over a year to really capitalize on Baby Yoda merchandise.  They had some really cheap thrown-together t-shirts with 6 inch square silk screens and a lot of cheap knockoffs, but none of the big players like Funko had anything even remotely in the pipeline, so they didn't seem to be expecting it to blow up like it did.
That was completely bonkers! Just when I thought these pitch meetings could not get any better. 🤣🤣
GREAT episode
That whole sketch got me cracking up😂😂😂😂😂😂💉😂
Oh noo… the multi-billion dollar company didn’t siphon a few extra million out of the populace.
That hospital sketch got me cracking up😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love the mandalorian and this pitch meeting means a lot to me
Perhaps Ryan now has entered the Tex Avery universe?
That Creed joke cracked me the fuck up 😂 Well done, Ryan. Well done
I have the same thing as the awooga guy
This video is like a pitch meeting and Ryan George colab. Also co greats on 700k subs my dude
"hey shut up "
"So that's gonna be a big learning point for him, you know: it's okay to fully put your faith in artificial intelligence" "Our Disney+ algorithm has been suggesting we start pushing that kind of message" So good on so many levels 😂
Now I want a Producer Guy origin story.
Pitch Meeting crossing over with The First Guy is tight!
Please do The Book of Boba Fett next. There's a lot to be said
Video starts at 3:17
That Creed reference was 🔥
The Die Hard sagas
This pitch meeting was Tight !! and there's that horror film "The Cabin in the Woods" Would be Super Easy....
I’m a devout follower of the Ryanverse and this is by far one of the best ever! Luke skywalker being in “all of it” & the hilariously overlong voyage of discovery for ProducerGuy were truly fantabulous 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻   Now that he has begun his redemption arc, I look forward to PitchGuy’s descent into moneygrubbing madness as he turns to the dark side 🤑
There is literally no point to discussing the plot of this series because that stupid child is the only thing that matters to anyone.
The tangent about the dollar sign eyes was unnecessary and annoying, it was fun for a second but it played itself out long before we even got to the support group
Can we just stop for a minute and appreciate The Producer Guy for randomly singing With Arms Wide Open amid the pitch meeting and his journey for self-discovery?
Do The Northman !
Sometimes I forget this guy is just talking to himself   Or maybe he’s not 🤔
You ready for this... Star Kid and Flight of The Navigator!
This was definitely my favourite one yet!   That support group absolutely killed me!
I literally cannot wait for the Obi Wan Kenobi Pitch Meeting....
“He’s a Bostonian” “And how did they hire him” “Probably on ZipRecruiter”
I was waiting for the Producer to say "I'm gonna need you to get all the way off my back about that" when talking about holding off on merchandising of Baby Yoda.
Book of boba Fett 🔥🔥🔥
Just wait for Obi-Wan Kenobi. Finding flaws in that show is going to be super easy... You know what.
I would love to see an episode of multiple Ryans discussing what to do next in the Ryanverse
"He's from ALL OF IT!" OK, lost it there!
The Creed joke killed me 😂
I feel like you could have a lot of fun with an Akira Pitch meeting
Next time we need some character growth for the writer guy. I'd love to see him in his writing process, struggeling to come up with new ideas.
Not a word about why they didn't cast Sebastian Stan instead of a deep fake of Mark Hamill?
I wasn't prepared for how deep this episode was going to be.
Lol @ bill burr the Bostonian
"That's MY Creed" *fists bumps own chest* Bahahah
Everytime I watch a show or a film I can't wait for the pitch meeting.. Tops it off for me 😂
Please do the Scorpion King, Ryan
The commitment to the producer guy character arc is highly commendable
Mmmm, this has to be my least favourite of all. I didn't like the self discovery bit and the rest of it was meh. It definitely lacks the rigor and analysis that made the Pitch Meetings great. Seems like Ryan is trying to get a laugh at all cost. The quality suffers greatly.
Thank you.
you can do a pith meeting on umbrella academy since the 3 seson is comming in 12 days
1:29 - hey it's the bathroom stall guy!!! I frickin' I love that guy...
Haha i was happy this pitch meeting wasnt just 5 min again but 3 minutes if it was the stupid joke so its technically still 5
"He's from all of it" Genius!!
Pitch meeting lore!
'With arms wide open' chest thump, 'that's my creed'.😆😆😆
I randomly started rewatching this show yesterday and was wondering if this had a pitch meeting yet.
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.                       !!!
Wow. Not even Pitch Meeting can make a Star Wars property interesting.
this took a turn
Рroducer guy at a psychoanalyst's appointment. It should have been expected a looong time ago, after all the scripts he listened to. :D
“Thats my creed” 😂
Holy crap, you actually mentioned a very real, dark agenda! Don't look now, but your woke might be slipping.
Lol!! I wasn’t into the break skit at first, but I love it now baby!
this is still a very enjoyable commercial.
Im surprised it took you until now to make a Pitch meeting of this show
These pitch meetings fell in quality last december out of no where. Either ryan isnt doing too well in his personal life or his ideas just suck now but at least theyre somewhat entertaining. Edit: Never mind he spent 3 minutes extending an unfunny joke jesus christ
We waited over 2 weeks since the last pitch meeting of a new project. Thank god this isnt just 4-5 minutes long.
The "dollar signs" bit 😂
Dollar sign gag is dragged a bit too long.
Dude...never change. This was brilliant.
This channel literally can't stop laughing
With ams wide Opaaah! 🤣🤣 amazing
Damn I did not expect to get a character arc for the Producer Guy like that Getting a character arc is TIGHT
Should have said "and Gideon managed to kidnap baby Yoda..." *Long pause*  "We are going to fucking kill moff Gideon"
Just when I think “Pitch Meetings” can’t get any funnier…  This man is a genius. Seriously, it’s Michelangelo, Leonardo, Einstein and Ryan.
Too funny. The cult of personality. Best yet.
The perfect Pitch Meeting doesn’t exis…..
Producer Guy's character growth was pretty amazing to see tbh! The Pitch Meeting Universe is starting to grow!
The “Creed” moment had me in stitches. Comedy gold
The script for this one was tight!!
Everything, Everywhere, All at Once.  I dare you.
Bostonian is canon in Star Wars
@1:10 holy crap you got Wil Wheaton to guest star as the psychiatrist!
I don't know why, but the fact that I expected "he's from the other thing" bu instead he said "he's from ALL of it" really got me
The eyeball thing was funny at first but it just went on & on. Aside from baby yoda, they don't really even start talking about Mandalorian until more than 3 minutes in.
What a intense anime ark
i got that creed reference....feeling old now...thx
This. Was. PERFECT.
Joking aside I hate that cute stuff like baby Yoda can only be used for marketing for some reason, that's not why cute things exist
Reaching 700k is super easy, barely an inconvenience !
More character growth in this episode than Finn in the entire sequel trilogy
“He’s in ALL of it!”
Producer Guy : Merchandise opportunity !!!$$$!!! Disney : meh ... lets focus on merchandise for our movies the fans hate Fans : Im gonna build my own baby yoda merch and sell it on etsy! Disney : ... hey ....wait a minutes! ......im too dumb to react properly to this
5:11 LOOOOL
Can you do an episode about "lost" please 🙏
Hey, no intro chords...
Cyprien ? c'est toi ?  Ca copie bien !
I like the slick critique of Disney character studies and development in regards to characters like Loki .
Any chance you could do one for Godzilla 1998 whenever you have time
How about a Pitch Meeting for an annoying franchise with mainly women to have a play on "Pitch Meeting" but with a B.
So is baby Yoda the same Yoda in the original movies? And if so how is Luke Skywalker in this show and Yoda is a baby but in the original movies Luke is trained by yoda and Yoda dies of old age??
So skynet is awakening in Ryan universe
Can't wait for a series about the Disney AI's quest for world domination.
WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN
The Northman!!!
Fantano-stash.
i came here for a mandalorian pitch meeting but got a moonknight pilot instead
A 3 minute set-up for a Tight joke.  Art.
Please do a Pitch Meeting for Waterworld or Cool World. I didn't plan for them both to have "world" in the title, so I don't have a joke prepared. I just think they'd both be entertaining. Okay, bye now.
Best pitch meeting, ever.
Creed is definitely one of my guilty pleasures
That thumbnail is pure quality
The creed bit KILLED me.  I’m a fan of Creed but I appreciate the mocking 🤣🤣😁 WIDE OHPAHN
WITH AAAAARMS WIDE OHPAAAAAN
Looooove the producer guy tangent!
This goes on my top 10 list
Amazing start! Give the producer guy a character development is just making the lore of the show
I love sciece fiction
This is straight up just a Ryan George video masquerading as a pitch meeting
Star Wars is dead.
Werner Herzog? wut
Ryan George and the multiverse of madness.
Any chance for Halo TV series Pitch Meeting?
I’m glad to see Ryan is changing things up every now and then by breaking out of his traditional patterned format and thus keeping the creative juices flowing ❤️
I love this Ryan George cinematic universe
"hes from all of it"
I didn't expect a Producer guy miniseries in this episode
I only realised now that the Auuuga sound is supposed to imply that the speaker is "horn"y. Thanks Ryan.
I would really be happier if you did pitch meetings for each individual season of the show you're pitching.
I love the lil' side task 😂
Way too much of the stupid eye $
I wanna see the original 1979 superman and the low budget superman 4,,,the contrast in quality amazed me lol
That droid which suggested killing baby Yoda just applied "logical short circuit": when checking "Dead OR alive", it decided "i can bring him dead, Dead=true ", no need to evaluate that expression any further. All modern compilers do it.
I feel slightly dirty now.
Turns out that character growth is super eas...
The Ryanverse is expanding!
The thumbnail made baby yoda look like a 1970's Sleestak.   I heartily approve.
These videos are awesome.  Why, you ask? Look, I'm going to need you to get all the way off my back about it. They just are.
I try each Star Wars spin-off get bored, and give up. Watching Pitch Meetings is far quicker, and more entertaining!
Damn that side quest was everything
'Very Endor-able" 😂
Super stuff. The expanding pitch universe is tight !!
Wow... this is a whole new level in the pitchmeetingverse! Ryan, you are the king of kings🙌🙌🙌
The "hey shut up" is thankfully back
I thought I couldn't love Ryan more but Arms wife open reference. I haven't heard another living being naked that in so long... Might Bea decade at this point 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
This was AmazeBalls!!!❤
Amazing! Producer Guy had more character development in 8 minutes than Rey in 3 movies.
Putting a side quest in a pitch meeting is TIGHT!!!
YAY! Pitch meeting stepping out of the office and into Ryan George's cinematic universe, how awesome :D
This Pitch Meeting covers 2 seasons in 9 minutes and manages to shuffle in a huge side quest for Producer Guy.  Wow wow wow wow. Wow
Fucking lost it at that "WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN" bit hahahaha
Council of Ryans.
love it as always pleease do oryginal Mortal Kombat from 1996 someday
That went of the rails quickly
Who cares about the Mandalorian, give me more Producer Guy storyline.
Love the way he basically inserted his RyanGeorge-verse characters into a Pitch Meeting the same way Dave Filoni inserts characters from all his other shows into The Mandalorian.
There was no pitch meeting for this show?!
"With arms wide open! That's my Creed"  I'm deceased. 💀
My 5 year old nephew is obsessively watching the Mandalorian for Baby Yoda alone. His classmates like Baby Yoda- so he had to watch the show…  He hasn’t seen anything else Star Wars, ever- so it bugs the hell out of me lol
Yes, Bill Burr is a creature of it's own volition.
As a therapist, I co-sign on the support group lol
Love that Producer guy had a side quest…. Coz it’s like Mandalorian…. With all his side quests…. Like it’s funny coz it’s the same….
Se7en, "whats in the box"
It bugs me incredibly slightly that he referred to Ahsoka as the character from Rebels.
I can not for the life of me believe that recycling the same jokes almost verbatum is working out for Ryan. xD I really don't understand how he can possibly just write the same thing over and over and it works.
I feel like Ryan just wanted to force “awww using my garbage bin as a bathroom is tight” into upcoming fan compilation videos and so he added the whole self reflection storyline just to make that possible.
"With arms wide open!" Literally had to pause to video until I could stop laughing and listen to the rest
You're the only person that I don't personally know who's allowed to sing that song and make me genuinely laugh.
"that's part of his creed"  "With arms wide O-Open, that's my creed"
You sir, are a treasure! Great vid!
I've never seen _The Mandolorian_ but I guarantee that -- at least to me -- this was far more entertaining. And it only took me 9 minutes (15 with rewinds).
Ok, best one in ages. Absolutely flawless, including an amazing punch :-)
"Because money"   The series 🤣🤣🤣
I really love Producer Guy's character development side quest in this one.
😂🤣
Absolutely love the Producer Guy storyline 😂
Please expand the universe
I just fucking love this... Best content on the web
I love the fact that the producer guy and screenwriter guy are in their little world and everyone else around them is grounded 😂
Can you put the shorts on their own channel so that I can subscribe without it filling my feed with things ive already seen?
That’s my Creed
PLEASE do Galavant!!!  It's relatively little known, but such a gem through and through!  I know you'd have a blast with it! 😂
This might just be your best one yet! And that's saying something XD
HEYY MAN Start making Game Pitches :D  Those would be fun to watch and mix up things ;)
It's the faceless people you gotta be concerned about
Creating unexpected tangents where the protagonist goes on a journey of self-discovery-but-not-really is tight.
00:51 's *"I DON'T KNOOOW!"* might be the funniest one yet  Edit: This whole goddamn Pitch Meeting is the best one yet.
Wait... is Pitch Meeting criticising that Disney... didn't... make more money off of their merch? 🤯
these are just so good.
Bojack Horseman Pitch Meeting. I want to see pitching series about alcoholic, depressed horse-man
Going to the different planets and completing a mission reflects what mando has known his whole life as a bounty hunter it just makes sense to him
😂😂😂😂😂 this is comedy gold damn this guy is really good at this, he makes it so easy barely an inconvenience
"He's from ALL of it!"  😆
No mention of Gina Carano? 🤨
i only care about the original trilogy and don't care about prequels/sequels but since this is baby yoda doesn't this make this a prequel? why is luke skywalker here? or did get yoda get reborn or some nonsense?
OMG I thought the side quest was the best part but then Producer Guys belts out, "with arms wide open" in Scott Stapp's voice and I dropped my phone laughing
Took me a minute to realise he put a side quest into the Mandalorian Pitch Meeting. Mind blown.
I bought the Cereal and its just captain crunch repurposed.
Kudos for fitting in an entire other skit into this one.
Love the tangent
LACK of Baby Yoda merch?? Beg pardon?? I've seen shelves and shelves of unwanted Grogu toys. There's no shortage of product, just too much of the same things.
"I don't know" one of my favorite sentences
Producer Guy likes money? 😱 Shocking! Didn't know that
You could hear Producer Guy's depression at the end at the sheer lack of millions from Baby Yoda merch.
Pure genius
You should do pitch meeting for some 80's/90's B-grade movies, what a classic era of rubbish...
Request for  Ocean’s Eleven Pitch Meeting please and thank you.
This is the way?
3:15 to skip the character development (that is not really funny) and to get back on track about the show
hilarious !!!
“With arms wide open” I died. These just get better and better. Great work Ryan!
One of the best episodes so far! Ryan is on 🔥
Having your own channel for these pitch meetings is a surprise for sure, but a welcome one.
Just when I thought I figured out which one was Ryan and which one was George.
Why spend 3 minutes explaining "Producer Guy" likes money?!? We already know!!
How many glasses does Ryan own?
Best vid of all time
wait wait wait, maybe because I'm not so deep in this story... Luke training Yoda? What's with the timeline?
Producer guy, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, pretty much all Wall Street. I’ve spent so much of my life ignorantly loathing the wealthy. I never knew the true nature of money addiction. It’s a disease like alcoholism and needs to be treated with compassion and understanding. Thank you all for your bravery, especially you producer guy.
I dare you to do a pitch on Jupiter Ascending. I don´t think even the Wachowskis can tell you what it is truly about ("exept that bees are genetically designed to recognize royalty" - not sure how Sean Bean ever said his lines without cracking up)
Dollar sign eyes bit feels more like Ryan George's skit in his channel. I was waiting for the Adstronaut to show up
“Freaking Luke Skywalker shows up” “He’s from ALL OF IT”  That sent me 🤣🤣
There should be a Star Wars show where all the characters are Ryan and there is a Mandolorian Ryan and everyone’s like “OMG who is underneath the helmet?…(takes it off to get bad guy stuff from a computer)…oh right it’s Ryan”
VERY amazing sir
I laughed so hard I choked badly. It was awesome.
phenomenal
Well... this one took an odd turn at the start.
Plot twist: the only reason producer guy went through all that therapy was because Ryan couldn’t find another way to fit in the “tight” catchphrase
I want a Ryanverse...3 hours
Ryan's personal channel sketch meets pitch meeting 😂
Baby Yoda merchandising physiological effect, the next registered syndrome for producers wanting $....
the Creed reference was top tier
Key lesson from this episode: Don't play with Ryan's money 😂
Love this pitch meeting lore we’ve been getting recently
The lack of baby yoda merchandise had nothing to do with preventing spoilers, Disney just had no faith that the Mandalorian was going to be a success... just another bad Star Wars business decision lol...
What a surprising mix of Pitch Meeting and Ryan George's own  channel! He's the only person I know who can do a crossover with himself.
The love for money was inside him this whole time
I love the idea of these characters having their own side stories and development on this new channel. I feel like this is stuff that wasn’t possible before but now you’re free to explore all kinds of new territory!!
"That's MY Creed" and "He's from all of it!" are my favourite lines in this
Very brave of you not to mention Gina Carano’s character even though she pretty much was season 1.  Disappointed in you sell outs
This took an unexpected turn
Old Billy supah (take it) ezee. Barely and incon......... ............................... venience
I love that even though he has a mustache, he still put a fake one on for the other characters  lol . Dedication
Okay so who listened to producer guy creed backward ?
We need one for The Boys
Mandolorian would have been an infinitely better show if it had nothing to do with Star Wars.
Yeah, this is Ryan George’s channel now.
Damn, his was a tour de force! (See what I did there!) Lots of characters with speaking parts! This must have cost a fortune!
I don't care about all these Marvel and Harry Potter pitch meetings, they just don't interest me
That Creed bit was just, chef’s kiss.
The Mandalorian was such an awful show with just horrendous plot holes and storyline. I kept watching hoping it would get better. It just got worse and worse then there was one episode in S2 that was cool then the show died with a whimper.
this is such a special episode for a special show
“Mando”- Ryan’s love handles.
The start of this video became very concerning very fast.
Am I dying I donnn't know
Dang that B plot is better than most of what hollywood puts out lately
"He's from all of it"
Love the meta here!
Need a Pitch Meeting for Crank!!
Man dough could also be a specific kind of baby batter.
Plague Dogs pitch meeting please
The quick "hey shut up" is becoming part of the quotables. Adding new quotables occasionally to spice up the formula is tight!
I am surprised that, instead of the characters swollen eyes on the thumbnail, it is not Producer Guy with Dollar signs
So basically Luke shows up, do a backflip, snap the bad guys necks and save the day?
You should do a pitch for everything everywhere all at once
Weirdly, I'd love to see you do an older show- Six Feet Under. Story goes that when Alan Ball submitted his pilot script to HBO, they asked him if he could, "make it more f**cked up?"
Last name: Guy First name: Producer Pitch guy: yeah yeah yeah Me: wait a minute
.
We are witnessing a Pitch Meeting metamorphoses. Great editing on this one. The B Plot was tight. Literally. I only wish Producer Guy would have taken a beat to shed a single tear for nostalgia before he followed the Dark Side and DOUBLE DOLLAR SIGNED his eyes...
Question: How was this "costing" millions when they turned a profit? Or is this the extreme capitalist version of "cost" which means "I feel entitled to even more obscene amounts of money"? Just so I can determine to what extent I don't care.
I named my SWOR Charakter Mando before watching the Show and now it feels so cringe to play him  :(  Anyone up for a sith guild?
Holy crap, Ryan went off the rails in this one. I loved it, haha
FINNNAALLLYYYY..... 🥳
producer guy had better development in like 3 mins than rey had in 3 movies
The $ sign skit was superb, Monty Python crew would've been proud of Ryan.
I had to watch the Creed part like four times. 🤣
I thought the tanget was the best thing about this episode - but hearing him sing "With Arms Wide Open' and proclaiming it as "his Creed" had me choking on spit-laughing. Jesus H...
do RRR pitch meeting plssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
The complexity of Producer Guy and Screenwriting Guy has become the soap opera that I never knew I wanted. I can't wait for Producer Guys' wife assuming that Screenwriting Guy is a threat...
He's working in his other characters into the skit! HE'S WORKING IN HIS OTHER CHARACTERS INTO THE SKIT! *HE'S WORKING IN HIS OTHER CHARACTERS INTO THE SKIT!*
"He's from all of it!" 💀💀💀
"He's from all of it!"  I died at that one lmao
The creed bit was so good XD with arms wide opaan
The mandalorian is probably one of the worst shows I have ever watched in my entire life
Hey... You keep using the same guy for all the different characters.
Oh! It was a side quest to extend the pitch meeting run time. Now I get it.
That was an excellent way of saying that The Mandalorian gets lost in random side quests that has nothing to do with the journey but only the character, before coming back to the main arc by the second half. I applaud you sir!
I'm happy Producer Guy is finally getting some backstory.
Thank flipping gorb, you pointed out the any face scanner.
Pitch meeting about to have its own lore! Oh my I am so ready!
Ryan...you never cease to amaze me, good sir! 😂 So good!
All this time, I thought they were both sitting down...!
“WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN”
Mando does more side quests than Geralt! Love these pitch meetings! Thanks for all the fun Ryan! :D
No spoiler alert? Looks like I'm too late lol.
Did you catch the hey shut up! Lovin it!
I loved how surreal that went with the dollar signs in the eyes 🤣
That fake tache' is absolutely exquisite
"times 8". I feel that so badly. Was super excited to finally watch the show because everyone was loving it so much. I had too high expectations. Now we are stuck on Episode 5 or 6 because it is so damn repetetive it almost feels like watching the same episode again and again. I really wanted to love this show. ☹️
An amazing lack of Cara Dune mentioned here. Well that's because she's been cancelled, and we like to go along with whatever narrative we've been handed by our Disney bosses! Oh wow wow wow. Bowing down to dictators is tight!
Still sad this show wasn't a Boba Fett show in the first place. Ya know, instead of silver boba fett with a daddy complex...
“My name is Producer Guy.” 😁😁😁
Lmao the singing sent me into a giggling fit
A very dumb security
The fact that they finally let the other channel whose name I can’t remember get Alllllllll the way off of his back is just amazing.
I wish that Disney got fined an obscene amount of money for selling merchandise that was supposed to be Baby Yoda that wasn't actually him.
The Creed joke made me laugh way too hard
🤑
hope your socks are permanently wet how dare you to call it "baby yoda"
"He's from all of it!!" Had me 😂🤣
"With arms wide open" 💀💀💀
The self-discovery bit went on for farrrrrr too long and lost it's haha in the process. Just a dead filler bit that falls flat.
I had no idea Baby Yoda was coming, and he was amazing. Thank you Mr. Screenwriter Guy for helping keep it relatively secret!
“With arms wide open” might have been the hardest I have ever laughed at Pitch Meeting! That was brilliant! 😂
Great Personal Growth!  Impressive! Also a Peter Sellers level of characters played by one man!
Dig the fresh cut.
I believe you've reached your (Darth-) nadir! This is in my top 3 Pitch Meetings. May the Farce be with you! That was funny AAAAAFuuh, thank you.
You turned a pitch meeting into a study on narcissism and character development
This is just Ryan's generic audition tape, showing his acting range
thank you Ryan. Every time I feel hungry, people around me turn into delicious-looking steaks -- and now I realize that's ok.
with arms wide opahhn
I'm waiting for the day producer guy says "Gonna be hard to get outta THAT situation." And pitch guy says, "Actually... yeah, it - it will be pretty hard. Will darn near kill them."  *awkward silence*
Holding off on the Baby Yoda merch might be the hardest and most selfless thing that Disney ever did! :D :D
If it's Mandalorian, also do HALO lmao
Did he just pulled that charecter development part just to make that trash can joke 😂 Man I love it
Finally! Not enough people talking about how crap these shows are.
I knew Ryan’s mom had twins, but geez she had what, septuplets??
Need one for top gun maverick!
💰 👀 😂
Please do Battle Los Angeles !
Fun, fun, fun. With the tangent being an extra dose of fun.
Okay am I the only one who thinks "Pitch Meeting" could be a feature length movie or a Netflix show? 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
This is still going...on... Lol  "Alright I'm back"  I'm dead.
This is a nice crossover between the RyanVerse and the Pitch Meeting Universe
Ah, Mando. The show that teased Star Wars could be good on the small screen. Then we got Boba Fett and Obi-Wan.
Omg greatest skit ever
I absolutely adore when jokes get stretched out and beaten to death in such a masterful way. Good shit my dude.
I think this might be the best episode yet, my goodness
"WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN...." is my Creed too 😂😂😂😂
"He's from all of it!"
HeyShutUp court is in seshunnnnn is my creed!
"With arms wide open.. that's my Creed" - Producer Guy
1:32 Ryan's sssssssmokin!
Producer guy had better character development in 1 minute, than Rey in 3 movies. 💁🏼‍♂️
Gremlins 2 pitch meeting would be TIGHT!!!
Scott Pilgrim vs The World please
I love the way this went off on a tangent! Totally unexpected!
"Avoiding mentioning a major actress from the entire season is tight"
Thank you. I suffer from that eye $$-sign affliction too.  Now it has spread through the whole hospital. Don't go there, healthcare cost being what they are already.
The depth he goes for the Dollar Sign bit….  magnificent!  Wow wow wow  WOW  Edit: AND THEN HE DID A CREED JOKE! Hahahahahaha
Do a pitch meeting for the fifth element
The side quest was amazing
"So if you have a face you can access the bad guys information?" If you have a code cylinder with proper clearances, yeah.
First three minutes were wild. Lmao
Came for the funny quips, stayed for the therapy.
PULP FICTION
Producer guy has more character development than Reva
Pretty sure the first 3 minutes was an acid trip and I'm ok with that.
Wait WHAT??  How can Luke Skywalker be in this AT ALL?  In the original trilogy, Yoda is already a very old puppet/muppet - like 100s of years old, and Luke is first introduced to Yoda via Kenobi in "Empire Strikes Back". Are we talking alternate timelines and universes for SW now?
Producer Guy's story must have been the inspiration for The Book Of Boba Fett.
Thats my Creed!😂😂😂
Baby Yoda - the only character for whom the exaggeratedly-large eyes in the Pitch Meeting video thumbnail picture are actually smaller than they are in real life.  ;-)
ayyy! hope we can get the other shows too
Nothing to worry about there sir...
I love the Creed reference! With arms wide open!!
You dedicated to the Joke and it was worth it XD
Did you really just say ahsoka tano was from Star Wars Rebels
Please do one on the Boyz Amazon prime series.
With arms wide open… I laughed out loud. Great writing!
I like the extended bits
Not having baby Yoda merchandise ready was the first time Disney ever had restraint in its life. I dont know how filoni and Favreau convinced disney, but the moment deserves to be in the showrunner hall of fame
Ahahahaha! This is one of the best ones yet!
SHRREEEEEK pitch meeting!
How has he not done this show yet lol
Is this whole skid based on a movie The mask?
Unexpected but not unwelcome. Very clever and funny in a way only Ryan George  can think up.
So the Pitch Meeting universe consists of people who look like different variations of Ryan
The character development is insane
The RGCU is getting more lore with producer guy going through some difficult stuff
You're not being costed millions if you didn't own those millions to begin with.
Producer guy doesn’t have a true name yet so canonically this is before The first Guy to have a name skit
I completely missed "Hey' shut up" (6:25). Writer Guy, I'm gonna need you to get all the way off Producer Guy's back!
Did anyone else notice that he didn't mention Gina Carano or her character at all? That's no doubt deliberate due to controversy and hate he'd get no matter what he said, which I understand but it's a damn shame that that's how it is.
Luke freaking Skywalker!!! He's from everything !!!!!!
Bill Burr the bostonian. Ha!
Fun fact: it’s estimated Disney lost out on about 1 billion dollars by not having any baby yoda merch ready for sale at Christmas when season 1 game out. They estimate companies that bootlegged fake baby yoda merch mad absolute bank role and Disney was pissed. Love to hear it 😂
Yeah, legit question why Moff Gideon shoots his own stormtroopers? Was it different division or something?
The Producer has obtained Mangekyō Sharingan. Now, buying Canada is no longer a dream
Do top gun mvwrick
"With arms wide open that's my creed" LMFAO
Old Billy red balls
ok yes the group part was the gold of this sketch
Loved the cross over of Pitch Meeting and the Ryan George channel's style of playing more than 3 characters in the same episode
I'm so glad Producer Guy is finally taking steps to better his mental health and going to therapy 🙌 😌 🙏
loved the character development on this episode. so captivating!
Face scanner.... just to check you actually have a face, great security ... lol
The mandalorian pitch meeting I feel was “wanna finally make something good with the Star Wars ip we bought?”
Do ARROW Pitch Meeting
Heyshutup
hey do some Indian movies pitch meeting like bahubali or kgf or anyother
Will we ever get video game pitch meetings, or just going to stick to movies/shows?
"But money..." yeah, pretty much the Disney M.O. for absolutely everything they do these days. All else is a distant secondary concern at best.
🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Baby Yoda should have made enough to buy all of North America, not just Canada.
Now that was unexpected! Way to keep things fresh, Ryan. 👏👏
Hope u will do Halo series!
i cant wait for the destruction of Obi Wan lol it will be worse than the destruction of the Death Star
😂😂😂 fantastic
Creed is tight!
The Bostonian! Coming to Disney+ this fall.
“WITH ARRMS WIDE OOPAWWRN…that’s my creed”  🤣🤣🤣
Awoooooga sound, Animated Antics Anonymous. 😆
Oh wow, Dark Troopers. It's always nice to have stuff from the old Expanded Universe. Now if only they made them on model with the Phase 1 troopers from Dark Forces.
The fake mustache on top of his real mustache will never not make me laugh
I haven't watched a single episode of The Mandalorian, but I had to watch this pitch meeting and I'm not disappointed   Amazing!
Ryan Person Universe is tight!!
I love how I don't give a shit about any of the star wars thingies
“He’s from all of it!” 😂
Peak Pitch!
Good Pitch Meeting but I didn't like the filler material at the beginning !
Lol these keep getting better all the time, hope you guys do a Boba Fett Show one too :D
Why is nobody talking about the Creed reference?? XD it was my fav part of the video XDD
This was one of your best so far. I loved the added drama.
That CREED reference was tight. 😂
This is a masterpiece.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
OmgGgGgGGggGGGgg more characters in pitchmeeting is so tight
Loving the rapid little 'HeyShutUp' moments we get XD
Dropping the main plot for the money-eyes sidequest would have been even funnier for a Book of Boba Fett pitch.
The eye bit is PRICELESS!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 NEVER SAW that one coming
This might be the best pitch meeting ever.
Still hoping for a pitch meeting on The Phantom.
Mr Producer-guy's creed is tight!!!
Obi-Wan show might break Pitch Meeting.
Ryan universe is wild
*the channels are bleeding together, bc he is so tired of pitch meetings. & we get it, but cant let you stop. cant ever let you stop. cant stop. wont stop.* cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop. cant stop. wont stop.  -JC
I’d love to see a beavis and butthead pitch meeting, show or movie
If you guys don’t do a green knight pitch meeting I’m gonna lose my shit it’s the easiest movie to make fun of
So, are we all just ignoring the baby yoda eating the alien's eggs? We are? okay cool.
"Hey, shut up."
More character growth in 8 minutes than the entirety of Captain Marvel.
Wow there truly was character growth!!!
Felt like I was on Ryan's main page during that tangent😂😂
The Midollarian count was high. 😂
Holy crap that's the support group from the ryaniverse at 1:38! The RCU(Ryan cinematic University) IS REAL PPL!
How dare you sir. Ahsoka didn't spend several seasons being trained by Anakin in THE CLONE WARS, and beloved by millions of fans for several years, just to be passingly recognized from Star Wars Rebels.
This one took a *turn* and I am HERE FOR IT. I hadn't laughed that hard in weeks. You should explore outside the regular format and flex your comedic chops more!
Three thousand and FIRST!
I will unsubscribe like lightning if Pitch Meetings go the way of Nostalgia Critic and fills these videos with dumbass sketches like this.  Keep that separate, stick with the original format.
"He's from all of it!" I'm dead!!! Give this man ALL my money!!!!!
Wait.....was that the real reason we didn't see any Baby Yoda merch instantly, because they wanted to surprise us, and not due to incompetence?
pitch meeting clone wars
I’m dyingggggg the intro was great
One of my favorite movies growing up was “Logans Run”.  No one is allowed to live over 30 years old and they live in bubble cities.  A pitch meeting for that would be hysterical.
best part is when "and frickin Luke Skywalker shows up" "what he's from ALL of it"😂😂
Omg Creed! I had to rewind because I was laughing too much to hear the following jokes
Feels like Ryan had a skit for his other channel ready but thought it'd fit nicely in this pitch meeting
Some suggestions for pitch meetings: Top Gun and the sequel Jurassic World Dominion
Just saw new jurassic world movie. Pure dumpster fire. PLEASE DO A PITCH MEETING
The whole self-discovering joke was as derailed as Disney has been over the last few years😂😂 I love the way Ryan makes others aware of the cash-grabby behavior of production houses and that's the reason why these pitch meetings seem so fucking real and hilarious 😂
What a journey
Didn't really like the dollar signs bit when there were SO many insistences and illogical holes in this show. "So Mando's parents are going to bring him to this storm cellar/ bunker and then stand out in the open hugging him for a long time then put him down there alone when there was plenty of room/ time for all three of them to jump in the bunker."   Mando refuses payment in imperial credits, then works for them later on with no explanation.   Say something about the frog lady who Baby Yoda ate most of her children... then Mando asked them to babysit baby Yoda and they agreed.  So many more.
Finally. I've been waiting for the Mandalorian show pitch meeting.
Bit Money?
This took a left quick with the dollar sign eyes LMAO
Why are you still plugging terrible screen rant content?
That was a more then unexpected twist this episode, but I LOVED IT! More of these sidestorys in the future please 😍
The AI give me the chills
I did not expect the cha-ching to run like that.  That AI comment was so passive-hilarious.  It feels like Disney is trying to herd its customers away from loving "Baby Yoda." Which is why they gave him that ugly name.
The Creed bit is criminally underappreciated.
So we finally have a game for the guy: Producer Guy.  The mystery is fulfilled.
The Pitch Meeting Expanded Universe
The Boys pitch please
Has anyone else unsubscribed from the old channel these used to be on ??  ( I really cant remember its name)
Producer Guy had a side quest 😂
Hahaha “HE’S FROM ALL OF IT!”  🤣🤣🤣
Literally watched the remaining 3 episodes I had left from like a year ago for this pitch meeting hahah
Went a little hard in the paint there with this one didn’t you? Took a little side quest. You thinking of doing that so much that there is a spin off?
Highlander series pitch meetings would be super easy, barely an inconvenience!
The "Bostonians being a work of science fiction" joke is even funnier when you remember that Ryan is from Montréal and Bill is from Boston, meaning their NHL teams are bitter rivals. So Montréal Canadiens fan Ryan George being utterly dismissive, if not downright contemptuous of Boston Bruins fan Bill Burr is just an extra scoop of hilarious. I'm not sure if he planned that or I'm too high or yes.
Better than new trek
6:23 Sneaky fast “Hey, shut up” 😄
CREED
Well done sir!
Pitch meeting for Everything Everywhere All At Once next? 🙌🙌🙌
The comedy is strong in this one! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oh my gosh I’m in the middle of watching this video and the longest unrelated aside ever and I absolutely love it!  Ryan, please always be Ryan.
This was one of the best pitch meetings yet, just what I needed to get through the day 😁
Who knew there could be a great B story within a YouTube video…but somehow, HE found a way.
Woah, he’s doing character arcs now!
I didn't know Producer Guy going on a journey of self discovery in the middle of a Pitch Meeting was something I needed to see but I'm glad I did... and now I kinda of want Writer Guy to go on his own journey of self discovery.
Love handles named Man-Dough are TIGHT!
Ryan could be the best standup comedian that no one knows about.
producer guy's character growth arc and his love of money is still a better romance than twilight.
Props to Ryan for becoming a Therapist and doctor for a video even learnt to access toon powers
Hey shut up
What was once a childhood favorite about resisting a tyrannical government has become another omnipresent face of the empire.
I gave up on The Mandalorian as soon as they gave up on Gina Carano. Also, Pedo Pascal is on record for supporting Pedos and child diddlers.
Woah did you notice screenwriter guy called it a garbage can and producer guy called it a garbage bin?
Produce R. Guy. There you go.
The Pitch Meeting is getting some side stories now and I love it!
As a retired over the road truck driver. I can tell you taking a dump in one of those small office garbage cans *IS NOT TIGHT!! 😡*
You've been waiting to do this "dollar sign eyes" bit for a long time, haven't you?
The evil dead movies would be amazing for pitch meetings
Is Producer Guy getting his own Disney Plus show?
The Boys Putch Meeting please.
Finally!
So...what do the women in Ryan's universe look like, especially to be worth the aooga noise?  Also, Producer Guy had his very own side quest on an episode all about side quests. Top tier.
I loved every minute of that dollar signs for eyes tangent and how it just kept going on and on 😄
He's a Bostonian lol 😆 😂
LMAO.  Nice one as usual. But you forgot to show the combined rated G cuteness combined with the Rated R gore and violence.  :P ;)
The deep-dive into Producer Guy's expanding money powers was fascinating. Can't wait for them to have a whole movie about how money saved him from the situation that killed his mom and trained him up to get revenge on the antagonist by bleeding them dry.
"He's a Bostonian".  They have funny voices.
Love how he just put a normal Ryan George sketch in this pitch meeting
$‘s coming out of eyes… True Disney+  Producer stories!
Rocky Balboa universe please.
If this is how Disney writes their modern Star Wars shows then it would finally make sense to me.
I watched this like 10 times just because of the self discovery journey. Ryan is why I open YouTube.
Alright, do The Book of Boba Fett next!
Please make the pitch meeting on suits... Season by season demolition will be perfect...
I didn't know producer guy can sing! 🎶😄 Now you've done it. We are going to be expecting more serenades in the future 🎤😉
One of the best episodes , good job Ryan :)
I think i recognize one of the guys from the support group scene... The second one...
Did he just do a SIDE QUEST!?
I wheezed at the creed bit 🤣🤣🤣
Nailing Hollywood’s incessant need for money over quality is tight!
With arms wide ooooopaaaannnn
Leave a like so we can forever UNSUB  Screen Rant ❤️
“With arms wide open” is my Creed too hahaha
forced to hit thumb down. subliminal messaging is tight!
im confused!! why luke is there??? in the star wars film, yoda was already grown up when luke was there!!! wtf? pls explain
Keep being you. <3
Does Scott Stapp have Ryan’s face in this universe?
Harry potter half blood prince pls
this intro really went places...
I had no idea where that journey of self discovery segue was going, but I loved it!
My body also does something similar when i see pretty women... Pretty Women are Tight (but some aren't 😉)
If you don't mind me asking, will we get a pitch meeting for the "top gun : maverick ". That movie was phenomenal.
👍
Not making baby Yoda merch is costing them millions, which in turn is keeping them from buying Canada
LOL that formula is so real that by the end of the first season I've noticed it and that made me drop the show 'cause it was so obvious that made me lose interest
What a twist. This is my multiverse of madness
"wut kinda creature is he?" "uhh bostonian"
I laughed way too hard at the Creed bit 🤣🤣
When we look back, this will be considered the turning point of Pitch Meetings from silly jokes to full on Sitcom
Damn, referencing the old-school cartoon wolf. Nicely done.
Man the Ryanverse is canon now :D
Can you do Mission: Impossible pitches? Thanks!
"With arms wide open! Thats my creed."
This is the moment Ryan George's channel and the Pitch Meeting channel became one.
Lmao imagine this is the first pitch meeting someone watched.
The “With arms wide open, that’s my creed” got a good pop out of me thank you.
Pitch Meeting need his own movie
This reminds me of the first time I saw my girlfriend and my chest started having a heart shaped protrusion pumping 3 ft in and out of it or when I smelled a pie and started floating on air towards it.
5:17 has me in tears
Please do the original Power Rangers movie
My favorite character is Cara Dune. Moff Gideon is a close second tho.
Oh I can't wait for the boba fett one.
Please do Rubber
Tight tight tight 😅
I'd love to see a pitch for RRR!
LOL!
WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN
I absolutely love this guy.
"With ahrms wide ophernnn! That's my creed." - Gold.
I was expecting top gun maverick.
"He's a Bostonian"  "I love science fiction"
"Freakin Luke Skywalker!" "He's from all of it!" Is hands down my favorite recognition line.
Epic
LMAO that whole "Cha Ching" bit had me dying. This is the best so far for me. Dude had to go to the hospital after the dollar sign thing. Absolute GOLD!!!!!
I really loved the group therapy section. 😂 I’m glad he got the answers he needed.
I hope you’re doing pitch meetings for all the other Star Wars shows as well
Me: why did the producer guy just didn't wait until the pitch to go to the doctor  Ryan: so the video could happen, now i need you to get off my back about this  Me: sure, let me get off that thing
Ngl, after the first few minutes I had to go check my calendar and make sure it wasn't April 1st.
Bostonian.... Geez I love aliens! Most true line ever spoken in one of these videos!!
I thought this show finally showed everyone that Stormtroopers aim fine, their blasters are just shit.
I'm so glad I can actually subscribe to these now
Best episode yet!,🤣🤣
“With arms wide open” that’s my Creed!  LOVE IT!! 🤣🤣 Saw them in concert!!
The length of time spent on Producer Guy's existential crisis about his dollar sign eyes had me rolling! Amazing!
💚
The level of introspection by Producer Guy....so inspiring....sniff.... I'm not crying...somethings in my eye...they look like green dollar signs.
that producer guy tangent really caught me offguard
Now we have fucking world building hahahaha you’re amazing
I love that the "hey, shut up" is now a standard joke!
Best One Yet !!!!
Wayyyyyy too late
What a blessing
With arms wide open, that's my Creed! hahahahaha brilliant :)
I love the producer guy's character development!
Im so fuckin happy I watched the first episode right when it was released and got surprised by baby yoda at the end
“With arms wide open.” That got me rollin!
"but Money!!...???" "but my Money!....???" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This entire video was absolute gold Ryan, absolute gold.
I totally appreciate this recap before the new season of The Mandalorian.
The Ryan-verse is in full strength!
OMFG double points for the Creed reference 😂
I was not disappointed or impatient for even a second when we went on a trip with Producer Guy before the pitch, lol. Loved it.
Baby Yoda is a surprise to be sure but a welcomed one
WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN!
30% of this video is about Producer Guy having a self-discovery about himself loving money.
"With arms wide open! That's my Creed." 🤣🤣🤣
Please do a Pitch Meeting for The Witcher!
Very valuable merchandising opportunity that they did not cash in on for over a year. They dropped the ball on that.  All because Jon Favreau did not want to spoil the secret reveal.
Wow wow wow. Wow. Best Pitch Meeting ever. The cutaways were great. "With Arms Wide Open" 🤣
Bravo!!  Dude, that was tight!
So this is PM jumping the shark
Actually the lack of baby Yoda merch was due to Kathleen Kennedy not wanting it to interfere with Rise of the Sky Walker merchandise.  Of course that movie flopped and everyone fleed to this shownfor good Star wars content.
I request The Book of Boba Fett next please
Love it! Won't even mention the dollar sign eyes being a serious medical condition that Simpsons did it :)
That side quest was TIGHT!
The creed reference killed me, I think I need someone to TAKE ME HIGHER
I love this so much.  The therapy group for cartoon manifestations….
"He's from ALL OF IT!"
I love how the pitch meeting and the ryanverse are starting to converge 😂😂😂!!!
Pretty good, can't wait for the Book of  Boba Fett one, sometimes featuring boba fett. The cartoon manifestations thing though, that was excellent.
Pitch Meeting side quests of growth anout money are tight! 😂
Gold!!!
MAC AND ME PITCH MEETING
Good grief! Now all I can hear is “Man dough”
So Din had to go to a lot of effort to get the armour back from Cobb Vanth who had no claim to it but just wanted it cos he liked it. Din had to kill a literal dragon which literally ate him to get the armour back. Yes he could have just attempted to kill Cobb, but even if he succeeded, the entire town would stop at nothing to kill him to avenge their Marshal. While Din would be able to get out of the situation with ease, he would have much worse luck if he for some reason didn't have any armour.   Boba showed Din proof that he was indeed a Mandalorian and instantly got the armour back.   But no, silly Boba Fett for asking the Mandalorian warrior instead of just getting it straight from Cobb.
So basically the Helmet is a Islamic Hijab? It’s done for religious reasons.
We are through the looking glass here, people…
Honestly my issue with the show is that there is absolutely no tension. No one good dies (except that 1 dude but that’s it) and he literally has armor that can tank a E-Web.
Sometimes I watch a bad show/movie, and can’t wait for the pitch meeting. Then sometimes I watch a good show/movie and I dread the pitch meeting… this is one of those times
Creed = esti que j’l’ai rit!
Coincidentally I was just at the Hobby Lobby today and I saw a plastic baby Yoda toy for sale in their toy section.  I was wondering exactly how much money people are making with this character.  Then I got home and saw the new pitch meeting and....well....
Producer Guy really went to the “it did, didn’t it” support group which is also connected to Star Wars. 😨🤯
Jumped the shark?! Yeah yeah yeah
I just realized that the Mandalorian is the 1963 TV show The Fugitive, but in space. He’s on the run and helps a different person solve the problem each episode. Plus he has a tiny green baby puppet that’s a better character than 99% of what’s in TV and movies. OK maybe the last part wasn’t in the fugitive, but it should’ve been!
With my arms wide open! That’s my creed also
Man I lost it with the creed reference! Well done guys
Need a spin off on producer guy
More emotional depth in “producer guy” than the entire cast of Kenobi
I want to vacation in this timeline where everyone is Ryan George.
Masterpiece
You guys are the best! Both of you!
514 represent
this got off track fast lol
Stranger Things Season 4 Pitch Meeting would be awesome.
The writing on these is infinitely better than the actual movies& series xD
Could you do a pitch meeting for Zombieland?
You know this was a pretty good commentary on how difficult it can be as a patient to get doctors to believe/understand your condition if their initial diagnoses are unable to detect anything.
HES FROM ALL OF IT!
Bostonian😂
I had to pause the video to laugh for a minute straight when he started singing Creed.
Kids who didn't watch Looney Tunes will have no idea what you're talking about.
I think this may be my favorite pitch meeting yet. The fact that it was completely derailed for two minutes to do an extended surreal joke was just perfect.
"He's aaa.... Bostonian" "OhhHhhhH I love science fiction!"
Can you do one of these about an actually good movie where producer guy keeps suggesting horrible edits but the writer ignores him?
I can't wait to see you roast Jurassic World: Dominion. I just saw it today and it was... something.
Thank you Ryan this made my night. 😂 😂 😂 One of the BEST pitch meetings ever.  Olso loved how going in the pitch meeting carachter development way implied that mandalorian was and is a really good TV show.  👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻
Ryan needs to give Producer Guy a raise. He loves money afterall.
YODA HAS YOUR COOKIES!
Love the combo of PM and First Guy.
Giancarlo Esposito and the blue pineapple liqueur make Mandalorian a Breaking Bad sequel.
Nice change of pace, Ryan really is great at these
I’ve been waiting for this for a while
DON'T COUNT YOUR CHICKENS!
with arms wide open thats my creed i laughed so hard i crapped myself crapping myself is TIGHT
This kinda felt like a Ryan George sketch at points, do you know him? He's got a great channel, I think you'd love it. Kinda looks like you too, and a little bit like the writer guy.
The collab between  Pitch Meeting and Ryan George youtube channels must has been super easy, barely an inconvenience to coordinate.
Hi, my name is "pitch meeting fan guy".
That self help quest was TIGHT!!!
As a Bostonian I approve this message
I swear Idk what's better pitch meeting or 90s time machine.
Is the music behind the therapy scene supposed to be like this is us? Lolol. This is hilarious
Emmy winning performance 👏
I like how he put a Ryan George video in the pitch meeting video
I get it; Producer guy went on a side quest while learning about a show of side quests. Tight!
Yay! I would really like to see a PITCH MEETING about the animated movie HEAVY METAL.
This got deep and hilarious, really fast.
"with arms wide open"  that too is my creed. so is "my sacrifice"
The lore expands
The brilliance of this pitch meeting series is how he constantly finds ridiculous things that even I don’t notice
I wanna see pitches for super obscure 50s movies where there's always a guy in a rubber costume, a military haircut lead with a 4 letter name, and a woman who screams in fear without running or acting with amy semblance of self preservation.
I'm still wondering why you didn't point out Luke's CGI face, but the whole sequence with producer guy was gold
Ooh Awooga
I love how Ryan transitions so smoothly and fast from the meeting to doctor appointment to therapy to group therapy assuming that we are not dumb and will understand what’s going on, unlike most media nowadays.
The dollar signs tho! XD Every time I get used to your routine, you throw me a curveball. This is why I love this channel!
Producer guy has more character development than most new Star Wars characters
"With arms wide open" That's my Creed!!!
Ryan, you did a great job with this whole skit, every part of it. Producer guys, you did a great job letting us in on your development. Writer guy, I think you forgot to say "ye-ye-yeah" lol
Appreciate the Pitch Meeting for Mando, but should we get a Pitch Meeting for Top Gun: Maverick soon? This movie is probably going to be at least the top 3 highest grossing summer movie domestically. There are a few other blockbusters coming up back-to-back - Jurassic World Dominion, Lightyear, Elvis, Minions, Thor: Love & Thunder. We could always save Mando for quieter times during fall.
7:47 the way it’s phrased makes it sound like Luke is taking Mando to train him and not Baby Yoda
I do miss "get all the way off my back" but "HeyShutup!" is hilarious.
The line that makes producer the happiest: "He's from the other thing." Crossovers are tight.
That journey of self discovery was completely unexpected and so good. I’m glad that Ryan never runs out of ideas for this series.
stick to the topic
I think I enjoyed the Creed joke more than I should have. 😂
My favourite pitch meeting ever
Omg! You have bested yourself!!!
2,000
Can you guys do a top gun pitch meeting, both of them.
1:45 its the mask, he is referring to the mask, LOL
Lol I’m surprised this wasn’t made forever ago 😂
only way I would have improved this is the few more times he said Baby Yoda to have the cha-thing sound effect.
Can we get an updated Morbius 🤣🤣
Aroooga Best yet. I did a genuine LOL @ the Creed gag
Too many highlights in this one to name - 8+ minutes of comedy gold.
Awesome! Now do DUNE
This video having the random side quests like some of these Disney shows
Cara Dune
This is basically 2 videos and it's hilarious. One of the best pitch meetings yet
Money eyes bit was hilarious
I always thought the term "losing millions" was such a bad way to word missed opportunities.  I'm imagining a car salesman being the top seller every single day but still going home with the thought he lost money because he didn't sell more.
This pitch meeting has more character development than the obi-wan series
Yes more characters. More more I love these man.
Going off the rails and becoming a regular Ryan George skit? Not what I expected but I'm here for it.
9 minutes to spend on an entire series, and half of it wasted in a hacky sketch...
This just gets better omg. Love the development of the Producer Guy hahaha really good
"Think about it, every reaction youtuber and twitch girls will have to buy a baby yoda puppet"
“with ARMS WIDE OPENN, that’s my creed” i laughed so hard i had to tell somebody
Something something side quest *Interstellar and The Martian next please!*
"with arms wide open!" - iCry! take aaaaalll the win, Ryan!
“With aaaarms wide open”. Lol
"And I was thinking we get Giancarlo Esposito to play Moff Gideon." "So this Moff Gideon character, what's his personality?" "I just told you, he's Giancarlo Esposito."
Talking about the Storm Troopers, I'm surprised he didn't bring up the fact that the worst wound Mando suffers is when he nicks his own leg with his sword.
A better character arc than Obi Wan
I’ve been waiting for this for a very long time
Should've just been the clip of Patton Oswalt's cameo on Parks and Rec.
Ahhhhh ooooooo gaaaah!
That Creed reference dropped like a bomb and DAMN chest bump
Brilliant as usual 😂😂😂
Took you long enough
The Ryanverse has arrived and I am here for it
Yep. Yep. Pitch meeting suggestions: The Gentlemen [2019]
I got goosebumps as you got closer to Episode 16. Good writing always does. Thanks for the memories.
This went off the rails so quick...and I loved every second of it!
What a weird bit the eye dollar sign rolled into but good on them for the risk and for pulling it off! Stupidly brilliant
This was a nice twist.
3:36 "Very Endorable!"
Boston: You’ll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
Well, that certainly took a turn.
Anyone who is seeing this as their first pitch meeting must be so confused 😂
I wonder if the producer guy even notices the "Hey, shut up". 😂😂 Also, I miss "yeah sure, I don't care". It's been a while since you last used it.
You should do the office
Great Producer Guy side quest!  _That was from the other thing!_
Very surprised there was a 3 minute “side quest” skit in a pitch meeting. Is it because Ryan has more creative control now without SR? Is it because after 250 videos he thinks the pitches need a lil more than just him in a room? It looks like it could have been a regular video on his main channel, “producer guy discovers baby yoda”.   I loved it, pitch meetings, and you Ryan; just an odd twist changing the formulae, if new viewers came and have to wait 3 minutes before the pitch starts. Don’t know just curious.  Anyone have any thoughts?   Ps. Make sure to like the video to show it was a good decision
Are those the same therapy patients from "it did, didn't it?"?
Are these actual articles
LOVE these more intricate ones. The side story was great 💯🖤 #askbelievereceive #abundanceishere #abundantmentality #abundantenergy #2022bestyearever
Brilliant
isn't the producer wanted to buy Canada? he needs tons load of money to achieve his dream right. who can blame him for liking money that much.
You could have easily covered The Book of Boba Fett in this too.  It was basically The Mandalorian Season 2.5 anyway.
He missed the chance to use a bed as a bathroom lol.
I hate everything Disney Wars is.
So Yoda trains Luke and luke trains "baby yoda". Aorry dont remember his nameh
Dead ass you could do another series based solely off of this skit you’re that good
Batman V.S. Teenage mutant ninja turtles.
As a Bostonian I can tell you that as long as Dunks is in Star Wars and nobody trash talks Larry Bird I don't mind being an alien species.
Thank you for doing this one. Please do Yellowstone please please please!!!
This is kinda of a longer Pitch Meeting, maybe theres is something about money grab...
The dollar sign segment made me forget this was a pitch meeting and not a Ryan George indie sketch
Producer guy turned into Nami
The therapist costume alone made me laugh
this guy created an entire support group that is quite literally for self help using only himself
Should've seen that Creed thing coming... Very disappointed I didn't  You never did the Defender shows, right?
Remember when he played Dad and Jason!  https://youtu.be/pvERJ7CSD8I
Mayfeld the bald orange freckled Boston ex-imperial sharp-shooting cünt
Brilliant!
The story line with producer guy.
Him quickly saying "hey shut up" is the funniest thing every time and idk why
This is the best episode of Pitch Meeting.
This is no ordinary Pitch Meeting, I'm gunna have to do multiple viewings to unpack everything here.  You've excelled yourself here Ryan 😍
Top Gun 1 and 2?
He cooperated with himself this time! He didn't here! https://youtu.be/ffk8maxvRxo
Nothing about how retarded practically everything in this series is? I forced myself to watch all episodes from bit torrent. I feel like I've been violated every episode. Like I've been skull-fucked by Jon favreau. In much the same way as I felt after seeing the vomitous Avatar. Both make me feel ill: with despicable and stupid premises, and moronic scripts. The only thing which is correct is how things look.  And everywhere is a stupid desert, where nothing grows. Why would you live on a planet like that? The show-runner is an absolute idiot.
Kkkkkkkkk
Dr Ryan, Psychiatrist Ryan and animated Ryan the Ryan verse is expanding
Love this.
Instead of Mandalorian pitch meeting,  this video should be named "The producer in the Multiverse of Madness"
I was waiting for the cash eyes 🤑 again but it never came 😔
Just my opinion, but the tangent with the dollar sign eyes and the group therapy just felt so unnecessary. Fell kinda flat for me.  The rest was comedic gold as usual. It's good to try new things, though.
So is Producer Guy and Pitch Guy part of the Ryanverse? I was thinking the other day that they should do a cross over.
wait wait wait... how is this "baby Yoda" and Boba Fett is there? isn't Yoda like 300 years old? Or is it just called "Yoda" because George Lucas never bothered giving the species a name? so what do they do if 2 of the same meet? who decides who is Yoda 1 and 2?
You know what I learned from this episode. Ryan looks great in a wide variety of hats, glasses and outfits. That was my ultimate takeaway.
WHAT IS THIS???? god I love this channel, I don't care anymore about de recaps, give me the development of this characters lmao
I'm amazed a pitch meeting was not made for this show earlier!
Honestly that dollar sign bit is all I needed. Don't even need to watch the rest of the pitch meeting.
Let’s ask the real questions. Was the woman a Ryan with a wig or was it Julia?
Lmao the low key jab about a sad part in the show, but showing the bad CGI on  Luke ....genius
Hey man, this channel is for Pitch Meetings! And Not, I say NOT, supposed to cross over with your other channel with all the disgusting stuff, my elderly mother watches this channel man/men! Get it together and get more organized!  https://youtube.com/c/MovingMindStudio
The Taken series really needs a pitch meeting💡
Oh wow a new pitch meeting with funny jokes that are also painfully accurate is tight!
If you feel the need to skip the "Journey of Discovery" bit, it's 3:17 to get back to the actual Pitch Meeting.  Just in case you wanted to know that.
He told the producer guy to shut up so fast I didn't even catch it at first😅
Disney didn't lose millions from lack of Baby Yoda merch, they made as much as they would have, it was just delayed a lil bit.
Do a cars pitch meeting, like how have u not done that yet!?
This went off the rails in the best way.
“Baby Yoda”?  How to tell the world you never seen the series. Lol
Well that was a tangent
Loving this, but still waiting on Transformers 1984. You will not complete the Transformers series until you have seen the animated movie that slaughters most of the cast of toys.
I always saw Mando as more big brother program rather than father figure, I see Luke Skywalker being the father, and Season 3 is going to introduce us to Hot Yoda, Baby Yoda's Hot Mom!
That eye skit was fantastic. And I didn't entirely predict what would happen. I expected the same thing would happen to the optometrist.
This is just my 2 cents but pitch meetings are better when they come out later.  Especially if they're apart of a bigger universe.
TREMORS
here comes the lore
That producer side quest when talking about a show made of side quests was amazing.
It's not baby fuckin yoda! (But genius though)
is there a Breaking Bad pitch meeting?
Please make pitch meeting about the chucky serie
If a tangent was a person  🤣
I made a similar Creed joke at the same time. 🤯
If Ryan ‘meta’ put the side quest in his video as a reference to Mandalorian, he should the keys to the city of Montreal.
ahhWOOOOOOOga
AMAZING  …oh wait 🤑
Wow, that Pitch Meeting went bounds beyond what I could have expected... and I'm totally down with it.
How about a pitch meeting for Tropic Thunder? So much to cover with that movie! Should be fun!
The Boys pitch meeting!!
Quite the side quest on this side quest heavy pitch meeting.
Oof that was painful to watch. Dislike for you Dawg
Man I didn't expect the whole Ryan multiverse in one single pitch meeting
What about a Rampage pitch meeting?
Aw, waiting to use a ZOOM until you're well over 200 episodes is tight!
Hahaha this one was so freaking good!
Things I'd like to see for a pitch meeting:  Dennis the Menace (Lloyd and Matthau)  The Mummy trilogy (Fraiser) Encino Man (sequel in the works)   That's all I got for the moment
"With arms wide open" LOL
Hahaha that montage about his eyes was amazing.
I took a dab hit right as the dollar signs appeared and now I'm going to cough forever
The Ryan George/Pitch Meeting crossover we never knew we wanted 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
the dollar signs might be the greatest gag ever on these sketches. had me rolling.
HE'S FROM ALL OF IT! .... okay the money eyes was a lil drawn out but damn.. you got me with that one lmao.
5:35 Real aggressively. Been a thing for a long time, but they're really leaning into it now that they're being outed as plagiarists and most of their artists and writers are creatively bankrupt.
That Creed joke...I am deceased 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You’re brilliant. How you keep the pitch meetings fresh is a sight to behold.
Wow this was a next level episode 🤯
A random comment
I do love this channel and this guy. But dear Ryan could you be a little bit more consistent in your content? I subscribed after the order of Phoenix video. Since it was the 4th on the theme that interested me at the time. And i surely appreciate the first minutes of the above video, but since I have never seen the Mandalorian, was it? The rest of the video means nothing to me. P.S. don't hate me, I'm just trying to help this fantastic guy?
I love AI. I'd totally put my trust in a good big bro AI that wants to keep me around as a pet. I'm super loyal and house trained!
Great, now I really don't have to watch that show.
Pitch meeting shouldn’t veer from the script so much, the extra stuff wasn’t necessary
"He's from all of it!"   Lmao
Do Free Guy and Ninjago
Bostonions huh? So do they just drink alot of Sam Adam's and hate the Yankees? Lol
Pitch The Prestige, but have the producer guy guess the twists. Guessing twists is tight!
But how will we get Producer Guy this rich character growth in a short amount of time, that sounds really hard.  Actually it's super easy, barely inconvenience.  Oh really?
Producer guy had an existential crisis
We need more Producer Guy lore
If this Youtube thing doesn't work out for Ryan, he can always start a Creed cover band.
So good you and the Drinker is the only reason I go on YouTube anymore  Thanks you
I really needed this lol
"Baby Yoda's lack of merch might be costing Disney millions"  SIGH!... I hate that way of thinking that has become so common in corporations.  Costing money is not the same thing as missing out on an opportunity for profit. It's only  costing money when it's an actual loss, meaning money was invested that wasn't earned back.   But if you are already making profit and you are like "I could have done this and made more profit" then it's not costing you anything. It's not a failure. It's just a missed opportunity.
It just turned into a Ryan George sketch half way through love it
Going on a random detour from a Pitch Meeting vid to showcase what should clearly be its own Ryan George skit?  Should’ve saved that for the Book of Boba Fett pitch meeting.
WITH ARMS WIDE OPAAAAN! I had to take a pause to wheeze
The nonchalance of Scriptwriter Guy when he says "shut up" is something!
I used to think I'm the meanest, roughest, toughest hombre that's ever crossed the Rio Grande - and I ain't o namby-bamby! But it turned out that I was actually the hootin'est, tootin'est, shootin'est, bob-tail wildcat, in the west!
I love that a Pitch Meeting about a show with endless side quests goes on a huge a side quest.
I love the new concept
Ah, that moment where you can only press the like button once. I suppose I'll go pet a dog or something.  There's just... so much like to express!
loved the sidequest!
Grogu
I respect what you tried here. But it didn't work. You can make the formula work in future episodes.
Please do a pitch meeting for Everything Everywhere All at Once…that was a wacky wild ride
What was producer guys name before he became a producer
Hilarious how much you milked Producer Guy going insane over the merchandising opportunity.
“He’s a Bostonian.” Me: laughs wicked hahd
Wonderful! Please do Top Gun: Maverick.  Don't tell a soul, but your pitch meetings are far, far more entertaining than most of the movies they are about. All good wishes, Ryan.
Producer guy is becoming self aware!! Abort abort!!
I never know if these parodies make me laugh, or cry.
omg, best pitch meeting so far.  lol!
Didn't enjoy this. Much.
It is NOT okay to like money.
Hiding a Ryan George sketch in a Pitch Meeting is tight
Script writer guy says garbage can, and producer guy says garbage bin. Interesting.
the pedro pascal escort mission genre ft. the mandalorian and tlou
GhostBusters please! Or Snatch if you want 21st century!
That joke went way too long.
I've been watching Pitch Meetings too long, I said, "then fricking Luke Skywalker shows up" right along with him. Time to go on an introspective journey of self-discovery for like 3 days.
This is hands down my favorite pitch meeting
Dude you are on fire!!!!!
NETFLIX SHOW WHEN!?!!?!??!
I wish you would have included jokes about how Book of Bobba is Mando 2.5!!!
That Creed reference was TIGHT!
You should do Leon the professional
Amazing. WOW Wow wow!
Best one yet
He's out of line, but he's right.
I turned my back on Disney because they turned their back on me.  They won't get another dime of my money.
Wow wow wow, wow.
This has been my favorite pitch meeting ever. I have seen all of them multiple times. I also fall asleep to them...   Don't judge me. Keep it up Ryan!
At about the 2.5 minute mark I stopped caring about the actual pitch and just wanted to see what becomes of producer guy. I feel like we need an origin story video now 🤑
Can't wait for the Kenobi pitch meeting.
They're not pushing reliance upon A.I. for any sort of nefarious reason. It's not like they've been using predictive programming or anything. It's not screens could possibly manipulate our nervous system's. Definitely don't look into US PATENT 6506148.
Pitch Meeting of the year right here! Also, I heard that guy talking about seeing a pretty woman so much that I now want to see a ‘Pretty Woman’ pitch meeting 😅
Plz do the Final Destination franchise
Lol Hilarious, Producer guy ends up in Therapy and AA
Can you do the original superman movies.
This was a trip. The "journey of self-discovery" had me in (I believe the term is) stitches
You should do the Riddick movies?
Bostonian killed me. That was perfect.
This dollar sign bit is amazing!
This has so be one of the funniest
Awesome love the new type
My least favorite of the Pitch Meetings.    Ironic, how plot points that are mainly filler within a movie are criticized by you and then you do the same thing.  Kettle, meet pot.
Creed jokes are tight!
Please do AH and JD trial pitch meeting.
LOL
Was a baby groot reference too obvious?
The Ryan George multiverse is vastly superior to the mcu phase 4.
🎶 with arms wide open 🎶
“He’s from ALL of it!” Got me!
I wish the video just derailed 100% with the dollar signs for 10 straight minutes XD
Jumping the shark is tight!
I've been waiting for this Pitch Meeting for a good while! And it seems he may have the same "disease" as Mr Krabs.
Bostonian LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL
This was the Ryan Universe equivalent of the Avengers. Wow wow wow
Hopefully you will do a pitch meeting fr the Halo TV series in the future.
The ending should have been Producer Guy sitting in white room saying "This jacket is tight."
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PITCH MEETING
In actuality this was the greatest pitch meeting of all time, Favreau and Filoni style.
Mando huh? That's what I call my love handles. 🤣 Fking genuis and...quite a god name for em to be honest.
There's so much happening in this PM lol Ryan is still finding ways to improve and expand his content, like it wasn't excellent already. Good job, sir.
0:58 I was really waiting for all their eyes to light up in dollar signs from the treatments they were gonna offer
This Pitch Meeting is simultaneously hilarious and depressing...
One of Ryan's 'other' videos has merged with one of his pitch meetings to create a hybrid video that YT will either love, or skip to 3 minutes in.
"What kind of creature is he?" "He's a Bostonian." "I love science fiction." One of the best exchanges in Pitch Meeting history.
"Am I dying?!!!" *smiles* "I don't know"
I guess Baby Yoda eating Frog People's babies was too much for even Pitch Meeting to tackle.
Producer Guy officially had more character growth in 8 minutes than Rey had in an entire trilogy.
A spinoff from the main storyline is tight
He found the $-) thread mid-write and just went with it i bet.
That's my Creed. Chest bumps
That was an amazing character arc
I was not expecting such a massive deviation from the pitch
"He's a Bostonian." 😂😂😂
Ryan, do you still do the Adstronaut. Honestly the only ads I watch in their entirety. Kudos!
This episode made me so happy that I just started floating and this weird ray of light was there and when I realized what was happening I freaked out and fell from ceiling-height causing me to hit my shin on the coffee table on the way down. I don't know who to talk to about this aside from the YouTube comment section of the internet.
I *really* LOVE that sketch you put in there haha
Ahooga horns matter. F in the chat for ahooga horns.
"The First Guy to Ever Have Dollar Signs in His Eyes"
Oh man. I remember playing that Creed album on repeat during my 1999 school Japanese class’s trip to Japan. And being teased because I was being a weirdo loner. And then Creed ruined it by remastering the tacks in a way that was palatable to mainstream audiences so they could release music videos. Always keep your original mp3s kids :(
Southland tales
Sweeping character arcs are tight!
Someone reverse play his creed and tell me what it is 05:16
Ryan in the plaid shirt is sexy
Going off on tangents is tight!
"He's from the other thing!" is pretty much Star Wars entire strategy now
Oh my god! You’ve never been so far!!! That fills as absolute as the perfect diagnosis of Disney’s missed opportunity with Star Wars potential. Thanks !
Please pitch the Evil Dead franchise
PLANET OF THE APES (all),  Please do next/soon  thx
You'd think this series would have peaked long ago, but apparently not.
He’s from all of it!! 😂😂😂
sir, you took me on a ride.
I thought yoda trained Luke
I think I speak for all people with faces who access things when I say I wasn’t bothered.
Funniest episode in several episodes!! Loved the sketch inside this series of sketches 🤣
Yes!!!!!!  Do Kenobi next..  You know,  cause it's stupid.
bro this turn such a strong turn lmfao i love it
Lore
those first 3min made this the best pith meeting ever hahahahahahaha
But... But money
Speaking of living millions you should be charging for this...
I loved the Pitch Meeting! However, I wish he went further in depth for each season.
My mother always said, "YOU GOTTA COMMIT TO THE BIT!"
Yes...just YES to this whole skit 👏🏾👏🏾😂
I had to stop this video so many times coz i couldn't stop laughing LOOOOOOOL
The Ryanverse is expanding!
DEEPEST LORE
What movies we want to see pitches for?  ALL OF THEM
I loved the Producer guys side quest! It was also like there was a sketch from Ryan's personal channel in there
please do "The Edge"! 1997... Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins fighting a bear.... could be awesome.
This episode must have been crazy expensive, how did you get so many people in it ?
wow, wow, wow...wow
Imagine how powerful, how poignant, it would have been had Mando not taken the helmet off until he had to say goodbye to Grogu.  Whoopsie!
You guys should do speed racer
I dropped my phone laughing when he went to the doctor. Too good.
Dude you are hilarious
Great as always Ryan! Not sure if you've done one before, but I'd love to see a Pitch Meeting for The 5th Element! I know Writer and Producer Guys would do it justice! Thanks for all the fun!
AWOOOOOOGAAAaaaaahem excuse me
Now everytime I hear Mando I'm gonna think about Ryan's love handles. I don't want that image in my head!! Get Out!!
This is the best one! Brilliant! 🤣💯👌🏾
Thank you Ryan
LMAOOOO “WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN!” 💀💀
Been watching Pitch Meeting for years now... by far the best one yet! Well done! Thanks for the years of fun times "pitch guy" and "producer guy".
Do a Cobra Kai pitch meeting !!!
😂😂😂
Please god do Boba Fett
But Money....
This might be a new high bar for Pitch Meetings.  That side quest for Producer Guy was TIGHT!
#TeamProducerGuy 💰 🤑 💸 💲 🪙 💶
Where’s the super like button?
👍🏻
No controversy You didnt mention Gina C
That's my Creed too 👍
5:17 OMG 🤣
Please do Labyrinth....thank you
The writer guy already put his faith in the AI's algorithm. He's been pitching every script the script writing AI spits out.
Producer guy's genuine utter idiotic glee when he recognizes that a thing is from another thing he knows is so fucking funny every time. Such a concise and scathing indictment of the general public lol I'm here for it
Ryan must be making a lot of money. He hired so many new actors for this episode. I'm happy for him.
Ryan verse is my my favourite multiverse of all time
But...my money :inserts sad face
That's my creed... lmao
“He’s from all of it!” 😄
these really do keep getting better, hahahaha
"What kind of crazy creature is he?" "He's a Bostonian"  "I love science-fiction"
I always wondered why Mando could access the imperial face scanner thing. I assumed that it was because he used to be a storm trooper, but I kinda hate that answer as it ruins his character.
Do a pitch meeting for Pulp Fiction!
Multiverse of Ryan
My god! The 'side story' withthe support group was pure gold! XD
Surprised you didn't mention the tracker things that just so happen to know the exact location of the bounty at all times until they don't for some reason
Does Ryan George watch EFAP per chance? .. I get the feeling that a lot of these insights I’ve seen and heard on EFAP! Cool if so .. though how could anyone not arrive at the same conclusion that the Man-Dough show is formulaic c-rap!
"I've been standing here for 3 days!"  XD
"he's aa...a bos-to-ni-an :)"
*AMAZING!* Read It in his voice
You should make a Pitch Meeting on all the Predators movies
If you loved the side quest in this episode but you aren't subscribed to Ryan George's other channel then... y'know... you should get on that. 😀
It was nice to hear that something was a baby and a formula, but no shortage.
You have to do The Boys!!
Pitch meeting for Memento!!!
I love when Ryan sneaks in an entire Ryan George sketch from the Ryan George Universe© into the Ryan George sponsored Screenrant Pitch Meetings
I was frustrated for Disney when they didn't have Baby Yoda merchandise. I'm a salesman, I love money too.
"How toyetic can you get?" - Freakazoid
Therapeutic discovery, reflection and reconciliation to build a more sustainable and productive life is TIGHT.
That transition from hey shut up to him talking about the other mandolorians was so smooth I almost missed it. 😂
WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN
With arms wide open! What? That’s my Creed.   I’m wheezing, send help
Please do a Pitch Meeting for The Room! :)
Ryan George and I convinced The Beatles that we all live in a yellow submarine.
Went all out for this one!
They get better every time 😂😂
That was the most insane pitch meeting opening I’ve ever seen!
Lmao this has to be one of my favorites so far
Segways into a bigger universe is tight
Trust me, it's not the lack of Baby Yoda merchandise costing Disney millions.
Was construction worker ryan was awoogaing at another, prettier ryan? Because pretty sure Julie wouldn't stand for that in this universe...
This video was extra Ryan Georgey and I love it
We need a Pitch meeting for The Room
Pitch 'Love Actually' please.
PITCH SUGGESTION: Cold Pursuit(2019) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0phuNQQ_gHI
Producer guys story has more depth then any of disneys recent poltical documentarys 🥰😍🤩
😆🤣😂
"With arms wide open!"..."That's my Creed."
Best Pitch Meeting Ever!
Probably one of the most bonkers and funniest PMs I’ve ever seen. 🤣 🎵With arms wide open🎶💀💀💀
The Creed part took me out.
omg the extra character slmao
Absolutely love your work, man. I've started playing your skits on shuffle when I go to sleep, and no nightmares. So, so far so good, right?
"With arms wide open" holy f@ck was that funny
😯Hi- Producer Guy. We met in the self help meeting. I was the guy who saw literal tiny stars circle around my head whenever I sustained head injuries... Not to be confused with that guy who saw real birds flying near his head after recieving head concussions. How are you? Are still seeing those dollar signs? Well, the world hasn't ended by the multiple suns appearing around me during head traumas. So that's good.
This was a very cool colab: The First Guy to (get money-sign eyes) meets Pitch Meeting's very own Producer Guy.    Wow wow wow... wow!
This is exquisite!!
This was great Ryan development 😂👍
Can you guys please do a pitch meeting for the Star Wars the Clone Wars tv show and Star Wars Rebels?
I hit the like button. But I didn’t like this one as much as usual. I hate to say that, but it’s tough love.
👍👍👍👍👍👍
“He’s from all of it!” just about killed me 🤣
The gleeful 'I don't knowwww' is probably my favourite running gag, I just love that delivery.
Pitch Meeting: The Movie.
The dollar signs and merchandisers just had a field day lol
Bostonian
"Hey, shut up!"
I love how the Dark Troopers had basically one move: punch. Like they were hyped up for several episodes and then stood around punching things.
"There's this character Cara Dune who's a badass ex-rebel soldier"  "Who? I don't know any character by that name"
Mr Producer Guy pulled a Mando, Book of Boba style lol precious! 8'3
“But…money.” “But…my money.” 🤯
Do a Pitch Meeting for Peacemaker or Raised by Wolves because sir
We need a producer guy spinoff show!
Pich meeting Pitch meeting better be dropping soon
I feel sorry for the simple minded people that lost there sht over "baby yoda"
wtf 😂😂
"But money?" word of wisdom
Man I really want to see how the producer guy ruins Boba Fett.
love seeing this PITCH MEETING world grow lol ty!
"But my money" bruh that shi had me CRYING dawg
That entire opening segment is just so witty
Expanding the lore with new characters is tight!!
I don’t think I expected to be taken on a journey like this…especially from a YouTube video…but I’ve changed monumentally because of it…all for the best
That’s my Creed ✊
Absolutely brilliant!! Wow wow wow ... wow!!
Really appreciate the extra effort. Really Funny
Ryan could you do one for Spaceballs...... You have to do one for that film... The Blade films would be awesome, so would Riddick. This one was fantastic.... I got the" more characters for more film" concept. (you sly dog, you!) Creating more characters for spin-offs is tight!
These Disney Star Wars shows feel like watching a kid play with Star Wars action figures. I keep waiting for it to cut to Will Ferrell and his son with a bunch of Star Wars toys.
Hi, I'm Producer Guy, and I like money.
I’m glad we got a Ryan George sketch in this. Really refreshing! (Insert pitch meeting quote here)
I really appreciate all the effort you put into these videos, they brighten up my day. You make it look super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Producer Guy has more character development than the entire Obi-Wan Kenobi show.
“He’s gonna love this little silver ball on Mando’s ships” “Babies’ balls are tight”
Arcane would be tight!
amazing video! for your next pitch you should do a top gun maverick pitch meeting 😂
That went off the rails so well.
3:02 the best VH1 reality show
So can we assume all of their last names are "Guy" and their first name is their future profession, meaning that their lifepath is decided at birth? Interesting lore for the Ryan Verse we got this PM.
All of your pitch meetings are great, but this one, this one was at another level. I think it resonated with me because of "Hey shut up and Mando's also going to meet..." and because I once worked with a guy who had that eye-bulge-jaw-drop-upon-seeing-a-female ailment the fella at the group meet had. He once knocked a rather expensive amplifier off a stand, in a shop I managed, with one of his bulging eyes. That was a difficult insurance form to fill in. If you're reading this Alan. Just rub your thighs like the rest of us next time!
Well that was kinda multiversal 😅
Hate to say it but a simple formula is the best formula
This is the best Pitch Meeting yet! I started laughing so hard at the Creed bit that I had to pause the video to recover! 🤣
The therapy session cut was surprasing and funny, but the cut to the support group was fucking hysterical
Seriously props to the Mando team for somehow making sure Baby Yoda and Luke Skywalker were both kept 100% under wraps.  Cant say the same about Ahsoka Tano or Boba Fett though. Or Bo Katan, but since the Darksaber was in the first season it was kind of a no brainer she’d show at some point
Producer: But my money. Screen Writer: Well, Sir. Have you ever heard of the Nintendo stratagem?  Producer: What's that? Screen Writer: That's where you advertise this really cool thing that everyone wants, but then release it in small quantities ensuring a long-term demand for the product. Producer: And you're saying we can do that with Baby Yoda? Screen Writer: Absolutely. In fact, we could probably go all in on the merchandising and even target the most mundane of things like coffee mugs and holiday specific merchandise instead of just toys and t-shirts. Producer: Well, okay then!
Having the producer guy go on a spiritual journey to finally find and accept himself for liking money is TIGHT!
So how's the purchase of Canada coming along? Gotta think baby Yoda helped out tremendously.
Kung Fu Panda Pitch Meeting!
I swear, it's easier for me to see the many Ryans as truly different people then most actors as different people in separate movies (looking at you more famous other Ryan)
I was not prepared for this tangent
loved the bit in three parts, well written and well played. its nice to see some fundamentals *slow clap*
Come to think of it, I think the scan thing might work you know? Considering they lost A LOT of officers just in daily basis maybe keep up with enemy faces is easier then register face of their own officer lol
That 2 minute tangent just to end up saying "using my garbage can as a bathroom is TIGHT!!" was sooooo worth it!! Best Pitch meeting so far, keep up the good work Ryan!!
That was a heck of a tangent.
This one's been a long time coming.
I wish he'd start wearing a Kathleen Kennedy wig for Star Wars pitches.
rofl
Pllllllleeeeeeaaaaassssseeeeeee do a pitch meeting for "cool as Ice" staring Vanilla Ice
The psychiatrist has such a commanding mustache
Producer guy having dollar signs for eyes is tight
Those absolutely random first 3 minutes of the vídeo made this the best and funniest Pitcj Meeting i have ever seen
But... money.
WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN
This one was different lol I love pitch meetings so much
Now that's commitment to a bit! Also the creed reference!
Something tells me producer guy didn't see dollar signs when he heard about a baby Yoda, given they had no merch or toys at release of the show and had to rush items to market a month later when Disney admitted they didn't think it would take off the  way it did. I know you dealt with the lack of merch at the end, but it was the execs who bungled
Best Pitch Meeting episode ever, and that's not something one would say lightly.
Um... is Producer Guy Tamarian?
POWERFUL acting 8:15
the bit from 1:26 to 1:59 is bound to be decontextualized. I can already see the comments saying: "NO! IT'S NOT OK!"
Pitch Meeting Guy saw Producer Guy got the dollar signs. He could’ve vouch for him or join him in Journey of seeking help on what he saw coming out of Producer Guy’s eyes.
Where's my Ghostbusters 1984 pitch meeting??? 😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺😱😱😱😱 I live in Montreal and I have a genuine proton pack replica if you want a prop !! 😁
When he was in group therapy, I was kind of expecting him to compulsively start singing "did did didn't it!"
People bringing up that Mando just does quests are ignoring the fact that he’s a BOUNTY HUNTER. That is literally his job.
Think you can do Adventures In Babysitting pitch meeting?
Me: How is this video almost 9 minutes long? It should just be "Baby Yoda." -> "Cha-ching!". Ryan: Half the video is just "Baby Yoda." -> "Cha-ching!". Me: That works!
Not having merch for baby yoda by Christmas was just stupid
He's a Bostonian, holy sh-t 🤣😂
So good. <3
“HE’S FROM ALL OF IT”  That straight up KILLED ME💀☠️🪦😭😂🤣
Hm. His budget for these short home made videos must have increased quite a bit for him to hire all these extra actors. Can't wait to see if his videos gets successful!
What a silly name.."Guy"...Obviously made up.
The 3 minute dollar sign tangent was annoying AF. Content's gone downhill.
That was epic !
So true 5:32
Would love to see Kung Fu Panda 1-3 at some point! Love these videos!
Creating the short film "Star Wars: Attack of the Cartoon Tropes" was super-easy, barely an inconvenience.
I like how this feels like Pitch Meetings and his Ryan George channel merged even though it's the same dude playing everyone.
A CREED reference? Wow wow wow... wow
That article at the end was published by who?
Hey, I am sure one of those guys in the group bit also works in a company that gives things their names.... I've seen him on that documentary channel on the Youtubes called Ryan Georg.
“That’s my Creed!” 🤜🤜
What about what if
7:42 - 7:47 Which is incredibly sad. They just can't help themselves with throwing in "nostalgia". It's so pathetic that they think they can't make a show that doesn't have any ties to the Skywalker Saga. We need to leave them in the past. Move on. Mando has shown that we can have really good Star Wars stories without anyone relating to the Skywalker Saga. And then they went and ruined it with Ahsoka and Luke. (Even Bo-Katan is a stretch, but she was fine because she wasn't just another jedi showing up.)
Just pure joy
3:26 This always bothered me. I consider this the canonical explanation of why the robot was set to kill and not capture Yoda
This is the multi-verse crossover we needed.
Hey producer Guy, I recommend an Arcane Pitch meeting. This way writer guy wont have to pitch crap for once.
This is the way...
5:17 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA *takes a big breath* AHAHAHAHAHA HAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
standing?! omg they are standing, I always figured they were both sitting...idk what to do with this new information
Ryan George meets Producer guy
Now THAT's character growth! LoL
WITH AHHRMS WIDE OH PUNNNN
He going that far with the cash pun makes it morbiusly funny
I thought the Creed bit was great, but then following it with the "He's a... Bostonian" was fantastic.
“MANDOUGH” I WILL NEVER NOT HEAR IT LIKE THIS!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love it when Ryan introduces these cool little diversions.
6:58 pretty sure that was an allusion to Mando's past working for the Empire
Producer guys arc >>>>>>>>>>>>>
The irony of the joke here is that they intentionally withheld the baby Yoda reveal just to keep the element of surprise, such that they didn't have baby Yoda merch available until the first season had ended.
"He's from all of it!"
digging the new beard style my dude
That Creed reference made my day! Creed is so good!
I like the whole comedy skit at the start
Would love it if you did the Ocean series...like the heist movies (not the actual oceans....)
That character development was simply amazing kkkkk
A pitch meeting for the HBO show "Euphoria" would be nice.
Surprised he didn't mention Grogu getting punched
AWOOOGA!!!
Ryan, you are an international treasure.
*Please do already a pitch meeting for the movie "Idiocracy"!*
I want more doctor and psychiatrist!!!
Empire Strikes Back: Yoda: "For 800 years have I trained Jedi. My own council I will keep on who is ready." Return of the Jedi: Yoda: "When 900 years old you reach, look as good you will not." So Yoda is 900 hundred, and has trained Jedi for 800 years.  Lucasfilm: "I'm sure Yoda was still a baby at age 50. He probably started training Jedi around the time he was potty trained."
Do most horror and children movies, and generally movies that have plots
I'd love to see a Pitch Meeting about that one movie where those people do stuff.
I rarely like a video before it ends. This was genius 🤣🤣🤣
Idk but him acting reminds me of Steve emerson the youtuber.
Bill Burr the Bostonian.
Do a collaboration with Daniel Thrasher! (How do you spell is last name)
wow wow wow....wow
God damn this was a great break from the normal rhythm.
Almost choked on pasta laughing at the Creed bit. 😆👍
Really looking forward to Ryan ripping Obi-Wan apart that series is so dumb
I gave my wife a baby yoda doll for my wedding gift.  Had a groomsman deliver it to the bridal room.  She loved it.
That Bostonian line was so well worked in.  Just beautiful.
Multiverse "first guy" reunion please.
Now I just realized the whole eye dollar therapy was A SIDE QUEST
Best pitch meeting.
That doctor must have experienced the $ in front of the eyes as soon as he handed the bill to producer guy. "Oh I see what you mean now!"
$ $   CHA-CHING!!!
Oh man, remember in season 1 when Mando had character growth, those were the days.
This is how Disney is so stupid: I would have watched a 100 episodes of just about anything to see Luke Skywalker in a bad ass fight. Not drinking ( space cow milk ).
Unpopular opinion: I didn’t like the Mandolorian very much
Remind me never to go to Producer Guy’s therapist who can’t even tell his patient is talking to himself.
I'm glad producer guy is accepting himself for who he is
3:10 moving on with lightning speed to avoid acknowledging the weird remark.
I love how the video completely changes and also his name is producer guy
But if Disney went all BB 8 or Porg on Baby Yoda as a forced merchandise mascot, he probably would have gone the way of... I don't know... BB 8 and Porgs.  EWOKS! That's what I was thinking of... Because we all love Porgs. BB who?
The best one yet?
This morphed into a mash-up between a Pitch Meeting video and a fantastical Ryan George video (probably called "The First Guy To Ever Have Dollar Signs On His Eyes") completely unexpectedly. 😱 And I never knew I would want exactly that. 😁🤘
Lol these keep getting better all the time, hope you guys do a Boba Fett Show one too :D
When he gets enough money to buy Canada, will red maple leafs appear in his eyes?
These are so awesome..   As for movie ideas.. some older movies?  Robocop, The Wizard of Oz..   older movies in todays times would be trippy from a pitch perspective. :)
That entire bit was amazing!
This is the best 😂
I came into this knowing that there'd be a bit on the baby yoda merchandising. And oh boy, was that fulfilling.
disney didnt make any baby yoda merch at the beginning
The Disney+ algorithm 'joke' hit way too close for comfort.  :-/
Can we cash in on this whole Producer Guy story? Will there be spin offs?
lol
'it's OK to put your faith in artificial intelligence' - 'Our Disney+ algorithm has been suggesting we push that kind of message...kind of aggressively now I think about it' 🤣
I am crying laughing. This episode went a completely different direction.
“That’s my Creed” lmfao
Do Dune already.
Producer guy is slowly turning into a rubber animation
"Eye love money."
YES
Please do the Blade trilogy!
That little story about the dollar signs could be made into a movie
The funny thing is that they originally had like the worst merch for baby Yoda.
"Bostonian"  shit I laughed hard
Me: Producer Guy is the producer guy’s name?  Producer Guy: I’m gonna need you to get alllllll the way off my back on that one!  Me:  Well let me just get off that thing!
suggestion for a pitch meeting:  Predestination  good luck explaining this movie
I love when they do skits in these  The Pitch Meetings saga grows stronger.
Can we get a pitch for the west wing season 11 - where a narcissistic billionaire runs for president against Rizzo from grease?
Pitch Meeting actually caring about its characters and continuity is tight!
Can we get this mf'er a show and Netflix special already?
This 2 for 1 special was awesome
Bostonians sure are a special type of creature!   Also, do Top Gun & Top Gun: Maverick!
I’m usually a fan of these pitch meeting but there a lot more you could of done with this. You could of mentioned the fact that mando says mandalorians never take off there helmet and showed a bunch of clips of the clone wars where they always do. Also how mando says mandalorians aren’t a race but I mean they are there’s a whole planet called mandalore. You could of also showed how his enemies always hit his beskar armor because of his insane plot armor. I mean moth Gideon could of killed him in season 2 with the dark saber but instead of hitting him behind his legs or really any other spot that’s unprotected he hits him in the most covered spot. I would of also liked if you mentioned how stupid operation cinder is. I mean destroying your most loyal and profitable planets to make you look scary?? That’s some really bad writing. All in all great video though!!
BILL BURR FOR THE WIN
You forgot to mention the guy who smelled delicious pie and flew to it
They wanted to pitch a Boba Fett show. But Disney said Boba is dead, come up with a new character. So they made Mando instead. Then it got so popular, Disney had to bring Boba back from the Sarlacc Pit.
7:22 - Wow, that's a pretty sturdy helmet. I feel like Oberyn Martell could have used one of those.
Did Rian Johnson direct this episode?
Well, that took a turn
Lmao "hey shuttup"
What kind of alien is he?  A Bostonia.  I love science fiction! funniest line I've heard in years 🏆🏆🏆
This was top drawer entertainment
Guess I’m the only one who didn’t like the side quest… oops
"With ahrms wide ohpien"
I really enjoyed it and the dollar sign eyes just made me laugh.
"But... but my money."
re-including the fact that he was gone for days to rib at the writing of this show in episode 1 was amazing.
Finally
Love the character growth lol
The show came out in 2019 and in 2022 the pitch meeting for mando season 1/2 is. Made
This is peak Ryan. Where do we go from here? I am scared
That moment you realize the journey was actually just a set up for the dead or alive thing
That Creed joke came out of nowhere, and it made my day!
That stache!
As long as Moth Gideon says, “Yo, Sal…how come there are no brothers up on the wall!”  I’m fine with this show.
"Go on. Get outta here" *AD IMMEDIATELY STARTS
I take no responsibility for the development of this show’s villain. Although, I would appreciate some royalties.
The new "hey, shut up" shtik is hilarious..
Money 💸💸💸💸💸💸
When the Pitch Meeting is better than the entire mandolorian series
Huh, I'm surprised that Producer Guy was so cool with Writer Guy using his waste basket as a toilet for three days.  I mean, it might be tight, but the smell wouldn't be.  It would be the opposite of tight.  Which I guess is loose, but saying something is loose doesn't sound very tight.
“Hey shut up….” 6:23. So funny
That's my Creed!  Killed me!!
8:23 - I mean, all the money they didn't make in the moment - they sure as *fuck* made back in the long term xD
Side quests to reach a catharsis are tight!
Best episode, hands down
Taking the dollar sign joke so far is amazing...The Disney+ warning about AI is so freakin funny.
The sketch ruined it.
With arms wide open... that's my creed.... best line you have ever had :)
HE IS FROM ALL OF THEM!! That killed me! :)))))))))))))))))
You should do a pitch meeting on amazons the boys
Pitch meeting guy... 5:38 seems different
0:29-3:15 is that the longest tangent in the history of Pitch Meetings or what?
Oh medical dramas during Pitch Meetings are tight!
I thought Producer Guy was gonna come back, convinced he imagined everything, asked: - _Where were we?_  - _Well, as I said: Baby Yoda..._  - _CHA-CHING_                                                                           *END*
Oh making long-overdue Pitch Meetings is TIGHT!
Producer Guy's personal growth story was at least as good as The Hobbit.  Maybe he could make a movie trilogy out of it.
This broke Pitch Meetings lore. Producer guy would've had money eyes in every movie pitch meeting because to him, movie is just a money maker.
1:52 So what are the chances the pretty woman was another Ryan?
You guys I'm seriously concerned about Disney pushing the whole droids are like people agenda thing.  I think Disney is plotting to be Skynet...
Guess they really wanted to cross the eight minute mark. It was quite well executed though, the only horrendous mistake is calling Grogu "baby Yoda"
So all these new awkwardly shoehorned in characters are getting their own shows?
Jaajjq producer guys Journey of acceptance was sooo funny
“He’s from all of it.” 🤣🤣🤣
guy with the cap, my favorite RGCU character.
Ryan! You should do a pitch meeting for Everything. Everywhere. All at Once.
All praise Producer Guy for finding himself.
Wow! Very impressive narrative on this one. Character development is TIGHT!
The Bostonians are pretty angry folk.
Halo
This might be the best Pitch Meeting yet! I actually laughed out loud at Creed.
The algorithm joke was my favorite! The delivery was perfect!
Finally
"He has these crazy droids called Dark Troopers"  "That's from another thing back in the 90s but it was a little different!"
....Wow.
Boy, that took a turn! XD
Oh Actually a “book of boba fett” pitch meeting would be TIGHT!
@Pitch Meeting Ryan, what the hell is wrong with you? On multiple occasions you used that racist comment. His name is Grogu, not Yoda! If you are just describing the first season you could at best call him "The Child". How would you like it if everyone just called you Bob cause you look like all the other white narwhals with the name Bob?
The start of this episode was the greatest :)
This was a Pitch Meeting Channel meets Ryan George Channel Crossover! Wow Wow Wow WOW!
The whole "Cartoon effects happening in real life" support group had me in stitches. Those poor guys just need everyone to get allll the way off their backs.
Watching this was super easy, barely an inconvenience. Seriously I stopped watching after season 1 lol
so true.
The Ryan Cinematic Universe is expanding, and I'm completely here for it.
Fabulous!!!
Way more entertaining than the actual mandalorian show.
holy shit the mustache made a cameo
And with how kenobi 4 went they are going to start hemorrhaging money
With arms wide open 👊🏻 That’s my creed. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I ran out to try and buy some baby Yoda merch right after the episode aired and... did not find any. It was still worth the surprise though. I have not found him any less cute and still buy stuff today.
Producer Guy got his character arc 😂😂😂 The plot twist 👌💯🤣
How about tropic thunder?
Haa! "a BABY Yoda?..🤑" "woh what was that?" 😄👍
After they they said Baby Yoda, this became 1 of my favorite Pitch Meetings ever 🤣🤣🤣  Id love to see a Pitch Meeting about " Free Guy"
Did he just not so subtly hint that Disney is helping the inevitable robot takeover of the world?
Immortel.
*sees new pitch meeting* : clicks  *sees Mandalorian pitch meeting* : CLICKS HARDERRR
5:17 "...Now Every-thing...Has changed. I'll show you love...I'll show you e-vry-thing!”  You better not be lying because THAT REALLY IS MY CREED!!!
Not one of the best Pitch Meetings..
Hey @RyanGeorge,  I’m so excited for this pitch meeting! I suggested it a couple videos ago, that’s super cool you did it. Love your work bro, keep it up. Have a new suggestion: A pitch for either the Chip n’ Dale Movie or the series
The biggest irony of all is that Lucasfilm clearly did not anticipate the merchandising bonanza that is Baby Yoda (given the relative dearth of ready merchandise when the fewer first hit...though don't worry, they caught up quickly). In a world in which companies all the time are trying to craft the next such success, Lucasfilm actually stumbled into this one and seemingly had not been going for the cash grab here.
It's really great they chose someone to play the Mandalorian that has a face that looks just like a cow.
but money XD
New channel pitch meetings hitting different
I was doing some training at work, and the opportunity arose for me to use the "barely an inconvenience" line. So I took it, and my boss got the reference, which made it even better.
You should do Top Gun in preparation for Mavericks release.
Shawshank redemption or godfather please
Thanks for the bonus PSA about dollars-for-eyes-itis.
I loved the side quest for Producer Guy! Especially about a show of side quests, lol
Lost it at „he’s from all of it!🫵“ 🤣🤣
So... does this beautiful woman also look like Ryan or does she look like that one woman he(Ryan) divorced?
I like the way you money!
Holy hell I love the new things you come up with...and that you keep the classics...so close to the perfect video I want 50 of every day but that's impossible.
Alright this one might be my favorite, LOVE seeing some Producer Guy lore
Well this went off on a pretty satisfying tangent
with arms wide open...that's my creed lol I had totally forgotten about that 90s Christian rock band until now damn I'm old lol
This is amazing
But.. money... but my money...
Ah, did you create that little sketch about producer guy's self discovery to pad the runtime?
OMG! This is the FUNNIEST PITCH MEETING VIDEO EVER! 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Besides, I think that manifesting dollar signs in your eyes whenever anybody mentions that you can make TONS of money is a requirement of all of Disney's Producer Guys and higher ups. Some of them even have coins that comes out of their ears when it happens! 🤑💰
I love you but that backstory went on for MUUUCH too long. I figure that’s part of the joke, but I would have preferred if that was a separate video since I wanted a Mando critique, not backstory.   You are the creator though, you do the content you want and feel good about! Just unsolicited criticism from a random viewer. You keep doing you, I really do love you.
Will we have the old pitch meetings in this channel
This was amazing lmao. Loved the little side quest for Producer Guy that gave him more character development that Din Djarin in some of his episodes
I’m surprised you didn’t talk about Mando killing about 50 people that were protecting baby Yoda in order for him to now protect baby Yoda. I’ve never let that go.
Producer Guy: So, how does the Season 2 finale end? Screenwriter Guy: Well sir, Mando takes down the Moff and takes his Darksaber, which is a weapon stolen from Mandalorians. But the Mando lady from Clone Wars really wants that weapon and challenges him to a duel to the death. Producer Guy: Oh my G-d! Why? Screenwriter Guy: Because apparently, you can only wield the Darksaber after killing its previous owner, someone else decided. Producer Guy: Damn, arbitrary rules regarding weapon ownership is tight! It has to be hard for Mando to get out of that pickle. Screenwriter Guy: Actually, it's super easy, barely an inconvenience. Producer Guy: Oh really? Screenwriter Guy: Yeah, there are many interruptions: Death robots trying to reach them, Luke taking them down, and then Baby Yoda being taken to be trained by the Jedi. And then the series ends with both of them standing awkwardly. Producer Guy: What? Screenwriter Guy: Don't worry, sir. Mando's going to obviously make out of it since we have him to appear on the Boba Fett show. Producer Guy: Boba's going to have his own show? But wasn't Mandalorian meant to be- Screenwriter Guy: Look, merchandise opportunities! Producer Guy: Nevermind then. I like money.
I love that this is pretty much a giant setup for "I like money"
I wonder if it was an intentional choice to go off formula in a Pitch Meeting episode about a show that used the same formula for every episode
Curve balls are tight
You win YouTube 🏁
Hey shut up
Great side quest for producer guy. Lots of character development. The ending brought it all full circle and connected the side quest to the main plot.
Merging pitch meeting with the first guy to like money was tight!!!
Skipping over long family guy style cuttaways is tight.
But it’s not yoda at all idiots
With arms wide open! Made me choke on my coffee 😂
Man dough...
Pitch Meetings having their own channel is tight!  - also super easy and barely an inconvenience.
Came for the Pitch Meeting. Came for the unexpected Character Arc
Glad movie producer guy got some introspection and waited for the show to air before releasing the baby yoda merch
Do The Island of Doctor Moreau!!
Okay, now that you are dipping the toes into streaming, you NEED to do Netflix's Arcane.
For some reason I cant find Stranger Things pitch meeting, what am I doing wrong?
My eyeballs get as large as dinner plates when I see a new Pitch Meeting video is online. Do I have a problem?
Wowowow, wow
6:33 was expecting an *I like the way you moneeey*
this is my idea for a Finding Nemo Pitch meeting. sg=screenwriter pg=Producer  pg: "so I was told you had a movie for me"  sg: "yes sir I do, it's a fun kids movie about talking fish"  pg: "that's nice"  sg: "so we're gonna start the movie by killing of the one of the parents"  pg: "that's disney tradition at this point"  sg: "and so the father Marlin is going to be all overprotective towards his son Nemo like he desperately doesn't want him to go to school"   pg: "sounds kinda weird"  sg: "but eventually on Nemos first day of school some other kids are going to peer pressure him into leaving the class and playing near a cliff, I mean dropoff"  pg: "wow so Marlin actually had a point about not going to school"   sg: "so then Nemo's going swim out into open water and get kidnapped by divers and taken into a scary white boat"  pg: "definetly shouldn't have gone to school that day, school sucks"   sg: "ok so Marlin loses the boats trail and has to get help from this other fish Dory, who saw which way it went"  pg: "so they're just going to go the direction the boat went, don't really feel like he needs Dory for that"  sg: "but then Dory's going to act all weird and start avoiding Marlin and we're going to find out she has short term memory loss"  pg: "but you just said she knew which direction the boat went, how did she remember that"   sg: "pfft you're asking the wrong guy"   pg: "Ughh"  sg: "so then they just go through a bunch of ocean based nightmares like vegetarian sharks and an anglerfish"  pg: "what's an anglerfish"  sg: "it's a deep sea fish with a light dangling off its forehead, I'm pretty sure everyone's going to know what an anglerfish is after this movie"  pg: "you know I've got to admit, I like the narrative here, like we follow Malins perspective and the whole time we're like 'Is Nemo ok'"  sg: "oh no we are going to jump to Nemos perspective from time to time"  pg: "oh forget what I said"  sg: "yeah we're going have Nemo team up with some traumatized dentist aquarium fish to try and escape"   pg: "ok"  sg: "and we find out that the dentist plans to give Nemo as a birthday present to his neice Darla who is just horrible"  pg: "oh no"   sg: "meanwhile Marlin and Dory are going to get the dentists address in sydney off a scuba mask and Dory remembers it for them"  pg: "how does she remember that"  sg: "Ugh... the power of character growth"  pg: "that make sense"  sg: "Really, ok so eventually Marlin and Dory hitch a ride with some sea turtles and end up in a really foggy part of the ocean and They see a Whale"  pg: "wow wow wow... wow"   sg: "so Dory tries to speak to the whale so it will help but it goes in the other direction and makes it way behind them"  pg: "the whale goes the other way instead of going right at them"  sg: "ugh"  pg: "and silently swims all the way around their line of sight to come at their backs"  sg: "umm"   pg: "and neither of them hear a whale swimming behind them"  sg: "buddy I'm trying to make a cool shot here why are you trying to ruin that"  pg: "oh I see my bad"  sg: "so then the whale carries them all the way to Sydney and they meet a pelican named Nigel who takes them to Nemo"  pg: "wow wow wow"  sg: "but after a struggle with the dentist they think Nemos dead, however Nemos tank friends manage to get him flushed down the toilet"  pg: "oh no that's tereible"  sg: "no that's good because all drains lead to the ocean"  pg: "I... I don't think that's true"  sg: "no its true my cousins a plumber and he told me, of course he's also living under a bridge and has a serious drug problem but he's still my best source"   pg: "alright then"   sg: "but then Nemo gets back into the ocean and reunites with Marlin"  pg: "Ahhhhhh"  sg: "but then they're going to have to save Dory and stop a fishing trauler because this movie needs a final battle"  pg: "mmhhm couldn't agree more"  sg: "and that's it so what do you think"  pg: "I think it sound great, I think we made a classic, and hey my freinds at Disney are looking for a director for a big live action movies with aliens and hot people, would you be interested"  sg: "definetly"  pg: "great the movie is called John Carter, you think you can make it a hit"  sg: "oh yeah it will be super easy, barely an inconvenience"  Screenrant:John Carter losses Disney over $200 million
HOW DID I NEVER THINK TO ASK FOR THIS
Wearing a fake moustache over a real one is ti...nah, it's just silly.
This is great 🤣
I expect that was very nearly the actual reaction to the big wigs over at Disney finding out about the baby yoda character. 😂😂
I’m now convinced that Ryan is also Roger from American Dad
Ryan Ryan Ryan... Pure Genius my good man!
Can't remember the last time I laughed so hard 🤣🤣🤣. I loved how he played off the dollar signs as physical thing that actually happened.
We need to hear Producer Guy cover more Creed songs each week - what an impression!
Now I want to know more about People-Whose-Face-Makes-Cartoon-Character-Expressions Anonymous (PWFMCCEA, for short).
That was quite an adventure - Producer guy went on a side quest of his own. I loved it :) you gotta do more stuff like that :) this was one of the funniest best episodes yet! Thank you Ryan, your pitch meetings always make my day better
I started this video and was like "8 mins long? Something's up" and I have never been more pleased with the something that was up
“So these Dark Troopers are freaking terrifying, Mando struggles against just one!” “Oh wow, do they kill off a side character like an unimportant Mando to show off how dangerous they are?” “Nope, they take longer to boot up then a Windows computer from the 80’s and by the time they do attack every other bad guy is dead.” “Oh…” “Yeah, Mando could have probably taken the whole ship by himself if I’m being honest, we aren’t giving the Empire any credibility as antagonists.”
It’s Morbin time!
But money
Best character arc ever.
Bravo
Great Pitch Meeting, is it possible to do a Pitch Meeting for *Mandy* or maybe *Dead End* because that would be tight!
I’m so much early then I ever had lol
Not gonna lie producer guy going on a journey of discovery and seeking help for his problems and going to therapy to find peace with his personality was a very heart warming and character growth moment.
Pitchmeetingverse confirmed
I believe the face scan was to record who accessed which data. Which i hope his face being in imperial records will come back to bite him
finallyyyy
Can we get Obi Wan trashed alreayd? That show is horrible.  But please do a pitch meeting for every single Obi Wan episode, there is much lazy, uncreative writing that each episode deserves attention, and you get to have more views on the channel.
Would love to see the pitch meetings for the TREMORS series
Money is tight
"with arms wide open" 🤣🤣 this dude never stops amazing me with how funny his writing is
Ozark
Still waiting for the Boba Fett pitch meeting!
The most epic show needed the most epic pitch meeting !
That arc with the producer guy had me rolling xD
Awesome content as always.   Also I need some help finding that video because it’s killing me as I can’t find it. I can’t remember was it a pitch meeting or just a Ryan George video that said something like   “I’m more of a 3 person. I’m a 7. Don’t talk to me about 7”
Ryan!!! This was wildly meta and quite self-help in the best way possible.
I couldn't believe it when they didn't have any Baby Yoda merchandise during that first Christmas right after the show came out.  Like, I was beyond shocked.
I looove how the different characters play off of each other here lol. This was a great pitch meeting
For the record, I liked "The Mandalorian" but!! The McGuffin side quests and Mando being sidelined as a secondary character in his OWN SHOW grew wearisome. Should the show continue, please, for the love of God get better writers!
In Quebec, his name would be Producer Guy, but 'Guy' would be pronounced like 'LaFleur' rather than 'Fieri'
It's funny because I was having this conversation with co-workers today how Baby Yoda basically saved Star Wars with merchandise today, just a few hours ago.  We all owned some Baby Yoda thing.  I think I have 5 shirts or hoodies with him, and a night light.  I'd have more but the wife says no.
You are the reason YouTube needs a love button. The like button just isn't cutting it anymore
“So the good guys basically massacre the stormtroopers no problem, like even without the indestructible armour Mando would probably kill all of them.” “I guess that’s exciting?” “Right! But then the droid has to sacrifice itself in the final episode!” “Why?” “Because there’s a bunch of stormtroopers at the end of a tunnel that the good guys are drifting towards.” “I thought the good guys have been massacring stormtroopers no problem, suddenly now they’re a threat?”
I'm ok with how my body reacts to women because pretty women are tight!! ..but what is a women??
It's a show about a bounty hunter that doesn't hunt for bounties after 1st episode
waiting for a growgoo mention
"What?....but....money...!"   OMG, humanity encapsulated by 3 words...lol...
Not a mention of Gina…….. weird
I've said it once and I'll say it again, do a pitch meeting for Kung Fury
The “hey shut up” line gets me every time!
I was wondering why this video was longer than usual haha
Please do Top Gun: Maverick and Ready Player One.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
just stick to the pitch. love the show otherwise!
I am still waiting for Brad Pitt’s Fight Club…. It wouldn’t be hard… it would be super easy… Barely and Inconvenience.
Producer guy had more character development in 3 minutes than Rae did in three movies.  Character development is tight!
The group-therapist's cringe geekazoid scally cap is tight!
The mask reference...ha!
I can't explain how hilarious this one was 🤣
Great internal lore, but comedically inaccurate to the actual situation around the Mandalorian. Dave Filoni's little side project wasn't meant to be the only thing in the entire SW money printer still actually printing money; they unironically thought a by the numbers dark space western would crash and burn unlike Kathleen Kennedys amazing Sequel era projects. Pitch guy should have had to fight tooth and nail to get it made at all only for the greek tragedy to befall producerguy that he didn't have merchandize to capitalize on it.
"That's my Creed" 🤣🤣
Is that support group limited to ocular/facial occurrences? Because I sometimes run into walls and become thin like a piece of cardboard for a few seconds.
Please do the Book of Boba fett next
The people at Lucasfilms merchandising when they are sent the Baby Yoda concept art: "A cute little Yoda!!! How did we not think of this earlier?!!"
please do the crow
My song "Even The Hardest Heart" with Baby Yoda and The Mandalorian The first SW project from a fan from 1977. https://youtu.be/OrUZoAwAHGA
The stories in the Pitch Meeting universe are as good as the Pitch Meetings. I was really invested in Producer Guy's journey of self discovery.
With arms wide open!
I would like to see a princess bride pitch meeting.
The universe is expanding
YESSSS FINALY
i love this therapy session hahahahha
LOL  "thats my creed"... respect.  🙂
Oooo way too long on the dollar sign gag
Omg I love this
turi ip ik ip ip ik irrk turi ip ik ip ip irrk
The American Dad joke where they develop $$ eyes...  🤣
Talking with your thumb is tight!
Boba Fett? Boba Fett? WHERE?!
This skit is branching out. Spin-offs are coming.
You gotta do the Halo series! It’s so bad
Is this PitchMeeting verse meets Ryan verse, are they the same, so many questions
RyanVerse is such developed
Good god the creed reference
The Mandalorian Pitch Meeting- "This is the way!"
Lmfaoooooooooo the cut 2 is so funny 🤣
The Ryan George universe lore is expanding
Brilliant hehe. I’d love to see a Pitch Meeting with Ratatouille
What...What is Happening?
Literally finished the show today, what a blessing.
Now.. this is the way... to do a pitch meeting.
One of your best
I hope we get to see Screenwriter Guy go on a journey in a future episode.
Thank God for the lsd coursing through my body
HeyshutupandsoMando is...
The incredible lore in this pitch meeting
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
Please can we get a Boba Fett pitch meeting next where we talk about how the best parts were essentially Mandolorian season 2.5?
I love that Bill Burr's character is a Bostonian
Could you do a pitch for the mask of zorro?
.....has this not already been done?  HOW HAS THIS NOT ALREADY BEEN DONE BEFORE NOW?
Hands down, the best pitch meeting that has been done in a while. And I watch every one of these. By far my absolute favorite one. This literally made my day lmfaooo
Great haircut!
That Creed reference was funnier than the side quest 🤣
Love the dedication to the joke
Great intro 😂
No mention of Gena Corano I noticed.
I loved this pm,wow,wow,wow,wow.....wow
Producer Guy's journey of growth for his mutant eyeball powers was a better story than all the XMEN movies put together
One of the best Pitch meetings ever! also I am recommending: Brazil, The last boy scout, Hudson Hawk and El laberinto del fauno. Cheers from Mexico.
" thats my creed"  im fukn weak 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This episode really expanded on the lore of this universe. All people in it are some iteration of Ryan except of course for the Theory Guys. Very interesting.
I forgot it’s Thursday, but reminding me was Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience… there I said it
Please pitch: The unbearable weight of massive talent
Maybe you’ll find the mandolorian and baby yoda in add space one day
The unexpected Creed tho lmfao
Now I'm excited for the Mandalorian season 2.5 pitch meeting  Also I'm kinda disappointed that they didn't say sexy doctor as Mayfeld's species
We got doctor guy, therapist guy, group therapy guys in addition to producer guy and screenwriter guy, the budget for guys really went up when pitch meeting got it’s own channel
*The Darkside is TIGHT!*
Love Pitch Meetings, don’t prefer skits in the middle of pitch meetings though
HES FROM ALL OF IT. I’m done yo 😂 🤣🤣🤣
“Hey Shut Up” 😂😂😂
pitch meeting has expanding outside pitch meeting office, and it's seems to confirm that it's actually inside ryan george universe..
Oh my god 5:18 I never laughed so hard.
Good…. Good…
One of the funniest pitch meeting ever!!!🤣🤣🤣
I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend!
I am glad this roasted this show.  I don't get how so many think this is good.
PLEASE do a Halo TV Series pitch meeting
But money!
Making a longer episode with some incredible character development is tight.
This is awesome we finally got lore
Producer guy already got better character development than alotta new characters *cough * Captain Marvel * cough*
👍👍👍😔
Love handles = Man Dough. I’m embarrassed at how long it took for me to get that joke.
Discovering Mr. Producer Guy’s character Arc is TIGHT!
Comment!
Holy shit that’s such a genius concept. You could make a whole series out of it
Holy crap this is amazing!
in rare form....love the expanded lore for Mr. Guy.
But...but my moneys!
Ha I never watched the show I actually thought baby yoda is yoda when he was ababy
Producer Guy has an arc - which is tight.
These pitch meetings are better written than anything Disney Star Wars 😂
WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN!!!
I’m so happy that Ryan has been able to free this series from Screen Crush. He was always so much better than that channel
EVERYBODY LOVES BABY YODA!
The eyes you put on Grogu are appropriate. Makes him next level cute. 😆 🤣
I love how this started like any other Pitch Meeting, but quickly morphed into an original Ryan George sketch.
2:40 And, you know, maybe liking money is tight.
Seems like most people liked the money-sign-eyes side quest but for me it detracted from the rest of the video, the main point of the skit. I get one of the main criticisms of the show was all the side quests, but this side quest didn't connect for me, a bit too heavy handed. I immediately agreed with the writer, we already knew that about the producer so that whole bit didn't really add anything and lost most of its comedic value for me. I love your content and am always eager for the next video, just wanted to leave my own feedback. The rest of the skit was gold as usual!
The Creed joke ahahahahahaha
Damn dude.  Super duper on a looper well done man!
“He’s from all the things”
8:23 I'm pretty sure by now they've made up for the lack of merchandise immediately available in December 2019
"What kind of creature is he?" "He's a Bostonian"  "oh I love science fiction"
I can see three pieces of Baby Yoda merch from the place I sat to watch this video. Disney didn't lose any money.
I'd like to see a Pitch Meeting for The Devil's Advocate please
That... Was... EPIC! It had character building, universe expansion, drama, comedy and all of the normal quotes and quips.
This one was LONG overdue!
can't wait for top gun maverick and jurassic park dominion pitch meetings!
"Hey shut up" is quickly becoming a classic catchphrase.
I did NOT need the callback to a certain 90s quasi-Christian-yet-oddly-mainstream band, a band that has made three CDs _and_ a Best Of compilation that are in my music collection I just realized because _reasons_
The Producer Guy side quests were so great! A bit wholesome too! Great sketch!
Ryan... stop... making me.... love you...
All ima say is I LOVE GROKU !!!! AKA baby Yoda lol
"But... But money?" 🤣🤣🤣
That was great
He's from all of it lol 😆. I completely lost it!
This was a great video! So tight!
Pitch meeting and Ryan George collab!!!
I like how Producer Guy ended up in a "My Eyes Pop Out of My Head" Anonymous meeting by the end of his character "development." 👀🤣
Well that was art
can you pitch the boys please?
For some reason, I was humming a creed song as I started watching this video.  What are you not telling us "Ryan"
He needs a spin off sketch on his own channel about cartoon medical condition focus group
With Arms Wide Ohpennah!
You really wrote a entire character arc for the producer Just so you could explain why the Mandolorian didn’t have any baby yoda merchandise for about 3 weeks
Producer guy could almost be screenwriter guys brother.
I’d love to see the book of boba fett and obi wan kenobi pitch meetings
I’ve ever wondered if Ryan edits Pitch Meetings or SR does
I don't know man, the "super easy, barely an inconvenience" this time might have been a bit of a cheat. Hadn't those droids pretty much curb-stomped Djin and friends before Luke showed up?
Gotta love producer homie
No Gina Carano??? 😢
I'm 1:15 in and dear lord this took a turn I never saw coming lol
The “with arms wide open” part had me rolling 🤣🤣🤣
Well that took a turn lol
I would love a Pitch Meeting about MEN. When all the male characters have the same face, does it sounds familiar?
Wtf just happened 😂 🤣🤣🤣
I think Ryan is starting to get tired of doing the same thing over and over again and now he is giving himself some opportunities to expand his acting. Eventually he will get completely fed up with this show, like Ray William Johnson got fed up with equals 3
Ryan: this is going to be a decomentary I decided!
worst one I've ever seen....    went too far off formula
"With arms wide open". That's my creed too, producer guy
This was great😅👍
Creed references are tight tight tight
Working a reference to Creed into a Pitch Meeting is tight!
Been waiting for this.
*This show* felt like it was going in a story driven direction one second - *THEN BOOM* - Luke Skywalker cameo out of nowhere.. whole season feels like it’s been thrown off.
I'm a little upset that during the group therapy session, no one said "It did, didn't it?" Would've been the greatest call back ever.
"Mr. Producer Guy", love the sound of that
What kinda creature is he?  He's aaa..........Bostonian.
Cha-ching! Ah-oooga!
PITCH VERSE.
Who knew that Star Wars shoes would peak with Mando?!!!
the "Bostonian" @6:44  bahahaha
I loved the "The Mask" reference
...and then we gonna fire popular strong female character
This is new favorite Pitch Meeting!
With arms wide open 🤣🤣🤣
I love the fact of how he teases the Mandalorian show for constantly going on pointless side quests by having  the producer guy go on a pointless side quest of self discovery leading us to something we already knew about him, his love of money. Very Clever🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can you do V for Vendetta ( 2005)? Surely you can deliver a killer joke about V's V monologue
Please do the Underworld movies, The resident evil movies, and anything Pre MCU.   Like there was the Matrix knock off era, the Hunger games knock off era, the Harry Potter knock off era, the Jurassic Park knock off era, the early Star Wars knock off era, and so much more
Dear heavens. What if the Ryanverse is really just all in Ryan's head as a coping mechanism for the state of movies, and he's somehow found a way to see inside his own head and record the conversations he has with his imaginary clones.
Ooooh! Going on a character development tangent is TIGHT!
A sketch within a sketch, amazing! Also, I love how the bathroom stall designer guy is in charge of the support group. 😂
The Creed reference, my gawd!  You animal.  You got my humorless wife to laugh, I love it!
Why is Disney labelled on the door? Lucasfilm made the show, Disney just marketed it.
Please don't tell Screen Writer Guy about Infinite Eight. We might have a problem then.
Ryan I don't know if you're gonna see this comment but you deserve to have a movie. You're so funny you should have your own movie.  I'm surprised that that no director has pitched you a movie....🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 Then you'll have to do a pitch meeting about your movie!!!!!
06:23 I like that Pitch Guy has started saying "Hey, shut up!" very fast before immediately continuing his pitch, it's like a version of him telling Producer Guy to get off his back (I've decided).
I also like money and am ok with it.
you forgot Mando season 2.5, now everyone is gonna be confused
Please do a pitch meeting for Stargate
You know I was saying myself the Book of Boba Fett would make a great Pitch Meeting but then I remembered you didn't do one for The Mandalorian and I thought you didn't because there wasn't enough to make one (or any other reason really) but know that you've made one, I'm excited for the Boba Fett one (and will watch this one now).
This is my new all time favorite pitch meeting.   Did we just take our first step into to wider Ryanverse?  I need to know all of their back stories now
Excellent! Great to see you are trying out new things.
Wait, so seeing a young Luke means this takes place before The Force Awakens?
I got serious Fight Club vibes
Is this the jump the shark moment for Pitch Meetings?  I don’t see how it can get any better than this.    Who am I kidding, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
For a minute, I forgot this was a Pitch Meeting. It feels like a video Ryan would typically make on his own personal channel
Unironically, the producer guy had more character development in his side plot in this video than Mando did over the course of 2 seasons
The Creed joke totally got me 🤣🤣🤣
That was amazing. Be proud
Love this. Genius. Watch when stoned
"He's a...Bostonian." "I love science-fiction!" Had me rolling.
This skit sucked imo Normalf funny as fuck though
The fact they did not have tons of baby yoda';s ready to go shows how sad and pathetic they are.
consume product, and get excited about next product.
that support group bit was the most ridiculously absurd wholesome moment I have ever seen in my life.
AI shall rule the day!
This was the most Ryan George-y pitch meeting ever and I loved it. I would love to see more of that kinda stuff
Ryan looks like he's having so much fun doing these, and it's so much fun to watch
I was just askingin your last pitch meeting why you haven't done any star wars disney + stuff. Thank you!
This is the best Ryan has ever been. Keep innovating brother 😍
I'm certain Kathleen Kennedy had no such crisis of conflict about how much money Grogu was going to make for her, good to see Producer Guy has more of a soul
The creed joke ended me, watched that 10 second clip about 20 times already. The chest thump really sells it
Wow this has gone meta…… I love it
Better than the Kenobi show 😏
What makes this funny is just how UNPREPARED Disney was for the popularity of Grogu (aka "Baby Yoda"). There was a lack of merchandise for a while.
Maybe you should do video game pitch meetings
Angela Laaaansbury!!
Admire producer guy  for resisting his uncontrollable greed over a lucrative merchandising opportunity. Good job 👍
I want a 5-season, 10 episode each, show about Producer Guy dealing with and trying to manifest this newfound ability. I love it all. So much.
Oh, switching up the pitch meeting format is tight!!
The meta has evolved.
Vanille Sky please
I am still laughing with the "Arms wide open" bit! He even got the "raspiness" of Creed! Well done Ryan! This whole pitch meeting was amazing!
I'm sorry but these thumbnails just creep me out
Please do the Umbrella Academy!
This is the best fucking intro ever.
Producer Guy really likes money.  And maybe that's okay.
Producer Guy living amongst the abandoned clones from The Clone Wars is tight.
now i had to go listen to creed after that reference
😅😅🤣🤣🤣
I hope baby yoda goes to the beach in the show. I bet he'd be cute in a little swimsuit.
Would have been better if there was a mention about Gena Carano and how Disney screwed her over while on a mission to promote strong female characters.
"I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend" -Disney probably
Best pitch meeting yet! Hurt myself laughing so hard.
Are we getting a pitch meeting cinematic universe?
Are you tying this series into your main channel universe Ryan?
Stick to naratig movies,  that intro isn't funny at all
Didnt really need 2.5 minutes of cringe skits
the funny point about merchandising, Disney had no faith in start wars and baby yoda at this point and no merch existed for 3 months after the show released.
Really happy to see you breaking from the formula this episode was hilarious 😂
this is the largest cast of actors in a Pitch Meeting yet
Missed an opportunity.... using garbage can as bathroom shouldve used bed  or couch or couch-bed
i cried when he said "he's from all of it"
I’m 100% on board with the new catch phrase, maybe two or three episodes now, of “hey shut up” followed by an immediate continuing of exposition is as funny as my original favorite catch phrase of “whoops, whoopsie!”
please do grandma's boy for a pitch meeting. I would love to see an interaction between them about when people smoke a bunch of weed and get a monkey stoned
"He's from all of it!!". That reaction killed me😂
Dude.. are you definitely fucking outdid yourself, and that's saying a lot
Definitely one of the best pitch meetings
LOVE the thumbnail :)) All Hale The Hypno Frog!
DOLLAR SIGNS
Very fitting for this pitch meeting to have its own sidequest.
At least where weren't many plot holes or "barley an inconvenience" moments (there was only one of those) in the Mandalorian series so far lol. Pretty impressive.
Skip to 3:00 for pitch meeting
How did you get over it was very easy barely an inconvenients
This us your best one so far
Do the new Top gun movie next
"Mr Producer Guy..."  This name still kills me😂
Should have had the doctor have dollar signs in his eyes.
Before release "We want a serious show about a bounty hunter, no silly stuff or kids" After release "If anything bad happens to baby Yoda i will destroy this planet"
At this point Ryan jeorge and pitch meeting is one and same. So this is the pitch meeting multiverse.
"Frik-ing Luke Skywalker is going to show up..." that's the part I don't understand. If dark troopers are made out of Frik, how come luke could slice them with his lightsaber? Frik is supposed to resist light sabers just like Beskar.
*Points* "HE'S FROM ALL OF IT!"   I literally threw my head back and cackled 🤣
"He's from the other thing!!" Disney's only plot.
Best pitch meeting on hear yet
This is one of the best.
I love how this episode is a mix of a Ryan skit and a regular Pitch Meeting
This was my favorite pitch meeting ever lmfao
This guy is american gold.
Late much?
I didn’t know you didn’t do the mandalorion lol
I think the producer guy bit could have been better at the end.
'and promote their own disney plus shows'  Could not have put it any better.
I would like to see what a beautiful woman looks like in this universe
was NOT ready for Creed karaoke 😆😆
Producer guy has more character arch than Disney star wars characters.
This one was a ride
Man dough.  Love handles.  I'm still chuckling.
This took a rather intense turn pretty quick
*This is the way* to do a pitch meeting
So it’s now canon that their official names are Producer Guy and Writer Guy? Love it.
Can you please do pitch meeting for The Mummy(1999) and The Mummy Returns
“Ads.” YouTube 🤑
it is an absolute joy, and pleasure, to see your vids. I hope you make vast amounts of filthy lucre and get down with all your bad selves.
Doing this one was not “Super easy, barely an inconvenience” There, it’s done. Now get all the way off his back about it.
"Luke Skywalker is gonna show up and destroy them all" "He's from all of it!"  Man the delivery on that line was spectacular, got me good.
Can you make Army Swiss man pitch meeting
Ryan deserves to be a lot more famous.  I see great things in his future
Happy Men's Mental Health Month
Best Pitch Meeting so far.
using my garbage bin as a bathroom is tight
Um, that was great as usual, but um... Top Gun Maverick? Please. Please. Please... Pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease Thank you Ryan.
streaching that kaching joke real thin. amazing.
You really overdid yourself on this one. Perhaps my favorite pitch meeting.
The Mandalorian was the best Star Wars experience since Disney took over. And that makes me just as happy as it makes me sad.
Dhdjdjdj
I can't like this video hard enough xD
Great way to scalate things for no reason! That's how you keep this sketch TIGHT!
He's from everything 😂
The lore was so deep... it broke new ground and subverted our expectations.
hey, shut up!
"With arms wide opppeen... That's my creed :) " I laughed way too hard at that.
Producer guy went on a side quest just like Mando, feeling like Mando is tight.
I can’t believe that I got so wrapped up in the emotional stakes of Mando taking his helmet off at the bad guy HQ that it’s only now that Ryan pointed it out that I realize the scan itself doesn’t quite make sense 😂🤣.
"With arms wide open..."
More character development in this one silly episode than in Rey's entire 9 hours of screen time.
this bit has officially jumped the shark! i wondered why this one was 8 minutes long
I loved that mini arc with producer guy(tm)
FINALLY!!!! 😂Been waiting for years.
"HE'S FROM ALL OF IT!"  I died xD!
“What kind of creature is he?” “He’s uhh, Bostonian” “Oh I love science fiction!”
Ryan George meets Pitch Meeting 😂
I feel for producer guy. Sometimes when I'm not paying attention to where I'm walking I miss a change in elevation and just walk out onto air. But once I realize I'm there and can't defy physics, I look down at the ground below me, look forward, and then drop down. But I've come to accept that my body and mind taking a few seconds to acknowledge gravity is okay. I just need to avoid walking on very high cliffs or skyscraper roofs.
This is beautiful. A well-written episode within an episode. This is a very nice change of pace Ryan🤩🤩
Ryan: "If you haven't heard, Pitch Meetings now have their very own channel." Me, watching this video on the Pitch Meetings channel: "Yeah."
Producer guy is the goat🫡🫡
I love all your pitch meetings but I really want to see The Man With Two Brains and My Blue Heaven.
A drinking game: Every time Baby Yoda is said you take a shot. Every time he says Grogu, you can stop drinking. Repeat the video over and over until you hear Grogu. Before you ask, "Yes, I do find alcohol poisoning funny, why do you ask?"
Turning Red Pitch Meeting:  Screenwriter Guy: You know that thing your eyes turned into dollar signs and made a cash register sound? I put that in the movie!  Producer Guy: Oh eyes turning into cash registers are tight! *Ka-Ching*
Finally Mando!!!!!
“With arms wide opennnn” “What” “That’s my Creed”  Yes.
The Creed song caught me off guard lmao. Nice one.
For the love of god interstellar. Just play loud music the entire time lol
Um actuall first dark troopers are cyborg Stormtroopers mixed with cybernetic similar to Vader but with no minds
Dogma please
"What kind of creature is he?"  "He's, uhhhh, Bostonian?"
"Doctor,  whenever I feel embarrassed or awakard a big drop of sweat  appears on my head"  "You should get that checked out"
We finally have fusion between Ryan George projects.  Pitch Meeting Producer Guy, meeting First Guy to Ever Have Dollar Signs in his Eyes.
Don't worry kids, Disney got their millions.
“Just so many side quests!” So true!
such an epic character growth arc
The creed bit killed me.
He's from all of it!
“With arms wide open”
"He's a Bostonian." LMAO 🤣🤣🤣
Baby Yoda does cute stuff, e.g. eats frogs.
Oh my god, that tangent from the dollar sign eyes had me laughing hysterically for its entire duration. So many of these pitch meetings, and Ryan still finds ways to surprise me.
"You heard that cha ching noise was that just me?" "You know Mr. Producer guy"
“And what kinda creature is he?” “He’s uuuuuuuh…Bostonian…” “Oh I love science fiction!”
As someone that owns several Baby Yodas...(Grogu), those dollar signs were real.
When Ryan started singing "With arms wide open" by Creed, I lost it🤣
I wish there was more representation for those who have cartoon reactions. This is an issue that's been overlooked for far too long. This channel is ahead of the entire world media and I praise their bravery
The Mando pitch meeting having a side quest is very on brand.
So thus confirmed a universe where everyone looks the same but are different
Wow wow wow wow. Wow!
The Creed reference got me 😅
The dollar-sign-eyes tangent was really top-notch comedy. Bravo, my man. I laughed good at that.
Honestly that face scan thing was so dumb.
I had to stop the video when he started singing the Creed song because I was laughing too hard to hear anything else
I’m looking forward to seeing your the book of boba fett pitch meeting
Man that Creed reference really took this series higher. Wait sorry I mean HIIIIIII-YAAAAAH. Whoops!
Ok, I just had spine surgery, and I nearly undid all of it laughing at the Creed joke. Damn and thank you.
The Pitch Meeting: The Mandalorian - Snyder Cut!  Gotta say, really liking the extended version. The standard theatrical cuts can seem a little too short at times.
Magnificent pitch meeting! I hope producer guy gets this series done!
Cutaways in a Pitch Meeting?! Impossible!
"With arms wide open...thats my Creed." One of the best jokes on this channel ever!
Wow wow wow, wow
First we learn that Producer Guy and Screenwriter Guy were second cousins and now this!
Lots of different glasses styles in this one. Way to commit to the bit!
I'm a zombie now. you just killed me with this video and I'm still alive
Great! I literally searched for this pitch yesterday.
The lack of initial merchandising really helped them hide the surprise twist of a baby Yoda at the end of the first episode... until about 3 minutes after the episode went live and screenshots of the final scene flooded social media.
Too Wong Fu Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar Pitch Meeting please!!!! It would be super easy, barely an inconvenience!
"wait, for 2 two seasons it'd be x16... because I guess that at a specific future point there would be 2 current seasons. Even though right now we haven't even made the show." "Wow, predicting time-specific future perspectives is tight!"
Pitch meetings documentaries are tight!
How is no one talking about your creed? Lol
so thats what took so long to make the T.V show
"He's from all of it!" -- best line ever.
He's a Bostonian LMFAO
You took the bit too far. It was too much.
Totally unrelated:  I have to say, the first 3 episodes of Obi Wan disappointed me as well. Disney is destroying this franchise...
The therapy montage was amazing.
This moment of Producer guy talking to everyone about his problems had me laugh for 2 minute straight. This guy is a freaking comedy genius
wow we´ve never seen so much Pitch Meeting lore before !
Clones. Clones everywhere.
"Very Endorable...."
Everything about this is TIGHT!!!
When a youtuber has more consistent lore in their videos,  compared to multimillion corporations is kind of sad.
Can we get the room
Do a pitch meeting of chip n dale rescue rangers
dude that was amazing
This is the best tangent I've ever seen in a video
Oh expanding the Pitch Meeting lore is tight.
If this guy wants it , he really could have his own show one day he's great
"WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN!!" 💀💀
"He's a Bostonian" lmfaooooooo
I love how the whole first 3 minutes are about him loving money
How about a pitch meeting for Fifth Element?
I’m literally wearing a Baby Yoda tee while I workout. “When your song come on” am I right??
AWOOGAAAAAAAA
The Loorreee 🤑🤑
The cartoon eye counseling 😂😂
Feel like we're in need of a Lego Batman Movie pitch meeting
Watching this series' growth like this is really something special when you've been here since the beginning.
I realize that it's not a popular movie, but 2017's Annihilation is my favorite movie of all time and I propose that its mind-bending terror would make for a funny pitch meeting.
I lost interest immediately when I saw baby yoda.
Producer: Oh wait I'm getting a call from YMS, the creepy-ass stalker who hates my guts for making a big kitty movie
people: baby yoda is adorable, you couldn't possibly make him look creepy and weird  Guy that makes the pitch meeting thumbnails: actually you can, it's super easy! barely an inconveniance!
lmao this show looks so stupid, love the pitch meeting
Snarky-Doctor-Guy has entered the chat…cha-ching!!
Let’s not forget Mayfield killing dozens of Imperials right after mourning the loss of his platoon. What a moronic hypocrite!
Wow, this pitch meetings are getting a budget increase, so many new characters!
Ryan George is carrying this channel. He deserves a channel of his own.
Jesus Christ! That Thumbnail! LOL
0:57 he plays 5 different versions of himself just with glasses and they’re all believably different people
Ryan talking about baby Yoda just keeps giving me an idea of what the producers in demon slayer were like when talking about nezuko
Finally a crossover that's super easy, barely an inconvenience!
The Creed joke, so unexpected and so funny!
The beginning was hilarious!
I literally rolled on the ground laughing when that cash sign showed
Why did I get massive deja vu (out of the normal super easy barely an inconvenience levels) from this vid?
Grogu is over here cracking up. Very nice. Very professional.
It's the "It's the 90s" guy but with his hat on weird!
This was just an emotional roller coaster of a pitch meeting that really explored the characters in depth and really made them real, I cried 74 times by the sheer emotional weight that this pitch meeting brought forth, I feel like I grew to be a better man by just watching this pitch meeting.
This will be the closest Producer Guy ever comes to redemption. I'm so proud!
That dollar sign quest was a bit long, but that’s ok. I’m not complaining! The more, the better!  Now we know more about producer guy. And because of it, this might be the longest Pitch Meeting.
first
Producer Guy had more character development in this episode than all the characters combined in the sequels, BoBF and Kenobi.
Saying tight and supereasy barley an inconvienence is the way
I imagine Producer Guy's father as MLM Guy.
The Mandalorian keeps getting dumber and dumber the more I hear about it.  Season 8 is nothing against that shows stupidity.
Please do pitch meetings for both Top Gun movies
i just shuddered at the thought of a Bostonian planet in Star Wars
“Let’s do Lone Wolf and Cub, but it’s Star Wars. And the baby is gonna be like yoda”
Ker-CHING!!!!!
Subscribing to this channel is tight!
“I’ve been looking forward to this!”
"that's my creed" I laughed too hard about that one.
So many funny moments on this one. But that Creed joke totally floored me🤣🤣🤣🤣  One of the best Pitch Meetings yet!
You know they have medicine where you can keep those eye flares to a minimum
OK great job with creed
If all the men in this world look like Ryan, what do the women look like? What about the animals?
Please do a Boba Fett one now
bhahahahahahahaha hands down the best one yet....from doc to shrink to support group - classic... now we have to see the movie of how Producer Guy became Producer Guy....  please make us a short doco or something funny PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
But money
Um, Actually, Grogu has FORCE powers, not JEDI powers. You silly.
This is one of the only "film criticism" type channels that I dont just get annoyed by. The humor is always great, and it never feels like cheap shots for a laugh, I love it.
When something is so perfect he has to pad his run time....
I need to see more of the cartoon animations support group.
You could argue the suprise is part of the fact there was such a high demand for merchandise in the first place.
I like how Pitch Meeting guy brought in Ryan George for a side story.
WITH ERMS WIDE OPAHN! 😆
This pitch meeting is better and has more character development than kenobi so far, lol
I mean, are these even showing up on Screenrant anymore? It was the only worthwhile thing on there as it was....
Show hands if you also knew exactly where the "super easy, barely an inconvenience" part would be even before clicking on the video?
0:29 any time a studio exec hears the phrase "Intellectual Property."
Please do a video about "A.I." (2001 movie).
Pitch the Goonies!
👍🏼😂🤣
the creative freedom ryan is getting to expand his universe, i just hope zack snyder would have got that.
Man the world building really expanded. Great video
A Disney Bolt Pitch Meeting would be interesting to watch.
Ryan outdid himself on this Pitch Meeting. Well Done! It would be super awesome if he did one of the following:  1. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen 2. Rocky Horror Picture Show 3.Shrek 4. Labyrinth 5. Morel Orel
Multiple lvls of dark reality
The lore expansion we never knew we needed but loved anyway
I love how the character development was just going in a circle... like, he forgot he liked money and remembered that he liked money.... so nothing actually changed.... and he was being forced to change, so that's not real character growth.... dude had his money hostage with the story... so no merch if no product...
Ah completely halting a pitch meeting episode for personal self discovery of an already well know fact IS TIGHT
The birth of the PMCU.
You forgot about the two stormtroopers trying to shoot a can.
"Valuable Merchandising Opportunity" is my new drag name.
‘Friggin Luke Skywalker’ is tight.
Everywhere all at once!
"What kind of creature is he?" "A Bostonian." "I love science fiction!".
I was literally just thinking “is there a mandalorian pitch meeting?” And then you uploaded this literally just now (June 10th in 🇦🇺) can you read my mind
Ryan does it make you sad that you can't just enjoy these films and have to just break the suspension of disbelief and eviscerate them? I mean I like that you do but I feel for you.
I didn’t think you could perfect this show more than you already have. This was amazing.   Bravo
Squeezing a solo Ryan George sketch into a Pitch Meeting sketch is TIGHT! "I've been standing here for three days!"
The fact that you spent 2:30 minutes on money eyes shows me that moving this to its own channel was worth it.
Love your pitch meetings Ryan. This was an awesome video. Great video
Producer guy had more character development than the entire Disney Star wars sequel trilogy.
Pitch Meeting Into the  Ryanverse
i was already going to like at the end, but when i heard "with arms wide open" i liked early to be safe
I love how Ryan just randomly slipped in a  whole character arc for Producer Guy in the middle of the meeting lmao😂😂
"...So then Luke Skywalker did a backflip, snapped the dark trooper's necks and saved the day!"
I'm commenting only one minute into the video but this is the greatest pitch meeting ever already. Almost four years later and you're still crushing it, Ryan. Great job!
Well thats not something you see on the pitch meeting channel 0:26
"We are Disney sir, will the emotion connection be any good?" "Pff I doubt it, we have money" "I'm going to make you cry like a baby" "What was that?" "Nothing sir"
Another Homerun
"So anyway Boba Fett follows Mando to a planet with Slave 1! Remember that?"  "Why didn't he use the ship to ambush Mando on the ground and get the armor sooner?"  "Heyshutup"
“WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN, that’s my creed” Laughed so freaking hard at this 🤣😂 keep up the great work Ryan!!
After the last jedi star wars is not tight
Finally, a character arc! Lollll
I really like the thing you did with the guy and the stuff.
Producer guy insanity arc
A baby version of a popular old alien muppet is TIGHT! 🤑
“And what happens to the crew after?”  “Oh well Baby Yoda ends up rejecting Luke Skywalker and reuniting with Mando!”  “What, like in Season 3?”  “Nope, in a mediocre Disney+ show about Boba Fett.”  “What if people haven’t seen that show, aren’t they gonna be confused as to why Baby Yoda is suddenly back with the Mandalorian?”  “Oh yeah. Whoops!”  “Whoopsie!”
"And what kind of creature is he?" "Uhh, Bostonian." "Oh I love science fiction." Ha!
"He's a... Bostonian..."
0:26 WOWOWOWOW 🤑🤑🤣
So…..is baby yoda an reincarnation of old yoda
My Creed would do anything to keep from being homeless again and likes to throw things into the quarry...
Lot of effort put into a joke that wasn't funny, and time wasted that could have been dedicated to the actual pitch meeting.
I LOVE the turn this took. :DD
I like the side quest regarding the common cartoon cliché of dollar sign eyes
"Sounds like a decorative lamp."
lol that creed reference came out of nowhere
Wait what? How does Luke train baby Yoda when it was old Yoda that trained Luke? Paradox....
The next one has to be about Book of Boba
I'm half convinced that Oscar Isaac watched endless videos of Ryan to perfect his Moon Knight roles.
HE'S FROM ALL OF IT!
I thought the dollar sign $ eye joke went on too long.
WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN!!! That's my Creed...
The Disney+ algorithm AI joke was tight!
"With arms wide open!" LMAO
Fun fact, Lucasfilm & Disney estimate they missed out on approx $33-96mil 💰💰💰 in toys, marketing, revenue because of not seeing the Yoda-Grogu character become super popular.
"*HE'S FROM ALL OF IT*"
A meaningful and entertaining journey. The Mandalorian? Not so much.
I'm excited for the Producer Guy Cinematic Universe.
How about a Pitch Meeting about the movie Pitch Perfect II??
How about another retro pitch meeting for Hogan's Heroes or Beverly Hillbillies.  Or try out a horrible British accent and do Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
The wasn't an overly long bit, no sir.
Pitch Meeting X First Guy to Have Eyes Turn into Dollar Signs is tight
"B-But money!"
Creed references are tight!
Its high time you do the 100
"he's from all of it" ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Yeah, I don't think they ultimately had any problems essentially printing money off of BY merch.
Obi-Wan Kenobi next cause that'll be tight
Outstanding installment of Pitch Meeting, sir! Loved the extra beats for Producer Guy; would gladly watch more of that stuff whenever you feel like sprinkling it in.
he's a Bostonian. lol
Bostonian. Burr is gonna like that joke
Wow this is peak character development
This may be your best work ever, including anything you do after this.  Get married?  Have a baby?  All achievements pale in comparison to this moment.  I salute you sir.
Randomly singing Creed songs is TIGHT
Producer Guy had quite a journey. I wept, I laughed, I tilted my head a bit to the side and said, “eh?”
Please do pitch meetings for the Resident Evil Series 🤩🥳
Pitch Meeting is evolving, and I'm here for it all :)
Pitch meet more tv shows
Oh new pitch meetings are tight!
I think it was a really dumb idea to hide Baby Yoda from the pre show advertising and merchandise. A lot of people weren’t planning on even watching it because they didn’t see much of a plot
What a stupid show
Wow but Producer Guy went on a journey this week.
what no mention of how baby Yoda ate the unborn children of a sentient race?
I thought when PG told the doctor his problem, the doctor would get Cash Register Eyes thinking about all the tests he could charge for
Just let me set up a bowl. And us 3 will be golden.
I love how these just never get old
the RyanVerse is evolving....things u love to see
about time a mandalorian pitch meeting of this was made!!
- he's a... Bastonian? - oh, I love science fiction!  I dunno why, but that made me laugh a lot
We need a pitch meeting for the Johnny Depp trial 😂
Ryanverse and Pitch Meeting collisions are tight!
26 132 views en 20 min.  Malade !
This was amazing, leaving the studio and seeing other members of the ryan-youtube-verse.
Cha-ching at 0:27
Bro what the hell just happened I love it.
that self discovery is tight 😁😂
Please do a pitch meeting on the cabin in the woods.....also this video was great  I don't know how you get so many new idea's for stuff to put in your videos you're really talented
That decision at the end had less logic than season 8 of Game of Thrones. His whole thing is money and we spend the series showing that and then when he can get enough to buy Canada he agrees to just not???
While I understand avoiding the subject, a shout out to Gina would have been tight.
Ironically disney didn't anticipate the popularity of grogu and didn't make enough merch at first
omg this dollar-sign-thing was incredible. had to stop the video just to laugh.
Plz do the rescue rangers movie. Thar would be fun
Need to get help from a shrink to deal with your problems? Super easy, barely an inconvenience
I love the dollar sign eyes bit!
Pure comedy gold.
This episode was freakin nuts, but in a good way!!!😅😅😅😘😘
Since this show is about side quests and character growth, only makes sense producer guy went on the same journey
I dont know why, but I always assumed I already had watched a Mandalorian Pitch Meeting. How did this slip through the cracks of their list of projects till now?
Please make a pitch meeting for Momento
I pased a Click video when I got the notification for this ... good decision.
I’ve been waiting for this pitch!!!
That is quite a character development for the Producer guy
Amphibia, I would love to see the reactions to the stabbing in a kid's show.
Ok you’ve done the mandalorian now do the book of Boba Fett
WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN!
One of my favourite pitch meetings yet!
Mandy is short for Mandalorian.
I'm not a star warsfan but im so glad I watched this week, the self discovery was amazing 🙌
Producer "First Guy to have the cartoon cash register effect" Guy.
I think what my life is missing is an adorable little merchandising opportunity. If I could have that, well, then my life would finally be TIGHT.
Do one for Gladiator!
Is all this new pitch meeting lore even canon?
it will never get old, seeing ryan playing multiple characters in a group setting.  that editing is on point!
That Creed joke was incredible!
Zangief said "just because you're a bad guy, doesn't mean you're a bad guy."
Doing Tremors would be tight, tight, tight!
The AWOOGAAA sound sent me 😭😭😭
This is the way.
I like how originally there was actual questions on if that really WAS a baby yoda, instead of just some baby of his species. Then we learned his name and all collectively said, "Nah, hes still baby yoda"
Awesome. He finally breaks the formula and creates a bit of world building. Thank you Ryan. Keep doing that!
Eragon?
A BABY YODA 🤑🤑
I hope Ryan is compensating all these actors that guest starred in this video
"hey shutup"......brilliant
Checking my watch during the money eyes bit…can we MOVE ON PLEASE 😂 sheesh
I would have written the Luke Skywalker scene in the pitch meeting like it was in the show. Don't mention his name until his face is shown and just describe details that are specific to him as producer guy gets more and more excited.
Oh Money! That's the thing I like!
Do Amphibia, please
You like money too??? We should hang together!
By 3:11 and there has been two sentences about the show 😂
I wonder if producer guy’s universe is the same as the Ryan George universe or are we seeing a multiverse situation here. Also shoutout for time traveler reporter guy!
when he said "I was worried the skywalkers weren't somehow in this", I felt that
👏🏿😁👍🏿
This is where the fun begins!
Lmao!
*Pitch Meeting for TRON (1982), please, please, PLEASE, puh-LEEEEEEEEEASE!*  😁😁😁
Masterpiece
"He's from all of it!" 😂
Mandalorian sounds like a lamp
this pitch meeting was on point!!!
I was hoping Mr Krabs would be at that meeting. He knows what Producer Guy is going through.
as if I wasn't emotionally invested in Mr Producer Guy enough º.º
Perhaps a Monsters vs Aliens pitch meeting?
It should be possible for me to give this video a million thumbs up, because it deserves that, I decided.
Surprised you didn't mention the fobs and how they completely destroy all Star Wars lore and tension because they make it impossible to hide anywhere in the galaxy since they can trace an individual person to where they are hiding without having to put a tracking device of some other kind on them before hand.
This is the way
This channel is just a blessing.
i love how we derail the pitch meeting for the producer to question everything
I have been waiting all day for a Pitch Meeting!
This episode was like some kind of Multiverse of Madness...
HAHA BEST EPISODE
Producer guy getting his own sub plot is TIGHT!
Please do a pitch meeting for the 2017 and 2021 My Little Pony movies
Oh my god..... like 2, 3, 4 locations to the Pitch Meeting Universe.
I'm glad producer guy got the support he needed.
The collaboration between the Pitch Meeting channel and Ryan George’s channel was TIGHT!
The producer guy is basically Mr. Krabs
I would love to see an amphibia pitch meeting
But money ?
Hey pls pls pls do peacemaker
Still waiting for Dante's Peak, Commando, Predator, The Day After Tomorrow, The Goonies and Twister
0:29 insert Mr. Krabs meme or gif
Can you do Avatar: The Last Airbender TV show?!
the pitch meeting universe is expanding with back story and other rooms other than the one default_office_v2.png
Whatever happened to Creed?
Because of this dollar signs storyline, now there definitely needs to be a Pitch Meeting of "One Froggy Evening".
So, can I get some character development for Mando? No. None. Ok then.
the dead milkmen did a song called dollar signs in her eyes, I thought them saying it was funny.  https://youtu.be/bGFLc6b7qeM
pitch meeting service the side quest!
Ryan'a creativity knows no bounds. Great work!
Finally catching up with all the D+ exclusive star wars shows is TIGHT
That Luke scene was an emotional experience bro, the score, the build-up, all of it combined with a shared hallway scene with his father brought a tear to my eye.
Finally!!!!! I’ve been waiting for this pitch meeting episode to drop for soooo long!!
Ryan ... no mention of Disney trying to reduce viewership by firing Gina Carano?
Only 2 minutes in already the best episode ever made. Keep it up!
You clean forgot to rag on Gina Carano for being an utterly crazy magat.
Oh you have done yourelf proud with this one...
"but.....my ..... money..." .........indeed......lol
Never seen this, but is Mando that one guy from the other movies???
I've been waiting for this for many moons
Oh god this was a roller coaster, so much emotion, be strong producer guy.
Ryan is picking this series back up
Character growth 👍
That absolutely incredible feeling of going somewhere unexpected and beautiful after almost 300 amazing yet familiar journeys…  There is no words.   This was special
🤣 I've been standing here for 3 days... & That's ok.. super easy, barely an inconvenience.. sudden departures are tight😅
ooooh i loved it!!!!! kinda long that $$👀 story but anyway it was good. it was excactly what i wanted!. do next Inhumans before they maaaaayyyyyybbbeeeee show up in Ms Marvel, plz
How do these keep getting better lol
Ryan, i am thinking of starting an youtube channel. can you give me a few pointers? like how did you start and so on.. dont really have a lot of money so what to buy and all. i like your style, i decided!
First name Producer, last name Guy!
Character development? World building? Lore!?!? WHAT IS THIS? BECAUSE I LOVE IT😂😂😂💯💯💯
That detour was hilarious
Loved the self discovery journey!!!! Lol!!!! 💛💛💛💛
Can you do a jaws , back to the future 2, and men in black international pitch meeting
This crazy I know some of these characters from the Ryan George universe!
Bad ass mandalorian and baby yoda is tight!
So, this confirms that pitch meeting, and all subsequent pitch meetings all take place in a fictional cartoon world?   Sweet
"with arms wide open"... That came out of nowhere 🤣
"Amazing Money"!!!
Producer: I do it for the art  Cut to news report of baby yoda merchardise having low sells
💰👄💰
So, this is a crossover with your personal channel?
Singing Creed is tight
The group therapy session is genius.
The eye cash sign bit went on a lot longer then expected.
Starwars the Ryan clones, a new spin off, directed by ...?
🤣🤣😂🤌✨
Do the Mitchells vs. the Machines. It’s my favorite animated movie and supremely underrated.
Please do a Boba Fett PM, and also Ms Marvel once all the episodes are out.
Do maverick
Wow wow wow wow wow I love it  The expansion and the way the episode is done is fantastic 👏
I would like to see a v for vendetta pitch meeting
That Creed reference was tight!
Pitch meeting finally crossed over with Ryan george!
This pitch meeting had a deeper plot than most of the Disney Star Wars projects
The Creed joke was perfect.
I love seeing the Expanded Ryan Universe get fleshed out. WOW WOW WOW
The producer-guy finally digivolved into Mr. Krab!
This was so freaking good! Thanks Ryan.
A-MAZE-ING
You should definitely do THE BOYS I decided
Nothing wrong with this series, so I expect them to just stare at each other for 8 minutes
Ryan finally collaborated with himself!!
So they keep talking about these amazing creatures in Ryanverse, and I just have to ask - how do these mysterious "women" look like?
This Baby Yoda nonsense has gotten out of hand. It really needs to stop.
didn’t know a dive into the psyche of producer guy was something I’d be so invested in
My uncle floated when he smelt a pie and nobody would believe him. Thank you Pitch Meetings for destygmatising the support groups that aren't as pretty as Testicular cancer or sexy as Star Wars Addicts.
Love Death+Robots pitch meeting please! I would love to see that.   Show is awesome.
“I’m ok with loving money”  “And that’s ok” “Wow that worked didn’t it?” “It did, didn’t it?? *starts singing start wars*
And ALL that ............ for Nothing .............. baby yoda is back for no good reason .... ,  well ,  for The MONEY in fact ..............
Well this took a turn
Rick and Morty       Archer.       Power Rangers.   The boys.     old Ninja Turtles movies and just more pitch meeting uploads you're great
Matpat should do a video on the lore of Pitch Meeting 😂
Took long enough 😅
Please do a Pulp Fiction Pitch Meeting!
Cool video Ryan! What about an Invincible pitch meeting
HOW. I want to know how you are able to make these things better every time. That's some actual self-growth.
Book of a Boba Fett next
Almost 700k!
That dollar sign joke was just dreadful
Did Pitch Meetings just do a Cutaway gag?
Dune would be super easy, barely an inconvenience
I feel like we got a Ryan George skit for "first guy to have a medical mystery" in the middle of this Pitch Meeting and I am so grateful.
Thought it would've made sense to do it after S3 but I wanted this a long time so better late than never
Wow this did not go how I expected. Good on you for taking the journey of self discovery
I am disappointed Disney has not announced the baby Ryan George figure yet... complete with dollar signs in the eyes.
It could also be that Mando has a past with the Empire that we don't know about yet, and that that is the way(hehe) his face got accepted at the terminal
The dollar sign plot twist was perfection XD
Producer Guy’s journey helped me cope with my struggle of lightbulbs appearing above my head whenever I get an idea.
How did that guy see a pretty woman if everyone in that universe has Ryan's face?
DO TOP GUN 2
I really need to sit down and watch this show. But idk. That's kinda super  difficult. Barely a convenience
Long have I waited
He's a Bostonian? Oh, I love science fiction!
I'm now left with the thought of a bunch of Ryan's having an A.A. meeting about their cartoon trope issues regarding their eyes, and my life hase forever been changed for the better.
I like money.
A ptch meeting for Bob Odenkirks Nobody would be TIGHT!
@1:12 what is happening?? i love it though and i need more.
Disney writers are so garbage that it hurts, the rest of star wars is even worse
"So you have a toy product for me?" "Yes sir I do, and a show to go with it." "Oh, shows built around merchandise opertunities are TIGHT"
Producer Guy’s journey helped me cope with my struggle of floating in the air when I smell a delicious pie.
The dollar signs for me
The real reason this video took so long was because Screen Rant wouldn’t let Ryan have that full character arc joke. And he would not budge on cutting it. So once Pitch Meeting got its own channel, Ryan got more creative control.
Ryan is the Eddie Murphy of YouTube.
Pitch Meeting Cinematic Universe
The lore...
this was unexpected but amazing
I love that Producer Guy got the help he needed. Very wholesome.
Too...much...Ryan.....  Oh wait.
Ok this is the most unique pitch meeting episode of all time. It’s also funny 😂
Lmao. Ryan on creative steroids.
Somehow I thought we’ve already seen this
That character growth cut was way too funny I gotta say
Tell Ryan George to read his comments Or at least for these comments to be read
Let's not forget that Disney wasted their first year of "merchandising" because they didn't produce are real merch for baby Yoda.
giving an actual Creed reference lmao
Finally!!!!!! Now do Book Of Boba Fett before you do Obi-Wan Kenobi
Asoka is from the clone wars and not rebels
Producer Guy's side trip into therapy to confirm his love of money... Yeah. I don't think there was any actual character growth there.  I think that may be a metaphor for this show.
Bostonian... haha
We were introduced to so many new characters in this one
Dude where is our Peacemaker pitch meeting
Didn’t realize I needed The Producer Guy side plot in my life
Oh Creed, What a great Song, nice taste
The Lore is expanding
Such Character development 😂
Honestly think the part about him seeing various people because of the dollar sign thing went way too far. I mean he has made jokes revolving his eyes and other parts of his body before but it has always just been a quick throwaway line that didn’t overstay its welcome or put the rest of the skit to a halt. I mean these skits have always been about jokes in quick succession with fast deliveries, so to see this one drag on so felt really out of place.  That is all, I’ll see myself out.
The dollar sign eyeballs!🤣🤣
3 minutes into the video and I really thought I clicked on a pitch meeting not a philosophical journey
Lost it at the dollar sign eyes and couldn't concentrate just laughing the rest of the pitch 😂
That was a Family Guy level cutaway 👍
Oh, journeys of self disocvery are super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Does this complete the character arc for producer guy?
Overrated show
Producer Guy’s journey helped me cope with my struggle of only being effected by gravity when I look down.
The Kenobi Pitch Meeting is gonna be depressing...
I absolutely cannot wait for the Halo pitch meeting
Did not expect the mini sketch within the sketch.
Please do a pitch meeting on severance
that was an interesting journey
Getting some more Ryan George content on his second channel, nice
Baby Yoda is tight
I was going to have to describe to the haircutter the exact haircut I want. Now I am just going to play this video. Thank you and nice haircut.
Massive 2 for 1 video and I'm all for it 😂
THE LOREEEEEEEE!!!!
Do Rampage next please with The Rock
Love the creed joke
Happy season 1 pitch meeting Major spoilers ahead  So you have a tv show for me  Yes sir I do it’s called happy and it stars Chris Meloni who plays a cop in New York City  Woah I’m afraid this show already exists  No this was after he was fired from the police and now he’s working for the mob  Oh my bad this is a totally different show  Then his daughter gets taken at a concert by c homeless man dressed as Santa Claus and he has to look for her now  It still sounds like a an other thing  I assure you sir this is a new thing  So how does he find his daughter  Well he needs to team up with his daughters imaginary freind named happy the horse  Are there any other characters  There’s this guy named smoothie  Smoothie what’s his deal  Well the first episode ends with the main character and happy running away from smoothie and his friends after they tried to cut the main character’s **** off  Wow wow wow…. Wow  So after that smoothie is hunting the main character because he wants to show him why they call him smoothie  Does the main character ever find out why they call him smoothie?  Yes he does when smoothie captures him and pulls down *** ***** and there is no ** **, then smoothie puts * **** *** **** ** ** *** **** ********* ****.  Wow how are we going to be able to show that anywhere let alone the syfy channel  Oh they will be cool with it  Oh they will?  So the main character finds out that Santa Claus was sent by the musician at the concert took his daughter  How do we find this out  Well the musical has a bug inspired **** with the tellitubies  Oh bug inspired *****are tight I go to them all the time.  Egh so after that the main character does a backflip cracks Santa’s neck and saves the day  So are there any cliffhanger that this season leaves off on  Yes there is an ancient curse possessing the side characters and the musician got away  So what do you think  I think it’s good so we’ll cancel it after two seasons instead of one and the cast wont try to save it  https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/amp/news/chris-meloni-endorses-save-happy-movement/
So this guy is a doctor, a producer guy a pitch meeting guy and a glasses guy? Is this guy Jonny Sins?!
The producer guy’s reaction to hearing about the idea of a Baby Yoda is probably exactly the same as the merchandising team at Disney
"Mando huh? that's what I call my love handles." I am %100 stealing this.
God, the eye bit was amazing💀Thanks Ryan <3
Following the Way is super easy, barely an inconvinience
Feels like Ryan George main chanel video <3 <3
Having cash register eyes  is TIGHT.
the Ryan Hex expands
Ryan George has his own cinematic universe
do jaws please
There’s no better universe than Pitch Meeting.
This is the way.
nice
Lmaoooo not the AA group 😂
Nice to see all of the other guys from the organisation where names for things are decided ❤️😂💪🏻
That side quest was TIGHT! Producer guy gained a few levels, definitely worth it!
Love the opening. 😂😂
Do Splice!
Can't wait to see the explanation for Leia in the trench coat in Kenobi
Ryan was struggling to hit the word count on this one lmao
4 minutes ago!? I'm in !
I hope producer guy works out his mental health problems. #putyourhealthfirst #getbettersoon
I sit here by my grogu AirPods case recently been to forbidden planet browsing the Star Wars grogu stuff
🤑🤑🤑🤑
How have you not already done this?! Your content is amazing. I absolutely demand that you  make more, faster, all the time!
Holy shit, that dollar sign skit was too funny
A baby Yoda!? $$
To do list: What If Encanto HISHE collab Book of Mandalor- I mean Boba Fett (Ryan George in a Luke Davidson collab) Premiere pitch meetings instead of a regular upload Although I think Screen Rant controls this channel so they don’t care what the fans have to say lol (Go ahead, prove me wrong)
Great twist🤣
That beginning was amazing
A mandalorian pitch meeting damn Ryan George knows what I want more than I do
Best one yet. 💯💯💯
I mean yeah… I liked the video before I even watched it but that’s how much faith I have in you. Ryan and George both.
A new character!!!! Oh sh*t characters 😂
Great video Ryan. What if you did a pitch meeting on the TMNT movie
Great video. Going off on a tangent is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Wow that was a journey through the exec’s psyche
Producer Guy 🤝 Mr. Krabs                      MONEY
“maybe you really just like money"  "Huh..."
I love how it for a second it stopped being a Pitch Meeting, and became a Ryan George sketch video. That was kinda genius.
This episode really expanded the pitch meeting lore, and world building. We were introduced to more places outside the office. And who would’ve guessed the people outside were also identical looking. That plot twist was tight.
Omdzz best episode yet😂😂👌🏻👌🏻
He went on a side quest
The side story character development for producer guy was something I never knew I needed until I received it.
Producer Guy having more character development then most shows nowadays is tight!
Maybe you're all cartoon characters...
The lore thickens, his actual name is Producer Guy.
I was disappointed when the soul searching diversion plot line ended.
Loving money is tight.
That side story is way better than the pitch.
That was a better character journey than all the 3 sequels combined.
New characters in the Pitch Meeting Universe!  So. Many. New. Characters.
Dollar sign eyes needs a telethon damnit! No more!
Oh wow. Wasn’t expecting this. A welcome surprise for sure.
This video gets a awooga from me
🤑  At least he didn't have the green tongue.
Merchandise opportunity is the soul purpose of Star Wars now
The amount of time spent on the cash grab bit... is just too accurate...
This is absolutely hilarious just like all of your other videos I love it and I have been a fan of yours for years now and I just want to say thank you for bringing us all laughter through these rough times you’re a legend my friend keep up the good work you are doing amazing!
Omg the producer guy freaking out about Baby Yoda and the talking group is just incredible
The dollar sign sketch 😂😂
I never knew I needed to see Baby Yoda with giant eyes. Thank you.
There Pitch Meeting Cinematic Universe has expanded
That opening bit XD
Plz we need the boys pitch meeting
