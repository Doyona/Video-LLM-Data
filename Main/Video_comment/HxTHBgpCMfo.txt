Never forgiving them for not putting some real samurai shodown characters like ukyo, galford or making a great come back to the series with one of the most iconic characters in samurai shodown Hattori Hanzo
None of them is a samurai btw
🩷🥰
It makes me questioning why darli part of teams samurai
I still thinking Mai Shiranui could be a new DLC character on Samurai Showdown
Finally
江戸時代（西暦では中世）から覇王丸やナコルルなど、サムスピのキャラ達が時を越えて参戦したのなら、未来の時代からやって来た戦士たちがいても良かったのに…。などと思ったりしながら、この動画を見てました。 次回の16以降に、その様な旧SNK時代に作られたキャラの参戦を信じて、心待ちにしてます！
Best dlc ever
Darli and B. Jennet make the same facial expression in their respective thumbnails and have a special interactions with eachother as pirate and shipwright, B. Jennet who's a pirate doesn't look like a pirate and Darli looking like a pirate but isn't a pirate at all, in fact in her bio she hates being mistaken for a pirate.
The third member should have been Genjuro.
The way the announcer said Haohmaru, smooth as hell
No soy mucho de comentar pero como dato curioso en el kof 94 el primer juego se tenia pensando tener al equipo Samurai Shodow y el WordHeroes, pero en el caso de Samurai Shodow fue porqué estan en una época antigua.  Hablando de team estoy deacuerdo de que Nakoruru y Haomaru esten en el team pero Darli Dagger que apenas es ub personaje nuevo fue una mala elección, teniendo otros cómo Genguro. Galford, Kaziki, Jubei incluso Hanzo Hatori teniendo un diálogo con Andy o May Shiranui eso hubiera quedado mucho mejor, ademas ya estoy cansado de ver equipos dónde son 2 mujeres y un hombre, en algunos team ha funcionado pero ya es muy molestos.  Y lo de Kim fue imperdonable traerlo como un DLC, cuando es un personaje icónico de la franquicia.  Ahora solo queda esperar en un futuro muy lejano KOF XVI
OMG OMG OMG!!!
I'm not surprised they would make an appearance. They are part of the SNK franchises so it would make sense.
Idk, this is my first time to look these characters, but nakoruru stance is kinda like zero stance from megaman zero 🤔
OMG, so friggin awesome! Such a treat to still get some surprises in this great game! Now, make a team with characters from World Heroes, next, please, SNK!
Uffff, want to test this haohmaru 👌🥶
We should be a new guest team from other world in the future at the season 3 dlc pack such as dragon ball genshin mha jojo bizarre adventure sf tk and many more from non snk franchise.
Nakoruru the girl who from the beginning theme of fatal fury and rejected from super smash ultimate under sakurai orders to replace her as a mii costume fighter.
Haohmaru made a cross over in soul calibur 6 has sword style was so I was able to master it.
Me hubiera encantado que en lugar de poner ha esa Darli Dagger, incluyeran a Genjuro, Tam tam o Iroha.
And they can't even get the Samurai ShoDown team right! Iroha would have made more sense than Darli. This reminds me of Nintendo's recent stupid decisions over Smash Bros. such as choosing that one Arms girl over Twintelle, too many Fire Emblem characters, and the lack of WESTERN game characters (that aren't Japanese inspired) like Gordon Freeman or Arthur Morgan; but hey, let's pander to the Japanese EVEN MORE with those stupid Persona characters! And of course, Time Warner in one of their stupidest moves with the (now) failed MultiVersus, by including LeBRON JAMES as a guest star just because he appeared in Space Jam 2, despite that movie being universally hated! If you are going to have a person as a guest star, it should be someone like George Washington or Abraham Lincoln. And where the FXXK ARE THE WORLD HEROES CHARACTERS!?! I've been waiting since I saw that false ad saying they would be appearing in the 1994 original, and they still haven't shown up to this day!
I hope the new team is Shinobi

Hello SNK, Can we get "orochi iori", "orochi Leona" , "Kusanagi" & "god orochi" as "future dlc" for ,"2024", please SNK, I want this 4  characters so badly in "KOF 15"
Announcer announces the name in  traditional Japanese style like samurai show down . GREAT SPEED this time for haomaru he is the legend based on MIYAMOTO MUSASHI the great philosopher and warrior of Japanese history .  But Not DARLI it should be TACHIBANA OKYU or GENJURO
rip SF6
In a world where muscly guys and 90s babes are toned down, covered up, or retconned out, such as dragon ball super, Soul Calibur, or Hello Nurse, 1 series will have the Chutzpa, to have Manly Alpha Males and curvy thicc chicks as characters! Defying the malcontent whining of those who don't play video games! This Summer! The Seeds of the Future, Lie Buried in the Past! As 1 company, will give players what they want, and what has been denied, for too long: Winners! KOF 15! Shatter ALL Expectations!
If Obari Sensei's doing the Animation I want to see a Laocorn Team with Panni,Hauer, and Jamin and Laocorn as a Boss, A Sulia Team with Shaia and Karin from Gowcaizer as members, A Gowcaizer team with Brider and Hellstinger and Gowcaizer.
samurai    IROHA
So for those who don't know better. In a way Haomaru did meet with Mai before.  If you played through an ending with Haomaru on the very first game, as I did long ago on the ye ol SNES, they used a sprite that was a blatant slight re color of Mai Shiranui as who he had a bout with. That's the point of reference they're honoring with the quote of him meeting her again.  It was likely one of her ancestors if they've bothered placing it into more formal lore.
Tengo un sentimiento encontrado, Haomaru y Nakoruru me parecen bien pero con Darli es la que tengo problema. No esta pero me esperaba cualquier otra chica de la saga Samurai Shodown, como Saya Shiki o Iroha.
I'm still waiting for them to bring back Shion as DLC
look who's more bouncier? ✨
No.
Darli dagger parece un personaje de Monster hunter
WTF la nakoruru se parece a la chilindrina wachana XD jsjss 😂😂

Hey SNK, can American Sports Team: Heavy D!, Lucky Glauber and Brian Battler fight on in KOF XV 🇺🇸
I feel like SNK abandoned us. Feels like they didn’t even try to fix matchmaking after 9 months
SNK, please I want this "KOF 15" to be the last "King Of Fighters" & also add "orochi iori", "orochi Leona", "kusanagi", "God orochi", goenitz, "Dark Ash", "orochi SAIKI", "Duke (from "KOF MAXIMUM IMPACT"), Jiavatman (from "KOF MAXIMUM IMPACT"), Lien Neville (From "KOF MAXIMUM IMPACT"), ninon beart From "Maximum impact", minong beart from "MAXIMUM IMPACT",, also i want guess characters like "Ryu", "chunli" & "guile"

O.k. SNK Can we have MR. Karate as a character in KOF XV..?
People complaining and arguing about Darli because "muh character depth" and "muh historical accuracy" No. To hell with that. I like to keep it simple. I receive tomboy tiddies, you receive my approval.
World heroes please!!! I WANNA SEE HANZOU AND FUMMA!!!!!
Kof 15 is a true man's game.
Snk, please, in STEAM online game of KOF XV, IS A BUG, WHEN I WON, MY RIVAL GET OUT OF THE GAME, AND MY VICTORY DOENT COUNT...

Happy Birthday Nakoruru💗🎂
0:29 Holy Crap! He remembers that they fought eachother in Capcom vs SNK 2! :D
Snk mfs why you guys didn't put kof 2012 multiplayer online mode for Android devices.And since then you guys haven't released a normal classic kof fighting games for Android .
Now we want to see mizuki in kof!
Not gonna lie, I actually really like it. But despite all of these, I feel like there's something missing.     TEAM AMERICAN SPORTS!!! (Heavy D!, Brian Battler & Lucky Glauber) Make it happen SNK!!! We would really love to see them in a 3D design
Need SNK Samurai Showdown vs Souls Calibur instead.  Sorry it's not suit for this crossover.
Nakoruru and darli are kinda lame. Genjuro and Ukyo should’ve made the cut
Ok so I noticed this in the trailer. In the venue stage there are 2 ring girls in the background. I downloaded the dlc and now they just gone. Out of existence. Was it even added in the background? Also same thing with the chick on the back of the truck in the beach stage.
Ironically Hoahmaru probably did better in this one rather than he's originally in
Too bad I'm the only European player on Xbox looking for online fights.. Either that, or your matchmaking is truly broken 😅
It would be perfect if they included Ukyo
Very stupid characters. I want my hinako, kasumi, foxy, mature, vice!
最高だね！
The Team we have been waiting for  really like the Samurai Spirits reference between Haohmaru and Mai 😙👌🏾
Now I want "maximum impact" characters for "KOF XV"
オールドファンからすると ナンカチャウネンナー
It's too bad this game is completely ruined by 1 button auto combos that you can't remove in options. It's forced in.
HORRÍVEL
1:42
Team coward.
My expectations are shattered but no kim yet 😪
Ugly cartoon graphics...
I love the interaction between Haohmaru and Mai- that is a deep cut reference for long time Samurai Shodown fans
Love Nakoruru and glad they brought her back , she is my second to mai shiranui
I really hope their costum different version form samurai showdown,they outfit so boring,why not make present day version looking??? (I hope appearance not same in every series like Soul Calibur)
KOF 15 !!!
❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😁😁😁
Can’t wait to use these characters !
I can’t wait to use team Sumurai . They have special powers. New DLC characters coming !
Lin snk dont forget your ninja of kof 2000
el equipo que nadie estaba esperando ni nadie pidió llegó. Hubiesen traido algo de world heroes o a los psico soldiers bao, kensou y momoko. Inclusive a los Hizoku : lin, ron y duolong.  Malas decisiones snk, consulta con un plot a tus fans de siempre
nakoruru's face so pretty ~great job
Darli Dagger??? OMG  Classics we want classics   Shet
I remember playing with Nakoruru in KOF 95 (for the first gameboy). My favorite character is back.
つなみも追加される日が来るといいのですがね。
Nice SnK, but why Darling?  Só mamy classic character who looks like samurai but her hehehe

Serious question: How did Samurai Showdown characters become part of KoF, aren't they from the past? Don't know how it happened, but given they are a part of Kof now, I'd love to see Basara and/or Freeman
snk is completed out of touch . they might as well bring metal slugs characters to ruin KOF series further.  changes the title to SNK all stars
What a waste of character slots. I hope this is the last KOF.
1:41 vamos!!! SNK sigue sexualizando a sus chicas. Lo amo! No como Mortal Kombat que decidió dar un paso atras con eso...
どうせならリムルル来て欲しかった
so...one hit kill then..I don't see Terry can block a heavy swing with his arm.
Please put Moe Habana from KOF EX as DLC for Season 2.
I can see a Mitsurugi Mod for Haohmaru.
NERF KROHNEN when? its like `97 orochi iori pickable in rankeds, the nerf is taking way way tooooooo loooong

I'm trying to remember when was the time where I started to hate anime and japanese things. I mean, when I descover anime back to the 90's it was the best thing I could ever seen. Movies like Akira and Ghost in the Shell, and KOF at videogames had a dark atmosphere. Since 10 years ago, I started to hate all anime things because they are different now, is all made for otakus. The japanes talk, the screaming, all ridiculous and stupi.d. Even the characters drawning. Look for example Spike from Cowboy Bebop against today's anime. Everything is lost now, mediocre draws, no detail in background, all girls turned in to "waifus" and those girl talk like they have mental retard. AGGGhhh!!

I noticed a lot of people talking why do they have swords and fighting unarmed characters.... Well Whip literally empties her pistol on enemies on the ground. Maxima's vapor cannon isn't actually a vapor but more like a freaking shotgun. Never mind his chest laser.  Good ol Yamazaki has being using knives (in reality that is a size of a machete given how large he is) for as long as I can remember. Never mind Leona's explosive earrings or where she/heidern literally shoves a C4 in you and detonates it. How about K9999 and his blaster shotgun?  KOF in universe is no holds barred, anyone can enter, even if they use weapons (similarly to MK but less gore).  Ironically the only person who takes offence to weapon users is the evil Kusangi while everyone else pretty much accepts it.  I mean when you have folks like Takuma that can deflect a satellite death beam that can nuke a city, everything else seems like small potatoes.
dont get me wrong but i was hoping for years for more characters from art of fighting like john mickey lee etc, team samurai doesnt belong in this series
都拿著刀，這樣好嗎…… 哈哈哈
Me encanta samurai shodown, pero por que meter estos personajes en un king of fighters? Me hubiera gustado más ver al team korea original con Kim, Chang y Choi, o personajes casi olvidados como Brian Battler, Lucky Glauber o heavy d, hay muchísimos personajes que me hubieran gustado más en un kof que los de samurai shodown
Haohmaru did meet mai from samurai showdown 1 ending
Now I start to imagine if Samurai Spirits series got the same/similar combo system as KOF series does...
no shingo!? 😴😴😴😴
estos DLC debieron ser para nuevos personajes o personajes olvidados de otras entregas como MI o EX que desperdicio de lugares con personajes que no tienen que estar en KOF
チーム外道：不知火幻庵、アースクエイク、妖怪腐れ外道 も是非！
the reason why i said dont ever cross with capcom again because  did you see how bad capcom treated your snk character? they limit snk characters moves and combos. capcom treated snk character like garbage. that is why snk my fine favorite team. just be your selfs you dont need capcom to help you. you dont need them. capcom is garbage anyway. look at capcom vs snk for me i find it garbage but for SVC chaos its good. snk made capcom character look good. street fighter 6 sucks
It should be haomaru, nakoruru and shiki or iroha.
Siempre es un placer ver a mi querida Mai Shiranui y si no fuera porque no usa armas de fuego creería que Dolores es la versión afro de Bayonetta.
Sería mejor Rimu ruru

ダーリー、Bジェニー、ヴァネッサでお酒大好きチーム作れる！(笑)
철권8 보고 이거 보니 참담하네 ㅠ_ㅠ
I wish they'd stop using Nakoruru for the KOF crossovers...  SNK should use Kibagami Genjuro more
Nakoruru Music💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Darli Dagger looks very interesting
Now we want Alternative costumes for every KOF character in next KOF 15 DLC season 2 and New stages with every new team or members in next KOF 15 DLC season 2 so we hope our expectations not sheltered

I love all vs games but my primary vs game is SF. For me KoF have harder comand inputs and I think that what deter noobs from picking this game. The 1/2 circles and 1/2 circles pluse a 1/4 circle move is hard to do compared to 1/4 circles or double 1/4 circles.   I like this game a lot and did get good at it, but the learning curve is not easy. SF in the other hand implement what Capcom knows best. Easy to learn hard to master. I remember back in 90's a Capcom official said that Capcom always have this method in creating all their games (easy to learn hard to master) and that's what makes them more popular.  I am not saying KoF is 2nd best. Far from it, it has its huge fanbase and honestly I enjoy watching its tournaments more than SF because I know how hard it is to pull off those combos 1st hand.  But I think its a bit harder for noobs than SF. I do wish it was easier but without compromising what makes it great, so I really can't think on how to do that.
않이 대놓고 날붙이를 들고오네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Que equipo más feo. El DLC más feo de la historia.
Can we have RAGE OF THE DRAGONS  team as DLC in KOF XV..?
Can we have THE LAST BLADE  characters team as DLC in KOF XV..?
Falta la sangre!!
Está ficando cada vez melhor.
Am i the only one having Guilty Gear vibes with Darli?
Love the Capcom vs SnK 2 reference. We need a remaster Capcom & SNK
Wow! Darli Dagger looks sick!!!
Cant wait for this
Frickin sweet, SNK.
DARLI DAGGER!!!!!! 🥰😍😘
Es increíble la cantidad de peleadores y series de juegos de pelea que tiene snk y pensar que todavía faltan personajes de waku waku 7, galaxy fight, agressor, wolrd héroes , etc
more one
Such a better design than those gnome-like bodies from Samurai Shodown 2019.
Apparently, team Samurai Shodown was going to be part of '95 and '96.
Great trailer
that's not fair, they all have weapons.
Ni punto de comparación solo hay que ver el triler de sf6 el escenario de dalshim con tanto detalle y los personajes, snk un esfuerzo extra no vendría mal...
Esse combo do Haomaru me lembrou muito um combo dele que eu fazia no Capcom x SNK 2 no Dreamcast. E essa música da Nakoruru foi uma grata surpresa e viagem ao passado 😌
Snk please add kensou and hinako in the game, and nice trailer.
Massa
Looks absolutely terrible. The graphics, the booba design, the hamfisted announcer... just how?!  Animation is decent, that's it.  Shatter expectations my ass.
Nakoruru is back
Thank God Nakoruru sounds normal and not like a little girl unlike Athena or Kula
With Darli Dagger in the game, I can finally decide on what my 3rd character will be alongside my other KoF mains Iori & Leona! Darli's my SamSho main, so having her, Leona & my Garou main B. Jenet means I can also make a team of mains from 3 different games all together!
なんで三人目ダガーなんだろうなぁ。そこは幻十郎か夜叉丸だろって思うんだが・・・
0:48 All the OG Samsho players (who roll with the "baddies") had an overwhelming urge to hit the character select screen and search for Genjuro 🎴

Wow!!!
Hi. Daily Life Style Channel ❤💙💚💜
비살상...? 무기금지 룰..?ㅋㅋㅋ
Nako’s theme 👌🏼👌🏼
Polémico digo, ellos pelean con espadas cuando los otros luchadores pelean sin armas 😐y en vez de Darli hubieran puesto a Galford o a Charlotte digo, son personajes clásicos de la serie en cambio Darli debuto en el Samurai Shodown del 2018 para PS4. Curioso que Haohmaru se acuerda de Mai de cuando participaron en Capcom vs SNK 2 y Neo Geo Battle Coliseum pero ella, no se acuerda de el
Team Metal Slug required :(
DLCで安倍晋三きたら買うわ
kibagami genjuro.......
噬魂隊
Please, SNK: Ninja Masters, Kizuna Encounter, World Warriors, The Last Blade too!
I would prefer kuroko instead of nakoruru
That's so cool!
Trash.. No way
OP to the max!!
Can we get Oswald please? 🙏
Donde esta orochi snk???!?!!
Oh...no....👎 Team samurai doesn't fit the world for The King Of Fighter
Holy shit the prediction came true
Please, a DLC with Galford!!!
How the F... Darli dagger won between a lot of better samurai characters
いや時代違いすぎるし刃物使わせちゃアカンやろ。
SNK should really stop with these DLC characters. Where's the f'ing content?
いや、死ぬて。
I would rather have a classic character like Charlotte instead of this 3rd one but better than nothing.
Can you imagine Darli and Dolores having a conversation with each other, it kinda weird having a team with weapons but kinda cool at the same time
HAOMARU!!!
Totally doesn't fit at all and took up the 3 spaces of way better options but oooookay
It kills me how there are still people that don't understand the point behind Darli's character. She's a shipbuilder. Shipbuilding was incredibly important before the advent of flight. Her inclusion in SamSho 2019 was making point about something important to the time period that wasn't represented in the series before. Just like Mina in SamSho5 representing archery and Andrew in SamSho6 representing the rifleman. Shipbuilding, bows, and guns were all big parts of Japan's history.
Le pusieron mas empeño a las animaciones de los movimientos de este team, qué a todos los demas luchadores, Sigo esperando el team de Kim, Juhn Hun, may lee
I want, I NEED to go play any samurai shodown as soon as the video ends 😎😎😎
Nakoruru❤
UwU
가슴이 웅장해진다
Wow, Team Samurai Haohmaru, Nakoruru, Darli Dagger back for KOF 15 love it 😱😱🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
OMG, so that means we have a probability to Metal Slug Team come up 🤔😁😁😁😁
This is cool still hoping that Gaidel makes a playable debut
They should have put Charlotte instead of Daggi.
Kind of weak, even as a samsho fan.
Wee need another guest team. Team Capcom?
This may bring me back. I didn't care for the oorchi dlc.
最後が黒ちゃんなのは、 BLMの影響か？ シャルロットとかの方が良かった。
I don't know why but I get the dreaded feeling that this team might be busted.
Haomaru and Nakoruru I can understand, but the other? so many older and iconic chars to choose from...
this has to be the most combo happy samsho characters... :)
Qual o nome da música do fim do vídeo? AAAAAA que lindo que ficou! 😍
Why Darli? Should have been Galford or Ukyo. Oh well.
Os combos fluíram, e o resto da jogabilidade ficou de surpresa.🤔
None of the three characters are actual samurai.
SHINGO, GORU DAIMON, SAISYU KUSANAGI
KIM, CHOI, CHNAG
I wish that they release the bare handed version instead of the armed one. Looks scary when seeing they slash KoF characters with their blades
Me waiting to shingo
Please, Team Maximum Impact for the next DLC. The brothers Alba and Soiree Meira and Lien Neville need to come back.
KOF's soul no longer exists 🙃🙃🙃🙃
Geese said you cannot escape from death, now it is time to embrace death!
Cross play when ? Takes so long to find match on pc
Good grafix
❤️Nakoruru ❤️
チーム侍・・・侍は1人しかいないという(笑) もともと侍スピリッツ自体が侍が数えるほどしかいないんだけどね
Will Love Heart and Mui Mui be referenced at the very least?
I'll probably only buy this now for Darli, always avoided KOF since I could never find a character I'd actually like or want to use other than Vanessa.  That and I'm all for the dark skin waifus.
The company needs to check their social media platforms more (including the YT comment section). No persons in large numbers asked for these SS characters to be added
もうマジになんでもありかよ。笑
CARALHO!!! CURTI DEMAAAAAIS
大雜燴
Awesome! And they come out on my birthday!
最後にこれ？あり得んやろー 見事期待裏切ったなぁ。 アッシュ編のラスボス オロチ ゲーニッツ 辺りが出たら、超絶神作に仕上がったのになぁ。 残念すぎる
Its good to have a cross game team. Love it even if i prefer kof characters in général because i dont play samsho which is à good game for sûre. I think in this game we really need stages to have iur expectations really SHATTERED lol

I love this.
If you dont fix matchmaking before sf6 launch  players wont be back to play kofxv .such a great game with no playerbase.
おお～ええやん 面白そう
帶刀犯規
weapons VS bare hands...how dare you!!!
Yamazaki: ... ¿Y mi cuchillo?
Objections! They are wielding BIG swords (weapons).
What's the use... they never fixed the online, game is dead now.
Wauuuuuu pero que increíble 🤩me encanta este nuevo equipo, que bueno que volvió aparecer Nakoruru😀aunque me pregunto que explicación dara SNK con las ausencias de Love Heart y Mui Mui, ya que ellas fueron las compañeras de Nakoruru en el KOF 14, ya veremos en el final de este equipo samurai
전훈 김갑환 추가해줘
Armas letales en un juego de peleas en kof 15 🙃🙃😨😵🤑
now I will just wait for the trailer for my son Shingo and Kim
Ah~! I love the interactions for each of them... very very apt~!
Now it needs the World Heroes team.
Más escenarios y skins.... Quiero mi skin de tizoc y Ramón lucha libre.
😀😀😀👍
I'll be happy if snk put ninon beart, lien Neville and luise meyrink. These character seems to be forgotten by many people
中原麻衣てairのヒロインの子役のひとだっけ？金髪の
Does this game have survival mode?
不知火舞を誰とまちがったのか？まかさ、バイケン？？
while we expected a samurai team since KOF 95 Im not found to the idea of sharp weapons on this kind of fighting games, feels odd
SHATTERED MY EXPECTATIONS as always!!!
Adoro os personagens de Samurai Shodow; mas eu acho que eles na KOF  é um pouco nada a ver.
CAN WE GET CAPTAIN KIDD OR SOME WORLD HEROS CHARACTERS PLEASE?!
Embrace Super Cancel.
格鬥比賽拿刀？
Whoa the SamSho Characters look amazing! Can the U.S Sports Team PLEASE  BE NEXT 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Ojalá pusieran más trajes y escenarios clásicos,  como el salón SNK de Kof 95, o el templo de KOF 98, o el Aeropuerto de KOF 99
単体で売ってもらえないですか？　チームだと高すぎて
サムスピキャラがコンボしてると違和感しかないw
My feelings on Samurai Shodown characters in KOF, in a nutshell.  Terry: You were born in the 18th century? You're ANCIENT! Haohmaru: Big deal, so are you.
RIP.. USA Team.. Takuma.. Eiji.. Lin.. etc
Awesome trailer. Also, SamSho 2019 is getting rollback netcode next spring for those who don't know.
MY EXPECTATIONS ARE SHATTERED IN THE BEST WAY!
Looks so good.  I totally prefer the Japanese vocal dub.  :-)
LETS GO SNK! SAMURAI SHODOWN THE ORIGINAL STREETFIGHTER KILLER!
ummm i prefer other character from others not another from snk. maybe guilty gears or asura buster but definitely not from capcom. any character but no capcom. you dont want garbage capcom and i dont want to see another cap vs snk. i feel normal i feel just so plain you know. its not really that turn on for most people some mite like it but most wouldnt because. its just another snk character. its ok but noy amusing its not exciting enough
I would switch Darli Dagger for Ukyo or Hanzo.
Adoro Samurai, mas não tem nada a ver com KOF :(
American Sports Team pleeeeeeeeeeease
"GIGA DRILL BREAK!!!" - Darli
还是不太习惯一堆人拿武器打拳皇
You can't tell me they didn't see Thorgi's Arcade's CvS video for the SamSho team
Me encanta éste equipo, aunque extraño un poco la alineación anterior del Another World Team[Nakoruru, -Mui Mui- Love Heart] menos a Mui-Mui si qué no me agradaba ella.  Tal vez si este equipo hubiese sido [Nakoruru, Galford y Darli Dagger] o sino también [Nakoruru, Haohmaru y Galford] no me quejaba para nada. Aunque en verdad ya hacía falta un personaje cómo Darli Dagger qué en sus ataques manipula la hidroquinesis y lamentablemente aún SNK no agrega a Gaidel(padre de Leona, cual es Hakketsu) qué en teoría éste sería el 1er personaje en manipular el agua dentro de KOF.
Expectation was shattered
Looks great, but why the don,t add more stages.  Its boring to have the same ones, they keep adding DLC characters but no stage.  Imagine a Garou Stage, a Samurai Sh stage, the old Orochi Boss stage.  Its just a shame
全員逆刃刀かな？
Love that they brought this team. But I think when they bring Kim Kaphwan back he should be on a team with his sons Kim Jae Hoon and Kim Dong Hwan. That would be an epic team! There's already 3 characters from Garou
Seem unfair, fight between weapons and empty-handed 🙂
0:29　多分初サムに舞が登場してたからそれがネタかな？
Rip kof 15
覇王丸とナコルルまではまだ分かるけど、なぜダーリィ？
Kim 🥋
Holy crap, they all look fantastic!
PATCH of da BLACK TITTIES!!!!
It's fun that they removed 'violent' weapons from some characters like Yamazaki's knife or Whip's gun to make it more 'friendly' (not to mention some of the ridiculous endings with a massive evil characters revived) and now we have an entire team that can cut you in half or stab to death... 🤣
We finally got to know the release date
Boobs too big.
Why not Galford instead of Darli?
Oh right! next week Season 1 of KOFXV is finally coming to a close, great trailer and good job SNK (as always of course), hmm i wonder what was that exchange between Haohmaru and Mai, because i get the ones between Nakoruru with Dolores and Darli with Jenet but that one i didn't get it at all, maybe a reference from a previous game that i don't remember...anyways, i suppose that i will find my answer next week, and from then, TO THE SECOND SEASON NEXT YEAR!
Extremely Awesome
えっ、ナコルルってそんなイントーネーションだったの？？
Haohmaru (Daiki Nakamura) Mai Shiranui (Ami Koshimizu)  Hrm, Bluster Kong. Don't tell me you didn't get to see Nadja Applefield because you were always in a Barrel Factory all day, eh?
覇王丸ずっと声変わらないの感動してる
I'm still waiting for the American Sports Team!!!!!!
Haoh talking to mai is referencing haohmaru's ending in the first samsho game and mai is a descendant of gen-an Nice hearing nakoruru's theme again
FUCK 3D
im all here for nakoruru
Samurai Shodown 2 is my favorite SNK game of all time, so it's nice to see some characters from the series appear in more games as bonus characters. An unfair advantage of swords though. ;)
SNK CAN WE GET "KOF MAXIMUM IMPACT" TEAM FOR "KOF XV"??, PLEASE SNK, I WANT LIEN NEVILLE, NINON BEART, MIGNON BEART AS "TEAM MAXIMUM IMPACT" FOR "KOF XV"???, PLEASE SNK, SHATTER MY EXPECTATIONS WITH A "MAXIMUM IMPACT TEAM" FOR "KOF XV"
Guess a team of Chizuru, Dolores, and Nakoruru will be a nice one
Trio desnecessário.
Best characters in this game.
es por primera vez que esta Haohmaru en Kof XV
Ya es hora de un DLC del NESTS BOSS TEAM Y SU ESCENARIO. Estara super mamalon. señores
Wish they had Galford but Haohmaru and Nakoruru are the faces and Darcy Dagger's the new hotness.
Hot damn, can we talk about how great Haohmaru's sword looks?
Eu quero ver a Nakoruru voando com a Mamahaha.
彼らが彼女の肌を暗くしたことを嬉しく思います！ あなたのゲームから黒人を排除するのは良くありません。 結局のところ、それらはあなたのライフスタイルに積極的に貢献していませんか?
覇王丸の斬鉄閃を生身でガードしても、普通に体ぶった斬られそうw
Pongan los clásicos skins de los peleadores de kof de los años 90s y los 2000.
They look extremely overpowered! Let's hope I'm wrong but those combos looked brutal
Nakoruru. 😍
Nakoruru just pulled a Giga Drill Break...lol! I'm totally yelling that if I ever land that level 3.
we all wait the king of fighters xv ultimate edition with all dlc soon in 2024 yes or yes
Crew: "We should add Genjuro this time." Director:" Don't we have dark skin characters? Put those instead. Especially female." Crew:" But Genjuro is important role to represent Samurai Showdown. We've skip him for long~!" Drector:" I don't care about the how story or concept should go. We have to make the audience think we are non-racist and non-sexist. Didn't you see that Kimberly from SF6?                  Those kind of characters are [demanded] in western cultures now~disobey, you're fired." Crew:" Those were their ideas, these Fans have been asking Genjuro to be in KOF for long and adding  Darli just because she's woman and her skin color is way too political. Director:" You're fired." (Gunshot~)  Director:" Yep, You're FIRED~"
@ 2:34 I'm pretty sure Ralf Jones is dead! 🤣
Cloth physics, looks like they are preparing for Kim to come next
Like this.  Excited sure.  Wish thered be a team DOA or team Tekken as a surprise since they colabed with them.
alguien mas, sentira el festival de quejas por que el team samurai usan espadas o armas?  nada mal el team samurai
Iroha please & Mina!
That interaction between Haohmaru and Mai is a nostalgia from SamSho 1. I do remember him challenging Mai's ancestor that time
Me gustaría ver a Genjuro en de nuevo como en SvsC Chaos
0:29　0:33その人違いなので有る。
0:34 did Haohmaru mistake Mai for someone
We need team metal slug ASAP!
Are swords even allowed cause there’s gonna be bloodshed
Por favor SNK, agrega trajes alternativos a los personajes que hasta hora solamente tienen un traje, de preferencia que sean trajes nostálgicos para los personajes clásicos y si no es mucho pedir. Pon a los personajes de Metal Slug cómo personajes jugables, por favor si, porque si se pudo poner un Team Samurai para The King of Fighters XV; entonces porque que no un Team Metal Slug!.
Just tried SamSho 2019 yesterday and with how that game is, it's so bizarre to see these three do all these combos now lmao
They need to rebalance the characters.
Is KOF XV the fighting game with the most protagonists in the roster? We already have 8 protagonists in the game! Kyo Kusanagi, K' Dash, Ash Crimson, Shun'ei, Terry Bogard, Ryo Sakazaki, Rock Howard and Haohmaru! I find this awesome. I love them all! 🐿️😍✨❤
Nice, more hot big titty women 😍😍😍
Cara, eu amo Samurai Shodown! Ficou tudo incrível! E o tema deles no game provavelmente será esse que toca no trecho que mostra a Darli Dagger inicialmente. Lindo demais, de verdade! Apaixonado por esse time! Mal posso esperar para as ver as gameplays. Não posso jogar, mas sempre posso apreciar! 🐿️😍✨❤
Estranho pra mim isso, ninguém se corta?
terrible
Love it, because i aint buying samsho lol
Iroha would have sold me. Too bad. I’ll stick to samsho then. Iroha vs mai would have been epic  though.
Why not Charlotte, God?
Weird they choose Darli instead of say Genjuro, Hanzo or Galford
Hyped!!!! 😱😱😱
A saga e sobre multiverso mesmo (que ta na moda) mas poderia ser um time mais inspirado, tipo 1 cjar de cada jogo da snk
Not even a re design, i like that they are here but these are the same reused models with no re skin or anything from Samsho
Ohh lord nako is back 😫
Hubiese preferido un team world héroes, no le encuentro sentido a enfrentar samurais con peleadores callejeros de kof , la verdad no encajan
I was right,nothing compared to the original game,these in kof are good compared to samurai shodown wich is slooooooow.Please Iori and Leona riot please please please,also Maximum Impact team.
Ué, cadê o próximo boss challenge desse jogo, será que não vai ter? Eu ouvir dizer que a Snk ia colocar o Goenitz como o próximo boss challenge, até agora nada.
Dónde está Charlotte!!!!!???????
Gostei muito.Os especiais ficaram bem legais.
rushes the cross play pls, i have to be all they just to play a few matches in online :(
Amazing team I want to see Hotaru,May Lee and Kasumi back❤️❤️
They look amazing! But snk can we pls get some new stages eventually? I wouldn't mind if you took some from kof14 I just want more stages
Gotta get back! Back to the past! Team Samurai!
Puta madre Marge ya saquen al Kim
They need to come with new stages!
So are they confirming that Haohmaru fought Mai's ancestor in his SS1 ending?  Minor complain, but I wish the team would've been call "Team Samurai Shodown" instead of "Team Samurai".
ライノックスやん
hearing that Nakoruru theme pulls strings in my ❤️
Wow just wow
Regresan los Mamahasos !!!
Time Samurai... Sem Showdown no nome!!!
1:56 Ok that was pretty cool
And where is ukyo tachbana???
finally, a reason to play again
Love Samurai Showdown but it ain't exactly fair if every member on this team is carrying a weapon.
뭔 시발 사쇼 나오고 지랄
DOPE!
Metal slug needs love snk
Congrats! God bless your family
I know nakoruru is pretty popular... but man for some reason i have always despise her, totally hate her from the very beginning in Samurai Shodown. Anyways, i´m really excited for haomaru and darly.
I Miss you... Galford... :) Nice Trailer BTW
They all look so good, especially Darli!! Curious what Mai's connection to Haohmaru is...
Where kim? :(
Wow... Just WOW. YOU ARE DOING AN AMAZING JOB. keep up the good work and support on KOF15 and keep adding more freebies and content (and playable old bosses too 😁😁🙏)
OMG Andy's been kukcd
Darli is so fucking cool.
Kof xv o pai te ama !
That voice announcement on Haohmaru, daaaaamn
ficou muito bom, mais eu ainda estou esperando GOENITZ É OROCHI por favor SNK traz eles pra gente por favor 😃😃😃😁😁👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍
why does this remind me of cvs2.
So, tell me why Yamazaki couldn't have his knife again?
Darli Dager y B. Jenet quieren ser amigas piratas y son las Waifus de KOFXV favoritas 😍😍😍
So no John Crawley then?
I hope to see an interaction between Haoh and Iori...or at least a witty winquote...
Still waiting on the sports team
(0:29) - Depois de 29 anos, o reencontro.  Será que o Capitão América vai pegar essa referência?
For ****'s sake, ref!!! They have weapons! It's not against the rules??? Fine, let's get the Metal Slug team in here to even out the odds!!!
I would rather have Kyoshiro, Amakuza or Hanzo tagging along with Haohmaru and Nakoruru.
Now I need that game. 😳.
This need moar decapitations
my only beef is that the dlc teams doesn't have their own stages. other than that , i am loving kof 15
Wow. Next team that we will see will either be kim and his sons....... Or shingo and some other people!
ver a nakoruru me lleno de mucha ternura y dio ganitas de llorar, quizá fue por su melodía q es muy linda
Yashamaru>DD
Damn they made em look siiiiiiiiick
mortal kombat ?
Darli looks so cool
Team Samurai? To be released on October 4th?? This will be promising 😌😌😌😌😌
man darli's weapon type is so fucking cool
0:33 is that the reference to Haohmaru meeting a Mai duplicate/look alike in one of his old games? Cause that's frigging awesome
Now let's put Terry on Samsho 🤢🤮I'll save my money for the next DLC Thank you.
Ninja teans; Eiji Kisaragui Lin Duo Lon  Malin hokutomaru  SNK forgot Lin, he is one of the champions of the kof 2001 tournament!
Don't forget Nintendo Switch? 🥺🥺🥺
ta ficou foda demais snk....  mas quando vamos ver o time do the last blade no kof15 ? !
WOO HOO
No se pero los especiales como que se ven medio lentos de los 3 personajes o es mi imaginación?
They brought back "Banquet of Nature", Nakoruru's theme from SS1, NICE!
They will be released on October 4th, my birthday.
Pronto SNK, já apresentou os participantes especiais, agora vamos pra Goenitz, Shingo e Kim pfvr.
0:30 don't know why I thought he was talking to Baiken.
They look pretty good, I'm excited!
POGGERS
Nakoruru es como la Athena del Samurai 🤣
Fix your fucking matchmaking.
Rezando pra não ter um time da Capcom, porque se colocarem um time com personagens de Street Fighter, do jeito que tá o Street 6 os personagens vão sofrer um Downgrade absurdo com esses gráficos da KOF 15.
wow they drop just before my birthday
They look good!!!
Why do I get the feeling that Hoahmaru interaction could be hinting that he might have had a thing for one of Mai’s ancestors?  That or it would be ironic to find out if Mai could be fighting her great (not sure how many greats) grandfather…
Lol SNK wasted so much time making a trailer this big cuz they only needed to show Haohmaru face to make me pay🤣
Can we have  MELTY BLOOD TYPE LUMINA Characters as DLC in KOF XV...?
Get ready for BIG damage!
See You Next Tuesday
God darli's climax is so brutal I never get tired of seeing it
Is it just me or does Darli look faster?
World Heroes Team with Hanzou/Fumma, Janne and Rasputin (or Mudman) will be better and by the way put this saga again in the map.
I wish I was Ralf 🥰
What a game.
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
It's just sad the community killed this game. Suddenly when everyone online is clark grab spamming and just mashing knowledge checks the player count dies. I wonder why.
Chale yo quería a Galford nomas por su ship con Nakoruru
Are the servers still fucked up?
Ficou legal demais, mas é estranho sem o sangue
なかなかいいね。 でも早くキムの動いてるとこみたい
haohmaru is in desperate need of a beard snk, make it happen please... 🧔🏻
Que apelação a Darli 99!
What about The Last Blade characters?
So AWESOME, I LOVE IT
KOF
no balance patch?
10/10 trailer, I love the subtle yet noticeable improvements on facial animations. I hope more people try SamSho, it's a very unique fighting game.
ONLY METAL SLUG PLEASE!!
Seeing Darli's saw blade hitting someone and not causing an absurd amount of blood to splash everywhere is throwing me off
Só eu achei a Darli periquituda?
very cool. 😎 they are coming so soon so I hope we can get Shingo sooner as well.
Meh. I still think this team looks out of place in KOF.
This is a big joke... I thought the last team would be a surprise... Really disappointed me
Venía tan bien y terminan rompiendo el juego con los pj rotos que sacan y sacan.
Holy Crap Ralf got minced and murdered XD
まさかのサムスピエンディングネタw
Incrível, a maior parte dos comentários negativos são de BR, a galera mente fechada viúva de 2002, só sabem reclamar...
can we count this as a start for a game called Battle colliseum and have a great crossover of SNK great characters? will be nice to have a sequel
Não gosto da ideia de personagens de épocas e estilos tão distintos no "KOF". Calma um pouco com isso, SNK.
Finally
Os personagens ficaram mto bons com a gameplay de KOF. Esse Climax da Nakoruru ta mto foda!  Que venham mais crossovers pela frente (metal slug, World Warriors, Capcom?)
Anybody know if the matchmaking is still a issue? I plan on buying the game this weekend but I don’t wanna blow the money if I’m not able to get a online match on Xbox
Come on give us kof characters. With all that oil money they surly can bring eiji back to life
Kof 98 is the best fighting game I ever played snk is so slept on I’m going to keep throwing money at them till they get the recognition they deserve
Probably the team I was least interested in but still looking great and looking forward to giving them a shot, especially Darli.
Dus Stupido!
💓🇯🇵🇧🇷🕹🎮😍😍😍😍
FIX MATCHMAKING
If this was Street Fighter they would have looked like shitty dlc Halloween costume skins that $9.99 a pop :P GOOD JOB SNK   I really doubt SFV will have any cross over Darkstalkers chracters but im like 9999% they will make shitty dark stalkers costumes
Hello SNK! It would be really cool to see SNK classics again! Neo Geo Battle Coliseum and Real Bout Dominated mind to win a new online version with Rollback for new platforms ps5, PC and especially on PS4 would be something sensational.🤞🇧🇷🇯🇵🤝
Hey bro you wanna brawl? "rips out a 5 feet long katana" Sure why not
Nakoruru is back to reign terror in the KOF universe. I heard she was busted in KOF XIV iirc
Now Kof Players will slash by samurai.. insane.. lol
lol.
They nailed with the team. Hope they finnaly add the matchmaking system to the game.
Wow! Nakoruru es tan genial!
Damn plz just plz make samurai team 2. With uyko skiki and jubei
awesome sauce
Kof wing really predicted Haohmaru lol
Like
Mamahaha
Dat Nakoruru theme hit me right in the feels man 😫😫😫
Must put on new characters debut
Wanna point it out that Darli is just in the game because of this stupid inclusion culture that makes no sense and because of that we lost a spot for a boring character. Bye.
Parabéns excelente trabalho.
Lame, lame, lame
Matchmaking is broken for 222 days, so who cares.
Team Samurai,thats awesome ⚔
Super cool! i love them!!
Team Samurai* *not actually Samurai but Ronin, priestess, and a pirate
Shiki > Darli
☠️
They’re killing it with characters, but I really wish each new team came with their own stage
can't wait to use these characters in its well functioning match making
Maybe they should integrate ALL of Samurai Shodown into KOF, maybe if Last Blade's Yuki's revived thanks to Verse, she may have to adapt to modern days.
Mature,vice please
Os 3 ficaram bons mas eu destaco a Nakoruru. Não é nem sombra do que ela é no KOF 14, aqui ela ta muito mais caprichada e bem feita, praticamente é a mesma Nakoruru do Samsho de 2019 portada pro KOF 15. Agora um detalhe interessante é esse dialogo do Haohmaru com a Mai claramente fazendo uma referencia e tanto ao final do Gen An no Samurai Shodown 2 onde aparece uma ninja do clã Shiranui com as mesmas vestimentas de combate, dando a entender que a roupa da Mai pode ser ate mesmo um manto passado de geração em geração. Enfim, agora é esperar o dia 4 não só por causa do time SamSho mas tambem pela expectativa do patch de balanceamento pra ver se da uma levantada no jogo pois o pessoal claramente ja esta de saco cheio de ver Krohnen, Kula, B Jenet, Yashiro e Rock nas FTs. Nerfar esses 5 ja é um grande passo pro jogo voltar a ter o minimo de hype.
Now...when we will see GENJURO
That samurai shodown game was a hard fail so this is kinda nice, makes sense
gooood is goood!!!
Excited to explore these characters and showcase what they can do!
いろはを参戦させろ！！
覇王丸と舞の掛け合いでまさかの初代邂逅ネタとは…(＠ｗ＠;)
Mah boy combed into heavy slash, let's go.
Imagine being a KOF fighter, arriving at the tournament with your preferred martial art and then a samurai with a katana and all walks in and challenges you.
Looking pretty much perfect
0:29 is a reference to Haomaru ending in  the first samurai showdown
I take it Haohmaru mistook Mai for Shiki.
Looking good
Yoshitora and genjuro :'(
Yes it’s finally happening team samurai is almost here in a king of fighters game.
Yes it’s finally happening team samurai is almost here in a king of fighters game.
USA sport team please 🙏
覇王丸の声優は中村さんか  カプエス2の時より渋さがなくなったというかフレンドリーな感じになった？
So did Haohmaru just reference the crossover games, or did I miss something with Mai
I wanted galford but its ok
¿Van a agregar algún parche para mejorar la AI del CPU? Algo así como la del KoF XIV.
Matchmaking fix when?
Que Épico este equipo la va a romper en el competitivo.
Playing a kof game with team samurai shodown on it will be something really special... Congrats, SNK!!! Keep it up 👊
¿De dónde viene la cita de Haohmaru a Mai? ¿Está haciendo referencia al Capcom vs SNK 2?
podiendo meter mas, meten a nakororu.
This made me realize...Mai could fit in as a SamSho invitee character, like Baiken did. The exchanges between her and Iroha would be quite a sight to behold
Muito bom 👏👏👏
Iroha chan please.....
So hyped for this team!! :D Also, I know nothing about Samurai Showdown lore but does Haomaru know an ancestor of Mai's?
What a wonderful trailer, i really enjoy their moveset , especially Darli, please give them a stage
Nice, but also lost opportunity to include Iroha, would have been b3st fanservice
Love for SNK and more SUPPORT to KOF15!!! \*A*/
Centenas de personagens da franquia kof, e a SNK me traz porcaria de Samurai 🙄 pqp
lol so haohmaru loses super DP and gains super generic issen super, come on snk, do you even know you own character
Nice trailer but sad that I can't play the game I bought on release because matchmaking is broke
Finalmente a SNK realiza seu intento de ter um Time SS no KoF, após 28 anos.  E preferia Ukyo no lugar da Darli mil vezes, seria o time SS definitivo!
Darli Dagger lookin like a Greatsword main out here
Okay, I was mostly looking forward to Nakoruru, but Darli looks freaking sick. Can’t wait to try them all out next week.
LOOKS HARD AS F
No blood?
Team Samurai! This team looks cool. Glad to see some Samsho characters are coming.👍😄
Nakoruru seems fine because she doesn't use a weapon.. idk about katanas and heavy swords in KoF
Its rick strowd time
kof xv season pass dlc single entries roster with shingo kim may lee adelheid shen kasumi & vice
Os cara não bota um stage novo, cobra moh caro pelos personagens... Vsf
Turned Mugen 👀
The hype is real
I still think it’s weird that Samurai Shodown characters are in this game. They kinda feel out of place.
Haomaru sem o Tenma Kuujinzan? Verdade isso produção? Considero uma jogada ousada, uma vez que, é raro a SNK colocar especiais "estilo capcom"(que consiste em uma versão repetitiva de um ataque classico ou uma combinação de 2 ou 3 ataques do leque do personagem), normalmente ela cria desenvolvimentos mais "originais" para certos ataques, mas para quem ela acaba fazendo um especial "estilo capcom", ela costuma manter e o Tenma Kuujinzan não passa de um Kogetsuzan multiplicado...  ...mas eu suspeito de uma coisa...  Justamente o Kogetsuzan nasceu como um especial "secundario" e ainda GRATUITO no Samsho2, pois o Haomaru tinha aquele outro especial que ele dava um corte de luz e esse gastava barra e nesse trailer, se mostrou presente ao lado de um novo especial...  ...então sera que o Tenma Kuujinzan vai estar presente como um especial gratuito?(mas com alguma outra condição diferenciada para uso) ...ou como um possivel SEGUNDO CLIMAX...
Estan fuera de lugar los personajes, se salen un poco de la tematica de kof, pero se agradece la incorporacion de nuevo contenido
This team is wild !!
I love the modernization of samurai spirits/shodown characters but there should not be place for blades or weapons of any kind in KOF sorry im old school since the 94.
0:32 god, what a good trailer for team samurai 😉
Wish Shiki was included
Top SNK. Poderia trazer também o Hattori Hanzo!!!!
Those that know me from my sam sho vids, im happy to do tutorials for these 3. This will be my true return to making content
I wonder if they added the protagonist of metal slug
Love the haohmaru samurai shodown 1 ending when he fights my reference
They feel so out of place using sharp weapons lol  Who cares I'm glad nakoruru is very different from 14
Darli looks SO GOOD! SamSho main I guess is my KoF main now?
oof those hitstops are amazing
2:49 There isn't 2022 months
Haohmaru:Mai!How is it going? Andy:Mai,who is that sword guy? Mai:Wh-what?We never met before! Haohmaru:Oh,never mind,I'm just her Rival.
Haohmaru looks super sick here definitely gonna play him when he comes out Hopefully with this patch I never have to look at a krohnen or yashiro again
Don't get me wrong, I do love Samurai Showdown but come on, they fight with swords and even the do deadly blows and fatalities, it's more "violent" to be in KOF... Like it doesn't make sense to me but I have to admit that I liked the trailer so definitely I am giving myself a chance. I always knew Darli would have a dialogue with B.Jenet. Wish a World of Heroes Team could have an opportunity too! And finally would like to see Shingo teaming up with Hinako and Kim 🙂
Too bad matchmaking doesn't work.
Haohmaru's interaction with Mai is the COOLEST reference I've ever since 🤣
Oh no goddamn not the dentist noises
Cadê o Kim , Choi e Chang ?
the characters gameplay transfered really well consider how polar opposite the games are, that might be the most fun version of Haohmaru ever, i was not that hyped when they were leaked and announced but now i will give my boi haoh a try for sure.
I'm seeing those cloth physics SNK ! GOOD JOB!
The Killers of Fighters
I need to see team USA and make a team maximum impact
Haha. Como eu esperava, vai ter intro do haomaru com a mai, referenciando o final dele no primeiro samsho. Adorei. Que venha a próxima fase. LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY. READY... GO!!!
I love samsho. But why the hell is there a samsho team ? It makes ZERO sense. Those characters CAN'T be alive.
XD at Haohmaru and Mai's conversation. Nice Mythology Gag SNK!
Please fix matchmaking
Darli looks so good in this game holy-  Amazing addition to both Sam Sho and now KOF
Na The king of fighters 94, estavam certos em não incluir o time samurai, infelizmente não vivemos em tempos de bom censo e por isso a samurai está na Kof.
Where is Shiki though? Wack next DLC please.
I hope the team samurai patch at least attempts to fix matchmaking. I have a bad feeling SNK is holding off on patching online until crossplay is completely ready. I greatly enjoy this game and even went to Evo to compete for the first time. If SNK has even some success with patching online MM with the Oct 4 patch, I will absolutely continue to buy character passes.
달리대거 꽤나 괜찮네.. 그런대 썰때마다 뭐가 자꾸 부스러기가 날라가는거지?
Nakoruru's theme makes me feel both happy and sad. So retro and I love it!!
SNK all stars is back!
That's not kof anymore
Team street fighter should be the next guest team
Put team members in the background during matches again!
Why not Ukyo or Genjuro?
My man Ukyo is getting left out again :,(
I dislike Shamsho characters using weapons. They had the chance to make better the no-weapon mode in Samsho characters. In that way, both games feels balanced. But Weapons versus Fists?.... Well... MK already did it...
KOF XV Pirates Team: *B.Jenet, Darli & Love Heart*
Whoever said weapons are not allowed in the KOF tournaments?
個人的にはメイ率いる美少女格闘チームとか、拳崇とか、鎮、柴舟、タクマ、真吾、キム率いる韓国チームか、デュオロン、シェン辺りが良いと思った
2 Things. I'm devastated that the progress from the PS4 version didn't move over to the PS5 :( And... When's Zarina & Sylvie? Come on now SNK! =)
Great callback to Haomaru's ending in the first SamSho for the snes!
Quero jogar com Haohmaru top demais mandou bem SNK ❤️
Next week?  I expected it later.  Expectation shattered.
absolutely stunning, great video
¿Soy el único al que le parece ridículo meter samurais que vivieron hace casi 200 años? Aunque eso si, tienen más carisma que los personajes nuevos que parecen payasos como el Sasuke con audífonos o el assasin creed que ataca con caca seca
Revivió el gaming
Amazing. I am loving the new/remixed lv3!  Nakoruru's Mamahaha is OP! 🤣
Time World Heroes 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Muito bom
So excited thank you snk for giving me back my bird bitch 🦅 ❤
This trailer make me wish that kof got blood sparks rather than a generic hit sparks but I get that most characters don't use weapons but a bit of blood on specific attacks would be nice. They seem having no problem porting particles from samsho so why not
Nakoruru it just only the one who brought animal into battle stage, feel like his animal like striker support only for him
Tkm SNK
Yo queria a Galford en vez de Darli
welcome too neo geo coliseum
literally only reason I'm gonna actually play KoF XV since release
Eita, Haomarão da massa
Team Samurai looks amazing 👏
SNK has taken the laziest route they could have in terms of the DLC teams, orochi team was 70% reused assists from their original versions with a 16 dollar price tag and now they’re just gonna reuse samsho models and animations. What a waste of team team slots
Yes yes and yes its brilliant this team dlc
Stupid nakururu again... why not genjuro or Anyone else
It's nice when Nakoruru return i like her sister Rimururu, plus Haohmaru partner, apprentice samurai, or guardian Shizumaru Hisame, and shadow side plus ninja friend Rera, Galford D. Weller and Poppy (Galford's dog) 🐺🐕‍🦺🐶🐕‍🦺🌭 probably soon with new Team on KOF xv
What if they did Team Guilty Gear
there's a lack of blood for their specials lol
We need Goenitz
デュオロンとか他に出すキャラいたと思いますけど 人選が残念です
Nakoruru is a little demon but Haohmaru looks like my kinda shit
Disappointed about those....
如果有橘右京跟蓋爾福特 招式應該會更棒 更華麗
Los personajes de Samurai son muy brutales para KOF. Se asocian más a MK
this is fuckin dope!
Samsho with actual combos and speed? This...this is what I've always wanted 😭🙏
Персона лёгкий босс байонета сыграю з удовольствием на нинтендо
I love that Haohmaru and Mai’s conversation  is referencing his SamSho 1 ending where he fights one of her ancestors.
Team Tekken next!
kinda sad, i was hoping samsho characters wud move a bit slower and less combo-ey to somehow represent samsho gameplay. they still look gud tho
😍😍😍😍👋🏽
Hermosa la banda sonora de Nakoruru :)
Quite surprised..
Excelente referência ao final do Haohmaru no primeiro Samurai Showdown!
Тони hawk красатуля пусть он добавляй синое ежыное правосудие у мультиверсус
I really think this is the BEST team trailer so far❤️❤️ I can't wait to play as them
Minha nossa que coisa caprichada! UMA OBRA DE ARTE! OBRIGADO SNK!
SNK you are not a company, YOU ARE TRUE ARTISTS! THANK YOU SO MUCH!
Awebin perros🔥🔥🔥🔥
No blood?
SNK are too godlike
Wasted character slots. LOL
Lololol haohmaru doing KOF combos 😂😂😂
Muito equivocado colocar personagens do Samurai Spirits no KoF. Além de estranho, estão ocupando vaga que poderia ser de outros personagens mais de acordo com o universo do jogo ou de edições anteriores. Não gostei.
ทำไมเก่งกว่าตอนอยู่ในซีรี่ตัวเองกันล่ะเนี่ย..ปล่อยของหรา..😑😑😑..
Darli and Jenet interacting is pure genius
It is not fair to fight with a bladed weapon. 🤣 To make this KOF XV perfect, a "Black belt demon team" would be needed: Jubei Yamada, Takuma Sakazaki and Goro Daimon.
Nice foreshadowing there using Ralf against Darli and not showing a Galactica Phantom v Darli Dagger Punch  clash
Holy shit I was not expecting SNK to reference Haomaru's ending from SS1!
Shattered our expectations and this is very good trailer and the team Samurai so now we wait and want special DLC stages for new season of DLC season 2 and wait for more alternative costumes for every character in KOF 15 so please SNK let make sure for next time alternative costumes and alternative stages should be in KOF 15
Water sword
0:22 OMG TERRY ROGER FROM 3 COUNT BOUT😍
Very cool!  And now, we want a World Heroes Team with Janne, Hanzou or Fuuma and Ryoko!
0:29 Between Haohmaru and Mai best moment since Samurai Spirits ending back in the day.  Team Samurai October 4th! LET'S GO!!! We'll always support you SNK!
SOOOOOO Hype for KOF my childhood character!! Athena/Kula/Nakoruru Baby 🔮❄️🦅
Wonderfull SNK perfect
Enserio hao está recordando a Mai de los snk vs capcom??? O los NeoGeo coliseum
Siiiiiiii. Chingon
I love Samurai Shodown, I really do, but I would've prefered a KOF team like Duo Lon, Shen, Oswald, the American Sports Team instead
SNK games-the last abode of beautiful and sexy women,also thanks for Haohmaru-my favourite samurai legend) SNK take my money
copy paste 3d model samurai shadow  really SNK🤨? team kof maximun impact?
fucking sick
with balance patch and match making correction?
Will we ever get some last blade love? Hibiki and setsuna will be awesome here
Cadê a Vice + Mature?
Kinda wish we got Wan-Fu instead of Nakoruru,but aside from that this is what is gonna make me buy this game.
Gracias por tanto SNK!
Nakoruru and Dolores interaction was super expected but it's interesting how Dolores knows something about her, i would how Nakoruru (who has Gaia's powers) will react when she see Otoma-Raga the creator of everything
Desnecessários.
Buying the game now look at Darli 😍😍😍
Bird gal back to ruin yo game
Can snk remaster the neogeo's super dodge ball
Simply Amazing!!!! Great team addition. Full props SNK
Team Samurai, bringing blades in a fist fight
Darli 😍💕
Que lindo que se ve estooooo
平衡調整🥺
Bye Gato. Hi Darli <3
Samurai Warriors não combina com KOF. Uma merda essa adição. Detestei. Muita preguiça da SNK. Se continuar assim a Capcom vai jantar a SNK sem fazer força
Next Team Kizuna encounters, Team Waku-waku, Team The Last Blade, Team Ninja Masters, Team Kabuki Klash 😁
WHO KEEPS INVITING THESE SWORDSMEN TO A FISTFIGHTING TOURNAMENT?!?! It's all fun and games until someone gets disemboweled!!!!
0:29 Absolutely loving the reference to Capcom Vs SNK series
Haomaru is good but it was better if galforf as well was added
good reference to Gurren Lagann in Darli Dagger's CA
Very nice SNK but wee need some new Stages please bring back some Stages from 96 like the gas Station of team Fatal Fury/Art of Fighting that background its gorgeous
Finally Team SamSho is real after years of Memes. GOAT SNK being GOAT
They look pretty cool also if i'm not wrong every character got their own theme remix  which is a very nice addition.
Darli um Yamasaki mulher auhauahaa
A real tribute to sink games
Krohnen, kula ,b.jenet
I wish we can get Nakoruru’s KOF14 attire as an alternative costume. Her outfit is also good.
Carai!!!!!!
SNK really does need more love and support than it gets.  E-- the replies to this involve a lot of people who really need to touch some grass
We need a Boss team with Amakusa, Mr..Big, & Krauser as it's Members.
1:09 Honestly, I thought she was talking to someone from Team Orochi.
The rumor from KOF95 comes true
Nice! But I was really looking forward for a Samsho Stage and alt costumes
*happy dance*
kof xv has best roster ever
Darli looks insane, cant wait
The voice acting on this is great. Nakoruru was always my favorite on Samurai Shodown for Gamegear.
The way of the....⛩️⚔️Samurai⚔️⛩️
Okay so expect a Get Into Fighting Games on the 4th.
Shiki was better
Ya quiero a mi Shingo y espero que vengan team Hakkeshu Goenitz, Mature y Vice pronto, pronto!
Awesome! Mas cadê o Chang, SNK?
where is IROHA....
GAWD DAMN!
Worst DLC decision so far. Bringing weapon heavy fighters into the mix is a really cheap, budget approach.
they have nothing to do in kof so disapointed, where are kim, vice mature shen eetc... what bad idea
Still here, hoping for Sylvie and Mian ;~;
Sugoi!!!🔝
Ohh damn, I love the colors they use for the effects of Nakoruru and Darli Dagger's weapons, plus pretty cool climaxes! Haohmaru is cool too, and it looks like they work into story mode well. 😀
Repito mais uma vez, desperdício de slots.
Samurai & Bullshit
Esta muy bien, sin embargo el ultimo personaje como que mmmmmmmmmmmm... no me termina de convencer, referente a SS creo que habia mejores exponetes y que hubieran sido mejor recibidos por el publico, por ejemplo Basara, Ukyo, Hanzo o incluso Amakusa hubiera quedado mucho mejor para formar el equipo, pero bueno, es bien recibido
Kusanagi hate this team
waiting for shingo's trailer
Ok, muy lindo y todo, ¿Pero y Adelheid Bernstein?
Wow, they make some change to the charscters....more combo....hope not too hard for me to execute....
Graphics are debatable.
Is the, revive the soul song will be available with them..?, That was one of the most underrated song from snk catalog and samurai showdown theme as well.
김갑환!!!!
Haohmaru fights on
Legal demais! Estou na espera para ver o time do Shinho!! Minha aposta é "Shingo, Saisyu e Goro"!!
I can't unsee the bloody finishers.
I would have preferred Mina instead of Nakoruru
Was hoping for Assquake!
I was thinking y’all could include different samurai characters like for example people from last blade
TEAM SAMURAI 👍👏🔥🤩
Finally we can now get the true SNK all star team of Terry, Ryo, & Haohmaru
Ficou bem caprichado esses modelos. Legal!
Loved fighting against Haomaru, Nakoruru, and Hibiki from SamSho, as KoF characters, ever since I played Capcom vs. SNK 2.
Missed opportunity not to promote the Samsho rollback update at the end
A Mexican Stage must be on the game, come on SNK.
This looks so good, i hope they fix rhe matchmaking stuff too
Já viro bagunça kkkk coloca os cara do capitão comando ... Cadillac and dinossauros final fight kkkk Vamos ver os próximos .. Goro Daimom Chang choi chin kin que já tá vindo ... Kof de vdd
kinda wish Iroha would be in this team.
Darli vs b jenet
I get the more magical girl tone as a classy retooling for the rating, but Nakoruru's pure hearted design suddenly showered in blood and the saddened determination on her face to end it swiftly was a big part of the super move.
Something different, but I prefer Kasumi, Chang, Choi
All those water effects on darlis hits look sick <3
Two words. Booba physics.
Al final del critical de Darli, se puede escuchar un... Fatality!
bad timing for this   the game miss way to much kof character already , and still no balance patch for k9999 and kula :( and poor ramon and billy
0:29 She did appear in some of the Characters endings of Samurai Shodown 93 if  I remember right.
That. Was. EPIC!!! 😆💖😆💖
I was like captain America with that reference when I saw the interaction with hoahmaru vs mai ((samurai showdown haohmaru ending))
Que trailer bom Vey, prevejos altos combos com a Darli
Fantástico! Mudaram várias coisas na gameplay, inclusive os Clímax!!! Muito top SNK, valeu ❤️🔥
I wonder if Haomaru has the alternate victory animation where his sword doesn't fall into the shaft but drops beneath him with him getting scared by it xD
Return of the nak
Essa Darli aí desfoca o time.... Pra mim Galford tem muito mais relação com Nakoruru e Haomaru do que ela ( em relação a história de Samurai Shodow 2 onde na cronologia fecha a história de SS).
They finna drop on my birthday
Who added Darly Dagger? Should have been Kibagami Genjuro
달리대거 저런거 말고 차라리 겐쥬로 같은 애나 나오지
首吹っ飛んだり真っ二つにされたり戦闘終了時に死が明確に表現されるゲームと気絶だったりボカされるゲームがコラボするのって、なんか変な気分になるんだよな
Yasuo x kof XV yeaaa!!!!
Espero que Nakoruru no esté igual de rota que en KOF XIV.
Where the F is Kim!?
It's shattered our expectations we taught on Thursday there's some trailer but today at thi time unexpected but we love this trailer Snk does well job for two different games unite together so we hope there's more trailers coming in last of the year just like alternative costumes for all the characters in KOF 15
0:34 Eu Entendi...Eu Entendi a referencia...
Can I get uhhhhhhhh ratio 4 heavy slash?
Генджуро Кибагами больше подошел бы как третии член команды
Darli Dagger looks amazing
Happy to welcome them but.. I don't know. See blades/lethal weapons as "normal" in KoF looks kinda weird to me :/
Man, these trailers sure have improved. Really need to look into this game.
Why not Fatal fury characters ..like freeman.
Hell fucking yeah!!! ✌😎👍
disappointed without​! Mature and Vice.
Cara que time Daora Awesome 🤙🏻👏🏻👌🏻👍🏻🤟🏻🕹🎮😎🤩😁🥳🤑😇😱🏅🏆🎖
Good char and shitty matching
Darli looks spectacular
Usaron el tema de nakoruru ahhhhh!
até que eu gostei
So you can release dlc but cant fix the matchmaking?
Man I want Hotaru from Garou mark of the wolves , last I played her in Kof XI , I want her to come back in XV
great!
this is so beautiful!
For those who are asking why Haomaru tells that to Mai, the shiranui clan existis in samsho universe with a char exactly like Mai being responsible for killing Shiranui Gean.
Welcome team samurai
And... New Stage DLC???
O.k. SNK  Can we have RASETSUMARU AND RERA  Characters as DLC in KOF XV ?
Yeah🖖
Good stuff SNK, good stuff. Darli and Haomaru look hella nice, and Nako has her own special background during Climax, which I think is a first in XV. All the voice acting is top notch. Kind of interesting how the lack of torrents of blood feels like it's missing for Samsho characters 😆
Now, if only we got Yashamaru instead of Nakoruru.
Muy bien chinofaiters
This team is completely cheat  They put sharp weapons on fist fight
I still would’ve preferred Rimururu, Shizumaru, Sogetsu, and Galford/Poppy to be with Nakoruru. But I know Haohmaru is the face with her, and Darli has to represent this game. I just only care about Nako from these three.
I'm still wating for a Last Blade x Samurai Spirits crossover
Time to bringing a Sharp knife to a fist fight...
Terrible choices, shouldve been  Haohmaru, Ukyo or Charlotte and Galford or Hanzo
I guess this means that Hanzo is Mai's Ancestor is canon.
I don't know anything about Samurai Spirit, but Dagger's weapon seems very interesting
Cool
Meu DEUS! QUe zoado ... em vez de melhorar,fica mais cagado o jogo kkkkk
Eu tô inteiramente apaixonado por todas as escolhas desse jogo, PQP! Esse climax da Darli tá no meu coração, já!  ありがとうございました, SNK!
I was waiting for their trailer and date announcement to drop! They all look amazing! Welcome to the family samurai team! It would be a great addition for Nakoruru to be accompanied by Shikuru (her wolf) for a change! She has a great desperation move though!
Thanks, SNK!
Me : See this video name "Team Samurai"  Also me : I'm not found samurai in this team
Darli's tits look so off putting and fake lmao
0:58 - Nakoruru ❤❤❤❤❤
i love the remix of nakoruru's theme it sounds like it was mixed with haohmaru's
where's shingo
still waiting for shingo and kim...but kinda miss some old characters like lin, may lee , hinako and xiangfei i hope there dlc....
Samurai Shodown World Heroes Team Coming Soon
I'd still like to see a crossover with other series outside of SNK. Maybe a team of three fighters from different (or same) series, maybe individual guests...
Fatality 2:35
Samurai em KOF? Quando eu penso que o 15 já atingiu o fundo do poço.............kkkkkk
Snk, como explicas el uso de armas cortantes de este equipo en un torneo de artes marciales? Genial en un DREAMATCH pero en un juego de la saga... 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
I was hoping for Yoshitora, instead of Nakoruru 😅
Flashier than Samsho version
My expectations were completely unshattered by this completely unsurprising reveal.
Why Darli Dagger?
世界観が違いすぎて、、、
👍😯👍
Excelente, Team Samurai, aunque me hubiera gustado ver a Genjuro que a Darli, ahora esperando el Team Korea, Grande SNK 💙
Me hubiera gustado más ver a Charlotte que a la pirata. Pero bueno, es lo que hay.
I want chamcham in the game :'(
2:40 ONE PIECE IS REAL!!!
Where Marco Rodriguez 🔥🔥🔥of garou ?
¡¡Espectacular!! ¡¡Cuenta regresiva para utilizarlos en las retas!!
Darli 😍❤️
I love it
They gave samsho characters combos
É sério isso, Parabéns estou de boca aberta
Who is Haohmaru confusing Mai with?
Haohmaru looks a little stiff. Hope this is repaired. I’m impressed by Nakoruru.
Excellent team!
Ya están aquí
K.
Não ter o Genjuro é um crime indescritivel
I can't wait to get a taste of nakoruru pits. 🤤  Edit: I'm such a loser
Greaaat
This is great. I just wish there were more single player modes.
Nada a ver esses personagens de Samurai Shodown com KOF.
Nada aver esse trio na kof 15 😕😕
They should have chosen Shiki or Basara for me... But i guess these are also good.
DARLI FOREVER
What a great trailer, but I really wish team Samurai got their own stage. I really hope that we will start getting dlc costumes/stages once season 2 begins :)
Love the interaction with Hoahmaru and Mai, nice callback to SamSho 1.
maravilloso team samurai shodown... han hecho un trabajo maravilloso con su adaptacion... la reina de SNK regresa 🦅
Who says that Samurai Shodown is a footsies game again?   This feels different because it’s impossible for Haohmaru, Nakoruru, and Darli Dagger to pull of super cancel, max cancel combos like this.
Woooooooooooo team samurai shodown😇😇😇😇😇
My God they will Slice out Everyone into pieces. ! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 0:33 confirms that  the Woman who fought HAOHMARU was Ancestor of MAI SHIRANUI who looks Exactly Like MAI SHIRANUI. 1:35 This Climax Out Classed from every Character. AWESOME !
Time Samurai ficou bem no Kof 15 tema de Nakoruru supreendente como sempre 😍
I hope Nakoruru is top tier and doesn’t get any nerfs.
みんな思いっきり武器持ってる件について(笑)
The best birthday gift😭
I wish to see King Of Fighter 15 X Zombie Army 4 Dead war crossover someday  Team Alpha squad look fit for this game
Nakoruru looks overdesigned. Too much stuff happens in her combos.
nothing to see this trio at kof 15😕😕😕👎👎👎👎
Goenitz,  Chang
I'm so glad Darli wasn't forgotten to just the last SS game. A part of me wishes Love Heart was in the game now to make a full pirate team.
Announcer for KOF Characters: *Says Names Normally* Announcer for Haohmaru: *HaOHMaRu*
funny the dlc will be released on my birthday
Genial SNK
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Broken as hell. mahauahua
Eeeebaaaa
Fun fact, the Hao vs. Mai intro is a reference to Haohmaru's SS1 ending, where he fights Mai for some reason.
Loving the commentary between Haohmaru and the current representative of the Shiranui clan. Too bad Mai has no idea what he's talking about. lol
I just want Kim
I didn’t know Samurai Shodown had stylish combos like this.
This game has no right to hit this hard but it does and I am all for it
Mai's ancestor made a cameo in Samsho1. It’s crazy how that was never touched upon until now.
NO BLOOD :C
Fuck! How good the 3 look representing SAMSHO, it already makes me a scramble to know how their story will be, I love the new attacks of Haohhmaru and Nakoruru always never failing in that SNKA apart from Darli's new movements if they are very like saying "Drill" xDPlease put Shingo with a team please ;v
What a Scam!!!
Thank you so much SNK As a long time Sam Sho fan this trailer made my day! Can't wait to try these characters out.
Awesome!
小林ゆうさんのＤＬＣ化はブームなのか？ww
“Haohmaru, you are sentenced to prison for 50 years for 18 accounts of injuries and 7 murders. What do you have to say for this?” “Wh-What? I thought this was a fighting tournament, samurais are supposed to duel each other to death, what do you mean under arrest for murder?” “You’re definitely high right now. That’s 15 more years for possession and use of drugs in court”
Was not expecting them to come out next week.  What a surprise!  Can't wait to play as Haohmaru again.
Grab your swords! It’s time for you to learn the way of the Samurai.
FODA
0:28 I understood this reference. LMAO.
Their combat seems to be well tranfered hope i can try them out at a certain point
Darli, S2!
Seria mas hermoso si un team vendria con un stage nuevo. Agreguen stages plis..., Este dlc es compra segura!!
acho que quebra o estilo do jogo esses personagens samurais, muda tipo o o jogo! ja que a maioria dos personagens lutam sem armas.
Haomaru looks like he'll be fun to play
The vfx improved so much with the latter characters!
Darli and Jenet special intro? My heart ♥️♥️♥️
ABOUT DAMN TIME
칼은 반칙이지…
Ficou muito maneiro os personagens novos...não vamos reparar no detalhe de não ter sangue.
Im sorry but this just seems like a cheap cop out to me...They are just sticking pre made models from SamSho into this game. Theres so many Kof characters fans have been asking for. Just not a fan of this crossover imo.
好奇怪的dlc，都快變成SNK大亂鬥🤣🤣👍👍
SNK SKINS? NOT. NEW SCENARIOS? NOT. Automatically switch songs during disputes? not. Takuma, Kensou, Daimon, Chin, i others? Not.  Let's go snk for this game now render, the basics like clothes are sorely missed, the line is moving, and it just seems that we, who love kof, are thrown aside. Where is Billy's improvements, basic adjustments that take months to occur.  About this new team, it's very beautiful.
Now this is a good Shattering of Expectations.
The way the announcer says haomaru name.
Nerf Krohnen
希望角色平衡可以一起大修 不然覺得熱度明顯下降了
nice reference to the haohmaru ending of the first samurai shodown the cutscene with mai is because he challenge a character that basically is mai doing a cameo but more obvious is clearly an ancestor of our andy loving kunoichi that he faced
i really like that they used the menu theme in this trailer can’t wait for samsho 2019 rollback
Darli no sé ve muy interesante, su clímax es el mismo que en samsho 😐 Hubiera preferido a Charlotte o Galford. HAOMARU se ve genial, tengo ganas de usarlo yaa Porfa SNK agreguen más escenarios
DANM! WHAT FUCK IS THIS!? THE WORSE CHOOSE!
Haohmarun is such a hot cutie 😭💖💖💖💖💖💖
FIX MATCHMAKING SO WE CAN PLAY !!!!!!
Please give us Maximum Impact Team DLC - Alba Meira, Soiree Meira and Luise Meyrink. I'm dying to see how Alba will look and play in 2.5D style. Plus adding Alba will truly complete "All Heroes of KOF in this game".
Mano! Mano! Manoooooooo. Que lindo, é muito bom ver as duas franquias  juntas.  E essa música da nakoruru, cara! Emocionei!
The online is ass so wtv.
Sooooo Hype! ❤❤❤❤❤
Yo esperaba ver sangre
Haohmaru referencing NGBC like Shermie references 2002 in SNK Heroines. Otherwise HYPE!
Yes, yes, and YES
Darli looks fun
A greath Trailer.
Ya saquen a los de la kof maximun impact. Tienen muchos personajes de esa saga que no han ocupado.
LETS FUCKING GO
Kinda thinking about Bodies of them Being sliced into Half xD Hahahhahahaha
Mai- we never met before!   Me: Capcom VS SNK 2. Lol
Last Blade x Samurai Showdown FTW! That would be great crossover
Season 2 can't come fast enough. I will also enjoy these guys too.
Could y'all please do an update for a legacy mode 🙏 it would be nice to use my arcade sticks 😭
I wasn't expecting them that soon.
Im waiting to DLC Retro outfit for athena asamiya in kof 15, im hope so soon
That's more like it! Character FX is looking great on all the characters
It's still shame that Galford didn't make a cut. But Darli is still a good choice and I'm glad they didn't chose Mina (though she was revamped in 2019 but still).
Que porra é essa?? Mortal Kombat no KOF?? Só cortadas cruéis! Principalmente da mina ali, a tal da Dagger. Odiei na moral
epico, entonces con esto nos demuestra SNK que los personajes de KoF son muy potente y que las fatality solo le harian cosquilla ya que ni una espada o motocierra les hizo daño cuando usamos el team samurai, grande SNK.
Whoa! Out of nowhere.
I am so excited for Team Samurai and Which SNK Bosses Characters that are not in The King of Fighters XV would you like to see in The King of Fighters XV in The Next Season for me Krizalid Original Zero Igniz Goenitz Orochi Iori Orochi Leona Wolfgang Krauser Mr Big and Mr Karate
I can't belive I still have the KOF XV hype in me even after the first trailer. And obviously, I'M NOT COMPLAINING! 😍
E assim fechou a primeira fase de KOFXV... Coisa linda esse time...  Que venha a Fase 2 !!!
Why is it always Haomaru and Nakoruru SNK? AND WHERE IS MY WORLD HEROES TEAM SNK.. 😠
Kusanagi is seething with rage right now, seeing everyone in this team are using weapons.  てめえ! 素手で勝負しやがれ!!!
Eita que agora a espada vai cantar no lombo da galera do KOF!
Looks like you did a great job improving nakoruru's move set
beautiful
Yay but nerf Krohnen
SNK MINHA DELÍCIA 🇧🇷💜😈
Oh nice!
🎉🎉🎉 Yeah the wait is over 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Respect
Simply awesome 😁
Bad choice of characters
On my exam day😢
Falta só team metal slug e quem sabe um team Last Blade
They look amazing!
Nice Team ❤️👏
Excellent
También agregen más stages para potencializar más el juego saludos
Se ven vergas
Me mié
Oh sweet😱
Im diggin hao's moves here! And he has a special cutscene with Mai! Wonder what thats about? 🤔 Overall im likin team Samarui all around! Is Darli Dagger 🗡 also a pirate herself? Makes sense to have a special cutscene with B.Jenet if she is.
No hibiki😞
love me some samurai showdown
Eca ...  Pobre SNK ... será engolida pelos anuncios de SF 6
Gente poderia ter colocado a charlotte
Snk please release capcom vs snk 2 or chaos for ps4 and xbox

It's nice to see these two series finally getting some form of crossover like Snk initially intended years back.💫
