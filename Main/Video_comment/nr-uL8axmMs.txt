Barca signing a 34 year old forward and not Messi.. That's a badly run team.
Argentina will never win a soccer world cup. Their players just play on team with star players, when the real world cup rolls they are a team with a lot of weakness that money cannot hide.
i dont watch UK Football to much
This video aged very well🤭🤭🤣🤣🤣 espn s predictions 🤭🤭
Jules is so happy
Should have held with PSG
5:15 Shaka is absolutely right. 🇹🇹  This mess has nothing to do with Messi.  This shows how poorly Barcelona is run as a club.  FC Barcelona not only managed to lose their crown jewel but also the best footballer in the world.  Smh.
Money all about money
How is Paris Saint-Germain getting away with financial fair play when Barcelona is being criticized for the same thing watch Paris Saint-Germain wage structure and you will see it is not that different from Barcelona
Aggrandizement is an actual English word you doofus 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
He never played for a different club compare to Ronaldo🙄
Mif it's money he's wanting, go to the states. He'll make another $200 million in three years in endorsements
Messi:😭😭  PSG:  Take a Clinic 🤧 cry all you want. Wen you're done welcome to your new home
Get Shakira to buy Barcelona
The erect caravan provisionally wander because girl promisingly knot beside a hot huge lilac. slimy, bad front
Bayern??
Jules should have sticked to his guns. PSG all the way
I'll miss Messi and Neymar in the same team😒
Why couldn’t he just take less money to help the team that made him?
Atlanta United
MLS
What can be expected from a street bull born on the pavement?
Everyone single one of them guessed Messi's next club as Barcelona . But La liga had other ideas
PSG
The end of an era and laliga dies
Powerful interests in La Liga were determined to spoil Messi & Barcna. The prospect of Messi winning Ballon D' Or 2021 & Barca winning the UCL in 2022 was anathema. Real Madrid is one... Thank you Messi for the Joy and making life more beautiful
If the losses were 200MM euros rather than actual 400MM euros it could happen.   These Bartemou signings have ruined our finances.   Panjic, Griezman, Dembele and Cotinho.
I think Messi will stay. La liga will soften their stance on the FFP, using COVID as the pretext. All this talk is missing the main fact that Barca’s allowed spending has dropped massively because of Covid. Nothing else.
PSG. saved u time
I wish Juventus can buy him, just want to see something.
Thanks to Bayern Munich transfer saga started with 8-2 🤣🤣
"Things are happening.." ..."We don't know..."....What amazing insights.
I am a Barcelona fan and will be happy that Messi find a club the meet his level and achieve his soccer and finance goals. I do not know any other club that meet that excep PSG and MANCITY. Barcelona administration messed up and no logical players choices for the last 5 years.
Barca lost when they gave up Suarez.
Messi will be at MLS next year. No doubt about it.
Why does everyone think Messi can't leave Barcelona. He got tired of the club already and wanted to leave last year. I don't know why people think he can't leave. He'll definitely go somewhere else and he'll be just fine. Greatest players change clubs. Sergio Ramos just changed after all the trophies he won for Madrid.
Don't  leave God out your life repent now
Traitor and sell out.If he wanted to  stay in Barca he would of renew his contract before the end of the season.What a disgrace. 😡😡👎
espn crew daddy is going🤣🤣🤣😂
Shame on Messi,  no words on PSG, I hope they will not win the champions league anytime soon
😭😭😭😭😭
Bad for Barcelona! Wherever he goes he is "MESSI" AND we are here a fan of him not Barcelona.  Go Messi 😍😍
I became a F.C. Barcelona fan because of this man, and I’m not one of those glory hunters who change the club they support. But as someone who has followed this man when he started watching football, It will be really really hard for me to see him in any other club’s jersey. I’m forever grateful for what he did for the club and what he did for football. I’m someone who has no roots to Barcelona but the club resides in my heart. That being said, Messi is someone who made me love football and seeing him leave the club I’ve been supporting is really heartbreaking. I know there are a million others who feel the same. But the show must go on. I’ve shed a tear when he’s leaving my club. I know he’s irreplaceable and I know it’s gonna be hard for us without him. I wish him he wins more and more wherever he goes. Forca Messi. Forca Barcelona.
Mbappe is 23 or 24. If he wins champions league, he will be above messi. Let's remember that if you want to be an all time great, you have to win the world cup. Messi doesn't have one yet. Once psg secures the champions league, mbappe will be considered the best footballer in the 20th century.
If Messi goes to Chelsea , we will win titles for years to come . The amount of knowledge he can pass on to our vastly younggg squad . Would be surreal .
I see Messi siting out a season in MLS and return to Barca next year when finances are sorted out
It's not shocking news to me
Now kids going to wear a PSG Jersey with Messi name behind it..Amazing..
Leo Messi to Juvie! Forget barc'a. Juvie, Uvie!!!
Can't imagine Messi and Ramos on the same team!
tbh messi should join a year with out wages and playing for "free" as a last thank you so he can get a proper good bye from the fans
I agree with Gab. They fking knew what you could afford but yet signed players on a free transfer!!!! Dont blame La Liga or Messi, blame lies with Barca board, the previous one and the current one. Typical Barca. They let Suarez go and now Messi, both without a send off they deserved. Yea you could blame COVID for that but really, you could have done it online !! Were they not Spanish enough for your typical racist taste?? So disappointment. La Liga is done. Barca is even more done!! I was here following Barca before Messi but not anymore. What sh.ts me is that Laporta used Messi to become the president. Messi doesnt deserve this. Not from Barto and not from him and not from any human being. Everyone deserves to be respected and that was something he wasnt, for the last 2 years !!!!!
He'll join Man United
Messi didnt leave barca. Barca left leo😭
They knew they were not able to keep Messi on the books, they used the news of his new contract at Barcelona as a means to signing other players.
ill give messi my stimulus checks and unemployment checks so he can stay at barsa
Shangai  f. C. Waiting for  him  !
Lets get something clear... Messi did not leave... HE WAS LET GO!!!! They should fix the title...
In my opinion, it will be nice to see a new adventure of Messi I a new team.... He will have a fresh mindset, free of intense pressure to perform  The Barca Legend moves on....
i really hope he gets into man city,wonder what will happen to aguero who joined for messi
😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😭😭😢😭😭😭
Ronald might leave juve sooon Ronald and Messi 👀👀
Juv…
Time for Barcelona to sign the tall Norwegian!
All were wrong. He's gone.
Messi can go to any premier league and he will sell out the stadium... The pockets are big for football in Europe... Even if he plays for a team who hasn't had too much success in the premier league he will have everyone swooning over him... There is currently no release clause for him... Sometimes the Premier League puts 5 teams in the Champion's League...
why not JUVENTUS?
Premier League... Is where you go... There is NO SALARY CAP!!!
I'm also a free agent fan now.. I'm waiting for a new club to support, my destination is where Messi will play.. but I got my fingers crossed for PSG
I really feel bad for Joan Laporta because football fans who don’t understand the dynamics behind what’s happening with Barcelona will think he is responsible for this mess he is trying so hard to clean up. They won’t know Josep Bartomeu (ex president) is the responsible culprit.
I hope messi joins italy or english leauge
so disapointed i want messi at psg
Messi is going nowhere !!! He was is and will be king of Barcelona !! If there is God   Then Messi will stay in Barcelona!! love from NEPAL.
Will be the new Highest paid MLS player.
Shouldn't Donnarumma be in goal instead for Navas as new signing & European champion?
He’s coming to dc United
LOL once you stop ogling the front 3, you'll realize 0 of them track back and Ramos is 35. Soooo...maybe PSG should play both their world-class GKs at once to deal with the disaster of counter-attacks. As an aside, Ramos and Messi on the same team entertains me to no end haha
Gab first comment sums it up perfectly... That statement is absurd, how could you possibily reach an agreement if said agreement doesn't follow the rules in the first place?  It's like saying that I agreed to buy a Ferrari for 1.000.000 € from a car dealership while already knowing that I don't have that kind of money, and then blaming it on the bank.
"best player of all time", right.... Top 5 sure, but you cannot order those 5 objectively.
Juventus
Im not going to believe this until he’s in camp nou celebrating a winning goal with psg in the ucl semi finals😓😓😓😓
Barca don spend money finish 😂😂🤣
Messi could play for Barcelona for normal wage and give him partial revenues for each sold jersey
13:25 Donnaruma will start instead of Navas
Wanna see CR7 and Messi play together, they play well together in PSE
13:38. He speaks in Messi language.
Whelp Barca fans can blame the Greez and Philipe signings.
Don’t matter if Messi leaves. Barca is still my team for life.....THIS IS A NIGHTMARE NOOO!!!!😭
I'm now a free agent fan till Messi signs for a new club
Messi to Miami
When I look at the current situation, I wonder if the SUPER LEAGUE was such a bad idea. I am conflicted.
I just pity for them who took the odds of Inter, how they gonna afford Messi in their present financial disaster!
Very very sad for Bercelona...we don't know what going to happen in bercelona next!!!
Messi stays at barca  End of discussion
Let Messi join Juventus for the greatest history in football 💯 ❤️🫂👬👨‍❤️‍👨😍⚡✨💫🌟🔥🥳🎊🎉
It's simple. If you wanted Messi, you shouldn't have bought new players
I don't know why he like too much money all ready he have much and much......🤔
Football is the official sport of noobs
Any club Messi go to I’ll follow him & Leave Barcelona
Mappe, Messi, neymar and Ramos, what a team psg has
Iam A Citizen but even if He Joins The Red Devils. I Will Start Watching Their Games. Might Even Root For Them.
The Question Is Will La Liga Even Survive This Cos We Moving With Leo.
Let him go somewhere else and prove he IS THE MAN!
PSG still won't win the Champions League anytime soon at least. Maybe after a decade things will be different. FFP doesn't apply to Premier League clubs and PSG apparently.
Go to juve messi
So after all that they all say , or think he will still be at Barcelona by September 1.  So basically 99% of the video was unnecessary!! 🤦🏻‍♂️
The acceptable peony concurringly grease because sandra optically stamp since a succinct dead. friendly, tasteful tin
Too much money 💰
Was a lifetime Barca fan..first because of Ronaldinho. Then xavi iniesta and Puyol..then Messi showed up..now I don't care for one single player except maybe Ansu Fati Barca is over
Idiots..Barca became trash..goodbye forever Barca
Ac milan & Liverpool & City should try for messi
Yusuf demir let's gooooo
seems like a political move to have the laws change...
PSG or Manchester City
Thats it??? Thank you and goodbye ???messi is the club...
When you elect a President because his #1 priority is to keep the best player you ever had , someone probably worth 150 millions of € at 34 years old .  And that very GOAT of a player is shown the exit through the back door . What a joke FC Barcelona is becoming again , what a fall .  You can be sure every football club in Europe is trying to recruit Messi now , the biggest NO TRANSFER FEES contract of all time right there .
i am ronaldo fan , but i admire messi too, but in this case ,i know bartomeu made things super bad at bacelona during his administration but i feel like messi should've signed that 5 year deal contract with barca playing till 2026 with the first year him playing for free for barca after all he took 500 mil from barca in the past 3 years, i think this would be reasonable as 1 year would give barca enough time to sell players and adjust their financial situation to accommodate mess's salary with him taking a 20% paycut. well this is my opinion
So Messi which league u r going to play in Saudi Arabia or Qatar or UAE its so hard to choose
He should play in England, yet to confirm if he can do it on a cold rainy windy night in Stoke!!
That's an easy question, the answer is simple... WEST BROMWICH ALBION 👍
When he wanted to leave they stopped him, when he wanted to stay they let him go. I don't see barca in champions league next year. I learnt one thing: never fell in love with your company because you don't know when company will stop loving you.
I hope messi and ronaldo plays for the same club.....
Qatar PSG stole Neymar and destroyed the greatest trio MSN who scored record 120 goals. FCB went downhill from there, thanks to country-owned clubs, who inflated massively the transfer market. Then FCB tried to replace Neymar with expensive crocks and donkeys, Messi wanted Griezmann/Coutinho to join him, he got paid and now leaves on a free, pfff. PSG created the whole problem for FCB and if Messi joins them I'm gonna denounce him and I'm not gonna care how he's doing. I've been a fan of Barcelona long before Messi arrived... Laporta should be rutheless, especially with catalan players that refuse to cut their wages, and only agreed to a minor deferral of payments to later date. Sell or don't register old players. Ramos was the highest earner at RM with 12M Euros, while Messi got 70M, and 5 other players got more than Ramos, that's preposterous. They got paid and did not deliver. What did Messi do vs Juventus, Roma, Liverpool, Bayern???
I just want to see Messi and Neymar playing together again
Laliga said no player is bigger than the league.... Let's see if laliga is bigger than Messi
I suppose : PSG
I strongly feel this situation was unavoidable because of the huge package he was receiving from the last contract (Even though I think that he is more than worth the amount he is paid). Ever since, last contract was signed, the team spirit within Barca players/management doesn’t seem to exist. This could be seen from the performance of Barca during 2017-2021 seasons for critical matches especially in UCL (other being Barca vs Levante in 2017-18 Laliga). The commitment of some of the players were questionable. There seems to a group (among Barca players and management) which want to send a message “ Barca had great seasons from 2008-2015 not because of Messi, but because of the team and the entire Barca system”. Senseless signings and finanical mismanagement all point in the same direction.  I wish Messi had used a professional agent than his father while having contract discussions.
I think this was intentional by barca, they could not give even 50mil per year for a 34year old. If they wanted messi they wud not have signed depay aguero etc and used those wages to keep messi.
Question: What did we learn? Answer: Everyone is dispensable.
It's all la liga's fault
These clowns man 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Espn is going take a big L
I would love to see him at Man City, ideal challenge for him and the EPL would be so exciting...
As a Madrid and Ronaldo fan I hope the league can bend the rules for this gift of football Leo
AC Milan dream acquisition??????
MAN CITY
Upside for United, if PSG manage to get Messi then i can't see Pogba going to PSG. Maybe he goes to Juve next season but it could just push him to sign a new contract with United seeing as the vast majority of any fee will have gone to Messi.
Se Queda
Why is Gab hiding in a bunker???
don't worry about it guys.  there are more teams in spain other than barcelona.  just because they can't keep their finances in check.  it's their own fault  they know the rules. if they wanted messi they had to get rid of alot of wages and not sign anyone.  the chose to sign about 4 players instead of keeping messi.  it's quite simple.  and messi didn't want to take a 75-80% pay cut  which is probably what would be needed to reach the agreed salary cap.   all the teams agreed on the salary structure.  and breaking would mean they are breaking league rules and would have to be punished accordingly.............shaka knows.
BLACKPOOL.
Sure Pep would love to relive the Messi false 9 days ...
Just change the manager
here we go with the same old story of him leaving this is getting really boring now we had this discussion in 2013, last year and now come on now no one is buying this
I'm confused. Messi wanted out last year but stayed on cause he didn't want to go to court. So Messi will stay for a year then leave, I thought that was known for the last year that his time was coming to the end.
Messi only have 2 years left at the highest level. The only club that can give him a salary and a new CL is PSG. If he wins the CL with PSG in 2022 and the World cup with Argentina in Qatar, he will become the best player in history. Only PSG can give him another "Ballon d'Or" and a CL title. The picture of him with 4 PSG players on holiday speaks a lot. After those 2 years he can go play in MLS.
I find it so weird that Messi is asking for so much money. Wouldn’t he be handicapped if Barcelona didn’t pay for his medical bills as a kid?  Wouldn’t he never have played the game if it wasn’t for the club?  Why so much money my guy, I’d settle for life with 3 million. I probably wouldn’t even spend more then 1 million…
I want him to go to Juventus
Bartomeu is a disaster but ed woodward is on whole another level. Bartomeu gives bumper deals to greizmann whereas woodward gives that to phil jones
when did this happend and why is he leaving. what is the reason ? !!
Sad day for fcb fans😂
He will play for the Lakers
Psg& city is best place fore messi
City please!!!
its so stupid. Barca is indepted to the neck and still says we wanna pay  this guy gigillions of euros...Messi says i love barca its my life and ask incredible amount of pay knowing they are indepted to the neck. You know why freaking St Jonston deosnt have Messi in their payroll coz they dont got the money. Barca doesnt have the money yet they are crying over La liga rules. Go away Barca...I hope they and any other mismanaged team out there chock on their own dept for the next decade.
alll this is money.... nothing more to it. stop the drama. La liga says their is a limite to pay. Players who are their already are breaking that limite today. Solution next year some player with giant pay will leave so. Give messi a 5 year deal pay him 1 dollar this year next 20 mill then 75 mill then 200 mil and final year pay him in nature for all i care.
Barcelona needs to sell lots of players cut Messi salary more then half and that it
Messi to real madrid???
This just proves that nothing lasts forever
We love u Messi 😘😘😘😘
Messi should go to AC Milan
Messi is overrated
would be Epic if he goes to Juve even for 1 season.
Poor Depay: He won't be playing with Messi. 😁😁
Messi will NEVER leave Barcelona!!
NYFC
Ik arsenal wages r not as bad as barca wages but 300k a week for aubamyang is insane and when ozil was still in arsenal I think he's wage was 350k a week and arsenal spend a lot of money for useless players aswell to be fair but not even close to barca
i think messi might join inter if lukaku leaves would make sense
Martin Braithwaite is now the richest FCB player
Maybe super league shook feathers at Barca...too greedy
MESSI AND RAMOS IN SAME TEAM....LOL
Barcelona its a ruse to force la liga into changing its rules
Laporta knew what he was doing, used Messi to convince players to sign on before saying they couldn’t afford Messi
Didn’t neymar wanna get outta his shadow... I wish he went to premier league...man city Chelsea ..can ESPN get a refund to laliga rights...I don’t think ppl understand how much money he brings in revenue wise and oh yeah his talent isn’t fallin off. Jules pre psg news
i have been waiting to see pedri combine with Messi the upcoming season but i am disappointed now.
12:07 where is New old Boys?
Go Madrid Go Florentino, lets get him !!!
i think barcelona is better for it imho messi is the goat but this is a team sport. the host obnoxious af did he even play football or was he just a spectator
Millions are Barca fans as me only because......Messi is there in Barca ..
I feel sorry for barca fans. Big club, small brains.
The deal was done right up until La Liga said no.
If  messi leaves Barcelona the league is done for.looks like the Premiership is the no1 in world now.most big players now in England. Best league in world now fact!
Is he leaving or not ? Ffs
Messi to united plz 🙏
Mister messi Golden Ball 2021
This is a moment, football will remember forever! Just think about that!
ESPN in shambles as they signed a multibillion dollar deal with La Liga and the poster boy has probably left the building.
he will come at man city for sure
🔵🛑🔵🎉
Messi will go to NEW YORK CITY FOOTBALL CLUB [MLS]!
Ray Hudson definitely gonna cry his self to bed every night 🙇🏽‍♂️
Imagine Messi playing for Chelsea football club
I would be okay to see him in any other jersey than the PSG. Because going into Ligue 1 would clearly be a step down for him. Man City would be a perfect choice.
Barca fans get ready for a rough ride in la liga
Please do not go to PSG.  Go somewhere with some history at least.  United, City or one of the Italian big guns.
the management didn't take it seriously on selling underperformed players to let messi stays
Spanglish?! "aggrandisement"; noun: the act of increasing the wealth or prestige or power or scope of something.
Gab has been kidnapped and is being held in an attic.
Me: thinking about el classico
PSG
LAFC!!!!
this garbage
2 THINGS: 1: Shaka must be very happy now. 2: Can someone get me Bartomeu's piece of hair? I need to do some voodoo on him. 😂
He won’t leave Barca
Jesus Christ I hope we’re all stuck in messi genjutsu or something la liga blocking Messi from resigning makes no sense it’s more revenue for the league to have Messi there than to not no? 🥲
I believe when i see it
Messi, just go to PSG  and cement your legacy with the team where you will play along with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe'
play tiddly winks next season !!!!!!
you mean which club can afford his wage
real Madrid
The La Liga president only cares about money!! He doesn't want tweat the rules so Messi can renew
Imagine Ramos and Messi and Neymar on same  team 😂
why on earth would they sign Aguero & Depay if this was a possibility
Neymar + Messi + Mbappe Front furious three of PSG .
messi psg mbappe real madrid
They are lying they just want to sell messi why not sell tree players to keep messi
Messi killed Barcelona financially over the last 10 years!!  Barca has 1Mrd. depts!!!  If Messi loves the club, he should play for free for one year to help the club!  He has enough money!
Messi needs to win the champion league with another club
What is the probability of him playing for a club for one year, and return!!!!…..
Messi needs to win the World Cup to be the greatest player of all time
Can't picture Messi and Ramos in the same team 😂
the only guarantee is it won't be the PL no way will he play here at his age, he will take the easy option PSG or stay at Barca for free.
If messi leaves,he can obviously be succesful and becoming UCL champion easil😆
Like, we won't forget Thanos in the Marvel universe, the same way we won't forget Bartomeu in Barca. He is a true villain in football history
Why did he leave?
He should go to the new mls expansion team f.c. Yellowstone Park
Excited for Messi's next club
Paredes 😂😂😂😂
These pundits are disgrace 😤
I think Laliga wouldn't let go Messi, if MESSI is gone Laliga is over and out.. there must be some way or other way's to keep Messi in Laliga .. I believe 🙏
Honestly, I don't want Messi to leave Barcelona,not because he can't be happy in other clubs but Barcelona suits him the most
masterclass plan by Tebas and Florentino to bring Mbappe to Madrid. Messi leaving to PSG opens the door to MBAPPE. Now you understand why Tebas is practically harassing Laporta and Barcelona with the “fair play”
No messi
The mismanagement of barcelona is a disgrace
Finally, Barcelona is treated as a normal club. No more rule bending or expectations to be treated differently than other clubs.
I would love to see ronaldo and Messi play together.
Mbappe... Neymar.... AND Messi??? SHEEESH
Messi to leave and join the mighty LIVERPOOL FC!!!
MLS Red Bull Lionel Messi announced his reason to take America following the footsteps of Pele...
why inter and not chelsea
Can Messi do well in another team??
Bu
Barcelona must give him the best freaking farewell possible.
Can't Barcelona create a fake position for Messi e.g club ambassador and pay the remaining wages via that method?
Barca we're winning Copa del Rey   With him might they end up in the bottom 10 now?
No Single Massage Of " Good Luck For New Dastination" . 📢 Lionel I Wish You All The Best In New Team. 👍
Laporta is not much different from Bartomeu, he is still signing useless players.
It's like getting blown back to the stone age for all Barca fans   But please keep falling it's beautiful to witness
Juventos
Atletico Madrid: Hello, Messi Your friend Suarez is here.  Suarez: Welcome Messi..
Nobody really have an explanation for this, except laporta and Tebas
Never thought I'd see the day to be honest.  Good luck Messi, I'm sure you'll kill it at whatever team you sign for.  Man City or PSG I reckon, though I'd like to see him in Italy at Inter but that's unlikely.
Farça! hahaha! Corrupt institution. I dislike them so much! Shattered my trust and faith in fair play that awful night at Stamford Bridge years ago against Chelsea.
I blame Barcelona for all of this. Club responsible for all wages, being run into chaos. Club is full of greed and fraud. Barcelona deserves to be in this. They did it to themselves.
CHELSEA
Messi knows English clubs not for him , no players of his standard , therefore he might look to France , Italy, turkey , greece, san marino etc. 😂
The wasteful prose dfly trouble because felony promisingly part below a cute sphynx. hulking, maddening ghost
Money continues to ruin football. Sigh.
Now, everyone can shut up. After saying Messi is a one club man... Another time for Messi to prove you guys wrong again after shutting you up with Copa America 😊
Kane just go to Madrid bro
Get this into your head....Messi will not be free!  He will demand a 50-70 million signing on fee! and massive wages  PSG, Chelski, Utd or City are the only clubs that could afford that!  I don't think he will go and La Liga will back down and give Barca a temporary dispensation!  He only has 2-3 years left at the top anyway....players don't go on forever even Messi.
The American dude is right it is about the CBC deal Laporta kept mentioning it in his press conference
Saddest day for barca fans
Messi and arsenal have reached an agreement…… both parties Agree it will never happen
"aggrandizement of the club" every starts elbowing each other and starts giggling 🤣🤣🤣
Messi to tottenham go on
😰😰😥💔😓😓😭😥😥💔😓😓😓😥😓😰😰😥😭😓😥💔😥💔😥💔😥😓😥😓😓😭😰😰😥😥😭😥😥😥💔💔😓😓😥😓😰😰😥😓😥😭😭💔😰😓😥😥😓😣💔💔💔😓😭😥😓😰😥💔💔💔💔💔💔
Not psg please
Greatest player in your own opinion don’t say it as a fact for god sake 🤦‍♂️
I think Messi wants part of Barcelona Profit for life lol
Coldest nights in Stoke await...
Braithwaite: It's time to show them what they've been missing😤 Braithwaite Number 10 loading....
I hope messi moves to some English club, hopefully Chelsea 😇
I mean Messi is 34 now. Maybe he could still go to Premier League, but if he wanted more relaxing games PSG would be easy choice... Only tough games they will have are the continental games. PSG just toys around with other French clubs.
Barça won’t win any major trophies for the next few years either.
MESSI sẽ mãi là tượng đài vĩ đại nhất ở BARCA. BARCELONA FC vẫn sẽ mãi là CLB khổng lồ luôn nảy sinh ra những sát thủ vĩ đại như khi MESSI chưa đến.  GRACIAS MESSIIIIIII
Why is Chelsea not the
Hope he doesn't end up playing with Sergio ramos..
covid really ruined everything didnt it...but honestly, as much as it would be interesting to see messi in psg linking with mbappe and neymar, i really hope messi goes to city instead of psg. just have a personal distaste for the way psg forcibly took neymar and ruined the entire market (and barcelona) for years, the clubs partying culture, their ultras, the players attitudes, everything really. would personally rather have messi go to chelsea than psg, although i am sure he wouldnt mind going to psg considering he is friends with half the squad there and is familiar with the rest
Coming to America....
My moneys on Besiktas
Good news finally we will see him play for a different club, very excited
I still can't digest the scenery of messi in another shirt 🥴
Everything went wrong for Barca from the coutinho and dembele transfer
They didn’t needed messi they got depay
Jokers 🤣 see laportes press conference.
Chelseaaa!!!!
Imagine if Messi goes to PSG and they still don't win CL😂😂
Bielsa will look after you, king. Only one thing bigger than a king and that’s a god. Which Bielsa is 🙏🏼
Aggrandisement is an actual word, it's just something that's conventionally used in an unflattering or negative way.
Please go to Juventus
no teams can afford his wages, and also a lot number 10 shirts are already occupied
Lets see what Mr.Loyal does🙄
The man who placed the club over everything although he himself being more priceless than the game itself.  Loyalty , Legendary, Legacy at the zenith. You are the People's GOAT and for me a GOD.
Good riddance
love to see messi with a fresh start in a new club
La liga tv deals are 📉
price of corruption finally came to pay
Now the question is which player is ready to sacrifice his number 10 shirt? PSG - Neymar Man City - Grealish . . .
Messi was a liability to the financial stability of the club, his fees were too high. Let's also acknowledge that Messi hasn't been the same over the last two seasons. We need some fresh blood, but non will come close to the brilliance of a certain Messi.
Poor Augero and Depay...
Messi , come to arsenal!!!!
We fans of Messi are also free agents now😂😂😂
It's getting hot at ManCity!! Be ready for he is coming!!😜😀😃
I really wished juventus would have afforded Messi
Messi to psg and mbappe to Madrid gg boys
There should be no exception for any Club
I smell something fishy here .
That sh…….t of course hurts 😥😥
We all deep down really want to see Messi in EPL.
OF CORCE WE SIGNED JACK AND NOW HE WANTS TO COME AS WELL
You guys thinking Messi will stay in a Bankrupt clubs is pathetic
Dan really needs to improve his vocabulary. Aggrandisement, to make something more grand, to enhance a reputation.
He is staying in Barcelona it's just a fake farewell. They want to put pressure on la liga
Where's the farewell ceremony? I call a bluff.
Calm the frak up. He's staying.
ESPN board panicking right now as all the LA Liga stars leaving after they picked up the streaming license
I Want To See Messi,Ronaldo,Neymar In One Club😍😍😍
Welcome to BVB 💪🏼
Basically you're saying that Barca wants the rules that apply to everyone else not be applied to them. Yeah, that checks out.
give the number 10 to Braithwaite!
Bollocks
No messi no barcelona
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
Bartomeu is the reason why Barca is in this situation today.
Cristiano Ronaldo is the greatest player of all time, and will always be, currently on 783 goals - he will get to 1,000 goals and retire❗💥🤛🏻❤
Messi was the reason I watched LA Liga.. I'm sad
Messi should go to Juventus. Yin and Yang should be together.
barcelonas financial strategy is to blame for his mess. its really embarassing to see this big club being run like that. handing out cash  for sub-par players and then blame la liga regulations. shame on you, barcelona management. you have no clue how to run a business.
Why don’t a PSG or City or Chelsea not just do a one year deal with everybody knowing it’s essentially a loan until Barca get their ducks in a row to go back down the line?
Chelsea FC new player
i think Shaka says the word "poorly'' better than anyone...... I just want to see Messi in the Prem because i think people will realise how good he actually is and i am pretty sure the GOAT debate would be well and truly over
If City get Messi, I'll hand the 21/22 Premier League trophy to them myself on day one, from an 'ex-Man Utd fan❗👀💥🤛🏻
I wish juventus sign him and goats play together
No matter who played, who leavs i will always be a barca fan... 😭😭🙏
I hope he goes to Serie A.  Hasn't he been connected to Inter before?
Never let your family manage your career. Kane is another prime example.
Barcelona have been managed horrendously, and something like that was bound to happen. They are lucky they are such an important club that they won't risk bankruptcy, worst case scenario someone would come to the rescue. That said, if Messi wanted to stay, he could, he would just have to work for minimum wage. He's already filthy rich, he doesn't need any more money.
Had a night to sleep on this and I think it's BS.  An arrangement will be made to allow Messi to stay.
now i feel sorry for barca
China like Iniesta went to Japan. This is a test to see if Messi would play against Barcelona he was so loyal to all these years. He's basically Catalan at this point.
Laliga is running Spanish football if it was a kingdom. High taxes, players personal info leaks. No to mention their lack of consideration and favor of to their start players. If this is really true, it’s a massive blow for Spanish football. It will never be the same agin ever
You disappoint me joules, you dissed over the idea of Ronaldo joining pag yet you jump over for pessy👎
I will never watch another la liga game if Messi is not at Barca!!!
ESPN sign 8 year deal to stream La Liga, all big stars jump ship, coincidence? 😂
Messi WILL NEVER GO to psg......... lol
Leaving Barca to where??
Certain clubs run themselves into the ground and take on huge debt = No problem Manchester City re-invest everything they make into the team =  Dirty oil money.
When you fill your trolly but have to put an item back.......
305 assists for Barcelona not 226.
Goodbye La Liga
Spanish league is finished tbh. Ramos, pepe, Messi, Ronaldo, zidane they are all of the scene now. I started watching laliga cz of messi abd ronaldo rivalry.
Yawn. He's obviously not gonna play in a competitive league so who cares?
Now La Liga will be dry af
Psg should publicly make an insane offer immediately .... probably we will know if this is a bluff or not
How are inter and United above chelsea the favourites for messi.
JULZ .......WAS RIGHT BUT ALL WRONG !
Then y write which club nxt if u all were sure about it
400mil on 3 players
What happened to China throwing money at players?
Messi playing in the same team as Ramos would be fun to watch
La liga is about to take a huge dive
La liga are totally in the right it's not fair to all the other clubs if Barcelona are allowed to skirt the laws but everyone else has to follow them.
Bartomeu really financially mismanaged this club
As a Barca fan I do not want Leo to go to psg
I think that joining PSG would tarnish his legacy as he would be joining one of the most stacked teams in history and play in ligue 1
Nice show
If Kane turns up for training I’m gonna be disappointed ✋🏻⚰️ I’m dying here 😂😂
When you see all this unfold and the Kane situation it shows how football has become some soap opera. Seasons not far from starting and teams have not sorted major transfers and contracts etc.  Players still on holiday.  What happened when clubs went on training camps,  transfers done and eveyone ready for season ahead.  Money has really ruined the beautiful game. It's a joke.
Without Messi barca will be a second division club but without barca Messi will remain Messi.
Instead of improving their lacking defense, they paid a huge money for an old player to stay in their team and look at it now Barca is in trouble
Might be worth chucking a fiver. On Barca winning the champions league, got to be the best odds in a while and he might end up staying anyway
LET US NOT WATCH LA LIGA
বারসালোনা এখন বলতেছে মেছিকে দরে রাখা যাচ্ছেনা তাহলে কি করেছে এতোদিন নতুন প্রেসিডেন্ট কি বেবস্থা করেছে এতোদিন সে কি লা লিগার নিয়ম কানুন যানেনা কেন আগে থেকেই কাউকে বিক্রি করে অথবা দলে অন‍্য কাউকে না ভিরিয়ে মেছিকে রাখলোনা বারসার প্রেসিডেন্ট তো এতো দিন বললো সবকিছু ঠিক মতো এগিয়ে যাচ্ছে মেছির সংগে কনটাকের বিসয়ে তাহলে এখন হটাত করে কি হলো মেছি কি ভাবে বারসায় থাকতে পারবে তাকি তারা চিন্তা করেনি আগেথেকে
The end of messi starts now
They acting as if Messi is not gonna retire someday. He is 34 years old for goodness sake. Let him go somewhere else.
Not so long ago, Barca were the blueprint for all clubs.
I watch barca because of messi.even 1.30AM kickoffs in india.
Imaging he signing with real madrid 😂💥
This might be a power play but he’s already left. It’s up to him whether he will sign something again which is very much a possibility he won’t because he has been wanting to leave for some time. So considering he’s been desperate to leave and now he has done so I don’t know if he will want to shackle himself to them again when it’s been so hard for him to leave
Without hesitation, if Manchester City will offer it to him, Messi should team up with Pep Guardiola again.....
You guys, let Lionel Messi! Every good thing eventually comes to an end.
La liga wouldnt be the same without messi .
if messi go to city, De Bruyne, Messi, Kane* Combination will out of this world. if messi go to PSG, neymar, mbappe, messi will be unstoppable
Now messi should join PSG
La Liga becoming less interesting. They will lose a lot of money.
Messi outscores all of mancity front line anyway
I honestly believe Athletico Madrid will win the league again this season I can’t believe what’s happening to Barca and Real right now.
Imagine if juventus sign Messi 😂😂
*Messi's Status Leaving Barcelona💔Is Uploaded In My Channel🥺Please Check It Out*
Go to Manchester City 🚀🚀
And the drama begins 😅😅🤣🤣
Imagine bringing in DIYing depay. For messi... 🤣. Banter fc now. Depay is rubbish i always said it and cant wait for him to fail and me to be right. He doesnt deserve anything he got. Utd wages and barca wages now... bigger scam than phil jones
That guy looks like Jerry gergich from parks and rec 😂
This Luis Garcia is not the brightest... He fits in perfectly.
Surely they will sort it out and he will stay
City
I hope depay will score and sell as many shirts and bring as much revenue as Messi now 🤡🤡
No blame to Messi please ..peopel who blame Messi 🤡🤡 I blame laporta and Laliga
He should play the Joan gamper one last time 🥺
He will go to Manchester United. how do bookies put inter ahead of Manchester United
It gave me a breath when at the end they all said Messi will remain at barca 😭❤
Barcelona cannot renew his contract  and football fans he has accepted ronaldo challenge!!!
Retire number 10 shirt,name camp nou after him and put his statue
Psg should give Messi a contract now ...I want to see him playing alongside Neymar , Mbappe and Ramos ...
messi going to Aston Villa to replace Grealish LOL
It's all about greed and money, probably best he goes to Pep City then.
Please don’t go to nazi premier league
We Messi fan are aslo free agent now😂😂😂😂
Chelsea should leave lukaku and go for Messi. City should leave harry kane and go for Messi. PSG should immediately let mbappe go to Madrid  and go for Messi.
La Pulga for money. Shameful, shameful...
So why is the headline Mess is LEAVING when all we know is he may be leaving. Such a waste of time listening to the "news".
Aston villa💪
Finally ESPN fake analyst some of whom never won anything are rejoicing Messi is leaving Barca. They wanted this for a long time. Bad for sports.
FINALLY HE LEAVES 🤡
Liverpool ❤️
With the departure of Messi, Barcelona is losing over a million supporters. With the leaving of some big names from the La Liga, I don't know how the La liga gonna be like.
It is very wise decision that leo did. He need better midfield squad, and assist maker's Like iniesta,  Xavi, & Dani alves did.
It was time for Lionel Messi to go. He should have gone last season. Barcelona needs to move on from Messi and rebuild the team. They have been too dependent on Messi. No one is bigger than the club.
Should come to Serie A.. in AC Milan or Inter Milan.. Ronaldo vs Messi el classico vibes 😍
aggrandisement is an english word
My heart is bleeding today .. I was never ready to hear this news.  Love you Legend Leo..love you Barca 💔
Finally the greatest player of all time. He will play in premier league it will be a joy to watch Cannot wait to watch him in premier league ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💪💪💪❤️💪❤️❤️💪❤️💪❤️💪❤️💪💪💪💪❤️💪❤️💪❤️💪❤️💪❤️💪❤️💪❤️
Actually might shake up la liga and make it a better league in the long run.
Gonna need part with Messi eventually, doing it now makes sense to me. New investment, advertise the league in a new way which isnt just big pictures of Messi. Edit: also giants have to fall, this is all on Barcalona so *uck them
I really want him to be at man United
City are gonna want him
They promised they will bring Neymar They said Suarez is their best forward They promised major signings to get trophies They promised Messi will renew blah blah blah
I think he should play for MUMBAI CITY FC in ISL
Maybe he goes to real Madrid 😅
Aguero and Debay got screwed big time 😂
Just imagine if City sells sterling, Benardo, Jesus and gets Messi and Harry Kane. 😳
its a "MESSI "affair lol
Are u guys joking??.. inter Milan ??
Its still possible to sign him if Barca can get rid of the big earners its still time before the transfer window closes never say never
Barcelona is making the excuse of "Laliga" knowing they can use the Messi card like always to fool everyone...They got loans and money to get players and pay wages and u forgot Messi 😂 I think they thought Javier Tebas loves Messi so he will allow Barcelona to break the rules. They knew about it and wanted Laliga to take the blame... Yet, They played with Messi again!!!
is it possible he can go to Real Madrid? Or even better Juve? imagine Leo and Ronaldo on the same team!
Messiiiiii🐐🐐🐐😁😁😁😁😁⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽psg🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's all down to revenue, and it's because of Covid 19
back to Harry Kane.....
Poor aguero. He didn't even want to leave man city... 😩
I think Laporte is playing 4d chess..
Ronaldo’s exit from the league was the end of the la liga
U gotta feel for Aguero, Debay and the new signings ... They signed their contracts....too late
Madrid is selling their players to balance the budget.... Barcelona is signing new players while they haven't renewed the contract of their main star ... What a disaster🙄
Ramos & Messi playing together at PSG....Ramos may foul Messi just out of sheer habit !
If La Liga wants to keep Messi, they should come up with a good reason, e.g. "Due to special circumstance caused by the global pandemic that creates special financial hardship for La Liga teams, we make an exception to the FFP rule to accommodate teams that are severely affected by the pandemic... [Insert exception rule]. The exception rule 'applies' to all teams in La Liga (LOL)."
If la Liga bends the rules for Barça again, we should take a stand and not watch the league, boycott it for the sake of football. Barça and Madrid will destroy the game we love if we keep letting them get away with stuff like that this
Barcelona is a corrupted club and i can't blame Messi. This is the worst way to leave a club... Messi was enjoying his vacation and arrived to sign his new deal, yet they told him sorry but we changed our mind...
A horrible decade for barca......xavi, iniesta , neymar, suarez, and now messi.
No player is bigger than a league or a club..and this messi saga has dragged on for far too long...he needs to sort out his priorities and man up...take a pay cut if you wanna spend the rest of your career at your beloved club or frickin leave....Drama Queen Messi suxxx
Joan Laporta played everyone to get to the presidency
Haven't Barca learnt their lesson, greed got them into this mess and this is just compounding it. Messi should just leave and prove that he is the GOAT by proving that he can succeed playing outside his comfort zone, Barcelona.
Aren't people getting bored of this now? Messi is never leaving Barcelona and La Liga will never allow it to happen.
Heard he’s heading to Wycombe
Can anyone explain me if no club can afford messi right now in Europe then how can PSG can afford him they already have Ramos , Neymar , Mbapee
Any MLS Club ?? Come ON ESPN FC what you waiting for ... sign Messi please
Wherever Messi goes he MUST wear the 10 shirt , take the free kicks and penalties and should even be Captain   Just like how Maradona was when he started to play in certain clubs
End of an era
Why did Neymar left Barcelona ? Bcoz he didn't want to play in messi's shade. So he joined PSG. Now Messi is in contact with PSG too. And neymar already sign PSG till 2025. LoL
*literally any player leaves* Jules : He'll join psg
The best player on the planet is a free agent now. Oh, Barca you're a mess.
BarceLEOna
Except Craig, ESPN really wants to cling on the idea that Messi is still not leaving.
THE end era Barca..😞
greates player of all the time my a**---this is why i hate E-A**-PEE-N
Arsenal
G O A T become scapegoat😡
I love Barca but Messi is my brother. I want him to end his career at Barca but I want him to win the last CL title before retiring more. So I hope he will join PSG, he will have a real chance of winning everything again. Look what happened when you wanted to leave Barca, he won a Copa. If he leaves Barca for real, he may win the Worldcup next year.
messi 😕😕😕 u hav soo much money it is ridiculous. play for free if u luv barca!!!
He ll b at psg 100 percent with pogba
Serie a is  next for messi maybe juventus
Messi will running out for Qatar 2022
i bet messi next team is manchester united.
I thought this guy extended his contract with barcelona
ESPN FC IN THE MUD, ESPECIALLY GARY LINEKER AND CRAIG BURGLEY
If this a power play between Barca and La Liga, then it's sad for Messi to be booted out in this fashion at end of this fiasco.   Also, a big disservice to the fans, who won't be given a chance to say farewell to greatest of all time, football has known.

La lega is gone......... 😄 No messi and cr7 El classico will be a comedy In india huge messi fans including me watching la lega because of Leo ❤❤❤❤❤ we also leaving the club👍
Haters(Craig and shaka🐮) are laughing
LOLiga on it's last legs 😂😂
Aggrandizement is an actual word
So the president of fc Barcelona failed
Is Sid Lowe on vacation?
Messi is Laliga
Come to PSG
Man City is best for MESSI
Messi....😖
A bartomeu Masterclass!
PSG has 1 French player in the first 11  😂
All these so called experts was missing the fact, that La Liga can’t make the rule change Barca is asking for without all the other clubs in La Liga approving it, which is why it won’t happen. Messi is leaving!
Laliga is cautious coz the other laliga clubs may sue the league for favoritism and selective application of the rules if they overlook barcelona's debt and wages.
LaLiga will lose the most if Messi leaves.
No technical doubts on Messi. Messi is a legend for Barcelona. Yes that's right. But not for the whole world. Until now just Pele and Maradona who are legends for the whole world. Both of them, not only technical quality, but also spirit, leadership, cooperation, adaptable. Maradona joined Napoly FC when Napoly was an ordinary club and the majority of the players were ordinary too. But Maradona took Napoly to became champions of Italian League. It's time for Messi to match Pele and Maradona. Join an ordinary club in one of Europe's top leagues and take them to champions of the league. Messi can join Aston Villa in England or Sampdoria in Italy or Hoffenheim in Germany or Rennes in French. I hope Messi can and will do it without thinking about wages because Messi already has a lot of money. If Messi can't do that, Messi is only great technically, but can't be called The GOAT. Just Pele and Maradona are The GOAT.
They make such a fuss on one player ,,players move on its happened for decades ,,is there not anything abit more interesting to rabble on about than messi ?
Literally no one: Every football fan's greatest dream : Messi and Ronaldo playing in the same team.😇
maybe aguero and depay and griezzmann will a superb trio
LOL. If Barcelona makes this decision based on the "cost" of keeping Messi, they may make a costly decision :). Think of how many Barcelona+Messi jerseys/shorts/shoes/etc. are sold around the world!!! If the revenue from selling Messi stuffs outweighs the cost of keeping him, then the club has made a costly decision.
If messi really wants a challenge he should come to Arsenal 😂😂😂
Welcome to Manchester united...
which team is he gonna transfer to maybe man city or PSG or maybe chelsea
He'll be going to Real Madrid 100%, haa haa
Messi's next club will be PSG or Manchester City, one of the two.
two goats of laliga are now gone but it is said that history repeats its self  maybe one pedri will become the new messi but will always support messi
He is more than a club 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
No Messi no barca unsubscribed barca youtube channel 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
REAL DIDN'T DO ANY BIG SIGNINGS FOR 2 SEASONS FOR THIS DAY🤣🤣🤣
If this actually ends up happening pogba will stay at united
it was all bcz bartemeu he kicked out suarez messi's best friend and signed players like pjanic while he should have tried to keep messi
If Man city haven't signed grealish, they would have signed Messi .
leo messi the real goat who ruled the laliga
no messi, no rolando , no neymar, no mbappe, no ramos!  La loga has lost his VALUE
Best career any footballer has had with any club ❤️ Best of luck GOAT
Sell Pogba an De Gea to clear wage bill for Messi?!
Guess people will watch El classico when they can they see Dembele and Vinicius Jr show off their talents lol, old guys like Pique and Jordi Alba walking on pitch, same gonna happen on Real Madrid midfield when they are getting old. People cant watch El Classico the same anymore
If he goes to PSG. The team is gonna wreak havoc.
That potential PSG lineup is really mad🔥‼️
Messi is going to man city for sure..Messi wil never go to psg because of ramos.
Go to juventus messi and ronaldo 🐐🐐🐐🐐
messi could become actual GOAT if he takes 1 euro as salary as he is too rich already no one can match that humble nature
Messi and Ramos wearing same jerseys 😂😂
Messi to inter milan?
The fact that none of the guys were able to see Messi at another club, really goes to show how insane it would be to see him leave.
The revenue are definitely going down!!! It would take a long time for them to recover from the mess they put themselves in
only if haaland and mbappe come to barca and madrid respectively, then only can the la liga be saved
laliga is doomed now... no new sensation there
It won't happen but if Tottenham or Aston Villa gets Messi with Kane or Graelish money it would be some plot twist and I'd laugh
Messi should retire, or go play in Argentina. Fail across the board.
Why not Kane AND Messi to City ??
100% Messi will play for Barcelona this season
Barca playing cards with Messi 😢💔 Who does that to their best player
I’m scared about messi’s career I’m a huge fan:(
Master stroke by bartomeu❤️❤️❤️😀
😠laliga and fcb
If Kane turns up for training I will be disappointed, lol Craig.
Signing new players but can't sign Messi, who should be the priority???
They got it for kicking suarez out
♥♥♥♥♥
♥♥♥♥♥
Doesnt messi have enough money to say “ hey dont pay me for a year”
Hmm, Ramos and Messi in the same team?
There's no Messi going to club where the #10 jersey is already taken. Think about it. Grealish, and Neymar both have it at their club
Xhaka is a ultimate joker
Why are people making a big deal out of this? Barcelona has Braithwaite!!
Messi to PSG  Messi be like : tera bhai aise team me jyga aise team me jyga kisi ne sochi na hogi 😂 PS:- Messi and Ramos will play in one team
Feel bad for Aguero, he went there for messi
This is going to get a lot of clubs  knocking on messis door because of that announcement offering him crazy money to join which will be a problem for barca as they gave Messi and excuse to leave with the statement.
Honestly,  Barca is nothing without Messi💔
barca can stop panicking, they forgot they have Martin Christensen Braithwaite
When u keep continuing with players like Pique, Lenglet, Roberto, Braithwaite, Pjanic, Umtiti, Alba on huge wages, then u don't deserve to have Messi in ur team. All the best legend. Atleast he can win some silverware some where else in his last three or four years. May be City or PSG.
Hahahahaha... he can generate money from nowhere.... if his salary is 71M€ per year.... how much did Barcelona earn from him per a year?????? And we are thinking that they will not find the way to pay him in those levels again... Messi is a Brand... He can sell whith or without them for another 3-5 years.... he is the biggest name in this arena... and world’s eyes are here....
Confirmed  90% fans of barca are now free agent psg qnd city are monitoring the situation and are looking to buy them 😂😂😂😂
I think ESPN you tube channel running on messy only.
He's coming to madrid. Like luis figo
So many things point at this being a power play by Barcelona. No one knowing or saying farewell, all of a sudden his stay is unfeasible, the underwhelming statement released by Barcelona, a press conference next day WITHOUT Leo present... this entire thing is just so odd to the point it doesn't make sense
Love you Leo♥♥♥
Coutinho and dembele be like 😅
Come to the Philadelphia Union Messi!!!!!
Manchester city and PSG are top club and without Messi they are capable of comepeting every trophy... but imagine without Messi the future of  BARCEL😭NA is in ****..
Loss of La liga will be much greater than expected due to messi exit as international viewers will definitely leave the La Liga with messi
messi should play somewhere else, it would be the best thing for football (minus barca)
No World Cup , No friendship with any other of teammates, selflessness on ur little assistant goals by others,
Messi De bruyne mahrez grealish sterling sounds scary
Can’t believe the greater player ever isn’t going to be in a barca top no more smh however where ever he goes I go,
Ramos in psg😕😕
i will again watch this after on 1st of september
Harry Kane saw the news and ran bare foot to the training he has been missing 🤣
Bye old messi , so happy 😀 day one ☝🏿.      u   r not a shining hero without Neymar and other key players,   It’s on time u should retire frm ground
no more balln o dor for Messi ,give it to Kante
Imagine the other French clubs thinking of the prospect of facing Neymar - Mbappe - Messi. Pure nightmare dealing with these players.
If *Messi* can leave *Barca* ... you think *SHE* won't leave you !!!
Covid delayed the salary cap start date until this year... this year Ramos, Varane AND Messi are gone atm. Along with Ronaldo a couple seasons back. Tebas really dug his own grave here... seriously he absolutely miscalculated that decision lol
I would want Messi to join Tottenham and wins them a trophy.
Barcelona is a case study. You can be rich, but if you can't manage money, then it will leave you. That is why Arsene Wenger was a great manager,  he kept Arsenal in the top 4 for 20 years at a stretch, on a shoestring budget.
Go to juve i really wanna see you and ronaldo play together.
Eveybody knows he’s going to the lakers , we all need Lerbon needs more superstars
This is the saddest 💔day in the history of football 😭
man city will probably sign him & not harry kane or so i feel.
LaLiga will lose so much fans. Im not watching anh games anymore. Wherever he goes I will watch that league😅
Messi is garbage now anyways, he can’t do what he did in the past. That’s why Barca is moving forward, it’s better for Barca.
Waiting Haaland and Mbappe in La Liga for the next decade rivalry after Messi-Ronaldo
If Messi join psg he may likely break his 2012 season record (91) but I would love to see Messi in inter or Chelsea I used to support before Messi era. 😜
Half of Barca fans leaving as well..
Bartomeu is the greatest Ckub President of all time. I wonder why Barca didn't keep him, he's awesome.
Hope city sign him for good
umtiti, lenglet , bartomeu and other old farts won .. we lost messi
Mukesh Ambani will bring him to Mohun Bagan!
One man destroyed the entire club ---- >Lord  bartemou 😡
Breaking news, Messi will play for Atalanta FC!!!!
PSG is getting OPAF
Messi should go to man city
Harry Kane will commit suicide if City sign Messi at the moment 😉
No messi no Barcelona for me...bye bye la liga
Aggrandizement is actually a word though Mr Englishman
Messi is a most controversial player ever.😂😂
in the end, it was griezmann that kick Messi out, and while city just bough Jack Grealish, i don't think Messi will go there, so i believe every big clubs in the world right now is shooting their best offer to Messi, Chelsea, Liverpool, Man Utd, Bayern, Dortmund, PSG, Inter Milan, AC Milan, or maybe, and i hope he goes there, Juventus.
Noone is gonna watch laliga anymore, a lot of online viewers are foreigners who just watch laliga because of Messi...Laliga don't know what they have done. They have lost India as a viewer which is going to cost them. We watch football just because of Messi. He made us fall in love with the game.
I will love for him and ronaldo to play for the same club if this is actually true. If this happens it will fulfill the dream of so many people.
To everyone that said messie was not better then cr7 well ur wrong. Look at the boom
Barca doesnt appreciate messi the way they should be, the fact their president was having issue with him is so embarrassing.
Luis Garcia is Poppet of Barca. Whole Espn Pundits are Fan Girl of Messi.😂😂
I know they were trying to get rid of messi and the did I cannot believe Barcelona let this happen
Nobody is going to watch Laliga if Messi leaves I can gurantee you abt that specially us from Asia. If we watch then they earn if we don't Laliga will disappear from the map of a league.
Barcelona just betrayed with Messi!
who will watch LaLiga now?
So you're telling me this current squad is over the salary cap but previous squads that were stacked were not?
this was all the work of one man
Where will his bandwagon go now that he's no longer at barcelona, his fans literally switched from Barca to City then back at Barca last year. "BANDWAGONS" Yet his braindead fans had audacity to troll Ronaldo lmao! Pathetic!!
If Messi joins psg and mbappe leaves for real Madrid and CR7 joins psg, imagine the front three - Messi, CR7 and neymar 😂
LA Galaxy lol
People are thinking that Messi will go to PSG or Man city or Chelsea at Max. But there are fair chances that he might actually end up at Liverpool. They have a great coach, they can certainly afford Messi and they need a no. 10
Pls messi don't leave barca 😭😭😭😭
HARRY KANE LITERALLY GOT ROASTED FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING XD!
I think if Messi wants to come to City the one that will be the loser is Kane. If that happens I think Kane will be staying ome 🤣
Most hilarious PRANK by FC Barcelona
Of course its remorseful but i think Messi leaving will give Barca an opportunity to build a balanced team that is not centred on one person
Is this true.. Barcelona 😡
Shaka is delusional
He should go to juve to play with cr7
Man he’s not going anywhere. You guys need to relax. This was just to put pressure on La Liga to accept the contract.
Gab does an interview in a sauna
Why does the financial and structural regulations prevent messi from staying in the club🤔🤔
Barca should have been offloading useless players long ago. A lot of players that should not have been bought to begin with. If they really wanted Messi to stay they would have done what was needed to keep him. This club has been a joke for the past 3-4 years now. N it’s not even about the ucl or losing la liga it’s been the useless n pointless players being bought n useless players overstaying when they have offered the club nothing. Start booting a lot of these players out, learn to cut your losses. Dembele has never given us an entire season, coutinho needs to go, griezmann needs to go n should not have been bought, aguero was pointless too, u boot out Suarez for being old n buy a 30+ aguero? Such madness
Josep Bartomeu has achieved the greatest thing in his life: destroying Barcelona in every corner.
Now this is the most emotional moment for Messi fans because without Messi Barca is nothing 😭😢😖
First Neymar, then saurez n now messi
He coming to Aston Villa
The world is really ending
Messi and Ronaldo brought modern attention to La Liga that's facts
Barcelona really let Messi walk away because they couldn’t sell Griezmann, Coutinho and Braithwaite.
Messi should go to PSG or IternMiami
Does Neymar want Messi?
So no one is gonna mention for a possible move to Juventus to play with Ronaldo?!
I really don’t believe it till I see him playing at another team
I wrote this on Goal's page on FB... Messi will remain a Barcelona player. This is all a power play/bluff.... a standoff. Think about it.... have you heard anything from Messi and his people? Screenshot this.
He should join juventus 😆
He’s not leaving Barca. It’s just a load of nonsense
Well with the new rules of La Liga NONE of Barcelona's new signings can even be registered. So...
A thought what if messi joins city and Ronaldo joins utd the Derby will be 🔥🔥🔥
I feel sad for aguero he came free for messi😂😂
omg...Barca...What are you going to...
This Is a blessing in disguise for Barcelona.
Chelsea next destination
As a barca fan am not against messi leaving ...barca isn't good enough for him
70% barca fans are free agent too
yehhhhh barkadogss going to under dog
imagine kdb n messi...lol
Ramos and messi 😂
ESPN just bought the rights to La Liga. ESPN REKT.
trying to blame la liga but the problem is how barca was so poorly operated....
Leaving messi will only make more losses to barcelona, cuz he is the single most big source of revenue 🤷🏻‍♂️
I tell you for the first time I'm seeing Craig doing fun 😂
where would messi go  and ronaldo ?? ronaldo in paris ?
Glasgow Celtic in line to sign Messi????
The host of espn is just a joke himself.... He is laughing all the time even in the worst day of all football fans...... He just enjoys mocking FCB. God help this human,give him some sense
Barcelona will suck this season.
Redemption for Barça will come with Braithwaite...remember that comment
He’s staying
It would suck to be Koeman rn. I wouldn't really blame Messi , hope he joins a club that has serious chances of winning the CL. Would love to see him win it again
Premier league is crushing other leagues
Thank you for everything you've done for this club, thanks for all the joy. Thanks for making me forget about all my problems for 90 mins. Thank you for proving that magic does exist. You'll be missed but wherever you go, I wish you luck. Gracias Leo💔
We.want messi in psg with ney mar  mbappe
honestly, I want him to win everything in last few years and get a glorious retirement.  so, messi to psg/city !
The fact that they still believe that Messi will be a Barca player... smh
he could play anywhere but psg ..
Well Barcelona will now surely suffer without him ffs. Maybe not as bad as 6th+ place since we do have griezmann and all these new signings but still...
BREAKING NEWS:  Harry Kane has decided to move back to Tottenham Grealish medical failed due to "unknown reasons"
Messi go to Manchester city
He should go to premier league. To city or Chelsea. Because there is huge competition. If he goes to psg. He can easily score and win the league there is no competition
I am very happy for Messi. He can finally win something to finish his career
CR7 gone.  How many people will really watch La Liga if Messi is also gone?
We are not Spanish. Ronaldo has gone ang Messi is following. Laliga would be nothing. We are going back to Serie A or Premier League or even to Ligue 1. For our beloved Spanish fellas, willy nilly they would stay with Laliga.
Shame on the Spanish!!!
There are only two loser in this one ESPN and BARCELONA. The rest of the teams and the world are enjoying it
CAMP NOU WILL MISS LEO FOREVER...
I think man City can afford him or psg..one of them
What goes around comes around. They refused to sell him when he asked for transfer now he’s leaving for FREEEEE. And I hope he doesn’t come to my Man CITY team I don’t want him there where he’ll come suck up all the team shine for his own glory. Stay away from Man City.
Greatest of all time? Stfu lol
He'll RETIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mbappe to Madrid and Messi  Psg
Lol, Jules is really touchy about Messi joining any club other than PSG :D
Chelsea!
An 18 minute video for a minute of what I wanted
Eibar relegated Messi left
Josep Maria Bartomeu should be taken to court
Josep Maria Bartomeu actually destroyed that club beyond repair.
How much money come if  another club sign messi,tshirt will be sold out,fanbase,sponsor will come.
Madrid biggest lose was never Cr7, it was Ramos all along. and La Liga losses Messi means losing beautiful football in the tournament.
Messi needs a break from Spain.
How funny is this the greatest player of this generation couldn't play for his favourite club because of league regulations 😆😭
Bye bye barceo  😂
I don't know how to feel about this. I love Barcelona and Messi and I think they belong with each other no matter what happens on the inside that drove Messi to want to leave last summer. But now he was willing to cut 50% off his wages just to stay at the club, and Barça couldn't even afford that. I guess it's the sign that they needed to see their separate ways if they still couldn't find a solution after months.   It's sad but exciting at the same time. It's heart breaking to see Messi leave Barça. But at the same time, I can't wait to see him donning a different club shirt and playing for a different team. And it's not because of anything about proving himself at all, it's just about new beginnings and a fresh start for him. I know he'll do well anywhere so I can't wait to see where he's going. I hope not in MLS though, or Argentina coz' I'm not ready for him to retire yet and choosing those destinations will mean just that. Hope he either goes to EPL or Seria A but PSG is probably one of the main clubs that could afford him.   PS: I would also love to see Barcelona do what they can do without Messi. They'll definitely struggle for a while, but they have enough young talents to come back from it. But La Liga will surely be dead now, having no Ronaldo or Messi to generate income. I wish the best for all the parties involved though. Messi will still be bleeding 🔵🔴 wherever he goes, that's for sure.
Go to Manchester United
I think this is a gimmick to force la liga to consider some leeway for the clubs in terms of wages. The fear of mission messi after losing ronaldo, ramos , varane could result in decrease in popularity of la liga. Barcelona are trying to exploit that fact
After psg hear this they will be like: BUY BUY BUY.
Dont think Donnorumma is going there to play second fiddle to Navas
I think I can now say this without regret THANK GOD I'll live to see messi in a different jersey yes I never ever thought he would leave barca but now let the world sit back and see him light up a more competitive league with MUCH MUCH better players around him and im not a barca fan imma messi fan barca has some of the dumbest management in football history and any team he goes to I'll support that team 100% I hope he goes to Manchester City or PSG
You know for a   fact that times have changed when you see Barcelona as  part of a list of Messi's "Possible next clubs" .
Messi is coming to England. A few years then to the states then to ..
The European super league should have been implemented this is now becoming chaotic. ..from Donnaruma Sergio Leo everybody is landing in Manchester or paris
Barca have become a joke, the earlier they let go of messi the better for other player. An end to an era, one of the greatest eras in club football
MC will get Messi. Pep misses him.
Psg
Now please bring him together with cr7 in one team
Man united should sign him
If he goes to PSG, it’ll look like my career mode team in FIFA 🤣
Imagine losing the best player in the history of your team because the directors miscalculates the budget and kept BRAITHWAITE instead
Whatever happens I want that Messi gets to play each and every single game of the season.
LMAO   FC Barcelona = Banter club   Good luck with your Super League xD
Messi is coming to city
we will follow messi
barca is finished without messi
Messi played his entire career in a lesser league surrounded by legendary players.  Hate my statement or not , it’s the truth
What if Messi join PSG with neymar
Shaka how did this happened to barcelona Bruhh Bartomeu 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Well now city in really interested in Kane they can't afford both I think Messi will choose psg. Pep or Neymar?
Look messi is  amazing and one of the greatest of all time.  there's absolutely no doubt. But I find it so funny how these ESPN pundits just casually mentions as in  jules n this video "the greatest player of all time" Like bruhhhhh chill there for a sec
I’ve never wanted these pundits to be more right about anything in the world. Messi is Barcelona and Barcelona is messi. They’re one of the same! Visça barça.
imagine messi go to juve to play with ronaldo
La liga on way to bankruptcy
he’s not going nowhere  this is just  mind playing game
No contract.he will copa..n barxa kick him then he will pick up world cup2022..its luck for messi...i m happy..goid luck take in messi
DC United will be perfect
I thought Barca paid players less bc everyone wants to play for Barcelona FC… but it was all a lie… and they still have to pay the balance of Coutinho’s transfer fee… Hahaha haha 🤡 🤡 🤡 !!!!
Barcelona already had a fall from grace, this isn't exactly doing them any favors 😬
I don't feel sorry them at all they've been bullying clubs for years with arrogance, their fans think they are untouchable, now it's time to humble up🤫
i will not see laliga again coz no messi there
At least we still have Lord Braithwaite, who just scored a banger against Salzburg😅 Hopefully Messi will stay
Reunite with Pep?
Ray Hudson is crying after hearing this news 😂😂
Please stay at Barcelona ♂ messi 🥺🥺
no one warch la liga now
Bad news for messi but there's a destination for messi, which is mighty blue 💙💙💙💙💙.. champions of Europe 💙💙💙Chelsea 💙💙💙💙
I don't think Barca should renew Messi, it's time to move on and actually give more youngsters and Bteam players a chance I was honestly shocked at the news but I felt a bit of relief.  Respectfully part ways.  I don't understand why we should sacrifice 10 players who are younger for one guy, 10 hyperthetically speaking and why is the board and the Spanish organization getting into it.  More reason for Messi not wanting to stay so they feel sorry for the team,player or streams and the income Messi brings to the league this will affect smaller teams and they will try to look into this problem like the Martin Braithwate signing which is unfair and will have further consequences.
Aguero : I can’t wait to play with you messi Messi : Umm, so about that..
He is 36, just PSG cares about old people like Messi.
La liga is going to be boring without a superstar
Messi got played by Barca..he gave his best and now being laid off..Novelty clubs like PSG could be suitable for him given his age, or some Serie A club.
The tried to play him by getting Aguero......
What if Messis plan is to cause a lot of noise around his name so he’s guaranteed another Balon’dor
I am not a Barca fan, but I still want them to retire Messi's jersey number. Even the fact that La Liga rules do not allow it but there is always a way around such instances
Todays discussing on ponit
All of the pundits at the end saying Messi will still be in Barcelona shirt in September implies they think this is a big political charade staged by Barcelona to have La Liga relax fair play rules but the club already having made official statements, made goodbye footage of Messi, former players having thanked Messi for everything he has done and Messi according to several reliable French tier 1 reporters having made contact with Pochettino at PSG suggests these pundits are in a state of denial like some fans themselves. It will be a farce if, with statements that have already been made and contacts initiated, these events are overturned again.
Gzzz so messi n barcelona couldn't agree on the money issue but what can we do money is money n everyone needs it
Maybe he should go to Man City since Pep cannot win a CL without him?  Win-Win.
Waiting for a day when barcelona will face messi in another club🌝
Gab shooting from his moms attic 🤪😂😂
Other clubs r happy now
Laliga rules on wages won’t allow them to register Messi anyway without sacrificing several first team players. When I heard that Barca will somehow negotiate with Messi, the first question pop out in my mind is “How is that possible financially?” (Since no news that Barca has cut off first team players). So yeah, this news is shocking but not that much.
What happened to the Naymar Deal?
Hopefully it's a bluff. Messi will not leave Barca and neither Barca will 🤞
It's best for Messi's legacy to prove himself in another league now that he's finally won an international trophy
Lionel Messi is not leaving Barca. Lionel Messi HAS LEFT Barca
barca without messi =shit club,
I hope he goes to Madrid.
Psg or Man city are the only options
Gogo real madrid !!!
Nobody gonna watch FC Barcelona farming game anymore. Where Messi there we are.
This was done on purpose.  Messi and Barcelona did this to save Barca face and Messi gets to leave
Downfall of Barcelona FC begins...they should never let go such a legend who did everything for the club to be the best club of the world
Messi deserved to leave Barça with the biggest tribute in sports history. A full stadium and the entire city of Barcelona singing his name. Not like this. :((
La Liga is very "Messi" :)
Breaking news.. athletico Madrid sign Messi for 2 years. MS reunite.
Lol Barca got aguero for nothing 😂😂
Mr shaka you are total mess only know how to criticise fcb go criticise who are spending 100 m on players and you people will cover la liga when no one watch la liga !! I hate this people
Goodbye la liga,
Best defender in la liga is Bartomeo. He single handedly beat Barca…
Lol, Thank God Football has more variables involved, if Messi goes to PSG, thats like a real life video game, that team is scary on paper. Thats like Golden State Warriors, when Durant went there. But thankfully, this more of a Team Sport. But if they get balance right, no excuses to be honest, Ligue 1 would just be a waste of time. Premier League have teams that can  beat that team in a one-off game.
Laporta using messi for his politics
La Liga will flop and he’ll stay, if he does leave, bye bye Barcelona
Mind games once again.  Go and prove that you can do it in other leagues, no faith from me.
BARCA WAS BUILT AROUND MESSI... FROM XAVI MESSI AND INIESTA TO M.S.N.   🐐🐐🐐
It will be good bye for barcelona for us fans as well. f ...k la liga , who will want to watch la liga after messi leaves.
Go to Villareal or another decent team like that and take them to the top of the Liga. Go for a challenge for once and not to an established winning team like PSG or City.🤷‍♂️
Man City: Hey wait a minute! Messi is available and free? Err Harry...
barca and laporta see they have leverage over la liga now. they can let messi walk and blow up the private equity deal. they have leverage so they're going to use it to try and get a better deal from tebas. normal stuff
I will wait on Sid Lowe 2 cents before i say anything
Just like how Messi won the Copa america as a free agent, just believe that now he will win the *World Cup 2022*
Next el classico  Vinicius vs Dembele  Nacho vs Lenglet  Goatwait vs Hazard  Alba vs Marcelo
Bruh. I was having a good day until I heard about the news.
La Liga is done guys 🤣🤣
Now laliga is Finished
Riots to start in 1,2,3.....
Que lo compre tigres uanl!!!! Gignac y Messi, ❤️
I'm not watching Barca without Messi..that's it.
He's not leaving. This is all a play against the La Liga rules. There is absolutely no reason why Messi can't sign a new contract with Barca tomorrow.
Hey G.O.A.T WE GOT YOU COME OVER BY THE BLUES WE HAVE MONEY BAGS 💰
There’s no bluff. It’s done, he wanted to leave since last year. It’s over.
Messi to juventus link up Ronaldo
Why is everyone mad at la liga like dude the rules clearly states max spending and max wage cap. Now you all want la liga to bend those rules for only one or two clubs which are the only ones that are braking those rules, what about the smaller clubs who fallow those rules and even if they try can’t reach such ridiculous wages. 🤦🏽🤦‍♂️
Why everyone is focused on Mess's next club ... what if he decide to retire ... just another possibility
I love Craig, he just does not care what anyone thinks gives his opinion and you can shove off! Lol love it. I always watch his vids
When I first heard the news I thought, OK Barca is in deep financial trouble and the major component of that is team wages. Messi and the team are doing the responsible thing and parting the company to help the team out of the financial abyss they are in. Then to hear it's part of some behind-the-scenes power play is very disappointing but given the news the last few years about how Barca is run not surprising. Honestly at this point, if I were Messi, if they are going to treat him that way then he should direct his agent to start looking into other potential teams to move to, if they have not already so he can escape the mess the team has become.
If not Barcelona... I just want man City to sign him... Want to see him in EPL....
I was never ready to hear this news 💔
Messi should have left Barcelona a long time ago because he completed a cycle like Pique, Busquets or even Iniesta. Furthermore, I think Lio is a great football player but not a good leader, whereas CR7 is a great leader who's able to take his team ahead in the toughest times of a football match, so this is what makes the difference between both footballers. So BBVA league will be the most harmed by Messi's exit.
At one my club signed grealish and at other this news is really heart breaking
this is same situation as cr7 leaved real madrid but this was unexpected :()
As a Barca fan I am devastated 😭 but on the same hand I really wanna how they play without Messi
psg
Another media scare perhaps!
Espn has bought a Chan Fries. Wonder why BT would rather show Ligue than la Liga.
Is this real? Wheres he going?  PSG or City?
no ronaldo no messi no neymar no ramos  not so long we can say no suarez no greizman  without them laliga is nothing
Come to City and Kane to United with Chelsea getting Lukaku and let the game began.......😂😂😂😂😂😂
How will el classico be without messi ramos varane ronaldo?
Lol Craig loves city so much he really wants to see messi go there
Why don't they call the Barca saga cheating. You can't change the financial rules just to keep a player. Tebas and Laliga are a complete joke, UEFA should step in if Tebas changes the wages rules.
I think were seeing the second coming of the best attacking Trident in Football History M n M Messi Neymar Mbappe
No Messi no Barcelona. Bye my favorite club. Where Messi goes is where I would be charing and buy the new Jersey new Messi. Barcelona shame on you.
Goodluck G.O.A.T
Messi and fcb are drama queens,believe me,messi is not leaving barca,barca and messi just making pressure on la liga and after some days drama,fcb will again announce messi is barca player
And Agüero had just gotten here 😭😭😭
Laporta's one decision > bartomou's whole career 🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂
Messi is getting old. No player is bigger than the club. Barca need restructuring and if letting  Messi go could save the club from bankruptcy, they should go for it.
Childhood finished officially 🥺😭🙃
its fake
I love this channel ❤️😂
Imagine Ramos playing with Messi in psg and Ramos slide tackles Messi in a momentary lapse of concentration
Yooo Messi just fuckinh leave!!! Stop dicking around !!!! Barcelona is done and dusted !!!
Nooooo messi
He’s gone.   Bayern can pay him 30MM to play plus royalties on his name.
In reality La liga will adjust rules !! They will lose viewerships and sponsors.
After 17 years he’s going to do some charity volunteer work in MLS in Seattle. Bless you, messi
Where are those that were previously commenting on Barcelona's finances being overplayed and that he was going to sign again with Barcelona? 😂
Great so lewandowski for the ballondor
Leaving barca social media
Funny how La Liga's ffp were soooo strict to prevent any other team from competing with Barca and Real. Ultimately led to Barca's demise.🤣🤣🤣
espn seem like they are desperate for Messi to stay at Barcelona because they cover La Liga...
Gone but not for got
Chelsea for sure 💙.  Mark my word, he would love to play with young team rather than team full of celebrities like PSG.
the only upside of this is messi doesnt have to wear that shitty jersey on 😂😂
Is unbelievable
I think Barca did everything wrong from managing the players wages including messi, to buying shitty players to the squad letting good players go and not recruiting messi's player request . Idk if messi is leaving cause of his wage specifically .. that would be kindof eye opening since I'm sure hes made enough money to end world hunger globally ..
ESPN signs deal with La Liga and same year, Messi, Ramos and Varane leaves. Nice
Ramos and messi . De bryune and messi . Kante and messi. Bruno and messi
Kind of want Messi to go to PSG just to have MnM up front
Jack grealish suddenly fails his medical 👀
la liga is OFFICIALLY DEAD.
Some guys in this panel have too much imagination. The club already gave official statement. It's done. Messi is leaving. There is no other way.
Barca always find talent.
Dear Ronaldo, Please come to Man Utd.  Dear Messi, Please come to Man City.
0:41 "Aggrandisement" is not "Spanglish", it's a legitimate English word. And it's not that rare either. Surprised that you don't know it.
Let's not forget the real loser here, Harry Kane.  Man spent the whole summer twerking for City, and now Grealish has taken the #10 shirt and with Messi being available, he might not even be their first priority!  Oh and his "childhood" club absolutely despises him now.
Messi, Neymar, Mabappe can it be more orgasmic than that
It's not a step forward for anyone, whether is Barcelona or any other team, he is in the back end of his career, his best is far behind him, so not sure what all the fuss is about
I wonder when this happens does Real go:  “Nah he’s a rival we don’t sign him. Good luck.”  OR  “Seems like a very good signing no? Messi the next Galactico let’s go let’s go!”
if mbappe goes to real madrid la liga will be just fine
This is the day I stop watching football. It’s all about money and state owned oil clubs with no tradition. I’ll go support local sports clubs from now on
Messi to Juventus ... football legend's retirement home
Imagine going to PSG and Poch will still manage to bottle it...
Basically Leo is now overqualified for the soccer world 🙂
This news also got Man city owners like 😳😳😳😳😭😭😭 they just bought grealish why the earth barca would not say it one or two days earlier 😁😁😁😅😅😅😅
Now FCB is now gonna fail without Messi
No messi ronaldo La liga is cutting its branches 😳😳😳 no one wud want to watch la liga matches...they r cutying their revenues
Messi fan and family wishes to see him in English club
Columbus crew can afford Messi. We got billionaire owner.
Laliga official dead today
Retire the Jersey number 10
blame previous regime with overrated signings  of dembele, griezmann and coutinho = at least 400m euros wasted with no legit success and thats only their transfer fee.
lmao man city gotta be frustrated for getting grealish a lil bit too early
No way PSG is keeping Mbappe and Messi at the same time
Messi to ManC and ronaldo to ManU will be the greatest thing happened to football
Bye  bye barca bye bye laliga we are leaving too
Lord braithwaite : "finally it's time for me to shine😤😤😤😤"
Gaby right on the money as usual .
Sid Lowe is the happiest person in the world about this
No Messi and aguero.....
I predict Barcelona to not finish top 4 in the upcoming season
Bartomeu is by far the greatest legend in the history of Real Madrid.
If this is a power play...that simply makes the whole stance of Barcelona even more unethical basically asking other Laliga clubs to compromise for a player. No player, not even messi is more important than even the smallest club in laliga.  But sadly that's not how modern football works.
its sad that Messi ends like a greedy guy just wanting money.....sad.
Messi is going to Leeds United
Look, even if Messi goes to PSG, they still wouldn't win a Champions League title. That team is cursed.
“Any MLS club 11-1” lol yeah…Messi will be sporting the black and gold Columbus Crew
Man City rushing back to Aston Villa to return Grealish be for the 30 day trial period expired 🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃💨
Messi welcome to Manchester United
Amusing seeing arrogant barca fans expecting LaLiga to bend over for them. Face the facts, the world dont revolve around barca if LaLiga wants to help barca they will have to answer to the other 19 clubs to justify for the special treatment towards barca. Looking at the predicament barca is in, they had it coming and deserved no special treatment.  Karma
Messi to city, ronaldo to man United next season will be dope af
I love that Craig Burley struggles to name more than a handful of MLS clubs
PSG is trying to copy the Lakers.
Espn trying to hold it together.. but sorry its not a buff
The temporary interviewer classically agree because friend certainly rule apropos a second-hand bite. vacuous, symptomatic battery
It's man utd chance to get both the names of goats in their history books🥰🥰... As man utd cannot afford fees but can afford any wages and signing on bonus.  But the issue again is it will affect the transfer plans of next season.... If they think of siging halland...🤦‍♂️
I have the same feeling when Michael Jordan left Chicago Bulls. I stopped watching basketball then and I believe I will stop watching football now.
I don't care who they have on the roster whether they're contract is up or not, you cut them and you sign messi 🤦
La liga is loosing its star slowly slowly its giants are leaving. Neymar, Ronaldo, Ramos now Messi. La Liga has lost its total 80% revenue in 4 Yrs 😂😂
How about Man City?
This is all Bartomeu’s fault.
Messi is going to PSG after Mbappe is announced at Real Madrid. _This transfer window keeps getting more exciting_
LaPorta thought this was 2010 and he still had that clout to push everyone around. Screw him.
I see this as a win for everyone involved. Messi will be happier, and Barcelona will be able to help out Koeman the most. Will Koeman succeed? Most likely not, he won't last another season.  Messi is 34 years old however, he's going to leave anyway. Would he have preferred to retire at 36-38 years old with Barcelona? Most likely but the club was going downhill since they signed Ousmane Dembele to "replace" Neymar.
many club secretly wanted messi to sign for city so they would be forced to sell bernardo and laporte. what a disaster that would be
Living in the US, it would be awesome to finally see more of Messi since NBC covers games so I hope he joins the Premier League
Barca basically waste 1 YEAR of this man amazing career they should've been sold messi last season and made 100 million + from city 💀🤡🤣🤣
Not a bluff ... Messis father is already negotiating with PSG ...
Why they all saying at the end barcelona when he read the barcelona statement it says his no longer a barca player they ready gave best of wishes to messi and to his family. Why will messi stay after all that he is a free agent now could go anywhere he could still get good wage for his age. Legend deserve better.
Jules REALLY doesn't want City to join Messi 😂
No!
At the moment barca cant register depay, aguero, eric, emerson.. and this is no joke
We never hear from the horses mouth.
Barcelona is a club of idiots. How in the world you let the greatest of all time go just like that smh 🤦🏽‍♀️
LMFAO Jules is a class act
La Liga is officially dead the premier league is now the best league in the world
"he's not going to the Portland Timbers" 🤣🤣🤣
Football has officially turned into a real business, messi and ronaldo alone made la liga real and barca billions of dollars and they did both players very very dirty in the end smh, i can honestly say when messi leave I'll never watch another la liga game
What's up messi FC mother fuckers still thinking he is going to stay 😂
No one else think Man Utd or Chelsea have a shot at this deal?
messi is going chelsea mark my word
Messi leaving La liga is going to cost them more money
These idiots spent weeks saying Messi was definitely staying and now that its official that he's leaving they're STILL saying its all a bluff?! HAHAHA. Wait and they say PSG can have Mbappe AND Messi? lmao PSG will sign Messi, no doubt, but they will sell of Mbappe. Save this comment
Psg and Man city are ruining football
What if Chelsea came out of nowhere. Messi + halaand .
Barca is a mid table team now
Shaka said I’ll believe it when I see that Messi won’t be playing anymore for Barcelona 😂😂😂😂😂😂 like the dude literally is no longer under contract for Barcelona and he’s just negotiating a new deal like how is that not proof 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Real did "Ronaldo" bad in the end Barca did "Messi" dirty in the end smh 😢 it'sa sad day for football
Barca chose to ignore the rules, I dont feel bad for them they fucked up big time
I’m surprised that Messi leaving Barcelona
Blah, blah, blah. These cable pundits always guessing and speculating.
Messi is gone just accept it
Latinos are bad at mathematics
That’s  time for everything Barca fans should accept that and move on . From a die hearted real fan
Watch him retire
Watch ESPN FC analyst make me feel like I could do anything in life
He should go to Juventus 😎😎
Messi to PSG and Mbappé to Madrid
Messi is very reluctant to move too far due to his children are very very happy in Spain. No US, No China as its too far. England is an hours flight for his kids and wife, who'll probably stay in Spain.  PSG or Man City. Chelsea and Man U is a stretch.
Please go to Man City.
I’m still surprised that Messi is leaving Barcelona even though I’m Real Madrid fan
Europa league 2021/22 winners FC Barcelona. Lmaooo Ansu Fati and Pedri gonna have to step up now.
He might just retire.
these guys don't know nothing about football
Messi…to Juve. That would be epic!
Time to join messi and ronaldo in the same team.
I have a strong feeling he’s not going anywhere
I don't think messi will play with any EPL team
April Fool Day!!!! Messi would never leave Barcelona. Watch, you will see.
I know its rules but Messi basically Is the la liga that is a dumb move by la liga
For me if he doesn’t stay at Barca he’ll definitely go to PSG or Man City! BUT I’d love to see him at Man Utd!
Messi not going anywhere, all you people getting sucked into the "poker" game going on 🤣.  Messi got it toooooo comfy at Barca, than try anywhere else now.... HE STAYS 100%!
HALA MADRID
It’s not a power play lmao
He’s coming to Chelsea
Signing Dembele, Griezman, Countiho with ridiculous fee and they let vidal go out for free, rakitic, suarez for almost free as well. Definitely super bad business. Oscar Grau need to do something to clean Bartomeu disaster and still dont know what his contribution since he join barca
If you can't make your setup more professional (Gab) and put on a decent shirt... then don't log on.   How ridiculous does he look hunched over in his attic.  Pathetic.
What number is Messi going to wear at psg if he does go there...
So now man city is the best team in the world now 😂😂😂😂
*The MLS is interested in hiring him*
Just come to arsenal
PSG
I didn't understand anything, everything is Messi.
Craig is great ...that last line" (if kane returns to training) im going to be dissapointed" was hilarious😂😂😂
Pedri, puig, ansu, demir and gavi are our future. Gavi will be our next messi watch!
PSG
FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY ON VACATION🤣🤣🤣 JUL IS A SAVAGE
It’s a joke! For me is a total joke!  I am not a Barca fan BUT I am a Messi super fan! If he leaves the club for MONEY.... Big disappointment! He made for 17 years over 50 million euros/season and he can’t play for a lower wage than 71 million that he earns now???? !
The end of the video was very emotional🥺
If i had that money i give barca to hold him for 1year ..men so sad...lets hope somethings comes up
This whole salary thing should honestly be cut in like fourths. Messi must stay at barca bro
It's not a power play. Trust me on that.
Kane for Messi.
Eibar gets relegated. Eibarman leaves.  No coincidences.
Burley is a clown
Don't see why clubs like Madrid and Barcelona should be bailed out off debt. You don't see that happening to the lesser teams . I'd let them fall like the rest that have due to money problems
The real question is what does Messi really want?? Honestly for two years now Messi has been a problem for Barcelona with eternal uncertainties about his future contributing in the club's instability. If he truly loves Barça let him leave and allow them progress once and for all and if he is behind all this saga then shame on him.
Messi is coming to man city 🙏🙏😭😭🤩🤩🤴🤴
Lionel messi to Real Madrid
La liga has been overrated for a while.
Barcelona will loose double the amount of money than they have to pay Messi as a salary as most of the Barcelona supporter is just because of Messi.. Barcelona have no idea where the club will be without Messi.. they will need a decade or more to recover this loss..
He will go to PSG and they will still choke in the Champions League.
Every summer, Barcelona releases a new series of their famous sitcom. Season 4 might be the best yet.
the fans who said Messi can't do it outside la liga wat if he joins PSG & they win d UCL thereby putting a flaw in ur logic. Then wat would u say then? He should've joined toulouse to prove himself?
Messi knows his value. Why should he have to take a pay cut. If not for him Barca wouldn't have won the Copa del Rey last season.
I'm with Shaka in saying that if PSG have Messi, Mbappé, and Neymar and don't win the Champions League, football has failed  🤣🤣🤣🤣
All other transfers deal are on hold because of Messi being free agent.
Barcelona biggest mistake not to let Messi go last year as they could have sold him over 150M. But Messi leaving for free it's a shame
La Liga is dead. No Ronaldo, Neymar, Ramos, Varane and now Messi. Massive blow to Barcelona and la Liga
Come on United bring Messi next two seasons he will b perfect 👌
Financial fair play in holiday
Barca fans: we need 2 motorbikes Barca: buy 4 cars!!
Dan Thomas! Smart sport coat, mate!! 👍
PSG…! The new trio MNM …!
Boy I bet man city are unhappy they could have signed Messi instead of Grealish ……go get Messi Chelsea
I'm sorry, but I was not letting Messi off the phone until we came to some sort of resolution. Even if that meant me calling other players and telling them we have to release them on the spot
i wonder what barca fans there would be rioting toward stadium and shouting: save messii 😭
The only ones that don't have to abide by FFP - City or PSG
If the pundits think that Messi will stay at Barcelona in Spetmber 1, what is the point of all this debate. Iknow he gets paid a lot of wages, and clearly Barca can not do it under the laliga rules. So why is everyone predicting for Messi to stay at Barca?
pep will be happy to bring him to Manchester city
Signing Dembele, Coutinho, Griezmann and selling Suarez. Worst managed club in the history of football. Barca will become AC Milan now.
Barca made priority signing other players first and let Messi contract expired, betting on the fact La Liga will make exception for Messi as he alone draws in massive viewers around the World to La Liga.  The other way around, priority Messi first then sign other players would be much harder, as there is no chance La Liga make exception for anyone not named Messi.
He’s coming to Kansas!
Please come to Everton fc ..lmao 😂😂😂
Messi not gonna play for Barça for eternity people gotta get on with it. 16 Years at barca 4 champions League 10ligas they made enough profit of him.
It's been a long time coming. Messi should have left 2years ago,
He’s going nowhere. This is just smoke and mirrors. Tebas is going to get outmuscled
Messi to NAPOLI at his hero's field Diego Armando Stadium
Even after an official announcement they all picking Barca LMFAO such is the love Messi has inherited in Barca.
Inter is on the list because he wants to play against Penaldo again ;)
So Messi goes to City and Ronaldo returns to United and we have the rivalry again in EPL
Bet the other 19 la liga clubs are relieved messi is leaving as they wont need to face him again
Inter Miami
You can’t blame the current board of fc Barcelona, the previous board is a true disaster, their poor management to the club cause a significant financial decline, now wages and salary of the player cut short and most importantly, they lose the goat and nothing they can do about it because of wage ceiling 😡😡
PSG or ManCity
No Messi No La Liga
Psg ☝️. Good luck messi
He's going to Juventus to join the real GOAT CR7
Navas? Come on now lol
Barca spent all YEAR trying to convince Messi to stay . Now he wants to and they CANT . Sums up the club
I think if City didn't sign Grealish yet then they should go for Messi and Kane over Kane and Grealish
Messi - Guardiola reunion in the works?
ESPN has 8 year deal for La Liga coverage in US and now this happens. No wonder they are pushing this chess game theory. They got massively fucked this time !! LOL
FINALLY WOOO
Who’s gonna watch Barcelona without messi?
that list is wrong. PSG, and surprisingly both Man United and Arsenal are legitimately the only clubs that can afford to sign Messi with all realistic factors to consider. PSG the only to have to move a player to make it happen (Mbappe to Madrid is a no brainer )
City forget Harry Kane!!! get Messi. Turn this league into a farmers league
Messi was desperate to leave. Maybe this excuse was the plan all along to let him go without the club getting the blame.
Any MLS Club 🤣🤣🤣 I get that this is a US based show and they gotta appeal to this market but.... 😂😂😂
He should go to the club of his dreams.
Watch Messi go to Atletico Madrid with Suarez
What a Catalan mess
@11:50 I honestly believe Gab has no idea what he is talking about. Inter are in a financial crisis, but Messi would be an investment, regardless of how high his salary would need to be. When you get Messi, you get a lot more than just a football player, just like what happened when Juventus got Ronaldo.
Barcelona is falling down in terms of morality. It will lead to them disaster.
Messi is irreplaceable at Barca..
To be real, Messi is part to blame. He is obviously trying to twist the arms of Barca & La Liga to get what he wants.
Barca without Messi is gonna be soooooooooooooo weird....will he get a proper farewell?
Relax guys. He isn't going anywhere. You'll see many stories now, many cooked up as well. But in the end you'll see him scoring those free kicks for barca again.
I saw Messi play in 2006 and people were saying this kids suppose to be good. After everything that’s happened I can truly say I feel privileged to have been there
La liga really did shoot themselves in the foot. They have 0 big names now other than maybe Greizmann & veteran hazard. Mbappe was supposed to come, Messi was supposed to stay, Holand was thinking of joining and now they got no one. Goodbye revenue. You guys are a joke now.
I’d be interested to see Grealish, Kane, and Mahrez/Silva/Sterling against Neymar, Mbappe, and Messi…
Craig Burley is one of the worst football pundits in the history of the game. He offers nothing insightful or valuable to any conversation. He is solely there to be negative but it doesn’t work at all. Burley never even did anything in the game. Terrible.
I really hope he doesnt go to the MLS, cause he is too good to be at that trash league
As soon as ESPN got broadcast rights to La Liga, both Ramos and Messi left the league   *Cursed*
Real question is where are barcelona getting 40 plus goals n 15 plus assist from?
Messi whatever you going we’ll follow you it’s ok?
messi doesnt fit anywhere else he is too great for the poor france league and prepmier league isnt messi s  style, he loves barcelona city he loves club barca and he loves the football barca is playing he grown up in this team he wants to end there, also la liga needs him
so barca is rich now huge salary off the books
If this really is some kind of powerplay between LaLIGA and Barca/Madrid, I support the LaLIGA. Teams cant go around skirting the rules just because they are financially ahead of others, it makes for unfair competition and poor sportsmanship. GO LaLiga.
To Juve beside CR7
Pat MacAfee was picking on the Timbers today too😭What did they do to y’all
Messi better start learning his French, welcome to Paris!!
Bet hes going to psg
On the PSG 11 they started navas instead of donnarumma?
Harry kane is like I finally try to force a move and messi is a free agent lol 😆😂
Lol I said that wasn't going to happen 😅
He is not going anywhere people don’t panic
Barca need to learn from Papa Perez that guy would sell his own child at the moment to save money ,We all know this guy is going nowhere they just calling La ligas bluff for the "salary cap" rule they just introduced , if they so scared to lose Messi sell everyone else around him right now as in tomorrow , start clearing up some money now, start with Griezmann right down to Pique the high earners, fire the assistant coaches, start retrenching staff there's no money
Messi is heading to CA Osasuna
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I hope man city picks him up, cuz we need a champions league, plus well have my fav player on my fav premier league team
Finally!!!!
If Messi wants to win again PSG is the best place.... Imagine him and Hakim on the right side and mbappe through the middle and Neymar left side while veratti being the playmaker
Why cant Shaka understand that it is mainly the pandemic that has caused this? Barca makes tons of money from sport tourism, which was essentially destroyed because of covid.
So messi's salary is too much!! But you can support big  salaries of a list of losers who never play...??
ESPN the La Liga deal screwed you but as long as you don't post about the USWNT you'll be okay. I'll send you some resources so you can coupe
I wish if I can see Leo Messi play for Liverpool in the current Jurgen Klopp amazing team
will be so good if messi ends on real madrid lol
Imagine messi ronaldo neymar play together😊
Join man city
Luis Garcia is boring.
I guess I'll put off my move to Barcelona... Paris is lovely year round, i hear
The only clubs i can think of are City and PSG. Not sure if Bayern would pay his huge salary. And i dun think he want to go to Italy
After this whole discussion they all still predict him to remain at Barcelona
AUPA ATLETICO
He's not leaving, this is Barca playing a political trick to La Liga federation.
The Messi clan is greedy, especially the father Jorge.
It's a high stakes game of Chicken.
Reported that chelsea will launch final bid for lukaku today or tomorrow, if that news didnt come out, then chelsea might turn to messi
I'm so sad I can't continue  following this club
Join city please! I wanna see messi playing as a pure false 9 again, not messi as a winger.. Pep is the Only manager who really knows how to maximize messi's ability
The tagline for that should’ve been white Shaka said…” if this lineup does not win the champions league… football has failed”
Wow all the sudden . I head in morning he was to play until 2026.This morning ? Nice Italy fantasy league Messi but yk man city ,manchest , psg maybe ?
The race for his signature comes down to wether Tavares caves before PSG get a contract together!
As an honest Barcelona fan, I am happy we are not renewing dictator Messi’s contract. In the last 4 years, he has taken away €500m from my precious club and only has hat tricks against Eibar to show for it. He has left us bankrupt and I want him out of my club ASAP!!
They need a superteam to beat Ronaldo!!! Lol
If u want to blame some1 for this cruelty. There’s only one man, Bartomeu
Do people realise how many people and businesses are affected by him leaving la liga lol.just cant imagine the club itself and the people the city that are used to with his presence
No next club for Messi. La liga and Barca power play. Will be resolved. Don't get excited PSG and City fans!!
If la liga doesn’t want to restructure their rules to compete against their European rivals they very well will have the greatest footballer that ever kicked the ball kicking it against la liga. Because their rivals will pay, not to mention he won’t be the last player to go.
La porta probably knew messi was leaving he just wanted to get all the sponsorship deals agreed and the free players by using messi name😁
Omg I just looked 🤣😂😂 the fc barcelona channel has lost 300k subs so far in 5 hours 😂😂 really shows the plastics that support my club gutted about the departure tho
Messi is going to get the Beckham deal from the MLS and play for LAFC or the Galaxy for a couple of years and then become owner of the San Diego team.
So basically Laporte and his team are just as stupid as Bartomeu was and they were essentially trying to blackmail LaLiga into letting them break FFP rules so they could keep Messi…got it
I hope he doesn't retire because he's upset/disenfranchised.... can actually see him thinking "you know what i'm 34, im guna not bother"
he should go play with CR7 just so we can see them play together. that would be something.
He had a great run in Barcelona
Wow i love you Barcelona
can he join mancity or PSG OMG .
You all have got it wrong, messi is leaving 100%🤝
Let’s be honest now!Messi is the only reason that majority of fans around the world still watching Barcelona or La Liga,especially when Ronaldo left!!Spain and Barcelona just lost a lot of tickets for  stadium,flights,hotels,restaurants,Transportation,commercial ,sponsors,Jersey sales,tv deals ..😝😝😝😝
After all the money he made, he can't play for free?
It's about time! God luck Leo.  Otumfour Kojo Agyemang
Messi clan will issue the statement that they are suing Barcelona. They still want the money.
The end of an era. 😢
Messi is one of the all time greats and greatest in his own generation... but this game is team effort before everything else, Messi was on the pitch in all those Barca european humiliations crowned with 2:8 and 71! million per year salary are simply ridiculous money. Blaming Barca trying to sign players who wont play for free  to improve themselves is stupid. what, they will field Messi and  the goalkeeper and everything will be fine? Plus the little god of football is not getting any younger. those pundits are talking like Messi have 10 years ahead of him playing on this level which is already significantly lower compared to the 25-7 years old Messi.
Messi and Barça are playing chicken with La Liga!
Bro, you really never heard of "aggrandisement"?   It's not "a little spanglish" it's just english, it means to increase in power or importance, you can look it up. You really think Barcelona doesn't have fluent english speakers on staff for something this important?
ESPN/Disney bribe check to La Liga got lost in the mail
Al Asad Fc  is perfect for him
They already said goodbyes to Leo. How will he be back to Barca?
Messi to leeds with bielsa.
The Bartomeu disaster. Signing useless players every other year, offering ridiculous wages to every single player. Barca needed defenders for past 5,6 years at least. What did they do? Kept signing forwards. Barca Logic…
Griz is the happiest person in Barcelona right now
Even if it is bluff Barcelona knew the rules
I think Barcelona don't want Messi again his wages is too much
Such a shame that Messi won't get a farewell from the Barça fans at the Camp Nou.
Imagine Messi and Ramos in Paris best friends who would have thought it lol.
Man City🍻😍🍻
A player so expensive there's really only 3 clubs who can afford him. How silly is that.
Bartomeu has really done the most. He's like a virus you can't literally free yourself from.
Tebas has Shot Himself in the foot with this, If Messi  somehow signs for Barcelona in a miraculous way  Beating the Excess limit salary cap of Barcelona, They need to be Investigated for Financial Fair Play... The world is watching. He was throwing stones at Man City & PSG, Lets see how He Handles this one. Barcelona has been cheating financial fair play for quite a while, Covid 19 exposes them, Considering they did not win major cup competition to cover up their Excesses. 2 years in a row, they did not win La Liga, coupled with Covid-19, With that astronomical wage Bill. Players Devaluating without Value for money. Messi Above 100m a year in salary,Griezman 865k per week, Dembele,Pjanic, Umtiti,Coutinho all above 365k a week underperforming. Pique & Busquet above 400k a week  As at now,Barcelona cannot even register players for new season, Aguero, Depay are not registered Yet, they still need to trim their wage bill down by around 2million Euros. Its no coincidence,they are in Debt. Barca should be Investigated.
i guess we cant take anything at face value anymore lol cause we know these big clubs are always plotting and trying to overpower the leagues they play in. We have to wait and see if la liga will fold.
Psg already have mbappe and Neymar.  Citeh just blew 100 mil on grealish and are under league investigation.   Chelsea is the only club he can go to
Man City and PSG are killing football with all these signings, that’s why it’s always sweet when none of them win the Champions League. However, I do hope Messi stays with Barca, it cements his legacy staying with one team and its good for La Liga. They lose Messi too and they are one step to becoming Serie A
After R. Madrid, PSG is the last place I'd like to see Messi play in.
He can only go to farmer league PSG in order to score 30+ goals, not in PL
I love Messi, but quietly my my whispers "how many millions is enough?"
Waiting for kane to be back to training
This is just powerplay and messi is the pawn who is being used. If he has any self respect he will leave this club purely because of the way they are using him.
It’s so annoying to watch these guys says it’s not a set in stone deal that Messi will leave and that it’s all part of a scheme to have Tebas cave and let them sign Messi. It’s ridiculous. Messi camp asking for way too much and Barca just ran out of money to give him. La liga will live with or without him.
they gonna find a way for him to go back to Barca....
Messi to PSG all but confirmed; Messi, Neymar & Mbappe.   M N M - 100 goals combined incoming
# LETS FORM A SUPER LEAGUE the SP league would not have survived either.based on how badly barca and RM operated sooner or later they would have found a way to ruin it too covid exposed everyone. there is no vaccine for bad management
Crazy to think that Sergio Ramos and Lionel Messi can end up at the same club. What strange times we live in. 🤪
Jules has started day dreaming 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Gab said Messi going to Inter Milan means buying the club…that was hilarious 😂 😂
How does Gab walk out of that room he is in. He is sitting down and his head is almost hitting the ceiling.
I speak on behalf of football fans around the world growing up in the Messi era. One of the most humble professionals in football who devoted his career, and humility for Barca. Speaking as a neutral I feel privileged in my generation to have witnessed Messi growing up in La Liga
Tottenham
Aguero right now : 😑😕
Now that Barca is no longer a one man team they will dominate Spain and the UCL again.
Messi joins another club and kicks Barca out of champions league next season
The envelope of our destination disappeared silently from the midway. Eyes are numb, heart is pulsing faster than before, neurons are not transmitting positive signals & body is experiencing feeble. All these things are happening because that envelope had a magic of happiness which disappeared with it.   All the joy you gave to me was also real & all those pain after losing many finals were real but we experienced it together. We experienced joyful moments together. I still do not know whether it is real or am I still having a nightmare but if it is just a nightmare I pray with god to let me get out of this nightmare because I want to see you with us like you were here before. This isn’t how we wished to end but our fates have other plans.   Once William Shakespeare told; “Journeys end in lovers meeting.” I didn’t really consider it as valuable quote but now I believe it as reality & has a merit to believe. The bond Between you & us was real & it is still real.   At the end; I’ll miss you until you come back but I hope you’ll be back for us by bringing more happiness. Bon voyage.    A goodbye message from me (Sid Shrestha) to THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME.
Watching the last 30-40 seconds gave me a lot of optimism ❤️❤️
Psg will be a step down with almost no competition within the league. It'd be only to watch the ucl.
Two teams that would bid for Messi , PSG and/or Man City .
Imagine Him joining up with Ronaldo.... Shirt sale's alone with the best Two in the world...... Make's business sense
Sancho Rashford Messi            Bruno Pogba                  Rice Shaw Maguire Varane WB                De Gea  💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Harry Kane who? Lol
Hi Messi, if you want to proof yourself as the greatest, please go to a mid table team and make it Champions. Like Maradona did with Napoli. Otherwise be a chicken and go to Man City or PSG and buy trophies.
He's going to stoke. The prophecy foretold.
PSG right now: *IT'S SHOWTIME*
If Messi goes to PSG, the French title race will be over by February.  It is just too much firepower.  Still hoping that Barca find a way to work this out with him.
# COVID STRIKES AGAIN  RM & BARCA were allowed to cook the books for years,  both teams selfishly allowed the of rest the league to rot from within then covid 19 hit . it exposed the all leagues except for Bundesliga. Both teams sucked the life out of the league. Now there is no money left BANKS ARE OUT. the rest of la-liga has had with both teams because they are all broke
Breaking News: Jack Grealish signing has been canceled by Man City. They did not have a proper explanation but sources are saying that situation got little Messi today😂😂
Two minutes silence for ESPN who signed a blockbuster deal with laliga🤐
is Gab hiding in the basement?
Laporta out, tdk bisa memenuhi janji buat pertahanin messi
Don’t be sad he’s leaving  Be glad we got to witness him for 17 seasons  Long Live The Goat 🐐
I hope he goes to PSG or Man City.
they expected other la liga clubs to pay for a part of messi's new contract because of his "pull" which is shameful, and Barce only have themselves to blame for how they approached the past couple years with recruitment.
Return to his childhood club in Argentina
the end was the BEST
They force him to stay when he wanted to leave last year, and now they don't have the ability to keep him when he wants to stay 😂
GOAT will stay
probably psg city already sign grealish 100 M if they sign Messi for free but they do realize his salary right?
how about NYCFC buys “messi”, loans him to man city, man city pays half of his wages to comply with FFP (like bale and spurs), city get to challenge the UCL messi gets to play for pep again and everybody is happy!
Can Messi join Athletico Madrid to partner with L Saurez?
Messi has to proove himself in premier league
If La Liga back down and make an exception for Messi i can see Real kicking off and saying that Barca now have an unfair advantage over the rest of the league
Come to Chelsea Fc🙌
He will stay at Barcelona 100%
Messi is not going anywhere! I will be done if he does
This news is just wow and shocking........
Que tengas lo mejor Leo ❤
I don't think it's just man city and psg. Man utd, Liverpool and bayern could also afford a 3 year contract worth 150m.
I am furious with this. He's staying in Barcelona!
Not the greatest of all time jules u idiot siuuuuuuuuu
That's fine theyd lose la Liga and champions league with him again. And be in a deeper hole financially
Had to be Dan 🤣
Messi deserved a farewell match. What a shame FC Barcelona😭😭😭
Messi is signing for Liverpool
Messi if ur reading this, please please please go to England. Man City I Wana c u rhere
They are clowns Messi already left barca and they really think he will play there this season 😂
Let’s see how far Laliga teams goes now 🤣🤣
TIME TO SEE IF HE CAN DO IT ON WET TUESDAY NIGHT IN BORDEAUX!! 😂😂😂
Ça m'intrigue de savoir qu'est qu'il porte comme parfum à mon avis des rares genre bkilan ou k747
ESPN just acquired La Liga for 8 season and Messi leave lol
If any footballer from any of the top leagues releases a sneaky fart, ESPN will have the pundit crew out of bed debating on how loud and fragrant it may have been
Messi - becomes Free Agent City Fans - we got English Messi,Welcome Super Jack🔥🎉 😂😂
Well not Liverpool anyway ESPN  From John W. Henry owner of soccer club Liverpool fc
Messi to Juventus
If la liga budge they might as well rebrand as Super Liga Santander
This is sad. I can’t imagine him after 21 years of service. Unbelievable. Bad game move by La Liga and Barca. I really hope he goes to PSG or Man City in good spirit.
no way this is all happening and they all say he will still play for barcelona
Man City
I'm still supporting fc barcelona because i wasn't watching messi, i was watching fc barcelona
The doctors at Man City will be made to find an error in Graelish' health check 😂
He's joining Suarez at Athletico Madrid with a pay cut..
Craig is taking the bait by saying that this looks bad on Messi, that’s exactly what Barcelona want people to think. However, in reality they knew about the wage limit and still continued to sign players before handling Messi’s contract situation. They’re putting this statement out just to save face and make everyone think that “Messi is asking for too much money”, when Barcelona have known what his price has been for nearly a year now…
How keen would you like to see him at PSG? ................SILENCE....................
Wish united can get it
ESPN IS IN THE MUDDDD 😂😂😂😂
Lukey, lingy, donny, rashy, sanchie fredie, cavani, MESSI 😭😂
Thank you Messi you are my greatest footballer of all time ⚽️⚽️
Sign Aguero, Depay let Messi leave Barcelona are the dumbest club in world football
Messi obviously will go to PSG.. But just imagine how epic it would be to have him in the PL.. But please, not to Man City.. As a United fan, City are almost unstoppable as it is.. With Messi in the line-up, it will be like City is on steroids..
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Barcelona Board - We'll let Coutinho, Griezman, Umtiti, Dembele leave. We'll make Messi stay.  Aguero - Ok I am in !  La Liga - 😂😂
How can management not know about this before claiming Messi is going to resign. It looks really embarrassing and I feel bad for Messi.
He’s not going to City.  Jacko took the #10 😂
Tom Brady leaving the patriots Micheal Jordan leaving the bulls Messi leaving Barcelona   It all feels too familiar 😭😭😭
The MLS welcomes Leo Messi!       Your Welcome America 🇺🇸
Dam, wonder if espn is regretting buying those la loga rights 🤣
Too old and past it… if this happened 5 years ago it would have been a great story
Pep running to Aston Villa to return Grealish be like: 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
Barcelona are always in the habit of ditching their jewels. They will not just lose Messi, but will lose a lot of fans. I can imagine how pained city would be, just after signing Grealish, O Messi come to Manchester United
Pep asking for refund from villa straight away
Greatest player of all time are you on drugs😂😂😂😂😂😂
He won't be leaving. We all know La Liga will budge. If he were to leave I don't believe he would go to PL. It's either PSG or USA.
I'm a Chelsea fan, why I WAS supporting barca is because of messi, so barca and laliga thanks for the disappointment
It's so arrogant for Laporta to bring in Emerson, Garcia, Aguero and Memphis without even being able to registrer them.   If you don't have the money for them, how do you expect to extend with Messi?
El Clasico 2021 : Vincius Jr Vs Antoine Griezman
After Xavi retired and Enrique quit, that's when Barca fell. The writting was on the wall. Thats why Neymar left.
PSG all his friends play there
I won’t believe this drama until Messi officially signs for another club. And Look at Kane situation... he’ll come outta the hiding hole now if Messi is actually available by tomorrow which will persuade City to sign Messi and leaving Kane out 😂😂😭
SHAKA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The laugh in the background is gross, unprofessional. You guys can do better than that. Stupid and upsetting
Juventus
I just realised that if he goes to PSG he will be reunited with his best mate Sergio Ramos 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 .
Chelsea 🔵🔵🔵🔵
Wherever Messi goes, I go. No point in following FCBarcelona. Adios mi amigos! Messi is fed up for now. He may bow to the wishes of Newell's Old Boys team to play even for one season rather than be idle for the duration. In any case, I follow him. He is the only player that excites the imagination. The rest is just bleh!
No chance messi staying .Messi said im gonna leave if they dont want me here and barca chose ESL than messi.He is gonna play for PSG with neymar di Maria paredes ramos ...
Messi➡️psg mbappe➡️real madrid
As a Madrid fan, I'm loving everything that's happening at Barcelona right now
CRYYYYY JULES, MBAPPE IS LEAVINGGGGGG
So he's not leaving then ?
Jules just doesn’t want Mbappé to come to Madrid 😭. It’ll be alright barca fans you guys got some great young players. Also Dan said cdc not CVC.
He’s going to psg
Barca doesn't deserve messi!!!!!!!!!
Next season Barcelona without Messi is like cooking without fire 🔥
LA liga is so boring anyways, now who would want to watch it, without Messi and Cr7, Premier league was always and is the best league
Barcelona are a disgrace of a club.
One way to man city, we can use him as a striker if Kane won’t make it
If Messi joins PSG the Balon d'Or is guaranteed, the French literally own the award
I'm lowkey very excited to see the reaction when Barca finishes 7th or 8th this season without Messi and plays In Europa league, finally exposing how much deadwood Messi was carrying since 2017.
Messi leaving barcelona will not qualify the champion league.
I mean seriously after last summer and now this if Messi actually come back and sign for barcelona after this drama I will be little disappointed... he doesn't deserve this much disrespect. Shows how bad Barcelona are run as a club.
AGGRANDISEMENT!
Thought this was extra time😅
He will stay at Barcelona. It’s just a sneaky move by them to lower his salary demands. He is not leaving
Barelona are not one the greatest clubs of all time. before messi they were maybe the 7th or 8th
Barca knew they won't resign Messi, they waited for Man C. to sign Grealish before making it official.
🕺💃🕺💃finally Messi is free😀
Aggrandizement is an English word, I believe. lol
Do you still think Bartomeu is a lousy president? Barca could have got 200m from Messi sale. Now they will get nothing!
He’s almost definitely going to psg.
Barca fan or Not every football fan is interested in this saga
Messi gone
ESPN did not get la liga to have no messi games this is BS even if they have to pay his salary 🤣😂
ESPN got finesse lmao no Messi no Ramos no varane for them to cover in the games so much for the 8 year deal 😂
I don’t see home leaving, I think the will fix the issue and keep him!
It couldn't happen because Barca is inept and messed up their finances.
PSG should sell Mbappe to Madrid, sign Ronaldo for 30 Million, and Messi on free transfer. They’ll bring in a bunch of money from viewers and sponsors just by them two being together. Mbappe is leaving anyways might as well get money for him.
Real talk though, as great as Messi is, his 4 year 500m+ previous contract was really bad for the club🤷🏾‍♂️ alongside mismanagement by the previous president has resulted to this. Just being real
If Barcelona kept him and cut everyone salary it wouldn't be fare and there wouldn't be a Barcelona. Messi did what's best for the club everyone needs to understand.
You know the whole bookies system of espn is a farce. How is inter ahead of chelsea in the race. Inter are in no state to buy him
it would be amazing if he went to Juventus.
i dont think messi will perform that well in the epl with all the intensity and physically, he prob ends at psg, it´s a shame cuse i kinda wanted cr7 to play for psg, but psg probably prefers messi if mbape stays.
cucked
So I can watch La Liga now. Hahaha 😅
Gab in his Sauna again
La Liga is going to be a dead league now
Would love for Messi to go to City, even as a Liverpool fan lol, if he managed these numbers with an average barca team imagine  what he'd do with city 😯 even at 34 I'd expect him to get 40-50 G/A in his first year
Messi  leaves its the end of the world. I think this is good for messi be like ronaldo.
why would the club post a statement with tribute videos and such? I don't think this is a power play but it could make a U-turn if they figure something out. Like Shaka said though, I'll believe it when I see him in another club's shirt and kicking.
Hello sadness my old friend 😔
Going to man city. Harry to United
I feel like crying 😭
I'm sorry but Laporta didn't manage to get rid of neither of Umtiti, Coutinho, Roberto and he didn't manage to keep Messi. His 2nd spell at the club is already a failure. No other way around it.
One of the saddest days of my life. Messi is really leaving FC Barcelona, I am numb. Please let this be a bluff, please tell me it's not true. 😭😭😭
Sign 25 Million a year contract or GET OUT Lmao 80m Loyalty bonuses days are OVER
Messi to man city
Need Sid Lowe asap
😂😂😂😂 it's no secret they are Barcelona fans 😂😂😂😂Messi is gone deal with it
La Liga is ruining their league
Thank you Leo Messi for everything you've done for FC Barcelona. wish you all the best for your new adventure! 👍 I'm not crying 🙂🙂🙂  I hate football 😭😭😭😭
So LaLiga has a "Salary Cap" but Barcelona are in massive debt from spending too much on yearly wages over the past number of years?  Lol What a disaster. Now they are bargaining with LaLiga to bend the rules for them because they are way over the "Salary Cap?"
Greatest player to ever play  , the 🐐
Bartomeu had all these cooked for many years. He finally succeded. Messi is the greatest player of all time. His love and loyalty for Barca is never a doubt but him leaving is good because he would waste another year under Koeman
Why did Barca agree a deal they knew wasn't going to pass because of the rules, if La Liga budge and break from the pressure, they will be the laughing stalk of the football world
This is a joke. 1 player isn’t above the league
Just return grealish with the same reason
Pep should take him city would be more powerful
Would love to see Messi leave for PL regardless but La Liga is screwing themselves over with this salary cap. They already can't compete with PL but this cap just makes the gap way bigger and they will have close to no success in UCL if this keeps up
Pep called villa and asked for a refund straight after this news 😂
I was gonna watch la liga... I'll still watch it lol
ESPN must be feeling really stupid getting those rights😂😂😂😂
Laporta just didn't have enough time to sort out this huge mess that Bartomeu brought upon the club on a whole 😕
Psg, Chelsea and Man City are the obvious choices but who knows what could happen
Napoli in honor of Maradona 💙
Go to Liverpool or Chelsea if you really want to win the CL
Messi Barcelona club deal falling through due to a deal between La Liga and private investors
Laliga to be useless without Messi
MC or PSG....if they grab the 3rd greatest GOAT. Imagine either or win their 1st Champions League with 🏆 Messi?
espn sad rn😂
He's making a step up to the Arsenal.
Shaka has spoken.
good decision to let him go . the club needs the money .
These days I just skip the Jules part
Jules he's the greatest Barca player of all time that's it
I will wait for Fabrizo Romano for confirmation 🗣🎙🥳thank you !!!
He’s going to PSG no doubt
PSG!!!
I'm happy his going time to see how good he really is premier league should be his next destination
Inter Milan? The same inter Milan that couldn't agree on signings with Conte
Stoke, so he can prove he can do it on a cold rainy night.
We know he can perform at Barcelona and Spain, but it remains to be seen how he can do outside his comfort zone. He has not been great at Argentina or Champions League in recent years.
Messi and Ramos playing together will just be weird
What a shambles Spanish football is these days
It's just a pressure tactic on Tebas, Chief of La Liga. He is staying.
The end of La Liga for the foreseeable future. Mbappe will have to be the face of La Liga for the next years
Tears man. Messi is a drama queen and Barca is full of idiots. I’m loving this dumpster fire
Hey jaka this is previous Barca board mess don't treat Barca as bartemou era this is over
PSG and Man City calling non-stop to Messi' agent
Can someone please explain to me how a club like Barcelona or Madrid are in debt? I’ve never heard of a club being in debt in American sports
SE QUEDA
I'm barcelona fan but i wanted him to leave since liverpool game ..... barcelona is a joke team with so many average players....he must save his career at psg or city.....forca barca 4 ever 💙❤️
Thank you for everything Messi! Best of luck GOAT wherever you go!
*Confirmed  90% of Barcelona fans are now free agents, with Manchester City monitoring the situation as they've been actively pursuing a fan base for years.*
If LaLiga then turns around and helps Barça..... Makes no sense tbh, cause then every team will be asking for special considerations. Regulations are regulations, it's not the league's fault that Bartomeu robbed Barça
I love how petty that statement is.
Messi to City
The fact that Barca is losing him for free is one of the worst management debacles of all time in any sport. Not like they didn’t know about the debt they were in, should’ve done a Messi/Mbappe?Neymar? Swap when they could have or sold him
he better go to pl but not to man city
I'm ahead of the curve so because of that, i don't have to speculate like you guys. I have confirmation that it is PSG. It's almost a done deal as a matter of fact.
Even if this is a power play by FC Barcelona to pressure La Liga to change the structure and eventually even if they do get to keep messi imagine posting a farewell video and again posting a video of messi staying at the club . The club will become a laughing stock playing with the feelings of the fans like this . I hope messi actually leaves and starts fresh somewhere new
Imagine Cristiano and Leo facing off in the Premier League by some miracle.   Also, as a Madrid fan, I know how you are feeling, Barca fans. It's an excruciatingly painful moment. La Liga has lost both its titans. Sad to see him go.
M-N-M Messi  Neymar  Mbappe
Barcelona put themselves in this position by putting themselves in ridiculous amounts of debt. They have no one to blame but themselves. Then coming after la liga like this when la liga is responsible for 20 teams, not 3, is utterly ridiculous. Why do you think Barca and real are so headstrong on the superleague? They need the other European team’s money to pay off their own debts
Messi won't come to the Premier League,he doesn't have the stomach  for it. He'll probably go to PSG where there's no challenge and be a pampered puppy.
La liga will bend the rules
Que the suicide alerts 😂😂
