Omg I love his laugh!!!!! 😂🐶💖
Why didn't Sebastian Stan do a puppy interview with Anthony Mackie? 😢
a puppy communicating with puppies <3
WE NEED A PART 2 !!
The best 8 minutes of my life
20 bucks the wife (then gf or fiance) was like SO HELP ME GOD WE ARE TO BUSY TO FOR ANOTHER DOG
He is going to take home ALL of these puppies low key
Chris’ answer to all questions: who cares? Puppies!
When I need to smile....I have to watch this
I'd love to see a presidential debate that includes puppies.
He is so happy :)
Love this
He said "Return of the Mac", and I died
His laugh I can’t
Cap with puppies >>> any villain fight 🐶🛡.

I need someone to talk to me like Chris talks to puppies
How can someone be so beautiful 😮 what kind of DNA recipep is that 😅
How can someone be so beautiful 😮
Captain America talks to puppies in a shameless cutesie voice. And he advocates for adopting senior dogs too. 🥺  Did you hear that? That was the sound of thousands of ovaries simultaneously exploding.
The Puppers are giving the Captain ADHD!
Chris Evans had alot of fun with the puppies he didn't even care about answering questions, but the "who cares" got me laughing he's such a brilliant actor 😊
I want the puppy thats playing with the pups <3
Chris soy una de tus fans en especial porque interpretas al Capitán América se ven tan tiernos tu y los cachorritos soy de Argentina 🇦🇷
For all my haters from Qatar, Gaza and lebanon who wants me see sad and lonely cz they hate me for support Israel and offcourse are sabotage me all the time and dosen't know nothig about he and I. I have question Do you belive he and I have a real relacionship or you don't know about it?
Explaining that the older dogs have seen some stuff and thanking them for trusting him . So cool and respectful of them x
Bizzfeed trying to ask questions and Chris Evans is like no im here for doggos lol
everytime I watch this, I fall in love with him more and more
What I noticed   1: him  2: him  3:him  4: how he kept laughing  5: how he moved from the x mark😂  6: how he is gentle with the seniors  7: how he wanted to squeeze the puppies
Chris jesteś niesamowity cudowny słodki ❤❤
Te avergonce? Yo😳 Como?
" Im about to go home with *all these props* " IS JUST SO CUTE😔
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen … Puppies and Chris Evans ?!!! Sign me up
Gets interviewed: Chris evans: BUDDY PAL  BUBBA BUSTER 😂
This guy loves dogs, I would trust him in that alone.  He lets them come to him, he understands earning a dogs trust. It will be interesting if he and his wife have children,  I think he would be a great dad.
the best thing about chris evans ❤ 🐕
That cute aggression ❤
Jared padalaki and Jensen ackles need to do the puppy interview
I think he said “Hi Buster, Hi Pal.” More than any other words in the interview 😂
He's gonna be the best dad i just know it!
This is definitely the most adorable interview in the world! Chris couldn't concentrate at all on the interview because of the dogs 10503강서현
Whelp looks likeI’m coming to get it” lol he should only have to ask once and I saw no one take the lead to” go and get him” so here I come handsome lol
If I ever get to do puppy interviews , which I know it won’t happen though, I am gonna steal one or two and go home with them because they are too cute .🥰 ❤❤
I love how he sat down and immediately demanded to see the puppies
“come here let’s build some trust” if that’s not the sweetest thing i’ve ever heard i must be deaf and not know it
After this video I have a whole new respect for Chris Evans.
Hmmmm........dogs have finished this man😂😂😂. He'd make a good dog minder but then it might turn ugly when my dog starts sending more time with him😂😂😂😂😂
8:18. Big sigh. Moves back" excuse you"
The number of times I've watched this is unhealthy
Chris Evans is absolutely in my top list of favourite actors. Every single movie that he featured in was great, literally. Wishing you success in your career and life.
The oops all good boys interview :3
He's got a sexy laugh!!!
2:36 dog's be like"Chris is mine you bitch"
1:48 the cuteness agression he controlled 😂

Come back to marvel chris
This video gives me serotonin
I want to study acting, work hard and become a star just so I can do one of these interviews. ❤️🐕❤️
that man is in heaven 🤣🤣
Even the puppies cant resist him🥹❤️‍🩹
I love the way his Bostonian accent comes out sometimes, like when he says “My dog, Dodger” and it comes out “My daug, Daudger” 😂
According to Chris  Scarllet-: She's my girl Jeremy-: He would be trouble RDJ-: He would be a lot of fun Hemsworth-: He would just make me fell bad abt myself😂😂😂
I've always adored this man - he's a great actor but you can always see the depth of his character. A genuinely great human. Plus I love animals - how could you not?
Soo cute 🐶  puppies 😊
scarlett johansson when
❤❤❤
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤑
Buster got the best of him 🤣
Ok but he’s cuter than the puppies lol 😂😂
hi buzzfeed im here to say that we need sebastian stan puppy interview. thank you!!!
This video heals my soul it’s so cute
The moment one of the puppies peed on the floor is the moment I stopped watching the interview.
Si muovono in branchi... si muovono in branchi!
Still the best interview
Cuteness overload!!!!! The puppies are adorable, Chris Evans is adorable I can't!!!!!!!!!
Guy's guy's💅💅😫
I don’t know what’s more adorable: The dogs or Chris himself.   And he’s absolutely contemplating taking those dogs and giving Dodger a million little siblings lmao
😻😻😻😻😻
Well i am a puppy, you know 😂😂😂😂
❤❤❤❤❤
He looks so happy 🫶🫶
Chris, where is valentina? 😂😂😂😂 litle tiny girl is still loooking for you.
I like t-shirt and cut hair, he looks cute and sexy in this interview.
I feel heaven just by seeing them
Hai Chris evan I am Ragu you like puppy 🐕 Ragu also like puppy Chris
Hai Chris evan I am Ragu you look great and handsome guy 😊
Saturday 24 august 2024 08:58 am building special and special trust. Shalom god bless ninik indonesia bye bye
Chris is a cutie pie 🎀
Captain America about to control the whole Paw Patrol
I saw golden retriever plays with puppies rather than interview
Excuse you 🥺
Every job interview should include puppies.
Chris sounds like woody more than buzz
It's crazy how much he understands about dogs. Only 51 seconds in, he is already making himself smaller to not intimidate them. I love it
7:31 how did I just know that answer. I read the question and thought his Exact words before hand 😂   RDJ is just the best
😅❤❤
I’ve binged almost all of of the puppy interviews and this one is by far the best one.
☹❤‍🩹
me crying at the way he talks to the old doggies
The black and brown one puppies are smitten! They fell in love😍😍
Who's here after he said "Flame on?"😂😂😂
His laugh is even the cutest thing omgggg
Ohh man Chris evans is truly the most beautiful man alive 😭😭😭😭
chris evans is a sweet puppy himself! 😍😅
I'd Absolutely Love To Be In A Room With A Bunch Of Puppies
1:10 Awww....The Little German Shepherd Puppy 😍
this man is gorgeous
"Who would you want to be handcuffed to for 48 hours" my answer is 100% Chris Hemsworth 😊
I wonder if any of the actors took home a dog???
Grande Chris Evans 😂😂🔥💪🇺🇸
4:04 Scarlett's my girl😏 Yes Chris we knew
If you want i can be your puppy again. 😉
Even dogs love captain America
You can tell he loves dogs 😂❤
This is Literally The Best Interview Ever 😂
Watching in 2024. Don't even know what project he was there to promote. Have only this to say. "Chris, that was the correct answer!" To any and all the questions. "Who cares?!?" ^^
That one puppy was like, "I going to do my best go home with Captain Merica!" The most attractive quailty in any human being is if they begin to baby talk when they set eyes on a puppy. You instantly know a good person from a bad one in how they treat a puppy/dog. And he's so right about older dogs. I think people are scared they might bite or not fit in but most of my dogs were adults when i adopted them. Once they trust you they'll give you just as much love and loyalty. They need you because a lot of people overlook them. You could be the happy ending they never got before.
Lol at 5:27
His laugh is wholesome as hell 😂
Lucky that they had none to stop them from  being named as God of Gods, Chris for Christ 🎉
What’s so wholesome about this interview beyond Chris Evans melting over the puppies is the sound of the film crew laughing in the background 😂
THE THINGS I WOULD LET THIS MAN DO TO ME OH GOD
What I would give to be one of those puppies!
O god I really like this man 🥰🥰🥰🥰
WE NEED ANDY SAMBERG HERE ASAP
2 years :(  happy 43rd birthday chris 🤍
Childish be like I don’t a Care bout no interview give me th damn puppies😂😂😂😂😂 😂
Chris should play Scott and Scott should play Chris
Captain America ❌ Captain America with dogs ✅
Chris is the daddy of puppies
1:06 1:53
question- Which one of these puppies would you take home and why???  They are all soooooooooooooooooooo cute and soooooooooooooooooooo hard to chose from.
And now we know puppies are basically drugs to Chris Evan. He can’t focus, he can barely answer questions, he’s completely smitten ahhaha
I think you can also have this type of interview with sebstain stan 😌
My family adopted my dog when she was about 3 years old٫ and she really needed to be adopted. She was so thin we could see her ribcage٫ her ears were bleeding٫ and she couldn't be in the same room as my dad for 3 days. Im so glad that we could give her a better life٫ and seeing Chris appreciating these older dogs makes me so happy
He had me at Buster Brown ❤
The way he kept calling them all "buster" "pal" "buster brown" "buddy" "guy" "bubba" etc 😭😭😭
there so cute
You lost him the minute you sent the puppies in 😂
This is still one of if not the best puppy interviews. He just loves being surrounded by doggos & you can feel it
seeing chris play with the puppies was hot, but him with the senior dogs really pulled on my heartstrings. i adopted two senior dogs and earning their love was the highlight of my life. being able to give them a comfortable life, even for a short time, was beautiful in every way. i miss them dearly.
am i the only one that keeps coming back ? 😭😣
What could be better than puppies and Chris Evan’s?? ❤❤
Guys, I'm LITERALLY the last puppy..trust🙏🏽😫
Sweet little Nuggets!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
This would instantly cure any bad days or depression or anxiety 😂❤❤❤
Chris is just melted in this and we are all here for it ❤❤❤❤❤💯💯💯.
Look at him getting cuteness aggression every 5 minutes 🤣🤣🤣🤣 It's so cute....🥺🥺🥺🥺
Chris Evan’s is totally a Golden Retriever 💗
I need Adam Driver in this 🥺 with tiny little puppies
Captain America: HANG ON I must stop saving the world to pet puppies.
Thanks for bringing out the older dogs. We only adopt older (over 2-3 yrs old) and it’s always been the best. The hardest time we ever had was with treeing walker that was 9 and VERY set in her ways lol. We never let our dogs roam even though we live in a more rural area. But she was having none of it. She went where she wanted to. Six foot fence be darn. Yes a 9 year old dog scaled the 6 foot fence. It was an amazing sight.
I love U❤❤❤❤
bro wasn't even interviewing
The puppy at 4:55 looks like scooby doo I’m sobbing
"Scarlett my girl".....that's adorable ❤🥺
Why do ppl like him. He married a kid. Pedo alert
To be fair Loki isnt even a villain at this point
He still looks the same since not another teen move ❤
Any person who loves dogs automatically gets bonus points. Even when they've already maxed out the meter.  Chris Evans is now a 12 out of 10.
my name is puppy.
"where are this puppy"
Wholesome 🤌🏾
❤❤❤
I would love a movie with Chris Evans rescuing an older dog and trying to earn the older dogs trust!
Chris is naturally adorable and goodhearted that’s why the puppies love him❤
He had fullmon cute agression and I am totally here for it!
Pertama kalinya gua mau jadi anjing😂
This was a good interview!😊❤
HIS LAUGH
2:22 his laugh ❤❤❤❤❤
The puppies knows that he's a dog lover.  Look how they react. ❤
This was amazing. Chris is so cool and his love of puppies makes him even cooler!
Oh he is having the time of his life
tthe last dog HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA i would do the same
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Lindo
Beautiful
would love to see more senior dogs!! they are wonderful to adopt because they are usually already trained and just want a warm place to sleep, cuddles, and food.
Is it possible that Chris Evans just got 10 x more attractive for the way he is with puppies 😂 a dream combo, and then the senior dogs come on and bang he’s irresistible 😅
The cute aggression is real
the question he would l ike to be asked "Would you like to take these puppies home?"
0:21 "I'm your puppy now"   W H A T ?
PLZ MAKE A PUPPY INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS EVANS AND CHRIS HEMSWORTH!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not Chris calling them buster and buddy 😂❤
The little bursts of cute aggression...  💜
Smash
Same chris, Same
This is a man the dogs accept. We are pleased.
NOW GIVE US SEBASTIAN STAN!!!
I love how he is just so down to earth, and obviously how he is a dog lover.
“gUyS, gUySsSsS!”
You ever see something so cute, you just want to smash it in the face?  Some babies are like that, all puppies are like that IMO  Handsome sweet looking little "fur babies" as they are called. 😁
They're all just "Buster" to him. Haha. Such a sweet soul.
to him all of their names are buster 😂
ok but. isn't he the epitome of "Golden retriever boyfriend" !!!!!! WOW. he's so genuine, this is great.
I love senior dogs! They still have the dog energy, but are so much more chill.  I still love puppies, but I have trouble keeping up with them. Me and my genetically bad joints and poor blood circulation. And to think that I'm going to be turning 20 this year.
He already played Loki in a cameo
O melhor porraor de 2017  E o melhor pg.
So N i C ?
Quero ser feliz... e as ×××× consigo.
He’s not even paying attention to the interview he’s to destracted by the puppies 😂😂😂😂
So how many did he take home? 👀
he successfully answered nothing at all
Any man who gets this excited about puppies and dogs, and loves on them and treats them like that is 🙌🏽!!!   And him speaking on the older and senior dogs 😩😩 my ❤️ I have a newfound respect and appreciation for Mr. Evans.  Alas I’m so excited to see the most relatable reaction to these puppies!!!  I could NOT do an interview playing with puppies, the would always win!  I’d be totally useless!  lol 🥹🥹❤️❤️
Loved watching him short circuit over competing priorities and ultimately picking the only correct priority - doggos!
"Which one what" Killed me 😂
Who cares "😒😂
Someone make Tom Hiddleston do this. I would probably pass away from cuteness 😭❤️
❤
"Scarlett is my Girl“🥹🥹
this might be the cutest video i’ve ever seen
😍
Those puppies love to play with actors
Bro didnt give a shit about the questions💀💀
0:52 😂 Someone is happy to see Chris Evans 😂😂😂
I love the "cute aggression" moments he got where he had to control himself HAHA
I can tell, Chris is a dog guy.
The only way to talk to your dog is with a baby voice. Chris Evans got the assignment right ❤
Hands-down, he took one of these dogs home
best way to get these beautiful dogs adopted  by the entire avengers cast  then they all could get together actors & their doggies!!!!
I want to be the last dog… going to his…
I loveeeeee this 😂😂❤❤ his joyful laughter just makes me smile
How he transitioned from interacting with the pups and interacting with the seniors is just phenomenal and genuine. Love him more! 🥹♥️
Nothing sexier than a hot man who loves dogs. Anyone who doesn't love animals is not a fully evolved human being.
Didn't know this was a dog guy. I love how the interview is 20% questions and 80% dog loving from Chris.
4:10 Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself 😂
Annnndddd all the ovaries in the room exploded.
"who cares"🤣🤣🤣
I'm only disappointed this isn't longer 🤣 I could watch him hang out with puppies for hours
This is probably the happiest Chris has ever been.
I have never been one to "Stargaze" but in this interview Chris Evans just went from just another star to a wonderful human being!! He will forever be a favorite of mine now.
I'm jealous
Ich habe mich gerade in ihn verliebt ❤
“WHo CAres”
here’s a concept; instead of any normal interviews with BuzzFeed, Chris Evans only does puppy interviews. Because that is what the world needs.
Who thought it would bring puppies and Chris Evan’s to the interview. How adorable is this. I would want to take them all home. 🥰🥰
Got to love Chris Evans. Loved his interaction with the puppies. Wish to meet him one day.
I fell in love with Chris Evans EVEN MORE after this interview 🤎🤎
Hello❤nice  👋
The love of a dog , is a pure thing❤
You know Dodger was pissed when he got home.
Saved to my "reasons life isn't so bad" playlist
I love how the fist question he was like "who cares?😊"
CAN YOU PLS INVITE SAM CLAFLIN FOR THIS?????
Puppy invasion
Chris Evans was fighting that cute aggression hard lol
Who needs to answer a question when there are puppys LICKING YOUR FACE.
Chris Evans and puppies is my new obsession.
Really tho, who’s actually watching this for the the questions and not solely Chris having the time of his life with puppies.
chris evans is a human golden retriever
1:58
my name is buster brown
HEE'ES'S SSOSD CUTE ETIO VLVOE HIM I LOVE HIM I LOVE CHRIS EVANS
❤
0:22 channeling Glen Close’s Cruella de Vil circa 1996.
Love how gis energy changed with puppies vs older ones
I might have died a little inside 😭
when I get reincarnated, I'll be a dog
Some girl is icked by this. Can you imagine?
Puppies saw his fluffy beard and said “one of us!!” 🐶
I mean the way he behaves those old ones, let alone puppies, it melts ma heart❤❤❤❤
Can you please do the Jonas brothers Q&A playing with the puppies?
Could you please do Zac Efron Q&A playing with puppies?
He kind of has a Chris Mcfarlane laugh from Total Drama.
Does this guy know how to play with puppies or what?  What a delight!
im not even a dog 😂
his laugh
He is like adult version of Tom Holland 😂😂😂
I love these puppy interviews. I hope people adopt from seeing these. Such a worth while cause.I hope he took one home from this group. The older dogs getting love made me smile!
Can he come back like Tom Holland did?
He's adorable
He even makes sure to almost go fully lied down just to show the puppies that he isn’t a threat. This shows he always had their trust in mind ❤
he reminds me of mr.peanutbutter from bojack horseman
Chris, let Buster go, you can't bring him to your home right now
Forget Chris Evans. Where is the “waterfall of puppies??” Okay maybe don’t _forget_ him completely…
“who… cares”
The best 8 minutes of my life
I want KITTEN interviews
This video is serotonin
He has a really really good heart. I wish him the best.
his laugh is so funny
"...Chris Hemsworth will make me feel bad about myself..."
This was adorable 😂❤
The funny part was when the dog took a piss.
The cute aggression is so real.
Chris Evans answering "who cares" in an interview whilst playing with puppies just made my day.
Chris is the perfect guy, but women will still cheat on him SMHHHH
This looks like therapy for him. He’s already giving names n orders😂❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself" Gosh their relationship is just so iconic.
“Sebastian Stan: Puppy Interview” next please 🥺
Oh my puppies! With Chris thrown in it's a beautiful image. Imagine him and the puppies waiting for you at home ❤
buzzfeed are geniuses for doing these interviews  they don't have to worry about asking any clickbaity questions to try to get a headline to draw attention  cause the puppies do that on their own  and the person getting interviewed just get to be little kids again
I have found the dog whisperer!!!
the happiest men alive
8:16 this dog...😢
This type of interview needs to be as popular as hot ones.
Luky puppies...
I swear, these puppy interviews are the sweetest thing I've ever seen. Whoever thought of this is a genius! What a festival of cuteness ❤️
WHY HE'S SOOOOOOOO CUTE OMG 😭
How is there any other format for interviews?
he fits in so well cause he really is a baby golden retriever
Chris Evan makes me smile every day 🥺🥺🥺🥺
I have seen everything now 😍
And I thought this man couldn't get any sexier🙈🙉💜
you can just tell Chris didn't want to leave those dogs... like.. ever
i really want to know what breed the dogs in this video are.. so i can get myself one too
i come here from time to time  because what in the world?? My heart melts everytime and him calling every puppy “ buster” is hilarious 🤣
now with cats pls i would love seeing him with cats
Who’s here from the Tom Holland interview?
I want eight puppies 🐕 now.
Love Chris Evans. His brother is also amazing.
I cried so much when he talked about earning an older dog's trust. A year ago i adopted a ten year old dog who was mistreated and traumatized by people most of his life. He was timid and scared but once he got out of his shell a little he had the biggest heart. I lost him recently. It was sudden and i still cant get over it. I see him evwrywhere i look. Earning an old dog's trust is hard but its the most rewarding thing when you do.
chris - Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi
Cuteness overload! Can't take it to much cutie!🥰🥰
:)
❤❤❤
goes hunting for a Tom Hardy puppy interview...
❤❤❤❤ best interview ever
Rumor has it, that he adopted every single puppy there and gave them a home!  I'm gonna go with that!
This is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
He does not care about these questions AT ALL
In case you weren't already in love with Chris Evans...omg.
I loved watching this, it gave me so much Joy.
El carisma de este hombre, es hermoso 🥺
Some of the puppies look like they have some German Shepherd in them; so cute!!!   This is the best interview ever; I smiled the entire time.  LOVED seeing the puppies giving him kisses & hearing him laugh.  💞
This may be the cutest thing I have ever seen! I also tend to call male animals "bubba" and "bud".
Best vid ever.
Forget the questions; just make a video where Chris is playing with dogs for 10 minutes
Adopting a senior dog was the best decision i ever did, i love my baby ❤
Seriously, that would be me if i were in his position. 😊 I love dogs!!! 🐶❤ Chris Evans is so adorable! What a wonderful soul!😍
Cute🥰
Who knew that Captain America likes puppies.
He’s so Boston . I didn’t expect him to be so NOT into himself. Humble, Goofy. Cool dude.
Chris Evans puppy interview is my dream come true.
luckiest puppies in the world. They got to lick Chris Evans
Chris sounds so drunk he is like i will sleep with these puppies around me
I love a man that lets puppies just absolutely lap the shit out of their face
Me who's currently on an animation course but considering taking acting classes hearing Chris say he wanted to be an animator before he was an actor: HE JUST LIKE ME FR 😮
❤❤❤🐾🐾
Chris evans loves dogs. " Where are the puppies " 😂😂
i love Chris's laugh!!!
Happy 1 year anniversary to the best interview ever
I got a flash back from when tom holland said he that Chris could just walk in there and do one
He's SO LOVELY. I mean, just PERFECT
I wonder should i look at the puppies or Chris😢....i m such a huge fan of everything in this interview❤❤❤❤❤
HAHEHAHEAH 👹 I love Chris SM    HUSBAND SINCE DAY 1

I can imagine Chris Evans walkjng out with one of the dogs being like "This is mine now. This dog is coming with me."
the last dog was thinking what I was thinking 😂
1:00 i felt that
7:28 bro. Your captain america…
Sii Chris.  Ohh my gosh....
Love Chris. He’s a great guy and we can see it in here. He’s a sweetheart
Adorable isn't enough he is so FCking pretty and cute and soft and perfect God stop making me so obsessed with him
So cute and adorable 😂❤
Forget CBD oil this cured my anxiety for the day. So sweet.
0:26 Those lashes as he's getting excited about puppies omg
Please interview pedro pascal 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Captain America loves puppies dogs
The Puppies Interviews are just such a sweet idea. Are the puppies with Chris the same puppies from Steve Carell's interview, but just all grown up a bit🥰?
my serotonin levels are over the top- i cantttt
Captain America: "I can do these all day."
My bubby my piti.
😅😅😅
Chris playing with puppies is obviously fkn adorable, but Chris hanging out with the older dogs and being so gentle and sweet with them omfg 🥰
That last puppy knew what he was doing😂😏
I got a vibe that, in the process of making this video, Chris was either over dosed or got overdose of cuteness. 😂
His cute Boston accent slipping through ughhhh this man is so fine🥰🥰 5:29
I loved how excited he was waiting to see the fur babies ❤❤❤,  he's definitely wayyy cooler 😎 to me now 😍, if Chris ever saw this comment I'd like to thank him for an amazingly wonderful interview, absolutely my fav❤❤❤.
"thanks for trusting me" made my eyes water.
bruh 2:49😂😂😂
Chris is SO Hot and Cute at same time hahahahaha
God, he seems so genuinely lovely! seems to know and understand how to properly communicate and treat dogs! always lovely to see.
Came here after Lizzie's puppy interview and now im curious if they switch puppies lol >.<
God is Holy
Jesus is King forever
Jesus is coming back
Jesus está voltando, Ele reina pra sempre
não tem como não sorrir com isso cara
I Love You Chris Evans and I Like You Smile and Laughing and Voice 😍 💕😘 ❤️ You Look So Hot Hot Hot Hot Very Hot Very Hot Very Hot  And Sexy and HandSome And A Cute Dog 🐶 ❤️ 🔥 😎
I love him so much! He’s such a dog person and I love that 🥰
It was so sweet for Chris to bring in the older dogs because they need just as much loving. I don’t have a dog but I did adopt an older cat from my local shelter. She is six years old and she’s so cute.
this video is a blessing
when i tell u that i watched this a million and one times bc this man is so fvcking pure it's so cuteeee
i wanna be a dog😢
Did keanu reeves ever do one of these?
How many of these doggos did Evans take home?
These questions are terrible
what is 🧍‍♀happening 🧎‍♀to me🐕
He's soooo happy!! hahahaha!
"WHO CARES" HAHAHAHAHA! THIS MADE MY DAY!!!
Ok, this was awesome that we FINALLY got Chris Evans... but now we gotta do Pedro Pascal!!!!
We named our youngest son after Chris Evans. I was on bed rest for the end of my pregnancy and watching  a lot of movies.  Watched Captain America a lot.  Loved the movie/character/Chris. Started playing around with names (we had already decided on Alexander).  Steve or Rodger, too common.  The same with Chris/Christopher, too common.  We settled on Evan.  A round about way, but our Evan is named after Chris Evans.
❤ Very very cute puppies
Oh my ovaries! I think I'm already pregnant.
Love this
How many time he said HI🤣🤣🙈
this is so fucking wholesome. I love this so much
yup golden retriever in his habitat, so fitting🥰🥰
The most sexiest and masculine man on earth playing with puppies, makes him a hell of a lot more attractive!
him saying pal is so cap coded
How did he not take home every one of those dogs?
Honestly, the best moment of my life was when I was with the whole pack of my parents dog in my childhood.  The pictures were fantastic with the puppies and I just soaking up each other.  It was brilliant meeting the mum and dad and seeing them with the puppies then stepping back watching me be a baby sitter for them! 40yrs later and it's still so fresh.
This is by leaps and bounds the single most pure thing I have ever seen.
the fact that chris considers scarlett his sister makes my heart happy
I can't decide which one I'd rather be, Chris Evans or one of the puppies?!
Chris is such a gem!!!
he's so find.
I feel like I'd react the same way to this sort of interview.
Captain America's weakness puppies
I wonder if he feels the same way about older women. 😂
👁️👄👁️ 😭😭😭😭 I love him
The hunkiest actor ever❤❤🥰😍
I just  wanna be a popular actor so I can play with puppy’s 😭😭
He was so busy with the dogs that he didn't answer properly, so busy with the pups,it was so cute😍. Tom handled them nicely, playing with pups and answering.
Senior dogs...oh my...now I am crying Edit: which soul wouldn't trust such a soft hearted man? He really is captain america
Sorry to kill the cuteness...but how many women are jealous of those puppys right now?🤣🤣🤣😂 crawling all over captain america 😅😅 I am just laughing so hard, cos I would have such a hard time answering. Just like him. High on love and cuteness overload and being in heaven
the anger outburst from cuteness is so real
his voice🛐🛐
eu amo ele interagindo com os dogs, eu tenho o ídolo certo
having the time of his life😃
They need to do one with Anna Kendrick
1:45 the puppy ASMR is REALLLLLL
They should have them drink whenever they don't answer the questions
Daddy
Yes he does not need anymore dog
I mean... who wouldn't want to kiss him like the whole time? Puppies are smart.
*only cares about puppies* has to answer questions and starts off with “Who cares” 😂😂😂 that was gold
Where can we adopt a Chris Evans of our very own?  That man is just the sweetest guy :)
That "excuse you" made my day !
Wow, the puppies love him! He loves them too. He has a great personality. I love how careful and loving he was with the older dogs.
Crying bc the brown dogs look like mine when he was a baby 😭😭😭
My lifetime crush... 😍
Anybody know what brand his shirt is?! Where can I get his shirt?
Watching strong men playing with puppies is everything ive ever needed in my life its like watching men with babies
“Come on come get it” 😂😂😂
I wouldn’t be able to concentrate on the questions either! 😂😂😂
Legend of dogs names in case anyone got confused: Blue collar: Buster Orange collar: Buster Purple collar: Buster Red collar: Buster Brown (not to be confused with Buster, Buster, or Buster) Grey collar: Buster
lucky dogs.
Let’s do one with Doctor Mike!!!
3:27 Arthur flex soul emerged
I want to be a puppy😭
This is the best one EVER❤. He is so freaking cute with them.
This is so cute!!!!!
my heart melted when he said bubba
buster brown   n him are soulmates ... there I said it someone tell me im wrong
he n my boyfriend are the only gemini men i trust
🥰
Okay but did he adopt the puppy with the mug or did he adopt the puppy with the mug?!
Whenever I need a serotonin hit, i come back here. 😍😍😍😍😍😍
This dude is 41 old
I also want Hugh jackman to do this interview
」ｐ＾ｐ＾「
Good job bubba XD
He's so giddy with the puppies it's adorable! lol he can't pay attention at all I don't blame him 🤣
I’m naming my dogs buster from now on haha
Captain America loves dogs! So adorable!🐶🐶🦮🦮🐕‍🦺🐕‍🦺🐩🐩🐕🐕
I love him so so much😭❤️🥰🥹
I love him so so much😭❤️🥰🥹
Looove his gentle touch...that says a lot.
7:10 "No disrespect to the puppies (...)" - Well thank God he said that, I'm sure all puppies were already queuing with lawsuits about emotional damage... ;)
everytime i’m having a bad day i’d come back to this video
He looks like he’s so high from puppies’ loves.❤😂😂
His laughter is so contagious!!! 🥲💗
He is a laugher. Delightful.
Animals know.❤️
Chris Evans have the "crazy single uncle that everybody loves" aura (even the puppies)!
Chris Evans is, for me, the only man who actually is more adorable than a lap full of puppies. This is just charming.  By the way, what you're seeing here is a very good indication of one's character. The way he is talking to and about the dogs and the gentle way he is interacting with them gives you a good baseline for who he is as a person.
Wait, wait, WAIT!!! Chris Evans was in this interview? All I saw was puppies & doggas!!!!
‘Who cares’ 😂😂😂
"This is a PrObLeM... *Few Secs Later* This is ImPoSsIbLe!!"  He's so Pure!!! I love him
Just a fannn he he 😁🥰
it’s official. i’m in love with chris evans
no way this was 7 months ago????????
I love how every question he answers, he tells it to the dog. Like they asked the question I just love that every dog's name is Buster Brown according to Chris
The cutness aggression 1:49 yeah we felt that
That was the most wholesome thing I’ve seen all year!! Why is he so precious!
Sorry but I can't stop thinking about this!!!! I wanna be that lil puppies so bad!!!!!
WTF. Why was he repeating Hi buster...? Hi Pal and all these names ?
I need that man as husband. Thnks. Actually the questions were so basics...he was like yeah whatever ...... But he was so excited with the puppis. I LOVE him
This is the best video of ALL TIME. ❤
He's like a puppy-man himself so cuteeeeeeee
I love how he got on the floor with them and couldn't take the cuteness! Lol 😂
These dogs don’t even know they’re being pet by Chris Evans
Omg.  Those shepherd mix puppies!  How did he not take any of them home?!
i might have fall in love with him with this
Those dogs living my dream 😅
I could watch this all day.
I want to be one of these puppies
桃总真的太可爱了！
Wow. Wanted Henry Cavill here to see who the doggos 🐕 loved more..captain America or Superman...both are caring and hot men 😜
Chris Evans: ✓ Henry Cavill: plsss???
Rainbow capt
He's a dog magnet 🥰
he is so happy here.
Chris nearly mastered the Tom cruise laugh . Well done 👍 .
So jealous of these puppies
(when asked about a biopic)  "Let's cast Adam Driver to see what he does" 😭
Casey Jones from TMNT 2007
I’m not sure if this has been said already but Chris Evans is what Captain America would be like if he wanted to become an actor instead of a soldier.🥰🥹🥰
Can I have the same with kittens?)
Ok but i think dogs is his drugs
I’m still waiting for Henry Cavill to do this interview.
Can we talk about how cute it is that Chris calls all the dogs “Buster,” since he doesn’t know their names? Like that is so fucking precious!
8:15 All the ladies wish they were that puppy.. 🤣🤣🤣
I wanna be a dog for chris evans
I mean how can you answer questions with those cute little guys around like oh my goodness ❤
That's our Cap 🥺👏
I absolutely love that he said "Return of the Mack" for what song he want to have played any time he walked in a room. LOVE that song!!!!!!!
Is her drunk
I'm from Kenya,Africa obsessed with the Marvel franchise but I especially loved seeing Chris in this space...I love dogs too..I don't know how he made it through this interview 😄
Omg that chihuahua is just like my roommate’s dog who passed a year and a half ago. Darker colored fur, but the resemblance is truly uncanny. Like a dark Sissy.
Este hombre es lo mas bello de esta tierra❤
never have i ever wished to be a puppy...                        i have
wow okay I have a new celebrity crush!
Can we just admire how big of a puppy lover Chris Evans is
Imagine Dodger seeing this on you tube
They want attention and milk😂🍼🍼
*there's something about seeing Captain America himself play with tiny puppies that just fills my heart with the purest form of joy and love*
PROTECT HIM AT ALLLLLLL COSTS..............
Chris's laugh is just so cute!
More puppies needed
What brand of polo t shirt is that???
I wish i was the dog so i can play with Chris Evans  And I’m straight male
When he started playing with the older dogs it got me thinking “just because maybe their not cuter or smaller doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t give them a chance and even try to earn their trust😢»
Idk if he keeps calling the puppies buster or buddy? Because buddy would make more sense
I love how most of these interviews include at least one time of the person being interviewed being completely distracted by the puppies/kittens that they forgot what the question was XD
Sebastian stan next
Me while watching the Mr.Evans and lovely dogs video: "*sighs and smile like a fool in spanish😍*"
So...yeah...I totally want yo marry him now...even more than before. I absolutely love that man. I adore him and not just because he's gorgeous on the outside but he seems to be so genuine and kind on the inside. Beautiful through and through
I'm surprised he knew return of the Mack
2.000.000 para su fundación de rescate canino!
hahahaha he was trying his best to continue with the interview
I hope he adopts Buster
Renner, Scarlett, Downey, Hemsworth. RUFFALO??
My man would have literally taken a dog with him and named him buster if he  could
I loved how he defended the senior dog's adoption and love, they have seen things that we don't know of, we have to earn their trust and there's nothing better. Loved it.
best puppy interview ever 😂👏🏽❤️
Chris being cutest person alive for 8:45 minutes
This is Chris Evans' version of heaven most definitely. The man just loves dogs so much. Such a lovely human being. ❤️🐶
3:26
2:13 AMOOO JAJAJAAJAJ
Wow! No me lo esperaba! No me caía bien como actor, pero ahora me cae bien como persona. Alguien que respeta y ama los animales. Que lindo!!! sonreí en todo el video
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhjhjjjjj
Ugh!
“Return of the Mack” a man of taste
chris evans is the sweetest human being ever, no one can tell me otherwise
and they say porn for women doesnt exist.
The cuteness aggression gives me cuteness aggression
Guys guysss  Look at youu  Ugh GODDD Hi guys hi baby omg you guys are so cute  Hi pal you at that face hiiii  Come here guys come here  buster  Hi pal hi buddy hi buster hi sweet man hi bubby hi man   Huh bubby hi pal he’s so sweet It’s okay
This series is by far the best interviews to watch , how humans get all goofy when puppy's are on set, I love it
I run a non profit rescue in the Midwest. Chris is the real deal with these dogs. I’ve watched a few of these now and several of the actors/actresses pretend to like the dogs because they are supposed to and it “looks good” but they have no real connection. Chris not only loved dogs but he was understanding of the way they think and what they need to be comfortable
“Loki seems to have the most fun” 👀👀 sir, what?
I know feel a deeper connection with Chris. That fact that he wanted to be an animator as a kid a know I’m studying to be one. Made me feel fuzzy inside.
He can do this all the day
He looks, sounds, acts like Dr Mike. I want those two to be in a single Puppy Interview
Just saw this. Chris Evans is an absolute GOD and no one can convince me otherwise ❤
get JACKSON on here pleaseee
Chris and Dr.Mike have the same energy
Dear Buzzfeed: It’s Evan Peters’ turn. Please see to it. Thank you.
The superior of the Chris'
You know he has one too many friends😁Thank goodness he lives alone!
sexiest man alive!!...from a straight male.
He such a huge dog lover
CCCUUUTTTEEE, but they stole our puppy
“What fool do you take me for he’s buster, he’s buster, your buster, IM BUSTER! ARE THERE ANY MORE BUSTERS I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT.”
Take one shot for every time this beautiful man say “hi”
Watching Chris roll around on the floor playing with puppies is totally therapeutic! 🐶💗🐶💗🥰😊☺️🤗
I love puppies can't have one now I'm too old. But I choose puppies over most people. They have real genuine love
Too cute
I think we could learn a lot about politicians if we could see them interviewed with puppies.
The best way to judge a man's character is by how he interacts with dogs.
The cutest thing I've seen😍😍😍
Bros not even answering the questions lmao
THE PUPPIES PLAYFIGHTING IM FUCKING DYING I WANNA PLAY WITH PUPPIES SO BAD
melihat bapak bapak ganteng maen ama puppy ini moodbooster jg ternyata ya 😂
*Hi, I was looking for a comment want to become poppies but i don't so if not anyone else want to. Just let me  🤣*
When he said “iam expecting a waterfall of puppies” 🥺🥺
Do you love puppies? And a love Chris Evans 💖💖💖💖
*Chris trying to answer the question then ignoring it to play with the puppies*
If all of the world’s conflicts were handled in a room full of puppies, we’d all be better off! 💕
Take all puppies with you, because puppies are so cute. Come on, Chris...take them home with you.
return of the mac
Someone needs to cast this man in a "JOHN WICK" movie
This was just him having fun he doesn't even care about the interview loooooool
O Chris é tão fofo...e a risada 😍😍
Even the dogs knew how hot chris is i mean cant blame their dog senses
❤️❤️
This is called "high in d(ru)ogs" 😋
Bellísimas tus mascotas!!!! Saludos y Bendiciones
I'm like Chris every time I see a puppy, my heart is melting with tenderness.
There is no interview, only puppies.
Hot guy, cute pups, what's not to like?
8:16 OH TO BE THIS DOG RIGHT HERE
Me enamore aun mas, Chris, TE AMO
Omg cuteness overload puppies, seniors and Chris Evans playing with them!
does he get to keep one?
I love hearing “Back in my day” stories from old people, and I sometimes do wonder what kind of stories an old dog would tell me if they could talk. Whether they had a good life or struggled, I’d be leaning forward with my chin resting on my hands, and oohing and ahhing
NEXT SEBASTIAN STAN WITH KITTENS NOW!
What is this dog breed called, I had very same puppy I lost him lost june☹️, if any of u guys know, reply on my comment to buy this kind of puppy please...
he is still my favorite man
I don't know if i would get jelous with chris or with the puppies. Hahahaha
Um banho de fofura.
Gorgeous man with adorable puppies...my dream came true.
As if we needed another reason to love him
Those puppies have no idea how lucky they are
I enjoyed a lot this video  !!! ❤😄
Lucky dogs🥰❤
I don't t care about the questions. I just want to see cute puppies and Chris Evans.
More reason to love Chris ❤
*Turns out he prefers the puppies over the older ones after all* 🙊
Best puppy interview ever! Not just because its Christ Evans (although that's a big reason) but his reaction is absolutely delightful. I'm sure I would react exactly the same way. And those puppies are some of the cutest you've ever had on the channel!
Florence pugh next, please 😁
At around the 3 minute mark they start playing the music from the overcooked game … when doing the space missions. Such a random score to play in the background
The crew is here for Chris Evans, Chris Evans is here for the puppies, and we are here for Chris and the puppies. Everyone's priorities are right where they need to be.
Do next with henry Cavill please
Chris Evans needs to adopt all puppies and name them all Busters lol
Tre tre jolie
I think the world wants to know how many dogs Chris rescued after this interview lol
As if I didn’t love him already, as if I wasn’t already obsessed with him!!!! Now I am irrevocably in love with him!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Chris answering to all these questions: WHO CARES! I agree👍😄👍
😁😁😁😁😁
I like that these interviews allow us to get to see the genuine, pure smile of whoever is doing it... Not the polite one, the actor /actress / celebrity one, but the one that includes the eyes :D <3
I’m watching this and I’m just shocked this man was ever able to act like he hated dogs in Knives Out 😂😅
i want to be a celebrity just to do this interview
“This is a problem….this is impossible!” Me🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is the best episode of the puppy interview
A puppy with puppies🥺🥺🤧
Puppy interview check Sexiest Man Alive check Now get those thirst tweets and he owns the internet.
Yep, said it before, lol, cute playful, furry puppies wreck your thinking and your concentration. lol Proof.
💗
What a sweet man. He loves dog and understands them very well. He is kind and compassionate to animals.
Still don’t know this took y’all so long @buzzfeed 😒😒 part 2 when 😹😹
I want Chris Evans to read thirst tweets SOOOOOO BAD
"The Sexiest Man Alive" y'll <33
Love him
Awesome video. I'm a furmom and I love dogs too!
You don't care about me, do you care about me?
I’m smiling ear to ear
I am curious to see how tom hiddleston or rdj would fair against these lil pups, would love to see their reactions lol
Who's wet and not because of tears 💦  8:16...that's a lucky pup 😂
Amor ❤️ Que lindo 💞 Também amo , Animais ❤️ E amo você Chis ❤️💋💋
Just him ✨
Animals feel that Cris is a pure kindness. It seems like all they want is to kiss him. He is the best.
Chris 🤩🤩
Mano a risada do Chris é maravilhosa
This is the best interview I have ever seen 💕
This video is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😊😊😊😊
I’ve never wanted to be a dog more in my life 😍
This is why Chris Evans is America’s ass.
Sexiest man alive indeed.
Batman is ridiculously gorgeous
its officially, i love chris evans. i get it now.
He’s the sweetest 😢
Now what would even be more great if buzzfeed did a puppy interview with Tom Hiddleston.. Please make it happen
Very nice. They are so cute
What a kind gentle loving guy. A real treat to watch his interview and like he said “who cares” to the questions it’s his interaction with the pups and dogs that matters most! 🥰
I’m so glad that he is a Gemini like me
QUANTO SI COPIANO GLI ATTORI AMERICANI !!! IL PRIMO A FARE IL VIDEO CON I CUCCIOLI E' STATO L' ATTORE DEL FILM MATRIX " TANTI HANNI FA' "
Oh no 😀😀
Any man that loves dogs and puppies is my kind of guy. Love this dude
Why does he laugh like Count Dracula just ah ah ah one ah ah ah two ah ah ah
PLZ CHRIS IS SUCH A SWEET AND HEARWARMING GUY🥺🥺🥺🥺
He makes you want to tell him everything. The way his voice changes when he’s talking to the senior dogs and he gets low to the floor - it’s just so beautiful. That man has the best heart ❤❤❤
I LITERALLY just saw this yesterday...why am i back here? Oh yeah, Sweet Chris with sweet puppies
Me right now - Hey BuzzFeed, I'm not famous but I do love puppies please do an interview with me 😑😑😑 Also Chris Evans is the most wholesome guy ever, I'm in love😍❤️
This vid should be made in 4K res.
Chris😍 he is such a Sweetheart ❗🫶💋
Wow 😃 heii
I despise Chris Evans......however, he is tolerable in this brief moment......
Melted. I have. 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Damn those lucky puppies
Chris no puede ser más tierno  Chris con perritos 😍😍😍😍😍🥵😂 lo amo
I want Jensen ackles and Jared padalaki to do this interview
you should do one with Sean Austin
1:00 Literal example of wholesomeness
Legend has it that Chris is still in that studio, playing with those puppies and dogs.
Captain America, you fought against Hitler. Why aren't you fighting against Zelensky?
In my life I've never wished I was a puppy as much as I did watching this video
❤❤
Cutest🥺😍🥰❤️😘😘😘😘
Oh god. This is just too much. Total and complete representation of the perfect man (at least in my opinion)
oh no whats happening ...🧍‍♀️...🧎‍♀️...🐕
can I have buster pleeeeeease
He said who cares lmaooo exactly what I’d be saying with that many pups around me
I think I just developed a crush on this man LOL. What an adorable interview.
I just realized that he named every puppy "Buster"😅
I dont know how many times i have watched this, i cant get over it, there's nothing cuter than a handsome man cuddling puppies😍🥰, watching this make wish being the tongue of those puppies and lick Chris to find out what he taste like, I mean, even the puppies wanted to find that out, they all wanted to savor him🤣🤣🤣, am I the only one who loves Chris' laugh? His moment with senior puppies was the cutest thing ever, he has very valuable concepts about respecting animals
How the feck are you still single #chrisevans!
I'm not the biggest fan of Chris Evans though I'm sorry for him that he's got to deal with this anxiety thing. God, his laugh is so infectious... ah, f*ck it, I like him.😆
Chris evans is such a kind soul even for the older dogs and he’s so sweet and is so soft around them is so sweet
pls the fact that he’s calling all of them buster brown is melting my heart
Take a shot every time he says “Hi”
you are beautiful my dear
Awwww sweet🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭🍬🍬🍬🍬🍬
I’m smiling while watching this😊
OK we've had Chris Evans with puppys but who thinks its time for Sebastian Stan puppy interview?
Chris has that Buzz laugh for sure!!!!😂 and “ Who cares!” Is right when your surrounded by puppies??😂💖😂 Every interview should be like this! I’d go on anyone I could!❤😂
6:48 I love this. I worked at a dog kennel for a while and there was this one older Rottweiler who didn’t trust strangers. The day he finally walked up to me and asked me to pet him was just the best day of my life. And then after that he became just a big baby who wanted endless love and snuggles lol
A big muscles handsome man happy in a puppy puddle....IM DEEPLY IN LOVE🥰🥰
I didn't know it was possible but I love Chris Evans even more!
♥️
8 minutos e 45 segundos de pura seretonina !!!!
Okay, but Buster adopted him. So he better take Buster home with him.
Is Chris like the perfect man or something? I love people who love animals, especially puppies and kittens from shelters. Chris seems like such a cool, fun, and sweet person, plus he's just adorable looking. I'll take one puppy and one Chris Evans please! Thank you for another great puppy video. Loved the older dogs too.
Chris Evans + puppies = happy days on the internet!
Hands down my favorite episode! Watching Chris Evans dying over puppies is magical 😊❤😂
I love that he added the older dogs in there.   Older dogs need love too.   He is such a genuine soul.
The way Chris talks about dogs makes me want to start a relationship with him.
Love that smile lol

Chanie brought me here
Q) (Marvel Villains) 'How do I incapacitate Captain America and turn him into a jabbering idiot ?'  A) (BuzzFeed) ' Easy ... PUPPIES !!! ' 🐶🤪🐶
I love his full attention for every single puppy 💖
What makes Chris Evans hotter? ...  Chris Evans with dogs ❤️
At 2:18 - I want to "come get it." So envious of the dogs that got to be so close with him. Lol
Chris Evans Plays With Puppies while not answering fan questions..lol
Dogs know good people 🐶
Man, if I had celebrity money and a huge celebrity house with land, all of my willpower would be out the door and I'd be leaving the interview with every single one of those puppies.
I bet if Hitler did this he'd be the most loved dictator of all time.
So, when are we getting married and filling our house with puppies/dogs?
You have to love and trust a guy who is so sweet and loving around dogs.  Thank you Chris!
Seems like he can do this all day
Thanks for❤️Thanks for the endless love and support you have consistently been showing me. I really appreciate the unconditional love I’ve gotten from you, which has inspired me to give more sensational entertainment. I’m forever grateful. What country are you watching from?
The PERFECT person for this interview! 🥰 So many cute doggoes. ❤️ Also, he's absolutely right about adopting an older dog.  We got ours when she was 2 1/2.  She'd been through a lot, and she's the most loving pup.  She's now 9 and she's my shadow.  😍
So cute 🐶🐶🐶🐶🥰🥰🥰🥰❤❤❤❤
Absolutely adorable ❤️❤️❤️
Aww ❤ I also play with puppies
it's so cute❤️but guys.. stray kids be making us wait
Every single time he like screams and squeezes his hands to try not to freak out, yeah that’s how I feel every single time I see his face.

literally chris like me 🤣 no one can speak to me when i'm near animals not even a joke😅
Me with kids:
💖💖💖💖💖
is he going to have oral sex with those dogs later
How can you not love Chris Evans?
I honestly don't know who I love more in this video,dogs or Chris❤️🤗
Buff Loki
Chris switching gears and being gentle with the older dogs made him 100x more attractive. The man is such a sweetheart
Imagine chris as loki
окей Гугл, как стать puppy?
When he answered "Downey" for being the actor he listened from the most 💓
His laugh is the best 😂
I can't even...!!!! My heart! ❤
Dogs are his cryptonite 😊❤️🤩
I just realized who has the same deep and sultry laugh ... Jonathan Groff. 😍😍😍
Wish i was a puppy
Have him playing with kittens
ROBERT DOWNRY JR
His face! The most happy 🥰🥰🥰🐕🐶🦮🐕‍🦺🦊🐺 all the pups every kind.
I’ve never wanted to be a dog so bad
Chris acts like I would act  with puppies. " Who cares... PUPPIES!!!!!"  xD All the puppies can defeat cap America :) xD
Looks so cute with puppies and Chris Evans wait Knives Out guy # Knives Out
Never wanted to be a puppy so bad!!😂😂😂
Soooo cute 😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love how they literally named it "Chris Evans plays with puppies" and cut the "while answering fan questions" cause he wasn't answering anything
i love how he's way more interested in playing with the puppies than actually answering these questions HAHA
That looks like sooooo much fun.
BenibendenalırsansanataparımseksomanyakizindeyizAtatürkyataktadakaruyad🧿🧿🧿
The amount of serotonin this releases, I SWEAR.
Thanks for your endless love and support you have constantly shown me. I’m forever grateful. I really appreciate your unconditional love and support towards me..Which city are you in?
I flooded my basement…
" What is the question you'd be wish'd to got asked?" Who cares?
This whole interview is so unhinged and I live for it - it's just Chris trying to mentally convince himself he doesn't need 8 more puppies at home 😂
the puppies are name busters
I can't decide.  Who looks cuter, Chris Evans or puppies?🥺
wow he has a good heart 💜
Why is he the cutest man on the face of earth
“Come get it” 😂
I wish I was one of those puppies.
I honestly don't know who's cuter; the puppies or Chris jwi0jdqwio0 (and of course also the older dogs, they're also cute <333)
When Loki season 2 comes out y'all should get Tom Hiddleston to do a puppy interview
I wonder if dodger got jealous and packed all of his things and throw `em outside his house.
All interviews need dogs.
Wow bro
literally best interview im crying
one thing i can say with all certainty is that if he switched to animation most of his coleages wouldn't care if he was a movie star before or that he'd be slightly older than the average junior. I have found they will be more excited about an animaton supervisor on like a nothing movie than a list celebs (its no offence just different priorites). the oldest junior animator (or becoming cause it was in school) was 60 and he just got bored of his job so was switching it.
This is what being blasted with serotonin looks like haha
Chris Evans is the sweetest.  He's so lovable like those puppies.
He just wanted to play with the dogs
This was definitely the best interview and the most awaited by everyone.  Chris Evans with puppies 🖤
The video title is actually correct. All he does is play with puppies, he's so bad at answering the questions asked 😭
2:16
Between 2:14 and 2:22 were the best moments of the interview for me. 😁😁😁
Why is no one talking about “Scarlett’s my girl” I CAN’T 😭😭😭
Technically, he did play Loki in Thor the dark world. For 5 seconds
Yakira yakira yakira ♥️❤️🙏🙏
Can we get a Tom Cruise playing with puppies 🥺
A golden retriever in his Natural Habitat.
Endorphins overload
His laugh is amazing 😂😂🤣🤣
Husband material
The way he looks at the dog's eyes and says: "Hey pal, thanks for trusting me" 😭😭😭😭 I died right there
MY FAVORITE INTERVIEW OF ALL TIME
Evans is himself one adorable pup!
How have I never seen this before y’all are actually fake
This man needs a house full of dogs and babies😂
Lucky puppies 🥺🥺
😂 oh it’s Lloyd
Ele tem razão.  Não tem sentimento melhor do que criar confiança com um cachorro.
I've got an exam in 30 minutes, thank you Chris Evans for calming my anxiety
“hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself” 🤣🤣
I can see Dodger just getting mad jealous at these puppies
Chris ❤️
How i can be a dog???
Omg love soo cute 😁💫💓
I wish part of my job was to hang out with puppies 😭
Eu amo meu Deus
He could GET IT anyday
I could listen to Chris Evans read the phone book
😊
RELEASEEE THE UNCUT VER!!!!!!
I love that these are usually "[Celebrity] plays with puppies and answers questions," and this one just gives up on the questions part.
I like both of them that you are holding Chris
STRAY KIDS NEXT
0:29 “I expect like waterfalls of puppies” 😭😭😭
Someone: did you watch the Chris Evan’s puppy interview? Me: oh yeah  Someone: so what did they ask him questions about? Me: Hm?
A 2 year old dog is a 14 year old teenager in human years. Because they are 7 years old in human years every year.
Is no one gonna talk about the dog at 8:16?? I about died when Chris said “😱 S’cuse you!”
i never really realized his accent was that prominent in his speech til this interview lol can really hear the east side in him
every dog is buster to him 😭😭
Why is Chris Evans so entertaining with dogs lol
I would also like to add that Chris Evans is the only celebrity ever that wanted to include older dogs in their the Buzzfeed Playing With Puppies interview. KUDOS to you, Chris! 👏👍❤❤❤❤❤
Chris Evans must be protected at all costs.💪 He is the most precious man to ever exist.🥰 How on earth is he still single??????????😲 Thank you Buzzfeed for FINALLY giving us Chris Evans playing with puppies. It was better than I ever imagined.❤
This impossibly handsome man with the genuine personality and infectious laugh is making me feel very inferior but he's so darn adorable that I have developed a man crush on him.....dayum you, Chris Evans! Oh, and yeah, the puppies are cute too. This video is guaranteed to give you cavities because it's so sweet.
I love how our Evans just highlights the original avengers. -Scarlett's my girl😍 -Renner would be trouble🔥 -Downey would be a lot of fun🤗 -Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself👊
t school😘😘 extra✌✌
Even the puppies knows he so attractive
cuándo skz
Lucky Dog at his Crotch
I just wish he laid down so the puppies could feast on him. gawd, I never wanted to be a puppy so badly in my life until now. 😩
Sebastian stan nexts!!
This should be called “Chris Evans laughing for 8 minutes and 45 seconds”
This made me really like Chris Evans…didn’t even know who he was, but now I’m gonna watch all his movies ☺️
La mejor entrevista hasta ahora con perritosss!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Cried my eyes out.
5:18 I'd simply die watching this part. He comforts that puppy😭😭😭😭😭😭
His laugh is so so so beautiful 😭😭😭😭😭
I just came back to rewatch this everyday because it cures my depression.
His beautiful genuine laugh please I'm crying
I’m a huge fan of Chris Evans but these puppies are too precious. I couldn’t stop watching them instead of listening the interview. The only thing I can say is that I want to see more movies where he is a villain and I can’t want anything more than Ramson !! More Ramson !!
The one that has a blue collar like Scooby Doo 😭😭😭😭
Just remembering Bang Chan fangirling over this...
This is the funniest thing I’ve seen all day
I would become an actor just for this
que homem, meu deus do ceu
Adam Driver portraying Chris Evans makes me feel things.
his Boston accent makes me weak in the knees😭
POR DIOS TODO UN LINDO
Yicem ya
PLEASE WE WANT A CHRIS EVANS READING THIRST TWEETS I BEG YOU
adorable
Love how he just turns into a wise old man with the older dogs
❤️❤️❤️
As entrevistas com Tom Holland foram mais divertidas e caóticas, Tom é como um filhote, mas Chris é tão amoroso, cuidadoso e protetor.
I can watch this all day.❤️
His nephew accent "I don't know" again haha cuteee
How about cats ? Does Chris like them ?
okay but now you HAVE to do Sebastian Stan
Him not answering properly and just focus on the puppies. Like, I would do the same
Socks isn't gonna like this.
Gusto ko mahimong iro whaaaaaackkkk
my comfort video
Now we need Jamie Bower to play with puppies
Very cute
Muito fofo
Nice he Like of dogs cute
I wanna be a puppy rn 😝
Omg this video rips my guts out!! 😍😍😍😍
I ought to punch his parents for making such a fine man
É um ser iluminado...ama os animais...aí que amor 😍❤❤❤
Cutie baby😘❤️❤️
I would give anything to have been one of those puppies for that interview. 🤗😍Lol  That being said, I think Chris would have made a phenomenal Veterinarian. He seems to have a deep love for dogs and a gentle handling of them...especially the older rescue dogs.   The absolute look of euphoria being around all that puppy energy shines with him.
Aww,Chris es re lindo JAJAAJAJ
okay but when said "Scarlett's my girl" 😭
Idk why watching this video makes me believe that if Chris one day has children’s he would definitely be a great father, he is just so sweet and kind <3
The Baby Voice 2:43
You so need one or three more dogs...
Omg this is sooo sweet, 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Puppies are so precious 💕
Bubba? Is Chris Jewish? 😁
I wish I was those puppies for Chris to pet me... :(
This makes me want to cry 🥺
that 'Excuse you' puppy was me
Still waiting for the coming out...Oh wait..too much money involved🤔
I love you captain America 😍😍😍😍😍😍👑👑👑👑👑👑
Focus Chris 😆 🐶
Cuteness overload
This man is BEAUTIFUL!
Dear Buzzfeed, Would it be possible for me to be 'puppy interviewed' even though I - am not famous (and have no intention to become so) - live in Italy? 😻😻😻 ♡♡♡♡♡♡
I want to be a puppy and sniff every inch of his superior human body
Random Question: Chris: Who cares?!😂😂😂
is it just me that wishes i was one of these puppies😂🥺
This is the best one
Buldular şirin adamı akdlslös
Older dogs need love too.
Anyone who loves pups is ok with me
Great time adorable pups
the puppies have time to scratch their ears, play and bite each other and pay some attention to a man.
OK WE NEED HIM TO DO ANOTHER ONE LIKE NOW!!!!!!!!!
NAME OF THIS SHIRT anyone pleaseeee
How is Chris single? He seems like such a wholesome guy, really down to earth and amazing with dogs. Like what woman wouldn't want that?
His Bostonian accent was loud and clear during this entire interview! Him with the puppies was adorable, but once the older dogs came out my heart fully belonged to him~
Love Chris Evans!  Besides being so hot, he is just so human & down to earth. Dogs love him, because they know good people when they smell them & get loved with kindness.
Right out the gate with “who cares?”  🤣🤣🤣
Hands down...the BEST Chris.
If Chris was allergic to dogs I’d kms.
Its Chris heavens🥰😍🤩😇
These are the best interviews. Whoever came up with this idea is brilliant! You really get to see how they are.
Este es el mejor vídeo del mundo.
Woof woof woof
‘Lets’s build some trust’ is exactly what I want to hear a guy say 🥰
Asawa ko ohh
You are not a actor you are over actor 🙄
Yeah so looks like Buster is gonna get a new home soon hahah
I am his puppy
AYO what?!?! Chris Evans wanted to be an animator?!?! 👀😯
I’ve never wished that I was a dog until now
the last puppy is me
I think he needed more pups and they need to b close. Give this man a play pen
He is Euphoric 😁😁😁
The thing with Adam driver made me burst out laughing oml
I would let him step on me for free <3 just saying , good video btw
the puppies definitely know sho's chris evans is
NOOOOO SO CUTEEEE
Can someone please tell me what breed these dogs are
RIP replay button 😁 This is just soooo adorable ❤️❤️❤️
Best video on Internet
All of those dogs names is Buster
Who cares… ❤️
Take a shot every time he says who cares. Thats would be a fun game.
The "excusse you" at the end was so funny and adorable ☺️
That "Excuse you." Is the cutest bit!
I feel the 8.4k dislikes on this video are all jealous bfs 🤔🤣 What is there not to love about Chris w/ adorable puppers?? 🤩
aaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy😍quien fuera perro
This exactly how I could act if put in a room full of puppies too
sweetest person ever
I’m just here smiling. 🫶🏻
Omg he called every dog buster brown. That's the cutest thing ever!
The way he smiles every time he remembers that he has a pack of puppies circling him is priceless.😊💕🐕
Super man 👨 👌 🙌 👏 ❤ 💙 👨 Super 🐕 dog
I just want to say: THIS MAN.
Hes right   THIS IS THE BEST INTERVIEW FOR HIM EVER!
I wanna be the dogs
Chris Evans wanted to be an animator when he was younger!!!!😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰💜💜💜💜
Omg i want to puppy interview him too 🫠 too much cuteness in one video ❤️‍🔥
His child like joy being around these puppies makes my heart melt ! So genuine and so pure 💜 you just know he is a good person!
Gosh 💕 i Adore 🥰 U ❤️💖❤️
Captain america ladies and gentlemen
Return of the Mack is a hilarious answer
Scarlett's my girl 😭
Henry cavill nowww!!!!
I love how he just went "oh, hy guys" and checked out from the interview completely 😂😂😂  ... and I completely understand him  who cares about stupid questions under a cascade of puppies? 😄  edit: I adopted my Astro, the handsome guy in the profile pic, when he was already 3yo and I can confirm: there's no better feeling than earning a dog's trust. It's a whole journey, but there's nothing more rewarding ❤
♡♡♡ could watch this for hours, to give him & to give the pups all breaks, keep different pups n different talents rotating ♡♡♡ the joy is too adorable ♡♡♡ p.s. all dogs are pups or doggos, no matter the age
They way he treats the seniors dogs just got my heart beating faster.  Chris Pine has not disappointed me.
6:34 he is so great and respectful with the older dogs, it made me teary
The dog at 8:17 is real sneaky HAHAHAAHAHA
Yes, God. I would like to be a puppy. Yep, right about now please.
I knew almost nothing of Chris Evans and now I think I love him 😍😂
This is the single most adorable interview ever.
Who cares is the answers of most of the questions 😄 he did not even hear the questions.🤣 and even did not see in the  eyes of the interviewer once... This the cutest interview.
How many times did he say "hiii"? 🤣🤣🤣
Lindo Chris Evans 😍❣️
I actually teared up when he said "thanks, bud. Thank you for trusting me " with the older dogs
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHRIS EVANS VIDEO NOW 🥹
*I'm so drunk because I took a shot each time Chris said "Buster" in this video*
i wish Paul Walker was alive. It would have been nice to see a puppy interview with him.
He is high on puppies 😂❤️❤️
this interview is not long enough
i never knew a video could give me SO MUCH SEROTONIN
Robert Downey Jr Kitten Interview.. just throwing it out there
They kind of stole the concept from hot ones
Every single dog is named Buster Brown for Chris 😂
I heard buzzlightgear sucked
This is one of the most wholesome things I have ever seen
Next time play with cats for the cat lovers!❤❤
Minsan gusto ko na lang maging aso
this. is. everything. i. needed…. thank you… SO MUCH
Watching this on mute
Never heard him sound so Boston before 😂
Those are some lucky puppies…  And wasn’t there already a movie based on Rex?
The fact that he answered Robert Downey Jr. as fellow actor he learned from the most really warms my heart🥺 "You'd be a fool to not listen (to him)" ❤
_I can watch this all day_  🥺🥺
This is the interview I didn’t know I needed 😊💗
Well, I’m watching again for the 100th time
I bet you after this interview he wanted a puppy.
Chris and puppies in one video. This is my guilty pleasure😅❤❤
“Scarlett’s my girl” !!!
He can literally voice both buzz and woody
Where do they get all these puppies from?
This wonderful human knows dogs 🥰
You can really hear Chris Evans' Boston accent in this. I love it!
Can we get one with  Taron egerton  Willem dafoe  Or Marty short ....Please!!
You should have brought Dodger and let him pick a puppy for himself.
Best puppy interview ever!!
he is the epitome of cute agression
I've waited so long for this video..... and now that's it here.....       I'm so happy!!! He's so much like Steve Rogers I can't stand it 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 I could watch him play with dogs all day long!!!
Who care ? I just love him
Did you spray bacon flavor Cologne on you I know I would
Is it just me, or did his accent start to come out more with the older puppies?
my oxytocin and serotonin levels are through the roof just by watching this 😆❤️😭
Yessss adopt the older dogs because they eventually ( vets ) kill them off ! Chris is so handsome
Am I the only one that thought of the dog buster from toy story, when Chris kept calling the puppies buster?
This is the biggest serotonin boost
I could watch this all dayy long!!😍😭
3 seconds in and my ovaries are spitting out eggs like a broken gumball machine.
I think it was so funny after calling the grey collared one, “Sweet,” he was immediately seen fighting with another dog. I guess Chris Evans will do that to you. I kind of would like an update as to whether these cuties were adopted?
Scarlet is my girl 🥹💖💖💖💖💖
Chris is exactly my response to puppies 😅
I love how ALL the dogs are "Buster" no matter what.
You need to adopt that Buster Brown! Love This
YES! Let’s give older doggies some love too! My sister’s rescue dog, a 6 year old beagle mix, took a while to trust people, including myself, but now she gets so excited when she sees me. She’s the sweetest little friend I could ask for, so thankful I have this pup in my life 💙
Interviewer: asks question  Chris: who cares!!
Ok, honestly, I love Chris, but when I see animals I see nothing else. Who cares what he says: puppies 😍😍😍😍
♥️
Dear BuzzFeed Celeb, please please invite Matthew Gray Gubler to read thirst tweets!! I will do anything (legal) to make that happen! Please please!!!!
Chris chegando em casa com cheiro de cachorrinhos. O Dodger: 🤨🤨🤨 tava me traindo é piranha?
Me: *googles how to be a puppy*
"They are zo zweet" - Chris Evan battling his need of adopting them all
He got a few bucks in his pocket and turned into a beta weirdo
Caption should read "Puppies play with Chris Evans"!
226k thirsty moms out there we see.
a golden retriever meeting puppies
He completely surrendered to the puppy force 😭🥰🐕
❤🐾🐶🐾❤🐾🐶🐾❤🐾🐶🐾❤🐾🐶🐾❤🐾🐶🐾❤🐾🐶🐾❤🐾🐶
I wish he would pet me like that🫤
It's crazy how much Chris Evans sounds, acts, and looks like my pastor.
In the second video ofTom Holland with the puppies he says that Chris Evans should do the puppies interview, it's very cute. He vocalized the popular clamor, reinforcing our pleas. 🥰✊🏻👏🏻🐶
Can I be one of the puppies? 😂
His laugh is everything, it gives me life ☠️😭
Chris in ***Pure Heaven*** playing with puppies and meeting senior pupsters is THE... MOST... wholesome and heartwarming "interview" lol I have EVER seen. The compassion, the playful nature, the attentiveness and the respect. 🥺 my heart.
I'm watching the video in loop hahahaha
where do i sign up to be one of the puppies in this interview?
BRING TAYLOR SWIFT FOR AN INTERVIEW WITH KITTENS PLS
"scarletts my guuurl" idk why that was just so cute XD
the way he calls all of them buster
La poca estabilidad emocional depende de el :'³
The best  puppy  dog 🥺🥺
someone wishing to be one of those puppies to meet dear captain america lol
Love his smile 🥰😍
we can bark
NOW WE NEED SEBASTIAN STAN!!!!!
This is definitely THE most toughest interview ever for any dog lover. I mean just look at those pups🥺🥺
I love how he”answers” the questions  while being drunk on puppies
“scarlett’s my girl” 😩😩
The older dogs are VIBING
8:13 excuse you
Dodger needs a sibling
Tim  allen would have been better to continue except you decided he isnt woke enough reason 10000000 why i do not subject my kids to this bs
@1:00 💗
when is this man going to get married and give us children? i need to see this man with children
Oh my gosh that white dog at the end.  What a cutie!  It made my heart explode. We adopted an older dog.  She was a tiny miniature poodle and had had a hard life. She'd had a horrific back injury that was never treated, and was in significant pain. She needed to have all her teeth removed, and was as deaf as a post. Her eyesight wasn't great either.  She walked sideways because of her back.  She was the sweetest little muffin that ever lived.  Oh my gosh. She didn't know why I was putting all this nasty tasting stuff in her mouth, but once she figured out that I wanted to do it, she would submit and take it even though she didn't understand why. All that nasty tasting stuff really helped her be as pain free as possible in her last months. She lived only another 14 months. I love her so much. Senior dogs are so precious.
I've not meant an abusive man who can possibly display that kind of patience, compassion, and love towards an animal. To be fair, I haven't met them all, but I'm thinking Chris is on the up and up. At least I hope so.
This and Keanu one are the best dog interviews
he is so cute, i really want to cry!! 🥺🥺 btw: this is not fair, why also these puppies are luckier than me? why? 😩 those puppies really fell in love with him, we all understand them!!
Chris hemsworth should do a puppy interview
My entire heart!!!!
I love how he just lies down with the puppies like "Take me now!"
Giant puppy plays with smaller puppies. 😁🌻
Well I can make animation actually
Money can't buy you happiness, but it can buy you a boat load of puppies!
I love Chris Evans. Because he is so funny and handsome 😍
ooh my ovaries😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤❤❤
Chris Evans is just a good hearted soul. The puppies did their thing and had a good time plopping and wallowing and tail wagging all over him, and he was so sweet to the older dogs and really knew their needs. Not all people know how to show love to all God's creatures and the "less thans" of the world. Chris Evans and Keanu Reeves. God bless these guys!
guys he used to have an iphone 6 at the time this was shot.
I love how excited Chris is 🥺
Cap weakness is puppies 🥰
This video is why Chris should be president of Earth!!
And the interview ends with Chris Evans adopting all the dogs lol.  that seems like the natural conclusion
Chris Evans’ entire life was leading up to this moment.
He is adorable 🥰
just hi buddy, hi pal 😂
The fact that it was Chris’ idea to bring on the senior dogs too. He was so sweet and patient with them. And he’s right that there’s something special about older dogs. Chris is just a gem of a human.
We got him wooo
This is therapy.
Puppies are so lucky. Licking him, touching him.
Never thought I’d see my boi Steve Rogers go from lifting Thor’s Hammer to playing with puppies.He is a awesome and caring guy!🙂
Steve Fucken Rogers
Why has Tom Hardy not done one?????
His cute aggression response was out of control here lmao
Chris Evans really is one of the best actors in all of Hollywood. How he went so many MCU movies pretending to be an American patriot who cares about compassion, freedom, justice, and morality is truly an impressive feat of acting.
My God get him away from these precious babies. He will probably be abusing them as well and little children By the way we will not be dying out it will be your kind. Those are living creatures not toys STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Black looks at captain America and is like “seriously dude come on dogs chase cats and I take offense to that” 😂
so cute ....tickled
Lil serotonin boost.
I think I have just fallen in love...with all those puppies...
job interviews should be with puppies 😂
AHHHH I LOVE CHRIS SO MUUUUCCHHH HEEEESSS SOOOOO CUUUTTTEEEE I MEAN HIS REACTIONS TO THE PUPPIES ARE EVEN CUTER THAN THE PUPPIES THEMSELVES AHHHH i think chris evans just cured my depression
Ok I thought this was going to be a different Chris Evans, don’t know who this guy is. 🇬🇧
*who cares* is my new motto
Cute... puppies...
Chris - you are the best!
Always loved Chris Evans. Now I love him the most. I will always trust people who love animals more than anybody else.
Nobody cares is the most right answer to give
I can tell Chris could honestly care less about the questions
Chris is not Captain America, he's Captain Puppy. Even SpideyTom was more focused. When do we have one with Thor and Loki ?
https://youtube.com/shorts/Ns-4cl6OxRM?feature=share
This is so bloody wholesome
Nice
He once play Captain America and now Buzz Light-year
💚❤️🇵🇹👍🏻
I would commit a felony to have Chris Evans host the Puppy Bowl...
The biopic question and that Chris chose Adam driver is a interesting pick tbh probably Chris seen his work for sure I mean not a bad pick tbh
“Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself” I CANNOT LMAOO
THIS IS MY NEW HAPPY PILL! 🥰
Looks like Buster is Chris Evans's favourite name😅
“Bubba”🥲
Chris Evans didn't care about the interview He just wanted the puppies
A perfeição existe, e se chama: Chris Evans, brincando com cachorrinhos. ❤️🥰
Aahhh my ovaries.. 😭😭😭
I love that it's not even titled as a puppy interview, it's just Chris Evans playing with puppies
i think the dogs like the way he tastes
I am: BEGGING for elizabeth olsen to finally do this
https://youtu.be/bsV1KlYqNb0
I can see him adopt them all...he's so happy to see puppies
Petition to get Chris Evans with puppies Part 2 when he’s promoting The Grayman! 🐶🐶🐶
He’s just in absolute heaven and it’s adorable 🥰
I love the props question 🤣🤣🤣🤣
WE WANT CHRIS AND TOM BACK!!! Please buzzfeed 😍😍😍
I’m in loooove 😩😩😩😍😍😍
buzzfeed besties we need a kit connor puppy interview asap
Jensen ackles and puppies I beg
Ava puppy america
Just saw this; oh my , the more I learn about Chris Evans, I am so impressed by his honesty and kindness. I’m sure he would take all of them home if he could!  That’s our Captain Rogers 😘
:D
I would probably be the same as Chris because I love fur babies.
chris evans real idiot...
I didn't pencil in a cry sesh today, but the him speaking up for senior dogs and understanding the importance and honor of earning their trust got me. Another bonus for anyone considering an older pupper is skipping the work of training them, shark bites, and ruined shoes. What a sweet man🥰
Sad thing is thrise dogs have a higher IQ and chris has been proven to be more trainable
I love him so much
Damn, he has a heart of gold ❤🐶
He sounds drunk. There are too many puppies in his system.
Meanwhile Dodger watching this on his laptop, squeezing the life out of his lion toy and saying "let him get home."
If I was asked to do one of these interviews, I wouldn’t answer ANY questions and would end up bring all these dogs home
Chris evans has the personality of a golden retriever. And why is NO ONE talking abt his laugh 😭
My Seratonin levels after watching this 📈
Can we have a Henry Cavill version,  PLEASEEEE???!!!!
Hello?! Older dog right here, looking to be adopted. (I don't know what 55 is in dog years, but here I am, dude.) <3
'are they just gonna like come RUNNING in hereee?' 😭😭✨
idiot captain of the American colonists bastard.
He definitely did this interview for the puppies 😂❤️
randam ko ang gigil eh huhu labyu beh literal nahuhulog ako sobra sobra
he really came there to play with the puppies
guys i need help. i still think i have a chance with Chris Evans. The realistic side says gurl hes 40 freaking years old get a grip my lord it will never happen and there's another side telling me "its only 27 years" LIKE BRUH i know i dont have a chance but at the same time i think i do-
when you upload the one with stray kids please ♥
Chris Evans is gone, y'all. Gone. BuzzFeed started to doubt their idea with this interview.
"Thanks for trusting me bubba" aaaa my heart! Chris Evans has such a kind soul and heart and spirit, this was such a joy to watch. I feel all warm and fuzzy now 😌
Every womans ovaries just exploded
Fofo demais! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
When porn meet asmr.
I wonder what Dodger's reaction was when he could smell all the other dogs on his dad.
Niceeee love this  -Chewy
I wish i were one of these dogs
7:05 - 7:20 😭 so true
He honestly seems like he is in heaven
I love how he answers in a baby voice cos he's talking to the puppers 😂
the accent god the accent
i’ve been waiting for many years
The least informative interview literally ever
I wanna be those puppies so badly
Which puppy did he take home? 😘
When I'm having a bad day, this is now my new go-to video to brighten my day.  Thank you BuzzFeed and Chris Evans.
Two final thoughts on this video, wish I could be a puppy to lick that pretty face, and isn't Chris one of the most handsome actors? Aren't all the dogs the most beautiful creation ever?
Awwwwwwww
OMG 😅♥️
These are the best interviews ever
I think we found Captain American's weakness.
Crying 🤩🤩🤩😭😭😭😭😭💘
I wonder how long Dodger gave Chris the silent treatment after this
4:49 "about to go home with all these props" 😂
Now we need Henry Cavill with puppies!
in case you having a bad day, watch it!
okay but can we PLS get Miles Teller on one of these!!!!
When are we getting him reading thirsty tweets 😂
https://youtube.com/watch?v=3TzSx4xYL08&feature=share
https://youtube.com/watch?v=3TzSx4xYL08&feature=share
I didn't even listen to the interview I just looked at Chris and his love for the puppies 💞
gosh, when he feels overwhelmed with these puppies…
8:45 of pure serotonin. singlehandedly cured my depression.
All I can say is Chris Evans is a Dream 🥰🤩😍💯❗️
If you think you can't love Chris Evans any more than you do before watching this video you're wrong.
Buzzfeed, get Matthew Gray Gubler to do this now.
My whole life I said that gaining dog trust is the best feeling.
I SWEAR I THINK I SAID AWWW EVERY TIME THIS SUPER FINE MAN SAID “hey buster”
2 OF THE ABSOLUTE CUTEST THINGS ON THE PLANET CHRIS AND PUPPIES
this is the best interview than i ever seen.  if u love puppies and chris evans this in incredible.
I love you forever, Chris!!! 😍😍😍😘😘😘
Chris calling every single dog “Buster” singlehandedly cured my depression
“Who cares” is the only appropriate answer to any question asked while you’re playing with puppies.
Honestly just scrap the questions and just give us Chris playing with puppies for 10 minutes. LOL
Ok... I'm officially in love with Chris Evans!
I want to be that one dog
8:15 i wish i was that puppy
Please I want a part two tooooo... This man is the best thing to ever happen to someone 💙
i’m crying over how sweet he is with the older dogs 😭😭😭
The fact that he keeps calling the puppies the same name is making me get confused on which is who
I literally thought of Return of the Mack a second before he answered. I was not expecting him to say that at all. And that song was out a year after I was born lol. Great song tho and great minds think alike haha.
Chris Evans calling dogs "buster" and Steve Carell calling dogs "sweetie" has  been the highlight of my afternoon. 🥰
Someone photoshop all the puppies out
Someone photoshop all the puppies out
My face hurts from smiling for 9 minutes.
The way his voice and demeanor changes with the older dogs. Sweetest man on the planet!
The puppy bit was adorable but the part with the senior dogs? The way he even changed the tone of his voice... so lovely 🖤
Speecless
Oh my goodness watching this is so adorable. He can’t get enough of the pups!
He's SO HAAAAPPPYY ♥️😭
My puppy, Pugsley is the cutest! Sorry. Chris would love him and my husbands guide dog. His dog is so cute too .
he IS the puppy
Now trying to somehow Manifest an Andrew Garfield puppy interview…
this is the most wholesome thing ever
Chris Evans being puppy drunk for 8minutes and 44 seconds
He's in love with the puppies and we're in love with him 😍😍😍
i could watch this for hours
chris in this interview  answering questions: 5% playing w/ puppies and calling all of them buster: 95%
Henry cavill
Please we need one with henry cavill 😭
Ok Chris physically can’t focus
I’ve never wanted to be a puppy before
I'm pretty sure he accepted this invitation just to play with puppies.
The gentleness and compassion he shows to the older dogs was beautiful to see 😍🥹
What’s happening to me! I’m..🧍…🚶…🧎…🐕
I simply love that he didn’t answer any of those questions right, because he was too mesmerized by the puppies. Chris has one of the most beautiful souls on the earth, he’s too captivating, its easily explained why everyone falls in love with him. God knows how long i’ve been waiting for this video……..
This cures past, present, and future depressing days for me!!!! That’s how amazingly sweet and positive this is!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lucky dogs! 🥰🥰🥰🤤
This brought many smiles to my face. Thank you!😊
I would have watched this without the questions.
8:13 “excuse you”
his sister is my cousins teacher and his mom lives on the same street as them and my cousins have met him and I can confirm he is in fact like this in real life
chris evans is an actual teddy bear
Whether you like him or not: He *is* a good person and I don't need to tell you why.
Hear me out…. HARRY STYLES, please :)
To see the animal lover dimension of beloved actors is just amazing!
Heaven right there
6:30 I've adopted two senior dogs of whom there was no background history for  and it has been the best time of my life.  I know everyone goes crazy over puppies, but seniors can be just fun, just as loving, and just as worth it.
I Love Chris Evans and Love these actors playing with puppies videos but can we some actresses like Margot Robbie and Jessica Chastain also I would love to see a video of Rob Zombie playing with puppies too I know he has a soft side it would be fun to see it 🥰
Why does Chris Evans looks better and hotter now that his older compare to when he was younger??? I've watch him in Fantastic Four many years ago and Ioan Gruffudd was more attractive in that movie... Some men just age like fine wine!!
THEY INCLUDED SENOIR DOGS😭😭😭😭😭
His laugh is my favorite thing in this world 😩😩😩
I love his laugh while getting puppyttacked
This is literally like watching the sweetest thing on the planet 😭😭😭
If they turned this into a movie, I’d watch it!!
he is so loving with the dogs!
Thank you for including the elder dogs too 🙏🏻 hopefully, with each interview the sweet animals will all find good homes!
This video relaxed me so much Lol
“Come get it” 🥹🥹 oh my heart can’t take it❣️
Good job bubba
Hi guys, hi guys , hi guys- I LOVE THIS MAANNNN
Hi-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I gu-u-u-u-u-uys
this is true therapy....i love it
If I get to choose how i die...i would choose to get a heart attack from playing with puppies and dying in their cuteness
😤😒It's an impossible question to answer 🙄🧔 ...... 💖✨you got a scratch pal?🌸🐶
I have a Great Dane puppy that needs a really good home. Cool. Thanks
What’s wrong with you people
omg 😍😍💕💕
Same Chris. Same. All anyone needs is a waterfall of puppies 🤣
Tai
FOR FREEEEEEEEEE?????!!!!!!????!!!!?????!!!!
We've lost him.....We've lost Chris....MAN DOWN! REPEAT.....MAN.....DOWN, lmao  Probably the best Puppy Interview EVER!
Before I got on YouTube I had an awful day an was gonna just go to bed sad, I watched exactly 3 Chris Evans videos and I feel Like I can take on the world he's just a ball of sunshine!
He can do this all day...
I don't know whats cuter the puppies or Chris Evans 😂😂😂
This totally saved him from that Toy Story fiasco.
Part 2 immediately please
The quiet puppy😭
I’m so happy right now
I’m actually crying like there are tears streaming down my face rn this is the best thing I have ever seen
So what I’ve learned today is how to seduce Chris Evans and general men with puppies. And I’m not mad about it.
the way he speaks to the older dogs compared to the puppies 😭😭😭🥺
Omg him building trust with the senior dogs is so sweet and underrated
I can’t decide which is more adorable, him or them....
I don't think I've ever heard this mans voice make the noises that he made in this 😭 he was high on puppies
Just when you thought Chris Evans couldn't be even more perfect.❤️
You know you've made it when you do a Buzzfeed interview with puppies video.
I’m pregnant
PROTECT THIS MAN AT ALL COSTS ❤️
"thanks for trusting me bubba" :((
The thought of one of those dogs being female did not cross his mind
the human retriever with the cutest doggos :(
Love Chris Evans and the fact he loves dogs so much makes me love him even more. ❤️
I LOVE THAT HE BROUGHT OLD DOGS TOO!!!!!
handsome guy and cute puppy perfect combination
i bet all of those dogs are smartbrave
8:15 The dog full on took advantage and did it-
"GUUUYYYEEEZZZ?!!"
Kristen Stewart & Timothee Chalamet please! ♡
bro hes like high on puppies lmao
Notice how much more calm and careful with the older dogs? You can’t fake that.
I watch this when I need serotonin
LOVE THE SHIRT ?!
He's a gift to this world 😭😭😭
Chis be like : AVENGERS Assemble
the fact that the whole crew in front of him is laughing too is just hilarious to me cuz theyre all realizing that Chris with puppies will not be fast interview at all😆😂Hes like who cares about the questions i hAvE dOggOssssss  also can I just say how much i love the respect he treats these dogs with i love that so much cuz there are a lot of people who dont really get that
serotonin boost of the year
I think I would be a happy puddle of goo if there is ever a Chris Evans and Tom Holland puppy interview.   This was such a sweet video.
Chris FINALLY gets his puppy interview 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
HE FINALLY GOT HIS PUPPY INTERVIEW!
need him as much as i hate dogs
The best part about this is that even Buzzfeed recognized that Chris was only there for puppies, not questions, and so the title just says "Chris Evans plays with puppies" XD
Not me having to re-watch the whole thing multiple times because I got engrossed watching Chris Evans play with those cuties,I totally didn't see the questions.
Not him giving short answers so he can carry on talking to the puppies
I can’t imagine no one watching this interview without smiling😩
Why?  This some form of damage control for Lightyear and the bs he's said?
“Buster Brown” really loved him, I wish Chris would’ve taken him home
His accent is coming out 😍😍😍
Lo más tierno
Siempre Chris
El mejor
Combate
Lo amoo
This is now my favourite interview ever… it’s going to be my comfort when I need cheering up ❤️
Chris Evans is me with puppies
the only time I wished I was a dog 😅
“Chris is asked a question” Chris: Puppies 🥰
Chris: this is the best interview of my life  Me: this is the best interview of my life too
oh no! what’s happening to me 🧍‍♀️..🏃‍♀️..🐕
Who cares,,😁  With all the puppies . Who cares  Best answer 👏 ❤️❤️🤣
waiting for timothee chalamet
Chris couldn’t care less about the questions !
Chris with any dog ever "Hey, Buster ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️"
Best interview I have ever seen. I smiled the whole entire interview. Chris Evens is such a sweetheart ❤️
Dear god, he’s an angel. The way he’s interacting with the older doggos has melted my heart.
Chris Even Playing with puppies!? I think my head and heart just exploded!!
Puppies! A bundle of joy.  Smoochie times gets the better of you.
Even the puppies are like "Oh my god, its Chris Evans!"
okay now do a puppy interview with pedro pascal you cowards
Was waiting for "I can do this all day" line
Chris laugh is everything 🤣
LOUIS TOMLINSON WITH PUPPIIESS
can andrew garfield be next !!!
I can't!
When Chris brought senior dogs, I'm not crying you're crying 😭
Aww sooo cute.
Imagine being a dog and being able to lick Chris Evans
I'd watch this forever!! ToT
8:15 hope i can be that puppy
Something is not genuine
My type of person I love puppies they are so cute 😍 captain America The human torch and Casey Jones is my favorite actor that plays as them you are awesome man
I just fell in love with this man
Come on even puppies likes him  He's really a good man 🐱
3:31 me too
I love how he barely answers the questions and is all about the puppies 😆
3:55 After Chris’ answer, Mackie and Sebastian: That Evans is a problem.
Can we just have a channel of Chris Evans playing with Puppies from different shelters. But he has to be answering questions and the production quality should be high; just like this, but 1x a week (I'm fine with everyday honestly)
I like how he's so chill about the questions and is just there to have fun with the puppies... Well older dogs too.💖 Chris Evans seems like an incredible sweet man
Hey buster..hey pal....
“You look a little nervous. It’s okay pal🥹 GOD” 😂
We must protect Chris Evans at all costs. He's such a sweetheart.
I NEED PART 2 ALREADY
i just died woah what
I've watched this 50x and I still can't get enough.  This is one of the best puppy interviews. This and Tom Holland.
We must protect this guy by any cost and whatever it takes
Yup  Now bring that to my job 🤣
8:16 I can't blame her/he ☠️
hands down the best puppy interview so far. THIS is the content i needed lolol
I love how grown adults go into babytalk mode with puppies ... "Hi bubby", lol  Adorable!! (triple likes) 🧸🧸🧸
Legit I don't know how they manage to leave that set without sneaking a puppy under their shirt and just walking out with it. xD
I was so focused on the puppies I didn’t even read the questions so I had no idea how Chris could even answer them
I knew saving this to my favourites for a free boost of serotonin was going to be a good move
He got attached to that one dog lol
"Bubba" 💜💜💜💜
I just love his voice and you can tell how comfortable and genuine with the pups he is because of it
my ovaries...He's just a dream
It just so cute how he calls every puppy buster.  *screaming internally*
Who are there after Chan's room
Did they play music from overcooked or is that just me
the last puppy at the end is sooo me
he's tickled pink!
I know NO ONE is perfect…. But some people get REAL close 😭😭😭😭😭
You should have Johnny Depp do one of these    These are always so much fun to watch! 😂💝
The amount of serotonin these videos give me is inexplicable...
He is so nice sweet and handsome and the dogs and puppies are adorable 🧡🧡🧡🧡 i love You Chris
We need one of these every month
He's just like me when being around puppies: uncontrollable laughter.😂😂 They ARE a man's best friend, after all. This is too cool, especially with the mature dogs. Fantastic moments!
He is in Puppy Heaven, while still being alive!!! I'm sure he stole one.
Te amo Chris JAJAJA
This guy just makes me so happy by existing. If i have bad day, i just come here to watch him playing with puppies and it fcking works
Me about to call every dog I see and play with ❤️Buster❤️
Okay I clicked on this because I thought it said "Chris Evans Plays With PUPPETS" and I got scared, so this is relieving
Chris Evans is drunk on puppies.
Adorable!!! This would absolutely be me but I'd pay even less attention to what they were asking...lol. I'd be going crazy too! I love dogs so much! ❤❤❤
this is what we’ve all been waiting for
On behalf of all women, thank you BuzzFeed. Thank you.
I literally CRIED when the senior dogs came in 🥲 I’m okay I’m okay
Im just smiling the whole time. Im really happy he exists ♥️
I love them all
The only time I wish to be one of those dogs
💲💲💲💲💲
i’m surprised he answered the questions 😂
He just didnt care about the interview at all and I totally get it.
Two of the things I love the most: Chris Evans and dogs!!!!!!
Why does seeing this God of a man play with puppies turn me on so much... Goddess I need help.
When he said "thanks for trusting me bubba"..oof ❤️
Henry Cavill next 😫
I think I account for 1K of the views on this one! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 #LizzoBetterWatchOut
Chris Evans and Austin Butler in the same week. THANK YOU BUZZFEED HAHAHAH
i would looove to see some interviews with cats too! that would be so sweet
I adored senior dog segment. Old dogs deserve Love for sure.
I work at a kennel/breeder, 2 of the dogs had puppies a few weeks ago, this is what I have to deal with everyday...
THE interview we've all being waiting forever for :)
You can tell a lot abt a person based off how they treat animals!
His laugh is so cute.
I'd actually love to see a movie for Jessie
HIS LAUGH IS SO CONTAGIOUS IM ON THE FLOOR
I love how it doesn’t even say interview. Exactly how it should be. It’s just Chris playin with puppies
If Chris Evans was my dad, I mean, no wonder I’m. Toooooooooo much like him
Has any of these celebrities ever adopted any of the puppies?. Chris would be the best puppy dad. He is so great with them.
Came here after Bang Chan from SKZ watched this. I see why he enjoyed it so much. This just healed my soul.
When Chris talked about the senior dogs my heart melted🥺
This is my go to 'cheer me up' video from now on.
Omg this is perfect
buzzfeed knows how to give the people what they want
"Come get it." Indeed.
So many ads before this video .they knew I'd wait
This is the best interview I have ever seen
This reminds me of some Hot Ones episodes, where the guests may go through really powerful, distracting, and/or borderline psychedelic experiences while trying their best to answer questions :D (Big difference: the questions on Hot Ones are world class, no comparison.) Chris Evans is clearly a super empathetic and compassionate person, it's a joy to see such wholesome masculinity as well :)
my life is complete thank you buzzfeed
I would like for Chris to call me Buster Brown while he meets my Buster Brown
I missed this guy so much geez.
bro someone just give him a baby
As expected he did not answer these questions nicely omg so cute m dieing 🥺🥺🥺💖💖😩
Glad he did this interview. Now he knows what it's like when we as fans get frustrated by his sweetness and beauty 😂😂
This is why I pay my wifi bill
The fact that he calls all of them 'Buster' and 'Buster Brown' is such an old soul kinda thing. Truly is Cap.
I like hearing the Mass accent come out a lil bit 😆
That smile ...love it
evans the  entire interview: My body is ready
Wish I could've been one of those puppies for the interview 🥰😍
I noticed that all the puppy interviews the guys are always squatting during the introduction waiting for the puppies
He sounds like he’s on anesthesia
it's so wholesome omg
chris u better adopt me, cz i can bark too
I want to be a puppy
Chris Evans is a Woke Beta Male......Come at me !
Questions were great!
i can't stop watching this!!!!!
I can’t stop smiling oml his laugh my soul
I need the uncut footage
Is he calling all of them Buster
I loved the part with the older dogs!!
Who needed Thanos when Cap could be brought down by half a dozen puppies?! 🐶
Chris evan with beard :what a look man
someone help me i need to marry this man
Oh.My.God. 😭
MY IDOL 8:16 lol
there is no way you can watch this and not smile
Omg!!! Cuteness overload!!! Chris is babe!!!!! I’m in love with him even more🥹😩😍💖💗he’s sooo humble and sweet!
I love how he answered to a total.of 3.5 questions and the rest was just having a time with the puppies 😂
BUZZFEED WE WANT PART TWO
Well, he got his waterfall of puppies ❤️🥰❤️
I wish I could be one of those dogs for like... 10 minutes  <3  My tall sweet drink of red white and blue. I love him  <3 <3
«Scarlett´s my girl» I CANT😩 they are platonic soulmates
Buster Brown :D
this cured my depression
If any video can cure my anxiety ... its this video right here
İ love dogsssss i love animalssss😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
petition to do robert downey jr next☹️
We need part two ✌
This video was not long enough, we need a 24 hour video of Chris Evans playing with puppies and also. Bring lizzo too
He said, “No disrespect to the puppies.” 🥹🥹
Can I be a puppy for 8 minutes?
Who is buster brown and how can I be him
*Chris trying to convince himself that he doesn't need another dog for 8 minutes 44 seconds*
“hi hi hi hi hi” ***laugh*** “hi hi hi hi hi hi”
Wow, never thought I would be jealous of little pups. He loves Buster.
This would be me. "What was the question? Oh, I just asked that? You know, just pick whatever answer you want, I'm busy playing with these cute widdle puppers!"
How can you not smile watching this
he's so sweet with them, clearly a dog lover and not just a casual puppy enthusiast 🥲
So tom holland has 2 videos of him playing pups and only one of chris evans ? NOT FAIR !!!!!!!!
“Come get it.” Is definitely on my things I wish Chris Evan’s said to me Bingo card
Never in my life I had felt so jealous of a puppy...
Here for my daily dosage of happiness
STOP IMAGINE HIM A DAD WITH THE “hiii” voice UGH IMMA HAVE HIS BABIES
This kinda reminds me of Age of Ultron interview. For future reference, don't interview Chris alongside playful companion (I'm looking at you puppies and Chris Hemsworth). He will be busy playing and gets distracted.
This man fighting so hard not to bring one of these dogs home
I'm gonna need Jon Bernthal to do this
Captain America in the Puppyverse of cuteness
I watch this video at least once a day. Like others say you smile & laugh without realising & your heart just melts. Serotonin boost .
This is the best thing I've ever seen 🥺🥺😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
I was smiling the whole video
We need to get him to read thirst tweets
“Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself” absolutely killed me. Imagine being as gorgeous as either one of them
I am speechless. I can now die happy after watching this.
I am now waiting for an Andrew Garfield puppy interview 🧍
Can I be one of those puppies 🥹❤️
This might be the best video I’ve ever watched in my life..
Ok this is the cutest, most tender video of this year
just think someone adopted a sweet pup who got to kiss chris evans haha
He respects puppies more than muslims!!!
#1 Dog Name of 2022: Buster 😄
I know you wish you were a puppy😂😂😂
I need the “Chris Evans read thirst tweets” video please 🙏🏼🙏🏼
We will definitely need a Puppy Interview Part 2 for Chris Evans this was too cute I couldn't decide who was sweeter the puppies or Chris 😍
Ughhh this man 😤 the only good thing that came out of Boston 😩
I understand his simps now
The puppies perfectly summing up how we all feel about Chris Evans!
This video should be, at least, 30 minutes. We deserved it, Chris deserved it, THE WORLD deserved it
This has completely healed me. Emotionally, physically, and spiritually.
How did I end up here? But I love it 😭❤️
so did he or did he not adopt all those puppies
“At what point of your career did you realize you “made it” as an actor” Chris Evans: *Have I* ? 🤣🤣
“Yes, I loved Toy Story… (sobs) when I was younger!” 1:28  😂 The cuteness took over his body.
Ok, they play with puppies but, do these puppies have families? Are these puppies up for adoption? ..., animals are not to be used for something like make a famous artist look cute, you know ...?
If someone asked me what was hawt AF, Chris Evans covered in puppies wouldn't have made the list...until now.
Chris Evans should come back to play the Hydra Variant of captain America
Is there a better person on the face of the planet? I mean, really! 🙂
part 2 ?
I don't know which puppy interview is more adorable, Tom Holland or Chris Evans.
This is the cutest interview ever. And now I need to see Stray Kids in an interview with puppies plss
Chris Evans is too busy, there's Puppies about.
The joy sweet joy of Chris Evans and the puppies and older dogs are irresistible I adopted an 8 year old shi tzu from Humane Society and she's truly an angel all my neighbors marvel at how she's the sweetest most loving dog they've ever met this was the perfect Chris Evans dog adoption PSA loved this
Too bad he's a Hollywood shrill, which became apparent when "Lightyear" flopped.  I'm done with Chris Evans!!
NOW i need Tom hardy
8:15 I wish I wish I was
no coherent answers available in this interview lol Chris fricking melted on the spot <3
CAN'T WAIT FOR STRAY KIDS WITH PUPPIES!!!
I luv how chris evans always seems high or something. Always having fun
Adam as Chris? I just died and went to heaven
And now lets invite Daniel Craig. PLEASE
And imagine one of us was hold and touched , instead of a dirty dog
Petition for red collar puppy to go home with Chris
Cutest interview
it's the part when he talked about "earning the trust of the older dogs" that got me. Love him!
This was so, so adorable! Chris Evans, my number one celebrity crush lol
This is basically porn for women and gay/bi men and should be labeled as such.
Ok,now sebastian stan please❤
Im one of them puppies.
Technically, he did play Loki for a few seconds.
they look like German Shepherd puppies ❤
Chris gritting his teeth with clenched fists because of how cute the puppies are is the universal reaction all of us would be making and how careful and sweey he is with the senior dogs is adorable. This video gave me joy! This is awesome. ❤
FINALLY!!! 😄
His handsome 🤩❤😍
🥺🥺🥺
8:16 me too babe
I can see him adopting every puppy and walking around with a billion leashes in hand.
my heart just melted 🥺
Release the uncut footage
cutest vid I've ever seen
I’m pretty sure he called like four dogs buster brown
A rare video of Chris Evans with his own species
Child murdering POS.
Ok, so I didn't think Chris Evans could get any hotter, sexier, nicer, sweeter...wrong!!!! Oh, and those GD adorable, incredibly lucky puppies.
You’re telling me that Chris didn’t adopt any of these puppies? WHO IS THIS IMPOSTER?! Lol, I adore this man.
All these puppies are now named Buster.
new goal in life: Chris Evans calling you "little trouble maker"
his accent came out big time...:-)
5:27 me watching this whole video
Now I want Sebastian Stan
I knew he was gonna say Downey, tht warmed my heart
♥️♥️♥️
I can bark
How many exactly do you watch this?  Me : YESSSSSSSSSSS
My dog Buster just passed away and hearing him call them buster and buster brown (which we called my dog) made me smile. I don’t know how anyone pays attention to the interviewer with the puppy’s crawling all over them! Haha
Now I’m a bigger fan!
So sad that this man has such hatred for people who don't have the same political beliefs as him.
What a Genius idea, oxitocin release like waterfalls!!! One of The happy hormones
I think he wld have to b begged to leave 😢
Hey Cap! How's your HUGE L going!?😂😂 Playing with Puppies while calling Fans and other Countries names because you can't handle a movie you star in Tanking, simply shows your Immature Ego. "America's @$$" my @$$. Stay Mad, you whiny child
At this point he doesn't even care about the interview.
"Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself." - Chris Evans  Apparently, the Thor aura is too strong even for Cap, lmao.
I knew he was going to say Downey Avengers for life ❤️
FINALLY!!!!!!
I DONT KNOW - WHAT IS THE QUESTION?
I love these interviews 😍 but I NEED one with Oliver Stark 🥲
just give us all the raw footage and b-rolls BuzzFeed
So, the best weapon against Captain America is to show him a bunch of puppies and he will melt like honey 😂
I wish I was one of those puppies so I can play with Chris Evans! 😍🥰😘
I think the question he wishes he'd get asked in interviews might be 'would you like us to bring you some puppies?'
This was the best puppy interview!!💖 Chris got a good voice? I haven’t heard it out of a movie before lol its so soothing <33
cheatin on dodger
Rest in pieces, loser.
ID DO ANYTHING TO SEE ELIZABETH OLSEN
PLEASE INVITE ELIZABETH OLSEN
My heart 😭😭😭😭
After 4 months They listen Tom Holland :D
😭😭😭💖💖💖
Este hombre es perfecto
SHEJJEBRNRJAKD I CANNOT
I could literally just watch a video of Chris playing with puppies and no interview and I'd still enjoy it.
It’s weird that when the senior dogs came in and he spoke about earning their trust, I really saw the captain America side of him.
I need Timothee Chalamet's version to do puppy interviews😀💘
Puppies Plays with Chris Evans
I wonder how Dodger reacted when Chris came home that night... "What's that I smell on your collar and beard...?? Have you been seeing other dogs?!?"
I don’t like that I continuously love this man. He’s more handsome, successful, and all sorts of other things than I am. It’s not fair that he’s kind and loves dogs like I do. I don’t know if I want to hate him, adopt him, or marry his ass. I hate this national treasure.
two most adorable creatures on earth in one screen😍 don't care about the questions, though I love how true his desc of his fellow avengers😂
Not me actually crying rn because I love this man 😭😭😭🥹🥹🥹💗💗💗
after watching The Boys, I am putting in my request for the next celebrity to be Karl Urban
My heart is full. Three of my favs all in one video🥰🥰😍😍💕💕💕💕
Okay, BUZZFEED. WE NEED THE ROCK TO PLAY WITH THE PUPPERS NOW!
Petition to Buzzfeed to release the entire uncut version of this video - WHO'S WITH ME???
i have never been more attracted to chris more than i am right now
Omg I love this
This is officially my favourite video on the internet
the puppy got so excited that they peed themselves, which is- let's face it, precisely what i'd do as well if i met chris evans
THERE SHOULD BE A PART 2 OF THIS!
No real eye contact!??
Genuinely I have no idea how he answered anything at all. I wouldn't have cared one bit and just let the doggies make a pile on my chest. Lol
So great he wanted to give some love to older dogs. It’s sad they don’t get adopted as much as puppies.
It can be a video longer than 24 hours and I won't complain 😭😭
LOVE that he calls every dog Buster or Pal... so cute
My gosh!!! It was so adorable seriously , so cute , the way he loves the dogs sm and thanks them for trusting him so pure do sweet
Can we please have Hayden Christensen on this???🙏
Meanwhile Dodger is waiting for Chris at home with a "welcome home cheater" banner.. like that meme 😂😂
This is the best video, and i love to chris evans, his reactions with the puppies, omg its very very sweet this video
"Guys, guys" 😍😍🤣
I really REALLY want Machine Gun Kelly to do this. Two innocent things in the world!
1:46
I think you just need the entire marvel cast for this. They are trouble whenever the get together. Just imagine what they'd be like being overrun by a wave of puppies.  Ruffalo and Holland wouldn't stand a chance trying to keep spoilers to themselves 😂
If you couldn’t love him even more he does this.
Clearly he is so distracted.  That's definitely the point of the interview
I need Miles Teller to play with puppies next, please! 😍
That dog at the end is very  very lucky one.
He should get another dog and name him BUSTER period.
Interviewer with questions Chris: who cares
Aí mds que homem perfeito 😍😍😍😍
8:03 ****** 8:15 *********************%% MMWMW 1:18 ***** 1:30 ******** 4:12 5:25 ******************
this is not him being distracted by the pups every 5 sec lmao
me in the cast/dogs coffee feeling too soft i have to men up myself again: 5:26
Chris while surrounded with dogs sounds drunk XD dogs make us all go crazy!
This man is the literal definition of aged like fine wine
oh but when i jump on top of chris evans and pee on the floor out of excitement , i get arrested
Every other dog: Buster  That one dog: Buster brown
I need to become a movie star so I can do a puppy interview. No other reason. Well... maybe hang with Chris Evans or Tom Holland or Jeff Goldblum... But mostly the puppies.
This is too cute 💕
We want zac Efron puppy playing edition please 😭😭🥺✨❤️
please do henry cavill next
What’s happening to me 🚶‍♀️🧎‍♀️🐕
the way he thanks the dog for trusting him I’m crying
This should be called “Chris Evans can’t answer a single question because puppies”
I think I just died and got rescued all over again. This video was so wholesome 💖
I can't believe I wished to became a puppy for that interview!!!!
Don’t tell Sox 🐱!
Chris is as adorable as the puppies are.❤️🥰
Ok we got chris Evans…. Now we need Sebastian Stan!!!!!
Older dogs are just as adorable, and the fact that he acknowledges that makes me respect him so much more
Muito simpático ele☺️☺️
Damn it puppies...when Chris 'f-ing' Evans lies down and says "Come here,".....YOU GO THERE!! Lucky puppies....     Ah who am I kidding........Lucky Chris! Look at those puppies 😍
I can watch him all day
1:49 I mean .........
I know identify as a puppy
🥹❤️
The fact that Chris did an interview with puppies really shows that he did an interview with puppies.
I’m still pissed that he called Muslims idiots for not wanting a few seconds of the buzz light year movie to be shown
i need him in my life 🥺
I cannot believe he didn’t take one of those dogs home 😄
This is the best puppy interview you guys have ever done. Period.
i want him to be the father of my kids.
Hair dye is strong with this one!
I don't know who this celebrity is but OMG how much do I love him now. OBSESSED especially with the older dogs. LOVE
Chris is in puppy heaven- he's like "who cares" not even answering the question 😆
Anoter day of not being one of those puppies kissiing his face
Anyone else having sudden flashbacks to a certain insta story with a specific need of getting lovingly yet smashingly pregnant by his cute face? Not me😶
I’d love to play with him just like he’s playing with those pups 🫣🤭🫠
We need a puppy interview with Henry Cavill
The HOLD that this man has on me and has had on me for the past 10+ years, is not going to let up anytime soon and I don’t mind it AT ALL!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Chris Evans being high on puppies is my favorite Chris ♥️
How to become a puppy
Just when I thought I couldn’t fall more in love with him…I see this. 😍🥹🥰
Chris matching the energy and the puppies and older dogs gives me life
Hey buster, hey pal
He just became more attractive, if that was even possible.
I guess Tom was right about Chris liking the puppies 😭😭😭
he's got the kris kringle laugh and it makes me so happy!
Me watching this ♥️👄♥️
his endless cute aggression for the pups gives me cute aggression for HIM omfg
THAT MAN IS EVERYTHING TO ME, I JUST CAN´T. HE´S SO ADORABLE.  Btw, do Heartstopper cast play with puppies PLEASE. Thanks.
the moment we've all been waiting for...
8 minutes are NOT enough. We need the extended uncut version please!!!!! 😭
omg chris papi i can bark too
Te amo, Chris
Te amo, Chris
8:26
Where’s timothee chalamet playing with kittens is all I’m saying 🤷🏼‍♀️
OMG  hate dogs but Chrs Evans is a hunk
If I were one of those puppies, I’d know where to lick and to sniff.
Chris Evans and puppies, are you trying to make me explode?
BuzzFeed listened to us. 🙌 This is all we've ever wanted.
OMG he calls dogs "bubby" too?!?
Chris Evans needs another dog probably soon
have i, i dunno
hi buster, hi pal
Way to ruin Disney, soy boy.
his face when he asked if they'd coming running in . omg my heart
Can't decide who is cuter.  Chris or the puppies! Perfect dilemma. 👻
you guys HAVE to do this with the cast of Heartstopper asap
Now for the next interview , bring us Henry cavill.
The puppy factor was ADORABLE but these are such good questions too!! I wish he’d answered them 🤣🤣
Chris: I love puppies!  Interview: These dogs are from the middle ea-  Chris: Ew, Idiots!
I can't stop smiling!
Did they count all the puppies after Chris left haha 🤣
Dogs are the best judges of character and I see no surprises here.
Anybody else crying and laughing at the same time? 🤗
ive never wanted to be a dog so bad in my life.
Literally THE BEST interview ever
He's sooo adorable❤️
They're so cute... R.I.P to your Iphone 6 Chris, my deepest sympathy
am i watching this interview again? for the fiftieth time? and crying all over again because it is so sweet? yes. i am.
my life is officially complete
America you are very good at tricking american kids with your movies, even though you failed to protect american children, children are mass shooting in their schools, shootings in public places, supermarkets, hospitals, america you failed to protect citizens and you are just great In making a fake character, you failed to protect American children and you don't deserve to be called a captain
Currently googling how to become a puppy so I can have Chris talking to me like that
cute puppy bro
hes so sweet im crying
I love how the video is just called "Chris Evans plays with puppies" instead of ..."while answering questions"... coz he didn’t 😂
Looks like Dodger's about to get a sibling. Or 20, haha
A TODOS LOS LLAMABA BUSTER JAJAJAJAJAJA
I dont know what is cuter the puppies or chris evans
Rdj really live rent free in his mind woah
Chris calling the dogs Buster Brown is the most Massachusetts thing I’ve seen this week oh my god
Woah he kind of has a northern accent 😯
Chris' laugh is so contagious, and he 's so gentle and sweet with the doggos 🥺
When did you tube allow porno so.explicit??
I could not contain the amount of serotonin this gave me. I thought it was enough watching him with the puppies but the way he purposefully interacted with the older dogs I COULD NOT HANDLE IT. If he winds up getting married to someone they are one of the luckiest people on earth!
ppl still watch buzzfeed??
This is genuinely still too much. One week since and i’m still coming back. Will never get over this🥺
Worst interview on paper, but the BEST visually.
I live how they don't call it an interview cuz they know Chris won't actually answer anything 😂
Now do one w Sebastian stan!!!
Interview??? Where ?? That's just 8 min of Chris Evans laughing 🤭
The purest laught when with puppies. Everyone is a better person wih puppies.
All of y'all all are so sexually spiritually lovingly obsessed over him am here thinking about how can I become his wife  Ps. If he didn't have a dog 🐕 he would totally still be in love 😂😭
Interviews are for entertainment. If that means it gets derailed by entertaining dogs, that is a win.
He probably went home with every dog there. So Captain America saved the day again? Lol🤣
Captain Gaymerica
awwwwww我心都融化了🥺
Chris was 100% in heaven during this entire interview😂❤
His sexy meter has just shot off the charts 💞💞😍🐕😍💞💞
his laugh is so fantastic
i dont even care about the answers im only here to see chris evans playing with puppies. The day is already better.
lol I think he kinda forgot it was an interview and just enjoyed playing with the dogs. I love that he barely answered the questions about his career and the movie he was supposed to be promoting, but when asked about his own dog he gave a sweet and thorough answer. Also, I was almost sure he would end up adopting a little brother/sister for Dodger, I'm kinda sad that he didn't.
Oh my god I love himmmm 💙❤️
yeah. I love him.
Is it ok to cry with this video?🥺😍🥺
his joy is so infectious
i can die in peace now 😀😭
진짜 개판이넼ㅋㅋㅋㅋ귀여워 죽겠드ㅏㅡㅏㅏㅏ
What makes a man sexier? Seeing him play with puppies.
Caballeros,Damas; hoy acabo de conocer la envidia en unos perritos:(
Please Clone this man and give one of him to EVERYONE.
do you think they know they’re being petted by THE christopher robert evans??
I would do anything right now to be one of those puppies.
Ayuda se me cae la cuca
now, i want to be a puppy.
you got a scratch pal? come over here lemme get it for ya <3
8:28 😩😩😩😩
8:28 😩😩😩😩😩
the dog pee after seeing chris evans is so relatable
Seeing him with the older dogs was so sweet. So gentile.
The question he should be asked is how many puppies do you want in this interview, hehe.
god i wish chris to play a dog's journey role 😭
i smiled the whole interview just for seeing chris with the dogs... i don´t know that wore the questions tho
Chris: Come here  My submissive ass screaming in the background*
I wonder why they posted this, maybe because of the negative backlash from his constantly terrible personality. It's funny that this is all it takes for so many people
I mean if you didn't already love Chris Evans you totally love him now!!!
the way his boston accent comes out is so correct to me
Tierno más que tierno 😘
i’ve never wanted to be a dog so badly
Otro pseudo actor degenerado,de seguro también le deben gustar los niños cierto?no veré más tus porquerías de películas.
I'm going to watch this interview everytime I need a something that makes me feel happy.
A human puppy playing puppy puppies. Makes sense. I love this!
He’s like, “love drunk” off these puppies😩😍
This wasnt long enough..lol
This man is so wholesome
Thank you for including adult dogs as well! 💞🐾💞
Omg this man is precious 😄 . I would also not be able to answer questions when there are SO MANY PUPPIES omg i would cry over so many cute dogs ugh . He also has a super nice laugh:D
Why would yall post this ? Do you want me to explode 😭❤❤
I don‘t want to start a new hype here, but.. don‘t you all agree that Andrew Garfield would be adorable in a puppy interview
I love how much his voice changes when the puppies are around. It's soft and sweet like he's giving the puppies the answers. Adorable!
I want to be one of the puppies🤣
can you please invite tom hiddleston?
He wants to lie down and be covered in puppies- you can tell
I LOVE HIM MORE THAN YESTERDAY
Everything about this was just magic 🤩❤️
every dog is now named Buster Brown or Bubba. we don't make the rules. Chris does.
The way he calls every dog buster tho!!!❤️❤️❤️
single handedly the most unproductive interview he's ever had
This is one Beautiful ❤️💗💗 💗❤️ Post
Well, I can die happy. I just heard Chris Evan say "Hi baby." I mean, it wasn't directed at me, but still...! (Half serious. I'm particular about dating and don't date just anyone.)  A bit disappointed he's a jewelry guy. (I'm detail-oriented, so I saw that gold chain.) At least he's a dog person.  And real talk, I know he's not A-list, but Taylor Kitsch needs to do this. Him or Nick Bateman, they're my hot guy list right now since Brett Dalton isn't doing anything atm. Oh, and Theo James I guess, but he's married. Would still be cute. (Hope he's a dog person.)
The dog sniffing his crotch tho
Ryan Gosling and Paul Rudd in the Evans Bros Biopic
Are they all Buster or is there one Buster? If so, did he adopt Buster? When will we get The Adventures of Dodger and Buster?
oh my gosh i think i can live with just this video. chris is just freakin adorable 😔
Aww the puppies are fighting over him like the rest of us. 😂😍
HE SAID HI BOO BOO IM NOT OKAY RN
IVE WAITED TO LONG FOR THIS 🔥🔥🔥
He would make an amazing dad if he isn't one already.
BRB, changing my name to "Buster"
*hez so pure i cry 😭😭*
I've never seen a man this giddy in a long time. Glorious.
I love how he calls them all Buster. Female, male, old, puppy, no matter, they're all Buster.
Wow I really needed this
Honestly for someone who plays such serious roles he is so sweet and gentle it's amazing
The puppy part absolutely MELTED me, but seeing his love and advocacy for older dogs made me cry. My family has always had dogs, and as they got older I always took care of them up until the moment they crossed that rainbow bridge. It’s really hard, but it’s so worth it.   I’ve had to say goodbye to a lot of dogs since I was a child, and while it never gets easier, there’s nothing I’d love more than a chance to take care of all the shelter dogs in the world. It breaks my heart to see someone abandon such an innocent creature.   Chris is right, gaining an animals trust is amazing. To me it’s a stronger feeling of worth than being able to wield Mjolnir.
Holy Moly that's cute Doggy content ⚠️ alert
This might be the best video ever 🤗
How to be a puppy 🥺
He is naturally crazy in a good way. Goofy, that's why I like him.
awwe i love the way he smieles when he sees puppies
WHO IS BUSTER BROWN
Why did I click this and why don't I regret it?
I love him
Just names all the dogs buster
we need louis tomlinson with puppies!!!!!!!
Can I get a...uuuuhhh... interview with Tom Holland and Chris Evans with puppies next? Thanks!!
Best incentive EVER: we have puppies.
How could this man be so perfect? 😍😍😍😍😍😍
dodger when chris got home: WELCOME HOME CHEATER
i'm a puddle on the floor because i just melted
ซื้อต่อหมาค่ะ
I NEED A F%CKDSB CHRIS EVANS IN MY LIFE
The most precious human ever, combined with the most precious animals ever = magical combo
2:16 I'm literally melting...
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE SKZ WITH PUPPIES
Nuestro Golden retriver jugando con cachorros es demasiado hermoso de ver🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 amo la paciencia y dulzura con que esperó a los perros adultos .... ellos vivieron cosas que tal vez hagan dudar de los humanos pero tienen un hermoso corazón que espera dar amor también 💖💖💖💖 no compres, adopta💖💖💖
Bro… this is so damn ADORABLE. 😭
How he showed love for those dogs says a lot about the type of guy he is. One with a big heart. Best interview ever! 😊😊
Looks like he could do this all day i would watch that
Wish I was a puppy
It happend, FINALLY!  😂😂
Interviewer - asks the question Cris - half way answering the question✨hi bustard,hey pal,hii,look at this boy ✨  Cris -what was the question 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
this boost of serotonin is just free therapy-
brb rewatching this for the millionth time
Chris Evans: What should I pick~ What should I pick~ Me: 🥺🐶🥺🐶🥺🐶🥺🐶
Chris Evans entering the interview.  Me : Disguising myself as one of the puppies so that i could be on his lap, chest and all over Chris.😋😋✌
can we pleeaase have Harry Styles with kittens? 🥺🥺🥺
this is the best thing i've ever seen 🥺😭😭
loooove how you just got the as importent message of adopt older dog in. thank you for that.
This interview was so sweet. I have tooth decay. The way he interacted and talked about the older dogs 🐕 melts my heart. I love his compassion 😢❤
I’m surprised he didn’t adopt one of the puppies. They all loved him.
Sooo cuteee!!   Oh and the puppies too 🥰
I mean Kaley Cuoco in Jimmy Fallon was great (Pup Quiz), but that is a whole new level of adorable
This is the best video that will ever exist ever. No need for any more videos to be made.
how is he single 🥲
Seriously!!!  Puppies and Chris Evans!!!!  Two of the most awesome sights in the world........Nice job BuzzFeed!  Let's work on getting puppies and Shohei Otani for the next installment.
he is legit calling all of these dogs "Buster" and it is so precious
Chris's laugh is the best thing ever! And yeah! Duh! Who cares! Puppies! Chris is one of the nicest guy to ever walk this planet. My heart ❤️
It was even better than I ever could’ve dreamed when we were begging for this damn interview to happen 😂😂
I don’t have any puppies, but he can play with my kitty. 😏
Please have Sam Heughan do a puppy interview next 🙏
"No disrespect to the puppies" This man
I could watch this all day. We need a part 2, haha.
Can i be the dog?🤭
i wound up here by accident and i'm so glad that i did!
Does anyone had no situation with Evans called Scarlett Johansson HIS GIRL?! Buddy, Evansons, romanogers, whatever, we have a situation here. Anybody kinda need to discuss? 🤣🤣
Chris saying "thanks for trusting me" so much gives me hope that humanity isn't ALL bad yet.
You can tell he’s completely over the famous thing
I have waited for this for this and something in me just knew he wasn’t gonna answer any questions 😂
He already played Loki😂
intence laughing
Oh my ovaries.
He’s a lot more attractive - imo - than his brother. Notice I said “attractive” instead of “good-looking”. Can be, but not necessarily the same thing.
Chris is so sweet with the puppies and the senior dogs🥹
let's build some trust♡♡♡;_;
I am so glad Chris mentioned older dogs. They have so much love to offer. I hope more people adopt older and senior dogs. My next dog will be a senior dog, and don't forget senior cats and other hard to adopt lovely critters. Thank you for brining this to the forefront. 🐾🐾💙
4:04 Evansson ❤️❤️❤️
Chris playing with puppies: "You're so cute. Too bad your kind doesn't support gay people kissing. You will all die off like the dinosaurs and no one will mourn you."
Chris Evans playing with puppies? All I see is a big puppy with smaller puppies
🥰❤️❤️❤️
Adult dogs are the best to adopt! We adopted a Jack Russell estimated to be between 6 & 7 years old. We sadly had to put him down a couple weeks ago on my birthday because he was losing his battle with kidney disease. We had him for almost 9 years! He was between 15 and 16 years old and I'm so glad we adopted him
the fact that even bang chan fanboyed over chris evans 😭
CHRIS EVANS IS LITERALLY A PUPPY
"i'm about to go home with all these props" sent me
As a interview: worst video As a video: 😍😍😍😍😍😍
I want to be those puppies 😅
His Boston accent getting stronger the longer this interview goes really adds to the purity of his utter joy~
FINALLY.
Has anyone (celeb) walked out with a puppy?.... I would probably adopt the seniors too. Give them a little home for the rest of their life
Cris Evans 🤝 Tom Holland
I don't know who is luckier, Chris Evans or the puppies
I want to see the whole unedited version of this!
Oohh I need to see Harry styles on this asap
I would be leaving with a whole pack of doggies.  Old and young.
I come back to this video every time I’m having a bad day
Why did I start tearing up? So sweet how he talked about the older dogs
This man can’t even answer the questions he’s that immersed with those puppies adorable
He is a total loser
I like how he asks the puppies opinion XD
the best buzzfeed content.....😭😅💯
this is probably the most relatable and realistic puppy interview I've ever seen
CALL SEBASTIAN STAN !!!
They’re all “buster” lol.
This video can cure diseases
Chris Evans: *sees dog* Chris Evans: "Hi buster"
Those puppies are so lucky
a cada 5segs o Chris: hi guys 😍🥰❣️
I am surprised none of them adopt atleast one pupper. Older dog or younger. Their love is so pure ❣️
I just love 💕 he’s adorable person big heart ❤️
The fact that almost every dog trusted him within a few minutes says everything. Dogs instinctively know who good humans are. And Chris is a good human.
I know it's only been a few days but I hope all of those fur babies are already with their new families. You are an inspiration Chris Evan's. Very few actors of your status take the time to encourage us all to adopt and not shop for our fur babies. Thank you!
Okaayyy now i need Henry Cavill and i'm set for life I can die happy 🥹😭
OK NOW GET HIM TO DO THE THIRST TWEETS
He just feels the rightest person for this interview!!!
He did an interview laying down 😂 love it
Oh my goodness. This is so darn sweet. My heart can’t handle it. I’ve heard Evans is a cool person. This video definitely makes me a fan.
He has the cuteness aggression. 😂 something is so cute and you love it so much you wanna crush it in a hug
Omfg, he's literally me.  WHO CARES?! PUPPIEEEEES!!!!!
Scarlet's my girl 😁
Lol he couldnt care less abt the interview when playing with the puppies thats very cute
hes the friendliest gemini ive ever seen <3
Chris definitely just came for the dogs, only for the dogs! Literally so sweet 🐶🤩
sunshine in human form
I just really wish he would've said "I could do this all day" just so we could freak out with the reference!!
"Whats one question you want to be asked in interviews and what would be your answer?" Obviously the question is "Would you like to play with puppies" and the answer is "yes"
The puppies didn’t get to meet Chris Evans, Chris Evans got to meet the puppies 😂
Guard that puppy
i would trust him with my drink in a club for sure
You know you can also upload "puppy videos only" and we are going to watch the whole thing
1:17 it was supposed to be a cute moment but sweetie you can't just you know fall on that one side and whisper come here and expect me not to be all giddy and fighting those butterflies in my stomach oh my gosh
I think Chris Evans is the only man I trust 😂😂😂
he would be an awesome dad!
I love hearing his Boston accent!! Glad to know he's from where I'm from lol
Sebastian Stan next, thanks!
I love how every dog is buster to Chris, this is the best interview on YT rn, second is the WIRED one with Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal
I am Buster, buster is me. I would also not be able to keep my hands off of Chris 😍
We need a part 2
Best 8 minutes Ives seen on YouTube… just Imagine adopting a puppy Chris Evans played with… A DREAM.
Does anyone want to say that Chris Evans looks like Doctor Mike?
There was no dog to adopt after this. They all live with Chris Evans now
I love that he answers in puppy voice😍
This is the most amazing video!! Chris lost his mind over those puppies but the way he treats the older dogs and talks about dodger melted my heart ❤️
Never have I ever wanted to be a puppy before this.
this is so cuteeee
Showed this video to a Chris Evans skeptic and NOW they get it 🥰
the white old dog has the cutest eyes omg 🥺
I love his laugh lmao
Has there ever existed a hotter dude?
i need ana de armas doing this PLEASE
✨💅 who 💅✨ cares 💅✨
I know one of these dogs went home with him.
Give us the uncut version, Buzzfeed. Or at least a 30 minute long one haha
Love that his mind went blank and turned 5 playing with puppies.
Com' on whose thinking while watching this video? "Gosh I wanna be one of those puppies"😅🤣
i heard about this from bang chan...
His WHO CARES 😂😍
So we going to do thirst tweets next?
8 minutes? Felt like 1 minute
I like how he clarifies “no disrespect to the puppies”
I thought the dog was named buster until I realized he was calling every dog buster 😭😂
This is me every time I see a puppy 🐶
O que podemos fazer pôr esses pequenos tudo nós podemos sofrer eles não.H Maria.
I think We need the uncut version of this interview!!!! 😍♥️
I knw the answer to the which avenger qs.. it's olsen obviously.
im naming my dog buster brown
Honey, did you bring home any of the puppies? 😅
im picturing my self as one of those puppies
I absolutely love him
Huge grin on my face watching this, thank you. That's made my morning. 😅
Animals and kids tell the truth about people. This guy must have a good soul 🥰
This was so freaking cute 🥰 now we need to get Chris brown on here
Puppy with the red collar definitely chose Chris
"Come get it" Laaawwwdddd
PART 2! PART 2! PART 2!
Thanks for trusting me bubba🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
I was drooling the ENTIRE time! 🤤🤭😍
HE IS SO PURE WE DON'T DESERVE HIM
did he say Garlic instead of Scarlett 💀
Stahppp dis....
finally!!!!!!!
He was literally playing with them. And I love it...
“Got a scratch pal, come here let me get it I gotcha” 😩😭😭😭🥹
“Got a scratch pal, come here let me get it I gotcha” 😩😭😭😭🥹
“Got a scratch pal, come here let me get it I gotcha” 😩😭😭😭🥹
“Got a scratch pal, come here let me get it I gotcha” 😩😭😭😭🥹
“Got a scratch pal, come here let me get it I gotcha” 😩😭😭😭🥹
Trust doggies Always! Clearly Chris Evans is amazing person with amazing vibes. I mean not that we didn’t know…but the puppies solidified it lol
i will never forgive harry styles for turning down this interview
im sobbing hes adorable
I love how other interviews seem to be mostly them answering the questions while playing with the puppies as a secondary thought but Chris was just here for the puppies and couldn't care less about the interview
Gak kerasa kalo ini 8 menit... Kirain baru 2 menitan... 😂 Manis banget sih Mamas Chris yaaa Looord... 😍 Terima kasih udah membisikan pesan untuk sayang sama anjing yang senior juga! ❤️
“I’m about to go home with all THESE props” 🤣🥹
1:49 the cute aggression is kicking his ass 😭😭😭
No one : Chris : HIII BUSTERRRR!!!!!
as someone who adopted a senior dog a few years back, they really are the best, and i love chris even more for bringing awareness to it :(( not long ago he had to be put down because he was sick and there wasnt much they could do and because i live in korea now and he's with my mom and lil sis back in florida, they did it without me there ;__; rip milo, my sweet baby angel
wow guys it’s chris evans 🤷🏽‍♀️
I love his cuteness aggression
Oh to be a puppy playing with Chris Evans
Omg my heart is about to burst into a million hearts 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
This mans laugh is CONTAGIOUS haha.
the kind of content i want! WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR AGES!!!!
Chris calling every single dog “Buster” singlehandedly cured my depression
My dream job, playing with puppies, every day.
Soo cute 🤩😍
someone: “how many times have you watched this?”  me: “yes”
the cris Evans laughs is one of the best ❤❤❤❤
A giant puppy with smol puppies
his laugh is infectious
This is a problem, this is impossible 😆. He's still doing better than I would've.
he's like puppy drunk
I think i just died.
I can be a dog. I can bark. Arf arf arf arf HAHAHAH
him calling Scarlett his girl was my favourite thing
I wish Scarlett Johansson could play with puppies!
Do the dogs know that the people are famous? Like, did the dogs go “oh my god it’s Chris Evans” or did they just go “oh my god it’s a friend”
this is the calmest chaos ive ever seen
Even puppies can’t stop licking Chris 😘.
my heart
Don't buy your dogs from a breeder ..please! There are so many dogs and cats  of every breed that are in need of adoption in shelters everywhere.
Chris Evan just called vast majority of non-white Muslim as Idiots. Did you know vast majority of muslim disagree with homosexuality and including homosexuality element on a movie intended for minors.   #whitesupremacy
He should had bring Home the red collar Puppy!
I am dying of cuteness 🥹🥹
Get Taika Omg
would've loved to see a kitten interview with Chris
Quisiera ser ese perros 😏🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🔥😂🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lucky puppy!  How many of us would like to be there right now?  He is really a terrific actor.  The puppies were totally amazing.
BUBBBYY 😭
"Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself"   Yeah same oof
This was so cute!! Can’t wait to see SKZ on here too playing with the puppies.
This is a sign that he and Selena Gomez need to meet up!! She loves dogs and rescuing! He clearly is a dog person. We need a Chris Evans and Selena Gomez film! Like come on producers, directors any where. Like a movie or Rom Com about them saving and rescuing dogs?? like a million times yes!
Hes got a big d!ck and a soft heart??!! That's a complete package over there. Loved himmmm❤️
This should have been kittens!!!   *Justice for Sox*
Is it that time of the month or is anyone else crying? The puppies were so cute and the senior doggies being so wary, I WANNA HUG AND PET THEM ALL SO BAD, and then there's a hunk shaped cinnamon roll in the middle of them, ugh
Heres what i dont get if i had their money i would adopt all of them
that last puppy… I get you buddy, I really do
Please bring one cat for leeknow during the stray kids interview. Thank u
I love his laugh 😍😍😍
who cares. he literally called people idiots for not sharing his views. rude jerk. #timallen4cap
He sounds like he's from a dentist op and the anaesthesia hasn't worn off completely!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 So cute!!!
I love how they just got rid of “answering questions” bc he didn’t answer
K. Imagine both him and Chris Hemsworth doing this interview. Nothing would get done.
YAY FINALLY
the subtitles: (chris laughing hysterically)
Questions: *exist*  Chris: "Nothing matters, ONLY PUPPIES".
this is everything i could ever want or need
I suddenly just want to be a puppy rn.
I gave this a thumbs-up before I even watched it
Omg puppies and my love C. Evans... is too much..
I'm in tears at how sweet Chris was with the senior dogs 😭♥️
Omg the EXCITEMENT is written all over his face. He was soooooo ready for this interview!!
Why aren't all interviews puppy interviews? The world would be better for it!
Count the puppies. Chris definitely tried to take a few of them.
Another reason to adore Chris Evans
Who didn't want to be the puppies in this video?
The person who thought of this deserves so much credit 👏
This is the cutest thing ever
His smile is literally contagious
Legend says that Chris is still there to this day. Lol. I'm still waiting to hear that Dodger got a new sibling. <3
Chris’ dog might be the luckiest dog in the whole world because look at that raw love for all those dogs really amazing
this just affirms my deep love for this mannnnnnn!
I learned nothing about Chris Evans during this interview and I'm perfectly fine with that.
Christopher Jamaal Evens is that you?
Harry Styles NEXT PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
6:30 "Let's build some trust." <3
Puppy pees on the floor upon seeing Chris Evans IRL.  Me: Same, puppy. Same.
I've missed that laugh so much!!!🥰😍😍😍😍
This is sooo cute! But remember folks, don't shop, adopt!
Chris playing with dogs makes him 100x more attractive
Hey Buster , Hey Pal 🐶 🐕 🤌🤩❤️
I wish this were longer I honestly would watch a 24 hour (or longer) version of this
Deserves more views.
Highlight of the video: HI!!! HI GUYS!!! HI PAL!!!!!
I missed all the questions because I couldn't stop watching Chris and the puppies 🤣🤣🥰
His puppy voice is adorable what the heck
Finally.
That’s it. I can die happy now.
😂🥺
Did anyone capture any of the questions or answers? I mean literally who cares about them when such adorable interaction is seen!
Chris! We're filming you.
Te amo
❤️
Guys we need more videos like this... you can cure depression...pls believe me!
Evans clearly gives no shits about the interview.  Just there for the puppies.
OMG. This is dream come true
Sorry, was he ever saying words? Couldn't hear over my sobbing
I'll take two please!
This was THE SWEETEST INTERVIEW IN THE WORLD!!
The man said return of the Mack 😭🥹
This was an adorable interview
Glad I grew up with Tim Allen you were the best.
just sent this to my mom she’s gonna lose her shit
me sneaking into the buzzfeed hq in a dog fursuit to try and crawl all over chris evans
Shout-out to the Chris's (Evans and Hemsworth) for their new movies! Buzz light year and Thor LaT, so excited!!🍓❤️
Okay buzzfeed thank you but but *SEBASTIAN STAN I'M BEGGING YOU* and a long one too because I'll watch the shit out of that one _and_ send it to everyone ik
I've never wanted to be a puppy more in my life
Ok, Chris, which puppy/puppies did you take home with ??
Cuteness mixed with cuteness!!!
The way he says “Hi, I’m Chris Evans” sounds sexier than it should…
Does he make his voice deeper for cap America
То что нужно в перерыве между экзаменами
now you should do Chris Evans reads thirst tweets
I would LOVE to see Oscar Isaac do a puppy interview at some point!
This is free therapy.
How much his demeanor changed to respect the older dogs just tugged at my heart strings 😭😍 What a guy
this is the greatest video on the internet
Nobody: Chris: "HI!!🥺"
1:06 Best answer ever 😂❤
this has got to be one of the cutest things I’ve ever seen in my life!!
chris sees any dog ever: buster
That one dog at the end was truly living my dreams
so Chris, Tom & puppies when - no interview needed just for the cute wholesome content
The amount of money I would pay to be in that room is beyond my bank account, but it's okay it's worth the debt. Anything for Chris Evans.
How have I lived 19 years of my life without seeing Chris Evans in a room full of puppies?
Next we need heartstopper cast
AWWW. Also wen is SKZ puppy interview
Lol he calls all of them buster
Oh no... 🧍🧎🙇 🐕
It smells like an industrial fish market around here...
THANK YOU BUZZFEED FOR CONSIDERING OUR SUGGESTIONS XD
He's the sweetest person ever
Ghay!!!
Este video es asmr visual puro
2:19  Chris: come get it  Me : GOT7  Just K-pop stan things !
Aww Adorable!!!  My heart hoping he adopted the black/brown one they had an amazing connection ❤️🥺
🤤
Chris....is...the...FREAKING BEST!
My two fav thinks Chris evans and puppy’s😍
My ovaries and heart weren’t ready for this 😍😭
Chris evans is a really good guy he's not shallow at all you can tell he cares about all animals. And he's bringing attention to older dogs so that people will think more about adopting them. ❤
It's cute
8:15 The way he just let the puppy sniff him before he said "Excuse you!" He makes you love the dogs.  Edit: Thanks for the likes btw!
This is the purest interview! 🥺🥺
So, is it possible that just a normal, regular, non-celebrity can do one of these “puppy interviews”? Asking for a friend.
I adopted my dog when she was 9 years old, she was abandoned, it was The best decision of my life. Thanks for The message in this video!
We need a part 2 asap!!!
Meh...This idea as a thought was much better...Expectation killed this video! So far Jake Gyllenhaal and Keanu Reeves are the best ones!
Are you trying to kill me with this
The dogs: well behaved  My dog: will bark at chris evans and piss in excitement will bite off his finger and sleep directly
His laughter 🥹
How many times I’ve watched this video?? Yes
I'm telling you Chris took one of those dogs home after that😂
*woof* *woof* what??...😳
That's just too adorable. Could watch it all day. Makes you feel like we're all doing okay. 🥰
Awwwwww........ Most awaited one
the loveliest man in the universe
i'm so happy right now
A new way to fail a sobriety test🤣
When he speaks about the older dogs and how we have to "earn their trust,"  it is so touching and beautiful...
Such a dog dad!!! He understands them.
This dudes career just took a hit.   Dinosaurs.  Keep advocate the sexualisation of children Evans.  You disgusting freak
Chris Evans and Puppies!!! ❤ two things you can't get enough of
Literally couldn’t love him more… ❤️😍❤️
It’s the way he isn’t able to answer in one go cuz he keeps getting distracted by the puppies, I just know I’d be the same
Try this with kittens!!
That went...pretty much how I thought it would go. Love ya, Chris Evans!
What happens when the puppies grow up
Did you at least give him one puppy to take home with him?
My baby is playing with puppies. I love you, Chris.
I am in LOVE with this man
idk what’s more cute Chris or the puppies
I love how short his attention span is when it comes to being distracted by doggos😂❤️❤️❤️❤️ Like he a professional actor who has big scale interviews with loads of noise on the red carpet and stuff but just can't hold it together to not get distracted by dogs ❤️
this is the best interview of my life  too.  Chris is such a puppy himself aaaaaaaaaaaa
For half off the video , he didn't even look up to answer questions 😂😂😂😂
Please please please please Invite Adam driver to the Puppy interview 😭💕
He's so sweet
He wanted to be an ANIMATOR?!! I fell more in love because it's the major ill be majoring in.
so i love Chris Evans and Marvel in general but I have to admit..... I am here because of Bang Chan from Stray Kids
I KNEW HE WOULD CHOOSE LOKI
hahahhahahaha this is so good to see
Ugh, can you make me love him any more?
someone pls tell me they came here bc they love chris evans but also bc of bangchan
oh Chris. marry me and we will live happily ever after with lots of doggy😛
No one can wipe the smile off my face right now….and Chris too 😂
About DAMN time 😂
i wish i was the puppy at 8:15 xD luckyyy dog lol <3
I wish Chris Evans would talk to me like that 😭
I just witnessed Captain America get vanquished by puppies.
Well I see a lot of cute little doggies there. So like!
This is the best interview I've ever seen ...ohhh MY GOD!!! How can someone be sooooo handsome
This is the best video ever 🤗
are they all called Buster Brown or like what is going on? LMAO
"Chris Evans playing with puppies while we distract him with questions"
I don’t know what to feel. Do I feel jealous of him surrounded by puppies? Do I feel jealous of the dogs all over him? I’m jealous of those dogs. Do I wanna marry him? Do I wanna jump him? (I say both) Do I cry over the Scarlett answers? It’s too much
my cheeks hurt from smiling
this is what the world needs more of <3
My legs are shaking , i am a puddle on the floor, and the best part is no one can stop me
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Who's here after watching Chan's room 😆
I want MORE OMAYGASH
Dudeee I love this mannnmm
Who want to see Chris plays with his own big fat PUPPY?
A golden retriever playing with puppies and dogs hell yeah
I can watch him play with puppies for hours🤗
Chris, you know how you get your paychecks right? Remember that next time you open your mouth!  You and Ruffulo are massive POS’s. Bu by Disney
Boring.
i absolutely love watching him play with puppies. its the cutest thing to ever exist. oml.
The amount of simpletons here who swoon over an obvious degenerate demonrat is disgusting🤮 Get a life, then get a clue, you're simping for people who wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire.
This is a cuteness aggression psa
Yayy!!
How this man isn't married I will never understand. What a wonderful human being 😍
Who cares about him when the puppies are so cute 🥰
There’s one puppy with the blue collar reminds me of scooby Doo . And ik it’s hard answered some of these questions if you have puppies in your face 🤣🤣🤣
His laugh is absolute seratonin pls
I’m obsessed with him oh my god
i wish i was here too❤❤ love evans
🤣🤣🤣 so cute. I love it! 😍😍😍
Christopher Jamal Evans ❤️
Love the puppies love Chris Evans ❤️ 😍
this is like best thing i’ve ever watched
he’s so cute
best interview ever.
i love him sm
What a great intetview.
This idiot, y’all support him and he went and said anyone who didn’t like the new buzz movie was an idiot for not accepting the same sex kiss IN A FUCKING KIDS MOVIE. Y’all are the damn reason why this country is going to shit. People care more for him playing with puppies than what he’s influencing on kids. Ridiculous
Move pups, it's my turn
Perritos y Chris Evans, la mejor combinación🤌🏽🤌🏽😮‍💨😮‍💨
99% playing with the puppies and 1% answering the questions lol yes mom this is the guy who steals my heart
HA! He almost couldn't handle it!!!
Excuse me for being inappropriate.... but I have never wanted to be a puppy more in my life.
im sorry but if chris told me to come get it lol😂
Terry Crews needs to do a puppy interview! I feel like he'd have a lot of fun with it and have interesting answers (if he can manage around cuddling puppies).
I think I am pregnant.
This is a happy man if i ever saw one
If any interview deserves a full, unedited version it's this.
He is having an puppygasam..
WE FINALLY GOT IT!!! I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS😭😭
Fuuuuuuuuu… just when you think you can’t love him even more ❤️
He's so gemini my beautiful soft man
I love how all the dogs are Buster or  Bubba 😂❤
OH MY GAWD! I love this man!!! Oh the puppers are so adorable!!! Yay! 😆❤❤❤❤❤
He kinda reminds me of Tom hanks
permanent series with Chris Evans please
Apparently their all named Buster
The amount of questions answered is similar to the amount of questions him and Hemsworth answer when they do interviews together… jk, this one has more answers.
Omg I can’t🥺❤️
I need a pt. 2 tomorrow and a pt. 3 next week.
Awwwww my heart I can’t 🥺
I get easily distracted when it comes to 🐶
We need Joe Locke and Kit Connor to get an interview with puppies.
He's so sweet 😍
chris evans putting his full focus on the puppies…  person who made up the questions: am i a joke to you?
LOVE this. Part 2, please. I'm really hearing his Boston accent in his pet voice - anyone else notice this?
Chris being so fond and kind to these puppies, it's just feels warm. ❤️
3:52 such a random but good song😝
I know this is off topic but, ain’t we gonna talk about how he hasn’t aged anything since 2012?! He ages like fine wine
Hands down to the most wholesome puppy interview! Love Chris for shouting out puppies and older dogs for adoption! and the way Chris got so absorbed into those puppies is!!!
How on earth did it take this long for this man to get a puppy interview
YESS FINALLY
aw super cute
puppy: *breath chris: *died 🤣  i cant stop smiling for 8 minutes 44 seconds, it should have been longer 😍
Chris es un ser precioso y se ve que su energía es linda cuando aun los perritos mayores confían en el. solo una muestra mas de que Dios creo al hombre y como disculpa creo a Chris, de verdad Chris best man.
Aww 🥰 how freaking cute I love it I think that’s the coolest thing you can do is to sit in a room full of puppies 🐶 Chris evans is so lucky 🍀 🐶🐶🐶😆🤩😎😍☺️
I used to think we would never get a puppy interview with Chris because it would be universally known that out of all of Hollywood Chris would be the most distracted by the puppies and the interview would go nowhere 😂
OUR PRAYERS HAVE BEEN HEARDDD
Buzz feed still makes videos? I love dogs, this guy is alright, I know he’s famous and stuff. But this video is just so….pointless. Why didn’t he just do this for his own Twitter on his own? I’m sure he could have collaborated with a dog shelter instead and brought attention to that instead of wasting time doing it with a useless middleman, aka buzz feed.
Captain America can play with anything and I could watch it all day long!
Chris Evans is literally me every time I see a dog like I haven't owned 100 other dogs in my life😂😂
ugh those puppies are soo lucky i wanna lick chris evans's face
Part 2 When???
As if i needed another reason to love him more. Chris Evans, sweetest of them all.

Nunca quis tanto ser um cachorro na minha vida
Live laugh love Chris Evans
Take a shot every time Chris says “Buster”
The puppies plus the Boston accent sneaking out ❤
im willing to bet my life savings that BuzzFeed had a 100% women staff attendance that day
when chris mentioned adam driver, my heart pumped out of my chest, felt like my two worlds colliding 🖤🖤🖤
"His smile" 😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️😭❤️😭❤️😭❤️😭
That was 8 minutes of awesome!! Ugh! Be still my heart. So sweet! 😍
Incredible stupidity
Not goona lie I would steal all those doggos TwT
I want to see Bill Skarsgard play with puppies
I wonder how many Stays are here  after Channie talking about that interview on Chan’s Room 😂
this is the most wholesome thing ever
I want him to talk to me like he does those puppies.
About time
his voice dropped 10 octaves with the older guys im-- T.T
Oh. My. Goodness. I'm old enough to be his mother and I just wanna bundle him up and take him home and surround him with dogs. Like seriously, he's absolutely the sweetest guy! What a treat it would be to just sit and have a cuppa with him & with a bunch of fuzzbutts to give scritches to.
💙💙💙💙
I love older dogs, I look in those soulful eyes and my hearts melts.
3:51 christopher jamal quantavius evans, everyone.
You guys should also do Jon bernthal!!
literally a puppy playing with puppies
captin america should return and get a dog like a dog like him  a super dog
God the senior dogs really really melted my heart, they deserve so much love and an amazing home
PLLEEASSEEE, get hayden christensen an interview with puppies!!
Lol so sweet. I love that accent coming out.
Came to see Chris' "who cares" answers after Bang Chan recommended this video. I love that Chris cares about the dogs ONLY
Where's Chris Evans? I am just seeing some puppies & older dogs with a large Golden Retriever.🤔
Totally agree with him. I adopted a 9-year old Staffie girl who had been kept in a cage all her life and she's my heart :)
CAN U GUYS GET STRAY KIDS ON THE SHOW PLEASEEE😭😭
Rumor says he adopted them all.
“thank you for trusting me”😭😭😭
Chris Evans absolutely  has awareness for older dogs just makes my heart melt
I wouldn't be surprised if his dog family expanded after this. 😂❤️
give him kittens now!
people are going to fight over the dog that was in Chris's parts LOL
bye this was so cute
Amazing. So sweet, so funny so Chris!
adam driver playing chris evans, my ultimate combo
That last puppy!!!.. Me if I was a dog and had the chance to smell him 🤤
Lol he calls all of the puppies Buster
I’d behave the same.
If I had ovaries they'd have exploded all over my bedroom wall rn. And no that's not an innuendo 🤣🤣
The way he said “Hi Buster 🥺 Hi pal <3”
This video saving you from mental breakdown
Of course he'll get distracted, he loves dogs 😂 I would be in that situation
Thank you so much for doing this with the older dogs - I've adopted 3 adult rescue dogs, personally. And helped my parents get 2 others. The best decisions ever! Sincerely! They always appreciate it!!!  This action more than any, makes me respect you, Chris.
Chris Evans has a mangina
Dear lord
All this time I'd be like Chris Evans is sucha zaddy, but gosh he's so fricking Cuteeeee 😍
The puppies straight up went to his face showing all the love.  Well, I'd do the same.
Hi Buster Hi Pal
i need more
this was the best interview ive ever watched
The way he talked about earning the trusy of older dogs..that was beautiful.  Got me a lil emotional
Please get Kit Connor to do this, it would be sooo messy and cute at the same time
WE WANT MORE
8:16 Never have I wanted to be a puppy more than at this moment.
Is that the Overcooked Space soundtrack? 😂👍🏽
can we get another 8 hours of this?
Chris Evans wondering why he doesn't do this everyday... what else is money for right?
I just click to see if he answear any of these questions...Well- I knew who I watch
I wish I was a puppy 🙂
I love this guy!  Him with puppies is the best.
Downey it is..
a bunch of cu-teas
I am madly in love with him,my dream man
So cute and so are the puppies.
I can watch this for hours and hours 😭
this is now my comfort video, we have been blessed at last!! THANK YOU!
Chris Evans going hehehehe  for 8mins straight while playing with puppies😂😭🖤🖤🖤🖤 so adorable, he’s just the best 🥺🖤
Ussually it's artists playing with puppies while answering questions but BuzzFeed really knew it was JUST about the puppies this time and it's soo heartwarming
he's VERY boston in this
You know how occasionally you come across those videos that you watch then realize you’ve had a smile on your face the entire time? This is now one of mine. Chris Evans finally got his puppy interview lol and it was everything. He is so sweet and gentle with them and the senior dogs part melted my heart😭❤️
I honestly would watch a 2 hour version of Chris evans playing with dogs
“Come get it”  Ahem
Chris Evans playing with puppies should be the content. They don’t need to ask him anything. We’d watch it.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO US BUZZFEED!!! Who hurt you!!??
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO US BUZZFEED!!! Who hurt you!!??
🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
Well, he did play Loki... Briefly.
This was the best interview i've ever seen! Chris should have puppys during every interview he does 😍😍
I have never wished to be a puppy more
Please lets have babies Chris!!!
LGB
FJB
The fact that he named all the dogs "Buster", HE'S SOO FUNNY 🤣😂
the WHEEZE at 3:27 hes so happy ghjdsfjsdf
Best. Interview. EVER.
he loves them so much OMG
The way he calls every pup buster brown 😭😭😭😭
BEST INTERVIEW EVER !!!! If you guys invite Robert Sheehan with pups im done.. then ive seen it all 🥲🥰
"it's an impossible question to answe- you got a scratch pal? >o<" hahahah
Chris actually did play the part of Loki briefly in Thor: The Dark World.
Legally changing my name to Buster
Im so mad bc these puppies have met Chris evens and I haven’t smh
He is high on puppies💕🥺
He's so sexy, and him being tender with senior pups sends his sexiness off the charts.
is the who cares for me
Ok. I can die in peace now.
Chris Evans is the most pure, sweet and kind hearted man I’ve ever known. He’s just so amazing and whoever gets to be with him better know they’re lucky. Chris is literally perfect, and to pure for this world. He’s done no wrong whatsoever and Chris is literally amazing.
There is something seriously heartwarming about a grown man losing his mind over cute puppies.😍
I just can't read the questions, all i can see is puppies and chris
I think that dogs and other animals can sense when someone is or isn't a good person and the fact that these puppies seem to adore Chris has made my day!
Thanks for a fantastic video!  All hail the Algorithm!
IM SCREAMINGM IT HAPPENED
He is so excited 😂 I love it
This video should’ve been several hours long
Thank you for including senior dogs. 🙏
i like how when they asked a question about dogs that’s when he took the interview seriously 😭
He named every dog buster
only reason i wanna be famous
Bangchan brought me here🤭🤭
This video should have been longer :(
It’s impossible to even pay the slightest bit of attention to the questions because you’re literally blinded by all the cuteness..
Stop trying to demasculinaise men with forced videos scenarios like this.
His laugh is so pure I could really watch this interview forever
this was so much fun
Never heard of him, arse clown with no kids
This is the most adorable video i have seen this entire week 😭❤️ i am in tears
New sub! Liked 😀🙏✌️😀
my coochie is so soaked.
You are playing with your brother
The utter will power of those who adore dogs and do this. Respect. I would have brought all of them home and then my older dog would have never spoke to me again🤣  Love older dogs as well. Fostering them have been the best decision of my life
sebastian stan next
Everyone should do a puppy interview if if they once we're in a marvel movie ☺☺☺😃😍🐶🐕🐶🐕🐶🐕🐶🐕🐶🐕🐮🐧🐶👨👦
Why can't men just let their hair go grey? They look so silly.
I love him so much I'm sobbing
❤️❤️❤️❤️ also lol at "excuse you" near the end. 🤣
this was worth the wait 😭😍
How come this man is still single?! He’s an absolute gem!
Chris Evans my dream husband 🥲
This was worth every second we waited. Period.
@6:48 So true
All his troubles just MELTED away! 🐾🥰
Love of my live😍
8:16 was just me pretending to be a dog 🐕
This is so adorable, i could watch it forever
Who cares what a commie does.
I am saving this in my "not feel sad" Playlist ❤
Can we have one video like that with Fórmula 1 drivers, like Charles Leclerc, Mick Schumacker, Lando Norris, Sebastian Vettel, Pierre Gasly, Danniel Ricardo, Lewis Hamilton, pleaseeeeee
The best Interview ever
I trust a man who loves dogs.
i need him
i’m in love with this man
He’s such a dog lover all the time!! He would have been in  heaven during this interview!! Kinda like I would have been if I was meeting Chris evans!!!
This video is too much for me 🥹❤️❤️❤️
That Puppy should've have been ME!😡
MANIFESTING JOSEPH QUINN TO BE ON THIRST TWEETS NEXT. Or honestly just have his own puppy interview bc we all know what happened in the other one 😭💔                  🕯         🕯          🕯 🕯                         🕯                 🧎🏻‍♀️ 🕯                         🕯         🕯          🕯                 🕯  *escucha las palabras de las brujas*
Every dog is a puppy some of them are just a little older 💗
This clown says the dumbest things so they think puppies will make him likable again. Play with puppies while smugly calling most Americans trash u pog
Please tell me he adopted at least 9 of these pups!
bang chan brought me here
I really wanted to see Stray Kids playing with the puppies
They should just do this for all interviews . Make it the proper etiquette . Like when. Cops put a blanket over a victim regardless if they're cold or not lol.
Are you kidding me? Why doesn’t this video have millions of views already! The best thing on earth Chris Evans with Puppies! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
💗
Chris is looking great  this is such a great video
Did anyone else go from groaning about the sheer cuteness and smiling like an idiot to shedding tears about the love for the older dogs? No? Just me?
Perfect 😍
I'd be happier with some kittens or cats. Even just adult dogs are better than puppies
"hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself" IM YELLING
When he said "Aw, come get it" I felt like he was personally asking me for snuggles 🤣
It is 8 minutes of chris laughing 💀
Who knew you could get high while petting puppies 😂😂
love. that he called them buster brown. almost kids this days won't  know who that this.
Can someone that ripped be this adorable......
I mean, I'm more obsessed now, and whenever chris laughed in his whole interview I laughed too 😂
Chris has absolutely no interest in answering any of these questions because he's too busy playing with the puppies, and I'm here for it 💕
I can die a happy girl now. CHRIS EVANS + PUPPIES+DOGS! I really hope these puppies/dogs get great homes. All of my dogs have been rescues and as one who helps her aunt with her dog rescue, well, he is just the best ambassador for dogs. Period!
If he wanted to be an animator that means he's probably an artist, and it got me thinking if the drawings we see the MCU's Steve Rogers work on are actually Evans'. Does anyone know if that's the case? It would be a fun fact about the Marvel movies, and about the actor himself.
Dude Chris evans sucks. Somehow has everything handed to him but still has some of the worst takes on everything but is still beloved anyways cause marketing. I mean to get 2 marvel characters on the big screen and still act bitter about things is trash. This but was a joke in the movie the interview and now it’s reality but not jo Gordon levitt but Chris “I hate my own kind” evans 😂 I just wish he had a shred of humility
omg-I have never been in therapy ..until now! When he said "thank you for trusting me", that healed me. I love love love him and his love for dogs! He is a comfort person that everyone needs in their lives, including himself
So handsome 😭😭
8:17
That man is too sexy period!
Chris Evans in this interview epitomizes how I react around any animal that gives me even an ounce of affection.
I'm so turned on 😂 Chris daddy, you really a gem
This video bottled up could cure any desease, end wars and world hunger! My cheeks are hurting from non-stop cheesing like a pickle princess in a small town! Oh and now I am in love with Chris Evans - I know, I am very late to the party! (Every used exclamation point is very much needed!!!)
“Waterfall of puppies” - Chris Evans 2022
#adoptdontshop
He probably tried to take them all home. And they would have gone.
what a great way to start my Monday. Watching Chris Evans playing with puppies. Life is good again.
Chris every 3sec in this interview: “Hi guys, hi pal! Come here!” 🥺❤️
I swear when I’m a actor someday and I get invited to this I will die instantly . I love puppies 😭
i'm pregnant
8:15  chris evans reaction is so cute. I want to be a dog now hehehe
he looks like this is all he ever wanted and i can’t blame him. 🥺
OMG WE FINALLY GOT IT
"Rescue Dodger was the best decision of my life" awwwww
can't wait for skz aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaqq
Watched it on loop already❤️
Wow 😲
The way Chris laughs is damn sooo cute!! 😍😍  He can't hide his excitement playing with the puppies.
Mr Bangchan sent me here 🥰
cutest interview ever
I wanna keep them all, including Chris. Thank you
When I was a kid I really wanted to be a chef but watching this video made me want to be one of those dogs 😃
And I have come up with the best answer yet. “WHO CARES”
I wonder if he took any of the puppies home.
Chris, u finally got ur puppy interview
- Scarlett is my girl  AAAAAAA perdi tudo com isso
This man is the reason I'm gay.
I love that he just got lost in the cuteness! Same.
god, could he be more perfect!?
So adorable 🥺❤️
I wish he wasn’t such a woke douche
My whole face is just literally smiling through this interview and now I can't stop.
"Scarlett's my girl" SOMEONE SEDATE ME 😭😭😭
THE WAY HE SAID HI BABYYY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Here because Chris (BangChan) thinks Chris (Evans) and the puppies are cute.   Ryan Reynolds collecting all the Chris's
I love the senior dogs section. They need as much love and have a harder time getting adopted.
this is way better than therapy
In my family we have a term, pronounced like 'Aye'. It stands for A.E. to refer to very very sweet people who are possibly too wholesome for this world. The letters stand for Angel on Earth. That is Chris Evans.
Re-title it to "A Giant Puppy Playing With Puppies"
Why is this not number 1 trending yet? WHY
this is everything I imagined, expected and more, love you
Why is this the hottest thing ever ....my heart is melting 💓 💗 💖 ♥ 💙
i never knew i needed this in my life until i saw chris evans laying on a purple set on the floor with puppies all over him and laughing his iconic chris evans laugh. im actually in tears- definitely my favorite buzzfeed puppy interview... my life is complete.
Maaaaan I wanna get famous just to do one of these interviews LMAO
Adopt senior dogs. They cool. 👍🏻
Can I be one of these puppies?

Oh so cute... cute puppies bring out the best in us all! :)

Is it just me or does Sebastian stan need to do a puppy interview
who's here after buzzfeed announced that stray kids are going to do the puppy interview
there should be some sort of law that every interview with chris evans from now on must have puppies
Horsefood need a treat
And he'd pick Loki. Cause he PLAYED Loki playing him.
I need a hospital IV to have hate to balance the overload of cuteness here.
Uscite lo snyder cut!!
Adopt! And thank you sir for lending your platform for something so important!
Thankyou BUZZFEED ☺️☺️
I could watch this all day!
MOOORE PLS
Best video ever ❤️
i cant believe i've lived this long without this. this literally is that one thing we didnt know we wanted. i love him <3
Exactly what I thought was going to happen happened…lol ….😂😂😂. Just 8 minutes of Chris excitedly playing with puppies and I love it 🥰
Is this the cutest it could ever be N Cap mentioned Loki too 😍
lol cute
i love chris evans and i love dogs. this is absolutely amazing.
I’m still riding off the high from this interview
he is the embodyment of a golden retriever
The “ah ah ah” laugh kills me
this video made me love chris so much more 😭🥺💕
One of the bestest interview ❤ 😍 💖 ❣ 💕 💘 ❤ 😍 💖 ❣ 💕 💘 I would love to give interview like this..dream come true
One of the bestest interview ❤ 😍 💖 ❣ 💕 💘 ❤ 😍 💖 ❣ 💕 💘 I would love to give interview like this..dream come true
I would so be the same way. Couldn’t concentrate for nothin’ 😂.  #WhoCares🐶 #GuysGuys🐶
I am the melted Face emoji, the melted Face emoji is me
8:15 i would have done the same, bubba. i would have the sameeee.
... and he adopted every puppy he named in that interview.  Or at least, he should have. That man was made for puppies.
This is indeed the best interview
FINALLY!!!
Ur really the sweetest 💖
All of a sudden I’m a dog now
We need Hayden Christensen or Taika Waititi to do one of these.
Chris’s reaction to all the dogs and clenching his face to his fist to keep from exploding is the most accurate account of fangirl behavior  (like I get when I see him) I have *ever* seen a celeb have omg CHRIS 🥹😭😭😭🫶🏾✨ *brb my heart’s exploding too*
NOTHING. JUST WATCH CHRIS PLAYING WITH PUPPIES AND LAUGHING AT THEIR CUTENESS
8 mins and 40 seconds of paradise😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
♡
Oh my hod. CHRIS EVANS WAS BUZZ LIGHTYEAR?!
What a sweet man. I couldn't stop smiling and laughing
Can I adopt? I mean Evans
Kudos for having older doggos.
Gawddamn, seeing cis men honoring consent and being so tender with animals gives me hope...
i've watched this video four times too many
1:50 did something TO me
😍😍😍
Okay now thirst tweets
This is just so wholesome to watch 🤧😫☺️
this is literally the interview we were all waiting for
i LOVE the senior dog section
Yessss! I
Please do this with Andrew Garfield
I posted this comment on Tom Holland’s 2nd pup interview 2 weeks ago, so I’m really glad it was already in the works…  “Lightyear comes out this month - if BuzzFeed wasn’t planning on a puppy interview with Chris Evans, that would be a missed opportunity. Make it happen #ChrisEvansPuppyInterview !”
I’m back again
Please invite Robert Pattinson next. Pleaseeee
DO THIS WITH ROSS LYNCH PLEASE
meanwhile, hes tweeting about how people need to die off because they dont comform to his politics. this guy needs to try to shill his movie in saudi arabia or middle east, see how well itll do there when he tells them to die.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 i want a doggggoooooooooooooooooooo...why buzzfeed why you do this ..thank you
I'd pay to be a puppy right now
Too cute 🥰
Finally! Now we want thirst tweets video with Chris next!
Every single time this guy manages to melt my heart ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Papa puppy with his baby puppies
Please do a puppy interview with Tom hiddleston
im losing my mind
Typical dog names: Max, Spot, Bruno, Princess  Chris Evans: Buster. All of them.
the fact that he casted for Lightyear and he named different dogs with "Buster", which reminds me to Andy's dog from Toy Story lol
Tom Hardy puppy interview when
I smiled ear to ear for the entire video
I never thought you can get high with puppies hahaha

Aww it’s just so sweet to watch both Chris and the pups. ❤️❤️

Just an incredibly handsome 41 year old man living his best life
Those lucky puppies😊
Saw this in the recommended on YT. Didn’t click. Saw Bang Chan live saying he watched this video. Instant click.
These dogs don't realize how lucky they are
"hi baby" sanaol aso
He's so sweet and gentle, that just makes him even more attractive
So they are all named buster, I guess?
Ohhhh, the ones w/ the gray and red collars should've totally gone home with him!!!
Wow. I really wish I was a puppy. 😂
I love you Chris Evans!! oh and the puppies too!!
💗
Chris loves "Return of the Mack" too? 😭
Love that they brought out the older pup pups
As if I needed more reasons to love him 🥰
LITERALLY THE BEST! This is such a Gem🥹🥹🥺🥺🥰🥰🥰💘💘💘💘
watching this at half speed is my new favorite ASMR video
this is the best video i've ever seen.
May I adopt one please?
I’ve simultaneously never wanted anything more in the whole multiverse than to be both the puppies and Chris Evans 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
Im here only for the puppies ^^
guys you know Buzzfeed euthanizes the puppies after right ? 🫤
I know its just a voice roll, but I bet he still went to the gym for it.
😍😍😍
Loving the fact he literally can't focus
At 3:50 was Jamal
Chris Evans + dogs = perfection! 💖
MY HEART HAS MELTED SOOOO BADDDDDD😭🥺
i wish i am a puppy
I always enjoy watching celebs play with puppies, though I’m not much of a dog person myself. I still haven’t seen Lightyear but hopefully I get time to eventually. Movies are pumping out so much faster now than a few years ago and I’m disappointed that I don’t have time to go to h to the movies frequently like a used to. Especially Marvel and Disney content, good lord there’s something out every month or every few weeks it seems. 😂😩
Loved the fact that they had older dogs too. We got our family dog from a shelter when he was about two years old. He had been at that shelter for weeks, simply because he was no longer a cute little puppy. But with a little love he blossomed into the best dog ever. Don't know if someone at Buzzfeed made that call, or if Chris insisted, but I'm thankful that the senior dogs were included.
I'm actually watching for the puppies
I think they should have picked less nervous seniors for Chris to interact with. I follow a buttload of dog rescue organizations and channels and yes, most shelter dogs are nervous but some dogs that have been in shelters for years can still be very friendly and happy with complete strangers. It'd be a better way to advertise the positives of rescuing older and senior pups vrs only getting puppies.
Tom: Chris (Evans) has never been to a puppy interview? Oh, he'd love this! Chris, months later: **MELTS IN PUPPIES AND ELDER DOGS**
For the next PUPPY INTERVIEWS: I want Anthony Mackie, Chris Hemsworth, Sebastián Stan, Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Chris Pratt, Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law, Ming Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, Misha Collins, Joshua Jackson, Nathan Fillion, Jennifer Lawrence, Hugh Jackson, Hugh Dancy, Mads Mikkelsen, Andrew Garfield, Oscar Issac, Ryan Reynolds, Emma Stone, Nicolas Cage, Simon Pegg, Taika Waititi, Tom Hanks
I don't see a single boy in the comments.
That's dyed hair if I've ever seen it
Happy Father’s Day Chris
Many people wish they could disguise themselves as those puppies.
Well hello Chris🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Chris Evans: Come and get it. Me: I'm on my way
1:44 I watched that part so many times🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹😩😩😩😩🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
My head just expoded
i could watch this for more than an hour, Chris is too cute with the puppies and so adorable
I’m here because of Chan!! Hi STAY!!
It probably took everything in him not to adopt every single one of those puppies!
This is officially the cutest video on the internet 🥹🤍🫶🏻
I can’t decide whether I am more jealous of Chris Evans for being surrounded by such beautiful puppies or whether I am jealous of the puppies because they are with Chris Evans
His shift between excitedly playing with the puppies and mellowing out for the comfort of the senior dogs is so touching!
I just smiled, ear to ear, for 8 minutes, 44 seconds
I've seen interviews from your channel before...but this time I came for Chris, because Bangchan of Stray Kids mentioned you, and he LOVED this interview...and we love Bangchan You have our eyes watching Buzzfeed, all STAYS (Stray Kids fandom) over the world are coming  here right now... Stray Kids US tour is on the corner, so take the wise decision Buzzfeed, because we will be watching
This has got to be one of the most wonderful interviews I’ve ever seen!!!!!! I was smiling throughout the entire video and the way he was treating the older dogs was just so special, awwwww, my heart melted! 🥰🥺
He barely managed to answer the questions because of the puppies overload cuteness, that's so funny😂😂 and cute 😍😍
I want to squish all their little faces, too!  Love how Chris really took Tom Holland's advice and totally used the pretense of promoting a new film to just play with dogs whilst ignoring almost every unnecessary question except those pertaining to, well, dogs.  Older pets and children all deserve to be adopted into a loving home!
He’s so handsome…
I wish I was both Chris Evans and those puppies
This is like a "Hot Ones" interview, but done with puppies. :) Well done!
The fact that Chris called scarlet his girl it really shows how much he cares about her
the only good thing on buzzfeed
Estoy aqui para ver a los perritos ser felices con Chris Evans 🤗🥰
I teared up as he loved on the older dogs 🥹 so sweet
Tim Allen's A better buzz lightyear than you
What watch is he wearing?
If I feel down, I know this video exists 💫THANKS 💫🤣
Did he say come get it! Lmao
when he says thanks for trusting me, i teared up
I genuinely want to become a celebrity purely to do a puppy interview
AAAAAAAAAAAAW FINALLY Ik I’m two days late but still
‘You’re so sweet pal, thanks for trusting me bubba’🥹🥺❤️
i dont know what to do with myself after this.
SO FREAKIN ADORABLE! And the doggos are okay too.
FINALLY 😭
I wish I was that puppy 😭
It was the 8 most wonderful minutes of my life! This interview was so soothing to see. Seeing Chris happy like this with all these little dogs makes me just as happy! Thank you foryour interview and Chris was really too cute in this video! <3
Please Sebastian Stan next
God has answered my prayers for this.
Esto es demasiado hermoso,
These interviews are the best! The actors are always really nice and act like little kids - with such wonder, happiness and amazement - when they get to play with the dogs and cats :D Really makes my heart melt. I wish I could get my own dog but sadly I live alone and work too long so I know I couldn't take care of one...
Him calling all the dogs "bobo" Or "baba" Is the cutest thing ever. I love this man so much
Hahahaha
‘when captain ameriqueer lost to hollyweird, he says all those who oppose the woke must yield, he bends to the left, he slams at the Right what stupid fool…’
We all came to see the puppies i mean who doesnt click on a video that has puppies in the title...

Best interview ever😍
I wish I was one of those puppies. 🥰
8:15 I wish I was that dog. ✌️
mt cheeks hurt from smiling sm
Chris talking about the senior dogs like they're seasoned war veterans is the best thing ever ❤️❤️
damn i love him and miss him soo much as cap america :(
"Chris Evans is cute too but the puppies" - bangchan 2022
Best video ever. I adopted my dog in 2019 and he was 11 years old. His name is Oscar and he's a Chihuahua-pug. He's now 14 years old and a happy, healthy boy. He is my baby.
F#ck that dude, disconnected paid for person. He is a poster board with skin, stop pushing gay on children and learn what real Americans believe not the echo chamber you live in.
Love a man who loves animals as much as this man 🙌😊
Here cause bang chan told me it finally happened
3:03 What's one question you wish you'd get asked during interviews?  "Would you like to take one of these puppies home?"
The Top 10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners ever!  1. If everything is coming your way, then you're in the wrong lane. 2. Few women admit their age; few men act it. 3. The Big Bang Theory: God Spoke and BANG! it happened.  4. Why is "abbreviation" such a long word?  5. Nobody's perfect. I'm a nobody. 6. You can't have everything; where would you put it? 7. Who is "General Failure" and why is he reading my hard disk? 8. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool. 9. Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time.  10. The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.   Editorial: Perhaps the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
I died of tenderness 😻
I need harry styles to do the puppy interview

OH MY GODDDDDD 😭😭😭😭
My ovaries. . .my ovaries!
How is this man single and not married
I’ve raised puppies and older dogs and I would choose an older dog every time. Puppies are adorable but they are exhausting. Like the no sleep, constant vigilance, destruction of your house kind of exhaustion, lol. But any dog is worth any amount of work if we’re being honest. 🥰
i came just to see how many girls were in the comments and am not disappointed by the ratio lol
Here because BangChan from STRAY KIDS mentioned !
Chris from Stray kids bought me here ! please buzzfeed we want to see STRAY KIDS in this interview so badly!
The fact that it was Chris’ idea to bring on the senior dogs too. He was so sweet and patient with them. And he’s right that there’s something special about older dogs. Chris is just a gem of a human.
well , chris from stray kids bring me here . Thank you  chan !!
I could watch this video for hours and wouldn't even complain
Dang, now i wanna be the puppy at 8:15🙀
He's soo cute guy 🥰🥰❤️😚😘

Been waiting on this one 😭
I was not disappointed! Next, bring Kaley Cuoco!
the reactions are 1000% me when I see my dog every day
Who else got watery eyes when he stared to thank the older dog for trusting him? No? Just me? Okay 🥹
Buster Brown😂
Is he drunkk?😁
Ahhh now I can rip 😌
Now get him to read Thirst Tweets.
Chris evens is a little kid in a grown man’s body

Chris Evans having a cute attack for 8 minutes.
Chris Evans is a “woke” Moron! Just the site of him makes me physically ill! Glad his movie bombed!
Ok is it weird to be jealous of the puppies
This is the best video on the internet
people still watch buzzfeed? even after all the sexism? crazy. hope women step it up soon
Nothing but feminine energy on this thread
I love it when celebs play with puppies but im gonna put this out here, Tom Hiddleston with puppies would be amazing.
U.S. Government: "Everybody has to give up their guns so there are no more FBI-coordinated false-flag mass shootings!"  Also the U.S. Government: "We're going to start unjustified wars all over the world and get millions of innocent people killed, and we're also going to open the Southern border so there's a 49% increase in drug overdose deaths, because drugs already kill millions more people every year than gun deaths do, so let's make the problem ten times worse!"😋😛😜🤪😝
How is he this adorable 😭 this is too wholesome
nunca había sonreído tanto
He's gorgeous beautiful man.🥰
Who cares 😂
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless him! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who believes in him and follows his commandants!  Have a blessed day, everyone! ❤
Ever had a moment where u badly wanna be a puppy??
I'd like to see him handcuffed to groot that would be hilarious 🤣
Amazing
Sometimes it's hard to earn trust. It's like  a rare blue flower, which is hard to find, but once it's found you need to earns it trust, to enable to grow, its been hidden for so long because it was scared that it will never find anyone to trust, love or respect it became the rare blue flower, which is hard to find.
Well I can be a dog I can bark arf arf
OMG, this is my dream interview!🥰
"No disrespect to the puppies" just pureness 🥺🥺🥺

The way a person interacts with pets can definitely tell you a lot about them.  Seems like Chris is a walking safe space. 🥲

buzzfeed - u must answer chris - who cares
doctor: you have 8:44 minutes to live  me: hand me the freakin phoneeeee (aggressively types Chris Evans plays with puppies)
These puppies have no idea about how many famous people they’ve met
"And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life.  And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works.  Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire." (REVELATION 20:12-15 NKJV)   Today, while you are still alive and able, may you repent from your sins, believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that JESUS CHRIST is your Lord and Savior, so that through Him, your name will be written in the Book of Life.    "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved." (JOHN 3:16-17 NKJV)   ✝️ JESUS LOVES YOU. HE DIED FOR YOU.  Please do not ever forget that..
He’s got such an easy laugh, heartwarming
WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IN GOD OR NOT YOU WILL KNEEL BEFORE HIM ON JUDGEMENT DAY AND HE WILL GO THROUGH EVERY WORD YOU SAID/EVERY THOUGHT YOU HAD/EVERY SIN YOU DID.  YOU WONT BE ABLE TO ARGUE WITH HIM EITHER, YOU WILL KNOW YOU ARE GUILTY AND MADE A BIG MISTAKE.  THE ONLY WAY OUT IS TO TURN TO JESUS BEFORE ITS TOO LATE.  YOURE EITHER FOR GOD OR AGAINST GOD AND THERE IS BUT 1 GOD (its not satan/buddha/allah).    Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."-John 14:6 "But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven."-Matthew 10:33 “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord”-Romans 6:23
Idk why but Chris Evans never did anything for me until this video. I'm now in love.
'scuse you!...
1 minute in i thought he was actualy answering puppy questions until i started reading them on the screen.
my heart melted when he talked about the older dogs 💚

My heart breaks for the older dogs, Chris is right, they get overlooked a lot and people shoo them away when all they want is some love. Thank you so much Buzzfeed and Chris Evans for doing this and bringing in older dogs as well❤❤

We've adopted 3 older chihuahuas over the years that had to leave their original home for one reason or another. One was because the family were out most of the day and weren't around her a lot, another was because the other dogs in the house bullied him. And they are the best dogs ever 🥰🥰
I've never felt jealous with dogs until now.

Dodger is getting a sibling in the near future clearly 😂
Best interview EVER
Lo rápido que uno se enamora... Increíble
I dont know if I am jealous of Chris Evans for being with the puppies or the puppies for being with Chris Evans
For some reason, I kept expecting him to say "I could do this all day."
Of COURSE it’s Chris Evans who finally gets them to highlight senior dogs. Swoon!
This is THE perfect video
I want to be one of those dogs🥺
He's SO EXCITED!!!  "Bout to go home with all these props."  The fact that he requested older dogs. 😭😭😭
I can't believe it's taken so long for him to do one of these
Ooo how I wish I was one of those puppy!!!
You definitely hear the Boston when he plays with the peppers lol
I always find it hilarious in Knives Out when his character has to act like he hates dogs. That's how you know he's a good actor lol.
Cute animals 😍💯
Omg I just fell in love even deeper with him!! I know realistically he's not but he seems like he's just soooo perfect!!
I'm begging for Hayden
Oh finally
Imagine being one of those puppies

I got a light year trailer during this video
Now my dream is to be a puppy
Sierra Ann temple and Cohen beach are completely evil criminals. They harass single young women. They terrorize them with their friends, by hacking their computers,  spying on them 24/7, threatening them, and verbally harassing them.
Where can I audition to be a puppy for upcoming interviews? 👀
I think I just died inside after watching that. I'd kill to be one of those dogs 😭
Chris, to every interview question: WHO CARES? *proceeds to love puppies*
Ooooo.... this is the cutest thing I have ever seen !
God? Are you there? Can you give me something like this? A handsome man who goes silly with puppies? I want that, God. Thank you.
até o cachorro beija o chris evans e eu não 🥲🥲🥲
Finally! The world got what it deserved😫😁
They better have made him read thirsty tweets 😭😭I need a Chris Evan thirst Tweet video
hoy conocí la envidia.
Best interview ever
Please bring Mr. Evans back on a regular basis. Please.
god i love this man
i want to see Stray Kids on here playing with puppies😭😭
Sighhhhh. I mean does it get any better than this?!? ❤️ I would love him no matter how he looked. He’s thoughtful and insanely intelligent and a genuine man. The whole package!
This is literally the interview most of us were most hoping to see🥺🥺🥺♥️
Scarlett’s my girl 😭😭
Did Chris take were 1 or 2 home with Him.
Random, but Fantastic 4 Chris Evans still owns my heart.
Awww he is so cute with puppies!
goodness im so in love with him 😭
this is my favorite video ever
i would like to apply for a job at buzzfeedceleb please
So y’all suddenly can bark now?
Dodger will be jealous🤣🤣 Chris is in trouble now
Okay so I took the line “come get it” a whole different way 😳🫣😍🥰
So much serotonin packed in eight minutes, and it’ll last for years😊
I could watch this all day🥺
ADAM DRIVERRR WHAT
He was falling love with these puppies. So he is so lovely
i’m literally gonna cry🥹
.o.
He’s such a gentle, kind soul!
Could we get Sebastian Stan next? 😍😍👀
This is literally 8 minutes of Chris Evans just playing with puppies and honestly, I'd watch a whole hour of this lol
He just makes your heart melt 💖
I’ve never wanted to be a puppy so bad in my life
now i can die peacefully
Arf arf
wow the serotonin boost i never knew i needed 😭💕
I need Harry Styles doing a puppy interview.
omg my heart. I'm totally playing this vid every time I'm sad
I used to cringe at the word "bubba". Now, after hearing it from Chris Evans, "bubba" is like music to my ears 🥰
the way he just repeats in that little excited voice “hi buster brown!” MY HEART-
I love how gentle he is with them!!! Like the interactions are just so pure, so different from other celebs! No hate but Chris is such a phenomenal guy, I would die for his thanks for trusting mr
Him with the puppies was cute. Gave me the sweet chaotic energy that I needed. HIM with the older dogs, has sent my heart to another 🌎
Chris, you're my angel baby! 😭😭😭
my eyes actually teared up. I could know nothing about this man and walk out engaged to him after this.
i wish that was me
We need an uncut version of this
Which one is he going to take home to Dodger? All of them?? Okay. 🥺😆❤ He needs to adopt the "Excuse You" puppy at the end. 🤣🤣🤣
This is adorable.  I think Dodger needs another brother or sister. Its funny how he's calling these puppies.. bubbie, buster, buster brown when i call my dogs the same nicknames. These pups are really loving Chris. SUPER adorable... Chris and the pups. x
something more beautiful than this man with dogs?
He is so adorable bruh
My heart is SO full 💛
I think he needs to adopt the little pupper with the black snout!!!
FINALLYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!
Between Chris Evans' rushing in a Captain America move to help Regina King at the Oscars and this video, this is why he is my celebrity crush...!
All I can say is: FINALLY!
this might just be the best thing i've seen all week <3
Puppy interview was literally made for this moment.
He’s adorable 🥰
https://youtube.com/watch?v=2E0r4HrmdvA&feature=share 😱🤗
Why is no one talking about what happened there at the end
I’d be a murderer. Just kidding. Puppies!
People are so kind. When I ask if I may love their dog when they walk them, they say yes. My dog died. He was16. Best dog ever.
Okay, now Sebastian Stan
I'm confused if I should watch Chris Evans or puppy!!!
I need to marry this man…
I would do…anything…for this man. I love him so much🫀💜
Viejo sabroso
The way he is comforting buster 🥹
4:41 ❤️
I love him so much 🫀💜 I wish I was the puppy on his lap🫀💜
I was waiting for this so bad
andrew garfield next!!
"I could do this all day."  <3
Oh my Goodness ❤️ so many puppies 🐾🐾🐾🐾

my heart is slowly melting as i watch this.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOKKK.
Too late Buzz
no hetero but...
So much serotonin
New life goal: become famous enough to be interviewed in a room full of puppies.  Or kittens.
“Let’s build some trust.”   That statement alone says so much about Chris Evans when interacting with the older dogs! Chris Evans + puppies = pure happiness & joy
cured my soul
My goal in life has suddenly changed. I need to become a puppy asap! 😑😑😑
So cute    The puppies too I guess
This was everything I thought I wanted and way more! Thank you!
You can tell the puppies smell how he loves dogs… They were so comfy with him!!! Cuteness overload…😭
Therapy is expensive but Chris Evans’ laugh is ✨ *free* ✨
has any celebrity ever actually taken a puppy home? are they allowed to?
and Mr. Evans just turns to mushhhh ~~~~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I worked with the vet that took care of Chris' dogs!
Don't you just love the way he says "Scarlett is my gulr (girl)" you can hear the boston accent 😍.. ahh ne easy my heart
"Chris Evans + Senior Dogs" 😭😭😭😭😭
we need rdj nexttt pls
8:15 wish that puppy was me
I will watch this everyday for the rest of my life and it will play at my funeral
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Buster and Pal are so sooooooooo him for nicknames. Haha.
Adorable ❣️❣️❣️
you literally can not hate chris evans. he is so down to earth,funny ,nice and hot. llike...... also i love his laugh
Definitely my favorite interview ever
Hi pal
I wasn't huge Evans fan, but every person who's so gentle and loving with animals has my full respect. Great man. 👍
cutest video ever!!! I wonder if he took any puppies home
it is so enjoyable to see someone genuinely enjoy puppy/dog love, and be so gentle, caring and understanding, I have a lot of respect for people like that :) what a nice guy he is!! Seeing this side of people makes them so likeable, how can you resist puppy/ dog charm?! Lovely, and makes my day to see someone and animals happy :)
Did i fall down rhe rabbit hole of puppy interviews at 2 am?  Have i watched 20 so far?  The answer to both questions is YESS
Please Pedro Pascal!!!
"I wanted to be an animator" how does marvel find actors who literally *are* their characters
DID. NOT. DISSAPPOINT!
I'm gonna need the uncut version of this interview
“I’m expecting a waterfall of puppies.” 😂😂😂  BUZZFEED WE NEED PART 2!!!
hahahahaha I am in love with this interview, those babies are so lucky as well Chris. Who cares about questions with these cute creatures around you hahahahaha... :)
lezbehonest all of us wants to be that one last puppy
8 minutes wasn’t enough!! I need at least 1 hour footage of this guy with his furry friends!! 🥲
My heart just melted.  This is the best interview I've seen.
id marry him in an instant
Man oh man 😩
Say goodbye to alcohol making are bad thoughts go away
"no disrespect to the puppies" he's the purest i love him
I can't describe the amount of serotonin this video gave me
Reading thirst tweets should be next 🥵
I watched this with a huge smile on my face the whole time. How can you get anything done with such adorable ness around you? 😆 I couldn’t.
i am so in love with this man
“Thanks for trusting me” 🥹🤧
they moderated tf out of these comments lmfaooo
Buzz feed thank you for this
Chris just wants to be alone with the fur babies! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤awwwwwwwwwwswwww the little fur babies 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
The way the world is expected to watch a 41 year old man play with puppies is beyond me 🤣🤣
I never wanted to be a dog so badly
best 8 minutes of my entire life
I think this is my new favorite video on the entire internet
Puppies are like: oh shit it’s chris evans let me lick him as much as i can
How’s does he not have a girlfriend, he’s pretty dang close to perfect
This so sooo amazing!! He is the literal best!!
This is just chris evans playing with puppies and say a word or two in between
Puppy litters are the best times at my job at the vet
No we need a part 40. This is the greatest thing ever! Just pure joy and pure bliss I…. My heart is so full🥹🥹 thank you!
I like puppies but not dogs. I heard recently there is this disease where dog licks amputates people so be careful.
Is this heaven?
bring Tom Hiddleston, Sebastian Stan or Anthony Mackie please
Hahahahahhaha I really love him. 🥲💕
Frank Iero next please. We deserve it and he deserves all the happiness that comes with cute puppies
OMG did he not adopted at least 1 afterwards? To keep his buddy company and spread the love This was wholesome to watch. 🤍🤍
Chris has THEE most contagious laugh ever 😂
How many times is too many times to watch this in its entirety?
FINALLY. Finally this happened. It was just as I expected it to be: Chris flipping Evans being completely in luv with the puppies. ❤️
t amo
Chris evans and a bunch of puppies in the same room? This is too much for me to handle
He answers 0 question, yet this is the best content we will ever have of Chris
Absolute cuteness
He with the older dogs 🥲🥲🥲🥲
he’s melting my heart by every second.
Oh to be a puppy playing with  Chris
Chris 🤝 buster
my jaw unhinged from the smiling
After all these years...🤧💕
We definitely now need one with Sebastian Stan! That would be the cutest thing ever❤
I learned nothing except that Chris Evans is everything you’d want in a dog-loving man
I want to get famous only to do the puppy interview.
i need the unedited cut, please and thank you <3
His laugh 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I love that he brings the older dogs which really shows how he really love DOGS and not the puppies but just all dogs. His respect for the older dogs is increadable <333
He only accepted to give this interview because of these puppies. His dog must be so jealous now.
😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂https://youtube.com/shorts/MEfKmoTy5Yo?feature=share
WE NEEDED THIS
this brightened up my entire day, no, year
8:16 ayooo chris?
idc abt the other chris's GIVE ME THIS ONE
Please bring Sebastian Stan next
I think I'm pregnant after watching this
I loved you, Chris Evans, but I hated you after you said that people who don't support homosexuals are fools and will become extinct like dinosaurs, even though we all know that homosexuality is forbidden in all religions, they are trying to protect their children from falling into sin
Is this heaven, am I in heaven
Love animals especially dogs and puppies
Oh no what’s happening to me 🧍🏾‍♀️🚶🏾‍♀️🧎🏾‍♀️🐕
Why so little senior dog footage? 😭😭
Buzzfeeeddd, THANK.YOU.SO.MUCH!!!!!!
this is literally just chris fighting cuteness aggression and trying not to get distracted 😭
Why does he seem high or drunk or something? Lol
the fact that he named four different dogs “buster” is adorable
HE FINALLY GETS HIS WISH!! And I agree 100% about senior dogs. They have just as much love to give as puppies. ADOPT /FOSTER/RESCUE A SENIOR PET!! Chris is just precious. Dodger needs a furry sibling and Chris should just adopt kids.
As if I wasn’t already in love with this man
Wow!
Kittens and shelter cats next ! 🐈🐱♥️
Kittens and shelter cats next ! 🐈🐱♥️
I hate this guy.
I think Chris and Buster just fell in love😄
This just proves even more that he’s the perfect man. Dogs are fantastic judges of character and they always love Chris
I have been waiting years for this
Only Tom Hardy could be a more perfect guest than Chris!
3:47 Can’t listen to “Return of the Mac”  without thinking about Chris and those adorable puppies. :)
“God, I dunno!”  Most Boston thing to say ever.
He really is just a genuinely good human being.
I love that the only question he answered without getting distracted is the one about dogs lol
soo adorable
Chris is literally me with dogs😂😂 he’s so freaking relatable
How cute Chris looks with puppies😍🐕
I love his laugh 😭😭😭🫶🏾
dodger: 👁👄👁
I really appreciated his plug for older dogs. It made this interview even more genuine.
A puppy playing with other puppies 🤸‍♀️
Please, NEVER END THESE VIDEOS!
My imagination is going feral at 8:15
He can play with my puppies 🥴
after more than half of the interview he finally look at the camera for more than a second lol
distraction central
"The economy is in the toilet, the Left have ruined everything what should we do?..Somebody get Chris Evans and puppies ASAP! We need to distract the masses!" Smfh.
The laughing is like a dad laughing
best puppy interview ive seen so far ..
Damn I never really cared for him, but I think I fell in love
"This is the best interview of my life." MY HEART😭
I'm not alive
i was dead inside before thissss… \
The only thing missing is a baby 😍
I just spent 8 minutes smiling.
Puppies everywhere, is the solution for everything
I love seeing the celebs get super distracted with puppies! Chris Evans delivered! Every other interviewee was able to focus too well 😂😂😂
Chris looks like he's living his best life here, right 😍?
He is so AMAZING 👏
I'm dead. That's it.
Now get Sebastian Stan to play with puppies.   Edit: also Henry Cavill as well. He is a devoted dog dad too!! Plus an extremely sexy man.
Never realized how Bostonian he is, this was the best interview!!!!
Lmaoo, did anyone catch that he called one of the pups by their name?? I literally melted when I heard him do it 😫😫
*vibrating at a high-level frequency* I LOVE HIM
How can Chris Evans be so cute and masculine at the same time!!! 🥺🥺❤❤
Him talking about Scarlett 🥰😍
Him ‘come get it come get it’ Me SAY NO MORE 🏃‍♀️ 💨
Putting celebrities with puppies won’t make me like them
How adorable. Best interview ever😂😂🤣😅😅
Like wonderful older women, wonderful older dogs get overlooked all the time. What a shame! Not everything that's new and shiny is the right thing to have around.
Without Doubt ... The Best Interview on The Internet !!! Absolutely heartwarming ❤️
Now we need Chris Evans reading Thirst Tweet, come on BuzzFeed
just when i thought chris evans couldnt be any hotter 😭😭😭
The best video I’ve ever seen in my life
❤❤❤❤❤
"This is the best interview of my life!."  🥰
Older dogs!!!! Yes, please!!!
we need the uncut version of this
Did I start to cry within a few seconds of the interview? Yes…yes I in fact did
I knew he wouldnt focus 😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
A waterfall of puppies lol 😂
I’m so grateful for his plug on older and adult dogs!!
Christopher Jamal Evans said RETURN OF THE MACK! yessssss!!!
I need Kit Connor and Joe Locke to make this interview together
Yeah chris has an average fat one.
Are they all named Buster???
the boost of serotonin i so desperately needed !!
I don't know who is luckier, these dogs or Evans.  I would say Evans.
🐶🐶🐶🐶
this was a straight attack to the ovaries
Most women watching this thinking "Now if I pretend I'm a puppy and go in there.."  :D
Lol thats crazy he keeps calling them Buster Brown... that's my nickname growing up. My family still calls me it today haha. Buster Brown are 👞 's for those who don't know
I've seen a few of these and I'm pretty sure he is the most genuine dog lover of all of them. This was beautiful.
Quien fuera perrito para comerte a besos 😍🥺 sonreí en toda la entrevista verlo así de feliz es tan lindo 🤤🤭🥰❤️ Yo también amo a los perritos 🥰
He is clearly having the time of his life.
Chris Evans is in puppy heaven I will also be and he is not there to answer questions he is there to play with puppies
Can you please get my husband Ryan Gosling on here please?!
This should be bottled up and sold as antidepressants. Honest to God. I smiled from beginning to end.
The "cute agression" is so real! 🤣🤣🤣🥰🥰
"Scarlet's my girl" IM SCREAMING
Omg i just loved this 😆😆😆😆 he couldnt answer anything 😆😆😆😆😆😆
I’m more shocked that he didn’t adopt any of those dogs than anything
Love that he called every dog Buster Brown
He can kick rocks.
chris almost getting little heart attacks every 2 minutes, and the puppies obviously adore him as much!
Please do the interview with Andrew Garfield

This guy is so amazing... that's how you know someone have a good heart ❤️
95% giggling and playing with puppies 5% interview
~THE BEST INTERVIEW ~
All I want in life is to lovingly lick Chris Evans’ face and have em whisper to me “Hello, sweet man.”😭🤣
This has made my heart melt!!😭😭😭😍😍😍. Thank you for being such a beautiful soul. 🐶🐾🐾🦴🦴🐕
AHHHHHHH
Los comentarios están llenos de mujeres desesperadas 🤦
He just loves them so much. It’s honestly so sweet to see a grown man absolutely speechless and unable to answer because he’s so infatuated with these little fluff balls.
I need a part 2.
best interview ever. and i think we all know that the dark puppy with the red collar is his now.
Put a grown man with puppies and you’ll see the real him
Tengo envidia de unos perritos Chris es tan bello
I think we ALL wanna be the dog in that last clip…😏
My heart jus melted.
I want an uncut version of this.... preferably 60-70 minutes long... Chris doesn't even have to answer questions... Just put him in a little play area with the puppies, the older dogs, and some toys...
putangina sana aso nalang ako
He is SO CUTE!!
They are all beautiful and gorgeous dogs.
aaannddd I just ovulated.
My face hurts from smiling so hard at this.
This just made me so happy 😂❤️🐶
I CAN NOT I SWEAR
His reactions to playing with the puppies are pretty much my reactions to watching him play with the puppies.
we have to rename all of those dogs Buster, it’s our duty
i need a chris evans in my life
They are all beautiful and gorgeous puppies.
Downey The Goat 🐐
i just want him to play with me😩
Chris Evens in every question  **Hi buster hi Pal** So cute😭
I think I’m in love lol 😍
The way he describes the older dogs is incredible. This is why he has been my favorite actor. Such a kind  hearted person. I love how sweet he is with the puppies and older dogs. Chris I probably wouldn't be able to answer the questions either if I was around puppies and dogs.
my heart just melted aye

this is exactly what I imagined when thinking of Chris Evans in a puppy interview. now I just ask that he does this for every promo tour cause I cant get over this 🥰💙
Now do one with Henry Cavill🥰 please!! I’m begging you guys
Precious. It truly does say a lot about a person's character based on how they interact with animals. Loved the moment with the senior dogs.   I adopted an older cat. He and I ended up with a stronger bond than any other cat I had from kitten to adulthood.  (Can't really speak to dogs as I don't have any but I'm 98% that it's a similar experience)
How many did he adopt? 😂
a giant puppy plays with regular sized puppies for 8 minutes straight
Interviewer: Which Toy Story movie is your favorite? Chris: Who cares?! Pixar's people: We're hiring Hemsworth next time. 🤣🤣
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!   "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
Imagine getting Chris evens as your boyfriend:)
Isn't Chris Evans a puppy himself? I mean, come on, he's just adorable too 😆
All of that puppy breath.
one of my favourite puppy interviews hands down
I love that he tells it like it is, they ask him a question and hes like  "who cares, I have puppies in my lap" lol
This is very satisfying, I’m so into Chris Evans and seeing him playing with dogs is too much!! I’m melting right now🫠🫠 also, love how he talks about his friendship with Scarlet
And here I was thinking I couldn’t fall in love with this man even more 😍
"When I was younger ehehhhehehehheh👹👹😻😻😹"
Can he like adopt me or something?
Cute puppies are Captain America only weakness!
He should just adopt Buster straightaway
Best. Interview. Ever.
FINALLY OMG
I don't know who's more adorable the puppies or Chris Evans
This interview is way too adorable. 🥰
I really love how he lost it BEFORE meeting the puppies, just the anticipation was enough for him 😂
Who is the puppy here i am confused
I love how he emphasized adopting older dogs. So many people only have eyes and a heart for puppies.
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
This everything and more, I love how excited he was before the puppies even came in and I love the approach he took with the older dogs, knowing that they have seen some stuff and that you need to built trust with them. He's a beautiful soul.
Omg its happened at last!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
‘Come get it. Come get it.’ - Christopher Jamal Evans  😳
FINALLY
this is the best thing to wake up to
I can't choose who was more adorable: Chris or the puppies...
I can do this all day😍
I’ve never wanted to be a dog this bad😢
This is a PR stunt because chris evens called toy story fans racist. Go figure he would do this but it want work.  Fans still hate you
Life's a little more sweet now
His laugh has a Boston accent
i cried why is he so sweet
I wish I were the dogs😢
FINALLY
8:16 like
I feel uncomfortable seeing this in my YouTube trending fee 🤢
Finally
Every dog in that room left with the name “Buster”
This made my day ❤️❤️❤️
Wonder how Dodger reacted when Chris came home after this 🤣🤣
Ive never been more jealous & envious of a puppy, especially the last one in between his legs😜😜😜
This is it. I can die now
I love that he brought in the senior dogssssssss. I adopted one of my own and he’s such a special little guy 🥹💕
If you look closely in this puppy video, you'll sometimes see Chris Evans appear.
He's so great with 🐕    I respect him a lot for talking about adopting from shelters. The whole friendship and earning their trust is so sweet. I believe that too! What a wholesome guy! Great interview 👍
America's puppass!
Chris: I was expecting a waterfall of puppies Me: Now *that’s* an idea
Chris Evans be like ‘Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself!’😂😂 I mean yeah right😂❤️
how can a human be so fluffy.
Loving how he’s able to produce answers about Scarlett & Dodger lol
crying
Puppy interview? Oh no what’s happening to me-  🚶‍♀️🧎‍♀️🐕
How can you not love this man?? 😍
I love it!
Indeed the BEST interview
I more focus on how Chris Evans interact with the puppies...love it!
I LOVE HIM?!!
Finally!!!
THE IMMENSE JOY I FEEL
5:19 he for sure bought that puppy💀💀
I NEED TOM HIDDLESTON
This is Tom Cruise levels of cringe..  I mean, considering who put this out? Why should I care?
" I am expecting .... Like a... waterfall of puppies" 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️
awwwwww this is soo adorable to watch especially these days
This interview makes the dog lover like me go crazy... I want to take them home...One of the sweetest interview I ever saw...I CAN WATCH THIS ALL DAY !
I can’t stop smiling in the beginning and made my heart melt when he play with the older dogs.
BEST.THING.EVER.  And the best thing about it is how much Chris is enjoying himself - and that is super awesome to see. Thanks for creating that!!!
Internet: broken
his lack of attention to the questions cuz he wants to be present with the puppies, AND they brought senior too 💘 awesome, as it should!!! also the name of the video is littt, cuz he just answerd words appart
I picture Dodger when he gets home just, «I can smell them on you! Have you been cheating?! I need treats to get over this! Lots of them!»
oh FINALLY
This is too cute❤ Would love to see him on Hot Ones too. I bet that would be a fun interview!
chris: i got so caught up in the euphoria of puppies i forgot the interview existed
Dodger must be jealous
When he said “come get it “ 😩 sir I will totally run 🏃🏻‍♀️ towards you.
I love how he calls them all buster this has rejuvenated the deepest parts of my soul
I had a dog that looked just like the white senior. Melts my heart. I'll take all the dogs and the Chris, please.
He doesn't even try, he just wants to play with the puppies. Chris Evans is us xD
Brb changing my name to buster
He genuinely does not care about most of these stupid questions. This man is most likely tired of the same questions about Cap & the MCU. Also, this is exactly how crazy I get around any dogs in general ❤️
My face hurts watching this....😁😆🥰😍
Can i be the dog
The dogs are getting more action than in regards to chris evans. How I wish i was the dog right now kissing his cheek 🥹
🥺🥺🥺😊
The puppies are so adorable and so Chris Evan 😍
It would’ve been perfect if Lizzio just came crawling in and barking
I wish i was a puppy
Obviously this calls for a part 2
Just what I needed today.. Thank you!
Omg this is the most adorable shit ever
A big puppy playing with baby puppies
FINALLLLLYYY
My face is melting now
Half expecting for him to announce he adopted one of them. They’re so cute 😍
finally 😭
If you’re reading this message right now, go outside and touch some grass.
That was absolutely awesome to watch! One of the best interviews EVER [even though I was distracted w/ all the 🐕🐶s]! Going forward, all interviews should include them! 👀😁😂
This world, doesn’t deserve Chris Evans
I don't even need to see them coming in, just liking before I even hit play because I know the cuteness that is going to happen.  BTW, I hope you're not going to see your pup soon. He's going to be so mad at you!
Omg!!! Chris is so sweeeeeettt!!! I love him!!! He’s a great actor and excellent person❤️
YAS!! Thank you Chris for highlighting older dogs up for adoption!
So adorable
this is the cutest thing 😭
heartstopper cast with puppies WHEN ?😊😊🍂🍂🍂
He’s so gentle 🥺💜
F I  N A L L Y
Puppys!
I love how he reassures the dogs, I’ve never wanted to be a dog more in my life🐶😂
Chris Evans' laugh alone could solve all of the world's problems
8:15 I never ever had been so jelous with a dog
Buzzfeed has officially managed to short circuit Chris Evans
8:15 wish i was
That was everything I needed to see and more omg
I think Dodger may have a new sibling!😂
I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE ALIVE
This is the only interview that'll ever matter Period 🤌🏽
Parts two to four or we riot.
🐩
PART TWO!!!!!!!!
A puppy playing with puppies is all I see 😭
i’d like to apply for the role of puppy #5 thank you
Awweeee ❤️❤️❤️❤️
😐I wish I was Chris Evans socks.  He would put me on so gently. 😶‍🌫️..🧦🙏🏾
glad to know other people don't know what to do when so much adorableness hits them either
"thanks for trusting me, Bubba" 😭😭😭😭😭
i. am. ascending.
🧸  🔥🔥🔥 Hey guSy plzzzz Everyone subscribes my channel🥺🔥🔥 🔥
Standard appearance for husband protection~(*๓´╰╯`๓)♡
Hahaha he calls every dog either Buster or Buster Brown. When talking to new dogs, my go-to nicknames are Pupper-Doo, Pupper-Nuppers, or Muffin.
I swear this man gets finer everyday
Funny how all the puppies have the same name <3
This could be the only moment in my life that I wish I was one of these pups
🧸  🔥🔥🔥 Hey guSy plzzzz Everyone subscribes my channel🥺🔥🔥 🔥🐰
i really thought he was gonna say he wishes to be an anime
🧸  🔥🔥🔥 Hey guSy plzzzz Everyone subscribes my channel🥺🔥🔥 🔥🐰
A straight white man on a BuzzFeed video??😱 how did the writers not vomit in disgust on sight? Isn’t that like their thing?
not Chris naming every single dog buster 💀
I was blind, now I see, deaf, now I hear 😋😍🤩😍🤩
Why am I crying
Can i be tht puppy 🐶
The biggest puppy in the world with puppies 😍😍😍😍
He looks, acts, and sounds nothing like a 40 year old which is why i was so surprised when i found out his age
Those lucky, lucky puppies getting to crawl all over him!
It’s so adorable how totally distracted Chris is😅😅❤️
the only puppy video i have been waiting for
Um.. thanks for that! Lol
Horrible shirt but he is all in those puppies 🤣❤️
I’d watch an entire Netflix series with just Chris doing puppy interviews
I LOVE HIM SMM I SWEARRRR
I can't with this interview
I think I can speak for all 1,020,672 of us who have watched this so far when I say we need outtakes of all of the puppy footage.
This is so wholesome 😭😭I have never seen anyone so cute and soooo relaxed in this puppy formate interview, Chris is simply awesome 💕💕made my day
I just can’t take my eyes off him. It’s okay Chris you didn’t have to worry not answering questions at all.🥹❤️
He respects senior dogs, therefore i respect and admire him even more
FINALLY. PUPPY INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS EVANS.
Chris is also just a puppy playing with with a bunch of other puppies. THANK YOU for this Buzzfeed I’ve been waiting for this video since I was born.
Now he needs to do a Sean Evans Hot Ones interview with the hot wings.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all.
Anyone else never wanted to be a puppy more...no just me? 🤣
Part 2 PLEASE
Chris+pupies.... i just can't🥺💗
When he says “guys guys, come on come get it.” #deceased
Oh no what's happening.... 🧍..🚶...🧎.....🦮
ele ñ consegue se concentrar kkkkkkkkkkkkk ps. é a primeira vez que to ouvindo a voz original dele
I've never seen an interview with a celebrity that wants to interact with older dogs (I haven't seen them all) this is so amazing. He's right no better feeling than to know an older dog or cat trusts you.
5:37  "i don't know, what is the question?" ME 😂
4:09  "Hemsworth would probably make me feel bad about myself"  i probably shouldn't have laughed but i did 😂
Oh my god!! 😭😭Probably the most heart melting thing I've ever seen! *LOVE YOU CHRIS EVANS, you're the best!!* ❤️❤️
I love His lough 😂😂❤️❤️
That is the puppies
😁 I couldn't stop smiling watching this. I love  Chris! Our birthday was on Monday!
It's just Chris laughing the whole time
This was GLORIOUS.
He is literally so soft with all these babies and gosh can this man get anymore perfect?
Friggin finally!!!!!!!!!! 💙💙💙💙💙
BuzzFeed is still good for something, it seems.
Him falling to his side and gently whispering "come here" is the biggest tease.
God, this man is literally perfection. 😍😍😍
now bring paul rudd
8:16 same
if chris was a dog he would definitely be a golden retriever
okay now do Chris evans asmr
Better question how does this man only have 1 dog?  Bro u did 2
"Got a scratch pal? Come here i gotchu" AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
Your Videos never fail to entertain us ❤️
I love You Chris Evans 😻
lmao, now THAT is the Boston accent.
Seriously, who disliked it?? Who are those? 😒
This is Chris Evans' HEAVEN
They're probably like he smells like another dog...we like him
Chris Evans saying "look at youuuu“ repeatedly to the puppies while looking himself like a model
Evans w/ adorable pups, equals best vid to drop in a lifetime!
He who has an ear, let him  Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family   God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved   it’s like the days of noah. God sending his servants in love because God loves you to warn you before judgment comes and yes of course human nature   Human beings ignoring God just like the days Noah mockers and scoffers laughing at the preaching of the word  scoffing at the preachers and persecuting those that come in love and share in love   scoffing at the word of God and all this scoffing and mocking even after all that you’ve seen since 2020 and have experienced  Yet everyday life continuing people oblivious to the coming judgement upon this world like the days of noah and ignoring everything that they’ve seen and are seeing   ignoring the fact that there’s a war happening in Ukraine which could potentially lead to nuclear war also ignoring the fact that Israel is about to go to war with Iran and China is about to go to war with Twain   Ignoring the fact that food prices are rising aswell as fuel prices there’s talks of worldwide famines by 2023 new diseases monkeypox after we just had a virus cause havoc on this world for two years and now we have a new one   yet people are choosing to ignore all this signs when the bible told you that this would happen in the last days  A time prophesied by Jesus - a time worser then anything that’s happened  in this world yet you can still be saved out of that time and out of the tribulation and it’s only through Jesus that you can be saved from the wrath to come and from hell and from eternal Separation from God because of you’re sins for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   you’re in the middle of a spiritual warfare light - against -darkness and you have no idea how great or wicked that darkness is nor what that darkness is doing or planning for you   the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to judge this world and to put everything right  God’s will is for all to be saved and for none to perish but time is running out this is not the time to be running away from God but rather to God and for my brothers and sisters in Christ   my fellow Christians don’t play church you’re either with Christ or you’re not beloved. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.  you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  Beloved You have to pick up you’re cross and follow Jesus and deny yourself daily and crucify your flesh daily and be holy because God is holy offer you’re body as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto God beloved strive i repeat strive ! to enter through the narrow gate for many will try but will not be able too   This message is shared out of love to everyone so you can be saved   So Repent and give you’re life to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and saviour and receive forgiveness and salvation through Christ Jesus    Acts 4.12  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved   John 14:6 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me  God bless

I love that they’re all “Buster” to him it’s adorable
7:26 This is for my reference Goo awei
Never wanted to be a dog so badly in my life 😩
I love how he barely answers the questions cuz he’s too distracted by the dogs 😄
He was definitely a Labrador in his previous life😍
I wonder how would dodger react to this. 😊✨
He’s THE BEST dog’s person! Love it so much ❤️
I can't handle the extreme cuteness level of this. I died a lil.
there HAS to be more footage of this interview somewhere right? RLEASE IT ALL, Even if its hours we will watch it!!!
I’ve never wished to be a puppy before 🤔 But watching this…. Yup ❤️
Believe in our Lord and savior Jesus Christ, God born a human, he lived the perfect life we can’t, died on the cross for all people, shedding his perfect blood in full payment forever for all our sins, including yours, as a free gift from God. Then he was buried, and then resurrected back from the dead 3 days later by Father God, to eternal life. Giving all who’d simply believe in him and what he did for us- total forgiveness, a fixed relationship with God, complete salvation from judgement, and eternal life.   Just believe, confess, and trust that Jesus Christ is the Lord and savior of all and accept his sacrifice for our sins, and you too will be saved and baptized in the Holy Spirit. You’re a new creation and Gods adopted child through faith in Jesus Christ, Gods Holy spirit will live inside of you, and he will guide you in all his ways.   There’s nothing you can do to earn heaven or earn right standing with God, or be good enough on your own. It’s Gods free gift to us, he alone gives us forgiveness, new life through Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit to help us. So no one may ever boast before God, and everyones equal.  Read the Bible, always pray to God, and get water baptized as a means of saying thank you, to keep growing closer to God.  May our Father in heaven bless you through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Who is buster

I couldn't help but smile through the whole video <3
So cute
Aren't they all adorable! 😍 Even the white one with black stripes! 💕
I think the worst part about this interview is that he let the puppies lick on his lips like you don’t know where those tongues have been that is so nasty😭
Agent: "You have to play with puppies--" Chris Evans: "Awesome." Agent: "--while you do an interview." Chris Evans: "While I do a what?"
Yessss…return of the mack. He just made my heart explode, again.
Oh to be able to lick chris evans
Chris becoming Melissa McCarthy in Bridesmaids.  “Nine, I took 9.”

Puppies exists: Evans: BUSTERRRRRR
sweetest boy omg
Pretty sure every single person watching this and commenting have just fallen in love with Chris Evans (and if you were in love before, then you’re falling in love all over again). He is so sweet with the dogs especially the older ones who were scared and he was so gentle and patient with them and then thanked them for trusting him 😭😭😭

Get ready for the compilations😭
“scarlet is my girl” i love him so much
How are we not talking about how he called one of the dogs Bubba it was so cute 🥰
The whole interview was hilarious and adorable, and while I loved every single second of it. The top moment was him telling the seniors dogs ‘thanks for trusting me’ 🥲 I need at least 100 more of these videos with Chris 💕
FINALLY
I loved how he brought attention to older dogs 💜
Yeah I cried when he played with the older dogs
All my problems have suddenly disappeared
he’s just so fine omg
"no disrespect to the puppies." - chris evans, 2022
This one was amazing. Now do another one with Tom Hiddleston, so that my soul finds peace :-)
FINALLY
chris evans with puppies has been complete now we need one with sebastian stan
Chris Evans bringing awareness for older dogs melts my heart.
They are so cute
Did not disappoint❤️❤️❤️
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
chris evans the dog whisper..lol so cute.
I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else. Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone.  That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, neglect, cruelty or starvation. That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown. I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of hell ever again. a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. None of us are righteous, perfect or good (any human who claims that is untruthful with you)  we have all sinned before God. Everyday we make mistakes and everyday we sin in word, thought, action and deed, but God loved us so much that he look past our frail human nature and our failures and loved us and wanted to save us anyway despite  the fact we could never be good or righteous on our own merit.  Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever. ''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life'' John 3:16   "This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth"  2 Timothy 3:1-7  ''The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us,  not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance'' 2 Peter 3:9
I wish i met Chris Evans the new heroe of buzz lightyear
TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET PLACED YOUR FAITH IN CHRIST FOR SALVATION. RIGHT NOW YOU CAN STILL BE SPARED THE WRATH TO COME! 7 YEARS OF HORRIFIC JUDGMENT UPON THE EARTH FOR THE REJECTION OF GOD'S PROVISION FOR SALVATION, THROUGH FAITH IN CHRIST, IS ABOUT TO BEGIN! BIBLE PROHECY IS ACCURATE! ALL PROPHECIES HAVE ALREADY BEEN FULFILLED EXCEPT FOR THOSE THAT DEAL WITH THE VERY END OF THE END DAYS! THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AT RIGHT NOW! THE RAPTURE IS IMMINENT, AND ONCE THE LORD REMOVES HIS CHILDREN FROM THE EARTH THE FULFILLMENT OF REVELATION CHAPTERS 6-19 WILL BEGIN SHORTLY AFTER. THEY START ON THE DAY A COVENANT FROM DANIEL 9:27 IS SIGNED. THIS IS A 7 YR PEACE COVENANT BROKERED BY THE SO-CALLED "ANTICHRIST", ONE WHO WILL BE DEMONICALLY EMPOWERED, AND WHO OPENLY SERVES SATAN. THOSE WHO REJECT THE MARK HE WILL OFFER AND THEN MAKE MANDATORY WILL BE BEHEADED ACCORDING TO REVELATION 20:4. PLEASE DON'T WAIT TO PUT YOUR FAITH IN CHRIST. YOU CAN STILL BE SAVED AFTER THE RAPTURE BUT YOU WILL THEN BE LEFT BEHIND TO ENTER THE TRIBULATION AND WILL LOSE YOUR LIFE FOR WAITING TO TURN TO JESUS BECAUSE THE ANTICHRIST WILL MARTYR ALL WHO DO. PLEASE DON'T WAIT. TODAY IS THE DAY OF SALVATION. NONE OF US KNOWS IF WE HAVE TOMORROW!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ugl2...
FINALLY
god i love this man so much.
When he said "Scarlet's my Girl"💖  I melted!
I CANT STAND HOW CUTE THIS IS💕💕💕
Chris evans has the most cutest laugh
One of this puppy interview with Aidan Gallagher ✨❤️
Make one with The Umbrella Academy Cast ☂️🐦🖤
And when the interview was over, he took them ALL home. 😂🤣
This was the best
Thank you Buzzfeed, this  was awesome. Now... Do this with Henry Cavill!!! He also loves dogs. 😍🖤🖤🖤
A big puppy playing with other puppies
Any Filipino who is asked to define "gigil" should just point to this video, because that is absolutely what Chris Evans is experiencing. :-)
He’s so gentle with them.
This man.  If y’all want to give us the full uncut version of this we wouldn’t be mad. If it’s an hour long so be it.
This is my new comfort video❤️❤️
He’s so fineeee
I just want to be his puppy
Chris: scarletts my girl Omgg
I’ve tried watching this interview 3 times now and I’m pretty sure I heard nothing besides him talking to the puppies
8:15 i feel that puppy
I've turned into a puddle of goo, that was too cute 😊😍🥰
Best celebrity interview ever! It really says a lot about a man how they treat animals 😌
i didn’t learn much about him from his answers, but i learned chris evans + puppies is the best combo that could ever exist
Lol he loves dogs you can tell by the love he shows his dog Dodger. The pups can tell this too just look at them ❤️❤️❤️❤️
What an interview! I love Chris and I loved all the puppies! Also, the idea of bringing older puppies 🙌🏻  BEST INTERVIEW I’VE EVER SEEN. Even though some questions didn’t have a proper answer, I just love to see Chris this happy and it really made my day. ❤️‍🩹 This one is now my comfort interview to watch when I’m sad😀
okay now one with henry cavill
so happy to see Chris Evans' dream come true! He's been waiting for this for so long! ❤️ Plus, he's just so sweet
Darling puppies
🥺
😂
😳
😍
❤️
I just adore him & dogs omg perfect combo.
The video we all needed in our lives. Pedro Pascal next!
he should've said "i could do this all day" 🤪🤣
this is literally me if i ever got to do this interview
Too cute, the puppies AND Chris.
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus and obey what He wants you to do with your life or if you don't do this then when you die you will go to hell.
Eventually BuzzFeed had given up asking Chris Evans interview questions and decided to not call it a puppy interview but “Chris Evans plays with puppies.” LMAO
The questions are dollar store generic and completely lack any creative thought what so ever..These are questions that you would hear in every single God damn Hollywood interview and yet if a puppy is involved I am instantly charmed and invested in what I'm watching. Oh, and the dogs are really cute also.
That man is so fine
His laugh 💙
Eu tô apaixonada
This guy is a leftist cuck, no wonder he's on buzzfeed 😂
I LOVEEEE THIS, SO CUTE LITERALLY!!!!! HE IS A AMAZING PERSON
You know how amazing Chris Evans is that even a hoard of cute puppies could not take my eyes off of Chris' face (or his bulging biceps).
Adopt senior cats and dogs! Give them a good final years
petition to make this an annual thing🙌
💕
I think Dodger is going to have a little brother and sister soon.
The amount of times I heard Buster, one of the dogs must now be named Buster
So now I'm sure after a ton of backlash Chris P. Is playing with puppies ??? Too little too late ! The only way to save himself from his asinine statements berating parents for not wanting their children to see movies with LGBT  issues ??? To apologize to those same parents and to also adopt at least 3 of those puppies and help the rest get adopted. He's got enough people he knows he should definitely step up and do something like get them all adopted ! Otherwise Chris go away !
Senior dog part was legit. Seniors deserve love
❤️
this is the type of puppy excitement i appreciate
I just want to gently rub his beard like he’s doing to these pups. Omg!!! While looking into those eyes, sheesh! He is a living DREAM.
Imagine how his dog will react when he comes home 😅
😍
i love him 😭
Ohh my goodness, i have been waiting for this for so long😍
How to make Chris Evans fall in love, bring a puppy, noted lol
Not sure if I gotta Awwww at those puppies or Chris Evans ❤️ Best interview ever for sure 👍🏼
He’s trying to groom the puppies to lick peanut butter off his balls.
"scarlets my girl..." BAAHABSDBJFBEKJWBFJBW CRYING
My doctor told me to watch this video everyday for my health. Thank you. Please.

Why a true dog person cannot do one of these interviews...
https://youtu.be/eW4XAiioVP0
My new favorite interview EVER💖😭😭😭
If you celebrate Disney at this point, then you have issues and should probably be in prison.
Interview? What inter... puppies!
Lucky puppies
Chris is amazing 😭 I'm so glad buzzfeed seemed to just roll with it instead of getting angry when he didn't really answer some questions.
This should be a monthly thing.
hey buzzfeed don't be shy, please give us the full, un-cut version thanks x
I want him to pet and thank me too!😂😍🤣
I see Chris Evans face…. 101% trust activated! 😜

*Agressively clenches fists and jaw because of cuteness overload*   "oh god!"    "GOD!"  Same Chris same.
Question: Chris *LAUGHS*
I watched it twice and still don’t get any answers, cause Chris WITH puppies is too distracting to really listen And I really respect him for asking for older dog as well, they all in need of love
I LOVE HIM
Goodness. He's so adorable for a 41 year old guy. https://youtu.be/KX_7fwvAFbk
My heart ❤️‍🔥
This is the best thing I have ever watched
He's so Bostonian, it's killing me.

I pray to god I’m buster in my next life
at the end of the interview chris stole all of the puppies and took them home
❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️
i think i evaporated  gosh this made me melt into nothingness 🥺  all the dogs are so sweet, and i love the senior dogs too 🫂🫂🫂
I don’t think I ever smiled so much while watching something
THE MOST ADORABLE PUPPY INTERVIEW I HAVE EVER SEEN
What an awesome man! He makes my heart melt so much just to see how caring he is with those animals ❤️
4:47 the "about to go home with all these props" got me😂
Now Sebastian Stan and my life is complete
this might be the greatest video of all time
Him: when I was younger I wanted to be an animator. . .   Me: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! *My inner animator screaming in surprise*
"WHO CAAARES?"
Por qué Chris es el hombre más tierno?
finally. i can die in peace now.
I didn’t think it was possible for me to love this man any more than I already did but here I am 😭🥹🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡 thank you BuzzFeed
idk if chris is lucky on those puppies or those puppies are lucky on chris
my bae
Watching this with the most adoring eyes while I’m aware that I’m scared shitless of animals is so weird but this is so cute
I can't decide who's cuter!
The black and brown puppy thar kept smothering him was clearly a human reincarnated as a dog. That dog was trying to get chose. Lollll.
THANK U
I'd give a million to be one of these puppies XD
Chris Evans and puppies is the the therapy I didn’t know I needed
Finally!! 😂
Legitimately the best interview ever!! I can't even decide which was cuter, Chris or the dogs!!
The way his voice and demeanor changed with the older dogs 😍😭
Chris Evans voted for Joe Biden. Just saying
it‘s the serotonin for me
Oh Chris ❤️
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx0DT17PS50bG_XHqzy9UcA

OMFG WE GOT IT I SAW THIS AND GASPED AND KICKED MY LEGS LIKE A CHILD AND SQUEALED IM SO HAPPY RN
This is what I want to see when I come home 😌😏🤣
All of us low-key wishing we were those puppies rn
Love him even more.  He's so great with the shy puppies (being gentle with them, of course) and super great with the older dogs, letting them come to him and then they began to trust him pretty quickly.  He seems like a genuinely nice man.  ❤
I'm sorry but i wish he'd covered up those arms i am too gay to concentrate 😭😭
Now give us part 2
This is probably the best celebrity interview I've ever seen.
This was the best day of these puppies' lives. They got to play with the giant, man version of a golden retriever.
No superpowers can defend against this form of attack!
He called every single one buster 🤣
The serotonin this video gave me >>>>>>>
He's the perfect himbo, no thoughts, no attention, just puppies😭😭
This is the best interview ever,  anywhere,  by anyone.
Do any of the celebrities adopt any of these puppies after this? Gosh, I would really love to know that! I would walk away with at least two. 😂
🎉you visit the my chanel😔then you helpfull😚😙😚☺️😚☺️☺️🤗☺️☺️😚😙😇😇😇😙plz plz plz
How Chris Evans felt about the puppies is how I feel about him watching this interview, Ugh!! He’s more everything! Sexier, hotter, sweeter!!! Killing me here!!!!! 😭💙💙💙
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I love how he’s so focused and enamored with the puppies that he doesnt even care about the interview questions haha 😂😂. This was a joy to watch😍

Those puppies have licked and climbed CE like many of us wished to do, what a wonderful video

He's so cute esp when he talked to them softly🤩😍

Im obsessed!
My eyes are blessed😍😍😍

He’s so affectionate and humble. He has such an intuitive emotional intelligence.
i love how its just "Chris Evans Plays With Puppies" and the "While Answering Questions" isn't there  they all know we're just here for the puppiesxEvans vibes 😆
Easily the most adorable thing ever. 😍
Dreams really do come true. And in this case, I mean HIS dream of getting interviewed with puppies around came true.  This video is VERY good.
And HERE IT IS
sooo when do we get part 2...
ONLY 8 MINUTES THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH!!!!!!
1:26 Did he actually say "Hi Buster", quoting the second Toy Story movie or am i hallucinating for all the cuteness in the air?
ok but where are the thirst tweets?
Guess I can cancel my therapy appointment next week cause this has cured me of my anxiety, my depression, the PTSD...
Any animal lover is fine in my books.
New comfort Video unlocked 🥰
Give me more !!!
I wanna be a puppy 🥹
HIM CALLING SCARLETT HIS “GIRL” WAS ALL I NEEDED TODAY
Quem achou q no começo ele tava falando em português comenta 🤣
Henry Cavill should be next!!!
Ok now bring Henry Cavill and the holy duo of sexy men playing with puppies will be complete
Chris Evans is not what I thought he was.... Am disappointed fr. If you know Rwanda you must that was inappropriate of him to do what he did. You're fuckin fake
His just having the time of his life
My life is complete. Thank you buzzfeed❤️
Every single dog is now named buster… i cant think of a better name for any of them
this is my new favorite interview 🥺
These give me so much serotonin

chris evans loves to laugh😭😭😭😭
is no one gonna talk about that he said MY GIRL SCARLETT 😩☝🏼
"PUPPERS......assemble"
omg this is the most wholesome thing i've ever seen in my life
Who needs therapy when you can watch Chris Evans playing with puppies for free
Too stunned to speak 🗣🥺
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
ahhhhhhhh omygod!!! the wait is overrrr
Him referring to Scarlett as his girl and his sister makes me melt😭
“Guyyyyysssss” so much serotonin 😭
Best video on the internet today🥲
We need a part 2 with kittens!
I never wanted to be puppies before in my life until i saw this video😭
https://youtu.be/asdpd9U02xA
I'M DROPPING A PETITION FOR PART 2 AND WITH MORE OLDER DOGS 😭😩😭oh gawd Chris Evans is literally a dog's man 😩💖💖
I wish I could turn into a puppy right now , not even kidding.
I’m glad Chris Evans has his priorities in check 🐶
1. Ngl I thought he called Scarlett “garlic” & had to put on the subtitles to check😅 2. I’m genuinely surprised he didn’t walk away with one of them
they're all fighting for his love
You know he's losing it cos his Boston accent is OUT
The way he’s like “I’m about to go home with ALL these props”…… well it’s official. It’s taken me 23 years but I’ve fallen in love with Chris Evans 😭😭😭😭😭
every dog is called Buster. Chris Evans makes the rules
AAAAAAA
his teeth is more immaculate than baby's soul
Truly a masterpiece of an interview
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😍😍
Adopting older dogs can be so worth it <3 I adopted a 3y old Am. Cocker and she turned out to be a fully trained (and certified, which is a law in Belgium), service/alert dog. There is so much love and potential in all those doggo's from the shelter! Also, this interview was wholesome. And all the cute, of the puppies, and Chris of course :D
i wish i was one of those dogs
I just melted like ice cream 😭💞💞💞
We need a Sebastian Stan interview with puppies 🐶
this was 8 minutes of pure serotonin
this is the best thing i've ever watched
Went from "he's so adorable I wanna cry" to "god I wish I was one of those puppies" to forgetting that this was an interview.
Yes finally he gets to do a puppy interview!!!!
Can I join to those dogs? Just for a second 🥺🥲
ok now hear me out : HARRY STYLES
Oh my Gosh! Too Much! Double CUTE!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
90%of him be there is only for puppies, not answering the question
"Let's cast Adam Driver. Let's see what he does."  Kylo Ren playing Captain America? Now I wanna see that lol
Hope one day Richard Armitage will enter this interview. He just adopted a dog 😆
Important question, if the person who's being interviewed want to adopt one of these babies, can they do it? Can they keep them? One or maybe all? ☺️
It is so adorable and heart melting! Especially whenever he said,"Thanks for trusting me." I admire the right man!
I bet Chris gives amazing hugs
How to fall head over heels in love with a man in 8 minutes 44 seconds - Exhibit A: Chris Evans plays with puppies. As if I didn't already adore this man! <3 <3 <3
I didn’t think Tom Holland’s puppy interview could be topped but now I’m not so sure… I think a ‘Chris Evans AND Tom Holland play with puppies’ is needed!!
Love this interview
All my ❤️💕♥️
This video is my therapy
A human golden retriever playing with puppies   *This user Is melted*
And next is Chris Hemsworth 😆
thank you buzzfeed 💛 chris evans is a really sensible and intelligent man and seeing him loosing it while playing with puppies is absolute gold. i also agree with him about adopting senior dogs. dogs have so much love to give, at any age.
omg please i loveeeeee HIM 😭😭😭😭
What's with the disgusting addiction with celebrities?
I just want to hear which one he took home or at least an update that they've been adopted.
Yaaaay
Omg 🥰😍
♥️♥️♥️♥️
WE NEED JAMIE BOWER OR JOE KEERY
this video saved my life.

A puppy playing with puppies 🤔
Best interview ever!
never dreamed of becoming a puppy 😂❤️
I've always loved Chris Evans but today he earned my respect too.... My heart is so full ❤️
I really hope the lightyear movie cut the gay scene,cause dude i wanna watch it,but my country says no
"Scarlett's my girl "
This is the best interview I’ve ever watched in my life😫❤️
Chris Evans❤️❤️❤️
I need one of these every year from now on thanks
I love this man so much i wanna cry
It says “play with puppies” instead of “while answering questions” bc he didn’t even hold back 😍😂
I love you 💜💜
hes the cutest thing ever 🥹
What I wouldn't give to be those puppies right now.
And here i thought i couldn't love him more😭❤
I'm so happy he's finally living his dream xD
I love how he changed his whole demeanor with the senior dogs, absolutely spot on. What a lovely golden retriever therapy dog incarnation he is.
OMG FINALY
Hey Evans if you want another dog I can bark
The fact that I got a Lightyear ad halfway through watching this 💀
A golden retriever meeting puppies 🥺
Now if y'all want to do an Evans part 2 of this, or also have Cavill on I think we'd love to see that. Though I'm pretty sure Dodger and Kal would be hanging up the "Welcome home CHEATER" sign for them
GET LIZZIE OLSEN NOWWWWWW
GET LIZZIE OLSEN TO PLSY WITH PUPPIES
https://youtube.com/channel/UCQpQl7ehrwqvzdU-2G22AkQ
All I could think of was what a great boyfriend he would be for Selena
Chris Evans IS a puppy.
Googles How to be a puppy!
Now we need Henry Cavill to do this interview
Chris Evans, perfect human
Why the hell you are interrupting him with questions?😬😬
“I can do this all day”
😍😍😍
i love him 🥺
This is so wholesome i'm so happy i watched thiiis
Just when you thought it was impossible like Chris Evans more than you already do.
@mr.starkaep Freaking out RN.

I just have the biggest grin on my face during this entire video. I can’t stop giggling😂😂
*is dead
My mom gushes "I don't know which is cuter, Chris or the puppies!"
The most successful unsuccessful interview ever and well overdue! :)
3:01 He's too happy playing with puppies and said who cares a lot, at some point the interviewer decided to give up and asked this question. 😂
I can't with this man ,aarafagggsfhhh
Never in my life have I wished for Chris Evans to stare adoringly into my eyes and call me 'pal', more
effortlessly handsome man
Dodger should also be there to accompany Chris.
5:25 Having a cute aggression attack! 😂 😂😂
Arf arf
This is the best celeb interview with dogs. He's genuinely not interested in questions which is highly understandable
"Hemsworth would make me feel bad abt myself" 😭😭😭
"It wasn't the story I had in my mind but it ended up being the best decision of my life" :')
This is just Chris Evans on puppy-high😅💕
We need 1 hour video
He is coming away with at least 12 of those dogs, I can just see it🤣😊
Best video ever made.
Im willing to die and relive for chris evans
It happened. It finally happened.
Chris Evans doing baby talk to the puppies is 😩
The dogs fighting over Chris would be me
He really is just such a great guy
When they asked "Which of your fellow co-stars have you learned from the most?" I immediately thought of RDJ. That man has been in the game so long and literally been through so much in his career. Such an amazing actor and you better listen when he speaks or you might miss something important.
Chris Evans is the human version of a golden retriever. 💕
Scarlett's my girl ❤
I admitted I closed my eyes just to listen his voice and picture I was with him…alone 😆❤️
I could feel the edits being created and uploaded the second this was uploaded
Stupid Gae Light-year is playing with Puppies
I love how it’s usually “celebrity *whoever* does puppy INTERVIEW” or “plays with puppies WHILE ANSWERING QUESTIONS”. Nope, not Chris Evans. He just  “plays with puppies”.
Oh how I wish he would do thirst tweets 😩
Couldn't decide if I should look at puppies or Chris, My god! cutness overloaded
I got a feeling Chris Evans wanted to adopt Buster so bad..........all of them.
To be that dog 8:16
These guys are so loving that they'd lick Thanos to death.
Yo Buzzfeed! next up is thirst tweets with him.
I love that everyone’s voice is way higher than usually when speaking to a puppy. Even Chris Evans‘ 😂
SO CUTEEEEE I CAN'T
I already want another one 😫
I need a series of these just with Chris Evans in it
My life is now complete
What if sel and him are dating ,j would die right away. So cuteeee
Please do Kit Connor🥹🥹🥹🥹
thank you for your service
Evans is a liberal, hypocrite entitled douchbag
Can't explain how much tears I have shed through out the whole video
watched it, enjoyed it and now i want to be a dog
him +puppies =therapy!
does he want to adopt one? i can bark
FINALLY
😍
I used to respect Chris Evans but not anymore
My fav video. I need an hour long version
This is my new comfort video 😩💗
So sweet 💞
Are we going to ignore the fact that he said ScarJo was like his sister?
my replay button just broke-
Knowing him and the way he adopted Dodger I wouldn’t be surprised if he ended up adopting another dog from this interview. :)
If there's anything that Chris Evans is bad at It doesn't exist
chris evans came just for puppies.. screw interviews !!!! 🤣
find yourself someone that looks at you like chris evans looks at puppies and mARRY THEM
I'm dying 💀 did he literally just say "who cares?" Twice?🤣
Are we not gonna talk about how he didn’t said Mark’s name in the avengers qs😬though I think it was just him casually naming few of them. Loved this interview so much though!❤️
If this was every video you guys made from now on, I wouldn't be mad.
Title should be golden retriever plays with puppies 😂❤️❤️
Chris getting the THEY ARE SO CUTE I COULD DIE urge while playing with the puppies is so relatable it just makes me love him more
8:15 doggy knows what he's doing for sure 😃
Why am I bawling
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying bout is going to be fine and that everyone have a fantastic day!
Please have Chris Meloni next! Let's have a awesome Chris serie!
The puppy with the blue collar better be called scooby
I wanna be the dog at the end😩
I had a dream after watching this interview that Chris Evans and Hemsworth do this interview together and i died in my sleep
❤🤍
Nobody: Chris Evans: “Hey Buster Brown!”
I didn’t think I’d get misty but when he started talking about the older dogs that was so sweet 😭😭
Such grey snouts on them senior pups. Brings tears.
It feels like we, including the interviewer, are disturbing Chris' quality time with the pups alskdjfk
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life42
My 4y/o daughter  (talking about the puppies): “awwww they’re so sweet😍!” Me (32) (talking about Chris Evans): “awwww he’s so sweet😍!”   😂👌🏻
I LOVE HIM i wish im a woman so i have a decimal chance
now we need to get Andrew Garfield on here!
SEBASTIAN STAN MUST DO THIS
Buster or Buster Brown, Bubba and Pal better be the names of 3 of these puppers when they get adopted 😂
I so in love with him
Are all the dogs named Busta...lmao
pls bring sebastian stan !
(in regards to the orange collared puppy) I have literally never been as jealous of another living thing in my life. (And that Boston OMG at 2:33, swoooooooon.)
FINALLY
I'm currently sitting in my car waiting for dinner and I am at a loss... people are walking past, seeing me smile at my phone and wailing... and I don't care.... WHO CARES?! CHRIS EVANS AND PUPPIES!!!!
I just cant believe he cheated on Dodger 😂😂
Oh to be those puppies....     ALSO BEST VIDEO EVER. <3
Finally!
If there is an unedited version that wouldn't get anyone in trouble please post it.  This was a DELIGHT
I've been waiting years for this AaAAAAAAAA😭😭❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bubba 🥺
Who are these people disliking this video and are they allergic to pure cuteness 🤔
My life definitely complete
3:54 ruffalo is crying rn
9 min of him playing around with puppies IS NOT ENOUGH, I REPEAT, NOT ENOUGH!
i am your big fan
This is pure joy!
That's the ultimate interview🥺🥺
I’d like to play with puppies too...his puppies. You know, those little hairy balls🥺🤍
Just the amount of serotonin you need in life 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Chris: don’t take one home, don’t take one home, don’t take ten home
Chris evans with puppies, vidéo I had most waiting for ;)
I can finally rest 🫶🏻
IM SO READT
oh my god was this one of the most adorable interviews i have watched! just seeing chris talk to the puppies/dogs and how his face lights up around them is so endearing
His positive dog energy is off the charts.
I love u chris sagad sa bones
Nothing just a bunch of puppies playing with each other.
💗💗💗
I'm completely thrilled to watch this one💙 how cute they are 🥰
Wait..why isn’t this an hour long?
The puppy interview is finally here everyone’s been waiting for us
Omggg I totally knew he was gonna say he learned the most from Downey honestly their friendship is adorable and wholesome
yes who cares how dare you guys distract him playing with puppies:)
❤️
I swear Chris Evans is the nicest person ever🥹🥹
Chris’s answer to every question: “HI GUYS. HI PAL” 😭❤️
He's not there for the interview, he's rhere for the puppies. As would I :'D
The world needs a longer version of this video and a BTS!
so. much. serotonin.
What a beautiful man, not only outside but inside, he has a big heart and that's even worthy!
Don't Try to Reply me...
SCARLETT’S MY GIRL
Chris calling all the dogs Bubba, Buster, and Pal🥰
The best interview to ever exist!,
this needs to be at least 3x longer
MORE CHRIS AND PUPPIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wish I was a puppy
unedited on the patreon? how much buzzfeed HOW MUCH!
Chris and all the pups & dogs are definitely some sweet creatures 🥹💛 We need part 2!!!
FINALLY
Thank you for showcasing the older dogs as well! 💜
Yes, that is the only way to act in these videos I can't think of any other way
Oh my heart ❤❤❤❤😭😭
Alt. Title A Man Build to Break A Log In Half Who Has the Personality of a Puppy Plays with Puppies.
WE NEED A PART 2!
We need to see him play with 🐍
this might just be the best video ever.
love chris evans. love how he's so sweet towards the older dogs and this entire video made my heart absolutely melt and love chris even more! Lots of love to you, Chris! <3
What a sweet human being 😍
Loving how he used this to highlight older dogs too
Adorable!!
My life's falling apart. But WHO CARES? It's THE INTERVIEW 😭
It’s should be call Chris evans playing with puppies
I never wished i was a puppy this badly before 😍😍
I want to play with his puppy and he can play with mine 👀
He's so fucking hot 🥵 🔥. He's so gentle as well
he did not just say "scarlett's my girl" stop 🥲
Not gonna lie, at the question : what’s one question he wishes he’d get asked during an interview, i thought he’d say that he wishes interviewers would ask if he wants to keep the puppies and the answer would be yes.
I’ve been waiting all week and it did no my disappoint 😍
please do sebastian stannn🙇🏻‍♀️
So, which one did he adopt ? XD
Love that senior dogs are part of this interview. They deserve all the love too ! I adopted two senior dogs (10+ years) and they just melt my heart … ❤️
sksjsjsksjsjsjsk chris i love u so much🫶🏻
HE CAME FOR PUPPIES!!!
How is this only 8 minutes???
Does buzzfeed  rent or own those puppies?
Thank you for giving senior dogs the love they deserve.
My ovaries were not prepared for this.
“scarlett’s my girl, renner would be trouble, downey would be a lot of fun, hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself” poor mark 😭😭
Chris fighting off the cute aggression is hilarious and very relatable
OMFG I can't handle this much cuteness 🥰 We have waited for this for years and it's finally happening, Chris Evans with Puppies 😍 Love him 💙
FINALLY
I really have to watch again to understand the questions.. I could only smile watching Chris and doggies.
Me thinking they’re all named Buster lol he’s so dang sweet with all the dogs it’s easy to see why he’s beloved by everyone, humans and non-humans alike.
I like to believe that his feet really stink, or he snores a lot, or has the worst taste in music. Otherwise he’s fucking perfect.
Didn't Melissa Benoist do an interview surrounded by puppies just like this one?????????
I'll show you my puppies Chris. You can have my waterfall.. of puppies.
Who thinks Dodger might be getting a sibling. 😂
Hello Mr. Evans,  I can bark too 🙋‍♀️😂
When Chris Evans at home Dodger: "are you cheating?"
This is exactly how I imagined this interview would go 😍
Did yall notice when talking to senior dogs, after saying "Let's build some trust", he lay down in a position as a dog would that exposes their belly. This guy knows what he is doing💕
Such a wonderful guy 🥺
my love for him just increased ×10
Chris Evans from now on: I don’t want to do an interview unless it involves dogs.
what is happening to me…👤🙇‍♂️🐕🐕 bark bark
“Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself” loool the man is literally a god irl too and everyone knows it
I want him so bad sorrryyyyyyy
Now get Miles Teller to do the thirst tweets and I'm cured of everything
I wonder how the editor felt when they had to edit this, just Chris Evans and dogs...honestly I'd go haywire 😭
This is what was missing from my life.
he is just too pure i cant
Jesus loves you so much repent before it’s to late:)))
I am  here for Chris AND for the puppies. It's pure heaven.
I love you
I didn't think I could be anymore in love with this man but here we are.
God I want to be a puppy in my next life 😭
My husband❤️
scarlett’s my girl- chris evans  😭🫶my romangere heart
Perfect perfect perfect perfect❣️
Now bring him for thirst tweets.
Yesterday I was thinking why don't they do this with Chris Evans and here it is ..
When he said return of the Mack that when I knew Chris evans was black lol
I have watched it 1000 times with smile ear to ear.. you are no way from this generation #chrisevans, the level of patience, calmness, so much love to give, I do not see in any human these days😭😭💙💙
Oh no- what’s- happening 🧍🏻‍♀️- to 🧎🏻‍♀️- me 🐶
“What was your reaction to getting casted as Buzz Lightyear?”  “WHO CARES”
I NEED PART 2 3 AND 4 OF THIS VIDEO
Thank you for existing Chris Evans.
By my count, Chris Evans said “hi” to the puppies 46 times. I don’t know why I do this
Barely answered the questions, we need a part two. And it's not because I wanna see him play with puppies again...
This guy is defination of Handsome.
Best interview ever !
I love seeing Chris having a hard time multitasking between answering the questions and bonding with the dogs ❤ he really is such a sweet guy
WHY IS HE SO PRECIOUS?!?!?!?!
I want to be those dogs so badly 😅
This is happiness ❤️
I loved this this interview ❤️
I taught he's doctor mike 😅
I can tell the question Chris wants to be asked in an interview is "Would you like to play with MORE puppies?"
Looks like Evans smoked a joint before doing this interview.
This makes me so happy 😄
So many dumb broads caught in the celeb thirst trap by a normal looking dude because their dude at home right now looks literally homeless.
03:35 "this is the best interview of my life" oh sweetheart, is the best interview of everybody's life😍😍
chris evans did the puppy interview the world is healing
Expectations exceeded. This man was trippin on puppies.
"Return of the Mac" 👍 good ass song
OMGGG 🥹🫶🏻 Most awaited video!
Let Kit and Joe play with puppies!
They've finally heard the fandom!!
he's take all those cuties home.
Tom Hiddleston plays with puppies or... Tom Hardy. He loves puppies.
What is it called ? Sweetness aggression? Lol that’s what he was having
I had surgery on my elbow this morning, and all I  could think about was how this video was coming out today! This made me feel a lot better 😌
I'm not on the internet to be tortured, okay Buzzfeed????  GOD best interview ever
Hear me out BuzzFeed. I NEED you to invite Joseph Quinn to do a puppy interview by himself and you better give him so many puppies that he is drowning in them. We didn't see him play with a SINGLE puppy in his interview with the st cast. That's all. Thank you for your time. 😌
Worth it.
How? How was it possible he became more attractive?
This was everything I thought it would be and more! Please tell me Chris went home with a brother or sister for Dodger!?
I feel bad that he didn't mention Ruffalo when talking about which avenger he would be handcuffed with 😭
❤
did he try and destroy us
This is my new comfort video
This dude doesnt age . He is a wine in human disguise .
Normally I highly appreciate editing but this video did not need any cuts. 😍🥰  Yes to adopting AARP puppers! 🙌
how can this video ever end
well I guess the series is over bc there's no one on this planet who can top chris evans doing a puppy/senior dog interview. When's part 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.....
Those puppies are so lucky 😶
We’re not worthy 🙌 what a guy 😍
Finally … the most soulful episode I have seen .. I am damn sure many of us were waiting for this episode with Chris .. such a mood 😊🥰
Chris Evans playing with puppies and senior dogs could end wars and save lives. I'll be watching this video everyday from now on
"Who cares" lmao🤣 love this puppy interview
THIRST TWEETS NEXT PLEASE
His laugh 🥺
All my favourites in a video
The fact that buzzfeed has to kill these dogs after they play with celebrities is so sad! Never looked at these interviews the same after learning that
FINALLY ✨✨✨
didn’t expect this personality from chris 😭😩
Omg after soo many requests 😭💫😂
8:16 me as a dog
when he said “let’s cast adam driver” my heart exploded because chris & adam are my two faves 🫶🏻🥹
Henry Cavill should be the next
Part two, immediately. And a part 3 and so on. Also with kittens
I’m that peeing dog. Sorry my bussy wet yall!
I don't know what to smile at. Chris Evans The Puppies  Or Chirs' Giggles......
Use me as the “we want a part two” button.
I feel like the Adam Driver response is hilariously overlooked
do one with chris hemsworth
I was going to make #releasethechrisevanspuppyinterview trend, it's taken so long for this to come out but thank God!!! OMFG LET ME DIE!
I don't know how many other celebrities have brought in older dogs for these interviews, but I'm so so glad Chris did. How nice of him and how special!
Love he calls every puppy Buster😍🐶
Camera man: :( I wanted to play with puppies   Boss: u a grown man :0  Camera: then he grown up how he get to have puppies play with him :0  Boss: cause hes a master on this earth with a cool hobby  Camerman: hold my camera for 3 years brb
A DREAM COME TRUE, thank you buzzfeed 🥺
I LOVE the senior dogs feature.  I adopted a senior girl two weeks ago as a friend for my wonderful technically still a puppy and she's been pretty cool. We didn't find out about her age until the day the shelter had her ready to go home, but we took the chance on a senior and I'm glad we did!   I agree about the wanting to learn their story. My Natasha (She's part boxer, which I'm pretty sure Dodger is!)  has clearly been through some shit, and it feels amazing when she wants to sit by my feet or puts her head on me.
Waited for this so long
I wonder how long this take  I would just Imagen him playing with the puppies and forgetting to answer the question 🤣
FINALLY ITS HERE
<3
Somehow but I am getting homelander vibes from Chris Evans , it kinda interesting to imagine him  in the role of homelander.
:D
Wish I was one of those puppies
Woke joke..
This
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
this is the cutest shit i’ve EVER seen
Sweet Jesus he's so cute and adorable, just i cant.
Chris Evens like a child with muscles and bushy beard when puppies got introduced.
As a Chris Evans and Hamilton fan in must say it… I wanna be in the room were it happened!
Sweetest interview ever ☺️
WE! NEED! A! PART! 2!  PLEASE BUZZFEED
Thank you so much. Waited for this for a long long time.  I'm in love with Chris all over again.
absolutely no one:  chris: *"BUSTER! 😍😍"*
Chris: ✨ who cares ✨
I love how he's giving small answers for every question bc he's so distracted by the puppies 😂 Normally he says a lot in interviews
PART TWO BUZZFEED!! HE DESERVES A PART TWO, SAME AS TOM HOLLAND DID!!
I would die for this man. (And those puppies)
This video just made my *YEAR*
The last puppy is me!!!
I never wanted to be a puppy so bad.
I think I have accounted for more than half of these views. And I have no regrets.
I LOVE YOU! 😍🥰
i know the feeling of seeing a dog so cute you kinda just wanna choke it like uuughhh how dare you be so cute!!!
The fact that they actually hear the question and answer them is so strange..  If I was them, I would be so concentrate to the puppies, I wouldn't even hear them.
My hormones are off the charts
The fact that he had them bring senior dogs cause they deserve love too 🥺 and the puppies kissing his face ❤️
brb punching metal walls to get over this. tom hiddleston next please!!
chris definitely went home with the blue collared puppy…right?
it's the laugh for me
That's so cute! My name is now puppy though
I had to see this twice  But literally this is soooooo cuuutteee. Luv puppies. Luv Chris. My day is made ❤️
Well i can bark too🙂
FINALLY OH MY GOSH

I hope they did a headcount before and after Chris left😂
pedro pascal plays with puppies PLEASE
I want to cry of happiness and the puppies, they are so sweet 😭 I can't handle this...
I'm so disgustingly down bad for this man
I'm so happy he finally got to do this🥺
Never clicked so fast on a video
Chris Evans + puppies = the best thing ever!😄❤️✨
Love how the title is just "Chris Evans playing with puppies" that's it full stop.
I want someone to treat me like the way Chris Evans treats the puppies
Awuuu😍
Makes me want to be a puppy and give Chris a lot of licks 🤤🤪
This man's so adorable I'm gonna dye 🥲😭 the way he looks at those dogs made my heart melt omg 😭😭😭
his puppy voice is so damn cute
I wanna be a puppy for sure he smelt phenomenal
i’m actually crying
Owners to their dogs: Okay boy, Lay down! Chris Evans: *Lays down before saying hi to puppies  This dude is Retriever
Soooooo cute!!! Between this and the one with Tom Hardy - you know both these men truly love dogs.
this makes my ovaries wanna explode I'm so in love with this man stg
8:17 dog says, "i've have been hearing about your sweet ass all day.  Let me get a sniff."
The way he starts laughing in the middle of a question while playing with the puppies 😂🤣 and the "who cares?" Is classic 😎🤣
THIS VIDEO HEALED MY DEPRESSION AND ADDED 50 YEARS ON MY LIFE.
Next, thirst tweet with puppies when????
Now I feel like I can have peace in my life ❤
Omg this interview is everything I wanted it to be. 15/10 the content I want 😍😍😍😍
He is puppy high!ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
This is so cute.

Llore
Chris Evans? Puppies? Take my money, my house, I don’t care. This completes my life.
WHY ISNT THIS VIDEO LONGER???? 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
It's day 8 for our BORi since she is adopted, not easy! She is so energetic. Is this normal? She will be 3 months old on 20th June. Everybody is welcome to visit her and give advise. Thanks! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEfki7DZ8qmH3Aq8VeWOUS8ZbMy61Z0vR
He's so distracted that he couldn't focus on the questions 😂😂😂
OMG I WAITED SOOOO MUCH FOR THIS AND HERE IT IS!!! THE BEST PUPPY INTERVIEW OF ALL THE TIME!!! Can someone PLEASE make a gif of the 1:49 moment? Is the reaction for me hahahaha how can he be so hot and sweet at the same time?
The only important question in an interview like this is WHO'S A GOOD BOY??
Where's my interview?
“Let’s build some trust” CHRIS 🥺
I love the way he changed his tone from playful and excited to calm when switching from puppies to senior dogs. We need a part 2.
this just solved 99 problems in my life
puppy interviews look way easier than going on Hot Ones.
I mean he like a puppy himself. So fricken cute. God must have munching been on marshmallows and gummie bears when he made Chris Evans omg🥰😍😍.
just cancelled my therapy sessions for the rest of the year
Serotonin level just went UPPPPPP ya'll im telling ya. IT'S FINALLY HERE- we've been blessed, aaahhh give us a part two ALREADY
Omg he’s adorable and so are the dogs. Thank you Buzzfeed for this wholesome video
8:15 he just like me fr
Being someone who loves dogs and is also a Chris Evans fan you can't get no better than this.
I could watch Chris playing with puppies for hours, it’s so cute!! I love that he had some older dogs come in to!
what can i call you
I don't think I will ever recover from this video 😍😵
Dodger's probably at home with a "welcome home cheater" banner
I wish I was a puppy
Best interview ever!!! Puppies and Evans is the perfect combination!
I wish I was a puppy so he could play with me 😏😏😏
This video alone could pull me out of a depression
melt, cant even. i would respond the same LOL an animator or an imagineer?
Quien fuera  perrito para subirse le  a Chris!.
my heart exploded
FINALLY, WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THIS VIDEO
Not Chris calling every dog "Buster" lol.
Finally! dude's been asking for it for years
he’s so good with them
FINALLYYYYY
well, internet....you got what you asked for.
THIS INTERVIEW IS GOLD!
He's so puree 😍
I respected Chris especially ppl vouching for him as one of the nicest person they meet but I have a new found respect for him for not doing the baby voice or baby talk when interacting with dogs. Let's just say it's my pet peeve. That drives me insane
the puppy that peed in front of Chris, same... same
We need an uncut version asap!
oh god my cheeks hurts now from smiling too much
The absolute joy on his face! God I love this man so much.
Buzzfeed how dare you give us 8:45 of content. I need at least 3 hours!
I LOVE THIS MAN SM
Yesssss 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 finally ❤️❤️❤️
my two favorite things
I need like 20 mores like this❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️ like they’re actors that have like 3 of this so give my man what he deserves
Is there any celebrity that ended up taking one of the dogs after the interview?
I love him even more 💕
raw footage from all cameras, now. NOW.
9 hours Chris evans ago vs 9 days MGK ago
3:27 the little squeeze IM DEAD🫠🥹❤️

Genuinely the best 8:45 minutes of my life and I couldn't get enough!!!!! I NEED MORE OF THISSS
this video makes my serotonin 📈📈📈📈
Chris Evans and Puppies = I think this is what heaven looks like
thank you
How do you expect him to answer the questions when he’s actually part golden retriever?
BEST PUPPY INTERVIEW EVER .
i didn’t learn much about him from his answers, but i learned chris evans + puppies is the best combo that could ever exist
this is so chaotic lmao I love him so much
❤️❤️❤️
I bet this show was pitched as "the exact opposite of hot ones"
Am I the only one super jealous of these puppies 😍😍😍... He is just a cutie ❤💞
I love this so much 😭❤️
😍🧡😍🧡😍🧡😍
A devilishly handsome man plus puppies equals wholesomeness
I wasn't ready, i'm melting like an ice. Please how can this man be so damn cute
Idk if I wanna be Chris in this situation, or the puppies
i love that it doesn't even have "while answering fan questions" in the title cuz all he did was play with dogs lmao
definition of a man right there
BuzzFeed!! Please make him read thirst tweets as well  We need that video!!!!
this is now my new favorite video ever😊
Disney's puppy playing with other puppies...
Oh Chris Evans 🤍🤍
The way chris evans laughs really makes my day 😂😂
WE NEED SEBASTIAN STAN NEXT 💥💳
Let me text Lizzo real quick.
Ethan Hawke with puppies too! 😃
I need Oscar Isaac with puppies 🥰
Awww so cute ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love Chris Evans with all my heart ....sorry hubby ♥️
I can surely say that 99 of my 100 problems are gonna be cured because of this video 😭💗
This is one of the best thing that happened in YT. Hahahahaha! ❣️
He's so sweet, I can't with this man, thanks for make this non interview happened hahaha
His laugh haha ❤️
could not stop smiling throughout this interview
i love that they didn't even try to name it "interview" just enjoy 9 minutes of chris playing with puppies 🥰
okay this man is fucking perfect, im so gay for him 😩😩😩
How's he single?
He is not aging too well and the ethnicity is coming right back.
the title is just "chris evans plays with puppies" HAHAHAHHAHAH
Chris 😍😍
YYAAAYYY FINALLY HAHAHAHA
Buzzfeed doing God's work
Chris is a very special guy 🙂
"I'm about to go home with all these props." *points to every puppy* Cuteness overload!
Scarlett's your girl 😍😍
And at the end of the interview Chris adopted all the puppies to take home with him and add to his and Dodger's little family haha 😆
#NotMyBuzz
it’s finally here😩😌
I wish I was that little puppy at the end!
They should have Chris and Tom do an interview together with puppies. It would be so cute 🥰 absolutely nothing would get done but it would be cute 🥰
This video has my heart!
I need 24h of this interview
Tudo que eu precisava, Chris Evans+cachorrinhos.
Buzzfeed you better give us a part two when The Gray Man comes out.
i think i can speak on the behalf of everyone when i say this video isnt long enough!!
8:15 I can see the Twitter memes already
Chris evans waiting years to be asked to do this interview and then just not cating about a single question is the best thing ever
This is getting weird bruh
Chris Evans laugh is the sustenance of life ✨
Obviously I'm not famous so I couldn't never do this interview anyways but if I was famous and i still could never do this interview bc I'd want to keep all the puppies and would 10000000% try to adopt all of them
¿No les pasa que ✨Who cares?✨? 😍😍😍🤤🤤🤤
I’VE LITERALLY BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO FOR YEATS
this about to top buzzfeed’s greatest hits
He looks a lot like Dr mike
Just got out of a surgery… I needed this.
the long awaited interview!!! i dont remember any of the questions lmao
Iam so jealous of those puppies right now 😭🤣
He has “cute aggression!”
This is how I’d react to being surrounded by pups. The nicknames come pouring out: from buster to buster brown. Lol just adorable.
Im just mesmerized by his beauty
I wish i could be one of those puppies 😢😢😢😞😞😞😞❤❤❤💕💕💕
This is me
Like this goes beyond objectifying. Not only does this man have the audacity to be a stone cold fox, but he's also super sweet, funny, talented, intelligent, and kind. This is the kind of man we need to put up on a pedestal!
8:16 who wouldn’t 😂
He is high on puppies💙
Que ganas de ser un perrito
“Buster” every time he said it I thought Rhymes? Keaton? Buster from Arthur? Adorable man. Good human.
oh my god this man is so cute ❤️🌷
As expected he didn't answer any of the questions😭😭❤...his typical answer "who cares"😭❤😂😂
WE NEED MOREE
My heart, uterus, and ovaries were not ready! 😭😍
I NEED EVERYONE OF THOSE PUPPYS
FINALLY OUT YESSSS UGHHH
I'll probably be watching this video at least once a day to smile. A true dog lover just melts and turns into a kid again around puppies. Senior dogs have a special place in my heart. We got our dog when she was already grown too, this made me miss her! I look forward to when I can rescue another dog again!
dodger must be jealous of buster brown rn...
THESE WERE THE BEST 8 MINUTES 45 SECONDS OF MY LIFE ✨ THE FACT THAT HE LET THEM BRING SENIOR DOGS- SO WHOLESOME 😭❤️
This is the best video I’ve ever seen in my entire life.
I wish I was one of the puppy...
Puppies can identify a kind , empathetic soul !! Mr. Evans is one !!
yup I’d watch it for hours
BRUV U PEOPLE ANSwerD OUR PRAYERS....BUZZFEED I LOVE U 😭💖💖
OMG Chris Evans forgot how to speak but also me
Nunca en mi vida quise tanto ser un perro
I wish I was buster
Been waiting for this one
FUCKING FINALLY
Best puppy video in history.
I have a feeling he does more than just play with those puppies
nanghihina po ako
Well marvel is his signature wherever he goes his all around with marvel question
So cute, what kind of puppies are these? They are so cute
2 things I love Chris Evan's and puppies
Yassss finally!!! I've been waiting for this!
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS. I NEED MORE
Naaaah he is ruining my life. I'm never going to find anyone because NO ONE can beat Chris Evans. Thanking the dogs for trusting him? HOW DARE YOU
I’m that last pup 🫠🫠🫠
the best thing I've seen all day
And when none of them are actually named Buster.. 😭🤚
IN BUZZFEED WE TRUST
I can't see him without thinking about it. ANd I much prefer him as a blond.
FINALLY! I’ve been waiting forever to see Chris do this interview
to be one of those puppies
Awww ! I was waiting for this interview since he posted about this in twitter. Finally it got released. 😭♥️
FINALLY!!! 😭😭🥺😍💕💕💕💕💕
Cuties ♥️😘
This is the only reason the internet should exist. :)
This is everything I knew I needed and knew it would be. Be still my heart!🫠🥰
The dogs can even distract him from questions about Dodger.
i’m so glad they brought awareness towards senior dogs not being given as much love as puppies. if you ever consider adopting a dog, please know there are older dogs who are in need of caring as well :)
Wasn't long enough!
Chris Evans is the picture definition of "cute aggression"
ITS OUT 🥹🥹
i litterally love him
a puppy with puppies
I just know this is going to be my comfort video for the next ten years.
The questions were awful.   We are here for chris evans and puppies interaction
yes the best breed is rescue!!
99% playing with the puppies, 1% answering questions.
I couldn’t have asked for a better birthday present!
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
No one can resist the cuteness of puppies  😭
BRO I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS😭😭😭
when he said Scarlett is her girl 🥺
So Chris has 20 dogs now, right? 😂  ❤️
1:05 Exactly
Jon Bernthal and some pitties have to be next, right???
Que homem lindo da porra! Misericordia! Lindo demais.
Who is cuter? Can't decide 😭😭😭
This is what we've waited for awwww
That was the cutest thing ever! I love Chris Evans, he's so funny. Reminds me of one of my friends. PLEASE can you get Scarlett Johansson to do a puppy interview! That would be absolutely AMAZING! Love this!
The puppies, the older dogs, Chris's laugh, "Who cares?"... Everything about this interview is perfect. Thanks 💙
Chris was on the spot with the senior dogs treatment. I’m about to become a dog trainer, i dog sit and have read extensively about dog psychology and behavior. This is how you treat older dogs who already have boundaries, and knowing these came from a shelter makes it even more impressive as they choose who they approach based on their energy and the way the human behaves. My literal dream man right there.
we need at least 1 hour Chris Evans and Puppies interview!! what is 8mins?? 😇
Id very much like to wife this man up
He now needs to get on Hot Ones
Captain: I can do this all day. Me:I know. But he can Puppies show up Captain: Holly shit! Don't kill me with that sweety puppies.
YEAHH CHRIS EVANS W DOGS ALL AGE THANKS BUZZFEED THIS IS SO CUTE ITS SAVING ME 💗
Has Lizzo seen this?
Tom Hiddleston next please 🥺
my dream is to become a dog
Turns out my greatest want in life is for Chris Evans to rub my belly and call me “Buster”
The amount of times this made me smile is really something
puppies are not the only thing i want him to play with, if u know what i mean 👀
I fucking love how he could give absolutely no shits about the interview or the questions and is only there to play with puppies...which...same
This was so adorable to watch! Thank you for sharing. If your reading this I hope you have a great day and know. “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NIV
I love that’s he is just enjoying his time
FINALLY WHAT WE WERE WAITING FOR
I love that his tone changes depending on the cute pups, older or younger!?!?! 💜
I wish I was one of those puppies. I need some TLC from Chris Evans 😭❤️
Who cares!🤭 this interview is the best!! 🥺❤ soo sweet!! It's not an interview video it's a Therapy video❤
BROOOO
Of course he asked for some older dogs because that's just top tier dog lover right there
Best parts of the interview : "Who cares? "😂 "Scarlett's my girl! "😍 "Thanks for trusting me.."🥺
Chris,do you know you're Selena Gomez's man?
We asked. Buzzfeed delivered.
I know EXACTLY what question I WOULD LIKE to ask Chris Evans! And it is “WILL YOU MARRY ME!?” 💜😊🤣😆❤️ Come on tell me I am not the only one!!!!!
I can *feel* the cuteness aggression radiating off of him.
I wanna be one of those puppies, then Chris would pet me and hold me, and talk cute to me. 😂
couldn’t stop smiling through the whole video🤧
Well.  My life is complete.
my life is complete
The puppy at the end knew exactly what he was doing! 😜
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!! WE NEED MORE PLEASE 💙💙💙💙🥺🥺🥺
How is he single?!?
I wish I was one of those puppies
FINALLY, OUR PRAYERS HAD BEEN ANSWERED
I love how he doesn't even look away from the puppies and just says a random answer every time
NOW DO THIRST TWEETS
My heart, shit, my HEART
Now we all Chris Evans fans can die peacefully ❤️😩
A message to Chris Evans- I can bark
Omg it finally happened!!!
The little “excuse you” 🥺😳
Guys I thought I could move in but I think I’m more in love with Chris than ever
When I tell y'all I clicked on this video so fast
Dogs are God's gift to humans ❤️❤️🙏🙏
This is too much. I am dying of happiness
Happiness is contagious. Can't stop smiling while watching this
this was the best thing i have ever seen
Wish I was one of those puppies…I would love to cuddle with CE 🥰😘😘😘
I think it’s so funny that every question he answered he talked in a baby voice
What heaven on Earth looks like
How many times did you watch this?  Me: YES 😍🥰
i love how every dog is buster, and occasionally buster brown.  adorable
Buster was the name of Andys dog in the Toy Story movies.   Loki wore the Captain America costume in Thor: Dark World.
APPRECIATE CHRIS EVANS!! HE IS THE NICEST HUMAN!+ HUMBLE, AMAZING ACTOR! FULL PACKAGE ♡
ELIZABETH OLSEN PUPPY INTERVIEW!!!🐶🐶🐶  (update) ....  IT HAPPEND!!!! IT WAS SO CHAOTIC!!!😂🐶💖
ITS ABT TIME
Plissss plissss  translate español plisss 🙏🥺🥺
"Thank you for trusting me baba" 🥺
As if I couldn't love him more. He's so good with the senior pups that don't necessarily trust easily. Melt my heart. What a good person with a lovely heart ❤
"Scarlett's my girl" hes just the best friend everybody wants
Changing my name to Buster Brown now ✍🏽
Is my heart okay..No! THE CUTEST VIDEO ON 🌎!!♡
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I like to think that there’s just a specific room for the puppies
I need the full b roll from this interview . My mental health needs it

I am not okay

Oh no, what is happening, I-…🚶🏻‍♀️🧎🏻‍♀️🐕
I’m so glad that some older dogs were brought out too 🥹 thank you Chris Evans & Buzzfeed for highlighting the fact that older dogs need loving homes as well 🙏( also adopt don’t shop)💓 (and of course the puppies are adorable as well)
i love how he called almost all of those dogs buster or bubby lol, this video gave me so much serotonin
Every 5 minutes grimacing in pain from the cuteness 🤣 very relatable
You know he tried to walk out with them at some point omg
I think he adopted at least one of those dogs. 💖
"what did you do at work today"  "uh I watched chris evans play with puppies"
i’m convinced nobody can keep a normal voice when talking to puppies
Chris is a little grey hair on his beard😭😭😭. He is still really REALLY HOT🥰🥰🥰!!!!!!!!!!!
ive been waiting for this video to be made for years
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 this whole interview is the best this to ever exit, but can we plz plz plz get the og version of it I'm sorry but 8:45 is just not enough I want more I NEED more  😢
I’ve never seen that many puppies play with a talking puppy with biceps 😭😭😭😭 my heart is melted
What a man ❤❤ love you so much, Chris
I WANTED TO BE ONE OF THOSE DOGS SO BAD 🐶🥹😭🤍  This is what I envision heaven to be like: Chris Evans and a bunch of doggies 🥹😍🫶🏻  also, loving that he’s got some greys in his beard 😍 and what he said about senior dogs, my heart 🤍😭
I smiled throughout the whole interview. Those lucky puppies😊😊

Christopher Robert Evans ...🥰❤❤🥰

Give him the waterfall of puppies😭😭😭
But how many did he go home with?
I could be his puppy.
No one came for the questions i'm certain 😂😂
This man is so attractive, h0ly fvck

The puppy at the end!!!! I mean sameeeeee HAHHAHA
Who was smiling the whole time watching this 😍
Do ppl really support his other movies other than marvel stuff? I see ppl hyped him so much on twitter but not his movies that isnt CA.
My favorite Avenger
immaculate title
A man a dog trusts is a man you can trust ❤
Omgeee I needed this lol 🥹❤️❤️❤️❤️. I was cheesing so hard lolll
Ahh this guy is just the best!! Chris Evan's thank you for your love for animals but especially the seniors.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for this, Buzzfeed.🥹 This video makes me love Chris Evans more.❤️
This interview warmed my heart 🥹
chris evans and puppies>>>
I’m so happy he finally got his dream to have this interview lol❤
Enough with the avengers questions
Im not sure who's cuter, chris evans or the puppies 🤭
The scuse you sent me
this is the best video I've ever watched
I wish I were that dog
This is me with all animals. Hi baby, hi buddy, you guys!, hi, hi, hi, hi pal, look at you!
So much Boston accent on display here! Love it
Ohmygoodness this is the best interview ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Idk why but this dude always comes off as a bit fake, to me.. Like this is all a persona he puts on. I hope Im wrong.
I’ve overdosed on cuteness 😵
so freaking cute I LOVE IT
I will be watching this video for the rest of my life🥰😭
Finally and it’s him getting distracted by the dogs for me
The last dog will be wanted by all dog lover for sure
Dodger is about to gain a sibling
‘Come get it’ 🙂
“No disrespect to the puppies” excuse me I’ll be crying in the bathroom
7:00
This is so sweet 🥺😻💔💕
There he is.....the man guilty of my unreachable standards
Omg, they finally got him on here
I think I just died of cuteness
No one: Chris: ”buster” “BUSTER!” “come here, buster :)”
aww they was really loving on him
My only complain is the interview was too short! Lol
Where are the behind the scenes? The deleted scenes?? I would like every second of this interview
we were waiting for this! 🤍
watching this with my 4 year old doggie next to me. He literally made me love him-
I legit cried when he said “thank you for trusting me”. 🥹 And we’re gonna need an update on how many he brought home with him. ❤️
Johnny depp and JD need to do one of these
5:30 he's not hot because he's hot he's hot because he's so caring. and real.
This is the cutest interview ever oh my goshhhh. Just so heartwarming and endearing!! I loved how he treated both the puppies and older dogs with such care. His energy is so warm and kind. I was smiling the entire time
thank you for your service
what were the questions?
Chris could play with this kitty cat next ;)
I can only imagine the people on that room couldn’t focus on the questions either, what a sight
I’d probably also pee a little if I got to hang out with Chris Evans I won’t lie.
The way he is with the older dogs though melted my heart 🥹
Best interview! 😍 in love with puppies and chris 💜
Ohhhh the amount of people wishing they we’re one of those puppies. That includes me 🤣
Thank you so much for featuring senior dogs. My baby is a senior, and I am so blessed to have him. I got him at 11(?) and that was in 2019. I cherish every day with him, and all we do all day is veg out and snuggle. 🥰
How to watch full interview?🤔
Does Chris Evans need another dog i Can barl
This was worth the wait
Oh my gawd ahahahah, best one yet.
"scarlett is my girl" I CANTTT
No because i wish I was the last dog 😪
Damn I love this man. And with puppies?!!!!! 💍
Miss you as Cap
This video got me pregnant 🤰🏼
I think Buster chose Chris as his human...I hope Chris adopts him
The Boston accent out in full force
Chris so does not care about the questions whatsoever LOL. Puppies, all puppies, all the time.
I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!
He took *every* last one of those babies home
somehow I feel like a puppy. so hi chris
OMG Shakira's future husband is the sweetest ♡
the only thing that i dislike about this video was the fact that it WASN’T LONG ENOUGH GIVE US MORE
this is so wholesome 😭
Oh to be one of those dogs...
thanks for this.
he seems like a solid loving Boston man.
I keep saying hi when playing with puppies too
Finally! Y’all give this man what he’s always wanted 🎉
This is just too much sweetness!!!
I loved this interview
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the greatest video ever
theres literally tears in my eyes watching this.
Dodger at home be like: WELCOME HOME CHEATER
He's thinking about getting another doggy in his house...
I just fell in love 😍
"Scarlett is my girl"😍

2:21 his laugh is just the best thing
4:15 *sebastian stan as bucky crying in the corner*
"Come get it" -- Can I apply to be a dog? I can bark -- arf! arf! 🤭🐕
never thought I’d get misty for a chris evans interview, but when he started talking about older dogs.. ugh.  Just lost my little old man in March after 15 years together.  He was about 2 or 3 when I rescued him & that was the best decision of my life.    puppies are adorable, but every dog deserves a forever home.
Chris Evans waited his entire life for this
FINALLY!! <3 This is the best thing on the internet. My heart is so happy!
IM SO EXCITED TO WATCH THISSS
Uncut version please 🥺
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
My water just broke
"Scarlett is my girl" they have the best "sibling/friend" relationship, i love it. This was an amazing, cute, and long overdue interview
gosh it’s really hard not to be in love with this man
You can end this series now.  We’ve all been waiting for Chris Evans to lose his heart to more doggies.  This is the penultimate
Chris Evans calling puppies “Bubby” is something I never knew I needed until it happened
am I crying ?? 🥺🥺🥺
Bless you Buzzfeed
this was amazing!!!!! now we need pedro pascal please
i'm melting
Lucky puppy licking that beautiful mouth of him 😩❤️❤️
He’s gonna make a great father one day. He’s so affectionate, attentive and gentle with animals & clearly he’s a good spirited person because these puppies are non stop just eating up this attention from him lol
i love this guy
This interview cleared my skin, paid my bills, and watered my crops!
Did anyone just feel this video shouldn't have ended..i mean my heart was popping out ....i am so happy today..💞💞💞 love you Chris
also, if Tom Holland can have two puppy interviews, so can Chris. Make it happen eventually. Thank you Buzzfeed for making this happen
Karl, mei droppe. 😳
okay but random thing that stood out to me but melted my heart simultaneously, but Chris was calling all of the dogs "Buster Brown", which is something my mom calls my boy cat 🥺idk why but that just melted me it was so sweet
Finally,the best celeb to be around puppies
6:34 when the dog was a bit tensed Chris just layed down to its level. What a Chad.
PURE.SEROTONIN.
I wanna that puppy sooooo bad
this is my serotonin
I NEED MORE OF CHRIS WITH PUPPIESSSS
ughh 🫣🥺

Googling how to become THOSE puppies🛐✨
He's literally a Disney Prince 👑 and no one can convince me otherwise.
He's in heaven. Literal heaven.
we definitely need more Chris interviews with puppies
oh to be a puppy and make Chris Evans smile like that lmao
Omg finally this is so cute.... He's so adorable and so are the puppies...
I love how he's so much more gentle with the older dogs 😭😭😭😭
Omg, so sweet 😍😍😍
It's about time we got this interview
😍😍😍😍
Petition to have the uncut version, PLEASE!
This was amazing. Pure joy. Couldn't stop smiling....and when he brought out the senior dogs I got a little misty eyed. He's so amazing.
I have never wanted to be a puppy this badly
This would be me if someone asked me questions with puppies/dogs were in the room
"LOOK AT YOU GUUUYS GUUUUIIIIHHHYYYYYZZZZ" Killed me
Going feral 💀💀
Oh .. oh oh… 🚶‍♂️…🧎‍♂️.. 💥… 🐕
Okay but he’s gotta do another, I want twenty minutes of him playing with dogs
This is awesome, now upload the Thirst Tweets video
THIS IS THE MAN OF MY DREAMS 😃👍💕💕💕💕
What interview? He just wanna play with puppies
This video is a tonic. He was so sweet with those older dogs.
The best thing I’ve ever seen
THE INSTANT SEROTONIN.
ok google how to cast as a puppy
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This should be called “ Captain American plays with puppy’s “ lol
He’s wanted this for so long and he finally got it. He just looks so happy <3
Istg this is the best thing on earth
“Come get it”  Me:🏃🏾‍♀️
I hope he can play with me in time as well.
8:17 "Excuse you?" GOOD GOD-
8:15 Shit, what a lucky puppy
I can watch this every day. For breakfast, lunch & dinner. Can we get a part two.
The pet names 😩
I also adopted an adult dog and she's absolutely wonderful she was a year old  and is a beagle and the absolute best
I know Doctor Mike isn’t technically a celebrity but I think that everyone - Doctor Mike included - would love it if you could get him in studio to surround him with puppies.
I love uuuu chris omggggg so cuteeeeeeeeee😩
when i tell you the world has been waiting for this.. thank you buzzfeed. the dogs were so adorable and adding chris on top, i did not expect this to have such an affect on me. wow.
I'm guessing that's PR training coming through when you say "no disrespect to the puppies" like they're about to sue for defamation lol
He knows Return of the Mack, he just got 100x more hotter 😍
I truly don’t think imma recover from this interview. He’s the SWEETEST. I LOVE HIM 😭😭😍😍
This makes me love Chris even more. Especially, how he was gaining the older dogs respect, the care and understanding he had for them is truly amazing.
Giving the people what they want I see
Can we get Andrew Garfield next please😭😭😭😭😭
chris evans is for the people and now the dogs!!
i love this man SO much, i just melted
Give him kittens now!
BEST INTERVIEW EVERRRR 🌹🌹🌹🌹
how to be belle???
The amount of times I paused this video to catch my breath and take a moment- love him so much
I wonder what Dodger's reaction when Chris got home smelling like puppies
this is almost 9 minutes of chris evans having a hard time focusing cause he has puppies everywhere
Chris Evans alone is sooooo adorable and now with puppies? And then with the senior dogs?!?!?! 🥺😍💘💗💞💕❤❤❤
NO DISRESPECT FOR THE PUPPIES!! 😭😭😭
The moment we've all been waiting for!
The most wholesome video on the internet
the whole world paused
As adorable as Chris was with the puppies, my favorite part was him with the older dogs. My heart literally melted!
Ok so cute but when *I* meet Chris Evans and start licking his face I’m asked to leave the movie premiere. 🙄🙄🙄 So unfair
He is drunk on pups
I'd like to play with puppies and Chris Evans
he 100% just came here for the puppies
Been waiting for this so long... Yeah
He sounds like he's high on puppy fumes 😂😂
after getting my wisdom teeth taken out, this was definitely the video to watch omg i’m tearing up i don’t think chris answered a single question and i’m completely fine with that because he looked so gosh darn happy with those dogs
I can imagine Dodger being judgy asf like "bruh. BRUH.  😑" after smelling all those dogs on Chris 🤣
Oh no what’s happening to me 🏃🏾…🧍🏾…🧎🏾….🐕…
ABOUT TIME, BUZZFEED. ABOUT DAMN TIME.
Did anyone NOT read any of the questions? Who cares?!?
"Who cares"  Well yeah I really did just cane to see him just with puppies . God they are adorable
BEEN WAITING LIGHT YEARS FOR THIS
He is so drunk from puppies, I love it
Buzzfeed, this is a gentle but strong request: RELEASE THE UNEDITED FOOTAGE PLS AND THANKYOU
BEST. INTERVIEW. EVER.
Not me crying over this puppy interview. When he interacted with the senior dogs I just lost it! 6 months ago I had to say goodbye to my senior dog after 15 yrs…it was tough. Loved this! He’s so great with the dogs…
This lighted up my whole day <333 ily Chris
If i had the chance i would reincarnate myself as a puppy
HE FINALLY GOT WHAT HE WANTEDDDD !
I need all his kind of love that he gives
Thank u BuzzFeed...we needed that man + puppies.
Oliendo a Perro con chris evans,😻😻😻😻😻
YES YES YES YES YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!
Really - best interview ever ! 🥺❤️
The only hetero Im comfortable with fucking loving!!!!!!!!
Why doesn't this have a million views yet? 🤨
The joy this man gets from puppies is pure serotonin
Thank you for this interview with THE Chris Evans. I had a bad day at work and I am just watching this on repeat. 🥰
All interviews should be done this way.
not me getting a lightyear ad in the middle of the video. and the way chris said scarlett was his girl…oh my god my heart!
BEST.PUPPY.INTERVIEW.EVER.!!!!
i'm just eating two big hamburgers and watching this... and is the best choice i ever made in a long time :)
Rex already had a movie called Jurassic Park.
Smiling for 9mins straight is POSSIBLE. Also that last dog, bless your soul my baby
Es tan perfecto!!!!
I could do this all day.
This isn't enough, we need a part two. If Tom Holland gets a Part Two, we need a Part Two and Three with Chris Evans. I love that he featured both puppies and senior dogs.
The internet just melted.
If I am playing with puppies and people ask me questions I would be like. Who cares can we do this another time I'm with puppies
Chris Evans and Adam Driver in a movie together *WHEN?*
WHO CARES！
I love the puppies, but I hate and can't stand Chris Evans! Tim Allen in my heart will always be Buzz Lightyear.
Thank you Buzzfeed! This just made my day!
He’s adopting another one for sure
I'm surprised Dodger didn't suddenly wind up with a new sibling after this interview, lmao.
Have any celebs actually adopted any of these dogs they play with?
We finally got it!!!! The video we've been begging Buzzfeed to release for YEARS!!!!!
The way his voice turned soft when he called them🤣🤣
If I get a dog I’m now naming it Buster Brown
this saved my summer
There’s nothing more joyful to me than seeing puppies wagging, licking, climbing all over someone who loves them as much as this! This is what life is all about!
Chris Evans and puppies? Is this heaven?
didn't know I needed this
i know dodger had the “WELCOME HOME CHEATER” out on the front yard when chris came home 😭😭😭😭
Loved it.
“Let’s cast Adam Driver, see what he does” MY HEART EXPLODED THOSE ARE MY 2 FAVOURITE PEOPLE AND CHRIS WANTS HIM TO PLAY HIMSELF AHHHHHHH
i am just falling more and more in love with him as i watch this
I need this of Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski
this is too short 😭😭
the best most important thing ive seen all week
Gemini season delivering
UGHHHHHHHHH SICHEBLAHSMAJABDOXKDNDBJDBFBKFKREsjsiakskkeiwj.     I need a man like Chris Evans my LAWWD!
this is the best thing that ever existed on the internet
I can bark
Had to rewatch the video cuz I'm here for Chris' gorgeousness but i kept getting distracted by the dogs 😂
I'm absolutely OBSESSED!! I've watched this soo many times!!! ❤️ The best part was let's build some trust! 🥺 My heart is complete mush! ❤️
the pup @ 8:15 , GOD I WISH THAT WERE MEEE
I HAVE BEEN WAITING TO SEE THIS EVER SINCE I REALIZED BUZZFEED DOES CELEBS WITH PUPPIES VIDEOS, CAUSE LIKE COME ON, IT'S CHRIS EVANS! HAVE YOU SEEN THE MAN WHEN HE HANGS OUT WITH DOGS??? THIS IS GREAT
Why am I crying as he plays with older dogs?!
the puppies are meting chris’ heart without doing anything gosh wish I was them
Aww my goodness!!!💗💗🥹🥹😍😍💖💖So adorable!!
spending my evening watching my second husband play with puppies? best evening ever!!!
I can’t tell what’s cuter, the puppies or Chris 😍
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE
Massive thanks to Tom Holland for telling them to get Chris on here.
Good. Now please do one with Chris Evans and Tom Holland together covered in many many puppies. Then Sebastian Stan with kittens. Thank you. Is there one with Taika Waititi? You would need to include Rhys Darby to be fair obviously.
FINALLY!!!
Very pleased to see senior dogs in a viral video! There's so many who need good homes. I hope this inspires people to adopt older dogs, not just the puppies.
Best Video on YT since YT exist.
This man considered saying no to the role of Captain America, but still calls adopting his dog the best decision of his life. You've got to have your priorities straight, people. He knows Dodger would love him every bit as much even if his career was a total failure.
Alternate title: Chris Evans falling in love with dogs for 8 minutes straight.
hes so humble.. talking about having made..have i??
Now we need a Chris Evan’s interview with babies 🤌🏾👏🏾
For his next video , maybe reading THIRST TWEETS? 😂
I miss the kitten interviews
chris evans is such a gem of a human
His laugh is wonderfully contagious. Also he's beautiful.
DROP THE UNEDITED FOOTAGE NOW
I love this guy!
Yeaaaa this will be in my downloads FOREVER cuz this was THE CUTEST, BEST INTERVIEW EVER!!! Chris Evans is only allowed to interview with puppies for now on lol
Well, you did it. You found the way to make him even cuter. Cover him with puppies.  Although will Dodger like when he comes home smelling of other dogs? 😀
Aww if only... I CAN BARK AND BE NAUGHTY WHY DIDN'T ANY OF U CALL ME?!!!😭
Imagine showing up to work and your entire job is just to watch Chris Evans play with puppies
Chris Evans can just HAVE my heart. He and those puppies just melted it. And he's right about older dogs, nearly teared up the way he talked about them.
I’ve literally waited years for this video! 🎉 also, I’m very jealous of the puppies 😭😭
I like how the title is chris evans playing with puppies instead of chris evans playing with puppies while answering questions
the only thing i hated about this vid is that its only 8mins. cmoooon give us the uncut versioooooon
Can this be a thing that everyone gets to experience once in their life?
WE NEED LONGER VERSION 🤧🤧🤧
Wish Chris Evans can tell me "come get it" loool
Looks like he could do this all day.
I still remember when Chris was in the movie “Gifted” with a cat named Fred.
💖
8:15 lmao 😂😂
I could watch 10 hours of this nonstop and still want more...it was definitely worth the wait 😂
I'd love to see an hour Chris Evan's plays with puppies video, because he's just adorable!!!!!🥺🥺🥺
I never wished to be a puppy so bad 😂😝👀
This is literally my favourite interview
Dodger ​will​ get​ angry​ when​ he​ sees​ this​ vdo​ 😂😂
“Come get it” I wanna get it 😎
Guys .. i’m pregnant now
Awwww 🧡🧡🧡
GIVE US MORE. ONLY 8 MINUTE? ITS NOT ENOUGH!
This is exactly what we were waiting for! 😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
words cannot describe how much i love this man
no entiendo ni papa el ingles pero aquí estoy viendo a chris evans …..ya quisiera ser uno de esos perritos para estar en las piernas de  el ….tan carismático es este hombre
Best. Interview. Ever.
I just fell deeper in love with him 😩thanks buzzfeed ❤️
Uber cute:)

I just melt so fucking much. How could anyone not love this man??????? Damnit
please play with me I can be a puppy too
isso ta perfeito! 😭💛
Finally!!! It's made my day ❤️
i feel like the title for this isn’t quite correct, “chris evens being unwillingly shut up for 9 mins straight”
“thanks for trusting me” MY HEART
This is all I need in my life. I am now whole
Chris Evans looks like he is in puppy Heaven!
So adorable. And the dogs were cute, too.
finally
Someone needs to send this video to SebScreen ASAP.
This will break the internet
*Chris coming home* Dodger: "were you cheating on me? With how many? 👁👄👁"
the older dogs part made me cry, so sweet
YESS
i wanna come over there so...
slay slay SLAY
I wouldn't be surprised if he adopted one of those dogs. Nothing can't beat watching Chris Evans with doggies. It's just the most precious thing ever. Love him ❤❤❤❤❤
This was everything 😊
Why can't he just marry Ana DeArmas and make us all happy?
ok, this is the best interview of chris I ever watched. but know we want this interview with sebastian stan
"WHO CARES" *clenchs fists from overloading cuteness* AHHHH best interview ever indeed! We need buzzfeed to get on part 2 IMMEDIATELY
I've never needed an uncut version more.
aw omg , i lo d how he can’t answer the questions
He is just the most beautiful and sweet human being!! We all have to protect them 🥰🥰🥰
This interview is causing major ovulation.
That white senior dog had me melting!!! Wish I were in California
Now all we need is the reaction video of Dodger when Chris Evans comes home smelling like all those other dogs lol
I've never smiled for so long! This is so wholesome! I love it! 💕
I mean he can also play with me 😌
I love him so much 🥺😍 and him with the puppies and adult dogs 😭❤️
Everyone: finally
pleaes do a shawn mendes puppy interview
i was probably happier watching this interview than chris was doing the interview
Great job Chris 😁
I finished the video… and then started it again :)
More more more more more more I NEED MOREEEEE VIDEOS WITH CHRIS EVANS😍❤️ Give us more
I love how Chris wasn't even answering the question and just playing with the puppies
“At what point in your career did you realize you made it as an actor?” Chris: “Have I?!”   Please, the sound I made at that answer and the face with it. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Que si quiero que me sobe como a una perra, dice.
HARRY STYLES NEXT.
Not y'all dropping this when I'm ovulating 😭
Chris Evans is me playing with the dogs at work (I work at a doggy daycare place)
He is so calm and respectful for the dogs, the puppies and the older dogs ❤️❤️ it’s a blessing to have Chris Evans on the beautiful planet ❤️❤️
Pure bribe” hey can we have a interview? We will let you play with puppies”
Can I be your baby? His laugh is soo contagious🤣
FINALLYYYY. THIS JUST MADE MY HEART SO HAPPY. LITERALLY HAD A SMILE ON MY FACE THE ENTIRE TIME.
This should have been 20 minutes.
This was so pure loved every minute 🤍🦋
I didn’t know I needed “Chris Evans played with puppies” in my life for some cleansing 😂
Will the real Buster Brown please stand up?!
Excuse me but can he open an animal rescue shelter or something so he can always have animals around and it be this cute 24/7? Cause he is so in heaven with the puppies!! Like obvi have people working there and helping out but then he can have more cute times like this. AWEE!! Also Chris Evans is such a kind soul from everything he posts to interviews. He cares about so many good things and I love it.
i smell like envy right now 😩 someone throw 60 puppies at me
Can't believe this guy is 41 he look great always have been.
this is the one i've been waiting for!!!
This man is just the absolute dream 😍 😩 🙌
This is the best interview of all time
I wanted a little young puppy but Chris convinced me to adopt an older one. I love this man. I don't even want kids but would have all of his babies.
Can we petition for the uncut version? Bring him back in for a part two when the gray man comes out?😂❤️
Is one of the puppies named Buster like Andy's dog from the Toy Story Series that's ADORABLE
WHY WAS THIS ONLY 8:44 MINUTES?!?!?!?!!
Wow Chris really kept his dog voice going through the whole "interview". Not that I blame him. Not at all.
Dude is a total Dog Guy, so the fanboying over cute little pups is not a surprise. Best combination since Keanu Reeves and Puppies 😂
I'm still crying over his pure heart with those senior dogs. God please protect Chris Evans at all cost :')
You know what would be awesome? Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, and Tom Holland puppy interview
Now we just need Chris Evans reads thirst tweets
This is the best day of my life
this is the only interview that matters ever
AHHHHHH OMGGG THIS THE BEST INTERVIEW EVERRRR 😍😍😍 That laugh that smile is EVERYTHING 😱 Love you Chris plus the puppies ✨❤️
Oh my god been waiting for this forever
Now thirst tweets next, buzzfeed. Come on.
He truly is a dream man 😍🐾
I love how he can't even complete full sentences from the overload of cute puppies 😩 haha
Love his laughs❣️🤩
My ovaries are gonna explode
Puppy gets distracted by other puppies,
I’ve been waiting for this interview!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just fell in love
My life is complete now after watching this interview ✅
I honestly love that he focused on the dogs more!!! So adorable!!
He would actually die if it were golden retrievers
Daddy Evans
Dear Lord. Just when I think this man couldn’t do anything to make me love him more, he does this…the puppies were cute but the fact that he wanted senior dogs…I love him so much.
Hahaha! He is me! This is exactly how I'd react in an interview like this. WHO CARES? LOOK AT THE PUPPIIIIIEEEES!
It’s so adorable that he calls all the dogs Buster 💕 reminds me of my dad who calls every dog he meets and pets “pretty baby”
"thanks for trusting me bubba" i will simply be Passing Away
Uncut version or we wont leave you alone buzz
he would be such a good dad.
the most beautiful human in this world
FINALLY
Love the mention of adopting older dogs! I adore senior dogs and I love the shout out.
Chris 20% of the interview: answering the questions Chris 80% of the interview: Hi guys 🥺 hi pals ,hi buster , c’mere guys, hey buster (repeat) Dodger’s gonna be jealous when he came home LOL
And after the end of this interview Chris adopted all the puppies to take home with him and add to Dodger and his family hahaha 🤣😌
hes so wholesome 🥹
Yessss BuzzFeed has granted my wish!!! 😍🥺
I had a pretty hectic week at work and this video put me in a good mood. I love watching videos like these because who doesn't love puppies? I also enjoy the video of Emma Watson playing with kittens.
Why am I in love with this complete stranger
the people rallied and buzzfeed finally delivered
Why did this interview make him even more attractive. Wtf.
“good job bubba” i would literally die for you
Hello sir, I can bark.
I love how everyone has a pet name they default to and finding out Chris Evans's was Buster Brown was so adorable 😭 I'M SO GLAD HE FINALLY GOT TO DO THIS INTERVIEW. MY HEARRRT
Best interviews ever.
I have fallen more in love with him …. I can’t !!! This man is amazing… 😍🥰😘😘😘
FINALLY
I can’t focus on the questions because there’s Chris Evans… and puppies
This went exactly how I expected
it’s finally here. been waiting for this one for years.
8 minutes is not nearly long enough. I love and respect this man so much
Do these dogs not realize that they just were being petted by CHRIS EVANS
while answe- nope
The way he says Downey<3
oh my gawd
In a parallel universe, Chris asks me to "come get it" as he lays in our bed.
CHRIS CAN DIE HAPPY NOW
He’s the most genuine person in Hollywood
CHRIS X ADAM DRIVER WOULD BE A DREAM COME TRUE
The guy I end up with better act like this around my pets lol 😅
I WISH I AM A PUPPY
Ok best birthday gift ever!!!!!! This is pure love!!
YES Chris Evans finally!!! Sebastian Stan NEXT!!!
The stages of cuteness aggression he goes through lmaoo me too chris
Omg so adorable!!! 😍😍😍
im not you!
this is why chris was delayed in doing the interview cause absolutely nothing will get answered
OMG!!! 😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫
Buzzfeed gave us what we wanted and it did not disappoint, truly the best "interview" on the internet
HOW DO YOU WATCH THIS WITHOUT SMILING
everyone say thank you buzzfeed
This is one of the cutest, sweetest, most adorable video I have watched. I LOVED IT!
Oh  my goodness! That was the most gorgeous thing I have ever seen :) Chris Evans plus puppies and senior dogs.....couldn't think of anything better. Made my day!
I'm jealous of these puppies.
He is just GORGEOUS🤯❤️‍🔥
I just fell in love with this man 10x over😩😍
This man cannot be single, it would be a crime against humanity
Chris calling all the dogs Buster makes me very happy. My family’s dog is name Buster so I think he will enjoy this next time I go home.
Cuteness overload!!! The puppies and Chris Evans 😍😍😍
Okay seriously Return of the Mac and puppies…..this man is now my Favorite human ❤️❤️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Please tell me he adopted one of them, and named him Buster Brown 🐕❤️
nature is healing 🦋🦋
This video could be 2 hours and it still wouldn't be long enough
this melts my heart
That’s it, I’m now satisfied with my life: I can finally die in peace ✌️ ⚰️
no i'm not crying you're crying 😍❤️😭🐾
Me muerooooo😍😍😍
This video made me realize that me and Chris have something in common…cute aggression😭😭😭😭
This is the greatest idea!!! Chris Evan is in such AWWWEEEE... that he sounds buzzed, LOL!!!
"Hi, I'm Chris. I'm a feminist ally and I love hot coffee enemas."
Never really liked dogs because the strays in our streets gave me pure trauma but i love this!
He 100% went home with 2 of those pups 😂
They took too long! He needed his puppy interview a long time agoooo!!! I love this Chris Evans and puppies oof ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Therapy: Expensive Chris evans playing with puppies: Free
I can’t believe they didn’t ask Johnny Storm of Steve Rogers 😂
never thought id be jealous of puppies but this is my life now 😫😫😫
How many puppies r u talking home
MY HEART IS MELTING ON GOD 😭💕💀💖💗💞💞
Los perritos viejitos 😭
Well, I just fell in love with Chris Evans all over again…
“ExcUUse YoU” the dog knew it was heaven
The real question should be do you think that Dodger needs a brother?
“Scarlets my girl, Renner would be trouble, Downey would be a lot of fun Hemsworth would just make me feel bad about myself all day” 😭😭 Bro caps .. I mean Chris’s answer to which avenger he’d be handcuffed too was literally every marvel fans dream answer 😆
Buzz Feed finally getting Chris on this is a true answer to our prayers. I will never be over how precious this is
Why is this too short? Hahahaha... I would've love to see like a 30 min video? Hahahahah... He's so cute. Now, let Chris Hemsworth do this. Hahahah... 🤣
im gonna cry
Hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hahahahahhahahahahahahhhhhhahahajahah
This should be called “who wants to be peed on by puppies?” 😅
Adorable and the puppies are adorable too
Wish I was one of the puppies
Okay i wanna have all his baby's! This is SO ADORABLE😍🥰
I'll come get itt 🤪 lol
Chris Evans is such an awesome human being😃 the way he wears getting busy talking to the puppies in the middle of answering questions was so cute 🥰 Tells a lot about him. He is such a Cute guy 😘 Wish to see him more in the movies 😍
He is so damn fine, bruh. Ugh.
I feel you lil pupper... I mean, who else would piss themselves if they walked into a room and Chris Evans is there waiting with open arms to receive you???
I’ve been waiting for this. He’s so good with puppers. 😍
He kept calling the puppers "Buster Brown" and I immediately thought, "I bet his mom bought him Buster Brown shoes!" Then I realized that this delicious cinnamon roll was playing with puppies and I lost my train of thought.
AWEEEEEE the puppies running towards him <333
This is the best interview ever
The moment Monsieur Evans called that dear older pooch 'Bubba' - Oh my heart ❤️❤️❤️
i love this man. so much.
M LIFE IS NOW COMPLETE. I CAN DIE HAPPY.
He barely answering any of the quetions lol 😂😂 the puppies isn't a distraction distraction, the question was 🤣
*THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN*
The timing of this feature against what he posted on social media about the hate on his animated Lightyear movie is too good to be true. Guess he's trying to save some of his fan's  goodwill...
This man has my whole heart
“Hi buster! Hi pal!” 😭😭😭😭
I'm so in love with him, help
I LOVE CHRIS SM
Best laugh ever 😂😍
Love how this video is captured “Chris Evans plays with puppies” without the “while answering fan questions” cause that’s literally all he does-
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️
i need an uncut version im so serious, this was too cute
This is exactly how I imagined Chris would be during the puppy interview 😂
Well this is the best thing that’s ever been made
PLZZZZ DO ELIZABETH OLSEN NEXT PLZZZZ BUZZFEED PLZZZZ
I felt my estrogen levels 📈 🚀 🤰
My cheeks are in immeasurable pain for smiling for 8:45. This man is a walking rainbow.

Best. Interview. Ever. <3
buzzfeed, i'm serious. give us all the footage you cut. we need absolutely everything youve filmed. thanks
If I were Chris Evans I'd ask if I can adopt all the puppies after the interview.
Gawd I just died and came back
4:16 “You got a scratch, pal? C’mon let me get it, I got’chu.”   How did the puppy resist??
this is the best thing ever
The way I checked this channel EVERYDAY to see when this video was uploaded is embarrassing. I just love him sm 😭
Chris Evans thanking the puppies for kissing him has made this video exceed my wildest expectations
Chris Evans and puppies ????? Cuteness overload
Return of the Mack?? Ok Jamal Chris evans ❤️❤️😭😭
*immediately gets into submissive position to get puppies to like him more*  THIS MAN MAKES ME MELT
He asked for them to let in older pups ♥️
he's in his happy place
I wish I was a puppy
Okay but what breed is that?
Respect to him and buzzfeed for bringing on older dogs too
There are people behind camera getting paid for this.
i watched the entire interview with heart eyes emoji face THIS IS SO CUTE!!!!!
this is probably the best video I’ve ever seen
Everything I expected and more!
Me who’s scared of dogs 😩
I Love this so much❤️
I'm OFFICIALLY PREGNANT!😭😭😭😩💕
wait... this hadn't happened yet? HOW???  (Also: thank you).
Forget everyone else, let Chris evans play with heaps of puppies and just film it. Because we all love it
RELEASE THE WHOLE VID YOU COWARDS
I love how he changed the tone of his voice to not scare the senior dogs!!!...i just loooveee he understood!!!♥️♥️♥️
What I would give to get Chris to just adoringly look into my eyes and call me Buster
I could watch it all day
He is such a sweetheart ❤😂
I hate how much I Stan him 😭
I didn’t pay attention to the single word he said 🐶🐶
Chris is a true dog lover 🤗 Loved every second of this interview and hope this isn’t the last!
Lord have mercy I'm bout to BUST 🥰
this video is cuteness overload 🥹🤍
These videos usually: "blank plays with puppies while answering questions" This video: "blank plays with puppies"
This is adorable
he  needs me
i need him
Best video on the Internet
Please tell me he went home with buster!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
now Tom Hardy, please
So adorable I love you evans ❤️
i claim him.
I dont know who am i relating to the most. Chris, who thinks he is in heaven or the puppies whose licking his face, climbing him or jumping in between his legs. Because dude....i would do the same.
His laugh is contagious :)!!!
I want to be a puppy so bad
Now we want all the footage pls!!!
This man is so gorgeous
How he is with puppies, I'm like that with babies
These are the only legit interviews.  Also, I don't know who I want to be more: the puppies or Chris Evans.  Probably Chris Evans, because DOGGIES!
Thank god y’all finally gave this man his puppy interview
Omg they’re so cute🥹💖😩
YAYYYYY
Really want Henry Cavill to do one of these.
thank you sm
And this is fucking news because ??
My dog's name is Bailey, but I call him "bubba" sometimes...so I was watching this and my dog was lying on my lap,  when Chris said "bubba" his ears perked up and he looked at my phone. It literally melted my heart ❤️
I want to imagine Dodger’s face when Chris came home smelling like random puppies
Finally! waiting for this felt like forever
I feel like the important question to ask now is how is buzfeed still a thing
I will never be sad again after this 😂 I swear they just cured my depression
The serotonin level has sky rocketed for me.
You can tell what kind of person someone is by how they are with animals... What he said about senior dogs was so sweet! I got cavities lol. How many did he go home with? Haha
god he's so sweet with them 🥺 someone give this man children please
He has the most infectious laugh.
"Scarlett's my girl!" - Chris Evans 2022   I love their friendship so so much!!😭💙
This did not disappoint!! All of us including Chris have been looking forward to this!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍✨️✨️✨️✨️
The fact that all the dogs were "Buster" to him 😍
My serotonin is so high watching Chris Evans playing with puppies and (not) answering questions! 🥹 Release the uncut version 👏🏽
questions are not important He's just happy
Have mercy on us
Are all the dogs called Buster?😂
Why is this not hours long?!
Finally!! The wait is over!! We love you Chris Evans 😍✨
return of the mac is like my favorite song ever we’re twin flames guys keep up
New title: “Golden Retriever Plays With Puppies” YALL KNOW HES THE KING OF GOLDEN RETRIEVER ENERGY
Ok. This is it for me. This is my bisexuality popping up Chriss jezzzus
how can you not fall in love with him more...
The best interview ever!!!
“Come get it, come get it.” ON MY WAY.
The serotonin we needed
มันน้อยเกินไป 8 นาทีมันไม่พอ 5555 หลงกว่าเดิมอีก พี่ตกหนูอีกเเล้ว
How many times does he say "HIIII" ahaha
04:02 “Scarlett is my girl” 🥹🥹🥹🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
“… no disrespect to the puppies, of course.” 🥹
I bet Dodger will get a puppy brother soon
You can't tell me that Dodger is an only child after seeing this.
" Chris Evans plays with puppies " !!! Really !! What is going on with the world !
I love this content.
🙌
This is the sweetest thing ever.  It did not disappoint. Chris is such a loving person and you can see it when he is with all of these dogs ❤️❤️
I’ve been waiting for this one!
when Chris says “thanks for trusting me” my heart skips a beat 😭
“Thanks for trusting me”   This guy gets it. Massive respect
Best video on the internet.
Finally! Chris got the puppy interview he wanted. ☺️ Remember when he tweeted that he wanted to do this? 😄
Chris Evans is my favourite person❤
He sounded so calm
I FUCKING ADORE HIM HE IS SO SWEET CAPTAIN AMERICA IS LITERALLY HIMSELF 💓😫
That last puppy was all of us
Someone get him some bubble wrap. 😆
he has such a gentle heart I’m crying I love Chris so much
THEY FREAKIN DID IT
I love him smmm
His stylist chose the perfect shirt to show of his arms :))))))
So when is the uncut version being released??? 🥹🥹🥹
The moment we've ALL been waiting for!
This is without doubt the best interview on this planet and I stand by that. This is my happiness this cured my depression and yes I am going to be back very soon.
When I tell you, I screamed when he said that he'd pick Adam Driver for his biopic as himself. I mean, they don't look alike but honestly, I'd still dig that, Adam is currently one of the best actors in my opinion 🔥
The video I have been waiting for for nearly a decade.   I’m amazed he didn’t take all of them home though knowing how much of a dog person he is.
Dodger about to disown Chris when he gets home
The way every dog is buster 🥹
“Happiness…is a warm puppy”- Charles Schultz
This was everything I hoped it would be & so much more.
Well, I know why he is still single. Cannot find a woman who loves dogs as much as he does.
what is the breed? they are so cute 😭
Puppies Plural bring out the child within. A great Test to separate decent people from narcissists. Chris is more into puppies than himself.
It’s impossible to not feel happy while watching this.   Next… Chris Evans reads thirst tweets…. With puppies
Chris is everything. They NEED to do this with Andrew Garfield. Buzzfeed, if you're listening -- ANDREW GARFIELD NEXT PLEEEEEAAAAASSEEEEE ASDFGHJKL!!!!!!!!!!
“hey, buster brown.” 🥺 I love this man so much.
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS 😭😭😭
Chris Evans e filhotinhos, tem coisa melhor? 🥹🫶🏻❤️
i think this interview right here is the peak of my life as a non-celebrity
This was WORTH THE WAIT
MY DEAR GOD.... 💙
Give us MORE
BEST Video! <3 Depression cured! And thank you so much for the love you gave Senior Dogs <3
Did he name them😭😭
this is even better than expected
"hi buster" "hi pal" "oh look at you"
I don't know who I'm more jealous of, the dogs or Chris
Best video I’ve ever ever seen. Highly anticipated
how could you not love this man? he's so adorable 🥺🤍 him being with dogs is so fun to watch
This is cuteness overload! Chris is so sweet with those puppies, especially when he’s playing around with them. I wonder if he thought about getting a little sibling for Dodger.
DREAMS COME TRUE THIS INTERVIEW IS A DREAM WE NEED AN HOUR LONG VERSION ASAP
Aaaand thank you Buzzfeed
This is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen. Anazing
Omg I love this
I’ve never wanted to be a puppy more
Would rather see him playing with pussies..
He is so sweet :(
I will name you buster brown lol lol the little nick names! A true animal lovers thing we do! He’s such a legit person!!!!
ahh finally! ^^ 🤩🥳   anyone else had to stop many times the video?? my heart literally couldn't take the amount of bursting joy ><  lol  ( i guess my body is not used to this much of happiness hormones:p :D)
this is the best video on the internet
Wow you guys made it happen
this is the best thing I've ever watched in my entire life, thank you.
Dodger is in serious danger of getting a sibling.
FINALLY 😭😭😭.
I came here to watch puppies, not be aroused by a 40 something man grunting - WTF
🫠
Chris evans playing with puppies is the best thing to ever happen
Going to legally change my name to Buster
"Scarlett is my girl" I LOVE THEIR FRIENDSHIP SO MUCH ❤
these dogs are living my dream, they got to lick chris evans
I was really needing some smiles today and this gave 'em to me. The way he talked about the senior dogs and not knowing their histories, but knowing that they all still deserve love, was nothing short of amazing. Really loved this. Thank you for the smiles! 💖
He called most of the doggies Buster Brown. Adorable. 🥰 Best interview ever. 😁
Veré esta entrevista cada que esté triste. Imposible no sonreír con los perritos y aún más con Chris. Ese hombre es irreal.
Buzzfeed really did the lords work here
Now all I want to do is play with puppies with Chris Evans. Thank you Buzzfeed for this masterpiece.
8:15 what I'd give to be that dog at that specific moment
Awww I love this man ❤️
Now we need him to read thirst tweets
Is he too good for this dumpster fire of a world? Are we really worthy to be living in a time where a celebrity is this genuine a person? Is this real life? God he's an amazing human!😢I really hope his future life partner is a friggin saint! Chris Evans deserves it.😀
this felt so short, I need more, buzzfeed can post the whole recording, cut nothing, I will love it
This is the best video ever. I said what I said.
IM MELTING 😭😭😭 this is so sweet
''who cares'' Soooo cute omg
Jung Haein Jisoo Kang Hanuel Angelina Jolie Will Poulter Don Lee thirst tweets and puppy interview when? Why do you as in buzzfeed hate Asian celebrities? Y’all be having any random white man but never Asian artist why is that?
The worst part of this entire video was when it ended. I could have watched it all day.
So gay i love him❤️🧡🧡💛💙💜🤍
somebody tell me why i couldn´t stop smiling at my screen
The best 8:45 minutes that I have invested in my life so far.
Uhh we need a ‘thirst tweets’ video
When you want him to caress your body like he’s stroking the puppies coats 😝🥰💕 😂
The senior dog staring at him with eyes love like, same...
LETS GOOO IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THSI
the way he was calling all of them buster 🥺
He is genuinely a nice person
my god he’s here my man is here
Dreams Do come true 🙌🙌😍😍
We are all that one puppy buried in his crotch.
My heart! <3  Can we please get Pedro Pascal next! That would make my life lol
If you just one day only one day feel anything bad about Chris Evans you just have to watching this video , cause he's such a most amazing person i've ever seen in my life .  GOD I LOVE HIM SO MUCH
I LOVE that they bring in senior dogs!!! Thank you!!!
Henry Cavill next, please!
On behalf of every person ever: thank you for this, Buzfeed.
it´s perfect :3
Knowing how he is with Dodger, I already knew he would be absolutely distracted. Lmao.
He's so lovable <3
Never thought I’d be jealous of a puppy.
I choked on my food when he said his theme song would be 'Return of the Mack' lmaoo
This is the most adorable video of my entire life. Omg! Thanks for this. Me and my boyfriend loves u 🇧🇷❤️❤️❤️
Just when I thought I couldn't possibly love that man more....to see him with the puppies was adorable. To see him with the older dogs made me want to cry. What an amazing soul.
I love that he’s unable to contain his excitement! 😂❤️
My life is complete
In the history of Buzzfeed interviews, no one has ever been as distracted as Chris Evans is with puppies😂😂
Dead rn
I have never been more excited in my lifeeeee
@SebScreen I expect to see you here 👀😂
Woke idiot
He got that dog in him
i love this
Having recently adopted a 7-month (soon 10month) puppy from a shelter his words are true.
I would give this man babies, puppies, whatever he wants 😂
chris is simply amazing! i couldn’t stop smiling while seeing him being swept away by with all those puppies. that’s the best interview ever!!
quien fuera perro
This is the best thing ever
Best interview ever! Thank you for making this happen
7:20 Me too pup, me too.
If he and Emilia Clarke ever met the adorableness would be off the charts.
lol. saw this title and thought "Does Youtube post p*rn? I didn't know", b/c that's what this is to a lady heart like mine
This was everything I never knew I needed. Definitely going on the favorites list!
He’s so cute. The way he talked when surrounded by puppies was adorable, was just drowsy and ahh I love it
I have no words, I'm just gonna rewatch it again and again
I love how he calls all the puppies Buster 🥺❤️
Is every doged names buster!? 😭❤ I love you Chirs!
If I get a dog I'm naming him buster
THE WAY HIS VOICE CHANGED SO F CUTE
Best puppy interview yet
I WILL BE CRYING OVER THIS VIDEO FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY
Adopt, don´t shop!!!
Welcome everyone to the most anticipated Buzzfeed interview ever. I don’t think Chris could be happier about this if he tried.
chris with puppies is just an amazing sight to see, this is absolutely beautiful 🥹🥰
Me: Starts to Google how to be a black puppy
Hear me out, put the video on x2 speed and Chris' laugh is the blueprint for the minion laugh
I wish I was buster the puppy
Are all the dogs called buster 😂
Miss you badly, Capt.
I think they found Chris Evans weakness 😂😂😂
IVE WAITED AGES FOR THIS
if i were his girlfriend, I'm gonna be jealous of the dog
Did not pay attention to the questions at all…was preoccupied watching Chris melting over puppies, while my own heart was melting in the process. 🥰🥹❤️
❤😭❤
Thank you for blessing us with this!! 💜💜💜
never liked this man before...don't tend to place celebs on a pedestal but after watching this I can say I adore him. Thank you Chris for being so kind and compassionate towards the dogs, especially the older ones.
Dogs know who their people are! ❤️👏🏼🐶
I would like all footage please. No cuts just raw footage even if it is 3 hours long.  K thnx
Awesome
What's the question?!
I'm so in love with this man

He's the man of my dreams OH MY GOD
Chris, you always be the owner of my hearth! The reason? Just watch the full video, he’s so sweet and kindness! The way in that a person care about animals tells how genuine is their hearth! I’m so proud that a person like Chris Evans is my favorite person in whole world! Love you, Chris 💙❤️⭐️
I need a behind the scene of this interview😩😂

Did he take one home?
The one we all have been waiting for! Finally! ❤️
YEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS
Just gonna say it 💅🏼 💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼
It is beyond me how this man is still single😩❤
That's a cold and coward move from you, Buzzfeed.
I love that they used older dogs too for this one
I can feel SebScreen literally dying watching this!!
This is the cutest thing ever awww the way he speaks to the puppies and the older dogs near the end is absolutely adorable, he’s so nice
the way he calls all of them buster makes me wanna cry
“thanks for trusting me” literally sobbing 😭
Chris Evans puppy interview part 2? 🙏🏻  I will never have enough of Chris Evans playing with dogs!!!
4:04 "Scarletts my girl" 🥺❤
Chris Evans being an absolute darling with these pups! OK now I need to see Chris Pine, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt doing this type of interview!
I love how every dog instantly gets named Buster
GRATEFUL FOR THIS MAN !!!!!!! 🙏🙏❤️❤️😘😘🫶🫶🫶
This is what people have been waiting for, for ages and I've never seen a man physically clench his jaw from so much excitement with the urge to steal all the puppies.
Sexy as always! ❤️
We finally got it, the interview we’ve been waiting for
FINALLY THANK YOU BUZZFEED GODS❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
My heart is so full rn!! 🥺❤ BuzzFeed thank you for this beautiful interview 🤍 CE we love you🤜
I never wanted to be a puppy/adult dog in my life 😭😭 the way he was with them, Christopher Jamal Evans forever has my heart!! 🥹❤️❤️
I'm deeming my worst depression yet I haven't ate anything and didn't even feel hungry and I just woke up and got up cause I laid in bed all day which I don't do on my free days ever, and almost passed out. This video is EXACTLY what I needed. Right on time.
I've always wished to be a puppy but never this much before🥲🥲🥲.
8:16 me
The only thing better than a Chris Evans interview with puppies and dogs is if there were also babies and little kids.
He's so handsome I'm melting into a puddle
This is my favorite interview EVER!
Put *Trigger Warnings* on all gentle Chris Evans content PLEASE!!!
As if i needed more reasons to love him.
I've been waiting for this one!! Nothing is cuter than Chris playing around with puppies
If dodger was watching this  he'd probably be mad hahaha
So how many of them did he take home with him cos I feel like there is zero possibility he left without at least 1 extra dog!
Lame
❤️❤️❤️
I knew return of the Mack was one of my favs for a reason 😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭
cute aggressions 😂😂
this interview was made for chris evans
Omg I’ve been waiting for this! Especially when Tom Holland was surprised that Chris hasn’t done the interview yet lol! Chris is so happy when he’s with dogs it’s so cute and heartwarming! Also when he requested the older dogs as well, *heart clutch* 😍🥰😍
this is my favorite video to ever exist
Whoever created the concept of the puppy interview deserves a raise
Chris Evans just has one of those magical laughs that just warms your heart. He's like a big ol' puppy getting excited around all the tiny puppies. I could not stop giggling at all the cuteness 😂
Thank you Buzzfeed and Chris Evans for making our innermost dreams come true. 😋
Αs if Chris weren't cute already... This is cute overload!!!
8:16 how the fandom be sometimes😳   and Chris telling us to chilllllll
My perfect day right here. Chris Evans and puppies. 🥰🥰
Idk if i wanna be Chris or the puppies in this scenario
Watching him with the puppies was so fun but seeing his patience and love for the senior dogs really hit me hard! Chris what a guy!
buzzfeed knows how to give the people what they want.
What other job would he want? Isn't it clear... doggie daycare owner lol
Honestly we need a longer video😂 Get him back for a part 2 already, like Tom Holland
“Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself.” Bahahaha
i love this man
Omg finally I get to enjoy this masterpiece 🥰😭🐶
This video should've been 2 hours, i've been smiling the whole time 😍
okay but can we talk about how he calls every dog buster?
Never wanted to be a puppy so bad in my life.😉
Omg hearing Chris say "come get it" thank you jezus
He didnt answer a damn thing and this is what we wanted
This video needed to be three times as long! What a lovely, kind man Chris Evans seems to be.
8 minutes of Chris Evans playing with puppies? am I in heaven? 😭😭😭😭
It's like the ultimate combo, gorgeous guys....beautiful puppies and handsome older fellas 💕 My heart melted ❤️‍🔥
Chris Evans IS a puppy
and you can kiss chris evans  through one of this puppies or older dogs, by adopting them and letting them kiss you :)
This is all I’ve ever wanted and more.
This is just so damn wholesome 🥺 exactly what I needed! His baby voice with the puppy and his respectful and calm mood with the seniors 🥺♥️ I need a annual puppy interview with Chris Evans
Alternative title: Chris Evans if He Had ADHD
I LOVE CHRIS AND PUPPIES
WHEN HE CALLS THE DOGS BUBBA 😩🥹🥹
does he like cats as well? cus I have a pretty pussy for him
i grinned so long that my mouth is now dry
Best (and cutest!) thing to watch after a long day 🥺❤
good god, the fact that he wanted to bring in some older dogs too and the way he talks to them actually managed to make me adore him even more somehow
❤️
THIS VID IS NOW MY WHOLE EXISTENCE ITS SO CUTTEEEE
We always adopt our dogs and adopting a senior dog is the best because most are trained already.
Henry cavill please
imagine being married to this man.
"Hemsworth would make me feel bad abt myself" boy 💀
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO FOREVER!!!!!
I KNOW DAMN WELL THERE IS MORE THAN 8ISH MINUTES OF CONTENT, WE NEED MOREEEEEEE
lo amo mucho, me divertí mucho con la entrevista, graciaaas
“Excuse you!” The moment When the puppy was sniffing Chris’s unmentionables 💀💀
We are not worthy of this man. 🥲❤️
How do I sign up to be those puppies climbing all over Chris Evans I need to know
I want to see the whole interview with no cuts please and thank you
Haha what a coincidence, I was just watching Tom Holland’s puppy interview where he was in disbelief that Chris Evans hadn’t done one yet.
He is totally a Townie (Boston) "Pal" "Buster" lmao
I don’t know who I’m more jealous of - the puppies or Chris Evans.
Just finding out my 11 year old dog has cancer and it’s been rough this has given me a lil joy this weekend
Is there a part 2? 3? Feature length?
Absolutely FLOORED by Chris Evans saying when he was younger he wanted to be an animator, didn’t see that coming, always weird when someone is aware of the niche job you have
Odds on Indigo and Orange! 🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾
O M G !!!!! SUCH HOTTEST FACIAL EXPRESSION. 🔥 😍
Just when I thought I couldn't fall more in love with this man!
who has been waiting forever for this? 💖💖💖💖💖
Finally
If he doesnt bring Buster home i swearrr lol 😂
❤️❤️❤️
The sweetest person ever 😭😭
Scratching  Chris Evans with puppy on my My wish list ..   Can’t wait to see him being interviewed by kids ;)  with puppies around him ;)  😆 chaotic !!
The fact that he’s not paying attention to the questions at al 😂🫡🤣
I love this because you can tell he can’t contain his excitement to play with puppies before the interview begins 😩😂🤣
i adopted my dog when she was 6! he's such an animal lover, this interview was so fun to watch
my face hurts from smiling wide constantly throughout the video this was just as expected! <3
Chris being worried he didnt answer any questions..me not even noticing them flashing up on the screen lol 😅
I am in love with him 😭😭 I want to be his housewife and just take care of any dogs he wanted 🥲🥲 I've never seen cevans being so cute in my life 🥰🥰
the fact they added senior dogs makes this 100x better thanj you
Best 8 minutes of my life
Please get harry styles or Louis Tomlinson to do this
Lol remember when he got his cock out and showed the world??!
The fact that it took this long for a Chris Evans puppy interview is a crime ❤️
His baby voice I'm so ded 💀 😩✋🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If tom holland can do it twice, so does chris evans. Am i right?
I need all Chris Evans's interviews to be with puppies and dogs 8 minutes are absolutely not enough. I NEED MORE GIVE ME MORE!!!!
I have a crush on this man I think..
This is what i needed today, not food, just this
I’m suddenly a dog….ruff ruff 🫢
I love Puppy Interviews❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I never wanted to be a puppy this badly before
everyone listen to chris evans and adopt older dogs!
I say buster brown all the time lmao
I NEED the uncut version of the "interview"
I don’t think I’ve ever saw Chris this happy. Thanks for trusting me Baba 🫠🫠❤️❤️
Internet is about to break
Petition for Chris Evans to play with puppies on BuzzFeed every time he's promoting a new project lmao
I love his laugh sm
I love how distracted he is he just wants to be with the dogs! I never trust anyone who doesn't love a dog
Buster r le robó su corazón 🥹🥹🥹🥹
I’ve never watched a captain America movie\ Marvel movie, the only avengers movie My friends took me to see, I saw 10min, fell asleep and woke up at the end…. But damn. I want to support anything this guy does now. You can’t “act” that kindness.
LOVE HIM SO MUCHHHHH
He really came her just for the puppies lmao
🤢🤢
Now he needs to do 'Rescue Dog Rescue' on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert 🤞🏻
THAT'S THE BEST INTERVIEW I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!! I couldn't stop smiling. Please, bring Henry Cavill to this 💞💞
His laugh 😂 he is so funny and the dogs are cute 🙂
I CANT HANDLE!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
So Evans thinks Muslims & Christians are idiots for not wanting their children indoctrinated with the Alphabet Agenda?
8:14 that would me my safe place too, to be completely honest with you guys
“scarlett’s my girl” CRIES
And this is why Chris Evans is my favorite actor, he’s the most genuine, caring guy I’ve ever seen and seeing him with the older dogs made me tear up because he was really sweet towards them 🥺🥺🥺
This... is life.
this has been long overdue
I need Lizzie to be in this interview🥰
This interview is not long enough 😂
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS INTERVIEW
Ok I’m writing this directly from my grave!! He’s like the cutest guy on the 🌎 🥺 you can’t go wrong having him and puppies they’re the best combination 🥰 my heart is so full right now 🥰

that  was the best video ever created
I WOULD LIKE TO BE THOSE PUPPIES...... I FELL IN LOVE AGAIN
Best video ever❤️
🤔 these pups look like they could be my grand-pups...hmhm...tiny Tobi dogs
Human puppy meets puppy puppies. We've been blessed.  Edit: I LOVE that he shed some light on older dogs. Older dogs deserve the world and get overlooked far top often. I want to adopt all the senior dogs I could possibly care for.
His heart is the biggest I CANT 😭❤️❤️
Dodger when  he goes home after this interview : "Welcome home Cheater"
This made me smile. IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!! Chris Evans is such a sweet soul and seeing him around puppies and dogs makes him 1000 times better
I got around 40 cavities watching this intense amount of sweetness. Totally worth it.
Captain America 🤣 "Gayyear" please stop calling people idiots because it's not nice 👍
i have been waiting for this day and i am not disappointed whatsoever
I like how the title of the video is just Chris Evans plays with puppies because he could barely answer anything
This video is the bread you throw into a pond full of ducks. That pond, obviously, is the internet.
This made my day! I love how he is so gentle with the older dogs and how he calls half of the little ones buster. ☺️💗
I love how aware he is of the dogs/puppies being nervous!! ❤️ makes me love him even more!! X
Can watch one hour this. Repeat forever. Só cute😍😍🐶
I love these episodes!!! I've been hearing about this on Twitter for so long!!! Oh man!!!🥰🥰
"EXCUUUUSE YOU!!!" 🐶 doggie was really there
Seeing chris evans cute side is like omg cute
Alternate title: "Chris Evans Plays With Puppies and ATTEMPTS to Answer Questions"
Petition for Harry styles to be the next puppy interview
This interview is the cutest, Chris with puppies just melts my heart! 😍🥺
I just love when he’s talking while laughing that’s always be funny to me
WE DID IT JOE!!
We need timothee chalamet on here next

Chris Evans with puppies = life complete🥺🥺🥺😩
Ben Barnes plays with puppies pleaseeeee

Lol he's barely answering the questions 😂
Can we all agree that wasn’t long enough! ( and that is from a 🐱 person)!! 😍
I’ve never felt more alive
Everything I wanted and more
8:15 never wanted to be a puppy so badly
How to switch places with a puppy? Asking for a friend
Okay next: TOM HARDY
I’ve never heard Chris Evans be as strongly from Boston as he was during this interview. This was made for him, so happy he finally got his chance.
Definitely my love grew even more with this🥰 Chris Evans is the best!❤️ PS:and he has the best voice to talk to those furry ones😩😍
Now this is my favorite interview EVER.
This is the cutest thing ever, I can watch 5 hours of this
FINALLY 🥳
FINALLY THE PEOPLE ARE GETTING WHAT THEY WANT
that's probably the cutest thing I've ever seen
Why did it have to end
this is so sweet! 🥺🥺🥺
This cured my depression
I lost it when he said "Thank you for trusting me" to the older dog 😭😭😭
His forearms ❤️‍🔥
Chris getting overwhelmed with cuteness aggression was by far my favorite part about this entire thing 🥹
Have you ever seen a sexier man? Omggggg🥲
The fact he didn't take them all home shocks me
I’m jealous of Buster
I love him so much for choosing to also showcase the older dogs ❤️❤️❤️
That’s pretty much… exactly how we thought that would go ♥️
Release the full unedited footage buzzfeed
My question is was dodger jealous?
Alright I have to comment on the fact he had senior dogs brought in, because that made my soul sing. Guys, senior dogs are WONDERFUL and full of so much character and life and love. Much like you, they have their own stories-some good, some unfortunately not so good. But they have so, so much love to give and joy to bring. My family started rescuing senior dogs from shelters and organizations years ago, and our pups have brought so much happiness and love into our family. All dogs are wonderful but there's something special about our silly senior pups. They truly are a gift.   Please, if you're considering adopting or fostering a dog, rescue an older or senior pooch. They are so worth it. Plenty of shelters are full of them and they ALL deserve good homes and families.   Massive props to this man for sharing this with us. What a decent soul.
i love him so much for saying „thank you for trusting me“ to the older puppies 🥺 it’s so cute
Look how empathetic he is with them 🥺
Just the way he acts around the adult dogs is so adorable
I COULD WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER ONE OF MY FAVORITE VIDS NOW💞💞
Best interview ever
este es el mejor video que vi en mi vida gracias por tanto nunca vuelvo a estar triste
Those 8 mins were not long enough.. i need at least half an hour of this 😭
Dog Daddy
The puppies are fighting over Chris Evans.
OHH MY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONEEE
I didn't realize how hard I was smiling till the video was over and my entire face was hurting
I'm going to need a part 2 of this interview or a to be continued.
Loki is the best one hahaha
Chris Evans is basically a Labrador Retriever in human form so he's just with his fellow doggos!!
He si so cute men
My cheeks hurt. His laugh makes me laugh.
this has made my week
I am gonna say the fact he was so distracted surprises no one
Worst… and BEST interview he has done! My heart is melting ❤️
this is the greatest video I have ever seen in my whole lifetime
Cuteness overload 😍
I am crying!!!  He is so perfect!!! This interview was the best thing I saw in a long time!!!
Honestly, back then I didn't get all the hype surrounding him. But now, he's become so much more himself and years been very kind to him. He's 10x more attractive now. And gotta love a man who loves dogs ☺
Awww what a way to start this amazing weekend !!
I love this puppy interview so much. I wasn't expecting it to be this good.
4:03 "Scarlett is my girl" aww I love their friendship so much 🥰❤️
Someone knows where can i buy his t-shirt???
The prophecy Has been fulfill
THANK YOU BUZZFEED😩😩😩😩😩😩😭😭😭😭🤍🤍🤍🤍
Chris Evans turned into a 5 year old boy before our eyes with all these puppies and dogs and is the best thing to ever happen on Youtube
I actually cant my heart is meltinggg🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹💖💖💖💖💖🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰HES THE CUTEST HUMAN BEING EVERRRR🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽
You mean, “Chris Evans gets interrupted by questions while playing with puppies”
I bet Chris wanted to adopt ALL the puppies!
Now let's get Ricky Gervais. He would looooove it as much as Chris did
Also... We definitely need a part 2 😍
can we get the unedited version idc if it’s 3 hours long i want it
I just fell deeper in love with this man. Thanks buzzfeed 😭
I have never smiled more in my life
this needs to be at least four hours long.
Now I know what to watch when I'm feeling a little down 🤣❤️ this is the cutest interview ever!!!
Just when I thought I couldn't love him any more!! He's so sweet!!
I'm gonna cry...how sweet is he with them!!!
Sebastian Stan's turn next! 😆🖤
I wanted Buzzfeed to have the cast of Lightyear do a Pixar trivia quiz.
Dodger is gonna be PISSSSED!
when he’s stroking the puppies face at 4:20ish 🫠😵‍💫🥴
My New comfort video!!!!!!!!!!!
This is amazing! 🖤
I don't like fan-girling because it makes me feel gross and creepy. But I am emotionally obligated to watch videos with multiple puppies in them. Edit: I also call my pup bubby and I was really thrown off by that. 10/10 would recommend tho
Chris Evans rendered completely helpless by puppies.   Totally understandable.
I've never been so happy 😆😍
Can this just be a tv show? Like a new dog each week and it’s just Chris playing with the puppies 🥹🥹🥹
Pedro and Oscar’s wired interview has a challenger for my favorite YouTube video ever, and it’s this one right here.
How is this man single huh  Not only the looks i mean he is perfect
i’m so glad he finally got his doggy interview and the way he asked for older dogs because people always want puppies but senior dogs need love too i love this man so much
i’m melting with him tbh
i love his little squeak on 3:28 it’s ughhhh my heart 🥲 he loves puppy’s so much 😍😂
We need more. Please release the uncut version and all the outtakes. I don't care if any questions get answered, just watching Chris with both puppies and older dogs is so wholesome ❤
Yeahhh… I’m that dog at 8:17 😂🤭😈
Since Chris Evans' post I've been coming everyday to Youtube for this masterpiece and it's finally here😩😭❤️🥰
"who caresssss" stop i love him
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Now we need the thirst tweets 😂
SIMPLESMENTE ESTOU DERRETIDA 🤤
Finally!!!!!
this is the purest content...
he came to play with puppies and that is all
Yeah, I need to marry this man.
Now I need Sebastian Stan playing with dogs please!!he plus Chris that would be perfection 😁
When you thought it was possible to move on from your celebrity crush. Geez😔😔😔
wow you slayed
Love how all the puppies are now called Buster or Buster-Brown
Can I come get it too?!?!  Hahaha
changing my name to buster
The only question he answered properly is the one about Dodger. He got his priorities😂
I want to thank Tom Holland for insisting this interview take place. It is a little unbelievable that it took this long for this man to have a puppy interview. I wonder how many puppies '"accidentally" got in his car and left with him? I dare anyone to watch this and not smile.
Man has a heart of gold
Chris is such a joyful person love him (and the fact that he's a dog person definitely adds even more)
FINALLY
this is everything I wanted and more
i have a mixed german Shepard and literally they’re the CUTEST puppies ever. he looked just like them. so precious.
i love this so much, this has healed 97.79% of my trauma and the rest will be healed by having the unedited footage released.
I cannot handle how perfect he is.
no one ever answers the questions and that’s the best part
The senior dog section, so cute! Seniors are so often over looked at shelters  :(
I CANNOT! 🥰😭🤤
I wanna be one of these puppies so bad :( He is adorable man. I love you Chris be happy like that all the time. Smiling is good on you <3<3<3
changed my life, fixed me, cleared my skin, tucked me in, and kissed me on the forehead
WE DEMAND FOR HIM TO READ THIRST TWEETS
Ok, I just got more than enough serotonin for one year
Finally a person tha acts exactly like me around puppies. 🤣🤣🤣 who cares...let's talk about adoption and older dogs. CHRIS, you have my heart❤
When he said no disrespect to the puppies omg😭😭😭😭
CHRJSSSS EVENSSJSSFJW😍😍😍
petition for chris to adopt buster
omg i love chris evans even more watching him so overwhelmed with cuteness!
women: The perfect man doesn't exist. Chris Evans: Hey women: We stand corrected!
Yup, that's a dog parent alright. Look at the reaction.   Namawoof-the dog parent in me recognizes the dog parent in you.
One word : WHOLESOME
Oh my God! How cannot fall in love with him?!?!?!
Please I’m begginggggggg invite Astro for a puppy interview T-T
Finally !!! 😍😍
Chris Evans and puppies... that's my heaven TBH. I CAN NOT handle this.
definitely one of the best ones of these i've ever seen hands down he was so loving and gentle with the older dogs and super cute with the puppies
YESSSS WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
this is the best thing on the internet.
💘💘💘💘💘
We need Sebastian Stan to do this interview too🥺
We would love to see Måneskin playing with dogs or cats, please! ❤️
The the cuteness aggression 😂 I’m the same way lol
Chris 🫱🏼‍🫲🏿 puppies 😫😍
This is what you see when you go to Heaven. I'm 200% sure.
I'm pregnant now.
Why does seeing him surrounded by cute animals seem so fitting.
I love him !!!!
i just smiled for 8 minutes and 45 seconds straight
I love how his most complete and thorough answer was about dogs. I think he, like us, prefers dogs over humans
Thanks for the serotonin boost Buzzfeed!!
This....THIS is what the people have been asking for.... and we finally get it!! I actually gasped then starting clicking as quickly as I could onto the video!
i knew this is how itd go with chris...he looooves dogs lol.
“This is a problem *laughter* which one what?  *more laughter* , THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE!!?!?“    the way he just couldn’t contain himself and just kept on laughing 😭😅    *gets asked a question* :  “who cares” 🤌
I've been in a really stressful time lately, so thank you for making me smile with this. I hope all those dogs, especially the older pups find wonderfully loving laps to call their own soon. Thanks Buzzfeed, and thank you, Chris.
I just realized I was smiling that whole time while watching this ☺ Chris is so sweet and gentle 💙 It was so sweet of him to request to bring older doggos too.
THIS MADE ME SO HAPPY I CANT
This might actually be my all time favorite thing on the internet ever 😂😍
the fact that it’s just “chris evans plays with puppies” without the “while answering questions” pls thats so 🤌🏻😭❤️
BEST COMBO INTERVIEW EVER: CHRIS + PUPPIES + SENIOR DOGS!!😍
EU VIVI ATE HOJE PRA PODER VER ISSO NÃO AGUENTAVA MAIS ESPERAR 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!!! 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️

So far 97% liked this video
We all needed this.
Lol the way the title is just “Chris Evans plays with puppies” whilst others are “…..while answering questions”
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
I been waiting TO SEE CHRIS PLAY WITH THE PUPPIES 😭❤️for sooo long
I've never clicked so fast to watch a video
I need a Chris Evans in my life. He's such a gentle being! (And hot af of course lol)
FINALLLYYYY
This video single handedly cured my depression
The way I smiled throughout the whole interview
Let’s face it...we’ve all been waiting for this one!😂 What a heart warmer!
I was so confused as to whether to look at the puppies or Chris Evans. Both are so cute!😄
Like we did not love Chris enough already. How big the heart of this man is?
his voice when speaking to the doggies and his normal speaking voice..lol... everyone does it
chris is literally the sweetest guy ever. such a softie
What adorable puppies🥺
You should get Johnny depp on your show,he loves dogs
Aaaa😍❤️🥰Espere esto por mucho tiempo al fin 😍❤️que hermosos cachorritos junto al viejo sabroso 😏🤭😍me encantaaaaaaaa
Hahahahah Hamesworth would make me feel bad about myself🤣🤣🤣

I genuinely just squealed when I realise this was out
"You asked, you tweeted, you BEGGED", yep. WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
My heart and lady garden have exploded ❤️❤️❤️
This  w the best video I’ve ever blessed my life with!! 🥰😍🤍🤍

I’m in love with this man
Can this be like a yearly thing?!
❤️😍😂❤️😍😂
Perritos suertudos 😍😍😍😍😂
That last dog is so many women out there 🤣🤣🤣
Lmao I can't even read the questions because I'm getting distracted with the scenery 🤣
The interview we have all been waiting for
Chris Evans after every minute.......  Who caresss!!   Hii pall , hii pupppyyyy , hi buster , hi guysss........   Uahahahahahahaaaaaahahahhahahaaa😂    😂😂😂✌🏿
This video is now my happy place
The definition of cuteness aggression
I’m surprised he didn’t take one home
I want to be one of those dogs
Honestly I never watch these interviews for questions, I watch them for cuteness overload and celebrities being too distracted by puppies ;D
CHRIS EVANS + PUPPIES= BEST VIDEO EVER!!
OMG 1:48 ❤️😩❤️😍
this is literally the best interview ever🥺
AHHHH WE LOVE CHRIS AND DOGS
I also can't imagine anyone else to play scott, he's uniique ❤😂
I could watch this on repeat FOREVER
thank you buzzfeed. If anyone sees me rewatching this video till the end of time, mind your own business
this made me nearly pass away with cuteness. but, if we got kit connor and joe locke on a puppy interview...i might actually die
God, I feel ✨blessed✨
I would love if Chris...or any love interest just laid down beside me and said "let's build some trust" - Yes please!
this is how I imagine my husband 😩
I just have one sentece for Chris Evans: "Marry me"
I haven't watched it yet, why the feck is it only 8 minutes, Buzzfeed, explain yourselves.
1:10 the lil puppy whose foot was kickin while Chris rubbed their belly 🥹🥹
THIS IS EVERYTHING IVE EVER WANTED! Thank you Buzzfeed for finally giving this pure masterpiece too us! My new comfort video, 100%!! <3  Also, Chris just being completely overwhelmed with the cuteness, is how I felt watching this entire thing!! <3
FINALLY
Release all the footage pls BuzzFeed! 8ish minutes just isn't enough 🤣
i was never ready for this
his laugh is killing me
I can already imagine the edits popping up in my for you page on Tik Tok 😂😂😂
Now my heart feels full 💙✨
I WAS JUST WATCHING TOM HOLLANDS
Just when I thought I couldn’t love Chris anymore, he also asks to play with older dogs and to earn their trust. He’s the best.  🥰 🐕.  My rescue Hazel is the best decision I ever made to!
Probably sure our life should move on after seeing this video.  But wait…you just rewound this again….I know you did…like 100 times?  We always go back to pure joy.  Laughter is good medicine….and sometimes we just need Chris Evans and puppies and the senior dogs to give is a boost.
My cheeks are hurting for smiling over how right this is 😄. My question is why this wasn’t done sooner. It’s so adorable 🥰
i haven’t smiled this much in like 4 years.
adam driver as chris evans is just inception of my celebrity crushes and i truly don’t think i could handle it
I’m gonna be honest with you. I don’t think this world deserves Chris Evans.
This was my favourite video in the world before I even watched it.
Drink every time he says “hi” to the puppies
Best. Interview. Ever.
Yessss your finally posted it!!! I was looking for it since he posted on his Insta.
IM OBSESSED
THE PROPHECY IS FULFILLED.
easily the best interview ever,,, he’s such a sweetheart and so caring with all the dogs
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I agree with him. That was the best interview ever 💕  Also, nice job on getting the seniors in. I adopted two older cats, they were also 3 years old like Dodger. Kittens and pups are cute, but I like to give a home to the older animals. They deserve a forever home too 💕
Perfect. And even w/ an almost-10 minute interview, it still doesn't feel "long enough."
MY HEART IS BURSTING WITH SEROTONIN AFTER THIS 😭😭😭😭😭❤️
Yes.
Those puppies are so lucky.
Who's a good boy? Who's the best boy??? It's yooou, Chris!
This is what I’ve been waiting for! 😩❤️
3:57 "If you had to pick another Avenger to be handcuffed to for 48 hours, who would you choose?"  Chris: *gives a shout out to all the OGs except for Mark Ruffalo*
He’s such a gentle giant and warm soul. I laughed out loud when the pup went in between Chris legs in search of SNAUSAGES.😂😂😂😂
Best YouTube video yet 😂
When you let a puppy play with puppies. This is the cutest thing ever. Love this man.
Those pups just living the dream and they don't even know it lol
I just died and went to heaven! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I would pay good money to see the unedited FULL footage of this.
my ovaries are exploding i love this man
gonna watch this for the rest of my life
I’ve never wanted to be a puppy so bad 😭😭😩
he probably said "hi pal" and "hi buster" a hundred times and that is so sweet 😭
The best VIDEO buzz feed put up this year 🥹🥹🥹
This interview could cure cancer...
i concur, cast Adam Driver in everything <3 <3 <3
I need a one hour version of this
Finally! Thank you! Also, I remember Tom manifesting this interview. This is just great! 😍
Omgg
oh geez he is so very marriage material.
We, as a society, deserve this beauty after putting up with the past 1000 years
He's getting handsomer with age, isn't he?
This video is hella blessed and probably brings good luck just by watching it.
Dodger after the interview: “WELCOME HOME CHEATER”
It's everything I wanted it to be.
Bubba —- Dead. Deceased. 🥹♥️
8:15 well....... so cute btw
Omg I can’t even handle this! Why can’t I find a man like this?! 🥰
Buzzfeed is about to break Youtube 😍
To be a dog in this interview
I haven't even watched it yet and I already know that this is the cutest, most chaotic and most wholesome thing to ever exist
I’d have peed myself too when I saw chris evans laying down
HOW can you not love this man? My heart just metled!
"no disrespect to the puppies"  he cares that much???  he nice 🥰
This whole thing made my heart melt.
"No disrespect to the puppies."😭 Love my family's rescues.
IF I WERE THOSE PUPPIES I WOULD SNIFF HIS CROTCH THE WHOLE TIME. STUPID FUCKING PUPPIES.
I love Chris so much. I can’t even put it into words how much I love him. Thank you Buzzfeed.❤️😭
Thank you for blessing up with this interview 😊
Oh to be one of those dogs, especially the brown dog(Belle) that was licking him at 1:40 or the last dog at 8:14 that was going in on him😩🐕🐶
Que video mas lindo..me encanta!!!!! Me encanta!!! Me encanta!!!!!
🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
Expectations exceeded
I saw the video and I yelled I NEVER KNEW I NEEDED THIS IN MY LIFEEEEEE!!!
This video should be 30 minutes long 😭😭😭😭😭
This must be happiest moment in history
can we have Miles Teller now???
Fans have been requesting, nay, BEGGING for this in pretty much every single puppy interview since these started. They finally get their wish.   So when do they get the Thirst Tweets video they've been begging for?
My heart exploded ❤️❤️❤️
Welp I guess I found Captain americas weakness….puppies
Lucky puppies😆
The way he's practically vibrating with excitement before the puppies come out
I wish I was a puppy...
The fact that he called the dogs “Bubba” just warms my heart!!!! Seriously the best human<33
Am jalona of does puppies getting all does smooches wirh him hehehehhe so cute dodger is GANNA be jealous when he gets home he is GANNA be like dad what up
I’m not sure how I feel about that but I started crying when he invited the older dogs to come in
This video goes under my playlist titled “what to watch when you have a bad day”❤️
Finally it's here!! Love you zaddy 😘💕
this has made my day
Ok, I have been WAITING for this to be posted all week since I saw the teaser preview pics! Nobody else who would appreciate this interview format more than Mr. Evans 🥰 He is so adorable with the puppies but the fact he wanted to shine a light on the older, more mature dogs available to be adopted too just made my heart so happy 🥰 He is such a precious bean - this is my new favorite puppy interview 💖 💗 ❤️
Never thought I'll ever hear the sentence "No disrespect to the puppies" in my life.
I think he is going home with Buster
oh my god i love it! This video is the cutest thing I've ever seen. I love you Chris
This man is the death of me
I DO   !!! 💍💍💍💍💍
He can do this all day
I love this sm ❤️
My dogs name is buster and was the only validation I needed in my life to here him say buster brown just like I call my bubba
I'm gonna legally change my name to Buster.
OK, is everyone ovulating after this video?
💜💜💜
🥺🥺🥺
🤩🤩🤩
I'm dead! This is too much adorableness in one video and I love it😍😍 This is literally me whenever I'm around any type of adorable animal 😍😍 like who cares what the humans are up to when there's puppies around 😂
How is this video comforting but exploding my ovaries at the same time? I don't think there's anyone as hot and charming at the same time as Chris. 💌🛐
Now I want to be a Puppy 🤣
Comfort video? yes😭😭😭💕💕💕💕
This really IS the best interview ever! ❤️
Wholesome❤️❤️😭
this video saved 2022.
it took me about half the video to realize he was calling everyone buster and that none of the dogs were actually named that 🧍🏻‍♀️
NOTICE ME ❤️SENPAI❤️
OMG! 😍😍 I've been waiting so long for this interview and it did not disappoint! It was everything and more. And seeing THAT side of Chris Evans just made me love him even more. He reacts the same way I do when I'm around puppies. Lol
That's what I like to see when I pay my internet
FINALLY
"scarlett's my girl" <3
this is officially the sweetest thing on the internet, and with the older dogs? ugh i nearly cried, they're so precious (Chris included)
Now, i need Andrew Garfield on this interview 😫😫😫🫶🏻
This is without a doubt my favorite video on the whole internet
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS ONE, TURN IT UP
finally
The ultimate ‘is he husband material’ test. And yes, Chris, yes, you passed with full marks.
This is heaven
Finally! Thank you Buzzfeed! 😄
OMG THE BEST INTERVIEW I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO IT <3 <3 <3 CHRIS IS SO CUTE AWWWWWW
I have been waiting MANY YEARS for this. OMG 😭😭😭😭
FINALLY!!! LONG OVERDUE.....gawd this is an ultimate source of serotonin
I absolutely ADORE the way he calls every dog Buster or Buster Brown 😍
The serotonin that I received from this video 🙂
we NEED one of these with Pedro Pascal rn‼️‼️
in my 10+ years of loving this man, this interview just earned itself a place... like a really good one
THANK YOU BUZZFEED
I've been laying in a corner sobbing over this for over 20 minutes now
THANK YOU, Buzzfeed. Just. Thank you.
this is just adorable.
"Have I?" ....  -_-
I don't usually do this. But you have GOTTA DO A SEQUEL OF THIS. Yes, I mean Chris Evans and puppies AGAIN. In this tough world, we need such softness... You made this grown-ass dude melt throughout this video, thank you, Buzzfeed 😭❤️
Best 8:30 minutes of my life
Thank you buzzfeed for supplying me with unlimited happiness hearing this Man whole heartedly laugh surrounded by puppies is the highlight of my life. I will watch this on repeat until someone tells me to stop
He does not care ab the questions. He cares ab the puppies lol
i don't have words.
This is the best suggestion video I’ve ever had in my stupid algorithm. 10/10
8:15 that dog is living the dream
this man literally filled the whole in my heart
Him gaining trust of the older dogs and lowering his voice for them is the most adorable thing I've seen!❤️    Chris Evans: done Now a Tom Hiddleston interview with puppies would definitely heal me.
my only question is… why was this video only 8 mins 😭
OSCAR ISSAC PLS
I hope this breaks the internet
R they all called busta orrrr
The way that he did not change is puppy voice while answering the questions is so cute to me
I can literally imagine how the way he softly and excitingly said “hi” to those dogs as exactly how he’d say “hi” if we had a baby. Don’t get mad at me pls. I’m not much a fan of him. I just love how careful and adorable he is.
My HEART!!!!!
Best. interview. ever.  Now we need a  "Sebastian Stan Plays With Puppies"
His happiness is so contagious! I love him and I love the pups 😍
This video just added 10 extra years to my life span. You just can’t help but smile.
I think Chris asked the dogs more questions than he answered questions 😆
I need 8000 more minutes of this
yeah, i'll be watching this video again. 🐶❤️
Now we need Scarlett to play with the little ones too!
I love that the title is "Chris Evans Plays With Puppies" and not Chris Evans: The Puppy Interview. So cute! Hahaha
Y ES QUE TE AMAMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSS
I need a part 2
This was the best thing ever
that boy cap had women melting over this video.
This is quite possibly one of the best things I’ve ever seen
Yessss this is the most adorable interview. That I ever seen before
That is best interview I’ve ever seen
i just melted
I didn’t think I could fall in love with him anymore
Now we need Henry Cavill next😅
What took so long to get this collab?!
Has Chris Hemsworth done this type of interview?
Best video ever! So love how they have older dogs in for this like what Chris said older dogs need love and homes too ❤️🥰
So which one did he take home I’d like to know 🤔 Exactly how I’d be with all those puppies. Thanks Buzzfeed for this, brightens up the day 😊
"No disrespect to the puppies"
IM IN LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE WITH THIS GUY!!!!!!!! THANKYOUUUU BUZZFEEEEEEEEEEEEED
Love a man that loves dogs 🥹
this is the kind of serotonin i needed today
Chris Evans is my husband and baby daddy in an alternate universe. What a gorgeous man My God.
Why even bother with the questions? We’d be perfectly content to just watch him play with puppies for an indeterminate amount of time.
Only a Northeast boy would call a puppy “Buster Brown”.  So appropriate!  ❤️
How cute you wanna make this interview  BuzzFeed :- Yes very  As if little puppies weren't enough , Chris Evans also .
FINALLY!!!! 😂💓😂
My life has been made!!! Thanks buzzfeed!!! 😭🖤
And that's why we all love Chris !!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
seeing chris evans just hang out with dogs is the treat i didn’t know i needed
this video gives me soo much serotonin and it makes my heart so happy <3
Took me a while to realize the dark spot on the floor was the mark Chris Evans needed to stay on for the cameras and not a dog's mark.
I had the shittiest day of my week and just watching this I just can't stop smiling HE IS SOOO SWEET
oh to be a puppy MY GOODNESS THIS IS SO WHOLESOME
I think I have a cramp on my face I can’t stop smiling!
I love watching him play with them, like him, I'm too focused on the cuteness overload from both him AND the puppies to pay attention to any of the questions
THE WAY HE JUST CALLS ALL DOGS "BUSTER" 😭
omg imagine buying a puppy that Chris Evans played with🫢🥰
This is THE BEST thing I’ve ever watched 😍😍😍  And as grateful as we are, 8:45 is not enough, we’re gonna need the unedited version Buzzfeed
I mean I guess he did *technically* play Loki for all of about 5 seconds
I wish I was those dogs
This is the reason why we needed that! Thank you Buzzfeed! The Serotonin 🥺😭❤
now don't be shy, make him read thirst tweets
We’ve all been waiting for this!! 😍
I died of cuteness overdose. This is my ghost writing.
puppies have taste for sure
I can now die in peace after seeing Chris Evans be so gentle and caring with dogs 🫶
it's impossible don't feeling in love of this man❤
is this your new favorite video ever? yes.
oh man I hope he adopts that puppy with the blue collar it seemed like they had a thing going on!!
hi buster hi pal
This is like therapy. I pay good money to see a whole series of him playing with puppies and not answering any questions
I think this cured my depression 😌
I need Tom Cruise to play with these wonderful little puppies please ! !
Yeah I’m gonna watch this on repeat 🔁 I also didn’t pay attention to the questions being asked
never wanted to be a dog in my life so bad
Scarlett’s my girl - Chris Evans
my life is now complete.
I'm.... I.... This......Perfect!
That's his real laugh 😂😂😂
4:04 Scarlett's my girl - my heart
oh to be a puppy just to be able to play with chris evans
8:15 How does it feel to be living my dream. I would burn this world down to be that pupper
YAY! FINALLY! 🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🇺🇸
My day has been made my crops are watered my pores are cleansed 😭💖
Sweetest thing I've seen today 😭🥰 so adorable ❤
Imma get my leg twisted for this but Chris Evan with dogs is more wholesome than Tom Holland with dogs. Tom is a sweetheart and I love him  but Chris he is an angel he was so hyper and excited with the puppies and when he was given the older dogs he lower his voice and slowed his movements so he wouldn’t scare them. THIS MAN IS AN ANGEL and I love him. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
The most anticipated video of 2022
Chris with puppies is the best thing on the internet 🥺
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
my happiness is utterly derived from chris evans playing and laughing with his buster gang
SOBBING
Just when I thought I couldn't be more in love with Chris Evans 😍
That last dog is doing shit that everyone wants to do
The way he was with the senior dogs was so wholesome like my heart is so happy
Return of the Mack??? JAMAL 😂 istg
Quiero ser Chris y los cachorros todo al mismo tiempo 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
As a matter of fact , I’ll be rewatching this video multiple times 🥰🥰🥰
LMAO you can tell he's in heaven
All puppies are buster.
God i love him so much 😔🥹🫠💕
UEUWSDTWS SO CUTE
omg yes!!! adopt those senior dogs folks, the most love you will ever receive I promise!
I didn’t even realise I was smiling till my cheeks started hurting 😭this interview is everything
Best puppy interview ever
Hot guy completely in love with puppies. Is this porn? I feel like this is a porn  EDIT: RETURN OF THE MACK I NEED TO MARRY THIS MAN
This is the best pick me up video ever! Release the uncut version hahah
I would do ANYTHING to be one of those puppies right now 😍 best one yet! 🥹🥰
Let us all thank buzfeed, After centuries we finally made it happen chris evans puppy interview
Honestly I could watch every second y'all have of this. The whole thing.  RELEASE IT
Can we have one with Sebastian Stan
Hi please release an extended version of this. It would literally save me. Thank you!
I can't handle this, hi is a beautiful human being, the way he treats this little angels got me on tears 😭❤️
i want the uncut version of this
Im jealous of the pup at 8:14
My 2 y.o nephew loves Buzz Lightyear! He says, “To infinity and anon!” He’s so excited for this movie! He told me the other day “This my movie!!”
i want the one hour version of this
Honestly would not mind an hour long video of this man playing with puppies
When Chris laughs, an angel is given wings
eu tô tão feliz depois desse vídeo.
I did not see any puppies in this video
The fact that all the puppies gravitated to him at one point, shows the kind of person Chris Evans is 🥹
i just want him to know i LOVE return of the mack as well. we’re practically soul mates
this was definitely not long enough ❤️😭
Like I needed more reasons to be in love with him
PART 2
the one they've all been waiting for
💖💖💖
The most adorable video ever! 😍🫣
You know, logically my brain is saying this interview kinda went off the rails: very little got asked, even less got answered, and by the end you can barely even still call it an "interview." However, my heart is simply saying "It's perfect; I have no notes."
safe to say this was the best day of chris evans life
He’s so gentle with the older dogs and the one nervous pup.
Yeeess, Thank you Buzzfeed!
Omg I am lite dying…my heart is melting… those puppies are soooooo cute🥺and also Chris! Omg I can tell that he loves those dogs🥺
HE'S SO CUTE I CAN'T
Omg this interview is so adorable
8:18 I die!!!!!
Chris evans and puppies is all I needed today Thank you
That one is now named Buster Brown if it wasn't before
About damn time 😭
Chris' inability to fully answer any questions unless it has to do with dogs is EXACTLY how I would react in this situation 😂
I was acting like Chris Evans did in the interview while watching this interview!!!!!!!!! I loved it just as much as Evans loved playing with those puppies!!!!!!
Omg🤤… yeah that’s all I got to say
Dodger be like: 👁👄👁
I wanna have all the puppies !>>>>>> he’s so funny 🥹
Highlight of my day
stop cause I started crying when they brought the older dogs
I’VE NEVER BEING SO JELOUS OF A PUPPY
Lol the views and likes are 1:1 as I'm watching this
This is everything I hoped it would be.
When he said “Scarlett’s my girl” 🥰🥰
What a nice guy!
MY HEART IS MELTING AWAY
my cuteness aggression is through the roof rn. Buzzfeed really do be FEEDING us!!!!🥲
This is the cutest thing ♥️♥️ I love Chris and his love for dogs it makes me smile so much
took a while for me to be able to watch it cause so many people were already watching it , it wouldn’t play lmao😅🤣but it was worth having to wait a little longer , this was great i always loving watching the animal interviews with celebrities because it’s so raw an real to watch the interact with animals and try to answer questions❤️❤️
Puppies : *exist Chris: HAPPINESS OVERLOAD*
This is the best interview I have ever seen in my life. Absolutely precious.
every dog being named buster was the cutest and sweetest thing ever
I would say whoever thought of this interview idea is a genius but most celebs who do this aren’t even able to stay focused on the questions lmao
best one yet
i smiled the whole interview.
I love dogs but the training😥 I'll stick with my cat😉
Im not ungrateful for this video I loved it! But I wish there was a part two 😗🥺
i need the uncut extended bonus footage version of this
I want the unedited version of this interview 😂
He’s so high on puppy love ! This is the best  “play with puppies” interview ! ❤️
Chris a man puppy plays with dogs while not caring about anything in the world
That is the most fantastic thing I have ever watched my heart feels full now ❤️
Thank you Tom Holland and your manifestation powers. I've been waiting on this one!!!!!
Best interview ever!!!
Technically he got to play Loki
cutest human on the planet
I know he has anxiety himself, so he definitely knows how to calm anyone and make them feel safe, no matter if they're human or a puppy <3
In. Love.
That was amazing
BRHSDALKFjbh,kjbasfljhagbjfhgbJKHGBFLJDKHGBLKJUGSLKJDFGH!!!!!!!!

"Hi buster, pal. Look at that mug" 😂😂
To anyone reading this comment i hope ur as happy as Chris was during this interview ✨
I'm so pregnant
he's so excited ahshah, I love him
These puppies don’t know how lucky they are to meet Captain America
Just Chris Evans having a puppy induced meltdown.
I just can't stop smiling at this video, my face is frozen in this position :')
Chris's puppy voice shows more of his Boston accent and I'm loving it.
Awwwww
‘Scarlett is my girl’🥺🥺🥺
The sound of Dodger changing the locks 🔒
OMG IM DYING I LOVE THIS SM
This is the best interview I have EVER seen !!!!!!! This man is amazing !!!!!!! My heart melted !! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
im actually crying. THIS MAN IS SO CUTE I ACTUALLY NEED HELP BREATHING.
NGL, I would act the same way as these puppies if I ever met Chris Evans.
CAN U MAKE THE VID LONGER 😭😭😭😭
i love this interview. i love how chris still loves talking about marvel and it warmed my heart when he talked about downey. 10/10
That was everything I'd hoped it would be
This may be the most beautiful thing to ever be seen
this is exactly what the people needed
This is the best thing ever
Honestly the perfect man 😍😍😍
I am going to watch this video every day for the rest of my life
Eu entendo os dogs. Também lamberia o Chris Evans
Chris saying Adam driver just sent my lil nerd heart all aflutter ,,, someone put them together and add puppies and a girl( me)  will faint (and also rewatch over and over)
I LOVE THIS MAN SO MUCH!! HE IS JUST SO ADORABLE!  😭😭❤️❤️
💗💗💗💗💗💗
Finally I was waiting for this 🙌🏿
He is so darn perfect; can I be next I identify myself as puppy
My god my heart is melting 😍😍😍😍
IT FINALLY HAPPENED
We’ve been waiting.
this is single-handedly the best think i have ever seen
FINALLY! 😍
achei 8 minutos muito pouco por gentileza postem mais!
_We DEMAND the uncut version_
He’s such a husband-material person! Ughhh I want him to my husband so bad😭😭🥰🥰
Whoever his boyfriend is is so fbcking lucky ❤️
Finally it's here! Waited toooooo long for this!
He responded exactly they way I thought he would. Epic!!!!❤️💙❤️💙
THIS INTERVIEW IS A MOOD
finally the most expected interview!!!
Wouldn't be surprised if Chris went home with a sibling for Dodger.😂 I also got an ad about LightYear while watching this.
Cap'n always cheers me up,  and puppies, lol America! 🇺🇸
One successfully Chris Evans done, one Henry Cavill to go. COME ON BUZZFEED YOU CAN DO THIS 💪
Bless him. This was so cute 🙏🏻
I’m just imagining dodger when he got home like “you were with others dogs!?!?” I bet chris had to give him a lot of love getting home. Also this interview is everything I’ve never wanted something more than to see this its too ❤️🥰
I’m honestly shocked he answered a couple questions haha
I'll find an excuse to watch this everyday.
This just was not long enough, I need a 3 hour long interview of Chris evans and puppies
chris evans playing with puppies? my life is more than complete
AHHH HES SO ADORABLE 😭🫶
this is single handedly the best video i have ever seen
Shocked he didn't get piddled on!
i need to Kit Connor and Joe Locke in this interviews, please   🥺💜
Like I said. A literal five year old.
omg omg omg
1:03 im that puppy.....
I was just enjoying watching Chris play with these puppies I forgot to read the questions lol
Delightful! He’s such a sweetheart and I hope these dogs all find loving homes. I love my shelter dogs so much!
I can cry 🥹
no for real........... the love of my LIFE
FINALLY
I've been waiting for this interview for years and I mean it when I say the wait was totally worth it! Chris is such a sweet heart and him playing with those adorable puppies so enthusiastically is a pure joy to watch <3
This is truly exactly what I would be like at these interviews. At the end I'd be like "they're not available for adoption cause they're all mine"
This is free therapy
As if I couldn't love this man even more, he plays with dogs.
I never wanted to be a dog so bad
AWW CHRIS MY HEART
I have never been so absolutely in love with anyone ever
THE CUTEST VIDEO I HAVE EVER WATCHED
That giggling🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Just let the man play with the puppies for  10 minutes. Ask NO questions.
i died at 8:15
I'm halfway through one of the worst shifts of my life and this is the only shinning beacon of happiness of my whole day, so thank you buzzfeed, you have no idea how much i needed this right now... i'm genuinely tearing up...
Roma is like an hurricane…
this is the best video on the internet, dont @ me because i know im right
This is the best interview ever!!! 👏🏻🙌🏻
Just find yourself someone who adores you the way Chris Evans adores dogs.. This man has my whole heart..I just love him so so much.. ❤️❤️
After this , we want a "chris evans reads thirst tweets" video. Please !!!
He's the definition of perfection.😩💞 HE'S SO FREAKING ADORABLE WITH THOSE PUPPIES.🥵😍 THE 8:14 MINUTE KILLED ME THO 😂
this guy is a nut job 😂
This man is a gift that keeps on giving. I don't know if I am more jealous of him or the puppies. This might be what Nirvana is.  Such a genuine soul 🥰
Doctor’s orders: I need a Chris Evans puppy interview at least twice a year
I’ve been waiting for this
😍😍😍😍😍😍OMG!
Pure serotonin.
finally, what we've been waiting for
I haven’t even finished watching this yet and I already know this will be a comfort video for me lol
This is literally My new favourite video o
Let’s all be honest, we are not here for any answers. We just want to watch Chris Evans play with puppies and we all got what we wanted. The part with senior dogs is a bonus. ❤️ Thanks to everyone who was involved in the making of this heart warming video. I hope that all the cute pups and the lovely dogs will find new homes very soon 🥰
this is the evidence that Chris only doing Lightyear so he could go on a promo tour and be on this interview
This is literally My new favourite video
EU NAO QUERO MAIS SABER DE DEPRESSÃO!!!!!!
Finally ahhh
I was fully prepared to just watch Chris Evans play with puppies, I'm honestly amazed how many questions he actually answered
the way he talked about the senior dogs was literally everything
Thank you for my favourite video of all time. Bless your soul 😇
This is a level of cuteness I wasn't remotely prepared for 😍
LOOK AT HIM saying this is the best interview of his life! Do we know Chris or do we know Chris?
Boy his Boston accent has REALLY come out this year! Also, greatest thing ever and can we get Hemsworth in now? Because yes.
I wish I was that puppy at 7:48 !
Im in love
I’d rather play with kittens tbh…
YOU DONT KNOW HOW LONG IVE WAITED FOR THIS
Please have Henry Cavill play with puppies next 🥹
"good job bubba" MY HEART
" thanks for trusting me " no nope I'm not crying...
Absolutely love how Chris changed his tone for a better understanding with the older dogs! How empathetic!  Also thanks Buzzfeed! We waited for this for a long time.
This gave me so much serotonin. Thank you. 😊
Chris Evans is just here for the puppies. I've never seen anyone became so delighted and mesmerized with puppies. He's pupstruck. 🥺
Daddy
8 minutes is not enough Buzzfeed needed to give us more 😭
This video made me smile ear to ear ....it's just a boost of serotonin PS: Get him to read thirst tweets asap smh lol
Watching Chris Evans with puppies is one thing, but watching him try and build trust with older dogs is making my heat melt.
“I have to chill” and “excuse you” are by far the funniest parts of this interview 😭😭😭
7:27 😂❤️
post the uncut version right now.
Part 2 ASAP!:)
Are we gonna ignore the fact that he said "Scarlett is my girl"?✋🏻😳😂
This is the best interview ever!!!!!!!!
Who cares about the questions, there's PUPPIES! Such a mood lol
No one: Not a single soul: Chris Evans: WHO CAAAARRREEES?!?!!?
I’m in love. Can I be one of the puppies ?
BEST VIDEO ON YOUTUBE!
Him explaining that it can take more time to earn an older dogs love and trust is the best thing on the planet
This guy raises my standards for humanity wayyyyy too high
THE BEST INTERVIEW EVER! I WILL WATCH THIS IN MY WHOLE LIFE🥲❤❤❤
This is basically a video where Chris Evans gets distracted by dogs for nearly nine minutes and it's BRILLIANT!
"Hey, Buster Brown" Such a cute interview
Después de muchas súplicas por fin gra
The way that I would give this man every single dog/puppy in this world 😭😭😭😭
i hope chris knows he single-handedly broke the internet with this one
MY HEART. UFFFFF. this is so fucking adorable I cannooottt.
HI BUSTER! HI PAW!
We need more!!!! Maybe some outtakes 😬😬😬
“Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself” mood😭
can we make this into a series??? pls
Awww😍 Now all we need is Andrew Garfield ❤️
I CANT STOP SMILING
We waited so long for this! And we finally got it!!!!!!  I also wanted to add! He’s a major dog man. We all know that! 😂  Now we need Sebastian and Anthony! 😅 pls
I would gladly watch a full-blown movie 3 hours long of just Chris Evans playing with dogs, no plot needed.
Chris Evans and Dogs, thank you for making an old woman very happy, xx
I knew Chris's interview with puppies would be amazing. But when he was interacting with senior dogs I was in tears! "Thanks for trusting me" 😭❤️
8 minutes and 45 seconds of Chris Evans trying not to adopt all these puppies
am i the only one noticing those gray strings of hair in his beard?? Or am I just late and he had them for the last couple of years?
Here we have a golden retriever playing with younger puppies...😍
I'm gonna be coming back to this video probably 3 times per day from now on
I got a scratch too 👀
Instant serotonin
I love him so much 💕💕🥰
This is too wholesome 😭🙏🏼 we don't deserve this man
his laugh!! omg
This is the best puppies interview Chris has a really good heart not only did he show love to the puppies but he brought in older dogs too this was the most sweet interview Thank you buzzfeed for finally doing ❤️🐕🐶
i love this man
The serotonin this gave me
Guapo ❤️
he's about to explode
I love that Chris Evans also has cuteness aggression 😂 The fist of “I can’t take it they’re so cute” is so relatable 😂
This video’s gonna be big.   Like REALLY big   Like as big as the “Keanu Reeves plays with puppies” video was in 2019 big.
My Lord what a man.
So awesome that he asked for older dogs to join the interview too! ❤️
☺☺☺☺☺☺
This is the best interview ever 🤧😍😍😍😍🤧🥺🥺
Melted!😍🥰🤩🤗
The speed, at which I clicked this... man, this is gonna break the internet... and I'm a cat person. But I suppose that last part is ABSOLUTELY redundant.
Chris is so cute 😭🥺
Me closing my eyes and pretending he's whispering these names to me
I. Have. Never. Been. Happier.
It was unbelievably beautiful, I loved ✨✨
Ultimate clickbait shit. Hot guy with puppies? How many times can I physically both say “Awww” and cum?
This cured my depression
Dodger is going to be so upset. Chris coming home smelling of other dogs. How dare he cheat on the oh so adorable Dodger.
I love you Chris ❤️
Did you like this interview ?? 😍 Please search the one with BTS ,, You won't regret it I promise 💜
I can't! This is too cute!
i'm never ever going to be depressed after this. Thank you buzzfeed and chris for finally BLEEESSING USSSS
STOP my favorite song is Return of The Mack
liked CE before just for his acting creds. But seeing him here, with his OBVIOUS profound love of animals, the guy may just be my personal jesus lol. also, should I win the lottery, I would buy up apartments. lots of them. Cats & dogs would be in them. renters would get LOW rent on condition they A. kept the place to a good standard & - PRIMARILY! - B. cared for & Loved the animal/s in the apartment they rented. the Animal whose apartment they lived in. no pet, no lease. Sudden "allergies? take antihistamines or find other accommodation. The animal stays, regardless & come what may. I NEED to experience a swarm of Cats, Dogs etc, any and all ages. Buzzfeed! give me an animal-swarm interview!!! I DEMAND it! lol
Wait for this moment for a very long time, thank you 😭😭💙💙
I need the uncut version of this ASAP NO ROCKY
officially changing my name to “buster brown”
What wasn't shown was the Dodger Evans sniffest when Chris returned home.  "You cheated on me!"
thank you so much
My cheeks hurt so much 😍
From now on every dog i see is Buster 🤣
I AM MELTING AF
Admit it, we’ve all been waiting for this interview! Thank you buzzfeed and Chris Evans for agreeing to do this.❤️
Hi gus😋hi hi hi hi baby and THAT LAUGH is everything🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
His laugh omgg so cute
I ❤️ CHRIS
CHRIS EVANS PLAYING WITH PUPPIES YES
MELHOR VIDEO
Seeing Chris Evans play with puppy’s completes my life
It’s about damn time😂
Que amor!
My heart bursted omg!! This is beyond cute We need Sebastian Stan next PLS!!!!!
Where are these puppies🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺?
I didn't stop smiling once while watching this.
Puppies are great! Tim Allen should be playing Buzz Lightyear.
so this is what you see when you get in heaven
Concerned with all the people on set, hope no one got bruised too bad from fainting at seeing this happen irl.
this gave me so much serotonin thank u buzzfeed
I think we as a society need an uncut version of this interview. It would solve a lot of problems
FINALLY
"Who cares?" is such a mood. I didn't think Chris could be any more adorable...
Love how Chris came so beautifully dressed to interact with these precious animals.  RESPECT!
I love him so much
The thrown head back giggle fits the puppies sent him into were absolutely adorable. The cuteness will forever be unmatched. Beautiful lil furry ones, young & old alike. 😍
Chris evans + puppies = my therapy 😭
✨SEROTONIN✨
I now need him to do thirst tweets
let’s be honest, this is all we’ve been waiting for
MY LIFE IS FINALLY COMPLETE!!!
my uterus is on fire
This is what paradise looks like: Chris Evans and a bunch of dogs 💖
this whole video.....I- MY HEART CANT TAKE THIS CUTENESS😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Now we need one with Henry Cavill’
Best video on the internet! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
this video single handedly changed my life. the entire time i'm just 😇😫🤧
this is so cute
Oh to be a dog right now😭
I spent 8 mins and 45 seconds just smiling at the screen. Been waiting for this forever
I never thought I could be so jealous of dogs 🤣💓
He literally sounds drunk on puppies!
i love how the caption is just “chris evans plays with puppies” and not a chris evans puppy interview or smth because he barely answers any questions and plays with puppies 99% of the time
Chris, i too screamed at loud multiple times because of how damn cute you are, so i understand your reaction to the puppies perfectly
Parang gusto ko nalang kumahol.
I HAVE WAITED SO LONG AAAAHHH🥵🤍🥹🫡🫡
The Lord knew what he was doing when this man came to be lol. Whew… Bless his parents 😍💙
i cried😭
FINALLY!!!
I NEED another puppy interview with Chris Evans !!!!
If he doesn’t adopt Buster than I am disappointed
So how about Sebastian stan next?
Let’s take a shot every time Chris says “Buster” 😂😂
This was the best 8 minutes of my life! Thank you BuzzFeed! 🥰😍
i just see a big golden retriever playing with small pups, where is chris?
Oh to be a puppy….
My face hurts from smiling so much......I needed this 😁
Worst Chris in Hollywood
I didnt know i needed this video but wanted it?
You could've done 2 separate interviews yk? But we still love it as it is, thank you soo much and hope he'll get back to do this again soon.
Used to call my old dog buster brown all the time so that caught me off guard 😢. So jealous of the people that get to do these!!
FINALLY
ITSSS HERERERERER
Cute puppies and Chris Evans. Hold my heart.
I had the the Maya Hawke dog interview recommended to me just this morning and saw a comment on it saying they’d love one with Chris Evans cuz it’d be so chaotic like the former video. Weird yet really fitting timing that I see this only a few hours later on my feed, especially since I almost never watch these.
i'm gonna be honest here, i did not pay attention to a single question. i could just watch a video of him playing and petting the puppies 🥺
hello sir, I am a prop
OUR DAY HAS COME.
Everybody, for years: Buzzfeed, make Chris Evans read thirst tweets! Chris Evans: No thanks, just gimme the puppers
obviously this is the best thing i have ever seen! toooo cute!!! thank you buzzfeed for making this happen!!!! can you try get Sebastian Stan next??
Who remembers tom saying he should come 🥺
Chris Evans can play with MY puppies 😏😏😏
he's so gentle
puppies living my dream
you broke the internet Buzzfeed, congratulations AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE
my heart❤😭
I’m-
Why only 8 minutes? I could watch this ALL DAY! 🫠
Dodger is packing he's things right now💀.. Dodger cannot resist this behavior..
Chris Evans living his best life
Literally best interview ever!   You can tell Chris is filled with pure happiness and love for all those dogs and I agree about adoption for older dogs. Me and my partner adopted a older boy at the of 10 years old and we couldn't be happier.  Adoption is such a beautiful thing in all matters
Too cuteeeeeee
this interview is literally my only happiness
Now this..this is content..
😭💙
“Scarlett’s is my girl” 💞💞💞
the ASMR at 6:57 ugh 😂😍♥️
I could literally watch an hour of this lol
Chris as soon as he sees a dog: HI BUSTER!!! HI PAL!! In all seriousness the way he calmed his voice for the older puppies so that they don't get frightened of him makes my heart MELT
He truly is just a gem of a human being. ❤️ Calling all the dogs “pal” and “buster”😂😂😂
ok but imagine chris handcuffed to falcon and just be held on by handcuff while falcon is  flying in the air
This is the single most greatest, adorable thing I have EVER seen in my entire life😭
Did anyone else cry when they brought out the senior dogs and he was so gentle with them??? 😭😭😭
Adorableeeeee ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is the best video that I see in my live. Please more videos of chris with dogs🥺🥺🥺🥺❣❣❣❣
😩😩😩❤️❤️❤️❤️
These puppies are definitely his reincarnated fans as puppies
This was the only dog interview I was expecting for YEARS, because he ADORES dogs so much!!! and now that it's here Ngl I shed a little tear out of cuteness overload. This is my new comfort video
His voice is like listening to satisfying ASMR I love him so much ❤️❤️
baby
crying
thanks for also thinking about old buddies that need a family too <3 I melted watching this video
SCREAMING FINALLY
This could very easily be the most wholesome video on the internet pleaseee 🥺🥺😍💖💖
This man is going to be the death of me but “who cares”
This man is going to be the death of me but “who cares”
Everybody say: Thank you, Buzzfeed
did he just said, and I quote, “SCARLETT IS MY GIRL” IM LOSING IT.
I didn't stop smiling until long after the video ended. This was more than entertaining!
this is the CUTEST video ever
now that we’ve gotten a taste, I NEED the uncut version
interview: *insert question* chris: who cares
oh to be um doguinho lambendo a boca de chris evans
This video is a serotonin booster
Wish we could have more than 8:44 seriously ;;
Let’s make this a yearly event. Or monthly. Or weekly. I wouldn’t mind 😭
So cute…we literally don’t deserve Chris Evans!! Love him!!!
I've been waiting to see this interview! Thanks!💜💜💜💜
Cap could barely answer his questions when he is surrounded with a lot of adorable puppies.
I love him!
Evans went to play with puppies nothing more nothing les🤷🏻‍♀️😂
This is my new comfort video. thank you.
OH MY GOD IM MELTING
I have been waiting for this one 🥰
Wow, so comparable to the show "Hot Ones" and so the opposite! Very cool!
I am jealous...both ways!
I bet Dodger was smelling the crap outta him after this! Lol
I want a Chris Evans puppy and only a Chris Evans puppy 🥹🥹
Omg thank you so much for thissss
Where is this dog shelter I need to get myself a dog that Chris Evans has touched with his bare hands
I was waiting for this Interview so bad, I love how he treated the puppies and his energy. He looks so humble and lovely. 💙
A puppy surrounded by puppies !!!
Thank You for this! Now give us Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie, TOGETHER, with puppies.
And that was the day Dodger Evans got 10 new brothers and sisters who were all named Buster Brown 😍😂
This is so precious ❤️❤️❤️My heart I love him so much
Did I cry when the older dogs came out? Well of course 🥲🥹
The who cares?! Killed me lmaoooo i love him so much ❤️❤️❤️
Best video ever
cheesing through the entire video tbh
THE BEST INTERVIEW EVER
The video we all needed 😭✨
PLEASE DO A PUPPY INTERVIEW WITH SEBASTIAN STAN!!!!!!!! 💜💜💜💜💜 My heart would die.
My new comfort video 🥹🥹🥹💜💜💜💜💜
the world has been fixed
And any anxiety I was feeling is now gone. Chris Evans + Puppies = joy
this is the most wholesome thing i have ever experienced in my life
He really didn't answer questions with the puppies. I think he only answered two, and then kept getting distracted by all the cuteness🥰🥰 .............i want a dog!!
Husband material
Love how he had to contain himself 😭😂😂😂
“Which of your fellow co stars have you learnt from the most?”   I knew he was gonna say Downey right after reading the question 😭❤️
He's so adorable I can't even 🥺💖🥺💖
omg
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS INTERVIEW FOR FAR TOO LONG! I am squealing in the inside, like a 5 year old. 😂 How dare Chris Evans be so wholesome with puppies! I love this guy. 💙 If you read my comment, give your dog (If you have one) a big hug and tell them they are the best dog in the whole world. 😘
This should have been "Chris and Dodger's interview with puppies"
Finally
"Who cares" 😂😂😂😂 never forget JAJAJAJAJJAA
oh my heart! I love this so much 🥰
Hey God…  It’s me again…
Dodger when Chris gets home: WELL WELL! WELCOME HOME CHEATER! I CAN SMELL OTHERS DOGS!
buzzfeed i'm begging you please release the unedited footage, you can do this
Requesting the full interview thank you.
This is just beatiful for my eyes!🥰
He’s been wanting to do this for so long
Chris's accent coming out every time he calls a puppy "Bustah Brown" is giving me heart palpitations.  <3
This whole video was cuteness overloaded. I'm coming to this video from now on to cheer myself up whenever I feel sad.
him talking so softly and being so gentle with the old dogs is melting my heart
I just can't even handle it. Watching him with the senior dogs brought me to tears.
“Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself”😂
THIS 👏 WAS 👏 LONG 👏 OVERDUE 👏
The folks loosing it over his Boston accent the other day aren't ready for this. It's out full force!
i didn’t learn anything about chris evans from this interview but i’m not complaining
now i can die in peace....
i have never felt joy quite like i did watching this
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!!!! 🥺🥺🥺🥺🤗🤗🥰🥰
I WONDER how many people would wish to trade places with the puppies.
MY LIFE IS FINALLY COMPLETE. THANK YOU
I just want to watch Chris play with dogs for hours!!!!
I hope that one day he gets Dodger a brother or sister. 🤭❤️
he feels like he has to respect the puppies!! and he says thank you to puppies!!! he’s so perfect
5:26 this did something to me
It’s a crime that this interview is only 8 minutes long
his laugh>
I watched through and literally just started crying. This is wildly adorable. Chris is wildly attractive, warming, and admirable. The older dogs are such a perfect touch for this as it parallels Chris' connection with Dodger. Ahhhhh this man is my biggest crush and this really was a pure comfort interview. Chris is right....this is the best interview ever. Nothing else will match. 💙
This is the best interview of all time
the fact that he doesn’t even look at the camera ONCE cause he’s so fucking distracted by the puppies
my favorite video on the internet
Finally
That Guy Looks Like Jensen Ackles.
I bet Dodger gave him the Look of Betrayal when he went home XD  Edit: another thought occurred to me - do you think they checked to make sure he didn't stick any puppies up his jumper before leaving?
i cant breathe
I had a huge smile on throughout the video. ❤️❤️❤️
Not even a minute in and I can't with his puppy voice, I'm like melting, gone. He's sooooo adorable, why did it take so long for him to do this? and can he just come ack again and do another lol Oh, and Sebastian Stan!
This is the absolute best video I have ever seen
Don't give Chris the task of naming animals apparently ALL of them will be called Buster 😂😂😂
i dindt know i needed this soooo much in this life but OMG these were the best 8 minutes of my life watching this hahaha
Here come the fan girls to gush over him🙄        I am here✋😊
Finally! The puppy interview we've all been waiting for!
I love that Chris clenches and shouts a little whenever the cuteness was too much to handle! Like I get it, I totally get it
His laugh makes me smile he is amazing
I've never seen anyone have so much fun with the puppies! Evans's laugh and smiles are iconic!
you know you are downloading it for your comfort vid when it's Chris Evans playing with puppies and loving it like anything!!
I’m in love  Are you in love
Omg not the open mouth dog licking ☠️ewww
YASSSSSSSSS THIS IS MY EVERYTHING
Give Chris an interview every year please!!
Love that they bought in older dogs this time
OMG
I think I've just found my new comfort video ❤ Chris is such a precious human being 🥰
This interview was beyond amazing! Not only because we got see adorable puppies and senior dogs playing with Chris, but I felt like Chris was being his authentic self. It had to pause and rewind so many times to witness the cute interactions
why was i sure he wouldn’t be able to answer almost anything when surrounded by dogs? 😂
My heart 😭
Chris Evans is yes.
I am a puppy !, I am a puppy !, Pick me up please ! 🥺
this was the best puppy interview, there’s no topping this
A puppy playing with puppies
Oh I’ve been waiting so long for this and was not disappointed
Dodger after this interview: “Welcome home cheater 😠”
HE IS SO CUTE HELP 😩
"Hi, hi! Come get it. Come get it" ......um. yes, sir.
Can I petition for buzzfeed to get Theo James to do this? 😁
THANK YOU FOR THIS AMAZING VIDEO 💕💕💕💕
Who knew we needed this interview!!!!!😭😩😍❤️❤️❤️❤️ I LOVE YOU CHRIS EVANS❤️ I want to see Barry Keoghan next😍😍
Sarah catherine hook and Imani Lewis should get to do that too...and with Kittens too
omg i have waited for this my whole life
Chris responding to every question with, "who cares", is precious
I never wished I was a puppy so badly in my whole life.
Did anyone’s ovaries survive? Also, thank you, Buzzfeed, for including senior dogs. As Chris said, they’re often overlooked at shelters.
he's so overwhelmed it's adorable
Este hombre es un sueño hecho realidad,la felicidad que tenía al estar con los cachorros. Creo que estoy enamorada 😍
Omg I love him 😍
This is the best day of my life
My new favorite and comfort video
i wish i was one of the puppies
pls Lily Collins next 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Chris Evans _IS_ a puppy 🐶 😍
why did i start crying i need help
Chris Evans being completely sidetracked and blissed out playing with puppies and completely (accidentally) ignoring the interview portion gives me enough serotonin to last a lifetime
THIS. IS. THE. BEST. PUPPY. INTERVIEW. EVER. Roger is shaking right now!
Omg, I want like an hour of this!!
FINALLY!!!!! <3 The way Chris is unable to process how cute all the puppies are is basically the fans reaction to him!
I loved All the puppies but in all honesty Chris was my absolute favourite puppy
Honestly impressed, homie managed to answer all the questions.
One of my favorite humans! I think Dodger Evans is ready for a sibling...
I have never clicked a video faster in my entire life
We finally got it!
I love this man
Im not drooling
I will bark if I have to..
im watching this every night when i go to sleep
This is the best video on the internet. Period. The end
I have been waiting for this moment. How long? It feels like a lifetime. My expectations are exceeded. Huzzah!!
The best thing ever!! Wow, he is so amazing.  The senior dogs just broke me!   Love this!  Thank you!
Just adding another "I'm single" comment. Cause ya know, that's where Chris is looking. The comments. 🤷‍♀️
It's nor fair!!! WHY IS THIS VIDEO  8 MINUTES LONG? 💙😭😭😭🤣 idk but maybe everyone wants a part 2. Pleeaaaaase🌟🌟🌟🥲👍🏻🐶

His laugh is... A lot.
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Please bring NIALL HORAN for this interview!

I am genuinely so in love with this interview.  It warms my heart to see both Chris and puppies but also the senior dogs together, I love how he was so accepting and how he took his time with the seniors. It really shows the kindness that he’s filled with, I will not recover from this interview at all but in a good way. Whenever I am feeling happy, sad or anything this is what I’ll be watching to get a smile on my face.  I hope that everyone enjoyed this and I am so glad that he’s able to bring happiness to so many people out there, thank you Chris and every one else 💕

Okay from this point i just want to be one of the puppies 😝😅
I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I started crying when he looked at the old dog and said “thanks for trusting me” 😭
He fell in love with bustred
I’m dead This is the best thing ever
Chris ❤️❤️❤️

The best 8 minutes, forty-five seconds of my day...Thanks Buzzfeed for having this precious man with heavenly doggies 🐕 ❤🐕🐶
he’s such a fella!! i’m gay but if i ever had to date a man he would have to be just like chris evans, i swear.
I don't know who I'm more jealous of those puppies or chris evans. I loved this interview so much it warms my heart and makes me love the man even more
We need a part two immediately!!
This is too adorable pls.... <3
Them: How many times have you watched this?  Me: Yes.
i love him so much, it physically hurts me.
My heart needed this ❤
This is the best interview EVER
Finally. My dreams have come true.
Meu Deus o homem tá totalmente cheirado, tá a lombra pura kkkkkkkkkk
He wasn't kidding when he tweeted twice that he didn't answer a question loll
Moist
YAAAAAS! it's FINALLY here! The Lord has answered our prayers!
What I’ll remember of this interview: *wHo CaRes*
YESSSS
From someone working in animation, you definitely have the cooler job. At least from this side, but the grass is always greener eh :P
This so heartwarming 💕 ❤️
ADORABLEEE 😭🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
Gosh, him with the senior dogs was so sweet. What a beautiful and sensitive soul.
He just became my favorite Chris
"Only Scott can play Scott," would have been my answer too. 😄
Find someone who looks at you the same way chris evans looks at puppies
New comfort video!!!
Senses overload 🤯🤯🤯🤯⚰️⚰️⚰️🌈🌈😈😈
Chris saying who cares while playing with the puppies Had me laughing
"No better feeling than earning a dogs trust" I love that quote.
I'm here way too soon ON PURPOSE!
I JUST CRIED THIS IS JUST TOO MUCH OMG 😍❤️ Thank Buzzfeed for doing this 🥰
HES SO CUTE. MY GOD.
Please tell me Chris Evans took Buster home!!
OH NO WHATS HAPPENING TO ME 🚶🏽‍♀️🧎🏽‍♀️🐕   WOOF WOOF WOOF
Que hermosuras! ❤️😅
I absolutely love that they brought senior babies into the interview. Of course, puppies are always delightful! But like Chris said, it's really rewarding to earn the trust of an older dog who's already been through so much. There's nothing else quite like it. Same goes to any other older animals that get rehomed/adopted later in life!! I hope ALL of these precious furbabies find wonderfully loving homes.
If y’all don’t get joe locke and kit connor down there
THE WAY HE TALKS ABOUT SCARLETT, AND CALLING HER MY GIRL, I MELTED
please let there be a part 2, this was such good serotonin <3 thank you buzzfeed
this is the best thing i have ever seen. thank you buzzfeed.
I'm so thrilled that Chris did this puppy interview.  The interactions were incredible.  He really loves dogs and I wonder if he would have adopted another dog?  Love this
just... thank you
So good!!!
finally we have this video 🫶🏾
this is my fav video ever
my heart just melted
1:46 i would also do that if chris evans made eye contact with me lmao
The fact that they named the interview Chris Evans playing with dogs  I can’t 😭😂
this is the best day of my life
the cutest video ever
I can watch this all day
Quick question: Is it possible to re-record this interview while Chris meets new people? I volunteer! No kidding: Chris Evans is such an interesting individual, a conversation with him would be so nice
IVE WAITED FOR THIS EVER SINCE TOM HOLLAND SAID IT
💖💖💖
anyone else forgets to read the questions because you're watching the puppies and then you don't know what the answers mean and have to rewind?
The only interview we will ever need. I am surprised it took this long honestly.
TURN IT UP
petition to give us the unedited version
IM ??   crying actually
Hii
Me smiling across my whole face the entire interview describes everything I felt while watching
this is it. i have NO reasons. i will be staying alive from now on!
Me smiling across my whole face the entire interview describes everything I felt while watching
He definitely agreed to this for the puppies. In fact he prioritized above all other obligations  Then that man FOUGHT FOR HIS LIFE not to take "Buster" home
THIS THE BEST THING EVER
I don't think this will be his last puppy interview😂 he’s in heaven
OOOHHH OMG FINALLY OMG 💗😭😭

Yo
this has made me immeasurably happy!
This is just too cute 😂🥰🐾 I love the fact how they brought out old dogs instead just having the puppies out all the time ❤️🐾👏
I love seeing Chris in his natural habitat
As I say to myself... can I love him even more? Oh wait... now he's interviewing with puppies!! <3
This interview was everything I hoped it would be! You can’t help but love Chris Evans. Best answers: “who cares?” And “probably Return of the Mac.” Great song choice!

I did say in the jake gylenhaal puppy interview that having Chris evans do this you’d get zero questions answered 😂 and it finally happened!
the serotonin level is at its peak after watching this interview
Chris' laugh is amazing!!
I remember the Tom Holland Part Two when Chris was pissed bc he hadn’t done it yet and Tom did it twice😂
nvm im gonna die
AAAAA
this was the most adorable interview EVER!!!
How can I adopt all the puppies that licked Chris?
Me to the puppies “HOW DOES IT FEEL TO LIVE MY DREAM?!”
7:50 respect to the Adam Driver 💙🦋reference, I could not love them both more than I do now
Am I the only one smiling like an idiot 😍😆 while watching this ?
Everyone talking about the dogs abs him. Me : “he said scarlets my girl” AHHHHH
this is honestly the best thing i’ve ever seen
I can't believe it took me this long to realize he is from Boston. Now, all I hear is Boston 🤣
Been waiting for this
A man that can have bulging muscles while holding on to a helicopter and be the sweetest guy in a sea of puppies... that's a DREAM man for sure.
daddy
Prior watching this video I knew that would be heaven for Chris XD. I simply loved when he said: "Scarlett is my girl", that's a friendship.
YESSSSA FINALLYYYYYYYY YESSSS
I've never wanted to be a puppy so much in my life
why was this not an hour at least 😭
Now all we need is Sebastian Stan to do one and I can die happy
Thank you Buzzfeed😭😭😭
This interview exceeded my expectations 💙💙
Best interview ever! This man just loves dogs and is so adorable and I’m here for it!
“Buster Brown” 😍
I can rest now

The puppy that peed would be me if I met Christ Evans 😂😂😂
THESE PUPPIES SHOULD BE ME 🫣🥹

I wonder which living being wouldn't want to lick this face
Am I the only one who doesn’t read the questions and just watching Chris with the puppies ?
He really didn't lie when saying he wasn't answering any questions 😭
the cutest video I ever seen 😭💘
I think Cher playing Scott would be great
Bendita sea la tuerca del rin del eje de la llanta de la caja del camión que trajo el cemento para hacer el piso donde estás parado pedazo de monumento!!! 🤩🙌🏼

i love that he didn’t care about questions just the puppies!!
This video is too much for me!!!!💖💖💖
Thank you for having the senior dogs on. I used to rescue and foster and it means a lot to see the older animals needing homes recognized. They're so wonderful.
I’ve dreamed of this day and it’s finally here
FINALLYYYYYYYY
he is adorable and the puppies are adorable too
So... IS THIS HEAVEN??? 😍🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶
Chris Evans was 14 when Toy Story came out.
BuzzFeed do you think we can get Chris reading Thrist Tweets?

"Welcome home cheater" 🤨  - Chris Evans' dog Dodger when he gets back home after this interview 😅😅😅

8:14 puppy living my dream😩✋🏾
YES
This has officially became my favorite video ever!!! I get Chris Evans and puppies in one video! Together!! 🥹😫💙
Imagine Dodger after watching this video: "....you cheater."😂😂😂😂😂
This was the cuddliest litter of pups ever and I think chris' energy had a lot to do with it
I wish he would talk to me like that 🥺🥲
"Thank you for trusting me, bubba" I'm in tears, it's all I have to say
The dog at the end had the right idea sniffing his crotch. That’d be me 😗
Absolutely no one                                 Chris Evans:                          “Who cares”
THIS MADE MY LIFE WAAAAAY BETTER
Chris + dogs = happiness
We demanded for literal years and here we are and it's amazing!! *insert Paul Rudd* Look at us? Who would have thought?
i definitely need to chill while watching this interview, also not the two dogs fighting each other over chris LMAOOOO
i love him sm omg
How is this not breaking news?
*Asks question* Chris: WHO CARES!! 🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶
now all we need is him reading thirst tweets. and not the vanilla stuff either
dodger must feel so betrayed, but I in fact do not feel betrayed and have been waiting for this for YEARS. thank you buzzfeed.
we all know that dodger now has younger sibling
This is what heaven actually looks like! ♥️
Changing my name to Buster
Questions answered? None  Seratonin given? ALL OF IT
Best interview ever! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 I love that Chris played with puppies and senior dogs.  Older dogs often get overlooked and it's such a shame. Yay for Chris talking about older dogs and how earning their trust is super special. I could not agree more!! Chris needs to do this interview for every new movie that he promotes!! Make it happen BuzzFeed!!!
i’ve been waiting for this one
He is such a sweetheart
Thank you Buzzfeed
Him calling the older pupper "BUBBA" so softly is gonna be my forever comfort❤😭
Literally Return of the Mack is what I play in my head when I enter any new environment. This interview is cute 🖤
Papasote quien fuera esos perritos 😍🤤
FINALLLYYYYYYYYYYYYYY! My biggest crush on the planet surrounded by a swarm of adorable puppies! Thank you for listening to the CRY of Cevans Nation and gifting us this masterpiece. Gaaaaah. I want him so bad. This is perfection. 😍😍😍💙💙💙💍💍💍

That one puppy nuzzling Chris' crotch HELLOOOO 😭 let me
What I’d give to meet a guy to look at me the way Chris sees puppies
Oh God, I never envied a puppy so much
finally!
Chris's laugh is the best seriously!
Oh DADDY 😫
How do I become a puppy
Chris is too busy playing with puppies to answer questions, and we are totally OK with that (myself included). Protect this legend at all costs!
WE (AND CHRIS). GAVE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS
Alright let’s do this.
this interview will have my whole heart
The scream I literally audibly scrumpt
This was all I needed to be HAPPY, me and all Chris Evans fans are the happiest right now, thanks buzzfeed
8 minutes it’s definitely NOT enough
I have waited for this day to come my husband finally … next up is hemmy wemmy xxxxx
I can die in peace now🥹❤️
Yes! It's finally here! We have been waiting for this and it did not disappoint! This video has cured my anxiety, cleared my skin, my hair is full and healthy. We have been blessed by the beauty and laughter of Chris Evans and the doggos. Thank you! lol
I don’t think he answered a single question but I’m living for this
The literal definition of *wholesome*
I’m crying
I’ve been smiling for 8 minutes and 45 seconds straight

Omg thank you, Chris is just too much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
RELEASE THE CEVANS CUT!
That was possibly the best 8:45 of my life. I smiled and laughed the entire time. I cannot describe my joy!
This was so fulfilling and heartwarming I almost cried 🥹 I need the full uncut version
I've been waiting for this 9 minutes interview for weeks
YES YES YES!!! I have been waiting for this!!!! I adore this man. This is the greatest video on earth
OMGGG I LOVE THIS MAN SO MUCHHHHH 😭😭😭😭

His genuine excitement makes my heart so full. What did we do to deserve this man? 💙💙💙
2:11 to 2:35 that's it. the most adorable moment of all puppies interviews. i can't stop smilling. chris evans laughing and being showered with love by the puppies.
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE WAITED FOR FOR SO LONG AND FINALLY WE ARE RECIEVING
okay ITS OFFICIAL THIS IS NOW MY FAVORITE VIDEO TO EXIST ON HERE!!!
I can feel the internet breaking and the frothing of many mouths
This just made my day.  The love he has for them is an awesome and over whelming.  And his smile and laughter is so genuine. He's in dog heaven.
him getting frustrated that he couldn't play with all of the puppies is the cutest thing ever
Omg
omg them puppies be mad lucky and l totally be jels l adore him and think he be a wicked sexy and a funny fella l also has 13 of his movies well 15 if'n ya count battle for terra and tmnt that he done the voice of a character in

WHO CARES had me laughing 😂. Chris had no idea what questions he was even answering and he couldn’t have cared less, because the puppies was all that mattered.
the long awaited puppy interview has finally arrived
I CANT STOP LAUGHING WHEN CHRIS GETS CUTENESS AGGRESSION😂😂😂😂💓💓💓💓💓
we need an uncut version of this NOW
I'm squealing this is so cute!!! 🥹❤️
Chris is the absolute best
It's just something with men and puppies. They bring out the kid in them, while elsewhere they would be professional and to the point, infront of the puppies they become kids themselves
Finally it's here! The video we were all waiting for! It's basically a golden retriever playing with puppies 😆😄. This is just too precious. ❤️ I love that he just gave up answering the questions 😄😄😄. The puppies are too powerful
THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO I EVER SAW 😍😍 How can he be so perfect ?!

Chris saying "Who cares?" For every question is a mood when you're surrounded by puppies
We have been waiting for this interview for ages.... The day I heard some rumors of Chris featuring on BuzzFeed with puppies since then I've come here every single day to check if the video has been uploaded or not.... Finally, it is here, I can die happily 😭❤🦋🐶

This was great. Do it again 🤣
THE BEST INTERVIEW EVER
Best video ever

Omg I just died why is he so cute
FINALLY
Chris Evans doesn't need to answer questions, watching him play with the puppies is enough to convince me to buy tickets for Lightyear
I’ve been waiting for this for YEARS 😭😭
this is pretty much exactly how I expected this interview to go. it's close to a miracle he was able to answer any questions at all. :-D
Had to rewatch that after the premiere. He's too cute. That brown senior dog is 🥹. 💙 Thanks BuzzFeed!
SEM A MENOR CONDIÇÃO DE VIVER DEPOIS DESSE VÍDEO
This is soo wholesome 🥰 This might be the best puppy interview ever👍🏻 And it also went exactly as I expected it to go😂

FINALLY THANK YOU
we need Andrew Garfield to do this
I love Chris smmm and love that BuzzFeed put “Chris evans playing with puppies” instead of putting answering questions
My literal dream, thank you Buzzfeed. WHAT WE’VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. You fulfilled our hearts with this (and Chris), this it too much to consume! 🥹
Who, cares~
he was there for the puppies and the puppies only
So freaking cute!!!!!!🥹🥹🥹🥹✨

Zendaya puppy interview 🙏🏼
I love Chris Evans, but all I could see was gorgeous dogs. I would love to be there, puppies crawling all over me. I'd say Hi to Chris, too, but after.
8:15 that dog is JUST like me 🤭
MY HEART NEEDED THIS  💓
the last puppy’s little ears 🥺
"Scarlet's my girl, Renner would be trouble, Downey would be a lot of fun, Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself" Captain Rogers about his fellow Avengers is my favourite thing😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤
chris evans + puppies = all is restored in the world
I'm simultaneously jealous of the puppies and Chris.
Next dream person to play with puppies is Harry Styles please have him on here one day!
It’s so cute I wanna cry 😭
I'm just dead. He is the sweetest man on earth. ♥️♥️😍🤧😭😭 The love he gives. Omg.  The puppies just love him. I think i deserve someone like him. I deserve to be loved like this. How can i meet a man like him? 😅 And where
Internally screaminggg….return of the Mack sir 😂
How adorable!! 😍😍 We can make a drinking game out of it. Drink every time he says "hi", "pal" and "buster"!!! 😁
He can't concentrate on the interview with all these cuties around him 😂 Look at this precious at 3:21 🥺
this video got me smiling for 8 minutes straight
He is so adorable, omg this the most wholesome thing ever
There is no getting to chris evans when he has dogs around x
The way he say "uuuuuhhhhh, GOD!"  I felt that EVERYWHERE.  Serotonin boost injection commencing. ❤️
this man is already so fine and then with the puppies too... ✨chef's kiss✨

We owe Tom Holland a debt of gratitude for being the spark that lit this flame
3:22 Did I hear Chris say he wanted to be an animator when he was younger?!?! Cause that’s what I want to be right now, and I still do… no matter how hard it is.
the live chat was so unhinged for the premier and i loved every second of it

The moment in this video where I thought I died and went to heaven: 00:01 The moment in this video where I actually died and went to heaven: 8:28
finally.
La entrevista más esperada por todo latinoamerica unida. 😍😍😍😍
This is everything I hoped it would be.
I am beside myself
Me when chris called scarlett his girl😍😍😍😍😍😍 Me when chris called scarlett his sister🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
This is highly unlikely, but in case anyone doesn't understand the hype for this interview: it's well known, specially amongst his fanbase, that Chris Evans absolutely _loves_ dogs.
FINALLYYY
this is the best day of my life
It will actually be watching this on loop for hours now actually. Don't mind me. i love this so much.
Can we get a petition started for the uncut version of the interview !
This video is so heartwarming, soothing and fun... I LOVE THIS VIDEO THANK YOU BUZZFEED ❤
I’m jealous of belle lol
who was in the live chat ??
1:05 I literally can’t 😂❤️ 1:49
it’s the puppy at the end for me
Only 8:45 minutes! 😭 why does Chris Evans only have a shorter clip than the rest of the Avengers?!?!?
note chris can not be with another chris or with dogs
I loved the second part with the senior dogs! He really cares about the dogs and not only their attention. All these dogs deserve the world and I love that Chris respects that
This is gonna break the internet

Returns as Captain America at Marvel
I AM GOING TO CRYYYYYYYY I LOVE THIS MAN
is so perfect
"HII BUBBA" "LETS BUILD TRUST" yeah I'm not ok
In 15 minutes this video racked up 2.8 K likes. That is the power of combining Chris Evan's with puppies.
This was glorious. Was legit crying at him with the older dogs 🥲 what a sweetheart
All of these dogs have lived our dream
oh my god. this video would break records.
now i will watch this over and over. thank you Buzzfeed.
I want to cry, it's so pure! Puppies and America's Ass? My overies exploded!
"Hi buster...hi pal" MY HEART HES THE SWEETEST
God! Between this and BTS appearances in music shows, I'm gonna pass out. Can't take all this cuteness
Chris Evans with these puppies are so precious. His smile and laughter are pure sunshine!
So can we get Chris Evans read thirst tweets pretty please 🙏🏼
PLS I NEED THE RAW AND UNCUT VERSION NOW
he has cuteness aggression 😭😭😭
RETURN OF THE MACK? 😍😂
Well, technically, he already played Loki. A little bit. Remember "Thor - The Dark World", when Loki transforms into Captain America to annoy Thor?
This interview is a competition for who is the most adorable in the room. And they all win.
Chris Evans is the love of my life and this is one proof
This was perfect. Chris is honestly a beautiful human being. The way he was with the older dogs, thanking them for trusting him was adorable. Pulled at my heart. And of course him playing with the puppies was perfect, so cute! Calling them Buster and everything was just pure joy. Thank you for this!
🥰🥰🥰
I’ve been going through a really rough time lately. I didn’t know something as simple as one of the actors I greatly look up to answering questions while playing with puppies would put a much needed smile on my face. Thanks Buzzfeed. And Thanks Chris Evans for agreeing to doing this.
Here before this video starts getting million and million of views.
IT’S HERE
Finally 🤌😭
Everything about this interview was perfect
And we all feel better!!❤😭 God his laugh is everything!!
This is what happens when you listen to what the fans WANT ‼️‼️ thank you buzzfeed for Literally blessing us with this video
This is the best day of my life
I've always wanted him to be interviewed in puppies buzzfeed ❤😍❤
There’s no more tender and beautiful person in the world 💙
i love him too much
his cuteness aggression is setting in 😭
So Pure ❤️
Let’s be honest, we’ve all been waiting for this
he seems SO genuine, love this guy. <3
He actually answered more than i thought he would 😂😂😂also there was barely a full sentence there which i anticipated 😂😂😂
Favourite interview of all time
El momento más esperado por toda Latinoamérica unida!
i was smiling the whole time
Chris Evans talking to a puppy: *baby voice* You got a scratch pal? Come here I got you. Me (a desperate human): Yes.
Can Chris Evans be ANY MORE attractive? Like, let's forget the physical aspect. He seems so sweet and genuine.
Buzz feed did the Lord’s work 😭😭
YESSSS MY FRIDAY IS COMPLETE
Thanks Buzzfeed to make our dream came true 🥹
Best interview ever!
This just added 10 years to my life, so thank you. Now, have him comeback.
BUZZFEED MADE ALL OF OUR DREAMS COME TRUE ❤️❤️❤️❤️
never have i wanted to be a puppy more than this moment
🥺🥺🥺♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Me wishing I was that dog at the end
Suddenly my name's buster
This is it. This is exactly what I was waiting for. I'm so so emosh rn.
This was so beautiful, I think I cried a little lmao
YESSSSSSS HES SO CUTE
I need you to do a second interview please 🥺
EVERYTHING about this was incredible. My heart feels so full, oh my god. 🥺 He’s so fantastically adorable. I’m surprised he didn’t adopt them all. The “bubbas” and baby talk and the “Scarlett’s my girl” I CANT! Time to rewatch this for the rest of my life on repeat all day every day. 🥺🥰❤️ Thank you Buzzfeed!!
He’s literally just playing with puppies Because he didn’t answer most questions 😭
literally no one: ... chris (to every puppy): hi buster
I'm laughing and crying at the same time, the best interview in the world 💙
It's the shortest 8 minutes of my life 😭 He is so precious❤❤❤
I'VE BEEN SOBBING. IF THERE'S ANY POSSIBILITY TO FALL EVEN MORE IN LOVE WITH THIS MAN, THEN I JUST DID.
Dodger needs a brother or sister asap this is to cute
Thank you so much buzzfeed for this interview best interview ive seen
IVE NEVER WANTED TO BE A PUPPY SO BAD UNTIL NOW
We’ve been desperate to see Chris do a puppy interview for so long. It did not disappoint. 💙🐶 Thank you. I hope all these dogs find their loving forever homes very soon.
The 8:15 though
Finally
This is like a healing balm 🥺❤ There's nothing better than Chris Evans and puppies❤🥺😩. Thank you, BuzzFeed!
“Bubba, buster, bubbie,” “Excuse you”
“Buster” is the only acceptable way to address every dog going forward!#CauseChrisEvansSaidSo
I love how he genuinely have nothing in terms of answers - all puppies, no answers
This healed the world a little bit today 🥹❤️
He answered more questions than I thought he would hahahaha
I literally can’t with this man! He is so adorable
I'm glad Chris highlighted older dogs and not just the puppies. Everyone obviously wants a puppy and everyone obviously watches these Buzzfeed videos for the puppies but there are a ton of older dogs who are put down just bc no one wants to give them a chance and adopt them.
Aw, so sweet of him to bring in older dogs too. He's such a sweetheart. Best interview ever.🥰🥺
I already need a Sebastian Stan one
so worth staying up to watch i’m in tears this was so cute
this was the best day of my life I feel like I did the interview 😭😭😭
FINALLY,  PRAYERS ANSWERED, SKIN CLEARED.
I LOVE THIS 💜💜💜💜
omg
I NEED AN EXTENDED CUT PLEASE
This interview is a gift 💝
This was so cute MY HEART can't take this smh😭❤
Interviewer: a-  Chris immediately, playing with the puppies: WHO CARES?
Please, a puppy interview for every C.E work of this year, we're begging you Buzzfeed
I've never seen a happier person than Chris Evans in a room with dogs
This is a dream come true
Omggg🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷❤️
FINALLY!! OUR PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED!!
This is so cute, we won guys, we won
This is the best thing in the whole wide world😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
omg
Is it a bad thing that I'm jealous of all those dogs lol
THIS IS THE BEST INTERVIEW EVER AND WILL ALWAYS BE AND NOTHING CAN EVER CHANGE MY MIND
"What's the one question you'd like to be ask during an interview and what would be your answer?"  My answer: I would love to be asked if I would like to have small animals around me and my answer would be "Duh."
8:18 lol
Okay, but can we get "thirst tweets" segment with him. This had been a treat! ❤️❤️❤️
This is the best video of my life
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww😍😍😍😍
TE AMO CHRIS COM FILHOTINHO E CACHORRINHO VELHINHO TO MAL
😍😍😍😍
Truly didn’t disappoint! Beyond adorable!!! 🚀💫
🤰🏻
Now we need part 2 😁

i’ve never wanted to be a puppy more than today
Soo cute!!! Why am I tearing up at him with older dogs!!
Obrigada pela melhor entrevista da vida. O melhor vídeo do youtube sério ❤

Chris is basically drunk on puppy love and I love it 😂
So... I think I just die
Person: Do you want a puppy? Me: Idk, maybe but it's a big responsibility.  Person: Do you want a puppy that's licked Chris Evans face?  Me: A bit weird but funnily enough YES.
BEST INTERVIEW OF THE CENTURY!!
Chris : not answering a single interview question.  Also Chris : passionately tell an elaborate story about dodger.
FINALLY

Buzzfeed I love you so much
Chris comforting the puppies 😍
I could be a puppy too… woof woof
every dog was named buster
If Chris went home with all the pupperinos,i wonder what will Dodger's reaction be !
IM WEEPING
The cute aggression!!
dodger after seeing this video 👁👄👁
I love how he just picked one name for all of them and that the name he chose was Buster Brown hahahahaha
Click the like button before even watching it 😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰  Also, going to be watching this 10X!
I need a video of Chris singing "Return on the Mack" James Corden, this is the only time I will approve of Carpool K.
"Hemsworth would make me feel bad about myself" help 💀💀
When he said “Guys scratch pal” ahhhrggfhhcsbcusdbhjc soooo damn cute
screaming crying throwing up thanks buzzfeed
One of the puppies peed himself because of the excitement of seeing Chris Evans in person. Don’t blame him though. Lmao.
