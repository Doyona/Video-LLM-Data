Iggy’s yellow look on the back of the motorcycle is so 90s raver realness! She reminds me of my generation. I dressed like this and wore my hair the same way (or attempted with varying results 😅). I love this era. I love Iggy Azalea. I’m not sorry.

Weird af and easy song to get money click. Bait damn near whoever like this u chase clout facts

Damn she look good with black hair
Satan, the very devil and the father of all lies, has deceitfully and slowly Lowered the social norms of morality to a tragic and destructive level. One way the devil does this is through these types of music. taking the things God hates, sex, money, power, violence, self glorification, profanity, adultery, homosexuality, fornication, alcohol etc. and turning them into entertainment and consuming them purely for pleasure. The way women are treated and disrespected is abominable, the drug use is foolish at best, talk about sex and violence as something good and brag and boast. The idolization of material success is absolutely the worst. a lot of it promotes and actively glorifies things that Jesus advised against. While on the surface this music comes from human thoughts, philosophy and emotions, its creator is the devil. it is  produced by satanic influences. It is dedicated to the devil. Moreover, he/she is being used by the enemy to corrupt the hearts and minds of people. One of the great tragedies is that too many people who  are watching and listening to this type of so-called entertainment think they are spiritually strong and will be immune to its influence. But In doing so they are resisting the Lord’s will for their lives. It is only relieving them of their spirituality and opening a door for demons to enter into their lives. After coming to Christ there is no license to continue in sin as scripture everywhere warns against it. Don’t be deceived believing in cheap grace or once saved always saved. After Salvation, A true believer goes through a process called Sanctification, where the Holy Spirit works in their heart, making them detest their sin more and more. 1 Corinthians 10:31 Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
I don’t like this shit
Looks good on black hair

How Are You, Really Sexy and Hot, Younger than a Baby. But seen Ocean 13 Friday Suicide Night, Nice hobbi. Jacuzzi with Honey, Chocolate Towel, Girls Tower. Shock my Chest
Hi, my name is David. Sorry. I know that you don’t know me and we have never met before, but I would love to tell you that I love Iggy Azalea to death. She’s extremely beautiful. I have been loving Iggy Azalea since 2011 until now.  I’m planning to marry Iggy Azalea in the future. I’m also planning to move to California to start my acting, since I have always wanted to work in movies and hopefully I can meet Iggy Azalea one day. I love Iggy Azalea to death that I’m willing to give up my whole entire life for her. She’s the most world’s beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole entire life. I sure would love to live with her in her beautiful house and I sure would love to have a beautiful daughter with her. We might name our beautiful daughter, Amethyst just like Iggy Azalea’s first name. Once I’m married to Iggy Azalea, I would be extremely relieved that I have never been that relieved in my whole entire life. I have always wanted to marry Iggy Azalea since 2011. That was the year when she became a rapper. My beautiful future wife!  Are you in contact with Iggy Azalea or do you know anyone who is in contact with Iggy Azalea? If yeah, please let me know. I would really appreciate it. This is a huge and gigantic favor for me. It would mean a lot to me. I seriously wish that I’m married to Iggy Azalea right now with us having a beautiful daughter together. Iggy Azalea is inside my brain all day everyday 24/7. I can’t quit thinking about her. I’m extremely sad and lonely that I’m not with Iggy Azalea or Iggy Azalea is not with me. My bones are really cold and my muscles are sore. My face hurts as well. I can even cry sometimes when I think about Iggy Azalea all day everyday 24/7. I’m even lovesick and lovestruck by her. I always had this beautiful dream of me being married to Iggy Azalea. I would really love for this beautiful dream to become a reality.  Sorry for these long messages. I just wanted to get this off of my chest and to tell you how much I love Iggy Azalea with her beautiful self.
Why pushing Gay related content on such a beautiful song? WHY ??? WHY ?????

Iggy with the blue-yellow hairstyle was supporting Ukraine before the Russian invasion.
Iggy, soon we'll fill sexuality with personal values, but in the mean time, launch out with everything. I want this fucking monitor off my ankle. Tell JB Pritzker, he fucked up bad, real bad. I want it fully explained what's about to happen to his career and the ENTIRETY of his family fortune. It's over with.
Hi Iggy❤Nice song🌸😀😎
This sounds just like 'Call me mother' by Rupaul and it took me that much time to realize that,OMG

How is that not blackface?  Why are so many younger women doing this?  This is like a slap in the face to people of color.

I'm sad that she got a nose job. She was beautiful before and now she is starting to look like every other person who gets plastic surgery. UGH, how sad.

Why wasn't this song bigger than it was?
How did this not hit the radio with the flow… wow
She should of ft rich the kid I think it would of been bussin still good song
We miss you queen Iggy!
How can iggy be this popular? She's so tonedeaf
Hope

This is fouuuuul behavior for a mother
If this came out this year it would've been a hit,since house music is making a comeback Iggy was ahead of her time 🥰🥰🥰

Existe algum defeito nesta obra de arte n!! Clipe e musica sensacional amo!
To anyone reading this and think that Iggys “blackfishing” Fuck you if you had a fucking brain you would go to the behind the scenes and see CLEARLY that she’s not blackfishing at all. Some people these days just leave iggy alone 😒
I’ll give this an easy dislike
Not since Louis the Sun King declared "L'etat; C'est moi" has there been a more brutal, and accurate, appropriation of an institution by an individual.
cagou na vara carti, perdeu um peixão kk
why is everyone sleeping on this masterpiece
Damn she's beautiful
That purse she raps about was left on the damn pavement and this shit is trash !
I see certain artists today taking heavy inspiration from these Iggy type beats 👀
Hit it one time, two times? Too live Laying poolside and it made me woosah Too fine do ya' own thing Imma do mine I'm on cloud nine ‘cause the vibe too high Fat ass, lap dance, pop it on a handstand Big bags, big cash Hit a hundred car fast, don't crash!

The accusations over this video are so ridiculous. People are just hatin'. Ugh. Don't quit over this, Iggy! You are loved!
The D&G outfit from 2013 in the beginning made me so nostalgic! I was such a fan of her EP Ignorant Art in high school.

Does anyone know why she has "End of and Era" at the end?  Is she implying she's done making music?
Those dancer's are eating it upppp 👏👏👏👏
Love the outfit from the first video!!!
Love this song
Embarrassing
This is f111king awesome! I absolutely love the video actually its very catchy and the song its self has a good beat. I absolutely love that yellow and black outfit with the sun glasses! Omg this is so cool!
why is it so many black males dressing and acting like females in this video?
I still live for this song it’s sooo good
Chido cómo manejan esas motocicletas amores. Pretty cool how y’all drive and maneuver with those motorcycles.
Claro que si amor, puedes montarte aquí conmigo amor. Of course my love, you can ride me anytime my love.

Iggy is a beast for them dance and party songs! Her flow and voice is so sick.
imagining this as her calling in an order for a new sort of sandwich called the strip club from like a reverse delivery service where they also retrieve you to pick up your order is better than when i listened to it earlier...
is the first outfit the one from the Work music video? :0
Why does she look like a Kardashian
it's not nice to see men who dance striptease for men.
Looking beat up or ugly like the frame of our tip top strip club all the way to end of half then bammm I think word ..yes that the thought we us need the lap dance just paid ...bwrite all over back to us ..dayumm ohwass the next of the the day I hide was when I never even new one of this new things...uh huh yah start the levels we. Red a recruited to cycle them towards the good so the brace themselves with what most know so all ends well ...start a rail storm ...they like gifts now lol

I was going to die and I didn't know the Strip Club video was on my desk.
Damn. She ripped Azealia's style hard with this. It took me awhile to dislike Iggy but damn when going back to her music, I end up shaking my head. Dope song but she's wack.
She’s such a bad btch! I love her so much 🔥😭😻
She's never worked a job in her life. White power without regard of her privilege earning what proper POC and black people should be accessing.
Cardi B could never ..

Which road is this? Looks like california or something
Only came here cuz I heard she was getting ripped a new one over her darkening her skin tone. Music sucks anyways and now I just regret wasting 40 seconds of my life watching this crap.
Listened to break my soul and it reminded me of this underrated bop. But ofc shes beyonce so everyone would love it. The dualipality!
Is this Cardi B?
song of the decade!
So wholesome. I'm sure this will be a classic cherished for decades to come.
What tha f

I like the dark hair on her
under fucking rated! i will never stop saying!!!! i love this woman.
I just lost everything I use to luv about her. Now this one is to gay and fruity.
So this is why shes always partnered with others before.... i want 2:50 refunded please.
Sorry but this song is trash , don't understand this song.

Cuz that just isn't them that just have the struggle the last of stuff to everybody then
If there's any people it always been to just run up in his stuff behind him there's the library

Slay!

So in her first song Work she is wearing the exact thing with the same bag. At the end it says "The End Of An Era" What story was she trying to tell?
Perfect song ✨💖👏🙌🐧☝️

I don't usually like Iggy although I don't dislike her..this is amazing..I'm obsessed w her dancers. The choreo is more than remarkable, concepts brilliant and I like the song. This is awesome. I'm impressed. Also first outfit just like work down middle of the road..  P.S. if u have problems w the dancers, watch something else.

Why is nobody talking about how the outfit she’s in during the beginning is the outfit she was wearing in the beginning of “work”.. A VISUAL & METAPHORICAL QUEEN👑❤️
Iggy’s best song ever!
a fase que a iggy mais entregou conceito foi o tempo que menos fez sucesso. clipe maravilhoso
2:20 this boy is the same boy in the Lil Nas X video ?! : /
She is making song with Nicki Minaj 😍
listened to this song 180 times istg since 2021
YES! IGGY, YES!
Amor amor
Is it true China had this songs QR code in the sky? I saw it on twitter
Damn I tried to watch this video but seeing all those dudes like that I had to cut it off after 20 seconds because that's not my cup of tea to be watching dudes acting like females, o well
good song. horrible video.
Iwant you ft emeinim
Can’t stop watching this video. Her energy is so magnetic.
Uhhh... 1:14 This gets me everytime😆 She's soo damn good..
no matter what she does, she's always herself.
Motomamis support motomamis 💋
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Creo que rosalia se inspiró en este hermoso video , para su video de saoko
Discussed with the homosexuals!!! 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Can't get over this song, something about it.
Love
Girl whyd you just leave your purse like that?! 😂
Iggy was the first Motomami.
yes. her bag 🎒  still sitting there.  if yall wondering
THIS SONG IT'S A FUCKING BOP
So where is the blackfishing here ???? Fuck the haters this song had me bumping
"Honey I'm going to the strip club. " "But we have a strip club at home. " Strip club at home:
This is a good song everything except the men with thongs on. I don't like man ass.
This video deserves way more attention! All other music are sooo recycled, it so annoying!!
I love me some Iggy
Poor, Iggy wants to be Megan The Stallion so bad she's 1 song away from 🎶"AAHHH". Never thought her "rap skills" we're anything special that's obvious lol but hey she's made I guess👍right??
Iggy is so badass
Iggy verses are dope.
Mother of God, them queen dancers! I will never be that attractive, on my hottest day. I can't even wear a wedge sandal heel, literally less coordinated than a door knob. And they are just prancing around in heels taller than my stupid head. Mad respect!
La princesa del rap
Q U E E N
The first minute kills me!!
She is the strip club !
Onyx getting sent this when he hit school age
What was she again?

Motomami OG
i actually love and got so damn nostalgic when i saw the first seconds... Its just the same outfits as in work, her first ever hit <3  im so fckn proud to be a fan of her since 2012 Ignorant art....
Not me realising nine months later That she put out a video😭😭😭💀💀and it’s fing fireeeeeeeee 🔥
This song deserved better! Y’all slept on it 😭
Ft jeonvevo
Yukes
💥
The beat on 2:15 is so good that it wakes the hoe-y side.
Why you left the bag Iggy ?
i still remember that pant from work which was released 8 years ago i guess
This song should be a hit
Wait. I just noticed that Iggy azalea is in this video.
Such an inspiration for all the motomamis
⚡️
Fire 🔥
It’s about time someone saw the club in a semi! Mobile strip clubs are the future. Songs not my jam but strip clubs n truckin are!🔥👏
😎😎
Iggy u left ur handbag behind😕
Imagine this being your big break and your mom asks to see the video You danced in 🤮 I love her but this was a mess 😂
A true artist
🌴 RAWSUMNiSS 🐢 🌴
This sounds very similar to an Azelia Banks Record
From Bridgeport CT, 🇵🇷…  Come do it like NOBODY can! I have missed you so much! Your sound is NUMERO UNO POR SIEMPRE! No one sounds like you. They can try, but they just don’t have your sound. Thank you for coming back to us. You got this!   Thank you to the 🏳️‍🌈 LGBT community. You are loved!   Thank you to all the people who went back to fight to Ukraine for peace. People with zero experience. Women, 18 year olds, elders, retired military with their pensions who went back to fight, people who had zero experience in handling a weapon. I salute you all, and pray for you all the time. 😔  💌🏳️‍🌈🇵🇷❣️
Las motomamis originales
Good on her for wearing the black wig. Show them to sit down and shut up Iggy.
Boas
Queen sht
Yo this song is it
Amazing
God what has rap come down to?! This is such trash. Where are the actual talented people??
Dope! Some iggy house music!
👑
You gotta love Iggy bruh
Love
Best song on clubs FR
Also.....how tf is this allowed to stay on youtube? She is literally culturally appropriating beyond belief...this "woman" grossessss me out
She looks like one of the characters in White Chicks in disguise as a woman lmfao!
Jose Antonio carbajal Montero boxing tittle Salem police initiated am PM muscle car vibes
I'M OBSSESSED WITH THIS SUPER COOL CREATION !!!! I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH !!!!
Malamente
Let's go Iggy... Take your time Queen... I'll wait for you to make a comeback.
Oof this sounds like it should’ve been done by a real AAVE artist like azealia banks
she is a motomami
Sickening af 😵😲😵😵😲😲😲 it’s the dancers for me
I just watched her “fancy” video and she’s shifted a whole skin tone 😂

Hi, Cardi 😂😂😂😂

Iggy gave her EVERYTHING for this music video and y’all slept on her! America doesn’t deserve Iggy azalea.
how is this clip not 100M yet?
i love this mv
Love her music I agree need more now
I just know cardi b love this song
Let's go, for 10,000,000!!!
The fact she’s exactly dressed at the beginning as the Work video 👏🖤
She's fireeee
10m?
la continuacion de la cancion work ?
I was hoping for a better song. I stopped it at 02:02 to write this comment. I estimate she invested about 1 mill of maybe her own funds to pay for this video. 🤔 Nice visuals 'though, I ain't gonna lie. Just wish there was better muzik to bop to. About the blackfishing controversy surrounding the video.. Yep. She's definitely doing it here and for obvious clout bc notice blackfishing has been a hot topic for a min now..
So sexy 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
And this girl do a duet with Didi J? 🤔
Gee girl, I like this a lot, cool beat and rapping. This ain’t Black Fishing, it’s a tribute. Stop bothering
This is so good like okay iggy!!
Beuatiful love yuo super good super
Hey she left her bag behind
the ONLY thing missing to complete that opening look is the same necklase as from the Work video. flawless delivery
🤩🤩🤩
Did Nicky Minaj become a white woman?
Work?
Better than meg
Love this jam! I truly don't believe Iggy deserved all the hate, at the end of the day she is truly talented 🤍
I don't give a Faaaaa what mufukas have to say bout this woman....  My girls an abso fukin loot  ICON !!!!!  Keep dropping em Iggs
Love to see gay representation
Love all yours songs since the beginning! U shine gurl
U are amazing
Love
10m?
Its the continuation of work but they missed the shoes the one from WORK where the pigalles from christian louboutin in the color black
I love you girl ❣️

Esa cabina de trailer huele a puro culo XD
Maravilhosaaaaa Injustiçada 🥺
Who is she trying to be? Lol seriously. It's a good song but I think she is mimicking someone. 🤔😏ijs
Singalong from meeeeeee...  https://youtu.be/0-d7cj0GGpI
Yuck!...and I just ate...I'm so done with the industry.
I'm waiting for her to rap in an Australian accent instead of a black one... Stop trying to be somebody else and be you.
Pooula
Here's the best playlist for you Iggy   https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL77z1AbRKCj5s1ixJlbTJdoJIWBknWkrr
As a nightclub DJ, I'm appalled by this. Also, she's more like Krispy Kreme.
this song brings world peace.
Word life. This is basic thuganomics
Nice to see the guys dancing in lingerie and the gals stunt riding
I think I'm watching Iggy's favourite movie. Terminator 2... It reminds me of how my parents where working hard before I was born!
Love you Iggy 💖
Am sucker of this song since its first release still can’t take off the heat ... feel exactly strippers
Love this beat 🔥🔥🔥
I almost cried when I saw that first outfit ❤️
Love how she always shows love to the gays & now that she’s independent she’s able to completely do that. Queen period
Ну и лажа.
😎😎😎
She and whoever liked this type of music has lost the plot
olvidaste tu bag money :)
she always look good but the yellow n blue hair on the bike ATEEEEEEE
This video has very “I wouldn’t be surprised if we never saw Denise Richards again” energy.
Same walk, same street, same bag, same fit, same bih, as “Work.”  Diff era, diff account💰, same Queen 🚺👑🔥
she deserves more
"your australian be australian" lmao
Iggy azalea I would love to see you soon
Bag 😢💔
Tik tok brought me here.
How you gonna quit music with 10M views sis….hop on it 🏇🏿
🤑
Can we get a moment of silent appreciation for those dancers poor tucked testis 🙌🤩😬🤑
If this chick gets anymore surgery she will look like a contestant on rupaul drag race 😂
Iggy Top
I love how it's women riding bikes showing how we can do EVERYTHING 👏👏
Vamos por esos 12 millones de vistas. Un panameño apoyando a la máxima Iggy. Panamá 🇵🇦🤩
She's not black fishing!!!!! It's just her style!😊
Go Aussie girl we're the best u sex on legs love ya xx
hello  ya azeri baku
Song of the millenium
Amé
I don't get why some people  complain for her making a good hip-hop music... Since hip-hop is a black music, the better you make it, the more you sound, and your style looks like the other successful hip-hop artist, who are black. What the F is BlackFace, or BlackFish! I bet it's not the ordinary hip-hop fans, who appreciate artists talent...
The verses just needed a little bit more tweaking there are some cringe lines but the first verse works the chorus however needed something
What in the whole actual fuck is this bullshit? Smh I've never been to and will never go to a strip club, resembling the happy party in this video. TF made her think all the straight dude's who clicked on this video to see her fake azz, wanted to see a bunch of dudes twerking, dancing, and dressed like women?
Wtf is up with the sound design for the motorcycle at the start, and why she j left her handbag on the road ?
Who's still listening in 2022? Am I seriously the only person?
I came here just to remember how cringe it was 😭
This music got ruined
mindless song
Snatch my wig
Almost 10 M views as an independent artist ! And I get it cause iggy is art …
Very sad that she doesn't have more respect for herself
Blackfishing
You are fantastic, you are badass, you are the queen of the whole fucking thing! ❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷
My new favorite song.. can't wait til covid is over to hear this at every gay bar
Ay ando el estripclub 🔥🔥🔥
in another alternate universe this song went Diamond, I just know it❤️
I feel sad for her that she's flopping
Work- strip club
yeah come to the vibe of a€€€s
WTF she is still around? Buckley brought me here
Wtf is this
Amazing artist.
I would never do that... I can't imagine anyone doing that.
Iggy is getting more and more sketchy
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow haven’t heard her since she put black widow out and she is still incredible at singing

Iggy
her songs are so good
Are we gonna ignore that she clearly is blackfishing. She literally looks like Cardi B in this video.
no wonder T.I regrets ever help her get into the music industry
👏👏👏👏👏👊👊👊👊👊🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲😘😘😘😘😘🖤🖤🖤🖤
The slack this woman gets no wonder she quit music.  Nobody else gets ridden for being a hip hop artist and I can name many female artists.  I think she did amazing as a 16 year old with no money on her wsy to be a star. SHE DID IT!!! With little help
Special effects. No way could that cargo-ship of an ass fit on a motorcycle. She may be rich. But she can't sing. This is not music. This is...crap.
This song is so catchy tho ‘
Work work work work
30k comments n 200k likes 🥰
Anyways stream
Winning as she deserves
Slaying as should
This song went Diamond in a alternate universe!  I just know it ❤️

Her first outfit is really her on her Reclassified era, specifically on her Work music video. I missed that one.
1:14-1:22 best part 🔥🔥🔥
The one thing this video is seriously lacking is Inxi Prodigy!
ela tá em situação de barril mesmo né? a ponto de contratar gays feios pra aparecer mais que ela no clipe
night time!
The way she’s making the music she really wants to do, amazing song
IGGY <3
well made
what kind of shite attempt of vogue music is this?
remember when she tweeted homophobic stuff? now shes tryna cash in on us gays. we dont forget iggy.
I’m not a homophobic but, the amount of gay men-dancers in this video made me feel like I was in the wrong strip club..
Justice for I am the stripclub 👑✨
THE PURSE AND OUTFIT IS A THROWBACK TO TO HER FIRST MUSIC VIDEO FOR THE SONG "WORK".
Queen
Yesssss Iggy is finally black
Some people say that the ones who get offended by something like this because she's appropriating black culture in her artistry are being oversensitive. I don't think they're being oversensitive, they're just being stupid.
I can not believe that this woman has not had more success  she is savage
Sis I think you forgot your bag-
👍🏾🔥🔥🔥 nice song Iggy 🔥🔥
This song deserved to have 100 Million views
There's a big lack of stripping for being the strip culb. :(
2 shots deep it's playtime!!
Army and bars $$@??🦊🦧🦅🦅🐸
Iggy knows how to rap very well dance etc her lyrics prove she's a REAL BOSS  please make more music  you are STAR GIRL 💯💯
Iconic
Girl you're wight as milk... why you all tenned up??
Idk about you all but I stream this everyday
I want my queen back🥺🖤
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Underrated af
Terrible
10x better than those TikTok girls. Too impressive for an independent artist.
“Pretty face with some perfect tits.” Facts, Iggy is a Queen. She’s a goddess on earth, and she deserved better. Y’all need to pay for her music. It’s fckn fire 🔥. I love, respect, and support Iggy Azalea. I am also dark-skinned black. Lil Kim sounds just like me (speaks proper English), and she’s allowed to rap. Why can’t Iggy? Because she’s Australian? Bitch, please 🤚🏾
Iggy Azalea debe ser más reconocida :((
happy new year 2022🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡💛💛💛💛
Here from adoseofbuckley and I can't believe she's still making music. I'm glad she's quitting music for a while because I'm sure a lot of people's ears will recover after this shit show
🔥
Happy New Year 2022
This song it's a bop
Hmmmm it’s not giving 🙂🙂
ON FIRE BABY
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Iggy finally came back! She was holding out on us with this single. So sad she doesn't get more attention.
I see she's a fan of doja lol and nice new butt 😂❤️

Grwuiop free me bi invest you anyone you strip is you because your fights weak beat who  exercise choreography cardio mashup balance oonn
came here to hate, but this shit kinda bangs
The sound is good 🤠
I'm not a fan of iggy but this song hits me differently
Blackfishing. Wow she should be ashamed.of herself.
The moment when she forgets her bag and does'nt even care
Crazy Good
Probably the worst song of the year.
So underrated... :(
*Stream her as hard as u can, she deserve itt!!! 👑*
omg she's black now
You know this is art when it got 9 million views ( and counting) as an independent artist ❤️🥺
i dont belive that she actualy did black fishing it was probably just to add the effect of her actually being in a strip club n if it was blackfishing she wouldnt have gone lighter in the other parts of the video once ur not an american n u tryna make it america will do anything to destroy then
she is a perfect e.g of when AmErIcA did someone wrong
Anyone from ADoseOfBuckley?
Who’s here before 10M 👇

I love your music but what's the deal with male strippers lmao 🤣 this is a jam though
What is this garbage??
To whoever is reading this , I wish you an amazing and blessed life. Full of happiness success and feeling fulfilled. You're a special human,don't forget it!
Even by Iggys standards, this one is rough.
All for the gays
New music no equipment just a cellyphone 📱 recorder ,, I appreciate any listenin ears 👂
🔥
If she switched her lyrics it would be better
Love it wow six love
QUE TEMAZO!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Are some of those women dancing in the background men???
I could smell the Botox from here. Also this song sucks so bad that YouTube didn’t age restrict it just so everyone can see what to not be
Anyone else here after watching a dose of Buckley?
It's funny how ppl come at her but it was OK for Lil Kim to bwcome a white girl An Michael Jackson became a white man hmm
this needs much more recognition.
I'm always gonna Love Iggy Whatever She Does  Down 4Life
Hino injustiçado
Still iconic
I don't understand how people comment how great Iggy's songs are?   Only great song she ever made was Black widow feat Rita Or
This is criminally underrated song 😭😭 I listen it everyday 🔥🔥
SHE REALLY IS THE STRIPCLUB
I ❤️🛻💋🎧
THIS SONG IS SO UNDERRATED WTF 🤬
What a dreadful song....and video. Horrible
I love how the sparks are coming from the tires when doing wheelie :D
Looks like pornography.
La Bouche is back

I’m straight asf and this song makes me believe that black listing is real asf cause this song is a slap and it’s not viral like wtf .
Tf is this shit
At the start I thought it was the end of work but then I look closer the bag is too big so is the skirt and the shoes ant the same but lol it still took me a long time and she’s that rich that’s why everything it bigger duhuu
Iggy azalea vs Britney spears vs Theo Sally Womanizer mashup https://youtu.be/SX5m6o5nWCM    🥰🥰
To many drag queens.
Iggy, why does this song say that you don't want love though you want money instead of love? I didn't notice the lyrics for this song until I heard it many times... ethical reality check possibilities, concern, ethics of extreme unstoppable power of kindness, love towards elderly men like the one in your other music video that you plugged the nose of, Iggy, let the love into your heart cage, Iggy please love please love please love please love
Finally after 8 years of walking in those louboutins, somebody picked her up.
Iggy Azalea looks good with black hair
Everybody is t we telling the Job to S....
Great ✨

Trash.
My eyes r not green sorry 4 lieing..my eyes r brown
I love this song beacause of inventadas.inventadas God bless them
Having a tan doesn’t mean you’re black fishing. Black women are always so pressed over white women lol it’s weird
Why didn't this go on the radio? Just like "switch " or "work" I mever heard them on the radio. They are hits!!!

Not everyone can rap over house beats like Azealia Banks :/
Y una nuestra  iggy rubia ?? 👩‍🦳😪😪😪
تحت ابطها واو
This is shit bruh wat is it it ??????? House rap or wat I’m confused 😐
Ummm why is she so tan ???  And idk I can’t help but say it’s somewhat black fishing not to hate but just to keep it real …,I’m a huge iggy  fan but she is an Australian pretty pale woman  and that’s just facts idk if her body is real I mean it’s pretty but she kind of looks like Cardi and I mean her body isn’t real either but her tan is you know what I’m  just saying …don’t get mad I’m just noticing what the eyes can clearly see, Its fine that white people can tan but her complexion is like Lauren Londons or an Italian or Middle Eastern woman ….I mean idk it’s just interesting to see
To think this has 15m if u add Spotify too I’m so proud
We love iggyy

Club Music
Como te amo Iggy.
It would be cool to see her do some real HipHop, rather than all of this pop, club jump off mess. Rhyme about her life, and career, and all of the criticism she’s received. Part of the issue is that I don’t think she writes her own raps.
Tiene 8.1 M dd suscriptores  y 8.1 M de vistas jajaj
Wtf
She is very underrated! Keep it shining Iggy you rock darling 🔥😍
¿cómo por qué no tiene éxito esta canción?

Final hour
What the hell? Most hater people viewed this than fanbase. LOL
There can be Trans Women and Trans Men, but not Trans African Americans, Trans East Asians, Trans Indigenous People?  I've heard of Biological Women being recognized as Men, Biological Men being recognized as Women. Being a woman has its genetic component, its historic component, the way people treat a biological woman, the expectations put on a biological woman.  The same goes for "black" too. So where are the people who were "born black inside, I'm actually black, I was born Caucasian biologically, but realized I'm not a Caucasian on the inside, I've been mis-raced, I've been given the wrong ethnic identification" and now the concern is "will I "pass" as a woman, a man, a "black" woman", a "Japanese man"?  Why shouldn't this new "appropriation" be allowed? Biological women have long struggled, and now "White Men" are taking claim to all their "wins" and "spaces" and even their "struggles" in some ways, so why not with this too?  The truth is, there are no sane excuses at all.  Furthermore, why can't a person put on make-up or a costume of their pleasing, to make any appearance of themselves? Is creating an "avatar" in a game, "mis-gendering" or "black-face" or "yellow-face"? Iggy is "Fake", the "White Girl" singing like a "Black Girl" isn't any different than the spray tanned Iggy.  Sensitivity has its limits, but the "White Man's Grasp" has no limits, nor does their "Gaze". Isn't that what you've all been learning?  So, the same people who came along as said "I am a woman, I want to be recognized as a woman", no matter how disrespectful that appeared to be to biological women who had undergone generations of struggles, need to come along and say "I am a black woman, I want to be recognized as a black woman", despite the protests of anyone else, because, why not? You've done one, but you can't do another? One isn't wrong, but another is wrong? They have the same components involved, they have the same claims and accusations involved.  In this case though in particular, Iggy is probably never going to say such a thing as "I'm really a Black Girl inside", because she has demonstrated in this video that  she is not a Black Girl, but a Hispanic Homosexual Drag Queen, and I enjoy the video and song very much.
Gross
One of the best songs from 2021 💯
Disgusting this guy's men
Why are the tyres sparking?
Faking lovehttps://youtu.be/9r2_tj0K3yA
honestly I love her so much Iggy doesn't give up
A BOLSA FICOU NA RUA GAROTA
My eyes ! My eyes are burning !!!  What the hell Iggy?!?! Those guys in the truck I don't even have words... Why Iggy, why??? Why stars need to do anything what is told to them to do for popularity? Otherwise star will be wasted to junk or what? Don't sell your soul...
This is my current go-to song when im doing my makeup... Thanks Iggy
i for one like her short shorts.
love you Iggy. 💗🧚🏻‍♀️😈✨
What a LAZY video. There is no creativity. She is in front of a green screen ....with the boring truck n motorcycles. But The Song is so good......I would have had a Fabulous video to go with it!
Owowowowoowowow
I’ll see you in some months, when this get viral :)
opposite michael jackson version -.-
She and Kesha woulda done a good thing together IMO the old ke$ha though
Underrated asf
Is she in Cloud9 the superstore?
Lookin like Doja cat😹
She looked like cardi in dark hair
Love it. One of her best songs
Listen now https://youtu.be/5Gs4EKJZUaU
Stan Twitter is trying to accuse iggy of blackfishing because of this video. So all the haters who are here to bash her, know that the shot is taken on Night time with red lights on. So it just makes her appear darker. Check the BTS pictures and videos if you don't believe me.  Also on the last scene on the daylight witj her on the pool she looks normal.  So stop hatin on iggy for no reason. She has been nothing but respectful for the black and hip hop culture ...
Music is soso. Video was really good though
Queeennn
Every hair colour looks good on her..
I don't think we need azealia banks anymore
This is already a classic
Did you just level up the blackfish? Girl
how wish he fotoshop is ? jes
Lay off the spray tan sis
Didn't even recognize her
E era foi entregue! Expendido
Hmmm yeah u happen to see and article saying she blackfishin... hmmm she just look like she has a tan.. like most white girls get...🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
she left the purse on the floor hello
Who’s here before 9 M 👇
😳
Awwww she still trying but yet her net worth literally hasnt increased in YEARS! I love Iggy, love her look, love her style, she's a fkn queen BUT the rap, not serving her justice. Rap isnt her scene nd she's royally failing at it. She gota stick to what works!!! Her rapping publicly ain't working😅 She has other platforms she can ridiculously bank off of. Nd for all y'all that wana come at me.....chk the net worth nd then chk who y'all speaking for...she's dead as a bone yard when it comes to her music.....chi back in 5 years.................yea🤣🤣
Love this indie artist
I gotta say the dudes dancing was disgusting. Why they trying to make young people gay..
I scrolled through a bunch of comments and not one is critical or has negative feedback.....im immediately suspicious, most of these posts are not real people.  Am I the only one feeling this way ???
loving the throwback outfit at the beginning 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I feel like this is a little ahead of its time. Release this in a year or two I bet it would’ve been in the top 10
They’re so inconsistent with the way the title should be layout
Trash 🗑
Buck breaking
Why do this Culture Vulture have black men looking women.Ince again there's an agenda to feminize black men in this country.
her armpits are incredible.
💚
That outfit from the beginning from 'work'
Chill everyone chill this is just a dance song. Play this and dance to it
Song of the year.
This is trash
Saw her live two days ago....omg sooo awesome!!
8m
Why are all these white girls trying so hard to look ethnic.
What happened to her, her looks are totally different doesn't look like old Iggy
As gays não transformarem essa música no maior hit dela foi inacreditável :/
I’m a black hood dude and I looooove iggy …they wanna black ball her but put nas on all the tv screens…even tho this songs sounds like Nas type of music.
This is some bullshit right here.
🖤🖤🖤🖤
Clearly TI took her under his wing for a reason. This song fire🔥🔥. Surely white folks should still be able to bronze and tan without being accused of appropriation!
People complaining about her "black fishing". WTF, aren't white people even allowed to tan or bronze anymore without being accused of appropriation etc.. ? Come on now folks, this is getting silly. BTW, this song is🔥.
Oooh-whee!!!
Blackface
Como eu amo essa música e vídeo ♥
Trash, forced inclusion, ended in flop
Kgb we move leftovers
YUP... SHE IS A LEFTY!
Yikes
Looks so much better blonde
A bop 😭😭
There's no way grown people be listening to this woman Prolly lil kids  And people with zero fucking taste My god her music is horrible
Ask me 100 times if I'd rather goto a Cardi B concert or Iggy concert and I will tell you 100 times I want to see Iggy....
THE DANCERZ MADE ME THROW UP IN MY MOUTH 🤮🤮🤮 yeah i said it ....
Queen 👑
azealia banks beat???  You're basically rapping like her with the same beat...
🤍

I love the fact that there are so many people saying she’s a horrible rapper and always bashing her yet they’re listening to it willingly…… like if you don’t like it why are you watching/listening
Iggy azalea Sun in Gemini Moon in Saggitarius😏💣🍒
Ok nice
The sound doesn't deliver.  Go back to the foundation.  ALWAYS SEXY THOUGH!
WTF
❤❤❤
🔥🔥
She will come back. Most artist do since they have other projects.  She models, she's coming out with a perfume line, has a makeup line. Models clothing and shoes. Just has more projects.  She will be back with more music. Give it time
IGGY QUEEN OMFG ILYYYY
Not people out here thinking this is good
This is sooo good! I love you Iggy, thank you for release this as your last single ❤️ I'm gonna miss you so much.  Please come back soon.
Iggy Azalea é uma Deusa 😍🤤🤤🤤
Yawn
Yes sooo goooooooooood xx+xy
I'm obsessed with the 3rd outfit....🔥
I miss Iggy's old natural nose 👃
"Haus of Balmain"! Love it.
Iggy gets payed for YouTube views, I wish the haters knew they’re actually giving her more money🥺
Queen of rap, Iggy has haters ANGRY and watching😝
Statistically speaking, there's a lot of hiv positive men on that truck...
Honestly whoa. Supermodel women riding dirt bikes, but in actuality they’re just boss ass bitches like Iggy
These comments have to be bought lol. If not then man are we doomed! 😂😂
Iggy looks amazing and dark hair like she's always amazing and on point but I really love it in that dark hair
only 7 million views? Wow 🦾🦿🦾🦿🦾🦿
This is a bop!!! I can totally see drag queens dancing to this song! Lol
she def got a lil tan huh!!
Hino injustiçado
🧛🏻🧛🏻
1:15 me every morning...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🎯💯💯💯🥂#superbad { major }
Looks Like Sex sklaves....in the Car ... Sex industry and Sex sklaves ist a real Thing!!!
She's talented it's frustrating why on Earth would she tan herself knowing people look at her like a culture volture? I wish she would have revamped & stopped the fake accent. I think she has a lot to give but her refusal to listen is her downfall.
Pure decadent shit
Queen Behaviour
flop
The Christian God is the True God and I am going to prove it right now: God has a Law called the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20). These Laws include do not lie, do not steal, don’t put others gods before Him (Exodus 20)  Have you ever broken any of these Laws? Have you ever told a lie? Have you ever stolen anything? Have you ever lusted after someone? If we really went over God’s Laws in the Bible, every single one of them, it can really expose how much of a sinner we truly are and because we have all committed these acts our punishment is Hell because God’s standard is perfection.   Our good works cannot get us into Heaven. That’s like you steal a soda from the store but you tell the judge, “hey judge I give to the orphanage, I do community service.” The judge will not care about what you did. You stole something that was not yours so therefore the Judge is going to find you guilty. God is the same way.  But, this Judge is a loving Judge who does not want to sentence you for your crimes. He sent His Son Jesus Christ to come and take the punishment for your sins and if you Repent of your sins and accept jesus Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior then you will be saved from the sentence. Jesus loves you and is not willing that any should perish but have everlasting life (John 3:16) God bless
It’s like you’re about to fall off your 4X4 if what you said wasn’t bad enough, what kind of example is that for your new born children?
Strip xlubs are dirty nasty and no stripper ever wants to be a stripper no one knows why you act so damn dead
Iggy Azalea is my Queen ✨👑
Wow This is hard
I would put your whole strip club in prison on death row don’t fuck around
You’re music is too slow
THIS VISUALS ARE AMAZING 🙌
She’s looks so good with black hair!
Hhahahaha "Call ma' job tell em' S88k my d**k. Send the check I am NOT clocking in"! ":))))))))
At whatever I started to hear “don’t need dog boots,” and my mind won’t let me change you from saying those words.   Free them doggos girl.
All I see is bunch of AZIS !
yaaaaaassssssss 🕺🏻
Such degenerated video.  I remmebered old iggy and was looking for her new stuff and disspointed I gor
Gross
Not saying owt but why is her skin so dark i thought she was really white? Like especially in the fancy video compare her skin tones
Got a little Cardi B vibe from the wig and make up in the beginning.
Iggy please release Digital Distortion
Love this
this is so legit , why do I see it so late !!!!!
How the fuck did I end up here after years😂😭
BLACK WIG.  She said black straigt hair and im living
Does anyone remember the good old days when things were on the down-low for certain people?
😁 To those who read this comment, even though I don't know you : I wish you the best of what life has to offer.  😌    🙋🏼‍♀️🙋‍♂️🙋🏾‍♀️🙋🏻‍♂️ Except : hard drug traffickers, sex traffickers, pedophiles.  And, the few other criminals in this world. 🤨  😏 🙂
I first discovered her on Steve Aoki & Angger - Beat Down. I'm glad she's back. You'll be hearing from her again you just won't know it. Hopefully, it's a Top 10 song.
Good bi**h
💢8.4M💢 🌟🤤

2021 How to make a music video get attention, put black gay men in little to no clothing in the video.... Gen Z fan base - ITS A HIT
This her last release week! Keep streaming guys!
SHE BLACKFiShiNG
The girls came to slay!!! Love the dancers 💋
The fact she has the outfit from "WORK" on the beginning is iconic!

Esta canción se me hace chistosa por la base y la voz de iggy azalea
Them: The world is your $tripclub Iggy: Iam the $tripclub
What I appreciate about Iggy is that she does her thing, regardless of what others say. Live your truth. Everyone has something to say about someone for some reason. But, I Am The, The Strip Club.
anybody think black hair look good on her
trash
This is shit man
Iggy appealing to the lbgt population I see. It won't work though.
I refuse to believe these views are accurate.
This bop never gets old
mid carti better
I'm just happy that we live in a world where a young white woman can grow up to be a young black woman.

Cardi b Fav song 😂
iggy if you were an artist who would you be?

No se ustedes pero yo estoy obsesionado con esta Canción y el video es genial!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAS QUEEN
This beat slaps hard.
Love u from MOROCCO
Why the dudes?
I'm so in love with my goddess.
😍😍
How does this not have a billion views. I just don't understand.
Have you noticed the reference to the "work" outfit at the beginning of the vid I-CO-NIC luv you XOXO
DESERVED SO MUCH MORE
She can NOT RAP  NO HATING.  AND these dudes with their asses out is 🤢 gross.   Wtf was that!
Top 3 Iggy songs IMO!!!!! Fire fire fire 🔥
Why is this song so underrated!?
Amo esta canción
Makes me wonder how many people Are for the gays and how many are a marketing strategy
I love how she’s for the gays
She coming back for that bag, and I’m here for it!
I have always loved some Iggy but , this video had a real Cardi B feel to it .. not sure how I feel about it ... She is still a Goddess in my book though . Hope she doesnt quit music all together .
The deluxe of the end of an era is coming!!!
Incoming twitter snowflakes
is this the sequel of Work?
The sameeee clothes than “work” video and she still looks perfect 🤩
Ezt nem szabad 18/21 év alatt megnézni. S fajtalanságra buzdít.
Love this song
I’ll never get tired of this song 😍
She deserved to be on the VMA's performing this
this needed a VMA nomination and performance. Truly is video of the year
Why do she and Cardi B have the same face?
Sis been waking for more than 8 years now
went from super star to super far from the super top to the super drop still got a super asss
This is black face.
She can't stop stealing from other artists.  She's taking Gwen Stefani's look on the back of the quad
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can we get one last tour , the pitbull opening was too short , we want more :)
So funny that  the starting of this video she has on the same outfit she had on in her video work. And the exact starting with her walking lol many people probably didn’t even realized
Amoooo🇲🇽😎😍
I gravitate more to metal and horror rap...but this song just makes me feel like a baked banana
Work work ir on my shit
It was the Big ass Big rig truck filled with NOTHING but FINE ass black & brown men fuckin it ALL the way up and in heals at that, for me💁🏾‍♂️🙋🏽‍♂️🙆🏽‍♂️🗣🗣
Title debunked: Iam a hoe
Y’all I heard she was tryna blackfish so I watched the video and now I’m laughing at the fact that people reach so hard to be offended. She didn’t look black at all. Not all white people have paper white skin 100% of the time. Seriously find something better to do with your time. No ones forcing you to like her or listen to her music. Get a life.
Lit shit!!!
I gotta say SHE IS THE ONLY GAY ICON for how she loves and celebrates gay people and is so down to earth but also never puts herself on a pedestal. Forget Madonna and Cher
Yes this would be a great permanent club song! Great Fun!
Vid=coo
This is a bomb video! I'm sad she's giving up music.
Iggy your rap is priceless!
Iggy you are the Strip club! Thank you I love this song!
This is the only thing getting me through 2021.
Actually not bad!!
I just like the quality sound its precicely.
Iggy deserves so much better, she’s an icon and the industry treated her like a trash bag 😡
Video ruined I don’t want to see men wanting to be women 😡😡😡
Wow she looks so different it’s like a different person
It’s crazy how people still are sleeping on her n now she’s done :(
Me encanta............ Es la Lady di de la música comercial.. 🇪🇨
Lol ti was right
The first outfit she wearing is the same as one of her outfits in her first single music video which was Work
I agree! She's one of the best pop stars to come out during this past decade.
I would be ashamed to release something so ridiculous and lacking in quality like this 💀
Iggy if you were an artist, which would you be?
Iggy ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think this is her best song yet
THIS IS AMAZING
SO GOOD... love you queen
iggy come to brazil pls!!🥰
RETURN IGGY PLS, LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!
All of your dollars
Just need all of
Don’t want your problems
Don’t want your love

Wuoo me encantó esta mujer, me he picado, voy a ver más trabajo de iggy ❤👄❤
Everybody giver her the stream she deserves!!!
This might be the worst thing I've ever seen, and heard. Keep in mind I watch a lot of WW2 documentaries.
Masterpiece ❤️
Wow Iggy ❤
I have been scarred for life
❤️‍🔥
She is a Goddess, she is the stripclub, she is everything.❣️
Why is anybody talking about the fact she made blackface for this??
I’m so sad iggy is done with music
This music video is 🔥🔥🔥
This feel something like azealia banks would make but still a bop
im sorry but iggy looks like michelle visage with that black hair
is the work part in your musical song
I love this sound, good job IGGY.
Showing Schiaparelli realness in the pink glove bra….yaaaas. # hotankles
I am totally for cultural appropriation....Go Iggy!
Great song. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLmxMDaEglI
glad Iggy is back with a HARD AS FUCK song
I never expected the black hair iggy. And this actually fireeee
That shit was hottttttttt🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌡️🌡️🌡️🌡️🌡️🌡️🌡️🌡️🌡️🌡️🌡️🌡️🌡️🌡️
If this song was sung by Doja, it would be viral on tiktok without any reasons.
Adore her yellow look on the motorcycle it’s amazing!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love this song so much.
Very azalea banks, but I am not complaining cuz this is my second favorite iggy song, and azalea fucking slaps!!
Sad.  Iggy, give your life (and talent) to the Lord who actually loves you.  Not this vile and depraved music industry that uses you and leads you to defile yourself for their own profit.  Give your life to the One that made you and knows the number of every hair on your head.  For what does it profit a woman to gain the whole world only to lose her soul?  You know it’s true…follow your heart….Jesus will heal you.
Iggy & Nicki minaj pleaseeee
J'adore se que tu fais!!❤️
came from tracy martel, she was indeed right this was fire

She needs to release music with beats like this!!!!!
I love at the beginning she is wearing the outfit from work MV . If you are OG you know what im talking about
gwen stefani?
Up.
really! another hypersexual LGBTQ music video with iggy azalea .. I understand why video as it is made. it a shock factor and it should be sexy. but it is also a fuck you to those who think it disgusting and too much .. I personally think it is not a good thing when the dances in the video look like you will start to fuck any second and think it goes a little too far .. but I'm not surprised it's the way it is today ..
Iggy 🔥🔥🔥💕💕Iam The Stripclub Iam The Stripclub!!
Best Rachel Dolezal video ever!!!
love uuuu
I think Iggy is 1 of the best EVER!! FRFR!!💯💯💯  + she fineeeee ❤😙
I hope she is genuinely doing good. I love her. She's such a pioneer.

7 million? I see the tour has increased her views
I love the lyrics. The melody and rhythm threw it.
Love your ankles, Iggy!! 😁
shes a fucking legand
I was never an fan of Iggy, she was just another female artist, but this song, the 90s club vibe... I can't stop listening. Serious 20 fingers vibes
PLEASE NO GAY NEXT TİME JUST BEAUTİFUL GİRLS
Watching this video is like looking through gates of hell.
Fast&Furious10 like Vin Diesel behind the truck
She is totes trying to be black
Iggy is so talented and has to work 10x harder than anyone! It astounds me that she gets so much hate from the industry! I will ALWAYS STAN HER! She is such a wonderful person and talented musician
Allabord the ebony pony express!
No one else does it like Iggy. Her bars and delivery is just amazing.

Tô com ódio de vcs suas gays, deixaram a maior rap em videografia se aposentar… ódio eterno
Essa música é boa pra caralho
IGGY PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE US!!!!! WE NEED YOU IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY
Music is bad but I love watching her visuals
I randomly decided to watch the music video for “Work” then came to see this one and let me tell you I’m SHOOK! I didn’t even know those videos were connected and it’s crazy to see her journey basically from the start of her music career to the end. An icon!!!
This video hella empowering… for everyone. Idk why she gets so much hate it’s ANNOYING. Song is a bop and video is 🔥🔥
Yasssss
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amei o look da tur
Iggy 😍😍😍🥳🥳🥳🥳🤩🤩🤩🤩
She is Queen🤩
grown ass men.
So fantastic!
Just me or does her voice sound deeper?
She walked a mile in her Lou Buttons.
Straight benger
You do great work Iggy.
💙💙
😍😍
🔥
I remember reading about how empires collapse. One of the major ones is when they become extremely sexual.
die ersten 13 sekunden sah es toll aus und dann kam ..ni
That ⚫ BLACK HAIR ⚫ 😃😛🤯🥳😲😳🤠😵🥰😊😉🙃🙂😁😄😃😀  And i just saw she is retiring??? NOOOOO.... but if that is what her heart needs 💔.  Glad she gave us a parting gift
♥️
Go back to your other style this style sucks
This is a good ass Club song. Dance to this all night long with a drink in my hand 😁
Fierce shit.
📌@YouTube always interrupts, damage, the numbers of artists like her, others use payola and no one does anything about it, and his other videos were also stolen, stucking the views! #justiceforiggy 🙏🏻🚨
LOVEEEEEE HERRRRRR
nobody likes this video
REPULSIVO
ASCO
Love it ❤️❤️❤️
Omgggg 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Você é rainha amoooooorrrrrrrrrrr
Fode essa porraaaaaaaaa
Hiiiittttt
That poor Givenchy Antigona bag... left behind! Funny that Iggy brought back a bag she wore in London years ago, 2013!
0:03 she really walked a mile
Can someone explain why she looks darker than Cardi b? Why does she look like this
Omg she really did walk a mile in those Louboutins
Love this ❤️ glad you're back Iggy ❤️
The Work outfit, omg I feel so much nostalgia...So sad she's retiring. I wonder what music vid is next!
Whose here from the concert?
Queen!!!
My queen 😭😭😭
Goddess
Queen 🔥🔥🔥😭😭🔥😭😭
amooooo
I will never understand why she and Katy flopped..
gross
Amo todos los trabajos de esta reina! Eres una Queen?
Bischhhhh you betta snatch that Birkin off the ground
Q: Why Iggy add Gays in the clip?
This song is so good!
🤮🤮🤮🤢🤮🤮
Would’ve been hilarious if she was a transformer in the beginning and the strip club came out of her.
So is no one gonna talk about the dancers the house of balmain? Look them up they r 🔥.  Legends hunny
i like the walk in the same outfit as work but what the hell why does she looks like a lightskin black girl after that???
Oh dear god
I love this song! Can’t stop listening to it!
dear iggy, u is fcuking talented. U need a new producer to give u a muddafawkinggg brand new sound. There's a producer from south korea.  His name is pdogg. Go look him up. He is a visionary. Im sure he will offer u a brand new sound like no other. He needs an incredible artist like u to explore new sounds and change the game. I know im not wrong in this. Go find him. U both will break new frontiers.
iggy please dont go cos if u did, the only white female rapper we gonna get is melania trump 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Great song great bass and i don't need to speak about iggy voice it's perfection, the only thing i hate is men dressed like that it's disgusting no one will stay in the club if he saw that.
*Iggy Azalea is THE ONLY ARTIST to call out fake bisexuals like Lady Gaga who POSE as bisexuals just to get closer to the LGBT+ and STEAL our precious resources... our queens, our twinks, and our jocks. STEFANI HAS TO BE STOPPED, BUT YOU’RE ALL STEADY THERE SLEEPING AND BEING INTOXICATED BY HER MUSIC AND HER LGBT+ ANTHEMS. YOU’RE ALL BEING SCAMMED!!!! WAKE UP!!!!!*
Damn iggy amazed me with this one. 😤😤😤
@0:02 why she look like Russian mail order wife
Queen 👑
She is absolutely GORGEOUS!
She looks like cardi b in the first verse 😂🥲
I don't care what anyone says this beat and song is jamminggg. Y'all quit hating on iggy 🙌🙌🙌
I don't care what anyone says this beat and song is jamminggg. Y'all quit hating on iggy 🙌🙌🙌
Dancers are on POINT👆
I don't realize how this preciousness didn't have the boom it needed.  Unfortunately you are delighting their latest album 🥺😪 appreciate because for the moment we will not have more than iggy 😪
😘😘😘
This video is amazing
That's hot hot hot 😘😝😘😝
I DO THE LAPDANCE !!
I AM THE THE STRIPCLUB !
The industry cancelled her years ago, but that will never matter ‘cuz she proved herself as an excellent hip hop artist. The amount of underrated bops she made in recent years is astonishing. Bitches can spit on her name and stay pressed, it’s a compliment to this woman.
This is really good
slaps
I hate that she doesn't get the support she deserves 😤 This is such a Banger and could've had massive success.
Anitters apoiando Iggy
iggy you forgot your purse!
So good
De hueva !! 👎
Amo demais!!
Okay if cardi b released this it would literally be #1 on iTunes. Iggy did not come to play with this album man like omfg

Elle arrive toujours à se renouveler...Bravo
Look the blackface......
I'm sad that she's "retiring" from music... and for good reasons, but I do hope she'll find the motivation and inspiration to work on more music in the future. Until then, I hope she finds success in other projects and personal endeavors! She deserves it.
Utter trash!

i hate how people treat her
The world doesn’t deserve Iggy She’s simply the best of all
I thought Iggy was performing in the park, but it turned out just to be a homeless woman screaming at a pigeon.
What a great concept for a video. Beautiful images at dawn with those gals chucking wheelies! Great stuff.
wow c'est trop biiien
Dora🤑😂😂😁😁
Love the yellow outfit with spikey hair!
She said...stfu
Iggy's opening look reminds me of her  look from "work", doen't it? Maybe it's for the print and bra.
🔥🔥🔥
Zzzzz anyways hit the Bing Ding 24 so you please is EDD thing dancewave getting the door into up it's getting annoying. Scholastica choice on same course we dance ways because Banks weigh
Is it bangs wavy classy science way to get the dance away if you get bangs wavy saying was Clara c x what bank is it getaway dance live is it be easy way school what school did Vicente 12-piece and kind of way sign Scannell Citibanks what is it God or CiCi's

As obras mais fodas são as que têm menos audiência 🔥💜
Walked a mile in the loubatons one last time 😔

What’s up with you and changing skin tones now? Go back to ur “I’m so fancy” era and stay that white girl you are
Damn Love it!🔥 Gay Realness hahaha👌👌👌
I love her fan base is so loyal. As loyal as she’s for putting out masterpieces like The End of an Era
I mean…. It’s the Balmain crew for me ❤️❤️❤️
Guys dressed like and acting like girls in a rap song ......... man bring me back to the 1980's.

Every them song for gay clubs and strip clubs now... Loooovvveeee it
Yaas finaly she made a house music
The album is coming, ahhhhh!!! :)
:D
This is a war crime.
Tudo 😍😍😍
So we obviously are aware that in order to remain relevant iggy has integrated herself into the lgbt community and uses its members almost as tools to gain traction with a hope for a reliable  lgbt audience.
THIS IS A HIT!!!
Queen
https://youtu.be/6xO-PqGKhtU
Brazil is way better than this one, kream is still one of her best
👉STREAM WHILE SLEEPING ON SILENT👈
why is this song so short? its dope!
BABADEIRA MANA 🇧🇷♥️
ELA ENTREGAAAA ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Actually iggy needs much more recognition, his songs are very good people do not appreciate his work
It's ironic that the people who are commenting that she's black fishing are the same ones using skin bleaching products, or using filters to make themselves look lighter and using blonde wigs.
Estou tão ansioso para o lançamento do álbum dessa lenda
Let's Goooo
Vamos fazer mutirão pro álbum
Dia 13 tá chegando aí com tudoooooo
Gente, vocês viram a capa do álbum? Mdsss tá incrível, sério, esse será o álbum da carreira, acreditem ✨❤️😭
Bellísima  y su música pegadiza
Como amo a iggy
acho a Iggy a rapper que tem melhor discografia, os clipes são todos muitos bons, triste q dps do álbum ela vai dar uma pausa na carreira
And how  is the Dj
No Money, no family, Sixteen in the middle of Miami?  bitch now i'm a the stripclub...
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Whenever  I saw dark highways, I literally go straight to Lynch, and it is pretty funny when I see these blokes in the outfit's lady dancers usually wear because it shows you how ridiculous their outfits actually are
End Of An Era in 10 days!!!

Iggy es como el vino con mas años se pone mas rica 🛐😭✋
Bora comentar
I’ve been a fan of iggy for a while but I wish she made more songs that are more serious/ actually talk about real things and issues in her life. For example I loved Rolex, work, don’t need y’all, slo and her other songs that actually talk about something. It’s like she’s purposely trying to make her lyrics bad and ignorant and I just don’t really understand it because I know she’s capable of so much more, and I think it would gain her more respect

allende, se siente!

I love this song 🔥🔥🔥
You are so amazing  Iggy are the best😍🥺

Iggy ❤️💕
❤❤❤
So its okay when an Aussie does blackface? asking for a friend.
She leaves the bag in the road to pay homage to her early song Work
I absolutely love everything about this
release a clean version please!!
Here, before TikTok ruins it
I love being pan, I love everything I see here
Love your music
Little support for such good music
https://youtu.be/sEKqFAlSt64
I like this she needs  more songs like this ..this song brings out her sound
Prefect song to model walk in lol
This is a really great song.
Trash. Pure trash
Iggy = Rachel dolezal
"Of an era?" Interesting.
She definitely did justice! They gay people gonna make this song even more famous yesssssss
Oh yes! This is a hit!

I cant get over the fact she always has hit songs
Adorei o clipe, que homens gostosos, que corpo, que figurino, Iggy arrasou nesse clipe de altíssima qualidade.
Queen
Is Friday an I’m ready to dance 🥺😩😩, fuck COVID, I need a party with this song 😪
I’m the stripclub
I am your biggest fan i would like to meet u one day i like your music u are pretty
Iggy wasn’t just content with ripping off African American music, and wasn’t just content with ripping off African American accents, she just had to rip off their look too. This is dangerously close to blackface.   So inauthentic, and exploiting culture for a profit
i love you iggy

Ooo
She did art and me I’m here to support
Imagine this song in a party 😳😍😍, everything 🤞
Iggy is the best 👌🏼
Is it just me or does she look like Nicki Minaj, Cardi B and Doja Kat at some point in this video.....?
Holly shit this song is disgusting 🤮
I am not an Iggy fan, no shade. But I am living for the House of Balmain!!!  And why she leave her bag on the road tho??
New favourite song and it's my birthday ayyy :P
This is my life's anthem. She is Australian migrant and she works hard like migrants do. And the way she deals with haters makes her my hero and GOAT of female rappers. Hotter than magma

Cadê o feat com o Lil Nas X
She made a video that sounds like a Nicki Minaj song, she's made a video that sounds like Cardi's songs, now she's made one that sounds like a todrick hall song. I really miss it when she had her own vibe in music.
This song & Bounce... ♡

So sad we are not getting more singles for this era :(
Anyone noticed the FLAGRANT black fishing ? 🥵
This has to be one of the worst pieces of "music" ever conceived by the human race. 0 redeeming qualities. Embarrassed to have listened.
I’m sorry but I just can’t get over all these dudes dancing 🕺 like that in the video, legs all up in the air and stuff. Were those men’s half naked butts too. I know I should be more excepting of this but it just doesn’t sit right with me yet
I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee this song!!
Gente que música é essa?😍😍pena que ela vai dar uma pausa na carreira Estaremos ti esperando Iggy😊

Muito boa
I'm excited for her 3rd album, hope its as great as The New Classic and In My Defense!
Haaaaa
Yeahhhhhh 🔥🔥🔥🔥
IM WID IT GEDDIT IGGY 🌪️🙌🏾
Trynna get why there always have to be gay black men…why never asian, white, or ashkenazi jew. No one sees anything wrong with that?
Unfortunately she will make a long break from music after this third album. Still hope she will come back one day. ☹️
Люди шо то робиться, здорові хлопи замість того шоб добру хату поставить, хазяйство до ладу привести, взять косу да піти в поле, тут таке виробляють. Люди милі, то шо воно робиться.
um.. i think you forgot something... 0:11
At first glance,  i thought it was a video from Lil X Nas 🤣🤣🤣🙌
Whoever did the editing is terrible. There aren't enough close up shots. They could've done another scene for the video
NICE!!!
I’m the Stripclub 🔥🔥🔥
Esperando que Iggy saque muy pronto su álbum 😔
Love her music and videos
The music is great. I loved 🦋🔊🥰
Iggy you are amazing!!! Thank you. God and Mommy bless you and enlighten you
Eu te amo muito Iggy! ♥️
Essa ERA vai ser tudo pra minha vida ❤️
Did y’all peep the outfit she has on walking in the beginning she wore that on her work video !!
I feel so sorry for her child and everyone who has kids that thinks this is a good example for them. Pathetic.
eu fico chocada mesmo é com a qualidade do clipe <3
viciada nessa obraaaa
This shit is 🔥
damn iggy, blackfish much lmaoo
This is not music
Sounds a Tik tok song
Amazing as always Iggy! Where the haters are, is where the goods are...and Where Iggy is always a bunch of haters ....why cuz she's fabulous....

Imagina conseguir ser uma artista totalmente independente e que entrega trabalhos totalmente impecáveis e detalhistas... Pois é, a Iggy consegue
Blackfishing...
Anytime I see people riding motorbikes without proper protective clothing I cringe

19.074 dislikes?  jealousy is a desease
Me encanta me enamora
It’s real sad to see how racist the Hip Hop community can be, which as a person of color I find to be very hypocritical!. Music belongs to everyone, no matter the color of your skin, period!. Much love Iggy, show them how it’s done!.
queeeeen !
The outfit she wears in the beginning is also the outfit from her WORK music video 😍😍😍
Клава Кока - Молодец!

I love the beginning reference of her song work

Nobody is talking about her black hair 😩😅
Igyy la mas y ni modo
No puedo dejar de oirla
Извинись!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
First Lola now Strip club. Both are amazing, bop. Yet failed to grab a place on billboard 100 list. Lately Iggy is giving her best in each songs but the ignorance she gets from people is legandary.
It’s crazy how her fans don’t even call her out for blackfishing. I know she’s your God and all and you think she can do no wrong, but she’s clearly blackfishing. She goes from white as snow with the other snowflakes, then darkens her skin with all the black gay men, which is also a lowkey dig at black people, then back to white as snow. And not one of you has called her out on this. Disgusting.
🕺🏽☄️
☺️❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
But let's be honest, who can do all this despite being independent? I don't think y'all know that iggy has to work 10× harder than work in a label. And getting this much views and sales on iTunes while being an independent is quite amazing! I mean imagine if she gets playlisted in streaming services and radio play! This song will be on hot 100 now!

Iggy needs to sign to a label again. She puts out good work but it’s hard to promote and have a hit INDEPENDENTLY. She needs a label backing her.

Iggy is so underrated
The beginning reminds me of the intro of her music video work where she's still walking with her bag
This was some mid and the blaccent is still  ass. Boys served tho 😊
Bitches are hatingggg!!!!!! This tan is not black fishing and this song is a banger
she's wearing the same dress in "work "video music 😁
Hello LGBTQ+ community
I am The StripClub and you? 🔥
This is all Lil NAS's fault!!
the second a black guy started twerking it in my face I'm out. Iggy is the most fake white broad on the planet. whitewash cross over from Australia
It’s the black fishing for me
Exactly what we all needed🖤
Who was on the bike that wasn’t carti
Lot's of smell..
Que mal que no la apoyen siendo talentosa y mirar que  artistas como bad bunny y anuel aa son elogiados con su contenido basura
Omg, is it just me that saw iggy with black hair? 😍😍❤️
Best song in a very long time!!!! Don't listen to the jealous haters....can't believe the hypocritic maniacs out there!
Producer: How many men withs heels do u need? Iggy: -Yes
what a great start to this non-Stripclub day!
I like her... Please don't quit!
IGGY deserves props for this bop and staying relevant in such a volatile industry.
This song is straight trash and the video is just as bad!!!!! You will never hear this song in a strip club!!!!

I didn't know this video was for gay people. They should put a warning. I don't like this video because you think you will see a girl and is a guy. Gays can be on the video, they just have to put a warning so we straight guys don't get our hope up, like her videos used to be, because I don't aroused by guys, and when I see one my dick goes soft.  Iggy makes it hard, but then the gay guys appears and makes it soft again. First and last time I watch this video.
Yaaaaaaas!!! She's Baaaaaaaaaaack Full Force Mofos!! Owww!! Finally... She's this is actually better than Fancy! Whew Chile this beat is fiyah!!

Have you ever stopped to think that 'Mobounce' with a bubblegum chorus like that would easily be a blast on TikTok? Seriously, just think about it, Mobounce, bounce, bounce. Mobounce in the motherfucking, go check it out here on YouTube to see how I'm not delusional!!!
Vocês já pararam pra pensar que ‘Mobounce' com um refrão chiclete daqueles seria facilmente uma explosão no TikTok? Sério, só parem pra pensar, Mobounce, bounce, bounce.  Mobounce in the motherfucking, então vão lá agora conferir o clipe no YouTube pra verem como eu não estou delirando!!!
Não esqueçam de usar a música no TikTok também, okay?

It might suck to say but I swear I only watch these videos cause how hot she is
I never thought that Iggy was good in dark hair.She is so gorgeous on that look.Congrats Iggy-Iggs!

Giving me Christina Aguilera bionic vibes lol
This song is actually fly. She did her thing.
Fuck what twitter says, This is ART. Fight me bitch.
Rapper??? This song sucks. She used to have some decent ones. Here anymore it is just exposing herself  and other. Its like tying a bone around her neck so she can get attention. Alittle self respect goes a long way.

bye- you won't be missed
Iggy isn’t really quitting. All her real fans remember her tweets during the “Sip It” era🥰
Trash
It's not even that bad, it looks like she's over done her fake tan that's all. The black music industry have been targeting her since the start, they don't like when white rappers start making it big. If someone wants to tan to be darker then that's their choice, what's the difference between Nicki Minaj making herself look whiter. Stop being so damn sensitive and get over it.

How old is this song
🤐
imagine how Onyx feels having Iggy Azalea as his mom😍 iconic
Iggy has a perfume business you guys, not making rap music anymore isnt the end of her world. She’s made 15 million dollars off rap, calling her trash means nothing at this point😂
This song hits when high
Iggy isn’t leaving rap permanently. She made a vow to her fans to not stop making music, she makes money off her songs still! Her career is still here years later.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Independent album...no big label behind her.  Shit. I'm here for this bop! 🔥
5 million?
But they don’t wear these shits where I’m from…..🤔🤔
Eu tô muito feliz ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
This song hits when your drunk!!!!
She left her purse
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ 👑👑👑👑👑
I feel embarrassed for the people that think this is good music.
Thumbs up for the Evil Knievel women
Te amo mi hermosa! Eterna Reyna del Rap ❤️
Wowww.. NICE VIBE! OH YEAH.. IT TOOK SOME YEARS Gurl!! Thanks💅

When your music is such garbage, you have to pay YouTube to force feed it to people through ads. Why is this crap promoted on a historical documentary video ffs?
Why did she leave her purse at the beginning?!?!

Please  retire and take the rest of the clowns too haha
I absolutely love Iggy Azalea, I love her music videos and her songs, especially this one.  She is extremely beautiful, sweet, and wonderful.  Iggy is a great artist, performer, and singer, she is  extremely innovative and creative.  She is certainly in a league and class all by Herself, all on Her own.  As a man who is part Norwegian, part Native American...Iggy Azalea impresses Me.   So much so that on my list of Dream Girls of Girls, who I wished I was with right now, Iggy Azalea's name is listed.  Much Love and Support goes out to You Iggy... 💜💜💜
I like how all these pop artists are jumping on the LGBTQ gravy train...
I asked my partner: "who is this artist" without showing him the name of the artist, his immediate response was with: " Cardi B?”. That should just say it all... And he is from Thailand, thus he is Thai.
No.
So Iggy is black now?
Where's Gravity? :(
240k more we got this! Run it up for iggy it's the end of her era!!!

Perfeita demais, meu vício #iggyazalea
I think she looks gorgeous. The blackfishing comments are such bullsh!t. I find it hard to believe anyone with brains would actually think that is what is going on here. I'm sure some lame journalist took a couple of random comments from  social media wrote a story about it and now its a thing ppl are talking about. Her skin dosen't look too dark. But if she did have a tan what is wrong with that? I'm pale as snow in winter but if I want to sunbake I can get a pretty deep natural tan. Oh well at the end of the day publicity can be good or bad i clicked on this video to see what all the fuss was about so all the haters are only getting her more views
This song is so Azealia Banks lol

Venham aqui ao menos duas vezes por dia, e comentem ao menos 10 vezes
Usem a música também o TikTok, ajuda a engajar também
Gente, e se tentarmos fazer uma vaquinha novamente?
Vamos bater um papo?
love the song love the mv
OMG pero que canción tan buena 😻😻😻
Comentem bastante coisas aleatórias
Vocês estão reproduzindo a música no Spotify também, né?
Esses 5 milhões tem que chegar ainda essa semana, okay?
Girl stop trying to be black !! You are white as snow and should be proud of it.
White ppl try so hard to look like poc istg.. iggy 🤡 youre white sweetheart. Stop tryna look Latina
Classy!
Her legacy will never die even when she quits music.
You always will be serving! I love u ms 🥺😍💛💛❤️💛💛
❤️❤️❤️
Wait is she retiring
Cardi B segue a Iggy Azalea, então provavelmente ela deve curtir o trabalho dela, acho que se a Iggy entrasse em contato com a Cardi, acho que ela aceitaria numa boa já que elas sempre falam de apoiar outras mulheres no Rap!
Ad ode to "Work". Had to blink twice!
Imaginem um feat entre Cardi B, Nicki Minaj e Iggy Azalea, com um clipe foda pra car@lhø, e uma música incrivelmente viciante, só imaginem a explosão que iria ser, o YouTube pararia, milhões e milhões de views em seu primeiro dia, #number1 na #billboardhot100 por várias semanas, seria a parceria musical mais transmitidas de todos os tempos, iria marcar uma década inteira, posso estar louco aqui, pensando demais, mas é meu grande sonho:))
Black hair looks great on her. Wow 😮
Essa música é viciante, realmente incrível, mas o mundo não faz nem questão de dar o mínimo de atenção que seja :(
Que tal irmos todos na rede social da Doja Cat e pedir um feat com a Iggy? Oq vocês acham? É só comentar muito Doja Cat ft Iggy Azalea :)
Wait so people can't be tan anymore without accusing them of "black fishing"?
Comentem bastante
Vamos gente, continuem a transmitir
Deve ser horrível odiar essa mulher e não poder chamar o trabalho dela de ruim
Rainha 👑
Let's Gooooo
I think society is a ugly joke almost everyone supports transgender rights which they should but when you see a white person doing their thing with their body you have no right to tell them what to do with their body... if it was the other way around I guarantee nobody would say a word of hate it's a free country and we're not going let you haters change us just because your ashamed of your heritage or your heritage's history...

JUST LOVE
you deserve love
I LOVE YOU IGGY
Real talk, I like this song, It will bang in club, get a party hype, haters need to leave the girl alone, video hott too 🔥🔥🔊
Don't leave 💜🇮🇪

No te merecemos, pero para mi serás siempre la nro 1 ♥
Tickets purchased for Denver  🙌 By myself @iggyAzalea
What mean by end of an era?
I don’t see how people think she looks black, looks white to me throughout the whole video.
Tá fazendo só 100k de viws por dia, precisamos aumentar isso. Não façam com que a Iggy desista da carreira por favor
Iggy, you don't need to quit music forever, let others say whatever they feel like, just ignore
Ya done Iggy.. bye Felisha!
Perfeitaaaaaaaa ❤️
Woke up like a bad ass b!tch
I miss her old songs like "black widow" and "trouble"
Let's run it up to 5 mil 💪🤩🤑
❤❤❤❤
😀😍🤩
Id like to thank you for ruining hip hop
all my mornings start strong thanks to this song!
Nice song who cares if she looked “a bit darker” for this video, Michael Jackson wanted to look whiter (but he was probably bleaching his skin to look whiter which probably had affected his Vitiligo skin condition) but with her just because she looked a bit darker everyone wanted to target her, oh well people are just going to find excuses for their condemnation and criticism.
Gorgeous!
What a sh$t! 💁‍♀️
Iggy queen of rap
Michael jackson changed his colour to white , iggy changes to black.  Do americans realize how toxic their country is?
Queen
Enviando amor pra Iggy Te amo rainha
Iggy I love you
Iggy queen of rap, I love you
100% she's trying to change her colour. Im glad she moved to the US . Australia doesnt want her
Ain't nobody blame Nikki fo wearin dem blonde wigs how yawll gon pounce on Iggy and do her like that?  I'm not even black.
Is she in black face?
I love it
🤣😂white women crazy. They wanna be black soooooooo bad
Terrible. It exploits ballroom culture as much as black culture.
Loved the nod to Work at the start.

Iggyyyyyyy ls estas dando, ya veo tu momento llegar de nuevo,  te amo ♥  apoyemos a iggy :3
Y’all so pressed about ‘black fishing’. How is it black fishing for having brown hair and a tan? Acting like POC are the only race who have those features SMH the ignorance and victimisation
Y’all bitching about her hair being black and her tan, she literally wears the same make up and all she did was put on a wig and y’all are pressed? How sad. She’s been through shit since day one, I don’t blame her for quitting music. Some of y’all are hateful and cruel! She deserves better!
I love this song!!! 😍
this song is TOO SHORT!!!
Lol
Girl bye . I really liked you but the blackfishing is too much for me

Thank you for respecting the ballroom community IGGY!🥺💙
No brain just a pit where you will see when you time come.  The place will not protect you like it does me.
Everyone talking about her tan, well if you walked on a desert road that long you gonna be bronze too
Not her culture appropriating and black fishing

Pobre Iggy ya nada le pega! Haga lo que haga no es un hit! En lo personal siento que perdió fuerza con el cambio de cara, esa cirugía se llevó su suerte... Aveces no necesitas talento solo suerte, y ella, ya no la tiene 🤷🏼‍♀️

Pena que termina
She’s wearing different loubiutuns from the work mv.
i am sorry where are the hate comments? she is literally blackfishing
She isn't even a true rapper.  Ghost writer on all songs, can't freestyle, and since TI stopped ghostwriting for her, who even knows she exists anymore???

Sip It vs I Am The Stripclub which one is better?
This video would have more than 12 million if YouTube had not erased the views for a week.

A música parou nos 4 milhões e não saiu nunca mais, os fãs e a iggy desistiram desse som, depois não reclamem que a mulher vai se aposentar!

All she did was dyed her hair black... And did a Cardie b thing
I think that this is her best song everrrr
Addison is better than this fraud.
Iggy cada vez trayendo arte 👀
this must be one of the best anti plastic-surgery spot ever.
horrible video.
Huge dislike because of the trans looking dancing men....
Love u Iggy 🥺😪😍
Cardi B looks so fucking good here omg
Это че за огромный Минаж?!)))
This was is insulting. Literally Iggy wearing black face with her pasty self. She is trying so hard. Just quit Iggy.
🍑😍😍 love uuuuuuuuu 🇰🇷
Iggy making a comeback!!!
Azealia Banks vibes lol
Iggy 😍😍😍😍

Este video tiene menos visitas, estaba teniendo casi 1m por dia y hoy tiene 4.3m a la semana, algo está muy mal 😣
Iconicaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAA, lowkey wanna be the strip club too.
Party anthem 🥳🤟
México te ama 🇲🇽
I love song… iggy❤️❤️
She looks like Nkkki Minaj
I wasnt sure if the dancers are guys or girls - and i like it
Summer 2021 just got more sweaty! ❤️

Gente a iggy e um ícone! Se ela parar a carreira vai fazer muita falta
Iggy with dark hair gives me major Cher vibes

Se merece más visualizaciones!!!
Why she look black?

Damn! What a sequel.
If you look at fancy the vid she made shes WHITE wtf
New alarm to wake up!! 😻
I love Iggy and I'm dying about the blackfishing seriously like where? Black women don't need to claim that Bruh she just look like a white girl with an angry 😡 tan, you know like a member of the well known and often misunderstood tribe from the shores of New Jersey 😂  Reference Snooki
Highhhhwaaaay to  hell!
Quien de mexico?
Te amoooo
Love u queen
No te retires Iggy😔💛
👎 ты всё испортила этим клипом
Sounds like a Big hit
She got a massive tan 😳
ELA É O CLUBE DE STRIP CARALHOOO 😍😍❤❤❤
LEGEND ❤❤❤❤
Se alguma revista famosa não listar essa música de melhores de 2021, "eu juro que desisto de viver". 😞💖
É isso que vocês querem? Ver essa artista foda pra caralho desistir po conta de outras pessoas idiotas?
Acho que a Iggy precisa de uma grande parceria musical, imagina se ela voltasse com Charli XCX novamente em um suposto ‘Fancy 2.0'  a Internet iria pirar 😏😁😍
Essa mulher só não estoura nas paradas musicais pq o mundo não quer olhar pro trabalho dela, nem sequer vêem pra saber se tem qualidade
Não vamos deixar a Iggy desistir assim tão fácil, é isso que os haters querem ver
This album needs to revolutionize the pop world and show everyone that one of today's greatest artists is right here in front of us :)
the world does not deserve this woman's talent 😔
Ela é foda, e o bom é que ela sabe disso, Iggy é foda, Queen fornecer❤️💖❤️
O mundo não merece o talento dessa mulher 😔
Eu espero que a Iggy finalize seu último ano na música com chave de ouro, End of En Era possa ser aclamado pela crítica, seja bem recebido pelo público, pegue um Top10 no Spotify Global e na Billboard200 .... e consiga emplacar ao menos um Hit :)
NO DEJEMOS MORIR ESTE TEMAZO:( IGGY MERECE MAS RECONOCIMIENTO. Ya dijo que debido a la negatividad que recibe el próximo álbum que saque será el último de su carrera:((
Went from Twitter earlier, and Iggy announced her departure from the music industry because she can't take all the negativity anymore. 7 years of hatred is enough. Literally her upcoming album is THE END OF AN ERA so enjoy while she's here. We will miss you Iggy! Take care always and Onyx❤
Blahhh
clearly inspired by azalea banks - but i’m not over the fact that a blonde yt aussie is wearing a foundation 10 shades too dark and putting on a Black southern accent, not to mention capitalizing off the Black queer community as well as sex workers. i really hate it here.
Te la rifaste
Queen
The best 😍🤩💗
kick it like judo is just factually incorrect
I didn't know iggy was black hmm
Love you iggy! Love your music!!! It Makes me feel like a bitch!! I love it
Iggy makes every outfit LIT AF 🔥🔥
Pretty sure Kim Kardashian and Anitta wore that same stripe outfit.
🤬😂😂😂
not black people getting butthurt about darker skin and claiming dark skin too... wtf is blackfishing even? BLACK PEOPLE DONT OWN DARK SKIN!!! TF.. Just like black people claim dreads but they DID NOT originate dreads... damn.. yall love playing the victim...
Same Outfit in the beginning as in Work from 2013? :D
you deserve so much more   i love yo 🥰
Love you 😍😍
Niiice! We reposted on trap.LA
bit is sick! LOVE IT
Vamos dar apoio e valorizar o trabalho da Iggy, fazer ela mudar de ideia e não deixar a música, ela é super talentosa e merece ser reconhecida como artista e rapper.
blackfishing
This is awful. Not blackfishing my ass. This girl needs to just love her white self and stop gaslighting black folks with her excuses smh. All the men of course black too in the video. Kardashian vibes all over.
Não deixam essa música morrer!

Iggy haciendo referencia a su canción "work", es una gran artista y me siento muy feliz por todo lo que ha logrado!
I think this is her best song 🥰🥰🥰
So this is what a Nice White Girl does when she wants to be bad. She gets to be the nice White Girl as needed but makes money being the Bad Black Girl. Pretty disgusting.
Número uno spanish 🇩🇴number one English 🇺🇲
Ok so this is a gay anthem? It probably will get alot of spins in that scene but nowhere else.
Esta Canción Es Una Obra De Arte...🥰

YouTube para de tirar as views, por favor:(. A Iggy não merece isso!
Amuuuu vcccc❤❤❤❤❤👏👏👏❤❤
Pq a internet tem que ser tão cruel com pessoas que se esforçam muito duro pra entregar um trabalho divertido e de qualidade?? :/
EU QUERIA TANTO VER ESSA MULHER NO TOPO NOVAMENTE 😞😞
Quem ficou triste com a notícia que a Iggy deu sobre uma pausa na carreira?? :(
the lies she be telling.  it's a shame. all fame fades eventually.  but once you've sold yo soul to the devil you can't buy a new one.....🤦🏼‍♂️
Não deixem flopar por favor, o YouTube está boicotando mas continuem dando muito Str3am

Guys stop using emojis when commenting. Apparently it freezes the views. Keep on streaming y'all.  Watch 2 other songs/videos before you come to watch the Video again. If you keep on replaying from the same tab they might update the views just to delete the views later on. So Guys,  stream correctly.
Blackfishing my balls! Her tan looks stunning, people can’t handle the fact that she is the best rapper and she is white at the same time.
No one strip club in the whole video 🤣

I love this banging beat ! 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
In India we love whitefishing..
This is so insulting to Black people. She’s a white woman promoting images of black people that are provocative. Where are the White trans women or white men dancing provocatively?  Why is she showing Black folks in the strip club and even darkened her skin as if she is Black to indicate Blacks are the only strippers. Then when she is clothed and being sensual it’s okay to be her white self. This is an attack on Black culture and People. Let’s fight this imagery! It is too much! This is sick and I hope she pays a price for this.
Amazing!!!!!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Amethyst ♡
Iggy did not come to play 🧡❤️🧡

Gente a iggy e braba
1out of 5 in july
Crap ....
So this is the video that she is being accused of black fishing, only reason why I found the video was to determine this accusation myself. A few points:  1. Her accent in music is much different than in her interviews, where she sounds like a normal person with a very nice Australian accent. Seems to me that she is portraying a very “urban” persona with an extremely “urban” accent. Having said that, she is an entertainer. Much like an actor, entertainers often play roles which do not align with who they are in real life.   2. Why don’t black people get accused of appropriating white culture when black females dye their hair blond, wear colored contacts, and straighten their hair? However, when a white person does something like this, they get accused of appropriating black culture?   3. I can see why she is being accused of appropriating black culture. At the very least, she is appropriating an urban culture, which I don’t think she authentically represents, considering that may not be her life experience. However, she is an entertainer and that’s what she feels her fans want to see and hear.   It is rather odd for a white person from Australia to act this way, but remember, that is the identity that the music industry created for her, based on what I am sure is some kind of study that determined that folks wanted to see a good looking white girl rap.   Live and let live. If you don’t like her, don’t listen to her. The reality is that the same people faulting her, are the same people that support alternate forms of reality as truth.
Where is the band?
come throw 1s at that wet roastie
In the BLM era, this isn't working. She just needs to rap like the white person that she is. No more affectations.
A Iggy subindo na moto me lembrou a Pabllo em amor de que
Youtube stop deleting views challenge

Oh hell naw😔 the agenda is real
If it wasn't for Youtube being weird we might got even 6 million views already
cool!!!!
I can't wait until the extended version!
Dame is she black they definitely tried to make her look black
This is some bullshit and you know it! Please stop it! You are a stain on our culture. And T.I. is to blame as well.
She really committed to the whole LGBT+ thing. Respect
I love you Iggy 🥺💖
im sorry but the skinshade...
Hmmm, who hears azealia banks beats??
😍😍
Apart from the part that she’s beautiful inside and out she’s a GREAT rapper.
The song is awesome and the music video nice with those chicks doin' tricks on bikes but the part with the truck was disgusting except Iggy obviously.
I'm white, think Scandanavian whiteness, in other words very very white in color.  So is Iggy Azalea.  This is disgusting that this woman is appropriating not only black culture but blackfishing.  The music isn't bad, why not let your music speak for itself?
Why she need to tan, it looks ugly anyway lol.  I don't get it.
🔥🔥🔥
😎😎
Wtf how she go from a pale ass white girl to having damn near bronze colored skin 🤦🏾‍♂️
Love the black hair
❤❤❤❤

💛🖤
I dont know why people called her blackfish, but i dont think so she wants to be black , she already made her career as white chick ....also if she got tanned a lil more for this video, many black chicks light their skin in real life , not just for video purpose, just saying ! 🙂
this shit is garbage..
This had 4.1 million views last night.... why is it down to 3.9 today?
💥💥💥
How she gonna be the strip club and she aint swing on a pole or shake no ass? Girl bye...

From Russia mother with love. Вот в Москве то пуканы порвало бы, если бы наши кто снял такой клип. :)))

Youtube is removing views to the video, should have more and continue uploading, but it's the opposite...
Guys YouTube keep deleting views from iggy now guys plz let's stand up for this matter
the blackfishing is strong with this one
iggy doesn’t care abt commercial anymore. just the sound of her art and i’m so here for it
😴

They deleted views. THEY’VE BEEN CAUGHT RED HANDED. It’s now back at 3.9 million?
Finally Iggy is back from classic
Le siguen sacando reproducciones 😡😡

Ru paul - Call me mother feat Iggy Azalea remix? hahahaha
youtube keeps deleting her views her video went from 4,100,000 to 3,900,000 iggy will never win if they keep boycotting her like this. its so unfair for her.
I can't make it through this video. This is awful.
what the hell is wrong with the views 4.1 to 3.9(4.1 it was at the morning time) but now during the start of the video it was showing 4.9 then 3.9 you tube sucks
She looks like a Cardi B reject
Wow what lyrics!!! “ I am the stripclub”!!!Totally makes sense!!! Great music too!!! The fuckin world is goin in the right direction!!!
The views bruh
From 4.1 mil views to 3.9????
My new anthem 🔥
hey, youtbue is taking away views as a step from 4 million to 3.9 million???
Trash!
TRASH
From 4,146,000 to 3,931,000 real quick?!??? Why the F YouTube kept on deleting the views????
The song is a big thumbs down for me but I still like some of her other songs.
This would have more than 15M views if YouTube didn't delete views
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Hino
Iggy stopped mattering five years ago so she moves on to painting herself darker in her unending spiral of trying to be relevant. You're not. go away.
where as all the views gone from this morning?
🤮🤮🤮
‼️🔥
This is such a good club song
Gente, o que está acontecendo que a toda hora some as visualizações.?
Yasss queen!!!
Haters are Hatefishing.
its a bop!
Congratulations Iggy, you finally finished your transformation ❤ Finally you can say n-word like other female rappers 👍👍
Kylie e vc ? 🤩
Being real, I was so disappointed when IA released black widow. Thought it was a sure sign of a short career. Her new stuff is absolutely excellent. If this was her follow up it’d be 1B views. Can’t believe she does this as an independent artist. Mad love.
She black fishing & gay fishing😳
This is terrible😑 this won’t get played in king of diamonds. A gay strip club yea. Seems like these artist are using the lgbt wave to grab an audience and it’s predictable now
Princesa do rap
YouTube again shooting views of the damn video.
Why tf are y'all sleeping on this??? Because she's white? Girl let's get past it, she's more fire than she ever was imo.
THEY BEEN SLEEPING ON IGGY FOR TOO LONG!!! A RAPPER, A SHOW GIRL AND A FASHION BEAST ALL IN ONE! If you don’t get it you’re BASIC! Sorry, NOT SORRY!!
This is the most important song of a generation!..amazing…
I live for the dancers ❤❤
My summer anthem
People need to grow up calling it blackfishing how is that far when it's acceptable for the film white chicks joke
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Soooo good, but why the end of an era ? Supposed to be the beginning…
Trashhh
❤️❤️❤️❤️
What is it with singers trying to become gay icons after they've lost their fame?  It's so forced.
WT.F is this S

Why is Youtube deleting views? This so unfair to any artist that doesnt have a major label backing them
Let's reach 10million views!
YouTube please stop removing views from this video :(
So if this is the end of an era, what is she going to do next?
Well... You should thank the haters. Only here cause people bitching bout somthing stupid and had to see for myself. Ya'll just giving her exposure she probably wouldn't have had before lmao. Congrats your attempt to cancel made her more popular
Love it
I like the song but not like listen to it on radio like it
This video is the shit because of the DANCERS 👯‍♂️
It’s just nice to see men in raunchy outfits instead of women always having to show their skin all the time
I freaking love this song!
Muy buena
1 week later and still trending on YouTube 🔥
This is a bop
Gurlll that's black fishing at its finest
The flow, the beat and rap are on point, but this song is trash and a step backwards.
What the fuck is this ...
Damnnnn mama 🥵🥵🥵
this is a bop, now come on now
Wait has she been walking down the street in the middle of nowhere in the same outfit for 8 years!?
Nice spray tan
it’s giving .... black fishing
GIRL YOUR BAG 😩😩😩
Not seeing how she's blackfishing here. The black hair makes her look more like a Kardashian then anything else..
‘Kick it like Judo…’ .. great
sounds like pride song
BARBIA
I see why people are saying "Why is her skin so dark?" 😐 There's nothing wrong with being white with plastic surgery
This song makes me want to left my work and act like “I am the stripclub”
This is obnoxiously toxic but still a bop. I guess thats rap these days
This sucks
Beauitful Poppin Ass Iggy......Show Out Then Girlllll Yessssss!!!!# Snap Snap Snap My Fingers To This ☺
It would be with more than 6 million views if YT did not delete the views.
why her makeup like she different person? or she did something on her face
I want her to succeed but her flow is horrible.  Sorry
I’m so sick of culture vultures
Iggy with dark hair is a whole different level 🔥
Idc she is queen of bops and her personality is so attractive.
L I T 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
SHE DO LOOK DARKER
You are literally pretending to be Black. This is blackface/ blackfishing. This is NOT okay.
Trash
Yes! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Vamos lá bater 5M

Meh
So she started off white and thennnnn this odd complexion that isn’t natural to her but natural to others
Hook Sucks!
WOW!!!!
Miss Iggy took the assignment, understood the assignment, and gave us extra credit💀Like these visuals are so simple yet one of the most creative visuals I've seen all year from a female rapper
Where's the guy from the Sway interview when you need him 😂😂😂😂
I used to see Bhad bhabie with tanned skin like this too but no one talk about her.
Vamos de entrar nos trends novamente

Um....Im loving how this video begins like her video "work" . That is clever!
💛💛💛💛
I'm lovin 'it
Nao sei. Estranho.
Iggy said “I’ve served pussy for years, now it’s time to serve Bussy” she really stays giving the gays the respect ✊🏼 a legend and an ally
I love the intro... she continued the video of the song work ♡

unhealthily obsessed😭🙌🏻⚡️‼️
Im sorry  no offense to the LGBT community.. but i could've went without the drag queens. As apart of her heterosexual fanbase... she kinda lost me here🤷🏾‍♂️
This is utterly and ridiculously stupid, why do you people like this nonsense?  There’s literally nothing good about it, especially the noise you call “music”, it’s just awful and void of anything good. Puke.
why sis look black??
Perfeito
🥰🥰🥰🥰
🥰🥰🥰🥰
🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛
she is back bitchess!!
Sigue siendo tendencia después de 6 días de estreno. She is comingggg
The funniest part of this video is people worried about her black fishing they don't care about the fact that most of the black men in the video are portrayed as gay
Blackfishing!
Damn can they dance or what!!! Awesome dance song
Did she turn black or im I trippin?
I love that the men are dancing and the women are riding the motorcycles. It's perfect.😄
so
❤️‍🔥
Love you
i dunno why but that video give me some vibe with the old school song with EVE and gwen stefani
how is she still making music?
Esperaba algo como Kream 2.0☹️
🎤 I am .. looking like Cardi B” 🧐
Soo...She's black now?
ESTO DEBERÍA TENER MAS REPRODUCCIONES .....
REAL PRINCESS OF RAP
Tf is this?! this is just as bad as Waow Vicky. Pretending she is a woman of color. She using cultural appropriation for her personal gain.
Youtube What's wrong whith the viewsss?
It’s giving Legendary
😠😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😡🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
and this is why i stan iggy
Slay queen 👑 She gave the gays what they want!
I’m only here cause of the backlash she got about this video saying she wore dark hair and tried to make her skin darker to be black. Sorry to say she looked white through the whole did not see where her skin look darker ok she had black hair for a short minute but guess what I know a lot of white girls born with natural black hair or dark brown to appear black. I think they just want to pick on her
this is so shit💀💀
That cute little frock from “Work” getting picked up by the party monster truck.
Guys in fishnets n heels gross wtf keep losing my faith in humanity day by day 😑🤢🤮🤢
Me encanto
HITTTTTT
I ammmmm the stripclub
Princessss
Iggyyyyy
BLACKFISHING/BLACKFACE AT ITS BEST…….🤨
Amei já fazia tempo que a igui não fazia uma música boa 😀
Linda
OMG, a white woman trying to be black. Has the world really sunk so low?
VINCE STAPLE's FLOW RIPED-OFF !
Nikki Minaj's voice sounds super different in this music video....
Addicted Song Club
All this time was Iggy lost in tropics???
Top of the line, caliente!!!
Yes
she does look darker but if she was wearing her blonde hair and not a black wig nobody would bat an eye, not even a fan just my two cents... also are there even any black people who are on her about "blackfishing?" Or is it all white saviours...
Nope
OMG!! OMFG!!!! I ❤ THIS!!!
No necesito tu amor ni tus problemas 💜
Go go go iggy
Text book model of blackfishing, down to using the house of Balmain to top it off with cultural appropriation.
No one else tired of seeing dudes in heels and fishnets?
it's still addictive, what a good song!
Black dude here:  I see no blackfishing about this. Also, it's very ok for any human being to dress anyway they like so far as they are not making A MOCKERY of its originator.   No one is blackfacing here.  Why can't white women do cornrows or do any hairstyle regardless of the tradition surrounding it? Black women LITERALLY in huge 9x out of 10x are ALWAYS wearing Asian, Persian, Caucasian looking weave - faux or real, - produced from some child labor sweatshop or shaven from the scalp of some kid in India or China.   Black culture is for all to appreciate and respect just like every single culture on PLANET EARTH that respects human dignity. Respect is all that's needed.   Yes, Black culture like any other  is for all. If you have an issue as Black person then please, never get on a plane, drive a car, heck leave Europe and America and go back to Africa.   Yeah I said it and I'm full blown back Black man with a Black wife and black kids.   This is getting crazy out here.   If a white chic can rock nice locs ... let her rock it WTF.   Y'all been giving China over $3BN to wear white looking hair and ain't none y'all even had the gumption and drive own 1% of that weave fake industry. Feeding a country that is the most racist on earth towards Blacks (#2 most racist is India)  all that money and yall complain about unemployment. Yeah, I went there. Fcuk IT!  Put yall energy in that. Calling out decent white artistes for blackfishing  .... meanwhile you're driving a BMW and raving how it's the best. Them Nazi folk tech is what you like huh? Aint you Germanfishing. TF!  None y'all ancestors had nothing to do with the automobile invention itself. That's all white sh*t. Are y'all Whitefishing when 99% of what's in your homes are all White inventions? GTFOH.    We are not exclusive as Blacks. No race or culture is. We are not special than Whites. We are not better than Whites.   Yes, racism is fcuked up. We know.  And by the way,  White people need to a MUCH BETTER JOB Calling out yall messed up retard racist uncles and crazy. Yes, racists are RETARDS --- BITE ME!   Slavery SHOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN ... HELL TO THE NO!....   BUT that doesn't mean Whites are doomed to never ever ever appreciate anything Black. Let it go. A white chic or white dude can wear black "stuff" so far as they're not making A MOCKERY of it.   When yall been shooting up the block in yall Escalades, are you misappropriating White Culture? Tech is white culture ... don't even start an argument on that. Where is the Black people  telescope that first saw the stars? Exactly. White Culture.
Is this the video the woke crowd is pissing themselves over?!
LMAO This song is straight trash
She looks more Latina than black, I don’t get the blackfishing
This has so little views
Can white girls act white
YouTube is deleting views
Youtube supprime des vues
Princessss

Honsletly why is this not longer?  I FUCKING LIVE for this vibe ! Iggy is just fire when she goes cak cak cak BOOM 💥 ❤️🏳️‍🌈
This is one of the worst things ever recorded on video.
Tom McDonald tomorrow 🔥 you already kno
She was def trying to make a club hit here. Everyones going to be clubbing to this song!
Hell all she did was get tanned and dark hair who cares. Jenner does this shit and then some. Plllleasseee move on.
My battery: 1%  Me: listens this song  My battery: I'll wait

👁️🕳️👁️

🔥❤️
Amoo demais!!!! 💎❤️
Gay No thanks.
Iggy be lookin' man like.
Eyes.. i need bleach... now!
black queen😩
This bout to be the anthem for every gay club and I’m here for it.
Poser always try but they will never be the real thing. Black women deserve better.
Oh I don’t know. The video is giving a lot of creative people work. She may be getting some flack , but so did Hollywood with soooo many pictures. Congrats to the unseen  photographers  for a great video.
why did you leave the purse? what was in it?
apparently Iggy listened to Isaiah Rashad’s headshots a few times before making this song 🙄
I was here for the Blackfish but my outrage shifted to that bag she left on the road!!!
I really don’t see how she could be accused of blackfishing in this she literally only changed her hair color
I love it 🥰
YAASSSS🔥
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Just read an article of how she was getting hate for “black fishing” cause she looks darker.. yea not seeing it I’m not a die hard iggy fan but I see what she said lighting setting a club theme and a hair color change..idky people have the need to keep canceling her..but this is today nothing always being made into an issue..besides that this songs a total bop and I’m sure will be very well loved in the lgbt community.
All of the dollars
Just need all of
Perfeitaaaaaa 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
#DeepHouse #HipHouse
It’s the blackfish for me!!!
Iggy: nah I ain't dancing, I'll just lay here 😅🥰
I like it.. but maybe because it sounds soooo much like azealia banks 212 song (which is one of my fave songs of all time) go listen and compare
What a vibe of a video
When did iggy decide she is black
when you wear a black wig and tan so hard that you look like discount cardi b.. which again not aspiring to much. (i hate all these 'women' 'rappers')
she's tryin to be Cardi B... which is not aspiring to much if you ask me.
😂🗑
😍😍😍woow
She sounds like a man how df is she even someone out there jheez
Yesss iggy come thru love her
Needs more views
The road  remained me of  Son of anarchy
The best video 🥰
She knew this song was for the gays
Up.
*MODERN DAY BLACKFACE AT ITS FINEST*

JUDO? Judo is about throwing and using your opponets reactive energy. No kicking striking.
We know you have talent girl but why did you think blackfishing was the way to go? That ain't it sis.
Ok… this is blackfishing :( I like Iggy so much, this is a let down.

Seen this after the black fishing controversy and honestly I could careless about her skin tone I just wanted to see if the ass was still looking good after a couple years and good god yes she still thicker than a king size snicker.

This is hype! Love it 🇦🇺  what a banger!!
fuckkkkkkkkkkk yassssssssssssssssssssssss bissssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh !!!!! this song is whole new vibe <3
Elevation of mind, elicited by exotic flavours embellishing an emerald green island, renders me enticed up onto a cliff by the secretive sea. With my intuition freely expanding upon interaction with the mystical wind, I am able to feel the soothing view reaching out to me. Just before time is about to fully lose its grip on the aquatic animation, relaxed reflection approaches me with the offer of setting sail for a world record at 123 457 decimals, embedded in spiritual waves, and as my gaze returns with questions regarding whether or not the memorization this time might require of me to deal with the hardships of swimming stubbornly, and thus parting ways with any risk of drowning in surreal slumber down the road, supportive exhaustion lets my eyes close to guidance from the timelessly expressive rhythm of waves. Then, in the midst of the tranquil heartbeats of time, starting with the sound from a dam of clouds rupturing up above, followed by an unfolding waterfall of sunrays spoiling my focus with red-violet nuances over my eyelids, is when my restless reflections realize the opportunity to fall back into the hands of a wind falling up in the profound sky, and upon their granted release at vibrant heights they could be perceived migrating, free as birds, towards heavenly and levitating landscapes. Speeding through the atmosphere, tuning in to its intrinsically inspiring symphony, they surrender to falling into a vividly deep dive through rings of rejuvenating sunlight, up until the blinding increase in energy has the passage of breathing scenery spiralling spontaneously. Streched out like wings belonging to an eagle, embracing the environment, they eagerly take up snorkeling in an ocean of clouds, leaving behind a shockwave of bubbling foam followed by dolphins, whose skyhigh harmony unloads a barrage of thoughtful beings towards the increasingly bright light over the sea surface, in which they end up being swung between elastic noses of dolphins to the point where my each and every reflection jumps on the opportunity of taking the shape of pinballs displaying a madly agile smile. Enwrapped in hypnosis by the large number of falling stars, they eventually find themselves escorted by them cuddly telepathic players navigating through layers of darkness on the ocean floor and all the way to the awaiting foot of an undersea volcano, where the glowing flow of energy sends them scaling up the deceptively ancient structure, on top of which the crunch from their scintillating expectations brings the following moment to shoot my reflections right out into the arms of the heavenly kingdom. Whilst immersing themselves in the luxurious feeling from slowly journeying through fluffy air, little did they anticipate the emerging slope rendering them rolling downhill and closing in on a looming loop in which they would be thrown around and plunged up somersaulting with phenomenal grace in the rain of applause from stars gathered in graceful formation, all until reflecting thoughts come falling from the sky only to land bouncing between mirages of palm trees preceeding the distracting sound from whirlwinds dancing to the golden sound of solar energy being agelessly unleashed. Refreshingly weakend by all the involving heat, a rinsing river leaves the thoughtful forces cruising alongside radiant rays suddenly starting to transform into harmoniously homing missiles, and the very moment my every reflection is given the green light to rocket itself all the way up to its exclusively desired, groovy viewpoint inside of the celestial sphere and behold future memories of waves of light diving divinely into the living water, fast-forwarding fantasy opens the door for the gravitational field of reality to spin around. Charged with handsomely hightening homesickness, they fall like a burning bolt of lightning all the way down into a path of steaming water vapour, which they rally past with thunderous rolls leading into a visual field painting the verdant island with earthshaking and electrifying precision, and despite insightful inspiration teasing the idea of soaring reflecting in the gloriously unexplored wreath of water, reflections of mine depart with unregretful acceleration for the bobbing boat, atop the mast of which they reappear nosediving into a movement of resplendent pirouettes.        As the unassumingly captivating sound from unexplored waves allows my awareness to slowly reunite with a horizon now surrounded by a welcoming glitter, compelling excuses comprising a complex layer have been completely brushed off from my eyes by the digitally composed breeze. Through its filters still, emblazoning rays reign supreme along with an invitation to let my views widen visibly within a vegetation of subtle details, frequenting my heart as a round sound proudly providing a pulse now bearing the stamp of evermore overwhelming serenity, knowing that the moment I merge with the lyrical gurgle around the finish line, my adventures will have all just begun. Then finally, while sunrays keep treating me free fireworks blossoming out over the ocean surface, my breath is accompanied by a weightless wave of wildly vibrating vitality, the most intriguingly imperious tone of which triggers a fearless dive off the cliff with my eyes closing slowly to the blazing body of water casting a sentient crystal shine all throughout my ignited mind   If you liked what you just read and want more, google lulu where you´ll find Mind of Secrecy for only 5 USD! I´m Henrik from Sweden, and the pleasure was all mine!
That’s racist
She looks smokin as a brunette.

This video is great. I'm not even really into rap anymore, but Iggy's super beautiful, and this is club material. Awesome job, Iggy! And that blackfishing nonsense is just crap. Sick of that $hit. She wore a black wig. Woopty do.

I’m loving this song more and more day after day I listen to
❤️
Anyone else remember when she was told to get the F off the radio cause she can’t free style … I mean someone’s writing her stuff for her and girls have no game in bed and what I say before hand is a warning label and dats fact
Saw the words Iggy and Stripclub and got all excited.  Then she trolled us with the cross dressers.
love you iggy
The dancers was FIYAH!!!!!!!!!
We need an album iggy or a mixtape
Khatri londe h yha😂
These vibes are what we need!! Nobody at the music industry produce some like this!! Without pop vibes about #Britney, #Rihanna, #KatyPerry, #Ariana, #NickiMinaj, #JlO, etc... Thanks Iggy ever and ever! 🔥🖤🔥
🔥
Ok I love her, and she is all the stripper I need and those Queens ofc
to anyone thinking shes trying to pass off as a black artist... try this wigger , BHAD BHABIE feat. Kodak Black "Bestie"
Trending @ #1 is necessary c’mon y’all
THIS IS SOOO GOOD
it's funny how she wears at the beginning of the mv the same clothes as the work song, in the road like it's related 🤣
queen love t song
I think she looks bad s in the black hair. Rock it girl.💯🤩🙌❤
Façam trend com essa música no tik tok, Kwai, insta ou qualquer outra rede social. Precisamos hitar esse hino
What about the bag🤔😪😪😪😪😪
Check out the TikTok drummer cartoon buffoon to this one
SHE'S ALL TRANS NOW BUT IN A GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD WAY ! SLEEK LIBERATING DIVINE !!!! ^^
Sis ate

So because she has a slight tan and brown hair in part of the video, she’s blackfishing. I’m all for calling out bullshit when it’s relevant, but this is a stretch y’all. Also, this songs bops.
Bueno aquí las del fandom de Louis que viene a apoyar esta canción  Pd: me gustó mucho
I don't see any signs of blackfishing here. Her skin tone is tinted bronzer like that glow people usually go for when in the tropics. Blackfishing was a very poor term to attempt to slander. I'm not a fan, I do enjoy a few of her songs. From what I saw the video was flashy, fun, gave LGBTQ some shine regardless of skin color, her on the motorcycle reminded me of Gwen Stefani.  Just good, vibes nothing reckless.
Escandalo....amei..
Perfect bitch
€ j'aime bien...
Caliente!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Alot of these chicks think they automatically gonna make a bag if they quit their job and get into sex work.... The market is overly flooded by now 😂 you're new and fresh today... Used up by the end of the week in alot of eyes, so be careful and use your 🧠
Love you Iggyyyy 😍😍
The best !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Teyana Taylor did it first🙄💥 it’s sad how other artist can steal from other artists and act like they did it first bitch please stop blackfishing  never be a black woman never ever get over it
This is a CLUB SONG. not gospel, stop complaining on it not being “deep” 🤦🏾‍♀️
😍😍😍😍😍
This is how lit the party was supposed to be in the movie Party Monster #CLUBKIDS
It keeps going higher on the trending page. Iggy is a queen
Those gays so sexy as fuc

No superó está canción, me pone en modo perra, saludos desde Medellín
Hino injustiçado kkkk
Crazy to think that in as you grow more old this song will turn to *nostalgia.*
Iggy really brought pride into July with this video 🔥
Who came here to see if she turned herself Black?
Anyone else notice the casual BLACKFISHING!
Bom dia Azaleans 🔥
This trash just cause she white don't mean white people got to lie about it do better baby girl
I’m just here like...Why did she leave her bag in the road? :(
I don't care about the black fishing issue.  The music itself is trash
honestly everyone looks the same nowadays..so tired of this boring unclassy bratz look
First let me laugh 😭😭😭 okay  I truly wonder what black man wrote this 👀😭😭 and something about America makes WP want to be darker wonder why? 😭😭😭 and if anybody’s  the strip club it’s Ms.Cardi B so pls several couches.
🗣TRASH🗑
You're Australian be Australian
The male strippers and back up dancers whatever you wanna call them was a lil to much but thats in my opion. iggy still looked hella fine a bit burnt look

Queen shit
She did it for the girls and gays👑💅🏻
Good sound and musical turn!
I'm not gonna lie, I didn't like this song the first time. But this def a banger
The skin thing worked cuz it got me to come check out the video/song and I like it a lot
Unfortunate that at least one of her bikers is a totally leftist, anti-american.
Disgusting
She definitely didn’t blackfish tf is people talking about 😂 she look like she got a tan she looks more Latina to me in that scene but her skin tone is the same the whole video just cuz she got a black wig don’t make it blackfish lmao
Iggy you’re a WHITE Australian, why do you think you’re black. It’s actually disgusting, she’s just using the lgbtq+ community so no one talks about her getting surgery to get a darker skin tone.
Open up the clubs
Coming from the chick who said shes a slave master... Ok lmao
What a brave black woman
would ve been a hit if it were 2010
Deff black fishing. Chorus trash too lol
I've always been a fan, fuck it🤷
When you can feel your brain cells dying 😒😭
Am I the only one who support the idea that she was not blackfishing at all. Y’all just don’t understand how lighting work in videography. She is so unproblematic
What if her bag had money or her phone in it
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!!💜💜💜💜🔥🔥🔥🔥
i was so uncomfortable watching the truck part
Dope song didnt see any black facing tbh
People always gotta find something to get upset/offended by!!!! She got a tan and changed her wig! Get over it!
Rumo aos 4 milhões azaleans 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 não parem de dar stream.
Straight Men when they Realize there were no other women in that truck besides Iggy🤯🤬😏🤷‍♂️
If you ain't ready don't ask 🎶
My ears must not be working cause I don’t see what you guys are talking about, this song is trash 🗑
Iggy a dado tanto y la gente no sabe valorarla.
The song is literally shit. Two minutes and fifty seconds of ear rape. Same lyrics over and over again and people are praising her for the LGBTQ+ integration but, all she showed wer strippers. If that's not the worst interpretation of a group, I don't know what is.
Eu ameiiii
This video has more views than it should .
Meh. I can understand the blackfishing accusations. This isn't just a tan. I do think there's also filter work in post production too. Blackfishing isn't *just* darker skin. It's the body type and the blackccent too. No shade, she's gonna have fans regardless, but call it what it is. 🤷🏾‍♀️
Iggy has a *tan* and dares to dance with *black people* Idiots: *Is she R A Y C I S?!*
She is pretty talented,  this song is a banger,  don't get all the hate for her
Yikes. That was a mistake and wrong on so many levels.  Yikes again.
Club song 🎶
Gang Iggy, you serve! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I miss the old iggy music plss Back iggy 🙏😢

I love Iggy but this song is a miss
Not all D's have to be Nee Ds... :/
Even by Iggy Azalea standards this is... terrible. What in the Todrick Hall is this mess?
The fuck

Is she trying to look like cardi b?????
The strip club needs a bitcoin tip setup..

How is she doing blackface in this video? Maybe she’s a little tanner but not black
Looking real like a sista Igs.

Yo, I love me some Iggy believe that.  You the SHIT momma!
I’m loving this fantastic Iggy.😘
Hino
Que mierda es esto 🤮
This is so good
I don’t think this is black face but I do think she needs to find the right foundation for her skin tone, the rest of her body is waaaaay lighter than her face.
Hot 🔥🔥🔥🔥

🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
She’s been walking 8 years in her louboitins
I-G-G-Y  IS BACKKKKK
Sounds similar to Britney spears work bitch
Iggy just white with a tan skin there's nothing wrong with that if your a little tan it doesn't mean your black fishing
I literally don’t understand why people say she is black facing she literally just looks tan that’s it
Well the controversy did make me watch the video.
Obsesionado 🚨
Amazing GIRL
Dont get how shes blackfacing or blackfishing whatever they're calling it this week.
She just simply a white girl with a tan. People just be looking for anything to hate on. LIKE DRAKE SAY, “PEOPLE JUST NEED SOME CONTENT”
PERIODT!

Imagine if a random person just found that bag...
Anyone else watch this after listening to ABC morning news in Aus?
She filled the assignment

Good she stoped the surgery
D*** magnet lol
Good she's not hitting high notes and promoting throat surgery
I got black I got white whatchu want?
She used to be white. Anyways, I love this song and this videoclip
So this song is for the lgbtq community right?
When did she turn into a black woman?
I love how supportive she is of the LGBTQ+ community.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Black widow is a strip club? Hum okay I'm going to see the movie
Its sad youtube couldn't honor her talents previously til now when she was suppose to make the trending youtube charts 🙄
grosssssssssss
Yeaaaaaah

She really just left her bag like that though.......
Iggy love you girls

Wow. This is the blandest shit I ever heard lol. 0 flavour. Nothing there lol
Song is good, video is trash.
What in the black fishing is this LMAO
I LOV U Y BABE YOU GOT THAT !!!
its a boppppp
Nice lil reference to work video at the start. Love this tune mega catchy and I'm here for it
Relatos que Iggy esta no filme velozes furiosos 9
People need to just leave her alone. When she first came out they destroyed her career by picking on her and saying she was trying to be black or sound black. I didn’t know that black people sound a certain way🤷🏻‍♀️Not only that but how many people from England are famous and when they sing they sound pure American? Sam Smith Adele little mix and the list goes on. The only reason why people pick on Her is because she’s a white female rapper. I don’t hear or see anyone picking On actors Or actresses who Have accents but when acting or singing you can’t tell. Leave the girl alone she is not bothering anyone or saying she is black or trying to be black she is also not saying that she is the queen of rap or she invented rap she is literally living her life and just trying to have fun
❤️❤️
iconic
hittt
I love how she use the story from “work” music video from the beginning of this video, NOW THATS ICONIC ASF
This shit is firee 🤭🥰💜
Never the one to hate. But I don’t see nothing she did…I hope these ladies come a little better because this doesn’t makes me want to dance.
No offense but the tan is a little harsh. I think she's blackfishing
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Whoever says this is blackfishing clearly is dumb. She literally just tanned her skin a bit and wore a brunette wig. Meanwhile, others can wear whatever they want. Get over yo self haters. Let’s just twerk together to this new Party Anthem.
She looks like Doja Cat in this video. Girl next time skip the spray tan.
This is wrong on SO MANY levels
Yo Nicki t es ou
hot garbage
Hot Song, Hot Video...and why did she leave her bag in the middle of the road like that????
Iggy you’re the queen

First, this song has the perfect dance beat.  Yay, dance music.  Second, does the Kardashians blackfish?  ALL THE DAMN TIME.  Hassle them.  Iggy looks like she always does.  I see no evidence of black fishing. Does she put on a fake accent to rap?  well, yes, she does that but so do 90% of the rappers.  I am not saying it is right but it does happen.

Y'all need Jesus. So imma give you guys a quote!!!!  1 John 4:19 We love because he first loved us.  I love you Jesus! thank you lord!!!!! I hope i saved at least one person!
Yo, she over tanned her self. Lol.
People better get a life.. she just made her skin darker according to the video plot. If you wanna blame them blame the director of the video or producers.Singers are half actors who are controlled by the directors.She just wore what the director told her or the plot told her to wore.People better get a life and honestly create equality between black and white people.give love to all and i dont live in usa so i dont understand why racism exists in usa lol.
Work
Good for her
Vem 4M
I am the strip club! Lmfao weakest fucking chorus ever! No passion in her words, just “ I am the, the strip club”! Lmao. The beat literally carrying her to the finish line
Not going to lie, the beat is alright but the lyrics literally remind me of every radio played song that was written in 5 mins w no real depth but just a catchy saying. A 6 yr old could have written these lyrics!
This Australian girl, who was whiter than the sun in her first videos, is now darker than Obama. How does that happen naturally? 🤔
I came here bc I was curious about the black fishing. The real crime here is this awful song.
trash trying to act black and then blackwashing her skin lmao because so many Australians black nipples let alone and look like Megan the stallion
Love the beat!
walk 8 years in these louboutins 💁🏻‍♂️

#FREEBRITNEY / cool song
ok pull up black queen
So did she go back for her bag or
Not gonna lie, I'm a big fan of Iggy but this legit just feels like an ordinary remix of CALL ME MOTHER AND WTP.
What's in that bag she left on the road and why?
What abt her skin looks “black or dark” y’all don’t realize ppls skin tans, or they tan.  Nothing abt her skin looking black.   I’m mixed and can go from dark tan skin one summer and hella light skin the next.   Yall reaching, and it’s always the black community acting like ppl can’t tan within their own genes. I said what I said.  And I love the black people in here who call out the racist black community.
Why these boys are dressed up in girl's costume. It looks like whole America is turning gay.
The strippers are SERVING LEWKKKS HUNTTYYYY
I LOVE IT! Go Iggy!!
This is dope to me. Y'all just hatin let this chick live, she did her thang.
THIS IS AWESOME
ИГГИ ВПЕРЁД ДОРОГАЯ! ЛЮБИМ❤
Me encantó
and people were saying that 2021 will be better...
Wearing a black wig and getting a spray tan isn’t black face lol
Stunning
Ela é escrota e ainda faz blackface
I don’t know why but this song  reminds me of Call me mother by rupaul
I'm Searching for the part where everyone says She leaves her Bag on the Road!! 👀👜🛣️
Those who says balckfishing simply show's their insecurities...why do u people think everything revolves around you, stop playing victim card or black card everyday, ....when some other people wear dreadlocks then boom you people will be there again with culture appropriations..... Like hell you didn't even invent dreadlocks , why do you think it's yours.... dreadlocks had been in hindu religion for centuries .
Caminhão da Coca-Cola tá diferente
This shit is trash song and video
Sounds like cupcakke eat my a like a drum
Why is this acceptable in our community this is black face where’s the dislikes and flags
Perfeita
The only thing wrong with this song is that it's too short
Blackfishing??? Where??? Stop the bullshit!
“Use her mouth for more than just statements” I relate to this on a spiritual level.
House of Balmaaaaaaiiiiinnnnn 😍😍😍
Technically, that semi truck was the strip club...
Iggy is so underrated as a rapper,girl you deserve everything!!
How y’all giving people this much fame for such weak talent? 😭
She is NOT blackfishing yall are too sensitive and need to shut up
Garbage
volviste maracaaaaa 😍
Why she black fishing?
This is a hit for sure
When she’s on the back of the bike laying halfway down.... terrible angle and positioning of her for most of the video, why ????
i’m black and i can honestly say y’all stretched the truth if she wants ah tan so what black culture is fire lol i don’t blame her but it seems to me she making ball room music 🎼 good for her turn up boo
Black fishing? All of you saying that are ignorant. Anyone of any race is allowed to tan their skin and dye their hair and shake their A**. She looks bomb as always! Everything on point and super cool video and song. You go Iggy with your fine self ❤️ Jealousy is a sin and people will never stop.
❤️
Everyone is talking about her blackfishing but the first thing I noticed was how garbage this song is lol
Que mulher gata
Let's go
Wack...
She’s been walking for 8 years now!😭❤️
Além de negra agora ela é gay
Yes mammaaaaaaa 💛💛💛💛💛💛
Has a Tom zanetti vibe to it
TE AMO IGGY UWU
Ummm anyways chile
Why is this so goooood, love youu 💕💕
Everybody talking about her “black fishing” but nobody say anything about those grown MEN in the background, that’s disgusting 🤮
She’s wearing the same outfit from the song work in the beginning👀
I just love the dancers. They so badass.
I don’t know why my body’s moving.
this is blackfishing but it's so damn catchy im conflicted
I've literally seen white girls dress like this normally, to label everything racist and black fishing just shows your lack of education and trying to hurt someone's career in spite and not in righteousness
Lol girl yo bagg !!! What road dat Izz? I’ll go get it for u!!!
love you iggy iggs
https://youtu.be/SRVHZs_dndk
she looks latina ion kno what y’all mean 🤨
♥️♥️♥️
I just realized that she is wearing the same outfit and has the same bag as in her WORK music video

I AM THE STRIPCLUB OUT NOW
This is so embarrassing!
❤️❤️❤️
This video is dumb as shit.  Plus she's Blackfishing. SMH! But I guess that's the way to make money. Off of Black people. That's the American way.
Is it wrong to have tanned skin in America? Jezz I'm out. I am not offended by it tho. It's been like that since idk 2000? And she doesn't look black at all. More like tanned. Calm the f out
The Bag!!!why you leave the bag?😭😭
I love the black hair!!!
Biiiitch I love it! So your girl wanted to look more tan . Aaaaaand all these other girls do it why can’t she! Kiiiick baaaack people are too bothered too invested lmao
Isn't this the one that did that "freestyle" at a concert and it was so bad that it was memed on for years?  "Tire monk tire monk! Runaway twaaain! Finish finish hoo!".   Then another time she got called out on that radio station and she couldn't even give a simple rhyme at all.
YA’LL REACHING! 😂😂😂 Fuck outta here with that b.s.
Girl where are your blonde hair, didn't recognise you in black! Bring blonde back! <3 Song is fierce! <3
Y’all really out here trying to bring her down cuss she’s darker than usual y’all “ woke” mfs think everyone is trying to be black bro it’s foundation and it an olive tone  y are y’all trying to ruin careers go get a bag or something and stop think all white entertainers are tryin to be black go read something learn some shit bro like I don’t think iggy is trying to be us my any means again y’all just tryna be mad at someone tf    And for the blacks saying she she is trying to be black….. YALL KNOW BETTER U KNOW DAMN WELL SHE AINT TRYIN TO BE BLACK GET OVER URSRLF AND GO LOOK UP THE WORK PREJUDICE LOL
I hate the song no lie , she should come better wtf
I don’t see it as black fishing at all. People are overly stressed
GAY POWER!!! I LOVE YOU... SALUDOS DESDE VENEZUELA
Anyone whinging that she shouldn't be allowed to appear closer to a black person needs to also criticise any transgender peeps trying to appear contrary to their birth appearance. Gotta laugh at the hypocrisy of the majority sometimes...
The same video on her IG..she doesn't look as dark..not sure why the lighting is different on Youtube, looking like she's blackfishing..Liking the video & song an i'm haven't been a fan of her previously to this one ..🔥🔥🔥❤
Tbh she looks like cardi b just with more talent
Esse macacão é bem parecido com o que a Anitta usou na premiação 😍
You know damn well she doesn’t talk like how she raps 🙄
Dislikes are just jealous people
So nobody realized that she was embodying nicki & christina?
Just the best women and rapper ever
tanning is weird asf to me anyway ig it’s a thing nowadays tho & they knew what they were doing when they put them big ghetto hoop earrings in ha ears
Yup... I'm Gay.
i love it this song

Lmao this sucks
I am the strip club?! Really?  Cuz, I am confused... you don't see her dancing, shaking her posterior, nor do you see a stripper pole or her dancing on one? 🤨🤔🙄
Blackfishing? She's a stripclub? What does any of this matter when the song sucks?
This was actually trash and the video was very disturbing to look at
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍
I don’t see where the problem is with this video or here performance 📍💯
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFoFJg8dCGg
Put it in the trash.
Ugh this is ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Queen.
Yessss mamaaa! This is a ballroom must😍😍😍😍
Iggy gotta realize that people haven’t really seen her for 3 years. I’m still waiting for something good. I liked the stoplight song but most people haven’t been on Iggy for a while. The lighting is also dark so I guess I can see that. At this point a lot of us black people don’t even care. We will always be the trend. As long as I can wear other people’s looks, then it is what it is in America.
GAR BAGÉ!...
The obsession with people wanting to loook ethnic is weird to me
Me encanta :)
She straight up looks mixed... She said its the same foundation she nornally uses. She dont just look dark in the black wig also in the yellow. Im sorry but i def agree she was blackfishing. Shit is annoying. N the song isnt all that. Not bad def will be one of those songs so annoying itll become catchy and blow up
Scientists in 1000 years will say that 2021 was the year when using self tanning cream became racist
Queen 🛐❤
I don't see the issue frl and I'm black so please help me see . Why she leave her purse on the ground tho 🙄
Amo amo amo 💛🖤
IGGY WE LOVE YOU
Even without the black fishing this song is terrible 🥴
this songs garbage damn
Uhm ofc if she has black hair she’d look a little “black”  her skin color is still a little tan as it usually is, no offense a lot of the people saying that she is is white, how can a white person decide what black fishing is IF YOU ARE WHITE y’all find any reason to hate this girl, and I never understood why people don’t like her, I can clear as day see she’s Caucasian
Quarto dia aqui dando streaming no clipe, por favor não parem de reproduzir todos os dias, junto de um comentário;)
O álbum dela tá chegando aí, não podemos deixar flopar, está na hora do mundo pop dar o real valor que a Iggy merece:)
periodt
Não esqueçam de comentar bastante, lembrem-se não usem emojis.
She woke up cardi B 😂
Gente, não esqueçam de usar a música no TikTok e no Reels do Instagram também, ok?
Vamos lá gente, estamos rumo aos 4 milhões, não deixem flopar, por favor ;)
Não esqueçam de vir todo dia aqui assistir ao clipe, isso ajuda a engajar :)
Since when having a black hair is black fishing?
Nobody really cares about them negative comments she making that bag for her and her son❤️ she’s a hot momma🔥 and she good regardless!
Why’s she tryna be black hahahahhaahahaaahahaaha
That bag is worth 24,000 dollars, wtf omg
Nice🔫🔫
Cause of these dudes not a nice video but definitely no blackfishing. What’s wrong with people
She don’t even look black can y’all stfu
The dancers are siiiiiick 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Haters! She looks great you guys like to pick on anything! Leave her alone!
QUEEN
I’ve never been an Iggy fan but I’m here to support her cause ppl trying to hate over something so dumb.
Second part of kream🤭🤭😍😍❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
*gets a bad grade in school* 2 mins later Me:
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Video trash..she look good tho n that blk wig tho
This song is trash too  🗑️🗑️🤦🏽‍♀️
She obviously got tan . I don’t think this was black fishing cause shew wouldn’t be that stupid . It was obviously the tan and the wig was dark and we aren’t use to seeing her in black hair. Everyone needs to relax this was a great video and song
This is good
i just came across this video and now my  ass is just shaking on its own
this is such a serve,, i can see slayyyter doin a remix to this but sadly that will never happen
Took me a second but shes wearing the same outfit from her first video "work" bag nd all,, i think thats why she left the bag on the ground some kinda "leaving the past behind" type ting
I love Iggy but the song kind of sucks 😃
Don’t take this video down . I don’t see where the black fishing is at.
Not me spending the whole summer on the road trying to find that bag🕵🏻‍♀️
I came to this video ready to be mad because of the allegations and i’m dancing 😵‍💫😂
Y’all fucking tripping.  Focus on intention, this is not harmful.  You can’t cancel everyone.
This is the most disappointing music video I've seen in years. What a waste.
Sounds like her live performances tire mark tire marks lmfao she garbage. Stupid try hard
💕😈😍🏳️‍🌈
she doesn’t look like me in this… you guys will say anyone with a tan is blackfishing….
What does she mean with *the end of an era?* ???????? 👀
I swear some of the white people want to be black for no reason and I just don’t know why like be yourself love yourself stop trying to be black and you’re not 💯🤦🏽‍♀️
I came here for the "Black Fishing" Issue I read on the news now I'm vibing the music. Hahahahaha 😂😂 This is catchy rap song tbh. I'm impressed I would love to add this on my playlist!
Nice
Garbage.
💙💙💙💙💙
Just wow 🤩
#iamthestripclub
You are a poser !!!!! I'm so sick of seeing this you are Australian you don't sound like this keep pretending eventually everyone will see your just as bad as kid Leroy make your own sound stop stealing !!!
I feel like using a truck and creating a ballad inside it.
This entrance was spectacular.
Iggy is so beautiful and powerful in this clip, I feel her energy with the music and I'm impressed.
Bop fire Girl 🔥❤️💅
I'm obsessed with this song. Iggy, thank you for launching this smash, my waist thanks you!
I'm not going to lie, this is the best song released this year.
This song is too good to dance.
O mundo te ama e te apoia, Iggy. 🌍

Isso que é música
Maravilha diva

how she black fishing u black people alresdy get bullied
Catchy gay club beat
She even included a bunch of hot dudes😍🔥
Uggghhhh
Shit trash 🗑😂😂
The way she looks back at the police car. I guess it wasn't supposed to be there 😂
I mean yall are too damn sensitive. Its a foundation lmfao
I don't even want to say the word because it's so stupid. internet people need to get a life
Just came to give you a view. Even put it on mute.   I hate stupid controversy. A club is dark. Everyone looks dark on the club and anyone who has been inside of a club knows it.
The beginning is literally the same thing as karma police by Radiohead's music video
It’s hilarious that in the black wig scene where, if anything she looks Hispanic/Brazilian is considered black fishing.
Trash
sick! love it ! go girrrrrrrrrrrrl!
Love thiiis
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm a black girl and this debate about blackfishing is just stupid. All those  female rappers  look alike . What about Cardi B with her nose job, Nikki, lil Kim skin. Come on let people do what they want. This is just entertainment.
Plastic body, plastic music🤮🤮
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I beg you get cardi to drop a verse on this 🔥🔥🔥
Guuuuurl, Jamari from House of Balmain?!!??! *___* I am dying for this MV.
OMG, same clothes from Work!!!!!
Blackfishing...
If y’all don’t realise this is the same out fit she wore on WORK song the crop top. Except now she got her bag 💼 💵💸 N she leaves it on the road . Now she a whole body banging Strip club💵💵   Makes sense why she left the bag on the road. She did done all the sacrifices to get where she at but people don’t appreciate her talent! She is dearly UNDER-RATED. Cut the bull shit out with her black Fishing‼️
The men dressing in women’s clothes ruined the video
Utter shit and inappropriate .
Iggy should collaborate with those guys who sang I want to be your slave
I guess you worked on your shit ?
Ironically this makes me think of azealia banks...song should do well in the clubs though. Iggy looking like a whole latina 👀
I disliked bc of the blackfishing but then realized there were gays in the back so I took it off
Que asco de video🤮
Best song 2021
Africans are not the only dark skin people in the world... stop accusing her of something. She looks amazing and that is bothering you.

I'm sorry but you all are okay with ariana grande having darker skin but iggy does it and you have a seizure? grow up.
She's never even been a dancer
🔥¡This is fire!🔥
Only commenting to support Iggy. Not a big fan of the song
This keeps going up on the trending page   yasss iggy
Black fishing?  Why the hell is everything about race nowadays I thought this was a great vid, and it's not the 90s anymore people can identify as whatever they damn well please!!!
I’m here watching this video like, WHY SHE LEFT HER BAG ON THE ROAD?!!! 😂😂
If I walked into a strip club and seen guts dressed like women I would walk right back out. I have nothing against gay people but I'm a man and I like women's bodies. Definately not men bodies!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This needs to be a hit
Love this video an song it’s 🔥🔥
Gayyyyy🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
I love it
wow she went to far making her skin that dark. she’s naturally pale. sorry iggy you’ll never be black :)
Blackfishing where ? I do not see it at all
What it works out to be, is some like to solve problems and some like to cause them. Trust me I am the last person to ever justify someone in the media. But boycotting Oscar's for not having enough colour and then doing the same for too much? If you're gonna give her shit then why not coco Chanel's? After all she's the one who brought tanning into fashion and anyone intelligent enough to understand how acceptance essentially comes from trends, you'll understand how monumental that was. I mean if you care that much why not move to south Africa and actually bitch where it's a legitimate problem, not feel high and mighty on youtube and tumblr.
Black-fishing? NO!! she is doing the Kardashian look! Except Kim K wouldn't have left her designer bag on the road!
AINT NOBODY JERKING OFF TO THIS...DOSNT THIS GIRL KNOW MOST OF HER VIEWS COME FROM GUYS CHECKING HER OUT....BUT WHEN U GOT GAY GUYS IN THONGS....  WTF   IM OUT    DISLIKE
She tan Af
She’s darker now  ???
@pepeyteo
The way people jump on any excuse to hate on this girl… the level of reaching in these comments is absurd and disturbing.
I AM THE STRIPCLUB
Iggy 💛
Songs catchy but is the gay porn necessary?
TE AMO IGGY ❤️❤️❤️

7 billion voices and yours is my favorite voice
LOVE HERRRRR!!!!
Iggy: 👩🏾
TRASHHHHH
Damn ur in love with Azealia Banks

I don't see black fishing... She not even in the dark wig but one small scene the majority she is in a blond one wtf everyone talking about
This needs to be blasted in the gay barsss

Está canción me hizo perrear hasta el suelo❤️

Ayyyyyyyyy
we have to keep streaming  it's one of her best this is the time Iggy deserves so much more
Why she look black now lol
Iggy Azalea te amoooooooo
People who are watching the clip because of the "blackfishing" controversy, know that it's all gone from an attempt to ruin iggy's single release and damage Iggy's image in relation to the clip. Iggy has been wearing that same makeup for 3 years, including the clips of "Sally Walker", "Started", "Lola" and "Dance Like Nobody's Watching", she wears this same makeup that makes her skin more tanned, giving the summer feel to the songs.
Not understanding all the hype... Wasn't feeling song or video.
It's like shes doing the micheal jackson thing, but backwards lol
It’s trash 👎
Linda
Te amamos nena

First, you can’t rap AT ALL, second you will never look or be a black or brown woman. This is getting out of hand. White woman need to stop black/brown fishing.
Don't want your love

Swaggy P, how did you mess that up bro?  Iggy would of been plenty for me not to cheat!
We can clearly sew what T.I. was talking about.

What the hell is that an artist of this level and amount of talent has a gut to throw dirt at Eminem’s name come on
Amoooo
Iggy 🌹

LOVED THE "WORK" REFERENCE AT THE BEGINNING 🔥🔥

Her Azealia Banks era✨
I LOVE YOU, THANK YOU FOR THIS QUEEN MUSIC ANTHEM ❤️🔥

I co-produced this, i'm proud :)
Pobbing
Iggy azalea with the black hair hits so different
Oh yes
❤️
Blackfishing yas say? 😂😂😂😂 Kardashianfishing would be more accurate if you want to use appearances as a platform.  Mofo’s gotta stop being so sensitive! Fact is white girl is doing it better than most and y’all jst can’t handle dat yo 😬😆
So no one is gonna mention the obvious black fishing??
❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏
Love it go iggy
What a load of shite.  Great music is like candy, the first thing you do is get rid of the wrapper
She’s wayyyyy to dark in this
I'm not gonna bitch about the blackfishing. I'm gonna praise her for putting femme blacks in the spotlight.
Yaaaasss, House of Balmain slaying in this vid! 💅🏼
Iggy messed her face up :/ she was fine as fuck before the plastic surgery.
Do you know the Now United group? If you don't know, I recommend listening to all their songs, they are very good. It has an American representative in it

The same outfit from the work video! I see the connection
I already know she’s about to get called out for blackfishing. I straight up thought that was a black woman in the thumbnail and when it cut to the scene of her in the truck with the black wig on....
This 'thing' pretending to be a woman is REVOLTING and DISGUSTING! 💩💩💩👹👹👹
Shawty got hella haters!! Everything ain’t cultural appropriation and what’s this blackphishing .. stop worrying abt other folks and stop wearing hair bonnets and pajamas .. get ya body right!! What is blonde hair and designer bags??? Stop being hippocrits!!! Live and let live!!!
Fugly dancers just Iggy next time
oh, this is a damn banger
White woman portraying  to be black.in videos  using gay men for approval  sick asf
Good song I think .lol .Only came here because the “BLACK FISHING THING”.She does look brown some bit in this video .Theres nothing wrong with being Pale White with a big ass .
Can we just clone Iggy? She brings peace to the world 🌎 she knows how to be human.
I am The The Stripclub  Please update video title.
Reina independiente
Love is QUEEN❤
Very 90s, 2000s and house
Complete garbage.
amei a referência de “work” no começo 🥰❣️
As fan early in her career. One verse over and over again doesn't make you cool. Eminem is more relevant at his age than you flaunting like Cardi B.
She really went to 💁🏼‍♀️💁🏾‍♀️
I don't think she looks black like many are saying that she's black fishing when she's in the truck/strip club. Ppl just have nothing better to do but talk out their ass. Keep doing you Iggy fuck those fools!
Bart Baker predicted the future with this tan
The video is lame as hell just a bunch of confused people doing stupid dance moves and shit
Channeling Cardi B and Nicki M. Tf going on 🧐
Delete this
Okay this song sucks ass.  Terrible.  Hate it!  only here long enough to thumbs down and comment.
Goes from 900k a day to 20k today? YouTube wtf

Song is good but the video is not what I wanna see
Y’all listen to music like this? 😐
Iggy & Azalea banks have the same flow 🥴 rhythm & corkiness about them! They should collaborate & make one big annoying song everyone can "vogue" to hunni 🙄🤣
snow roach changed race
This is the gayest rap video I've ever seen in my entire life
People like this?
These lyrics are so deep and meaningful
Her skin colour is reversed Michael Jackson lmao
INCREDIBLE

🔥giving credit where credit is due, this song is IT💃💃👏💯
Track is fire 🔥
You not too old for this smut anymore?
So why are there only black people in her videos???what she trying to say????
The end of the video says “The end of an era” …An end of what era though?!?!? I hope this does not mean she is going to stop making 🔥 thot videos . 🤷🏻 lol
she blocked me on Instagram😥🤦
I’m here for @Smashstunts! I love her!
I can't wait for End Of An Era to drop!
this is so SUS lol
Whoever wrote these rhymes did a pretty good job.
I first seem the video I thought it was Kim Kardashian because that what Iggy look like .she looks so pretty with dark hair.
Haven’t felt hype since the first album, sorry Igz! 😫
Catchy song
Iggy where did you recorded the video?? I want to see if the bag is still there 🤭
Garbage .... BUT!!!  July is White History month ..Enjoy
Judo is grappling/throws, not kicking. sheesh

She wanna be African American soooo bad maaaan
Her taste for fashion 😍🔥
Where can I find that biker set? I want one
This isn't blackfishing it's just a hot chick on a trash song
This song has early 2000s/ Basement Jaxx vibes 🙌🙌🙌
Iggy did that again 🥵🔥👍🏻👍🏻
Such a boppp🔥🔥🔥🔥
Summer 2021 song!!! Time to blast this while driving to the beach with a margarita ❤️🤟🏻
Came here cos she’s apparently ‘black fishing’ but all I see is a woman fucking killing it and people creating problems 🧐🧐

Guuuuuuuurl
I love it is the continuation of work 💪
GARBAGE 🗑
It’s funny how some people think this black fishing this ain’t it
Why are all of the men black? She's white. Why didn't she put white men in her video? This is sick.
I don't like her music, but the black backlash is weird. Just stfu, black people are the most free citizens ever, get yourself a baby zoomer
ИКОНА РУССКОГО ШОУБИЗНЕСА АХАХАХ😭😭😭🤲🤲🤲💖💖💖💖💖

If she is black fishing.  Every girl that wears fake hair is white fishing tf
God
Slay queen👌🏻
Pitiful
Yasss queen!!!
Song is wack with a few good IG quotes but I think it's it's dark wig. We not used to it and the makeup is consistent in the other shots. The 1B wig is what makes her look darker and the lighting added to it.
This country is going to hell!!
WTF i was hoping to see fine bitches not 1 in this video
Get a ride and forgot your bag
What means blackfishing? 😅introduced me
She need @ninaunrrated in this video!!! Cause she is the Strip Club
Visials on point
Uffff . Mis oídos agradecen poder escuchar esta increíble canción 💕✨🤟🏻🙌🏼

The nostalgia from ‘work’ why do I feel like this was the follow up from ‘work’ haha after it ended ? 😂
Gays
3 M~I Am The StripClup👑
I just came to see the Blackfishing. I guess it's not enough to approbiate black voices, she has to steal the look too! 😂
Baby you forgot your bag on the roaddddd
go go go
Nope
Keep going u guys she’s killin it
Love this girl ❤️
I almost threw up with the gay strippers 🤢
Did she pay for this video? So poor.
What happened to YouTube? I saw this video had 3.01 M views 4hours ago, and now it says 3.00M???
I became a fan when she was only 16 in the middle of miami. Now she's 30 with a kid and I'm still an azalean.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
PERIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD 3 MILLIONS
I don't see the "black fishing" everyone's talking about.. she's the same shade..she just wearing a wig..and it's not even though the whole video..you guys need to leave her alone and quit hating..
grotesque
WOOOOOOO!
She has CTE
Horrible song…. This is music?? Laughable (shakes head in disbelief) Hahahahaa
Black fishiiiiiingggggggg

End of a white era?
Maybe she's not a one hit wonder but this song ain't it.
3M and counting let's go!!! The song is a VIBE 💯
Reminds me off realness and Rupaul runaway music
I love Iggy
Sad
😍😍😍😍
Hold my bag
so I guess all the hate is on the bag that were left at the start? or is it Leftist Smugglypuffers who hate this? those with 173621 genders, shampoobottled-shaped body, blue hair, 7271477 lbs, hates men and women who are sexy and hot? yes, ofc its them 😂😂🤣😭
this is the song of the summer
iggy is just perfect
@robynstunts @smashstunts ... Killed it as usual
Look at all the dummies in the comment section believing she’s an independent artist 🤓 This film clip was whack AF !! And just as bad as dax and his white facing. She wants to look like an African American and sound like an African American.. well as an Australian myself I can tell you.. You can fckn have her. #Blackfish
I want the 5 million on my table for time, and play the legend streaming ❤️
The truth is that Iggy is the only well known female rapper who isnt trying to imitate or copy Nicki Minaj or Lil Kim. She is original and has always new ideas for visuals and songs. She deserves so much more credit. At least her attitude isnt trash and she is actually humble and just a casual nice girl.
um. someone check her makeup artist cuz… hun… sm went wrong fo sho
so ? this doesnt have to be an issue. if she looks beautiful in black hair let her be! shes an artist she can dress as anyone. Lady Gaga wouldnt have an issue if she’d have the spotlight on this.
This is iconic
WHY IS SHE ACCUSED OF BLACKFISHING?PPL ACT LIKE PPL CANT GET A TAN AND IT BE JUST THAT TF
YOUTUBE STOP DELETING VIEWS CHALLENGE
HATERS took me here :) thank them later
sounds like intro of Love Island hahah
🧜🏼‍♀️🧜🏼‍♀️🧜🏼‍♀️👸🏼
she really woke up and said gay rights
I'd have more respect if she stopped pretting she wasn't white.
😍😍😍
🔥🔥🔥
I'm powder white so she looks Latina to me lol. But seriously we should give black people a payout. This white girl from Australia singing hip hop, making all that money doesn't seem right without properly paying the original creators.
our dark skin queen 😩😻🤤😍😉☺️🥺
You are the the sellout!
Vem 3 milhões!!! 🗣🗣🗣🛐🔥
Besides her bag that was left... this HIITTSSS!

Yes!
She’s HUGE OMG, the worst nasty 🤮 video ever.
this is why carti left iggy
Fabulous!  and the dancers, OMFG!  This is on repeat!
Click bait.  I wanted to see Iggy shaking that booty and not a bunch of men shaking theirs.
So we're not going to talk about the clear use of black face in this video I mean this song is trash obviously going to talk about the black face I don't care what it is it can be some kind of tribute I don't care the point is it's still black face
I didn't see any "Blackfishing". People just want a reason to hate.
why is the drug YouTube deleting the views?
Youtube deleting views stoppppp
youtube stop deleting views
Hhmm… looks American to me. No African appropriation. You go Iggy! 🤘

I rarely comment but for Iggy i´ll do anything. Independent Iggy is that BITCH
So her accent is fake and her skin tone...
Nicki hop on it❤❤❤❤
Is this a joke? Like meme rap or are real life people suppose to take this serious? No hate. Just curious.
Love this!
I mean she does look darker than she did. But not "blackfishing" dark.
What a load of crap, can't understand half the words she says. If this came on the radio I'd switch it off.
Im so tired of her barely showing herself on her videos. The same happened with Sally Walker. We want to see the looks, you look good ASF. I wished i saw more of the black wig outfit
Twerking intensifies
yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Midem bulandı
🔥🔥
Was turned on and off at the same time..
Iconic
Y’all stretching just Bc she wearing a black wig and dark eyeshadow she literally stayed the same color the whole time
Go 3M

She sounds like saweetie and megan mixed iggy i like the song tho

Eve called, she wants her video back. No originality anywhere to be seen here or heard here.
when you don’t know who you are anymore..  just remember: you are the, the strip club   😌
I love Iggy, but why does she look like Eve in „let me blow ya mind“ in that Squad part? I was confused first.. 😅
Is that a bunch of dudes in the back of the 18 wheeler? Someone please clarify it
Iggy's Dance Vibes 🥰
SO WE NEED A TV PERFORMANCE NOW. IGGZ

"i am the the strip club" - iggy azalea, 2021
yawn
White Chicks have entered the video in a gay bar
The blackfishing is getting out of hand
I'm still pissed Jon Snow wasn't king in Game of thrones
wait..... was that rachel dolezal?
That was a looong walk since 2013 ...
Amazing song 🤓🤓🤓🤓
Lol at people talking about color grading. That's a new one!
Straight male speaking.. dis shit smackin Iggy 😏💪🏾
The new summer anthem ♥️
Damn we love our biracial queen 👑  #iggyforever
Definitely a Bop🙌🔥
People who say she is blackfishing by just watching a screenshot on IG or Twitter clearly didn't see the whole mv
Just need all of your dollarsss YAAASSS!!!
I am the strip club is that girl
Please continue streaming and not only the mv, on music platforms as well!
The baddest period
Yessssss queen iggy slay!!!
*They be saying Iggy trying act black*
Tell me how the fuck a fucking WIG can change your colour skin????  You need therapy, stupid haters. Thank u for the views tho.
Is she trying to make racism catchy or something?
I'm more gay than yesterday  I am the *#STRIPCLUB*
I just can’t get over that she left her bag on the road
Song of 2021 🤩🤩🤩🤩 #bop
Gotta support a gemini sister❤
She doesn't know this but she makes everyone's day better
I am unimpressed.
The song is as good as the tracks to Marcus the horse but the video is trash tho...
I'm obsessed
This is why the terrorists hate us
Better flow than cardio
2.8 million views was just me
The End Of An Era..........Bitch I'm so excited ♥
Idk why but this gives me M.I.A vibes
What happened to that Bangbros offer ?
Byeeeeeeee purse!
This song is Horrible, Shes a horrible Artist overall.  The truclk is symbolism for how they transport kidnapped people   She is also changing her persona with the darker Hair then Going Back to the Blonde in the video  a play on the Lightness and Darkness she is representing   i didnt even get in depth lol
Christ, this is fucking awful. 😷
Adooorooo que hit
You guys need help  I love iggy but this song is a trash  The lyrices and beat and music its all trash +_+
Alguien me puede decir por que la gente dice que iggy es odiada en USA?:(
😍😍😍
This is what everyone is mad about?
What a shit song
Is she purposely channeling Kim K? Kim wore the exact same outfit. Or is just a coincidence? She looks amazing regardless.
Girllllll you desereeeeed an icon this song is soooo good ✨
https://youtu.be/hpLaT1jnHUM
OH HELL NOOOOOO!!!! WHERE THE FEMALES AT??? I FEEL LIKE I'M WATCHING A LIL NAS X MUSIC VIDEO. No straight man wants to see another man shaking his ass and spreading his legs.😣😖 Maybe they should put this music video in the gay column for gay only people because I prefer to see females shaking their ass, probably because I'm STRAIGHT!!!😩👎
Damn gurl 🔥
EWWWWWW
I WANNA BE DRUNK AND HIGH AF DANCING THIS ALL DAY
All you people think this song is lit lmao just wait until you get older just remember every 1 thought vanilla ice was lit haha
😍😍😍Iggy👌
Queen
This video is genius and this song is dope
Omg I strolled passed one of pics from this video on Twitter and I thought iggy was cardi b 😳😳😳😳
Queen for sure. The song is fire😍🔥
People that accuse her of appropriating black culture and black fishing are racist.   What if white people decided to say, black people are appropriating white culture when attempting to create movies? The first thing out of a black persons mouth would be that is racist. So the same should be said about people accusing Iggy of appropriation and black fishing. You guys are racist
The fact that people she’s around during the making of this is encouraging her saying yes yes yes when they should’ve just said no yo look like your black fishing but now I know we had this music video where it looks like she’s black she’s clearly white
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
B O P
I'm feeling more gay than ever ;*
YAAAAAAS IGGYYYYYY
woot
👏👏♥️🇧🇷🇧🇷
Wen a wen wenna wen a wen
What a try_ hard iggy still trying to sound black and now trying to look black and lyrics are so shit how embarrassing
She is back 🐾❤️
This song is trash.
I don’t see any black fishing it just looks like she got a summer tan and matched it as much as possible but due to lighting and people not use to that shade people are claiming it as black fishing which is messed up
Amazing
Iggy's new look makes her look like a drag queen. Tell me I'm wrong...
Video set smelled like ass and latex
what a crap!
i love heeer
Vulture lmfao
ES QUE YO TE AMO IGGY, GRANDIOSA CANCIÓN Y VIDEO!!! 😻😻

The beat is sick. No cap.
Iggy- thank you for supporting Britney. You defo made some new fans!!! Plus don't forget Britney was hated af by media n ppl. Just like Iggy- now she is a living legend. Just wait Iggy.
Yo, all I am saying isn't the point to secure the bag? So why leave the bag in the first 20 secs of the song? My only complaint. I loved the women on the bikes.
Watch Cyn sanata's "COME" vid that 1 won't disappoint

This is soooo hard I can't even explain These type of beats suit you Iggy frfr!!! You the best!! and you the sexiest 💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
She went independent so I don’t expect her like to become hit like other artists.
So when are we going to discuss how white skinned people tan to profit off of blackness yet black celebrities and black women in general face discrimination, jealousy, hair oppression, And hatred for their bodies and skin tone. I won't even be surprised when the celebrities start rocking curly hair and afros this is a legitimate issue. You guys profit off of our skin and culture yet somehow don't even give us recognition or stand up for racial discrimination so what is this !!??? You can wash your tan and remove the plastic and injections from your body but at the end of the day I can't remove mine and I'm sick of seeing people profit off of our features when everyday black women and men fear for their lives because they were BORN like that. So how come you get to profit off of how we look but we risk dieing  over petty things like our skin and race? We are in poverty because of how we were born and LOOK. We can't get decent jobs because of our HAIR and skin and you can just wear it and take it off at any time you please. I'm sick of it. Why are we supporting celebrities who do this ! This is just crazy to me how we legitimately live in a society that hates us but profit off of us and these celebrities profit from it, don't support it, and stay silent while we are suffering? You profit off of overly sexualizing BLACK SKIN and features. I'm tired of seeing it. Discuss this issue. If you want to resemble Kim and Kim wants to resemble black women then why do you guys not use their voices to fight for us ?? Don't even do the bare minimum for our community and our culture but profit from it.
A boooop
Rainhaaaa 🤩✨✨✨
Adorei 🥰

The decline of western women's morality continues.  "I am the strip club" and "WAP"  pouring out of their mouths right behind the words "don't objectify me!!"  Sad.

Y'all doing too much at this point. Can't y'all see that she's not blackfishing but it's just the weird light? She's been white throughout the whole video, so sit down.
Iggy é muito talentosa!!!!
Yeah
Yay!!!
Support!!
IGGY
Love it 😍
Iggy looks so cute in black hair
People obviously don't understand lighting and color grading. These are some of the important factors that set the vibe in a video. It would be a completely different story if she was walking around in real life trying to darken her skin and try to be black just to profit from it. I'm not sure who out there trying to sabotage her, but I hope people realize that she's not blackfishing.
Am i the only one who late realised what's up in this video and then 🤢
On repeat
Queen 😍🥵
Te amo Iggy ❤️ Cada día te superas más 🥰
You go Gurlllll💕❤🙏

I love her but this skin color she’s wearing for the time being is a no no.

In order to succeed in music or movies you have to show support for gays, but this song will not be popular because it literally has disgusting forms

This is a dumb ass song!!!!!
Art
IGGY AZALEA
I'm so sick of people saying this and that about color, race etc. When in all reality we all bleed the same color. It's art and she can express however she wants. When your bashing her saying she's black facing you are the one being racist. Move to another country where they don't have freedom to express themselves. We are in America the land of the free and the home of the brave. Iggy Azalea you keep popping girl, like you know how.
Queen
Iggy did that 😍
Go iggy love this one
1:15 B!tch, you bought those things and they’re far from perfect 😂🤣 Humble yourself.
Is this the same road SOA was filmed on? Like the ending scene with Jax Teller’s death?
Song and video are TERRIBLE 🤮 she's really gone downhill.
I am not understanding why there are all men in this video
YASSSSSSS IGGY! Bad bitch 🔥🍑🖤

“Kick it like Judo” has to be one of the most overused and incorrect lines in hip-hop history.
Just in case anyone needs to hear this again - IGGY IS INDEPENDENT, this girl has a hand in everything she does, and her talent shows through all of it. LOVE IGGY!

This song of course isn't meant to put you in a deep space to think about your life, it's for you to have fun. Stop acting like there's no difference or intention.
Americans are so obsessed with skin color
This is nowhere near to blackfishing.
Song of the summer incoming
Iggy es odiada en USA, pero en el resto del mundo es admirada, creo local la madre del Rap
😴 🛌 💤
I looked down then back up for a sec and I thought she was Nicki Minaj in that black wig for a sec
Wait, is that Cardi B? Where is Iggy?
OMG THAT’S MY NEW FAVORITE SONG
its so funy!

DIOSAAAAA
Sadly most people have no clue about grading videos. There is no one colour, you adjust the levels to the values you want. Same goes for printing pictures. There is no true colour apart form pantone for print. but you are always going to have to choose colour range values from video. it may be darker or lighter, whichever suits the brief best. There is no true representation of colour. try taking a picture throughout the day from dusk till dawn. the colours will change even from global illumination and ambient occlusion. People just are very clueless about these everyday industry matters. why do you think lighting is so important in film? it sets the mood. Without it everything looks awful and you can't get the right shutters speeds etc....if you don't know you don't know, don't jump on hate bandwagons!

This music is WACK I'm just here to support the idea that all press is good press, Saw an article hating on this video so I decided to give it a view. Zero fucking talent omg wow
Pocah tá diferente
The gay clubs are MISSING OUT! I am READY to hear the bass in the club. Ugh, damn COVID
It doesn't matter how her skin looks....the world has always been full of bigots who think they have the right to tell a woman what she can do and how she can look.
Iggy is so underrated
And now she’s Black? Um, no.
wtf Iggy baited me
An Australian doing black face?! Not great....
It's so disrespectful the fact that this song hasn't got 100M views yet

So many people in the comments can't differentiate actual blackface and tanned anymore. 🤦🏻‍♀️ And ironically most of them are white people. Ever heard of bronzer/contourer? How about low light video? Color grading???? 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️

I don't care what they say about her--I've always liked Iggy. She looks great and I LOVE this video. Not too crazy about this song, but....
let me blow ya mind vibes
YOOOO THIS SHIT ACTUALLY SLAPS
such a sad state of affairs that music like this is being created and fed to the youth. This is not reality. The reality is that most girls who work in strip clubs have major emotional damage and numerous addictions. Can the money be great? yes indeed. but ask any girl that works there if they are happy and they are not. maybe happy with what the money allows them but they have sold their souls and become nothing but a cute shell of a human. God intends so much more than the be objectified and lusted over. There is freedom in Christ for those who are seeking true happiness.

Deserves number 1 on BBH100 ... Thanks Iggy for putting our summer on fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I came here to see what she did that was cultural appropriation. I sure as hell hope that wigs and nails haven't become black culture because that's sad... THANK YOU IGGY FOR QUEER BLACK REPRESENTATION. THANK YOU FOR LOVING OUR QUEER BLACK MEN MORE THAN WE DO. They deserve the love and respect they get in this video... So again ... THANK YOU IGGY!!
Wowwwww just wowwwwwwwwwwwwwww 🎊🎊🎊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
😍😍😍
this song is literally 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fun song but yeah her skin appears darker. Over the years she's been getting darker. What does this mean..only she knows Go back to watch "work" for reference.. completely different.
*The following is happening in our World and no one is noticing.*  1. Armageddon is about 4 action events.    1st horse, Bow = *Send* it.    2nd horse, Sword = *Strike* it.    3rd horse, Scales = *Split* it.    4th horse, Fire = *Sear* it.     That ='s Our planet for the last 2 years have averaged 3.23 Rockets a day into space.    That's hundreds of rockets we've *Send*/sent up.    We've sent close to a 1000 Rockets/with Elon saying he's sending another 1000.    They are *weapons* designed to stop "Wormwood" in the book of Revelation in the Bible.    All Telescopes on this planet are pointing in the same direction.    Elon is building underground tunnels in major cities.    "Wormwood" is going to hit the PACIFIC OCEAN. *EVACUATE*.    All the ELITE TOP COMPANIES ARE EVACUATING THE PACIFIC COASTS...SO SHOULD YOU!!!  2. "The mark of the beast".       Take 3 6's and place them in a circle and you have a virus warning symbol.     But the Mark is the VACCINE. And because it is a global problem it will demand a global solution.     *The Vaccine will be given Airborne and it will land on your forehead and hands.*     It will try to alter Chromosome 7 lamb1.     It is during these moments where the Bible mentions: *You will wish the mountains to fall on you.*     And this is also the moment where the Bible mentions: The "few" and the "many".     "Few" will die from this Vaccine (millions) and "many" will live (billions).     This vaccine will cure all diseases BUT it will not remove the Pain from any injuries you receive.     That is the moment of the "delusion" mentioned in Revelations.      If you get a cut or any injury, the pain will never go away, they just keep building up.     You will wish the "mountains to fall on you".     666 (six - sick - sicknesses) <->  *Six species of human corona viruses are known* ,      with some species subdivided into two different strains,          making seven strains of human corona viruses altogether.      Rev. 13:16 is referring to those who DIDN'T make the rapture of the church (The not "born again" PEOPLE).    1st Horseman is the Bow (SEND it). < That Horse rides as we speak. All the Rockets this Planet SENDS into Space are Weapons of mass Destruction targeted at "Wormwood". For almost 2 years now our Planet as sent almost 1000 Rockets into space and now we are averaging 3.23 a day. Elon just boasted within the past month how he intends to send a 1000 more.   BEFORE those ROCKETS touch "WORMWOOD", 2 EVENTS will happen. 1 Event will be the "RAPTURE" and 1 will be the "AIRBORNE VACCINE". < BOTH OF THESE EVENTS HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME.  < The "AIRBORNE VACCINE" is the reason it happens.  I have to stop here and explain something. Our Souls are physically attached to Our flesh by Chromosome 7 lamb1. When a Person (truly) becomes "BORN AGAIN" Chromosome 7 lamb1 CHANGES. So now you have 2 different groups of People on the Planet. Those who are "born again" w/the altered "lamb1" and those who don't.  Now having said that. When the "AIRBORNE VACCINE" lands on your forehead and hands, it's going to try and alter Chromosome 7 lamb1 AGAIN. When it does, ONLY those who are "BORN AGAIN" will die. Those who don't have the altered "lamb1" will LIVE...and be able to buy and sell during the TIME OF THE ANTICHRIST. The "BORN AGAIN" People are people who have God's Holy Spirit INSIDE THEIR SOULS.  *God's Holy Spirit* isn't on this planet during the 7 years of the antichrist. His Spirit is raptured from this planet BEFORE THE 2ND HORSEMEN RIDES!!!!! (I'm throwing pearls, you better be getting this). <<<<and all of that can't happen till the "LAST SUPPER" (see my "Last Supper" video on my channel) is over.  Then the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Horsemen happen.  So once again. The "mark of the beast" is NOT A CHIP.  ITS THE COMING "AIRBORNE VACCINE". You must be "born again" before the "airborne" vaccine is given or you will be here for the 7 years of the antichrist.   3. The scorpions mentioned in Revelation 9:10.      There are satellites in space called HIVES.    Inside each of them are tiny rockets called BEES.    They are designed to Target all CELL PHONES.    CELL PHONES ARE HOMING DEVICES.    Buy cell phone Jammers now and be ready to save those around you when it happens.     Throw your phone and run if you feel in danger. Don't stand in the same spot.    Be prepared. Buy short wave walkies-talkies. They can have up to 5 mile capabilities.     They will be mercy killings by our governments because of the actions above with their missiles (for 5 Months after the asteroid hits).    They were just tested against that RV that blew up Tennessee. The reason the word "scorpions" was used?  What the person saw was a vision and then it ended up in Revelation. The "vision" He saw was long cylinder puffy clouds streaming from the skies, lots of them and at the end of each of those was a tiny little missile, but to the person having the vision, to him it looked like a bunch of scorpion tails or should I say cloud TRAILS.  Please I'm begging you to listen to what I've said. These events are happening right now. There's a *GRAVITATIONAL PULL HAPPENING.* ( *Wormwood (rock heading this way in space) of the book of Revelation* in the Bible ) Floods in the desserts of Saudi Arabia. Blizzards in Spain. Huge clouds, heavy rains and flash floods in Saudi deserts, Qunfudhah, Taif Mass fires in Brazil. Hot Spot - Ocean, & Scanning Yellowstone Super Volcano. 1/21/2021 Mass electrical storms in Turkey. Hot Spots & Scanning Yellowstone Super Volcano.. 1/17/2021 Neva River freezes, Saint Petersburg, Russia Volcanoes are activating around the Globe. Sewage fountains out of drains during floods in Cochabamba, Bolivia And more...! Luke 21:11  There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences. And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven.  I don't post links no more because YouTube removes them. This is so important that you help  me tell others. I didn't make anything up. If you get a moment come see what else I've discovered on my channel. But I beg you with all of my heart and soul to at least tell someone what you've read. Please at least do that. Nothing on my channel is monetized.  Folks, we are SENDing rockets into space to STRIKE a rock that the book of Revelation in the Bible calls "wormwood" and when those rockets SPLIT a piece will hit right above INDONESIA in the Pacific Waters and it will rock up and down the FIRE RING of the PACIFIC sending LAVA TO THE SKIES which will *SEAR* 2/3rds of this PLANET.  *I'M BEGGING YOU, HELP ME WARN OTHERS!*   You're thinking how can you believe me? I'm the guy who God showed where His Garden of Eden was ( *I can backup those words* if you come to my channel). *SOON A GLOBAL king WILL APPEAR, DON'T FOLLOW him he IS THE ANTICHRIST!*  NOTE: *SOON SOCIAL MEDIA WILL DISAPPEAR GO TO MY CHANNEL AND COPY MY COMMENTS AND VIDEOS SO YOU CAN SHARE WITH OTHERS ON DISKS. NOT ALL OF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE HEAVEN (THE RAPTURE), YOU'LL BE THE REVOLUTIONIST FOR JESUS DURING THE 7 YEARS OF THE ANTICHRIST. BE READY TO HELP OTHERS. DURING THE 7 YEARS, THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE HEAVEN IS TO BE A MARTYR FOR THE CAUSE OF JESUS. YOU DON'T DO IT BECAUSE OF THE PAIN YOU FEEL. YOU DON'T DO IT BECAUSE YOUR SCARED. YOU ONLY DO IT BECAUSE YOU REALIZE WHAT A MISTAKE YOU MADE AND NOW YOUR WILLING TO GIVE YOUR LIFE FOR THE CAUSE OF JESUS. BE BOLD IN THOSE DAYS, OTHERS WILL BE WATCHING YOU AND WHAT YOU DO WILL INFLUENCE THEM. MAKE WISE CHOICES MY FRIEND. THERE IS A CELEBRATION IN HEAVEN EACH TIME SOMEONE COMES TO THE SAVING KNOWLEDGE OF JESUS. DON'T LET EVIL STEAL YOURS AWAY FROM YOU. STAND STRONG AND WHEN I SEE YOU I'LL GIVE YOU A BIG HUG AND A KISS ON THE NECK AND WE'LL CELEBRATE FOR ALL ETERNITY!*

PERFEITAAAAAAQ
WHAT A WOMEN AND WHAT A SONG
Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.  For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. Romans 1:24-27 Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand!

I have always believed that Iggy, before this video released, got a lot of unfair criticism and her music career has not been nutured.  While she is the performer, one thing I can't get past now is, "WHO IN THE FUCK ALLOWS THIS IGNORANT SHIT TO HAPPEN?"  There's not one percent of me that watched this and didn't clearly see she's doing not just blackface but blackbody.  She makes the white, English bloke KPop stan who underwent the knife and publicly announced they identify as Korean now look like a fucking saint.  And while I couldn't imagine Iggy herself being racist, ffs she did have a child with Playboi Carti, I can imagine she's being handled by some of the most incompetent people in the business.    If I'm Iggy, I get ahead of this yesterday.  Fire every fucking agent, manager, and hanger on moron in a 100 mile radius.  Tell the label to get their shit together because nobody wants to be signed to a fucking circus.  Put out a public statement, acknowledging that you fucked up and lacked foresight.
biiiitch this is perfect for the gay clubs
She's still a terrible rapper
Louboutins is really good
This is sure black fishing how she start from pasty white to fucking black that tan is so aggressive to the point where it looks like she is a whole different race that's not what's up
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Don't want your love, don't want your problems - my new summer mood!

Sooooo good

Cool
Rachel Dolezal is back? Just when I was wondering what she was up to! 🤔 😆
Copying azalea banks isn’t gonna work for u hun

Carti said "I need more Kylie, and go get a spray tan too please. Also, find out who does Bhad Bhabie's hair."

Call out all the barbz
Ummm why did I think this was a black girl…. This is too far now
goodluck to her child explaining this in school
Oooh please, you guys a reaching!! she is not black fishing. Trying to make issues, takes away from the bigger picture.
how is she doing blackface? shes liteally tanned and made her her black.
Queen.
Iggy Brasileira nunca desiste💪 up.
Es una continuación de work
This Song IS a BOP Iggy 🥰
Rus asking 🗣
The "blackfishing" accusations are absolutely ridiculous. Might I add, two of the dancers in the back don't look POC and have the exact same complexion as Iggy does in the scene. Pretty sure the House of Balmain wouldn't let that slide anyway, it's clearly the lightning.
Ew this video is gross

Loved the song... It's a bop... But that tan... Is no no

Who told her this was a hit
The thing I'm questioning is, why in the world did she leave her purse on the middle of the road in the beginning?
People do realize that lighting can change your skintone right.......
Entregou tudo mamãe
Essa batida é o despertador da minha bunda 🤯
I AM THE, THE STRIPCLUB

AZALIA BANKS
Iggy serviu tudo afsss
Omg she’s just hella tan .. nothing wrong with this video & I LOVE THIS SONG !!!!
This is sooo Azealia Banks
waiting a tik Tok a dance for this
It’s the dancers for me💞
Esta canción me tiene increíblemente encantado. 🤩🔥❤️😍
2.3k OMG THIS is amazing
Damn this sucks, why did YouTube recommend this garbage, surprised iggy still even has followers
The legendary season 1 winners House Father of Balmain & his kids are in this video. She's definitely trying to attach herself to the gay movement and get loyal fans. The bike scene reminds me of Eve and Gwen Stefani (let me blow your mind video) she's normally white as snow. The dark hair and tan skin she's unrecognizable. Iggy should sit this one out! Go Wright children's books or something
soooo fucking garbage.
💚
Yo this shit 🔥trash🔥
Absolute Goddess.  This is how you say F… the system. I’ll do it my way!!!! - Frank Sinatra. Many Blessings to you IGGY you deserve it.
O Brasil te amaaa
Maravilhosaaa
Iggyzzz
She knows her biggest fan base are straight guys right?🤦‍♂️
I can’t stop listening this song
Todays music is garbage 🗑
It’s a serve!
Something Iggy has that no one else has is her sheer creativity and unique concepts. From "Change Your Life" to "Fancy" to this and the "In My Defense" era, Iggy has always been in a lane of her own.
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
FYE... F. Y. E
Ok so she went from blackfishing to blackface lmao like 👀 is somebody going to remind her shes a white girl from Australia or?
GOT THA BIG ROCKET LAUNCHER
This gives me Call Me Motha vibes and I’m here for ittttt
Bom dia pra quem já inicia o dia ouvindo esse hino
😍😍😍😍
The most mind-boggling thing about her is she's as Aussie as Steve Irwin. If you didn't know anything about her or seen what she looks like, you'd swear she was an African American woman. Forget the video, just listen to her music! LOL.
Ummmmm drop the location so I can go Pick that purse up off the ground 😩 #ThankYou 💋
THE LEGEND OMGGGGGGG
THIS IS SO ICONICCC I LOVE IT
I love u iggy
a whole ass serve 💆‍♀️

She left her bag at the beginning and it’s really annoying me 😂
Excellent  ♥️  ♥️  song 🎵  music 🎶

Todo dia tem que enaltecer esse hino
SLAYY
Idk bro you look human to me becuz a strip club is a type of club that has performers who dance while removing their clothes and have security protect strip club. Most strip clubs are also bars which serve alcohol. Many communities have rules on strip clubs, such as rules on how many strip clubs are allowed to exist in the community, rules on the minimum distance that must be kept between dancers and customers, or rules on what clothing cannot be taken off (e.g. panties).
Nothing more disgusting to see than someone who is ashamed to be white, I have nothing against African Americans or any other race, it just nauseating to see white  people blackfishing.
This song wasn't added on some playlists on Spotify, zero support from the industry, zero radio airplay NOTHING! I salute Iggy for putting music independently. That's why I'm proud of her in every little achievements she got. WAY TO GO IGGS!!!!
iggy always innovating, i love everything this girl does
Black fishing I don’t think so there’s nothing wrong with her darker make up and hair most girls here in uk look like that? And there light skinned under make up and fake tan?
QUEEN
Goo girll
Well I guess since azealia banks went nuts there was gap in the market for dance music
Lol her rap voice is hilarious
🔥🔥
😜😜😜😜😎 Love
People gotta realize this is filmed at NIGHT! she is literally whiter than all of the backup dancers yet people still gonna accuse her of blackfishing because of the lighting.
This edit is horrid lol
You’re an industry plant your that elf chick iggy azalea get a real career
Her voice is unique and The Men did there Thing! Those were some Bad Chicks on those Bikes and the song was 👍

The male dancers, the women riding motor cycles and the jets having smoke the color of the bi flag at the end… she did THAT 😤
Slllaaaay

Chris Broad, representing his 2 million subscribers, was completely right about you.   Your music makes ordinary people question,  "Was the Big Bang really worth it?"  In a nutshell, your music sucks rotten eggs, and it sounds like a bloody wet fart.
I love how Iggy highkey does Drag.
I’m obsessed with this song and video!!!! Cmon Iggy!!!!
Slay me mami !!!
PERIOD IGGY LOVE IT
For anyone that says she’s black-fishing, Iggy doesn’t even fish for black fishes. She said fuck the hip hop community cause she doesn’t need your acceptance 💋

Nossa, o flow da Iggy tá muito perfeito aqui.
Aceite você ou não, mas a Iggy é uma das maiores rapper de todos os tempos e sempre será. A Rainha serve, viu.
A batida ficou muito perfeita com o flow da Iggy.
Umas das melhores músicas de todos os tempos.
A melhor parte é a que começa e a pior é a que termina. Iggy você foi genial nessa música e clipe.
Eu coloquei esse hino no paredão, e a música parece que fica 1000% melhor. Sério, coloquem em um som alto e façam o teste.
O vício pesado nesse hino!
Tudo o que eu quero: O fim da pandemia no Brasil, pra poder finalmente dançar esse hino em uma balada.
Eu quero MUITO dançar essa música em uma festa.
😍😍😍😍
This is the Best Female Rap Song of 2021 so far. Convince me otherwise!!!
Very Dope visuals
A melhor da carreira.
Okay
Sério que música boa, Iggy. Você acertou tanto nesse hino!
Agora a meta é 3 milhões.

For the people claiming this is blackface... this seems to be more like trying to be Kardashian-like tan. If anything this is more a "latinface" which makes me feel very much appreciated! This song is FIERCEEEE

I read that this video had "blackfishing". I don't know what that means but it sounds like the people who use that term are REALLY racist
Iggy赶紧回春
Visuals ☑️  Beat ☑️ Iggy 🔥🔥🔥
Epic 👑
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

NOT THE WORK OUTFIT OMG
OOOUUUUUU IIIIIAAASSSSSSS SHIT
Ok why r the bikes trying to look like they scraping they aint even close

Que rico ese bajeo😍❤
Why'd she leave her bag?
Love the 90s dance theme ✨
Simbora gente, tá perto de 2M!!!!
why can’t white people just be white
Trash !
Vou ouvir muito na gym 💪
I saw part of this video so I came here, she deserves support
I'm black and I don't see nothing by blackfishing, Iggy I love ya 'n you so pretty in it. My question is...why don't talk  shit when Nicki, Megan, Cardi, Beyonce and others wear blond wig like whitefishing. BULLSHIT
Vem 2M
Add ....Gym List ❤️❤️❤️
AMAZINGGG
INCREDIBLEEE
so good !!!!!!
Omgggg the dark hair everything 😍
My ears are bleeding
Iggy you are the best!
This is kinda generic overall but im glad she's back, i just hope it's not to late.
Did she change race?
I’m the número 1😍🔥🔥🔥
Let's make it to the 2M GOOOOO
*The bogan colonizers are at it again.*
I already need her to dance at a party. 🔥🔥
I respect her as an artist, just didn't like the music video. Music videos you are supposed to see the artist sing there song, you barely saw her and when you did not alot of close ups.. it made no sense
Aussie bogan, Amethyst Amelia Kelly, appropriating black people again.
I love the work thing.
Avisa que é ela
Perfeitaaaaa
Work in the stripclub 🔥🔥
She  back bitches
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
*LORD JESUS DIED & ROSE AGAIN TO FREE U FROM SIN ACCEPT HIS GIFT* ✝️✝️
Definitely a club banger
I LOVE Iggy. She brings the heat. This video is one of the best music videos I've watched in awhile. Perfect and perfect
Fruit of the Doomed
Who fine the purse 👜 on the road 🛣️
I love this video
I don’t care for any of y’all, she ain’t doing no blackfishing Iggy is just serving face looks and all the rest of it whilst being her authentic self…do your thang Sass! #Living4iT 💕😘🤩💁‍♀️✅

Iggy’s era can never end Also this is the best time for us to be our own strip club y’all eps for those countries that are still in lock down
Tenho tanto orgulho!
MARAVILHOSAAAAA 💛
Dann, she still looks like Marlon brothers White chicks 😂
siiiiiimmmmmmmmm
This is gonna b a hit for them gay clubs 💅🏻
Complete garbage.
I like it
I love this so much
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Does anyone else find it ironic that men are blamed for the sexualisation of women, and are blamed for the pressures on young girls to look "hot" and act older than they are, and then the same women that point their fingers at men and accuse them of being misogynists/sexist then scream "You go girl! Empower yourself!" when female artists bring out songs called "I Am The Stripclub"?
K mamadas🧐🤔
Goal 100M Vistas ❤🔥😍
What should the kids learn from this disgusting video
Good song. Could have done without the dudes wearing thongs tho
Omg! Continuación de #Work 😍😍😍😍😍
Iconic
I thought I was going to hate this song but I love it 😻☺️❤️💯💯💯💯👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👍🏿 great job Iggy ❤️ and house of Balmain 💯👍🏿.
Iggy understood the agenda…. I mean assignment 😏
Maravilhosa rainha do lacre cis 🇧🇷
Goal 100M ❤🔥
Nice throu back but damn this auckst

Iggy grew into Iconic Level!
Iggy, this is a bop👏🏻💯 what a creative video too
That’s gay.

The good sis ATE, no leftovers.

Manda muito bem 👏🏼
shittttttttttttttttt. that was so good.
Rainhaaaaaa
https://youtu.be/-VRL6vMXjxc
this song deserves all the grammys it can get this is the best song that I have heard in my entire life
Bruh wtf
How did Iggy go from a White woman to looking Latina?🤣🤣🤣 She looking thick and juicy as fuck too in this video😁😁😁
This video and song are Great, Iggy Do it , SHE LOOKS CALIENTE!! ♡
I've never wanted a click back so bad in my life.
What a horrible video.
dis strip club stuff is original
huh?
Can us black women get out swag back??!?!?!?!
Glad I had exposure to older music.  This is junk.
I don't know why she is so underated
"the end of an era" ???
I love you Iggy Azaela
Thank you Australia.
Wack
Remember that youtube bans its own creators for saying another creator is ugly, but allows this
Her armpit shows the truth 😂
*MY EYES* 💀☠
wow
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️
stripclub !!
Deusa ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Respectfully, this song is ass and she has fallen into obscurity.
Girl got herself a tan🤎
Wassup with all the gay dudes in vid need some female's up in here
YOOOOO
Lol but when Azealia Banks does this type of music yall hate her for it.
🇧🇷💛💚❤️
Queen
Song so trash but iggy so bad bruh 😂😭
Queen of rap
A Iggy é bizarra, uma obra de arte 🔥👄
Queen is back with club hit! 🔥
Nice blackfishing
lol this its not cool to watch this
Proud
Let's keep watching !!!
Its iggy its
I was prepared to hate it but I must admit it's pretty good..
Nah    This aint it
I love it 🥵❤️
1.800.000
WHO THE FUCK IS THAT GUY
At 1st I was upset that youtube didnt automatically put this in my recommended list. 47 seconds in seeing her aint worth the visual torture of seeing these men in thongs.
Make trend on tiktok
Iggy azalea???? nicca i thought that was Monica,or brandy,or somebody black.wtf
Stunning
Notice how men and women are doing the opposite things in the video. Normally women are the back up dancers and the men are the bikers. Ik it’s the absolute minimum but absolutely love it
Song is missing something like a catchy singer??? Another flop
Since when did Iggy turn into a Kardashian?
Hay ando de stripclub
200k pra 2M agnt consegue até 1h
Iggy supporting the gays, QUEEN! Cmon Balmain!
💅🏻💥👠👯🏿‍♂️👯🏼‍♂️🏳️‍🌈💋

OoOoOooo dark hair!
QUEEEEEN TE AMO IGGY
I thought iggy was white?
WOWWWW I LOVED
I couldn’t even recognize her omggg she is such a culture vulture
This is some hot garbage
QUEEN IGGY
What can we expect from a British rapper 😂😂 now just blackfish and use LGBTQ BLACK FOLX ass your little accessories and profit off there culture verryyy much MODERN COLONIZER BEHAVIOR 😂😂 and I don’t wanna see no “pick me” fan defend her bc I won’t reply why ? Bc there is nothing to argue I’m just speaking straight factsss keep glorifying your Colonizer rapper
Is she intentionally going for that poorly dubbed Anime effect or is something wrong with the audio synch for this upload ?
Igloo Australia is sooooo obsessed with the black aesthetic. It takes more than a BBL GIRL!
A white Australian woman singing like she is black
Giving off very muchh colonizer energyyy
Culture vulture
Culture vulture !!!
https://youtu.be/noy4K37wmtY
CULTURE VULTURE
Dumbest thang I've ever heard!!!
The literal only reason i clicked on this video was to see girls getting naked and Iggy cant even get that right 🤦‍♂️
I just seen this post about this song saying she was blackfishing. People need to stop with this stupid racial stuff...just live your life it's to short to cry about every little thing...
0:00 DOES ANYONE GET THIS REFERENCE PLS TELL ME!!
The dudes in this are rancid
Terrible music video.
Wtf is up with the guy strippers or whatever I was extremely concerned and freaked out pls chill with this shit
forgot your purse...
The Whitephobia in on full force with this video.
You know I really didn’t need to see guys in female stripper clothes or what ever the fuck it was.        Where’s the bleach when you need it
When you click thinking your gonna see Iggy shake ass but end up seeing dudes in stripper clothes shake ass instead 😮😔
*interacting for the algorythm*
Te amo con mi vida 💞👌
Yesss bitch💚❤🔥
Queen we love you ❤️
This song...is shit
This song is FIRE 🔥🔥 So happy for you IGGY💅🏼
Awesome song!! 👍

Alguien noto que al principio del video lleva puesto el mismo vestuario que en work?
Iggy es una perra asombrosa.
Gross video, ok song 🤮
Esse clipe tá icônico
If this is the epitome of fundamental living for young women today, we’re in for more fuckery in our future, this vid wreaks of self afflicting isolation and ignorance towards self care.
this is blackfishing
👏🏻🎶🙌🏻🎶🎶🙌🏻🎶🎶🙌🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤✌🏻
Don’t let this flop
Capricharam nas motos fake.. 🤛🏼 Cheguei a duvidar.. 🤔

Blackfish much?
Absolutely disgraceful
reminding us pride month is all year long with this ballroom beat and THE house of balmain 😌💅🏻
Let me educate you for a hot minute. Iggy is Australian. We don’t have the highest rate of skin cancer in the world for nothing. Many Australians idealise having a dark tan. It has nothing to do with race. Look at the sides of her boobs and under her armpits in the bikini. Obviously a fake tan. Nothing to do with race. Any white person can get that level of tan from sun exposure. Just not healthy for them.
Wth
O monstro Iggy ataca novamente ‼️‼️
Best 🧨🧨🧨
what it means  the end of an era??? and obviously amazing Iggy 😍🔥
wrote, completed & ACED this ASSignment  !!
🥰🥰🥰
🥵🥵🥵
The concepts! The slay! The looks! 👀

I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE LISTEN TO SHIT LIKE THIS, IT IS SO OVER PRODUCED THERE IS LITERALLY NO TALENT HERE JUST A ROBOT. AT LEAST HER RAPPING IS WAY BETTER THAN BEFORE - MUSIC FOR LOOSERS, EMPTY SOULS, AND THE LOST GENERATIONS...

Black Face; fake butt and boobs???? WTF
The switch up from sip it to this 🙌  The versatility Iggy always  brings is unmatched 👏🏽
what does she mean by the “end of an era”?
Pena que não faz mais sucesso
She made this specifically for gay clubs 🥰
really like this one
Uk in this biiihhh🎀🎀🎆💜💜💜
Amo
Be careful who booty you looking at it might be a man twerking at you 😆 🤣 😂 it fooled me to awwwww the decit 😆 🤣 😂
Just because this white women has a mixed race child does not mean she is now a POC. She should not be darker then me (someone who is actually a POC)
Que temon
Damn Iggy! Ahhhhhhhh period  #iamthestripclub is out now! 😩😩😩😩
Divaaa Brasil te amaaa
The people claiming she looks black are so retarded. She looks white and all she did was wear black hair. All of us on Twitter were talking about how y’all idiots would do this just because the spotlight is on Iggy for afew seconds. Also the nasty af straight men hating on the gay men who are strong enough to show their truth and slay

Я думал она "не такая" )))
Non delude mai lei, è inutile
Adoreiiiiii!!refrão icônico!!!👏👏👏👏👏💘💘💘
Whew! This song has me turnt out. I loved what I heard. Iggy, you got a hit. They gonna be blasting this at all the parties. Congratulations.
I grew up without a Father. So many walk that same path of life, never knowing the TRUE guidance a Father can provide, the sense of protection, the unwavering love a Father is supposed to extend to his children.  It only got harder once I had children of my own, HOW do I be a Father, when I don’t even know what it means…so many abandon their children asking that same question to themselves.  God changed everything, God began showing me what it meant to love, to care, to nurture…but not just my children, but those around me “thy neighbor”.  I realized I knew no Father, just so I could come to know THE FATHER, when the time was right 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽  We are going to have “Moments of Uncertainty”  But that is not as important as the element you use to relieve yourself. Many followers of Christ are still indulging in our vices and addictions to relieve our “Uncertainties”  Lean on God in your darkest moments, lean on the word that says you were created with meaning and purpose, lean on the Grace of God…let it steady your mind, your heart and your body.  I don’t know who I’m writing to, who’s reading this, but God is ready, and waiting for you to seek him, through Jesus Christ, whom he sent to die the death meant for you and I.  Not just on Sunday, not just when you “need” him, not just when you’re desperate…but every day, hour, minute and second of your life.  Develop consistency in Christ, and you will come to know what it means to “Be still, and know, that he is God”  Glory be to God 🩸🩸🩸  If I still have you here, God bless you, join me as I take you inside a moment of my own personal “Uncertainty” in life, while never forgetting God has me always 🙏🏽🕊  https://youtu.be/VXfWQtxnwqc  🩸
This is trash 🗑

so I was brushing my hair and like I got flashback from when iggys music came out and like if you don’t support her from the beginning I mean you can still talk to me but keep it in mind i was here from day 1 💅🏻
I love it 🔥
I-G-G-Y always gives us the whole plate, making sure we full🥺🖤💛🖤
Wtf is this. Why is Iggy the same complexion as Nikki Minaj all of a sudden..
Gay clubs about to be lit
This song is wack
I don't see what controversy is about tbh... I actually can say I like the song, club music was always upbeat and vibing
C’mon ‘Work’ video reference/continuation!!!
Her tan is a little darker than much lol

Que música perfeita, que ódio
this video is SIIICCCKKK! Iggy knows how to deliver a hit. Her going independent was the best decision ever. EVERY SONG since Kream has been a bop! I am rooting for you girl! and Iggy if you are reading this, let the trolls be! block block block. We got your back <3
I wish she could sing instead of rap. She's great to look at.. but not a fan of her rapping 🤷🏿‍♂️
Carti should be in this
Omg😍😍

blackfishing
No me gusto creo que ella le copea la letra a las raperas negras 📖✏️
KNOCK KNOCK who der ?  A REAL RAP B1+cH
Question for the comment section, do you think we’re getting better or worse as a society?
https://youtu.be/RuevmGAl94c
Wow, I cannot believe that this Iggy Azalea, character is still able to pass as a natural born female. How is this possible? Do people have amnesia or what, and not able to recall the  numerous obvious body modifications, surgical and otherwise that have been undergone to hide or at least try to disguise this massive, and very masculine mighty man- that is still very obvious despite all that has been done to attempt a camouflage job? You do not agree? Have you listened to this song? This person is not exactly hiding what they are. They are playing a game with you and everyone else that is not privy to the real secret. This entity tells you right there in it's song that it has a d¡©k. These are called androgynes. It is not a new thing. If you did not know then catch up. What? You did not realize that you were still living in Babylon amongst the heathens and the beasts? Well, you are.
Podreeee
This is everything! Go Off Iggy 🗣
o black face da gata
Pelo amor de Deus essa tem que ficar no mínimo #30 na Billboard, vamos apoiarrrr
She's blacker than Lil Kim chile

Mdss a roupa de zebra, é a msm que a Anitta usou numa premiação aí esses dias atrás 😍
How can people dislike this so much? It’s a damn bop and Iggy always serves with her visuals!
I can't stop hearing this song and dancing to it too!!

🗑️
The serve of this video
Keep watching
I'm sorry but I don't get blackfishing from this video! She's stunning! If i were pale and had bright lights on me I would look washed out, but with some time in the sun you get a healthy tan. How is a tan blackfishing? Stop reaching for an excuse to cancel someone.
oh she black now?????? her new name is iggy kardashian?
I thought you were white what happend?
Fodona
Hit
Sou muito fã
Te amo
Eu sou uma Strip club
Amooo
Te amo mulher

Sounds like 212 by azalia banks
1) Iggy hacked Azealia Banks' flow, music and MV (heavy metal and reflective) 2) However, Iggy is not blackfishing, do y'all know what actual black people look like?
I am it tho
Completamente obcecada
cat walk
Fans de Anitta apoiando essa lenda💞

Everyone is talking about her blackfishing, but no one talks about how wack this song is.
Ainda em alta aqui no Brasil. Vamos colocar no top 10.
so on top of the blackface n using the pimp line as she’s dancing around black men insinuating that she pumps out black ppl/men u have this boring repetitive song no bars no flavor no cadence jus… no
Those are considered men? 🤣
Iggy como sempre servindo talento e música boa, eu amo demais 😍❤❤
white women really do be here tanning until they look like poc huh
Brunette iggy reminded me Nicki SO MUCH omg IGYY SENTA NA MINHA CARA! Brazil loves you

Jesus is coming back very soon. We must be ready.   1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  1 John 5:13  These things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may KNOW that ye have ETERNAL LIFE, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
Wait, this shits hard

The only method this chicken has found to get people to watch his music video is to do black fishing
She should strongly consider retirement.

Being a hater is a mental disease, you’re literally refusing facts because you’re so hellbent on telling a lie 🤦🏾‍♀️.

These kids defending iggy for black fishing saying it’s the lightning and hiding behind the gay protection are the same ones that are doing blackface and talking like Danielle breggoli with their  friends.  Iggy is clearly racebaiting again

Caralho arrepiei até o cabelo de cu na primeira cena, gritei SMASH HIT
This is fucking disgusting, eww absolutely apalled. What has happened to the world. How is this right. People are fried, theres no way anyone can defend this. I cant for the love of me understand how people believe this is right and i dont understand how this is them being themselves wtf yuck, everyone that thinks this is right is just plain stupid. 🤮🤮🤮
the first clip really took me back
She IS THE MOMENT!
for some reason i only see comments in brazilian or spanish but why is no one talking about the blatant black face? iggy, i thought you were comfortable with being a white woman you are, even tho you were rapping in blackcent in your early stages of career (but you moved on and stopped i think for a while). now this? you have never been this colour, just because your baby is mixed it doesn’t mean you are black. please stop pulling a kim kardashian, it’s so weird.
Okayyyyy WORK reference!!!!!!
🤮
Ela serviu tanto 💗
She needs to stop with the blackfishing...but she clearly said she doesn't give a fuck.
BEST BEST BEST 🔥🔥🔥
Iggy on the back of that ATV has huge Eve vibes.
I think Iggy forgot she’s white 😬

RIP Music!
I think she did something really powerful by putting girls riding motorcycles and boys dancing in heels
I didn’t know she was black
Is she taking testosterone? Her voice sounds deep.
A knock of the azealia banks wave / she probably YouTubed herself and found  AB by associated name and ran with it :)
Black Queen

tell carti to drop the deluxe i aint watchin this shit
Wow so original and so classy…
Playboi Carti wya?
Stop accusing Iggy of blackfishing. She has spoken along with her makeup artist, about the use of the same makeup in all scenes of the clip, including the scene from the beginning with the outfit from the clip of "Work", is the same makeup used in the truck. The difference is the light of the environment that has darkened.
A bop <3

'The end of an Era' at the end of the video plus leaving the bag that she also had in 'work' on the road? Iggy is up to something BIG 😍

Wow that was garbage ugh I feel bad for her
Hinooo amoooo

Top Tier 10/10
This is hilarious 😂 she’s talking about being the stripclub for 2 minutes yet she barely moves, she’s just sitting there lipsinging😂
She could only afford this position on “trending”?
Now that's how you make a comeback 🥰
I love you Iggy but why men twerking tho but the song is lit
She said “Kick it like Judo” but there are no kicks in judo. Foot sweeps and trips. But not kicks.
I can’t be the only one who is a living for the throwback to Her “Work” out fit …
Princess of rap!!!
Quueeeeeeen!!!!!!🥴
Could do without the dudes in the truck but alright
Omg cool that she referenced her look on Work
X0.75 OMG!!!
Damn ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Iggy shows her support, now show yours
Director : iggy how do you want this shot ? Iggy : more gay than lil nas x
There was so much that could have been explored here. Missed great opportunity to show amazing dance/ strip moves!!! Fell flat!!
She left her chic hand bag 👜 on the highway 🛣. I like the new song 🎵 😌.
Maravilhosaaaaaaaaaa sempre e perfeita
This song sucks lol
When tf did she get brown 💀
Did you really try to change your race for a music video

She really summoning the gays here
Absolutely disgraceful.

Damn Murica really falling
When Iggy said:  “Called my job told ‘em suck my dick Send my check I'm not clockin' in”  I felt that.
Vai vamos bater 2M logo
not y’all getting upset bc she has a slight tan and is wearing bronzer & counter?!?! Lol why don’t y’all have the same energy to mrs ariana grande? she looks nothing like herself
She was so popular when Fancy came out then she did that weird rap at an event and everyone found out she was from Australia and faking a southern accent.
Disgusting

Já que a Iggy entregou e sempre entrega tudo tanto nas músicas quanto nos vídeos, vamos entregar pra ela 1 milhão antes de 24hrs. Come on bitchsssss
here in brazil is #21 among the most popular videos of the day
You are loved. Loved and important. You are a beautiful creation from the hands of a person who loves you more than you could ever imagine love. Material things will remain here on earth. You came into this earth with nothing and you will LEAVE this earth with nothing. Repent of your sins and come to Jesus Christ the Lord. You will perish without turning from these evil ways. I pray you will all be saved. I once was lost  Like the people in this video are lost. But God RESCUED me from never-ending pain and suicide. God bless you. Come to Christ!!♥️🙏🏿🙏🏿✝️
We’re definitely hitting 1 million in under 24 hours. Good job Azaleans, I’m heading to sleep now.. it’s been so fun supporting our girl iggys release 🙏
I'm glad she never give up even if  the entire industry turns his back on her.

VAI CHEGAR A 1 MILHÃO PATROAAAA

YAAAS QUEEEN
This song is a BOP. Fuck anyone with anything bad to say😂
Stream na Queen sim
Iggy entrega qualidade e ngm da a mínima ela merece muito mais
Bora Brasil  ensinar  pros gringos que nos somos foda iggy
Hey! So catchy, boys and girls! Wow
Wondering why Yahoo brought me here saying Iggy was "Blackfishing" . There are white girls that have black hair and dye their hair black. They also like a tan. She in no way looks so dark she looks black though or "Blackfishing ". She also has her hair yellow then blonde in half the video. People need to calm down on some of those accusations because this is not one of those cases.
We’re RISING AND RISING on the USA trending page… from 18 to 14😍 congrats Iggy
1M50K em 24h aaa
This is such a vibe😩 the beat has me dancing ALL DAY

Toma uma lacrada da fada

We need to stream this harder than ever so it can be added to the Billboard Hot 100❤️.
LOVE the nod to ‘Work’ music video in the beginning. If you didn’t catch it. Are you really an Iggy Stan?
Gay guy twerking? Naw I’m out. Gotta delete my search history now.

Obrigada pelo refresco mamãe!

who sold her a rejected todrick hall song? 💀💀💀 dollar tree kardashian lookin ass
her tan is darker than me and i'm brown.
Yep!!!😍
a whole blackfish
why does she, a white woman, look like a deeply tanned latina like ???? things are not connecting here.
Negative attention is still attention.
Rainha!! A cara do Brasil essa música!!
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
doesn't have an azealia banks vibe + gays ?
All the hate comments are either from racists or homophobic people. Yikes y'all are a mess. Y'all love to create problems that are not there. Enjoy her music or just leave ☺️

Clearly blackfishing
Lol know some of these dudes
The way she's using a tan to look darker is, shameful. She's literally 3 shades darker than she normally looks and y'all still wanna defend her just bc she's pretty or has good music. Darker skin is trendy now all the white girls be looking like a whole other race. She is literally white as snow, why not appropriate the skin tone you have now?
She’s perfect 😫😫😫♠️
This need to be on GTA 6
I liked most of iggy’s other songs but this one feel so.. boring? Like idk there’s nothing memorable about it, I listened to it 5 mins ago and I forgot what it goes like...
OBRIGADO POR TUDO <3
YES!! YES YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS

Iggy assim como Bebe rexha, Katy Perry, Meghan trainor, Jessie j entre outras, são artistas grandes que entregam projetos incríveis e estão sendo boicotadas, elas deveriam se juntar e fazer música juntas!
Rainha do rap

She's right the end of this era has already gone by.   Madonna (vogue), Annie Lennox (no more i love you's) did this while it mattered.  With everything so readily accepted the video comes off like a sparkler as the only firework on the 4th of July.    She's in good shape, the dancers are in good shape, everyone looks nice, what maybe worse than racism, sexualism, is normalism.   The truck and those cycles all stay in the lanes, swerving doesn't matter.    The rapping is very stacatto , piece-mealed together.  Like the models in the video, she's using the lyrics to extenuate herself.    Is she still pretty, yes.     Her fans seem to really be into her, so this will play well at the club scene, mixed in with some disco vibes.  Her next video should be of her baking a cake, if you want normal then let them have cake.

I LOVE her versatility, this is so good
I literally felt brain cell activity diminishing during the course of this song.  This is what’s classified as talent nowadays?
This sounds so industry there is no way she wrote this
Make this bop get to 1 million views !!!🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
I really wish iggy  was big like she use to like she should be up there with Megan and Doja
💯💯💯💯💯
Bruh, this is blackface. Saw someone on Twitter say ‘OK OUTBACK BELCALIS’ lmfao

what with all the gay stuff these days in vids and demonic symbols?
White people are doing so much black fishing that at this point I legitimately can not tell the difference between them and an actual light skin black person 🙁
If nothing else she has an amazing fan base and that has to say something. Honestly, there's so much love in these comments. Between reading them and watching the video, Im feeling a serotonin and endorphin boost  And isn't that what art is really all about?! 👏👏👏
Mds é a maior que temos amooooo Caralhooooo
Are we just not gonna point out how :54 and 2:38 are not even close to the same same skin tone?? Iggy lookin like a chameleon lol

I just read on The Daily Beast that she’s been accused of “blackfishing.” Isn’t that just called “Kardashianing?” Jokes aside, the whole idea of the video/song is that she is telling her significant other that she can fulfill their fantasies. Sounds pretty great to me.

What is the era that’s ending?
It never ends, does it?   Pop music is dead.   The strippers and gangbangers have taken over.
A lot of people just start being so dramatic with this again on Twitter. People love hating on her again.

Hello Iggy, my name is Alejandro and I consider myself Azalean, that is, I am a fan of yours.  I have been following you since The new classic and I have been able to see and closely follow all the hatred you have received, I know that people do not deserve you and do not value your art as it deserves.  But not everyone is like that and I wanted you to know that your fans really support you, defend you and above all we enjoy everything you put out.  Thank you for your albums, your mixtapes, your EPs and all the songs you have made.  with impeccable visuals and tremendous looks.  and above all thank you for helping me with my self-esteem and feeling the bitch that I deserve to be.  i love you from now until the end iggy

#endofanera .. is that the album name ?
Those dancers 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵 KILLED IT
Iggy azaleia lançou o hit do ano musa
Why tf is she the same complexion as the black people dancing wit her
I have to say another fire 🔥 🔥 🔥 song and video. Iggy on the back of the four wheel gave me total Gwen Stefani vibe from "let me blow your mind" video with Eve back in the day. Question? What does "end of an era" mean? Will always love Iggy ❤️
Iggy Azalea Is Prettyyy  Iggy Is Best Iggy i love you <3
Quit watching it within 10 15 seconds of the video and  just got scarred was not expecting a bunch of drag queens
Mexico supports you and loves you ❤️🔥

LYRICS [Verse 1] Hit it one time, two times? Too live Laying poolside and it made me woosah Too fine do ya' own thing Imma do mine I'm on cloud nine ‘cause the vibe too high Fat ass, lap dance, pop it on a handstand Big bags, big cash Hit a hundred car fast, don't crash! If you ain't ready don't ask Talk a big game but I know you won't last Keep the dollars on me (Dollars on me) Keep designer on me (Designer on me) Man star trippin'? Ima' find a homie (Find a homie) Swear he Ginuwine trynna ride the pony Face get exposed you can't hide the phoney You know, top of the line Bitch numero uno New coop, two door Two high, Pluto trippin' Said he wanna kick it like judo? Miss him, Iggy been pimpin' listen  [Hook] Don't need dark rooms I am the strip club Don't need red lights I am the stripclub I do the lap dance I ride the pole up I am the, the stripclub Don't want your love Don't want your problems Just need all of, all of the dollars I do the lap dance I ride the pole up  [Chorus] I am the, the stripclub I am the, the stripclub I am the, the stripclub I am the, the stripclub I am the, the stripclub  [Verse 2] I woke up like a bad ass bitch Pretty face with some perfect tits Called my job told ‘em suck my dick Send my cheque I'm not clockin' in Dick magnet - who's askin'? Big Birkin - put cash in Hold my bag I'm ‘bout to get ratchet Get ghost and twerk on a phantom Like when girls come back from vacation Brand new ass she use to get payments Use her mouth for more than just statements Wanna be rich she don't wanna be famous Run it back, yeah let's do it over Wanted dick but I lost composure Two PM on the Rum and Cola Sloppy drunk but I do it sober  [Hook] Don't need dark rooms I am the strip club Don't need red lights I am the stripclub I do the lap dance I ride the pole up I am the, the stripclub Don't want your love Don't want your problems Just need all of, all of the dollars I do the lap dance I ride the pole up  [Chorus] I am the, the stripclub I am the, the stripclub I am the, the stripclub I am the, the stripclub I am the, the stripclub  [Bridge] Don't wait for the night time (No) We can get dirty in the daylight (Go) Watch sweat drip from my waistline (Oh) I’m four shots deep it's playtime (Yeah)  [Instrumental Electro Breakdown]  [Hook] Don't need dark rooms I am the strip club Don't need red lights I am the stripclub I do the lap dance I ride the pole up I am the, the stripclub Don't want your love Don't want your problems Just need all of, all of the dollars I do the lap dance I ride the pole up  [Chorus] I am the, the stripclub I am the, the stripclub I am the, the stripclub I am the, the stripclub I am the, the stripclub

Todos los artistas que colaboraron con ella cuando estaba en su gran auge, debería hacerla crecer. Por ejemplo, Ariana se pego a su fama y tuvo su primer #2 y hoy ni pedos le tira. Hay que ser empaticos.

I think the first part of the music video with her wearing the outfit from "work" and leaving the bag behind possibly symbolizes her leaving that phase of her life behind. ♥️

The end of civilisation is upon us there are men between them women dressed like that joe rogan called it this cross dressing shit has gone levels further than it needed to all involved in the making of this video should consider being alive anymore ffs shame on all you peasants
The mediocrity...
the song is good the the mv aint it
she is about as deep as a puddle ha shallow!
Okay Iggy!!! 🔥
yas sis push the agenda
Yesss sis!! 🙌🏽 love iggy all the way from the uk 🇬🇧
Maravilhosaaa, pena que ela não gosta dos fãs da Anitta e eu sou um fã da anitta e um fã dela tbm então ela não gosta de mim, mas eu amo linda do caralho
STREAM NOWWWW
WHERE ARE THE GAYS? GUYS THIS IS NOT A DRILL
She started off a white woman at the beginning and magically becomes 3-4 shades darker and becomes a transracial black woman. Is this the Jordan Peele movie trailer or what?

If you ain't ready don't ask Talk a big game but I know you won't last Keep the dollars on me (Dollars on me) Keep designer on me (Designer on me) Man star trippin'? Ima' find a homie (Find a homie) Swear he Ginuwine trynna ride the pony Face gets exposed you can't hide the phoney You know, top of the line Bitch numero uno New coop, two door Two high, pluto trippin' Said he wanna kick it like judo? Miss him, Iggy been pimpin' listen  Don't need dark rooms I am the strip club Don't need red lights I am the strip club I do the lap dance I ride the pole up I am the, the strip club Don't want your love Don't want your problems Just need all of, all of the dollars I do the lap dance I ride the pole up  I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club  I woke up like a bad ass bitch Pretty face with some perfect tits Called my job told 'em suck my dick Send my cheque I'm not clockin' in Dick magnet - who's askin'?

Clipe incrível
This is perfect!!! The references... love it!
Iggy Azalea deserve so much better. Hopefully she is doing good for an independent woman.
🌟🌟🌟
I found it very difficult to distinguish between women and men in this song I do not like this type of songs that show that homosexuality is important
me: "I was impatient and looked at Iggy's dms on uniid.Lol that made me cry" later: "I should not have done that" I hope the situation changes

Iggy Azalea deserves everything she do. As an independent artist with zero support from the industry, who give all her efforts just to deliver a top tier body of work deserves nothing but SUCCESS.

The dancers totally killed the vibe of the video for me. It’s fucking revolting, y’all call this empowering? It’s obviously defiling to our species, when are y’all gonna finally start thinking for yourselves.

Iggy just become the first female rapper shooting a music video on the go.......
Disco
🤢🤢🤢
For someone that’s independent her video be so dope. Better than some of these big budget videos that backed by big labels. I’m sure somebody is gonna steal this whole concept. The song is fire as well.
Increíble la amo nunca decepciona su música y videos son artes 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Fire IGGY
She did that
You look beautiful with black hair on.
She is doing everything this era, don't let the album to flop
What is the meaning of end of an era🧐 I hope it’s not retirement
Iggy Azalea x JWhite DID IT tandem are the best!!!!!! THIS IS SUCH A BOP 😈🔥
Fuck 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
SERVE!!!!! Nicki is fuming 😂😂😂😂
A mulher tá um nojo
The dancers were gross af. Ew
It's disposable made-to-sell big room electro-pop-rap... I'm guessing since her career is over from her superstar status days, she's attempting to angle her way into all of the big electronic dance music festivals as a head-liner. It's ok, I suppose. She's got to make a living somehow, but it's absolute trash compared to the masterpiece that is Tyler the Creator's newest album. Just being honest. U do u, do what u gotta go, girl! <3
MAJOR BOP ALERT
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
stream
Bet Carti missing her now
CARALHO!!!! MANDA MAIS!!!!!!
Nice one ey😍
I can see a lot of voguing to this! 💯 keep grinding Iggy be yourself!

Barbz apoyando
Anyone notice she is wearing the same outfit as the “ work “ video 8 years ago?!
Cool that she understands how popular she is with gay men
Ella es talentosa, ella arranca con todo pero que pasa ya no les gusta a mucho lo que ella hace, lleva años por levantarse y no hay suficiente apoyo y lo necesita.... Iggy Azalea es una top rapera pero hay que seguir reproduciendo mas y mas....
I AM THE STRIPCLUB IGGY
The black wig is everything😍
🤤🤤🤤🤤
That opening flow is reminiscent of Ma$e's  from "mo money mo problems" "Now, who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores? You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop? Whose jewels got rocks?"
A gata serviu muitooo. Stream

I AM THE STRIPCLUB [Verse 1] Hit it one time, two times, too live Laying poolside and it made woosy Too fine do ya' own thing Imma do mine I'm on cloud nine ‘cause the vibe too high Fat ass, lap dance, pop it on handstand Big bags, big cash In a hundred car fast, don't crash! If you ain't ready don't ask Talk a big game but I know you won't last Keep the dollars on me (Dollars on me) Keep designer on me (Designer on me) Man star trippin' Ima' find a homie (Find a homie) Sway and you whine trynna ride the pony Face gets exposed you can't hide the phony You know, top of the line Bitch numero uno New coop, two door Two hot, pluto trippin' Said he wanna kick it like judo Missin' Iggy been pimpin' listen  [Hook] Don't need dark rooms I am the strip club Don't need red lights I am the strip club I do the lap dance I ride the pole up I am the, the strip club Don't want your love Don't want your problems Just need all of, all of your dollars I do the lap dance I ride the pole up  [Chorus] I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club  [Verse 2] I woke up like a bad ass bitch Pretty face with some perfect tits Called my job told ‘em suck my dick Send my cheque I'm not clockin' in Dick magnet, who's askin'? Big Birkin, put cash in Hold my bag I'm ‘bout to get ratchet Get ghost and twerk on a phantom Like when girls come back from vacation Brand new ass she used to get payments Used her mouth for more than just statements Wanna be rich she don't wanna be famous Run it back, yeah let's do it over Want a date but I lost composure Two PM on the Rum and Cola Stumpy drunk but I do it sober  [Hook] Don't need dark rooms I am the strip club Don't need red lights I am the strip club I do the lap dance I ride the pole up I am the, the strip club Don't want your love Don't want your problems Just need all of, all of your dollars I do the lap dance I ride the pole up  [Chorus] I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club  [Bridge] Don't wait for the night time (No) We can get dirty in the daylight (Go) Watch sweat drip from my waistline (Oh) Four shots deep it's playtime (Yeah)  [Hook] Don't need dark rooms I am the strip club Don't need red lights I am the strip club I do the lap dance I ride the pole up I am the, the strip club Don't want your love Don't want your problems Just need all of, all of your dollars I do the lap dance I ride the pole up  [Chorus] I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club I am the, the strip club
