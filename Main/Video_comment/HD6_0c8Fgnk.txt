Dave Chapelle admits twice that he "stomped" the man.  And we see him go over to the man who is subdued by 12 men who beat him mercilessly.  And Dave makes jokes?   And Jon stewart is there applauding and giggling?  Dave was hardly a humnitarian when you have the man held down by 12 and then you take your shts.  Pathetic.
Nice video
Nice
Very nice work,  Just keep it up good work.
learned a lesson.
Super 👌
I don't think that dude's seen Chappelle since the, Chappelle Show; Chappelle looks and sounds like he goes to prison just to work out: before he looked wiry, but he's built since then; I think that dude realizes it now.
Some hypocrisy we are, is your democracy and freedom and lies obviously not for everyone David Chapell long live FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION 4 EVERYONE !! … So I'm tired of our media not being honest about Ukraine because there are paramilitary / Nazi Groups it is proven !! .. Always be critical and investigative because you can not count on the media more generally❤️🔥✌🏻✌🏻 ..  With them it is only about control and manipulation❤️❤️✌🏻✌🏻🔥🔥 .. Last thing War refugees are war refugees No matter People are people No matter color religion etc..❤️❤️✌🏻✌🏻 Tired of hatred and difference treatment the 🌈 RAINBOW🌈 it is missing if SPACE FOR MORE! BROWN BLACK COLORS other than white colors and the media's Narrative HOLLYWOOD and Fascist policies with hatred on the HEART👎🏻👎🏻 ..  Freedom Love Compassion security human rights nürenberg tract for EVERYONE❤️❤️✌🏻😘🔥🔥🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸….
Witnesses say man tackled Dave to the ground, yet all I see is someone that looks like they drank too much beer and the washrooms were full as he tried the staff washrooms backstage... WHAT a JOKE!! Come on WPLG I thought you were among the few good Media left.... I find it hilarious that Dave makes money mocking others, but when others mock him he gets butthurt and his celebrity friends get triggered....  This ain't Kansas is it Toto??
You got Will Smith'd Dave! 😂 👊🏾
Your typical everyday stand up comedians get attacked all the time, but when a "famous wealthy comedian" gets attacked, it's a huge deal to everyone, really??   Like normal "non famous" people arent important anymore.  This pothetic wealth, and fame driven society were all living in...smh🤦‍♂️
does anybody know if he was attacked because of a joke or if it was just planned?
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
Smith started a trend
Was that will Smith Ahahaha Chris knows how to lighten a mood man 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.   (Revelation 14:7)
There’s no way. Bro we’re in a simulation 😱😱
Clone......seriously
they did a lot more than just surround the man  they be the fire out of him
California is hard r retarded when it comes to crime.
Thanks Will Smith for your outstanding contribution to 2022.
So ig people are just gonna assault someone if they don't like their joke now

Tackling 2003 Chappelle: No Problem! Tackling 2022 Buff Chappelle: No Way!
I don’t want to sound weird but great to see another Insignares.
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Attack of the Clones
Why is it taking so long to release information about the attacker?  Does he have a police record? Where did he go to school, family, job, is he/she a recent immigrant, etc., There are certain facts that can be gathered in less than 24hrs. Who is this person. Was he a woman dresses as man, or a man dresses as a man, or a woman dressed as a man who identified as a comedian, or  could he/she or it, not find the appropriate bathroom and Dave Chapelle just got in the way?  Can someone please "LEAK" the information.... Because millions will not sleep until they know.. .🤣😂
It’s will smiths foult …! 😂
... show it
Why don't you show the actual attack?
again ❓ comedians now need _ xtra security _
Will smith out here trying to get every comedian
Clickbait
Will Smith is out of control again
what? they don't show him getting tackled in this video
You're not allowed to lie on the internet
Nice content. The truth is, money is worthless until you put it to work. Successful people look for business to invest on and make more money.
not setting good examples for black people recently 😂
Christ died for our SINS, according to the scriptures📜, and that He was buried🪦, and that He rose from the dead on the third day,  according to the scriptures📖 (1Corth15:3-5)   ... all YOU have to do my  friend is:  Put Your FAITH in Jesus Christ, that He took your place   on a cross to die for YOUR SINS  ... and God will grant you ETERNAL LIFE, as a free gift 🎁🙏✨, the very moment You  put your TRUST in Him..  ....God Bless 🙌........
I’m glad Dave is ok
The tolerant left.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

Who cares this happens to people all the time Chappelle is no more important than anyone else. This really is expected and unworthy of international TV. Ukraine was attacked by Russia
What?!? No clip of the incident? and still trending...guess I can't hate on that but still wack,lol
Will Smith strikes again
All the Betas are thinking its their 15 minutes of fame, thanks to Will Simps
wtf is happening man
Sorry to soapbox but there was no "news" there.  News spokespeople are not a story, event or otherwise.  Quit glorifying yourselves.
Chris Rocks comment was f**kin perfect
I guess stand up comics will need a line formed called the punch line.
You can thank Will Smith for this bs gave sjw a reason to just attack people for a joke, these people already get extremely offended by reading tweets let alone hear something that offends them in front of their face
I’m sure Dave is not frightened. Unfortunately all those tards are.
He thought it was chris rock, Chris rock sucks
Man, Dave is a racist and a homophobe, black comedy is all about making fun of those who suffer, or have different sexual preferences etc... but praise this pathetic human as though he is gifted.
Instead of just showing the clip, we have three assholes talking about it... Ffs
IM  SHOCKED THEY ARRESTED THE GUY.....I THOUGHT THEY NEEDED TO WAIT UNTIL DAVE CHAPELLE PRESS CHARGES BEFORE THEY ARRESTED HIM,.....,,ISN'T THAT WAHT THEY SAID IN THE WILL SMITH INCIDENT ??....SUCH HYPOCRISY WHEN IT COMES TO FAMOUS RICH PEOPLE
WTF MAN
This is really confusing to me I thought Black people were allowed to attack Black people in a large public form Like Will Smith, Joanne Howard, I just don’t see what he did wrong. I thought blacks were privileged for this kind of stuff
Is that. Punk in the  county jail
The illuminati stay tryna bring dave down
Dave: How did he get a knife in here?!? Security: Well in my defense sir, it was hidden in his gun
Worst "news" channel ever  Pathetically pathetic
Love your God so that you may enter Paradise. Believe that Jesus is the Son of God. Ask Jesus to enter your life by praying for the salvation of the soul. Be baptized as a sign of your devotion to Christ. Say the prayer for the salvation of the soul when you are ready to dedicate your life to Christ. Repent of your sins and ask Jesus for forgiveness. Vow to follow Jesus for the rest of your life
Well this means that security is going to have to be a bigger role going forward for stand up artists.
Plablicity stunt
Genuinely surprised this hasn’t happened before Will Smith. If it’s that easy to get onstage with a well known comedian, then I feel sorry for the lesser known ones.
People not knowing there were attacks on stages a long time before will smith are clowns as much as will made one of himself.  Do we even know the Motive why dave was attacked?
Dave and Chris have been and still are Kings in comedy. Lately also proving they are Kings in life
Somebody on Instagram captured the aftermatch.....watch?v=v_UX72h0394
“The whole country is turning to b!tchass n*****” -Dave
Berita apa ini, ada yg bisa jelasin gak ngerti soalx
Cool video
I blame Will Smith
This is national news???
Bet the attacker has a, "Co-exist" sticker on their bumper, and goes online and say they tolerate your views and accept your opinions....
That dude learned a hard lesson.
thank you will smith for your contribution to restricting freedom of speech. This is what happens when the toxic mind considers itself a privileged individual. Detached from reality.
Did anyone else come here hoping to actually see the footage?
Man listen, Dave is too humble for something like this to happen to him.
Glad he's ok
This video sucks. It shows nothing. You should block this lame channel
How are people mad when dave chappelle makes fun of himself and his own culture/race. If you dont like the content dont watch it. Why ruin it for NORMAL people that enjoy it
I wonder who's to blame for this running on stage shenanigans 🤔
WTF show the video...
That's cool dude! :D
permission to listen boss kuh... join us for the latest video... the video is very good and interesting, I'm addicted to watching your video continuously, waiting for the latest video, my boss, I'm waiting
I think this was planned. 🤔
Hey guys I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Thx for reading.
Why wouldn't you show the tackle?
I blame will smith
It comes a time we must live right and what comes out of our mouths must be of God. And what I'm surprised that church people are okay with these things. And maybe that's a reflection of our new society.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life74

Joke’s on the attacker, all he did was give Chappelle more material for his next show.
Now, his scary azz have so much too say.🤣💀😹 What a JOKE he is.
Woke/Cancelled culture are now going to ruin comedy. In the future if they continue to reproduce. There will be no longer any more jokes to tell, because all the comedians have died out. Due to people nowadays becoming more offended.
So can I ask a trans woman opinion about abortion.
funny how when its not a rich actor security actually do their job. Fair world we live in eh
Black on Black crime.
Probably was will smith 🤣🤣
Security got caught slipping 🏃🏽🚶🏾👊🏼
NFL try out
Wannabe will
He must knew him or something
Why are there so many crazy people in America?
3k likes and 17k dislikes might tell you something goobers.
Where is security!!!
Useless news, no footage
"He told his guard to remove him" hahahah not quite what he actually said
Keep my wife’s name out your mouth
run up on stage at a Joe Rogan show, please....we really want to see that!
Bro elbow doing the cha cha slide now
Thank you will smith!!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️
The downvote is 17k.
Que video pedorro por diosssss!
They really want us distracted from the fact that the election was rigged
W person for tackling chapel
We’ll have to put Ricky Gervais in a popemobile now and you know he won’t like that.
be nice if you could interview the man so we can hear his declaration. 😂 maybe he wanted a new arm.
People can’t tell jokes anymore. Chappelle will get heat for saying it was a trans and Rock will hear that his jokes are in poor taste. There’s no winning with SJWs.
I was hoping to see footage of him getting tackled. Boo
1.FAKE 2.STAGED
Will Smith started a movement where you get to assault someone in front of millions of people, Nice job Will 👍🏾
😂
I blame Will
Check the sources
I don't like your jokes so much that I'm going to pay for a ticket to not laugh at you😂 the lack of brain cells this generation displays has no bounds.
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
FY,,,,gàng of bitchs
Why are you guys blaming Will smith as of he’s the main reason people are running on stage attacking others. The guy had a weapon; he was just crazy.
I dont believe it.  They didnt show the video?  Why?
That dude learned a hard lesson. After Dave's crew was finished with him, the law gets him.
In that critical moment, Chris Rock delivered the joke the world need to hear.
How about showing us the clip you buffoons
Official term: he got Will Smith’ed
50 seconds of no actual footage of the event OR Chris Rock? Nobody clicked this video to hear you guys describe it like we (mostly) don't have functioning eyeballs
Oh look black on black crime. How I ironic
Dross tenía razón
Play stupid games win stupid prizes
Covering up motive
This show needs to come out on Netflix
So we’re attacking comedians now? Ok.
Oh no! Another story to ignore the people from the real conflicts that are happening!
Chappelle was making jokes about his own bald head and a trans dude got upset, was what I heard.
Physical violence is the logical conclusion of cancel culture. Expect more of this and worse as people who get offended don't get their way like 3 year olds who bite, kick, and punch when told they can't have candy before dinner.
hahahahaha nigga on nigga violence 🤣🤣🤣 he was on will smith's payroll to attack every nigga on stage
Will Smith wannabes
We literally confused about our gender and attacking comics everyday La gender Bender James
Comedians gotta learn krav maga or smn now
Great job William Smithereens
Then show the video idiots
Most dangerous Jobs FireFighters Police Officers Comedians Construction Workers
😂😂😂😂😂😂 was that will smith??
Good I don't like him anyways
God Bless you bro. Still working amidst the chaos
Why go to comedy show when you have no sense of humor...
Will smith started an uprising 👁👄👁
WEIRDDDD
The left is insane and dangerous
Not My Words But Worth Repeating: _"We can't condone violence between us and then condemn violence against us"._
«Progressist» now cancel fun and laugh
I’m disappointed the attack wasn’t shown in the video
KEEP MY WIFES NAME OUTTA YOUR MOUTH
Lmao, what's with comedians being hit.
I can gaurantee if that had been a white guy attacking Bill Burr he would have pressed charges....a black guy?? ,No way.
Where is the video of the attack?
Is that Will Smith great joke (LMBO)🤣🤣😂
Was that will smith - Chris Rock is legendary
<3
The attacker was identified as rapper Isaiah Lee. He is not part of the lgbt community, in fact he is a right wing Trump supporter. The fact that people so easily believe Dave's joke shows just how ingrained Lgbt hate is.
Will Smith?
BLM 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
woah
People are going to say look at this keeps happening. But looked what happened to this sap who charged him. I think people going to think twice about doing that again. Crazy people out there though.
Is the attacker going to announce his trip to India for some 'soul searching'? 🤣
Chappelle is not Chris. He would whoop your behind.
It's all staged man
Wish I could be the first loud black girl hating a successful black man who was not interested in marrying a female from his own race
Chris Rock saying "Was that Will Smith?" is nothing short of legendary. Now becoming a comedian is a high risk job and might deter people from it sadly.
"news"
Dislike button right here
Woke babies. These people are hypersensitive cowards. Stay at home if you're going to hunt for reasons to be offended. A comedy show is the last place on earth you should be.
Didn't even show the tackle. Useless video.
It’s disturbing how much comedians have been physically assaulted lately
You all get over yourselves, get a life and for crying out loud, get a sense of humor. There is too much doom and gloom in this country. If a dam joke offends that's your problem not mine.  For those of you who think your grammar police stuff it.
History will vindicate Will Smith.
Although Will Smith could have had an impact on this situation, it seems unlikely. People who preform on stage are often targeted because they are the main center of attention, and that attention can attract dangerous people :/ but then again Will Smith's actions could have had a part to play
We all know who sent this dumbfuk
PHYSICALLY ATTACKING SOMEONE OVER YOUR OWN PERSONAL BELEIFS, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A HATE CRIME.
Once a person has over a million dollars they aren't funny any more. All "Comedians" are garbage morons whose jokes have to be about offending big groups of people.   Republicans drive big cars because they have little genitals- That was a joke a comedian would make.
🤣🤣🤣 Every comedy show is a 50/50 must see event on the fact that some nut job gonna out do the last one.  This is 100% gonna keep escalating till it becomes fatal.
Serves him right
“Was that will smith”😂😂😂
Will smith started this.
They just went up there to attack because Will Smith did it and they want to get some attention they don't get none @ home
It's finally crumbling.  "Woke" is being thrown away in the trash.  About damn time !!!
They left out Chappel saying it was a trans person who attacked him
Liberals belong at a stand-up comedy performance as much as a Kardashian belongs in a MENSA meeting.
Nice video ABC!
Did him and Chris Rock start a therapy group?
What's that lyric...? Oh yea,..  you wanna hurt a man, dont. Hit him in the shorty. Anyone else realize how trivial this is compared to where the agression is headed? Pretty soon people will be "tampering" with water sources because they took away the Mc-Rib, and nobody is going to be able to stop it. Lol
To who ever sees this…JUST KEEP PUSHING AND STAY FOCUSED. The struggle you're in today is developing strength you need for tomorrow! THE HARD WORK WILL PAY OFF!🤞🏽💪🏽❤‍🔥
boy got stomped out to!
Dumb libtards
Looks so fake.
No this is not is a secret
Yes
Clickbait!
Another democrat, shocking
I figured mixed martial arts were part of Dave's game
A great year for people who like seeing comedians being slapped
😶.
Great tackle!!!  That guy got that Chappelle punk.  Maybe he was sick of him yelling N all the time.
Dave didn't even hit the ground
Dave is a genius. A confused genius. For that I blame his wife but with one of his race it would have been worse
Now people are trying to tie it all together.  Will smith has nothing to do with this. Stop reaching.   Shout out to Jamie Foxx for jumping in though!
Chris Rock : " Was that Will Smith?" 😂🤣
Ahahaha hahahahahaha was that Will Smith. Chris Rock is hilarious
Blame Will Smith for this.
No footage ??? 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Look @ LeBomb. Zitting @ home in LA for the playoffs. Really? Operation exodus OH?
Gotta Stay positive Vibes And Manifest. Thats the problem with people they don't ask its sad people block their blessings being negative when you can collaborate with the king of the universe we all can God loves everybody ask and you shall receive,work towards it but keep god first and let go and keep asking and you'll get it like  it worked for me many times blessings💯🙏🏾💜☮✝️
Oh look a THEY attacked Dave.
Imagine if joe Rogan was up there with him. someone would have a serious concussion
A generation of kids acting like children, offended by words and unable to separate comedy from realism. What a sad thing it is to know, that the mentality of certain people have diminished over the years, and the sense of commonsense has disappeared from the nature of our humanity.
This is what happens when you don't move to a blue state like Hollywood when you are one of the top 10 funniest people on Earth in English
I heard it was Will Smith cousin
.
You cannot be funny in 2022
Thanks will smith
If it's OK to respond to a joke with a punch, then it's OK to respond to a punch with 40 punches.
First Chris now my boy Dave who's next eddie griffin, Bill burr, Kevin hart what all comedians ect. Jesus we thought this year was gonna be any better
Yes!
The attacker got the bejesus deservingly stomped out of him 😂 His ride home was an ambulance.  Hope his injuries are lasting so it’s a reminder of how foolish an endeavor it is to try and silence someone.  Funny, this network isn’t mentioning that.  Wonder why?
A man? It was a woman pretending to be a man.
Look what you did Will
Attackling
Where is security, this is really bad
Why every news station keeps pointing  out "is that will smith"? Lol like we get it already...every news station  said the same shyt.... wtf humiliation  ritual?
Why that bytch sounds like that lol
Imagine if this was a social media platform: Instead of the attacker being caught, the company who rented the stage would be blamed... not for the attack of course, but for allowing a comedian to use it to make an offensive joke, intermediary liability. Thankfully it's just real life: You can only physically injure a person or put their life in danger which is no big deal, nothing as bad as words you can choose not to see or listen to!
Will be the highest viewed netflix special if they release it unedited.
This is becoming a trend. Maybe a meant-setup new trick to boost comedians popularity?
Wasn't the dude trans? I heard some people say the attacker was
Will Smith? I heard that was Amber.
Clickbait, too bad dislike button doesn't work because google is a communist
It was Will Smith🤣
I blame Will Smith
Are you happy now Will Smith?
the irony that the attacker is the one hospitalized. Call an ambulance memes intensified
Now whites thinking they can do this to all comedians.
thanks Will Smith...
It has begun
Thanks will smith for a great example.
Chapelle is built is a brick wall lmao. The guy that tackle got his arm broken while dave just laugh it off.
If I was Will Smith I would retire, live near the beach somewhere far away with a 'new' cutie and a dog.
and the video of the attack?, lame reporting
Nice thumbnail
way to show the actual footage.
First it was Chris Rock and now him
Thank god Dave Chapelle is alright. He way too valuble to society. We lost too many greats. Glad we still got him.
Will set a good example. And I don't want to hear you describe what happened, show it!
What is the identity of the attacker? White guy? Hate crime?
You guys didn’t even show the footage of him getting tackled smh
"It was a Trans-man"        -Dave the 🐐 Chappele
I'm glad he is ok. Damn.
What is happening to humans?
Down voted your coverage. I logged on to see what happened and you didn't actually show what happened. Pathetic. And will never watch your news channel again  Edit:. You even had your lame anchor relay  Chris Rock's joke instead of showing footage of Chris Rock saying it. Your news coverage is a joke
Was it will?😂
So did Will Smith started a trend I'm just saying
It's the Will Smith effect.  Thanks to him, it's ok for spectators to rush the stage and attack comedians. Good example you've set, Fresh Prince.
Dems have lost their sense of humor, and their minds.  Geeez
You get a dislike for not showing footage
The Will Smith effect
No video of the attack? What a ripoff
It wasn't Will Smith, but they beat that guy like it was!
I think by Will Smith going on stage and slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars, set an unprecedent for people to think is ok to attack a performer if we don't like him or her or we don't like what they say.... We have a LOT of "monkey see, monkey do" in this country.
I can't believe security measures are so relaxed with this kind of events! I worked security for music concerts and these were just local rappers but the security was very tight. The last concert i worked back in 2007, I was working with 9 more guys and we surrounded the stage, and nobody but the performers were allowed on staged and the few times that the fans tried to get on staged to hug the performer, they were stopped before they put one foot on staged. And I would think that for an event like Hollywood Ball the security would be very strict....
Well kiss my chitlins!
Was that Will Smith?
I blame Will Smith
Click bait.  If you can’t show what happened why even post this?  3rd-rate local news.  Smh.
Was Will Smith there?
Check out the TMZ channel video. You'll see it all. This channel is worthless.
An accident because he was trying to be tough for his family he became one of the most ridiculous memes in history
If i could run up on stage and slap any comedian I wanted to, It would be Joe Biden.
Until Will Smith gives back his Oscar and gets cancelled then there's really no accountability to one person's crime. The Oscars ban is not enough. He disgraced not just the academy but the whole world watching. He assaulted Chris Rock and that's a crime. Now even Chapelle has to endure this stupid chain reaction and it seems it's only among black comedians. I'm really angry 😡 at THIS!
I Saw the picture of the guy after, hes arm was bend like a bad spoon in stone cold icecream.
So bringing up/bringing back Will Smith into the equation was considered to be a  “Levity” inducing moment… according to this news station & it’s on-air personality.. … ? Wha-huh?
You can add this to your tarnished legacy, Will Smith.   You just opened a Pandoras box...fortunately, it wasn't worse.
Watch out everybody, joke incoming!!!
Good job showing what happened!!
Thanks to Will Smith.
Look what Will Smith start
Thank you F.🤴 Will Smith
WTF?
Haha😂
stupid.. didnt even show the clip. terrible news station
Its getting out of hand.  🙄🙄🙄
Weakest tackle I've ever seen lmao
Was that will smith
Thanks for showing the actual footage of Dave getting attacked
I heard Dave paid the guy to do this
You can thanks Will Smith for starting the new trend
Society is falling apart.
There is something strange going on, first will Smith and rock, now Chappelle. Who's the next black man to get attacked next? Kevin hart?
I thought Will Smith was in India.
Why would you not show the footage
How come we don’t get to see the face of the attacker?  Let me therefore make a guess—black face.  It’s just as simple as that.
Yep, this is what the liberals have done to this country.  They're trying desperately to destroy it.
Did the audience give the attacker a standing ovation after the attack was over?
Great job Will Smith and to all those that gave him a standing ovation.  Every action has a reaction.
Comedy is dead,thanks Will and our current culture.
CLICK BAIT!
They didn't even mention Chappelle's hilarious reaction. He said moments after "that was a trans man" lmaoo
Thanks Will Smith
Rock is about to get slapped again 💀💀
Ahh, the loving tolerant trans community.
This is the way of the Left. Words = Violence, and therefore can be defended against with more violence.
Happened to Jim Jeffries a few years ago except he got punched in the face. I guess it wasn't that important then
Comedians need guns. Against fans and other comedians apparently.
How come  this guy was  thrown out and arrested when Will Smith walked away with nothing. Oh, that’s right “RICH LIVES MATTER”  Btw, if the guy had a gun he did not shoot him because he did not want to.  You can thank SMITH for Making this cool.
COMO está el enfermero metal en los Estados TODOS Juntos de América 👎👎👎👎👎👎... Horrible... Para allá ni regalado.
Look what Will has started 😩
This video shows nothing. Really need youtube dislikes back...
You didn’t show the tackle???
Free speech is under attack. Comedians getting physically attacked live on air 🤦🏾‍♂️
Will Smith started it
Thank Will Smith for setting that precedent
You people have some nerve using stock footage that doesn't include the incident in your thumbnail. Click baiting morons.
No video here f you
all credits goes to Will Smith ! without him all of this wasn't possible 😂😂
I blame will smith
*Will Smith wont be remembered for winning an Oscar, he'll be remembered as the one who pave way for physically assaulting comedians on stage.*
blax
I think Will Smith had a costume on...
Will Smith career unfortunately gets another hit. He is now at the mercy of crazy people attacking performers. He literally slapped his career away.
Will Smith at it again
You need to throw the book at these people hard. Have to make an example or this will happen more and more.
REeeeeeeee !
Why do these people even come to these shows?
Is this breaking news though??
Gio the queen :)
How are people mad when dave chappelle makes fun of himself and his own culture/race. If you dont like the content dont watch it. Why ruin it for NORMAL people that enjoy it
not chapelle 😞😞😞
Just stfu and show the video
Thanks will for making this seem normal. He should be in jail
This is what happens when you say words are violence.
And so, it begins....thanks Will Smith. 😒
He pulled a smith
National news 🤣🤣
There has been wackos long before Will Smith and his recent fiasco HOWEVER I do partly agree that certain folks will absolutely jump on board and do some crazy SHAT for the world to see. Chris is suing Will but no one is talking about that!!! It’s smarter to just lawyer up& get you a big bag if you get attacked. Dave could sue whoever was in charge of the event due to premises liability ESPECIALLY if he asked SECURITY to remove this irate idiot. 👌🏽 This is my opinion so don’t come for me in the comments unless you want me to show you WACKO 😆
Fake post no video .. obviously no Journalism degrees on this team.
Will smith set a goofy precedent and now everyone thinks this dumb stuff is okay. Regardless of whether he’s apologized , comedians everywhere are in danger
That was premeditated.
national breaking news murica
Here we go chaos everywhere
First Chris Rock now Dave c'mon man 🤦
Thanks Will Smith.
Um... I think you may have the wrong video edit. Where is the video of Dave Chapelle getting attacked?  Are you sure it wasn't the fan being attacked by security 🤔 🤣
I came for the video not the story, shows failing like Biden’s brain
"Was that Will Smith?" XD
Just put the man down lol we don’t need clowns wasting oxygen
Nigga we want to see it not watch you talk
"Was that Will Smith?" Lol
Thanks Will effing Smith!
Should've closelined him
“Show the police officer where his words hurt you so bad that your only option was to do physical harm”
The Far Left strikes again.
People tryna one up will smith
They fkd him up
This is the country and the culture democrats created
That script reader woman is quite impressed with herself.
I live nearby, and probably would have been there, but I'm sure I could not afford a ticket. So what I'm wondering is: how much did this guy spend and did he go there just to attack Dave? Unless he had free tickets, that's a lot of money, just to attack someone.
Chappelle knows judo 13 weapons.
Will Smith impact
Only a white man would do that
Will Smith in disgise
His security needs to be revamped.  That guy never should've been able to get near him.  I think reason his security was stomping on the guy is because they know they messed up.
Unfortunate!!!!⏰
We are in the grips of dumb people with no social filter.
Coulter's Law.
It must be that new covid variant that causes people to wanna hurt you.
When a comedian is left seriously injured or, god forbid, dead on stage, you can thank Will Smith.
Absolutely embarassing. Losers lime that deserve to be on a black list and refused entry to any venue in the future. Or you know put them in the Looney bin where they belong.
“Man” “was that Will smith” had me dying
Why is everyone smiling
Comedians are dropping like flies these days
Wtg Will Smith now ppl think it's ok to use violence against words
Nice job not showing any footage.
No live footage?
Will has made it dangerous for all comedians, now you're going to have these copy cats who thinks they can also get away with it,
You didn’t show it? How woke do you have to be to not show the tackle? What is that now considered rated “R”
This is bigger than comedy this is going against the left. You go against what the left says this how they react
Thanks a lot Will
Will Smith is to blame for this any future attacks
This is disgusting that the transgender community has to act obnoxious like this and attack a black man while he was working.
It is time for comedians to have armed security while performing on stage.  Sadly......
I guess the alphabet mob is more militant then then we thought...
These Comedians need to to really stop and think. Trans people are literally being killed because of their comments.  These concerts aren't safe. Remember  Las Vegas and  Ariana Grande's concert that resulted in mass shootings.  It's  not Will Smith's fault and it's just a matter of time before they start fighting back and  it won't be funny. He's  being  reckless.
Wow what a useless video, u guys are clowns
He attacked because Dave chappelle just called someone a man lol…it was a gendered term Dave used and it enraged the genderless thing and it attacked
I am not surprised one bit . if so much attention had not been paid to what happened at the Oscars, this would have not continued. It's why we don't write and give certain categories of crime the notoriety they seek. I blame the media for this and I am a Democrat and a minority.
Dave should START CARRYING A DESERT Eagle.
Must be goldberg SPEAR SPEAR MGOD KING SPEAR
People are getting real comfortable and softer by the day smh
Leftists are like rabid dogs.
Some think this is the beginning but no... that's the way it was...
I came here to see the video of the attack imagine my disappointment. 🙄
U did not show the attack. Boo
A lot of conjecture in these comments. From what I can tell, they haven’t disclosed why someone did that and folks are assuming that it was someone who didn’t like a joke. Grow up.
Thanks a lot Will Smith
Show it wtf worse news ever
Lock up that attacker and throw away the key.
amazing that there isnt more of this. love to see the whoop get sacked by a 300lb lez. oh wait that happened last night
The Rainbow Gang will attack anyone who disagrees with them
Will Smith started this
No video at all??? You all suck hardcore!!! Boo!
This is what people saw coming with will smith bs
That wasn’t will that was jada I 🤔
Thanks Obama
shut up shut up shut up just show the video
Good thing Dave isn’t skinny anymore 😂
The precedent has been set by Will
Will smith literally killed comedy
Will Smith needs to be stopped
Tackled? Tackled you say? That was an ATTACK.  I am just surprised that you did not add, "Boys will be boys."
People think they're going to get off punishment like Will Smith was I mean all he got was removed from the Oscars while this guy's probably going to face like 10 years in prison. That's totally fair right? Slap on the wrist for Will Smith 10-year punishment for anybody like me and you? Totally kool. Look forward to more attacks like this when Hollywood celebrities can literally get away with anything.
we should see footage of dave not footage of this dork
I blame will smith
Cant even put it down the race 😂 the woke lot are seething
yay people talking about something in a freaking SHOW where you could actually SHOW the incident. ridiculous.
💩💩💩💩💩
Must’ve been one of Juicy Smooyay’s goons.
you arent liberal if you arent allowing people with different opinion.
Woke cowards.
Oscar's said it's ok to attack people
Can’t help but note, these bozos didn’t show the actual attack.
Double standard! He should have been returned to his seat ,been comforted by Denzel and given a standing ovation. Oh wait. He probably isn’t a rich Hollywood actor.,🤮
Wtf is wrong with people. Need OLD TESTAMENT PUNISHMENT & watch how fast this garbage stops. All of it
Wtf why no footage but act like you did. 🧢
but then a white man  Darrell Lance Abbott, of the band PANTERA gets shot and killed on stage.Hollywood says nothing.
1.7k dislikes lmao
They broke homies arm and nose ! He thought it was a game
Didn’t realize Will Smith was so influential.  🙄  I’m sorry that Chris, Dave and any other comedian or performer now has to worry about this truly disturbing behavior.
Imagine a no good man going to a female comedian show and start a protest cuz she joking about no good men ...that's gonna happen if gay men can go to a show and get mad at someone talking about them f*gg*ts
Worthless video.
Will smith bouta end Chris 😂
Horrible news report could have showed the clip of dave getting tackled 😂
Willlll Smith ! Why so many L’s you ask?
Im sorry , but apart me feel like this was staged...just a bit too ironic
This is all will smith’s fault.
“Island Boy runs into wall-face plants himself”  THATS the headline 🤣🤣🤣
We know who put that 🎯 out🤣🤣
LGBT goon's
I mean if it's any consolation to anyone the guy who done it got messed up pretty badly, I'm talking swollen face, broken arm, trip to the hospital bed kinda badly
😡
Protect Dave at all costs! This is insane
Jamie Foxx and Busta Rhymes got to kick the attacker😅😅
I don't know what the attacker's motive was, but as a born again Christian I support freedom of speech, even if I don't like what is being said, because after they ban any speech of any kind, they then come after the Bible.  John 3:36 “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” (KJV)
I’m glad he’s okay it could of been much worse
Dammit! I was gonna say "was that will smith?" - I guess my thoughts aren't original LOL
They're going to need Praetorian freaking guards ON STAGE because it's Open Season on Comedians all thanks due to a certain Internationally publicized PimpSLAP.....
Thanks will🙋
The guy may had tried to make a name for himself  but only in a mug shot .
Someone needs to put an example for the next person who runs up there again. All comedians should carry a stun gun or a machete
That was my first thought:  "Where is Will Smith?"
Will Smith is to comedians as Donald Trump is to America 💅
Obviously homophobes are bad but you looked for them. You went to work show that obviously wasn't for you. You're the idiot for doing so
Thank the hollywood elite for not doing anything with the Will Smith slap. They set a precedent that if my feelings are hurt violence is ok with ZERO repercussions.
... thanks for the no video on the story 👏 ..
But seriously, was that Will Smith?
That’s will smith fault now people think they can jump on stage to assualt people
No footage ? Why bother
Sounds About Will Smith...🤕
Blame this on will smith, he made it ok to approach.
why didn't show video of the attack? you're a news reporter suppose to show everything now these days, smh
Why are people so shock?????? it's black on black crime no different than what's going on in major cities across the u.s. black lives matter at its finest
Y’all didn’t even show the clip.. click bait
Copy cat woke activism !!!
I hope security mopped the floor with that person.
Will Smith needs to be held to account this is his fault
Kudos to Jamie Fox for running on stage and helping Dave
Anybody running up to attack a comedian should get shot multiple times
People blame guns for innocent deaths, you can blame Will Smith on this and the future ones, all you have do is show these idiots it’s ok to release violence.
Click bait. No video of attack.
It may not have been Will Smith but he caused it.
"It was a trans man" - Dave
Are yall young, sheep, or dumb? People have been doing this for a longgg time. Going backstage, killing their so call "hero" because they were a crazed fan, etc wayyy before the Will Smith debacle. You guys just want someone to blame. Hecklers been around, they threw shoes onstage etc. It's been a thing smh
That’s crazy
No surprise
I heard the attacked got Chris Rock'd.
you failed to include the fact that the assailant was suffering from the rainbow disease
Time to start fuccin up ppl who think they got the right to get on a stage that they ain’t allowed to be on
Lol shame Dave. Big ups for being a hypocrite.
WILL SMITH IS BACK SINCE WHEN LOL
Staged craaap for Netflix
Was that will Smith-chris rock
Thank you Will Smith for introducing a new form of stage violence when you attack a performer because you don't like what he or she says.
If you support these loser nazi liberals, please exit the country immediately.
Comedians are going to need FBI agents for security🤦🏻‍♂️ look what you started Will.
He’s not Chris Rock!
Bro think he will smith 😂
Waiting for when Joe Rogan is attacked
No video of the actual incident here.
Watch everyone blame Will Smith
ALL inspired by Will Smith, he got away with it why not someone else?
I blame will😂
Wow great video!... Not...
show the clip don't just give me the Fan Art version.
Thank Will Smith for making it acceptable to jump comedians when they say something you don't like.
Chris always knows how to bring it back around. 😁
Will Smith has ruined comedy
And then the security beat a few letters off of that alphabet boy.
Wow, Dave!!!!    Thank God you weren't hurt, my friend!   Praying for your safety!
Do your part and vote democrats out nationwide. Some pregnant man decided he needed to attack because he forgot his gender
Will done fkd up the whole thang!!
Thanks Will. These clowns attacking comedians are "wannabe Will Smiths."
Were these the same security guards that allowed Rock to get Slapped
This is all Will Smiths fault
Never did like Dave Chappelle
He said was that will smith 🥳🥳🥳🤯🤯🤯😭😭😭😭🥵😱🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂 bruh I die wen I heard that
Thanks Will Smith
Next Netflix special gone be funny when he talks about it
Will is setting all the wrong trends
Why didn’t they mention that they guy had a gun that attacked him.
Chris Rock..."Was the attacker Will Smith" ?... simple yet brilliant 🤣
This video was pointless shows nothing
I blame Will Smith for this behavior
Comedians about to start carrying guns on stage, now people gonna be dying laughing fr smh,,, dammitt Will 😮
The attacker shouted: "Keep the word 'trans' out of your f*ckin' mouth!" 😆
I love how people say this will fault niggas been running up on stage for years XXX foolio alot of niggas got punched on stage before will and Chris
Wth....I better get my Chapelle tickets now....MD❣
Love how the media lies about literally everything. Even when it’s on film. Running into someone and falling over is “tackling them to the ground” I’ve yet to see Chappell on the ground. Looks like dude ended up on the ground.
Now there’s going to be security all over the stage and it will take away from the stand up act
Because Will Smith did not get arrested in made an example out of y'all see it already started comedians are going to be under attack people feel like they can do stuff to them no longer safe for them
Congratulations Simp Will Smith …Look at what you started .
Wow. I guess people really can’t take a joke anymore.
Sk!nheads and ne0-n@zis and YT Supremeies are not "the greatest threat to the nation" as the creepy maroon in chief says. The greatest threat to the nation is clearly  THE WOKE PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT TOTALITARIAN FASCIST MOB!
To anyone who didn't recognize the attack on comedy that Will Smith launched, you are a fool.
It will all calm down when one of these guys get shot b4 they make it to the stage
My dad: Take a joke and laugh with people (circa 2006)  Now: 🤲
Dave: That was a trans man! 😂😂😂
So, the security teams at Chappelle shows will screen audience members for phones (sometimes) but not for deadly weapons?? Interesting.
The difference between this and the Will Smith slap is that Chappelle is responsible for provoking with intentional HATE SPEECH. The fact that he has been supported while fiercely attacking the trans community has been traumatic.  Violence is never the answer, but as a trans person, having suffered the consequences of Chappelle's vile word vomit, I'm not sad that he is receiving the ugliness he has sowed. Stir hate and you will receive hate. I promise, this attack does not make trans people sad....BECAUSE HE THEN JOKED IT WAS A TRANS MAN! We're not the ones getting violent and he STILL dogs us!!! If Chappelle never performed again, we would REJOICE! TO HELL WITH CHAPPELLE. We have enough hate coming at us. I'm so tired of Chappelle taking about race when he's a homophobe/transphobe...you can't talk about justice and equality while destroying another group of marginalized people. That just doesn't make sense. He sure is as much of a genius as any town idiot. Cut his mic, send him to hell and never come back Chappelle. You are detested.  ** if you feel compelled to leave a hateful comment, you should give thought to why you are trying to hurt someone that is already enduring discrimination. You should question what being a good person means. If nothing else - do no harm and that makes you a million times a better person than the weak person trying to get a rise out of someone for kicks.
Patton Oswalt returns trying to backstab Dave literally
Looney left
I remember when if people didn’t like something they just ignored it or tuned out. Now people feel the need to physically confront and attack those they disagree with. What a wonderful world technology has created. Smh
The fresh Prince has opened the door for wackos and crazy people who don't know how to stay in their place. The spotlight is on us when we have the microphone so sit back and listen
Will Smith has started a trend.  Pity people cannot take a joke anymore.
Very worrying
Man listen, Dave is too humble for something like this to happen to him.
Someone tried this on Louis CK when I saw him in 2013. Security got him before I think Louis even noticed. Comedians have gone through this for decades. It’s only being highlighted now.
Was it Will Smith?
Trash channel. Sat here & watched this whole thing & they didn’t even show the attack. Garbage
Where Was Security???
will Smith done started 😂😂😂
Good to see Dave is ok.  Just goes to prove everything he jokes about is true.  Long live Dave Chapelle ❤
Grow up people. You can’t use your fists because you think words are violence. What’s more violent? Words or punches?
Another comedian attacked on stage!!!!! Guess we can thank Wil Smith for this and what attacks are to come.
Had to have been a will smith . Everyone seen this coming . Thanks will .
Things like this will continue to happen unfortunately. We're now in a world where a lot of people think attacking someone is better than civil debate and discourse. Thankfully the attacker didn't get a chance to use the weapons they were carrying
We really live in a world of snowflakes
click baiting wankers.
Why does the description of the video say he was "allegedly" attacked? The video footage was released as soon as it happened lol.
Thanks Will Smith
He’s winning boys, girls and helicopters
We need to just start shooting these WOKE SCUMBAGS!!! Time to take our country back from the Mob
Will smith should be jailed for what trend he started
If you can't handle Comedy then please don't go to a Comedy Club...
Will smith really has people thinking they can run up stage and do whatever until they meet the right one lol
Lol Will Smith will always be a joke now.
Jacey ❤️
Modern Nazism is coming from the left.
Way to not show the tackle?
This is all jadas fault
The Will Smith Effect
Tackled lol that was an attack..
What happened now? People still going crazy in this country? This is the new normal, people.
Not funny
Where was security? It’s time for comedians to be strapped when they are performing, make an example out of one and it will stop.
Will Smith incited this
See what will Smith  punk self started
will smith started the purge
People for ages have insulted others in many forms. Until the world or America refrain from insults don't lay down your guns until they do. Grow tough or change America.
Sadly to say, this is only the beginning. As comedian's all around the world, have to be more aware of these types of situations. Since the flood gates have been left open. For anybody who wants to disagree with a comedian. Thanks to Mr Smith....
Thanks Will Smith 🤣😂
