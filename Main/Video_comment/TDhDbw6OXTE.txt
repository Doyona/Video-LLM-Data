You missed the baguette? You faguette.
7:07 caption said you eat it😂😂
Can I have the beachball?
Herron looks quite different with a mustache. Not bad, just different. It kinda makes him look French.
I thought the pool was unfair but gaunson plsyed it masterfully
My dad is being rude to you guys!!!!!!!!!
Strong
You they can't do this they will be marked buy the government for all eternity
Yate
Ns gaunso treated unfairly
New Gaunson quote for a tshirt: “That thing is Magnussing the house down!” 😂😂😂😂😂 picture of a beach ball and Rexy

gaunson busted on the throwing of the duck!
Rethrow for gaunson
Oh my gosh this chaotic energy is the MOST FUN!!!
10:46 - Breaking Bad vibes lol
I know Im 2 years late but I hope Rexy is holding the umbrella on this one
17:25 The Lion King is my favourite, and Mufasa: The Lion King is my most favouritest of all time. 🦁👑☀️
Absolute dog act 21 seconds after saying 5 weak as
Man thats a high concrete mass lol
If Scott would have done the no countdown on either Heron or Brett, they would’ve pitched a fit about it, especially Heron
11:04 When he yells, "These a bee!!!" You can literally hear the echos.
I'm a little angry 😹
More angles of the girl in the green shorts please
5:38 the perfect edit for this one
I’m sure someone’s said it but boys those are mosquitoes
I love all the boys and the noise they make. N S Gaunso, D. Herron and B. Stanford are all faaaaaaaaabulous. BUT, there is a special place in my heart for Editor Jack. Not only does he have to jump, starfish and bend to the Boy's  commands, he has to piece together ALL the footage from a bazillion Go-Pros, Dennis The Phantom Menace and others, but he is also called upon to drop stuff, clean up stuff and provide Scientifically Accurate  pronouncements when The Lads ask those delicate questions. How many javelins make a torrent, what is the square root of a bowling ball and why does N S Gaunso provide such curly questions?  In my mind, Editor Jack deserves a medallion of honour, for his ability to descramble the ludickerous amount of footage the Lads generate and to make a coherent program that I am thirsty to watch. What sort of Alien is he? How many brains does he have, operating in synchronicity to reach the pinnacle of production values this show has?  I love you all but Jack has made you. ❤🐪🐧🇦🇺❤️🤣🤣🤣🇩🇰🇦🇺🎉🙏
I can't believe how skilful Mr Derek Herron is. He has done so well in this first round.
0:22 can you last long day whatever time works countdown soccer
Scott got shafted
1:41 lol penis
you gotta admit brett gave 110% lol that left handed catch was pretty damn good
Awesome vids! 👌  I started a vr channel. Hope mine gets better..lol. love ya guys, Shawn here from Vancouver Canada 🇨🇦 ❤
You should have counted to five
4:19 a mosquito
17:25 I love the lion king
What is in that building anyway?
😡
Is this supposed to be a spring edition?
SPONGEBOB?
Tie a small weight of some kind to the handle of the umbrella
16:24 did bro say the n word? 😭
What about the car is it going over🤔🤔🤔🤨🤨🤨🤨🧐🧐🧐🧐 0:08 0:08 0:08 0:08,
I love Scott’s reaction to Brett’s suggestion of catching Sponge Bob in the mouth. Classic shocked head movement.
All my swiss people and people who live in Switzerland like here [suscht bringts 13 Jahr Unglück fuer dich und dini familie! >:( ]
As l' m a muslim,you have disappointed me ,boys
What are you doing sponge 17:49
16:23 I’m sorry what 😂😂
I feel like they are hard on gaunson in this one, "if even a sliver of the pool touches the ground, not a catch!" but the Herron caught it off the cliff? And the whole soccerball thing was stupid too.
Use the giant beach ball, hold it, and one of you can get up there and get the umbrella
That mustache is absolutely horrid. Scared my child.
I know it was two years ago. still, gotta say that if you had waited 16 full seconds after calling out a 321 to throw the boys would have eaten you alive for it. saying 5 seconds and waiting 21 is bad sportsmanship
I’m getting angry 10:32
Scott WAS treated unfairly, but wow, Stanford came through with some full body play and I think he paid for his crime of a failed count. This is one of my favorite vids you guys done. Thanks! (44 all the way!)
Gaunson was robbed
Pool had contact… no point!
These Guys are so childish....what they do is funny, but there jokes are sucking !!
Pinki from sprunki??????💀💀💀💀💀10:45
Pinki from sprunki???? 10:45
How ridiculous 😂
You should've put Rexy on the handle of the umbrella ;)
That's soon nice
gaunson deserved a 6 after that outrageous throw
At least one hasn’t had balls drop yet. Screaming like girls odd.
Jesus!
6:08
2:03 😅
Rubber ducky you're the one
I'm all for repairing inflatables rather than throwing them away, but great video, fun😊
That LLama looked lilke a .......
That was so rich😂😂😂
Small catapult for the top of the dam.
New challenge. Use blow up pool. Send pool down 3 times . Each guy gets so many throws, and you pick the items to try to get in the the pool to see who gets there pool down 1 than each item gets points.
Were is this location?
Gravity is so much fun!  Thanks for the Video!
17:44 Sandy: Hey SpongeBob! Look at us! We’re skydiving, and we’re gonna land on that target right below us! :)  SpongeBob: THIS SEEMS KINDA DANGEROUS!!!!! :(
Gaunso pulling out the raygun catch in the slow mo with pinky 🤣🤣
Etqel
Watching 3 guys running around a field trying to get different types of balls into a paddling pool.....   For some reason it's GREAT   😂🤣😂🤣
For just $1 a day you can help fight to end the severe abuse of rexy  😂😂
At 4:25 I thought yall in Australia have mosquitoes
Herron got hosed on the umbrella
😮.    Tnt
Stanfords tennis ball catch was incredible.  🎊🎉🥳🥳🥳'

omg how🤨
One handed catch with the tenni' was madness. Good job
'The Umbrella Climb' (2:40) certainly a down sloped one, 'onsight', under those (incredibly fun) conditions almost doable... .
The swimming pool 100% touched the ground

So raycon just copied skull candy 😂😂
You guys are awesome.  You sure know how to have good fun.  Don H   Ocala, Florida   USA
Yep, Gaunson was cheated.  I'm getting my broomstick right now.
The baguette was ny far the hardest one… not fair that inky one guy had to catch it 😂
Awesome catch!!!! One handed at that!!!
Real how ridiculous
Stanford made a great dive for the catch!
It wasn't Heron's fault that he couldn't catch the umbrella !  because it didn't even come down
He sends the umbrella off the dam then Marry Poppins jumps off the dam to get back her umbrella but it's a miss and she falls to her death    R I P Marry Poppins    😞  .   1:56
See who can catch an Anvil
What a great catch with the tennis ball😮
11:03-the attempt 😂😂😂😂😂
21s
Boo Scot
I reyedthediscount code  It appears then dissapears and reverts to full price
Gaunson was robbed.
He got the pink wrinkled teddy, but not the pleasure usually associated with wrinkled teddys.  Different kind of wrinkled teddy I reckon.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I own raycons got tiem as a gift there terrible
❤❤❤😊😊😊HiGm
gosh herron is always soo annoyingly competitive instead of just having fun... I always root for gaunson..
Hey guys is their any odds of me getting a free tank top/ T-Shirt that says fourth four cause I am 44 this year?!
Лучше бы они наковальни ловили. Что это за язык? Говорят как с х@ями во рту
This is an easy one Scott definitely was treated unfairly no one knew he threw the thing that was completely unfair he should have got a second chance at it Brett said five seconds and threw it 21 seconds later there should be zero doubt about it
you have to count down !!!!!!
10:44 PINKY!
16:40 the sponge up next
Did Scott so dirty
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo mn you should make
2:00 the umbrella floats like a parachute
I’m watching this video with raycons on. Lol
16:24 what did he just say?? 🤨
What about catching an anvil?
kopuewiwe
Riding with headphones is stupid dangerous..
I really don’t like their accents
Justice for Gaunson.
HAKUNA MATATA
I have that umbrella 😂😂😂😂😂😂
21 secs i am maadd
17:42 -17:59 is the best part
17:32 xddddddd that was so funny 🤣 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😹😹
Cool a sponsor sharing at least half the group initials well done.
3:27 why is this giving me Earl Devereaux, “FLINT LOCKWOOD!” vibes, but with stiff arms😂
ç  çŕżæ
You could make a 2-hour long video of throwing about 100 large inflatable toys off that dam, 1 and 2 at a time.  We’d watch it all. 😂
Throw some American footballs off the dam.  You have to throw “spirals”, though.  Can you catch them?  How about frisbee’s?  Boomerang?  Styrofoam delta-wing glider?  Smoke bombs?  The smoke trails should give an idea of wind currents next to the dam?  Or streamers.  Drop/throw them from several points across the span of the dam.  A flying squirrel!  Although, I’m sure a flying squirrel would land safely, you might have to throw toy ones. A rubber snake. R/C delta-wing gliders.  Cheap ones.  Make them dive straight down and try to have them pull out of the dive as low as possible without hitting the ground.  This episode reminded me of a game show parody titled, “Catch It and You Keep It.” 😂.  They would drop valuable prizes and whichever contestants could catch it, got to keep the prize.  Which was great until they threw a brand new sofa. 😂
10:51 Gaunson said "come to daddy." Got me howling😂😂😂😂!!!!!!!!
21s
8:29 yo who farted
The beach ball that's some funny shit
1:41 - What does that look like to you?
You guys are the best YouTubers ever
You guys did way better than I thought you would.
Derek heron is Luigi from mario bros
5:22 crazy psycho Herron...the ball's reflecting in both eyes!!
Chuck a water bottle inside sponge bob - - Hahahahaha!
Well horse flys on that count down
That’s a Horsefly Herron
7:10 "Any requests on how I throw this thing?" "YEEt It"
He tooted haha
Fuck me every time the camera switches to the vertical view my stomach drops
I have an idea for a video, What takes the LONGEST to drop to the bottom?
Agreed
at 16:25 did he say this sniga
That volleyball catch catcher was phenomenal 🏐
17:31 i remember choking laughing.
Everything else had a countdown - so yeah that should have been a redo.
1/13/24 Texas how good
That was a llama? Looked a bit falic.
Itsfootball
14:15 👍
next time spin the umbrella
8:31 It definitely grazed the grass, but to dock points for that would be unfair considering the other objects all being small enough. He had to impromptu-roll up an entire TP roll, and now he had to catch the entire inflatable swimming pool by himself without anything hitting the ground? I don't think so. 10:29 Consider me mad. I'm not good at maths, but if there's one solitary thing I know, it's that 21 is not 5. 12:04 Nah, after the football incident, you already deserve to lose. 14:05 I thought the deal was "if I went the beach ball now, and I dropped it.." 12:51 Meaning he would only benefit of the deal if he didn't catch the beach ball. But apparently he didn't even know what his deal was, so he want after it.
8:01 The intrusive thoughts in my head want to know if I can like spread out in that, and basically use it as a parachute. Like grabbing it with hands and feet. Just lodged inside.
redo the soccer ball!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That roll of TP was *_majestic!_* Then, the *shadow* of it, to top it off... 😚👌 If Stanford _had_ peeled it as he wanted to, he would've been the architect of it, and able to take credit for it. 😊
I can't stand the voice of the guy they call Gawnson
My biggest regret as an American is that we don't have any cool little phrases for like our sports chatter.  I would love to be able to see a poor throw from a quarterback in the NFL and when the reciever just misses the catch I would say "ohh he's asked an awful lot of that one, eh?'       "one" meaning the pass.   We just scream and yell "CATCH THE FLIPPING BALL"    but we are so crass we don't say flipping, we say "CATCH THE F*CKING BALL"        I notice when I watch soccer how much I just love the little phrase work that happens after someone attempts a shot from outside of the box..... "Well that really never stood much of a chance to sip some tea"   or whatever......    but dammit, I hope over time we just develop some phrases like that here.
5:21 Wilson gave him some googly eyes lol
Soccer ball needs retry
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
Can we give double points to the beach ball for catching him? XD
8:34 Definitely hit the turf.
This has to be the most appropriately named YouTube channel.🤣🤣
If you see bugs and if your in Australia: welcome to Australia mate
Boys justifying use of walkie talkies in adulthood.  Love it!
That did not look like a lama!!!!
When you said everything’s going over the edge I look at the car
Can always count on Herron in a catching game
Where was the count down for n.s ganso I love your videos by the way I would love to be in one
Another brilliant video 🙂 Sorry to say this Stanford but that was hilarious with that beach ball 😂 A brilliant catch with the tennis ball 🙂
That toilet paper was weirdly mesmerizing 😂
Scott should get a redo with the soccer ball
I cleary saw the ball launch of your blind eyes did not see it.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
One bundle of poo tickets 😂😂😂
Left handed catch of the tennis ball was sweet!!
Gaunson was cheated with the soccer ball 😂
Dhoom3 movie shoting 🎥
G man was robbed by Stanfords 21s wait. But Herron was robbed by the dam building.
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮!!!!!!!!!😂❤🎉😢😮😅😊
❤❤❤
Rtxb
Garson has the skill to be a wide receiver in American Football!
A year after this came out I just need to get my two cents in 😂 that soccer ball throw was definitely fudged. Even if he did say coming down in 5 sec he went way over that so his “count down” wasn’t even correct. He threw that ball like a whole ass minute after 🤣
he toched the biig beach ball before it hit the ground
The umbrela is on the top
Harrens farts are top tier moments
2:19  he tooted 😂 but you have to listen closely.
1:49 that laught but Gaunson was such a “Put that in ur pipe and smoke it” laugh
Team Gaunson!
90 min
2:16: IM MARY POPPINS YALL
Was scammed on the footfball
Gaunsons fault for not paying attention
I a Duck
110$ aint affordable haha
16:25 what did you say gaunson?
Gaunson was gonna have no way of catching the soccer ball and even if he did have a countdown he wouldn’t of caught it so even though he didn’t have a countdown he doesn’t deserve the point
“The hills are alive with the sound of Gaunson”
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Awaaz
He threw in 21 seconds
As an Aussie i can confirm this is how we talk
It's been 1 year now
Im just praying that gaunson gets nailed at top speed by the beach ball
"llama" 🫣
Can I have the teddy?

Never gonna give you never gonna let you down never gonna run around and desert you

Their always catching balls;)
i wanna see this with an umbrella with weights
That was one seriously shady competition... that was funny as hell.😂😂😂
the bob did not get catched

c trop satisfaisant
You forgot the Fosters with the popcorn
I think it would have been interesting if you had sharpened the point on the umbrella and put a few ounces on it. You know just to trip him up a little and make it interesting.
I'm wearing ray cones right now.
Нет в Австралии плотины высотой 165 метров.
I found this channel the most absurd way. I was at a car shop and it was on the tv lol
At a point there's a bug on one of these guys and I couldn't help but say out loud you're from Australia and you're worried about a bug from Switzerland.
On the umbrella, he should've climbed up and grabbed the umbrella and still claimed it as a win, because it technically didn't touch the ground 😂😁😂
To-die is going to be a grey-et die
the pool hit the grass
Should have made the tie breaker the orange soccar ball and it would need to be caught to count.
Gaunson was treated unfairly.
Wow amazing video nice 👍🏿🙂
The people who are walking by probably think the Aussies are a load of barmy sods  I mean, that ain't far from the truth
21
13:42 😂😂
fantastic upload you guys crack me up since iv been trying to watch you great show many thanks
At the Swiss dam, sometimes the ball catches you.
I swear to god if these guys were American I 10000% would not watch these guys.   When I tell you I watch them EVERY SINGLE DAY. . I mean it. And I HATE videos like these. But they make it so good
Was the baguette fresh or stale....thinking velocity would be different
Nobody got pinned
Scott it was 21 seconds on the soccer ball
There was no countdown but that was actually exactly five seconds.
yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Drop the Ram Rod (GOD Rod built by Aries)  a hollow cylinder with a internal hourglass figure to compress the air (compressing air heats it) through the force of gravity which will accelerate it causing it to compress more air causing it to accelerate more which will cause it to compress air faster making it accelerate faster which will cause it to accelerate faster which will delete your channel........RAM ROD  RAM ROD RAM ROD .......At least try it one time make sure its a live stream with lot of remote drone footage........IT NOT NUCLEAR......but it will delete your channel in a flash........Try rifling the internal hourglass and put spiralling tail fins to help............Think How ridiculous it will be to live steam your deletion........RAM ROD RAM ROD...........
I love you guys make these videos
That was no victor in this one........ Neither caught the "RexyBall"!!! So........ No Victor!!!
I love Gaunson's HR shirt!  That's one I would have bought.
dang nice one hand tennis ball grab
Where is this place located? It's beautiful!

Herron looks like Michael McIntyre on a 6day bender.
Sol costal makes a 12 ft beach ball which may be worth a look at.  Maybe part of a sumo challenge
THANK YOU
Both lost the sudden death. No catch before it touched down on the ground.
I would say he got his beach ball
You guys should parachute jump form that dam to see what it feels like.
he was robed
Sponge 🧽Bob Square ⬛pants
Lammaaaaaa oooooohh
Even though I know they’re in a giant space, when ever they’re at this dam I have an overwhelming sense of anxiety thinking they’re going to run into the sides of the cliff or right into the dam it self. I always feel like they’re 3 steps from face planting one of the faces
Can you try catching the anvil same way?
This was your best program yet.
🤦‍♂️🤣🤣🤣
Too bad Herron didn't OPEN that bag of popcorn!
привет русским
8:(five)0; that pool touched the ground. Also, unrelated, my five key does not work right now. Currently trying to crack hack this delima.
??? 745m
I think moreso the ball caught Stanford rather than the right way around.
Where Im from (and also possibly in some part(s) of the inner cities of New York or New Jersey, where half of the dialect of where Im from comes from) youd say a person "aint got no hands" on a day when they fail to catch something. Today, Heron really, really had hands.
It’s called a mosquito
changing the rules mid game sucks
Nosa de alto 😱😱😱😱😱😱
Before I watch this... no you can't watch that mf.. tf. I hope I do watch 1 of u try to tho! Talk about content 😂🤣😂🤣
Can't get enough of these videos
I just found your channel yesterday and I've been crying laughing while binge watching! You guys are absolutely hysterical!🤣😍🤣
Man the footage of you guys when its looking down the dam make my hands really sweaty 😂
Gaunson gets the raw end yet again...
Herron at 02:18 ... "Ooh... I tooted".
PIETRO GUSTAVO DE OLIVEIRA AGUIAR
I need to see Rexy flying a small paraglider.... That'd be possible surely....
Guys start making parachutes for things! You could keep score of how slow you can get things to fall... The anvil would be great on a parachute!
You guys need to put a small weight (sand filled Rexy) on the umbrella! That would clearly fly far and away!!!
Much fun on this video
L
Türkümmm
True but after the five seconds were up he should have been paying attention and waiting for the throw. If he would have been paying attention he would have gotten to it in time. But I guess that's karma considering the fact that he made heron run towards the dam for that rubber duck.
That one handed tennis ball catch was impressive
6:08
throwing toilet paper off a dam and seeing it unravel was cool
1:11 I bet that felt amazing!
He needs to play for nfl 😅
Wooooooow !!
2:45 - Y’all are making me hungry.

How is there absolutely no wind up there...
That was not a win it touched the ground do over
living down stream from a dam must be scary. Humans arn't perfect and materials degrade over time. just a thought.
I hope everyone is having a wonderful day
Who says Aussie Rules is good for nothing!
What if dams get open without any warning 😅😅
They should have one of those Life like dolls filled with fake blood and bone struckture. tape it to the pool and throw it to figure out if a human would survive that

I always cheer for my boy Gaunson
LMAO as a former kick & punt returner in high school this would be very easy for me great video btw
Hi where did you buy that big Ball??? Can you Post a link? Please
How do you remember which direction the sun rises in?      Eventually, it’ll dawn on you.
Should have put the raycons thru the ringer and tes the durability with a few drops
You guys screwed Gaunson over on that soccer ball and you know it. He won period.
drop a car 😅
Ok ,you guys made me laugh , that’s pretty good!
That’s ridicules .
10:30 I believe a redo is in order. Both parties were at fault.
16:24 ..... that is all
THE HAKUNA Helped Brett!!
I've always wondered how they get permission to throw stuff off this dam do they pay for it or what
Where is this dam?
Wait but did he not know what a mosquito was 😅
You should've put rexy on the umbrella
Who can throw the farthest lawn dart off the dam
the pool so tuched grownd heron what are talking about it so hit the ground and stanford you are the best
Scott was treated unfairly. A countdown needs to have counting involved, otherwise it's a casual/sloppy warning
6:07 glider deployed
I feel like standford got the short end of the drops. I mean 3 of the 6 items dropped quick. Actually more like 4. One was giant and just went everywhere, and the other 2 got mostly slow falling stable drops.
Can we get a BALLISTIC gel body and head with skeleton and organ thrown from the dam
Scott was ROBBED!
I love how this guys just throw random shit at other shit
2:18 bahahahaaa
That pool totally hit! Good on ya bois for giving him the point anyway!
See who can fly in a pool off of the dam the farthest.
Lawn darts
I think they should all caught the same thing it would have been Fair
Thanks Boys, From now on in my house Bog Roll is known as "Poo Tickets"
You need to catch it
Drop a babydoll on its head
I think Gaunson got robbed. If the throw was exactly 5 seconds after the "countdown" then fair but it wasn't even close. Easy to get distracted when you don't know when it will be thrown.
wasn't paying attention there, idk.
You need to do a verbal countdown.  Do over...
Bro
So totally cool and awesomeness excellent and totally cool dood
You guys should do a "basketball-like" game in which the hoop is a falling swimming pool
G’DAY MATE!!!!!!
The pool hit the turf. You can see in the replays that it hits and drag on the grass a second or two.
Yea
Next time catch a bowling ball
Lol, the squeaky duck made my dog freak out
They should’ve given gaunson  another go
Surprised they've never parachuted or wing suit off of it.
6:40 paper toilet
1:21 - 1:37 first time i watched it i literely siad, and i quote "GO KUZCO!"
Gaunson was treated unfairly
The Llama looked like a weird misshapen wiener lol
I want to know what those bugs are. I've never seen them before.
Gaunson got screwed in this event
Boo… Yes it’s a G fan. 😂
6:21 lmaoo
preview of 17.55-18.05 on timeline is huge but epic spoiler to deal
Throw a car from damp
Can I see a vid of you shooting arrows down the dam at a target? There might be two records in it as well. Fastest arrow shot, and maybe the longest distant shot. Maybe trying with slingshots.
16:41 Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?
Would it kill you if someone thrown a hard basketball down there and hit your head?
The bug thing is called bremse btw im from austria
Where is this dam that they film at?
Catching an paper aeroplane will be damn tough!!
They are living our dreams..🤣
😡😡😡😡😡😡 I am angry
How fun!
Coba dong salah satu dari kalian lompat menggunakan parasut

16:17 16:19 16:21
3:32 REXI
Why is it so enjoyable watching three guys throw various objects off of a dam?
The pool reminded me of that scene in Indiana Jones when they went out of a play in a raft.
Rexercise ball!
I’m thinking 3.22sec. Not 5 whatcha think?
The soccer throw was BS for sure
Just for a laugh i would of said ok ok you want a deal ... fine, for 50 points im sending over an Anvil in 3 ..... 2 ..... 1...... pmsl 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Okay the amount of times i think of something seconds before Brett says it is so God damn weird
Spongebob: I believe I can fly...
Them: Everything is going over, even the umbrella! Me: aww man, everything but you guys
I'd almost like to see you guys do a Mythbusters, by taping an umbrella to a dummy or a mannequin's hand and throwing it off the dam to see if it floats or just drops like a stone with bit of a gruesome death when it hits the valley floor
The umbrella gave them an unfair advantage (and allowed for more drama) because it was basically a parachute. It should have been dropped so that it could pop open as it fell, maybe give the person on the ground something to think about...
21
16:24  what did you say
44 club🤙🤙🤙
Yet every item falls at 9.8m/s
10:44 PINKY
i still remember when they used to do this
There like dude prefect but Australian 🦘
Guns and definitely got anymore and of that soccer ball they will pull up the edge they will fly off the edge they they will throw the soccer ball over the edge
So in the span of a few years, these lads went from chasing things all over the show to just calmly fielding fair catches. You love to see a skill bar get filled up, boys!
Those pools are TRASH. Ours got a hole day one. XD
They sound british
I'm with gaunson
21s is bull
Your frequent flyer miles must be huge!
Are you there in Southtirol?
Herron looked like Cameron Munster when he was catching those
aussie dude perfect, i love it.
Scott was treated unfairly. Stanford promised 5 seconds but took 21; it was a falsie.
44.
They are just Australian lads having a ball
U guys should throw paper airplanes
Catch the anvil 😂
🤯😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡👹👹👿👿👿👿👿👿😾😾😾🙊🙊🙍‍♀️
Bowling ball is next!
Imagine watching a movie on the side of that thing
“You silly little bear”
“Gaunson there’s a bee!!”
WOAH  that was insane!!!!!!!!!
?
The car is going over the edge
it was 12 seconds after he said coming in 5 seconds lol
Yall need to do a giant paper plane off of a mountain into the ocean.

13 seconds
A
Is the accent NZ or AUS? It's had to pick as there is no Fish & Chips to hear the Sssss
You guys are from Australia! How are those little bugs from Switzerland getting the better of you??
You guys should test homemade parachutes with the crash test dummy off the dam.
44 here I am... Silly fun video!!! 20 min of my life gone... but well spent
Bro has never seen a mosquito before
You should of done a bolling ball
i need to remember the TP being called poo tickets the next time my wife asks me to grab a few rolls from the basement... yup, I will grab some "poo tickets".. 😂
"Oh I tooted!!" just farting in front of millions!! I love it
This is so stupid, I wish I had brothers! Mindless and I love it. Cheers boys!
should've thrown a bowling ball
I wanna see you guys try to catch an egg
PT? PT on the ground?
The fact I haven't heard a single c work Otta these folks is impressive
The NFL needs to sign yall ASAP!
Drop a car from that dam.
why dont you guys test it first, last guy had way more difficult things
Should have gotten a 2nd chance with the soccer ball definitely got should have gotten a countdown
I always root for Heron the Hero
didn’t they say that the last item is 2 points but Gaunsons bear was only one
Pause at 5:22
What about your self?!?!?
New challenge for ya! See who can get the most eggs in the pool on its way down
don't know the first guy's name... but it's honestly hard to overlook the fact that as dweeby as i thought he seemed... he's actually got raw athleticism.. each and every single item...took some measure of physical talent to accomplish.  i'm impressed and i think that this grading system didn't do him justice.
Soccer ball deserved a rethrow
Beach ball deserves a point for catching an entire person!
So that was a Rexercise ball...
I definitely think Gaunson should have gotten a redo on the soccer ball.
Sponsor doesn't ship to Australia...
My Gaunson stepped on a bee 😭
I can't help but laugh when the AUSTRALIANS come to Switzerland and ate complaining about the bugs😁
They didn’t píxeled the license plate 🥴
Lol my friend had a giant beachball just like that one stolen from her backyard about 2 weeks ago.
Thanks YouTube for 10 seconds skipping option
I wish you all would strap in to safety line for the big throws. Always makes me worry
Are you lot not allowed to say the word fuck.... Who says flip me??? Ask other Australians say cunt fuck but you guys don't say anything why
Thats was some bs mate. No countdown and that ridiculous throw. Not impressed
"Everything is being thrown from the top the dam"  eh? So nobody else noticed the car up there?
6:03 Great *SCOTT!* ...Gaunson.
Here's a idea: How about throwing off 1 foot square pieces of solid cardboard?  But you have to throw them both like a frisbee and vertically. When those things catch the wind...THEY REALLY FLY! Imagine throwing them off the dam! WOW!
You guys definitely didn't watch Mythbusters if you were expecting that pool to be flipping all over while falling. ;)
Wait they said everything was to over he edge,  why is the car still there. I have been lied to.
6:03
13:40 ,,,It's not him who catches the ball, it's the ball that catches him 🤣
It’s great
Gaunson shouldve lost from the TP and the pool that was a clear touch rules are rules
Gaunson definitely got done dirty with everything about that soccer ball throw. He deserved a rethrow.
you live in Australia and are considered about a few harmless bugs?
The bug that bit you was a swamp fly
Try to catch an anvil next!
Next time Bowling ball, Chain saw and of course a raw Egg :-)  Great job guys!!
44!! Another great one my dudes.
Dont they look like lazarbeam sypher pk and lachlan
That's a dodgy looking llama
Woow that is so funny
Tp not pt
my dream career is now to make millions of dollars for catching bread thrown from 200 meters above me😂😂😂
I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace confusion. And may peace and calmness fill your life. 🤟
Next video idea:  Throwing a dozen toilet paper
Gaunson is the happiest person he is smiling all the time
Should throw eggs off 1 by 1 like 5-10 seconds apart and see how many they can catch 🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚🥚
Harron is the goat🐐🐐🐐
2:18 💩 oow I tooted
2:18 💩 oow I tooted
The idea of the video is great ,but l don’t like throwing a FOOD why? there’s alot of items that you can use and throw it Why FOOD?!!!
James 3:10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. Also Jesus is king God is king
Moustache Herron is a superhero
Gaunson deserves that point!
When you showed items From above the car was standing here like it was supposed to be dropped too🤣
Nice
Looks like they show movies there also
Lol a Lama
Everything attempted to be caught, even the car
That Lana looked kind of weird floating through the sky.
Your telling us because the commentary is great
@4:17 Those bugs that was on your legs and stuff was a Horse-fly they bite and drink blood and they cause a nasty bite too it can swell up like 3-5 inch circular patch around the bite area, Its common around Europe
I'm disappointed you didn't call it the Rex-ercize ball.
Scott was treated unfairly
Rexy should of been inside the pool to see if he could of stayed in it. I think he could of made jt
Scott was done wrong. He didn’t have a chance because silent running wasn’t even yelling for him to hear or have Jack hold down the walk-in button to give a good count. Then you say 5s and it was 4 times that so I call flag on the play.
I’m eating popcorn and they are throwing it me:patting the popcorn saying on no gonna do that to them
These guys have an endless amount of enthusiasm
The 21s wait on the ball throw needs a redo
So when is Scott Gauson going to check on the 1,700 people that agree with him? My bro got cheated out and everyone knows it
Herron friggin got that one man! Great job buddy. And to think about you guys running with a selfie stick and camera, then continue to catch the throws, is absolutely amazing
Wait did he just say the n word 16:20
Just worked a 9 hr shift and I'm so happy to see this upload! you guys are awesome
I’m with you Gaunson, countdown or no, that was completely uncatchable! Till then throws were at least semi reasonable chance of a catch! Smh at you Stanford 🤦‍♂️
That football was uncatchable. Replay the down.
I love how a couple of Australians are freaked out by Swiss bugs🤣
No. I'm jot gonna watch beach ball. That's more ridiculous
Great vid, but I miss the tower!
So ridiculous, but very entertaining!
13:38 hhhhhhhhhhhhh
So, my dog has a little t-rex stuffed toy and he chewed the leg off recently and it gave me a great idea... REXY DOG TOYS! Please consider. I would buy 5.
look how empty that lake is behind the dam
i just subed but i know am not going to get it just want to say
Herron should have used the trampoline to get onto the building!
Have to admit the content over the last several months hasn't been my cuppa tea bit it's great to be back to the decent stuff again.
Asked this before, but never got an answer.  Anyone know why there's no river or reservoir associated with this dam???
AZ.  Xcvy.     What do you want to know  Did we know he But ADE home You're going shift
That'll be bar
I think once Brett said he was dropping it Scott should have been paying attention. But  I will say it was definitely cheeky not to give a full countdown. Also I love Brett's commitment to the giant beach ball and his dive over the ball.
When will you reenact the scene from Indian Jones and The Temple of Doom by floating down in an inflatable boat? ... No, please don't do it!!!
The TP coming undone was pretty satisfying
Best guys I have ever seen ❤️
Stop jerking around and catch a bowling ball. You know it’s what we wanna see.
The left handed stab was brilliant!
Does anyone else think that Scott kinda looks like Chris Martin (Coldplay singer) when he made the Music Video For Yellow?
0:50 bruh I see that fishing line and fishing rod in da back 💀
Let's mix things up and go to the JAVELIN
so like... 100 tp rolls off a 165 foot damn right???!!
Twas a draw in my eyes. Neither caught the final toss, as it landed on the turf. Sure, he got to it first, but it already landed.
15:44 xD i laughed as much as stanford
Its all fake I can see the string. Y'all are bad at faking stuf.
The left handed catch was clutch AF 💪💪🤣
That tennis ball catch was seriously so underrated!! That was ridiculous!
Lol if you do this in the Nederlands you Will be fucked  by mark
Great viddy guys!! Love your stuff, keep it coming!!
The giant beach ball isn't giant
Wanna see how many tires stop a bullet
Guys you're so funny
Awaiting the return of N. S. Gaunso
It’s crazy because the recipe for each of yalls videos is so entertaining and similar to the last in some way but it never fails to entertain and will never get old. As long as you drop stuff on stuff from high places we will watch
Tried to buy the ear buds that sponsored the video-cant get them in Australia. But these blokes are Australian 🤷‍♂️
9:00 thats a football
Can't get up? There's literally a ladder 😂
I love your video so so much
Herron looks like a 70's corn star with that 'stache.
What
I am so mad at him
165m ?
He should have spun the umbrella would have gone down a lot better lol overall great video love you guys hilarious 😆
✨PhIlOsPhY✨😂
My second item is also an item
The bean bag was a graceful floating jellyfish
Thanks guys. After a fairly trying few days it was a great relief to watch. As always, thanks for the laughs, God bless and stay safe.
I like watching y'all throw things off the thing.
Oo tooted
Surprised you haven’t dropped a big pair of scissors on stack of papers and a big rock on the scissors.
Why don't you guys fill the Zorball with watermelons and then drop it?
The way the toilet paper unrolled was pretty neat
Best vid of the year so far I think boys, so many highlights.
Hello, can you throw something on an giant icecube wich is filled compleatly with cottonballs or throw this icecube  on something ?  Greetings from Germany ^^
Did anyone else hear him say “this ni**a” on 16:23😂
your accent is brilliant
As a french people, I feel offended when they threw the precious "baguette" ! But it's still fun to watch XD
favorite 🎉❤
Would of liked to see something put on sponge bob just before the throw like poo or a rock
Very enjoyable to watch.
Well. Take parachute and jump yourself and try to land on some targets. That would be cool... ;)
Question, how do u get down to the bottom of the dam?
What happened to the tower drops? Not allowed to any more?
The Llama had me 😂👊🏻🦙
10:34 i am angry
Sorry guys buy hands before ground he gets the points
If Herron can catch off the rocks, Gaunson can catch if a bit hits the ground
spin the umbrellas
The pool touched the ground a tiny bit, but well done! Gaunson. I did not imagine it would fall straight down.
Can we bring back the tower from the good old days I miss video on it
Heck I never seen him throw it that should be a go for gaunson
Crazy idea get a dummy that weighs as much as one of you 3 and put it in the pool and see if it comes down safely! Boom.💥 💥 💥
You should have put a 5kg weight on it
10:46 I’m just saving this to rewatch in a Gaunson’s best moments compilation
You guys have got to do more toilet paper! it's absolutely beautiful
How do you get up the dam
6:04
How awesome was that
👍👍👍👍👍
21 seconds
Any requests on how i throw it?  Y E E T I T
they should throw a paper airplane on of the dam
I thought you'll did cool things this as a bit boring
haven’t got a we’ll pin ya in a minute
Imagine the art throwing the toilet paper off with different colors of rolls at the same time
I thought "No way he grabs the tennis ball left handed" I am very impressed to be wrong.
Can you guys do a drop of heavy stuff directly onto GoPros because it would look rly aweskme
Never seen you drop stuff this high befor
Great to see the boys on holiday and having genuine fun with each other. Like some of the best older videos.
i have RAYCON and they did not give me 15 percent off but i like them I'm seowing you  people  for providing fake informasshin and lieing about your prices
4:18 Australians reacting to insects, have you seen what lives in Australia mate?
Gaunson gets an automatic additional point for not receiving a count down.
Hey Guys....ever thought about building a GIANT TREBUCHET?! Just think about the POSSIBILITIES what you could fling like.....!!!!!
Thanks for all the smiles guys.
Scott was treated unfairly, first time agreeing with him lol
Amazing!
Gaunson shouldn't have gotten the point for the pool. It definitely touched the grass. You could see it in one of the camera angles. Herron won outright, just glad he still came out with the win in the bonus round!
Throw a marshmellow and catch it in your mouth from the top of the dam
I got an idea, you manage to get 3 tanks of gas, 2 of them are Oxygen, the other is Hydrogen, place one at the bottom of the tower or the dam, and drop the other, and see if it makes a giant splash, or just explodes. Because I'm sure everyone knows what water is made of, right?
Heron the hammer with a big play off the rocks what's the odds ha. He got the point back when the build busted him. The cha cha with the turd tickets lol this one is great boys I'm sure there's some epic catch in the 3rd
That pool fell like that raft from Indiana Jones
Congratulations on surpassing Morgz in subscribers! 🥳🥳🥳
There should be a snack prize for the winner
my naam matthew
i love you guys videos and were is that vaaldman in what city
In Soviet Switzerland, beach ball catches you!  Also, the tennis ball deal should have been to toss the tennis ball and beach ball at the same time, for an extra point if he can get both of them. The tennis ball falls faster, so it's theoretically possible, but that'd be dang impressive if he could do it.
Which region of Australia accent is theirs? :)
All 3 of you guys are just legends because of your shenanigans.
The llama looked like a floating dildo.
nothing worse than bad salesmen
Aaaaa
Yo Scott mr Lucas is my teacher at FCC
GAUNSON for the win 🥇
Oh "dam" this is amazing folks
Ekmek niye atıyonuz lan günah 🇹🇷
Swing like the Duke's ball during Stuart Broad's 8-15 vs Australia
How good!
How to turn a baguette into a donut at 11:42
Scott was robbed
I've gotta say it really sucks that your sponsor doesn't ship to Australia cause Id love to get my hands on a set of their ear buds and support you guys while I do
Kinda wanna see the giant hammer vs a pool of oobleck
18:09 Attack on Titan Season 5 Spoilers
I got new nicknames for u guys - Guano, Grinner and Growler 🤣🤣🤣
Love the channel guy's, both of my boys get a kick out of everything you do.  Unfortunately my eldest son and I are disappointed to find that your video sponsor Raycon does not deliver to Australia. I thought I would get him a pair of earbuds as he has learning difficulties and needs some for his speech to text application at school, he wanted black ones but when we went to check out we found that they Don't deliver to Australia which burst his bubble a bit. As I said love the channel but please use sponsors that are accessible by Australian's
Hi guys I've got a problem I've just paid to join your members section but I cant view your members only vids is there a certain amount of time I have to wait for it to register that I've paid or is it a problem with youtube please help as you guys are great and my son loves watching your content
Put a bunch of ballistic gel dummies, and then throw a bunch of coins to see if they can do damage to them from that high
Gaunson was robbed by that throw!  21s time between 5 second countdown and the throw XD.
I like the idea of these vids.. i just cant deal with these lads, so annoying
Dam good!
Merch looks really good in this video and I love this channel so gotta support
I like Herron mustache👨
They fired editor
You guys should drop the inflatable pool and try to hit it with darts while it falls. Since it floated so perfectly
Try trowing the umbrella down the dam attach whith something bit heavy on the handle
Ummmmm next time, use a manican on the umbrella and see if Marry Poppins would actually work
Judging from the view i'm guessing its gonna be a "Dam" good video
Can y’all try to have a race to see who catches the most stuff
I would like to see you put something like the giant dart on the hammer and maybe hit some stuff like safes or bullet proof glass
what is the name of this dam?
These videos could be so much shorter.
"poo tickets"
these guys came to my school i few years ago
Fail with the soccer ball makes up for the pool hitting the ground
Horizontal distance 🤌🏾
If Scott deserved a rethrow, so did Derek for the umbrella lol
Whenever Derick Douglas Herron caught the rubber ducks, it was amazing
Why do u guys not have any shirts for females? Like no tank tops no v line shirts nothing to show off the womanly figure? Love you guys and wanna sport your merch but I hate regular t-shirts and I live in Florida where its HOT 🔥 ALL year long! Let me know if u add a female line in your merch!
Has anyone made the breaking bad reference yet?
JUMP RC TRUCKS OFF THAT
nice to meet you! I'm a Japanese YouTuber who mainly sells Shiba Inu. I really like your crazy videos. I want people all over the world to know more about the goodness of Shiba Inu! Will you help me?
Spongebrian Triangle Knickers
No worries from the lion king
I think that bug was a stable fly. Didn’t get a great look and I’m honestly too lazy to pause the video on that frame, but from the “get the fuck off me” vibes that sounds like what you were getting bit by😂
you guys need to colab with mark rober again and do a egg drop challenge from this dam but objective is to not crack the egg.... i wonder if parachutes would help here.
Good clean fun does exist on YouTube and the Internet.
Hahaha…………that was a good one
Well, if that doesn't kick the Llama's ass (ancient Winamp reference)...
Great fun, you have to do another with more things, like a cardboard box, a birthday card, a pringle, balloons with things like keys and a small lego construction, a Frisbee with loads of spin but not distance, a roll of wall paper opened so it will unravel, a giant rubber band. Keep up the wonderful insanity. God bless
You should drop Hulks fist on the Giant ax head
You’d have to buy 3 of everything, but everyone should get the same objects
Это пацанский контент😎
I have no idea why I find this Entertaining, but I do.  👋👋
The pool should've had something in it to sand in for Indiana Jones, Short Round & Willie from TEMPLE OF DOOM
Impossible challenge: Catching a water-balloon from 165m
DROP MAXWELL ON MAXWELL axe the axe😂😂
Scott was cheated with the football.
Is anyone convinced that Herron saw the new Top Gun and really liked Rooster?
So pretty there
🎵"LAMAAAA, Just killed a man..."🎵
So when are you guys going to come to the States and do some foolishness?
Amazing video as always, Can you do the same concept but with bowling balls? 🤣🤣
Rexy has been tho a lot lol
This has raised a lot of questions about wind pressure and gravity for me Edit: oh yea almost forgot. How ridiculous.
“One giant soft thing was good for me.” *That’s what she said*
Them: We're throwing everything off Me: What about the car
16:25?
21 seconds!
Gaunson always gets the shit end of the stick.
I'm so happy I found this channel. This should be nominated for Nobel Peace Prize.
These are the accents family guy makes fun of lol
You Guys Are GOLD 🙏
He’s even got the cast away ball
I feel like they've just upgraded the tower to the dam. Next upgrade should be a skyscraper.
love how they both say "MOUTH?" the same
Three Aussies routinely endure swarms of flies in most of their videos, yet are seemingly overwhelmed by a few Alpine sheep turd flies.  Odd, to say the least.
16:24 some one said a bad word
Gaunnson definitely got cheated on that soccer ball toss
Comment
You should drop Bruce from the dam onto a truck full of coloured paint.
Yep gaunson treated unfairly again
I can't believe he caught the pool.
Alright now I want to see like 100 unraveling toilet rolls. From the damn of even the tower
Danm I miss these videos 😂
Rexercise ball***
Much love from Canada 🇨🇦. I have the best idea (if it hasnt been done) You need 2 cranes and use Spike Tyson and a giant swing. It would be the most epic wrecking ball ever. Would love to see that. Imagine the carnage from a different angle.
New sub! Liked 👍🌞🙏❤️❤️
You guys shoulda threw the raycons down and have him catch them and go straight into the ad read lol.
It's ridicolous how I've been watching this channel for over a year and I still don't remember who is who
Herron performance was amazing.
Love from Pakistan ❤️
02:45  idno why but that scene nearly made me piss myself and im not even scared of heights lmao just came so quickly felt like i fell down
That was probably the dumbest incoherent thing I've ever heard 15:34
Gaunson started the "shady" game, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. So he's gotta be ok with what's thrown to him
21 seconds? Don’t think that was fair lol
Never thought y’all would throw a fluffy peen down the damn hhahahahaha
Does no one wonder how ridiculous the stuff on this channel is
11:06 my dog stepped on the bee
i need to see something float down on the pool!!!
could be Herron's best performance ever. I'm impressed.
Sure, that's a "llama"
The pool hit the ground
I have the same Wilson volleyball that Herron caught off the cliff.
You think whit that mustache the people gonna take you more serius?
18:09 abnormal titan
You should play on the gaming channel again. I could help you in fortnite? Get you a win.
3.. 2… 1… PINKYY!!
M-Classic Popcorn!  Nice 😜
Scott Gaunson was 🔥 Everything else was 3-2-1. To make the matter even more legit in the favor of Scott Gaunson, Derek Herron was trying to film it coming down, and he didn't even see it get thrown by Brett Stanford.
Was a fun watch and Scott was treated unfairly with that soccer ball throw, then there's Stanford who's really desperate for the win despite that bit of a dick move on Scott's ball.  Though that Raycon sponsor spot left a bad taste to my mouth, as it reminded me of the time when everyone and their mum were doing Raycon sponsor spots and it was just sickening especially since when actual reviews came, they weren't that good and were just marketed the heck to make them look good.
Whats with the 'girly' voices all the time!! Had to watch on mute.
Mary points right there😅 that was funny  please make part 2 😢😊
@7.23 I think that ladder might be a couple of rungs too short?
scott dederved a fifty pointa for the soccer ball
Low water level in the dam this time around 😬
2000
I wanna see these guys buy something like a pile hammer. I'm interested in seeing what they can do when used for crushing random objects.
Gaunson robbed.... Catch of the pool should have been the winner plus Gaunson didn't do deals and played fair with no chance of double or triple points. Take out the double and triple point plays... Gaunson won that fair and square.
good job good for you ❤️👍 Butttt!!!  11:25 Food is a blessing. What about the poor?🥺
I reckon Gaunson got screwed over on the old soccer ball
I will now call TP poo tickets.
21,s
good one.
Those flies are called horseflies
I love it
I’ve actually had those earbuds before and they are a 10 out of 10 for me I got them for 40 dollars at Best Buy
Rexxercise ball*
0:14 even the car
Gaunson got cheated
My dog went crazy when he  squeaked the rubber duck🤣😂
Sponge Bob had the best (most hilarious) drop ! That smile on Sponge Bob's face as He fell ever so gracefully ! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The umbrella and soccer ball should've been a redo
impressive
Now do it with an anvil :D
You should a make a competition to design/create an artifact that will take the longest to land in the grass (think parachute)
Can you guys say Shrimp on the Barbie for me pls?
Just re-watching the bouncing Line-X watermelon, and it gave me an idea.  I would love to see you drop a Line-X sprayed watermelon, that you first drill a 1 inch hole in. I would love to see the internals of a pulverized watermelon, blast out of that hole, to see it on high speed would be amazing!
hi
i got 409 rexy
It's would be nice to have more drop tower vids.
This is the best
For some reason i had the urge to try jumping off that and using the umbrella as something like a parachute 🤔
Love these Videos:)
You guys should try catching items off the dam while wearing different levels of beer googles
Ha! Ha! Stanford doing more rolls than Captain Kirk! Love you guys. From Grandma Linda in Martinsburg WV USA.💕
did you see the beach ball roll behind them in the top right
what did he say at 16:23 to 16:25?
“Ooh- I tooted” 💀😂
What happened to the "We'll PIN YA"s?
Absolute banger of a video
How ridiculous……
voices are annoying
One the one hand, Gaunson was treated unfairly by the lack of countdown. On the other, he did everything he could to trick and confuse Herron, so I think justice was served in the end.
Is this the sort of thing our worldwide youths are watching?  (I hope so) (could be a LOT worse)
It is time for you to approach everything you do during the day consciously. You should constantly control your thoughts and feelings. Any negative thought in your consciousness must be nipped in the bud. Protect yourself from everything that contributes to the existence of negative thoughts and feelings in your consciousness.
Molto bene grazie Evitaeterna.--{ñl,
Gaunson would’ve gotten the dub
Happy Father’s Day.
Do you guys live in Switzerland now? It seems like you've been there forever lol
Exer-rex or Rexercise ball?
God I could listen to them talk for hours !!! I loves these videos
Really struggling for video ideas now boys....
Lmao at circlework!
Exactly what part of the llama was that? 1:38
god that accents horrible. can you learn English please!
That does not look like a llama 👀
Scott was treated unfairly
21s
Ridiculympics?
"ooh i tooted" Lmaoooooo
to have more than one insane catch in a video is insane
"Lama"
I had Racons and mine only lasted maybe 6 hours never over that with full charge.
Normally I don’t skip raycon sponsors but I skipped listening on my anker Soundcore p3
the pool DID hit the deck
Boiis that was one of the best ideas you have had, Love how Stanford suggested the game changers....solid video guys. Keen as for more
alright boys a beach ball is coming down "proceeds to throw bowling ball" HA PRANKED
10:30 If that doesn't count, then the umbrella shouldn't count either. The ball *WAS* catchable if you had paid attention and saw where it was going. The umbrella was not catchable at all because it fell into an area that was not accessible.        It's not the other guy's fault you had your head up your ass. Sorry, that was a miss in my opinion.
Soccer ball out of bounds; penalty point Gaunson.
How do you keep getting access to that dam?
australians complaining about bugs is probably the most rare thing ill see this year
I’m not even joking… Herron gave me the “I’ve just met Superman” tears!
you should do this but with gold, like regular golf, and you aren't trying to catch it, your trying to make it into the hole
Gotta lose the porn stash lol........
Can you guys go back to the dam and attach the dumbie to random items to see if any of them will help him survive the fall.... plywood, umbrellas, pools... etc...
Need to drop the pool and then drop stuff into the pool on the way down
I wonder why they'd pick that llama?...
I don't recall you ever showing us the water side of that dam. Is boating action possible?
18 June!! That's my birthday
Is that the world's longest pillowfight hit?
never seen an ausie run from mosquitos
Amazing day
The umbrella gives me Mary Poppins vibes
So help me if there isn't another soccer golf video....
HAHA he ran like a flamingo
Cheers to the boys embracing the Northern Hemisphere summer!
more toilet rolls and spongebobs plss hahaha
You three have the maturity of 12-year olds...
I were using ray ons while watching this video
Book a trip to Switzerland. Make 20 videos throwing random stuff
Jesus Loves You
Amp up sudden death by catching foam anvils or real ones if you’re daring enough :)
great vid boissss
Denner Popcorn is the best... Did you eat it?
Gaunson got ripped off.. should have been a re throw
Scott was robbed
I was wondering if there are people who actually watch these videos, these types of videos are trending in the most watched ones Nobody can interfere in anyone's life
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~🟥
Switzerland, known for its not so deadly but really annoying bugs!!! XD. A swiss once wrote in the comment section.    (I am that swiss)
The llama …. Really didn’t look like…. A llama
Amazing video!
How much chaos could you lads create with a metric ton of feathers?
I have never laughed so hard at a toilet roll.
Gaunson definitely got robbed…. Winner winner chicken dinner
This one is fun.
que peste ya no tiene gracia.porque no se tiran ellos mejor JAJAJJAJA
That llama looks like a peepee 🤣
16:24 this, what?!
Twas not 5 seconds so it is a point for gonsen
U guys should see who can stick something in the ground first from the height, first fork then work your way up to a javeline, but all the items must be straight, and when it sticks it has to have one side sticking up, not upright just enough for it to be classes as sticking up
check out the new official twich clips is really fun!!
В одной песне соединили весь свой тернистый путь, все эры. До этого они работали, чтобы сделать себе имя, теперь настала очередь наслаждаться всем, что они приобрели. Лучшее только впереди! :)))
And that volley ball catch is why Heron’s the GOAT
use a bowling ball next time
You should have called this show "Australias next goaly" Hahahaha!!!😭
suben buenos videos de calidad
Caught it🤘🏽😌
At 7:42 the pool gave me the Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom vibes 100%
Australians flipping over European bugs?
Hakuna matata🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
Dang, the soccer ball was a bummer for sure. At least the pool was a gift though, not sure if it balances out
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus and obey what He wants you to do with your life or if you don't do this then when you die you will go to hell.
i like it but why all there voices so high pitched like a ladys?
01:06 What's that waving cable??
Herron's mustache suits him well
What’s with the 70’s porn star mustache?
Stumbled across this and entertained lol
Oof this is kinda dangerous imagine if something smacked his head unconscious?
you guys are great  you make me shitty day happy again lol
U.S. Government: "Everybody has to give up their guns so there are no more FBI-coordinated false-flag mass shootings!"  Also the U.S. Government: "We're going to start unjustified wars all over the world and get millions of innocent people killed, and we're also going to open the Southern border so there's a 49% increase in drug overdose deaths, because drugs already kill millions more people every year than gun deaths do, so let's make the problem ten times worse!"😋😛😜🤪😝...zjxi
Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless him! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who believes in him and follows his commandants!  Have a blessed day, everyone! ❤
please do the same only with water bombs :)
What is on the other side of the dam
How ridiculous made it to tiktok!
Scott was treated unfairly
Valiant effort, Stanfie. Also 21 seconds...too long.
One of the best thing about dude is that he nevar takes credit for himself when he achieves He always respect us the audience and his team and he is polite in all video.we congratulaties..

It's good to see the old stuff coming back again.
I love watching how much fun they have and how they act like little kids
this was fun to watch and I really needed that. Thank you <3
Power Vid🔥💪🏻 you guys should do some more catching videos💯😎
YouTube is the best , Great video guys 🙌🏽
I wonder what the grand total is in overall points/games won. Would take a bit of research but fun to know!  Keep up the great work boys!
18:18 Rexercise ball. hehe
The mustache is truly terrible unless you want to look like a 70's porn star
"ahh there's sleeping bugs on me." MATE YOUR FUCKING AUSTRALIAN
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9

These vids are just brilliant, how many world records have you just broke and made, highest rubber duck ever caught?
I DEMAND A RE THROW FOR GAUNSON
gorrnson had 6/6 so he won
I have finally figured out who Gaunson reminds me of. It’s a mix of Lee Evans characters, bust mostly “Tucker” from “There’s Something About Mary”.
When they said 'throw the baguette' i started laughing sooooo hard
15:25 bug attack
Bloody awesome stuff guys, I absolutely love the dam videos, keep up the fantastic fun MEN, and cheers from Melbourne
What the heck are those bugs?!
You guys need to make a giant golf club!!
6:00 ahahahahah
Gaunson 🤣
Thought Aussies weren't scared of bugs!😂🇬🇧🤝🇦🇺

Can you create a mechanism on the hammer so that the fulcrum can be raised or lowered so that the hammer head is horizontal when it first strikes the object? This might avoid the deflection that happens when the head hits at an angle. The deflection deflects some of the force of the blow.
Lol that was not a even pile 🤣 the pile has 2-3 alil harder ones 2 for sure
I love these dam videos
Long time fans here. I'm not sure how to politely say this but, Herron is getting a quite annoying with his cockiness these days, he's just NOT funny.
Scott was definitely treated unfairly
“What about beanie.” If you know you know
These bois certainly live up to their name
Try to catch a Bowlingball from a 165m Dam with your own hands!
After seeing this dam so many times I’d love to see what’s on the other side of it.
"Hakuna matata" is in Swahili and actually means either "no problem" or "no trouble"
Gaunson may have got the raw end of the ball, but the pool was a generous point
18:42 Ya litraly kicked mah butt
close to 44k likes!
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
That’s BS. You can’t say 5 seconds and then go 20s later without giving them a heads up. Absolute rubbish.
I know it would be hard too accomplish but I would love too see the pool dropped filled with water in it maybe add some color
Wtf did he say at 16:23 !!!??😳 did I hear what I thought I heard😂
There should have been a countdown!!!
21 seconds
Scott done did dirty. Had to take a shower after that for how dirty
Im just a child of Our savior.
How good Gounson how caught The pool
Why not just try and drop the giant dart over the 165m dam?
pool looked like a massive Pez
@How Rediculous Boys, Gaunson did get a stinker of a deal on that soccer throw. Bloody righteous throw, but he never saw it or knew it was coming til it was too late.
yes because 21s is definitely 5s
If there's ever a misthrow with small enough items youse should just use a drone to take it back to the top it could be fairly effective
Most I’ve laughed at one video in years
I will not be impressed until you do this with a bowling ball. :)
WHAT!! 😱😱😱😱
Want to do something no one has ever thought of? A completely original idea… portapotty cannon.
Drop 100,000 cheese balls in the stadium like the bouncy balls and ping-pong balls
Sierra Ann temple and Cohen beach are completely evil criminals. They harass single young women. They terrorize them with their friends, by hacking their computers,  spying on them 24/7, threatening them, and verbally harassing them.
Stanford didn't catch the beach ball, the beach ball caught Stanford.
Where is the dummy hanging from the umbrella?
But he didn't catch it!  It hit the ground first so it shouldn't count.
Behind Stanford, at 8:41, you can see a man mimicking the way the pool fell, haha.
The best collab in yt would be this guys x dp
Gaunson got hosed.
Seems like the boys have spent so much time indoors that they've forgotten about bugs :S
there needs to be a finale with 20 or so TP rolls off the dam. That looked AMAZING!!
#10 on Trending. Awesome job guys!!
There talents have gone up ALOT since there last visit.  I cant wait to see the other stuff they spoke about in the roonie vid
I'm a proud member of the 44 Club. Now smash that like button. 👍
first time in history you see Aussies afraid of bugs lol
Wilson finally came back…
Herron with the Top Gun classic I see
I clicked on the link and put the code in but Raycon don't deliver to Australia! 😤😤
“He has plucked it off the cliff”😂😂
Get in an orb ball and get pushed off 😁👍👍
You guys are so amazing
come to the caribbean hit me up
TP not PT
Tape a 5lb weight to the handle of the umbrella!!!
I got to put this out there .....you guys are the modern day British version of Jackass......Love it
I've gotta say Brett's tennis ball catch was very impressive
SCCER BALL WAS TOTALLY WRONG ! SHOULD BE ! XTRA POINT ! THAT WAS WRONG !
I NEVER side with gaunson he is never right. However he’s right this time. Team gaunson
Are you guys banned from the tower or something?
Next video- catching an anvil who will win 😮
3 Anvils who can catch one?
What happened I thought you guys where going to try and catch a Anvil this time. Who ever can catch the anvil wins right. You all get a try
This is 2016 YouTube right here
Breaking bad reference
4:17 is that a mosquito or something?
Strewth :)
I don't know why I'm suddenly obsessed with 3 guys chucking random things off a dam wall.
Man I hate these guys. With a passion. But their videos are interesting..... What are you gunna do?....
Y'all need to do flying toys, frisbees, paper airplanes, those big styrofoam planes. And such
stay safe do not get mortally injured health and safety has gone mad do ot try catch a cannonball or sumert a old leicester saying goes raw dikes when they cut in from prince ruperts go at leicester
I.. coincedentally bought the same pool as that.
Impressive acrobatics from Stanford
You guys are so stupid funny. Wish I’d thought of it. Hilarious 😂
Gaunson was treated unfair
What happened to the tower place they always used to drop stuff from? Channel aint the same without it
Derek have you fixed your tooth
My (nearly) 2 year old daughter loved watching this, she never sits still long enough to watch anything through so we were shocked! Great work guys, another cracking episode!
Such a classic vid, love to see it guys❤️
Definitely low testosterone in these boys...
What if you took an umbrella, tied 60kg to it, and saw how long it took to reach the ground. Just thought it would be fun
What a catch Stanford! Xxx
Now go catch the anvil.
Boys come to the reihn fall in Neuhausen /Schaffhausen in Switzerland this is a good place to make stupid things
Next video: Glow in the dark items off a 165m dam at night!
Hmmm if this ear buds is good for sleeping then im switching this from my Samsung buds lol
These guys are literally swamped with flies in half their videos, and now they are complaining about bugs? :D
Hilarious 😂😂😂
I hope HR doenst delete this but, DONT BUY RAYCON they are quite likely droppedshipped so importet out of china and rebranded to raycon and their sound is terrible. There are very good earbuds for around 60€ out there from renowed brands like samsung and others, please buy these and not raycon!!!
11:07 Aww that’s just. Flip me- HoW gOoD!
Lol
1:19 that what she said
I personally found it hilarious the Aussies we're scared of a few little European bugs. 🤣🤣
2:00 "I'm Mary Poppins y'all!"
Chuck norus
15:19 why
It's amazing how Australia has conditioned people to be afraid of any bug to the point of deathly fear of what look like mosquitos
Listen. I never comment. But. 'A bundle of poo tickets' is literally my favourite thing ever.
“There’s flipping bug on me” your from Australia dude!
but that last one they didnt even catch it
I absolutely adore the nostalgia content
I call foul on that soccer ball….
When mosquitoes attack!
Haha hihi that was funny
14:02 Commentator
It's a great "dah"
They should’ve spun that umbrella like a helicopter 😂would’ve looked sick if it spun an flew away😂
"Ooo, tooted."
”Did you forget the words, 3 2 1?” 🦖
I had a request you had a giant axe before I would really like to see a giant anvil.👀👍🏻💯
Мешок с цементом бросьте😅
Is that same venue as Freddie flintoff jumped off in a car?
Why try bungee jump to collect rubber ducks with fishing, butterfly or skimmer net in the biggest water body as pool, lake or river? Who have mostly ducks to win!
Good times boys
I see it I just don’t believe it. Catching things thrown from the top of a damn! How Ridiculous!!!!
You should start combining some challenges. Like catching the anvil, or the tungsten cube.
11:27 Yiyecek atılmaz. Dislike 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Bear looked like a deluxe basejumper.
21 does not equal 5!!! Gaunson deserved a second soccer ball attempt!
If you dropped the umbrella upside down it would be-stable
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
While I was watching the video  You squeaked the yellow duck and my dog went NUTS obviously I reminded it to watch her freak out to the sound
the toilet paper roll was awesome haha
i through u want to drop this car at 0:15
poo ticket.. 😄
it great day… not graait duy 🤦🏻‍♂️ 0:02
Two guys from Australia complaining about bugs in Switzerland.
Oi Scott!  Stop cheating!  I saw you push Heron out of the way, it didn't get you anywhere now did it?  Naughty Boi!  Dunno why you guys are moaning about the bugs in Switzerland......you come from a country where ALL your bugs are pumped up on steroids   haha
That was a great soccer ball throw or football throw.
Старашно высоте🤢🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢
Herron deserved that one after making that insane catch off the cliff  aye
These recent dam videos as made me a subscriber
Love the dam
Next video should be trying not to get hit by stuff
the Llama has a sus color lol
4:15 arent yall australians
Second channel video but still awesome 😎
You guys have to stop with these videos, my legs are cold all the way through 🤣
That didn't look like a lama to me.😳
That llama kinda looks like a… 🧐🧐
Missing the bright orange ball...that's on Scotty
2:18 🤣
Love you from Pakistan 🇵🇰
Brilliant- Kevin  & Cyndy UK
0:30 WILSON!!!
Ayyy let's go
Gaunson got robbed on the soccer ball throw
one wheelie, hate so much
Gaunson was definitely treated unfairly!
Try tossing the pool and then throwing balls into it as ir falls
16:24 "This nigga"? Lmfaoooo
I think it would be interesting for you guys to go visit the young guns opal mining crew and do a bit of opal mining. And while you're there, maybe blow some stuff up.
Believe in Jesus Christ. Believe in the Son of God. The Illuminati know – God exists. I am writing this to enable people to know that the Devil actually exists. But there is hope. Our Saviour Jesus Christ died so that we will live. Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me". John 14:6. The cult is called Illuminati and it is believed they worship 'satan' (devil).
Just so you know Stanford, that’s a mosquito
"COME TO DADDYY"
Am I tripping or is there no price on this screenshot? 14:52
Gaunson was screwed. He needs a point given.
15:44 this was my favorite part.
Would have been cool if y’all would have put rexy holding onto the umbrella
شو اسم
In the midst of watching this, I realized how wide my smile was.  Thanks for the fun!
That TP looked so cool you need to drop 100 rolls off at once.
21 seconds!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! That’s not fair at all! HOWEVER!!!!!! Scott also did not throw the duck in a way that was asked and told us so when he did it.
That. Was. Impressive.
Australians dropping a French baguette from a dam in the Italian speaking part of Switzerland ! How international is that !
Nice facial hair squad
raycons are hot fucking garbage, their sound quality is complete trash
Can you do 100 layers of cardboard who can get through it first please
Scott was definitely cheated by Brett. Boooo!! 🤣
with the unbella  add a little bet of weight to the handle and see if it will flow down .. like in the movie with the lady holding on to it....
Do bullet proof glass on swiss dam
The 1 video u should have used an anvi🤣🤣🤣🤣
and the next vid: combined from this and the anvil vs car-video ... catch the items you used in the anvil-vs-car video pls :)
16:16 SHEEEEEEEEEEEESHHH THAT ONE HANDED CATCH THO
the trumpoline was just next to that thing where the umprella fel on he could of maybe just jumped on
whoa at tennis ball. "there is noh way"
jour ar again in swiss i think
Could you please drop our Canadian Prime minister off that dam so us Canadians don't have to immigrate to Australia ... Please!
You should throw whole container of unrolling toilet rolls
I love the mid competition bartering and as always the all so natural “friendly” bantering 🤣
that Great
Those bugs were switzern yodeling hawks. If they bit you and you don't had medical attention within an hour, your peckers will fall off within a month.
13:16 is when they throw the ball thank me later
Herron was moving like a D-1 wide receiver lol
In slo-mo the Llama looks at him like "my hero 😍"
I laughed out loud when Stanford rolled over the beach ball.  Very good!
you guys should do disc golf shots off it
Guys it feels you need to clear the air & have it out-can feel the tension between you all!!
When you took the countdown of the football,  after you said 5 sec and took down the walkitaking,  it took 12.4 sec before you threw the ball. Does not count so he gets 2 points from me.
I'm not so sure about that llama though.  lol
I’m angry!!! 5 seconds seems like it would be 5 seconds! 21secs is much more and that should be a tethered or disqualification for the thrower!
swiss dam videos have got to be some of my favorite. keep up the great work guys🔥
Dam! What a viddy!
Another awesome video. Raycon is shit, but hey gotta pay the bills
This what? 16:24
bro 2:18 XDDD
Llaaaammmmmaaaaaaaaaaa ooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh
I’m fairly certain that physical therapy wasn’t thrown off of that damn dam!!! JS!
you all missed a good chance to call it a rexercise ball.....
>I don't want to see any hand assistance, just mouth and teeth  No teeth. Too rough on the old long johnny boy
Pardon my ignorance, but do these guys live in Switzerland or do they travel from Australia to Switzerland to make these videos? They have a number of them at this dam...
"I'm not keen on charity" Gaunson 2022
I can’t believe you guys get payed to do this… Good on you
For sure i had to subscribe after watching this mad show of the classic"Boys will be Boys" and it looks like i've a bit of catching up to do on your other videos , can't wait to see How Ridiculous it gets. Total respect you mad buggers.
:(
Herron should play AFL, he had more better catches than most of the forwards this season
We need a slow mo Toilet Paper Video! That short bit of it falling was pretty darn cool!
im angry >:(
aaaannnndddd claimed by Disney. lol
Wake up   Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family   God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved   it’s like the days of noah. God sending his servants in love because God loves you to warn you before judgment comes and yes of course human nature   Human beings ignoring God just like the days Noah mockers and scoffers laughing at the preaching of the word  scoffing at the preachers and persecuting those that come in love and share in love   scoffing at the word of God and all this scoffing and mocking even after all that you’ve seen since 2020 and have experienced  Yet everyday life continuing people oblivious to the coming judgement upon this world like the days of noah and ignoring everything that they’ve seen and are seeing   ignoring the fact that there’s a war happening in Ukraine which could potentially lead to nuclear war also ignoring the fact that Israel is about to go to war with Iran and China is about to go to war with Twain   Ignoring the fact that food prices are rising aswell as fuel prices there’s talks of worldwide famines by 2023 new diseases monkeypox after we just had a virus cause havoc on this world for two years and now we have a new one   yet people are choosing to ignore all this signs when the bible told you that this would happen in the last days  A time prophesied by Jesus - a time worser then anything that’s happened  in this world yet you can still be saved out of that time and out of the tribulation and it’s only through Jesus that you can be saved from the wrath to come and from hell and from eternal Separation from God because of you’re sins for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   you’re in the middle of a spiritual warfare light - against -darkness and you have no idea how great or wicked that darkness is nor what that darkness is doing or planning for you   the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to judge this world and to put everything right  God’s will is for all to be saved and for none to perish but time is running out this is not the time to be running away from God but rather to God and for my brothers and sisters in Christ   my fellow Christians don’t play church you’re either with Christ or you’re not beloved. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.  you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  Beloved You have to pick up you’re cross and follow Jesus and deny yourself daily and crucify your flesh daily and be holy because God is holy offer you’re body as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto God beloved strive i repeat strive ! to enter through the narrow gate for many will try but will not be able too   This message is shared out of love to everyone so you can be saved   So Repent and give you’re life to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and saviour and receive forgiveness and salvation through Christ Jesus    Acts 4.12  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved   John 14:6 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me  God bless
My 4yo keeps telling me y'all need to take better care of Rexy 🤣
Some real sportsmanship being see here from Herron! but Gaunson's foul ball need a retake - 100% was cheated
Please show us how you get up / down the dam wall and how long it takes?
that was one of the best ones lol, loads of funny bits. could you guys do the rc car track at the bottom and drop stuff like at the tower , that would be cool
Need to drop the pool and try to drop things into the pool before it hits the ground.
Have a Suggestion for Throwing Inflatated things from 165m Dam: Inflated Rubber Glove, inflated Plastic bag (small and big), Inflated Condom, bubble wrap etc.
Can’t buy raycons through that site in Australia
The implication that Scott's throw of the duck was girly ain't it Herron
First they amazed us with their skill with left hand, then tried to take one in the mouth and finally it all came down to the purple ball!  What an exciting video!
Freddy Mercury🤪👍🏻
Gaunson cheated 5seconds not = 21 seconds and no 3 2 1 cheap shot for sure also cheap he short threw the duck but he did catch it
Gaunson was treated unfairly
Are you sure that's a Llama?  It looked like a cock and balls.
household brick
I was so confused how you were gonna catch things from that height since it's usually bowling balls and watermelons, glad everything was soft and floaty. Also soccer ball redo was deserved!!
That beach ball was freaking HUGE
He got cheated so hard 😂
That football throw was dodgey! You deserved to loose.
I was rooting for stanford on that one, I don't usually choose sides in the competitions but that was a brilliant wager and would have been an impressive catch if he succeeded.
those bugs are horse fly's
The size of that huge mesquito  on standfords leg was disgusting then when herron noticed the mesquito's biting you could see the swarm of them flying all over the place they where everywhere 😫
13:15 a lo que e venido
I love how it floats in the air.
Hakuna Matata!
“The left hand needs to bring something special” ….. I find myself giving my left hand the same motivational speech sometimes.
Another amazing video
no joke.. at 2:45 into the video that shot made my stomach drop..
Favorite Australian YouTube channel aside from lazarbeam.
Stanford just ripped that football into the trees? Have they ever hit the trees here before?
Good freaking fun
Anyone peep 16:25 ?💀 “this nigga”
Always bet on Herron
The second I heard the rules of the game I said "I can't wait to see Stanford take a diver" and low and behold we got 3 of them!
the guy with blue short, is so uber hipster... some day he will understand and see...it is painful
Holy shit those are annoying voices.
Well, the Raycon discount thing doesn't work. I'll go for a different brand or another creator's code :)
Zombie ballistics dummy off the edge! Or maybe with a parachute, or some kind of twist? Like a bunch of katanas placed sideways on the landing!
Should have spun the umbrella so it had centrifugal force and would be stable as it fell
I love this channel. I started watching HR when you all were making videos at this location. Then the ideas for videos got even more entertaining and fun to watch. Thank you guys for being you 🙏🏾
That one hand catch was amazing ❤️❤️
Stanfords TWENTY ONE SECONDS reuined Scotts catch!
Next time throw your walkie talkies up from the dam 😍😍😍 Love your Videos
its a rex-ercise ball
Are you guys some type of brother and the way
Love the reflection of the volleyball in the sunnies at 5:22, looks like your eyes are popping out :D
I'm disappointed. I wanted to see you throw each other over. Cmon, make the world a better place. Maybe next time
You can just roll up to this massive dam and throw stuff off of it?
You guys are most entertaining, mentally deficient people YouTube had ever allowed to post videos. Don't quit your real jobs.
Rip umbrella
"i dont want any hand assistance. all mouth and teeth" brilliant
That song sounds much better with these raycon wireless earbuds! 😂
Gaunson was done bad in this one... 😭
There's something funny about Australians complaining about European bugs. Surely the Ozzie bugs will kill you, the Euro bugs won't?
I'd like to see a bunch of toilet papers falling like that.
Bounce it up
I mean there always only one rule where all of you always do the count down i can see he was expecting that 😔
Should have done two points per catch, one point per caught throw, thereby giving incentive to the thrower to throw well.
Scott...you can't claim you got cheated when Herron's umbrella landed on a platform he couldn't get to.  C'mon man.
You need to throw the pool off the dam and shoot things into it. Basketballs, bowling balls, soccer balls, ping pong balls. Everything.
Sorry guys but Gaunson got screwed.
I'm stanning for Gaunson about that soccer ball.
I'm with Gaunson on this one. Lulled into a false sense of security then he was gazumped.
I wanna ask that 1000 rolls of TP are dropped from the dam
My fav so far!
I don't like that overwhelmed behavior
i want you guys to shoot something from the bottom of the of the dam, up to the top. will Mark Robers t-shirt cannon do the trick?
In America we call that bug a mosquito
That’s not fair they should tell u when it’s coming not say 5 seconds then thro it at like 20seconds later
Gaunson was treated unfairly
Gaunson should have gotten a re-throw since the CAMERAMAN did not even see the ball, so it should not have counted. XD
You guys have too much fun doing stupid stuff I'm jealous lol
ít
Dude do you guys not have mosquitoes?😂
This reminds me of the food old days. Just dropping anvils off of towers.
I love the vids where you all clearly had a blast this was great!
It’s a REXercise Ball 😂😂
Öj nöj, stupid accent
sometimes i cant understand anything they say. but i bet its amazing
18:47
Stanford was stitched up in the last video, Gaunson in this video, need to bring in some rule clarification gents 😅
How does one (HR) get permission to throw items off a dam wall. It’s insane
That TP was awesome haha
Please make him shave the stash
Aussies coming to Switzerland and being scared of bugs lol
I swear I heard something totally different at 16:24 secs. however love your vids guys, I watching them during my morning routine, starts my day off with a laugh. much appreciated
you guys broke my heart when you threw the anvil's off because i can't afford one
Gausaon been cheated 2 weeks in a row team gausaon
Some nice catches from Heron
How come the sponsor wont sell to Australia? Come on fellas, you gots to keep it real 😜
Herins face after he catches the rubber ducky has me crying 😭
That's pretty good, but can he catch the GIANT AXE?
I'm so happy the toilet roll unwound
missed a trick by not calling it a rexercise ball!
The soccer ball was unfair to Gaunson, as he had to make such a catch without even realizing it had been thrown. In addition, Heron only caught the rexercise ball after it hit the ground, so they should have thrown something again.
It’s a wonderful frase
21s
LOL it took him 21 seconds to throw down the soccer ball when he literally said 5
Again, do not throw food or use it, this is a big and annoying mistake
Throw the pool into the water just go swimming in a pool
Definitely worth my time  Ur vids are stupid but the best EVER! 🤣🤣
16:24 🤨 what did you call him?
Impressed with Herrons commitment to rocking the 70s porno moustache...
Next time catch a brick
I feel like it was kind of okay that Scott got an improper count down for the soccerball considering both toilet paper and pool hit the ground and he recived full points for... so i think that kinda justifies it, he should have been ready all the time after that '5 second" call from stanf
After Gaunson deliberately dropped the duck after saying he'd throw it hard, I have no sympathy for his miss of the orange ball.
“As I watch a pillow fall, I rest on a pillow with a pillow on top of my head while my sister throws a pillow at me” -CooperJ 18/6/22
Try to Magnus a bowling ball
"Oo I tooted"
21 is a LOT more than 5 mate
Can you throw me off that
I think why it’s so important to yell 3, 2, 1 is so you can anticipate then spot the object as it’s coming out so without it’s hard to get an eye on an object like an orange soccer ball until it’s too late
if only raycons shipped to aus
You guys are too funny 😅
How the other side of the dam looks like ? i want to see it xD
16:24 🤔
Gaunson was ripped on that 1 . Longest dang 5sec ever
I didn’t finish the video but from the start I felt ur blast of positive How Ridiculous you are always giving us happiness waiting for the next video
What happened to the comtest
OK, one of you needs to test a paddling pool as a parachute... just a thought! 🤣
Hi, if you can, it would be interesting to see,,,Please strap a human size dummy to the floating pool and throw it off the dam ?
Try catching the anvil next video lol
the lama looked like an arm being tossed off the dam😂
I thought the llama was a big fuzzy dick n balls. 😂 haha
How ridiculous
Heron needs to pull his head in, getting a bit unwatchable
when he said ive got a secret weapon i thought he was going to pull out a catchers mitt to make his hand bigger
channel intro: *EVERYTHING* going over the edge  me immediately afterwards: including you?
6:53 Definitely Slowie of the Day right there
I like how 3 guys from the place with like 99% of worlds deadliest animals are freaking out about a couple of mosquitoes
Have you noticed how much the water level of the dam has dropped since the video from 2016 ?
4:37 May God Forgive You
Raycon earbuds suck…
You guys sure that’s a lama?
Well done guys
Foam airplanes plz
The pool touched the ground
Everytime I watch these and it goes to an angle of looking down the dam.... I shit myself.
That was one hell of a vid! More impressive catches than T-20 highlight reel!
Gaunson is "sucking more than he should" with the rock off's though!!
so the skydiving boat scene in indiana jones is possible?
Alls fair 'at the dam' 😃
Damn! That's pretty high.
I know u guys are from Australia but love from Australia 🇦🇺
Trying to catch a bowling ball from the dam i think that’s a bad Idea
Magnus effect on a bowling ball? Something heavy....
what if that dam breaks...
Stanford is gonna tear his knee up or something jumping around like a fish out of water
Seeing all of Rexys scars makes me think that a halloween style rexy with bolts in his neck and orbeez dripping out his mouth would be awesome zombie rexy halloween merch.

dude, drop the pool with a 150 lb bag roped to it and see if a person would survive
These Dam videos are fire 🔥
These guys make my day
The pool hit the ground for sure 🤣
ON THE POOL IT TACH THE GRAND
yeyeye
Those dam bugs!
Man we swiss have bugs that scare australians. Who would have thought
You should try rugby
Scott got screwed
I've never seen an Australian so scared of bugs.
And that's the way the brolly tumbles
Just so you know lads. Unlike in Australia, when your in Europe you don’t have to worry about bugs. Their not gonna kill you here
Justice for Gaunson
9:08 takin that outta context👹
This channel is the living embodiment of personification
Yeah Gaunson was absolutely robbed on that countdown
Awesome video. There's probably no God.
Just remembered I got a party tomorrow it’s currently 430 am, oh yes. The vibe has been revived. 165 meter high club bois.
These are the videos we want!!!!
Idea: Playing lawn darts from the top of the dam.
The best for you guys is that there are no poisonous thing's were you are😁
When Magnus effect back?
Watch your feed there is a Bee,  got me hahaha
Heron looking more like Ned Flanders on the daily.
You guys are really treating each-other unfair lately !!! Makes me sick
You guys should chuck tons of toilet paper if that dam
“Gaunson stepped on a bee.”
I love how regularly you upload videos. That’s commitment!
I'm sorry, but I can't side with Gaunson. He was told the ball was coming in five seconds. Granted, it may have been a bit more than that, but he should have been paying attention rather than waffling on about the cliffs on either side of him.
Amazing day!
Why is there a ladder attached to the dam
16:24 "this nigga"
poor children in africa I'm sorry about the kind of toilet they would give and the pool
Horse flys in Europe are the worst! They are almost indestructible!!!! 🤢
What about a dog
Lol did he uh  yeet that thing into orbit or something?  Goo god. get that man a NFL contract. He can't be more suck ass than the other QBs.
People who watch cricket know how good Australians are in cricket and fielding
Try to throw a durian
try it with an anvil
21s...
I was considering the earbud deal but does not ship to my address in WA..... fuck em
Even if the soccer ball had a count down how would he catch it between all those trees
16:23 this what did you say?!
Can't believe no one said Rexercise Ball!
Trop bien les video en suisse
Love this old type of videos !
Those bugs can drink you’re blood
I first started following you guys when you were putting out all of the videos from the first go around at the dam. Was bummed when y’all said you wouldn’t be filming there anymore. So it’s been so awesome getting more great content from this spot.
Oh how I love the dam! ❤️
Do they all have false front teeth? ...They look like the sons of the Bee Gees.
If you’re not going to say the count down, you have to be clear there’s going to be no count down. That’s the same as starting a race while everyone is still walking up to the line unprepared. Brett should t have got a count down on his tennis ball.
Lately I been thinkin water skis...
im sorry, but it didn't "really"  look like a llama?  🤣🤣
Those bugs are a type of Miskito. They typically drink horse blood and because of this they can bite you through hoodies. When you get bitten it feels like a mixture of an electric shock and a sting, a very unique feeling. The result of the bites, how ever are less aggressive compared to the common Miskito. They reside in some southern parts of Switzerland, but due to global warming they have spread threw Switzerland and have been in my home Kanton Bern for about 4 years now.
Rethrow
Yes u guys are rocking it
Vids like this make me miss the tower.
Wait a sec...how does Heron win if he didn't catch it???! I call foul!!
6:42 pt? Paper toilet
throw giant rolls of toilet paper off the dam
I really really want to see a round 2 with the teeth cathc, i think Gaunson can do it, but non of you else can
Tie, as it wasn't a clean catch by any of you!
The fact that Stanford freaked out over tiny bugs but they’re Australian😂
Gaunson was robbed! ⚽
4:37   with a catch like that, he should be a wide receiver in USA football.
Justice for Gaunson!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gaunson was hosed on ball toss
Controversial. I think Gaunson was in the wrong and that all was fair in love and war. He should have been paying attention. The throw was unfortunate, but should have at least been looking
21 seconds
Gaunson deserves a rematch
Everyday is a good day when your rich for doing basically nothing lol.
There's a pilot training technique where you toss a roll of toilet paper out the door, wait for it to unravel, then take runs at it to hit it with the wing. Every time you hit it, it gets cut; better pilots can cut it more times!
Mustache for the win
I still think that left handed tennis ball catch was the best one of the vid; and the best miss was the beach ball 😂😂😂
Anybody else get a Charmin ad right after Gaunson caught all that TP? Lol
Gaunson is right
you should drop a car down a real one
Using 477mhz Aussie Radios in Switzerland?   I wonder if that fits their band plan. Could get in trouble lads.
I am amazed
How dare you treat gaunson like this!!!
I’m calling Shenanigans by Stanford with that lack of a countdown
Looks like Mary Poppins should have used a inflatable pool
Scott was Robbed
I dont think they should do rock, paper, scissors anymore, Herron clearly has plan for each game. he has the best ratio of the game of anyone I've seen.(also imagine how good they would be at catching a punt <American Football> after catching from these heights.)
Gaunson got ripped off. Not only did he not get a countdown, but the throw was also completely uncatchable.
SINCE HE MISSED THE UMBRELLA, DOES HE HAVE TO DRESS AS “MARY POPPINS” NEXT VIDEO! 🤣🥰🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻😆😆😆😆😄😄😄🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
@10:10 I wAs fiMiNg iT bUt I dIdN’t SeE iT 🤣
At no point did that llama look appropriate for YouTube LOL
Must be dam bugs.
What did you do today?  I cought a pool off a dam
justice for gonson
A catch on the soccer ball should be given to Gaunson 🙂
Gaunson on should have gotten a re-toss with the soccer ball
Just in case if you never seen the sun!!!!!! lol
Omg at 5:22 look at the reflection of the ball in Herron’s glasses!!! It looks like googly eyes!!!!
Out of all the videos I’ve watched from you guys in the last 4-5 years of you guys the Switzerland videos are always the best
HOW GOOD 🤙
21 seconds though???? 4 times the amount Stanford said,  oof I'm sorry mate, got shorted for sure
Western Australians complaining about the bugs has to be one of the funniest things I've seen this week
nv
vnb
bv
nb
Can we see the other side of the wall please
Rexy is the best man
Are you guys gonna sell the bear on the store I'd love to buy him
Loved stanfords deals 😂
18:10 was pretty funny so was 15:28
Missed opportunity to call it a Rexercise ball there lads
வேர் லவள்
Wtf was that😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬
111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
GIVE GAUNSON a rethrow~!!
I’m going to tipidorf
17.31 Ow my ears haha
Me laughing when sponsor comes up bc I'm ligit watching this with my new raycons (they're amazing btw)
Scott got jobbed.
Scott won cuz Stanford cheated
😡😡😡😡😡😡
Bro that’s cheating
Luv ur channel!!!
It's funny to see an aussie getting startled by european insects.
5 ≠ 21. Scott deserved a rethrow.
The tie breaker should have been first to have a full catch I reckon
Recomend a video where they throw things like the pool off the dam and try to throw balls in it while it falls the most balls landed in before it hits the ground wins
Gaunson was robbed he should have won this. Great video can't wait to see what the next items you are throwing off
Catching a tennis ball thrown from a 165 dam with his off-hand should be the title. that shit was epic hahaha
Love how you can physically see how much fun you guys are having and can see what such great friends you guys are in this video. 44-4EVER
Fino gave the umbrella under it I wonder what it's like
Herron channeled his inner Gauson. What a cheetah.
should have included an anvil smh lol
21s …… he got ripped 😂
Justice for Gaunson
Got a toilet paper ad right after the roll toss 😂
Gaunson on was def screwed
Scot was not treated fairly just my opinion
That first dude very good
It amazes me that something can be thrown that high can be catchable.
Anyone else really wanna ride a swimming pool down the dam?
Scott was definitely treated unfairly😂
Mad respect for Herron!
Stanford has to have a world record for that left handed tennis ball catch.  How much higher can you get and throw a tennis ball? Glorious work boys
Funny
Gaunson was robbed! No countdown, No fair!
can you try paper plane
44 club 🤣❤️
You guys should do a kickball game with a ruberband ball
Time for a second warehouse at the dam. I love these videos
21s between the 5 second warning and the throw, i demand a retry!!
Stanford gets extra points for rolling over the giant beachball and diving for things like an absolute goalie. xD
You guys live in Australia and you’re complaining about bugs 😂
Herron, the moustache is growing on you
I remember when the forty four club had four.
Drop him a watermelon to catch
Guanson should have won. Mainly because there was said a 5 second cool down. And editor jack said there was 21s before the ball was actually thrown. In my eyes that is a 6/6 because of when yhe ball was thrown to when it was said and plus no real countdown
Play the biggest game of 500😂
play Minecraft! play Minecraft!
so cool
Everything went Mill heron again lol even with Stanford trying to manipulate the rules he still lost 😂😂😂😂
Them @ 14:01 Me at 14:01: Trying to take a picture of my Dog. Wait, I missed that? Crap, thanks for telling me, REEEEWIND. lol
raycon dont even ship to australia lmao
4:20 looks like mosquitoes. They suck your blood out and leave a itchy mark
At 1:38 the llama lines up exactly with the discoloration on the dam, so it looks like it's smeared hahahahaha
👍
Am I the only one who's never heard TP described as 'poo tickets'? Because I am the literal embodiment of this emoji right now: 😂
Gaunson should have spun the umbrella lol
I love the wholesome content on this channel!
Is it just me or does Derek look like Kowalski from Fantastic Beasts, just in better shape?
That looks like an imposter Rexie
Wow that was absolutely amazing 2 watch especially the catch of the clif and the 1 hander catch wore just brilliant catches well done u guys take care now ya all now OK bye peace out 😎😎😎✌✌✌🖤💜❤🤍.
You guys are amazing you save my days for ages!!! Sooo fantastic and if you ever feel the slight change in life to the worse just see a video of these guys they know how to put  a smile on EVERYONES face again and let it be a lesson in good therapy!!!! 😀   Thanks to you for doing this!!!
Scott was treated unfairly !!!!
Scott was treated unfairly for suuuure
The toilet paper was the best..so funny
I love that Dam. I am assuming the painted white rectangle is to be used for movie projection nights. Its a very beautiful place and watching a movie on the backside of that would be cool. I'd love to watch something like Day After Tomorrow or anything with flooding just for the added suspense.
I think Gaunson was wronged. I thought they had to catch the Rex-ercize ball?
Are any of these  world records?
I seen 5 baggets in this video anyone else ?
Try with the anvil now
This video was great.
Y'all should throw more pools and then try to land things in the pools while they're falling!
the ball wasn't caught and neither was Rexy - DO OVERRRRR!!!
Catch a bowling ball next?
Does your toilet paper not have a cardboard core???
I've missed this dam a lot in the past 2 years
Just gonna say that I am 100% calling toilet paper Poo Tickets when others need it or I need it. What an amazing combination of words!
Those looked like mosquitoes. 😂
NICE!
The tp floating through the air actually looked pretty cool.
@16:23 "this neggahhh"
Committing SUICIDE off a 165m Dam!
HR: Everything will be going over the edge and being attempted to be caught *Camera pans out to show car* Me: Hmmmm
Time to go hardcore, catch lawn darts
Y’all need to get Rick smith jr, to come pop giant balloons with cards 🔥✅💯
Amazing! I love this!!  When is the next video at the tower?
21 seconds was not fair .5 for unfair throw
Herron definitely deserved that W. He came to play!
This is the complete opposite of what they normally throw off of tall structures.
Read my name
Thanks guys for the commitment and going back to the damn for your viewers. That’s to show you guys really care about us!!!😁
Love how you guys thanked our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on your 11 mil subs vid🤍✝️ keep up the great and entertaining work mates
What an awesome job by all involved!  I love the Switzerland videos!
Absolutely awesome
That pool hit, but still deserved that point.
"THERES FLEEPING (FLIPPING) BUGS ON ME" Made me die of laughter
Noice
Pool touched 8:35
Y’all should try jumping from it. That’ll definitely get tons of views. 😁😉👍
This is awesome!
21 or 23 seconds after he said 5 seconds till the throw is unacceptable.. lol I'm definitely thinking that should've been a re throw
Gaunson was robbed for sure
It feels like the guys are tense and a bit unkind to each other. I hope they’re all doing well.
Now catch... meeeeee!!! (of course there's a parachute sheesh)
Everytime they have a conversation of what kind of deal they are making like from 12:35 to 13:15 I think of the TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) movie 1990.  Even Gaunson reminded me of Mikey 13:05 The only thing they are missing is a 4th member.  Then again Rexy is the mascot, so nvm on the 4th member.
The pool was awesome
You know who should have had that
Who made the crazy noise at 2:04?
Scott was treated unfairly
i was in the baech and  went to the pool🥰🥰🥰
No darts? Or bowling ball?
i was in the baech and  went to the pool🥰🥰🥰
Wow, nearly 12 million subs! Congrats boys 😉👍✨
It was too long. 5 seconds turned into twenty? Should've had a redo
These boys would be phenomenal outfielders!!
Also - I'd love to see a Commonwealth Challenge with Rugby and Cricket balls, like maybe with a Jai Ali helicopter instead of a baseball bat helicopter, i bet it would fling things way too far.  Like, way way way too far.
"It's doing interpretive dance" hahaha best comment!
13:13 you can tell these guys never played baseball. If they told me I had to catch left handed I'd be ecstatic. I feel weird catching with my right, and I'm right handed. Years of baseball with the glove on my left have ruined me.
Gaunson definitely should have got a redo for that soccer throw.
Rexercise ball when?
The camera shaking while Scott yells no0o0o0o0o0o0o is just perfect.
They need to do “trying to catch small fruits.” Some like kiwi, strawberries, bananas, tomatoes, etc.
Respect! Took his eyes off the ball and went from the sun to the shade stumbling, with the mountain bounce! Well done!!!
More barking spiders?
5:50 Poo tickets... That's new. I can't handle that it's amazing 🤣
Always been interested as to what a roll of shit tickets would do to the human body at terminal velocity.
I found Gaunsons tissue paper catch humorous.. Scott Gaunson live "stream"
Scott, you forgot to tell us to get the bell on!🔔. Love your vids gents!  Peace.
Throw a type of all kind of hats/cap.
I actually gasped been Stanford snagged that tennis ball one handed
He deserved a proper countdown
As I have said before the amount of waste your lads produce just to "pay your bills" is catastrophic, wasteful and at times absolutely disgusting.
GIVE GAUNSON ANOTHER THROW OF THE SOCCER BALL >:(
Y'all should put all the items in the pool and see what falls out after you throw it off the dam.
You bet on your TEETH?!
Rexy tha man😎tell rexy I said hi🦖
Can I get a video of Gorncen in a Mario costume
A very good Saturday morning to you all from Wellington Somerset in the UK
Them:everything’s going over the edge  Me: sees car* Also me: please throw it!!!
That bug is a Miskito
Gaunson was robbed. If the throw had come anywhere from 4-6 seconds after the declaration of 5 seconds, I'd have said tough luck, but 21 seconds may as well have been an eternity. He should have at least been awarded a redo.
Hi
Only noticed cause I just watched dynamite but Gaunson kinda looks like will ospreay at certain angles lol
Also the toilet paper roll is so fucking funny hahaha
Where's the tally for RPS?!
Big bro is getting married tomorrow, wish him luck
YESSS LOVE THIS RUNNNNN YASSZS
Sadly I think it’s too late this time around but we need a night video at this place.  The things you could do with throwing lights etc would be absolutely epic.
It’s crazy that he didn’t see the pool touch the ground it literally touched in the replay.
For someone who knew something was coming down, Scott sure was looking everywhere but the dam
Gaunton got deceived with the soccer ball haha
Bro at 16:25 he said the N-WORD!!!!
How long does it take to get from the bottom of the dam to the top?   I assume you drive.   Also how many miles? Or km’s?
Anger
You guys need to put up some large balloons on the bottom of the dam and see who can pop the most from on top of the dam. I think that would be funny
scott was treated unfairly
2:38 Use the trampoline to get up there
The views out there! Priceless
I like this but I hate it I am terrified of heights so when your up there and look over makes my mind think I’m falling
Dude, SpongeBob was falling face up the whole way down just floating gently had me dead.
Rexercise ball
Big ups for that left handed catch for all of us lefties out there!!!
Gaunson wouldn't have even caught the soccer ball even if it had been thrown in 5 seconds, and as we all know they don't do rethrows for something as simple as a far flung soccer ball.
The ball was unfair
Idk why but I wanna see them throw a realistic human dummy over the bidge
Amazing new vid.
🐛 Com'on buggie. Love your faces. Best of luck!
👍👋 I wanna see more unraveling toilet paper. Edit: Did he catch the anvil? 😁 Edit 2: Throw a water balloon down to him. 😏
If we can watch things like these on Earth, why would anyone want to go to space!  Amazing stuff, never saw such light stuff falling from such great heights.
165 meters = 544.5 feet.
All time best Gaunson line--"I was not keen on charity....!"
Heron is Inhuman
HOWRIDICUIOUSさんチャンネル登録しゃすう1160万人突破おめでとうございます🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊あとこれからも動画投稿を頑張ってください💪✨
Next vid: trying catch the giant axe from the dam
I’m not saying that the Llama looked a whole lot different than a Llama! I’m not saying it looked a bit like a wiener! I swear!
Gaunson was definitely done dirty
How Ridiculous : All of these are going over and will attempt to be caught. How Ridiculous: (Zooms out) Me: (Sees car) Also Me: WTF
Dam good video gentleman! 🤣
Scott got ripped on the ⚽️
Raycon hearbuds are great. I used them to watch this video
Gaunson: making whingeing an art form.
❤️
Why does everything end in a y? Rexxy, tenny, beachy, every video is the same 😂
4:19 how does he not know what a mosquito is? Don't they have like every bug ever in Austrailia? If they have no mosquitoes I'm willing to risk the killer kangaroos and turantulas and I'm moving baby.
The only TP part that should matter is the roll.
Very impressive catches! That's very difficult.
When your only miss never made it all the way down.  How Good.
Are you being payed for doing this sh....t?
" llama "
Is Herron Robert Irwin’s Dad?
next episode: catch the anvil
Heron did not win due to him not catching it. Item can not touch the ground.
its TP boys not PT lol
so this was filmed before the car was brought in to get royally destroyed. love it
Wouldn't be a normal episode if Scott didn't get screwed atleast once.
The mouth-catch was epic - well, almost :P Great vibes as usual, good laughs - how good, gents. =)
At the end :                    Awimaweh.....awimaweh....awimaweh....awimaweh........😂😂😂
Rexercise ball 👌
"We got a pOOl"😂
Heron just being attacked by mosquitos not know in what they are.
Poo tickets?  Toilet humor from down under, eh?
Yes out of the boring warehouse
1:40, that quite look like a llama...Lol
I give Gauson a 5.5/6 points for the lack of count down. If you day in 5 seconds, you go in 5 seconds, or it doesn't count, so he didn't get a countdown because the "countdown" given doesn't count.  Nothing after 18:10 exists.
Game of lawn darts from dam
The ball caught him😭
Brett deserves serious props for his attempts for the giant beach ball and SpongeBob
It seems to me Stanford had the most difficult items to catch of the three boys.
it was funny when he said yeet it
Fabulous video, boys.  Happy to see you living the dream.   I want to see the footage from the GoPros that were thrown aside in the quest for the catch.
A suggestion to make the next catching competition fairer: the thrower gets half a point if the catcher catches the item.  That will be an incentive to try to throw it close to the catcher (and give a count down).
He DID say in 5 seconds. I think that constitutes a countdown since he had to set the walkie down
Never seen Aussies so scared of a few bugs. Disgusted.  As punishment you must eat a meal at the Stirling Gate Hungry Jack's.
That has to be the c
you have to say 321 that not fair protest
he could have just use the trampoline to get the umbrella
I dont know but i think he said the n word in 16:24-16:26
How good!
The umbrella falling feels like the spinning t-wrench in 0g more going on there than it appears.
Beautiful day out there.
nice
IT HIT THE GROUND THE POOL
That didnt look like a Llama falling
Lol.
Stamford was absolutely robbed of points in the previous game, but still gave points to Gornson when he clearly dropped 99% of the t.p. The generosity and humility of the man knows no bounds.
U guys are the best watch you guys all the time
I can't believe Stanford caught the ball with one HAND!
21 seconds? That's right out! He deserves the point
Watching stuff fall is oddly cool
Derek "Eric Bugenhagen " Herron
He wasn’t visible when he threw it.  That’s kinda sketchy.
Hell of a job you guys have.
Ooh! Ooh!  How about an anvil?
part of the pool hit the ground
14:16 when you need to **** but your right arm is broken
Is there strings attached to the items??
You guys are a great watch, funny as hell and entertaining ! Always look forward to the new videos more than others
I can't lie Stanford really put on a show!
the 21 seconds after the "countdown" is about as unfair as not counting the mannequin and Rexy (if you didn't wanna count them both then you shouldn't have put Rexy there)
See if he can catch a bowling ball or a hammer.
do yourselves all a favor.. dont buy raycon earbuds lol.
Awsome video guys. I just thought of another idea for your "how many" type of vids.... sheets of ice (about 1-3 cm thick). How about it?
Both the umbrella (out of bounds) and the sneaky volleyball throw were blatantly unfair.
So it walks on the higher presssure
At first, I was thinking the 5s warning was fine... but when that turns out to be 21s, I'm thinking that was a bit unfair. But then the umbrella never made it to the ground, so it ended up a bit of a wash.
That pool catch reminded me a cow in tall grass, utterly tickled!
Too bad it's been shown that raycons have TERRIBLE sound quality.
HOW IS THAT NOT CALLED THE REXERCIZE BALL??
Drop Spike Tyson on a car or jet ski!
Stuff guys always wanted to do 💪🏾💪🏽
Next video: How many beach balls does it take to burst through a dam?
Why does Gaunson Speak every single sentence through 7 different octaves?
try a brick next time... 😈
Herron just cancels every commentators job when he stated “Why am I telling you, you would have seen it!”
You three laddie bucks need to tweak your rules and communication just a smidge. There was last week's 75 points whoopsie and this week's soccer ball countdown oops. Otherwise, fine show!
I tip my hat to all of you, gentlemen! That was an impressive performance!   I wonder if you'll do any more videos involving breaking stuff with deshelled peanuts (like that one time Scott had to throw one at the light bulbs)?
If I keep watching this channel it is because of Gauson and Herron, it is clear that they just want to have fun and I like them very much. I can't say the same for Stanford though, it unnerves me. He is ultra-competitive, a bad loser and always looks for a way to win with his bets to which Herron and Gauson always say yes, I guess to make the video more entertaining. Also, in my opinion, the inexistent countdown of the ball was a very bad act (which led me to explode and make the comment xdd). He is always cheating. For the rest, very good video as always and I'm envious of the fun things you do like this!!!
Hi
literally every single video is the same video over and over.  I guess if it aint broke don't fix it lol
16:24 ... Did hey say what I think he said???
My only complaint with the videos in the "how many" series is that it felt like they were so fast. It's nice having these videos at the dam that slow things down and we can enjoy watching the guys be themselves
What a super beautiful day, absolutely stunning
Gaunson got 6 points! You all agreed the last item was worth 2 points.  Give Gaunson justice!
That shit was intense until the very end. Thank you guys for a great viddy!
Scott got jipped - I was wondering why Stanford was up there playing basketball with the thing seconds after he should have already thrown it
Professor Gaunson got shafted there 💯 % x
21 seconds is not 5 seconds that all that needs to be said
When you throw the bean bag I saw a string attach to it
Tiebreaker was a bit of a lame way to do it IMO, but it's all for fun in the end so it doesn't really matter, lol.
Hey! I have that same hat Stanford! Keep up the good work boys!
I'm not a rocket seismologist, but 165 meters sounds like a lot. I'm gonna guess that damn is just like me: pretty high. Also, props to Stanford for finally using the boys' secret weapon: BIG OLD CHOMPERS.
That'd be a Rexercize ball I rekon
should've been wearing a harness
im angry
hi
The toilet paper was so cool!!!
That did not look like a llama!
Great catch
I find it hilarious that the bugs at the dam seem to bother the boys but the blow flys down under that are crazy intense, just get waved away like they're a minor inconvenience.
This was one of your most entertaining videos yet!
Soccer ball wasn't 2 pts?
Stanford great catch and shot! Filmed the entire single hand tennis ball catch.
Scott definitely should have gotten another/better throw with the soccerball. Brett should have at least yelled out that it was being thrown right when he threw it or say "throwing in 5 × 4 seconds" at least. XP
It touched the ground, it doesn't count, throw something else!
Scott got screwed with the soccer ball throw
Gaunson should have gotten a second chance on the soccer ball.
Ahhhhhh
Great fun video guys .Well done
What, no bowling ball?
Stanford won! The rule was “the last thing you catch is double” he caught the tennis ball last for 3 points, double that for 6 points and there’s your winner! How good?
Nah I’m with Gaunson. Not a fan of that soccer ball throw. And that’s probably one of the harder ones to catch, you can’t just yeet it with no good heads up.
I cant believe the Herron caught it from of the cliff tho
13:30 that's a big beach
Omg they invited mario over to catch some stuff. These dudes are actually sick. 🤓
The way the beanbag fell was great lol
Raycons are really awesome (personally i recommend the fitness ones) long life and decent design. Kinda want a green one like they had when they first started out but they stopped those
Need some more of the guys trying to catch stuff in their mouth after being tossed off things, damn, tower, roof, etc.
Scott got robbed so badly on the soccer ball throw - absolutely should have gotten a retake.  Brett losing was about the best redemption he could have gotten, though.
NS GAUNSO got shafted on the soccer ball…
Herron reminds me of what a ace fighter pilot would look like from WW1. LOL
I keep pausing this video, do something else, then watch a few minutes, and back again just to savor the fun content.
There was definitely contact with that pool...
I think Herron should try out as a punt returner for an NFL team!  If it doesn't work out, there's always Canada.
Nice rexercise ball
PT. Poilet Taper
I imagine the grounds keeper just begins openly weeping at the site of them pulling up to the dam.
Could you also try to land a hoola-hoop onto a large pole from the top of the dam as well? Great video by the way!
did you say "this nigga" on the tennis ball catch
Can you guys base jump from the top?
He should have waited to do the tennis ball last at 4 points if caught
Catching a giant beach ball from 165m? Damn!
Soccer ball redo!!
🤣
Raycon's seem like great headphones - but they don't deliver to Australia 😢
Videos are the best games
Don't think I noticed in the last video but dang, the water in the dam is empty compared to previous years of filming there! Also, funny how Australians (who live in the devil's science lab of strange and hideous creatures) are afraid of bugs! 🤣🤣🤣
Hey guys!  I've been trying to get a 44 club shirt for over a month and you've been out!  I just turned 44 a month ago and was hoping to get a shirt to commemorate my birthday.  I did the same for my wife last year but no luck for me so far!  When do you think they'll be back?  Hook a fella up!!
Poo tickets. Funny!
Need more tp off the dam that was beautiful
@ 5:39 he’s stirring up those bugs.
16:16 imagine the velocity the tennis ball had, and he just caught it one-handed!
Stanford look like an American football receiver with the popcorn.
Catching a tennis ball from there is insane 😳
Oh, yeah, no, that is absolutely deserving of a rethrow.
Herron had it way too easy. Gaunson got ripped off on the soccer ball. Stanford got the short end of the stick on items but he made the episode worth watching
That was a fantastic video
The umbrella was hilarious, but I think if you try to drop it again you should add a bit of weight to the handle to lower the center of gravity and try to keep it from flipping.
Great Video Boys keep them coming !
I am sooooo! Happy that your doing drops again thanks so much!
Gaunson was shafted by that soccer ball throw haha
Funny frat boys,made me laugh.
Beach ball drops at 13:16
The key for SpongeBob would be to let it smash you in the face while biting. I mean you’d have to have some mad skill to snatch it out of the air.
You guys forgot to throw the car off the cliff.
Mad!
7:54 Those people walking by must be very concerned about a guy throwing a pool off a dam, with cameras recording.....
Are you guys done with the Pinya's?
on of my fav videos. well done boys
Shave the stash
They way I GASPED at that tennis ball catch. Good job
Couldn't finish watching this... Just annoying
Was 21 secs
Gaunson got ripped off😡
Guud die is how Ausies say good day
Looking down the damn and seeing the drop gives me vertigo through the video 😭
Best one yet x
Herron was on cloud 9 until Gaunson got that pool catch.
This video Is awesome keep up the wonderful videos they always keep me on my toes!
look at those bug bites praying for you guys!
Heron seems to have some slant against Stanford. It’s weird to say, I know. The boys just seem a bit off their usual vibes.
I knew there was no way Stanford was catching sponge Bob with his mouth
Stanford should've counted down, but that was an impressive throw, I'm gonna give him a pass just for that
4:18 how are you from Australia and also worried about a bug that small? 💀 (only joking)
Nice beach ball. Fun times
Do raycon ship to Australia?
Unhook a roll of toilet paper and throw it off, that would look so cool!!!
16:24 this what 😭
Imagine someone got hit in the head and got knocked unconscious
dropping colorful toilet paper would look amazing!
Heron absolutely deserved that win. Not only get he get 1 object land on a building, one bounce of a cliff and one delibrately thrown in a way to mess him up, he also didn't get cheats, deals or the ability to strategize the easiest items for last. All that into consideration he got 5/6.
Can you construct a machine that will give a ball like 1000% berries for the magnus effect?
Stanford, you live in Australia and you're afraid of a little bug?
Just worked a 9 hr shift and I'm so happy to see this upload! 🙌you guys are awesome 👌
Gaunson was cheated
now i know what the sun is
Why is there no Tower stuff anymore? Have you been banned for leaving too much stuff behind in the sand? Too many Channel fans turning up?  Ran out of ideas? Covid outbreak? All the same, still entertaining and all the money you are now earning, I am sure it goes to Charity as you are all God loving guys.
Heron seems salty in these recent vids…
Stanford actually shocked me when he catch the ball like what😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤💯💯💯🙏🙏😅😅😅😂
as good as it gets
How
The fact that nobody thought to call it a "Rexercise ball" left me feeling a little hollow.
You guys deserve every good thing that comes your way, you’ve earned it and then some. Keep it up.
Me Angry 😡
Why is there a spider at 0:49 ??
These guys always do fun stuff but this one looks like one of the most funnest to do. Yeah, funnest, which is even better than the most fun.
Gaunson you dereved a re throw my dude. No count down at all.
thats not a laama thats a giraffe
I was guessing spongebob in the mouth. So close!
Angry comment.
Everybody gangster till an Aussie gets scared by bugs
I think Scott was screwed by no count down on soccer ball. I claim him the winner
the bug at 4:21 is called a mosquito. the annoying bastards are pretty bad where im from
"Cant get up there".... Trampoline right next to the building 🙃
Damn dam
The lama looks like a stuffed Johnson!🤣🤣💩
stanford bit off more than he could chew
These videos are so dam awesome!
When's the fly themed gear coming?
Y'all have the best job!
For the next hammer video you should smash a lot of giant morshmleo
I know my heads in the gutter but the color and shape of the llama looks mighty like a phalic and sac
I thought the bean bag would kill him, then when they through it off it was so slow lol
*You sure thats just a 'flesh colored llama?*
I get vertigo just watching this.
It would be awesome if you line-xed a water bottle and did the tallest bottle flip
Watching grown men throw crap from a dam and enjoying it lol.
You guys are awesome! Which dam are you guys at? I forgot 😅
Loved the pacing of this vid, felt more like your older videos. More personable. Don't get me wrong the newer content has been great but it feels like the pacing is a mile a minute
That was a horse fly
At 8:41 you can see a drone in the back
Every time you guys are at this location n I look down that dam I get that sinking feeling in my testicles…. Thanks for that 🤣
“One bundle of poo tickets coming up” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My music is awesome 😎
@9:17 I counted 13 seconds....
Gaunson was treated unfairly
Do it with bowling balls
100% Gaunsen deserved another go with the soccer ball - that was dog
Ridiculous
I do have a bean bag that is a lot bigger than that.
Good one!
that tennis ball catch was legendary
21 is not equal to 5 seconds
He did say in 5 seconds.
You ever watch the inflatable boat on Indiana Jones fall, myth busted..
Gaunson was absolutely robbed. A throw that late is essentially just a throw with no warning.
I love You guys, greetings from Czech republic!
Nice catch Stanford  10 out of 10
Glad you guys are getting the recognition you deserve
"Butt; Stanford is out" -2022 Colorized 18:10
They've almost done this too much, how are they so good at predicting where something is going and catching it as well. If I were them I would trip over myself while trying to catch them. 🤯🤦
Rexercise ball, it was right there in front of you and you didn't say rexercise ball
Instead of making the last item worth two points, let the opponents pick which item will be worth two points. This way you don't get people saving a gimmie for the last item.
3:32 Well, you got my dogs attention
Gaunson got raw dogged in a bad way
"Llama."   Uh......
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
“Llama” looks like a giant wiener. That is all.
As a Brit, cannot believe the audacity of Australians freaking out over European entomology.
Feeling the vertigo just watching
Love the Swiss dam videos!
You DEFINITELY needed a new shot for that mishap count
Stanford count next time out loud
Now y'all can drop the pool, then halfway down, chuck some other things after it.
Love this channel!!! So good but, incredibly skewed on object separation. I gotta go Team Gaunson. The pool and the football were tough.
No catch, still tied
NOT PLAY WITH BREAD GUYS THIS SO BAD VIDEO
Herron with the off the wall catch was premium, but N. S. Gauso definitely was 'treated' unfairly lmao 'Coming in 5 seconds'...waits 20 seconds then BEAMS is across the field lol
Those 500 bugs are fan of the channel! They just wanted to say hello! 🐝🐝🐝
Put the cameras down and have one person film while you run and catch the items
I first saw you guys a few years ago when you were last at the dam and I'm loving seeing you return
Next time try to catch an anvil - that would be a real challenge!
1:23 The man punted Baxter! Glad to see the Dam videos are back!
That singing was beautiful
Catch bowling balls
Good revenge Stanford from last weeks viddy
Yea
2:19
5 seconds?! Take a hike!
I got that pool in my front yard
Are you  guys still keeping the huge beachball? I would love to have that
I love the people just walking past them on top of the dam.
Do those little army men with parachutes.
They’ve done Gaunson dirty. 👎
I'm angry! 😅 That wasn't 5 seconds!
Hey skedadudler
That llama should be called Dalli
Her: he’s probably out cheating with other girls. Him: TODAY WE ARE GOING TO CATCH A GIANT BEACH BALL OFF OF A 165 METER DAM
That one was really fun guys! Great to see you dropping things again. How good!
It was a real pain to catch the baguette…
Watching you guys at the dam makes my day
Must be expensive to fly all the way to Switzerland like once a month
You guys are awesome thanks so much for the video!!!! Hope I get the pinni
"we are throwing everything" welp apparently not the car soooo
Nice one Herron
That Llama looks like a Hair Wanker and Beans lmfao
Love these guys. Just good wholesome content. And can I just give them a huge bit of credit for being deeply religious but never beating us over the head with it? I think it adds to the wholesome
So glad to see you back at the dam! Were you using your Australian GME UHF CB handheld radios in Switzerland?  You might want to check you aren't interfering with anyone else, they most certainly don't use the same frequencies for CB in Switzerland .
U guys are spending so much money to make good vids ATM, but if I'm being 100% honest, I'd much rather watch U guys drop shit off the tower and destroy things.....
Yes serrrrr
Australians annoyed by... bugs?
First!!
these are so hard to watch after noticing the bugs....
21 does not equal 5 and that's all I'm going to say
She tails her Dad
even catching a basketball from this height can break your wrist be VERY careful with what you try to catch
Eye protection?
2:17 lmao lets out a lil squeaker. "ooo tooted"
Unless math has changed recently and 5=21, then I’m gonna have to say that Scott was treated unfairly.
Stanford's a cheat and a sore loser!
He should have chunked the tennis ball to get him back for the soccer ball
21 sec
only the og's remember they always say we'll pinned ya
Herron looks like Brad Pitt's character in the movie Inglorious Bastards!! He should learn to talk with a southern American accent for the next video for a good laugh 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love how Herron stumbles, tries to recover, then just goes "frick that" and tosses aside the GoPro on his last catch
Hello
I would love to see who can catch the most nerf vortex that whistles maybe 100?! off the dam lol
How come HR are in Australia promoting Raycons, but I can't buy them in Australia? I've been wanting to get some Raycons for over a year, and still can't.
When he caught the Llama it looks like boobies popped out of his shirt.
The pool hit the ground come on man
The next  video they need to catch darts from the dam
This is what I imagine Heaven is like. Having a jolly good time with the boys❤️ God Bless you three!
The next video: catching darts from 165 meter dam
All your ppl have no thumbs.Whats going on?
This video was ridiculous.
that horse fly wouldn't leave him alone
Throw the anvil
The real winner is Bret for his jumping catches, and deal making.
That wasn’t 5 seconds and u know it so stop cheating
eeehhhh. guess what! I was watching this with Raycon everyday earbuds in my ears. i use them all the time. AND THEY ARE AMAZING. everything u guys were saying was true
Magic at the Dam. Stanford turns a baguette into a donut before your very eyes
Snagger???
I feel like, out of the 3 of them, Herron is the least athletic looking one, but is by far the most athletic of the bunch. Haha.
Should have made the tie-breaker as they both have to face away from the toss-out for the first 3 or 4 seconds.
Bring back the off-white front tooth.
21s does not equal 5s.
Gornson got robbed.
Never seen Aussies more scared of bugs then you blokes haha
Gaunson should get the soccer ball one for sure
21s
Try to drop pillows perfectly on a mattress
Gaunson got shafted over the soccer ⚽ ⚽ ball he deserves the point!!
Ever tried launching stuff from the bottom of the damn to the top and catching it?
With Guanson. Definitely the raw end there… but maybe if you stopped talking for a moment you may have seen it come over 😏
The toilet paper was majestic
I love watching these videos.
Love the videos but i do have to say that Gaunson definitely should have got another try.
nice       :)
Stanford why did you not count!?      Gaunson should get a point just for that
Hey again bro
Was it just me or did that “lama” look like a ****
Everything? Even the car? Wow! I'm stoked! 👌
I was mesmerized at the fact the bean bag fell at such a slow pace. That was pretty cool.
Gaunson was robbed.
The final catch with the exercise ball didn't count it wasn't caught on the full
Gaunson got gipped HARD
I must say I appreciated the brief picture-in-picture on this showing both perspectives. More of that would be cool!
No bowling ball or anvil
I like the Freddie Mercury mustaches
Herron: About to catch.  GoPro: *Yeeeet*
Gaunson was robbed!!!!
I’d say that more often that not, despite all the rule changes, deals, charity and tie breakers, the one most deserving tends to win and today that was certainly Derek Herron.
Scott was treated unfairly
Imagine being Australian and afraid of a lil Swiss bug.
Great video but I don't  trust any of there sponsorships now after they deleted the video of the mystery box sponsor they did
5 seconds > 21 seconds, yea seems about right.
HR: when the camera pointed at the sun Me: aaaahhhhhh my eyes!
I find your insanity infectious and refreshing when my mental health takes a dive, it cheers me up
Once again a fantastic video. Had me smiling and laughing the whole time!
That tennis ball catch tho!! :O
Your football throw went roughly 140 m (based on google earth measurement). I would really like to see you guys use range finders and calculate certain things, throw some more math in the videos. I remember when you were doing that for the tower drop and the return height of objects, it is missed.
Love catching videos
11:03 "My Gaunson stepped on a bee" 😩😣🤥
You know what would be cool and fun? What if you guys got a helicopter and dropped like 44 teddy bears in a football field and have ppl catch them for charity, they seem to come down pretty slow and soft. You could even call it like 44-teddy-drop 2022 or something like that
Scott was robbed. He should have at least gotten a re-throw when SOMEONE didn't give a proper countdown.
I just did a big lion king play in school and by the way love the videos
Still waiting for you guys to drop Swiss cheese from the Swiss dam.
Love these DAM viddys!!
the TP looked strangely beautiful... maybe try again dropping a rainbow of tp
great vid guys ...peace out
Drop a dam of a BEACHBALL
No offense but y'all mfs are cheeked tf up
Yeah big G got stuffed! You gave it too many berries! lmao
Anvil. C'mon boys, catch an anvil. Double points for teeth.
So there is not just a Llama in my living room, but  Llama at the dam as well.
Hakuna Matata for the win!!!
don't step on that bee
Guys where is this place ? greetings from Greece
so if there was no dam these guys wouldn't have a youtube channel.
GoPro's are expensive.  Catching Wilson off a dam after it bounces off the cliff is priceless.
Lucky a penny didn't fall out of anyone's pocket, lol.
FLEP MAE!!!! 😂🤣🤣
where's the We'll Pin Ya meme?
15:05 that song choice was really the only option in that situation.
The pool touched!!
The water level behind the dam is so much lower than the last time they were there.
You guys should BASE jump th
Did he just not know what a mosquito was
BA
Why you gotta raw dog my boy Gaunson like that? It's too easy to tell that soccer ball throw took way longer than 5 seconds, especially with all the editing in between "throwing in 5 seconds" and the ball beating thrown. I demand a recount!!
That pose at 18:10 could easily be a merch design... Epic effort!
It would be cool to take a slingshot and throw some bearing balls, lead balls, bolts, nuts, nails, glass marbles, rocks and other light, high speed stuff at the targets. Perhaps some throwing darts, a blowgun and a simple springer 4,5 pellet airgun to see if it goes supersonic.   =)
Frazzledrip on the v-ball
10:49 I'm dying 😂😂😂😂😂
The best way to watch these videos is on mute.
That's not a llama... Looked like a floaty willy.
Australians are hilarious when they're in other countries and a bug touches them... because every invertebrate in Australia will and wants to kill you
👍
Gaunson got a bad deal it came 21 seconds late with no count down Gaunson won this game.
That ball fell faster than my view count 🤔
What dam is that?
Gaunson was definitely robbed.  The soccer ball is small enough you have to see it get thrown right away to know what's going to happen.  Also absolutely loved Herron's catch off the cliff, but I feel like it was equal parts luck and skill.
rexercise ball
It’s gonna be a good dayuh!!! Love these guys!!
The "llama" looked more like Dr Evil's Rocket! I shouldn't be watching these guys, I am nursing a hernia waiting for surgery......laughing is going to send me to the ER.
massive BS on the footy
4:19 I think thats a horsefly.
Seventy five years young and loving it. 👌
Not everything went over the dam, you forgot Scott.
0:13 Anybody else just thought for a seconond, they're going to throw the car over the edge as well?
I don't wanna see any hand assistance, this is all mouth and teeth. Says the guy with the most suspect tash since the early 80's.....
That Llama is quite sus🍆
Just when I was beginning to worry that one of you were going to get injured with the falling debris, I see... fluffy stuff falling at  0.3m sec, and an actual wait time for said object to arrive at the bottom of the dam, fears alleviated. Plus, 'tickling the grass' is an unexpected, yet not unwelcome phrase of the day
-  👍 👍 🔧 -                                             👀
Yinz look like AFL material to me 👍
Why was there a random Asian guy?
Brett get for the most stunts. Scott great job dude, but Heron wins
lol gaunson got screwed
Awesome catch from stanford  to keep himself in the running after that fail with the beach ball but still an awesome roll over it love all your content boys you never fail to make me laugh and smile you boys are the highlight of my day much love and respect to you boys ❤
Great video,  but I'm surprised 3 guys from Australia are as freaked out by some bugs as you were!
I hadn't seen Derek's hair since he adopted that face-caterpillar - did he get a side-job as an old-timey soda jerk?
I subbed
I don't know why the boys were so surprised by the swimming pool. Indiana Jones did that with a raft almost 90 years ago from a lot higher up, and he was just fine.
"Poo tickets"  Never heard that.
I’d love to see an American football quarterback throw a ball as far as they can from the top of this dam.
No not fair 21 seconds isn't 5
Gaunson did pretty good catching the TP comet.
That's a rexycise ball you made
How would this be different if it was girls throwing stuff off the dam and catching it ?  Would it be as much fun?
We need a whole video of different types of rolls off the dam 😂
This was the funniest episode you guys have had in a while😂😂
About 1:36, what does the Llama look like to you.
Scott was treated unfairly
Very cool viddy
THROW A THOUSAND TOILET ROLLS OF THE DAM!
"what if I catch it in my mouth?" me: "definitely yes. it's worth it just to see it if he wins."
That cousin molesting mustache tho
Stanford now knows the true meaning of "Hakunamata" with that incredible catch! lol (And Gaunson should have had a second chance with that soccer ball throw, just saying)
It’s not a beach… there’s not point
Welcome back to Switzerland lads !!!!🇨🇭
Stanford could work for the government with those math skills
21s is FAR too unfairly far away from 5s!
Scott should get a redo with the ball
That was an amazing video and as always awesome content on this channel
Don't buy raycon, they're immensely crap in basically every way. Iv tried every version so I can say that from experience.
Exceptionally entertaining viddie, boys! 😎
their videos are so much fun to watch bro
Dam this is getting old
Love the chaos that is the Rexercise Ball in flight, great final drop item!
Poo tickets 🎟
Gaunson deserve a rethrow and and a less powerful one because that was not fair     He didnt know   He didnt say 321     And it went into the woods
Some great catches but 21 seconds boys? Robbery!
Pretty low water level there
What happened to all the water behind the dam?
This is the best place to drop things
17:27 (qual o nome desse personagem para vocês?) what is the name of this character for you?
Dislike mr late countdown
Wow you screwed him
That umbrella made me want to see what would happen with a vented umbrella with the 2 layers, but with a small weight attached to the handle.
Oof. Fingers crossed the Mouse doesn't  copyright strike ya for that, sorry, god-awful rendition of a particular song.
You guys are so awesome! What a great life full of fun! God Bless!!
Hilarious video guys. Glad to see y’all at the Dam again.
Skills. I am guessing this is a lot harder than it looks
11yrs and 11.6M subscribers late and I'm just now learning about you guys! This is seriously the dream! 3 grown men breaking things and throwing stuff off high places. It can't get any better than that! I'm hooked! 😆    BTW, are you guys still doing charity like you did all those years ago?
Heh
i love you vids
This a Dam soccer ball travesty!
sup guys its 8 51 am back home
how much is the drop in feet
After years of waiting and since i'm subscribed i was hopping to see you back here in Switzerland. Unfortunately i didn't get the chance to meet you, and I'm near to the location. Love your work!
wow that toilet paper's unraveling looked beautiful
See if you can get the toilet paper wrap up dance to spread across Tik-Tok
All these guys looks like dehydrated dogs with their upper lip all weird
21 seconds after the 5 second heads up? I'm with Gaunson, that's outrageous, the difference between when he expected it and when it was thrown is over 3x the original given timeframe. For all he knew, something interrupted the throw. Even when Gaunson dropped the duck, he did so knowing full well that Herron would have time to react to the trajectory.
So that llama... Not at all phallic... Thinking an Always Sunny reference
I still haven’t figured out, do they live in Australia or Great Britain? Imagine it’s the US
The left handed tennis ball catch was killer.  And I was impressed at how close the Sponge Bob was to a catch.
"feel free to get angry because i am" hahaa that was unfair!
Herron get catch on you ducky
I have been watching since 2016 and now seeing how much this channel has grown over the years brings a tear to my eye ;)
you come from Australia where everything try's to kill or eat you including the plants and you freak out in Switzerland when there a little fly on your leg lol
Ok
44 minutes after release!  That’s the really 44 club 👍 Loving your work Bruce’s (I’m a Nigel, if you didn’t guess) 😂
You know someone's gotta ask this: Harond why do you look like Martin Riggs from the tv series Lethal Weapon?
Make more videos with the yellow exercise ball 😂
I think one of you could ride inside that swimmy pool!
If anyone was watching using their Raycons they probably burst an ear drum on "Circle of Life"
The Mary Poppins was such a showboater 😁
That's a nice volvo 😏
21 seconds should have been the tiebreaker for a Gaunson win.
that left handed tennis ball catch was just spot om great video guys.
*posted 44 Minutes ago* Noice 😎
The fairest way to divide things amongst a group of kids is to let the person who has to pick last to divide up the things . This way they will be assume that they will get the share nobody else wants so they do everything they can to make sure all the shares are fair.
Gaunson was 100% wronged, it wasn’t a 5 second countdown, a few seconds either way would be reasonable but 16 seconds out is too much, VAR has spoken
Guys do not get the raycons, mine only lasted me 6 months till the left ear phone just stopped working, I have air pods an the quality and the life span is far better, Yer there more expensive but u pay for what yu get, plz trust me
Haha makes me laugh you guys have basically every insect/animal that can kill you in Australia but worries about our Swiss bugs 😄 🤣
Finally an out-&-out footrace decided the contest.
Herron deserved that one after making that insane catch off the cliff 👏👏
5:46 “poo tickets”? 🧻
Back 😇
Love the Dam!!!!
Shoot 21 seconds, def doesn’t count
The umbrella and soccer ball should have been a redo IMO
No anvil?
You could never do this in a dam in the USA.  Lots of post 9/11 security protocols.  I suppose the terrorists won’t mess with Switzerland.  Such is the world we live in.
44
Best merch I’ve ever ordered. Thanks for signing my new Rexy!
Drop Rexy from the dam
HI YOU GIYS I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS KEEP UP THE GOD WORK BOYS
It's gratifying to see a couple lads from Oz freaking out about bugs. To be fair, if that happened IN Australia, they'd be dead now.
Do a video of you sliding down the dam XD
Demo Matt 44club
Tennis ball catch was very impressive.
Why does the lama look like a giant todger? 🤔😂
Have you guys ever thought about throwing yourself off somewhere? Get a wing suit and a parachute.
Hi I love your videos
Drop a phone
1:10 I’m no expert but that ladder seems way to small for the dam….
You boys must have played some few overs... Even the suggestion of a lefty is ostentatious.
The umbrella looked like cgi even though it’s not 😂
Dam, love these videos!
Today I went to the dam and it's crazy huge seen irl, all these camera angles just don't give the right idea of how truly ridiculous it is to throw stuff down or catch it! Can't wait for the rest of the vids from their Swiss trip
great video with the mute on
This video was 100% awesomeness in every way! Thank you, you guys are THE best! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻✨💛✨🙏🏻😘
when are we going to see you guys base jump off the dam and play a game with yourselves in it?? thoughts??
That was a dam good video
Fun video! The dam is a lot of fun!
you should do a paper airplane compitition off the dam
Heron’s mantra: “If you ain’t cheatin’ you ain’t tryin’”
I wanna party with these clowns
Gaunson was done wrong! 🤬
And a Giant rubber band ball pls.
Next Video..... "Catching Watermelons and Bowling Balls from a 165m Dam"  I Would pay money to see that XD XD
when did Herron visit the 80's? I heard they want the tash back. You guys are so entertaining. binge watching you guys. I should probably go to work one of these days though
My dog was awfully interested in the squeaky rubber ducky drop lol.
Hot tuna frittata
Why don’t they drop from the tower anymore?
You guys are constantly upping your game. It used to be from a super big tower back in Australia now it's a massive dam in Switzerland! No pressure, but I can't wait to see what your doing in a couple of days time!
Nothing wrong with the orange soccer ball chuck, he did say 5 seconds.   If you hadn't been a party to cheat Standford in the previous video I might say you get a mulligan, but no.      Thanks for your content.
Best dam video I ever saw!!
We always love your viddys! Great catching, and y’all are sooo funny 😆
Can you throw over a r.c car,bmx,space hopper next
Scott was cheated by Brett, and should have won.
Shibby rexy
Do these guys have a season ticket to Switzerland or something?
Great video quality
Absolutely killing it! ❤️
Sold it the recon ear buds with that catch.
Stanford with a very impressive effort! Gaunson was treated unfairly on the soccer ball tho!
Who gets to catch the anvil?
3RD UMPIRE on that pool call!
Keep up your amazing videos!
That’s a llama for sure
That "lama" sure resembled a gentleman's sausage.
That tennis ball catch.. top job!
Drop the swimming pool and try to hit it with bowling balls and other heavy things that’s a video! Lol
10:33 oh I am very angry for you
Great catch there from Herran
That is the best dam video I've ever seen
More dam videos dam that’s 2 dam videos
love this vids
"Llama"
Here at 30 min when the video of uploaded, the 306th comment, here at 2.9k likes, and 33k views
Don’t know how hard it would be but how does chipping a golf ball off the dam and onto a green and in a hole sound? Huh? Up for another full day on the course like the slingshot hole in one?
Happy to see the dam
How often do they go to Switzerland?
Fun to see you guys doing stuff at the dam again. 😀
This is the best dam content
I kept waiting for the bowling ball catch...maybe next time.
When he caught that tennis ball I screamed out loud and scared my pets. 😂😂😂
Well Gaunson sounds like to me you need to be on your toes a bit more. Not like you were going to catch that monster of a throw anyways 😂
The umbrella didn't touch the ground
they should drop bowling ball with pool just to troll him
This video was a blast to watch. I had my grandson watch it and he loved it as well. Keep up the work guys.
Scott definitely got screwed.... bad throw on the ⚽️
You guys must hold the record for the highest catches of all time 🤯
21s is not 5s!  Give Gaunson a retry
No golden goal Smiled throughout, will give it the 👍 But, not ending on a catch …of anything….? Give y’all a pass on this one
Scott got hosed! Told 5 seconds and Jack shows 21 on the edit!? I'm pretty sure Scott would have gone 100% no doubt had he known the ball was coming in 21 seconds rather than 5...
You should throw the pool and then see it you can throw items in the pool as it is falling since the pool stays upright when falling.
The absolute irony of Australians being afraid of Swiss bugs.
The air resistance on those has quite surprising. The math says that they should have about a six-second fall-time but they're usually doing half over that if not more.
I'm always excited to see a new HR video, but since you're back at the dam, I stop watching whatever else was on and immediately click!
Gaunson definitely got the raw end of that soccer ball throw.  Even if he had the countdown there was no way he was catching that and should have demanded a rethrow.
Love the videos with the dam
So at this point I'm guessing that the commtest, "we'll pin ya" and "get the bell on" are just gone forever?
"everything is going over the edge," and then there is me wondering why they are also at the top.
So fun to see the lads at the dam again! Keep the videos coming
I would love to see you guys throw disc golf discs off of the dam! that would be amazing!
I don't know what's better: Brett's one-handed lefty catch, or Derek's mustache 🤔 Let's go 44 club
14:17 "The left hand needs to do something special here."  No catching aids allowed!🤣
The person throwing should get points for every catch as well. That way the person throwing tries to make and valid effort in every throw.
Harsh 5 second rule!
He caught the pool 😂
litterly watching this using raycon earbuds XD
That was definitely a cock n’ balls not a llama
That baguette had a little of the magnus effect at the end there.
At 2:35 if he'd have used the trampoline he could have gotten up easy
Let's w a moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his contact to entertain,,"♥️🙂
Y’all need to do bowling ball versus ballistic zombie torsos
In general you didn't scream nearly as much this time and I greatly appreciate that. Thank you.
Scott, what do you expect ? Stanford always changes the rules to fit him. Did the same at the stadium. I believe he said majority rules when only two voted on the rules change.
Go to Switzerland, moan about bugs on them.. Lives in Australia, film with flies on faces.. 🤷🏼‍♂️🤣
Cool
Not just back at the dam but back to content that makes me love em. Good show!
You guys should go to verbier and throw stuff off the m’ont fort zip line
One word: "Noice"
P.s. I have a pair of the raycon earbuds when listening to this video.
Oh dam
Yeas
Love the evolution of this channel! Manifesting old dreams…slow moooo..in Swiss damn..next up HR VR content
That catch at 5:00 was insane
That soccer ball throw was bs js
Love from south africa
Dam good vid boyz!
Scott should get a rethrow of the soccer ball with a proper countdown, also i love to see the dam vids.
Just throwing my Ballz 🏈⚽️🏀 off a Dam !!!!
The Umbrella should have been a Redo or Redo but with different item of similar size and shape. Since it landed in an Area that would be Considered Out of Bounds or Area that is extremely Difficult to get to Safely
Haha catching the toilet paper was hilarious!
Hey HR from MN!
Hi guys
The randomness about their vids is unmatched😂
Props to Brett for the left handed catch
17:30 this part got me laughing so hard🤣🤣🤣🤣 AAAAAAAAZZZZAABEENNYAAA dubidi dubideh🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Let's go! One of the best spots
8:25 it is a no catch, corner touched the ground
How does a ball fall for 100m and still catch you. Must be a Russian ball "In Russia you don't catch balls, balls catch you"
The lama looked like a floating dildo in the air 😆
Don't care, close enough. No reference needed!
13:16 If you'd actually like to skip to the title without staring at their atrocious mugs for 13 minutes.
You guys are hilarious! It's as if you literally can't fail to entertain! As always though, this one was awesome. Great work guys, keep it up👌👌👌👍👍👍💯💯💯👏👏👏
Thats a world record from heron thats the longest rebound  football catch
I'm surprised Youtube didn't make you blur the llama LMAO
Haven't seen anyone else, but Herron is having a day already!!  Herron off the ⛰️ hillside was impressive!!
16:24 what did he sayyyyyyy😧
Keep up the great work
Awesome video guys u guys are awesome loves ya guys
i'm drunk so i can't watch this right now........hello from Edinburgh Scotland, i'll watch tomorrow :-)
When is a baguette not a baguette?  When it's a donut.
Scott I agree
The soccer ball throw didn't count in my book
I have to watch on mute because the girly screaming and general hollering like a bunch of jocks is a bit much.
The view is gorgeous tho. Those greens and blues
The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway would be an awesome place to potentially take advantage of gravity ; )
“Yeet it”
Stanford going over the giant beach ball was hilarious😂
I mean 21 seconds is not 5 seconds seems unfair
thats a dam big dam
Attach a weight on some rope to the  umbrella  and then throw it of the dam undeployed and see if it opens up like a parashoot
Great to see more of your outdoor mayhem! Keep it up! :)
Finaly a good old challange keep the good work up
You should do more comtests
I was airborne in the military and i still wouldn’t go anywhere near that edge
damn buys you all make me wanna do all these super crazy and exciting things
Australians being freaked out by a tiny mosquito?  Like…..you have stuff that will murder you in your sleep and a couple of bugs is where you draw the line???
Your the best yuutuber
Damn
Frozen chocolate related items. I have ideas im curious where you can go with it
Dam that was cool
Never seen Australians this afraid of bugs.
Not EVERYTHING over the side! We need you boys!
🤣 to the toilet paper dance...that was a great viddy boys. Made me actually smile and laugh a few times!
Monster throw
U boom in every video
Oh boy, did that squeaky duck set my dog off at 8am.....
You should see hang things from the umbrella and drop it
My new job I drop bags off a 2 story platform, now I understand how challenging it can be to hit a particular spot lol.
Herron Is SOOO Good At These Chubby Athletisum 😂
I wonder if the pool would still fall so nicely if it was filled with something? Like water?
Ever since I started following, I'm team Gauson
The summersaults are why parachutes have holes in the middle.
194
It is a great day fella keep up the work
Give gaunson a retry
Scott should have an automatic point for that soccer ball
Even with a verbal countdown there was no shot that Gaunson catches the soccer ball
Dam good vid boys
1:34 for a split second that didn't look like a llama just after he caught it 😳😂
And the dumping on Gaunson continues. Anytime it's a competition Derek and Stanford either come up with some convenient or arbitrary reason why Gaunson should be decked or want him to fail under heavy scrutiny, while with the others it's like good job Derek, well done Stanford, for Gaunson it is I'm afraid I will have to allow/accept it.
I always love to watch their videos! I enjoy them and they always make me laugh God bless boys    And you too editor Jack Can’t forget about you
YYYYEEEEEEEETTTT!!!!!!!!
How's the weather been over there?, We've had around 30 to 32 degrees Celsius over here in England.
if you pin this it will make my day
That was close with the pool 😂 good job catching that
Imma leave this here so I get reminded of this when I get a like
That llama looked a bit rude tbh
When are we getting the 444kg PIN 📌
have you gotten a dam tour?
One video in Austria plzz!
Hi
I came in at first three minutes all I can say is how
I love this dam 🦫
Wow 8 mins after release!!
That toilet paper throw reminded me of what they used to do at football grounds way back when.
lol e you guys so much good vids
Hello from Alaska
One bundle of pooh tickets 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
Gotta give Herron props for that rubber ducky catch 😂
Love the dam videos!
They look ready for summer
Are you paying rent on that dam yet?
The dam is the best place they film at!
early club where u at
In the dictionary,right beside the word Amazing they should put a pic of you 3 guys😂
Why don't you guys use the tower at the gravity center any more?
how good
4:20 behold, Australians freaking out over bugs. you of all people? Australians? Really??????????
4:20 now that I know Australians are scared of my local bugs I can feel strong.
Ah, missed opportunity! You should have attached Rexy to the umbrella, and parachuted him down!
I’m biggest fan
Can you play giant pinball
love the channel guys <3
Were so glad you boys are back at the dam. Keep up the good work
The drop videos are always elite
Im a big fan and love watching your vids you should make a vid where you parachute down the dam wall but anyways thanks for making these vids
Go back to the tower
You should give Rexy a date of birth
Great vid.  Just  one question, Where are the commests gone? Plz bring them back. 🥺
You guys should throw really heavy stuff off the dam and watch it make craters in the ground
Anyone else have some random head of something blocking like half the screen?
145!!!

Hello Van munits mee👍🏻👍🏻
We love you!
Hi
How do you get to hell? Very simple: claim that you're innocent.  How do you get to heaven? Very simple: Admit that you're not Innocent, you're guilty and ask for mercy.  How to know if you're guilty or not? Simply: Compare your life to the Ten Commandments God gave you in the Bible. Everyone agrees that if people followed the ten commandments there would be no need for governments or police.  Do not lie. Do not steal. Do not commit adultery. Do not insult God by using his name as a cuss word. There are six more but let's just leave it at that.  How many lies have you told in your life?  Have you ever taken anything that didn't belong to you?  Jesus said, if you look at a women lustfully you've already committed adultery in your heart with that woman. How many times a day do you do that?  Do you use God's name as a cuss word? Would you do that with your own mother's name?  If you answer these questions honestly you know that you're guilty.  God can justly punish you and send you to hell.  Ask him for mercy. His name is Jesus.  It's as simple as this, The Ten Commandments are called the moral law. You and I broke God's laws. Jesus paid the fine. The fine is death.  Ezekiel 18:20 —  "The soul who sins shall die.  That's why Jesus had to die on the cross for our sins. This is why God is able to give us Mercy.  Option A. You die for your own sins.  Option B. Ask for mercy and accept that Jesus died on the cross for you. ..
Pls give me heart ♥️
How ridiculous!!
