WE ARE CLOSING IN ON 1 MIL SUBS PLEASE SUB! Also if this video hits 50k I drop a new story video this week!!
15:51 You could drop the items there to hold the plate
13:33 you actually could use lectern to trade for a powder snow bucket. so dumb i guess.
Bros first word in every video it looks easy from outside but inside it's filled with bedrock
You couldve placed the powdered snow on top of the netherite to stop it from moving then after that unequip the leather boots and they hoth walk through 16:16
They had 2 powdered snow buckets and leather boots. They could have just used it to build over to the circuit and break it. Then they could have just jammed the door and get out of there.
Bro items serve as a entity just use that
Bruh just throw an item on the pressure plate.
16:12 can't we use the powered snow to block those?
hes my cousin
fake
Me
Bro coudve put a  item on the pressure plate
Netherite isn't unbreakable. I would have tried to punch through it. Also, couldn't the armor stand have held down the button?
Damn the villager city built a villager prison

You know grox  made the prison
Bro you know grid made tjat

Hi hi guys I like your videos so everybody make sure you have to subscribe
yoo to let you know why didnt u use the items in your invintory in the presure plate
Seawatt you are smart
why cant you just break the netherite blocks at the end
Camman18 could never get past that level because there are so many birch signs 😂😂
all impossible prisons but they always leave items where you can find them...
Couldn't you have used the powdered snow to block the door at the end open, place another beside it, sink through the snow, and then walk out?
When they realize they could've put the bottle on the pressure plate XD
No need to comment because SeaWatt never answers
Bro hooooow r they still ur friends if they keep trapping u man?
6:02 *_what_*
they should've dropped item on the pressure plate and both go out
just throw the item
hoe aka grox mc is crazyyy

But you can't jam the door using the powder snow bucket?
Bro seawat got name revealed by teddy his name is jake
See what your name Jake is he said it5:56
Corn holes
4:52 Weird,they never mess up
you do know you could just drop an item on the pressure plate so both of you can just escape
I just realized couldn’t have placed the powdered snow to make sure both of them got out
That prison was crule and the end
15:46  Why didn't you put an item to the pressure so you can both escape from there?
6:03
4:53 DID HE SAY JAKE? IS THAT SEAWATT'S NAME?
16:07  use the item …
could they jam the door at the end with both powder snow?
FUN FACT: Villagers are non-playable characters (or NPCs), although the player can interact, but the player can't control them.
Hi ha
Bro could’ve just dropped any item to the pressure plate
"Aka groxMC" got me laughing😂
I love your videos
16:06 just drop a item on it😂
Bro u could just jam the door
16:01 why don’t Seawattgaming just break the netherite block with his hands??? It doesn’t matter if the block dropped???
Just drop a item
On the tnt room he could have stolen the sign and jammed the door making it possible to get both of them out
What if you “haaah” and then a door opened to the outside?
Respect teddy 🫡

16:25 you count of usd powdered snow

You could saved ted by putting powder snow between piston so it won't close the door and you had two of them so you could have saved both
😂
You could of dropped an item on the pressure plate.
12:34, Teddy's sugarcane goes from 12 to 18, how, unless they somehow knew they needed 6 more sugarcane and used their last sign to buy 6 more
Tady in tnt: guys yell supposed to drop an I ten 😂
BRING GROX BACK 😭😭😭
8:27 uhhh why is ken here
How about Evbo and grow?
“Sub to kenadian” funny joke😂 kenadian made this
why not take the lever on the leaves room where teddy was and break the pressure plate to replace it with the lever
bro just use the item frame for the boots
Can you do a 10 player prison
Your friends are terrible,  they awlays trap you
First time in history that an item frame is useful in a prizon.
10:42 could’ve used the boots and climbed the wall himself ,passing the boots to teddy(kenadian moment)
Ted could’ve came with you if yall had another sign you could’ve jammed the red stone door
Dear SeaWatt,  I think that you are absolutely moronic and could have jammed the door using the two powdered snow buckets. You let Teddy die for no reason. You are a murderer. So am I.
you could have jammed the door using the powdered snow bucket
does litteraly anyone notice how they traded the powdered snow for a lectern and lost it and then they magiccally got anotehr one to go and use the crafter
16:16 can you just put the spyglass on the pressure plate
why didnt u threw something to the pressure plate?
4:51 NAME REVEAL!?!?  Also, to whoever is saying fake and that he built it himself. Obviously you haven't watched Kenadian's Omz Debunk Finale, or read the dang description of this video WHICH CREDITS THE PUZZLE CREATORS.
I know i am writing it little late but i learned from other prisons that if you place a powdered snow in front of the netherite Block than it can not be pushed
Bro Just use disconnect Glitch in the First room and you wont need the boat Goofy
Dude you could have thrown a item on the pressure plate and then both escaped
Anyone in 2024?
15:50 bro just out the glass bottle on the pressure plate...
fun fact: you can use an item as an entity to activate a pressure plate
Guess what villages look like in real life crap

And evbo
2:07 where did the item frame came from
JUST PUT A ITEM ON THE PRESSURE PLATE

0 iq
They both could have survived by using the two buckets of snow to block the outlet while another waited on top of the pressure plate, so the piston couldn't rise and escape through the snow. So sad for MrRispole. LIKE👍🏻
According to my calculations 🤓 ahh video
Grox is back whit the milk
Why did u escape my prison:(
Try Minecraft bedrock edition
You couldve put the empty potion on thething and u and your friend couldve leave
10:35 how does teddy already have a bucket?
Bro just use creative mod🤌
yall could have just took the shoes off and placed the snow for yall both to escape
At the last you could put some item on the pressure plate and save both
Hey sewatt the puzzle in 4:30 with great understanding of game can get you have all of the buckets in dispenser you simply fell of to dispenser area grab all buckets or drop them if its too much then flip the lever by jumping and wait for the other person to complete puzzle
So why you didn’t just placed 2 powderd snow buckets so you could go thought snow and you will be 2 alive and escaped
ilurbdos
Better call grox
I’ll die from the lava and spawn at my home🤓
He's dead by now...
Cool video but sad
Bro just drop and item on the presureplate dude...
you can justn drop item on the plate
Bro that aint hardcore he can respawn
If they had the amor stand they could have just placed it at the button and both of them will escape
Well that ain't something that you hear everyday. How do you even press a lever? Its not a button. You pull or lift a lever.
Bro seawatt why did you put the furnace instead of the itemframe. the furnace could have been more useful 💀
they could have throw thier items on pressure plate
You copied eystreems video
Grox😭😭😭😭
Both of you have snow bucket can't you swim through it?
to activate the pressure plate just use your items
Bro I wish I could do this 😂
6:04 NAHHHHH
ain't no way he did grox like that😭
I won't like until you get grox
They forgot one thing the armor stand the armor stand that teddy had if they place the armor stand in the pressure plate they can both escape
if this comment gets 5000k likes i will give all of my money
Throw an item on the plate
Bro says impossible but then he breaks out
You are the best
Make more characters seawater to come
Seawatt could've given Teddy the boots if Teddy gave him the I item frame
at the end of the prison couldnt you just place your powdered snow to stop the piston to activate???
love your videos♥ and can u plssss do more prison escapes
10:05 seawatt,you could have used all that lava to kill zombies, but powder snow is okay as well
A hoe (Aka groxmc) 😭🤣🤣🤣
Before the lava dispensed teddy could of just dropped down and took the lava bucket, then use the fire glitch and get out with spare buckets, and when the water came down he could of just go to the edge of the obsidian and took the bucket then when he swim up he could of taken the water that was down the little drop. SUPER DUMB...
The fact he could have used the powdered snow to jam the part where 1 can stay
Is grox again
teddy could have thrown you the item frame and you can do the glitch with the leather boots
Nice yugioh skin
When you remember Teddy
I like how u could just use the boat to break out
I love the  " Oh no" When the lava started rising.
They could just put one of there items
Bro... 16:00 u could use your powdered snow to block the netherite blok...
just put an item on the preasure plate /:
He had a armorstand
Grox was outside?
They could just threw an item😅😅
Imagine if there was grox
I thought grox was gonna be there cause of is “relationship” with villagers, especially baby ones 😂😂
couldn't u have just dropped ur snow bucket on the pressure plate at the end?
You're name is jake
Nah at 6:03 bro did Grox dirty💀💀💀
Can you shoutout to Kenadian bc he is so crazy lol like debunking and glitch
If you put a item frame under a pressure plate, it will bug it so once you step on it, the power from it will stay the same until you remove the item frame
Why didn’t you just drop a item on the presser plate
15:46 you have 2 powder show buckets. You could’ve blocked off the exit with both of them and have the the second player walk through the powder snow
4:23 this gave him a whole new perspective and allowed him to see some droppers he could’ve have seen before
3:51 why not break the prysmarine slab and get access to the dispenser that placed the water? It presumably still has the empty bucket in it too and having a water bucket makes the rest of this puzzle much easier
Jst drop an item on it and then both flee
yo cen thro  yor amte glace pochon in to the prachr plat
wai did tad pov dide
or they can take the armor stand put it on the pressure plate that they both had to be on then grab it through door and use the powdered snow to block up twice and place the armor stand then walk away with 2 powdered snow
there was an imposter face at the top of the sus room
In the end why thid you not drop you're item in ta treasure plate, and you and Ted must out😂😂
When Teddy exploded that made cry alot
at the end: one must be left behind me: THROW THE ONLY ITEM YOU DONT NEED BRUH OR JUST USR YOUR FIST TO BREAK THE NETHERITE also it would take  very looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong
he could just jumped back into the hole with his friend and both would have survived the explosion
WHY DIDNT U USE THE ITEM ON THE PRESURE PLATE
I would break prismarine slab and get water bucket
11:53 Top 10 Saddest Minecraft deaths
i love how seawatt could have placed the powderd snow buket to on the netherite block at the end and they would have both escaped
Your friend tried reactivating the lever to remove the lava
If your trapped in jail just remember:  Use f5 you see using f5 gave me a whole different perspective
6:03 uh
Both of them are so smart that they dont know that when you throw an item on a pleasure plate, it will turn on💀💀💀💀
can you guys use your items for the pressure plate?
They could have just thrown an item on the pressure plate and both would have escaped
Legendary
Bro isn't you can't to put item on
Couldn’t you have used the snow to jam the netherite piston door at the end
Groxmo: Bro what were you doing in my prison? Sea: _I'm here to kill you._
You can break furnaces with your fist
I'm pretty sure you could have used an item to keep the pressure plate activated but oh well because some items are heavier than the eye can see if that makes sense 16:25
kenadian about to kill himself oh my god
right of the bat i said right of the bat
16:12 you could just place the powdered snow and item frame on the netherite block so both of them escapes
Stop saying it is impossible
Seawatt at the start of video my friends trapped me in this prison Seawatt at the end who trapped me in that prison
I also noticed
They could’ve just place one item on the pressure plate and they both could leave😅
WHY YOU DON'T DROP THE ITEMS ON PRESURE PLADE
He could of just broke the netherite blocks with f3+t
F for teddy
put a item
15:51 just throw the bucket at the button
Bruh at the end they could just put a item on the pressure plate and they would both get out
you could just throw an item down on the pressure plate
They could also throw the telescope on pressure plate, because it could also active pressure plate. Then both of them could escape the prison 😅
8:27 / 16:27 it was kendadian look
Ted is a true hero 😢
just yoink a block on the pressure plate its not  a golden one so it works
15:50 can't you jam the door using the powdered snow?
just throw a item at the pressure plante in the last room
you could have used the item frame to hold down the pressure plate
R.I.P Ted... 😔
W to Ted for not subbing (yes W not L)
bro sea watt couldve gotten both people out by placing 2 powdered snow buckets at the end door both people could get out
You just can place the snow
It is actually possible to do a 5 block jump
“I was arrested, for not subscribing to SeaWatt”
0:36 spawn prot go brrrrrr
A hoe aka groxmc 😭
You could just throw an item to pressure plate
More plsssssssss gays
Didn't anyone notice that they were out of powdered snow bucket but they still were able to go get back and craft paper?
you could've dropped the items on the pressure plate bro
just a question, anyone know what skin teddy has?
I was so dumb you could’ve used the armor stand to put it on your door
This is good❤❤❤😂
Drop the item in the plesureplate in the end
You could’ve saved the boat at the beginning by placing it on the other edge and getting into it, you would take some damadge but you definitely would have survived.
Groxmc WTF
Just put a item on the pressure plate
just drop an item on the preesure plae and it would work
I SUBSCRIBED SEEWATGAMING
FAKE FAKER JUST ADMIT IT YOURE A FAKEY DONT TRY TO DENY IT
5 is posbbl wiv no efects
Bro is kind a god gamer. LOL
Their over sacrificing teddy but they could of dropped a item on the pressure plate so they could both get out alive
Drop a item in the pressure plate at the end so you guys can escape together
Bro please stop pressing shift if you checking some chest in the lava
He does realize that items are entities too right
Yeah they could have just placed an item on the pressure plate
16:08 why not just put powered snow on the door or just try to break the netherite block
You could of put the item on the pressure plate so both of you could escape
You can just drop the glass bottle to the pressure plate and escape 2 of you
they messed up when they forgot powdered snow can jam the door
There was actually a way for BOTH to escape. Basically, if you place powdered snow below you with a block above you head, while having leather boots on, you can crawl. Remember: they BOTH have powdered snow buckets and leather boots, so both of them could have escaped without any kind of sacrifices having to be made.
1:35 jump in lava and place the boat on bedrock 3:54 you can open the dispenser to take the water bucket  6:57 you can also take a water bucket 15:34 so we have 2 snow bucket use it to go to the tnt and break it also break the red stone LOL You can also go out on top I guess
you fakead that case you only had one powder snow that you usead for a lecturn so how did he he park core across and both your inventories dint have a second or you would have gotten free
16:18 just jam the door using powdered snow
😅 prison in minecraft ? For what ? You get to prison, so make a new one account 🤣🤣
explains why grox wanted to blow up the prison; it was a villager!!
Escape the villager prison and defeat all the enemies and spiders...
NOT SEAWATT CASUALLY CALLING GROX A HOE
IF YOU DROP AN ITEM ON PRESSURE PLATE IT WILL PUSH IT!
In 15:13, there is a method on how they both can escape: you can drop an item in the pressure plate instead of another player standing on it, so that way 2 people can escape without anyone diying.
They both could've sacrificed the glass bottle😂😂😂
10:26 item frame?
Teddys been arrested for not subscribing so many times.
Why did you not throw the item in the pressure plate?
Prison 🙅‍♀️ Escape Room✅
Noooooooo he says E_ EX_ P
Teddy could have just flipped the lever again to get rid of the lava
5:50 DID U JUST SAY (oh no no stop oh shi*)
Is it just me or did I over hear that seawatts name is jake
Bro, you could have just put the powdered snow between the netherite block at the end, meaning it wouldn’t close and you both could escape 😅
When you realise they could have used the powdered snow to keep the piston door at the end from shutting
We just know grow should be in there
Place an idem on the presherplate and you both leave
scripted but ok
he could have simply blocked the netherite with powdered snow?
1.but then I had very good idea, see using disconnect and connect gives you few frames of invisibility so you can easily swim in lava. 2. but then I had very good idea, I used f5, see using f5 gives you whole new perspective and you could check is there something behind the lava so you can use number 2 to find path and 1 to go through lava.
bro could have placed the powdered snow and they both would have escaped
They could have just dropped an item on the pressure plate and both could have eacaped😊
Chicknjoy oooon

fun fact you can swim to lava to death so u tp out
Reminds me of how I changed a villager house to a villager head as an orphanage which is a prison
both of you could have escaped, have one person stand on the pressure plate and have the other person place powdered snow in the doorway, then you both can run out
just drop a useless item on the pressure plat eso you guys survive
“Subscribe to Kenadian.” -Furnace
You could for the one must stay and then drop item on the pressure plate
Looking back after all this time, why didn’t one of you jump down in the previous room
Next time escape a real prison
I understood why grox is not inside 😂
Speed run! Die in the lava and you will be respawn in you house
I just realised SeaWatt could've put the powdered snow in the escape door to wedge it open for Teddy. bruh
Aka groxmc 💀
Bro I’m named Ted bruh
You couldve jammed the door with the powdered snow :|
couldn't they use the powdered snow to blow the door and walk through it?
Why didnt you just craft wooden pressure plate out of planks from village outside, and place it instead of blackstone one so you could drop an item on it and escape together?
run out, set spawn with a bed in the village, run back, switch places so the other person can come out, respawn next to the bed in the village. both gets out.
It was solvable They could have broken the netherite block that released the villager and could have collected armour stand
can seawatt and teddy put their two powder snow bucket on the door and it will rig the door and it wont close... bruh
10:30 you could reach him using bucket of powder snow and leather boots, then throw him another pair (he didn't have to craft armour stand)
so sasasad
Tell Grox about that
money is delicious
Seawatt : ITS GONNA BLOW Me : just bridge over with the 2 powdered snow buckets to the tnt so u can mine it
you know you could have just used the snow to break all the tnt, not causing a chain reaction and being able to also get blocks, then you could get out. Still geez I think teddy knew and wanted to be the main protaginist
Question why did you not jam the piston?
Sad ending 😭
You could of just throw an item on the pressure plate and both escape
Ho's Making These Prisons!!!
item lol
NO MORE  3 PLAYER + GROX??
At the end, You could have placed the powdered snow while the other one standed on the pressure plate, to escape both at once!
“Aka Groxmc”  my morals will allow this-
Can't you place items on a pressure palte to activate it and escape with teddy?
yeah theres no way out together lets just ignore that we could break the redstone by bridging with the 2 powdered snow and break the netherite block
Were was teds water bucket at 14:12
Yeah
Time 6:03 is super sus bro
bro forgot about teddy's powdered snow bucket cuz you could take off the  boots and then place the snow to stop the door
Why couldnt u just throw the glass bottle on the pressure plate in the last?
You could have used the snow and block the nethith or how you spell it
Hey try break out of prison what you just can’t escape at all just a small ass bedrock box of the Spencer of lava they can down on you at any time and it is so far up you can’t reach it
Bro could of just used the powdered snow to parkour up the wall to give the boots to teddy 10:20
yoy could just put the snow bucket on the presure plate
could have blocked the gate by powdered snow so both can escape
He could just throw the glass bottle then that way they can escape ez
you should of used a item on the presser plate
why ddnt u jam the netherite block with the powdered snow
my friends trapped me in a bedrock prison etc
Kanadian debunked you 😂😂😂
Place the snow in the door to prevent it drin closing? NO! Make a "very sad"Scene? yes why Not.
love how they both could have escaped because of the two powder snow buckets
8:25 it is written 'Subscribe to Kenadian'
Bro item drop on plates do trigger them
a ture firend
Seawatt video *starts*, Seawatt: "right of the bat..."
Why don’t you just throw the empty bottle on the pressure plate?
Yo seawatt can you friend me in Minecraft my name is Enderboi
Jamming the door with powdered snow left the chat
... is it bad I know there is a way you can escape with both of y'all?
Grox: dude what did you do to my prison-
An item is an entity lol😂
Wait wait wait wait Grox was the won dude take revenge for teddy
why cant just get the armor stand on pit of sacriface just break the block of netherite get down get armor stand and go back and put the armor stand to sacriface again💀 or go back the hole and wait to explode when its finish just break block of netherite and escape with no sacriface
4:00 if you get the right angle, you can mine the slab, and obtain the bucket in the dispenser above. This allows you to cheese the whole prison.  This allows them to entirely skip the leaves section, and other sections also.  But if you don’t skip the leaf section, that’s ok, since you can easily take the bucket out of the dispensers and use it on the slab at the top of the water  Did I mention that teddy can also pick up the water with the bucket he crafts a minute later  15:41 bro forgot he can jam the piston with powdered snow OR he could have grabbed another item from outside the prison to jam it  8:27 That’s some good advice right there  Love finding these lol
Teddy  Ues item frame with the boat put it above you to escape now
trader who name subrive 😂😂😂
could have used the armor stand
I love youre and teady
you couldve thrown the snow bucket on the pressure plate and both couldve ran out
can we just appreciate what ted did for seawatt?
12:14 NETHERITE IS A BREAKABLE BLOCK. punch it , it could take a while but it should break.
at the start you can place the furnace and the item frame and maybe jump on the edge of the frame?
6:04 omg I was not expecting that lol
I thought you hated kenadian
You just can trowe spy glass to the plate
rip tebby
i love how groxmc comes up and says what are you doing in my prison lol
NETHERITE HOE
You can throw an entity on the pressure plate and save Ted. YOU MANIAC MADE YOUR FRIEND SACRIFICE FOR YOU EVEN THOUGH YOU COULD JAVE SAVED HIM
Groxmc is in Some trouble…. 😅
Put item on pressure plate
I'm late but , I love this
SeaWatt Bro I Love Your Escape Vids
Bruh he can respawn😂
But then I had a idea. I used f5. See using f5 gave me a whole new perspective I saw the chest I couldn’t see before
If teddy crafted an bucket and you can find water magically and then you can give it back to teddy and he can do the jumps (𝓫𝓲𝓰 𝓫𝓻𝓪𝓲𝓷)
Bro just drop item on a pressure plate
why teddy didnt press the lever
U sold ur powdered snow bucket and then u did parkour with the powdered snow bucket
By the last bro just throw an item on the pressure plate and both can get out easy
ted could've just place The item frame at the falling lava and pass over it
If 1 placed armor stand on door it would had opened to
i think he found it who build this prison😂😂😅
6 mins 4 seconds into the video got me😂
The end is so sad D':
Subscribe to pay repects to teddy
He tedie is hiroobrin
At the start of the video seawatte could've just used that one glitch were you keep logging in and out of your game to get across the lava without taking damage, you could've also taken the time to break both of the netherite doors
Nooo teddy 😭
the people who escape the prison: 1000 IQ the people who made the prison: 69420 IQ

Stupid u can use bottle
This should be called an escape room not a prison, its not made to keep you stuck in there.
Is it me or did seawatt copy Eysteam or eystream copy seaswtt?
They could drop a item right?
wait could he of not went back down the bed rock thing you guys came up and stand back? to survive the tnt
grox is dead LOL
Can’t one person stay at the pressure plate, the other break the netherite block and then escape together?

I busted laughing when he said, "I needed to craft a hoe AKA GroxMc" 🤣🤣
Why did you not just put a item on the pressure plate 😂😂😂 then both of you would have survived😂😂
BTS is good ☺️
Brak the presshplate
couldnt u activate the pressure plate by throwing the bottle on it 💀
0:41 does teddy need to take the item frame too?
did u know u can throw the glass bottle on the presure plate tou let the door open
BRO TED DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE ITEMS
U could have kept and item on the pressure plate and then both could have escaped
6:54  why didnt he just try grabing the buckets from the dispensers after the water turned the lava into obsiodion and he cpuld get 2 bukets multiple ones acctually witch would allow him to collect lava and colect the water source above him giving him a huge advantage
5:30 "oh thats crispy" ☠
Seawatt trying to escape Grox:enslaving prison makers
'bro what are u doing in my prison' those where the last words of Groxmc😂😂 This video was actually so good. I love ur videos seawatt
me : why didn't you ran find some water to make him come with you
How do you renamed villager’s name
Bro can't you use the items you have to put it on the pressure plate to escape
gridstone
I will make the creator of this map get blown up with 1 million tnt and he being inside it trust me :) his computer will crash he will never get back alive
You could just throw a item right?
IS YOUR NAME JAKE I HEARD TEDDY SAY JAKE WHEN HE WAS TALKING TO YOU HEADS UP I THINK WE FOUND A NAME!
I knew it I knew it from the beginning I could only think of one person and that person is grix
BRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH  you can just throw items on a pressure plate to keep it activated :/
4:56 cant ted just pull the lever again so the lava goes away and then just put out the fire?
allot of things were exaggerated When the dispensers placed the lava, you could’ve just flicked it two more times. You can do a five block jump.
Just place the spyglass in the pressure plate and you and ur friend escape
Armor stand
you could have gotten the item frame that had the spyglass and place it on the pressure plate and let someone stand and it will stay activated and both of you can escape
THE DISPENSER WAS NAMED SUBSCRIBE TO KENADIAN
wait..... can item press the pressure plate?
Bro you got it we got 90k likes and you said 50K we smashed it by an extra I don't know how much I'm not that good at math but we passed it but I don't know how much but we got nine ticket lights and you asked for 50K post that story
He is right there just kill him#kill Grox_mc
With 2 snow buckets and leather boots, build towards the redstone and break some stuff. Build back and escape. Or can't you just break the plate?
Bro make another movie
Bro can’t you just respond or something
https://youtu.be/vgQUSiQOOms
"But then i had a very good idea i used f5 see using f5 gave me a hole new perspective and i was able to see a chest i couldnt have seen before." WHERE WAS IT
Items be like: Are you kidding?
THEY COULD HAVE USED THE ITEMS SO THE PRESSURE PLATE WOULD ACTIVATE..
You had so many Items to throw on pressure Plate at end
A
822 5 BLOCK GAPS ARE POSIBLE
Just break the piston and the nether rite
8:24 Sub to Kenadian??
I hate it when you do too people in a prison
Just use an item to activate the pressure plate so both of you can survive read a book😎😎😎
i have one question why didnt they place an item on the pressure plate? Its still an entity.
Never thought I would hear “I also noticed” so many times
they can just die theyre not even on hardcore mode but i guess it was worth it for a video
Bruh you could have used the spyglass
it was quite similar to eystreems
Then I had a good idea, I used F5 🤣
Cant they parkour with the powdered snow to break the redstone?
the could of used an item or snow
It would be very easy if you spawn with a stack of wood
post kenadian slander seawatt is a gigachad
My name is teddy 🧸
You know... you could have safely gone back in the hole and backtrack to safety anyone back up after tnt exploded...
Rest in peace Teddy
literally anything viliger related has something to do with grox
I thought the spy glass was a diamond joint
We had a piece of string so we went ahead and made an airplane with it.
What if you just die and you respawn at your base ?
you could just die to get out
just to say how did you assume the powderd snow!?!
Leave your Friend he's nuts!
Just throw the bottle or powdered snow bucket or spy glass on the pressure plate. Both of you would escape
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqM8tetZ-E2nqOxJDEs0XcA
He called grox a hoe
Just wondering can you put a item frame on a stone pressure plate so that it remains activated? I remember this is possible
Bro are you dumb? Drop a item on the pressure plate and y’all can both get out. 16:10
hmmm i am not in prison so i might be wanted weird.
Groxmc
Very smart :)
Pov: they just jump back in the hole and the tnt dosen't kill them
well u could've drop the item in the pressure plate
I would have used the glass bottle and escape
interesting
MrRispole blew up
This video is fucking staged cuz how the fuck did seawatt escaped with a very accurate method
could just break the netherite block  at the end
o7
YOU COULD JUST PUT YOUR GLASS BOTTLE ON THE PRESSURE PLATE SO BOTH CAN ESCAPE
10:12 how did he get his snpw back?
you could have saved the boat by placing it on the bedrock floor and getting in it
You could of just used the 2 x 2 crafting menu in your inventory. Just make an L shape with the sugar cane
Is grox a netherite hoe?
You could have escaped together: place the item frame on the pressure plate and block it. Both guys escapes. The end
10:54 You could have used the item frame Ted still has
drop something on it and the job is done
Is no one gonna notice that when Seawatt said the wooden hoe he also put "Groxmc"
6:02 Lol
I'm not subcbing
Jump boost 2 lets you jump 2.5 blocks, not just 2
Plot twist:GROX MC MADE THAT PRISON-
hi
BRUH JUST BREAK THE REDSTONE AND USE THE REDSTONE TORCH OT KEEP IT POWERED SO BOTH OF YOU CAN ESCAPE.
Who did it click this 👍
SPAM THIS ITS NOT A ❎❌MISTAKE ITS A ✔️☑️MASTER PIECE
the fact that he says all the prisons are “impossible” but he beats them
😂
16:25 bro what were you doing in my prison
When a dispenser dispenses water or lava, it is left with a bucket, if a dispenser has a bucket, it can suck up liquids when activated, meaning he just had to activate the dispenser again by deactivating and reactivating the lever f
I love your videos
Ay IT'S GROX
Grow scared me
dude. u should have used was the bottle to hold the exit
Ted had 12 sugar cane 1 little creative menu and a cut an he has 18
15:49 just ....... bReaK tHe neTheRitE BLoCk Kenadian would like to have a word with you
The knowledge in this hurts my brain😂
You could have just threw one of your items on the pressure plate so you could both survive
bad  loy  ka  may  i  tam  ka  😡😡😡
CRIES
You can throw any item on pressure plate and than both of u could escape;)
Why didnt he just put the glass bottle on the pressure plate to activate it so they both can get out
JUST THROW AN ITEM ON THE PREASURE PLATE SO BOTH CAN GET OUT!!
it was ovbiously grox
I watched this 5 times and forgot about it 😂😅
They could have brought the furnace with them
drop bottle or spyglass on the plesure plate to open the door. right?
the thing i like about seawatt is he turns random things and turns them into storys
seaWatt do u know evbo cuz ebo is twash
You shoulda dropped a block on the pressure plate at the end and ran out together
good vid, but at the end... couldnt he jump back in the hole that u came from and.. survive?
Ot surprised that grox owned it
Easy go to creative mode and break it .  Cuz why escaping i don't like hardwork let's download mods and turn Minecraft in a slavery simulator
Don't need to be dramatic he could just respawn
EXP?
for the last room you could use the powder snow to bridge acrost the lava to the redstone and then break it
he could of just flipped the switch and the lava would have sucked up the lava, and the netherite could have been mined up in 10 minutes to prevent the switch from having to be pulled, he then could have picked up the sticky pistons
I think there was  a say to get out both. Use the powdered snow for blocks above your head. Then just spam jump to the exit 🙂
i love ur vids
ik im late but u could have escaped with teddy...  You couldve  taken the 2 buckets and bridge to the glass and break the tnt so it wouldn't explode and then u could use the redstone to open that door
If they think it’s  impossible why do they leav this stuff for them to escape
Se 1 Ep 01 V-3.0
Teddy no my second favorite YouTuber why i will get my revenge and kill grox and his villagers
This guy is more descriptive than my science teacher
Deletes presser plate
U guys are smart can u ecsape my prison it has no ecsape
Just throw a item
Grox gonna die tonight
Cant he just respawn
Seawat In grox’s voice  Ayo nah bro you put us in that prison? Now you won’t live bro you’re dead now bro you won’t survive now 😈
JUST PUT THE GLASS BOTTLE ON THE PRESSURE PLATE
Teddy SACRIFICED HE'S LIFE FOR SEAWATT THAT EMOTIONAL MOMENT WAS COOL
Lol he called grox a hoe
Grox is the best 😂
In the pleasure plate
You can throw your item
Justt throw your bottle, since pressure plates respond to items that could have worked
RIP Groxmc
16:00 just place the bottle in the pressure plate
you have to use the spyglass to put on The pressure plate, this is a nice tip
The fact that kenadian helped him built this
10:31 you could ask him go give you item frame in his inventory and used the item frame trick again
i love ebvo
Congratulations on a great video! ☠ I know where you can get more than 99 free spins.Best choice. Nice Major win!💪💪..that Million from your neighbor..🔥🔥🔥🔥
God gamer more like smart gamer
It was grox
bruh that ending
Hhm this is kinda like grow HMMMM
The he said the hoe is grox 😂😂
you guys could have powdered snow to the other side, mlg to the glass and broke the repeaters. then collect the tnt and tower out together
this is fake.
Flicking the lever after seawatt go thru go burr
Ted have slab block....
compress it
Nooooooooooooo
Wait how did you have a snow bucket to go back on parkour if you traded it before??
You can drop item in the pressule plate
16:24 GROX?!?!?!
Fakeeeeeeee
Groxmc is dead 🤣
wait to learn more!
15:50 just break the pressure plate
just drop a goddamn item on pressure plate
he had an item Fram couldn't he have placed it and then grabbed it and still have had an item Frame instead of crafting aurmor stand
BuT tHiS oNe SeEmEd InPosSiBle you say that all the time. Get one that is impossible
Bullshit:  https://youtu.be/1XeMlU9fMCo
At 10:30 ted can drop the frame and  u can use it and save the armor stand as blocks and stuff
What the fu
I liked this alot but um didnt you trade the bucket how did he go backwards
Why didn't you just break the netherite blocks with your fist?
The end I do sad 😭😭😭
There is ACTUALLY a way for both of you to escape, let me talk you through it.So you had to stand on a presser plate to let the blocks go down and then you can escape but the other person can’t, so you may think, “How is there a way for both of us to escape then?” Well, you had the two buckets of powdered snow and you can walk through powdered snow, so this is the plan: Someone stays on the pressure plate and gives the other person the other powdered snow bucket, then they place the powdered snow buckets on the netherite block while it’s down and then that block keeps it down so you and your friend can escape. Still, good job on doing the rest of the prison
Hey what are you doing in my prison
The end, there was groxmc 😲😲🤣🤣🤣 16:
That was dramatic
I LIKE GROX . I HATE YOU
Ted : theres no other way Me : just use the items in ur inventory to activate the pressureplate
Teddy could’ve flipped the lever again and the dispenser would eat all the lava again
yuo could of just put the stuff on the plate...
You could have put the armor stand on the pressure plate so both of you could’ve escaped
Fake because 9:24 Ted crafted the bucket he gave seawatt  the bucket but then in the next Ted pov at 10:37 he still has a bucket but at 11:40 he doesn't then at the end he gets out but Wright when he gets out the tnt explodes but the timer wouldn't of gone off until later on explain that seawattgaming
groxmc
you could of just waited it out and went back in to the bedrock room and waited for it to explode before escaping.
Hopefully you can use some of the fire to make that two block jump
Oh now he's scared of the lover and suddenly he knows he should touch lever just yet dude seriously that makes zero sense
Right did it all good first try I think that's fake
Also you can use the furnace and then catch on fire and then jump and do fire damage to get above that three block jump
Just use the boat to teleport to the other side of the three block jump
Or you can do the log on/off glitch where you log on and then log off when you're in the lava to have a millisecond of invincibility do this repeatedly and while that you got across
So I found this trick out on Bedrock but I bet it works on Java if you place the boat in a precise Place usually at a wall and if you place a block and you place the boat on that block next to the wall the boat go inside the wall and you can go in the boat and then get out of the boat to teleport to the other side of the wall
Pressure plate allows any entity to step on it and the glass bottle was an entity idiots
"Bro.. What Were You Doing In My Prison?" "Looks"
THE END haha 😂
Grox at the end 😂
Hi hey
Get get try it uhh uh yuh and it's pretty fun when to startbut I'm going on this for this long enough to see a lot more than that?? I am missing something like a little
Bro I think he just go inside the prison it was supposed to be for the villager like dungeon because lord grox was making a prison for villagers
Hey you should have put a bowl mat there! ?
Drop the spyglass on the pressure plate not ted
Pro tip if you don't want people to escape, don't give them items to
Fun fact: Item frames activate pressure plates of all kinds :p 16:00
Random bro:hey what were you doing in my prison?  Sea pov:bruh what 💀
Make a creepypasta movie
There is another way bruh
You can mine netherite
15:54 U HAVE ITEMS THROW IT TO THE PLESSERPLATE IT HAS ACCESS TO IT!
Do you want enjoy in my server I have a tiger city
I hate grox
yooooooo
u could have gotten back to your other rooms since its bedrock
Why didn't they think of throwing a item on the pressure plate ir would be more easy to escape the prison lol
You can just place a item 😑😐
Yeah yeah you faked it
Bruh just put an item to the pressure plate and leave
I like the fact that they could use an item to activate the presure plate and they could escape both but they said nope i want drama
14:56  when you said suspicious I saw a agong us      When the sign said freind you said "partner"
hey [], you could have used the potion to use pressure plate so one wont stay
Where 81k not 49k or 5k 3k 4k 09k 342. ,o3939 .21123, 2 =- 99hlf of 50 = 49k 2232k or 1ken 3counter of k
JUST PUT OUT 5HE FIRE
Why did u put td on the pressure plate u could put in a item
When they made the armor stand, couldn't they have used an item frame to save resources?
how did you get a power snow bucket after trading it with the villager
10:16 secret 15:56 This is what he get for not subcirbing to seawatt :(
So close to 1m
LMFAO you do relize at least I’m pretty sure you can break netherite with your hand it takes a while but uh 🧐 that’s sus
Bruh how did teddy go from just a armor stand to a armor stand AND 6 sugar cane and there was a cut I mean that’s pretty sus
You could of used the powderd snow in the end door to let teddy out
This is an escape room not a prison  prisons don't give you stuff to escape :/
Everyone sees bedrock major sees with her heads
Grox Made the Prison
thats when they realized its minecraft and they could just die and respawn
Wait how does he know what Ted sees?
Bruh this is an escape room not a prison
s
Oddly enough the first thing I thought when I saw the barral my first thought was make a netherite hoe to get the achievement and then enchant the trident
10:20 , could’ve dropped the item frame down and had the boots pass through, then you got extra stuff
He didn't have to die. He could've just placed the armor stand
6:03 just violated my man groxmc
Umm u forgot to place that empty bottle or the bucket or just it doesnt work?
The beginning triggers me. All you could've done to get over the pit of lava was to jump in it, log off, then log back in. For more context, if you fall or jump into a pit of lava, you can log off, and when you log back in, you wont take damage for a couple of seconds. Also, if you can break something, like a chest, or a block, or whatever, DO IT, you might need it for later.
I’m not sure if this would have worked but he had items in his inventory couldn’t he had dropped one of the items on the pressure plate so they both could have escaped?
i ahve soething very clever. They had one nlock in their iventory right, place it on the pressur plate.
Ooooo GROXMC 👍👍👍👍
The presure plate part was all wrong putting an item on it pushes it
Grow!!!
U can just throw sptglass on prezure plate
You could of dropped the glass bottle on the pressure plate
He will re-spawn
1m subscribers is around the corner
grox: bro what were u doing in my prison
You know you just could of dropped a item on the preser plate so both of you could of gotten out 😭😭💅💅💅
I had a feeling it was groves prison, it was a villager prison
You could've just dropped an item to the pressure plate making it activate forever unless the item despawn so that you two can escape..
You could just do the powdered snow to escape all
Soo umm when is he going to respawn? I mean its not hardcore
I saw joofy loofy,s video and you said what happen to the player will happen in reality
Bro I guess it’s similar but still eh didn’t steal ur vid either that or I’m just in denial because I loved his videos since I was 5 😞
G-G-Groxmc ?!
Dude I can’t tell
UO GROX SUBUIBE GROX   .GROX. OK I DONT KNOW GROX IN GAME SEAWATTTGAMING
Good thing you weren’t in hardcore
R.I.P teddy
Seawatt shoul've just build up with the powdered snow ihigh enough and trew it to teddy,and teedy dint need to craft an armor stand
What beef do you and grocery have? I honestly like both of you your both good youtubers
Grox is now dead very dead
For some reason my nose started bleeding when I was watching this vid
WOW, the escaping videos have improved a lot since I last watched them（⊙ｏ⊙）
😎 cool
Put an item to save your friend
You do know at the last puzzle you could just drop the scope to the pressure plate so Ted and you can get out
You could just go back to the sacrifice pit and use the snow block to climb and use the armor stand at the end.
He could have put the bucket in the pressure plate
In the end you could have just leave your items on the pressure plate and both go
I had a very good idea, I used F5, see using F5 I saw a whole new perspective and saw this 8:24 Subscribe to Kenadian
Wait, GROX
Couldn’t u have broken the item frame holding the spyglass the put in on the pressure plate then stepped on the pressure plate then both of u could go?
Grocx back like :bro what we're you doing in my prisons Seaswatt didn't even search  Rip grocx
1:28 I thought he had to use the item frame to block the lava.
Wait the world isn't hard-core so teddy can just respawn right?
You can just drop a item in the pressure plate YOU DONUT
You say that about every prison
You could use the itrm frame for the pres plate
It’s three sugar cane for one paper you ⏭ it
Why didn t you mi Ed The netherite block at The end?
You two make my life so much better with your it minecraft prisons. Especially you seawatt. Keep it up
):<
#Groxmc
lol Just use the Glass Bottle to activate the pressureplate
the empty bottle : JUST USE ME TO OPEN THE DOOR !
Bro what were you doing in my prison
Cant you put blocks or something on the pressure plate
So Grox made that prison how rud !
Did you know you can put items on a pressure plate?😂😂🤣🤪
Grox
Who is smarter at minecraft? Kenadian or SeaWattGaming?
I like this
Why didn’t you just place the item frame instead of the furnace
They could go to the armory stand and after they collected it they would tower back up to the tnt room and place down the armory stand on top of it
In teddys room at one point it said subscribe to kenadian witch you should do
Another way to kill the Zombies is switching your minecraft main hand to left and left gives you 0.5 more range
He can just throw the spyglass onto the pressure plate.
Both of you could had escape, just tower up the on the bedrock walls with your bucket and break the tnt and escape.
bro why didnt you break the stone button so you all get out??
just place the bottel in the precher plate and u bothe
How did seaway get back the powdered snow bucket because he traded it for the lecturn
Bro just drop an item on the pressure plate
If you find the dispenser that says subscribe to kenidian then you will have eagle eyes so if you find it comment if you did and yea
You could have thrown a item on the pressure plate right
Actually you could have thrown a item onto the pressure plate and it would open up the door for both of you so
Ted will go down in history
Drop item on pressure plate
Wow there are so many other ways to do this but he uses one specific way to do it. SO not planned out
Lol, if SeaWatt knows almost all the game mechanics, there is NO WAY, he couldn't have thought about, THROWING and ITEM onto the pressure plate, then they both get out of there
"Bro what are you doing in my prison?" Got me.
Yo can i get map download for ur prison escapes maps they are so coooooo l
6:03 “Craft a hoe (aka GroxMC)” Your words costed your friends life 😥
Imagine if he missed the trident
‘Bro what were you doing in my prison?’ Top 10 quotes moments before disaster
Did anyone else notice the dispenser named Subscribe To Kenadian?
What i would've done is that i would've gone back down into the room and let the tnt blow up
This is so bad Made😂
Could've swam out of it with the bucket bye taking off boots and butting both of them behind the block
😢
OK I will
U always said is impossible but u did it
The end had me dying 😂😂😂😂
I swear, kenadian and seawatt have become really close friends.
in the lava leave part, you can literally flick the lever again to stop the lava and break the leaves with fire
it was a while before i realized they had to cooperate to get out of prison, using each others items
Bro you can place block in pressure plate
He could just drop the bottle
the end: bro what were you doing in my prison-  *oh how the tables have turned*
They could of just dropped a item on the pressure plate then they both could of excaprd
How’d you not lag in that explosion
Why didn't u just throw something in it the last part
Groox made it💀
Bruh if they didn’t put there spon point than they just need to die
i never forgive you tedy🥺
He doesn't realize that they're playing minecraft
You know sea you could place a block on the plser plate
Face reveal at 1 mil?
I like how seawatt and ted use the same voice they would use in a minecraft film
Use the snow to bridge to the tnt then break the tnt
Did they realise they couldve just flicked the switch twice?
Nice ending bro hahahagaga
How do you know stuff that's not in your vision lol faker
Fake
He could've just use the glass bottle for the last pressure plate
15:54 bro the cringe 😬
Just throw a item no it
Wow you made the ending so dramatic
Wait at the start should't you be able to place the boat at the other side? Idk
There were like 10 opportunities to get a bucket and they never did
U could have jyst dropped ur empty bottle on the pressure plate then u both escape.😕
At the end you could've used the bottle- he didnt have to sacrifice himself but ig its for story lore or stuff
Hey seawatt, the video was really cool and all but maybe if u actually tried an unscripted prison that wasn’t made by yourself you could get even more views even though your already rich from all your fake content!
Save the sand and castus from before and don't use the fishing rod, teddy will use the cacti and then use tye fishing rod to activate tye pressure plate and u both escape
But then, i had a very good idea, i used F5. See, using F5 gave me a whole new perspective and i could see a chest that i didn't see before.
"But this one seemed impossible" Never gets old
who cares if its staged, its fun to watch thanks seawatt
16:00 just put a  item on the pressure plate
'This prison seem impossible' says the guy who escapes this and others before
15:30 use another entity!!
At the end part drop items are entitys he could have just dropped the item and both left
And then I pressed f5
Hey group is cool man
Couldn’t he have just put an item on the pressure plate
@Kenadian pls come here show her ur 1000 iq
Huh
You could have put one of ur items on the pressure plate
is it the awakening SMP?
I heard teddy curse
10:35 bruh he have a item frame
Please escape a prison with kenadian it would be hilarious
U can just dc and join again to get past the lava
SeaWatt: promises to find out who put them in the prison Still SeaWatt but at the beginning of the video: "my friend trapped me in the prison..."
atleast ted died and its not hardcore right?
the number 1 saddest anime death 16:00
But then I had a great idea and used f5. You see, using f5 gave me a whole new perspective.
escapist lore
If you were faster you could go and change the pressure plate to one made of wood and trow some item
The dispenser likes kenadian
It looks like there was an exit at the top of the TNT room, I think Teddy was supposed to use the powdered snow climb trick to get up lol
I need to craft a hoe ( aka grox mc) 💀💀
MAN JUST CALLED GROX A HOE LOL
in the beginning u could just use the 3 sec invincibility trick. you could have saved the boat...
Just throw a item on the pressure plate at the end.
This is dumb just use f5 see using f5 gives u a whole new perspective and it will show u a sign saying drop a item
Disperser: Subscribe to Kenadian
1:08 just start disconnecting and each time you reconnect you get 3 seconds where u cant take damage so if u do it right u can get pass the lava without needing any items
Kenadian: (died in lava)
you could of just placed an item or the powdered snow on the pressure plate so you both could escape
You need an item and drop it on presure plate
You could have just put your empty bottle on the pressure plate
At final just use the armor stand
Fgg#Gamerzking
U can actually drop the snow bucket in the pressure plate RIP TEDDY
Fake
He has an item
how are they your friends if they trapped you in an escape room oh right they told you the parts of it that they created using some minecraft features but there is always a way to do it without those features
U can just drop item...
Hi pls subb to meet good story tho ;)
SeaWatt why does it say Sub to Kanadian? isnt kanadian the guy that says ur prison escapes are FAKE?
You could have the duplex eight item on it
Why didn’t you though a item on the pressure plate
Can't you put itoms on pressure plates
The fact that you could throw an item and turn on the pressure plate.......?
Fake
Ted set on pressure plate, you escape, he hide back in the bedrock area, then after the explosion, he get back up, mine the nethertie will bare fist or your help after grinding some pick axes
Seawatt, there is another way, to both survive
It sure was fun to watch! But the ending was a bit cringe knowing that you can just respawn lol.
CMON You faked again or i got confused. 13:56 how the hell did you get that bucket of powder snow, when you trade powder snow with villager.??
you could block it with two blocks of powder snow
Could you have just placed the two powdered snow in the final door to keep it open?
seawattgameing your exposed your friends didnt put you in there you know evry place to go so dont act like your so real and your not a god gamer
ankha in minecraft
If it was a prison why would they get items
You could use the bucket for the button to Puch it bruh
Bruh
These prisons are getting better and better. Good stuff.
GROX?
When teddy had to stay they could have put an item on the pressure plate
HEY DONT BE MEAN TO OTHER YOUTUBERS!!!!!
you could just drop a item on the pressure plate and then the piston would be activated
He can just drop the empty bottle in the pressure plate😑
hi the bottle you can throw it in the pressure plate
15:45 you could throw a item in the pressure plate to activate it
honestly, if i designed these prisons, i would just give both of them a bedrock room. no way to escape, no items, no hallways, no doors, nothing. literally just trapped forever until they die from hunger
Teddy could of just sprinted through the lava and gave it to you
Hol’ up. Couldn’t Teddy in the last room let Seawatt go and then just go to the furthest room away from the tnt room, he could go all the way to the room with the arrow pointing up where Seawatt pulled him up with a fishing rod
When I saw the room fill with lava I was like "R.I.P"
He could have thrown an item on the plate and both of them could have escaped
I am new
this one also seemed impossible huh
You could've break the netherite even it takes time
He used f5 to change his vision from few months ago.
You could’ve thrown an item on the pressure plate at the end
It said Sub To Kenedian
How do we dye leather armor
How fake can u make it -YES?
"Thats when teddy had a very good idea. hE USED F5"
Sad ending :( :( :( :( :( :(
Bro you can just throw the items in the pressure plate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XeMlU9fMCo&t=191s HAHAHA so exposed seawatt
poor Teddy :(
wow, looks like he actually listened to Kenadian
Bruh wtf would a good prison have random items.
I knew it had something to do with grox
good thing i’m not arrested by not subscribing to thi cringe lookin channel
You could have just use the item on the pressure plate
So sad at the end😢
Also I liked the vid
Lol you could’ve left and he could’ve leave the server before he blows up and you can tell him when it’s done and then both of you live🤪🤪🤪🤪
Make a creeper prison in Minecraft For Ted And you
Dude I'm subscribed to your video SeawAtt Gaming
Why is some of your videos says bad words and not kind words
Now you have to kill grox
Just drop an item bruh
at the end, u should have checked the village chests for a water bucket, then maybe both of you could have survived
He should make these maps downloadable.
https://youtu.be/ePC0faw4zts
seawatt: but there was a five block jump so teddie couldn't make it. Dream: imma bout to end this mans whole carrer
And just sub to seawat ted
Just drop your item
he could had hurry and put a block on it
You could literally just move the pressure plate to the door
Couldn't he have used the powder snow build up trick to hand over the boots instead of the armour stand? he would've needed it eventually for the villager sacrifice tho
Groxxxxx?!?
For the ending part, you could get the 2 snow buckets, and parkour with them over to the circuits and break the curcuits, giving you time to get a pickaxe to break Teddy out too lol. Thst would have to be some pretty fast parkour
Cant wait for part two
“exp” breh
Couldnt you use the item frame trick again? 10:38
Do you know at the end you could just use a item and put it on the pressure plate and then you guys can both go out
Nobody   me turns on creative
All of your escape prisons are are really bad and fake. If you want to know why i think that, check out kenadians vid
*BUT THEN I HAD A VERY GOOD IDEA, I USED F5, SEE USING F5 GAVE ME A WHOLE NEW PERSCEPCTIVE AND I WAS ABLE TO SEE A CHEST THAT I COULDNT HAVE SEEN BEFORE.*
he can kinda just resqawn they not hardcore soooooo...
0
broooo its Grox
Bruh ur insane
Bro you have been exposed already so why keep going? The youtuber Kenadian exposed you and he had lots of proofs everybody knows that you are fake so maybe stop being that and start thinking "Hey friends can you make me an escape room that I'll make a video about? Oh wait, I have no friends."
but then I used f5-
?
Hi dude can you please put the download link for these maps
Ur u can just drop ur stuff at the pressure  plate so both of u can escape
But then I used F5
the first water dispenser is too low, as you can access it by breaking the prismarine slab, therefore cheesing the entire prison lmao
pit of sacrifice break the sign boom u got 2 powdered snow u dont need it?? throw it into the sacrifice chamber
well in the part where ur friend needed the boots just get a 2nd pair of boots and jump up with the boots and powdered snow and to him or mabe if u didnt have another set of boots take the boots off and throw them to him and you have unlimite trys because you just doo
He could do a 5 block jump i did it
But then, I had a very good idea, I used F5. you see, using F5, gave me a whole new perspective and I was able to see a chest I couldn’t have seen before.
Ah yes Kenadian Dispenser
At the beginning Teddy could have used the boat to glitch out of the box, break out of the prison, called the US army and saved you
Please help this man not reach 100k
i am a big fan
Bro at the end you could’ve put an item on pressure plate and both of you would’ve escaped
LOL
Bruhhh groxmc was the one who made the prison
Bro you had an item you should use it to the presuld plate then you both can go out
teddy could have taken the buckets from the lava room after the puzzle was solved
Bruh you could just put an item on the pressure plate
when grox appeared when he said "BrO whAt weRE yoU doInG iN my priiiiiiison" got me
atleast this isnt as dumb as those weird fake escape rooms but y u calling it nearly impossible
This is so dumb lol
You couldve just thrown the spyglass on the pressure plate and both of you would survive :P
NOT GROOOOX
Can't you disconnect and connect to escape the  lava
But then I had a very good idea, I used F5. See using F5 gave me a whole new perspective and I could see a chest I couldn’t see before
Try to escape
It’s nice to know Seawattgaming has changed and became a good escapist youtuber unlike Seawatt 6 months ago.
The videos are actually entertaining, very fun😃
Bro how you and grox are related
It is a nice action video.
Why didn't they just use item's on pressure plate so they both could escape ?
what about drop the water bottle in the pressure plate and then you all survive 16:00
Seawatt narrorating: UH, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman? Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything You say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music
WAIT! does seawatt say. E,X,P and not X,P👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿
https://youtu.be/1XeMlU9fMCo ummm Prison yeah.........
bruh ive found 8 ways  why dis is fake and 10 ways to conserve resources and counting
putting an item on the pressure plate is just too unreasonable
Could've used the snowbucket to walk down
Why you always lying
*but then I had a very good idea-*
This is so scripted and just an escape room this was not even play tested.
... you could have thrown an item on the last pressure plate-
Ok but why did he not get the achievment for standing on powder snow with leather boots
THESE VIDOES ARE SO SHIT BUT SO ENTERTAINING LMAO
THIS IS NOT A PRISON! this is what we call an ESCAPE ROOM!
SeaWatt forgor he could break netherite with his fists
He says everything is impossible
If I remember, you can drop the item on a pressure plate don't know if it's item allowed
aaaaahaahhhhh
You could of mined a tree or wood and make wooden pressure plate and put an item on it quickly
Hey seawat why dont you jus drop the spy glass so you both could live and escape and also take reveng who built that prison
Wow first one is you can just leave and join and leave to not die from the lava
https://youtu.be/1XeMlU9fMCo You're a fake
Seawattgameing your my favourite youtuber
I mean I could have gone outside broke a tree crafted a trapdoor and thrown it over to the other guy so he can crawl through the last door… but this was a more dramatic ending anyway so who cares!
I used f5 see using f5 gave me a whole new perspective
its nice to know that seawatt knows what he is doing and is self aware unlike omz and at the end of the day he just wants to show cool Minecraft mechanics
Eh the other episode that was "1000 pillagers vs 1000 villagers" seawat was captured by grox and then sented to prison but this?
Alternate title: SeaWattgaming uses fake prisons that are more like scripted escape rooms to show off cool minecraft things he found.
I came here because of Zenadian or something saying SeaWatt was just a fake escapist.
They could of put something on the pressure plate
Just put the item on the plat dats all
Grox: what are you doing in my prison SeaWatt: (pulls shotgun out)
There was another way
I was just watching a vid you collab in
I love your videos and please keep up Loading 🦊
Rip ted :(( he sacrified his life for you may ted rest in peace ;(
Your content is not real
Your content is. Not real Hahahahahah
Have u tried pressing f5?
Wait u could have used a item instead of sacrificing ted
Bruh you have a bottle use it for the pressure plate in the tnt room
bro this shit is sooooo cap 🧢🧢🧢🧢
You know you could of just drop a item on the presher plate right
Subscribe to kenaidian
Why does he tell people he has fake escape rooms and still makes them?
BRO…   At the end, they could have just put an item on the pressure plate and both escape
Ummm HELLLLOOOO THE ITEM CAN MAKE A PRESHER PLATE UGGGHHHHH
you know these are so fake
UwU
3:46 whoa the furnace MaGiCaLLy DiSaPpEaReD oMg
Creator SMP please
bro u just needed to drop spyglass or something on pressure plate and you both could escape
Why do grox sound sad at the end
https://youtu.be/79byEKtah6k
Bro u got exposed
fun fact: the dispenser says sub2kenedian which obviously u should
I like how they call these “prisons” lol and i wonder how they do it the first time and they some how do the exact anser and not the easier anser so these are fake everyone knows that right?
Imagine if he just got off and got back on after the tnt exploded
This is fake you made it
Bro, just drop an item on the pressure plate
Holy crap you're still making these fake prison escape videos that you made yourself after seeing an interesting Minecraft mechanic from Tik-Tok
12:46: The answer is here: 13:16… Right?
You literally had 3 items in your inventory
The escape prisons are ez and there is bettet decisions
But then I used f5 see using f5 gave me a hoal new perspective and I was able to see a chest I was’t able to before
Dragon
“I needed a hoe”
Your "impossible prisons" are just bad bedrock escape rooms.
what a lovely fake scripted video
pretty sure this is more like a escape room
Not Again....
Seawat is a horrible prison escaper
6:03 aint that a bit unnice?
Waiting for Kenadian to make a video on this
u were merkus right? and someone is playing ur game? thats what i heard so yeah
Bro seawatt I just saw the video where u got exposed, I gotta unsubscribe sorry but you lied to us!
1:04 Oh and teddy cant just leave and rejoin over and over getting iframes to get through the lava?  2:50 Really? You didnt even try it.
Bro Grox at the end tho
It was for the villagers not for players but still get revenge
Which edition are you playing on.
So far, I have found 12 ways to get out easier
2:25 yeah dont use the item frame and place the furnace down with the jump boost noooooo that wouldnt work (like really seawatt)
has it come to anyones attention that seawattgaming already knows how to do it?
Lesson I learned DON’T TRUST ANYONE but trust your mom
Why do you call him teddy is him your bf UwU but his name is Mr risple
Drop an item dummy
you should of thrown a item on it
First he could have jumped down again and then you could have broken the block it's not bedrock
why didnt you use f5 and get a whole new perspective to see things that you otherwise couldnt see before?
In the last one ( TNT trap ) you just drop your items to activate the pressure plate. And you both can escape.
Bro yall so stupid why not just throw the items on the plate?
Why didnt you place smth in the plate and both escape
Why you don't use the bottle to save him
hes evolving, i think armor stand wasnt needed if u could stakc up with powdered snow but still
13:49 yes you do it’s in your inventory. The 2x2 crafting table, remember?
scripted
15:50 How about you throw a item on it
This was prob scripted but nice
"I had a very good idea  I Used f5 to see a better perspective."
Best ending
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XeMlU9fMCo (proof this guy is fake)
Why didn't you use F5? You see, using F5 would give you a whole new perspective, and you would be able to see a chest you couldn't have seen before.
They could of just placed the powdered snow in the door preventing it from closing and both escaping
10/10 storyline
It's xp not exp
RIP teddy):
its 2 days pass  june 18th but you havent upload the mpv video
“Bro what were you doing in my prison?”
Rip teddy
bruh, all i know this person does is make up STUPID solutions to OBVIOUS obstacles! and he just goes like "bUt ThEn I hAd A gReAt IdEa, I cAn UsE f5" WHO CARES, you say it MILLIONS if not TRILLIONS of times! get better, and use your EYES
Just put them in a bedrock box with no items, they won’t leave that
Bro, what are doing in my prison?
you should have just thrown an item on the pressure plat instead of sacrificing teddy
but then i had a very good idea i used f5
these video's are pretty cool but they are fake
oh so you said sub to kenadian because he busted your videos
You best bro and all are best I like all do not like me
Grox made the prison
Pls make a the story of Minecraft season 2
i have a solution for the last riddle, you can use 2 powder snow bucket to cross over the lava and break the redstone :)))
It made sense that Grox would make that prison anyways
And then i pressed F5 and that gave me a whole new perspective
But then i had an idea i used F5, you see f5 gives me a whole new perspective
Seawattgaming is just so lazy HE DIDNT EVEN TEST IT AND HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF JUMPING OFF AND REJOINING THE GAME STUPID NOOB AND STOP FAKING YOUR VIDEOS STUPID
Waiti didnt know grox was a hoe
Lets talk about F5 son
ted has an item frame he could use that so u can put the leather boots in the item frame so ted do not need make that armor stand
If only SeaWatt can throw the spyglass into the pressure plate then they both escape together.
but then i used f5. you see, using f5 gave me a new perspective
Grox pov:robber
“bro what were u doin in mah prison????” 😂😂😂😂
You got grox lol
Bruh just throw a item on a pressure plate
Where is the creator smp
hey grox personally i wouldnt let anyone call me a hoe but ig thats just me
Hey seawatt nice work I love the effort I would love to meet you in the furture
Why couldn’t they just put an entity on the pressure plate
I love it ❤️😍🥰
June 18
just throw a item on the pressure plate so both of you survive?
The hello was creepy
teddy didn’t need to make the armor stand, you could’ve put the powdered snow on the wall then put the boots on, then you could’ve dropped him the boots.
Bro the way you started the video Loud bro I jumped of my bed lol😂🤣
HOW YO ATUALLLY ESCAPE creative mode bruh
Yo is it possible that I can be on the smp I’m on console and I don’t know if it will eork
"bro what were u doin in my prison?" him: **kills grox.**
"there's gotta be another way" him: there is no other way me: **looking at the glass bottle you can throw into the plate**
WHERES THE CREATOR SMP
Bro, what?! Grox put them in that prison?! I’m quite surprised that actually happened!
I'll take your ...
just drop a glass bottle on the pressure plate  unless that doesnt work because its a different pressure plate
Even though it’s staged it’s still cool
seawattgaming im not sure if you saw but teddy called you by your real name I think
Why you doest yous the bottle
Now this was 170 iq plays
MURDER GROXXX
"right off the bat i started looking around"  N O   S H I T
Have you play this escape room right or you just MAGICLY KNOW WHAT TO DO.
seawatt the smp it's june 19 now
Can you make a video of you taking an iq test?
Imagine the one who builed the map literally exposed him
Very emotional 😭😭🥺
What if you just put the bottle on the pressure plate it still open
I like turtles

Him: "I Will Never Forget You Ted"  Grox: What We're you doing in my prison

LORE?!?
All you have to do is throw the water bottle on the Pressure plates
zjust trhow item at the presure plate
But then, i have a very good idea. You see, f5 gives you a whole new perspective, and i was able to see a chest i wouldnt see before.
Bruh no I just told you no no
You could ahve thrown a item over the presser plate and both of you could escape
Oh that did grox steal dababy’s prison and turn it into his prison in another dimension?
0:30 why is everything block!?!?!
6:03 lol
JUST THROW ALL YOUR ITEMS ON THE PLATE
I love this 2 people prison escape
YOOOOOO NO WAY HE COLLAB WITH GOMZ BRO?! AINT NO WAY THATS AWESOME
But I used F5…
Grox was like: ayo why are u in my prison
they both could survive by placing their powdered snow in the door, then they could pass through the snow and escape.
Dont want my steve to get arrested so i subscribed 😀
Umm you  could of  put  the  poder  snow  down
i kinda saw that coming bc grox is the master of viligers
Bro where is the smp video
gosh i knew it
the lava part made me think im not that stupid
Do video with grox
Lol
How did u guys get another powder_snow bucket? 😕
You should tell your items
They could have just  break the iron with ther fist
There were so many easy solutions but he did the harder ones
15:19 you could have puted a item
13:31 you traded the powdered snow bucket then how did ted did the Parkour again
You could ve used the water bottle
16:26 why grox showed up
🐢 🐢
You could’ve used the item frame. So fake.
Watch kanadians vid debunking him
SO FAKE
Dude you could’ve cleared it ez but you wanted to make yourself look smart by doing unnecessarily complex things
you could have just jumped over the lava with the boat place it on the edge and go on the boat then use the boat to go up the 3     block hole to save the boat and the furnace for later issues.
Wow your 888k sub
Lol
I Iiket the video
Fake
he can respawn its not a hardcore world
This entertaining crap is staged as hell lol
Lot
If it's not gonna be another story Here Just throw ur bottle in the pressure plate then ur all safe
You know you could have used one of the items in your inventory though instead of sacrifice Instead of sacrificing at when is your friends
@seawatt gaming you could have just placed the empty bottle on the pressure plate
rip teddy
this is so staged
Good vidios
You can use items
GROX YOU PSYCHO
You can use items to activate the pressure plate
Why didn’t he just put an item on the pressure plate so they could both get out?
what are you doing here
this is FAKE
Me: Bro... Just put the glass bottle on the pressure plate
Oh you could have just thrown an item and activate the pressure plate with no need of sacrifice
You could have put items on the pressure plate. Whitch means Teddy could have survived and then teddy can sub to SeaWattgaming and jeer be but in villager prison again.
At the last part why couldn't you just use an item it's an entity bruh this dude has 0iq
Drop The Telescope Dum it can hold the presure plate Lol
You could throw an item on the pressure plate and both escape
2 of you escape
Wow put item on the pressure plate
I really wish v1nce found out about your channel
You just could have placed the powdered snow on lowered block and get out lol
Lol, they can die in lava and can spawn outside 💀
Couldnt u just put an item from your inventory in the end on the pressure plate and both escape? Think about it.
Jeez seawatt you didn't use your item
Me uses the armor stand to keep on the pressure plate
on the end oneneed to stay rigth and what if they just trow the emty bottle and survive
He§ a faker!
Can you just, put an item, on top, of the pressure plate
I just can sari 1 iten bro
Its GROXMC?!!
Ted literally could have just used the item frame 10:26
Did anyone notice this was fake
Tedy
Where is evbo
at the end u could've used an item on the pressure plate and it would work
bruh when teddy got da sugar cane in 1 scene he had 12 and in the next he had 18
Fake!!! He made it himself!!
You do know that you can break netherite blocks, right? You could have just broke the netherite block at the end. I know it would have took long with fists but it is worth a shot
you should of used that empty posion on the pressure plate
you could've just put a item on the pressure plate and be done
Epic sequel?!?
POV: you are wondering if seawatt could just dropped a item on the pressure plate
Why don't you use one of your items?
i almost cried at the end 😢😿😭
teaddy=i will stay here me = just pun an item on pressure plate seawatt has 3items in the end
Was that last bit a reference to A Way Out? Or something else lol in A Way Out, Only 1 person out of the 2 buds actually makes it out as well
2 reasons why this sucks- 1-This is an escape room, not a prison. 2nd-He got debunked in this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XeMlU9fMCo&t=19s
F in the chat
In the lava room, Ted could've dropped down, took the lava out of the dispensers, and jumped up to pull the lever
Subscribe to sea watt!!!!!!!😁😁😉😉
lol you should hve throw the spyglss
u should hv used an item at the end
16:02 put a item on the pressure plate
Why he don't drop the spyglass into the plate
seawatt is absoulutly stupid of this is staged
Hey SeeWatt can we join your'e new creator smp when it release's at saturday?
You could have used your item to trigger it
Just use a item dummy
LOL GROX LITERALLY WAS THE ONE WHO MADE THE PRISON😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hi seawatt
would've been funnier if you took too long and both of you exploded
You could've just dropped one of ur items on the pressure plate
Couldn’t you put the spy glass or something on the pressure plate to Activate the door? 🫤
Wait he can respawn
Just call grox...
It was emotional until the "bro what are you doing in my prison" part
Item frame could have kept the pressure plate and both of you escape
timestamp 15:49 you could have put you glass bottle on the pressure plate i think
More of a 2 player parkour not a prison
Teddy!!!!!!
Can’t wait to see the exposed video with the conserving resource’s go brrrrrrrr
At the end you can pot a item on it
You started this channel in 2020 and now look how far you have come. The views are insane and the content is all made by you and not steel from others. That makes you a successful content creator and successful Youtuber. Keep going my man. 👍👍👍
Hey my friend code is 377 I forgot and that’s the whole code it has I forgot it
e. :(
Can I have $10,00
Sub to sea  he needs just do it man it's free and it helps him a lot sub to sea
Just throw an item on the presser plate
The video: *tnt noises* The cc :*[ m u s i c ]*
This is fake
Just realize i just watch 1 and a half hour all the escape prison and teo one of you story 💀
Spoiler alert--      U could have put a item in the presure plate at the end
Check out evanmcgaming seawatt debunk
Bro what are you doing in my prison??!
but then I had a very good idea, I used f5, with f5 I had a whole different perspective and found a hopper
This is better than movies and k dramas
ang l mo pwede mo lang i drop yung bottle mo sa pressure plate tapos pwede rin si teddy umalis
Logic less content
15:49 you could of used the bottle
tnt is not doing any damage behind bedrock he could jump down and stay alive but not enough fast thinking😅😅
But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.   (Luke 13:27) - Repent. Jesus is coming soon.
JUST PUT AN ITEM ON THE PRESSURE PLATE
Dude ted is evil now the villager will starve to death bcuz ted fired him when ted destroyed the lectern
U know u can respawn
I like the videos very much. A Big Fan of You.
Rip ted
The last one u can throw the glass bottle on the pressure plate and u both can escape....bruh😐
Just throw the bottle to the pressure plate
That was sad 🥺
coudnt you drop items on the pressure plate in the end
you could just give his boots by doing the powdered snow trick
i saw something.. the dispensers name was subsribe to kenadian lol
Ted:stays in the prison so one can get out. me:bruh u could literally use item for pressure plate
Grox: bro what were you doing in my prison
You could've just place an item on the pressure plate
I knew it for the last one as soon as i saw the box
Ted should have took the bukket in the dispenser in lava leaves room and then take the water before continuing and then be overpowered because of the water bukket
Grox is the deadlyist utuber
Netherite Hoe aka Groxmc 💀
U had some items in ur inventory u would have put those items on the pressure plate 😅
you can also broke that netherite block and escape
Can’t you activate the pressure plates with items?
Groxmc dead
Better plan drop down the pit thingy mine the plate and the stand and use the snow bucket to get back up and us the stand at the end and you could say how would they know they would need a stand but to that I say how would they know they didn’t?
You guys so stupid no one didn't die if you put the items on the plate that way no one dies
You could of just put on item on the pressure plate…..R.I.P Teddy
He could have just put a item on the pressure plate and both of them could have got out…
The boat trick does not work. Fake. and there is about 10 other ways to escape
Forgot one thing item can be put on pressure plate
you ane kenadian should do a 2 player omziiscool prison
Bro What where you doing in his prison tho
Teddy did this for you also I liked how the guy said at the end “what were you doing In my prison” it was so funny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhgd7LV8wCo&t=10s
​
3:45 diagonally to the right up from the button there’s a weird face 🫣
Lol
Can't u just put an item in the pressure plate ;-;
U do realize at the end u could have just thrown a item on the presser plate
At the end, SeaWatt could use both powdered snow buckets to bridge accross to the redstone, break the glass and then break one of the repeaters to stop the timer. Then once one person gets out, they could get a pickaxe to break the block blocking the other from escaping.
6:03 what did grox do man
16:08 just put a item on the pressure plate
You could have just placed an item on the last pressure plate and both of you guys would get out
JUST SWIM ACROSS THE FREAKING LAVA
Why didn't you just throw an item on the pressure plate? So both of you could escape
sensui
What is grox doing here
Lmaoooooo
My brain is melting from this
you  had stuf to put on the pressure plate
hi
cool
You know you just put like a item on a pressure plate and then if it dies from dying
Armorstand
use one of the items to put on the presser plates  🤣
What If you drop one of your items on the presser plate then you and teddy could escape
Where did the powdered snow come from?
He said 50k like but there is 60k likes
Hey Seewatt gaming every time you kill a mob you turn into it
I bet that GroxMC was just a distraction for SeaWatt whereas Kenadian might be working on the next way to torture our turtle man!
The fishing rod pulling is unreal. If you randomly go in creative, get a fishing rod, and fly and pull a pig up or something, it will barely  move 3 blocks.
Hey Seawatt, next vid get kenadian to build u a prison,hes a rly good escapist and u have a history with him too
you coud just put your poder snow in that and done both of you are alive
Could've used both of the snow to keep building a bridge across to the TNT to get out, or simply have the other player wait below the bedrock where they won't be blown up with the snow lmao

"Subscribe to Kenandian"
Oh come on just go back and get armor stand with powdered snow and place to escape  Use your brain
Still good video
Dude you could throw all your items and activate pressure plate and run away lol
That's not a prison: That's a co-op adventure map!
In the last step you could throw an item in the presserplat
“But then I used f5”
You could of just dropped something on the pressure plate
You can just drop the item💩
You forgot that it's a pressure plate not a button so if you put an item on it it will work lol
The TNT one just use the item you have for the pressure plate......
Dinosaur NOOB
He always say "this prison seems ez outside but it's hard inside and I see and I think It's IMPOSSIBLE
I feel sad about Ted but why Ted didn't put the armor stand to the pressure plate to both escape maybe it will work u didn't think very well at the end
Can't he drop something on the pressure plate
ME in the last room "use the items for god's sake"
You made it out in 15 minutes and 36 seconds!
At the end
You can put a item
In the ending you can drop a item at a plate
u can escape prison by doing thriw one item to the pressure plate
You can throw a item in the preser plet
Bro u can just drop the item
i wanna see an allay prison
#SeaWettgaming
Was there really no way to get water in the TNT room? If you had a bucket of water you could’ve swam through the gap at the end.
u litterally could just pput an item on the pressure plate
Wait couldn't they just throw a item on the pressure plate so they both could escape??
Hmmm i wonder what seawatt was arrested for
Plot twist: it was a villagers prison built for grox and his friends (go watch Grox’s videos to know what I’m talking about)
grox...
A item s bottle
I like this video
But he can escape
You could of used the bottle for the pressure plate at the end so both can come out of the villager prison
Is Grox head
Bro just place an item in a pressure plate  💀
you could've just put an item on the pressure plate-
Ted could just used the item frame and place it the side that lava is flowing like seriously
He could have just put the bottle at the pressure plate and then they can escape together
can't they just like put the snow bucket or something in their inventory?
I've been playing minecraft for 7 years
Use a boat to escape. The bedrock
.
Why didnt you put the snow on the preshur plate at the end?
groxmc when he say the hoe:😭😭
BRUH PUT AN ITEM DUDE IN THE PRUSRU PLATE
when a minecraft youtuber you teaching  better than school
16:25 bro what were you doing in my prison
Wait couldn’t u have placed the powder snow on the block to stop it from going back up then walk through it and both escape
rip teddy
just drop a item on the pleasure plate  in the final bro
Wait, if they made a villager, then the arms go like / and thats not possible in minecraft right? Whats up with the build?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhgd7LV8wCo
wait did anyone notice how the he traded the powered snow bucket but magically got a new one?
use items to go with teddy
and save you from the entrance
teddy could just boat glitch out
At the end couldn’t they just throw an item on the pressure plate and escape?
These videos are fake
0:15 what are you doing here  I was arrested     no no he has a point
you could just use one of the items to escape because dropping items can active the preserplate
Bro you can just put a item in the pressure plate
“A hoe” (AKA groxmc) Had me dead 💀

Bro what were you doing in my prison?
the great thing is it isnt an hardcore world so he lived another day
Handeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeee*
I love your videos
Just look at grox's face and his creepy plans with villagers 😐
it hurts watching you in the beginning not using rejoin immunity to cross the lava
“And gave it BACK to me” the volume needs warning😂😂
He should have picked up the powdered snow when teddy tried to jump on it
Bruh if you were fast enof then you could have 1 broke the netherite block or 2 ran in to the village got wood from house then make wood pressure plate and break black stone pressure plate and use wood one
Bruh at the end u could weigh the plate down with your stuff in your inventory BRUUUUHHHH
I did not sub LOL trap me 😸
I wonder. On the last room, if they put the 2 powdered snow to clog the 2*1 exit, would it have stopped the piston from pushing up? And they could walk through.
you could have just put an item on the pressure plate that also works :D
Bro what were you doing in my prison?🤣🤣🤣🤣
dang bro i didnt know your name was jake
But then i had a very good idea I used F5 See, using F5 gives you a whole new perspective on things and makes you see things you couldnt have seen before
On one must stey you can put a item on the resur plait so it can activate
“But this one seemed impossible” Nuh uh! Nothing’s impossible. It says it right there: “I’m possible”
One time we were playing a snowball fight with bases and I used my fishing rod I fell down but I used my fishing rod so my friend would come down with me
COULD YOU NOT DROP AN ITEM ON THE PRESSURE PLATE?
You guys are so stupid! Just throw an item onto the pressure plate and you could BOTH escape safely!
Bro he could've just dropped an item on the pressure plate at the end then they both could've got out
That was easy to find the owner
10:18 they could have used the item frame to pass it up instead of the armor stand
you could of put your bottle on the preisureplate s both oh yall can acaip
Um... seawattgaming can't you just put an Item on the pressure plate?

16:05 item frame !!!
Bro you can just throw item and the pressere plate will open for both of you
These are ESCAPE ROOMS!
11:00 teddy has an item frame making him already in the position to get the boots and save himself from using his items
just to let ya know five block jumps are possible.
When it said "one must stay", you could have dropped an item
14:10 nice cut bro
At the end Just break the NETHERITE door DUMBO
Subscribe to kenedian made me laugh
That prison looking  ugly _Minecraft Community_
For the end, you could use the powdered snow bucket to go to the glass wall that has the netherite blocks being pushed, and just broke the pistons so you had time to break the netherite blocks and you both could get out....
U could just drop Ur items
Awesome video But you could have maybe put a idem on the presher plate maybe or I am just a noob lol awesome video!
14:55 looks a bit SUUUS

You could have dropped an item on The pressure plate then run out😃

You can use a item to active that pressure plate
at 55:10
He Say hello I DIE
Just throw the item.
Cool
Then i use .....
I feel like you could have both gotten out because there is that glitch when you put a item frame on a pressure plate it would stay powered but honestly i dont know it still works
Why don't you make the SeaWatt prison and with all of your friends SeaWatt
Bruh drop an item on the presure plate
Oof bye grox
So we are gonna ignore the fact that you could throw an item on the pressure plate and you both could have fled
grox
Use item to push the plate
Oh my god-
Who is kenedian
put the 2 powdered snow put the armur stand to fall so you two could escape
you could've throw the bucket on the preasure plates...
Couldn’t Teddy have just unflicked the lever after Seawatt went in his room?
Powdered snow bucket is the real MVP
He could have just put an item on the pressure plate so that they could both escape

You used the snow bucket then you traded it how do you still have it
Omg it's grox that's own the prison lol
U know u couldve dropped the glass bottle it would trigger the pressure plate
You can't just use a item maybe too open the door
Yoy guys have just to throw all your item on pressure plate
You can just use your item and drop to pleasure plate to save your friend dude wtf
Ted pov blow up tnt
Why didn't y'all sacrifice a item on the pressure plate? Would that have worked?
”Bro what were you doing in my prison“   Lmao 😆
drop the item on the pressure plate so both of you survive
”A hoe, (aka groxmc)“   Lmao 🤣
You can put items on a precherplat
You should have put the item frame with the pleaser plate so the door opens longer
Teddy nooo
Bruh they could have use the glow item frame to put and step in the pressure plate

It’s a good thing you weren’t on hardcore mode

At last you can drop an item and 2 of them can get out

You could have thrown one of your items on the pressure plate and both of you could have survived
Grox oh Grox
ofc Grox did it 💀
THE ENDING😂😂😂😂😂
15:50 why didnt you just placed the item frame on the plesure plate!?
,,im kind of a god gamer" makes it the 40th try
Dude step on the pressure plate and jump inthe hole and when theres no explosion happening getou t with powdered snow   you won't escape but you'll survive
Did someone saw it when he said taht 8 need to craft a hoe he put a text aka groxmc
Bro You used your all tricks But the last why you didn't use you can just Put a iteam In that plate and you both have escaped :(
You could have used and item on the pressure plate and both escaped right?
You can just throw an item to the pressure plate and both of you will escape
When he realizes he could have used an item
1. Ted said "I was arrested for not subscribing" like 3 times already but it is a good storyline 2. This one looked hard because the video is longer 3. He still did it, congrats
throw the bottle so you guys can escape
they could have put an item on the preassure plate so they could both get out
Teddy just respawn
He should have used one of his items to activate the pressure plate so that both of them could escape
If you were fast enough you could have gone outside, get some logs, craft a craftingtable and a boat, that way you could both get outside before blowing things up
Damn every prison is IMPOSSIBLE
I love your videos
U coulve used items to wiegh the pressure platee
Hahahahhahahahhahahhahahahahahhahahaha yo what are you doing in my prison got me

How bout a Jesus prison
Very good content 1 banna 2 banna
“it seemed impossible”  THATS WHAT YOU Always say
wait you can just put the item on the presure plate and two of you will escape
what about drop your loot
On the last part, you could of put an item on the pressure plate and both of you could of left.
Does anyone realize that they could’ve just used The empty bottle at the end
"Teddy saw some parkour but it was 5 blocks wide so he couldnt jump" dream: " EZ"
That was so far the best escape prision ever
grox at the end🤣
Wha- Did you just moved a netherite block! It's not possible to move a netherite block with a piston
15:58 You have items, You can drop one that's useless so you two can survive.
insteas of placing the furnace you could place a item frame
You could have just put the item on it to both get out
All you had to do was throw your items at the pressure plate and you guys can escape :/
May be you youse the amtepowshon botol
Grox whate are you doing here
You could just piller on the powdered snow  so you wasted a bunch of blocks on the armor stands witch shows that you new about the whole prison and the solutions
YOO TRENDING
@SeaWattgaming you could have dropped a item on the pressure plate and it would count as weight on the pressure plate
Just use the bottle and the other stuff in ur inventory
You:leave your friend  Me:drip an item
I legit thought you were like 2 million omg
At the end you could of just put a item on the pleasure plate and both of y’all could leave
If it really was Grox’s Prison WHERE IS THE ROD
he died but he can respawn at the very end he can respwan wow not even hardcore
The end was sad but seawatt gaming did not know he was on hardcore and the other person isn’t on hardcore so that was littary a good ending
Ur prisons are actually really good and require some problem solving even if it is staged. While other YouTubers just use basic things that probably everybody knows and also the solution is always a      Hopper. Thanks for watching.
I realize.... USE THE WATER FROM THE OTHER ROOOMS! Then go through one block by swimming! SOLVED.
GROX
Can you stop saying prison its a ESCAPE ROOM!
You could had just put the item in the presherplate
Hahahaha we find out who did the prison, part 2 for revenge😂😂
Not grocery at the end
You could of put a glass bottle on the pressure plate so you both would of escaped
Why grox is in there
I thought it was grox in the villager prison
LET'S GOO SUB TO KENADIAN!!!
Just throw a item on the pressure plate at the end bro
Umm why can you just put some thing on the plesher plate
Hi
Sorry villager
he could just use his items to escape
Sorry seawattgaming
Sorry teddy
Sorry
You have items in your inventory seawatt so throw one of them on the pressure plate then both of you can escape
Grox: bro what were you doing in my prison? If the video went longer seawatt would be super bad and kill him most likely
16:00 throw an item on the pressure plate
But then I had a very good idea. I used F5. See using F5 gives me a whole new perspective and I was able to see the dispenser I couldn't have seen before
Couldn't you just put a item there and both of y'all could of escape
you could of both escaped open the door then jam the door with the powder snow
Stop saying is impossible is possible this prison is a joke
My favorite part was when teddy get out of the room because I thought he wood not escape
I like how his like “bro what are you doing in my prison”
4:25, was waiting for him to get a new perspective by using F5
Oh grox GIVE ME YOUR SOUL NOW.
This is like you know the prison before doing it
you could of just put an item on the pressure plate so you can both escape
Wait..... It says "subscribe to kenadian" @Kenadian
In pretty sure the powered snow can activate a pressure plate
🥉🏅🥉🏅🥉🏅🥉
I had a
Cant you just use your item
Hmmmmmmmmmm
Bro forgor that he could leave while the room exploded and not take damage
RIP TED😭
At the end u could put an item on the pressure plate
Five block jumps are possible
I love how grox just show up and say "Bro what are you doing in my prison?"
Sea what are you doing in the prison
the end sacrifice made a fully gron man kry  yes im new to typing english
What if Teddy gave you his powdered snow, you used both buckets for 2 blocks, stopping the piston, and the leather boots could also stop him from freezing
But then I had a very good idea. I used F5. See using F5 gives me a whole new perspective and I was able to see the dispenser I couldn't have seen before
me when i was in the prison: *just jumps lava and die to respawn outside of the prison
I thought u could just jump and place boat exactly on the edge in the first part That wouldve been soo useful teddy and you could've escaped easily
At the e end why didn’t you just both drop down and the tnt explodes and when it stopped you got up and broke the netherite block and escape
bruh just shut up in the comments cause only iron and gold plates can do activate the plate
You  should just drop anything you han😂😂😂😂😂
You dont know just drop a item in presure plate
👍👍
yo I thought u needed to use the slab and sticks t oamke armour stand and do entity cramming to the zombies
bro you could've just dropped an item at the pressure plate at the end and u both could've escaped
MORE 2 PLAYER PRISONSSS
Put the glass bottle on the plate
At the end you could have just put an item to the pressure plate and u both would have escaped
This video is trash
Bruuuuuuh Grox. :( He's pure evil with villagers and funny with his videos!
Oh ok
Well I guess he could just jump into the bedrock pit and after TNT blows up he could get back to the surface with the powdered snow bucket
wow anther stupid ways u know u could use lava to kill zombies faster right? and probaly could clean out the lava and u didint need armor stand to give him buts cuz u could do the powdered snow jump and give him becose u were high enough
16:07 or you could have placed powdered snow buckets in the entrance and walked through
16:07 you could have used the powdered snow buckets and broken the redstone
Its  upsidown
.W.
10:39 you could have gotten a second pair of leather boots, stood on the powdered snow and threw it to him.
seaattgaming your noob you throw on a spy glass on the pesser plate and both of them escape
its never impossible
friendly reminder that God loves you
16:11 you can trow empty bottle
bruh GROX
couldn't you just put a item on the last pressure plate?
U could just break the pressure plate and put it by the door

Best prison escape so far, so please keep it up!!!!! By the way, I love the kenedian reference
Cool vide9
Why does teddy sound SUSSY
This prison seemed impossible. -Villager Prison This prison seemed impossible. -Every other prison videos
10:50 you should have used his item frame

Hey Seewatt why didn’t you place one of your items on the pressure plate so you and teddy could both escape or are you building lore 👀
#seawattandted
One meme by SeaWattgaming is f5 meme made by kenadian
The end tho lol
BRO YOU GUSY ARE DUMB YOU CAN USE ITEMS TO TURN ON THE PRESSURE PLATES ;-;
U could just put a item on the pressure plate
Lol do the REAL impossiple
Seawat: 1 must stay Me: just drop your powder snow on the pressure plate 😂
you could disable the tnt by building over there with powder snow
teddy could log of and let the tnt exsplode and log on again ,seawatt could get and entety to stand on the puerse plate
100000000 iq
Put item on plate
Hey seawat congrats on that hole civilazation as a giant👍
Bro the end 😂
Hellllo
Why you didn't use a item to drop it in the preshurplate
Can’t they just throw something on the pressure plate and they both can get out ?
Bro you could yous your stuff to throw on pressure plate
It isn't hardcore, so can't he respawn?
😭😭😣😣
i love the grox appearance at the end lol.
use an item
GROX BUT HOW BuT WHEN BUT WHY
Matthew 24:4-5  King James Version 4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
https://youtu.be/usSH_ncSJLA
After his sacrifice you found out the villagers did this and you get your revenge
So um why can't they just put the bottle on the pressure plate?
16:02 use your items 🙄
Bro you cod just put a item on the presser plate and done
at the end just throw an item on the pressure plate and both of you can get out
The armor stand wasn’t necessary...
I cried
did you even throw the bottle to there that way you both can go out
If you smelt items, you get EXP when you pick the item back up. But the problem was there wasn’t anything to smelt
you could have gone outside got a flower and threw it in teds place so both can escape
ending was so emotional it almost hurt my brain
Anyway instead off kill one friend you need to do is let your friend have or you 2powder each time you make 2block in each and make way to timer  and get the redstone torch and pistone and push the netherite away me think
this is called a perfect Teamwork❤❤❤
Dude how fo they even make these prison it looks sortof impossible
SeaWatt is pretty smart for getting out of impossible prisons. Great Video!
06:02 funny
Bro he could just drop any item on the preshrplate
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.
… bro at last stage you could of just put a item then go not leave a person behind
On the tnt room part you could just drop a thing on it
Why can't you put an item on the pressure plate and escape together u should sometimes not listen to the signs
Why they not use the powder snow bucket their stupid
ah yes! grox! i knew it! hes the one who put them in the prison XDDDDDDDDDD
Seawatt, I love ur vids, but I know that u always see if there are chests behind the lava in the first scene so I probably not exactly know that u might have faked it, but still I love ur vids and keep up the minecraft mechanics👍

NOOOOOOOOOOOO
I though these ended after kedian exposed them "and the i had a very good idea i went in f5 mode you see f5 gives me a whole new perspective"
🤩
Omg
Bruh, the ending was dumb,if you throw an item in the pressure plate,it will weigh it,then, you both escape.🤦
Fun fact teddy actually have a item frame so u can put the boots there
Bro could've dropped the empty bottle-
u could throw an item on the pressure plate..
Honestly you could have just go into creative
is there any Part-2 for this video? if there is, sent it please
This guy had the worst trades ever. People hated his trades. So he got revenge
You don't need 1 mil you need 10 mil with this content
the fact that the end all u have to do is throw a item on the pressure plate and both survive
At the last part of the prison u guys said 'we need a sacrifice' but a item can also active a pressure plate so no one has to do his sacrifice
You could of dropped your glass bottle on the pressure plate
U used your powder snow bucket for the lectern then which bucket did you use for the lava parkour for returning back😐
Drop an item on the pressure plate it will stay open and u both could get out
Why didn't you drop an item? That can turn on the pressure plate.
The day of wrath is at hand. Turn away from wicked ways. Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ and in his Death, burial and resurrection as the payment for sins. Jesus is the only away escape the wrath to come. (John 14:6) https://youtu.be/l78FYh9Qkkk
Just put a item in pleasure plate
Him: *Escaped the hardest hardest hardest hardest prison in minecraft*  His friends: NEVER NEVER GIVE UP
just throw an item on the pressure plate
I feel like all the stuff he does is so pointless since there are more easier and obvious solutions
Man u Could Use Ur items to throw on the pressure plate and both could escape bruh teddy's live sed ;(
I will subscribe if you make allay prison
U could throw the bottle on the pressure plate at the end 😂
Just throw away the stuff you have in the preadure plate dummy😸
This was like a horror movie
No teddy😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
you can just drop the glass bottle
that classic Grox
Both of them could’ve escaped if they used the powered snow glitch to get the stand and place it there
Everyone knows this guy is faker. How is this possible to get xp with advancement
https://youtu.be/a69ZJQGy2s4
I was not expecting to see grox at the end XD
why you didnt throw item on the preshure plate
Can’t you just put one of your item on the pressure plate instead at the end?
The floor they stood on in the last puzzle was made of bedrock couldn't both survive if after the other one escaped the person inside combat logged? after the explosion the blocks that would be left would be the bedrock, Lava, and the Netherite blocks, when the explosion is done the person outside could craft an armor stand, give an ender pearl, or give a chorus fruit.  Also Blackstone counts as stone so an item frame wont work -Me after reading comments
Why didn’t you just throw an item?
Man gotta do grox like that
Just use a block
Putting items and the item frame at the pressure plate: 😐
You can drop a item on the plate to make you both escape
/save
Um you can put an item on it then it will open so you don't need to die
You can drop a item on the plate so both can escape
kenadian made it in here... noice
10:08 armor stand for makind entity crawl?
wait was the exit a netherite block why not just break it!
Seawatts prison's aren't actually as hard as you may think, but he still makes really enjoyable content. I reccomend checking out Mythrodak too (her old content, anyway).
One of them has to escape and one of them has to blow of pieces but you have stuff you can just throw in the pleasure plate
You guys had items right you could’ve just placed an item down
Bro u could have used the item entity to step on the Blackstone pressure plate at the last part
In the end, Ted could quit the server, wait for all the TNT to explode, and then rejoin
8:23 kenadian made this prison I guess .. Maybe you became friends after all xD     Oh lol it was grox haha (it probably still was built by kenadian)
There an way throw an item
Anyone else realise in Ted's pov in the leaves and lava the leaves moved up one block
4:44 flick the lever again, it will make the lava gone cause the dispenser has bucket in it, and the door still open
“AKA Groxmc” then “Yo what we’re you doing in my prison?”
Smarter way put both powder snow in the pistons and both can escape beacuse piston cant push when theres a block on top
He could just disconnect and survive
You forgot the item
JUST PUT AN ITEM ON THE PRESUREPLATE
Bro, u could have just made a trapdoor out of the wood in the village if u 2 weren't talking about how one of u 2 would die
respawn
Wut if you threw an item onto the pressure plate in the end
Wow groxx in your video
you guys make a mistake
wait
Teddy: Dies Seawatt: Becomes sad (He can just respawn)
GROX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Items go brrr
U got assasinated in elf dwarf and giants silvers video
16:10 the item frame feelings belike: I'm useless
16.17 secs in bye Ted blows up why you so dumb just leave an item on the pressure plate bruh
Why you didn't use the spyglass it can push the pressure plate so you guys can escape together
You should dropped a item pleasure pate (the last room)
I will cry but. Grox came out of nowhere😂
6:50 fire spread off
wait... is Grover the one who trapped you and Teddy?
Ted:ill stay Him: are you sure? Ted:yes. Him:ok.. The Bottle: Are you serious rn?
Brilliantly entertaining !! Love these vids
Ooh hel nah
I'm honestly impressed by the time and effort you put into these videos, Keep it up. I also work very hard on my 100 days videos!
The item bottle noob
YOU CAN BOTH GET OUT JUST PUT AN ITEM IN THE PRESSURE PLATE JUST SACRIFICE YOUR ITEMS
Why didn't they just find a way to get the armored stand and then put it on the neitherite pressure plat
He could have just thrown a item on the pressure plate to activate it
Ok 🤔🤔🤔 is!  Damger to me
Just fix my thing OK
BUT HE COULD HAVE JSUT DROPED A ITEM ON IT SND THEY BOTH COULD HAVE ESCAPED?!🤯😫😭
But still can you fix that shout me out and then put it in the comments down below didn’t make that video please
Sorry for saying please in the extreme word OK I’m sorry
YouTube is in though comments well your videos are a not that good but can you make a zombie prison and make it bedrock then make it three player and then make an extremePlease and then I’ll like your videos
Hey seawatt why did you not just drop an item to the presure plate then you just escape?
How do you like in subscribe
Just one of you guys I am sorry for your friend
1:06 if you log out and login while in the lava you don't take damage
But then I had a very good idea. I used f5 mode. See using f5 mode allowed me to see things I couldn't see otherwise."
Grox!!!?
At 10:27 Ted could have used his item frame and placed it on the wall and you could have put the boots in the item frame
HAHAHHAHAHA GROX WAS MAKING A PRISON FOR VILLAGER
U can press Q and drop an item on the pressure plate it will push the pressure plate down
"And so I got a really good idea, I looked in F5, You see looking in F5 gave me a whole new perspective and I was able to see a hopper I couldn't before"
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                                         /.,/.,/.,/.,/.                                 /,./.,/,/.,.,/
Bruh he can just use the bottle
Be big brain put the spy glass on de trap door
why don,t you just use the item at the end?
Shut up bitch I’m not subben
Traded the powdered snow and then somehow get another one to go back to the crafting table
You can throw an item on the pressure plate to get out .
Stand on the snow blox and give it to teddy and then pick it up again
Ooh Grox is gonna get it
Grox is addicted to villagers
16:06 just put down an item on the pressure plate
10:26 you got more than one piece of rotten flesh from the zombies so you could've gotten a second pair of boots, placed the snow down, put on one pair, and throw up the second one edit: I literally saw that he did the same thing I just said the next few seconds but he didn't have to make an armor stand
8:26 why does the dispenser say subscribe to Kenadian
Everyone is bedrock all of your prison videos have bedrock
The Grox SeaWatt universe expands
So i used F5, you see, using F5 gave me a whole new perspective-
amazing how every time you can guess there is bedrock as soon as he says impossible
WASNT IT WEIRD IN HIS PREVIOUS VIDS HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS COMING UP?????
They could have put an item on that last pressure plate :I
"subscribe to kenadian" 8:24
Rip tedy
Lol he could’ve used a item…
"aka grox" lul
Lol he cut a used item…
4:17 "but then i had a very good idea, i used f5 to get a whole new perspective"
I knew it was grox
I like how he. always say it impossible to escape and he always beats it lol
On the last pressure plate you could have placed a item
Go to lava, respawn, and u made it out! Unless, ur spawn point is innnn the prison
16:00 they should drop one item in the pressure plate to they can escape both
It was at this moment that grox knew He f###ed up
2 player to 1 player

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.  May God Bless you all! ♥️
Damn I love how this was recommended and this escape room is fake.....
Bro u had things in ur inventory, just throw it at the pressure plate, and u can both escape, bruh
16:06 u can just throw snow bucket at plate making it activate
bro just put a item plate and you can get out lol
"But then I had a very good idea. I used F5. See, using F5 gave me whole new perspective to see a chest I never would've been able to see before."
Dude, are you from silver's videos?
Repent and believe in our only Lord and savior, Jesus Christ, God who came to us as a human, for forgiveness of sins and eternal salvation: we are saved only through his death and shed blood on the cross, his burial, and resurrection 3 days later.   1Co 15:1  Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, 1Co 15:2  and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you—unless you believed in vain. 1Co 15:3  For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, 1Co 15:4  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,  Joh 3:16  “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. Joh 3:17  For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Joh 3:18  Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.  Act 2:21  And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.’   Act 4:12  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”   Rom 10:9  because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Rom 10:10  For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.” Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. Rom 10:13  For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”  Eph 2:8  For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, Eph 2:9  not a result of works, so that no one may boast.  Rom 3:23  for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, Rom 3:24  and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, Rom 3:25  whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. Rom 3:26  It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Rom 3:27  Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. Rom 3:28  For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.  Realize we are ALL sinners in need of a savior. And we cannot earn heaven or Gods favor.  Receive Gods free gift of eternal life and forgiveness through the Lord Jesus Christ, God in the flesh. To walk in his will for your life and be transformed by his grace.   God bless you all, Amen.
or you can use wool to prevent piston from pushing
U could’ve used an item on the pressure plate and then both of u escape
13:55 how could you use powdered snow to do Parkour if you traded it for the lectern
Bruh grox

"The next room was really SUSpicious" -SeaWattgaming 6/9/2022
great video. prison was amazing. loe that ur adding lore too
Teddy should drop an item on the presser plat
Ayo grox
15:53 Bro, you can just use your Glass Bottle, Powdered snow or the SpyGlass, and now you 2 Can escape! Don't you realize that?
Naming a villager subscribe just for u to....SMART

Easy just go to the side to jump in five blocks
Why coudn`t he have put an item on that pressure plate
I would like this vid if u weren’t trying to trick all ur child fans
kenadian be like: "No other way?" (breaks netherite block)
How did U have 3 buckets at the end lies and fake
6:36 What did he say????!!!
KENADIAN. PLEASE REVIEW THIS
... you should've just put your items on the presherplate
its not a prison
Grox at the end lmao
I LOVE TWO PLAYER PRISONS!! DO IT AGAIN!!!!
"Only one of us can win"
Me: *seeing the hearts* can’t he be revived?
I love your videos i will subscribe
This is an escape room
That spyglass could have used to open the door so you could both escape
At the end you could’ve put a item there and both of you can go
9:08 or 9:09 You said Leather Boots for Rotten Flesh before xD not the right way xD
Liam
2:08 Just use F5 (And I know this is scripted xD)
only ur mom will escape this prison alive.
the fact that the dispenser was named 'Subscribe to Kenadian'
the fact that the dispenser was named 'Subscribe to Kenadian'
Dude drop item?
Oh my God another cliff hanger
You said it was impossible but it’s not because you did it
You could of used an item for the presser  plate
SeaWattgamingod  makes great videos
my friends trapped me in a bedrock prison and challenged me to break out of it but this one seemed possible every seawatt prison video ever
Its not really a prison with a way to escape
The prison is beautiful
15:59 JUST PUT AN ITEM ON THE PLATE
Do you watch Silver?
Bro u can  f*ck  used the items in your slot ot  save 2 of u!
Break the nethernite
Why not just use the powdered snow to stop the netheright block and the two can escape
You probably could have both escaped if you moved quick and if the person that got out first used the snow bucket to pickup water so the other person could swim out
Could've just dropped somthing on the pressure plate, unless it was weighted
It ligit had to be grox💀
I'm not interested
I'm not interested
10:53 or you climb up the wall with the powdered snow and drop it to him.
3 solutions of letting you 2 out: 1. put a snow bucket/item frame in the pressure plate 2. break the netherite block preventing you from escaping 3. idk
You could just throw a item on the presure plate and it would activate🤦‍♂️🤦🤦‍♀️
Use your items
GROX!?
Can he just drop the item to make the door open
Right off the bat. He always says it
BUT THEN I HAD A VERY TOOD IDEA I USED F5 SEE F5 GAVE ME A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen
Damnnnn love your videos … hillarious and so inspiring to me as a creator
16:24 lol, this is just perfect meme
16:00 You had different items, you could of just put them on the pressure plate. Bruh. Now Teddy is a dead ass.
Wait you aren't on hardcore so can't you just die and respawn outside the prison?
Couldn't u just put the items on the pressure plate?
At the end you could have placed a item 💀
Just put you stuff on the pressure plate Ted didn’t have to sacrifice
then i a idea i used f5
If there werent like 69420 million other solutions to this escape room, then teddy's sacrifice would have actually been worth
As soon as teddy (?) said, "I was arrested for not subscribing to seawatt", I subscribed.
Take the water from the water dispenser and you’ll break the prison
why didnt you throw items on the pressure plate in the end
Stop showing question marks!
The villager no brain
yall know what will be funny if grox replies to this video by saying "bro what were you in my prison"
Orr 2:21 Ted can go threw the lava
Seawatt: *enters new room* right off the bat…
Wait, what about this? Why not use two powdered snow buckets to bridge across to the glass area. Break through, destroy the circuit, then bridge back. The person with the buckets would stay behind and let the other person escape easily. Then, you could break the netherite block by hand or the escapee could grab gear and break it for them. That way, both of you guys could escape technically.
omgggg! 😱
Me at the end:USE A ITEM TO PUT ON THE PRESSURE PLATE
FFF
damn thats a sad ending
You had to put all your stuff on that presherplate
I learned so much great info from this video! Thank You!
Believe in Jesus. Believe in the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Believe in the Son of God. The Illuminati know – God exists. I am writing this to enable people to know that the Devil actually exists. But there is hope. Our Saviour Jesus Christ died so that we will live. Jesus said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me".
Why don't u just put the spy glass on the pressure plate???
You could just put one of your items on the pressure plate so you bolts can leave!
Bruh why didn’t you guys just put an item on the pressure plate at the end therefore both of you could get out and not just one of you
bruh
Why couldnt you just throw an item onto the pressure plate- oh wait items dont work on heavy pressure plates do they?
Uhm they could have thrown a block at the pressure plate and they would both escape☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️
I'm pretty sure that with the leather boots, Teddy also could've put the item frame down, put the boots in, punch it out, and hope that Teddy could pick them up.
You know that both of you could have escaped you should have thrown the bottle 😒
I mean you coulda just put an item on the pressure plate but okay
I heard ted pov say a bad word
At the end you could've used the item frame. When a player stands on the pressure plate you can place an item frame there and it will stay activated.
Groxmc is dead ringt now.
At the end  they could of just placed an item in 1 must stay
Me at the end: USE THE GLASS BOTTLE
vittu jäisinpä vankilaan
Go around the pressure plate
Yo.....  you can throw an item on the pressure plate at the end......

I know a hack to get through the "both players needed" door.. Teddy should have used the armor stand as an entity. GIGABRAIN GRAYSON
Your  so  clever  👏 👏 👏   you  make  it  look  easy
I love the story on this
When you now there was a potion
B I G B R A I N
6:03 EYO WTF
For the 5 block jumps, you can actually make those because of running for long time
If he wouldn’t have wasted so much time, one could leave, get a lever, come back and replace the pressure plate with a lever. There was tons of wood and stone around the village it would’ve worked.
You could of just thrown a item on the pressure plate
Just flip again the lever to remove the lava
Ted stop punching 😡
You could of just put an item on the pressure plate
Lol grox at the end
Map download is needed
Ok
The "Sacrifice" ending
I love 2 player escapes way more then 1 player ones
You can drop a item on a Pressure plate
"Bro what were you doing in my prison"-GroxMC
I loved how Geox was just like hey what you doing in my prison
I thot zombies are dead so thay can't freeze to DEATH
6:03 lol
you  can drop an item on a presure plate so both can escape
throw the item on the presure plate
"Bro what were you doin inside my prison?"
They could have use the powder snow bucket and go down the pit of sacrifice and got the armor stand and they would have got out
Dang all of this is follows up with YouTubers cool
BRUH JUST THROW AN ITEM ON THE PRESSURE PLATE DAMN IT!
You are just telling minecraft facts not actually escaping the prison because it is scripted but still I love your videos
At the end as was so sad :(
TEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Screw you grox
Theres so many things that they chuhave done more efficiently
teddy sacrifati his life
oh and you could have threw the glass bottle so you both could have escaped
You could’ve just used the armor stand to activate the pressure plate that needed two players and then use it for the next pressure plate
Bruh u don’t needed to secrafice u r friend just use a item
item  exits
That commenting sounds terrible
him: *its impossible*  also him in every video *escapes*
Grocs
I’m not sure but, can’t he use a item frame?Also, teddy dosent really need to change graphics because can he break  the leaves?
this is scripted
You could have just placed the 2 powdered snows in the 2 block tall 1 block wide door so when you stepped off the pressure plate the door could not close and you can go threw powdered snow
Ngl coulda placed a powdered snow bucket in front of the netherite which prevents the piston from going back to blocking the exit while the other person was standing on it, then taken off the leather boots and walked thru the snow
why does this have lore
Loved how at the end, the creator of the prison was like “what were you doing in my prison” so casually and that SeaWatt didn’t need any time to find him.
"Subscribe to Kenadian"        Noice
they coudl block the piston with powder snow and escape
https://youtu.be/PnAf5JGKBss
these videos are good but i think that people sometimes forget there faked
10:54  teddy could have thrown you the item frame and you could have done the glitch from the beginning. 12:49  throw some random items on the pressure plates. that would work. 15:50  throw an item on there.
This looks like a 5yo quiz tbh
U could have used  the lectern or the empty potion bottle to make the preassure plate stay
All your ESCAPE impossible
Rip
you could throw t he spyglass on t he presure plate
Wait. Couldn't you have dropped an item on the pressure plate to keep it activated? And then both of you could've ran out.
At the end you could of just dropped an item on the pressureplate, allowing you both to escape
get dirt from outside, bridge over, and break one of the repeaters. problem solved.
When are you gonna upload a video of creator smp
Hey seewatt did u know u couldve used the items in your inventory and put it on the pressure plate
Me: throws a item on the pressure plate Mr.Rispole(Ted): sacrifices himself
Lol grox prison
Bro you actually can drop something on the plate to open
They can escape two o them
wow... just such a coincidence that he wanted to turn graphics up to fancy....
Plot twist : teddy logs off before tnt explodes so he is still alive
Seawatt in some videos: My friends put this in here because they knew I couldn't play Minecraft well Seawatt in other videos: I did it on my first try because I'm kind of a god gamer🙌
I think you can defuse the TNT in the last room by using the powdered snow buckets and makeing a bridge but I could be wrong.
you could have just put the item on the pressure plate instead of teddy
how u gut the bucket to go backwards if u already traded it for lecturn
At the end,you could drop an item to the presure plate so you two can escape,im right?
Lol the dispenser called "subscribe to Kenadian"
But then I had a very good idea. I used F5. See, using F5 gave me a whole new perspective, and I was able to see a chest I couldn't see before.
15:00 i think this part was scripted write? There are more than 5 possible ways to go out (both)
Grox made this to keep the villagers inside Ha called it
i like how u didnt trow the bottle on the pressure plate so u both could scape
Bro u could've just dropped any of ur items in the inventory and go out u both
Groxmc!
1 like equals 1 more Teddy
I thought it was extremely dumb as you can throw and item on the pressure plate to make the pressure plate go on and not sacrifying teddy
Who else saw the "Subscribe to kenadian" easter egg. Thats the guy who exposed him. Btw 2001st comment
Couldn't you both have gotten out by just saving armour stand with powder snow bucket
Fun fact: Both could have escaped there, they could have blocked the door with their powdered snow buckets :|
15:57 simple tip  LEAVE THE GAME BRO, UR ON A SERVER
The end bro
the prisons are more like  escape rooms
8 words T E A M W O R K
Bro you can just throw the item you have?? And - such a stupid
look at Ted hotbars slots at 0:46
His simplicity is the main reason for his growth 🔥🔥
6:90 4:20 lmao
im also subscribed and i love!!!...your vids
6:56 Ted could have grabbed bucket from the dispenser and then get the water this would have changed the course of the room also netherite block is breakable. Never the less a great video (not sarcastic)
"bro what were you doing in my prison"
hey seawatt you could have dropped a item on the pressure plate and you could both leave
this is like portal on xbox
Bro what are you doin in my prison?
Thank you teddy for that sacrifice to let him survive I will always Remember you teddy 😢😢😢
just throw the item in ur in and u both could have escaped bruh
You have an item on your inventroy
Bruh, you could have put a bottle on it lol
I thought you would stop making prison vids when you said that you would stop in Kenadian's vid
Lol kenadian the guy who exposed you
*escape room
Ah yes grox the anti villager man.
16:02  Me : ITS NETHERITE BREAK IT TOGETHER WITH YOUR FIST

I love video
You also could have thrown the spyglass on the pressure plate so both of you could stay
This guy copied my pfp lol
15:40 - 16:16 if you gave him your powdered snow bucket he would have 2. then he could take the leather boots off and swim through the powdered snow to escape through the door! you could both escape!!!
The killer was groxmc
At 12:57 couldn't teddy give you the birch sign which you could trade with your villager into a powdered snow bucket?
Lol haha
https://youtu.be/ESB3RgAQugo
Your' a pro!
9:14 why is it stuck
You did it wrong
That was weird I couldn't see anything
On the tnt part you just need to drop an item on the pressure plate
Grox is just a god just doing whatever he wants lmao 😂😂😂
16:25 GROXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Seawatt kill him
You could both escape the villager if you drop the items on the pressureplate and them you both are outside
Couldn't ted put a item on the pressure plate at the end?
When you gonna do the face reveal? I love your vids!
When the timer has start you should have dropped the snow bucket amd teddy must drop his snow bucket doubles the pressure plate to open the redstone door
He could have put a item on the pressure plate
Bro if they don’t want you to escape just make an unscapial prison just make up bedrock platform over the bills in it that’s all you Gotta do guys
Thoughts on doing a Collab on a prison escape with Kenadian?
16:00 you could have dropped an item on the presure plate
bro the end but it's really good
Grox
You could of use the spyglass
Oof grid is in trouble
Wait, why couldn't you place both powdered snow buckets in the door way, blocking the netherite block, and then escape?
You can both survive from last room. Teddy stands on pressure plate Teddy gives his powdered snow for you When door is open, you put both powdered snow on doorway You both walk trough powdered snow to freedom
16:00  wtf just use the f0cking glass bottle and throw it on the pressure plate  its THAT easy  seawatt and teddy: "tHeRe Is No OtHeR wAe"
Trow something to pressure plate and then both of you can get out
Seawatt could just throw the spyglass or something on pressure plate and they both could escape   (In my opinion 🤔)
Just use an item
they could just bridge to the glass area, break the window and destroy  the redstone thing which will give them more time to escape
My name is teddy
u should thrown someting on the presser plat
fake
why are all of those prisons they build impossible
0:02  yeah, every one was
15:45 they both couldv'e lived if they put both the powdered snow buckets on the netherite so the piston couldn't push, then they couldv'e taken off the boots and escaped
Yo You could have threw an item on the pressure plate for you two to get out
@Kenadian make this prison?
How did you get another snow when you sacrofise yours
Bro couldve dropped item on pressureplate snd bith go out 🤦‍♂️
The end when grox arrive XD
8:24, the dispenser is named subscribe to kenadian
1  sub  to  ted pov
wait if ted would give you the powdered snow bucket and youd have both you could have put it in the piston door ''jamming'' and both could have flee.. but whatever the video was fun either way
We want a prat2!! :)
FUCK
This man says Exp.
ThIs miGht bE iMpoSIbLle
seawatt you didnt how to let teddy die you just throw an item on the plate and then the both of you can escape
15:53 I mean why don't you throw the empty glass bottle to the pressure plate and both 2 guys escape?
16:25 lol it was GroxMc prison🤣😅😂
wanna save ted? take the glow item frame in which the spyglass was and put it in the pressure plate and it will stay on
You could of thrown a item on the pressure plate to save both
Why did you didn't drop a item
The villager cell could’ve been called the cellager.
Groks he was behind this
Grox: what you doing in my prison? Few seconds earlier, Ted: find the person who put us in the prison! Few seconds later, Seawatt: I like yo cut g. Grox: Ahhh-
Go watch the seawattgaming exposing video and you realize how much effort is really put in into these videos
"impossible"
The last part is little over cuz you can just put iteam on that thing what is it I dont remeber hehe😬
Jo Jo seawatt
Cant wait for Kenadian to expose this video
8:25 SUB TO KENADIAN
D.. .
I love the two player Escape rooms
You know you could do this through an item on the pressure plate so you and you both could get out right
how did you get here?
Seawatt or Ted coulda just thrown an item on the pressure plate in the end, unless it's weighted it won't work. This pressure plate wasn't weighted, though, so I dunno how he thought of all those other stuff but not this!
I used f5 it giv-
"bro what where u doing in my prison"  a man was killed that same day
Seawater thanks man
on 8:27
you fake it
why is the dispenser named Subcribe to Kenedian?
LMAO Kenadian exposes SeaWatt for faking his prisons then helps him build the prison. Kenadian such a dirty person.
There was actually a way for you both to get out. One player gives the other his snow bucket and stands on the pressure plate. Then you place both buckets on top of the netherite block. When you step off the pressure plate, the door can't close, and you can just walk through the snow.
To be fair you could use the powdered snow to get to the glass, break the signal and then when you get out you can craft a button or pressure plate or lever to open the door
teddy said "Jake, do something fast" Well we know SeaWatt's name now..
😭😭😭😭😭
😭😭😭😭😭
you say impossible like a 100392949294929692599285285939583883884 times but you managed to escape so how is it impossible
Why can’t he put a item on the pressure plate?
This is on peacefull lol
Bro he have a bottle of glass and did not just throw it to open the door
For the last level use a item!
“Oh that’s c r i s p y”
ted should of taking the bucket and placing on the preasure plate
Love It <3
10:56 you could have also done the item frame trick you did at the start so you could save the slab and sticks
I really like your videos, but i just cant get over his videos there so funny. https://www.youtube.com/c/Kenadian
16:19 Rest In Peace teddy
I did not sub and I am not in a 2 player prison
You could have put 1 item on the pressure plate so the two of you could escape
you can just throw an item on the pressure plate💀💀💀💀💀
At the final part you could use a ramdom stuff like a empty bottle  that you havr in your inventory
U could have used an item on the last pressure plate
That's sad but is not hardcore 😂
Bro you could  have put someting on the presher plate
This video is crazy omg
Also lmao in the final room they could of used the powdered snow bucket and broke the tnt
Teddy was arrested too???
They could just use a item what
YOU COULD OF DROPPED AN ITEM ON THE PLATE AND YOU WOULD OF BOTH ESCAPED-
you could have used an for the pressure plate now Teddy has learned what happens
Is your name Parker because rekrap is Parker spelt backwards
this is my idol
Sea watt you could've drop the empty potion bottle on the pressing plate😭😭😭😭
Just use any items to
Grox be like : alright just killed someone and now time to go as the unknown person who caused the school fight but doesn't know anything
And both of them will get out
IQ idea this place the two snow bucket and just walk out
Seawatt ur my new favorite YouTuber ur vids r do good
Everyone go subscribe to kenadian. (Poggers if you saw it)
i knew it i knew that grox who made it
You can plaes the item in the preshure plate and then you and ted both get out
usssssseeeeeee the a item
12:18 F3 + T 😩
Why drink the potion when you could just place the furnace catch fire and jump two blocks
Teddy should probably subscribe.
why not flicking the lever again?
You actually could both survive. After activating tnt timer you should hide in previous part of prison, because it's bedrock you wouldn't die. After explosion could get out safe
4:00 why not mining the slab and then collecting the water bucket?
you can use the item frame to block the lava instead of using a furnace
1:41 and placing the boat on the bedrock and jumping in it mid-air?
0:37 and the 3-second invincibility when you log in? Just log in and out repeatedly until you can escape the lava lol
ted should have went down the hole, get the armor stand, destroy the plate and powder snow up, so at the last stage he wont have to be blown up (rip)
Dude if u add item in pleaser plate it active
3:33 lol 😂
i knew it
Just put something on the plaent
This man always tries to do something and extra ordinary and make his audience fell excited for every next, love you
Teddy should have just hit the lever again
10:53 Or you could have just, you know, stacked up with the powdered snow and threw it at his feet
Hey you no you can Break the furnace with your hand
You always had to check you i mean toy disallow way you can do it
You have you had value in victoria why you can just drop dating and just go together
What's wrong to you man
At the beginning you could’ve placed the boat and sat in it u could’ve saved the boat aswell..
you know you could drop the item frame on the plate then both escape
Teddy should have gone back. De should have dropped down into the bedrock cage, it's that easy. Then, you could help him escape
They should’ve used the glass bottle on the pressure plate so they could both escape
Seawatt: But then i used f5. See, f5 gave me a new perspective and i was able to see a hopper that is hidden in the hole.
cringe.
kenadian debunked him and now they are working with each other.
The much harder and stupider option became the only option
Whose gonna tell them that they could just put a item
You need 1 MIL
You just could have dropped a item on the presseaur plane and you both could escape
At the end you could have thrown an item
What the hell was gross doing in the prison did she make it or what
Sea’s Every prison vid “but this seems ImPOsSiBle”
I thought he was called sea watting
YOU COULD PUT THE GLASS BOTTLE AND THE PRESSURE PLATE WOULD WORK DUKMY
Just drop i thing to the pressure plate it will still activate as an entity that was the most stupid sacrifice
You always say "this on seemed impossible"
Noooo teddy bear
he can just drop an item in the stone presure plater at the end or he just did it for content
Rip to my boy...
This is staged isn‘t it? At the end you could have thrown an item on the pressure plate. And along the video, there are also a few flaws of the „prison“ you could have easily taken advantage of…
So sad for teddy:(
Oh it’s Grox’s prison
I laugh when grox show up XD LOL but r.i.p ted
he should just put that sign and survived
💀 bro you can just put the empty bottle Throw it and now you 2 can escape
A five block jump is possible
10:35 Teddy Could've Put The Item Frame On The Side, You Put Tge Boots On The Frame And Teddy Break And Grab It. And Also It Took Me 1 Second To Actually Realize The Thing You And Teddy Were Doing :3
8:23 *i used f5*
um  16:00
He could have thrown his bottle on the pressure plate
15:19 u could just had thrown ur items in that pleasure plate
MAAAAAAAAAAN ALLWAYS WHEN THERES A NETHERITE BLOCK HE HD SOMETHING TO BREAK SO HE COUD MAKE IT SINGLEPLAYER!
bruh u can just throw items on plate
Broooooo you're the smartest Minecraft player🤯🤯
Can you say “escape room” BECUASE your going to seem dum to some sussy ytber who gets mad to dum.
10:38 uhhh I think u guys said the item frame trick at the start i know this is just a showcase of minecraft knowledge but ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Fun fact you have some items that can push the plate
Found who put them in the prison at the end its was Groxmc
Hey,sorry about that stuff from last video,I was just wanting to do something funny,no hard feelings if it did cause any
1:15 : teddy breaks item frame seconds before and then the item frame is back in the next scene 10:30 : sea watt could just use the powder snow like he did later in like 2 minutes At the end you could just put a item on the plate :/
Why did i thought it said Imposter lolll
Bro if i dont sub i will end up in a prison? THATS EPIC!
you and Ted forget something a item can activate a pressure plate
Mr respons
You could have dropped your spyglass on the pressure plate bRuH
He is a criminal
bruh, can't u drop glass bottle on preasure plate😒.
When i heard him saying hello i choked
Well, this means there's gonna be a kenadian video
Bruh, you can use an item activating the pleasure plate then both of you can eascape, didn't you know?
I'm subbed also cool content!
U can't put a something in the pressure plate and run?
wait, why dont you just drop the bottle to the pressure plate? that will activate the door and you two can survive
Bro why you don't throw item on pressure plate
You could’ve just threw a item on the plate
In the end just place a item in the plate
16:24 best funny clip
The last part u can drop an item and both of u escape 😍💅
couldn't you have thrown an item on the presure plate?
Unexpected ending
you didn't use the item frame to open the last door Ted could have escaped with you
Ohhh I understand that now, Kenadian is checking these prisons now? Glad you are working together to legitimately solve them
Ted could bave survied if u had thrown the glass botlle on pressure plate
This is so good even if it’s scripted
Idea try to escape one of kenadians prison
finally he uses kenedians skill
You could have just placed the empty bottle on the pressure plate then you two could escape ez pz
15:30 didnt the have two powdered snow buckets? they could just bridge with them ,break the glass and deactivate the clock.
4:18 i expected F5
This isn't a prison it is an escape room
But... items are entities? Wha
Bruh at the end the spy glass is a entity so you both can get out and stop being dramatic
when is your smp
when u cant see anything by jumping at the 3 block tall wall: "But then i used f5."
can’t u just use ur bucket and put it on the pressure plate
“A hoe” aka groxmc XD
btw the items in your inventory, use them to activate the pressure plate
In the last room you should have used your item frame to keep the plate down
omg grox u r evill
Grox is definitely coming here
drop 1 item to escape
bro its grox
:) You can just drop snow bucket or other item on preasure plate and you and your friend together  escape:)
"Trade me 9999999999999999999999999999 emeralds to escape the prison."         Press open chat to open chat

عرفت GROX صنع السجن
Netherite hoe  aka groxmc  I LAUGHED SO HARD ON THAT
If u kept amor stand both could escape, of ted jumped in the sectifese pit them break pressure plate, climb with snow and then I can realize
11:00 teddy could also the item frame and you could place it and he could break it and get
seawattgaming you are dump you could yust place something at the presour plate and you  both escaped!
but then i had a very good idea i used f5 see using f5 gives me a whole new perspective and i was able to see a chest i couldn't have seen before
16:00 you can use the item frame to pressure plate stay activated
I could've just jump in the lava then id re spawn to world spawn point
Lol just throw a item on the pressure plate
oh no one has to make a valiant sacrifice because we need content and also these items need to survive!
Did you know, items are entities?
Wait if grox traps villagers does that mean… your a villager!
Grox is my favourite 😂😂
Dude why dong ypu jusg use the item you have

Just drop an item in the end
Sea watt could have just put an item so they both can escape or am I wrong

When grox was like “bro what were you doing in my prison?” I laughed so hard
I really liked the video
you could have put a item on the pressure plate then both could get out
Grox is a trator
I love when Grox said "what ar u doin in my prison"

You can just place a item on the presureplate at the and bro
The last part is easy to escape you just put the item frame under the pressure plate a walked on the pressure plate once and it would stay cuz item frame counts as an entity or you could have used the two buckets of powdered snow to bridge to the TNT then break the redstone then you could use the item frame to escape ez 😂😂

Sacerfiser of grox who is behind this episode

In the end of the prison you could go earlier and mine a dirt and than drop it on the pressure plate so both of you could escape
At the end  couldnt you just place and item frame to keep it activated?
You could drop an item to the preasur plate and you could escape together
It's funny how he called GroxMC a hoe.
You could of just thrown an item on the pressure plate and you would both escape

If you noticed, Sea traded his powder snow bucket to the villager for a lecturn, meaning did not have a snow bucket anymore, but at 14:00 where Ted had to parkour back across, Sea clearly had a snow bucket with him(just an observation)
Hmmmmm
just put a item in the perusure plate  duh
Seems really scripted
At the end you could've used the item frame. When a player stands on the pressure plate you can place an item frame there and it will stay activated.
Whay didn't you please an item on the preserpleat
JUST PUT THE GLASS IN THE PLATE
i know grox he’s mean to villagers
revenge for teddy!!!!!!

Anyone got a map of this would like to download it! 😀
You could escape both using the trick with the snow . In one of the rooms you had to drop an armor stand in a hoe to spawn a viliger when you trade with him and have a bucket with snow you drop in the hoe to get the armor stand and climb up using the trick  . In the final room you put the armor stnad on the presyrplate and you two get out of this place
15:43 You could’ve thrown an item on the pressure plate so both of u could escape together
You know you both can escape you just your item at pressure plate!
U could have saved him by throwing the item into pressure place and u both could have got out
jast put an item
“Bro- what we’re you doing in my prison???”
why not just die and respawn?
bruh u can just drop the bottle to the presure plate and both of u can get out
u could have just thrown the powdered snow on the pressure and both could escape
6:02 wth lol
and also.... U ARE THE BEST YOUTUBER MAN LOVE UR VIDEOS AND KEEP UP UR AMASING WORK
why don't you throw an item on the pressure plate instead of letting teddy die?
Enough to make a grown man cry
u could have throun an item at the presure plate and then escaped both of u

Wait a minute, why not use the spyglass on the pressure plate in the last room
BRUH GROX IS SO TOXIC I ALREADY PREIDCTED IT WAS GROX SINCE GROX LIKES TORTURING VILLAGERS
He always says its IMPOSSIBLE but he always beat it
The last one you could of let someone free they get a dirt block and you put it on the pressure plate
the twisttttttttttttttttt its:  fun educational entertainining
"I can do that with my friends" When i realize im alone
Throw item on last presure plate then both escape
I guessed it right It was grox😂
The last part he can just drope a item then they both can escape and I thought they were gonna say that but ted just Sacrifice his self
Dude i love how it said subscribe to Kenadian inside the dispenser
Imagine doing a prison video with Kenadian
theman exposed himself at the end
You can throw the spy glass or glass bottle so the pressure plate will activate?
I thought it would have been hard to find the person that put them both in the prison but nope Grox just immediately said *“bro what were you doing in my prison”* also I wasn’t expecting Grox to have built that prison, I should of known because a lot of villagers were used to escape the prison and Grox loves to kill villagers and also make them pay taxes lol
bro a tip for u , udidnt need to sacrifice ted , u  could have used a item for it
bruh you can just drop a item so both of you can get out but i guess for the action
You can just put the item frame and jump
Ammm why don’t you use the item frame ghlich instead of using the armor stand
Bro you can literally throw a item at the presure plat
1 must not stay just put item and done
B R O. 🅱️UT YO ITEM ON THE 🅱️RESSURE 🅱️LATE AND 🅱️OTH GO THROUGH THE 🅱️OOR
yo is it just me ore could they place the powderd sno ind the escape rute and boeth com aut
Drop ur item lol
4:55 pull lever down -> spawn lava, put lever up and back down to quickly (before stuff gets on fire) to remove the lava that plus some good fire rng can save you the time stress
You should use reinforced deepslate cause it kinda looks better than bedrock
I like how he said "I have to craft a hoe, aka Groxmc" that was soo funny lol
Also me just use the 2 powder snow blocks to block the exit so the netherite block can get pushed back up and escape lol
You could cudof just threw the glass bottle and then both of you cud survive
😁😁😁😁
Dude... Why didn't seawatt just dropped an item in the pressure plate?!?!?! Bruh... If seawatt did that they would have escaped
god gamer XD
for the final puzzle couldn't you have just used the powdered snow buckets to bridge over to the glass, break it and then destroy the circuit by breaking the repeaters?
you couldve just drop a item on the pressure plate and both of you escape
Why don't you just put a item on the pressure plate
ummm can the leaf lava part well im no genius but if pess the lever aonce more coudnt it get rid of the lava?
You realist that you can put your items in the pressure plate and then both of you can escape right?
RIP Tedy
Ayo everybody comment the cry emoji for Teddy sacrifice 😭
Did grox made this And btw you could put the 2 powdered snow on the netherite block at the end and the the piston wouldn't have enough power to push both the block then take off your flip flops and get out of there
LOL I LOVE THE END PART WHEN GROX WAS QUESTIONING SEAWATT AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED-
Ok cool pog.

“Be honest who else is a few hours late”😂
This one was actually good the puzzles where really good
Bro... u could have just drop the bottle bruh
The ending they should put an item to hold the plate on the floor and escape
3:33 0.1% can touch grass
You COULD install hacks to escape!

As soon as I saw the title I thought ,Grox.

Actually you couldve used the item frame...
At first u could have just jumped to the lava and relogged and u get the relogging resistance and just climbed up...even tho luv ur vids❤
Do grox Prizon
8:19  Seawatt: but the jumps were 5 block jumps so he couldnt do them. me: wdym 5 block jump is possible just so u know Seawatt ( and all of this was so obvious like get better prisons )
Pov:there is a fight on school The boy who started the fight:are you gonna join the fight? Me:yup Me:Its big nose time!
You know you can just drop an item right so you and teddy can escape 15:49
Ever thought of using the bottle to put on fhe preasure plate?
Hi sea watt

Bro you can use an item to activate a pressure plate
The last part they could have used the items they have and put it on the pressure plate
Teddy we won't forget you man 💔😭
I wonder, couldn’t u just use an item to power the pressure plate at the end?
Couldn't they have thrown the empty bottle on the pressure plate? And then they both could have escaped?
You could’ve just dropped an item instead of leaving him behind.
wait.... if u say who wasant subcribed to u is arested than... 7 bilion people will get arrested
The ending is so sad 😢
this is fake
Seawatt, you could just trow your spyglass onto the pressure plate and you two can escape
grox: wow, oh ma god

subscribe to kenadian
It was a good video  .I have a tip for teddy for the pressure plate he could have dropped an item on it .
....... none of u would have to stay you could've put the spyglass on the pressure plate
to the last part where it says One must stay, they couldve break the netherite or it was to strong
You could have dropped an item to the pressure plate cuz it disappeared after one minuit
The last part all you need is an item on it right?
Should you just put an item on the pressure plate?
2:30 didnt the item frame work?
Why he didn't just jump dovn in the ending room?
So were just gonna forget how they only had 1 powder snow bucket traded it had to go back to the other room but jow

GROXMC WAAT THE SCHOOL BULLY OF ALL VILLIGERSSS😆
Why didn't you put a item In the last pressure plate?
rip grox
in the end tedy and you could have survived because if you thowed an item to the treassure plate
Bruh really items also considered as entity so throw any item in the plate and go out
Ngl, you could've jumped on the powdered snow, hold the bucket and use the boots. Then jump take the powdered snow and place it. Do it and you won't need the smooth stone and sticks
Bro seewat could of use a item to activate the pressure plate
In 16:04 they could have just drop a item in the pressure plate
Man u both can escape by placing the item frame in the pressere plate which stucks redstone forever
you can drop an item to a pressure plate and it will trigger so you guys are dum

SeaWatt: we have to get a hoe aka GroxMC Me:Grox is my second favorite YouTuber
Damn, when you got the 2 villigers, you had 2 signes, you can trade those for another powdered snow bucket, and it would have ben alot easier - _-

And you could throw items on the last presureplate in the tnt room
SeaWatt I have a tip for you if there’s lava you Leave the Game you jump in lava cuz you have 3 seconds of fire resistance to lava until you start burning and repeat
"bro what were you doing in my prison" My mad respect for Grox for doing so many prisons. 😂💯

"Bro, what were you doing in my prison?" _~ Grox 2022_
You traded you're powdered snow bucket for a lectern, then u gave it to ted and now he had to craft his sugar cane into paper. How did you get a second powdered snow bucket to get back?
BRO I ALMOST GOT A HEART ATTACK WHEN GROX SAID bro what were you doing in my prison Seawatt kill him now
... why didnt u just drop an item in the plate it still activats it
It is 12:32😠
At the end you could of placed the powdered snow on the pressure plate
Grox:bro wat are you doing on my prisone
Hello
The Groxmc joke,Bruh.
Respect for Mr. teddy, what a great man we will never forget your great sacrifice
Was that grox the villager capture person ???????
Why is grox there💀
Why just Thay put an item in the pressure plate I feel bat for tedy
Ted should not sacrifice cause you have items to drop
*F in the chat for Tedy.*
15:31, you could’ve used both powered snow buckets to bridge across, break the glass an break the redstone. ( I know that at least this part was scripted I just thought I’d point it out :)
you can just use item and escape eachother bruh
HE COULD HAVE JUST DROPPED THE USELESS BOTTLE ON THE PRESSURE PLATE AND THEY WOULD BOTH SURVIVE!!!!!! SEAWATT!!
everytime you say it seems impossible but u escape noice
well I do under stand the sacrifice but you can throw the item to the pressure plate I think ;-;
Bruh just throw an item on the plate and it open and 2 of you can escape
Groxmc
Why couldn’t u put an item on the pressure plate
And the sacrifice was sad 😭
lol of course it's Grox making a villager prison
I ve seen you with evbo
Grox says what where you doing on my prison it makes sense cuz he slaves villagers that's why it's a villager prison he will trap villagers inside the prison.
Dude it was a pressure plate an item works too you could have save him by putting an item on it dude
boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooy  you have a bottle put it on the presure plate open now both of you can get out
Him : got a a item  Fans : why didt they used items instead
U know there is a trick that u place a item frame on the floor and then step on it it will stick
8:24 subscribe to kenadian?????? Good easter egg but im already subscribed to kenadian
brug grox appers alot more here than in his youtube channel why?
https://youtu.be/K_NuepG21oI
Yo Ted leaves standing on  Is kinda sus
This is a bruh ending put the item in the plate
U always  say i use f4
You could've just dropped an item on the pressure plate to activate it, and then run out of the prison safely... Also that way both of u could've been saved
RIP MrRispole
Shout out to grox
You can just use a item to put on the preser plate
Tbh he could have thrown items on the pressure plate and both would have escaped lol Edit:nvm I realised u need an entity to activate
Gorox is dead
The sad thing is that Teddy wasted his life. If they used both buckets and placed powdered snow in the doorway, the piston wouldn’t work and you would be able to walk through it.
You can just throw an item to the pressure plate
Bruh you chould have used the item in your inv to save eachother;-;
hmm why you didnt drop your glass bottle on pressurase plate. It will opens way and you two will escape
16:03 little did he know he had a powdered snow bucket
Grox be like:bro what are you doing in my prison 🤣.   Fbi open up. We found who make that prison.
Grox is dead now
Hey what about you use your empty bottle to activate the pressure plate while throw it and you two save your lives
He will be fine it is not like it is hardcore
Why didn't throw the glasd bottle into pressure plate
This is how villager take revenge from players😂😂😂
Make a guardian prison

you could have just used the bucket you had to get water
Bro what are you doin in ma prison
Let's go, another fire prison video 🔥🔥
Hm why didnt u just take the bucket from the ddispencer and use it
Noooo tedy
Literally every prison seems impossible to him
Can they escape both by throwing there item in the pressure plate?
U could have used any item and throw it on pressure plate and both can escape
' Bro how did you get up that Villager house so fast '
16:00 you dont need a player just put an item over the plate
YOU CAN JUST PUT AN ITEM ON THE PRESSURE PLATE BRUH
Super good. Like groxwas there to.
BRO THE ENDING OF GROX SAYING Sooo calmly "what we're you doing in my prison"
You could have literally just dropped an item
you could of dropped something on that and then you and ted get out
"a hoe" In the bottom: *aka groxmc*
Can we just realise that she can just throw the item so they can both be escape?
and again suddenly grox appears
I love your vids keep up the good work!
It's pronounced "Ex-pee" not "E-ex- pee"
next time pls whit three people
I love how at the end grox came and said” yo watcha doin in mi prison
Wait, how about one was going to be on the pressure plate and the other would put both powdered snow in the piston, so it would block the netherite, and escape through the snow
Bruhhhhhhhh he could just drop the item in plate then it will activate then they can both escape
He could’ve left an item on the pressure plate._.
6:13 the more you know
3:34 god gamer lol 👀😂😂 nice video man! loved it ❤️ pls make more videos like this with more people 🔥🔥🔥 the ending lmao 😂
Bro grox was all behind this that got me there lol and you get revenge now lol
at the end you should have just thrown a item bruh
Just put a amor stand on the pressure plate and two of you survive
Bro the fucking armor stand why dint you guys has taken the armor stand you guys have the fucking powder snow
Oh god no please no, not another dum fake “prison”
Bro Drop a item
You could have dropped the spyglass on the pressure plate but since teddy sacrificed himself, You got more content!
Seawatt : i will never forget what you did teddy  *turns his head* Grox bruh what are you doing in my prison
me : breaks netherite with fist
Me
You could've just put an item in the pressure plate-
TakE Revenge!!
he will respawn
Just dropped the glass bottle at the end
Ending was dramatic
That is the puzzle Box music no I'm not joking and I know my sounds
Bruh just thow a item on the pressplate ez
Grox?! Ayo this boutta become a gun fight?
AT THE END U SHOULD HAVE USED UR ITEM
*me uses brain* : wait dont you only need to put all your stuff in the pressure plate to open it?
It was made by Kenadian! Right? It says in a dispenser "Subscribe To Kenadian"
Just use an item to make the door open
I liked that item frames aren’t useless anymore

14:55 there is literally an opening with an obsidian ring, if you could've give teddy the bucket he can save himself to
i dont think he remder that he could have just thowen his items to save him
6:03 "I needed to craft a hoe" *(aka Groxmc)* Lmao 😂😂😂
Do a 3 player next
isnt there a opening on the top? if you give teddy the bucket he can escape
BUT THEN I HAD A VERY GOOD IDEA! I USED F5 WHICH GAVE ME A WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE AND I SAW A CHEST I COULDN'T SEE BEFORE.
Just drop an item on the pressure plate
You could’ve just put the glass bottle on it but I still subscribed
Re
Teddy’s reason why he’s arrested is the same as last time

I know this is fake but... how did seawatt know that teddy was under him? For all he knows hes above him.
Bro could have just swam and tped to the other land. Kenadian video coming out?

16:00 The last dialogues in a hollywood movie 😄

16:09 U can drop a item
Grox😂
Hey sea watt the last part why won’t you use the item to escape the prison
Bottle… go on pressure plate….
GROX I KNEW IT YOU DO MAKE VILLAGERS WORSHIP YOU😂
I love how one of the dispensers is named "Subscribe to Kenadian". The guy who collabed with you recently, and the guy who exposed a few of your prison escapes 8:26
You can put an item on the pressure plate at the end
actually you could place an item ion the pressure plate so both can get through in the tnt room right?
Hiiii
You could just throw an item to the pressure plate
10:24 u could have get two leather boots wear one and get stand on the powdered snow and pass it
i was gonna say bro put some credit then the last thing: what were you doing to my prison
of corse it was grox's prison lol
For the end couldn’t you have put an item on the pressure plate?
Can't you just respond it's Minecraft
I do not get why one must stay even though you can literally drop the bottle on the pressure plate
Why your friends always tell that this prison is impossible but you escapes
my bad for saying a stone pressure plate, I should sub before I get trapped
He could have used the armor stand
sad ending
I made an escape room once based on your videos,
You can put one of your item on the pressure plate and can escape you both
We love you teddy 🙂🙂
E
What about throwing an item on the pressure plate?
15:53 you could have used an item
bro could’ve used the items he had to use the pressureplate to escape
couldnt seawatt just put the powedered snow bucket on top lf the pressure plate?
The last part when Ted is sacrificing just throw an item on the pressure plate and you both escapes
You could have sacrificed an item bruh
You could have tried to use the snow from the bucket then maybe you both could escape
U can use items on pressure plate lol
Great video! But… at the end, why didn’t you just drop an item on the pressure plate?
In 9:23, Ted doesn’t have another bucket, however, if you go to 10:36 he has a second bucket. I don’t know how he got it…
nice
i knew it was grox
but i wanna be arrested
im subbed to u
Remember what Kenadian said : "find out Who put us in the prison and get revenge"
"right of the bat" will never get old.
Bro just use 1 item to escape its not tha hard bro
WHOAAAAA UPLOADED TODAY?!
Could have escaped by using both powdered snow buckets to block the piston closing the netherite block and then walking through the powdered snow.
YES!!!! FINALLY A NEW VID!!!!! Wait,why dose the outside always look like a mob? No one really asked that!
Me: looking at the heart realize it isn't hardcore mode.  Me: ayo bro you can just die💀
I wish SeaWatt would stop talking for about 2 seconds please. He is like a machine gun with how much he talks.
bruh that's not a stone pressure plate that's a black stone pressure plate it means that it can activate the black stone pressure plate  by  an item
i subscribed, i don't wanna get arrested like teddy
U could hav put an item in the presure plate
you can leave item in it in the last
seawat: the prison is imposible to escape  also seawat:*escapes*
R.I.P. Teddy
Make a 4-part video where each part is watched in 1 of each channel: you, Evbo, Jody, and Grox.
Bro u can just drop the item at presser plate dummy
RIP TEDY
“ there is no other way “ by throwing a item on the pressure plate.
Couldn't teddy just use the lever again so the lava wont burn?

Hey why didn’t u just throw a item onto the pressure plate 😂😂😂 it could have saved both of u
broo he named the dispenser "sub to kenadian" why would u do tht he was the one tht debunked ur vids?????????? 8:25
At the end he could’ve dropped the empty potion bottle on the pressure plate to open it for the both of them.
645th
Grox: Bro what were you doing in my prison?

10:30 use the boots and snow to *climb up the wall like you did at **12:00* then just throw it to him item save goes brrrrrr
"bro what were you doing in my prison?"

2 hours early
You coulve just dropped a item on the pressure plate at the end
peanut.
Of course it was grox he was a bully to villagers
I just realized that teddy is the voice actor for Herobrine
Awesome vid as always, but I think if you put both powder snow where the door was to escape when it was open then it couldn't close again. Not sure if this works, but just a thought :p and no hate :)
Me to lol
It's not hardcore, so you can just respawn
You could of use a item
yay
I like how he couldve not listened to the sign and put the spyglass on the pressure plate lol
at the end you could have used  a item to trigger the pressure plate and both excape😅
I'm honestly impressed by the time and effort you put into these videos, Keep it up. I also work very hard on my 100 days videos!
Howdy
Armour stand was unnecessary because you could have just went higher with the powdered snow and tossed him the boots
seawatt: and yeah I made it on my first try that’s cause I’m a god gamer  Me: ugh show off, but pretty true. He is real nice at Minecraft knowing lots of glitches to pass these prisons
at the end you must drop one of your item so both of you can escape and ignore the sign
Place a titem on the plate
Couldn’t you have dropped an item on the pressure plate at the end so both of you could escape?
"im kind of a god gamer"   -seawattgaming
Teddy could’ve escaped if he just put the item frame on the pressure plate and then put an item on that item frame
"bro what are you doing in my prison"                PLUS ITSNOT A PRISON ITS AN ESCAPE ROOM
Your names Jake?
Couldnt they have just thrown an item like the snow bucket on the pressure plate
I know this might ruin it but i think ted could've dropped down during the lava powdered snow part
When Ted had to stay behind me: just put an item on the pressure plate and both get out
You should do one with kenadian
Your like dream
Bruh
EVBO won the 1M race and
It’s not impossible
Don't worry grox I already planned your funeral for you
Yay ur back!
Teddy was a great sacrofice
For the tnt end you can throw an item on the plate and both escape
Great prison vids
My favorite part was when Teddy said “oh thats crispy” 5:28
instead of the armor stand you could use the item frame lol
Keep up the work seawatt!
Drop all the things in both of your guys invarter than both of you can be free
we're so dumb why didn't you just use a item how do you know that
Bro just Use armor stand Build up to with the snow bucket both of them then take the armor stand and put it on or just leave an item
🥰❤️❤️ Todas muito lindas. Mas em primeiro lugar juntas as de números 10 e 1. Uma .Zeimbut.Host morena e outra loira.Seria injusto se eu escolhece 4..fo..Love duas são as minhas preferidas no topo da son...
wait couldn't you have used an item for the blackstone pressure playe
Instead of letting teddy die you could've placed powdered snow on the netherite block and went right through it
why didn't he drop the  bottle
the next video can it be an allay?
When u could've used an item
On the last level you could had threw your item on the thing but you killed your friend.
So close to 1mil keep it up
Instead of destroying the netherite or destroying the TNT they decided to sacrifice
Remember the ice prison
With the netherite block door, as master Ivory once said, never forget the f3+t trick
POV: Waiting for 2 player prison with Seawatt and McBirken
Bruh
Nice bra
Get revenge!
You can use water battle
The grox at the End Was unexpected💀💀
That took Teddy a while to blow up…
Ohkk
eeeeee
Item dropping on pressure plate: *Am i a joke to you?*
his name is JAKE?
just drop ur items on the pressure plate tf
This so scripted on minecraft you can't heal wen on fire it needs to be  half a heart
Finally it’s here     Were you expecting something?
Thing at the end was funny You never fail to make the perfect cliffhanger
Noooooooooo your friend blued up in minecraft😔😢😭😭😭😭😭😭
So fake but so good
At the part where it said one must stay they could have thrown down an item
THE PRISON IS IMPOSSIBLE/EXTREME TO ESCAPE wins every prison escape
please make a prison video with groxmc
At the last room you can just drop the items in your inventory that you have into the pressure plate and then u guys can both escape
You could have put a item on the pressure plate
I learned some really cool tricks but couldn't you just drop an item on the pressure plate and it would stay open? Great vid man keep it up
Bro for the end u could of placed down an entity or sum
Bro Yuo could of put an item on that presser playe
Or just  throw the item on the preassure plate and all  escaped
nice video man! i hope my channel blows up like yours bc im thinking of giving up cuz im getting no more subs :(
Use an item to activate the pressure plate 16:10
JUST PLACE A ITEM ON THE PRESSURE PLATE.
bro at the end you just could throw item at the plate and you both can leave safety
You really like to type in capital letters
So Grox made that!?
That Grox joke was amazing
honestly i thought you whould say you little when you met grox
eeeeeee
OMG that was so good can you plzzzz make a part 2
new seawatt video just dropped
Ngl this would be a prison for grox
You guys could have just put one of your items on the pressure plate
NEUTRAL ENDING: Teddy decided to stay and get blown to Smithereens but you still survived the villager escape room. (They put you here on accident, grox was supposed to be here)   GOOD ENDING:  You and teddy realized that you can use a tool and with the last second you put the spyglass and run to the exit both still alive   BAD ENDING:  You didn’t have enough time to decide who should stay the door closes then the tnt hisses and you and teddy have failed the villager escape palace   GOD ENDING:  you and teddy were never put there but groxmc had to stay to pay for his sins to all villagers
It kinda would be better if grox was with you in the prison but I still liked it.
Wait. Couldn’t you have used the spyglass and thrown that on the pressure plate so you could both escape?
"We have to craft a hoe" Aka groxmc Holy shit that was funny
you know if you put enought items you can make the pressure plate weight down
the end :(
Throw the item
Hello I Subbed and liked
Bruh the ending
Ooh the end is kinda spicy
Put some item floating on the pressure plate bro
Make a story episode Continuing this
Ey didn’t he use a item to use the pressure plate
I like how he punches his friend everytime  I mean everyone does that who dosent? It just bcuz its a minecraft prank bro XD
Oh boy, Just like the main series, GROX IS THE ANTAGONIST WOOOOOO CROSSOVER BETWEEN PRISON ESCAPE AND THE MINECRAFT VILLAGER'S STORY WOOOOOO!!!!! (I like this.)
Bruh Grox Said What Are U doing in my prison
I love seawatt  ❤️
It’s sad that Ted didn’t think to flip the lever to stop the lava after sea got through
Wait couldn’t you use a item? Do hold down the pressure plate? Of wait that was a black stone one so it couldn’t do that
6:55  bruh what stress the lava was not rising ??
just drop the bottle on the preseure plate
I"M EARLYYY
Um why didn't Teddy flip the lever again?
Can we talk about how long he build that
i knew it was grox
10:23 Ted could have just dropped you the item frame and you can do the item frame glitch again but your strategy worked as well.
couldn't you just reverse the lava by pressing the lever 3 times after entering the room?
“I needed to craft a hoe,”aka groxmc” had me laughing 😂 😂😂😂😂
Man I'm loving these escape rooms... err prisons. Keep it up guys! Hope you get to 1mil subs soon
5 block jumps?  (dream) its possible, i have one shot at this!
Why did they not just throw item on the thing.  Yes, I understand it said one must stay, but it did not say person.
He could of used an item
I'm telling all my friends to unsubscribe because u just bother us about it
In the beggining of the video, you could have just jumped over the pit of lava, placed the boat midair and gone into it before you touched lava, and with that boat you could have glitched outside of the prison, get stuff, and use boats, fire res, e-pearls, etc to get teddy out too. There's about 4 more solutions I could think of, but imma save that part for kenadian c; (p.s. this is just a joke seawatt has one of the best content on youtube and it was really fun to watch this pls dont take this the wrong way)
Seawatt you can use your item to place the item in the preasure plate
Every time u Upload seomthing I sub then I seawattsup
Its all Grox's fault
6:16 YOU JUST SAID E-X-P
There was actually a way for them both to escape by simply going down and getting the armor stand from the pit breaking the pressure plate and using powder snow to build up again and then with two powder snow snack them up besides the stone crusher plate put down the armor stand and escape and that's how two people could have escaped so this was the bad ending
Could have put both powdered snow blocks in the doorway and then just walk through the powdered snow
I haven’t quite looked yet but I bet people are complaining about some fault’s about the video (like the netherite piston doors) but sometimes people need to understand that nothing is full proof in Minecraft and we should just enjoy the time and effort put into the videos
Teddy was a brave man, his sacrifice will never be forgotten 💙 ❤️ 😢
I got the shivers at the end anyone else
Mission impossible but in minecraft
Lol groxmc oviosly it was him bc it was literally a villager
bruh who says (e)-xp
I feel like Groxmc put you in that prison
*conserving resources go brrrr* 1:37 put the boat on the other side and getting in it super fast
3:31 youre not a god.dont think your a god gamer.
EZ think
You shouldnt just drop an item in the last room
Eyyyy story
Grox?
Kenadian? Hello? We need you.
so easy and fake
4:39 *press* the lever?
The friend: *respawns*
Just use a are there
Finally, another prision escape.
fake!!!!!!!!!!!!
You can just drop an item to escape
He could have put an item on the pressure plate
When seawatt put the boots on teddy's armor stand I expected something else. remember how in the beginning teddy used a item frame and broke it to get it up to seawatt? Well I expected that teddy was gonna drop the item frame teddy had and drop it down to seawatt and seawatt was gonna use the same trick that teddy used at the beginning of the video.
Wwwait hol’up that dispenser said to subscribe to Kenadian?????!!!
good video keep going man ;)
THE WAY HE SAID GROXMC WAS A HOE-
Teddy respond because it's not hardcore
Bruh grox
R I p teddy
This gave me we were here vibes
06:03 man disrespected grox in a single sentence holy
Wait did grox did the pri-
Hope you get to 900 K soon!
You could have throw a item on the pressure plate lol
Grox: bro what were you doing in my prison? SeaWatt: _it is time for revenge_
You shouldn't use the item frame to get it to him
Question, instead of murdering teddy, couldn't you just throw an item on the pressure plate?
“Im a god gamer”
#getseawattto1mil
nice! you are very good at prisons
play fortnite insad its a good game
oreo
I LOVE seaWattGaming prisons villagers prisons
Plz do hide if hunt
Seawattgaming could’ve just dropped an item like the glass bottle
Well, it's not impossible if you beat it is it?
You never dissapoint
you guys are dumb give him powderd snow place powderd snow swim throgh powderd snow for both of you to escape
E
Damn the lava part seemed so intense, the raised voice of SeaWatt's narrating makes it seem more panicked and adds to the effect a lot good job
Ummm...The spyglass tho....You could've just put it on top of the preasureplate to activate it and you both can get out
I think i know who made the villager prison  -Grox
I wished Grox was there edit:he was
My boy is back.
Dam grox got violated
hold on... 15 secs into the vid teddy says he was arrested for nt subscribing. does that mean if i dont subscribe i get to do an escape with him? :0. jk love ur content. :)
I just love how grox shows UP at the end
You can see that seawatt is a very wanted criminal but not very good at escaping the cops because he is always in jail.
Didn’t check lava 1:37
Get your here within an hour ticket here \/ (quick)
EARLYY
You called groxmc a ho
GROX
when you realize at the end he could have used his items to keep the pressure plate activated:
"I made it on the very first jump cuz im kinda a god gamer"
15:50 bruh just use a item
15:55 Ted: i will stay behind; i guess this is what i get... for not subscribing to seawatt. seaWatt: Wait, Teddy, there is gotta be an another way Ted: There is no other way, just go! Me: Noooo wait just drop an item to the pressure plate and both will escape! I am sure this is the twist SeaWatt: **leaves the prison and let his friend blow up** Me: *...*
Plot twist he made the prison
can i play with u i have none to play with and i really am bored
Grox 💀
The villager prison reminds me of Grox
So Grox locked you up?
I’m wearing black socks
LMAO THE END
Hi
Wtf
6:02 Hopes Grox don't see that
I'm honestly impressed by the time and effort you put into these videos, Keep it up!💚
the last part you could have thrown an item from far away giving you time
My discord
you can escape prison together by using spyglass to power pressure plate.
Wait, so kenadian making the prison?
You could put one item on the pressure plate
foxyboy yt#9743
Whoever make these prisons are very good at making prisons this is awesome
Bedrock edition be like IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!!!!!
Ted and you aren’t subbed to me that’s why your there I told grox to put you there
10:42 just use the snow bucket to climb up to him and give the boots can’t you do that ?????
Seawatt one question
Hello seawattgaming please reply
When you pulled your friend ted up, he had the lava parkour and he could also craft a bucket, while I'm not sure how deep the lava was I know that if you click fast enough you can sprint across while picking up the lava. (just a fun fact) :) I loved the video though
Join my giveaway everyone
How did he get the item frame?
8:42 Seawatt had the sign when they found the cubby (if you put the clip in the wrong spot i understand)
tbh this is kinda bad prison design and found multiple flaws. It is more of a showcase of features than a actual prison escape
I like how u make vids with your friends and i like the one when u had to guard the party with that zomebie
A
The villager looks sick
why didnt u use the boots and go up make 2 boots
15:53 you can just drop an item above it you know?
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos_🟥
Cool map
Is that prison meant to trap villagers! Oh no Grox
Can you please put the download for the map? I would love to play this w/ my friend
Oh No!! You weren't Supposed to be in here it was for Grox
i bet you guys got stresed out when trying to escape
Cool
scripted cuz like how did the librarian get paper trade twice in a row
“I made it the first jump becuase am a god game😩”
Hahahhaha I laugh when Grox  said bro what were u doing in my prison imagine what seawatt will do o him 🤭🤭🤭
Early TvT
Even though im not the one doing this prison this made me so stressed
I love your videos they are so fun to watch when I’m bored! ❤️
not me at the end screaming "USE THE GLASS BOTTLE"
do a 3 player prison next
Did anyone see that the dispenser was called subscribe to kenadian 8:25
"i had an idea, i used f5"
Just asking could you have put the powder snow at the end or just thrown it at the pressure plate
you could've thrown an item on the pressure plate
I loved the "Subscribe to Kenadian" Thing
I love these videos great job seawatt 👍
Early
I love trying to play along with you! I also learn something new every time I watch a prison escape video!
BRO the script and prisons combine!
Hi
“Bro, what were you doing in my prison?”
Wait couldn’t he just put a item at the end?
Why didn't you do what you did in 12:01 to give the boots in for 10:26
Bet
Wait you could’ve done something you can take wood then make a wood presser plate then break the other one then put the wooden pressure plate then put a item then you both get out
This is amazing well edited and awesome prison
Dude the ending was sad and funny the sad part when teddy died and the funny part when Grox ask you what are you doing in his prison
Grox, dip
Use the armor stand
I’ve been waiting for this for the *WHOLE* day Finally it’s out!!!
Sacrifice has made
