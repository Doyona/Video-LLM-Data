Where is your dining table from?
It certainly does not look like a AGA .. nothing like one .

I don't think you should be spiteful towards influencers just because of the amount of money they earn. Yes we wish some jobs could get as much money as that but the negative energy shouldn't just be shot at the influencers. just sayin'. Even influencers work to get where they are (if it was so easy you would be a successful influencer too by now right?) Anywsy the point is that it's not their fault.
can you mate with your boyfreind please
7:23 That has to be the smartest thing. Cus for me getting my clothes to do laundry is so hard. I always lose my socks and i feel like this will help.
Rich bastards! I’ve been working hard in construction for 25 years and I ain’t coming close to living like this posho.
Oh wow!!! How amazing is your house!! You've done amazingly!!! It's beautiful!
This house is beautiful but not safe from my face, because all windows are glassy and easy to break and enter from
I dnt want to be jealous but I'm. Two year older with a medical degree and im stil managing myself. congratulations girl, u deserve it
😮nice home
Nice
the fact that people work hard there whole life and influencers will come along and be able to afford this..
How do u not cook??
Glad you got what you want but isn't everyone cup of tea, and is okay, as long you like it..But not impressed...at list isn't my style
Not just 'always' wanted to do it. But 'always, always'.  🙄
تشبه رغدة
Awww your home is beautiful xx
Really impressive transformation!
All about game of money nothing else
I want to rebuild my old home and for sure looking forward on building a movie theater 😍
The before and after is crazy!
Your house is such a dream!
Absolutely stunning ❤
Cutest most beautiful woman God took his time on you ❤
Monday 12 February 2024       I also live in the Uk and it is obvious how small the houses are     I think you have done an excellent job turning this house into a home ❤❤❤
Expected from a white gal that she doesn’t cook 😂😂😂
WHY? why is dining seperated from the kitchen by the living area? The clothes/washing system is not really unnecessary, but the huge kitchen is, considering, that you cannot cook... all show? well thats's todays reality. Anotherone fire-wood although you have a gas fireplace xD loool... but hey you have to like it. well done.
Love this home design 💕😊
Hi Saffron, if you don't mind me asking, where did you say you purchased your dining room table from?
Secret doors but proceeds to show all of the internet 😂 x
House tour video 👍
Who’s house is it ?😂
Look at these secret doors that I’m gonna show to the world because they’re so secret 😊
This is hands down one of the best styled and designed houses I've ever seen. I keep coming back to this video
Why do influencers make more money than doctors who are saving lives
Nice house, nice decor but the layout well as the decor could’ve been much better! :) Congratulations
Your house is so beautiful,just a small suggestion,maybe you could change your red panic buttons to white so they are not so obvious.
Some of yall are so negative my god who hurt some of yall
Two years??? I designed and built a 5000 sf home in seven month. I did not speak much English, had no clue of the imperial system, had never seen wooden construction (I came from Germany) and I had to pass the tough local building department and a very discriminating architectural review committee in a gated community. I started construction in July and moved in before Xmas. Any idiot can build a house if you give them two years and they can do it in their own country in their own language.
The world has  gone crazy, to think that she is a influencer. Hate that word and it means I do nothing. Does she safe children, stop wars, stop knife crime, stop grooming… I guess not
Yep she probably affords this because of doing OF 💀
Saffron! Congratulations for all your success! Your energy and positivity are always so infectious! Speaking of positive vibes, I am reading a transformative SOULBLAZING book by @lisahaisha, a talented life coach. Her wisdom on personal growth and transformation is truly remarkable. You're both an inspiration, and I'm sure you'd appreciate Lisa's powerful insights just as much as I do. Keep spreading the good vibes!
no pantry?...
I enjoyed watching the progress of this being built! Cool to see inside of it 🤠
https://youtu.be/PGOF_FSR__g?si=8JOCG9fK2TcZlFyr
that is such a beautiful house
The house looks soooo amazing, out of this world!! From the TV setup, to the kitchen, to laundry chute, to the back garden and to the stairs, everything works so well together😍
Hmmmm
Amazing ❤❤❤❤❤
Your home is stunning ❤ from Julie from Wrexham
I don't think I would have devided the room like that with the tv and fireplace I would have just had one open room because if that first room is your living room then what is the room with the sofa I think I would have left it open and put the tv and fireplace on the wall but other than that it's gorgeous.
Congratulations  May the Lord bless your home and bless you and everyone who comes in it in Jesus Named  Happy for you always the person who is grateful 😇 and humble will continue to receive the best
I love this so much but my fam can’t afford this
This house is also my dream house :) The sparkling water, the cinema, stunning fireplace, the hidden places and that security thingy - genius
Saff, is your dining table from Olivia’s too? Absolutely gorgeous, stunning home! Well done!👏👏💕
Very ordinary so boring...
11:46 'I don't read' - yeah, I'd never have guessed🤣
I love this ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I live in a new construction home, but my Dream Home will always have High Ceilings a Farmhouse Sink a large fireplace With Mantel and Giant High Tall Ceiling Windows
What a stunning house full of surprises.
Is in London??????
This is a beautiful house❤
Love that you maintain a spirit of gratitude for everything you have! You inspire me <3
احب لهجة بريطانية❤❤
Beautiful house but the kitchen is in the wrong place that couch that she has in the living room doesn’t do any justice she needs to hire it into a decorator
She should’ve got an interior decorator
massive! ❤
*Me whenever I watch house tour in Youtube* : I'm gonna build this house for my sims
Your dream. house. Did you wake up yet? How ridiculous  is it being in it, not  cozy, cold,dull, miserable.but sure you didn't  wake up yet..how many homeless  people could sleep there for one night.🤧
your builder is a genius
watched so many actors,celebrity houses 90% , have zero taste ,missing character in a house .have money no taste but who i .i don't even  care its just funny people have fame live in boxes omg.
You have improved that house 200%  Absolutely stunning.   Love the kitchen, the utility room and the laundry chute. Genius.   The piece in the middle of your living room is called an ottoman. It’s gorgeous   A pouffe is a small foot stool.
Not to be cheeky but who is this woman and is she rich?
Omg simply the best home tour ever.  Honestly your house is amazing ❤. May God keep blessing you🥰😘
💜
House is very LA.
show the basement
Well done!
Dear, you have dowry system??👍
Looks stunning. I think I would want to swap the dining and lounge areas over though.
FYI:When the revolution happens,  the mob will target you.
idk why but I thought British people only live in apartments
Nice Home
က်န္မရဲ႕ရည္မွန္ခ်က္စိတ္ကူးယာဥ္ လြယ္လြယ္လုပ္လို႔ရတဲ့လုပ္ငန္းမ်ိဴးမဟုတ္ဘူး
0:09 omg I thought I was on Chef Johns channel for a minute 😂
You worked for this, congratulations, home is lovely…. Enjoy 😉🤛🏻🇬🇧xxxx
A lot of comments show jealousy and its really sad I have never heard of this lady until 5 minutes ago.   You go girl, over 2 million subscribers, good on ya
5:03 q: why does the oven have so many knobs
I watch these to keep the dream alive. I will do the same thing in my life. Within the next 7 years. 🙏🏾
Go to school, get a student loan, get a 9-5, mortgage, marriage,  blah, blah, blah 😂 Absolutely stunning! Smart girl congratulations 🎉🎉
Wow, wish I could be this blessed 🥺
Is it in london ?????
The fact that I'm wearing an IBIZA shirt 😂
You have done amazingly well. You had a vision and went for it. 😊
What a beautiful home 😍 May you enjoy many many years making memories there ❤️
how did you get your tv done
litterally my dream house lol 😍
AWESOME  L❤VE 2 MATT!!!😊🎉❤
Winning 🥇 🎉
FAN-FLIPPIN-TASTIC GIRL
The way I enjoyed your video 😍😍😍😍 Your home is gorgeous!!!
That worth a million
Beautiful home!.
i love you
Jesus is KING 👑-God bless you all-Dios Los cuide a todos.
The oven looks nothing like an Aga....
Come into my house that you mugs payed for
That's it people keep supporting this air head while you 45 hours a week inna crappy job and struggle to pay rent
This right here is what you call fuck off money!  She rich rich and good on her hahaha
Sugermommy vibes
You can tell how happy Saff is about her house! She’s literally glowing
I’m new here does anyone know what flooring she has down in the open plan living/dining kitchen space?
Beautiful
ottoman is what the "stool, foot rest by couch is called"
Saffron, girl, the house is amazing 😍 I would love to have one like that. But, thank you for making me realize that I actually don't need one that big. Let me know how the cleaning goes 😊
Love the laundry shoot idea but how's that pass fire regs? Especially if it's a hole between upstairs and your kitchen?
Have a shot everytime she says 'actually'.
Take a shot every time she says “my house” 😳
How’d have thought 16 year old saffron I started watching would turn into this
My advice, it's not wise to show your secrets doors/rooms on the internet..you never know who's watching
I would put the dining table between the kitchen island and the TV. That way you don't have to walk across the whole room with the food. Then make the sitting room on the other side!!
I love this house soooooo much it's the best house I have ever seen 🤩
Who t f is this person? I have no idea 🤷‍♀️ what a sad world we live in we celebrate people in pictures and filters and shit on our doctors and nurses. Fair play to her whoever she is but I’m guessing she didn’t break her balls for this
Not a hate comment but you don’t thank your viewers all the time, you’ve said thank you once in the past year. No point saying you have when you haven’t
Lmao I’m so annoyed we didn’t see the upstairs
What’s the secret to be able to afford a house like that. After university I’m struggling financially and she’s living the life. What’s the secret guys?
Good for you!
your house  🏠 looks bloody fabulous 🥰saff  !!
lol that does not look like an aga...
Damn
The home before had so much character and potential. It's a shame it's turned into something that will be out of style in 10 years.
it’s shocking how high educational occupations such as nurses, lawyers and doctors can’t make this much money compared to people who upload a 15 minute video and get millions of dollars
It’s gorgeous ❤❤❤
Actually?
STUNNING! 💗🌈
Girl…you need to get an interior designer……
insane house, just a shame her voice is annoying as hell
Can I come take selfies in all your mirrors 😂
This is a pretty cool house, we want to do something similar with a cinema room at our house too; super cool. My friends shaaanxo have the same stair case btw, except they put LEDs on each step.
Why would anyone care about what house a talentless grifter lives in?  yawn.
I'm in LOVE with the colour! LOVE LOVE LOVE
I love Adam so much xx and thanks again for your loss on this one last time and it is so good that we can get a taxi to the club the same day we were there for a couple hours of work to get the ball down with a few more than likely be in my
It is BEAUTIFUL! CONGRATS.
Congs on the house, BEAUTIFUL!!! 🔥in fact when I get older this is for sure my house inspo. Also ur really gorgeous😍
Wow amazing ❤
I lOvE iT
Do ou live in the uk but this is an amazing video
Imagine going up the stairs drunk lol
I love how she’s still holding her remote 😂
Never know. Her before,just comes across recommendations on YT. Her success inspires me so much. This would literally be my house❤
👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌👸👸💝💝🇲🇦🇲🇦
Dose you’re house have a pool?
You’re house looks so homey ❤
Throw university out of the window kids. Aspire to be a airhead sellout and this is what you could be living in ✌
Omg this is such an amazing house I would never be able to make a house like that😀😀
People saying what a hard worker etc. doing a 60 hour week for minimum wage in a factory with no windows is a hard worker. Nurses and care workers earning next to nothing is hard working. Posting a few videos online every now and then and receiving ridiculous amounts is not hard work. What a insane world we live in.
Absolutely gorgeous home!
Super nice😊
Looks more like a clinic but a nice one
I wish me and kat lived in a house like this
There are so many people hating on her wealth and I get it to an extent but this girl really redid the hell out of this house and it’s beautiful!! As long as she’s grateful and thanks God for her blessings this young woman hit a milestone in her life 🤩 Congrats I hope it brings you comfort 😻
Girl! You need to put like a 20 foot long custom dining table in that entry. You need to talk to Matt ;)
Omg so her brother is Lexi hanzlers boyfriend
House is nice but its waste of energy to heat .
love!
Has anyone counted how many times she said ‘my house’? 😂😂
Wow but don’t show too much to people
A lot of illuminati one eye, black and white checkered symbolism going on around the house. They obviously have paid it all for you in that you sell your soul to the devil to get to where you are now…..
Saffron are you married😭
You seems so proud when you say “I don’t read” 😅😅
I remember when I got amused by looking at the home video where the twister game got funny on their floor
Saffron wow wow wow u slayed ur glow up is ❤
Molly-Mae 👀taking notes ✍🏼
Absolutely incredible renovation! Respect to the builders as well
bro
So beautiful😍
So the lesson learnt in this video is...if you want a house like this ...don't bother trying to go to college/uni to get yourself a job to possibly save lives,teach children,keep people safe etc...instead pick up a camera 😅😅😅 Jesus 🤦🏻‍♀️ that's me unsubscribing ( and no I am not jealous,that is not why I am commenting before the saffron defence army comes for me)
I love it! It looks so modern but at the same time cozy which is absolutly stunning. I love the colorful peaces because i think it would be just a little bit boring and just unpersonal. Congrats on your new beautiful home.
wow been piggin out lol
Love that the remote stayed with you for the remainder of the tour
The fact doctors and people with degrees don't earn this much but you earn this much its so not fair for people who actually work extremely hard..
Congratulations 🎉
Crazy doctors don’t have houses like this :(
There is no hope in going with the latest trends and fancy houses you will always be looking for more come to the loving savior who will fill you if you keep seeking him he can fill you with his Holy Spirit. Today is the day of salvation come to the loving savior To the loving savior repent and do not go to hell Come to Jesus Christ today   Jesus Christ is only way to heaven  Repent and follow him today seek his heart Jesus Christ can fill the emptiness he can fill the void  Heaven and hell is real cone to the loving savior today  Today is the day of salvation tomorrow might be to late come to the loving savior today   John 3:16-21   16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.  Mark 1.15  15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.  2 Peter 3:9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.  Hebrews 11:6 6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. Jesus
you got a big agar and you can not cook , i will be your chef lol
well done its ben a dream of mine too n to put a squash court in it
Aww girl your home is STUNNING❤ so proud of you🎉
I said this before in the comments but I said again this just does not look like a home in the UK definitely looks like something you find in North America like the United States of Canada, nice place great tour
im so happy and proud of you!!!
Who is she?
You go girl! This is amazing.
this is a really nice house, just not my style. its nothing to do with you though! i like more cosy and i love plants 🌱 i also love cosy rooms and yeah, love the house though!
Fair play making so much money from no talent and a basic personality. The world is a crazy place

Honestly all these negative comments like fr 😂 for all we know she’s most likely saved hard for her dream house if she’s an influencer earning the money to then why flipping not… if it was you in her position pretty sure you wouldn’t appreciate the irrelevant comments made to you about the money you earn blah blah blah. Instead of worrying about how she afforded her house go and out and achieve something yourselves and earn good money it ain’t impossible it’s just laziness people.
Amazing house, looks cold though, hope the heating is on xxxx
I would fall down the laundry shoot
How the hell does that look like an aga? That aside congratulations
Money doesn’t buy class it is such a tacky style and looks void of any homely feeling and she will keeping buying, changing, altering and she will never be satisfied. She is crass, cheap and one of life’s knock off wrapped up in opulence. Show show show, me me me, drama drama drama a life just simply not fulfilled, you’re a gaping black hole that just isn’t self aware….yet.
Does anyone know where her grey trousers are from? 😍
@fashionfindercindy
This house is stunning. Such a power move, investing in her future and an amazing home for whatever comes her way!
this is amazing !
i work full time and can’t even afford a loaf of bread 😭😭😭
"it's pure laziness, it's so unnecessary." I've never related to a line more before in my life. I'm saving this as an idea for my future house at 102☺️✌️
It’s so stunning but I will say those dining chairs are £650 each like how much does an influencer make (this isn’t hate she has worked really hard for it)
No influencer should earn more than a nurse. The system is unfair.
Bruh she’s such a brag sad that money goes to ppl like her
whens the house party then? haha
Your home is beautiful 🤩🤩🤩 it’s goals enjoy your blessing 🤩✨👏🏽🎉❤️
soo happy for you Saff🎉 Amazinggg❤
Literally showing everyone where your ‘secret’ stuff is 😂😂
Amazing house that she can live in. Alone
i think you should put the dining table where your sofa is and put the sofa on the other side opposite the other tv x
https://youtube.com/@maryamcorner8252
❤
Who's this😭
Their income is mental to afford this… I get they put in the work and she deserves her success and house but I can’t help but think of workers of the nhs, teachers etc…
I used live here❤
me watching this vid with £11.50 in my bank account
whos the guy in the cinema room with her 😍
First, it is a stunning home, and second, my suggestions: more window treatments and more wall art. But overall, it's a great starting point
This is so cool you're amazing that you have this lovely house, thanks for sharing your beautiful house with us! You're an angel <3
Dream, dream, dream ✨
On a very basic level, just out of curosity,did she literally start out by making videos discussing her mundane, everyday life? Call me old fashioned, but how exactly is that 'hard work'.  Maybe it was how I was raised, but hardwork used to be full time jobs, up early, have a skill, training etc. For my job I am lucky enough to get to watch surgeons fix broken pelvises so people can walk again, they have dedicated their lives to helping others. Telling people what you are wearing for the day just doesn't seem like you are bringing anything to the table.  Maybe I am being ignorant, if someone could enlighten me to what she actually does that would be great.
U definitely remind me of Gemma Louise mills and u like a bit like lexi hensler
Wow so amazing can I ask when you started you you tube channel you have done absolutely brilliant and how many subscribers do you need to get payed xx thanks
Your house is stunning!!! Have you though about switching your living room and dinning room around, the you could have more seating in your living room and a beautiful chaise lounge by the window al the end 😍
Absolutely love everything about it you’ve smashed it ❤❤
Doctors are doing just fine. Stand outside Stanmore Hospital in Middlesex at 5:00pm and watch all the supercars being driven home.
This is the first video of you that I'm watching and I love what I'm seeing. Congratulations 🎊 😊
The kitchen is so disappointing
Wow dream home 🏡
Her house is identical to mollymaes ? No originality
Amazing !! Your house is gorgeous
THIS IS MY DREAM HOUSE OMG
for the space that is there....the place could have been decorated sooooo much nicer like it is weird how ur sofa just randomly sits there ...the sofa isnt that nice anyway ...i dont know i geuss you dont have this talent of how to put this place together
This video makes me so mad that I want to cry. Me barely holding it together not knowing if I have enough food to last the week and if my babies milk will run out whilst people the same age as me are living it up like this looking down on the rest of us. I feel like im living in a dystopian society (a hunger games world)
That oven does not look at all like an aga😂
Very nice house, love the minimalist approach and open areas. Inspiring!!
damnn the before tho
Beautiful house
e
Just found your page - Congrats!!!
Saffron, your house is a slice of paradise!!! What a beauty! Wish I could hop across the pond and watch a movie with you!!!
Love it.
It looks amazing,  but not a fan of the downstairs , alot of space wasted I would of had the kitchen the other side to avoid that waiting area scenario,  but apart from that stunning and congratulations 🎊 👏
i’m so baffled wheres the stove top
so so happy and proud of you! you deserve this so much!
Amazing job - Congratulations, I built my own house with some help from relatives and I know the effort it takes. Everything can be achieved if there is no lack of enthusiasm and effort.🙂#retiredhandyman
What a beautiful home Saffron x
Wow!! It’s so beautiful!! Congrats 🎉
Ohh my gosh my first time in your channel and I love it already what a house
Did you Need a house this big or was it just a statement piece? 🫤 Do not envy cleaning that nor the energy bills 😂
how much is your revastion
A white version of vikstars house 😂
When you grow up you might realise how pointless this all is.
You look about ten. What does Daddy do?
I agree I would definitely make when you first walk in as the lounge room and near the kitchen can be the kitchen table 🥰
That is sickkkk!!!!
omg girl  so  proud of you your house is beautiful
Wow amazing 😍😍😍
Tbh I would obviously love an amazing house like this. But I understand she’s worked hard running her YouTube channels and doing tv etc to get it i understand the effort involved to obtain what she has and know I just don’t have the patience nor energy to do the same lol. Her house is beautiful and it’s a reflection of how hard she’s worked to achieve what she has. Some of these comments scream jealousy. This girl is self made she did this she worked hard and was ambitious and got to where she is I can’t understand those knocking her down it wasn’t just handed to her. She should be proud of what she’s achieved
Congratulations girl 👏👏
Your house is absolutely beautiful. It was definitely worth the wait.
Some people wondering at the cinema part , if that is saffrons boyfriend🤔🤔🤔🤔😍
Lol saffs got this amazimg house and Ana's renting a flat 😂😂
“Saf can I have some sparkling water please?”  “Of course, just go to the sink” 😂
Oh my god im So proud to see a woman building this by herself ! Its time we learned how to renovate our own homes! We dont neeed men !  Make more videos on how u use all the tools
I love watching your videos! Your new home looks incredible. We are going to remodel the entire downstairs of our house in the new year - do you have any tips how to stop the dust migrating right through the house? With a new baby and 3 kids at home, that’s the bit I’m really dreading… Any tips are appreciated!
Such a gorgeous home! Thanks for the tour
such a beautiful home, great job<3
I’d swap the long marble table with the couch near the kitchen
Some people's needs for attention are mind-boggling... Barker and Groanhouse...
finally lol
SHE HAS MY DREAM HOUSE LIKE LITERALLY.. my fav part of the house was probs the fire place in the living room and that laundry thing that’s connected from the toilet to the laundry room, everything in the house just make sense ❤
Blegh
Isn't it dangerous to have your flat screen TV only 3 feet above your heating source (even if it's an artificial flame)?
I really had no idea Youtubers make this much money once they cross 1 million subscribers. Dang!
An amazing home! Something we can all dream of one day 🤞🏼 I would swap the dining & lounge round x
I'm just at minute 2:30 and I am already "so many windows to be cleaned" 🤦🏻‍♀️😂😂😂 Who has time for this? Also? Hello!! privacy?? 😂
I just bumped here and i love her already. You are a dream in motion that's already actualized.
Well, done saffron. If it makes you happy that’s all that matters 🤘🏼
Wow this’s INSANE 🤯
And This Folks is Why Bills Are So High! The Carbon Foot Print on This Dwelling Must Be Redonculas !!! If I had Loads of Money n No Brains I'd put it to much better use Like Building a Whole Housing Estate and Rent it Out to Less Fortunate Folk Cheap as Chips!!!!
Where are your trousers from
Props to saffron, the house is beautiful. Mildly concerned for her showing off her whole house after what happened with molly mae and tommy, may not have been the smartest idea
I have never heard of you but this video popped up as I am into home reno but your house is stunning, im taking notes for my build😂😘
Cost of living crisis and your flaunting your money really poor taste at the moment a lot are struggling etc
Lovely!
l love your dream home its like a movie house like l love it the hidden doors the concept and the aesthetically pleasing and the designs look amazing . visuals:100% aesthetic:100% everything
You've just shown a burglar all your house layout and security button. If you want privacy keep it private.
Influencers who’ve never worked a day in their life, showing off how rich they are, during a cost of living crisis, nah not a good look, tone deaf doesn’t even cover it. Bin 🗑🚮
WOW Nice HOUSE
How beautiful 😍
i think this is bad
My my my
Inequality in its poorest form! Meanwhile they strike in academics economically, underpaying doctors and architects, and laying off families in this society 15 times in 6 years... Incredible achievements 🎊☝️🙌
Omd I want that cinema I would never leave 😂
So much love and vision has gone into this house ❤❤❤ well done❤❤❤
The tango ice machine is so cool!!!
Wow I’m inspired
You don’t care about anyone, never give back
What a dream🥺🔥🔥🔥
I love your taste🫶🏾
You deserve all the success that you have Saffron! Keep up the amazing work!
You should be incredibly proud of yourself, your home is stunning🥰🥳
Wow i love it😍
Impresionante
looks exactly like Grace Beverly's house
where are the house plaaaaantsssss
Why did I see the thumbnail and think it was a sims build
You hooked me with that intro!
It’s lovely.  The wonderful thing about open plan living is versatility of furniture placement.  Have you considered placing your dining table closer to the kitchen, then you’re not having to carry food across the entire space?
It looks like a range cooker not arga
Your house is literally stunning! You did a really great job and you made it how YOU want it which I love. I love the youthful touch of your love of slushies and the cinema room looks really professional and great and it’s interesting how the seats are separated. I don’t know anything about you because this is my first time seeing you, but you seem very organised. Also I love the secret doors! And you gotta believe in yourself that you can cook❤ anything is possible. I feel like you can if you keep practicing. I’m going to check the second video 🎉 God bless you in Jesus name, He loves you. And congratulations ! ❤️ you have a British accent, is this house in the U.K. ? If so what county? Also, do you plan on having a pool?
I’m not a follower and just come across this but huge well done and what a beautiful home! I’m inspired by the nature wall and the light wood with white colours. Thanks for showing us
At first I thought “this must be Travis barkers daughter or something” because look at that house! Then I realized it wasn’t and now I feel stupid.
Good for her. I remember when she started posting on Youtube.
Too privileged
this just made me feel like shit haha
so she'll upload number two if you all do as she asks, to get her precious 50k likes(yawn) so while you give her this lifestyle, she rubs your noses in what you havent got. All these people do is emersed in getting money and you feel special because she's boasting about what she has got? i take it she realises you dont have it so its a way to get your likes. Reality check brown nosers! influencers love one thing, themselves.
i dont like it. ridiculous and bizaree. you dont need this. dont be grateful cos its SO horrible
You should have a double shoot with an elevator so you can send it upp too😅
YES SAFFRON ❤
This is nice and all but it’s very out of touch
You should put shelves in the kitchen on the walls near each side the stove. It would add more wood to the kitchen and give it an open cabinet type of vibe.
Great video Saffron! What a beautiful home you've got. I just wish I could have a massive amount of money so I could afford luxury homes like this.
The outside looked great, but inside is very hospital looking, I guess she just moved in so a lot of furnishings and just personal touches are missing.
Beautiful home, congratulations
Love your house!  I would move the sofa to where you have your dining table. To me it makes more sense to have the dining table near the kitchen. It will also help you avoid the “waiting room” vibe you are mentioning. 😘
This is the house i want 🥳🥳🥳🥳😊
Love this Saff amazing thank you truly amazing breathtaking ❤️🇬🇧 are you all ready for xmas and done xmas shopping 🇬🇧
This is really screaming tone deaf
My neck hurts already with the living room TV - should definitely lower it.
FYI the company you bought your sofas from is pronounced ‘Nah-van’ sofa company! It’s named after the town in which it’s located in Ireland. :)
Money can't buy taste!
Is she still with that guy ?
Just me watching, still living in my childhood bedroom at my parents at 28
Lusso is the best brand to go for. really high quality stuff
i’m making a fucking youtube vid 😂who wants to see my makeup collection 😂
I would never leave my house
What she actually means is that she had the house built. She couldn't do a day's work with those nails!
These reactions are ridiculous. People really need to read that message to feel ok? You and they need to work on yourselves. People will do better than others and you don’t need to feel down or worthless for not having the same. It’s life and it will continue to do on.
I’d be so scared with no blinds in the kitchen and living room
The house is breathtaking but I can’t be the only one who thinks it doesn’t feel homely/cosy?
This home is perfect for you - love love love ❤️❤️❤️
Please tell me the cabinet handles where are they from ? Xxx
I thought you where morgen so I clicked super fast
Wow, i am speechless 😮
Luca is fuming right now
Can’t wait for Morgan to have one of these videos! 😅
does anyone else feel like the kitchen sink is too small? i guess she's probably never gna clean up tho so she'll be right with one small sink
from your lives on younow to now so proud!!!!! congrats girlie
Omfg this is beautiful 😭 not me being jealous cuz I cannot even afford a normal house 😺🤩
I’m dying at the “I don’t cook but it looks nice” about the oven what the fuck is in all the cupboards
Gorgeous house ❤❤ only change I’d make is put your lounge where your dining table is and dining table where your sofa is - love interior design - check out Kelly Hoppen  You’re amazing - well done xx
Really not jealous or anything, it is beautifuly build house, but I just don’t get what people have about these huge catalogue houses. I can’t imagine to live there 🤷‍♀️
Wow! Beautiful renovation!  Subscribed..!!!
Gorgeous ❤
Saffron, what a house of dreams 😍😍😍 you should be SO proud of yourself!
It will always be crazy to me how much influencers make😭 no actual talent and multi millionaires
She doesn’t appreciate the love and support she hardly reply to the comments. There nothing about her most boring person ever.😊
Why do young influencers rush to do things like this , the house of beautiful but damn is it going to be lonely this type of house is for a family of 4 😂
Good
Good
Nice
the amount influencers earn is just hard to watch
I have always said when I have my forever home I’m getting a tango blast ice machine… obsessed
That’s beautiful everything about it amazing you must be proud of yourself ❤
ى
Well all made this happen
I assume the people on here saying she works hard don’t have actual jobs or responsibilities? They’re 15 right? Or younger? Nurses work hard. Give it a few years and see if you still find this kind of wealth and flagrant showing off appealing.
It's so cool house i love it 💗💗💗
Why isn't there any blinds it seems very exposed. And It will effect the temp inside depending on the temperature outside
Looks great. Very impressive makeover to this home :)
Is this a Howdens kitchen? ❤thanks looks fabulous
Beautiful house, quite jealous 😭😭 but is the fireplace below the TV inducing anxiety in anybody else?😬🤣
You’ve got a beautiful home Saff! 💗
I love the willow tree in your garden. So beautiful
mad!
Love it. Only thing I'm not keen on is the TV fireplace setup
It's so motivating, so beautiful to see someone of my age, of my generation doing such a great thing! The house is absolutely sublime, magnificent wow 😲😲🔥🔥🔥
Your house is an absolute dream Saffron I love it the interior decor is stunning top tier 10/10❤ you deserve this house and it looks like the wait has been worth it so much love and hard work has gone into it and you can tell.
People may see this is the current time of struggling with money and chosing between food or heating. In this current time, remember you’re doing better than you think. Don’t but unrealistic expectations on yourself. Only one in a many many people have this opportunity. Keep going x
stunning😍😍😍
I can't imagine cleaning this house🥴
Wow beautiful house😍
This is an amazing achievement and so inspiring
I mean I’m happy for you… I’m glad you’re getting to life your best life but seems a bit of a show off when everyone else is struggling for money rn 😢
Even the whole world and the things in it cannot fill the void in human heart.
AMAZING! So so happy and proud to see you succeed Saff. You have built and spent a lot of money on a practical, safe and beautiful home! If I was your friend I would be super lucky and proud to know you. Keep shining and cannot wait to see more of your successes! Congratulations on your beautiful home!🥂🍾🏡Xxx
Why is this stuck up BITCH boasting about her house and how much money she has she ain't special and worth anything her whole family are stuck up like "Oh look at me look how much money I get from doing absolutely nothing Saffron should try getting a real and normal job like everyone else then maybe she'll realise that she won't get special treatment, won't get everything handed to her on a plate and realise that in life everyone has to earn their money by working normal 9 to 5 jobs and not earn their money by sitting in front of a camera telling people who may not have much money how much money you have and how "RICH" you are, your no one special Saffron your not a celebrity so don't make out like you are and that you have this perfect and amazing life
AmAzing house 😮 X
Given the cost of living and that people are struggling.....this video is just bad taste. The house is so ostentatious.
Saffron worked hard af she deserves this
the security features👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Sparkling water gap who’s your guest Andrew Tate?
Come on of me in Italy!
Saffron barker you are beautiful woman and you have beautiful house!
As a interior designer, I LOVE THIS!!
I can’t think of a single person who deserves this less she deadass cried cause she was home late because someone topped themself🥴
You deserve it ❤
This is crazy!!! 22 years old and you've created such a beautiful home  - ngl I got excited by the laundry shoot and my sister would be in heaven with the Tango ice blast machine. That cinema is epic!!
It looks beautiful! Who did you say made your sofa please?
Eat the rich
Who in their right mind ‘loves’ videos of talentless half-wits who haven’t earned a single penny of what they are showing off, and who are rubbing your noses in to further boost their own self obsessed egos.
Help homeless people
I LOVE this, however I'd switch the dining room and couch/tv area around. I feel like the space would be better utilized for more seating and flow better into having something really cool where the dining table is now. And the shape of the table would match the kitchen area better too, I think. Amazing work on the house, so cool to see what it came from to where it is now. Congrats on everything! ❤
Switch your sofa and your dining table , uses the space better. Make a reading book in the corner the dining tables in now, then it’s not too many chairs in one space but it’ll flow well
I would consider flipping your lounge and dining so your living room is in the larger space, it means you’ll have more seatinh in your living room! It will also avoid the waiting room vibe you’ll get with the dining in the entry! Advice coming from an Architect in Australia ☺️☺️
Wow😍
idk saff read the room(or one of 30 of yours) we are in a cost of living crisis and people are struggling to eat. congrats on your home it’s beautiful and you have worked hard. it’s just sad that you feel the need to show it off and brag
Your house is stunning! It’s giving me inspiration for when I have my own house!
I would move the dining table to where the lounge is and have the lounge on the other side with more seating. That way everyone can spread out while eating and then lots more seating on the other side that won’t feel like a waiting room
never clicked on a video so fast
Dream house 😍 absolutely stunning!
I was watching you when you were still dating..Jake? Forgot his name..and now you are here..insane
Are you putting in a pool?
Ur house is beautiful ❤️
What do you watch on the cinema room?
I love the house! Taking some inspiration now that I can soon have my own place 🥰 will we see your bedroom too?
Wow you’re house is beautiful ❤️‍🔥🎉
I was thinking this comment section would be full of people congratulating her but seems pretty opposite lol. She earned her money
i feel like this costed $1m
Amazinggggg! Im impressed
Well done you…..your home is shaping up very nicely Saffron. Congratulations it’s a fabulous achievement ❤️❤️. Can’t wait to see the Xmas decorations up xx
Hard work pays off!! Well done Saffron! Wish you every happiness in your new home.
Your house looks naff
good video
This is unreal so happy for you ❤

omg finally
Tjekkede detaljer,men indretningen oser af dårlig britisk smag
Wow  beautiful  house.  You did   a wonderful  job with the  house.  You are so beautiful.  You inspired me to keep making VIDEOS on my CHANNEL and to not give up making VIDEOS on my CHANNEL.   You are so beautiful with makeup on and without makeup on.   Your VIDEOS  are  always entertaining to watch.   I love  opening  plain in a house.   So incredible  the house.  Love your  decorations. Are you going  decorate your house for Christmas ? 😮🎄😘❤ sending lots of love from nz
Sheesh if I had this much money I'd build my dream home for my and my boyfriend. How on earth do you have so much flippen money!!!  South Africa 🇿🇦 hey...
The constant talking with her hands, i had to switch off.
Wow 🥰😍 the fact you’ve changed it so much from what it was to where it is now INCRED! & you’re SO young at 22 most people are still out partying I certainly was and not on the house ladder 😂 Well done girl smashed it 🤛🏼
GET OUT OF TOWN! Saff this is freaking stunning!! You have such a good taste. Congratulations
If you can afford it then I dont see a problem. There's lots of little luxuries that you can have in your home that may not be as expensive. You can make the laundry shoot, you can have a cinema room with a cheaper take on it, loads of people have projectors in their home now, small ones are not expensive
You did AMZING you should get a jacuzzi for your garden!
Jesus not even actual celebrities have houses this expensive or teched out
So proud of you. Wow dream house! You deserve the world and more ❤️
sorry no hate but y would 1 person like her need a massive house like this y do u need 3 bathrooms wen u live on ur own also this prove youtubers get paid way too much for the amount they do wen the nhs do so much more for us and get paid no where near as much as some of the youtubers like her. i no she not doing this video to show off or bragg or to make people jelous but i don't think youtubers deserve to get paid the rediclous amount they do for what they do thats just my personal opinion plus y have a massive house like this wen u hardly ever there u alway broadcasting on socails and other utube videos that u in london a lot of the times and go on so many hoildays a year wen do u find the time to actually life in a big house like this wen u broadcast ur away more than u actally home lol
I think the whole design over functionality (“my builder hates me having my toaster out”) is crazy. The home is to be lived in not to be a display house. It looks amazing its lovely but you have to live there so do what works for you.
omg such a good vid ❤
This is incredible, so proud of you. Such an inspiration to young women everywhere to the fact you achieved this alone and in your early 20s!
The house is incredible! Those couch cushions though ruin the whole look!
She better of paid the builder a lot of money if not he should rip it all back down lol. Pretentious “influencers”🤣
Absolutely beautiful home, health to enjoy 😊
This house is stunning 😍
That builder is incredible
Saff your house is stunning! Also your security is amazing. Everyone deserves to feel safe in their own home 🥰
Unbelievable. Well invested money, what an awesome achievement. Congratulations it’s stunning. ❤
Amazing home love it, congratulations
gorgeous house well done and congrtulations🎉 i still remember u from angles of the north the program it was class keep achieving ur dreams i wish to meet u one day 🤍
Dreams
Where are you trousers from also please?❤️ you look great.
Congrats saffron, wow, I’m 1 day younger than you exactly and watched you from early days, and this is just amazing, congrats, what an achievement 🫶🏽 manifesting
Best house I’ve ever seen 😭❤️
What's her onlyfans,?
OMG That Laundry chute is life! Our house has three floors so it's got to remain a dream for me 😩
From what I see of your ads you for for floor free your nature wall free your sofa free plus prob everything. What I don’t understand is people have the money to buy why givethem free
I would swap the dining table and the living room i put the dining table where the couch is and put the couch where the dining table is it would look sick other then that this house is beautiful such a big achievement congratulations saffron ❤️❤️
Wow I watched you for years. From you in your bedroom at the beginning to this! 😮. Unreal beautiful home for sure xx
You've earned it and worked so hard it looks amazing saff 🥰
American  style house in London. I like it.
Everyone like saffron video
NOOOOO I cannot believe it’s been split into two!!!!🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 such a beautiful home!!!
DREAM HOUSE ❤
😍😍😍😍😍
Which camera are u using
This video is gross
Saff love your house obvz was a given however I want to know WHERE are them trousers from. In love 😍 x
WOW in love with your house. Congrats you've done so well for yourself at such a young age, you should be very proud!
Wow , so proud of her
Get a white & gold toaster girl!! Would look gorg
Not a fan of the layout downstairs, so much wasted space and the lounge looks so un cosy. The whole theme has basically copied Molly mae 😅
I’ve watched saffron for years and she’s done incredibly well for herself, however with the current cost of living crisis, some families choosing between heating their homes in the winter or putting food on the table, I find this video is incredibly distasteful and feel it shouldn’t have be posted at this time. Should’ve waited until after Christmas to post in my opinion. She’s an incredibly influential person with children and young people watching her videos which could* not for definite but could send people with poor mental health into a spiral of feeling not good enough ect ect. Just my opinion. I like saffron as a person and will continue to watch her videos but I feel this video should’ve not been posted at this time. Just my opinion. Not hating on her as a person or the video, it’s the timing of the video that bothers me (with the cost of living crisis and it being in winter when people are financially struggling)
I wish I lived here!
Beautiful house!
The house are insane!! 🥰☺️its such a dream house. Congratulations ❤️i love your new house.
This house is absolutely stunning!🤩
Great Video... looking forward to part 2 :)
Is the house semi detached as the pic of the old house shows this?
Love
Wasn’t molly mae gifted the same sofa? I feel a lot of your items are gifted so you just paid for the builders if not discounted heavily
Well done ❤❤❤
30 secs in and Saff says bits and bobs twice 😂 I love her so much ❤
Your home is literally a dream, wow, so beautiful, congratulations ❤️
You haven't built a thing you might've paid for it there's a big difference
Looks like a range cooker to me not an aga
Wow! What an amazing home you have got.  I absolutely love it, bloody fantastic...well jel lol
The couch stool is called an ottoman
As someone who always grew up with housing issues and still do till this day. Me and my dad have always lived in tiny overcrowded, 1 bed flats with things everywhere. I’m almost 20 and this is such an inspiration that things will get better and I’m so so proud of you Saff. Please guys never take for granted your home💗
Nice house, not what I want to see when there is a cost of living crisis happening.
you’re welcome ☺️
The kitchen is beautiful but very very boring.
The most beautiful boujee house ever!! 😍
Followed saffron since she began her YouTube journey and honestly she is so incredibly deserving of this. She has worked so hard over the years and completely powered through everything and AHHH. Any sour comments just really don’t realise how much time and effort went into this. Super proud of Saff, and it’s a wonderful reminder that incredible things CAN happen with persistent hard work and dreams🙏🏻
Why would you spend the money for an oven like that and not cook
I guess cooking is beneath her
With all the money you can get a massive house
Iv been watching you for 5 years now and I never outgrow you because I have grown with you. You really have worked hard you deserve this girl! X
luv ur videos
Drinking game  Everytime she says "actually" have a shot
Internally grateful 😂
So proud
Woowwwwww what a dream house
Why did you put the lounge in the kitchen, instead of the dining room in the kitchen area as well ?
That influencer money... Scary that doctors can't even afford this, what a world
You should have kept the secret doors a secret for security purposes saff. But your house is truly beautiful x
I have been waiting for this for the longest time!!! You 1000% deserve this, you have been working so hard; constantly grinding and at a young age, you proved to everyone that you can anything as long as you put your mind to it.  Welldone!!!
It’s a beautiful house saffron’s got good taste ❤
Your house is beautiful 😍 ❤
Why tell people your secret doors 😭 god forbid if something happens the movie room would’ve been a good hide spot. She could’ve shown the room without showing where to enter.. secret door is no longer a secret lol
Hey Saff, so proud of you and I love your hosuse! One suggestion I have is to swap the couch for the dining table. Then u have a kitchen dining room and will mean ur dining table will be used more, and also ur living room will take up that whole room and make use of that space.
Saffron your house is beautiful
WOW, what a dream! Enjoy🥰
i’m studying interior design and this just inspired me to keep going.. i love all the different materials you used and the aesthetic is amazing!! the hidden rooms adds so much to the space i cannot wait for the upstairs!
Love everything you showed us in your home. Sparkling water on tap yes please and a laundry shoot. ♥️👍
Okay so if you are worried about it looking like a drs waiting area instead of more chairs how about a fluffy rug with a GIANT bean bag to throw yourself on after a long day!
Absolutely stunning!! Seriously you did such a fantastic job congrats to you that has to be such an amazing feeling !! ❤ can’t wait to see the upstairs hehe
So far so beautiful 🥺
i cant cook either hhahah, i love the tap idea, how much was the tango machine lol x   I think id fall on them stairs lol
Looks gorgeous! If I were you, I’d swap the dining table and chairs over to where your sofa is next to the kitchen and then sofa on the other side of the fireplace. Just a thought 😊
This is one of the nicest homes I have EVER seen wow
so cool showing us how the house was before! who took this video ! well done, out door bar yes, where r ur trousers from?
Loved this video and i like you’re house, But i would do the dining table in the kitchen and make where the kitchen table is the livingroom and you can make it very cosy, And maybe put that chair what is the same as the sofa in there for an extra sitting chair😉 And put a nice rug down only missing plants or some kind of color😊 But it looks amazing, And what a great idea for a panicbutton throughout you’re house cause you life on you’re own😊And when are the window blinds coming or curtains?😊 But the house suits you perfect😊
we will need an xmas dec video! love the tv with fire under it ! molly mae has same x
love the house- you dont know how lucky you are! stay and enjoy it!
is the thumbnail pic ur house?  when i tell you i RAN to this video
Wowwww your house is beaut, we’ll deserved X
I can not wait to see part two, you house really is a dream
Wow this house is incredible, congrats!
This video made me so emotional,your house is unreal ❤️😭Ihave been watching you since the very start of your YouTube videos🤍you should so proud of yourself Saff❤
I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS HOUSE!! Every bit of detail that’s gone into it is amazing 😍 can’t wait to see part 2
Love the natural wood look. Very calm & eco. Your kitchen is tastefully done. Love how you’ve kept it classic white & the pretend cupboard to the utility room is great.
I’m obsessed!! Congratulations on your beautiful home ❤❤
Literally Goals ❤
such a beautiful home
You should be so proud of yourself!  It looks amazing, I’d love to have a cinema😂
Really stunning property, however doesn’t give any homely vibes. It’s more of a modern show home without a warm, homely atmosphere
Sorry but I’m from navan and it’s pronounced Nah-vin
Omg that house is stunning 🤩 I would like to one day be able to do the same 😊 well done saff ❤
My absolute dream house. You have immaculate taste
Love the house honestly stunning wish I lived there but the armchair with the arch mirror 😍 I'm in love with that corner And you look glowing Saf be proud of yourself!! ❤️
LOOOOOOOOVE IT
I think alot of the house decorating was gifted by companies and her family are also well off must have helped her   Alor of her vlogs have these items saying AD on them. All just as she has alot of subs so it’s free advertising for them. Shows that school meant nothing in a way
Saff, I’m so incredibly proud of you! You are such a hard worker with the most pure of heart , you deserve all this and more girlie ❤❤
Incredible 🎉 but I cant get over the miss pronunciation of navan 🤣
Hi Saffron, amazing home! I love your wooden flooring downstairs, can I ask where you got it from please? I've recently bought a house and I am trying to find the perfect flooring :)
Looks unreal I would love to have a house like that dream house ❤x
Hi , Iam so happy for u /need support from u guys please
omg i love the laundry shoot and the secret doors
Wow
Well done! SUCH an inspiring home💕
Thanks for the useless Unskipable ads YouTube honestly thank you so much for wasting my time youtube these ads need binned
Your house is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! It’s such a dream 😍 Every details is just stunning 🤩 Been waiting for this vlog for soooo long and finally it’s uploaded 😍 Can’t wait to watch the part 2 🥰 you’re a Goal Saff 💕💕
Ohhh my goodness this is my dream home 😍😍
are the doors shaded? where you can see outside still but outside cannot see inside because its dark.
What a dream 😍
Congratulations,your house is beautiful x
I’m not hating. Saffron seems a lovely girl and clearly works so hard. She has been so lucky to have everything exactly how she wants. But I personally found this so hard to watch. A slushie machine during a cost of living crisis is hard to digest. My parents have divorced and neither me, nor my parents, nor my brother have homes at the moment. Like I said, I am pleased for her but some are asking just for a roof while others are able to be concerned with such lavish interior design.
So proud of you girl , grown up watching you , wish I was at this stage in my life ❤️ good on you for making your dreams come true xxxx
Congratulations! What a beautiful home
She deserves to be happy
Just amazing and so minimalistic, my apartment is basically the same https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a7PwMv6lm9U&t=1s ❤
This is so well thought out
MY fav vidéos
One of the most gorgeous homes. Great taste ❤

Saffron, this is INSANE! such an incredible achievement and even more incredible to have done it at your age. Such a dreamy home✨
I am so glad you mentioned the security measures there as showing a full tour of home can be so dangerous nowadays! But what a dream home😍
it’s pronounced naa-van sofa company!! Just for future reference 😂 house looks amazing well done ❤
Saffron, your home is beautiful! ✨
Well this is unreal 😍
I would accidentally kilo myself falling down those stairs when drunk
You should put the dining table back in the middle and make the other space a little bar area
Wow lovely house looks incredible your builder done a first class job have you got underfloor heating on the ground floor?
It looks amazing!! I can’t wait to see the rest. Congratulations! ❤

This is no joke my favorite home I've ever seen 😍
Just had to comment that it’s pronounced nah-van not nayvan 😅
wow im jealous
your house looks amazing 😍😍
Omg your home looks insane! 😍 sorry to be that person.. but what if you put the dining table where your couch is then make the other side of the TVs the lounge? 😆 sorry. It looks amazing the way it is obvs. But it would fill out that space perfectly without you worrying about it looking like a doctors office 🤣
Amazing 😍 well done saffron your house is literally a dream x
You look amazing Saff!

Is Saffron rich? How did she afford to build it? Really happy for you Saffron!!
When you need two separate videos to show your complete house shows you’ve made it 🎉 congrats on your beautiful home 🏡 ❤
