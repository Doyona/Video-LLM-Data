Shoots a basketball  He should be in baseball
Average game of long toss be like
Kicks a football   That kid is a natural he NEEDs to be in track
* Bounces a bouncey ball* “he needs to be in the nba*
Better than Patrick Mahomes
God loves you❤✝️🙏
Repent for your sins and accept salvation from Jesus ❤❤❤❤
A base ball
What he throw
Which one
Legend says he got Tommy John surgery the next day
As someone who plays first, his accuracy is more impressive. My biggest  pet peeve has always been the teammates who think that just because they can throw far and fast, accuracy doesn't matter. Brings back memories of varsity, I thought I was going to lose my mind with our short stop.  Fyi, even throwing a softball is a lot different than a badeball. A football, not even close.
Bro got that Aaron Rodgers strength
Bro i bet Tom Brady can't even do that 😮‍💨
DAMNNNNNN
They both need to be in the nfl
No one gonna talk about the guy who caught it
As a softball player I am truly amazed 😮
hey can you throw a grenade?                       : yeah not that far thought : ok let’s see
Both of them do
For anyone who is wondering I believe this is Trevor Bouer
Throw harder u didn’t reach the moon yet💀
He needs to be a outfielder
Bruh ain’t now way he said that 😂
Its nerf or nothing
Most college baseball players can throw it that distance
IMAGINE IF THAT BALL HIT THAT OTHER DUDE,HE'D BE HALF DEAD
Throws a baseball means he’ll be a good basketball player right??
Which one
It’s a baseball or football….?
Tommy John
it was a baseball…
I feel like javelin is a better fit
clean ass catch too
Bro really throwing it like a sky made from Apex 😂
He needs to play baseball
No.
Who else noticed that the goalposts are backwards
DAMN😳
I bet he's using the prime ball
Which one the one who caught bit or the one who threw it?
Why the nfl? He should be in hockey!
Sir, that’s not a football
The passer or the catcher
He needs to be in the NFL  Someone doesn’t know shit about football
He can throw crazy far but his accuracy probably isn't that good
Holy crap
“He needs to be in the NFL”  baseball player
How many yards is that
"Pitches baseball" "He needs to be in the NBA"
BRO HAS A CANNON FOR AN ARM
Umm that was a baseball
It's a baseball tho...
Hell I was thought it was a football 😂
Hell no he can't,I can throw whatever he threw that far and can only throw a football about 60 yards
Nerf toys makes you cool 😂😂
And the runner is safe
a baseballs like 5 oz
I can do that with baseball lol
They BOTH need to be in  NFL
There were like 3 kids on my HS team who could do this. The one kid could throw it to the back of the end zone. None of them were good at football.
Throws a jellybean…he needs to be a dad.
Which one?
These comments od🤣🤣🤣🤣
Just don't put him on the Kansas city chiefs because the o line won't give him enough time for the QB to wind up or a reciever to get that far down field
Do u not mean they need to be in the nfl
Nice cover up . This will be exposed
which one
DAMN
Which one 😂
Me:Throws basketball random guy from behind: *HE NEEDS TO BE IN REAL MADRID*
Why nobody talking about the catcher🤨
Fake
What was that a football?
Sheesh both of them legends
Ain’t no way
Which of them?
MLB lol.
nfl uses baseballs then yeah he would be a good thrower
*FAKE*  😳😳 right EDITED VIDEO
Looks like a BASEBALL
Yo l don't even think Tom Brady could do that
Bro the catch though😫😫😩😩
Not with accuracy.  Put him in the outfield.
FOR REAL HE DOES NEED TO BE ON THE NFL  😧😱😳  !     COMPLETELY IMPRESSIVE   !
Ik that kid is a really good catcher he should be in the NFL
Hahahaha. I guess everyone who can throw a baseball should ne in the NFL
Noice

It’s NHL when you don’t use your F

Him: throw a ball 🏀 over 20 yards  Crowd proceeds to give the most fake underwhelming woo
It's a baseball!!
Which 1?
Nice baseball
**kicks a tennis ball** “Omg! He needs to be in the MLB!”
I could throw this far but it hurts like hell. Like my arm will rip off and fly with the ball.
We are not impressed. He rainbowed that shit
Yeah every quarterback gets to run 10 yards and throw a baseball. Lol
Guys I think he’s talking a lot about accuracy. The pass was very accurate
HOLD ON the guy who catched it the guy who threw it or both
Hits a tennis ball:  Video: he needs to go to mars
Not in a million  years....
Is that uncle Rico?
Yes he do
Which one
Needs to be? Stop being ignorant
That is a football tho-
Not sure whats more impressive the distance or one handed catch
“Hits a tennis ball” “he would be an amAzing baseball player”
The spectators sound like the mii's from wii sports💀
*shoots a basketball* "He needs to be in NASCAR*
The guy catching the baseball needs to be in MLB
Uh... no he doesn't - throwing doesn't mean he can play! Just say, "good throw" and move on. #Simple
You mean MLB?
I can’t even do that with a tennis ball
Send this fool to ukraine
Idk weather to be impressed by the guy who threw it pr the guy who caught it from that far
My son can do that with a baseball and he's 10
Nope not with a football
He could throw grenades for Ukraine 🇺🇦
Is that not a football?
He probably cant do this with a football a baseball or what ever that is ,is way lighter and more areodynamic so its meant to fly further.
He’s good at arm wrestling he should be in the UFC
I was throwing BB that far when I was 11
Which one
That’s a ball not a football know the difference
Every minor league centerfielder can do this…
Lol clowns
Run 🏃‍♂️ receiver Run farther
Wtf is this
He needs to be in a upcoming spongebob movie
Gets a kill in fornite..man he should be a sniper
That's inhuman
Which one
Yk what- he probably could throw a football very far but to be in the NFL you need a lot of feats escpescially for a qb and I don’t wanna point the obvious but that’s not even a football💀
Is his hand ok
Naw he in the right sport... he got a arm...#center/left fielder....much love..
I could throw a baseball taht far and ive had 2 shoulder surgeries
**squashes a fly with a pingpong paddle** Thanos, is that you?
Damn that shoulder must hurt 🔥
That's not a baseball. Too big
Wtf pol
He doesn’t need to be in the nfl
Its called baseball
It’s a baseball
Yo he activated aim bot
That’s not a football it’s a baseball.  Dumb
No
No he needs to be in the mlb
By the time we release Lamar Jackson, this guy probably ready lol
Which one
The fact it’s a baseball ⚾️
https://youtu.be/zeH2wY1nA20
No. But he would come close
I think he needs to be an outfielder not in the NFL
you mean the mlb
That was actually Tom Brady’s deflated ball he threw there.
How
If he used a football it would be half or less than what he just threw
Damn bro is that my dad finally coming back with milk.That milk is pretty far,Walmart is only like 2 minutes away
I remember this me and my friend Ricky used to do this back through Middle School all the way through high school we used to be in the front yard throwing the baseball to each other but we used to be far apart gunning the ball and we used to have crowds around us watching
An arm dont mean your a QB
Hell nahh he can’t do that with a football I play baseball I’m a pitcher I throw 90 MPH and I can probably throw it one fiald and half with a football I can probably do like 60 yards 😳
Mlb would of been better to out. And that's still! A HELL OF A TGRIW
He may have to throw the ball like that long distance but how accurate is he on a short pass does it matter if you can throw it long as long as you're accurate that's what counts
As a baseball player I can say with confidence, no, he could not. It’s a completely different motion and different physics on the ball. While yes, that throw was EXTREMELY impressive, he could not do that with a football.
Hits a Home Run ⚾️  He needs to be in the NBA🏀
No he needs to play center field for Detroit or Houston
Daw u don’t see the alien flying across 👀
E..z
Na, he needs to be an outfielder in the mlb
Can we get a photographer that can keep their eyes on the ball?  Go trick your girlfriend.🤨🧐😏
That's a star badminton player right there
My mind is blowwwnnn
Stop it
He needs to throw javelin
Or maybe, just hear me out , in major league baseball.
Yes nice toss but not for NFL too much hang time mosdeff 50 50 who catches it maybe even the official
Both do
That was a good pass
Master Chief tags elite with sticky grenade
Dang
If I do this will my dad come back?
They both need to be in the nfl
Baseball ⚾️
No
Let’s see it with a football
That's not remotely comparable to a football or impressive.
I’ll sign him
Yes he can Tom Brady inflated the ball.
👎 no
Is he an Arabic?
That’s a baseball
wow so cool
That one guy at the start of every game in call of duty😅
Fake
Everyone: how did he throw that?!?! Me: how did he catch that??
prolly not. a football is way bigger and heavier than a baseball.
Bro threw that 120 yards
He needs to be in the nfl u mean they
Thats more than 110 yrds
That was a fucking baseball
Está editado..!
Bull shit
No he cannot, and no, he doesn’t!
This isn’t really that impressive actually kind of average for someone who plays baseball it’s be a different story if there was no arch
No offense but you get a high school qb who can throw 40+ yards with a football is easily doing this
Okay. Now DO IT WITH A FOOTBALL, with DLinemen and LBs chasing your ass.
Once upon a time before my shoulder started hurting all day every day.
It’s a baseball not a football 😤
Both of them do
*hits a ping pong ball* "This man belongs in cricket"
Way back in the stone ages the NFL had something called QB challenges. The QBs would line up and take running starts to throw a ball as far as they could in a straight line. The furthest I ever saw was 73 yards.
Imagine his arm breaks
MLB*
Throws a long distance baseball. "He should be a porn star".
i’m pretty sure Jackie Robinson could throw like 450 ft with a baseball
I think they said nfl cuz he got a good catch or throw
Holy shit
"Delaware smash!"
Imagine If that guy socked you
A full size NFL football.. it’s much easier to lob small objects over wider and larger because you can grip smaller objects better.  Maybe he could but I doubt it
Dam fella what's your cash all you deserve  to get paid for that
That’s an easy throw lol
Shiiiddd me gd
Imagine the guy said that's not even full force lol
It’s a baseball??
Which one?
Not throwing a baseball lol
To funny
Lmao. 300 feet with a baseball? That was me and the boys dickin around in highschool😂 imagine a QB gets a technique and throws a baseball👀🥶
Holy crap
No cap
Good ol right hand 😅
The middle child is trowing the ball  The yougest child cathcing Parents: little Billy is going to be in the NFL The middle child: .....
No
No he is where he should be
Needs to be in the NHL, makes half court shot.
That’s a baseball
Straight cap🧢
OMFG that's over 110 yards in the air.
Ft Hayes...Cheeky Rodriquez...grounds personnel...cut from Baltimore....father was an air force enlisted....kid was used in radiation experiments resulting in oversized/muscular arm condition.
You spelled MLB wrong
Damn baseball. I can do that shit with a baseball.
No lmfao
😳😳😳😳😳
No way...
Maybe baseball. Not the NFL
Ok but the dude caught it with ONE hand??! Are we ignoring this???
Bro that's not a football
Kicks a football  HE needs to be in the NBA
bro needs to be in ukraine throwin gernades
Lol 🤣 he should've done it with a football..
U mean mlb buddy
wrong sport 💀🤦‍♂️
Lol you don't throw a football the same way as a baseball.
Your ability to throw a ball beyond 100 yds doesn’t matter. The field is only 100 yds long. Your ability to keep cool under pressure and deliver accurate passes to some of the fastest runners alive and hit them without making them break stride matters. Oh, did I mention that all the while three 350lb gorillas (D line), two to four of the most violent and sadistic people in sports (line backers/edge rushers) will try to hit you so hard that your soul temporarily leaves your body.
No
Idc what ball he's throwing...kids got an arm
Damn yall take it easy good grief maybe he can throw a foot ball pretty well to ?
I could do this in high school and could maybe still do.it but Throwing a baseball isn't nearly.as hard as Throwing a football
Had to go buy a new arm after that one…
Should he join the NFL cause he can throw a baseball 100 yards? 😂😂😂  bruh y’all funny af 💀
I do this with a football and im 13 :)
In baseball throwing airmail like this isn’t impressive. Throw that far on a line and I’ll say that’s impressive lol
Nice catch
So...its not a football..
It is not a football, therefore he needs to be in the MLB. Lmao. Not the NFL genius
needs to be in mlb
Holly molly!!
Both
No. Next question.
I Can literally throw a NFL Football for 70-75 Yards No Cap but nothing more than that I Want a Cookie and Recognition for my Talents 😂😂😂😂
😳😳😳
Which one? 😭
Doubt it
It’s different
THAT'S NOT A FOOTBALL THOUGH!! THAT'S A BASEBALL!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA
Now try it with shoulder guards lol
*throws Frisbee* "That kid should be in the UFC"
Witch one
Oh, that wasn’t a football? 🤣 I thought he was throwing a football before I read the title
He wouldn’t be able to but he definitely could throw it far
That's a f'n baseball
Hits a golf ball, he needs to be a boxer
No baseball and football have different throw and grip so he might do half of that throw prob
Not a football I’m guessing
No they both do
Dude gonna be retired
Which one
Hell no! Of anyone could they would be the first player to get drifted out of high school pick 1
Damn
Both of them, the pass and the catch pretty solid
*kicks golf ball* “He’d be a damn good tennis player”
115 yds. Nice
Why not MLB? 🤔
🤫 I DO THAT SHIIIIIII DAILY... GOOD ON YA MATE.. KEEP IT UP..💫🦾🦾🦾🦾👁
Which one. Guy who bombed it or the guy who disrespects him buy catching it one handed no problem
This must be Napoleon Dynamite's uncle
He threw that 100 feet in the air lmao needs to straighten it out.. it’s a baseball .. this is easy
When I was younger this is what we called a "long toss", Im not knocking the guys throwing, just saying this is more common than one may think.
“How much you wanna bet I can throw a football over those mountains?” -Uncle Rico.
We don't even know if this is a real official football
They
Fake AF
I don’t know what was better the catch or the throw
He won't make it to the nfl. No way! He'll throw his arm out and tear his rotator cuff up before that happens.
How…
No
“He needs” no they need
No footballs are much heavier
So what would the equation be if the size, weight difference was taken into consideration to determine what the distance would don't forget to include the variables (wind)
He should be a Nascar driver!  *Swims 3 laps in the pool*
You mean an outfielder in the MLB? Lol
Its different with a football 😐
Keep doing that strengthen arm real good. I did this growing up in bx as a kid got into baseball and in high-school was hitting 94 on gun in Westchester college
Seeing as how i can throw a baseball 75% that distance without anything but little league experience id say, no no he cant do that with a football it doesnt just translate lol
wat the f
Baseballs are 10 times easier to throw tho...
Both of them do like jeez
I think an outfielder in the MLB would suit him better.
Dont care if that was a soccer ball that boy has Arm Strength
You mean both of them to be in the nfl
Launches a frisbee*   “He needs to be in the WNBA”
Techmo Bowl Cheat Activated
No, he needs to be in the mlb.
No
They both do, cus how did he catch that😂
Is that uncle Rico?
there is a diffrence
Baseball and football...different.
Yeetus baseballus
Witch one ???
the right association is mlb, lol
That’s a baseball
This is what they mean when they say long toss
“Be honest who else is just scrolling through shorts rn? 😂”
They both do
Throwing a baseball that far isn’t hard lmao
He launched that one
We all know the largest human beings in the world are good at football.  Argument for NFL is invalid
its a baseball not that hard lol
We not gonna talk about the catch
There is nothing impressive about this! I played with players that long toss this!!! No the difference is about 8 ounces so he can throw a footballs about half that if he gives it his best
Legend has it this is Tom brady 😂😂😂
Stick to Centerfield
NFL ....? With that talent .... NHL is where he belongs !
Baseball you mean
Play  catcher no one stealing on this kid
Good money in a newspaper route for this young man
Football and baseball are totally different my guy 😂
that would be impressive if half the baseball players ik couldn’t do it without the arch
No, maybe a starter in high school baseball....maybe
The two goats?
Ummm. NO
Seems like a baseball to me
Not even close
He be dead beforr the first down lol
Sign him up
They both do
Impressive but that is a lacrosse stick he is using
Verrrrrrry different doing that with a football he would not be able to sure the kids got a hell of a arm but they’d a different thing entirely with a football
Don’t even ask that question, I can throw a baseball a 100yards lol!!!
My guess is he’s a javelin thrower
He needs to be in football  Scores a goal in Tennis 🎾
*We like sports* is most likely OP's favorite song.
Witch one😱😱😱
Wow it’s almost like it’d be harder to throw this far with a football because it’s %80 air 🙄
HOLY.. CRAP. THAT BALL CAN FLY.. NFL sign this man.
Both should be
Dude i push a cork down my butthole and fart after tacobell and it has the same affect the fuck you talking bout nfl
Nice
Baseball is easier to throw without making it spiral
How about the MLB…? Wtf 😂
Bro could probably hit 50-60yd with an absolute missile
No
What is he throwing? And what size is it lmao?
me when a car drives by
The Chicago Bears should sign this guy up now.
Hits a three pointer  "He need to be in the MLB"
A base ball and a football are 2 different things💯
"hE nEeDs tO be iN dA nFl" meanwhile pass is out of bounds, get good sucka
I could throw a baseball further cause I can throw rotten apples under my tree all the way to my pond and that’s def longer than a 100yards😂
Takes alot nore than that to make it in the NFL🤣🤣🤣🤣
That’s a baseball
It's hard to believe that some people lose their shit over a fucking ball 🙄
I know!! I can't believe he caught that. In the dark even.
He needs to be in class, studying, for his future as he aint got none throwing baseballs on a football field
Could he do it with a Bowling Pin tho???
Ik his arm is sore I just have a feeling yk
Impressive, but the high % chance of injury just isn’t worth it if you won’t your throw to last.
115yds is what... 345 feet? It's impressive but most MLB outfielders can make that throw with ease.
Holy crap! What incredible strength!!! 🤯
Dude….. I could do this when I was 15 years old. This isn’t even impressive
W👀W
Tackles his little brother  He should be in the UFC
That one gym teacher who can do crazy stuff like this settings.
Throw it like that on a rope then I'll be impressed
I dunno about the NFL but ol boy has a rocket for an arm.
Both of them actually, that catch on the other end as well!!
Nfl a p***y sport
Except that's not a football
Distance vs accuracy are different. I would say no
Nope
Dats a GUN right there👍👍
This is not as impressive as it looks
This is not that hard😂😂 most folks i played ball with could do this at 15 -16
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱 y'all done yet
Damn nice throwing arm tho
No
Goal!!
pffftt.. I can do that with a bowling ball easy 😎
Okay but can he throw accurately, instead of throwing his arm out and getting lucky. Noone is the entire length of a football field away.
That’s a whole entire baseball baseball and football are very different
Coach:hit your cut off this dude: nah forget tagt
Hahaha not hard with a baseball bro
Forget sending javelin launchers to Ukraine, send this guy🤯
Now imagine a top end nfl qb throwing it.
*Hill Sachs injury has entered the chat*
Wrong sport u mean basket ball
Do it with a football, same length and yardage. Only then can you speak
Y
Was That A Golf Ball?
Damn and I thought I threw my apple core over my car well yesterday 😔
Well because you asked, I’ll say yeah and just except that you’re a few 🏈 short of a full game brother.. lol..
I can do it with a baseball but no way you getting a football that  far
Soon he’ll be in an arthritis commercial
Maaaan I can do that with a baseball too
I guarantee you he's a baseball player, and remember in the bit so distant past, one quarterback from LSU could throw over 59 yards sitting down, got drafted to the NFL, and you could say ," Where is he Now"!???
If its a baseball no, heavier things tend to go further
Nice but that’s not happening with a football
You’re right he should be. It was a really good catch
Y’all do realize a football is harder to throw as far?
Cool thing about baseballs is if you throw hard enough and put enough rotation on the ball it'll actually achieve left. Football's rotate the wrong way.
Plenty of college baseball players can do that
No.... just, no. Shut up also..
the way you throw a baseball is a whole lot different than a football. whole different hand motion, arm motion, and follow through. No
Like a nerf
Whoever made this has never held a football apparently.
When I was younger, that would have been easy, with a football.
You mean "MBL"?
That Catch was "Thug Life" at it finest lol didn't even adjust his stance for impact absorption😎🤙🏿
Yaaa,,, I can do that to.
They saying this bc of his arm, it’s insane
sell the account for this
So wheres the football? Cuz this aint it chief 🤦🏽‍♂️
Lol this post is from max preps? That’s embarrassing
What's he throwing?
Cooks five star meal  “Damn bro you should lawn company”
No he couldn't do it with a football, not even close.
I can do that shit all day too lmao no I can't throw a foot ball half that distance though 😂😂
oh sh*t
Was that a one handed grab?
https://youtu.be/SvS3bIMxFg8
Big difference on throwing a baseball and a football
Nobody talking about that amazing catch lol
Why would the military keep putting money into grenade launchers when they've got this fucking guy
*throws a baseball “He should be in the NFL”
“He needs to be in the Kentucky Derby” Drives a literal monster truck
What the F? 😮👍🏼
Throw it on a line and I’d be impressed
Ya that's a baseball man diff air drag and no spin requirment
“Outfielder”
The person catching it was more impressive than the guy throwing the ball!! Takes precision to keep your 👁 on the ball
Lmao 🤣 wow I thought it was a football 🏈 I can literally throw a baseball ⚾️ 3 football fields probably more
Not a chance with a football lol
It was a good catch, but NFL material? Nah.
The crowd tho 😂
That’s not a football 🏈
It's not the same but still impressive
Lmao science will give you the answer your looking for.
more like the MLB
No but I think he could play baseball
Needs to be in the NFL… is also throwing a baseball 😂 🤦🏽‍♂️
NHL draft him now
Looks like a baseball 🤡
U mean mlb
Baseball>football
Dude I can do this I’m 6’2 lefty
no one else gonna talk about that throw?
Football…..no. Plus he took hella step foward before launching that ball……called momentum. But nice nonetheless
No, bareballs are smaller which makes the grip and release much easier and tighter. That plus the balls weight to size ratio allows for longer air time
WHAT AN ARM OMG
out of bounds....
With a football? No. Still, what a throw.
Deflate gate
Obviously not
The accuracy though
Everybody in high school can throw a baseball that far that’s nothing amazing about that if he grow a a shotpuck that far the. I’d be impressed
I don't think some people understand that physically a football cannot go farther than a baseball.  Meaning with this guys arm
Just being able to throw far doesn't mean you have the skills to be a pro ball player lol
Ppl in the comments are dumb the caption clearly says “can he do this with a football” and furthermore no average person can throw a baseball 50 yards nevermind a whole field😭😭😭
The video is always unfocused, blurry, shaky, when these things happen.
"Go go gadget Arm"
I thought it was a football at first I was thinking no way in hell
Football weighs more
NERF FOOTBALL LEAGUE
Yeah just like JaMarcus Russell!
Why?
Wow that guys really good at catching
Who needs to be in NFL??? The catcher or the thrower?
A rugby ball*
Not that hard it is only 300 feet with a baseball
Short answer… No.
it doesn't matter that  arm 💪 strength is real.
Hell no I couldn't do that and I'm 6'1 185lb I can throw the ball about 40 yards
To answer your question..... No.
Maybe, Except that was a baseball not a football
I am complete.
Only of the nfl let you throw baseballs.. give him a football and see how many yards he covers
In what way does this affect Majin Buu's plan to destroy each galaxy?
He Definitely could not w a football wtf
That’s a baseball not a football
Anyone who throws over 90 can throw a baseball that far
Imagine him watching the dirty and pleasuring himself holy jsesus
The difference between throwing a baseball and a football is astronomical
It's a different ball...
Jamarcus Russel could throw a football 65 plus yards on his knees….just remember the name..😉
Caption could he get brain damage and lose the ability to pronounce big words
If he could do this to a football we wouldn’t be having this conversation
That was a baseball. Lol  and by the time it hit the other persons glove the batter woulda hit up 2nd and 3rd
Thats a baseball…
First of all not a football. Secondly a strong arm doesn't mean ish. Anyone else remember Jamarcus Russell?
Doesn't mean anything, let's see him read a defense and move in the pocket
I guess javelin throwers do too
Lolol so what
Bro which one?? The one with the fucking bazooka or the the guy who brought a mitten?
Out of bounds.. Incomplete 😞
Yea but can he do that with all the padding the helmet and a bunch of players around him trying to take him out?
Shot gun pass
You obviously have never thrown both a football and a baseball. Stupid
That's a baseball lmao footballs are much different y'all dingleberries
Ima be that person😂😂 anybody can do that with a baseball 😂
I am a ribbon dancer and I can throw a baseball farther than that
That’s a baseball…I could make that throw
That’s baseball not a football
Throws a BASEBALL across a field.oh that guy needs to be quarter back! Yea cause a football and baseball are so much alike.dumbass!!
Should be in boxing if he can throw like that.
Nope
No, he can not do that with a football.
I don’t know what is better the throw or the catch
Awesome catch
throws a baseball  “bro should be in the national football league “
Uncle Rico could throw a football over them mountains
At first i thought it was a football. I was more impressed by the catch than anything. But it was just a baseball 😢
Dam good throw and one handed catch 😯👏
What is this guy's name?
Indeed impressive but idk a football heavier
Damn I couldn’t even throw it half way tbh
Wtf.  Fucking. Aliens. Man
NO!
Throwing with a foot all is different from a baseball, dude might have a arm but there more that goes into it
Foifballs get kicked. The clue is in the name
At first I thought it was a 🏈
NFL? Bro this kid won’t last in D3.
Damn Mr. Incredible
Over qualified
the thrower or the one that caught it with one hand
Hell no
I don't care how good this guy thinks he is, he'll never be able to throw a football over a mountain like  Uncle Rico
Let’s ignore the catch made with one hand
It's not that difficult to do with a baseball
No baseball dummy
112 yards… wow that’s Impressive😱
Which one?!?!
If Usain Bolt be like himself to receive the ball. And get out of the tackles at the same time. Really he is part of a alien colony easily.
I literally did this in the 8th grade at a school competition
yah, throughing a baseball that far, not that hard at all. Im 13 i can i through at least that far, probably farther.
Is this the vortex?
Seriously they both should
What a idiot NFL???
*tosses a grenade 100 yards* “He should be in the US Open” =_=
Jesus christ
No
What "cut off man"?
It's a baseball ffs, can no one throw?
The throw or the one handed catch lol
Does a Crow hop throw that's all, any high schooler can do that with a baseball
That’s fake anyway
Definitely  sign him
He couldn't even be in the MLB with that arc. The fuck outta here.
Welcome to baseball long toss. Varsity pitchers do this to warm up in high school
That ball has zero relevance to football
Is that a nerf football
That’s trash 🗑! Watch Bo Jackson throw from the warning track to home plate on a line.
Negative. Not with a football. No sir/ ma'am
Not even close, still a pretty sweet arm though.
Hellz no. I use to long toss (baseball) end zone to end zone. Football is completely different.
Put him in baseball and he'll be golden
What was that blue light
Anybody who played baseball in highschool knows someone on their team who could do this..... Semi-impressive at best 😏
Or an MLB outfielder?
You know a baseball weighs a lot less than a football,so,no
I don’t know what more impressive the throw or the catch
Get a job at the border. $$$ uncut white stuff.
“Skis the bunny hill” He should be an Olympic  swimmer
But how's he get the ball back to. Him????? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔😕😕😕
So let me get this straight pitching a baseball gets u into NFL now wtf Is going on...
That was not a football..
Baseball
*Does a cool backflip* “That man should be a Doctor” 😂  Like what?
🫣Yes he does
Still good throw and catch but not a football
The thrower or the catcher? Also, wouldn't baseball or cricket be more suited for them?
I can throw a baseball probably 20 more yards then this with no issue, I can throw a football 50 yards at best, so ni
We used to toss on the football fields all the time this shit light lmao
Bruh I had Tommy John and I guarantee I can still do this lol
No, no he couldn’t
….. but a baseball is way different than a football  I used to have a arm like that and i was able to throw it a lot straighter, not rainbow it over. I was a starting center and back up pitcher at my high school for that reason. But with a football I could barely hit 60 yards
Or maybe just a center fielder cause it was a baseball
That’s a baseball
That’s a baseball dude couldn’t handle playing football
Physics: No
Not with a football
No he couldn't do it with a football smh
absolutely Not
Is that a nerf football
That's about 330 ft throw straight to the catcher's glove; that's impressive, is the equivalent of throwing from left field to home plate no bounce.
I cant even punt that far
"He needs to be in the NFL!" *Tennis ball falls out of his shorts* (confused looks)
Wow - he got helium in that ball or is he just a baaaaaad maaan !!!!
That’s not a full sized football
Holy shit!
Or maybe MLB?
No he needs to be an outfielder
Nice arm but not with a football
103yds accurately with a baseball is good for about 70yds with a football with  decent mechanics.
Why not MLB lets not push it just do what you do
I guess so 😁
🤷
I cant tell exactly what hes throwing but if he could do that with a regulation football wich i dont think most NFL quarter backs can more than 70 80 yards or so but an arm like that regardless the major leagues would take an out fielder with that arm any day the rest can be trained
It that a ⚾️?
Not a hard feat...
I could throw it farther lmao and I don't belong in the nfl
It’s a fucking baseball nothing like a football lol
This is incredible
I don't know what's more impressive the throw or the catch
No
Could he do this with a football? Why didn’t he just try it with a football…? Df
Such a dumb question.
Throws one long pass and dude needs to be in the NFL?? Not.
Throws just like Kaep, Zack Wilson, Tony Romo, Trey Lance, RG3, Matt Ryan, and Winston. Way off target and gets INT or INC pass
No
How in tf
Is that a football or a baseball that is being thrown?
Which one the guy throwing for 105 yards or the receiver catching a 105 yard reception with one hand 😂😂
Umm, that's not a football 🤔
Sign him up for the army and just let him throw the bombs 🤣
No way.. geezus
No
Bet this dude throws javelin
that’s it, i’m calling our parents
He needs to be in the MLB.
Lol a football is a lot bigger he might be able to throw maybe like 30 40 yards
Baseball? Do able. Football? Goodbye shoulder.
First off, throwing far does not equivalent to being able to be an NFL QB. Not to mention it’s a fucking baseball.
Whoever asked the question needs a slap
Great length and accuracy
Bruh that's that's whole baseball....not the same
He could o ly do this about 3 times before his arms fucks up
U mean both of them
He can throw and,Accuracy
I guarantee you that's not an official NFL football. Who knows maybe nerf will start a league.
First off, a baseball isn't a football, there is zero translation between the two. It takes very different throwing forms to achieve maximum distance with each ball. Secondly, everyone in the comment section saying most high school baseball players can throw 300 foot is false. You would likely have to throw in the upper 80s to achieve that distance. MOST being the MAJORITY of high schoolers can't touch that speed. I threw 87 from the outfield coming out of high school and I couldn't clear the 330ft wall in left field. Fast forward a few years I'm in college and clocking 91 consistently from the outfield and throwing over a 365ft wall almost daily at the end of a long toss session. I could throw a decent spiral for 60 yards. Farthest ball I've ever seen thrown in person was 410ft from a guy named Josh Shelley who got drafted for pitching and he threw mid to upper 90s. Hell even Trevor Bauer was only throwing the full length of the field in college. Here's a video to prove it. https://youtu.be/9w3xwYIx17s  My point in this rambling is no one is ever throwing a football as far as a baseball (445ft is the record). So don't even make the comparison.
Trever Bauer’s pre game warm up
???😂😂 I can throw a baseball across a field… not even close with a football.
Now let’s see if he can get the same distance without a crow hop
No Neither can he
Michael Jordan won’t got nothing on him
👀
NFL?????? Nigga that’s a baseball
He would do well in little league with that throw.
Ball is too high
Ummmmm Wow!!
Hoo hoo!! 25 mile an hour wind blowing into his back
I’m a football 🏈 player and I can probably throw a baseball that far, I don’t play baseball.
Ain’t the same with them pads on
He has a stronger arm than josh Allen and mahomes
It’s honestly not hard for a baseball player to throw a ball 100 yards
To answer the caption: No
He doesnt need to be in the nfl they both need to be in the nfl
When you direct your energy from your legs to your arm. Just concentrate on it.
@nfl
Dang that was a good throw!!
Bruh I could do that at 14 gtfo
Bro I thought it was a football and was thoroughly impressed. Then realized it’s a baseball😑 I could go to a field and throw that rn…
The arm strength is one thing but check the accuracy thooooo 👍🏾
SAME I DID THAT YESTERDAY
I was about to say . Nobody throwing a football that far . Still impressive tho for a baseball going that far
Ik its not a football, but thats still impressive bc ive never had a good arm🤣
I play baseball I can’t even throw it 150ft he throwing it 300+
It's a baseball dude lol... nowhere close to the same thing as a football
Imagine you're in war and you see them throwing grenades like that
No cap how the fuck I throw pretty hard, his arm must be trained since young or something
MLB lol
Who the fuck is that!!!That is like super power shit!!!
That's not hard with a baseball 😂
because he can   throw to a standing still object?
Cap my cawk is longer
He def in the wrong sport
Which one 👀
No no no no no! We don’t need anymore football players. We need to just ban sports in general
Bo Jackson made a throw to home plate from the warning track with a runner coming from second base
The new deku
Lol throwing a football gpod is 90% spiral and form and 10%  arm/strength
No
Trever Baur can throw a baseball like 450 that’s nothing lol
No.
The hell with NFL go talk to AUBURN please
They both do cause how dude catch tht??
That ball went:➡️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬇️
MAN THAT IS EASY TO DO 👈
The answer is no
🤯
😳😳
Who gives a damn he did it with a baseball
Wyd if he punch yo mom💀
Not impressed…put it on a rope. and confused with the NFL reference  I remember hosting Tarvaris Jackson. TJ could sling the football post to post
Someone explain to me how to throw a baseball or tennis ball without hurting your shoulder???
Which one he can throw for and the other one can catch with one hand
Which one the one who caught the one who threw the ball
MLB***
Who cares if he could do it with a football he's doing it with a baseball and if he's an outfielder that would be a bomb
Football is gripped in the whole hand football your gripping parts he’s not gonna throw a football that far
That’s not far I would’ve sent it over the  net
Wtf? Title does not make sense.
Warning track arm
Dude has a cannon for an arm but throwing a baseball is nothing like throwing a football  Example I can throw a base ball 2 times the distance I can throw a football if not more
They both need to be in the NFL
I’m English an I’m pretty sure, that’s a baseball!!
Witch one
A baseball and a football is two different things lol😂😂😂
Y'all forget this how Patrick mahomes started football. Someone saw him throw a baseball and said he should play football😂
You can tell by the sound how impressive that shit was.
After doing careful research I can confirm…         He can’t
Not a baseball or football.
I don't even play football and I can throw across the whole field with a football pretty accurately. My coworker didn't believe so after 3-5 throws, I was basically laser. There's a lot of very talented people in various things. They're just not into it. Make sense?
Kicks a soccer ball  "He needs to be in nascar"
He can prolly throw a football 50 yards 😭
Thought he was gonna run and catch it
Every high school athlete could do
*Hits golf ball 250 yards*  "He needs to be in the NFL!"
Did he throw a baseball
he farted throwing that ball omg
My dad used to throw a football far like that and be very accurate.....facts💯
His dog be skinny as hell
If you play baseball you would know usually a baseball field is about 400 feet and a football field is about 300 feet so if you can’t throw a baseball that far you probably shouldn’t be playing
300 feet with that arch and hang time…. Not that impressive tbh.
speechless.
Cap
Even with a. Baseball its impressive
Me throwing my marriage certificate away 😆
What he throw? A golf ball
It’s a female recording this
That's the same kid they had throw the spear in the movie 300. 💪
Wild
QB is more about accuracy
That's not a Football though....
Wait that was a baseball?…..tf is the point of this lol
That’s a baceball
Wtf.
No he needs to be in the MLB
I think they both need to be in the NFL
No
Dude rotator cuff is destroyed
Everyone who plays baseball can do this
idk what’s more impressive , the throw or the catch😭
ummmm...no....Michael Vick threw it across the city!
Could he do this with a football?  No cause hed be on a team already
Dude my shoulder hurts throwing it once with all my force and I only make to about 30-40 yards☠️
He missed the cut-off
Not impressed lol I can do this shit
330 ft throw so he probably can throw 90-94 mph
Superboy lives huh?
That was a good one handed catch
I used to do this a lot. Makes me sad. I coulda done something. 😔 Probably should have. Not that anyone on here would believe me anyway.
Can throw further than Patrick Mahomes
With the 9er defense rushing him nope
It’s a baseball. 🤡
They both do
That’s a baseball or softball
Jesus Christ
Nerf.
That’s my school
Which one lol both
Big difference then throwing a football don't cha think 🤔
Who is this
That's a baseball my guy.
how you gonna throw a ball 327 ft 😅
Back in the day that was me my brother and my older sis with the football no cap
Kids football
Wat was that
I can throw a baseball from one end of a football field to the other, I'm sure most people can.
Throwing a baseball and an NFL size football are not the same
I call cap
Not even close
Is that even a football. The other guy catches it a little to easy to be a football. And with an actual football its a different thing
Which one
That was amazing!!!🫶🏽
I find that throw impressive even if it's a baseball, honestly.
Maybe MLB is a better option
Hell no
That’s a baseball tho..
I think they meant MLB
Baseball not a football.
Can't do that without a running start though.   Penalty all day he running that far past the line.
The player’s name is Jason Valerez
No
I bet Aaron Rodgers can throw a baseball 200 yards or more
They need to be in the NFL
I can catapult tf out a baseball. That doesn't mean shit when it comes to a football
His shoulders only have a few years left.
This is baseball
Dddaaammmnnn...
Deflate gate!
When you physics questions are ignoring air resistance..
110 yards. 330 feet. That’s left field to home 🤷🏼‍♂️. Pretty typical of a good baseball player
Me and my dad used to do this when I was younger
what a cannon
Big deal.   Anyone can make that throw at that angle.
No he doesnt cause that's not a football
Wait what nhhh
Impressive but no he could not do that with a football 😂
Hope yo ass got the all time team o line protecting you to take a running start like that
Draft him... jeez
Do people think this is real or fake
NFL? it's a baseball
Accuracy, pressure, pissed off monsters trying to rip you apart..... Ok
Baseball players in MLB will throw the ball farther😂
How did you get ahold of uncle Rico’s high school highlights?
Yeah right
It's only one person who was that guy throwing the football 75 to 85 yards with a flick of a wrist ' Michael Vick ' ✊😲😮😯
Dude it’s a baseball if anyone practiced a little bit they could probably throw it that far
I can do that too with the nurf ball with the wings on the back
That’s no football man. Those are spherical. But for real that’s not a football
No he wouldn’t be able to do
😂😂😂 one hit and he’ll quit anyway
The NLB not the NFL
A football and a baseball are two diff weights.
But is it a football tho 🤔🤔
No
throwing a ball and a football are two differeance thing.
It's way easier to do that with a baseball than a football...
A baseball literally barely a pound, and if you have the right breeze you can throw dat bih more than 100 yards
That’s a baseball not trying to bust your bubble but my son can even do that and so Could anyone that plays the sport
Tom Brady: And I took that personally
It's a baseball.. this isn't hard
It’s a baseball not a football 🤦🏽‍♂️ whoever made the captions is LD
That's a baseball...lol ....
It's Nerf or nothing!!!
Any outfielder with a decent arm can do this. It’d be impressive if he threw it on a line
But that’s a baseball… 😑 He’d throw a football maybe 60% of that distance and that’s being generous
Bro was that was Patrik mahomie throwing the base ball around with he's he outfielder..
Are we not gonna talk about the guy who caught that missle?
Baseball sstupids!!!
I mean the fact that the guy catching it barely moved to catch it was amazing
I don’t know if the throw or the catch was better on god.
No
That accuracy thougg
I love the Ooh on the throw and ahh on the catch. We're advancing in so many ways but still a simple simulation 😂😂
Which one?
He launched that shi*
NO
Dayum
The person that wrote that question has never played a sport in their life. Dumbest shit ever. Would be like seeing Tiger Woods hit a long drive and asking could he do this with an egg?
Could be do this with a "football"? Hmmm, a "football"🤔 That "football", isn't it played with by hand? 🤔🤔🤔
Damn
Is this real, I would probably three times throw the ball to get to the other side. And look like it is laser guide ball, so precise.
In baseball that's expected of ye average outfielder
Not hard actually. Hand him a real football
Yea... No
Back in my day I could throw football clear over those mountains
Both of them do
Don’t let coach see 😂
Who wrote the caption… of course you can’t do that with a football. Smh
Does it really matter if it wasn’t a football bro just threw 100 yards like it was nothing 😂
Lol no
He might not be able to throw that far with a football, but that is an insane arm
That a not a real football.
No no no. MLB people he is literally throwing a baseball
Know let me know the size of the ball because bro caught that too calmly
Its a baseball
Just because he can throw don’t mean he need to be in the NFL QB’s who just throws ……… sack sack sack
This really isn't that impressive it's not even that far Edit: he also arches it hella high would have been more impressive if it were more of a straight line then that
Jesus christ how the hell?
Why does he need to be in the NFL? Because he can throw far? That don’t mean sh*t.. I have a huge D*ck and that don’t mean I should be in porn.
or the mlb
I’m impressed the other guy caught it, god that probably hurt through the glove
That better not be a Subway sandwich.
both need to
I don't wanna see a rainbow, I wanna see a line drive 😂
What is that he threw? A baseball??
Why he didn’t throw a football 🏈  It’s like watching a guy drive a car and ask “can he do that with a motorcycle?”
The guy who caught it definitely needs to be in the NFL
No
Somebody get him a contract rn Sign him💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Who?  The guy who threw it or the guy who caught it
What size is that football 👀
No
Good arm👍🏼
No that’s only about 310 ft throw with a baseball..
Why? He would have to look at 10 men and tell them to do something they did without a hesitation, then throw a football and hit the receiver not allowing the defender to get it, in their motion while a 300# guy hit him with the force of a car wreck, get up and do it again, in front of a crowd and millions of people watching on TV. Do that about 60 times a week for 4-6 months, then do it again next year. Didnt see any of that on display.
Had to have been napoleons uncle
Lmao , why not the MLB outfield . I mean it’s a baseball he’s throwing
That lil ass nerf ball
What an idiotic question. Can he do it with a football. U are aware a baseball is much smaller and we have the best people to throw a football in the world on tv every week and they don't come close. So to answer ur question. Is no
When the NFL starts using baseballs maybe...
Okay but dude that caught the ball also caught that shit with on hand
How Many Balls he trow to the space
"did you do it?" "yes" "what did it cost" "my rotator cuff"
no
I can throw a baseball that far haha not that hard especially when u play outfield u train to crank it home
Hail Mary
Why
Incoming football players saying this is easy 😂 let’s see you try
"Hit your fucking cutoff!!!"
It's impressive but baseballs and footballs aren't built the same
WTF did he just throw
Pretty sure that's a baseball ⚾️
Throwing a baseball 300 feet isn't very hard to do..
Catch was pre clean to
Hell no haha. That is a baseball. I used to throw the ball this far while long tossing.👍🏼
Thats a trebuchet
Kyle Boller for the ravens did the same thing...
Its a impressiv throw for sure but im almost certain that he used a ball which was designed for long throws.
WOAH
A baseball is easier to throw..give him some official skins. See what he's got then
*Patrick mahomes enters chat*
I said he gets about 63 yards with a football
If he can throw a football that far.. but I think not..🤔🤣
No, not if he ate all the Wheaties.
A lot of dudes can do that lol
Is that a baseball?  We've seen what happens when they draft baseball players into the NFL  Tebow
It's a baseball not a football but he might can do it with a football
He's not throwing a football like that.
Cool... I did that in 5th grade with a softball lol
No
More like MLB
Woah that’s a weird looking football
But it was a baseball not a football?!
Easy frfr. Football? Doubt it
Damn!!💪💪💪
Baseball=football….
That was a tennis ball so yeah football for dwarf creatures yeah
God damn!
Hell no. Different mechanics
I can throw a baseball farther.
Both
Cannon arm
With a 10 step crow hop and a throw that went 80 feet high I hope you can make it that far
Impressive 🤔
Yeah I could but he couldn’t
MLB*
Any pitcher, catcher or outfielder throwing 90mph can throw this far. Nice accurate toss but nothing special for a good high school, JC, college or minor league player.
Too easy
Lol NFL? 😆  he throws a ⚾️
High school fields and NFL fields are different easily 50 yards on an NFL field
This can't be real
Not a football  😐
Which one lol who through the bal lord who caught with one hand standing in one spot
Throwing a baseball 300 feet is not hard I can do that and I’m 13
Vinny testaverde formerly of the Tampa Bay buccaneers threw 80 yard bomb in 1988..Record... So the answer is no,u cant throw a football farther
Or In film school
Having a cannon really doesn’t mean shit. I thought it did until I had to read a defense. Than my coaches said I should probably wear a helmet outside of the field.
Boffum
Uhh, maybe MLB?🤔 Beautiful throw!!
Because he threw a baseball?? God you kids just keep getting dumber , don't you????
I’ve got to say he has a hell of an arm
Nice crow hop
Dudes arm is gonna be blown out real quick he keeps doing that
Ummm..no anyone with a twig and berries should be able to throw a baseball that far
I went to school with a kid that can do this with ease nothing amazing really there are alot of kids with this ability
Impressive throw but no lol. He could not do that with a football.
Could he do this with 300 lbs of lineman  on his ass
Must be a Cricketer ( Aussie ) arm
Will you teach me to football!?!?!?
Yet, he's throwing a baseball. Ok...lol.
🧢
That’s not impressive, put it on a line then we can talk
Now you need a wide reciever thats runs 40 yards in 1.5 seconds
He could definitely give Yoenis Cespedes a run for his money🤷🏽‍♂️
What
I feel like it was a baseball cuz it flew pretty fast
Baseball??!
He wouldn’t throw that far but he could still throw a football obviously💀
That's a hard no.
R. U. Kidding me!  Sign him up!
I'm not impressed by his performance.
Wow he  arm on him
Oh man sign him up!!
Legend has it…that was HER less dominant hand.
Troll
Whys no one talking about the one hand catch so effortless
Reminds me of High School
Or baseball 😂 bro can throw far now he deserves a spot in the nfl 💀💀 gtfo
Witch one?????
Yikes rainbow
Yo bro hand me the remote :
they both do 🤯🤯🤯
No
It’s a baseball
they domt need pros they need marketing slaves..this man is thrower
Not gonna lie I could throw like 300 feet in middle school I bounced a ball into a trash can from center field at a little league all star tournament and won ...I was a 3rd baseman though
That's nothing with a baseball lmao
🙄
i think he should stick to baseball
It's a baseball...... most centerfielder can do this
I think he’s talkin about his accuracy 😑
But that's a baseball..
Physics says no. Weight, size, density, wind resistance, many many factors why a baseball and football travel differently
Which one the dude who threw like uncle rico over them mountain's or the dude who caught it one handed like it was nothing
Why do Americans call their shit Football when their ball isn't even round?
Not that impressive it’s a baseball lol I can throw it 325 feet and that wasn’t even all my strength so no definitely not a football I can only throw a football 70 yards
People in crowd sounded like some Wii Sports spectators  😭😂
Now do it with a football.
My son threw further at 13.
Damn. 😉
🧢
No
Hits a home run ⚾ HE SHOULD BE IN THE NFL
Not that impressive y’all straight up and I’m no fucking tom max brady scherzer
*Throws a baseball* yeah we need to get this guy to be a punter
For all those saying “it’s not a football” throwing a baseball 100 yards ~90 MPH fastball he threw it 110 yards so that’s ~ 94 MPH. Still very impressive, I can’t get a baseball past 75 yards
Bitch could what a throw n catch lol
What major league football
Mlf
Baseball and a football aren't even close. Centerfield sounds more realistic. Being he can hit
Me being a long jumper just looking at how big the track is
Omg a baseball
Completely diff wit a baseball… I can make that throw in baseball as I am a former pitcher but it’s a lot diff wit a football
Bro... its a baseball. Calm down just because its on a football field 😵💯
I can throw a baseball that far as well lol that’s barley from 300 feet to homeplate
bruh wtf both of ‘em need to be the dude who caught it looked like he caught it with one hand?!?!?!
Nope football weight and all is totally different
Of course not
I could do that in my mid to late twenties. If I tried that now, I'd probably be recouping for three to six months. "Back in my day....."
More like MLB my Cardinals need him
bruh, i throw that for warming up 🤣
Arm power correlates with throwing, if he can throw a baseball that far, if he learned how to throw a football he would throw dimes, he also threw it dead to the guy, so yeah it would correlate over decently
Which one  should be in NFL? Left or right?
It’s a baseball! Caught with a baseball glove
Damn you're close to it with a football he definitely has skills.
Was impressed until I realized it was a dam baseball
MLB
That’s a baseball
Both
He’s better off throwing a javelin
Baseball different cuh cuh
No
"Cmon Tim another Hail Mary Play?"
Is that a turbo jav?
Why? It's a baseball not a football
That’s easy
Was that a vortex?
That’s a baseball
God bless you all and your families 🙏🏽✝️🛐
Lmaoaoa no. Hell get pretty far tho
Not a regulation football. Probably one of the nerf ones with the tail fins. Unimpressed
Both of them good QB and WR
"Could he do this with a hand egg ?"  No.
Shittt 👀
that’s literally not that hard lmao
I do that with baseballs that’s not anything special
No he couldn’t
You’d ride the bench if you threw like that from the outfield. Not impressive.
Why...cause he can throw a ball far? That literally means nothing.
No. He could probably throw it 65 to 70yrds though.
You realize that is not a football?
Oh shit it's a baseball?? I was going to be so impressed and honestly mind boggled if he threw a football like that
It's a baseball tho so .. no.
Both of them
Who?
Who is that ? Needs to go straiht to nfl
Why’s no one talking about the one handed catch?
Shit i can do that🤣
NFL but he throws baseballs?
Well can he run fast dos he work well with his team
Witch one the father or the trower lol
As a Non-American, I'm just really surprised that throwing something is considered a talent 😂
Its a football field, but he throwing a baseball… i guarantee you hell be useless in the nfl
But that's a baseball
No. No he can't.
the simple answer to that is "NO".
That catch was primo as well ⚾️🤳🏼
Bro Americans built different
Can I get a DRAFT.
Wow
Lmao that’s cute for a baseball😂
thor can't throw that far
Hell no but with a baseball that’s still a fucking bomb
This guy couldn't throw a football half that distance
Damn that accuracy is insane
beast titan
I can hear my coach yelling "PUT THAT ON A LINE!!" In my head 🤣🤣 IFYKYK 💀 💀
Good throw
Bro I can throw a football 65- 70 yds. I for sure i can launch a baseball that far flat footed and I'm sitting on my couch 😭
The other guy looked like he caught it with 1 hand
No. Shit the fuck up. He would get destroyed in nfl
Baseball outfielder position seems like a better fit.
This kid needs to go to med school
Who ever caught that hand eye coordination is valid
It's a baseball calm down 😂
Not that hard
My mom: " go show that NFL scout what you're made of." Me: ( throws a baseball decently far )
Hell no!
Idk if that was a good throw or a good catch
Super human!!
My brother can do this bro it's not that crazy
Damn son
Do you mean NBA
Bro I think they both need to be in the NFL
No he shouldn’t dude can probably throw a football 40 yards max💀
Nah join the army
The beat off🤣🤣💀💪🏾
I mean a lot of people can’t catch like that. I think he’s got a shot.
He needs to be on a baseball field
Its a baseball for goodness sake
MLB*
Bruh that’s a baseball. What are you on
fuck thats insane
Oh that's just a baseball? Not a football? Okay makes a little difference. I'd love to see this done with a football.
Too easy
At least whoever is recording is trying with their intelligence level, supportive, even if you don’t make no sense 😅😅
Unrealistic
Maybe once or twice before completely shredding his rotator cuff
Long toss on the football field used to be so much fun.
FIRST RECRUITING HIM IS  1. NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS  2. TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS  3. DALLAS COWBOYS  4. NEW ORLEANS SAINTS  OR 5. MIAMI DOLPHINS  NOW THIS IS MY PERSONAL BUILD OF TEAMS WHO WERE POPPING THE LAST YEAR I WATCHED N.F.L. FOOTBALL. AND IT'S BEEN SINCE 2008, SINCE I WATCHED N.C.A.A. COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND MY PERSONAL RANKING WAS OF TOP 5 WAS, 1. L.S.U. TIGERS 2. FLORIDA GATORS 3. AUBURN TIGERS 4. CLEMSON TIGERS OR 5. ALABAMA CRIMSON TIDE!
Aron rogers is that u
POV:aron that’s a bad idea u know that u are a freak of nature and if u throw that ball they will know   Aron rogers pov: who’s gonna know they will never know
This be me when I forget to do the dishes
Apparently noone’s ever seen an MLB outfielder fucking *laser* a baseball 400+ feet to the catcher to tag a runner out before they get home.
IF HE COULD THEN HE WOULDA USED A FOOTBALL 🏈(ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD)😂🤣
Half my highschool team could do that
I think centerfield would be good for him
Na that just looks fun
Definitely have a strong tailwind.
Give him a golf club to play hockey 🙄
Baseball or football I wonder if that was a hockey puck
Man’s threw that shit over 300ft!
Lmao throws baseball—-HE NEEDS TO BE A GOLD MEDAL SHOTPUTTER
Lmfao.
no, he could be a great outfielder though
You mean baseball
Damn
This is impressive? Lol
Y’all want him be NFL bound so bad I think the mf MLB could use him🤣🤣
How windy is it? And it doesnt look like a football to me
Lol nice baseball which is a hell of a lot easier to throw than a football.
He could prob throw like 60 yards with a football cuz I can throw a baseball 100 yards but a football like 50
Holy fuck
I can do that with eaze
Even though that was a baseball, still a great throw and catch lol
That's a baseball though
Nah bro mlb out Field is where he need to be
💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿🙏🏿
That’s not really that far
It’s just a baseball I’m 36 and can do that
He needs to be an outfielder
Oh i thought it was a football my goodness
Ummm a grown man could easily throw a football field with a baseball please
he could probably do it with a football, but it would go about half as far
Nope could not make that throw with a football. NFL QBs can throw a max distance of about 70yds.
He would be a great goalie in the nhl  /is swimming 🏊‍♂️
Both of the the other guy caught it with one hand
How
Too much air time on that ball & then I found out later it was a baseball 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
*he should try soccer*
You can hear the guy in the background going "holy sh*t" 🤣
Bro what i never knew his leg could do the same thing as his arm
Hail Mary every play
*baseball
I’m just admiring this blue thing running past the screen
Or maybe…JUST MAYBE…he can be in the MLB 🤯🤯
Huge different between a football and a baseball🤦🏽‍♂️
Fuck no not with a football
the person who captioned this unironically uses the term "sportsball"
Halve the arc and I’ll start listening.
NFL? No. Try MLB Center Field.
No that's not the same at all
i’m pretty sure that just swished
All these haters!  Maybe that baseball identifies as a football
Which one 😂😂😂
You can do this much easier with a baseball than a football.
so if i throw a football on baseball field…. i should tryout for baseball?
It was just a throw we need more proof if he wanna be in da nfl 😐
He needs to be in the NFL for throwing a BASEBALL? I think he needs to be in the UFC...
If I threw a ball like that I would've dislocated my finger
Like most highschool outfielders can do this already
Looks like an homerun to me. Lol
Baseball and football are different weights. I’m sure he rocket either.
And now he's a gay transgender homophobe with a twin mother....
This was a baseball chill
Now do that 💯 more times. Then we will start negotiating.
He would probably fit in better if the MLB..
Definitely center field lol
That's good
That was impressive...but it was not a football... c'mon now
Honestly that's not too impressive with a baseball.
Baseball players get paid more so he should stick to Baseball lol.
Shit is light. The fuck y’all even know about sports
He “could” hit you from any yard line.
No
Amazing.
Must go go the Olympic games.
Maybe an outfielder for the cubs.
If he has accuracy maybe but we don’t know if he does this just shows distance. And he is throwing a baseball not a football and that can take years to adjust. So no I don’t think the NFL is a good fit for him.
Hell yea
correction *THEY* he obj the football from that far!
That’s a baseball ya donut. Great throw but a football is different
How is this impressive
He don't need anymore milk !?
No
Got that wii sports crowd in the background😂😂
I can't even hate on that. That's impressive
That’s a baseball right?
There's a couple kids in every high school that can moon shot 330.
No he needs to be right fielder
Easy to throw a baseball the length of a football field, but try a football. That thing is going 20 yards at best.
112 yard baseball throw.. WoW, barley would make it to the plate from the fence of center field
Who the one who threw the 🏈 or the one who caught it
Bruh thats a baseball not a football...
Fuck no he can’t do that with a football.
Felt all that pin-pain running through his veins after that hard throw
Windy
With a base ball yes but with a Foot ball no
“That was a great tackle from the defence…  Now let’s move to next hole which is a par 5”
Ummm that's a baseball..
Bro but this not a joke throwing anything like this.Damn it looks huge!
The throw was crazy but the catch
For cricketr this is way too easy
Alot of people can throw a baseball that far...not impressive
Foot ball nah
Do u understand how many pitchers can easily do this with less arch. Talking bout the nfl 🤡🤡
I can do that with only a couple steps it took him about 10
Really not that hard to throw a baseball that far 😂
Which one, Patrick Mahomes’s long lost non tiktok star brother or OBJ’s doppelgänger
I know it’s a base ball but to be fair that’s still impressive. They just dog shit at titling things
Which one?
It’s a baseball 🤣 if he should be in the NFL then so should every other baseball player
Definitely not lmao
That was a nice catch
He could be a nasty Outfielder with that arm but no he cannot do that with a football.  You definitely don't causually do that with a football.  But props to the kid throwing the baseball. Got that Lazar beam arm
I could do that
He needs to join the army and throw grenades 😂😂😂😂
Or the mlb ????????????????????
What was more impressive the throw or the one hand catch
He need to be in the mlb not football
He needs to be in the outfield
Yeah it's a baseball calm yourself
Which one needs to be in the nfl cause like they both just flexed
Which one the one handed catch or the  throw
Bru baseball
Could he do it with pads on no
120 yards...with a baseball.
He would be one of the best outfielders for a MLB team. No man would steal off of him
OK but the fact that he caught that
No
Now the dude who caught it has to run it back to him lol
I can throw a baseball that far . Come on man .
Why did you waste your time on this video
No
Which one?
BRO HOW
Nope
The kid that threw it or the kid that caught it
Which one dude who threw or it dude who mossed it? 🤣🤣
No, he needs to stay playing baseball cuase career longevity
Why are all u guys so negative and yes he does need to be in the nfl he has a good arm to throw and he can clearly launch a football the same way so stop the shitttz guys we all know he would kill it in the nfl with that arm all his teamates have to do is pass him the ball and let him launch it that far into the goal area someone find him and give him a contract he deserves it since he got that arm of iron man 😂
underrated catch
Damn 😱😉 no kidding that gentleman needs to be in the NFL. Throwing a football or whatever that is a little over a hundred yards looks like. So even a football you know he's going to be launching that good 80 yards. Wow you just go deep 🙏😉
he beat to much
Who is this dude. DAMN
A football quarterback could throw a baseball so much farther
Bro I thought it was a football until I saw it in the air
Ummmm that was a softball 🥎 show me that with a football 🏈
Bro threw a baseball😂😭
Makes a half court shot “He would be a legendary soccer player”
Everyone’s lookin at the guy who threw the ball…  Me: looking at that guy who catch the ball with one hand.
Agreed, nice catch.
damn that’s about 330ft 😂
No he can’t do that with a football probably would be able to throw far but not that far
Center field would be perfect
Everyone in the comments I dare you to do this then if you think it’s not good. Y’all ain’t going to do shii
Could not do that with a football
There once was a Quarterback by the name of Roman Gabriel of the original LA Rams that could throw.a football end zone to end zone.
How tf did he throw a ping pong ball that far? This man definitely needs to be in the NHL or PGA.
Guy definitely should to be the lead guitarist of Metallica! 🤯🤯🤯
Throws baseball - dang he should be in the NFL 🥴
I mean it's a baseball so maybe not the NFL 😂
No
Baseball
Nope
Any regular male can throw a baseball like that
Nope he ain't got it
Nice
Tf
Why? Does he like football or something?
A football is way different than a baseball
They don't throw mini footballs in the NFL
If my math is correct, he can throw a football to about 35-40 meters Less then Half a court...
Hell naw
NO
It’s a baseball…a 14 year old can do that
probably mlb
Easy lmao
Or he could be a baseball player
This man used one for all
NFL: He needs some milk.  😂
Dumbest caption ever😂😂😂
More like mlb
😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧
That’s not shit do it on a straight line
Not even close to the same thing 😂🤦‍♂️
Both can he caught and the other has a hell of a arm
Bro could through a field goal
Guy literally throws a baseball. He needs to play football... Wtaf
Nerf
Whoever wrote the caption must be so knowledgeable on sports ball
If he can Michael Vick in the pocket then yeah, but until then 🤫
No he could not do that with a football. I did that several times with softball, but could not with football.  You can't wind up like that with a football.
Agreed where’s his contact
Bruh no shot thats a football
Just cause you can throw far doesn't mean anything. You have to throw with precision. Make choices and last second decisions. Make or break situations.
I play baseball at the college level and we can’t throw footballs like that 😂
He needs to be in the MLB
Noo
But Can He Take A Hit, Is He ACCURATE, How Tall Is He??????? 😆 🤣 😂
That's a baseball so maybe he should play baseball hehhhhh
U mean baseball
That’s right there is what a 90+ arm looks like long tossing.
My dog would be like "Nah, you can go with me to get that."
The douchebag is not human.
No baseball plus he'll make more money
He needs to be in the NFL if they played baseball.
It’s a baseball…
Wow
Jesus loves you so much.
Yes tf he does!!
That's a baseball not a football
Absolutely not. I've seen many guys do this with baseball and not come close with football.
No. No he couldn't.
"could he does this with a football"? Unless he is Uncle Rico No.. No he cannot😂😂
I did this in high school. And it wasn’t a rainbow.  I’m confused.
Great arm for prep school.  It's a beautiful, accurate 315 ft toss.  But remember, most, if not all, MLB outfielders can make that throw, too.
He should be in the MLB not NFL😭 And the one catching is great at it too!
Helium in the ball  Nothing special
Which one
He couldn't do that with a football
Baseball an football very different sport an the ball is way heavier can glide through the air easy footballs have air in them so you do the math
Him: does that Me: *misses throwing my Subway sandwich wrapper into the trash can 2 ft away*
Why not the MLB, ya know…since he threw a ⚾️
This looks like one of those fake old videos like the truck helping a plane land and the guy barehand catching a baseball.
NO!
Im calling BS on this one
Honestly just goes to show some people don’t know sports and just like to see people Slam each other.
That was a left feather to home throw
Yes
Chill.
There’s a difference between throwing a baseball that far and a football that far
The both of em do
You not 300 feet
Absolutely not! That’s not hard to throw 100 yards with a baseball
Nerf ball sounds right
That's a baseball fam, not the same shit.
Easy
They both should, did the catcher just catch it with one hand
It would be more impressive if he would do it standing in one place instead of crow hopping it.
Me ok he's going to make a cool catch wtf!!
Omg ... this is literally insane 😳
Fuck football this dude should play baseball
Look like a girl caught the ball
He needs to be in baseball he would be a great pitcher!
The audience really made the wii sports crowd sound 😂😂
I think there are a lot of people out there that can throw a baseball that far big difference than a football
its easy to throw a small ball compare to actual football ball.
You know, tennis could be fun
No he needs to be in the mlb
Not a football but kool
He had tennis elbow for two months after that throw.
Throwing a baseball and a football a actually quite a bit different.
That’s a rainbow if I’ve ever seen one, a good outfielder should reach that in a good line
it’s a baseball and u obviously don’t know a baseball field is bigger than a football field😭 100 yards or 400 ft so good at basic conversions
Chugging a ball really hard like a caveman doesnt mean you can play QB lmao
He’d be a great swimmer
Bro that’s literally warm ups before a game stop it
I would of popped my arm out of socket
You know everyone ain't appreciating the fact he just threw a baseball across a football field
Fake
That’s a baseball and that’s 310 ft
Shi they both do
You mean baseball
Correction, *He needs to be in MLB*
Me not knowing weather to be impressed by the throw or the catch
NBL*
Any minor league baseball player could do this without too much difficulty.
It’s magnets in the glove and the football
Dude I want to see the other person toss it back.  He probably got a cannon too, and not getting to shoot his shot lmao
Damn .....
I can to
Because he can throw a nerf ball?
You mean both
I don’t think that was a football
That's actually not as hard as purple think with s baseball and it's easy to high tbh
Pretty much every pro pitcher in the league can at least throw that far. That’s only a little over 300 feet
Accuracy: you forgot me at home again dude
I know right. He caught the hell outta that ball.
Thats  no ordinary human
This should be a steroids commercial
Bro…..that shit was ON POINT😳😳😳😳
Nah but hed get atleast 60 yards with a football
How them 5'6" point gaurds b passing to 7' centers
Football was going 45 yards
Takes more than this to be an NFL player
That's some good accuracy with a 110 yard throw.
Nice logic buddy can throw a baseball must be fit for the nfl
You can thou
Gotta be fake ain't that way
That’s crazy
💯🧠🧠🤦🤦⛹️🤺
It's a baseball not a football bruh
Witch one?
Pretty sure that's a baseball
Or the mlb throwing out people at home from the warning track
No, I'm sure there was a football available in the  "football stadium"
Ok I wasn’t sure if that was a baseball or one of those rocket heavy foam little footballs but the dude caught it with one hand. If it’s a baseball that’s pretty standard but still great throw.
If anything, he should go into Javelin throwing
God damnnnnnn
No
Woah...  Woooiiihh!!
No no no no no nah nah bro how the hll did he do that
Whoever caught the ball with one hand is a God
If he made that throw in a pool y’all would be saying he should try out for the next Olympics
😲
Depends because a football is heavier so maybe
That’s not a football 🏈
No he can’t do this with a football smh
Nah 😳😯
what about da catch
He's not throwing nobody out at home with that rainbow
Looks like he needs to be in baseball. You know, being that's a freaking baseball he threw .. idiots
easy
Dude that’s wild
About 105 yard throw
Throwing a baseball 330 feet is not hard, it’s called long toss, my throwing partner and I hit atleast 350’ everyday before practice.
I feel like I could do that in about 5 more years (I'm 14 rn)  very impressive tho, the football field gives u a good understanding on how hard he launched that ball
holy shit bro 💀
Baseball is very different than a football, I could throw a baseball form left field to home plate 325ft on a hop in high school…it’s different  NFL 🙄
Meh...
I could do that too if it was a baseball, I've done it before
And the other guy just catches the ball with one hand 👌
He brings a new meaning to go long
No
The guy that threw it or the guy that caught it
Is that a real football? U should actually u should
No
No
He needs to be in water polo
Alr ik it’s not a football but how can y’all tell it’s a baseball from that far?
Baseball? Easy
Fake News!!!
No bc a baseball can be thrown farther lmaoo
You mean "they"
Maybe the NBL- but could he do this with a football… No
He could throw a rainbow 300 something feet that's not impressive trevor buer or however you spell it three it 400 in warmups
Who the guy who threw 100 yards or the guy who caught it
3 different sports in this video, who wouldve thought
Dad be Like: hold my drink
No
No you can’t compare a baseball to a football 🤣🤣🤣
aside from the fact it’s a baseball not a football, can we take a second to think about how good of a throw that actually is? it wasn’t just a straight line shot, it had enough power to go thru the tall arc, lose forward velocity from gravity & air friction, and still make it to the other person about 110 yards away. absolutely insane
yeah thats a mini football  n e man can chunk it to the moon
Bro facts the dude that caught that is crazy!
Lots of people can do that with a baseball  Including most nfl quarterbacks if you told them how to grip it
He must been in a fnl
No
now throw it on a line
That's a good rugby player right there
wow
Footballs and baseballs are two different shapes and sizes
Incredible
If you throw a baseball 100 yards, apparently that means you should be in the NFL
NFL?    That guy needs to be in the PBA
Him: Yeo fam, let’s play some catch  Also him:
Nope he could not a baseball is much smaller making it easier to throw
Tom Brady ball? 👀 💀
Dumbest fucking question ever asked. No he cannot.
That’s insane
Bro that catch was crispy https://youtube.com/channel/UC6qry6M1zcf5AgOUT1n41Uw
Why? It’s not a football.
The catch was more impressive than the throw
Ummmm I’m getting worried I didn’t see a glove on the dude that caught that baseball. Did bro catch it with his bare hands 😳
Lmao, no
It will be a miracle to catch and throw like that on a real football field with multiple players on you playing defense and offense
The ball is a completely different size and shape
I wonder if I can do that and I am a kid I can throw really far
I wonder which one has the better Talent, the one who threw it or the guy that had the God like hands to catch it.
For what throwing the smallest ball ever man that is so “impressive”
For those who don’t get it, he said this guy needs to be in the nfl because he threw the baseball really far, then he says could he throw the football like how he threw the baseball
That's a whole baseball
They need to be in the NFL
Nah he needa be cf in the mlb
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He needs to be in the NFL throws cat
THEY need to be in the NFL because that throw and the catch... amazing 👌👏
I can throw that on a line
baseballs are not hard to throw far, i play softball and sometimes if my team finds a baseball we play catch with it and you can throw it wayyyy farther cause it’s smaller and lighter. def not like a football😂
My boy just put helium in that mess.
It’s a baseball what do you expect 😂😂😂
DUMB PEOPLE THINKING HE CAN DO THIS WITH A FOOTBALL TOO  OR DUMB ASS THINKING IT WAS A FOOTBALL HE THREW
No if that's was a football if would've stop 30 yards before it hit the receiver
That arm would be a super power if he played baseball..
Both of them
Which one the throwing it or the one catching it they both can make it to the nfl he can throw he can catch
what tipe of ball? baseball?
Tell him to roll into the throw from the outfield.. it goes farther faster
No one's going mention how the other guy caught the "football" like a baseball?
Naah, he should be playing Minecraft
Goddamn!!!...was that real??
QB:I’m hulk WR:oh dang
They both
Dang sign him up
you mean mlb? tf where did nfl come from?
It's a freakin baseball... I actually thought it was a football at first
Not even using a NFL ball
Different ball lots of qbs can do that
Best in the nfl throw 70 yards
Still impressive even though it's not a football.
Woah he should play darts
Even I can do that and I’m in 6th grade
Cap
How many takes? Better be just 1
I want football Mom:you have football at home   Football at home:
Bro I don’t think people realize how fricken far he threw that ball
Mlb.. that’s a baseball.. longest throw in history is like 74 yards..
Did anybody see the blue light flash under the ball
They both need to be in the nfl
"Is a football different?", well, it is so much so that u couldn't even realize it...
Which one ...? XD
Baseballs are way easier to throw far distance than a football
When you do this you can say baseball is easy
His throw power is 150
More like mlb
Nice light throw
They both do for that bomb
Fake
That’s a baseball u goofy ah
Yes
Jeff George's son
Wich one
Dayummmmmm!!??!??!?
Man like how can u compare this to a football
Correction, THEY, that was a he'll of a catch
Wasn’t a football but still nice throw.
Forget cannon . Man had a rocket for a arm
80 yd is the world record for a football so what kind of ball was this?
Yeah because in the NFL their throwing baseballs
Why would center field not be okay?, WRONG  SPORT CAPTION
Imagine his speed and force in punches😦😯
That catch tho
I play baseball and sometimes football and I can tell you a baseball is much easier to throw and lighter.
Holy fuck!!
Dam I'm never gonna throw that far
He should do that contest where you have to throw a football really far
I do this all day @thebalanceguru
I would be screaming if I caught that my hand would be red
Umm that’s way easier to throw than a football
Nah he cheating
Which one the one that caught it or the one that threw it ?
Bitch no one can stop them
Go to paclers
God is good you don't know what God is doing but someday you will know repent and turn away from your sin
That’s a baseball ⚾️ 🤣
I'm calling BS
Nope not with a football
My pe teacher trowing a missile to the side of the planet
They have tested it and you have to throw at least 90 to throw a ball 100yds. I bet he could throw 95 maybe more
That’s like watching someone make a paper airplane and saying they should be a pilot
NFL? Fuck that get paid less and have a higher chance of brain damage MLB center field big bucks with that arm
Yeah if he’s throwing a baseball
Until I learned. That’s not a football 😭
They don’t allow white people in the NFL
That was a baseball I’m twelve and I can throw a baseball that far but can he throw a football that far?
Football or not most of y’all can never do this so stop hating and give the man some props smh 🤦‍♂️
Baseballs are built diff lol
It must be a young kid who wrote the nfl part
What about the guy catching. Shouldn't he be in NFL too
Sign him up
I could throw a baseball an easy 100+ yards (threw 84 sidearm when I played)...but my hands are a little to small to throw a football that far. But ik I could hit at least 50 yards tho with a football
Whoever that can do this with a football, will be rich instantly.
But who could get down there fast enough to catch the ball🤔?
There's a little more to it than throwing the wrong kind of ball from one side of the field to another with nobody around
He needs to be in NFL Every Indian as a kid (10-17):
Trevor Bauer?
Lmao you mean MLB? That my friend is a baseball
which one?
No, I could do this with a baseball. But it probably does translate to a strong football arm as long as he knows how to throw a football.
Turbo nerf is not nfl reg
Strength is strength and all but it’s a different ball shape, weight, size, grip, form, etc. Just cause I can dunk with a basketball doesn’t mean I can with a bowling ball
You mean baseball?
“Could he do this with a fishing pole?” -Golf
It’s literally a baseball bro who can’t throw a baseball 100 yards
No
The next brady
More like center field😂😭
Try softball…
Which one? Lol
Baseball and football have way different aerodynamics
Nice throw with the Nerf ball
Baseball or not. It was still impressive
Which one
I am thinking maybe he could throw 75 with a football
💀🔥
is it real?
I use to do that before every pro baseball game. It's called long toss
Whom ever posted this video doesnt watch, understand, listen, look, know sports in anyway.
No
I think that's a baseball...
So is it only cause he's on a football field cause I feel like it's only cause he's on a football field
Not a chance🤣
Y'all hating on him going to the NFL but he got an arm you can't lie
No he couldn’t do it with a football cause I can almost do this with a baseball
I can't tell Which one was more impressive the catch or the throw
I bet there’s helium
I😂😂😂😂 can do that
No
I’m more impressed he caught the ball with no glove from that far
Him:He need to be in the NFL  Me:They both do
Football nah
Both of them should be in the NFL
Nerf
Yea.. Nerf Football League
I don’t think so
Gotta have good blockers to do this, no blockers will be sacked for a safety?
That’s not a football btw and he would be good at baseball he can throw with hella power
It's a baseball......
He needs to play cricket Makes a goal in lacrosse
Wait that's a soccer ball
Damn
I could throw a base ball just like that
And its a 100 yard touchdown to davante adams raiders win
A mini football maybe.
What did he throw??
Actually both of em do for the throw and the catch
No, he can do it with a baseball tho..
That’s like a tennis ball or suin💀
Distance is one thing, but control is something completely different...
I played both baseball and football. Quarterback and pitcher, plus center field. It's way easier to throw a baseball than it is a football. He probably couldn't throw a football more than 30 years honestly. Put him in the MLB, not NFL.
Which one, thrower or receiver?
No
WHICH ONE???
He needs go home.lol
Damm this 👦 guy is 👍
No because he would be playing in it..
Ummmmm baseball
If he throws this far with a baseball he could probably throw for 30+yards  with a football no deeper than 40
Why would he go to the nfl? Its not a football hes throwing.
Who tf was that, that was around 110 yards right?
No they need to be in the nfl
Dam he needs to be in Ukrainian help take down helicopter Russian
Damn that’s a fuckin rocket kid
So that's only about 320 feet.. and a baseball...
I will never understand mass awe and wonder over some one playing with a ball in the grass. Especially when said person can easily be or often is,.. a worthless pile of shit in every other aspect of life. People need to think a little bigger when it comes to sports. We learned this sht b4 kindergarten. Running falling catching throwing woooooooooooo!!! Like it's a new thing every time.lolol
Witch one 🙉
Catch was just as impressive
That’s a baseball there’s a big difference 🤦🏼🤦🏼🤦🏼🤦🏼🤦🏼🤦🏼🤦🏼
No he needs to be in the MLB
Him throwing a football is probably a wobbly 30 yarder
Which was better the throw or catch 🤔
Which one that was a sick catch
Mans is Superman
Dumbest vid ever!!!!  It's not a football
Who the one who catched it or the one that threw the ball
There a package deal.
Which one?
Bro witch one the qb or the wr 😭
No sry. It was a little football. Bret farve can only throw 74 yards which is phenomenal.
NFL but it is a baseball 🤔
Needs to be in the NFL but QB
Which one
Too bad they only let people from college join the league… we would have more talent if we didn’t have so many rules…
Lol
They both  Do did you see that catch an through
He needs to be in the MLB😂
GUNSLINGA
He threw a rainbow. If he could get it just a tiny bit straighter it would like an mlb throw
He threw a baseball
That catch was more impressive
He needs to throw javelin
Wtaf is that!? Mans got a rubber limb or something
Too bad they throw footballs in the NFL. Why didn't you just title it , "He should be in the MLB"? Ya goof
Football so far!? Maybe he would be good javelin thrower
Which one?
Not  that impressive. One step an crow hop and throw that pop up to the plate scoring all day
Which one should?
Is that a baseball?
Surface area, air drag ?
The caption is so misleading thought it was a football but it’s a damn small hard baseball
Beluga
I used to could. With a base ball, but I'm old now. 👴🤣 I can tell I'm not in my 50's anymore.
He? You mean both of them right?!
I could do that with a baseball not that hard
Ok, but imagine him at the Daytona 500
That one-handed catch like it was a golf ball was just as impressive.
Both
More like pitcher
I could throw that far when i was 14. If you want some advice stop doing this now I can barely lift my arm above my head now.
way more to being a QB than throwing far!
Ask a pacific islander to throw
Wich one the guy who threw the ball the hole field or the guy who caught that fast ball with on hand
Why ? So he can get hit before he even throws the ball 😂
Give👺that🥶man🤨a map👹
I need to be a Nascar driver cause I know how to drive. Just saying
Wow
300-ft throw is a standard distance for long toss drills for a serious player. It shows good arm but nothing necessarily elite. Literally thousands upon thousands of outfielders who can do that.
No
Now show me that was a football
Impressive but he prolly only throwing a football 50-60 yards at most
No! I thought it was a football, then i see they caught it with a glove
Isn't that just 100 yards or 300 feet with a baseball... That's not impresive.
Which one
Baseball and football r different . He may only be able to throw a football 40 yards….maybe 🤷🏻‍♂️
Bro lmaoo
Somebody thinks it's a  football?
If it ain't out the park you better tag up...this dude lethal from anywhere in the park.
So he can read a defense? Call an audible? ACTUALLY BE ACCURATE lol no
You mean MLB
No
Much easier to throw a rock than a boulder.
Which one? and isn’t that a baseball?
Ahhh. Autism has entered the chat
Got dang
So what I could throw that shit in middle school.
Yea the throw was nice. But someone caught that shit 100 yds away 🤔
Can you throw that for under five seconds And at least a 200 pound man rushing 15mph are you  No
He can’t do that with a football
Holy sheet
ICBM
If real. This is awesome
THE ANSWER IS A RESOUNDING "NO"
Nah both if them
Baseball players make more money
Idk if should be impressed how he threw that far or how the other guy caught that
110yd dime
Baseball not a football two different things
Caption had me thinking he threw a football 😂 You do that with a football and author blank will still find a way to ruin it
Answer : yes
Why?! Cuz he threw a baseball 100 yards?! No he should not be in the NFL. It's impressive no doubt. If anything he should be playing in the MLB as am outfielder
That was a baseball
Catches the football  "He needs to be in the NFL"
Still an elite throw with a baseball. That distance is equivalent to a MLB fence to home plate, and he’s got accuracy
Which one
Baseball
He couldn’t do this with a football baseballs are a lot lighter and easier to throw
Witch one
This is average high school long toss
🤯
Fake
Hello fellow center fielder.
He needs to be in the UFC' Proceds to bowl a strike
No....the nfl doesn't use baseballs...
That’s a baseball not a football fool
Man replaced his arm with a cannon
It’s a baseball, like throwing a tiny rock as far as you can… not hard at all.
Badass. Man that was GREAT GREAT. There are NO WORDS. I HAVE never seen this.
😳
Forget the accuracy look how he threw the ball and it wasn't out of place
Turns out they don’t use baseballs in the NFL
I dont even know what was better, the throw or the catch
Baseballs are easy enough to throw that far, not footballs though..
Out fielder
Damn he better then tom brady
that’s not a football.     i’m joking: i’m american
Imagine that was a baby😂🤣
Yes
So uh, even if he was throwing a football. (Which is different than a baseball.) he’d need to show he could actually aim well. Like say they put a trash can on the other side of the field. He’d need to make in there 9/10 times. 👌🏻?
Dammmmmnnnnnnnnnnñ
Maybe he could just be an outfielder...  Tons of MLB teams that could use him 9th inning man in scoring position
which one the dude who threw 125 yards or the one who caught it
80% of high school baseball players can pretty much do this
This isn’t hard at all, just throw the baseball. I can do this easily. I did grow up playing baseball and I’m 23 now, but it’s still easy imo.
I think u mean MLB.
How about MLB ??  ⚾️
Is ge a amputee with a sling for an arm? Lol that was off the hook!
Not bad but he needs to get probably another 40 yards before he breaks any records.
Hey let’s get the Seahawks to pick him up!!!!! Even if it’s a baseball damn near every person in the comment wouldn’t be able to throw a baseball that far 😂
60 yards at most with a football
Could he throw a football 110 yards? Lmao.. no.. Brett Favre only threw 74 yards. I could make this throw in baseball when I was 13. Not really impressed.
I think he meant NHL
NBL 😂😂😂
We don’t do rainbows in baseball straight passes only😂
Little weighted baby ball
MLB?
Definitely not
Both of them need to be in the NFL
Bolth do
Signed to the browns 😂
if he needs to be in the nfl so does 99% of d1 baseball prospects
Negative
F=ma. Bigger mass, more force needed.
Holy shitballs...110yrds?
Is this real?
Trevor Bauer threw a ball about 300 feet over and mlb wall when he was passed for getting pulled
Yeah he just punted a three pointer!
Quick answer.....no
That’s a 145 gram baseball a football weighs about 400 grams so no he couldn’t do that with a football
No one gonna question how he caught the ball so easily?
For perspective, the farthest an NFL player could throw would be around 75 yards at most
Witch one
Patrick maholmes ??
Which one
He Couldn't do that With a "Football"! Yet that Was a Good throw!
Nnnnnnnnope
Yes if a football was the size of a baseball and was round like one
NFL what he through a baseball
To easy
Hold on did the guy catching it just catch it one handed now that's inpresibe
Patrick Mahomes with a baseball:
Aint no way tjat first try
Wow
Cappppp
Step on a hockey court  with a football and thro a 20 yrd pass and become a phenomenal hockey player 😎
bro
So it's a baseball
This guy would destroy people in dodge ball
Bruh it’s a baseball
He a robot
Should be an out fielder in mlb
Both of them
He needs to be in the mlb
Well ya, footballs are shaped the same as baseballs
Which one? “Both”
Tom Brady mid
I need the football pov
I just want to know what was them blue lights that went across
MLB maybe
A football is so much harder to throw due to air dynamics, weight, and size
Besides that dumb football comment that was pretty amazing. That guy has a hell of an arm on him and damn accurate
Why wouldn't you say he should played baseball since he just got done throwing a baseball really far WTF lol
He needs to go to the MLB
Runner advances 2 bases on that sac fly.
Let's see him do it off of a crow-hop, or from a backpedal on a more linear throw and I'll be impressed.  Many serious outfielders have this kind of range, the better ones can throw it on a line.
Is he talking about the 1 throwing or catching
Imagine if the guy dropped that dime of a pass
Im more impresed by that throw
Maybe if it was a football. And still no bcuz it takes more than having a string arm to play QB in the NFL. That is the 1% of the 1% that make it there. Some of the best QBs in history didn't have a strong arm and some of the worst busts have had only a strong arm
Im a good thrower but nothing compared to him lol 😂😂
Conveniently leaves the upper atmosphere before it returns who could have picked it up and thrown
Damn
No as the weight and air volume displacement are completely different.  What he would throw for speed or distance in baseball would be nearly cut in half  with football. Plus the arc of the throw .  If he threw it lower it more than likely would've gotten there faster and possibly further
Which one
MLB. Anyways, that’s a busted elbow.
😂😁
That's not a very big deal. That's like throwing from home plate to the left field fence. Any baseball player can do that.
No shot
He couldn’t throw a football 50 yards tho
I was like holy shit this man's insane, and then read the comments and realized it was a baseball XD
It's a baseball.. lol. 100 yards isn't amazing
Sounds like a Family Guy crowd
More like Baseball League😳
Nahh h should defo play baseball😅
110 yards with a baseball. He will probably throw a football 60 yards.
No One is giving credit to the guy who caught it
Greatest duos of all time os standing right in this video..
Mini rubber nerf ball?
A baseball n football are similar enough, "they're both balls"...
Maybe he should be a bowler. He could throw the bowling ball over hand.
*Shoulder has left the chat*
which one or both
Can’t imagine what He could do in left field ⚾️
Definition of wasted talent
Everyone please I ask that you spread the gospel today to your friends and family because they need to know about Jesus. I don't want to force religion if you don't believe in God then just leave this comment but I want to spread the gospel to everyone I can. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. 😁
300 ft with a baseball? Not impressive. We would through from center field to home at 395. Not even half the " arc ". Get an arm. Is this a joke?
@nfl
Bro is THE gunslinger
That would be very hard to do with a football my guy
Both of them need to be. Guy caught that ball with one hand when it was thrown like 110 yards away from him
Back in the day I could throw it over those mountains!
Now that's a damn throw.
“Have a few words with the CANNON” Wayne voice
Which one?
Owe.. I thought he threw a football … 😧 Still very impressive thou
Who
I which one
Who
Both of them u mean ball was going at like 90 mph at his head
Needs to be in the nfl. Is actually star quarterback at his school as well 😎😎
He needs go to the NFL asap
The camera man: how fake? The kid : yea
No he dosent
MLB not nfl if he can hit
Fuck the throw props to dude who caught the ball
U could easily do this baseball is alot different than a football
Can the Seahawks draft him🥺Anyone but Drew Lock pLeAsE
“He needs to be in the NFL” Balances my checkbook
Dangg
Bro the catch or the through
Baseball and football are two different balls no way he’d be able to do that with a football
What about the guy who one handed that catch
Them: he needs to be in the NFL! Me: Which one 🤨
Ummm yea so its a nerf ball...?
He needs to be in the NHL. *throws a javelin
If he learns how to throw a football correct then he can maybe throw it kind of close to that far
He hit a home run without the bat
I think she might wanna be a pitcher... imagine the speed on that ball
You know how many baseball players can do this?  A football is heavier and have different form and the throwing technique is very different.
I was gonna say "The one catching or throwing?" But then I realized footballs don't come in that shade
That’s a baseball bro. Maybe the MLB
Tha F**K👀🤯🤯🤯😳😆💯
Both need to be
No, football is not round, I find throwing football more difficult because you need to throw it right to go far and such more
He should stick with baseball
MLB I believe
Which one
the guy who caught it or threw it?
He just threw that rock down the field and buddy caught it one handed without moving like to see half of yall even attempt that 🤣🤣
Mahomes, Allen, stafford and Rodgers would boot this shit
Holy bazooka.
MLB
He basically just threw a javelin world record distance
Love all the oohs in the background
No way.
That is a baseball
d a n g
No wtf ? It's a baseball kinda different than a football
Mike trouts agent: hey mike I think we’re going to trade you for a guy in a white shirt and black shorts
What did He throw if it was not a football
We just gunna egnor that catch that would hurt my hand so bad
I need to be in NFL as well.. Ass I throw hockey pucks
Which one the 100 yard throw or the on hand catch?
Stupid ass titles lead to don’t recommend this channel smashes
Uncle Rico?
Which on the guy who threw 110 yards or the one that caught it with 1 hand 110 yards away. Wow is this real?
which one😭
Literally any outfielder should be able to do that
Football fusion💀
They changing the ball now?
Yea he does
Nobody mentioned the other guy. Great catch.
No i can throw a baseball farther than that but when it comes to a football dont ask me to throw further than 45 yards accurately
This isn’t really that crazy, it’s like abt a high 80s pull down
It's a baseball not a football.  Big difference
What ball
What ball is kt
I think he meant mlb cause that’s a baseball not a football
Baseballs and footballs have very different qualities so no he would only make like 68 yards
That's a really good throw and the NFL would love that but you also have to take in consideration that in the NFL people are going to be rushing him the whole line is going to be rushing him can he do that under pressure?
Maybe 50 yards with a football
That ball has helium in it 😳
Bro could definitely kick a basket in tennis
It’s a baseball tho
Too much air time for baseball watch ichiro throw bullets
He needs to be in the NHL!!🤣
Hell no
Literally only said nfl because it’s on a football field. Had it been on a baseball field it would have been a different caption.
Different throw style and if he hadn't let it go so high it wouldn't hav gone nearly as far
Which 1?
If he could do that with a football he wouldn’t be throwing a baseball
Nope
Dude just joined the avengers from that throw. 🤣🤣🤣
I can fing do that with a baseball lol
The wind helped him
Does anyone remember the mic vick powerade commercial when he threw the ball into the stands?
I think they misspelled MLB
Virgin arms are strong.
Or mlb because that’s a baseball
Nice throw didn't realize it was a baseball to begin with
That's still impressive
With accuracy tho
Ya but that's not a football
Bruh he would be better than Brady
Both need to
“He should be in the nhl”  Scores in rugby 🏉
No mlb
Is he not throwing a American football
“He needs to be in the nfl” Actually center field might be the fit for him
Probably not
He made me spill my coffee! holy shoot!!!!! Thats more than 100 YARDS OMG
Which one
Which one 😂
You mean the mlb
If that was a football he would have thrown 65 yards max
Which one
There are thousands of highschoolers and college baseball players than make this throw with less arc
No.
Maybe 60 yards with a football definitely not the full distance
No probably shouldn’t really be throwing a baseball either. The arc on that throw is way off of what is a normal ball path in regular baseball. I can tell from this range ( around 280 feet) that any normal high school ball player in the outfield should be doing this for warmups and not throwing at that high of an angle. Get your facts straight before you post something please
Wearing 80+ pound gear with coldness of 0 degress too 100 degrees under pressure too.. ok.
Yeah you don't think
Goat damn
Plot twist: its not a baseball it's his arm in the air.
Maybe MLB maybe
Both those people need to be in the NFL
Nah stick with baseball
He need to be in the mlb
We use to long toss baseball all the time over the length of a football field
He threw a baseball though. That means nothing.
Well the Steelers just got a QB opening maybe they will give him a shot 😂😂😂😂it’s never too soon lololol door dash comin in hot
I could do that with a baseball💀
Then his friend
Y'all do know that's josh Allen right 😂
Bruh I could throw a ball that far and I'm trash. I used to play long toss to the warning track before every game
Nice
Fuck no he couldnt. That 110 yards would go down to 60. My friend who played both sports, he could throw a baseball way over 100 yards but a football only 65
Bro that's a baseball I've thrown a baseball from the back of the track over the other fence I hate the internet lmao
100yrds=300ft🤓
Yall realize its extremely easy to long toss a baseball right its all form has nothing to do with size or strength.
Nope
I did that with a football.  The bleachers were roaring.
I hope they let him bring his baseball
Last time I checked NFL QBs throw with a football & rarely get a 10 ft running head start to throw off of.
Witch one I think both does
Pitcher and outfield life
Such io
I can do that with an baseball but not a fb do to grip n size.
U mean they
Must be a wet Nerf
just some long toss
A bit of high arch I would be more impressed if it came screaming down the sideline under 20 ft off the ground.‼️💯
bro threw a full football field and the other dude just one hands it like nothing
He needs to be a pro dog walker with his chances for football.
when they find out he is using a baby ball
Baseball
No one is gonna talk about the trow?
Nice edit
Thats crazy bro
That was a pretty good catch 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂
111 yard baseball throw
No
That’s like saying everyone that can long drive should be in the PGA. There’s a lot more to it.
Could’ve just said MLB
And 5, 300+lbs men running at him. Still, well done!
My lil cousin can throw a baseball 50 yards tho a football 20 so no he most likely cant
Bruh
Do it again but with an official size football, sweaty dude coming to knock you out and he’s running scared for his life
Does no one notice that the other guy just casually catches with one hand?
Both of him
You can through a baseball 2 as far as a football.
No he can’t I’m a qb and it’s way different
That’s a soccer ball dummy
You mean MLB
Both 😲😲😲
Nerf footballs fly much farther because they have tails.
Which one
Any normal dude should be able to throw a baseball that far
Yooooo
If that’s a baseball that’s not hard.
Doesn't mean he's accurate
No
That’s 360 feet
He needs to be in the NBA
Who the guy who through it or the guy that caught it
Well which one the quarterback or the one who caught it 🤷🏾‍♂️ he did one hand that bit huh 🤷🏾‍♂️js
Needs to be in mlb
Don't wanna sound like a keyboard warrior but I did this. Most high level high-school baseball players with a strong arm could make this throw.
Fake news
That’s not even a good throw in baseball. That’s the distance of an outfielder trying to throw someone out at home and there’s way too much arch on the ball for it to even be a good throw in baseball.
Flicks different
the only reason i suck at throwing a football is because i’m so use to playing baseball. baseballs weigh less than a football and it’s easy to throw to me
It would be so cool if he could do this with a football
If he could throw a golf ball that far he wouldn't need clubs to go golfing.
This a new sport??
wow its almost as if its a smaller ball
30 throws like this and he has tendinitis. Put him on the bench in basketball.
People are trippin.. mlb pitchers throw footballs 80 yards easy. Doesn’t mean they can be an NFL quarterback, but they can toss it
good
Excellent way to blow your arm/shoulder mainly out!!!
Naah He needs to be in javelin
I would do this with a baseball, but throw a nice dart to 65 yards. Could get to 72 to 76 yards with a higher arch but it sometimes would come out with a slight wobble.
This guy should clearly sign up for golf.....video states.
That us a baseball
He can probably only throw half the distance with a football
That’s a baseball
How far can he throw a javelin
Mike Trout once hit a ball at TopGolf over the net.   Mike Trout is not playing professional Bowling
Bet
No, it's a completely different sport...
The throw or catch?
Which one. The qb or the receiver lol
Patrick mahomes
HE AINT THROWIN NO PIG SKIN
Don't you mean the MLB, he's just playing a little long ball.
You mean the mlb
MLS material for sure!
No🤦🏾‍♂️
WTF ?
Fake.
Just because you can throw a ball don’t mean you can play in the NFL
He needs to be an outfielder in the MLB
He need to play in the NHL. He makes a layup
Not accurately
Which one
Wow “Talk about a Hail Mary
both should be especially the one who threw the ball he could be better than tom
Give him some grenades... he going to the frontline.
Wrong sport
Who should be in the NFL the guy catching it or the one throwing it
Oh wow a baseball, I used to do 70+ with a small football. Not impressed
“he needs to be in the “NFL” “notices he throws a baseball”
Ion a football hit different
That's a dog ball thrower
if it was on a line it would be a better throw but still great long ball
I can do that too not with a football
When the happens
No...baseball......probably pitching...because a good arm don't mean you can hit worth a damn.
No he needs to be in mlb smh
Wow that far w a basketball that's frickin amazing
As someone who has thrown both no
Tom Brady not again
Lol these comments are so funny but true
We did this all the time nothing cool
111 YARDS 😁🤑🤑🤑🤑
Which one
WHAT THE ACTUAL FRICK honestly thats a far throw for any ball
He needs to be in the MLB not the NFL
No way he could do that with a football... much heavier
That's a baseball and he threw that up I'm 12 and I could throw that far throwing it up and what in the world makes u think he could be in the nfl with a baseball
Thats a baseball
Looks like maybe 325 ft..
Someone should take him for the NFL with an arm like that
Why he need to be in the nfl if he’s throwing a baseball
I’m not liking this video because of the video but because of the comments
Trevor Bauer does this," When he ain't spankin & ounchin women.
Everybody talking about the guy who threw it how about the guy who caught it
Well either way that’s back center field wall to home plate on a dime… dude should go to the MLB
I don’t think they know that every sport has a majors league
Are footballs that hard to come by to see how far he could throw one....???
That’s a fucking baseball
Everybody dislike this video so we can stop being annoyed by the poor knowledge of sports.
I guess he can throw good a javelin
that’s a baseball not a football smh😑
That's a baseball you dimwits
The next Brett Favre
One of the humans best traits at display
It's a strong arm, for sure. But the NFL needs passers with good timing and ACCURACY.
Most mlb baseball right fielders could thow it FARTHER. I KNOW ROBERTO CLEMENTE COULD HAVE EASILY.
No
Its only one throw if he had to do this repeatedly its not possible
He needs to be in MLB.
He couldn’t even throw a football 50 yards. So comparing a baseball and a football is the dumbest Shi i ever heard
🚀 launcher built on his shoulder....!!!
If you have to ask that then your not the sharpest tool in the shed
Yeah right try that crap when you got five or six guys coming at you good luck
That’s nothing. I stood at home plate and threw it over the fence multiple times. He threw 300 feet. I was throwing 350
There's nothing special with blowing your shoulder out for a video
That’s cool and all but could he throw it over a mountain
He needs to play disc golf
Lmao I hope they know the difference between a small baseball and a football about the size of both hands.
Wtf?
He throw football 50yards..maybe
Staged in the beginning it had a different  trajectory.....
Outfielder yes ...
Rare footage of uncle Rico throwing the pigskin ...
He won't have a shoulder when hes 55
😂 No Chance! They don’t use baseballs in the NFL.
He needs to be OUT FIELDER
A throw 1000 RPM at a velocity of 80 MPH at a 30 degree angle equates to a 100 yard throw. In case you were wondering if this is as impressive as it seems to the untrained eye.
That's insane
Nope
If he could, he would have.
Phenomenal arm!
thought he was finna be on the other end to catch it
"he needs to be in the NBA!" *Makes a goal in soccer
What one daddy
It looks like a softball and the angle is too high. It would have been more impressive if it was a laser beam.
Which one??!
Apparently every baseball player could be in the nfl
Me and my friend used to warm up before baseball games by going to the fence and throwing it back and forth to the box
I can do that and I'm 55 yrs old
Big difference throwing a baseball 100 yards n football 100 yards  he'll of n arm tho
Better than communist capernick
Better then communist capernick.
I’d put money that any NFL QB could do that with a baseball..
The raiders should draft him in the first round, first overall pick over all,, and give him blank tapes to study
Answer is… no. This is common in baseball.
Why play NFL for 3-4 years? He needs to continue to play baseball MLB for 6-10 years!
No 40 yards shorter with a football.
LMFAO a baseball.
I’m like there’s no way he isn’t in the NFL if he’s actually throwing a football that distance but... it’s a baseball
He isn’t throwing anyone out from centerfield with an arch like that in his throw
It’s not even a wildly impressive baseball throw… Any mlb center/right fielder could throw that far with a quarter of the height.
It's a baseball not that impressive,  do it with a football.
No...  Good throw tho
"he needs to be in the nfl". *Throws a baseball.
The difference between benching 150lbs and 450lbs... Lmao!!
Maybe not football but definitely an outfielder for a major league baseball team but the real question is can he catch a baseball
No...but still impressive.
Shits easy. It's a baseball.
this guy needs to be in the MLB!
No..
Probably a nerf football which alot of people could do that
Great outfield arms aim for 350 feet, this is 330ft
If he could do it with a football, this video would be showing that.......smfh
Solid 112 yards
Lol nfl my ass. Dood should be mlb outfielder if anything. Get payed and not get rocked every Sunday lmao. Baseball usually way longer career. Anyone half smart knows that.
People are so stupid
That was a golf ball 😂
Guys can throw a baseball liken this all day long. That’s not that impressive. What 330 ft. I have seen high school kids throw it out from home plate that distance all day.
I could throw a baseball far. Football I aint reaching past 55 yards.
Holy kamoly Angelina Jolie! Fabricated perhaps?
WHAT!     This doesn’t even mean he should be a baseball field.
I’ve seen plenty of quarterbacks throw a football 70-80 yards and they can’t play. This means nothing. It doesn’t even mean he should be on a baseball field.
More like mlb
I bet I could throw maybe 10-15 yards further
i used to do that.. torn rotator cuff not fixed ruined that 😢🤦🏻‍♂️
🐂 💩
That ain’t even a football.
If only it was a football 😂😂
That's just like him throwing a football and somebody says he needs to be in the MLB 😂😂🤣🤣😂🤦🏾‍♂️
It's a baseball though 🤦🏾‍♂️
That dude got a rocket arm on him
Probably not or he would be playing football
I can do that
Is this slavery 🕵🏻‍♂️
No??
*they* because did you see him one hand catch that from 100 yards
Tf is that a golf ball?
I throw a baseball 80 yards without training. "Can he do that with a football?" Give me a fucking break
I was a low level college pitcher and could do better than this.. Profesional can throw nearly 400+ feet with 20ft less of arch on that throw
Well.... it's a baseball
Throwing a baseball that far ain't that hard
Ni
Fake
No maybe he needs to be in bed cuz he prolly had class tomorrow.
The answer is no bruh baseball has less friction in the air so it’s going to go farther
This is a damn baseball he couldn't throw a football half that far
Still That’s an impressive throw…
amazing
No couldn't do this with a football. But definitely a baseball
I’m 37 and haven’t played baseball in 15 years and I can still throw a baseball 100 yards , this is not hard
Not a football
Nope, but most guys that play baseball can do this, with a baseball, like this guy did.
“MLB“
Or learn to throw the javelin
Because…there are people out in the world that runs faster then some receivers but can’t catch. You think Usain bolt would be good at football? Not in the NFL.
Half breed
Fake
THROWIBG OUT HIS ARM
Send it
No he couldn’t
He's got a "Bo" Jackson Arm!
This truly is the field of dreams, where footballs are shaped like baseballs. 🤯
That’s a baseball lmfao!  College level outfielders make that throw all the time.
Smh ! Ok bro !
Lmao
I can do this and I’m 45 😂
Everyone saying play baseball and technically that’s not a good baseball toss either.. you want a line! We call this a rainbow. Would be more impressed if he zipped it to the guys numbers. Dudes got an arm tho for sure!
No. Stupid question
This is common amongst baseball players
Outfielder not nfl
Thats not a football
It's not a football!!!!
That’s a baseball…
Yes all it takes is to be able to throw any ball a full football fields length to play in the nfl. Who cares about accuracy, reading defenses, footwork, avoiding tacklers and all done within 4s. Lol what a joke...
I think you mean possible MLB
Lmao baseball and football WAYYY different
This guy needs to be in the soccer league for sure..
No ... MLB.
It's not hard to throw a rainbow with a baseball
My guy thats a baseball, and in terms of the throw-ability of a baseball, that was incredibly average
That was a baseball
Easier to do than you’d think. Most D3 college players and skilled High School players can do that
Who the one who catches it or throws it I think both
Only person hyping this is a chick
Baseball
Fake as Heck!
I’m still waiting on the ball to come down. Game is over and all the runners scored 😆
"HE NEEDS TO BE IN THE NFL" * Throws a baseball *
Don’t post cool videos with stupid titles/questions
MLB, you mean?
That’s a baseball 🤣
"Could he do this with a football?" No it's different with a football
That’s not hard to do lol
NFL? That's not a football and he's not going throwing baseball's
What he throw
Well a football is much more difficult to throw the size abs shape a lone not mention there's plenty of guys that can throw it's being accurate that counts
Thats just a ball and no dont put him.in the NFL...im not hating.....he just cn stick with baseball
No. No, he could not. Stupid question. I expect better.
My man forgot to hit the cutoff and threw a rainbow 🥱
No he couldn’t a football is different than a baseball
The Kid that threw it had arm, but the guy that bought it had CLASS!.
he needs to be a centerfielder in the MLB.
Ya ok
*Grabs the football bat
If he threw it on a line that would be amazing it’s still cool though
You think that's impressive? Now let a quarterback throw that baseball.
is incredible and unreal
I can still make that throw at 43 and can still only throw a football 60 65 yards..throwing far is easy..throwing far with velocity and a quick throwing motion is much more difficult
Stupid post
When you add helium to a football makes it later and you can throw it further
IDIOVIDEO!!! He's throwing a baseball....drrrrrrrrr🙄
NHL no Nascar yeah Nascar
While impressive you gotta be kidding me a football is a totally different ball game. Lighter object and much wider grip.
Correction: he should be in the mlb The Braves will take him  🤣
Nope!!!!!
What a great basketball player he’d be
Reads video title. Watches video. Response to the title is no.
Bruh this shit ain’t impressive
Probably a nurf ball 😅
I get that it’s a baseball but that’s still a long way to throw a baseball
Someome sign this man b4 its too late
not trying to be that guy but with a baseball this distance really isn’t crazy when I was in high school this was a pretty standard distance for pitchers or i guess anyone with a plus arm. but we certainly didn’t use that much arc lol  this guy is just stretching his arm out.
I didn’t know they used baseballs in the NFL
There’s gotta be helium in that ball
Stupid people! He needs to be in the NHL!!!!
In addition to the baseball, consider the size difference of a college and NFL ball
Pshhh get me one of those old school nerf whistler football's and I'll Uncle Rico that thing!
Good arm for a baseball but football? nah bro
Lol roadrunner gon have to catch the shit
nice video
Is that David Klingler?
That is what is called a "Hail Mary" throw. From one endzone to the other. The chance it can be intercepted though is increased.
He needs to be in nfl  Wait a minute isn't that a baseball.....🤨🤔😐😑
It’s a baseball, I could probably do that.
This guy need to try swimming
No! He needs to be in the army.  Could you imagine throwing a grenade so far tgat it explodes as soon as it lands?
Nfl rule change.  QBs can now elect to use a baseball for hail Mary plays
Lost footage of uncle Rico
They throw baseballs in the NFL?
He airmailed the crap out of that ball
Smooth brain video
No !!!
Bro it’s a baseball he could prolly not throw a football bc it’s so different, especially in hand movements and spiral of the ball
No a football spins completely differently than a baseball and it is heavier  Also that throw isn’t really that impressive  Everyone on my high school baseball team can do that
What an arm. That's MLB caliber
He could be a professional golfer
Is this real?
People out here being salty while this video gets 100k likes 😂
There’s a big difference in throwing a baseball and throwing a football. And being a quarterback takes brain too not just a cannon.
If he could do this with a football he’s gonna put a bunch of quarterbacks out of business
We call all assume a woman posted and captioned this… 😂
Pep
I THREW A BALL FARTHER THAN THAT.
I used to be able to throw a baseball 90mph and wasn't able to throw a football over 80-90 yards. No way could he throw a football as far
No
Vortex
Threw a rubber bouncy ball? Lmao im done
No
That's a baseball.  That's a simple 110 yard throw. He out one hell of a rainbow arch on it. Needs to be on a rope. He must be a freshman. Any upperclass centerfielder or catcher can do this.
Not a football. Look at the catch.
OP is a f****** r*****
Lol wtf no
his arm hurts, know that feeling
U mean baseball
I didn’t even play varsity in high school and I made this throw every day in warmups, any decent baseball player can do that especially with the run up he had
Maybe left or center field but not quarterback
Why not the mlb
He’s throwing a baseball like bro that ain’t even that hard
JaMarcus Russell could throw it 70 yards from his knees.  Did that translate to success in the NFL? 😉
Why would he be in the NFL versus the MLB
No!
Nope
Is this video an April fools joke or are you dumb lol   Basically like watching someone take a slapshot in hockey and say can he play PGA?  🤪
This is a slightly above average baseball throw for high schoolers
Captions just get dumber and dumber 😂👏
anyone could literally do that a baseballs tiny and easy asf to throw far
I used to watch Dave Winfield warm up with a football with his back to the wall right field yankee stadium, and throw beyond the plate. Well over 100 yards. Perfect spirals, too.
I could do the same thing in high school and college, but I couldn’t throw a football pass the 55 yard line.  It’s a whole different grip to the ball.
Heck NO with a football
Baseball ⚾️ that's not hard
Zeke be like
No he’s most likely an outfielder
Y he throw eg 🥚
That's not such a great feat most decent out fielders throw that far on a rope
He threw that 321 feet. Standard outfielder arm...
Switch one..
Any one with some sort of athletic ability could throw a base ball like that
It’s a baseball…
WOW, NOW THATS TALENT!!!
More like needs to be in mlb
Lemme think....Ummm.. NO!!!
mlb you mean?
No
That’s a baseball, they don’t use those in the NFL
I remember the vortex
But can he read defense?
Damn that's some Bo Jackson type stuff. Talent recognizes talent and you haters are talking out of your shoulder popping asses.
Using a 5 year olds football…🙄
Everyday my faith in humanity just falls shorter and shorter
I said "Holy Shit" in conjuction with those in the video.. nice arm!
Nice arm, beautiful throw. Football he may be able to throw 50-60yds respectfully. I've played football and baseball. Football I was a QB and baseball I was center fielder. Playing that CF position when I was throwing the ball I tried to minimize the amount of air under the ball which would get the ball where it needed to be faster. But then again nice throw lol
As a baseball player he intact does not need to be in the nfl
Hell No.
That's a baseball..
Lololol i can throw a baseball 100 yds easily. Small dense rock basically. Nfl sized football is so big and full of air. I can only throw it 35 yds....
A truly gifted arm could make that throw on a line and not like a fly ball
Pitchers in the mlb can do that without throwing it 100ft in the air
That was Uncle Rico before his prime.
Not a bad throw… looked like about 110 yards to me. Plenty of cricketers can throw a very slightly heavier ball that far and the record is 145 yards ! Unfortunately no-one from Les Etats Unis knows what that great game is.
Nerf or nothing
This isn't impressive at all most people past high school ball can hit a straight line on the diagonal across the field. This is a not a good example of long toss he arched it all the way in.
If y’all remember Alex tanney, one of the best trick shot quarterbacks to do it, mad accurate, never made anything of himself. Sad
It not even that impressive with a baseball
You are not going to throw a football like that. Hell wrong with folks
No he couldn’t with a football but he obviously has an arm
Yeah because you always see qbs in the nfl have enough time to run foward 10 feet to wind up their arm. Not impressed
It’s easier to throw baseball far than a football
Thing is that wasent a real football, I can throw a baseball farther then a grapefruit
Correction: He needs to be in the MLB
I’d be more impressed if he could have caught it too but that was a fuckin sweet throw tho nice spiral
Yeah can toss it 100 yards.. but not before the runner got to 3rd. Lol it’s pointless to be able to throw this far if it’s not on a line. Just saying. Best I’ve seen was 80 yards on a rope.
I could throw that easily now try it with. Football
He thru a baseball...... Not even close to the same. Although I'll give it to him for the lift the baseball had, he might actually be able to do this with a football
I could do that with a baseball to lmao
NFL recruiter: we need to get this guy NFL manager: why?  NFL recruiter: he can really fling a frisbee  NFL manager: your fired!
🤣
Not impressed throw a line drive not a lop
Is that a real football?
MLB man not nfl
No chance it’s 400 feet he’s throwing that ball in the air. He wouldn’t do that in  a baseball game you have to keep it low to hold or get runner. Max on a football seems to be about 80 yards and that’s a freak does that, Dan Marino, sonny Jorgenson could throw 50 yards behind his back.
That’s probably the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard can he do this with a football 🤦‍♂️🤡
Good throw, but that wasn't a football.
Thats easy to do with a baseball
I can do that
That's not even a football and even if it was he would only be able to throw 60 ft probably
Um so I play baseball I’m a senior and been on var since freshman year and I could do this it’s not that crazy if you actually play long toss for a long time but I’m also a pitcher who throws 85-90
Man I can almost throw that baseball like 2 fields 😂
I thought it was a football but I was like oh it's a baseball I could do that
No
Brady who?
That's a baseball. Good luck throwing a football like that. A baseball is heavier, smaller and doesn't catch the wind as much so its way easier to throw far if you have a good arm. A football is bigger and you can't get your hand all the way around it so it takes way more force to throw far away accurately
No
Simple answer...NO
My whole arm detached from my body watching this
The next Michael Phelps in the making… 😂
UH NO!
Most center fielders can throw from the out field to cut off a runner at home plate. Kirby Puckett Willie Mays Mike Trout have all thrown a ball 445ft. That’s 115ft past a football field. Let that sink in. This dude would be a good ball boy throwing foul balls back to the ump from the third base line.
Lol. Firstly,  he moon balled it. So it's not even impressive from a baseball standpoint.  They want long, accurate,  line drives even from center field to home plate, secondly,  throwing a baseball kinds far, does not mean, in any way shape or form,  that you could throw a football accurately, or long distance,  while being Chased down by 200-300 lb men. Lol. So nice try bud, maybe start with pee wee. Or powder puff.
Definitely could not do that with football
That’s a baseball clowns 🤡 lmao 🤣
This guy threw a baseball 300 feet still really impressive don’t know manymlb players who can do that
I can piss the same height after beer pong.
Yes he does. I'm muscled up, 230, 9% body fat, and played major starting positions......and this guy has trained and deserves major play time, aka gftil (game face time in the light) *(light=limelight)
He should try soccer
Anything thrown at 45° will give you it’s maximum distance with the force that you put into it, it’s physics
You do realize thats only 300 ft right?
Lol. All the fans of this putz hate blacks people and especially hate Colin kaepernick
which one they both talented
Bet his arm is gonna have issues
Bro it could be one of those nerf balls like from the 90s lmao, at 7 I could do this with those lmfao
Do you not know sports at all?? Throwing a baseball 300 feet really is not that incredible of a feat at all
No,?Play baseball
Don't worry Jerry .J will call....
He needs to be in the Marines Who needs a rocket launcher with this boys arm
Bruh threw a baseball and they said he should be in the NFL. I have no comparison cuz I’m high AF so feel free to fill it in there
Not he needs to be he's gonna be if any coaches see this
He wouldn't even make my old high-school baseball team with that much arc.. Smh
This ain’t that big a deal! I made that same throw but on a line! In college!
Why?
Bro that’s a baseball 🤦‍♂️
Change the title to
Holy fucking shit dude I thought I had an arm someone give me the name of this man
WHAT THE FUCK WHO IS THIS MAN
Wtf! Lol I couldn't get even 15yrds
MLB more like it
Well, an accurate 360ft throw is good enough to be in the MLB
Lol throws a baseball and now he should be in the nfl? Can tell you have never played football
My self have also done this, but nice toss indeed.
Thats a baseball 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Which one ?
Baseball or not that was a cannon
The reason you all are not appreciated this is he ran over to the other side while changing his clothes just to catch the ball himself.
Or maybe...the MLB...lol
Wtf 😬
Now you need a WR that runs a 40 in 1.50seconds
MLB maybe but no one can throw a football that far. Domt ask stupid questions stupid af
Throwing like that he need to be a professional golfer
Goddamn wtf he got a robotic arm with unlimited power or what 💀💀
**backflip kicks soccer ball into goal** "HE NEEDS TO BE ON A HOCKEY TEAM 🤯🤯🤯"
Thats 345 feet. Over 5 seconds hangtime. Centerfield is the only position in any sport this is useful.
What a joke it's a baseball, you want to impress do with a football.
Uncle Rico??
Would have been even better if he ran down to end of the field and caught his own pass. Then I’d be impressed
Nothing like a football lmao
Nerf
Footballs a little different I doubt it's going the distance
It’s a baseball
No
Who?
Das a mudda baseball ⚾️
No, he needs to be in baseball.
Lol throwing a baseball is a lot easier than a football. Trust me he ain’t throwing that far in the nfl lmfao. I’d give him 40yds max
No..... or it would be a...... football
And it def dont correlate to a football.  Mechanics are super different and u finesse a football. The baseball rolls off your fingers and ur wrist motion is a 90 degree snap attge top of a window where your palm facing forward on the direction of the toss. Where a football requires a break and window but it's a finessed flick of the wrist with ur palm facing ur head. And an award flip of the wrist. And the motion of the spin matters on both but in total different ways. And a far pass on football isbt ur same motion as ur 10 yard dump, as far as it's shorter, but it's an extension of the finesse meaning the savy part of the way u flickur wrist is exactly the same just bigger I'm windowmaby opened up chest. Which makes it allot harder to transfer accurate throws long range cuz that spin of tge football is what makes it cut thru the air. Same as a baseball but shapes different so either way transitionin between the two kinds hard. But I had pretty goodqb who started varsity baseball as a freshman and also started varsity football as a QB as a sophomore. And won our league but lost in states
Baseball
See, now throw a fkng spear that far into a herd of kangaroo or buffalo and you'll understand our ancestors a little better.
MLB*
No, it's only a baseball.but thinking about it. That's 330-360 feet, so he got a hose. But I used to be able to throw a softballand s baseball over every distance marker at almost every field I played on. Think the furthest I was able to was like 385. I know we had one that was a rectangle with like 416 in center and I'd fucking tryallthe time and never could do it. But he prolly could do the same thing. If he tried. Most likely he's a pitcher due to the height cuz he does long toss to increase arm strength. Or like me, he's a catcher who always warmed up with the pitchers daily so I had a pretty bad ass long toss as well. A few outfielders have hoses like this but 1 put of every 4-6. Cuz u usually got a sober piss of an arm on right field. Hope and pray for a decent one on center but my boy could track a ball down a mile away but he wasn't throwing nobody tagging hole or taking two on a baseknock. And then usually got a strpng arm in left field to pick down behind big rounds on two, hopefully hitto him with man o first so if he goes 3 u got a shot. And then man on second or third I only want the ball hit to left field if it's on the aircohe can hop skip and toss him out and the plate while I get my skull attempted to be cracked in. But I played football my whole life so I wouldn't ever tag u wit my glove. I was down low on one knee ready to press up with my other foot and throw every bit of my shoulder into ur solar plex orur Adams apple.  But as for a football. Back in 82, I could throw a football a damn near quarter mile. Matter fact, I could throw pnw over them there mountains
I can do this. Not impressed.
WOW... fucken impressive dude
That’s a baseball any grown man with strength could do the same, and don’t comment I couldn’t do that and embarrass yourself
Imagine he dropped it
Which one
He needs to be in the javelin throw competitions
I don’t know who should be in the NFL the dude who threw the ball or the dude that caught it with 1 hand.
Well you obviously cant throw a football as far as a baseball
Needs to be IN The NFL cause he can throw a ball …? Yeahhh oooookk
its a baseball ⚾️.  and his throw takes longer than a straight, low throw would 😏
NBL TYPING…
300ft not impressive unless you throw on a line  - ex college pitcher
Not even real football ⚽️ but hes good at fake football
That’s a damn baseball fools
Man has a fucking cannon
Probably not since a football doesn’t have the same weight to it
Which one?
This kid never listened when coach said a rainbow isn't a good throw. Line drive that MF and then I'm impressed. I can rainbow a ball 350+ feet man come on.
It’s a baseball
Man has a better arm than Patrick Mahomes
That was a hell of a LOB Couldn't have got it on a line? For those who actually played baseball.
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
All high school football coaches be like "YOU PLAY FOOTBALL NOW"
Does he also hit golf balls to prove he's an MLB 1at round pick?
Ah yes, the infamous arm punt
Yes if the NFL allowed a 10 yard run before throwing
That’s not impressive one bit
That’s a baseball it’s way easier to throw than a football
Never has a quarterback had that time for the set up
“He needs to be in the NFL” you don’t get  20 feet of room to run forward to throw a baseball in the NFL
That’s a baseball ⚾️
I know it ain't a football but for some one to be able to throw something across a whole NFL pitch Is Impressive
How the fuck
This is crazy the dude that caught it didnt even have to move to get under the ball like how
*Kid gets 1st place in 100 meter dash This youtuber:This guy should become a professional swimmer
Absolutely not
He definitely couldn't do the same with a football
Wrong ball
The guy that caught that right?
I think the premise is that he’s in baseball and SHOULD be doing football, not that the football would go that far
Nobody watches the NFL
Bro everybody in the comments lying like shit saying they can do this 🤣
Its a baseball….. lots of people can do that
I can do that too with less arc. Football is a lot harder to throw with distance. Takes technique as much as brute strength
See this mountain over there. I bet you I can throw over that. 🤭
Dude it's a damn baseball or something.not collage or NFL football
Correction: He should be in the MLB
NFL? Nah. Did you see how far he threw that?? That man needs to be in the NHL for sure.
Short answer no lmao I can throw a baseball fat asf I can’t throw a football for shit just not as easy lmao
Nah it's obvious he should be an MMA fighter.
Maybe if he was 6"6 250 with huge hands he could throw 90 yards in air
It’s a baseball lol
Yes I did but that a k2 football it’s easier
Put that man in the NFL asap! He can catch anything, that was incredible.
Fake.
Can i get my 10 seconds back?
Well I can say this he definitely has a great throwing arm 👍👍👍
Hell NO!!!
It's a baseball?? Lol..wtf
It's a baseball... Should be able to throw a rope at 300ft
Throws baseball* THIS GUY NEEDS TO BE IN THE NFL
He? I think both
Which guy?  The guy who threw over 100 yards?  or the guy catching it with one hand?  😂
There’s a big difference between throwing a baseball and a football. And no the football isn’t easier.
*Throws a baseball "You should play football"
Ma ma ma major league golf
I believe the word you're looking for is "mlb"
Fake
I know great catch
Tye average mlb outfielder could make this throw with way less arc
Thats really darn accurate even if it isnt a football
Put it this way I could throw a baseball from the warning track to home on a rope…I throw I football MAYBE 35 yards😂😂 straight duck
Bring his friend to the NFL also, cause it looks like he caught that catch with one hand 😳
No the power is transferred a lot differently in a baseball than a football he might have a good arm in baseball but football is a different story, he wouldn’t be any better than a normal quarterback.
Throwing a baseball and a football 100 yards two completely different ass things lol
I threw further than that at 20yo. It was out of a field the size of Fenway
Baseketball 🤔 🤣🤣🤣🤣 90s live on!!
Not even a football😂💀
NFL? More like the MLB!!!
Yeah he needs to be in the NFL for throwing a baseball😑
Maybe if they used baseballs in nfl? He’d have a chance 🤨
Or he could join the military and throw grenades
Totally not fake
not to brag but being an outfielder who’s thrown 315-320 feet DAMN
Dumbest video title I’ve ever seen
Im just saying that catch 🤧
Its a baseball. 99% of 5 year olds could do that.
In highschool I used to put my right knee on home plate and throw the ball over the left field fence 310' away. This is just a simple aired out long toss.
Hows his shot put, discus, and javelin? That was an impressive yeet
NO
that's pure bull
I was like holy fuck but then I realised it was a baseball
When i was in high school i watched two guys from our baseball team play catch like this. It was really impressive, but i would guess it’s probably standard for most college level players.
It was probably a Nerf ball of some kind. Now those fuckers you can throw  far as hell!
Yeah throwing a baseball and throwing a football are two incredibly different things, dude can't replicate that with a football.
A 100yd lob with a baseball is really not impressive lol
I can throw farther than that... and I can't throw a football worth a damn lmao
Helium ball
Everyone is complimenting the throw, but I’m just here thinking it was bad because it took so long that anyone would be safe by a mile.
That was ova 100 yards he jus threw n he not playing NFL cuz y?
Dumb video
That was impressive but I have seen people throw a baseball that far on a rope with less effort now if this was a football throw definitely be more impressed.
No …. Fuck no
That’s a really white football…
One good arm.. that's for sure
Both need to be in the NFL
No and that guy isn't special if he's playing catch with a guy who is throwing the ball back to him lol
**kid throws football** That guy: "He should play golf!"
Stupid shit right here dudes and dudettes
how to get into harvard
Can you do with the football? Can you do it while being under pressure every single play, can you do it with 300 lb man coming for his head every snap and could he still accurately deliver that ball.  I think not .
Baseball is the hardest sport to play no cap
I would long toss like this sometimes before pitching a game. I threw 90. I can’t throw a football anywhere near as hard or as far lmao
Bro that’s a baseball sped
That nerf ball amazing
🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Baseball or not... that's a good throw
He needs to be in nfl.......im like which one? Dude threw far yet the other one handed caught that lil weight flying fast
Good ol long toss.
No, he is not going to do that with a football. Nice throw though. But anyone that ever played QB knows your arm strength is just part of the skill needed to play the position.
Absolutely not
FACT:: IF THIS WHERE A BLACK DUDE EVERYONE IN THIS COMMENT SECTION WOULD SAY "" HELL YEAH HE COULD "" NOT OUT OF TRUTH,, BUT OUTTA A HIDDEN BUILT IN FEAR AS A WHITE WEAK TARGET!!  PROMISE YOU IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT COMMENTARY..... POLITICAL CORRECTNESS NONSENSICAL BULLSHITTERS,, "" SURE!!! GOLLY B* JOLLY,,THAT BLACK MAN CAN DO ANYTHING EVERYBODY!! , IF HE CANT *!,  WELL,, WE WILL JUST GIVE IT TO HIM!!!!HOW BOUT THAT FOR A THE LITTLE WHITE BETA TARGETS OUT HERE,, (* GENERALLY SPEAKING  *)
I can do that
Pov: this the dude that hits you with a dodge ball in the face
Considering a baseball is much smaller and fits into an average hand much better than a football, I’m gonna go ahead and say this video means nothing.
That's not that hard for any that know how to throw
Bro do y’all understand how much easier it is to throw a baseball instead of a football?🧐
Of course it’s a baseball no one could do that with a football
Yeah right He ShOulD tOtTaLlY bE iN tHe NFL cUaSe He ThReW a BaSeBalL fAr.  Like bruh 🤦‍♂️ you can get an average person to do that
My son is a junior in high school and he can do that
I could throw a baseball from dead center to home plate, no hop no steps, in HS... I couldn't throw a football half as far.
Which one ?
Too much air. More on a line. I could do this with a baseball all day too.
Lol it’s not that hard
Baby clemente
Used to do that when i was 13 but to brag mine was way straighter with less height
Me - Tosses a ball across the room and is sore for a week!
No he belongs in nhl
What a throwww
No he doesn’t this has absolute nun to do with football to different sports just cus he can do it with a baseball dint mean he can with a football
Perfect Spiral. Lol.
Dude…I felt my elbow snap from that. That’s like catching a ball middle center field and then sending it home. Holy shit.
Simply NO!
Sweet throw not with a football though I think it was warren moon that came the closest from the opposite side of the field he was throwing to. But it’s not impossible
That was a fucking baseball
MLB*
No
8th grade i could throw 100
John 3:16. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life
Anybody else confused as to whether we’re talking about the guy who threw it or the guy who caught in with one hand?
I'm pretty sure the guy was referring to the accuracy and not the actual ball that was thrown or how far it went.. That being said a football is definitely going to fly different than a baseball
Why can’t it be the mlb?
Next: Can he do this with a basketball
Before social media, back in '89ish, threw a baseball from one endzone through the goal post of the opposite endzone... 3 witnesses👍 Throwing a football=55 yards max.
Fuck no.  What a stupid statement and question.
BS
One strong arm 🧐
“He needs to be in the NFL”throws baseball
Sign this man up, all time quarterback.
This is very stupid.
Whitch one
Throwing a baseball and football are to completely diffirent worlds
Shii which one
I didn’t know they threw baseballs in the NFL
No way he could do this with a football
i instinctively said "god damn!" out loud 💀
Grass fairy
Just cuz he can throw a baseball across a field far has nothing to do with being in the nfl lmao
Do it flat footed like the howitzer cannon Bo Jackson
MLB players can throw it from the warning track to home plate. That that way longer than a football field.
MLB
Blown shoulder...
This title is so dumb....really dumb
So should I be in the NFL also?
No
He needs to try disc golf!
Fake
No. I can throw a baseball over 100m but can’t throw a football more than 30 lmao
300 Feet? 👣 📏🤷🏽‍♂️  330 Feet? 👣📏🤷🏽‍♂️  360 Feet? 👣📏🤷🏽‍♂️
If you can throw a baseball the length of a football field, that means you can throw the ball over 90 mph.
That’s only around a 100 feet less than the world record
I wonder if Tom Brady can throw that high & far in the air 🤔
Which one the thrower or catcher dam ice cold ❄️
That's not a football. I'm assuming it's a Nerf ball with the whistles removed
Witch one
I can throw a pebble three times as far. Should I be in the nfl? Naa
Lol that's a baseball dude
FUCK NO..... for the one in the back
Bro wdym the NFL Get this man in the MLB
Literally just playing long toss with a baseball
Is that Uncle Rico?
A 10 yr old with the right wrist motion could do this
Nah it’s a baseball brother
This isn't impressive at all. That was a rainbow 🌈.
NFL has been taken over by scum.... He doesnt need that nightmare.. He needs tk be security at walmart
“JACKPOT”
Fuck the NFL but that man in the MLB! Best defensive (haven't seen him hit so I ain't gonna assume anything) outfielder to ever play
I highly doubt some could throw a football that far. I would have to see it to believe it moments
No way that’s a full size football
*Idk rather that’s a good quarterback or a Handy Wide Out😂*
Throws baseball “ this guy needs to be in the NFL!” Why not NBA?
Dead Center 410 feet, myself and a couple buddies from baseball used to one hop that in to home on a lower trajectory.. 300 feet is impressive if he is in middle school, maybe....
Ah, yes. We all know the NFL plays baseball
Kinda weak tbh
That is higher than  me punting a football
Calm down it's a baseball
This is a long toss and pitchers do it to increase velocity, it has nothing to do with football
No one can throw a ball without the comments being spammed by “tommy John” or “rip rotator cuffs”🤣 like alright dr dolittle
This makes no sense
WTF?  Look how high that ball goes ! & 100+ yards ? It's unbelievable   but a QB from the 81 rams could supposedly throw 120 yards, Vince Ferragamo ,but he couldn't hit the broad side of the barn
Not with a football
He might be able to throw less than half that
Normal for a any baseball player.
Honey its raining baseballs again
Kid: Gets a strike This guy: This guy should be a professional tennis player
Yeah when I played in college we could throw a baseball endzone to endzone pretty easily.
Stop the 🧢
He threw the baseball 300 feet lmao 🤣  thags a lot he needs to play outfield
That’s a baseball and 100 yds ain’t even that far i used to stand at home plate and throw it over the center field wall 400ft plus I could only throw a 🏈 50yds lol
Footballs don’t go as far as baseballs… don’t be stupid
Different mechanics to throw a football fool✌🏿
Guy tee's off with golf ball. "Could this guy be a NHL superstar?"
🧢🧢🧢🧢
Why should he be in the nfl?🤔
Impressive throw either way
That's not a ball......its either a shoe, a towel, or a bottle of water
That's maybe 350ft in the air if dude didn't catch it...and prolly 335ft where he caught it. It's a good throw for sure...but I was throwing those distances as a young teenager...20yrs ago...and knew several dudes my age(in a fairly bumfuck nowhere area) that could do the same. By the end of high school we were all throwing over 400ft through the air. My PB was around 450ft and that wasn't the furthest of the dudes I knew. With a football though...I maxed out at 75yds in the air before I quit football altogether
Baseball and football are different to throw.
Baseball and football wayyyyyy different
You mean MLB right??
Absolutely NOT
Wait what? Why? Lol its a baseball....
I was more impressed with the catch. Smooth.
Baseball and a football are 2 different things.
He made a mistake guys he meant hockey 🏒
No
Distance is fine but it’s not a great baseball throw. Too much air under the throw. Runners have all day to advance. Much quicker to keep it low and bounce it than lollipop it like this.
I SHOULD B A SEEING EYE DOG TRAINER 😂
Good arm but....hit the cut off man. Unless you are like Vlad Guerrero or Cespedes, that rainbow throw will be too late with me rounding 3rd lol
No he doesn’t, baseball and football are two different beast… 🤦🏻‍♂️🤡
If he smart, he stay out of nfl
That's A Softball ,Even if it was a baseball there are some in the minor Leagues that can't throw 100 yrds.That young man has got some power
The camera should be in the NFL I agree
It’s a baseball…….. every player on the HS team can do that.
No he can’t. Also it’s highly unlikely that a quarterback would ever have an opportunity to run ahead 10 yards unobstructed to wind up a throw. I want to see how far he throws without moving his feet.
That’s a baseball
A football on a baseball or two different things I guarantee a good quarterback could throw that twice as far
Yeah he can throw a baseball far but no one ever throws a baseball like that from the outfield. Just asking to hurt yourself. Need to throw on a line. 330 feet on a line is impressive. not way in the air while the runner rounds 3rd and walks to home plate lol
No..... but I bet Josh Allen could. 🤔😉
It's a baseball you plebs
Taysum hill😹
Nope
Well he’s long tossing. For baseball. So I think he’ll stick with baseball
Just throwing to tree no target, throws and immediately looks around for approval, "did I do good??", you did buddy, so good. Youre so big
Using one of those Nerf footballs that can throw over the length of football field lol is not considered "real talent" He can surely through above average but We need to see what he does with the real football in hand! I give him 40 to 50 yards! Which is still good but he ain't doing no 110 yd bomb!!  You're talking Aaron Rodgers & Patrick Mahomes doesn't even do that lol
Probably yea
Favre?
Not a chance.
A man's throw is insane lol, I cant even throw a ball across the yard 😭♀️
He’s throwing a baseball, he won’t be able to go half the distance with an American football.
Throwing a football far doesn’t make you NFL caliber, most high school QBs can throw a football across the field , doesn’t mean they’ll ever be in the NFL.
What a beautiful rainbow but can he do it on a more direct path?
No
Could he do this with a football, really? You already know the answer is hell no. Stop being goofy. There’s tons of people who can throw a baseball 100 yards.
They used to do Presidents fitness test for kids in school. 6th grade 1972 I could throw a softball 391' documented. By 11th grade I threw 484' documented, reg hardball on radar ( calibrated) 107mph. Now? Im blind, both shoulders no good, knees are ceramic, neck is fused vertebrae, can maybe pick up 10-15#. You young guys better learn to take care and eat better, it catches up before you die.
Baseball is not equal to football.
He should be in the MLB not NFL 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Reading rainbow 🌈
He need to be in the MLB not NFL
*His accuracy is NEXT LEVEL*
Gets on soccer pitch. Throws baseball really far. “This guy has got to be in the Premier league”
reallu...
He should be on the Olympic swim team too!
Oh relax, it's a baseball....impressive but not impossible
I messed my shoulder up doing this in high school, it's still giving me problems yeah its impressive but will tear your arm apart over time #bigfacts
Mahomes: hold my 🍺
Hell naw to the naw naw naw!
...  But can't he do it day in and day out with 300 pound men trying to tackle him
What do you mean he needs to be in the NFL? He threw a damn baseball.
Respect
The answer is no  but that is impressive
Needs to be in the MLB
If he was throwing a football
Im a minor league baseball player and can say fully that this throw was around 95-100 yards which would equate to a 93-95+ mph fastball. Great arm
I can throw it through both posts. Kinda wish I was in this vid lmfao
“I could throw a football over those mountains, if coach would’ve put me in, we would’ve went state..”
🤯  damn
There’s no way in fucking hell that was a football.  Was probably throwing a tennis ball.  Still impressive
Throw it on a rope he could be on the water polo team
Man’s needs to throw a fucking Javelin lmao
*kicks beautiful punt on a golf course* Guy who filmed this: damn put this guy on the pga tour!!!!
Jesus loves you he is risen and he is coming back again soon time is almost out come to Jesus he loves you and has a plan for you come to Jesus hell is real and is eternal fire but Jesus made away out come to Jesus before it's to late
Forget football, MLB sign dis guy ASAP!!! Imagine he throwing a runner from deep center field…Dayyyyum!!!
As a baseball player all I’m saying is throwing the ball in the air vs actually trying to get it to the target in a straight line are two different things he can probably throw a foot ball 45 yards max
Fake
Omg... That's really impressive
He cant act well enough.  Maybe mlb or NHL.  But wwe....I mean nfl has standards
Being good a throwing a baseball makes you a good candidate for playing baseball
300’ throw is impressive but should be achievable by most medium-high level high school players especially if there is no limit on how high you can throw it. Now throwing it on a line is a different story
No he couldn't do that with a football
Amazing throw that's all in all an entire football field length Rock on
Who the Fook is that guy? No for real though, whats his name so I can bet on whatever team he's on
Looks like a little kiddie ball. The guy on the other end reaches up and catches it with one hand.
@drdisrespect is this you!!!
Ummmm😒 footballs an baseballs have different weight an aerodynamics,
It’s a baseball why the NFL not the MLB
Throwing a baseball that far isn’t hard to do.
Doesn't that hurt the arm
Uhhh was cool, but in the NFL they throw closer to the ground, like alot closer
Idc that it’s a baseball that’s still impressive af
Well a baseball is alot different then a football
Hail Mary!
No chance.
Iss a baseball ⚾️
Just cause you can throw far doesn’t do you hardly any good 😂
That’s not a football Bruhh
his hand would hurt like a mf
😲
I think anybody can throw a golf ball that far. He did nothing
First ever home run and touchdown at the same time
Nfl is at the end give it another couple years it will be gone hopefully these white people living there glory days stop supporting that racist shit
He needs to be in the nfl?  Who is the moron who thinks that?  Just because he can throw a ball far.  What about accuracy? Reading defenses?  Running an efficient offense?  Hell, those things don't matter because he can throw the ball further than anyone else.  Lmao
He needs to be in baseball not the nfl..smh
Throwing the ball accurately under pressure is more impressive than this
I'm no football player or baseballer but I'd say definitely not
I could almost do this(I did endzone to endzone in high school, before I tore my shoulder to shit!
That’s a baseball
No
Never lol
Baby nerf football
Pure Aww😂
This is pretty easy with a baseball at that angle.
Is he terrible at baseball?
Jesus that was awesome
*swings a stick* “He should play hockey”
The problem I had trying to throw this far was the pain of all the blood rushing to my hand at once 😭
I was pitching a baseball at 80 mph and easily throwing it 100 yards at 12 years old
Damn…I thought it was a football lmO
Or mlb?
My guy got a are tho
Um well it's a baseball
Love to see this guy beam it str8 at someone
Which guy?
He needs to be in the baseball league
WTF 😯💪💪💪💪
Oh it's a baseball.  That's not really too impressive lol
No. Because a football weighs MUCH more. That’s why it’s good to warm up with a football before throwing a baseball.
Why? That’s a baseball.
bruh that’s not that hard…
No, he could not do that with a football
Put shoulder pads on and do it
No
Football maybe going 45 yards with the same throw. It ain't the same at all
Can he throw a pig skin a quarter mile thou?
🥶🥶🥶
At first I thought he was throwing a football, but since it's a baseball it's really not that impressive
Shut up that’s a completely different ball I was throwing softballs that far when I was 12.
Keep in mind this is a baseball. A baseball field is 3 1/2 times bigger than a football field. So it's easier.
As a baseball player switching to football, no.
It’s a baseball they’re easy to throw compared to a football
That's a baseball not a  profession NFL size football there is a difference in velocity and weight
No
Not how far but how accurate  you can be ok mon
How Much Do You Want To Bet I Can Throw This Football Over Them Mountains?
Could be staged. Ball disappeared mid flight
Looks like a baseball…
I can do that easily with a nerf football
Mlb*
You can throw a bases ball way faster and farther than a football
Not that hard to do if you have a decent arm.
Bruh that's only 315 feet that's 85 Max
That’s a baseball my guy😅
I can throw a baseball further than that and I'm 46 yrs old.
I've seen people throw it on a rope that far. It's like throwing from mid center field to home plate pretty much
I’ll do this on a line
I wish I had an arm like him
No because gripping the football is different
Why nfl and not mlb?
Fake
That's not even that impressive with a baseball lmao most baseball players 18 and up can do this
The guy throwing or catching 😎😎😎
Football, baseball, golf ball.  It's an impossible throw.   If a man could do this, he'd have tore every muscle and ligament in his arm.
Why football he threw a baseball
Just Deflate the Ball....Brady does it
Its a baseball
There’s plenty of people that could throw 100 yards with a baseball
Yep NFL where you can have just 1 small skill of throwing a ball far and Americans will make you rich and famous for it🤦 while the guy who went to university and studied hard his whole life to become an electrician is stuck working pay check to pay check. This is how fucked up 5he world is
Nurf
Lil ass baseball ant got nun on football
Goes to nfl wtf is this brown thing where is my baseball and why am I the only person that has a glove on
Looks like a baseball..
If he threw it half as high it’d go even further. Don’t need all that AIR on a long throw ..
damn he just launched that thing 110 yards
No
JaMarcus Russell had a cannon arm as well…..but that didn’t work out well
I could do that with a baseball when I was 13 what the hell does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
NFL and MLB same thing I guess
They both di
Looks like one of those Nerf footballs with the wings on the end or splaid tail with fins.
Umm that was a baseball wtf!! Not the same as a football at all
Great
It's not even a football lol
That's track and field if they were throwing a football
I bet Will can throw it further and still hit Chris in the head
I can do this with a baseball not so much with a football so I’m gonna say he can’t
He should throw the javelin in the Olympics.
He does! You seen that one handed catch.
Nah not a real one
Let's stop with the BS, someone does some average skilled level videos, now he should be a pro?
No Not even  close. He might throw a  football 50-55 yards
Are people getting dumber??
That’s a fucking baseball 😂
That’s actually pretty regular for baseball players at least in my area
HAHAH NOPE
I put a horseshoe pit next to a football field one time. I got 7 ringers in a row and the NFL signed me.
Why would you say the NFL and not the MLB ?
I thinkntuatvThrowingvthecJavelin would be a better place.  Less money maybe But you don't have 8 or so meat hungry animals raining down on you.
Did anyone else hear that fart?
Simply put. No. No he can not
Don’t understand? For throwing a baseball?
That’s just not even that impressive you should see me playful but I’m way fucking better
Nerf vortex
"could he do this with a football" No, it's different mechanics. If he threw it like a baseball he couldn't get a spiral, and it's too much force on the elbow and shoulder, meaning it wouldn't go far without injury and it'd be floppy in the air. Javelin and football are closer in mechanics.  If he wants to seem impressive doing that with a baseball....flatten it out into a more straight shot.
He needs to learn to throw a Javelin
The return of Uncle Rico
Wow!
Not regulation size
They got plenty of people that can throw out of bounds
Football is way different
madden be like
I garruntee its a bunch of baseball players going "oooo" "ooooo" 🤣🤣😭
If he would have put it on a rope I would have actually been impressed.
Holy cow burgers he can throw.
Do it without a running start
That really not that impressive. Tbh baseball players with a decent arm should be able to do this
That wasnt a football
I could throw a Jr high school football 103 yard  and throw a baseball over the fence from home
Nerf football
I’ve done that from center to home too many times. With a football though. Not a chance lol
Hes throwing a baseball. Completely different.
Needs to be in the NFL throwing a baseball??   Yaaa.
With good technique I'm sure you can throw it far but it's way different throwing a football compared to a baseball, physics alone will tell you that
maybe if it's deflated  hes got a contract in NE
Throw a frozen rope from that distance then you can start posting the long toss kid
Bro idc what anyone says but that really blew my mind and I’m like, yea he was definitely from that lab rats show, his arm is bionic 🤣😐
Football?! If he can move well, dude would be a MONSTER outfielder. Base runners would be waking up in cold sweats.
I’m looking at these negative ASS comments and MFs can’t be happy that Someone did something cool. I could literally upload a video of me flying and there would always be a bunch of  negative MFs.
The answer is no
*with a baseball
No he cannot do that with a football. He'll probably do about 60%. If you look at the physics of it.. I'll say 55 to 60 yards
Would have been more impressive if you connected with a receiver
Idk it was the total opposite for me. Could throw a football 75-80 yards but a baseball not as far. Idk why.
He took like 10 steps forward.
Now go back and do properly, like a man 😂
Fake af
No he needs to be in the MLB
It’s not a football so 💀
NFL  NO !THATS A BASEBALL
Many MLB  outfielders can throw a baseball 300 feet
I doubt he can
Baseball lol
Dam I really thought it was going to be a football
No mlb
NFL. That’s a baseball not a football
Nope MLB fursur,, now that a half a billion  arm right there.
Sent that shit to space
*serves a tennis ball at 160 mph "This guys should be a pro ping pong player"
Can he do it on his knees like JaMarcus Russell tho?
Now try from center field to home at the warning track of an mlb sized field n I’ll be impressed. This throw isn’t that impressive
The NFL needs more pitchers
MLB **
Not doing that with a football.
That’s how I throw my grenade in codm just saying
Josh is already there
Don't quit your day job
Big deal.  Most baseball players with a strong arm can throw 300 ft
Wow great throw! Sharpen your skates, second period is starting.
Man's just put here doing long toss getting his arm conditioned for the baseball season lol he got people recording him haha back in HS our starting qb was one of the short stops in the country absolute cannon for an arm throw a football or baseball
No he needs to be in baseball
Wait, that was a baseball? It means he needs to be an out fielder
He’s goin with me to Ukraine 🇺🇦  Gonna throw some grenades 😂🤣
W throw
That was a baseball that he through
Sign them both
Roll tide 🤦‍♂️
hold on, nobody talking about that aim? that distance and power are impressive, but that aim..me came
No he’d be in the nfl if he needed to ve.
Which one the throw or the catch
I can throw a baseball ⚾️
HE NEEDS TO BE IN ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES SPORTS 🔥🔥🔥🔥
No way that was full size ball
Is that a high-school ball
300ft is not that far for baseball...
It's nerf or nothing
That wasn't even on a line and no he definitely can't with a football wtf
Dont u mean mlb
Long toss
Which one are you talking about here…
it looks like a baseball. it’s white and round and the guy on the other end is using a glove to catch it.
Prob smaller football
That’s a baseball and that’s east af to do bro!
I was a pitcher/fielder, i can throw a baseball just as far. Football? Only about 70 yards. It weighs and releases different. No nfl for this guy
Im now believing that this man is a vampire
I’d like to see him do it with a glove on
That’s not a nfl football is it?? Weird
He absolutely could not do that with a football lol
That was a softball.
Well first of all... What did he throw?
Depends on size of ball
I remember when I was 16 and could throw a football 60 yards.   From my knees  At sea level   In pouring rain   And a 25 mph headwind
He threw a baseball tho 😵‍💫
That’s not a football though
It could be a smaller than regulation ball too
No he doesn’t belong in the NFL
That’s a baseball but wtv.
Not even close to the same thing as a football
No... He needs to be checked for steroids
I didn’t read the title beforehand, and thought it was a football for half the time
Gaaadaaamn....
Man that dude has a launcher
Easy
He should get a full scholarship to any college for womens softball😯
I used to be able to throw it around 120 yards with a baseball and I could throw like 90-94 mph. This is decently impressive but certainly not amazing
He throwin 94 w movement
Nope! Probably 70yd football
Most pitchers who can throw mid to high 80’s (typical speeds for college) can do this😂
Football is heavier jimbo!!
No
... definitely a girls post 😆
Bruh that’s a Nerf or Nothing
it’s a baseball.. try that with a football 💀💀
He'd be a decent bowler
What did he throw with the new stuff they have nowadays I’d have to see what it is before I could have an opinion on this
But can he be a quart back hardest job in the game.. not just throwing. It's everything and being a leader!!!
The person filming should probably research football
"he needs to be in the nfl" *throws a baseball
Cool he threw 110 in highschool maybe 16 my brother at 13 just turning 14 was throwing from goaline to opposite 5 yards behind the goal post
That is not a football…
Imagine if he crow hopped
I can do that too, and I'm 32
He threw a baseball not a football. I'm am willing to bet that the result would be very different.
Yeah I agree that catch was phenomenal he should definitely get drafted
Good throw (and catch) but baseballs travel much further than a football.   With a football though I can’t throw accurately more than 15 yards though so I’m sure he still has me beat
Well that’s a baseball…. So….
Any good outfielder can make that throw. Probably can throw a football 50 to 70 yards with ease.
Um mlb maby
Wow that’s an arm
Big difference throwing a little baseball then throwing a football with 400lb dudes trying to take your head off
A baseball isn’t that hard to throw three hundred feet lol but the moon throw is outrageous
Jesus loves everyone
It’s a baseball and it’s 320ft. Most elite ball players in HS can do this with no problem.
damn what size ball was that?
Big diff on throwing a baseball and football. Stupid ass comment
That’s a pitcher with gas ($100+/Bl).
🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼the NFL.
Why, he's throwing it out of the end zone with a running start.
Accurate too
That’s a baseball
Nice nurf ball lol
110 yards is not that impressive for a baseball even in high school I knew several people that could throw that with a massive running start like that
rotator cuff explosion
I could throw a baseball that far.. I was able to throw a football 60 yards in 8th grade. I'm 32 now  lol
Tf foreal bruh signed that bruh up
Which he?
Lots of people can do that
“He needs to be in the nfl” throws baseball
That’s a ⚾️ baseball
Nerf football?
Browns will sign him and then wonder why it didn't work out.
Eh .
It's a baseball so...
Barely a fence to home plate throw get off the guys tiny nuts Jesus
They*
I guess we’ll never know
To high!! throw that on a rope I used too.
Guy throws a baseball and the captikn says he should be in the NFL? 😆
It’s Nerf or nothing.
Or idk maybe the mlb. You know considering he’s using a baseball
My dominant arm started tingling of jealousy
No he can't do that with a 🏈 that's why he used a baseball.
To be fair. That is a 90mph formula requirement so pretty much every MLB player can do this
This is Napoleon Dynamite's Uncle Rico...
😳😳😳😳
Idk whats more satisfying the pass or catch
Nice throw but that’s a baseball, he will not be able to do that with a football.
JaMarcus Russell threw a football 75 yards down on one knee. I guess that's why he should be in the NFL......🙄
When the RF throws out a guy at homeplate and does it from the warning track, that's impressive.  This is not.
Not that hard with a baseball
Out of bounds...
You sure it wasnt a nurf football?
Daaammmmn!!!
Big deal I can do that to question still stands can he do it with a football
That didn't look like a football
He’ll make triple the money and have a longer career in the mlb. Nlf is trash
I can do this
That is... A baseball...
Bro i can throw a rock littery 25 meters💀
Probably not
Nope
NFL? Dude hes throwing a baseball. Hes exactly in the right sport
I love how sooo many people probably think he threw a football 😂 it’s a baseball, still farther than I can throw but not super impressive
it’s a baseball you guys got fooled, so did I at first😭💀
Which one?
300 ft long toss is pretty common for high level baseball players. Lol
Which one? The guy throwing or the guy catching a ball from the other end of the field one handed? I say both
Yea there is no way he could throw a football that far.
No
That was caught with a glove. Must have been the new football glove I guess
Yeah but that's not a football good throw though you might need to play Major League baseball,
Stick to baseball, health and money
You only have to throw like 90 to do this
Me and my brothers were doing this when I was 12... I'm the oldest... I stopped playing baseball in middle school.
No. He could not. Otherwise he would.  While trying to not die.
No not happening
SIGN THAT BOY UP ANND GIVE HIM GRENADES TOO!!!! Merica
"Could he do this with a football?" No.
He has to be in the NFL smh I would of deleted this post just because of the headline
Him and tyreek hill would be hof duo
Fake
This is nothing
That's pretty standard for a 16 year boy or girl some of us have what we say a Canon
Its not just being able to throw it far you have to be able to put the ball where it has to be everytime
If he could do it with a football he'll be throwing a football instead of a baseball
113 yard throw sheesh..
I mean 300 feet is pretty good but not like omg wow
Baseball throwing is a lot different than football throwing
This is normal for pitchers to practice it’s called long toss….I bet mlb arms can throw much farther
They both doo
What the one handed catch??
It’s a baseball this isn’t impressive
That was a baseball not a football completely different 🤣
Pov: how to tear your rotator cuff
College players long toss that on a rope… but Ight haha
No Way... Football is way lighter
Wrong sport. He could never throw a football that far lol
You mean he should be in the MLB?
I bet he can throw a football like 40 yards max lol
It's a baseball
So no one going to talk about that catch though?
NFL? Foh. Stfu.
He threw a Grenade 😳
Nerf or nothing.
No because throwing a baseball far is much easier than throwing a football far and accurate. So no
Plot twist they're talking about the guy who "Caught" the ball
A football would probably go about 50 or 60 yards.
Yooooo
I know guys who can do this on a line. Impressive for a high school athlete.
That was a baseball
I guess catching a perfectly thrown baseball with a glove is impressive to some people
Too much loft
Throwing a football and a baseball are completely different.   Still an amazing throw tho.
I could workout my entire life and e never throw it that far
I used to throw a baseball 300ft my senior year...but i couldn't throw a football 40yd
Impressive, yes. Still nothing like throwing a football.
that was a baseball
EASY!!! With a miniature!!!!
IF HE HAD TO TAKE THAT LONG AS HOP TO THROW A BASEBALL THAT FAR THEN THERE IS NO WAY HE CAN GET A FOOTBALL PASS HALF FIELD
He saw his crush
Except an nfl football is about 7x that size and much harder to throw cause you cover less of the surface area of the football with your hand. 8th graders can throw a baseball across a football field dude.
Baseball ⚾️
Called long toss that conditions a pitchers arm. My son could that when he was 16.
I did that in 10th grade on a frickn line. This dude rainbowed that ball like the people who think they have a arm lol
Well, if I’m not wrong but that’s a baseball
No
He needs to play mid field
They*
That's a baseball
It’s a baseball
Kid is on football fusion 💀
His shoulder gon hurt so bad the next day 😂💀
U need another Demarcus Russell?? 😂
Wasn’t a football that’s why
Shouldn’t this title be, “he should be in the mlb”
This is what an arm punt should be
It’s a baseball. And throwing one 300 feet with all that arc means he only throws about 80-85
Fuck it make him the kicker
He’s throwing a baseball how does that equate to a football
NFL....center field for the Cards.
Nice feat now try that with a football lmao 🤣
The baseball player needs to be in the NFL??
Sign this man
I don’t remember baseball pitches being that lang
He needs to stay his ass in baseball
How come no one reacts until the ball was caught? Were they applauding the throw or the catch? Would it not have counted if he dropped it?
MLB u mean 😭
Who the one who threw it or the one who caught it one handed?
Most high school varsity baseball players can throw like that .  A baseball is lighter than a hs football
No…He could not do this with a football
anybody can do that with a baseball
No, no he could not. Football is a totally different beast
Fake
No he couldn't
Cause he threw a baseball??
That was a softball. If it was a NFL football he would have thrown 60 to 70 yards max or hurt himself trying.
Dude easily throws 90+
FOR THROWING A BASEBALL .... NAAAAAAAAAAAAAA THATS A SMALL BALL NOT NO FUCKING "PIG SKIN"  TRY AGAIN SUCKA TRY AGAIN
You mean baseball right? Since he the a baseball down field then he would be a good base catcher.... if he was in nfl he wouldn't be throwing pigskin that far
It’s basically throwing a baseball from home plate to the wall in left or right field in a standard field. Not that impressive tbh
Damn. Roughly 330ft?
It’s a baseball
He's not thrown a football he throwing a baseball so he need MLB not NFL
No
Uhhh it’s a baseball, really maxpreps?
Screw the NFL, that guy needs to play baseball
That was 110 yard toss!!
meh thats an OK arm...
Baseball⚾catch was awesome 👌that glove sounded like🥊. If it was a 🏈 ball i would be impress . tell me about it , my shoulder hurt & needed surgery .
Is this actually impressive? I can do this tomorrow
Mkejf
Wasn’t a football n if it was wasn’t a full size one
I actually had to watch it a couple times to realize it wasn't a football he was throwing ...it was the NFL caption that threw me off
No man throwing like that with nfl sized football
It’s long toss… any decent pitcher or catcher can make a 100 yard throw especially with that much arch…
I was a goalie and threw a soccer ball 50-60 yards consistently in high school, it's not that hard if I can do it
Not all that impressive. You wint find a college baseball player that can't long toss 100 yds.
Anybody with a decent arm can throw a rainbow 100 yards...let's see a frozen rope
Ummm...nope
Give a baseball to any nfl qb and they’re doing this in their sleep
Put pads on and throw an actual football
That’s only a 300 foot throw professional baseball stadium is about 360 so it’s like throwing from outfield to home plate…
Even better can he kick a football the same distance!!!!
I can throw a nerd ball that far too
My uncle could have thrown it over them mountains back there 😂
Both them
That man's hand after catching that shit on the verge on shattering
Threw the baseball 340 feet. Wow.
110 yards so 330 feet....I easily did that when I was in high school, and baseball was just a hobby and not even my favorite sport
That’s not the same shit at all. Nice throw but the caption ruins it by blowin it out of proportion. Just cause guys in the mlb can throw the ball far doesn’t mean the nfl scouters are out there looking for QBs.
Huh???????  I guess the guy that runs this channel never played sports.  Also doesn't know anything about physics.
Okay do it with a football
He has a good arm but throwing a baseball and football are two different things totally in the mechanics are a lot different I wish him good luck anyway
I can throw a baseball farther then that,
Youtube once again 🔥🗑 in the feed. Your algorithm somehow gets worse
Damn
Hey I guess I should be in the NFL also
Yeah bit can he do it in a game is the question.. if so then yes he needs to be in the NFL
I think you mean “NHL”
judging all these comments about throwing a baseball being thrown 100 yards it like throwing the ball to the infield nothing to see here baseball players do it all the time in warmup. You people need to get out more. Plus doing this is all the time is a good way of throwing you arm out.
Jesus,  whats he using John Elways nerf football
Anyone can throw a baseball further then a football. I'm 33 n outta shape n I can do that 🤦🏻 do it with a football then wr can talk
Pretty amazing 119 yards
A strong isnt even half the battle of a quarterback.  Are you an accurate passer? Can you read a defense?
I could do that in 9th grade. It sure didn’t mean I was professional.
Ramon Laureano moment
Called a baseball
Not a football
What about a NFL game all then let's talk hype
Get this man on a pitching mound. Also, baseball throwing does not translate well to football. Trevor Bauer throws 100mph+ but can barely throw a football
It’s a baseball
Light work
Just because you can chuck it doesn’t mean you can put it on a dime. Although this is very impressive
Ichiro would've thrown a rope
Why would he be in the NFL if he makes more in the MLB... With minimal effort
Love these videos that don't show the ball in every frame.  As soon as that ball is out of site  It's considered fake in my book. I've been on the interzones for awhile now. Gonna need solid proof of this.
The answer is no, he could not do that with a football…
No
my reaction went from 🙂 to WTF
Yes because throwing a baseball is the same as throwing a football.
Translate to a 50yrd through with a football
My dumbass thought he was gonna throw it then run and catch it
No
Nope. This kid goes in center field
Crumbles when he takes a hit
Do with a football and say some words but til then U just threw that a long way not A Football....
…. That’s normal is baseball…it’s the accuracy part that’s hard…. I played left field for this specific reason.. had really good accuracy and great arm strength.. it takes practice .. not only on the arm.. but your from your torso all the way down to how you point your toes..
A football field is 300 feet. With endzones let’s say 320. Any outfielder in MLB can do that easy and be accurate consistently. If he could, he woudl
Any good outfielder can throw the ball at least the 360 feet he did
Got flag ?
Literally every foot ball kid in 8th grade
Short answer....no
Rainbow we throw shit on a line wea I’m from
Why isn’t anyone talkin about that kid catching my that I would be shizzing myself if I saw that comin
The answer is no
MLB h mean
Bro y’all not giving credit to the thrower😭😭😭
A baseball is harder to control speed but easy to cover distance.
Lol not a real football throw. Nice editing
It's a baseball. Most pros can throw it out of a park from home plate. A baseball is way different than a foot ball. Your ignorance is getting you a whoopin in the comments...
i dont think he can throw like that with a football but that was a great throw very high
Wait that’s not a football? I used to Chuck a baseball across the football field during our football practices. I had a really good arm though I was not the quarterback but I know a few people who could do that. It’s not that hard if you have a decent arm with a baseball. Football that’s a different story.
It’s a one hop to home plate from centerfield. Get a grip.
It's a baseball, I hope he could throw a hundred yards
That’s a baseball not the same weight or size
As a baseball player he couldn’t do that with a football
Aaannnnddddd there goes the arm socket
Ah yes, throwing mechanics for a baseball and football are exactly the same.
MaxPreps’ lack of sport knowledge is on full display with this post I see
No he could not
No dude, the majors
Bruh most people can throw a baseball 50-60 yards..
Nah he needs to go back to his home planet of arms of the gods
Come on really ?
Both do great throw badass catch
I can throw baseball farther, n football about 70 yards in air still doesnt mean i belong in nfl
Try it with a football genius
Both of them
That’s a baseball
Obviously it's a baseball. I really hope no one thinks that's a football. It's soo obvious it's a baseball and both have gloves on...
Barely made it 300 ft but had to throw it 100 ft in the air. Not impressive at all. Most 13 through 18 year old outfielder or ss or 3b can easily do this.
Cannon
It’s a baseball dummy
Probably not
Sooo he threw a baseball...lol. I know about a dozen people who can do this including me. A football? Now that's going half that distance .
Good distance, not great. But you won't throw anyone out with that much loft.
Baseball outfield drills
Which one
But can he do the punt and kick part too?
Cgi
light work
Betcha he cant throw a football for shit
Yeah their is a reason even favre only hit 80 yards. Baseball is much easier to launch
Wow!
Wrong sport
How did that not hurt that would have blown off my hand
If you played baseball this is normal.... But much more lower..... of a shot
I think her needs to play in the game that uses that type of ball. Don't understanding the title here
This is just a guy throwing a baseball 300 ft. It’s incredibly common.
Pick up football games with the nerf ball use to be the shit
Baseball*
That's a baseball
Nah that's a baseball 300ft on a baseball is not our of the ordinary. I could throw 250ft in High-school. A football is larger and heavier.
300’ throw.  Not that big of deal, especially for high school outfielders.
You mean mlb?
Baseballs are used to throw further
Football got Draft to who
Dudes got a bazooka for an arm 😳
This is a baseball but that still is just over 300 foot or almost a home run down the line in yankee stadium so yes he should be in MLB
Which one? That throw was incredible, But the catch was amazing. Maybe a power duo
U mean baseball?
Well that was a baseball sooo..
What is he throwing??
I was able to throw farther than that when I played baseball… practice every day will get your arm strength there.. but I cannot throw a football 20 yards… TOTALLY different mechanics and throwing motion
They both needa go pro
yeah except that was a baseball. Totally different.
They need to be in the NFL not just him
That’s a baseball…
His arm: that’s good for the week let’s go home
It was a baseball
At first I thought it was a football lol
Both should
Coaches write that down write that down , Get both of them sign them to the team
That my friend is a baseball not a football! I’m sorry your parents didn’t teach u this
Which one🤣🤣🤣
Im able to do this with a football once, then i cant move my arm for a day or 2
They both did amazing
Nurf
This is my boy nick wilson he hasn’t played football since middle school. And this video is a couple years old. He  plays baseball in college
It was baseball?
Get it lower and he may have a shot in the farm league
No way a 110 yard throw
Nah stick with baseball. Longer career and less felonies
DAMN
Was that a football ?
I thought it was a football at first I said 😮
330' with a baseball is easy for anyone who plays the sport. We were drilling home plate from the warning track in center field in High School on a regular basis, and we did it with far less arc!  In fact, many on my team could throw the ball over the center field fence at many of the parks we played before high school, around 250-300'!
He threw a baseball 110 yard. So!
How about the guy catching it about to throw it back lol
Why is everyone giving him shit. What a throw !!!
Heh witch one🤣 the one hand catcher or the 100yrd thrower
Plot Twist: He was talking about the person who caught it, not the one who threw it
But isn't that a baseball throw and not an football i mena all of the players could throw that far if they played with an baseball
That's a baseball
Is the wind at his back?
That’s a baseball btw
First time I ever saw anyone toss a field goal from their end zone! Incredible & amazing. Should be a # 1 draft choice.
Probably a nerf turbo football
Which one lol
You can't throw a football@ GAMETIME running forward multiple steps, potential is there though, but might be another Rob Johnson: great quarterback in practice but come gametime he'd often freeze like a popsicle, Who knows?
Bothe of them
Which kid cuz the other one caught it with one hand
Which guy the one who threw the ball or the one who caught it with one hand
I don't see why he needs to be in the NFL.
You train the very best offenlive line you can and you can literally throw deep every play 😂🤣
Now that's an arm . Damn
Why NFL? MLB maybe
We had 2 guys on our highschool team that threw that distance, plus some.... One guy threw the football 50+ yards ON A KNEE
I was impressed until i saw it was a baseball.
It’s a baseball
Why so he can throw a bunch of picks
....Kid dunks basketball This tuber: He should become a professional bowler!
fake
Not if Tom Brady and his deflated ball have anything to do with it.
issa soft ball lol
Damn NFL is using baseballs now?
No
Weird looking football
That’s a baseball
My guy playing the wrong sport lol
Helium? Or maybe I’m jealous. I could throw a football 70 yards in high school. Basically over them hills over there. This seems impossible. Unless it’s a baseball which is no problem.  Now if it’s a 155 mm tank artillery I can pretty much toss one of those things from Ukraine To Russia.
I would only be impressed if he also caught the ball. 7/10
God damn, I’d be happy if I could throw it to the 50
Nigga has to actually do that in the pocket during a combine though, not a running start
Don't inv him to the family party the ball gonna go to another neighborhood
Tough
Fuck football
That is a baseball
No if he could it would be a football
That's not that impressive.. most major league parks deep center is 100 + yds  400 ft
Which one??
I used to be able to throw a ball about a football fields length at 16. I was that kid that would just toss a ball back and forth all day cause I never wanted to be around others. I wish I still played baseball and practiced throwing cause I never really realized how impressive it was. A few months of practice I could probably do it again just don't have the drive anymore.
But that wasn't a football
You mean MLB. I believe he’s throwing a baseball, no?
Pretty impressive it’s about 360 feet baseball players prolly make a throw from the warning truck to second is about about 180!to 220 depending on the field it’s deff impressive
In the NFL? He threw a baseball
Thats about 93-95 mph i threw 90 in highschool and could reach goal line to goal line
What grade are you.  11.. 12.
Me passing my phone to my homie with my girlfriend says can I look through your phone
Wtffff
If that’s a baseball like it seems it is that’s actually not that hard of a throw.
Why?
A baseball is different than a football
I bet he can pitch 90+
And? I've thrown one of those little footballs with the 4 wings on the back a mile too.
Wow it’s a turf field not a court. Court is in basketball not football guys. But great arm.
Nice baseball.
That’s not a football, it’s a kid football.
I heard in the comments you guys throw footballs
Outfielders do this between every inning it’s called having a long catch , this guys throwing that ball about 275 foot right ? He’s getting a running start and he throws it 94 yards .
The fact that the other guy caught it one handed
Imagine seeing a a real mlb cannon throwing it that far on a rope.
To answer your question... NO.
Long toss is the best
how bout the mlb... since its a baseball lmao
Nope
I’ve done this maybe 120ish yards no one caught it. But was during some hella strong wind.
Nah.... cuz weight difference between a bb and a fb
Yes who is this kid???
Superman as a teen
So he throws around 90mph ?? What's the big deal
HE REALLY NEEDS TO BE IN THE NFL
If it was a football then yes but it wasn't
It’s a smaller ball
He’s throwing a baseball
Bring him in to bean defenders who give the team trouble. Just keep targeting the same one until he sits down.
Insane throw and catch
If football was played with a baseball sure..
🦧
Ok, now let’s see an actual full size ball now🤔
Video trickery
Uncle Rico?
That catch tho
If that what I think it is, why would a baseball player play football if he plays baseball?
They both need to be in the NFL that throw and one-handed catch... beautiful
Yea that's definitely not a regulation size football hate to break it to you
They throw baseballs in the nfl?
More like left field
The pro come to flex he's skill  When he come he say : step aside i show you how to play
If that were a football 🏈 y
The one who caught it or the one who threw it?
That’s a baseball. I can do this without stretching first.
That's elite
I could do the same years ago with a cricket ball at school but on one throw back as I went to catch the ball I miscalculated and it hit right on the end of my middle finger. My nail filled up with blood immediately and soon fell off. The pain,It was like my hand was on fire I could barely use it for a while.
PatrickMahomesI is Goat
Football an a baseball are totally different
Both of them
It’s not a football
FAKE it’s edited you gullibles
two things, this could be fake, and two just because you can throw a ball far didnt make you an NFL QB , accuracy, reading defenses and and speed makes for a great QB.
Doubtful.
Crazy, I didn’t know they used baseballs in the nfl.
Which one???? 😂
I know he's superman
I couldn't do it with a golf ball.
Nurf ball though
THEY YOU MEAN
the best part about this was that the guy who caught it did it one handed
Mortar
That’s a baseball not a football!!!!!!
Did anyone notice that’s a baseball?
Thats a baseball not that impressive
I don’t know which one to be more impressed with.
he grew a baseball not a football
that makes my shoulder hurt just from looking at it
Try using a adult ball and not a child's cause anyone can throw a little ball that far especially with the wind
I did that at our high school football field durning soccer practice and heard everyone do the same thing lol
WHY?
Got to be fake wtf
That was a baseball not a football. It’s really not at all impressive.
Impressive throw, but every outfielder I played with at the D3 level (1 step above community college) could do the same.   That's the short side warning track to home plate equivalent. And in game, you'd use much less height on your throw as well.
The rare dad who was around to play catch. This is the result lol
Anybody can launch a baseball far but good throw
That was a baseball. The person that caught it is wearing a baseball glove
Obv not or he would
3/4 times per week in a routine for top tier pitchers. Long toss=god
His shoulder must be his biggest fan.
I bet his arm was on fire after that
Y’all know that’s a baseball right?
Shoulder left the chat 💬 🔥
Pat mahomes w a baseball
No he could not
That’s impressive arm strength. As a former baseball and football player though, I fail to see how throwing a baseball 300 feet makes someone a candidate for the NFL.
Damm
Bruh that’s a baseball smh
If that’s a baseball it’s not impressive, I did this as an 8 th grader 100 yards
what a stupid title.
Long tossing I football field . Lol you must not know any baseball players 😂😂 see this all the time..
Nope
Not all baseball players can play football but most pro quarterbacks could play baseball Wilson Murray Elway Coppernick Brady the list as long
ZEKE YAEGER WE FOUND WHO IS WORTHY TO TAKE YOUR BEAST TITAN POWERS
It’s nerf or nothing
Is that one of those nerf footballs with a tail?
Are we gonna ignore that it’s a baseball? I could do this at like 14
Omg
It’s a baseball
It was a baseball not a football big difference
Which one you talkin bout?
Wait that’s not a football? Then what the fuck are we here for?
Not saying it’s a bad throw- but it’s a lob.  Watch a right fielder warm up before a game and he will throw lasers 250-300 feet.
No he can't difference is the weight of the object
He can probably do that with a football no doubt
Yes because throwing a baseball is the same as a football smh
So he threw a ball a hundred yards , can’t you ?
that's a pee wee football lmao
That was a baseball, the catch would be amazing if a football, but now you know he has a baseball glove on, you feel kinda silly you were soo impressed. lol
Nah u couldn’t do that with a football. Prty good tho
It’s a baseball? Like what 🤣🤣 not the same thing
Back in '82? I used to throw a pigskin a quarter mile... How much do you wanna bet I can throw a football over that mountain?!!
Liberals prolly think 300 feet isn’t that far for baseball
Throw far mean quarterback yes I am sport smart, why smol ball when can bigger ball
I used to be able to do that   Got older and not anymore
That pop up ass throw. If you play in hs you can do this
Not with a football
The NFL: "yeah, we didn't see anything special"
Throws a youth size football just to get views 😂🤣
...is that an arm or a cannon?
Mlb players throw a baseball that far all the time but half as high in the air.  He's throwing a baseball to a guy with a glove, not a big deal to catch it. Not impressed
Baseball is much simpler. But still impressive
If I tried that my arm would still be attached to the ball flying through the air.
Holy shit
Only qualifies if he's a woman beater and/or has a record with felonies. Then he'd fit in perfectly.
Theyre playing catch with a baseball ya dingus
Fake
What kind of ball is it though?
That was a baseball
That was a baseball my guy. Also that's roughly 300+ feet, shit a centerfielder has to throw on the daily
Wow Great throw, but definitely Was a Smaller ball.
Was it a nerf football?
It’s a baseball. I haven’t played in 7 years and I can still do that. He isn’t throwing on a line. It’s a long toss that college coaches made us do.
For the record that was a baseball not a football....not sure those skills translate
I remember the vortex howler football
Its a baseball
Thats a fucking rocket
No lol
This is definitely baseball
no he couldn't
A lot of baseball players can do that
That's not a football though is it?
My shoulder just tore just looking at this
No no he couldn’t
Long toss
No lmao
GOOD LORD he THREW it out of the stadium!! Then the other guy catches it like NO problem.
Which one? You mean both
No
That shit left the atmosphere lol
this is common for any baseball player that throws 88+. nothing really crazy about this fr if you play baseball.
Might be able to throw and football 45 or 50 yards. That's if he can get a good spiral on it.
If you don't play baseball or football do not respond you have no idea what you are talking about. Why do the people who have no athletic ability love to comment on something they have never done.
And he will be 😁😎🇺🇸
Threw it a mile. Out of bounds and incomplete!!😺
No he can’t do that with a football 🏈
This isn’t that hard with a baseball, I’m 14 and can throw it 100 yards
Cause it’s a baseball? Lmao 🤣
The catch right?
That looks more like a baseball, also the guy who caught it, no way that was a football
Nerf ball
No that’s normal pitcher stuff mlb pitchers can throw 130 plus yards
No way he threw that ball over 100 yards. No way.
Wtf!
It's fucking baseball! Calm down people 😌
That’s insane
“They” need to be in the NFL can’t overlook the catch 😂😂😂
I wanna see the ball
This is like watching Tom Brady throw a TD and saying “wow he should play basketball”
That’s a baseball anybody can throw it that far ps not a hater
It’s a baseball. Not a football. Baseballs are MUCH easier to throw than an NFL ball, have you ever seen an NFL football? They’re like the size of a third grader.
no he needs to be center field w that arm
In nfl he won’t always have that run and jump with it
Got to be good at a sport to go pro buddy
It's a base ball tho
Obviously a nitrogen filled ball.
Throwing a baseball and football are two totally different things😂I don't think it would translate over to football the same
No he couldn't
He needs to be in the NFL for throwing a baseball? Wtf
It’s nerf or nothing
Not that hard with a baseball. He threw it really high
He is so strong
You mean the MLB?
Lots of men can throw a baseball that far!!
That’s a baseball not a football
Or the MLB? 🤷
So he threw a baseball like 325 feet or so.... Thats not that impressive
Confusing situation he’s throwing a baseball on a football field and they’re talking about NFL do you mean MLB or
Fake
you bellends don't know what a football is, u meant to say egg ball
Definitely not that far with a football
You mean MLB not NFL...
Do you mean the MBL? He's throwing a baseball not a football.
Dawg didn't even have to move one step to catch. The throw couldn't have been more perfect
How I expect Superman to play catch with his dad
"I'm fighting for my life" - His rotator cuff tendons
👍
He's the one... He'll destroy the Democrats and restore the minds of the Indoctrinated.

Isn’t that a baseball tho?
Damn
Throwing distance and throwing accurately is different
Right cause baseball=football
Threw a baseball 110 yards with 10 yard run up literally will never happen in the nfl or any level of football. Even in the longest throw competition I think they only got a 5 yard run up
At first i thought it was a football.I have thrown a baseball the size of a football field.
Completely different lol
Piss rainbow
Decent arm but if you can't throw a homerun then don't speak
Throwing a non-regulatuon ball the length of the field is not a football position. Try PS5.
Someone Draft this man
he not doing that with a football 😂
Lol that was a lollipop. Dudes not going to any league
زکید شسسسبفچیرییغ
الو
Next video of him throwing a 100 yard pass, “He needs to be in MLB”
And if that's not a football nice try my 14 year old neighborhood can through it from the tracks
Nice arm butt can you do that with timing and whiling running for your life
😶
That was an amazing catch
Which one?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shyI-aQaXD0&t=1s   Age of the Earth https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrkYDzILgtA        Dinosaurs and the Bible
Lol no
اه
When you die the real you( the spirit inside your body) either goes to Heaven or hell. Going to either path depends on if you accepted or you rejected Jesus Christ as the savior.   Heaven is a very good place with no sins, sorrows, crying, lust, greed; in other words there is no sin there and it’s full of joy.   Hell is very terrible and it’s very very hot, you can’t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don’t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed, The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity, Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever. Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) “And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”   Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.    So how to get salvation and be on your way to heaven?   First thing first; Believing at Jesus Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Jesus Christ will send you the wrong direction.   Hebrews 10:4, 10  For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.   No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.   Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now, that way you will receive salvation and be on your way to heaven during rapture or after death.   After believing at Jesus Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.   Romans 6:10-11  For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.   As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.   Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..
Ummm... It's a baseball
But can he run and also catch it?
That mf  has a gotdam cannon... And The other mf didn't even move to catch the pass.. sign this mf now!
I threw a baseball 90 yards and never played in my life.  Totally different than a football. He may be able to throw 45-50 accurately once or twice outta 10 try’s.
throwing a baseball and a football are two wayyyyyyy different things smh
Both of them😱
Uncle Rico?!
The myth of Uncle Rico
He couldn’t do that with a football. If he could he would
MLB*
360 feet throw. So he can throw from the outfield to home plate. Great
When Trevor Bauer still goes anywhere for attention
Baseball!
I could throw a golf ball  behind goal post and through the other easily. Could throw a baseball 115 yards but I could only throw a football 38 yards. So just because you can throw a baseball it doesn't mean you can throw a football.
the real Uncle Rico
This is my school lmao
Which one, I know the throw was extremely impressive but the effortless one handed catch was goated
That track fat asl
Kids got a arm
Not impressed. It’s a baseball. Easy throw
If you ever played long toss as a baseball player you know this is nothing
He threw that like pat and he caught it like obj
Both of them need to be in the nba
Title should be mlb
Not nearly the same as a football
Damn Uncle Ricco
They both need to be that catch was pretty good too
When you playing football with daughter
How bout props for the guys that  caught it.
What the actual fu- HE'S INSANE
No football for him lol. Go play MLB
Can we acknowledge the casual one handed catch tho
I also do that with a nervous football, nothing special
He u mean BOTH
No
Wow.
What socerers are these
Was that a baseball?? Still a strong arm
He might could do it pretty close, you hold and throw a football different
Who is that. How is he not a Football star
Sign him up now🏈🏈🏈
Better than Tom Brady!
He got an arm danggg
* tapping Y
Cameraman did a pretty good job
Football would maybe go half of that
Hell no he couldn’t do that with a football
Wow... Amazing.
“Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are who judge, for in whatever you judge another you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things. But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things. And do you think this, O man, you who judge those practicing such things, and doing the same, that you will escape the judgment of God? Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭2:1-4‬ ‭NKJV‬‬.
I’m calling it that a kids ball
Dude throws a baseball about 110 yards (with what appears to be a high degree of accuracy) & you say- "He needs to be in the NFL"...   Aside from the obvious issue here, are you not aware of the difference in size, weight, shape, aerodynamics etc. between a baseball & a football? Are you aware of the different grip, arm angle/motion & over-all mechanics used to throw each one? If a sink a soccer ball by kicking it in from half court, are you gonna tell me I should play in the NBA?
At first I didn't read the title and thought it was a football and was like WAT DA FUCK
If only playing quarterback was that easy
Got damn that mf got a 💪
Nice catch
No he can't
He needs to throw a real NFL football see how far he throws it right
I've thrown a baseball end zone to end zone not an NFL quarterback does it make
When You Throw The Ball Off To The Opposite Team Saying “Early Bird”🥴
That was a lot of throwing for any kind of ball.Deep center field  to home plate easy
Poo
Hard to believe. Not saying it's fake, calm the f down, just saying...
Someone call the Blue Jays
He should try javelin
That was a little as FB
That’s a real real real BALL?
The pros in baseball do foul pole to foul pole throws that's impressive, and this is just some kid throwing a baseball 100 yards
Pretty rainbow
That's a 110 yard throw with a baseball..a distance most major league outfielder couldn't match..so that is one heck of a throw. If that guy has a large hand he can probably throw a football at least 75 yards..which is pretty darn far to throw a football. My guess is that he had the wind at his back and got some aid from that..but maybe not.
https://youtu.be/n4b51mmcgTs
Or perhaps he could play a real sport not a yank one
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all.
Damn! At my best I could reach the 10, maybe 20 yard line if the wind was right...
🤑
That ain't now NFL ball so it dont matter...
Is that a baseball?
Pretty sure it's not a football
I thought he was throwing a football at first this ain’t as impressive with a baseball
https://youtu.be/68LzTv1o6a8
B
Baseball !
Why cus he can throw a nerf ball far?  Lmfao.  Thats every 12 year old ever
Def cannot do that with a football lmao
https://youtu.be/echCmkUQ0yw
https://youtu.be/echCmkUQ0yw
*MLB
https://youtu.be/r_G0xPVSUEI
100 yards o my
With football he can't if he use hands
That was a baseball... smh....
BOTH OF THEM🤯
The one that threw it or the one that CAUGHT IT WITH ONE HAND !!!!!!!!!!!🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Bro were not talking about how the guy on the other side caught it 1 handed?
Most big league outfielders can make that throw. It's just not something that's needed all that much. Most likely they played a ball wrong and the runner is trying to score from 1st.
Yeah that  catcher should  be in the nfl
Mlb

*Did I just see Bill Belichick in the bleachers?*
Jamarcus Russel from the old madden😂
That's fuckn awesome 👌🏿
He definitely dislocated his shoulder after that throw
What’s impressive is catching a “football” with a baseball glove !
I could hit home plate at 13 years old from outfield. A quarterback is precision.
Dam got a good arm on him 💪
No.
Jesus Christ 🥺

He won't be able to do that in football,you can throw the baseball further then a football.
Except for the fact that they use "football's 🏈 in the NFL, not baseballs ⚾
Oh, he threw a ball? Here I am, trying to find the dude who threw the ball
That's a baseball, very different weight and velocity than a football. It does not translate!!!
This was everyday "long catch drills" for the first 2 weeks of baseball practice when I was in high school back in the early 90's. By the end of the 2 weeks, the majority of the varsity could go endzone to endzone. Lol! NFL?? Our quarterback could easily do this with  a baseball, and he didn't even make all-conference.
I could do that from in back of the end zones and not that long ass head start. Use to throw the ball from home plate over the fence in college. No sweat
Now imagine if he threw it straight 👀....
Throwing a baseball good one time doesn't mean you're an NFL superstar hall of famer.
Whatttttttt
Easy when there's no defensive end blitzing
Just because you throw the ball 100 yards doesn't mine you can hit a WR on a slant
Ppl can’t even kick that far let alone throw a 🏈
When you don't know jack shit about sports.  1.) you only need to throw a baseball 77 MPH to achieve the distance of a 300-foot throw. 2.) A Football field is only 360 feet long. 3.) Average human beings can throw at 65MPH without real training. 4.) Average 16-year-old baseball player can clock 80MPH  That means in this video at least 50 million people can make that throw in the United States.
What if I told you God drew a picture of Himself on our planet? Would you believe it? He did. How do I know? Because of the other pictures He made. They all contain the characters of the Garden of Eden. How do I know? Because together these pictures tell the story of Creation and how it happened because of the fall of satan from Heaven. People have been standing on some of the biggest pictures on this planet and no one noticed,..but I did.  Please let me show you something really special that God showed me. Nothing on my channel is monetized. I just want  you to see...  *God is real.*
If I’m not mistaken a football weighs more that answers the question
Probably not it's much easier to throw a baseball then a football
He could probably throw a football around 70 yards
Wowww.... That far 👏👏👏👏👏👏ure awesome
What an arm! This boy has a chance at two sports.... 1) As you can see.... Baseball ⚾️ 🧢  2) Football,  that's if he can throw it as far and if he can take a hit once in awhile!  Maybe he can play in both sports at the same time
Bra Super Bowl dub for our Browns if he comes to the NFL and play wit our team
footballs harder to throw so no he cant throw it that far if it was a football. too much wind resistance.
Throwing a baseball is different than throwing a football.  Different grip, different size, different physics.
Nice throw, not really impressed !!!!
baseball and football are not the same lol but still impressive
Decent throw, but there are some base players who could make that same throw with half the height.
Kids In India do this everyday, no big deal.
Keep it up! I am dropping 1 song a week for the next 3 years straight. It has never been done in music. Come along for the ride if you want. Stay blessed !  - Bryan
Colleges: we will watch your career with great interest
But does he got pop in his swing?👀
Correction MLB
It appears he threw it about 330 ft, looks impressive, but remember mlb centerfield wall to home plate is 400ft..most everyone in mlb could make that toss, and a lot in college..hes definitely got an arm, but not mind blowing
That's not a football.
No he can't do it with a football
That's a baseball or something, not a football lmao
It's easier then it looks
My uncles can throw like that 😂
If wind didn’t play a factor, that’s fire🔥🔥
That's a baseball you twats
Yes because you can throw a baseball the same distance as a football
Both of them need to be!! 🤙🏽
Somebody get his ass into nfl contact
That is a baseball the dude catches it with a glove on
Wait! what? Plz tell him be for the champ's the  New England Patriots plz.💯👍
A baseball still pretty tough and a bit heavy so that's impressive either way
Both of them do 😳😂
More like he needs to be in the MLB
Tom Brady can't do that
Regulation Football?
I just want to see him toss a football, and by toss I mean throw 70 yards 🤦🏾‍♂️😂😂
People who think of throwing a football when they see a person throwing a baseball are broken of mind!
But that’s not a football
This is a stupid title... If course not.
He could not do it with a  🏈
O my
I threw farther than that in high school I could throw a ball to the 375 ft mark which was how far it was to the outfield wall
WOW!
Looks like a mini football
How are pretending this isn’t easy? Smh…
It’s a baseball though. Still a great throw but wtf that gotta do with football ?
Too corrupt to let raw real talent try out. Got to have that sheepskin most the time
With an 8 step crow hop
Let me see him through a football not a baseball.🤣🤣
Wonder if this is fake.
Bionic man
He’d make a good outfielder, but he can’t throw a football like that! 🤦‍♂️
For accurate tarot prediction on success and love that truly resonates, join us at http://www.youtube.com/c/SuccessAndLoveTarot
Yes he does!
My guy chill
No
damn
If his accuracy is that good consistently the at that distance. He might want to think about at least try picking up a football and get some training. Could pose as a backup.
Now that’s a very strong arm, he should definitely try out for an NFL team ASAP.
Better than Patrick mahomes???
No way he can do that with a football.
What size ball?
BEYOND  AMAZING  NFL BOUND !!!!!
Bad throw ,way to much air..
Idk man i cant believe nothing i see on the internet anymore
Is there a world record for this because if so hes got it in the bag
lol i can do this with a baseball. imagine actual professionals doing this
ya that's a baseball
Dayum! What a Throw!!!
Wow. He got a killer arm. What?  NFL contract. Teams come get him.
Wow good arm and wrist strength
That is a baseball
Let's see you do this challenge ladies? The winner will get a box of tampons!
It’s a baseball
Ah a graduate of from "The Trevor Bauer School of Throwing"
Cool I think just about all baseball players can throw about that length, I mean it's a baseball lolol  I would expect you to throw it that far
Or the MLB?????????
Lightwork
I don’t believe it
I don't believe this shit for 1 second
Why?
No
Man got a arm that's for sure
Why?
Try that with a real football now
That’s a baseball any one who can hit 90 will throw it over 300 feet. Even less than 90. Not that impressive.
Throwing a football is different. You're under duress
??? I could throw like that in 6th grade lol
Wouldn't work in football, the ball ruined that thinking and who is fast enough to get from one endzone to the other to catch it?
Maxed out Quarterbacks in Retro Bowl be like:
No
That was a baseball but if he could do that with a football then you could probably beet the longest throw in nfl history and be 5 times popular than Kurt Warner and Joe Montana
You mean mlb
I can do that
Needs to be in the nfl for throwing a baseball?
Holy moly the kids got a rocket for an arm
That there is 330ft, not bad at all
https://youtube.com/shorts/tlOiFyG03A8?feature=share
I think he should try MLB  first 🤨🤨
Not to be that one guy but I’m positive it was a smaller ball or else son would be somewhere
Who else thought the thumbnail was a tornado?
I don't know what was more impressive the throw or the one-handed catch.
Why does he need to be in the NFL?
There’s no way that’s a football
A strong arm is just the start. Is he accurate? Can he read a defense and process a playbook?
Hell yeah NFL

Where's the Scouts? .....Sign  him UP!
He'd just end up being JaMarcus russel
When you completely skip leg days and only pump them arms.
That was pretty straight as well
I miss those days I use to throw a   baseball from the fence to home plate
Who can’t do that ?
you mean MLB?
Throwing a baseball and football are two totally different objects nfl lmfao he needs to stay in the outfield
The answer is no way, at least the person would need to be way stronger and have longer arms. Fb weights a lot more.
Who doe?
How bout the kid who vaught it with one had? These two kids have gifts.
Yeah, I know those "little balls" are so easy to throw
That dude has an ARM!!!!!!
Patrick mahomes could never
It’s a baseball.
That’s a baseball
U mean baseball, just cause he can trow. A baseball don't mean he can do that with a football  🏈
I could do that with a nerf football no doubt
Uncle Rico finally got his chance.
Is he throwing a football or a baseball?  Watch the person catch it
That's from mid-deep outfield to home
Я так в ПТУ гранаты кидал по500г. Перекинул футбольное поле, побил там какойто рекорд какогото года... Физручка офуела... А когда в школе бросал мячики, то все сразу уходили ловить мячи в конец стадиона...💪
https://youtu.be/r_G0xPVSUEI
That was actually a baseball
Lu McIntosh o my goodness  like a little of which lool I like sports
Josh Allen is that you?
Not real
Lol which one!!? Dude caught that with 1 hand like nothin
Definitely a baseball not a football 🙄
Unreal!
The world record was set by Outfielder Glen Gorbous in 1957, who threw a baseball 148.6 yards (135.89m).
🥰
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
That's not even impressive it's a baseball and he rainbows that shit throw it on a line drive.
Definition of wasted talent.
Handball
Easy to do with a nerf vortex
Tell me when you have time to do a 10 step drop in the NFL?
In the NFL he can: 1) stand in the pocket and get sacked 2) overthrow the receiver and still get praised for being smart 3) get groomed for head coaching job.
You have to use an actual football
Fuck that play baseball more money
Awesome
I know a dude that would throw a hutch football 100 yards upon waking up every morning.
No way that’s real
"Football " u mean 🏉 huh??....
It’s a baseball, not impressive at all. I guarantee you any star high school football players could easily throw a baseball that far. Put and actual full-size football in his hand and it goes 50, maybe.
He’s gonna have to walk that ball back to him
https://youtu.be/uWnoAO5thMA
its a frickin baseball. A lot of us can do it.
No ones gonna talk about that snag?
That was impressive, but football would not go near as far
That’s a baseball lol
What kind of ball is that though?
Hail Mary play all day
It’s a baseball lmao. I’m a baseball player and can do the same thing
He threw a baseball. And that’s only a 320 foot throw. A decent center field to home throw. Most high school outfielders should be able to do that.
That’s very impressive. My strongest throw would probably reach half court.
No. No he couldn't do that with a football. 😂
The sound of it hitting the other guy’s glove is so satisfying 😂
Nerf ball.not real football but still an impressive throw 🤘🤘
Was he white?
Both of them
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
You mean baseball not football arm like that needs to be mlb
https://youtu.be/1Z9bp_3YOwc
who is this
😭😭mein itna manat karhi hu lakin grow nihi oh rhi hai
Tom Brady should know about this person but first get a lawyer
Both need to be in nfl
#MoonKnight#Wednesday#4Days
Why cause he can read the defense
https://youtu.be/M-ql_wdUEaA
Safe….
get this bullshit off youtube and onto tiktok where it belongs...these 30 sec style vids are just going to destroy youtube and unfortunately there are no decent alternatives at the moment
NFL?  THE BALL IS OF BEIS BALL
Fake
That dont mean shyt
But it's a baseball
NFL qbs can’t throw a football that far
Which one
Wait  Wait  Wait  Wait Wait                 Got it ⚾️
Average person can throw a baseball that far football different story
No
Holy cow
120 yards
It’s a baseball.
That’s a baseball.
By his form it looks like he's throwing a baseball not a football
Now let's see him do it with a football on a baseball diamond
WOW
That’s not a football
Plot twist: it was a peewee football.
That's a baseball ⚾️
Wow
Forget NFL he should be in MLB
Light work?
Is this not a damn baseball lol
If this is real holy shit
Lol there’s a huge difference between a baseball and football
World record baby
320ft throw with a baseball. Impressive but im sure a lot baseball players can do this. Cuz i can bitches
Could do this in high-school. Most highschoolers can
Glad U all think this is a real comparison
Both of them
That was an amazing catch!!!
Baseball
He threw a baseball. Not a football. Also, there's 1000 more things that go into a QB position. Not just throwing a ball.
You don't throw baseballs in football
The one who caught it should in the NFL 😂😂
Omg
Look how far he threw that baseball !! I know right ! He should be in the NFL …. Huh ?
It's a baseball ⚾️, there's a big difference
Someone needs to sign that kid quick
I could do that
K2 that’s why snap ass football
Probably bout 30 yards with a football
Small ball is easy
I can do this easily
That’s not a nfl ball
A lot of people have big arms
They let you use baseballs in the NFL???
Beast mode
WTF? What a massive throw
That's a baseball he's throwing
A NERF maybe... but that wasn't pigskin.
The answer is no
I used to do this on a line
So obviously fake…
Wow
If he can do this consistently the MLB will call
I can still do that at 42
nooooooo
MLB sign this kid lol
Fake
That throw and catch were unbelievable
Uhh fuck no , a baseball about 105 grams vs a football 17 oz which is around 500 g . So 3x or 4x the weight he would not be able to . He would probably make it to the opposite 30-20 if he was SUPER LUCKY .
Holy fuck
How much you wanna bet I could throw a football over those mountains
Center fielder in baseball
No... He could not do it with a football!
my man used 80% of his strength
That's literally not hard with a baseball. The outfield fences are further than that. You should try some strength training. You might then be able to not rainbow that
They both need to
I could that right now and I'm 45. That's not special. A football is a whole different story. He's not making it 50 yards with a football.
I'm surprised the football didn't knock out a bird
Baseball
He's done it hasn't he Whis
Nambe not possible
You mean in the MLB ?
Would love to see close up what it was that he threw
The subtle "woah!" when you know he's really thinking "holy sh*t!" just makes this even better. 😂
Guys got a rocket for an arm
Dang
There is at least one high school kid on every baseball team that can do that. And probably more on a rope
Sure, if it’s windy.
He could likely huck a football, but not over 100yds like this.
It’s more to being a QB than throwing far
Its good but not like woaaaa!! Can he do it with a real 🏈
awesome job 👏
I don't care what he threw that was awesome
You mean the mlb
Ahhh long-tossing ⚾️ he has a cannon tho
Nice because he can throw a baseball? Does not translate
Great catch
A baseball is easy To throw really far
He has a hell of an arm but a football throw is entirely different than a baseball throw.
Wtf lol
Only problem who can run and catch that down field?
Both of them should be in the nfl
That’s honestly not impressive
How many qb get that much running room?? For real, bet in normal play he wouldn't be able to do that
Damn! He’ll also do really well in javelin!
No, no he couldn’t
😮😮😮That was amazing someone should syne this boy up  👍
He's throwing a baseball
By the way it's a baseball
Oh boi 👀💪🏾
Both ot them need to be
No he could not
Both them do
He wouldn’t be able to throw a football 🏈 that far…
That happy Gilmore run off always makes thing go farther away 😆 🤣
What is NFL
Hell NO
That’s a baseball tho
Except that's a baseball ⚾️ not a football 😐
Failed to include ball size.
The weight is a huge difference between a ball and a football so weighted one football in his hand, this video get canceled immediately lol
Nah, it’s a fuckin baseball
I don't ok now after the huuh? I expected he needs some milk
Not impressed Mike Vick did it practically standing still.
which one bro caught that one handed jesus
That's a baseball? Lol
They both should be in the NFL
The stupidity now a days... You can throw a baseball far because it's more aerodynamic. It would be near impossible to throw a football that far yet accurate as well.
Amazing
I did this as a freshman in high-school. Not really a big deal as any college player with a good arm could do this
bro that’s a baseball
Thats not a regulation football. I promise you that. Its impossible to throw a regulation football that far...i dont care who you are.
That’s not as far as my dad went
Am I the only one who noticed that isn't a football??🤷‍♂️
Which one
Any Cleveland browns receiver would have dropped that
Fake
Holy 💩💩💩what an arm 😳
I thought he ran up and kicked the ball! 😲
Playing catch with a baseball off the double hop throw, solid arm no doubt, but as a ballplayer this isn't impressive
I don't know of any NFL QB who can throw that far. Amazing!!! Maybe 7500 ft Elevation and Helium filled football? Even if all that was true it's still an incredible throw.
Only if you find a reciever that can turn out a 5 second 100 yard dash.
He needs some 🐒
2nd string QB brought in the end of the game when they need a 100 yard Hail Mary!!! Amazing arm
NFL ? He meant mlb
Clearly that’s not a the typical American “football”
That’s very impressive. My strongest throw would probably reach half court.
Sus
Your dreams aren't that far away son...  The dream..
Oh damn okay no pressure
Half that with a football
The other one needs to play for the Zimbabwe 🇿🇼 cricket team. I see too many dropped catches in my boys 😂😂👏
Wow, strong arm!
Before getting trumped up sex charges, Trevor Bauer was doing this years ago
That’s pretty common for high school! We would always throw em out from home plate to mess around.
Is that a baseball?
U STILL A WATER BOY
Ya but that's a baseball. No way could he throw a football like that.
I could never do that I don't got enough power yet
Jr size ball, I don’t think he will make the nfl lol
Why is it called football when you don't play with your foot?
Rugby fs
Bitch that shit easy  the fuck  yu better throw that far yu tryna play baseball
Send this guy to Ukraine with a bag
That’s not a football but ok
This is one of the benefits of having your phone on your left hand.
I can do that. The difference would be that my elbow would be hurting for a week.
Football nn a baseball is too different things
They both need to be in the nfl the throw and the catch was just as clean 🏈
I sat there for three run throughs mouth wide open
It’s a baseball tho…..
I honestly think both of them should be there cause each or them did a great move
Don't think that he do the same with football because of grip and everything but awesome throw
Lol most center fielders can do this
Which guy??? Great throw, great catch...LoL
No
It's not a regular nfl standard size ball I could launch a little football far too lol
Sure do
My coach would have been pissed if I threw a baseball like that. Gave the runner at least an extra base in flight time. I seriously doubt he could throw a football like that
110 yd / 330 ft + throw. Super impressive. The equivalent of throwing the baseball from a shorter left or right field fence all the way to the catcher behind home plate
That’s a baseball ⚾️ lol 😂
Imagine missing the catch and it lands right on your face with the pointy part of course
It’s a baseball….not reply impressive. Whites are never impressive
This is long toss.
No, its easier with a soft ball because its smaller and has more weight to it, is easier to get a full grip on, and goes faster in the air
No!
MLB
I can throw that too
Yeah the guy who caught it denfinetly make it
Sign him to the green bay packers
That’s a baseball.
Wtf
If he could get 70% of that with the pigskin....$$$$$$$$$
Spectacular throw and nonchalant catch 👏
😳😳😳😳😳😳 daaaang what a Arm the guy has!
That's what you call a cannon for an arm. The only problem is getting pass protection to get a receiver down field that far like 9 yo 10 seconds
Lmao
Wait that's considered football qualifications? I can and have done that, even further. But like 3 times because it hurts like hell if I did it more. All the blood rushed to your hand and it burns like crazy
they both do
Why the NFL? That’s a baseball.
Temperature and wind play a huge factor in distance but it's still impressive to throw that baseball 100yards.
Ball flies over post and crowd catches it🤔 effective 😏😂
If only that was a football and not a baseball
I agree NFL
No matter what kind ball it was it was accurate
Easy  throw
Can’t agree more
Everyone who doesnt realize it's a baseball and doesnt really translate to football........smfh
Which one?
500 comment btw
Just oOoO- made me laugh
I wish I could throw that Far
I mean this in the most respectful way possible but a lot of baseball players can do this football is a different story
Nah he needs to be in the mlb
No....he couldn't
That is kinda scary actually
Nice throw 👏 looks like a baseball
Anybody that throws over 90 can do that.
Who is this guy?
Guy has foot work already and of course a cannnon for a arm
Why is It always the best players who doesn't wanna join a televised sport
This is not uncommon for baseball players. It would be more impressive if he threw a laser not a lollipop.
he needs to do javelin.
110 yards!! Nice arm
That’s a baseball
That’s not impressive with a baseball but with a football he’s a super hero
*They both
That's a little key nerf ball
Dang.... Sign this boy up👍
😂🤣😂🤣👎🏻
More like MLB. No one would dare run home on a fly out..
wtffffffff amazing throw
Obviously that’s not a regulation size ball.
Both of them man cought it one handed and the other patty mahomes it
Chicago bears needs you
It was a baseball lol
Both of them need to
Bruh both of em need to be scoutted
300ft isn't far, I played long toss from home to dead center all day 405ft
If anyone comes into the league. That can throw a football like that. Get that QB maximum protection oh yeah you do need wide receivers
That’s a baseball idiot let’s see him through a football that far
Just because you got an arm don’t mean he’s fit to be in the nfl
Isn't that a baseball?
........
So the WR or the QB
He’ll lead the league in incompletions
Bro that’s not a joke that is 110 yards jeez
Is that a baseball? I could do that no problem
Just because he can throw a ball really far?😂😂😂😂😂
Except they don't use easy to throw baseballs in football.
Both of them
Baseball and football are very much different so I’m not sure how he would do.
Bet a pigskin wouldn't go 50
I don't care what he threw that was awesome 👏
That was a baseball……
The Ukrainians should hire him to throw rocks at the Russians
Its just a baseball!!  Not a football dork...
That’s Clark Kent
Wow 😯
The throw or the catch .. equally impressive
Or baseball?...seeing how that's what he threw.
Bro being able to throw the ball far means shit in the sport...  This is why throwing this far in a game is called a hail Mary because it's anyone's ball after it leaves the QB hand....l but it's extremely impressive....
When we tell our parents that we are bored, how do they want us? :  Me and my friends are really for no reason:
😳
Throwing a baseball is way different than throwing a football.
Looks like a nerf ball that will travel  far with one throw
Nope, that receiver's head would have knocked off by the time that ball reached. Accurate passing is the name of the game.
The MLB maybe
He threw a baseball
It's way easier to throw a baseball then a football he could probably throw the football like a good 50 60 yard so better then big ben
Football fusion be like:
Ummm... MLB, maybe? That IS a baseball... NOT a football 😂
Whats mfs in middle school expected to be like when they played football at pe and told their friend “go long”
How is the not cap
I have a freakishly strong arm too. When I was 13 I had to throw a softball as far as I could from inside one football field endzone. The coach was standing at the opposite 30 yd line. I told him to move back and he laughed at me... so I threw it into the woods behind the other endzone. I made the team instantly, lol.
They both do 😳
Nothing special.
That’s actually a horrible long distance throw for baseball. Yea he made the distance, which is impressive, but it took too long. If you ever watch the great outfielders throwing to home or third without a cutoff, it will almost always be on a line or small arc, not this huge bell curve.
Cleveland is ALWAYS in the market for a QB!
😲🤯😲🤯😲🤯😲🤯
That’s a baseball boy
Which one
Lol yessss
Hope he didn’t learn2choke from singin’frog🎩                                                                       🎼🐸
Lmao NFL 😂 NIGGA THATS A BASEBALL FUH
DAAAAAMN!!!!!!
That was a baseball... but still... WTF-
So what did he throw?......
Wasted talent
He should be in the NFL for throwing a.......baseball?
He isn't throwing a football though!?
When your crush sees u
The kid ran 15 yards before launching it couldn’t do that on the field
So not throwing a football yet needs to be in the NFL?
Cap
Which one is my question
First off I can throw that far. Yay me. That being said this person does have a good arm but sadly with a football he PROBABLY can’t throw as far and lastly he missed the end zone. Thank you, that concludes my Ted Talk.
Bro baseball at football field
He would do less with a football as it’s bigger and catches more wind to slow it down and prevent it
Lol football and baseball are to different sports
I think 🤔 he has a arm!!!!!! I think.
https://youtu.be/n7bqM6ibDHg
It is way different throwing a football and throwing a baseball they have aerodynamic differences
Baseball
Must be one of them baby sized footballs lol
That’s a baseball
All D1 college outfielders can do this.  Take a look at what the pros can do
But that's not a football
I love Wiffle Ball.
What the actual fuck
U mean NBl….
“You ain’t gotta lie to kick it! Actin like you down dog”
that throw was crispy af
Is that real
That’s a baseball
Um, I was doing that at 16 with a baseball….
He won't be able to throw a football as far
Which one
That’s not that difficult tbh it’s just a baseball a football wouldn’t go half that most likely
It was a baseball lmao throw it on a rope and not so high then itd be impressive 🥱
Who needs to be ????  The guy throwing or the guy catching 🤔
Baseball and football don't match together that much considering that the balls are different shaped and has many other ways to throw each of the type
Lol complete luck if you can’t do it 3 times in a row
Nothing like a good Ole game of "long toss"
I love how americans can blow out of proportion a simple movement of throwing a ball from point A to point B. I mean, this is a basic hand eye coordination each person has, if ever practiced a ball game. In football (or soccer, for the americans) a goalkeeper executes such a throw couple of times per game. Nobody stops the game to hold a community meeting about it.
If only it where a football
They both do 🤣
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
That's a baseball.. still he throws meteorites
Look out Tom Brady!
Is he or is he not the irl version of Deku ?
Nobody doing that with a football but with a baseball I bet I could throw a baseball 100 yards lol
Everyone is this comment section: Holy he has a heck of a arm he should be in the NFL Me: How has no one realized that its a baseball? Like you could hear the ball hit the other dudes glove 😂
When coach said you gotta earn your spot on my field  😂😂😂😂
Is that a football?
Normal for 16 year old high level baseball.
I made 2 shots :D
Thats a baseball not a football
With a baseball is a lot easier
Damn skittles popped outta that rainbow. Put it on a line son, would be more impressive. 110yrds, 330 ft, meh, alot of strong arm hs kids can do that.
😮
imagine if you didn’t catch it😬😑
As a wide receiver, did you see that one handed catch?
Both of them do
which one
That looks fake
No never 👎
Dude, I don't know why people are debating this haha. A football weighs around 16 ounces. A baseball weighs about 5. And a football is less aerodynamic than a baseball. So, NO he most certainly cannot do this with a football.
yo wht
Damn he's got a fucking arm
For throwing a baseball?
For the record home boy prolly throws low to mid 90’s with that distance.
Which one?
....but that's a baseball
100 yard throw with a baseball isn't that hard....The camera distance and height of his throw make it look more impressive than it is...if you can throw a ball, go try it.
Sheesh
Bro they both need to be in the nfl
i know i can easily throw a baseball 100 yards did it when i was around 12
No
Except that's a baseball
Bro sent it to Jesus he understood the assignment
YESSSS 😊😊😊👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼💯💯💯💯💯❗❗
Stronger arm than Tom. Brady🏈🏈🏈
bro caught it w/ one hand
Yeah he does
Not me think it would go through the field posts
Fr
bro, that's a baseball.
That has to be edited
Me: who can barely throw a ball a couple feet
Which one
Them both need to be
Oh yes ,he needs to b playing professionally as we speak. That arm on him oh boy 😳
Good throw. That's like the distance a baseball player with a strong arm throws.
I can do that and I’m literally 10years old
Not bad for a hs kid but that's about it. MLB would have that on a rope. He threw it 300ft
Hold shi that throw is mad
Why isn’t he??
82ish MPH translates to the length of the football field depends on your spin rate.
One hand!!!!!!!
sheesh 1 qb and wr ez
Hes long tossing we do this in baseball to get our arms stronger
No mames we ese we tiene poderes casi 100 metros asea no mames
MLB recruiters: no, mine
Deku irl
“He needs to be in the NFL” Me: which one Odell over there one handed catch while this mane threw a entire football field away. 👁👄👁
But he threw a baseball. They don't use baseballs in the NFL. MLB is more accurate
The not a football?
That's a 110 yd (330ft) baseball throw. Many college outfielders and pitchers do this as long toss practice.
No lol
Which one
I never understood how its possible to throw something that far. It must be some kind of physics-based technique.  Some kids in school are able to throw balls so hard and with such a spin that they fly in a straight line. I have no idea how to pull that off.
They both need to 😂😂😈
HOLY SHIT ... they both need to be in the nfl
But wasnt dat a baseball?
I was 15 years old making that throw.
That's a baseball
That catch wad equally as good.
Wtf was that👀
They both need to be in the NFL that one heck of a through and catch
That a baseball foo
He can throw a football proly 40 yards
He is cold 🥶 🥶🥶
Both of them
A baseball's a lot easier to throw far than a football let's make sure that's established
Which one
Me and my friend used to be able to do this in 4th and 5th grade at recess but not no more
Only someone who has never thrown a baseball or a football would ask that question
Dam that’s crazy 😝
People really are dumb af… ⚾️ vs 🏈 smfh
No
I could throw a baseball through the uprights from there. No big deal
That’s edited
That man no that legend there a 113 yard throw
I can throw that high and far
Hes literally hacking..
They*
they both need. to. go
Yo turned into one punch man
Pls
Me thinking it was a football
Fr
Have him join the raiders
It’s easy to catch a rainbow from that high with one hand
Wtf 😳
It was a baseball. Now do that with a guy on 3rd and burn him at home. That would be impressive.
He has unlocked  bazooka X-factor
When the girl you crushing on is in the stands watching
Oh this is a baseball how disappointing
Witch one the one who throw it or cot it
Thor catching his hammer be like:
That was nice
They both do 💪🤩😀Philly cheesesteaks
Which person
Everybody sees a football field and they assume he plays football lol
That’s a baseball stupid, not a football I need to be in the American baseball league or the national base ball league Not the NFB.
He probably a pitcher
That was a baseball it’s a lot different to throw, he could throw that far with a football
Actually, that kind of length on overhand is wild. With the same force, in underhand, he could clear 1.5 times that distance easily.
Fucking no
Ok what about the dude who 1 handed that mf
Could he do this in the NFL? LOL. There’s no stupid questions, just stupid people.
He? BOTH
That was a soccer ball and secondly that wasn't a regulation rim and the guy who caught it was playing tennis for the Huston oilers.
Not to be a idiot, but a Baseball isn't the same as a Football That was a huge throw but with a Football the aero won't be the same
A whole yard?
Witch person should be because he trough it far but the guy cought it one handed
More like MLB brah
Bro that’s a baseball
It’s a nerf ball
Definitely a GREAT arm!!!! Now do another video with a football and you will be getting a whole bunch of phone calls.
He’s going to the pros no question
His arm is better than Tom Brady
My dude caught it one handed!?!?
He is going to be one someday😌
Wow
That’s a baseball bud
Was that a baseball or a football?
Son of a bitch, that was awesome!
A baseball isnt full of air.
I can throw a golf ball across a race track. I’m ready for the F1.
Which one?
What a fucking arm holy shit
Honestly i don’t think y’all know how baseball works, but that’s one HELL OF A RAINBOW and in baseball u never throw like that. And mathematically speaking that wouldn’t even work with a football because footballs have NO mass and a baseball is like rock hard so  physically it would go faster. So speaking as a Person that is bored so that’s why there taking the time to write this right now, but I really don’t think this would work. Nice throw though      - also how do u even get an audience like that?????
This doesn’t translate to throwing a football
Which one?
No
Simply no.
Look at how straight that ball came out that far
Wich one
Well then it needs to go out to the NFL and find out
No he could not
Ya
GOD DAM POV YOUR JESUS IN THE NFL
Private, your job is to throw grenades and that is all you'll be doing. Here's a case of 100.
Dange
Many good HS baseball outfielders can throw like this.  Football doesn't travel as far. But John Elway could throw a football 90yds.
POV: ur playing catch with ur older brother
How did the man just catch the ball one-handed like that.
Which one
I can that to easy
It’s fake I seen the original video
Wooooh
He does need to play foot ball
OK Fuck Aaron Rodgers We Need This Guy On The Grean Bay Packers
I feel like while it is a baseball, people are ignoring that the play area is 360 feet in length and that’s a bit more than it! This is an absolutely huge throw and only top percenters can do this distance!  Bravo to this guy with the cannon!!
New oufeilder for the yankees
Why would he need to be in the nfl throwing a baseball ? How about he should be in mlb
Now imagine how far someone like hicks or chapman could throw…
Guy throws baseball…. “He ShOuLd Be PlAyInG fOoTbAlL”!!!
He aint going to the NFL. hes going to the Army.
How!
The answer would be no baseball and football are different the size of the ball his hands may not be able to grip the football right hand size and. Grip
Sheesh
Yeah he should be in baseball not football
Mlb
Great throw butane football is alot bigger and u have to throw a  tight spiral to maybe throw it that far...
Guy: throws a baseball Everyone: NFL
Or the MLB considering they're the same sport.
Both of em need to be drafted
I’m “69”th to comment!!! 🤩🤩🤩
This man made Ginny’s world record seriously
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Baseball players won't make it
Nigga said he should be in the NFL; I can personally tell you throwing a baseball does not mean your goin to be able to throw a football worth a shit 😂
He needs to be in the NFL because he can throw a baseball ⚾️ makes sense 🙄
It’s a baseball ⚾️ try a football 🏈 bet it won’t be the same!
That’s why he plays outfield
Throwing a football is different in many ways vs throwing a baseball so I doubt he would do it with a football, hell I've never even seen an NFL quarterback do that. Nice arm though.
Imagine a Hail Mary 😂
Lmao, he can’t do that with a Football, pretty sure a lot of people can throw a Baseball 90+ yards
Wich one
And that's because his crush was filming
Baseball and football completely different
That's a base ball what do you think
What an arm💪💪
Nice montage
At football and a baseball are 2 different shapes sizes and weights
Or a pitcher
.. talented
That’s baseball not football….
What a throw
Mf I actually thought it was a football at first 😤😅
I think they both should be. I play softball and that throw was literally 100x better than my pitch!
The 2nd Patrick mahomes
No football its heavy compaired to a baseball different grip yo
Literally everyone with a ball at recess:
He can throw a football a good 25 yards Fam accurate
Fuck yeah I'll take three on that all day 🤣🤣🤣 long ass lob
No baseball has a different throwing form
the hang time
Fake
That has to be a world record omg
It's only 300ish feet. Really not that hard.
They both do
Ikr
I could throw further
I can definitely throw a baseball this far… a football on the other hand I can throw about 60 yards max. Just not being able to completely wrap my hand around it and the size make it a lot harder
Um don’t think nfl use those
not taking abt the dude who caught it w one arm?
Wow
Olympics for javelin 115 to the ground
Clearly MLB
Forget football. MLBs got a new center fielder.
They both gotta join
Yeah cause they let you take those 12 step approaches all the time.  He'd have 2 broken legs after the first play.
HOLY FU-
Witch one
Thats a small ball
Easy with a baseball, but not NFL at all. maybe minor leagues
That’s close to a 400ft throw that very impressive
aight bruh
"beautiful shooting star"
Damn!!!
To be fair, I could probably catch that, and so could most people, overly impressed, if you tried you could do the same
I thought it was a football at first
More like MLB
How I expect my players to play in madden:
It’ll never happen again
A vortex football
Dangg.
That’s a travel
The guy catching it … I know right 😂
Holly crap
That was a baseball but if he could do that with a football then you could probably beet the longest throw in nfl history and be 5 times popular than Kurt Warner and Joe Montana  (Edit) all I did was mention two football legends and I get this much likes, speaking of them, my dad actually met Joe Montana and Joe told him about his time and how he is completely messed up from the way he played and getting sacked.
That’s a baseball bruh it’s a lot easier to throw a baseball that far vs a football
First of all that was a baseball
Throwing rainbows like that would get us benched immediately, weak arm.
I don’t think the nfl can handle hime
I can do that with a softball but not a football
No they should both play in the nfl
I.. couldn’t even throw a 15th of that distancw
👌
Whaaaaaaat
More like MLB
Gg he won my respect
Mfer.. that’s a baseball
For real
Both of them
This dude could easily kill you 😭🙏
he has a good arm
Here before this blows up
That’s not no base ball that’s a  bird
When you play football with your dad.
Great throw with a baseball but the two don’t necessarily translate
That was a baseball
Izuku midoriya:...WHAT!?!?
What an arm
