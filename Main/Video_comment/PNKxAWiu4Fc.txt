this songs feels like a hug
3:08🔥🔥🔥
Leah this was our song🪐
After three long years, I can finally say that I moved on.
Getting the boyfriend experience 🫶😭
Conan Gray Tutto bene
It's one of his best songs ever
Conan te amo mucho
3:00 🎇
Conan I’m watching this 4 years later (3rd time watching) you are so adorable and sweet! 💗 Conan your amazing sweetie 💗💗💗💗 I love your music so much and your voice is so beautiful and sweet 💗
he had us all parasocial with this video lmao
so anyone here after red rocks...
🧜
THIS VIDEO HAS ME IN A CHOKEHOLD...  Like I didn't even know there was a music video for astronomy until now
This music video feels like a mix between night changes by one direction and wife that dies at the beginning of the movie and I'm all here for it
It’s so hard to have favorite music videos when it comes to Conan because they’re all so amazing, but this is top tier
Is it just me or.......he reminds me so much of Sirius Black😂
I'm in love with this beautiful creature.
This man is poetry in motion
just HOW lucky the cameraman is😭😭😭
4 years after, astronomy is my fav song
The POV 🫦😅 ( this is satire, sort of)
conan was really crashing at the end
“whats ur fav horror movie?” oh, idk, probably this. 😔😰😭🫶
lagu2 nya Conan Gray kayak lagu2 Coldplay sebelum album Viva La Vida, buaguss rekk, belum lagi suaranya khas bangetm tipe suara yang effortless,  bagus enak didengar
Absolutely beautiful lyrics. Truly  a great artist.
Why is this MV so sweet😭
Conan lee gray you were the only one singer who calmed my anxiety with your songs. So thank you so much. You’re the special one.
I just can't define the beauty of this song by words
❤️❤️
Such a shame that it only got 13 million views
2:29 his face looks like a angel❤❤❤
Please explain this in Gen X terms… please 🙏 I love the song ❤
We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought, if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done) We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart Stop trying to keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop trying to keep us alive You can't force the stars to align when they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart

Conan, if you make an MV, you don't need to make it expensive and exciting. Just something like this makes me smile until my cheeks ache😭💗
Er det noen fra Norge?

So like this is on yt kids💀"with runaway fathers and mothers who DRANK" WHY CONAN?!?? (Luv u ❤😘🤟)
i listen to this every time I grieve for people I lost; not to death but to circumstances
it's 2025, felt like they shoot a bullet to your heart. damn his prime
Her şeyden yorulduğum zaman kulağımda çalan bir şarkısın.
:(
tell me how to get out of that song this is the most beautiful thing my ears have ever heard.
This song just hits so hard. Everything about it is too relatable, it's just AHH! Stop Conan, it's too good!  I'm going to cry 😢
Silly :3
i adore conan gray :3
Conan❤❤
Mi himno.😢
We two wolds a part:))
:))))) we two was a part
conan lee gray the man that you are
this is the best music video i've ever seen
I love Conan's music sm😭😭😭💜💜💜💜
2:56 this part is astronomically divine
I really want a happy song from him ...because I'm listening to his family line,yours , astronomy , memories on a loop ....now i'm really sad and don't know why ....I just love his voice can't help it but at the same time I really feel like he is depressed .
Not me screaming “I LOVE YOU!!!” Aggressively at my phone to him😭
Love the dude and his music. He's so talented and just amazing. I don't blame teenagers for listening to hus music to escape reality. His songs give teenagers or people in general the ability to express through music
I love you
I CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE HOW GORGEOUS AND BREATHTAKING PRETTY THIS MV IS😭😭
i love the bass part in this song sm
This and memories are the best songs ever made .
I know the songs kinda sad, but the camera man's lucky laying in bed with Conan, like- its my turn. MOVE OVER
if I was where connana was I would love him like theres no tomorrow 😁
I’m so excited and I’m doing this song for my aerial silks routine for my next showcase!
this mv is everything one could ask for. i keep rewatching just for the feels.
2:53  AEAEAEAAEAEA🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"young love doesn't last for life" Conan I felt that😭🎀
Who came here for the coffin guys song?
An advert of this song coming out came up on Snapchat when I was like 12 or 13 and the chorus of this song stuck with me until I listened to the full song. Now I’ve stayed up until midnight for 2 album releases bcz his music never disappoints. Conan needs AOTY
This song is so beautiful. I can't stop listening 💜
Love 😍
I think I had a gay panic
this might be the best song
This was my top #2 song on Spotify wrapped 2024....ummm not surprised, i literally fw this song. Astronomy is such a warm hug for me >>
Wow this is really good 😮
1:15 FROM SATURN TO MARS IS PERFECTTTT
The second watch got me. I'm crying now, thanks Conan.
Wait is this the same set as the story
mooi nr x x x
that camera man dosent understand how lucky he is😭😭😭
Thanks for your SONG  GOD bless everyone  Barakallah fiikum 😂😂❤❤❤❤
remember me from middle school?
Here in 2024 🥹
THIS IS LIKE THE POV OF THE GIRL IN AUGUST BY TAYLOR SWIFT
This is literally my fav song 😭
mi momento esquizo llegó
hearing this live in Amsterdam was life changing
Just imagine a song with Olivia Rodrigo and Conan Gray OMGGGG
I want to be the camera.
Wow everything about this is perfect
Such underrated song
"You can't force stars to align when they already died"
Conan having the time if his life in nature is a ✨vibe✨
WORLDS APART? WALLOWS REFERENCE?!
I love this song, but I can't listen to this without hearing 'its ass tronomy' now 🥲🥲🥲
NO BC WHY DID I THINK THE WAS ABOUT BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA
songwriting is on another level—true artistry
Does anyone know the brand/ model of the pickup truck?
I relate to this song way too much <3
1:30 is giving Charlie from heart stopper <3
0:35 “ He WaS a FaIrY” 👁️👄👁️
Conan siempre sabe como me siento <3
mi cancion fav
I was brought here by a stars align edit
Its so crazy to me that Conan doesn't think he's attractive
Lovely. A nother weird Conan in bed acting nastily sexy music video. Ok.
Why is this song so good 😅
amo vc
I just went to your concert yesterday and it was more than amazing as it always is. And, that was not coincidence!!
Amo   tu    canción favorita ❤
❤❤❤❤
🤍
Astronomy: “We’ve dieeeeed” The Exit: “we buried alive something that never died”
❤❤❤❤
Compare him from 2022 to present day
Can just have a big ole hug from this beauty im looking at
NOOOO, MI CANCIÓN😭😭😭😭
I love smmmm this video ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ethereal is perfect way to describe this ❤
I feel like I’m on a date with Conan 😅
0:55 0:57 0:57 0:58 0:58 0:58 0:58
❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
He ripped out a fuckng WALL h
Bro this song hurts cuz he’s literally staring at u the whole time I actually felt guilty 😭
I don't know why I'm crying my eyes out to this song, it just really hit me so hard deep inside, and for me I think this song is for the two people who fall out of love, because they're cannot reach each other no matter how they tried, it's just not meant to be.
This music is always lit
this one isnt funny 😔
Yes I agree! He is freaking adorable! Sweet and honest! Love him to pieces!
2024?
This masterpiece will be my fav forever
Coming back here because I started bawling while screaming to song at Found Heaven Tour
So true i when I look at him 🥵
bro 2:14 has me kicking my feet and giggling every time🤭🤭
Every song of his is a masterpiece! It sings the emotion itself
*stops climbing tree and starts twerking*
I can't stop listening now I'm obsessed 😭❤️
I am crying and listening constantly
My boyfriend just told me that he has degenerative brain problems and has started to have trouble recognizing people, so he's leaving to Colorado to be taken care of by his family, I can't go with him, and he can't stay here anymore. I love him and want him to be happy, but I know I'll probably never see him again in my life... Thank you for all the love you always gave me,  You are the love of my live, God bless you.
This is one of my favorite songs.
Crying my heart out without reason at 12 midnight 😅❤
sublime, your talent is unparalleled.
This is a song I Know age well😊
Hearing it live in 142 days ☹️💜💜
Te amo muitão 🥺😍
MV screamed imagine Conan as you love of you life <33.
جملة تقتلني فعلاً  "young love don’t last for life "
🤍
He makes me think of the guy I like so much idk why tho
I'm here in the Found Heaven Era. Just exploring the previous discography! <3 This song is so pretty! Good Job, Conan. So far, "Superache" is an awesome album for me! Also, Miss Piggy?
I love conan so much. I loved listening to Troye during my teenage years (blue neighborhood & bloom), and after that I switched to Conan. Conan's style and voice makes me feel nostalgic of my teenage adventures specifically exploring my identity.   conan is my coming of age movie theme song
Happy three years of astronomy!!
I actually want this song at my funeral ❤ ILYSM CONAN❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😲😲😲😲🧐🧐🧐
This song reminds me of my breakup with my boyfriend - we ended on good terms, it was for our own good, and we still see each other, yet I can sense that we both miss each other... 😔
masterpiece
Play this song when I die
hit amigo
bro him lying on his bed screaming the lyrics is me all day fr
الاغنيه بتفكرني بيكي..

Every time I need to cry, it is this video I come back to.
The wolfstar this gives is killing me
Can we keep this point of view
I'm playing this during an aclipse

I lost my bestfriends a few months ago, and I´m still feeling like this song. If the 2 of you find this comment I hope u know that ily forever and this one it´s now yours too.
That's a lot of emotion
This song sounds like something that would be played in space. soo pretty 😌
I've never heard this song before, but I knew every lyric
This was a my lovesong
I accidentally disliked and i by instinct in miliseconds went back and liked it
사랑스럽다...
2:28 whatcha doing there Conan?
what an absolute masterpiece my god!
this whole mv just proves that conan would/will be a top tier boyfriend
If the dust within the air can be count, it will be how much i love conan gray❤
Lyrics   We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought, if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done) We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart Stop trying to keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop trying to keep us alive You can't force the stars to align when they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
Desde el fondo de mi corazón hubiera deseado que lo nuestro funcionará Jessica, para mí siempre fuiste tu.
If no one understands you, dw Conan does....
It’s so true
conan, you songs help me cope with my problems thank u so much
Listening to this song makes me feel like I was born in the wrong decade. Almost offing myself 😂
‏‪2:30‬‏  all this time I thought it 😭😭😭😭was Jimin who sang it
live, laugh, love conan gray !!
conan, esta canción la escuchaba desde q salio y nunca habia estado cn nadie, y ahora la escucho despues de digamos primera relacion fallida
it's time to go 😞
a girl that was very close to me said today, that this is our song... today would have been our 4 month anniversary since we've been boyfriend and girlfriend... But that's not how it is, and it hurts so bad... Especially when i think about her all the time and still love her so much.
CONAN IS SO MAGICALLY DELICIOUS!
اخخخ دي الاغنيه دايما تنجح انها تخليني انهار بالاخص الجزء لما يقول "Stop tryna keep us alive, You’re pointing at stars in the sky , That already died
Two worlds apart alright: I'm just trying get vito to Pluto 🤦🏼‍♀️
Conan your music has changed me so much. I love your music. I can always turn on your music and find relatable lyrics all the time one of my friends lost her battle to cancer and I miss her so so much. I can always turn on your music. And it just makes me feel calm.  And at peace. That I will be able. To see her. Again. 1 day. I  love you so much Conan❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
somos dos mundos diferentes
BU ŞARKIYI BENİM EN SEVDİĞİM ŞARKIIII I WANNA BE SAWEDDD CONAN DİNLEYEN TÜRK YOK MU YA
Conan, aún me haces llorar con esta canción y creo que así será siempre.
This song feels like a dead end love story. And i cry everytime i imagine it
I love that this starts out as:  Let's go have fun with Conan!  Then it devolves into:  Crap, Conan's having a psychotic meltdown again.
This is too underrated ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What was that like podcast brought me here.
This music video is what I watch when I’m sad. It looks like he’s taking us on a few different dates and it just brings me so much comfort so thank you Conan for helping a seventh grade girl get through middle school ❤
The only mistake that we didn't make,was run~
“You can’t force the stars to align when they already died”  dead stars far away still seem alive to us because it takes a long time for light to travel
I love this song
LYRICS  We drive through the woods rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us. Cause socially speaking we were the same with runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time young love dont last for life Now I know now I know Its time to go Its time to go home We've traveled the seas we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems that you want my heart Its astronomy we're two world apart (its astronomy) We're two worlds apart (its astronomy) Two worlds apart From far away I wish I stayed with you But here face to face a stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (now look what we've done) We've traveled the seas we've ridden the stars we've seen everything from Saturn to Mars as much as it seems that you want my heart its  astronomy we're two worlds apart Stop tryna keep us alive you're pointing at stars in the sky that already died stop trying to keep us alive you cant force the stars to align when they have already died oh we've died oh we've traveled the sea we've been in the stars we've seen everything from Saturn to Mars as much as it seems like you want my heart its astronomy we're two worlds apart
I have heard this song for the first time and it finnaly makes me feel like how I felt when I saw the beauty of Astronomy. Astronomy didn't felt like that for little time but after hearing this song I feel just like I saw the beauty of Astronomy again as I saw in its most beautiful state which was at the start of learning and thinking about Astronomy. Thankyou alot for this song it finnaly awoke that feeling
We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought, if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done) We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart Stop trying to keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop trying to keep us alive You can't force the stars to align when they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart

Es tan hermosoooo❤❤
MY MANZZZZ
3:03 If you ever listened to this song and remembered me , like I did  I just wanted to tell you that you were really my fav person and I would’ve loved a dead star if this star was you.. Ra
With every person I feel like we are just two world apart but you owe my heart ...
I literally have nothing to say, this song is perfect.
I may be able to get over her one day not today but one day I think I’ll be okay I’ll be able to be happy without her again
We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life  And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go  We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart  From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought, if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done)  We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  we're two worlds apart  Stop trying to keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop trying to keep us alive You can't force the stars to align when they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh  Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
It's so crazyyyyy, I'm crying how beautiful you are ❤
🤍
I used to think this guy was crap but this is good 😂😂
Quiero ser fotógrafa de conannnnn🥴😭😭😭😭😭😭
This song feels way too close to my life right now. It's so far from anything I'd usually listen to, but it hits just as hard for me as the train kid folk punk I'm used to
This song resonates to how I feel about my greatest love leaving me, I'm forcing the stars to align that already died, I miss you but all I can do right now is to miss you, pls always keep in my mind that I will always love you B.
that song was amazing
It's astronomy 1:33
This mv is my fav evverrrr it always makes me feel so much better I love you conan :(
the feeling this song always gives me 💔
Conducimos por el bosque, barrios ricos para observar. We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch  Bromeamos mientras mirábamos que eran demasiado buenos para nosotros. We joked as we looked that they were too good for us  Porque socialmente hablando, éramos iguales 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same  Con padres y madres fugitivos que bebían With runaway fathers and mothers who drank  Una historia vieja como el tiempo, el amor joven no dura toda la vida. A tale old as time, young love don't last for life Y ahora lo sé, ahora lo sé And now I know, now I know  Es hora de ir, es hora de ir It's time to go, it's time to go Hemos viajado por los mares, hemos montado en las estrellas. We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars  Hemos visto de todo, desde Saturno hasta Marte. We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars  Por mucho que parezca que eres dueño de mi corazón As much as it seems like you own my heart  Es astronomía, estamos a dos mundos de distancia. It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart estamos a dos mundos de distancia we're two worlds apart  (Es astronomía) estamos a dos mundos de distancia (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart Desde lejos, desearía haberme quedado contigo From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you  Pero aquí, cara a cara, un extraño que una vez conocí But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew  Pensé que si vagaba, me volvería a enamorar. I thought, if I wandered, I'd fall back in love  Dijiste: "La distancia trae cariño", pero supongo que no con nosotros. You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us  El único error que no cometimos fue correr. The only mistake that we didn't make was run  (Ahora mira lo que hemos hecho) (Now look what we've done) Hemos viajado por los mares, hemos montado en las estrellas. We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars  Hemos visto de todo, desde Saturno hasta Marte. We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars  Por mucho que parezca que eres dueño de mi corazón As much as it seems like you own my heart  Es astronomía, estamos a dos mundos de distancia. It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart estamos a dos mundos de distancia we're two worlds apart Deja de intentar mantenernos vivos Stop trying to keep us alive  Estás apuntando a estrellas en el cielo que ya murieron. You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died  Deja de intentar mantenernos vivos Stop trying to keep us alive  No puedes forzar a las estrellas a alinearse cuando ya han muerto You can't force the stars to align when they've already died  Oh, hemos muerto, ooh-oh-oh Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh Oh, hemos viajado por los mares, hemos cabalgado las estrellas Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars  Hemos visto de todo, desde Saturno hasta Marte. We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars  Por mucho que parezca que eres dueño de mi corazón As much as it seems like you own my heart  Es astronomía, estamos a dos mundos de distancia. It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
I love you ❤

We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought, if I wanted, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done) We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart Stop trying to keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop trying to keep us alive You can't force the stars to align when they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
"we've seen everything from saturn to mars"
Love this song omg
we are two worlds apart
favorite song and artist!!!❤️
Conan is Underrateddd
young love don't last for life.
♡♡
Qué es lo que me haces sentir Conan diosmioo
3:41 Me listening to Superache
Que gran sentimiento transporta 💙
Every time I hear this song my mind travels to another dimension. Travel to Mars, Saturn, travel seas and stars and I just let myself go. It makes me happy, it saddens me, it excites me. I just love it. I will never get tired of listening to you Conan.
Here’s the lyrics!   We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought, if I wanted, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done) We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart Stop trying to keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop trying to keep us alive You can't force the stars to align when they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart

*The company should really put their brain into making good music video, adding some tricks instead of just relying on his amazing lyrics, voice and handsomeness only!*
What a beautiful song.
Dating in 8th grade be like
YOU RELATE???  It’s time to go We’ve traveled the seas We’ve ridden the stars We’ve seen everything from Saturn to Mars  As much as it seems Like you own my heart It’s astronomy We’re two worlds apart
it sounds truly amazing, hurts vm tho
3:00 - 3:38  FAVVVV
its gayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Qué fantasía despertar con un Conan a tu lado <3
I love this music video so much 🌹🌹
there were a million ways to die, but I chose this
His all songs are filled with all emotion and reality. It's very hard to find such beautiful songs at today's time. I just love this guy I don't know why and just after listening his 3 songs he have became my inspiration.
Feliz 2 anos Astronomy e feliz 2 anos q entrei no fandom Conan, eu amo essa música com todas as minhas forças 🪐
Como AMO esta canción <3 Salió un 7 de mayo un día como hoy ;-;
2 years and im still astronomically twerking
happy 2nd birthday astronomy lolol
we r still here at our comfort zone conan💗
this song fills me with a deep sadness but I think it just brings out the repressed feelings of yearning for idealised love I can't have
"we're two worlds apart" literally we are companions separated by life and death😔
Oh we’ve died...🎶
I cried listening and singing this song after listening to it for so many times. Me and my bsf got into an argument and now it can never be the same again. I see her in school and I’d think of the fun times we had. I’d see her in so many things that reminded me of our time spent tgt. This song encapsulates how I feel and ive finally been able to truly relate to it especially after finally mustering the courage to say hi and stuff. I have pointed stars that already died for a while and now I know it’s astronomy, we’re two worlds apart.  Edit: it’s been about a month plus after that and I dearly miss her. She seems to be moving on and getting closer to her other friends (and I’m happy for her) However, I wish that I could have done things differently back then, “If I only I’d stayed with you” (literally cus I chose to get off the train and if I hadn’t, things wld be rlly diff) I have gotten closer to my other friends and my new bsf but I get flashbacks and reminders around every corner.
I thought only I liked CG music. 🥺
keep it💘💕
This also speaking for friend right? Like the people that u used to close about, share stories, feels like home. But as time passes by, we're just being stranger each others.
WHY IS IT SO SAD :(( IK THE MENING BUT THE SONG:((((
When you compare your birth charts and it was saying “you are match made in heaven” but guess what it’s just astronomy and we’re two worlds apart
Mom! He’s flirting with his phone again
sometimes, i really wanna crack the myths and mistaken curse of stereotype mindsets for we deserve to face forward on mirror upfront our present self.
This song makes me feel calm, as if everything around me disappeared and only this will be heard, beautiful song Conan ❤
This song is basically about loosing your bestie
3:09
Why this guy always makes me cry with every song?
We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought, if I wanted, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done) We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart Stop trying to keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop trying to keep us alive You can't force the stars to align when they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
I love Kim Dokja
He is riding the same vehicle, which he had hitchhiked in the 'Story' m/v.  Is there a hidden meaning of him getting to control his life or its just coincidence?
❤
yu are aesthetic (too much ) :)
man i literally love every song of yours
it's beautiful :)
I come back here way too often. My fav person and my absolute favourite song in the universe. ILL ALWAYS BE IN LOVE WITH YOU AND ASTRONOMY CONAN ❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🌌🌌
VERY VERY VERY VERY UNDERRATED ❤
damn I got goosebumps
I love Conan gray <3
This song feels like jo and laurie
Do this for a 15
Conan te amo
este video me recuerda a una seccion de fotos que tuvo tym<3
“ so it’s like drugs?” “It’s better than drugs Jeremy “
I wanna eat Conans hair
his voice makes me feel so strong emotions
it's time to go.
my favorite mv 🥹 feels like i'm in a tragic love story 😭❤️
My 8 years niece just fell asleep listening to this.. Proving how Soothing conan's voice are. First time seeing this happened
❤️
It’s astronomy we’re two worlds apart 💔
If you like this song  👇🏻like
maybe this is the closure that i needed
Today is the first time I heard this song and it captured my heart. Feels like watching a movie! I listened thru Spotify. Had to search it in YT so I can express my appreciation to this creation. You are amazing! ❤
As an Astronomy nerd, I can confidently say every time I go stargazing with my telescope, I’m listening to this song, it’s magical.
i fell in love with girl whos in love with other girl. thats weird, but i could do anything she wanted to, although we knew each other really short time. then she started relationship with her love. hope is stupid. thanks for made song i could cry with.
❤
2023💖
why is conan so fine tho
he’s so babygirl
2 years ago, I fell in love with a boy that has nothing to envy others. He was smart, cute, so kind and he was the first boy to show me how it felt to be loved since a longgggg time. I thought he was the one, I thought he knew me in every possible way, I trusted him but in the end he wasn’t this nice boy anymore. All the things he said, all the things he did were just an illusion that was real in my head but not in his. You can not know how your life is destroyed after such an event like that until you experience it. He broke out with me when my entire heart was him. He totally destroyed my vision of trust, life interest and love particularly. He made me turn into a new girl I didn’t like at all. I hate myself for a lot of things because of him. Like how could I ever love someone else now that I don’t even think that love is real or if it is, that I deserve it. He ruined my life, in every possible way. This song hits different every time I hear it because it reminds me of our relationship and of him. But this song is still one of my favorite because when you feel the memories when you’re listening, it is a good one. Thanks Conan for making this real.
😍😍😍
Why does this song describe my life
هذي الايام
this song is a masterpiece 4 life
The video goes from a perspective looks like he was alone that whole time  like he was the only one having feelings It's just beautiful and sad at the same time 🖤
To be in the presence of divinity.
Gençlik aşkları hayat boyu sürmezmiş gerçekten de bilerek mi verdin bu şarkıyı bize beni bırakıp gideceğin önceden belli miydi bu kadar mı kördüm
obsessed
I feel an indie magical song❤ love this
I dedicated this to one of my best friends/ best men that died. I miss u bro. We're two worlds apart. But I still feel u with me. Hopefully your lesson's stay with me. U was a true positive friend
I wanna be him so bad
Cried
Young love don’t last for life.
Can we just talk about how he was making videos of him playing with toys many, many years ago,  as a kid, and now he’s this wonderful person that can right music with a very strong meaning in every song, my opinion, Conan should be getting more  credit for what he does in the music industry, because his songs are wonderful 😊
my friend showed me this song- and I searched it up later and found out Conan gray sung it. <3 love him a little more each day
بيها ذكريات مؤلمه
بيها ذكريات مؤلمه
Why he love perform on d bed- under shower....something ....i just wondering behind his good voice
Gosh! Now I am falling harder...❤️
Every time he made a new song I’m thinking he can’t do better and every time he prove me wrong
I hope Conan knows how grateful we are for what he is doing. His music speaks to the heart of the listener because it's so beautiful and the lyrics are so true and honest. Conan, we love you so much. You're our therapist (in some way, yk). Thank you <3
We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life  And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go  We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart  From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought, if I wanted, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done)  We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  we're two worlds apart  Stop trying to keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop trying to keep us alive You can't force the stars to align when they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh  Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
Conan's all songs are relatable for me 🌼❤
🥰🥰
This is so perfect music. Thanks
Why this still underrated 🥲?
This song gives "right person wrong time" vibes
God made men and sent Conan as an apology
this song makes me cry every single time.
He is a great song lyricist period
It's my favourite, literally every time I hear it I get a great feeling
❤
tenho ciúmes dessa vaza daqui
me encanta las vibes de conan, tanto como esta cancion
Your so magical ❤️
But I think this is my favorite music vid by Conan.  Even though everything he makes is a masterpiece this song and the video captured so much emotion and meaning and is just the one of the best music vids I've ever seen.
Low-key fit Bella and Mattie
Bed time song 💭
My name is stars and i love being mentioned in the song ✨👄✨
Im loving this song so muchhhh ❤❤❤
We're two worlds apart.
I swear you'll always be special to me, Conan.
2022/11/12 i have an Arabic exam tomorrow and i'm listening to this song  🦋🦋  It's astronomy we're two worlds apart
it look like i am in love with him
beautiful lyrics
This music video is literally "pov: conan gray is your boyfriend"
This song feels like closure. I know it's sad, but it brings me comfort that after seeing that person face to face, you know it wasn't meant to be.
It sounds a lot like the Sparks song from Coldplay.
1:05 Conan is so adorable right here😭❤️
i always watch this to feel happy cause its like POV: ur dating conan, and then the end comes and hits me like a brick
I love you conan😭😭😭😭😭
Damn, this touched a nerve
2:59 ✨
I feel this song so much right now, I'm currently I'm a "long-distance "relationship, with the first person I've ever truly loved because he had to go to college, ofc we've tried multiple times on and off before, and each time it was never because of anything bad but now it just feels like we're both trying to keep the relationship alive because of how much time we've invested into this relationship. like a merry-go-round that we're afraid to get off of because we're scared of the repercussions of not being together.
🛌
This is a pretty,sad song... I always have it ringing in my mind when I'm sad
this has been my fav song for like 6 months now n i have never seen the music video until now.
awwww
tus canciones son hermosas
2:24 and 3:10
Am i an overly emotional easily replaceable over thinking dumb blonde who never got her shit together for crying at this
Cuando la escucho dan ganas de salir a caminar con esta canción de fondo, como si estuviera en una serie o película
I love this song! It's perfect  in words and nutes. Thank you Conan <3
damn it astronomy and never happening
Fell in love with this young man. Your voice is so beautiful.  💜💚❤️
he gives me  life
😿
love you Quing
Conan, tu música me da paz ❤️🇲🇽 eres lo máximo
te amo astronomy, sos lo mejor q me pasó en la vida.
Te amo mucho
I love you
I love you
I love how this song express the perfect balance of the pain of letting someone go and accepting that it's over. Like always, Conan made an incredible and beautiful song ♥️
I heard this song this year right after i had ended my situation ship, and every time i hear it it brings back those memories. especially the line that goes "i thought if i wondered i fall back in love kills me.
Want this music at my wedding party ❤️  Love from Uzbekistan 🇺🇿😊
HBD to someone who didn't communicate with me anymore "WE'RE TWO WORLDS APART "
Bunu izlerken kendimi rahatlamış hissediyorum sanki hiç bir derdim yokmuş gibi..Keşke conan ile yakın arkadaş olabilseydim eminim ki bu çok iyi hissettirirdi düşüncesi bile çok güzel hissetiriyor..
going back to this masterpiece every single day
indah banget,nangis.
his songs are comforting oh god!
im crying WHY HAVE I NEVER SEEN THIS
HES SO FUCKING PRETTY
This is the most gentle “fuck outta here bro” I’ve ever seen in my life
Aristotle and Dante's song
conan dont look at me like that! please
This song is so beautiful. Listening to this song and liking astronomy is like "WOU".
Not my cheeky smile rn. I must look mad goofy rn.
Still remember when I came across idle town back when he was putting music out there for fun. Look at him now🙏🙏
OMG, I came here just now after seeing a person mention him in the comments on Olivia's post! I had no idea he was this good. 🥺❤
is it me or this video carries a lot of loneliness ?
Pure genius. Love to write my romances to this guy. Can't get enough of his music. Such a mood-setter. :)
I cried like genuinely sobbed
He's..............i Lost words
the bridge is going to eat. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME
You deserve the world, Conan.
عشقي
I always try to find something perfect to say, then I remember that perfection is only another perception and when you call something by this world it's a word to put in the instant, the feelings, the magic... So I would say this song is perfect. In this instant I believe, I believe that I'm allowed not to care about everything and just live. I also believe in a wonderful thing called music. So after all of this, I wants to say... this is a beautiful song!
It’s been a year, this is still my old favourite and forever will be. I truly can’t describe how beautiful this song is…
💘💘💕
When I'm Lokey stimming to this song yet crying my eyes out.
If I was an artist and starred in a movie, this would be my ost.
playyy sejuta kali🥺☝️💖
😍
Its only me or this Song start like heather
1:25 💚💫🪐
This deserves,  >100m views
I absolutely love this music video
I jus love this song so much ....the voice is jus lovely..young love don't last for life...
This song is giving Mike Wheeler and Will Byers.
I just heard this song like 30 minutes ago and I’ve been listening to it on repeat since then
wisjj
This guy is just the meaning of perfection 😭
To be the person operating that camera
this is so relatable to me coz my best friend and I are growing apart and I know it's time to quit trying to keep us alive.. but it's so hard to let go.
Ashley has been Conan's best friend since 7th grade and the two have been great friends ever since. Conan wrote his song "Astronomy" about Ashley.
para satin to nak hehe :>
haziq
I never wanted to watch the music video of this song cause I liked it very much and I didn't want to ruin my imagination but this is everything I've imagined
This is one of those songs that sound sad but really beautiful : )
why is he so underrated his songs are the best
This my fav song now bye
After seeing this, im officially conan's girlfriend.
its just incredible, i swear. u make me cry everyday conan with ur powerful song lyrics i swear u r fantastic
I sent this to my ex friend and this was her reaction   Why u want to remind me   That we are two worlds are apart NOW and it's time to go As usual your song are sad and depressed  I was like- I have a murder on my mind
❤️👏
bu adamin sarkilarinin beni aglatmasindan biktim
0:26- Night Changes vibes✨
Lo amo
I’m taking my sisters kid and their friend to see this guy play in Chicago in September. I wasn’t expecting to dig the music this hard, but he’s giving Azure Ray/ early “The Format” vibes. The kids are alright.
la mejor canción de Conan Gray y no pienso discutirlo 🌌🔭
lo amo
kusursuzsun
cok seviyorum dostlar cok
a foyografa da tagujes??
2 words. just wow.
Explanations from Saturn to Mars? 🥺
Bae ily
when he says ur pointing at stars that already died hits so deep !
Beautiful!
agliyorum
Ahh soo good
I am very happily married but have briefly considered leaving my husband of 22yrs just so I can fully immerse myself in the astronomy bridge 😁. Perfect.
Trying to listen to Connon Gray and doing my bio homework at the same time is a losing game, it just turns into a full blown concert.  I have to choose what's best for my future,...sorry bio
the metaphors are incredible. one of my personal favorites from conan.
WoW!
Any Whovian’s thinking about Ten and Rose? Cause the lyric “we’re two worlds apart” hit me hard if you know what I’m talking about.
im still here
I love how this is filmed like the person watching the video is actually there with Conan and he's interacting with and singing directly to you. Though in reality, "we're two worlds apart".
Honestly knowing Conan writes his own songs is crazy because, songs this good sound like the take forever to write and multiple people to help! Keep up the good work Conan❤You make my day<3
This felt like we all dated him-    Art = him.
Such an amazing song
This music video is the same vibe as “wife who dies in the beginning of a movie”
Loml
too sad
fav song 😩😩😩
This song is seriously so underrated
Don't know what but it does some kind of magic to mee.. oh what a soulful music 🎶
There are no words for describing how perfect this song is🖤
I think there’s some people we need them now
I had made a girlfriend on a cruise in this teens room called social 100 and now that I am home, I realise that this is no home to me
I  was  a best friend to a boy who had a jealous girlfriend but I never had any intention of coming between them then one night something big happened he did something stupid but still I considered him my bestie then he told me its better if we stay friends my mom and friends told me he was toxic but I always stayed on his side I don't know what to do now ?
k triste
there’s just no way he made THIS and was never in a relationship.. i just don’t believe it
I'M CRYING
this is my favorite conan gray song but also how did he make an  xreader music video
i love this song and im just commenting this
I never knew how to answer when someone ask me my favorite song, but now I know
this is giving the wife who died in the movies
Camera man: 👁🫦👁
“Stop pointing at stars that already died” damn, that hit hard 😭
stop making me cry conannnn
this hits harder when thinking of a friendship.
Imagine waking up besides Conan.
feels
This song is a masterpiece 🥲
Antes de dormir escucho esto <3 is beautiful 🥀
" Young love don't last for life " Is VERY much relatable
Amooo❤️
I just realized something.  He's lipsynching to these sad lyrics about how he knows they can't be together, in these memories. Ykwim? He's either looking back and seeing how ig was doomed or he knew it was doomed in the moment and that's what he was thinking during those times.
W O W, what a great song 💕
ASTRONOMY IS ONE OF THE BEST CONAN GRAY SONGS I CANT STOP LISTENING TO IT LIKE PLS
TE AMO CONAN, GRACIAS POR TREMENDOS TEMAZOS!!!
This is one of the most calming sounding songs on my playlist, I remember first liking Kid Krow and saw that he posted this like a week ago, and I was so excited to listen and thought there might be a new album soon, and now it’s on superache, and this mv is like perfect for this song and it’s so beautiful
This is a girl writing but hes honestly attractive as.. xoxx
Lyrics: Conducimos por el bosque, vecindarios ricos para ver Bromeamos mientras mirábamos que eran demasiado buenos para nosotros Porque socialmente hablando, éramos iguales Con padres y madres fugitivos que bebían Un cuento antiguo como el tiempo, el amor joven no dura toda la vida Y ahora lo sé, ahora lo sé, es hora de irse, es hora de irse  Hemos viajado por los mares, hemos montado las estrellas Hemos visto todo desde Saturno y Marte Por mucho que parezca que eres dueño de mi corazón Es astronomía, somos dos mundos separados  (Es astronomía) Somos dos mundos separados (Es astronomía) Somos dos mundos separados  Desde muy lejos, desearía haberme quedado contigo Pero aquí, cara a cara, un extraño que una vez conocí Pensé que si quería me volvería a enamorar Dijiste: La distancia trae cariño, pero adivina que no con nosotros El único error que no cometimos fue correr (Ahora mira lo que hemos hecho)  Hemos viajado por los mares, hemos montado las estrellas Hemos visto todo desde Saturno y Marte Por mucho que parezca que eres dueño de mi corazón Es astronomía, somos dos mundos separados  (Es astronomía) Somos dos mundos separados  Deja de intentar mantenernos vivos Estás apuntando las estrellas En el cielo que ya murió  Deja de intentar mantenernos vivos No puedes obligar a las estrellas a alinearse Cuando ya han muerto Oh, hemos muerto, ooh, ooh  Oh, hemos viajado por los mares, hemos montado las estrellas Hemos visto todo desde Saturno y Marte Por mucho que parezca que eres dueño de mi corazón Es astronomía, somos dos mundos separados
Love this!
Who said that I'm screaming cuz this mv made me live my dream?
<3 sorry
omg y3
Hi crush if nandito ka I'm still waiting for you..❤️
:')
I come here everyday cause why not? Ily conan can't wait for superache!!<3
My "friend" told me I remind them of that song. Should I take that as a confesion? lol
He looks like he stepped out of a period piece, like a Jane Austin or Dickensian novel.....tragic but mesmerizing.    He's definitely an old soul.
_Conan is my heart_   <3333
Astronomy is Conan Gray’s best song.It’s a gloomy song but it feels good to listen to it.Definitely one of my favourite songs ever~
This song owned my heart.
I love your songs ❤️
الأغنية حلوة
I used to hear it everyday... After a year it just amazed me like the first ever moment ... Love you conan for making THIS song...❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is a LITERAL MASTERPIECE!!! Conan you're amazing! Ily
Listening to Conan's music is my therapy.
The camera work on this is top tier, gotta give credit where credit is due.
the intro remids me of heather
This mv seems similar to how you film your  blogs before.kinda nostalgic❤😭
Flashing lights warning
Me haces muy feliz
TE AMO MUCHO CONAN
♥️🙏
3:51 when he held the camera as if he's letting the person go gently to not hurt them :/
this whole video is a y/n dating conan scenario
How can someone be so handsome and beautiful at the same time? And nice voice too!
I will never get tired of the song voice is peaceful
THIS SONG FEELS CHILLY!!!
You're amazing. ❤️✨
The fact this was about his old best friend 🥲 very relatable
Dear Conan ,  Don't you ever get tired owning stranger's hearts???
02:59 putting this for me just so I can listen to it in repeat
U are my favourite now Gray😘
This song makes me sadly miss a love I haven't had yet 😪💔
Dear Conan, After hearing your songs , i love to cry. It feels alright and nice to cry..
2:58 GOODNIGHT
this song actually pains my heart it’s so good
Conan vc e perfeito
This song made me bawl my eyes out. Not many musicians can do that to me.

Conan is beatiful
mto meu boy sim! cara que musicas perfeitas
😚😚😚😚😚😚
You know what my friend hates you but I always say to her (Have some faith in him then he can even be bigger than you maybe someday but we will never know ) And I fricking love your songs keep up your master pieces and I love you and you and you and you and plus never give up on your amazing singing your a star your my fricking star and Idol when I get up I go to my laptop and watch you it just calms people down if there stressed or mad or sad you know it makes them feel like there not alone your not alone your just fantastic I love you and my wish was always to meet you so let's wait and see we will never know the future
I'm a man who's taking my master's course in Korea. My girlfriend's a Singaporean student and we've been having a long distance relationship, meeting only for a week every three months. At the last night of her trip to my city, I was in a train to her place after my shift. Then this song played from shuffle and I almost wept to it. My gf has to work 20hrs/week for living even during her semester and she has a father who doesn't love her and a loving mother who lives apart.
It's breaking dawn and you're in your car driving.You're playing this song..you're looking outta your window..You can see the beautiful sea.The rays of sun is hitting your face.you're reminising the time of your life  back in high school maybe,,when you listened to this song and all you felt was hurt.You turned up the volume.You're singing along.You're smiling realising,it did pass.
Arte puro✨💕👏
DIOS QUE CANCIÓN MAS ESPECTACULAR AAAAAAAA
Where are the st pauls students at?
Today,a boy sang this song at our school,now im addicted
Imagine Conan and Taehyung singing a song together!!!
this song maks me feel stuff i have never ever been able to put into words, its so beatiful, sad, bittersweet, angelic, delicate and heartbreaking all at once.  I got to see conan perform live 2 days ago and i have never ever felt so many things at once, i cried like my life depended on it. conan is a genuis song writer and quite literally the embodiment of an angel. i am so happy for his success xx

I love you Conan, I hate how people are not paying enough attention to these master pieces, but that's gotta change, my man because you've written songs I wish I could've heard before and now my heart feels in confort because you've let me heal a lot of scars. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels that way thanks for your music
i can’t believe this song is almost a year old already 😭
i got jealousy issues from watching overdrive but cone made me a picnic so im happy and can die in peace play this at my funeral <33

OMG
this is my comfort song right now, conan you are literally my therapy. <3
oh i remember when this came out 😭😭
just cannot ever move on
literally never been in a relationship and i’m still crying my eyes out
The lyrics are so deep!!
His voice is soothing!!
without a doubt Conan always makes me feel so warm with his voice, I want to listen to you for the rest of my life 💞
This just described my parent's marriage way too accurately
A vibe dessa música é inexplicável  ... fico horas e horas a noite escutando até dormi 🤧
Is it just me or does this song remind you of Aristotle and Dante?
He heals me
ghoooddddd!! i'm starting to love youuuu Conan!!
eu sempre vou amar essa música...🥺💓
bro
conan is so underrated, i really want to see him growing !!
amoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
i am thinking about sleeping with conan
THIS SONG IS A MASTERPIECEEEEE!!! PERIOD.
I like how people dont understand you like music does.. <3
this is litterally night changles - one direction, 2.0
My fav song of Conan gray♥️💗
Ily more than life
This so such a good song Conan! Keep up the great work!🖤 Love you.
♡
"you said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us" hits different
The song that won't leave our heart <3
Astronomy ❤️
no one : me pretending i am on a date with conan whilel watching this video
I’m not really a fan of conan, but this song hit different. One of the song that I must listen to before going to bed. But this song did not receive much recognition. Sad
I study astronomy and almost 2 years ago I met a great person in our class, but I never got to know her and tell how much she means to me. "Two worlds apart" works for me very well.
4:10 minutes and seconds of try not to cry
Este hermoso ser no hace música, hace obras de arte!! <3333
I just started listening to him omg
only 7 million views wtf
CANT STOP LISTENING ✨🥹🫶🏼🪐🌌🌙
ได้กลับมาฟังอีกเพลงดีมากเลยอ่าาาจาร้องㅠㅠㅠ
estaba llorando pidiendo por i muerte, el pasado no deja de atormentarme y repetirme una y mil veces que soy una mierda y solo debo morir pero, accidentalmente se puso esta música en m i celular, era de noche y yo cargaba auriculares... no había sentido nunca en mi vida amar una canción hasta que esta se coloco por accidente
Boy and a boy had me
Te Amo conan <3
I truly love you Conan
this deserves over 1 billion views
Winter Bear ? 🤔
Once you  cONan you can't conOFF
¿Cómo es posible que Conan no esté nominado a un Grammy aún?
GUYS FIGHT ME. IT'S MY FIRST TIME HEARING. I HAVE THIS POWER OF FIRST TIME LISTENING
YOUR MUSIC IS JUST >>>
I LITERALLY THOUGHT HE WAS BESIDE ME THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SONG
I was mesmerized by the song at the end of an Ep of _Ordinary Joe_ and found this gem 💎
getting ready to scream this in 17 days
this song is my religion
have i mentioned that i love him
sometimes im happy, then i remember astronomy exists and cry myself to sleep again
Conan Gray is all that is right
THIS IS SOOO AMAZING!!😭
~beautifully done~
que sorte desse câmera
I have a story like this. Me and my friend are the same person, and we are livng two different lifes at home. We arent a couple, but weve been through a lot. We lost friends, we both have disorders, rough stuff. Thanks guys <3

2:59 best part
Still obsessed with this😭😭
literally never fails to amaze us  and make us sob-
Runaway fathers and mothers who drank? Cassie and Lexi???
Próxima?
q tristeza essa música me deixa com vontade de observar as estrelas com alguém especial
😭😭
Uma das minhas favs <3 Conan nunca decepciona
this song makes me sick fr how can you love a song so much that you hate it cause it hits too hard?
We both listened to this song when it was first released. It was beautiful and we talked about how the vibe feels nostalgic. I never understood the lyrics until this is what exactly happened to us.   "The only mistake that we didn't make was run, now look what we've done." "Young love don't last for life." "You can't force the stars to allign when they already died."
“Young love don’t last for life”
Cómo no enamorarse de está canción <33
every single one of his songs are a fucking masterpiece. he is one himself
I love you song🎧❤
Yo, parts of this song straight up sound like one of coldplay's songs, but I can't remember which one. 🤔
i cant describe it but i want to dress how this song sounds
esta cancion es la que mas visito de noche,es mi save place junto fine line y sigo sin creer que voy a ver a conan en concierto :'')
Que hermosa canción
My heart cries while my eyes remain dry.
the mojave desert is so beautiful... god i love california
Muwowhiwbe
imagina a pessoal sortuda quê vai namorar ele
meu anti depressivo<333
A voz tão suave me acalma
"quantas vezes você já ouviu essa música?"  -sim
Música fav
Me to Conan: It's astronomy. We're two worlds apart
I love this song~ but not as much as you would think it’s “out of this world” love
Pov : u’re dating conan
The way he said ' You own my heart' just own my heart.
earth have some millions years alive and we live at the same time of conan, what a time to be alive :)
so good❤
Thank you Lonica
LOVE YOU CONAN CHECK OUT MY COVER BRO!
ily
come to brazil conan
conan gray obrigada por nos proporcionar grandes hinos
Why I feel like crying...there some magic in his voice 💔
Conan grays' lyrics are like reading this very beautiful novel....it's like the sad end of a novel, where the two lovers, just stare into each other eyes and smile wearily...And it's oddly calming, it sets a feeling of tranquility within you although you're crying a river...I am an aspiring songwriter/poet and I wish that One day I can be like Conan...I wish I could meet Conan and learn and just hang out with him...Also, Conan is one of the prettiest people, inside and outside, that I have ever seen and as the cherry on top, he is one of the most gifted singers/song-writer...he is seriously the most underrated artist EVER
ily so much and love your voice <3
my heart
masterpiecee!!!!
Conan's music literally gives me goosebumps 😨
Esa no pq lloro
my soul fly with this song
I JUST DISCOVERED THIS MASTERPIECE OMG HOW THIS GUY ISNT KNOWN GOO CONANN !!!
Tears! The last time I sobbed with Conan was “Heather”. My heart!!!
te amo Conan
Tbh Conan is like a Pinterest aesthetic board❤️
his voice wow and lyrics
1:11
I'm very happy this song introduced me to Conan.
This is probably my favourite song of him
he's so pretty & FOR WHAT !!!! 🥺
Conan te amo por ti le hecho ganas a la vida <3
I am crying all the time 😭
I always wondered why i never wrote  a comment under this song. It was always a song that made me cry. Maybe i didn't know how to explain the feeling it gave me?  This song for me is like, knowing you and someone are drifting apart. Knowing that you both need to move on. For the better because you know it just will never work. You're out of time you know? The feelings are gone and you both try to save it but you need to come to terms it's over. Its not even about love it can also be about friendship. Its about a person leaving because they know they are two worlds apart from tee person. Slightly regretting the choice questioning, was it better this way? but then seeing the person. Feeling every emotion again. Knowing it was for the best. "STOP TRYING TO KEEP US ALIVE" the frustration hits. When the person makes it harder to let go of what you guys had because they do small actions to make it okay and all you want to do is get it over with so it doesn't hurt as much. the metaphors the emotions it all makes sense as its explained. It hurts letting go of someone so close but this song is saying. Eventually. You need to let go.
"We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart"  It hits so hard when you're going through it.
This must’ve been really awkward to film-
1:53

I love you
i am not lonely, no       shhhh
Conan taylor olivia collabration is what everything i  wanted
We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch  우리는 차를 타고 숲과 부잣집 동네를 지나  We joked as we looked that they were too good for us  그것들이 우리한테는 과분해 보여서 우린 농담을 했어  'Cause socially speaking, we were the same  솔직히 말해서 우린 똑같이  With runaway fathers and mothers who drank  술을 마시고 집을 나간 부모를 두었으니까  A tale old as time, young love don't last for life  아주 오래된 이야기지, 젊은 시절에 하는 사랑은 평생 지속되지 않아  And now I know, now I know  그리고 이제 난 알아  It's time to go, it's time to go  떠날 시간이라는 걸  ​  [Chorus]  We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars  우린 바다를 여행하고, 별에 올라탔어  We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars  우린 토성부터 화성까지 모든 것을 보았어  As much as it seems like you own my heart  네가 내 심장을 가진 것처럼 보이지만  It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  이게 별들이 운행하는 법칙이야*, 우린 두 개의 갈라진 세계야  *astronomy: '별의, 우주의'라는 뜻의 'astro'와 '학문, 법칙'이라는 뜻의 'nomy'가 결합한 합성어.  보통 '천문학'으로 번역되나, 이 곡에서는 어원을 살려 풀어쓰는 쪽이 문맥에 어울리는 것 같아 '별들이 운행하는 법칙'이라고 옮겼다.  ​  [Post-Chorus]  (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  (이게 별들이 운행하는 법칙이야) 우린 두 개의 갈라진 세계야  (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  (이게 별들이 운행하는 법칙이야) 우린 두 개의 갈라진 세계야  ​  [Verse 2]  From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you  네가 멀어졌을 때 내가 네 곁에 머물렀다면 좋을 텐데  But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew  하지만 여기서 난 한때 알았던 낯선 사람을 마주해  I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love  떨어져 있다 보면 다시 사랑에 빠질 수 있을 거라고 생각했어  You said, "Distance brings fondness," but guess not with us  넌 "멀리 있으면 애틋한 마음이 생겨"라고 말했는데, 우린 아니었나 봐  The only mistake that we didn't make was run  우린 도피를 제외한 모든 실수를 저질렀어  (Now look what we've done)  (이제 우리가 뭘 했는지 봐봐)  ​  [Chorus]  We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars  우린 바다를 여행하고, 별에 올라탔어  We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars  우린 토성부터 화성까지 모든 것을 보았어  As much as it seems like you own my heart  네가 내 심장을 가진 것처럼 보이지만  It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  이게 별들이 운행하는 법칙이야, 우린 두 개의 갈라진 세계야  ​  [Post-Chorus]  (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  (이게 별들이 운행하는 법칙이야) 우린 두 개의 갈라진 세계야  (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  (이게 별들이 운행하는 법칙이야) 우린 두 개의 갈라진 세계야  ​  [Bridge]  Stop tryna keep us alive  우리를 살려 두려고 노력하지 마  You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died  넌 하늘에 뜬 이미 죽은 별들을 가리키고 있어  Stop tryna keep us alive  우리를 살려 두려고 노력하지 마  You can't force the stars to align  넌 억지로 별들을 줄 맞춰 세울 수 없어  When they've already died  그것들이 이미 죽었을 때는  Oh, we've died, ooh, ooh  우린 생을 다했어  ​  [Chorus]  Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars  우린 바다를 여행하고, 별에 올라탔어  We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars  우린 토성부터 화성까지 모든 것을 보았어  As much as it seems like you own my heart  넌 내 심장을 가진 것처럼 보이지만  It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  이게 별들이 운행하는 법칙이야, 우린 두 개의 갈라진 세계야
Perfeito
😭
In love all the time<333
Conan's music really relates to our life in alot of ways can we appreciate Him for expressing ours and his emotions in ways Conan is baby 🤍🖤
Ordinary Joe brought me here and love it
Yall ever just listen to a song and start feeling super upset and sad? Like, it's not that i relate to the lyrics it's kinda the way the song sounds. Like it would be a song that describes an old woman as she's looking through pictures from her when she was in her 20s, having fun with the person she loved,  who was lost to cancer. IDK it just hurts bro.
this song reminds me of Ducky and Andie from 'Pretty In Pink', I really hope there was some inspo there bc the driving through rich neighborhoods and a parent leaving parts are big character/ plot details in that movie
their aesthetic is all i want
Your music never disappoints. Such divine beauty ❤❤❤
Конан такой комфортный💌🩹
Ugh his songs are just so good i can't
He's really son of Taylor and sibling of Olivia.
Why do I feel like I’ve went into another dimension when listening to him. Like I wasn’t aware I was even walking
My boi conan be like i was rejected a millennium times😂
My crush sent me a VM of him singing this song and  I don't have no idea what's the song name and I searched it through Google and start humming the song so I made it, I finally found it...I was amazed by Jay's taste  of music. Astronomy , really describes my crush and his ex-boyfriend, they met online and now broken apart they didn't even had the chance to met and know each other more. I like my crush so much, I like him a lot to the fact that even I'm aware that he's still waiting for his ex-boyfriend (ye he's bi) I still kept on liking him and support him, even if it hurts it's fine, to the other side of the song I still relates to it, we've spent our youth together, we've traveled to seas, we've ridden the stars and so on but still he likes someone from Mars 😅
laa amooo
Conan’s aesthetic: The wife who died before the movie starts
ISTG THIS MAN VOICE IS SO BREATHTAKING
This song is magical ❤
he is getting so better with each and every performance and songs
I GOT GOOSEBUMPS  WHEN HE SAID OH WE DIEEEEDDDDD dsfsdfdsfcds
realmente escuchando esta canción después de mucho tiempo, me hace llorar
volviendo a tiempos en dónde escuchaba a Conan
Gracias Conan por crear esta Joya
Astronomy is a piece of art that I’ll never get bored of hearing it  I consider this song my safe place <33
2:58 This part comes  Me: *starts sobbing*
*single crying*
You have  the best songs!^^
𝘪 𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦 𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 , 𝘵𝘢𝘦 ♡︎.
Unusually literate.
"Stop tryna keep us alive  You're pointing at stars in the sky that  already died"
When I said I cried, I CRIED 😭 this person is such an art and I’m being selfish, i don’t wanna share him with anyone new.
gants hairtai duu <3
Can't believe it's already been 7 months.....7 months since this masterpiece released....damn
Pasaran los años y nunca podré superar esa nota alta que se aventó, se sentirá igual que la primera vez que lo escuche <3
De verdad que todo lo que canta lo convierte en arte este ser <3
this song is my life rn  ITS SOOO GOOD
currently crying and listening to this bc i have to move and my gf doesn’t wanna do long distance 😮‍💨
I've heard a lot of amazing songs, but none can compare to this. ever since my friend passed away, I've never felt the same, but this song, just helps me. God bless,  god bless Conan, & god bless my friend who's passed, may you find rest in heaven my dear friend
I always come back
Conan é o sinônimo de poesia moderna. ❤🍃
still listening to this on replay
the “now look what we’ve done” just hits my soul
Brain: no one knows ur in love don't worry Heart: conan gray knows:)
imagine waking up and seeing him in front of u
❤☠️
This is so wholesome. I fell in love with it.. it's on loop for the past 1 hour & now I'm obsessed..
I going to cry
:(((
Astronomy no es una canción, es un sentimiento
he's that friend who i can share every problem with
THE SONG,THE LYRICS,EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM IS  AESTHETIC
t amo Conan eres mi vida <3
Conan is right out of a novel, I swear
Por alguna razón, este video me recuerda mucho a Aristóteles y Dante descubren los secretos del universo. Por el automóvil, el desierto, la letra, TODO.
💕💕💕
I'm addicted to this song!!!😩😩😩
Qué buena canción. Masterpiece.
😻🥺🥺😥

Another day and I'm here too lol

conan vc vai pagar minha terapia!
If this song reminds of something.. It might be "We Never Change" by Coldplay. Similar vibes
if aesthetic was music its definitely made by ✨CONAN GRAY✨
1:09 “we’ve travelled the seas,  we’ve ridden the stars,  we’ve seen everything  from saturn to mars.  as much as it seems,   that you own my heart,  it’s astronomy,  we’re two worlds apart.”  2:59  “stop trying to keep us alive  you’re pointing at stars in the sky that  already died  stop trying to keep us alive  you can't force the stars to align when they've  already died.”
Conan writes so beautiful songs. Like if you agree.
💪✨✨💖💖💖💖💖💖
Happy birthday Conan!

Still one of the best💜🌌
a nadie le importa ,pero mi gato desapareció , se fue o no se que  le paso ,no soy una buena dueña, pero justo el día que Conan saco este arte , si un 7 de mayo estaba tan feliz a mi lado y tome muchas fotos  y lo puse de fondo de esta canción y cuando la escucho ,me acuerdo a el y solo medan ganas de llorar demasiado ,nunca apareció .......
I love this song!! and to think that what I gave was EVERYTHING for a person at 1000% and all the moments are difficult to explain, of everything that was lived and of everything that will be lived in just a memory and feel that everything was very real and that now it's just astronomy. psdt send like so that she can see it, since I will dedicate it to her in a few weeks after traveling to where she is.
Man has no bad songs
goosebumps.
I want to be the camera man so badddddd
Your music brings me inexplicable joy
Conan taking the video of pov from holding hands and spinning was something I didn't know I needed

n♡....♡z
We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought, if I wanted, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done) We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart Stop trying to keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop trying to keep us alive You can't force the stars to align when they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart…
amazing.
When he is driving the truck I get major Aristotle and dante vibes and I 🥺🥺🥺
Crying In class currently
Is this song about amelia ?
I still remember that when the song was coming out literally all the comments where about "astronomy twerking"
Conan and his songs are my therapy<33
kill me but this is SO MUCH better than heather.
i wish i could say all these words face to face to end the relationship (friendship in my case) 😞
Conan songs are all such a mood if you're reading so I've been playing them a lot lately. 😋😋😋

Hes so talented
Is it just me or this songs sounds a lot with Sparks by Coldplay? Both great not gonna lie
I can't wait for the new album
i love him so much
So much drama and intense emotion. Conan, your song here is awesome. I can definitely feel the emotion coming from this. It's amazing. Awesome 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
The girl I love was listening to this song and that's how I discovered it. I still love that girl but she doesn't know. Nice song but time to go
This song is so gooood. I wish more people could know about it.
I love you
🌜💘S♡😻🌠Beautiful💋🌛

Conan voice and music is so healing ✨
Why are all his songs just masterpieces?
You don’t know if he has had his first kiss yet  ,don’t talk bout things you don’t know
Ok it's good I am not only one crying, Its really relief.
perfe=cedfo
STOP TRYING TO KEEP US ALIVE, YOURE POINTING AT STARS IN THE SKYYYY 😩🔊‼️

This song gave me depressing movie vibe

Oh How can someone's voice be so impressive?
The Galaxy is Endless, I Thought We Were Too.
conan te amo
comfort song and comfort person <3
Conan song  Full volume  Little slow air  Road trip  Side window seet  ...........now you know very well
The song reminds me of “the little prince” book…
i absolutely love Conan and his amazing art ! :'))
Why is this man so underrated!!
I really feel so happy when I to this song <3
i was stolen my heart by Conan...
Conan why you making me cry with your music😭
This song manages to make me cry everytime I listen to it.
This music video screams aesthetic to me 😭
BEST SONG EVER
Back again with tissues ....
Not me and conan being two fuckin worlds apart.....im so done
how am I able to love someone so much
I want my life to be like this. This aesthetic is breathtaking ✨
*It’s Astronomy* *We’re two world’s apart*
<333
my ex and i broke up for good and yeah we are still in love like deep now we separated our  own paths and maybe we might never ever be able to meet face to face...for me this song tells the story of us and one day my kids will listen to this song not knowing  that it will be their mom's unspoken story.
Conan is a truly gifted songwriter and lyricist. Seems wise beyond his years. Lots of emotional intelligence and self-awareness in his lyrics. Kid Crow was one of the albums that got me through the lockdown. Can't wait for the next one.
my crush is a Cancer, I'm an Aquarius. Apparently, they're really incompatible. Wish me luck guys. If things don't work out, I'll play this song on full blast and cry my heart out. If it does go well, I'll update u guys❣️
Happy that u existed ❤️
I still want to know where he got the orange corduroy jacket thing
.
man the outro killed me i love this ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
who went thumbnail like yk?
Soy el único chico que escucha Conan gray 🙄

Seeing this song made me fell in love with him❤️
This song is pointed right at sylvie and loki istg
This Conan’s best song. Period.
This MV feels like home more than my actually home. I love you Cone.
this song is beautiful
fictional characters song
me encanta
Ho❤️✨
Has someone else identified that the pre-chorus to this song is almost the same as the chorus for "Sparks" by Coldplay? And the chorus to this song is almost the same as the verse to "Sparks"? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ar48yzjn1PE at 1:15 for the chorus
Boring
best poet (songwriter) alive
oh and when it goes close up to his face near the end it reminds me of Olivia's close up in the grocery store in good 4 u
alll the colours and UGH conan I love you so much you make me so happy
This is so aesthetically pleasing. Also, this gives me MAD deja vu (Olivia Rodrigo vibes) like when he's driving omg. obvious they share the same producer
It's literally 12am and I'm crying listening to this song. What? I've never even been in a relation bro
listening to this in the countryside is one of the best things I ever did
"Stop tryna keep us alive, You’re pointing at stars in the sky , That already died, Stop tryna keep us alive, You can’t force the stars to align , When they’ve already died"  Conan's incredibly talented putting to words what so many of our hearts fail to express.
Just a POV with more budget, cool
Thanks to Earth Pirapat who introduced me to this song,it’s  embarassing that i didn’t know this song existed
I used to listen too many songs in a day but i really really obsessed with Conan voice . Every single word touch the soul how deep he sings no words for his voice and lyrics 💟💟
More hopeless romantic songs please!😭❤️
Amo
His voice gives me chills, I just can't!!
This amazing song is very underrated God
He has no idea how much i love him. I mean im watching his vedio when he wasn't that famous . I've seen his achievements. I really wanna be by his side in person., You don't know boy imma only single for ya . I love girly boys❤️
“We’re two worlds apart”  yup he lives in another country 👍
BQSTA CONAN TEAMO<3
i lovee this songgg
I love how your songs sound like their written about lovers from past lives like forgotten memories but not forgotten feelings this music is perfect
Hey I'm here again!
As an aromantic asexual, this song hit differently
He makes me feel like we were childhood friends😭...who are no longer together .
You're literally driving  Atleast wear the belt dude
o Conan nunca erra, essa música é incrível
Of course some dude on the internet that sings songs about death and is physically like psychopath will truly get my heart go 'badum' and I simp
WHY ONLY 5M VIEWS? WHERE ALL THE HUMAN?
idk i just feel that emotion
I’ve cried to this song one to many times
This is the best song eveerrrr 🤯🔥 it's makes me want to be conan's girlfriend 😭❤
How did Heather not fall in love with conan
THIS SONG MY GOODNESS
5,400,938 views today <3 ( I would love to come back and see lmao )
faveeee
Conan omg <333
this song hits so hard
This song came out on my birthday and I was having a really hard time around that time, and this song as de spreading as it is helped through those terrible times😞❤️
why does this man always gotta make me cry
OKAY I'LL ADMIT IT I HAVE SUCH A CRUSH ON CONAN
Every time I am emotionally dramatic about a loved one this song plays on repeat in my mind.
harry styles and conan gray give me gender envy
This guy needs more hype
Never seen anyone as beautiful as Conan
When me and my alien boyfriend broke up
❤️❤️❤️✨✨
her seyı mı mukemmel olur bırının?
guvenli alanim😕
i missed my bestfriend so much, i can relate to this 💔
I HATE YOU CONAN YOU'RE JUST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
simping all over this video
He is amezing i love him  his voice😌
i miss his short hair
this man is so talented
He should make a song with Olivia Rodriguez.
It's been 3 months now, when can I expect this song to NOT hurt?
wow
Beautiful song & video!!  I love it!  I love your tone!  Come visit, Minneapolis loves you!!!
the whole official video is pov's
This guy is incredible....the metaphors are mind-blowing...I am confused its a song or a classic English poem...he brings out different set of hidden emotions to surface
This is one of 'sounds like heaven but hurts like hell' ......
This music video gives me vibes of the significant other than died before the start of the movie and our main character has montage flashbacks through the whole movie as they grow through and beyond their grief. Cinematically so beautiful I love it
I feel like i'm on a date, no complaints
I am Cam, I am 14 years old, I am Mexican and in April of next year it will be my quinceañera. It is common for the quinceañera to choose a modern dance and a bals, I immediately hear this song for my bals. It is a very significant moment, when you dance with your loved ones, this song for me shows in a certain way to go from one stage to another, after everything I have gone through as a person I can mature when I turn fifteen. I already want the day to dance with this song to come. 🤍
conan, you are absolutely incredible
this song reminds me so much of sitting listening to Pink Floyd, it's amazing, i have it on repeat haha 😍😍😍
I love the song, but… I’m so sorry I just can’t take this MV seriously. It’s just him flailing himself around in front of a camera for four minutes. It just makes me laugh. Again, beautiful song though
ვტირი შემეშვით
this fits perfectly with luca and alberto's relationship
This reminds me of night changes mv by onedirection🥺
ur amazing and i love you and im so happy i have to got to see you blossom into the most talented and beautiful person that you are now
yes please
Conan Gray is the definition of a pretty boy.
😔but that isn't how my dreams can go 😅
Omg ☺️I wish my man would feel this way to me
We are 2 worlds apart
this song shatters me
I love boy Conan i love you💜💜💜💜
oh my god i fell in love you are perfect your aesthetic is the same as me
This whole video is  Pov-ur dating conan
Hello everyone, I just released my new single "Never Give Up" with Emilie (The singer). I would be extremely happy if you took a look! I hesitated for a long time to do my PUB under other videos because it bothers me a little. But after some thought, I told myself that advertising was everywhere these days and that the famous people on whom I post this message have surely done the same. We can all evolve so why hesitate ?!
Conan is very much photogenic.
If there was a male version of Taylor swift:
<333
Oh damn I'm getting addicted to Conan's songs again-
pov:your in love with a boy
ngl, this song is my alarm! Please don't ask any questions.
Conan is legitimately my favorite human ever
The only person I know who can still look beautiful while being this close to the cam.
I said Eros the god doest not exist. Oh boy am I wrong!
when first time i listened to it, it was a good song but second i knew the lyrics, gosh this is sad...and why am i crying now? :( so pure and deep
If u think of it, this song kind of matches with the wattpad story ff1970 (flowers from 1970)
I swear to god 03:00 - the end is the best thing ive ever heard
BRO THE CINNAMOMTOGRAPHY
Litterally conan saying we're 2 worlds apart in my face, ok king
ur music is the reason i keep going :)
Relaxified
Pov: you're in a relationship with conan
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk lol
Love you
Love love love.
this song has the melody that i want in my wedding but the content is so saddddd 😭
Te amo
I don't know why i'm crying,for the vídeo or for the lyric :(
this song sounds like the sadness at the end of a beautiful story that just wouldn't work. it sounds like the settlement of "it was beautiful while it lasted but we have more chapters to go through". like the melancholic eye contact and a bittersweet smile before parting into an exciting new beginning.
te amo mas que a mi vida
You can't watch this mv in front of you parents😆🤫🤭
Everyone in my household (not mine): what r u screaming about?!?!   Me: it’s astronomy….
This song is about Ashley, so we are seeing this from Ash's pov.
My goodness he looks so adorble- ahh i love him! ((Fan way not weird way))
Im probably the luckiest person alive I went on a date with all of the One Direction Boys and now im on a date with Conan Gray. 👀
cómo esto tiene tan pocas vistas,,,
Nonton ini berasa punya pacar...
111111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
"we were the same with runaway fathers and mothers who drank" ........i cried
why does this song remind me of ash and eiji from banana fish ?
I feel like I've touched conan's soul! I think this is my favourite song of all time
I'm crying
A beautiful song written and sung by a beautiful person 💜
This is the best one yet. I'm ready to lose my mind when the album drops.
If taylor swift had a musical baby.
I can never get bored of hearing Conan's voice.  I need my daily dose of this perfection....
did conan take us to joshua tree ????
we rlly woke up to Conan then he brought us to lunch then drove in the desert if my man does not do this I don't want him
brb crine in my room <3
SO AMAZING
Oh, Cone  I... Dont have words for this.... It's too perfect  Love u <3
I'm in love with this song
thanks conan, now im crying at a broken relationship with my nonexistent s/o
me in a happy relationship....crying bc of this
i'm in love yet again
im litetally waiting on full online love release 😑
this is not his song or lyrics. original from blue oyster cult has charizma. but this is not bad at all
This video makes me miss something I've  never experienced
I don't know if I am more addicted to Conan's music or looks
His voice is so heavenly.  Whenever I am having a hard time,  he heals me like an ointment on wound.😭❤
MOST BEAUTIFUL SONG EVER!
Hi
💜
Voy a dejar mi comentario otra vez, conan te amó muak
Vengo a dejar mi comentario para el stream i love you a todos ahr conan te amó
I wonder how they planned to shoot the video
if the travelers from genshin impact was a song, they'd be this
OMG
Conan Gray is aesthetic
This song is soooooo beautiful. I feel like turning my phone off and wondering in nature, enjoying little things. Conan you are so talented
i'm crying <3
i love u conan gray.
Lo amo tantooo❤ Su voz es hermosa😭😍
Listening this after watching young royals :')
Drifting away from people who you were close with is one of the hardest, most painful feelings and  it's an unfortunate part of "coming of age". What's worst is when you know it's your last days with them and you can't do anything about it. It's a goodbye before starting your next chapter. Happens with friends, family, gf/bf, co-workers, teachers, mentors etc.. it's hard to keep in touch with people you don't see everyday and it feels like being 2 worlds apart watching from social media (if they are active on it). Sadly, distance doesn't really bring fondness since you grow used to them not being in your life, but it also does not erase the memories and love.
VAI SE FODER, CONAN!! Eu tava ouvindo rock pq tava me sentindo horrível Rock me acalma mas não alivia ai eu tava quase pulando sua música mas resolvi deixar agora eu to chorando n me acalmou, mas aliviou toda a merda q tava na minha cabeça foi como aqueles remédios q qnt pior na hora, melhor dps obrigada (thank u, really)  (it's in portuguese, i was too bad to wright more than two phrases in inglish, sorry babe :'D)
I'm investigating Conan Gray's songs right now because I came across ''People watching'' on youtube and I don't know why but he reminded me of Taehyung from BTS for a moment. Idk I think this song gave me kinda ''Winter bear'' vibes. Then suddenly I thought about a collab between Conan and Taehyung. Am I the only one who thinks that would be great? ✨
Why people with the best intentions is always single?
Te amo Conito ♡˖
this video is a cousin of Maggie Rogers' "Light On".
love it.
the first time i heard this somg it was playing in some playlist on spotify and i was mowing the lawn and i actually almost started crying out there
damn, the mv is on point
This is what happens why my mind and my heart meet
Conan didn't even had his first kiss yet, and he writes and performs like he's been through 3 divorces
Conan gray songs therapy
Astronomy my favorite song
oh conan i love you so much
i literally got chills 3:23 <3
Como una canción puede saber exactamente cómo me siento:(
Olivia Rodrigo and Conan Gray ... Just a thought 💭 🤓👌
Conan me gustas
lol why am i crying
'Young love don't last for life'...i wanna cry
I fear I'll find this song relatable soon enough.
whoever filmed this video is lucky as heck
omg you angel
"Pero como podría odiarla, ella es un angel Pero al instante, tal vez desearía que ella estuviera muerta" Ese texto queda terrible sin contexto, ya sé, pero permitime explicarte, La canción heather es el amor-odio que siente Conan hacia una persona, en este caso chica, nombrada por la canción como Heather, Conan siente un amor y odio con esa persona ya que a su crush le gusta heather y por eso no ama a Conan (esto se puede ver bien, si querés te paso un link de un video que explica la letra para que entiendas el contexto)      La Misoginia y el machismo no es lo mismo segun la RAE
I religiously listen to all his songs everyday.
This would be so amazing with a full orchestra
This song is my medicine. It's magically healing me.
Have a slight hit of early days of Coldplay, nice
Luv u
this guy has ZERO bad songs. A bop again👏
LITERALLY CRYING
* Conan destruyendo el set * el staff: PERATE WEEYYYYY
His voice is sooooo soothing ❤️❤️
I found this late
this must be viral fr
Beautiful, really gets me thinking
☁️🤍
okay but let's talk about HOW HOT CONAN LOOKS ON THIS
i’m loving the whole perspective things lmao 😩
At the start I thought it was Heather I was listening to
I really love this song so much
I'd just like to say that Conan looks like what I imagine a pre-Azkaban Sirius Black to look like. Just my personal opinion.
This song is so underrated
He deserves so much.
Still obsessed with this song it’s TRANSCENDENT
Aqui está eu em plena 1:02 da manhã chorando, pensando nele...e ouvindo Conan 🚶
0:13 I'M sHyYyYyYyyyy
(LYRICS) We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought, if I wanted, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done) We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart Stop trying to keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop trying to keep us alive You can't force the stars to align when they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
ver el video de esta canción me dan ganas de llorar
i found myself addicted to this masterpiece
I love you flaco❤
I'm here because of Conan O'Brien
i love you conan
I love his songs
😘
do you know how proud i am you were created?
CONAN ILY ❤️
Oh, how I love Conan Gray.....you beauty <3
dear christopher, the greatest gift you gave me was letting go. I genuinely thought some day I would have children with you, live in a house in the suburbs, and cherish the simple times. I held onto this dream tightly. When we started facing our challenges, I stopped seeing the person you were & instead desperately wanted the picture perfect version. I wanted the « you » in an alternate universe that didn’t abandon me, that didn’t tear me down, and that genuinely cared for me. I thought I could bargain for love. Even in our last moments, I begged for you to love me. Behind this all, I trusted you more than I trusted my own feelings. You abused this. You made me destroy myself from the inside. I grew sicker and sicker physically and you were never there despite me begging for you.  I lost every single piece of myself trying to desperately fight for you to love me. My hopes, dreams, aspirations - all gone. I was so sick and very close to death. And you broke up with me. I was angry and devastated. But then, peaceful. I could finally be genuinely « me » again.  I don’t know if you’ll ever see this, but I sent you this song a few months ago so maybe there’s a chance. I’m still very sick but I’ve had some surgeries and I’m going to live. My career is starting to take off in ways I never would have imagined. I have found joy again in the little things. I wish you all the love and warmth in the world and forgive you for the ways that you hurt me. You made the right choice breaking up with me, and I live my days so grateful that we are no longer in each other’s lives. thank you, V
Conan stop making me SOB
Sounds like traitor by O.R🤨
There's something about his voice😭
I feel so uncomfortable watching this 😬lmaooooo but the song is so calming
this song feels like a continuation of the troye sivan's the good side song
you’re so incredibly talented 🤍
wHAT THE HECK I HAVE NO WORDS FOR THIS SONG PLS I REALLY LOVE THIS
Conan said: let’s go for a date
cant take it back
The bridge, the fucking bridge of this song. This is it.
This man's curls- istg, I just want his hair (not literally)
this song is a free theraphy
One of the best😁
OKAY I LOVE YOU
I know you couldn't care less about my ,a stranger's ,comment  but I love your music I feel like I'm in another world ಥ‿ಥ
Eveytime I hear this song, I can't not get emotional when hear it...
I never realized he ripped off the wall

conan you’re criminally underrated
When two worlds apart~  Bruh I felt that
This is the type of song to put on full blast In ur headhones as u cry ur eyes out
People watching, astronomy,maniac, Heather,the story and so onnnnnn  This human is born to bless us...
suddenly reminded me of Alec Benjamin for some reasons. hope they do a collab🥺
This song is magic Conan!!
love all 💙
Damn this song is out of this wold ;)
I was crying too hard when i was listening to this emotional song
Conans music is like when its 444pm
oh cant help repeating the vocalization part
what a masterpiece
It's amazing how he used ever so beautiful outer space and made a heartbreaking song hmm ✨💔✨🌌🤧☄️☹️🌟🥺🌠
"As much as it's seems like you own my heart, It's astronomy we're two worlds apart"
BYE BC IM STILL CRYING OVER THIS SONG
🛐🛐🛐🛐
Conan best boy
I love his songs
Yesssssssssssssssss
This still takes me to another world😭💘
A forma como o Conan consegue passar o sentimento das músicas é incrível
" a tale old as time, young love don't last for life " ❤ Conan you have my soul💗
This song reminds me of killua and gon
This hurts more when you simp for a 2d character
them : why are u still single? me : wdym? *shows this mv*
This must be one of the best pieces of art ever created and it only has 4,5 million views, it´s unfair.
:(
Dads: What young people hear today is that reggueaton rubbish  What we hear:
The King and Astronomy are amazing
You can't force the stars to align, When they've already died :'(
It's like watching a movie
😭🤙
I keep watching this mv over and over again because the cinematography is just, chef's kisses. I really love that one shot at 1:53, it's just perfect with the music. Truly a masterpiece of a track and video!! <3
I want to run away with my soulmate with this song.
conan gray can scream and it will still be pleasant to my ears.
I absolutely love this song with my whole heart.
“Tale old as time”?  Is that a beauty and the beast reference?
Why is this so relaxing i was a kpop fan but now i am conane 😄plz dont mind
This deserves more views. It's sad, Conan deserves more. I remember when it was released and I can't explain the pain I feel just listening to this song. I was crying while this songs plays on repeat hahahaha. It looked like I was lost in a void and I don't know how to get out, and I still feel the same everytime I listen to this song.
I don't need a boyfriend... Just need listen to Conan !!! Is that too much to ask
Does anyone know the cords??on the guitar.
the mv really reminds me night changes'
So lovely 💜❤️💛
For some reason the first two time I listened to this, I didn’t like it then listened to it again and I fucking LOVE it!😍🎤
another pure soul
the best song
joder, amo esta canción
Me encanta, me da vida dios
how can i describe the amount of love i’ve got for this song?
safe place
"You can't force the stars to align when they've already died" The scientific accuracy to this is so surprising as the stars that we see are already a million years old and far from us so technically they have really died Also the other meaning to this line is that there's no use of making it right when everything about their relationship has already died This is such an intelligent lyric I can't-
WHAT IN THE WATTPAD
"stop tryna keep us alive, you can't force the stars to align when they've already died" :(
the things i’d do to meet this human
Conan is so talented.
His songs makes me alive 💜
Why is this so under rated song 😭😭😭😭
Ahhhhh i love u ❤️!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i love the lyrics way a little too much and that is perfect
When he screams it’s me when everybody hates me Conan your singing voice is amazing love your music I like heather maniac and astronomy
lancelot
new era is coming in a week bestie
This either gives me gender envy or I wanna date him😂😂😂
hi conan i’m in love with u lol
I'll tell the stars about you.
Damn, i had a sweet dream about you with this song, conan gray
I Love youuuu
My heart ❤
As a cosmologist, quantum physicist and astronomer myself, this song fits my Universal life.
I think i just fall in love with all of your songs 😳🥰❤️
And me thinking he would sing Roslyn... KKKKKKKKKK
Masterpiece
STR3AM ASTRONOMY QUE ES LO MEJOR <3
Just wanna thank Conan for existing
Not a fan of him or anything but this song... Just hits different wtf so good
Omg <33>
Why tf this song is still just 4 .5 million !!!!!!  Everyone should know about this song
I listen to this every single day
I keep getting heather vibessssss whenever I hear this song,bc of the cords -
omg i really love this guy
I got his signed CD and I literally cried 😅
I love song <3
Damn this song :,)
More precious Gen Z shite.   Blah.
The way before this I used to believe only visuals can be Aesthetic. These lyrics & song - close your eyes - Nothing more aesthetic>>>>>>
Conan  I want to cry with this song  is beautiful   You are beautiful
I had a dream where he made a new song, I am now angry that I had to be woken up.
Just me or is this human legit the definition of cottage core?
Idk i just randomly thought that this could be interpreted as someone singing about their imaginary soulmate who is in another universe and whatever they do they can't stop falling more and more in love and just never being able to become "one" idk if that makes sense But wow this song is rly beautiful.
These lyrics are so well thought through conan you're the best I'd love to be your friend in real life🥺🥺🥰🥰🥰
holy shit this is so beautifully written
THIS IS THE BEST THING I’VE EVER HEARD, HOLY SHIT I LOVE YOU
I'm so lucky to have my whole life enjoy your music, Conan. 💙
Such a beautiful song
We've seen everything from saturn to mars
This song is my safe place
I love the song I can not stop listening as well as the last song of my beautiful Tini Stoessel, I hope some time they make a collaboration ahh it would be epic
I don't know why, but this song hurts me...
🎧 *The person who is reading this* . . 👇 *You’re amazing stay blessed, stay safe and have a amazing rest of your day*
Please 3:53 is literally me every weekend and then I carefully out my closet doors back on cuz money...
Why are so pretty boy??? You are a Greek GOD 🛐🛐🛐
his hands tho
I love astronomy so much 😭
‘yea.. hey.. conan... CONAN PLS LOOK AT THE DAMN ROAD OR LEMME DRIVE’
I can't explain it but this song is blissfully calming. Something you'd listen to when you're walking in the rain in some country 1000 miles away from your home. This is something that'll play at the gates of heaven.  If a cloud was a song, this would be it. I have no other words to describe this ☁️
🌌🌌🌌🌌🎶🎶🎶
_Conan is my aesthetic._
watching this video makes me sad
Let’s just talk about how beautiful the music video is
The bridge of this song is everything.
Waw
Googles: How to be a camera? ASAP..
Accckkkk fugi mo talaga hihi.<33
i love this guy 😭😭🤍🤍🤍
This needs more fkn attention like wtf this so beautiful
Love how it’s like I’m hanging out with Conan- 💀
I can’t explain how perfect this song is 💖
Oh conan your vocals give goosebumps bruhhhh
as a weeb, that chorus hits excruciatingly hard
Dear CONAN GRAY , May you reach great height 🙏🙏 I am mesmerized by your songs.....🔥🔥🔥
put this video on VR then feel dating conan for 4 minutes ;v
"Oi monu besi nakor" - Deepak Kalal
estoy desde la cuenta de mi hermana jsjsjjsjs lol pero t amo conan, eres precioso. Att: paz <3
We love Conan ❤🥺
He's so pretty
Conito te amooo
Are we on a date with Conan?
i luvit!
OK the goosebumps are real
am I the only one who got “night changes” vibes from this
I'm sorry for the last comment but there is a long story behind that, the short version: my lil sister did write that.  I apologize for her and I'll make sure that will not happen again.  please act like nothing happened
I miss when conan would put the chords in the description :/ I just wanna learn ittttt
I listen to ur songs when I'm sad..Conan... especially " Heather" ....I love u a lotttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OMYGOD STREAM THIS ONE PLS!!!!
Why is this so underrated ..
Esto es arte
ok now conan is literally my crush
خربب
Not @me crying at 2am while listening to this song 😭
😭😭❤❤❤❤
Why the fuck are people sleeping on this??
<33
Conan saca joyas
1:30 to 1:50 just awesome
한국인 찾아요!
:(
Thanks for the virtual date conan!!❤
I think i like this boy. He is so much younger than me.. and i feel so bad for liking a minor, but then i know that he is the elio for another oliver. He is like "astronomy" for me because we're two worlds apart 🌌
Arte
i love this it’s so calmingz
Wey súper amo al Conan 💜 sus canciones me dan un poquito de ganas de vivir... aunque sean tristes
found this from an instagram edit and now im crying because of how relatable this song is
Okay now... this is the best song by Conan
Conan is so damn talented. I don’t think I’ve ever met somebody who said Conan sucks. The people who disliked either have mental problems or it’s botted😀
ْ
His songs and mv are both aesthetically pleasing
"Stop trying to keep us alive you're pointing at stars in the sky that already died"   ...that hit different and I don't know why
This song takes place after "overdrive" when conan introduces himself to the girl, they get to know eachother, fall madly in love, do all the things in the music video but then she has to move away. Might be
_He's my favorite person._
❤️❤️❤️
Imagine listening this in a rainforest home all alone
so beautiful Cone ❤️
Who else is looking forward to a  ✨ PERFECT ✨duet with Olivia Rodrigo 🥰
When you're depressed and tired and play this , it really helps !
conan lee gray you have no idea how much this song means to me and how it resonates so much with my soul, just today my bf and I had a mutual breakup. of course i loved him and he loved me, but the fire lost its spark. he was my one and so was I to him, but young love doesn’t last for life. later on in the relationship, he stopped talking to me for weeks (i think he was going through something) and I felt I needed to keep the relationship alive but it already died. i can’t force the stars to align, and that even though we felt we owned each others hearts, we really were just incompatible and two worlds apart, but hey! we’re still staying as close friends now :) we still care for each other, just platonically
tu música es arteeeeeeeeee
Conan te amoooooooooooo
CONAN TE AMO
Man! You made me fell in love with your personality 😭
This song deserves more.
YOURE SO TALENTED ILYSM !!!!!!
Just thingking how Conan already stole my heart with the story and then this? I HATE CONAN BYE 🥺💔
Can any voice be any more soother? 😍😍
>/<
so proud of you conan!! been watching your vlogs in high school and i love your music so much <3
U never fail to make me smile!!
anybody back after he basically announced a new song
My favorite song right now 😍
صوته عالم ثاني
He's done such a great job on the lyrics... can't stop listening to this
This reminded me of my ex. Don't know why it reminds me of him though.
Just wanna say that I learned all the words to this song the day it came out 😩
I luv u
omg (≧▽≦)
https://discord.gg/gbP4T3GD Conan Gray discord server! everyone's welcome here~
Conan I like you a lot I mean it I fell in love with you sorry 🙀
one of the most incredible lyrics i've ever seen
This song was relaxing🍓❤️
PLS THIS IS SO BEUTIFUL I JUST CAN'T
"THE STORY" & "COMFORT CROWD" had a baby and it's called "ASTRONOMY"
We're two worlds apart...damn right. But just for a moment, despite the distance between us we are one and the same - experiencing the infinite.   "And in that moment I swear we were infinite"
love u faze
“stop trying to keep us alive, you’re pointing at stars, in the sky, that already died”
Very nice
beautiful
Funny how I celebrated my birthday today, my bf and I got into an argument and on the verge of breaking up. This hurts so bad
Tune like alan Walker darkside
But I'm a fan of But I'm a fan of how he dresses 😭I love you skinny <
I love you Conan💗 Amo tus canciones más ahorita que ando triste 😢
Conan pls answer  (I mean you don’t have to)  Where can I meet you? 😊
The hysteria in the closing moments with the scale of the music becoming even more grand, ending in a numbing and deafening lull. That's a masterpiece of a second half of a song right there.
😔✋
linda música saí com depressão
Ale głupia piosenka nie polecam Eng: I don't like this song, and do not recommend IT
This song hit me so hard.
I hate this feeling of remembering someone I reject   Each of them is spectacular ♡
.
Somehow gives me Fly On vibes, mixed with a lot of heather strumming. It's very pretty.
ashley and conan needs to feed us i hadn't been eating for more than 2 years. y'all gotta feed ur KIDS
This is beautiful.This song can really put me to sleep.
노래 넘 좋다
Ok now imagine if conan and olivia made a song😌✋🏻
I belive in Conan supremacy.
this was randomly suggested to me on spotify and i oove it
His voice in this song makes me cry every time even when I’m not sad his voice is soo beautiful I love his soul
this is terapy
Conan never fails to make me cry in one way or another
pov: Hardest try-not-to-smile challenge ever
I have been a fan of Conan since "Sunset season", man he has grown so much. I love him.
3:09 البارت ذا فالهارتت
Amoo

الاغنيه فيها مشاعر مب طبيعية :(.

ستان عمنا كونان 🙄✋🏻.

يليلل احب صوت كون.
اغنيتي 😕💖.
14th Feb. 2019- 14th June 2021...we've died. I'm sorry bunny, I will always love you.  muffin
Someday those "two separate worlds" will come together :,).
I remember the first time I found out about his yt channel was when connor franta was shouting out some small yt channels, and conan was one of them. The first video I watched of his was the middle school vs. high school video when he was a little freshman T-T Now he's made it big as a wonderful worldwide artist (where freaking KIM TAEHYUNG said he wants to collab) IM SO PROUD OF YOU AND I LOVE YOU SO MUCH CONAN, AND I WILL CONTINUE SUPPORTING YOU NO MATTER WHAT <3
If 'aesthetic' is a human, it would be Conan.
It gives me *Aristotle and dante discover the secret of the universe* vibes, although I haven't finished it yet😅
Cuz socially speaking...
I heard this in the radio this morning , I knew it was Conan jsksisjsdjdjdj
like you own my heart
3:43.
I really love him :(
king🤴✨
Why am I crying? Because this is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.
this song really hit me hard :((
Dor, dor e apenas dor
ست،ريمم.
He is art himself! ❤
This masterpiece needs more attention 🥺❤️
Angel's voice, I just want to lose myself in his melody.

A beautiful and touching song
New favorite song unlocked
esta canciòn merece mucho , no dejen de apoyar a esta joyita ! Conan im so proud of you , you are a complete artist.
To anyone who finished the attack on titan manga I just wanna ask you something. If you haven’t, I wouldn’t recommend looking in the replies or my following comment.      Okay now that it’s only those who finished the manga, this song reminds me so much of Eren and Mikasa’s relationship. I’m never gonna get over AOT.
Conan gray music makes my soul calm...anyone else?
Raining and the music is so perfectly playing😞😞
this reminds me of heather i when I tell you I love heather I love heather
how did i miss this mv, its been a month and now i find out that astronomy has a mv 🤦🏻‍♀️😭 lol that aside, i already adored this song but the mv thou, like it’s absolutely beautiful and so conan, i love it so much, defo gonna be watching this on repeat 😍💖
This song belongs in a movie
All I can think about while listening to this is “If you Love me why does it seems you still love her” and “you lied again”
Is better music 🤧💞
i cant believe i’m dating conan gray
2:49.
صوت كون هناا هو كلشي :(.
حرفياا الاغنيه تستاهل الشهرهه مرهه  🦋💖.

CAN I MARRY THIS SONG?!
this song deserves so much more, It's art
He stayed up all night to read my screenplay that he asked to read. He jokes and laughs with me. He has this special way to say hi to me. He is clumsy like me, so in the dark I make him walk in front of me, so he trips where I would.  He loves music just like I do. He thinks I’m a really good singer (lie) He made sure I wouldn’t get in trouble with life, like drinking and things. He is somehow there for me, available to talk.  Yet the world hates the idea of us, the stars died before they even had time to line up. So I know it will never happen, even if I love him. He’s not for me. Maybe in another world, if the stars had just waited a little longer, we could have been in love. But that’s now only in a dream.    Edit: A lot of men are terrible people, they take what they want and use what they can to get it. He was nice until he got what he wanted.
*c o n a n   i s   a m a z i n g*
Conan Gray has 3,9m sub and this song has 3,9m view :v Conan Gray's fan is very wonderful
ME ENCANTA!! =)
"A tale old as time, young love don't last for life"  Can we just agree that conan did a freaking great when it comes to poem. 💖😭
I couldn't help but think about James and Alyssa.
We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life  And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go  We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart  From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought, if I wanted, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done)  We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  we're two worlds apart  Stop trying to keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop trying to keep us alive You can't force the stars to align when they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh  Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
1:09 aww my fav part 🥺🥺
ph we’ve traveled the sea’s🥺
this song puts me to sleep.
conan owns my heart
Just perfect🧚‍♀️
mil deslikes é serio isso quem deu deslike bate em idoso e cachorro certeza mds
no mom, get me down listening to astronomy, it's not a stage it's a lifestyle
this song is just so fuking good, it gives me cmbyn vibes for some reason and I'm living for it
🖤

I'm so vulnerable after this
This deserves billions of views. Please share this song! I can't imagine people missing out astronomy!!
the most beautiful human
🥺
He's amazing !
hes just so pretty
It's safe to say that he's driving through the same road that he filmed the story in
This song will forever be my favourite, I’TS LITERALLY 2 OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS MIXED INTO ONE BEAUTIFUL SONG, Conan Gray and astronomy (like the actual study)
The slippery attention reportedly desert because bench bailly disarm apropos a eager porter. well-groomed, nostalgic quiet
😍❤️😍
He has changed so much In the last five years I removed him having that high Voice
THIS REMINDS ME OF THE BOOK “THE SONG OF ACHILLES”
You're art ✨
You're art ✨
You're art ✨
You're art ✨
You're art ✨
You're art ✨
I'm rewatching this and I am still in love
un minuto de silencio por los que no han escuchado esta obra de arte
I am not heart broken but damn, this song made me that I am.💔
I was wondering why some people dislike this song... It's really beautiful. Maybe not their taste.
nice voice:D
Estoy que le hago stream, Conan te amo

Conan is perfect
Conan's song are what keep me going
No one's talking about how beautiful this music video really is.
THE LYRICS UGH THEY HIT HARD
Pov: you are the luckiest person in the world 💗✨
Low key sounds a little like that song falling in love at the coffee shop. Big vibe
I create fanfics in my head and conan releases a clip like that im gonna cry
The equable butcher perplexingly mourn because viscose superfamily collect amongst a volatile handball. finicky, zesty music
it feels like i’m in bed with him i’m SHAKING
The beginning of the song with just the guitar kinda sounded like heather
this video is literally just a boyfriend pov
I love Conan✨

I love this song so much
Eu amei essa musicaaaa
I mean the song isn't really about the one line in the begining but "runnaway father's and mothers who drank". I have a alcoholic neglectful mother and I cling to anyone who has experienced what I have so I am glad you spoke out about that.
gracias por tanto arte
"It's astronomy with just you and me"
It's just incredible
Conan, I just wanted to let you know your songs make me so happy! :)
Aquí escuchando arte ♡

Essa doeu....
The first time i watch his video is the one he introduced himself when he's still a kid.. i thought that was a random meme youtube recommended but then i found Heather and the video of him introducing recommended again. Thats when i thought "wow , look at him now. He's grown up and being a good looking man" 😍😍
Las canciones de Conan Gray son lo mas hermoso que existe en este mundo
te amo conan por ti le hecho ganas a la prepa 😩✌✌
With Runaway mothers n Father's who drank  My life b like😂
Conan : I haven't had my first kiss yet Also Conan : Writing a lot of love songs
This is what it sounds like when two hearts collide 💕
2:58 yw <3

i feel this song
i just came across Conan and his music and OMG. i haven't seen this much aesthetic and songwriting originality in a LONG TIME. Absolutely beautiful. he deserve WAY more attention.
Twerk
he soothes with his songs 🤧
i feel safe everytime I hear this song. it’s so therapeutic
Bro. Conans beautful and. I think im inlove
Creo que me encanta Conan
Cada día escucho esta canción y la verdad... No me arrepiento.
i love your songs, your originality, your voice, it's just perfect
Idk why but it kinda reminds me of Jughead and Betty from Riverdale lol
Temardo
I really need harry styles and Conan to Collab or them and Olivia
Imagine watching this video in a vr
i’m so proud on conan. this music video and this song is literally so beautiful and it makes me so happy omg.
Mood : Conan Gray - Astronomy minute 3:20

Yine bir şarkıya gönül verdik. 💛
Fan of a lot oh heavy stuff. But this is something worth to calm me for a while. This guy has a great 10 years coming. Hope to see more
to the boy who help me 7yrs ago, i hope you still remember our promises that you'll find me and and we will watch the moon together, again. i'll wait for you
i fell deeply in love w/ this song❤️
is it just me or this song makes me cry
The way Conan deceives me is different.
Lyrics:                            We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy  I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it  And if you ask me how I'm feeling Don't tell me you're too blind to see  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up) (Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)  We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it Inside we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it  I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry
Conan 💙

What a masterpiece!
This song breaks my heart 💔
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
This vibes gave me the Disney vibes
So this is Conan? That's why many people loved him so much. It's my first time listening to his voice and I am a fan now. That lyrics is superb ❤️❤️❤️
Im u r big fan in Korea ! There are many fans I like your voice and your songs!!♪(๑ᴖ◡ᴖ๑)♪ this song is dope Plz come to Korea after Covid19 is over. If you have a concert in Korea, I will definitely go there. i luv u so much⎝⎛♥‿♥⎞⎠
Listen to this when you're alone, it's a bliss of solitude ❤❤
AWW
Is it just me or this guy looks like “Nothing” in Perks of being a Wallflower movie :)
This song really need more recognition of just how beautiful this is along with other of his songs. Its kinda sad why he is one of the under rated singers out there when there is more meaning and stories from his.🥺💕
🌟👄🌟 💞
oh my boyfriend
"Young people's love doesn't last forever " :(
Conan's voice is just. Amazing.
song hits different when the man you once loved was the complete opposite of you and left you for that reason
he got all dressed up for me :')
Conan!!
It's so hard to be in a long distance relationship, this song describes it beautifully and painfully
you inspire me to achieve my dreams...
tenia que hacer tarea y terminé repitiendo y repitiendo astronomy por como 5789 veces. Ahora llevo 20 min llorando y mi tarea... Mi tarea no la hice pero fue por una buena causa...
That “it’s time to go” is so sad and you can really feel how hurt he was.
On my way to add this to my playlist
<3
this is so soothing. thank you for this, conan! love youuuu 🥺
ITS ASTRONOMY WERE 2 WORLD APART
this is supposed to be the astronomy mv not pov: conan is ur bf but i aint complaining tho
this song...
You have no idea how much this relates to my life at the moment thank you 🖤🖤❤️❤️
Conan's voice sounds so calming and nostalgic like a warm hug from someone you love
this is what sleeping in when it's raining feels like
I'm obsessed with this.......
💖 this beautiful song got me introduced to him. Such a marvelous song  it is; makes one immediately fall in love with it.
I looooooooove this song and you, Conan Gray ❤️
I would live my whole life listening to his songs 🌱
my obsession ❤️
i love this song sooo  muich conan i love u
I watched this in my English class lol
I’m so happy he exists because without his music I wouldn’t be me, he is life changing in the best ways anyone can imagine. lob u Conan <3
All his songs it's like a love story And this song is how ending.
I love you, Conan. If you only know I will die for you
wow i'm in love
Is it just me who thinks this song beat at 1:57 is inspired by "Sad Beautiful Tragic" ?
stunning m bae
How soothing conan's voice is 😭😟
im so attracted to conan i cant even express it with words
SUCH A LOVELY VOICE, BOY & MUSIC. ❤️
Wish Sub Urban and Conan wrote a song together they would work so well together!
INSANE BEAUTY BYE
I binge listen to Conan and I was ashamed because why am I sleeping to this ENCHANTING ARTIST? His music is heartfelt and pretty damn relatable. I wish him all the glory and success. 🤍🤎
Your songs are so perfect-- Thanks for that.
estou passando por uma situação em que essa música se encaixa perfeitamente, tudo se liga. eu tive um amor e depois de muito tempo essa  pessoa apareceu novamente em minha vida e tudo que eu sinto está nessa música, eu percebi que não é como antes, eu seu que eu tenho que partir, mas fechar esse ciclo é tão difícil... mas o "nós" já morreu.
This feels like one last hug goodbye and it's beautifully heart-wrenching
Weeks in to this n it gives me major eargasm every time I hear it ✨🥺
WOw just wOW. I'm not even gay but, I may reconsider
We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought, if I wanted, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done) We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart Stop trying to keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop trying to keep us alive You can't force the stars to align when they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
Aesthetics though...
“You’re pointing at stars in the sky that already died” is a GENIUS line considering it actually would take many many years for us to see the light go out on a star that’s already been dead. Mad props.
Is it only me or can anyone also listen what seems like Olivia in the background at "you said distance brings fondness...but I guess not with us part..." At around 2:16 to 2:19...
Una colaboración de él con olivia  ♥️♥️♥️😭
From far away I wish I'd stayed with you... But here face to face...just a stranger that I once knew... This part got me...
I was singing along yesterday when my parents heard it for the first time. I played it from the beginning for them. My parents are over 40 yrs old and they both cried when they heard this. It broke my heart
I cant he is so adorable💖💖💖💖💖
ma fav artist so farrrrrr keep this great work uppppppppp 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
OKAY WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT MY DUDE LOOKS LIKE THE GUY FROM STRANGER THINGS
this song reminds me of fall in love in a coffee shop - london pigg
muy bomnita, ya puedo morir en   paz
He hits alot of what happened in my past
Im so proud of him and happy for him too congrats love you you inspire me
Ok conan, mandei o valor da minha terapia por direct pq vc não responde ?! Deu uma pra fugir das responsabilidades? 🙄💝
777
❤️❤️❤️
Ok guys I put this song during a very emotive chapter of a book, Now I cannot listen to this and just stop crying
✨✨🦸🚣🚣
Love this sm.
I LOVE IT I LOVE IT IIIII LOVEEEEEE ITTTTTTTT😭
Nunca te ví así que no puedo decir que te amo pero ME ENCANTAS.✨💞
te amo papito rico
thanks for creating such a beautiful bridge 😌❤ now i'm sobbing 😃👍
Wow.
This remains me of "All the Bright Places"
I love Conan's songs it's give me comfort and peace
Conan, se vc ver uma garota ruiva com cabelos longos e lisos berrando no seu show, nn se preocupe, sou eu kkkkkkkkkk
This video feels too intimate in full screen I've gotta scroll the comments and watch it picture-in-picture
Conan deserves more recognition.
かわいい…。可愛すぎる。リアコ案件。愛してる
I went crazy after listening to this beautiful song !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This song owns many heats❤
does Conan gray answer?
KILIG when he turned around ✨♥️
hi, your song "astronomy" really stole my heart and look what i did—im already your fan T _ T
Ah🥺💔💔💔
When u know that his lyrics are pieces of his life story-
Its so good
Conan is my living howl♡ (from howls moving castle)
my definition of aesthetic is CONAN GRAY itself 🥰❤️
why is this so good
Pra que isso cara??? tava tudo tão bonitinho no começo terminei chorando 🤧🤧🤧
watching this in a VR would make me cry
I was just trying to sleep but this song was stuck in my head and I realized-- this song is like 2 people who aren't compatible bc their star signs aren't compatible. Idk it reminds me of me and my friend that always argue bc she's a cancer and I'm an aquarius. This sounds stupid if I write it out, but it makes 100% sense in my head
Is no one going to talk about how Conan went from really whatever to alt to slightly fem alt to cottagecore and somehow manages to make them all look amazing..
I don’t know what’s like to be in a relationship or going through a breakup but with this song I’m feeling like cry for someone I don’t know and love yet  🤧
This song and "Off my face X Holy" by "A2JUN" are keeping me sane during these times ❤️✨😍
At this point I listen to this song at least once every single day
conny, can we hangout forever 👉👈
love u
I think this is my fave Conan Gray song now <3
Conan, your music save me
o cantor que não lança música ruim, entenda o caso.
Hi Conan please respond and also *Astronomy twerking*
Alright, I'm coming here every single day because this is what makes me alive
“you said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us” SHUT UP IT HURTS
Conan has made it so far I’m so proud of him 🙃
https://youtu.be/7jpqqBX-Myw
Paz
nossa que vontade terrível de chorar até encher o pacifico inteiro
if they don't play this song at my funeral I'm not dying.
I got emotional after this song cause this song really make me realised to my dreams ❤️ lots of love to those astros who's listening it❤️❤️❤️
The story y Heather tuvieron un bebé y le pusieron "Astronomy"
No mamá, llorar con Astronomy de fondo no es una etapa, es un estilo de vida
Conan I love u
esta canción es tan relajante, la amo <3
i would die for u conan
can someone explain me the song "Heather", i don't understand it clearly T_T
💛  0:42 someone  just please  tell me that's not true  : | 🙏🏻
Why is no one talking about where this music video is filmed it’s so gorgeous
iiiiiiii loveeeee itttttttt😭🥺💜💜💜💜
So sweet. So pure. So Conan.
This is soO great I swear🌼
The beginning is giving me Heather vibes haha
masterpiece....very melodious song
I really love this♡
How to fall in love with my screen or Conan Gray
This point of view is breathtaking, feels like I'm hanging out with Conan
This is one of my favourite artists
he's so underrated,why?
just take your headphones and enjoy this masterpiece <3
Why Conan Gray music is being underrated? 😬
We drive through the woods Rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked That they were too good for us  Cause socially speaking we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time Young love don't last for life  And now I know Now I know It's time to go It's time to go  We've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  From far away I wish I'd stayed with you But here face to face A stranger that I once knew  I thought if I wandered I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness But guess not with us  The only mistake That we didn't make Was run Now look what we've done  We've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh we've died Ooh  Oh, we've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart
Somehow remember the story "dead stars"... this is so sad...
This song is so deep and true. Hits me right in my feels
Conan music is my life,all my life.❤️🪐✨
Astronomy es arte
i love youu <3
I come here daily to calm down and forget about everything😌🎶
I come here daily to calm down and forget about everything😌🎶
Idk about you but CONAN is the definition of aesthetic to me💗💫
❤✨🙌🇹🇭
buraya daha gelmedin galiba
conans songs make me feel like the main character. because i am
Thank you Swb💗
If y’all like this style of music, I highly recommend “Falling in love at a coffee shop” by Landon Pigg 💕. Anyway, this song is gorgeous 🥺
if aesthetic was person it would be conan
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS SONG THANK YOU THANK YOU.
Why doesn’t this have more views wha?
I love this so so so so so much.
What the fuck its 2021 and I just discovered this guy omg
“we’re two worlds apart”  me: yes conan we really are.
💕
I’ve been here since you were in your home making waffles and showing us your art portfolio and being accepted to ur dream school and leaving Texas ….The only artist I’ve literally seen grow up before my eyes🥺
Is it just me or is conan literally acting psycho in this but he still looks hot😂
THIS SONG IS LITERALLY GORGEOUS I LOVE IT😭
POV: you're on a date with conan
Youtube stop i was listening olivia rodrigo and every fucking day i watch this video after deja vu i hate now this song and makes me feel hungry watch the mv of conan
where's my girlish boy? ♥
PERFECTION😭😭😭😭😭
❤️❤️💜💜❤️❣️❤️🤍🧡💛💚💙❤️💕💞💓💗❣️💖❤️💝💘
https://youtu.be/PNKxAWiu4Fc
conan sings about my biggest fear, loosing love for someone when they’re madly in love with you, or having someone in love with you and having to break the news you dont feel the same way, i fall out of love so easily and i dont wanna hurt someone
*we've seen everything, from saturn to mars*
ARTE. maravilloso ✨✨✨
break his heart and he'll break your wall
Conan es todo lo bueno <3 sus canciones siempre me acompañan tanto en los momentos tristes como en los alegres y escucharlas me da paz para seguir y no rendirme en esta etapa difícil y en general toda mi vida (mi ingles no es bueno) Conan is all that is good <3 his songs always accompany me both in sad and happy moments and listening to them gives me peace to continue and not give up in this difficult stage and in general all my life
can u make astronomy acoustic ver ??? 😩
this is really helping me get over that one person who doesn’t want me the way i want them. :,)
pov: youre listening to this masterpiece 40 times a day
this song came out at the right time in my life thank you conan <33
Tarzan vibe
None of his song not good😂 all his song became my favorite song😂
Conan, u the best! If you're reading this. I like youuUuuuuuuuu!!!! ♥️
this song warms my heart
te amo ):
The Story : We could both run away  Astronomy: The only mistake that we didn't do was run
i love u conan
*the only mistake that we didn't make is run*
he’s so underrated...
Dear conan, I am never disappointed in your music because every time there exists a certain feeling in your song, when i go down to my garden i listen to your music and let the trees and plants listen too in order to recognize such feelings and feel it in their roots. (To every Lebanese who might be reading this, i love you and stay safe)
Conan, you are a human. And in my opinion that's the hardest role one can be, you write your music to give listeners the feeling that you are feeling either it's pain or love or joy, you deserve the earth and what it gives you from blessings and health because you are to gentle yet careful, as a fan i adore you, however as a human being (i guess) I'm proud of you.
this is poetic.
Comfort songggggggggg
Amooo
outfit qwq i- l- o- v- e- t- h- e- m-
poor wall
yes goooo bestie YASSSSSSSSSSS
i love u
ur soo pretty wtf
1:08 omg that part was soooooooooooooo fucking cute wtf wtf twf
Conan reminds of Freddie mercury and it melts my heart that they’re both very talented
YALL WHY DOES HE LOOK GOOD FROM EVERY ANGLE😭😭😭😭
“oh yk conan gray?” “the guy who wrote hea-💥🔫🙄
1:05 2:15 🥰😭
stop comparing Conan with Olivia.
conan i love you :(
i love you with my soul, you´re everything <3
conan te amo mucho, todo lo que haces es muy hermoso y este mv es demasiado lindo gracias por tanto mereces más reconocimiento
a hug for everyone who needs it ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
B E A U T I F U L !!! It's a such perfect song! I love you Conan Gray...! <3 Thank you for this perfect, perfect song with so many emotions, love and astronomy. It envolves me in a special atmosphere. Your beautiful voice, your music and lyrics are master pieces. I love you. This song is therapetic...Thanks again ♡ Blessings and good vibes to you!
Why doesn't this have more attention?  This is pretty underrated.
I first listened to the audio and it sounded like lazy summers and driving in the sunset. It's fascinating how the video has similar visuals. Also the outro was cathartic✨
Istg if my man ain't conan gray, then he ain't my man at all, no caps
Ok I have singing lessons and Whenever we finish up early (we as in me and my teacher) she asks - which Conan grey song will we sing now- lol I have sung all your songs and will sing all your upcoming songs! You are so good at it never stop you have such a soothing voice one second and a strong loud voice the next!
Conan’s music is like air it helps me live
My heart and soul just died too😭😭😭💖So beautiful 💖
that bridge is everything
❤️
Baby, how long you gonna write about them for?
❤🇧🇷
With runaway fathers and mothers who drank...WOW WOW WOW!!!
The lyrics, the music, the music video... Beautiful
The Story vibes
Why does this remind me of Jacob and Bella? Anyone else?
I'm so really appreciate your all your songs , and it gives inspiration from us💕
WTF IDK why I ended up here.  I heard this guy's name before but never checked out his song and I ended up here and now I'm depressed
We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) we're two worlds apart From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought, if I wanted, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness", but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done) We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart we're two worlds apart Stop trying to keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop trying to keep us alive You can't force the stars to align when they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh-oh-oh Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
All I need  Conan, Olivia Rodrigo are going to collab with Taylor Swift
ERR why cant force stars align when they're already die?
all of his songs r so aesthetic
Oh My God how his every Song is so touching. It's Super Awesome Conan
It's time become a stan😌
Conan’s music is just BEAUTY
nobody:  conan’s parents: let’s have the most breathtaking and beautiful son ever.
Conan te amo 💖 esta canción me da tanta frescura, debería de tener más reconocimiento y además conan cada día se ve más bello✨🐸
"We're two world's apart" this torns my heart into pieces💔
I love these beautiful song <3 that´s wonderful =) amazing <3 <3
Love it<3
really this is something beautiful
conan looks like an angel in that white shirt
That awkward moment when you find yourself replacing the "you" with your happiness...I'm fine I swear.
Why is this song so addictive and also I see lot of dislikes, like we all know many people don't have good taste.
i've watch this mayble like thousand of times.... but why i can't get bored??????????
Finally, peace.
Conan creats magic✨✨✨
This is My favorite song in this moment
conan knows we are all in love with them
I'm not heartbroken...but this song makes me feel like I'm broken!!😟
I'd love to see him and Aurora collab 💖
Me first time watch this video: OMG this is a POV video, bloody nose bloody nose.

Ngano man ka oy. Labyo Conan bahalag mapanakit imong kanta
The video  and the song literally  screams aesthetic
Damn so good , i love u
Conan Gray y Troye Sivan es la colaboración que todo mundo necesitamos♡♡♡
when are conan and taehyung collaborating ?? they have the same music taste and even give off the same vibes
Ily Conan Gray 🥺💞
i dont have words to describe it
This makes me  think about someone who only exists in my imagination,we talk everyday,we laugh and cry  and this person or maybe angel is the only one I can rely on.I dont have to be self conscious around this angel.but at the end of day  ,I'm talking to myself this person doesn't exist ..we cant meet. We've been through so much together but that's it... it's not real. 🥺If I could just see this person once...
*plain twerking**
Todo lo q haces es arte, te amo:(
This hits so deep. Pls help me understand why I feel so sad and ecstatic all at the same time🤧
"we're two worlds apart" hurts when all your boyfriends are anime characters :'((
I love you conan

Conan Gray songs hits different to me.(628)
When my zodiac sign doesn't math with my crushes one:
Thank you

Still streaming this
•_•
This is the song I want to keep to myself.. Some things are for ourselves.. I felt something which is hard to explain..
the amount of gender envy this man gives me
who knew i'd come to love "astronomy" TT
Yessss
The angry asparagus architecturally crawl because jaguar externally double failing a juicy centimeter. cynical, simplistic waste
in the words of the great billie eilish, i love you
te amo demasiado, amo demasiado esta musica, amo todo AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This song is going to be in a movie soon
I literally can stay on my bed hearing your voice all day
k but the amount of chaos at the end 😌
conan, ur voice such an angel. ah, no. u r an angel tho <33
conan is so talented pls
Watching this video and lyrics says: *"Two worlds appart"*  You guys get it? :D Separate from screen rn :)
Alguien que hable español😭👍
Te amo
this song helps me go through my break up. thanks conan <3
Nah.
Oh Conan, why I am so love in you?!?!?!?!? You're different from all the celebrities I've ever liked.
this video and song are so beautiful i can't find the words
This song gives me feels I never knew existed
médico: você tem 4:10 minutos de vida  eu: põe astronomy do conan gray
Lov u Conan! </3
'You can't force the stars to align' I felt that.
All his songs sound the same but I’m kinda here for it
flaco, te amo a vos y tus canciones
**cutely twerks cause im cute uwu**
Ah it feels good and bad relating to this song when you are the one who left ..
conan and olivia colab is all i want
Bts y conan gray por favor 💜💜💜💪
Hits hard when you were the one keeping a relationship on their own.
A minute of silence for the people who have not found this beautiful song.
how the hell is a kid like this writing this lyrics! wow that's talent
i love this song so much conan! Thank you. But really, TYSM
Conan's songs make me find myself
When we notice how the music video goes from a happy soul to all cries and struggles
i get call me by your name vibes in his new music video. it's like you are falling in love in italy
Waiting for conan and olivia collab🥺
This video is a POV: Conan is your boyfriend
The motivational video guy?
Since I heard the "Heather" of him...his songs became one of my consolers and he's indeed an SUPERB.
omg the way he sing "died~"... i can feel ur heart
You are such a strong form of art.
This is what heaven feels like -
pure art.
i always feel like no one gets me but i feel like conan would get me his music really gets to me in such a different way than anything else
I was in love to a girl, ultil she sent me this music talking about other boy
I need a Conan Gray Tiny Desk Concert A.S.A.P
this song makes me feel so nostalgic.
is a hate crime u launch this song one day after i break up
I imagine myself listening to this song just staring at the beatiful night sky or hiking mountains.
OH GOD this song is good while hiking or just wondering at the night sky.
look at them bowled legs
jojowain po
**astronomically twerking**
Dear D 1:50 :)
I want to forget this song, just to hear it again and fall in love in the same way when I heard it for the first time.
i’m at a low in my life and his music is what makes me feel like i’m not alone. need somebody? i just listen to conan
I love this 🥺
Ok I got chills and this song is so perfect, but If I keep on listening to his music Ill be destroyed, I just wanna cry!
Thanks for the pre-sleep fake scenario fuel
can we pls talk abt how this song is lyrically beautiful
Te amo conan gracuas pir existir
*astronomic twerking*
this is the feeling. this is the thing I lost, the thing I never had. the reason why my life will never be complete. the ethereal loneliness of missing that person, the love they never gave, the home im looking for.
I need a Conan Gray/Olivia Rodrigo collab in my life
Why is he Per-fect his so charming.hes just being himself and I love him
Why he's so Per-fect...? It's 🤸🏻‍♀️💕💋✨💅
PLEASE I WANNA BE THAT CAMERA
It's homophobic that conan doesn't gonna marry me
Holyyyy SHEEESH
Qui l'écoutait bien avant qu'il soit connu 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️
I can tell that Conan is a fan of Taylor Swift from this song.
The best of the best ❤️
He is so charming with calm voice🍃
I felt all the emotions to ever exist in 4 minutes 10 seconds

UnpUtAzOdoliamenos:( TeamoConAnxD Siempre tienes las palabras correctas pa' tus canciones en el momento indicado:'3 👌🏻😔❤️
It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart...
doutor, esse foi o motivo do meu colapso.
🥺🥺
the story of this song feels like a continuation of Heather... conan is gay?
I think we need an Ashe and Conan collab
"socially speaking" part blew me away :D
Conan is literally my source of happiness rn😀👍
question: who Olivia are u talking about? Olivia O'Brien?
🤍
This is probably the most soothing and relaxing song I have ever heard...
Everyone Else: I need a Taylor swift and Conan collab Me: What about a Melanie Martinez and Conan collab?
*sad twerking*
True fact: everybody want to be this cameraman
Twerking from the heaven*
I think this song deserves more attention and views
This song really makeS my heart 💘💖 Plus imagine Conan sang this right infront of your face🥺
Is it just me or Conan voice get deeper every comeback?
💔
Even though we're two world apart Conan literally own my heart  😢👉👈💗
i lowkeyly think conan and troye sivan can create spark together
THIS SONG IS SO GOOD
WHO TF DISLIKED THE SONG
I keep falling for you Conan😍
This song is a masterpiece!
firsr time watching his MV 🌅🙂💙
i guess the Dessert backround was originally from "The Story" and used it again here, such a two great music from Conan <3
Why am i crying????!??
🖤🖤
this is such a masterpiece. i'm gland spotify suggested this to me.
WHY ARE YOU SO BEAUTIFUL
Another underrated song from conan 😭😭😭💓
this is art
His music is so beautiful it hits me on a personal level
Why this one is so UNDERRATED!!!
this is everything i love his voice
If I was told to answer a question about astronomy I'd put, Conan Gray.
Hello! Our band just released a new cover and we'd love it if you could check it out!:)
The sweater I need to snatch. I’ll get u one made out of polyester
This song wrecks me
I decided to listen to him cause à twitter post told me my song would be "the girls ft conan gray" according to my birthday and sign and I wasn't expecting this much talent
3:00 this line is amazing!
look at my user, i had to
Conan Gray is so inspired from the lyrics, the clips and the melody. Touch the bottom of the soul. It's accurate and perfect!
its the hair for me
Why is no one appreciating how beautifully this is written OH MY GOD
I feel so calm while listening to this in a mad world
🥺💓
ily conan
my eyes & ears have been blessed he's literally so pretty, he sounds so pretty, the video is so pretty... bye
This bridge is insane!!!! I love it so much
There is only one Conan gray is this world, and he is perfect ✋😣
Lol i come here everyday now
I'm obsessed w this song
Pa vlog ka anamn ule mamshie🥺
thank god i grow up in conan's era
Wow 😳
Wouldn't Change A Thing: We're Venus and Mars Seven: Love you to the moon and to Saturn Astronomy: We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars
Wouldn't Change A Thing:We're Venus and Mars.We're like different stars. Astronomy:We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars...We're two worlds apart.
he's probably gonna be single forever cuz no one is even remotely close to be good enough for him
Conan is the type of guy that girls like to hang out and talk their problems to.
Imagine Conan and Billie colab
the amount of love for this song that i have
conan i cant im crying
really didn’t need to cry more today, but yk, it’s worth it
Me after watching Olivia driver license and start *twerking*
Conan is great
I don't really listen to his music, it's not much of my type. The only reason I'm here is that me and my friend are doing a “Music trade” thing, where she listens to my type of music and I listen to her type of music. But Conan Gray has some interesting music, I can get why people enjoy his art. He looks quiet young and he has an amazing voice, He seems he has come a long way and that's amazing for him <3
Y so underrated song deserves more recognition ♥️💫
My 969th time listening
Wow this is a moooooddddd
Not me actually going through this rn
✨
im crying bye
te amo
So good!!
i feel like I'm floating whenever i hear this. this is so ethereal. wow.
you deserve the universe :( <33
coming here every day until this mv reaches 10 million views :/
this song is just--
❤️❤️❤️❤️
God while making me: lets make this lad live for conan
Not only is he a good singer and song writer, but he’s a good actor.  I like how it started out happy then he went slowly insane and broke down at the end.  Truly amazing❤️❤️❤️
✨MAGIC✨
Conan's songs are my life bro
"its astronomy, were two worlds apart"
this song hit so hard for what
“I thought if I wondered I’d fall back in love”  I really felt that one
🎶💕💕💕💕❤❤
Well this is pure honey to hear. my ears couldn't stop smiling...if you know wht i mean
I love you
this song feels like the old conan, i love it
Conan's voice gives me peace
Woah.
Does anyone know where I can get that jacket. The brown one with blue pockets and a pink collar
This is so good, conan 😭
I'm proud of Conan. Because his songs are really high quality and not stolen. He is not making songs for tiktok. He is making songs for real music listeners. If you are here right now and you see this comment, you are the taste owner.
The dislikes are from those who were bawling their eyes out and their vision was blurry
This song couldn’t have come out at a more perfect time 💔
aesthetic
I LOVE UR SONGS u work soo hard and deserve ALL UR FOLLOWERS I hope that one day u will be as famous as ariana or harry style 😌 (i hope u see this cause u r the best pls reply so i know u have seen this it will mean the world to me)
I've never loved a song this much-  like what a masterpiece!
Wow! Excelente video y la canción es hermosa ♡.♡
#Effortless Always Make's My Day Happy
🤍
i just started crying this song reminds me so much of his earlier songs. i can’t put into words how much it already means to me
A love story that will never be..... Good song.. I have never heard of this dude... I love the Youtube Rabbit hole!!!!!
this song keep playin' in my head since it was dropped.🥺😭
This song is heavenly and thanks a lot for inventing this wonderful masterpiece
"You said distance brings fondness But guess not with us"
Oh conan I wish I could meet you once in this lifetime <3
Kinda feels good.This song resonates so much when you have fallen out of love with someone and you understand that it isn't your fault anymore.You were incompatible with the other person from the start so hey cheer up
✿
Conan te amo :(
iloveyouuuuu conan
This is the perspective of the boy Conan sing the Heather for
behind the scenes https://youtu.be/jMjIlhvOtEM
this is ✨ ethereal ✨ been drowning to your songs and help cause i won't ever be out of drowning ily conan
We cant force stars to align 😖
What your aesthetic  Conan grey's aesthetic beyond visualization
IS PERFECT
Ese “DIED” me tiene justo así
no words available in the dictionaries to describe this song right here, it's beyond this galaxy.
Olivia R. x Conan G. Collaboration please! I want to see them in one music video, the bestfriends! 😭❤
woww
Okay but this song sounds just like another one I heard but I can’t figure out which one :/
We're two worlds apart
SOOOO GOOD S2
i listened to this music soooo many time today. i just LOVED IT! S2 congrats conan (;
I would die for Conan Gray and Troye Sivan collab....an mv from them would be sooo amazing!❣️😍👌😍
Happy World astronomy day😘🇮🇳
1 week anniversary of the greatest thing ever WHOO HOOO
We drive through the woods Rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked That they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time Young love don't last for life And now I know Now I know It's time to go It's time to go We've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart From far away I wish I'd stayed with you But here face to face A stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness But guess not with us The only mistake That we didn't make Was run Now look what we've done We've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh, we've died Ooh Oh, we've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart
this song makes me cry

He is so beautiful, my heart aches.
What if Conan colab with BTS😍
Is it just me or did the parts in the second half where he’s sifting in the white shirt in the rain give off Falling music video vibes? I mean I LOVE it but is it just me?
Conan is making me cry about the first love I never had. I've literally been single my whole life and this song, is making me miss or nostalgic of someone who never existed.  Damn Conan ur such a wonderful lyricist and musician!!!
this song made me think about Alyssa and James
Here Again I LOVE YOU CONE💜

Stop whatever you're doing. Go lie on your bed. Play this video. Watch Conan gaze into your eyes while he's also on his bed. Feel loved in a way you've never felt. Thank me later.

Played it at 0.75 speed and made me 10x sad and relaxed at the same time
Y pensar que empecé a escuchar a Conan por la morra que me gusta :)
Me encantó la canción y más la parte final, pero le faltó ese enganche al inicio. 7/10
I just wanna hug him
ВСЕ ЯСНО КОНАН ВСТРЕЧАЕТСЯ С ОПЕРАТОРОМ
I love this vibe
His VOICE

dear conan thank you for this masterpiece, this is truly a piece of art, a piece of your heart and feelings and tysm for sharing it with us. I'm so so proud of you, Astronomy is one of your best songs ever, it's so healing, ethereal, nostalgic but painful at the same time. It is playing on repeat, it's my new comfort place. I feel so safe listening to it. I feel like someone holds my hand and promises to never let it go. Thank you for creating this masterpiece that accompanies me through hard times and makes me cry but heals me at the end
This is just feeding my wattpad fanfic relationship with him 🛐
Cadê os brasileiros???
Wow! Conan it's a such amazing talented artist, this song it's just so beautiful and peaceful..
*chills. literal chills*
The line that hit me hard was "with runaway fathers and mothers who drink" :(
i can't explain the masive peace conan's music gives to me <3
s a d y e e h a w
this song is a whole mood
Another song to cry to ...
Conan we love you that's all you need to know
This made me cry 3 in the morning wtf

¿Como una canción puede doler tanto?
BEAUTIFULL
Omg! This is too good!!♡
2M!! OMG 😭😭😭
i love him soooo much.. isn't he so beautiful.. i love his words he sings
I loved it
I cry everytime i hear this. Conan understands us😭
wow, ily so much
This song was all I needed lately. Conan is my person blanky, and the melody of the song and his soft voice nourish the soul and heal the cracks.
It’s so hard to love myself
https://youtu.be/aE5z2GAlfvo https://youtu.be/aE5z2GAlfvo YALL SEEN THIS?¿?
Who TF disliked  Get ready to die
This reminds me of “Greatly Appreciated” from Adventure Time
diliatin Conan salting gw
bestie virtual hug
the lyrics hit differently :)
Nossa essa música é demais cara, ela e relaxante mais ao meamo tempo triste isso é muito bom de ouvir! ❤❤❤👏👏
CONAN I FREAKING LOVE YOU SM
* *taurus twerking* *
İt’s astronomy.
This is so cute :<
I just... love the vibe so much.
im happy that conan dropped another song, but this song do be making me tear up huh.
Conan treating us like y/n
Conan's songs are always saving me😭♥️
reminds me of my bestfriend.
Great lyrics!
it's nice to be born to my family but I decided to move and keep distance with them, learning that their love to me is conditional. We're two worlds apart.
Finally, the planets stopped twerking
What a masterpiece u've made bruuuhhh 🤯
I probably watched this for like 100000 times?!? I'm inlove with Conan's voice
This song takes me to heaven everytime I listen to it 😌
People who love also leave, feeling is something strong and unique. You can love that person a lot, but know that maybe it's time to go, due to several factors. You are not selfish for letting her (the) just love you too much to know that it is right to let go. Loves that stay and go, always stay in our heads, accept that loving is not always being for someone.  beautiful music, comes out with depression 😢
This song reminds me of Twilight 😭🥺🖤
This is so alive.
Not at the way i can show his songs to my friends and say 'i haven't heard one single song of conan's i dislike, every one is BEAUTIFUL n makes you tear up; how is this even possible??"
It fits perfect with this rainy morning
His songs always inspired me to look forward and get over something that is unsure. I love him so much
This is simply magnificient and wow  wow no words THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE MUSIC!
I literally love it...
Love the lyrics... #littleswifties #conan
omg
resembles w the car on The Story mv
Unpopular thought: Conan lowkey would look cool as a teenage Mowgli in Jungle Book
Here from heather to astronomy
2:19
I love this I’ve watched over a million times
I feel like I'm hanging out with him in this vid 😂
it must've been awkward to record this... totally worth it tho
i listened to this right after the story and i suddenly realise that they sound so alike 😱😱
Ohh Conan your Mom Taylor and Sister Olivia was so proud of you! 😌💗
i love this
WHY DOES THIS GUY ALWAYS MAKE SONGS WHICH ARE VERY ACCURATE ABOUT US AND OUR MINDS - :')
It's astronomy..

I found my refuge in this song
Taurus falling in love with Aquarius
Conan's eres mi religión ✨✨✨

I love u
even though the stars have already died, conan gives us life's meaning with his songs.
Lyrics for yall I guess  We drive through the woods Rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked That they were too good for us  Cause socially speaking we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time Young love don't last for life  And now I know Now I know It's time to go It's time to go  We've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  From far away I wish I'd stayed with you But here face to face A stranger that I once knew  I thought if I wandered I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness But guess not with us  The only mistake That we didn't make Was run Now look what we've done  We've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh we've died Ooh  Oh, we've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart
he's my crush
Oef his music kills me💕
Never fail to impress
No se porque... Pero los acordes de la guitarra se escuchan tan parecidos a los acordes de Heather, pero siguen siendo diferentes, contando una historia conectada, pero con distintos caminos. Totalmente Mágico.  Tal vez estoy exagerando...
the vibe>>>>✨🎶💕💖🌹😢😊
muy fea esta csa, esta mas rika la genesis
Love conan
Maravilhoso 🥰💙
Nice song to cry.Conan gray you're great💜
morri fml
Por que fez isso? Realmente acreditei que pudesse confiar em você  Te mostrei feridas, que ninguém mais viu  Você as reabriu Estou sangrando até hoje
É difícil aceitar que somos dois mundos á parte Eu só queria um motivo  Uma explicação  Enquanto não me disser, continuarei pensando que fui inconveniente Um peso, talvez Eu preferia que você tivesse dito  Evitaria que eu deduzisse milhares de paranóias  Cansei de me humilhar pra te ter de volta  Espero que os astros se alinhem  E que eu me sinta menos pior conforme o tempo passa
I really wanna hug conan
"We are two worlds apart"  -Me singing to my favorite fictional character, crying because he's not real
https://youtu.be/wsfqhihwFEA
Conan: "we drive.." Me: agressively start to cry
SHLM & HaB (peace & love).  The Name of the Creator is Hayah asher Hayah, as what He told Mose (Exodus 3:14), preserved in the Hebrew Scriptures.  There is a curse to the G-o-d name (Isaiah 65:11-12), preserved in the Hebrew Scriptures.  All followers of the Messiah are to do the 7 appointed times (Leviticus 23), but no more animal sacrifices, following the Crucifixion of the Messiah.  We are now of the order of MLK TSDQ (King, righteous), to Whom ABRaHM tithed.  Ask the Messiah to be your personal Savior.  He is the Atoning Offering for mankind for the remission of sin ( 1 John 2:1-2).  He said to him, I am the way, the truth and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through me (John 14:6).  If you believe the Messiah died on the cross, & Resurrected three days later (presenting Himself as First Fruits to the Father), please ask Him to be your Savior.  He is the ONLY way to Everlasting Life.
Realmente canta espectacularmente hermoso
The amount of feelings that this song gave me... damn, Conan,  I love that I found you.
ME ENCANTO I LOVED
Esta canción es producto de "The Story" y "Heather", parece que tuvieron un hijo y que ahora se llama "Astrology". Un minuto de silencio por las personas que conocen el gran talento de Conan... 🤚🏻😔  This song is the product of "The Story" and "Heather", it seems that they had a son and that it is now called "Astrology". A minute's silence for people who know Conan's great talent... 🤚🏻😔

Não existe nenhuma música dele que não seja simplesmente ✨incrível✨
Me and my boyfriend watching the video: BF: He is so attractive  Me: Ik right he looks like a young Harry Styles BF: Omg true hahaha

*Esto es lo que realmente estaba buscando,  & lo encontré, amo a este hombre* ✨💯
Absolutely incredible
Me encanta 🧡🧡🧡 so deep conan. I need it 🤍
POV: Conan Gray is your boyriend
My next door neighbors are probably wondering what song this is since this is all that plays from my speakers...
How did he get into my head, like this reminds me so much of my ex and I didn't realize how much I missed him until now. Someone please give me advice on what to do. He still cuddles me, compliments me, holds my hand and hugs me more than friends usually do.. does he like me or not?? because he said he wasn't attracted to me in that way multiple times..
The fact he only knows 10 chords on guitar that all his songs have been made from and they are still world wide amazing. That’s talent 😱😭
buena rolita u.u
Yes
this song reminds me so much of him. i miss him.
he's so beautiful
Perfeitamente esplêndido!
People usually don’t understand why I like music like this so much.  “It’s so bad.” “Who would listen to this?” Me. I would. Songs like his saved my life and give me life and make me understand where I’m meant to be. All music in general has kept me alive as it inspires me to do better. Just know you’re enough and you can get through. No matter who you are. I love you <3
pure gold
Conan's music is a part of my life
Such a beautiful song.~
Ooh man , conan is facking beautiful and this song is awesome , it's extremely mood and my type  the music video is so Aesthetic I'm in luv with u
This makes me want to run to the person I know I shouldn't go back to.  We were so bad for each other, but damn I miss our conversations. (Don't worry.. I won't go back)😭
I will find who hurt you
😂 Wuv u boo 👏🙌👌
Brasileiros que amam essas músicas ❤️
this is so good i'm crying
lindo amor fez td disse tudo t amo mt vida

BEST SONG EVER
Quiero escucharla en acústico,solo él y su guitarra 🎸 🎶 💕 ♥olvidenlo!!🤦‍♀️ya lo hizo y yo no sabía ...este es el video 👉 https://youtu.be/YkmRDI2Y0KQ

I feel like a 60 year old heartbroken while silently reminiscing my first love  ...im only 19 and i dont even have a first love :’)
masterpiece.
pa llorar
jsuis ptn d'émue.
Conan is literally the only person who ever made me feel so understood in the deepest most naked yet comforting way. For someone who's been misunderstood all their life, that's the warmest feeling ever. Does that make sense?
Conan Gray reading for the role of dead amazing loving girlfriend in the male protagonist’s vhs flashback
It’s sad to know that I’ll never get to see him that closely.
My fav song atm

This is so comforting, the lyricss
I am so proud of you
I love you since 2017
Lil babe

“with runaway fathers and mothers who drank” this shouldn’t be so relatable 😐
🤧💖
https://youtu.be/A_0adYFeTuQ
Conan is so so cool!
La oigo a cada momento y todavía no puedo superarla ✨
Just... beautiful.
This is so beautiful 🪐
Will listen after Ramadan
Why does this feel like letting go?
Eu me apaixonei pela ideia desse clipe começar com ele meio como se estivesse interagindo através da câmera com cores vivas que remetem a felicidade e que de acordo com o que a letra nos diz a fotografia do vai mudando pra uma vibe mais sozinho e melancólico. Eu achei impecável. Fotografia incrível. Letra boa.
I cried to this song so beautiful 😍😍😍
I think Conan needs a hug 🧍🏻‍♀️ I think we all need a hug 🥺
Love you
The only bad thing about this song is that it ends
CONAN HOLY SHIT
https://youtube.com/shorts/IzumT-qzdaI?feature=share
"Two worlds apart" Me who's an international K-pop fan:  felt that !!!
Ya çıktı çıkalı tek dinlediğim müzik bu 2:58 favori bölümüm yaa huzur veriyo😌😌👌❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ aşırı yakışıklılık var klipde
I legitimately started crying at the end

to the person that may be reading this. im so proud of you, you’ve been trying your best & it may seem like no one notices how hard you have been trying. but keep on going you got this i know you do. i love you so much. here is a hug 🫂
3:53 **imagine having every argument with conan to end like that**
its been a few days and im still obsessed
I love you conan
Lyrics   We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go  We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart   From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done)   We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart   Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh  Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
*astronomical twerking*
It's just beautiful to listen his voice
https://youtu.be/HRpNpKm3iug

Ohhhh que hermoso me alegro mi día 😔❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I like this song 😍❤️
Brasil ama vc ❤
i love this song
i just wanna hug u for the rest of my life
Dearest Eman, if by any chance sweetheart, that our stars align and you find me here, know that tonight, I'm thinking about you, despite our worlds apart.
"We're two worlds apart" 🥺
Am i the only one that gets Minthe and Hades vibes from this song? IF you read Lore Olympus then you know what i'm talking about :')
ti amo conny
I have never heard a song being so beautifully written that describes every literally everything I wanted to say for the last two years but I couldn't. I fell in love with someone so different it felt like she was from another star I had such great time with her when I was the most vulnerable person alive. I was coping with a severe depression, anxiety, hallucinatory mind and everything was falling apart I thought I wouldn't make it so I told her let's give us a break as I needed time to get outta shit I was goin through. I took so many medications on a daily basis and now I can feel better I visit her from time to time. it seems like I love her to death. I miss her a lot but it's all in the past we're just worlds apart. She tried to keep us alive for so many times tho I couldn't vibe as we already died
beautiful.
I LOVE THIS ERA.
Conan is so cute :( I really don't know if I wanna be as cute as he is or just have a boyfriend like him :((
Every thing about Conan is just so pretty😭❤️
Arrepieiii, que música lindaa 🇧🇷❤❤
It's time to tanscend to universe, folks.
Me trying to forget about my ex: I got this Also me: *puts as many sad songs as possible*
He got it from his mother.... Songwriting.
Dear, mom and dad , I’m packing up my bags and leaving with Conan...... I wish 🥲
I love you
Obsessed with this already😭

The one girl in class who blames everything on Astronomy:

All I need is a Conan and Taylor colab, that's it. I can then die peacefully.

"You can't force stars to aling when they've already died" ಥ‿ಥ
This song to me sounds like first love that wasnt meant to be. They hold on to each other cause of all the years they spent but as time went on, the both changed and lost feelings of all love with each other. They tried and tried to ignite the spark but in the end they fall apart.
eu amo tanto esse vocal 🥺 tudo pra mim
เจ็บจัง
Astronomy, this song so make me interest and never dissapoint  Great Conan ✨
such a good song
2:58 my favorite part☺👌
is it just me that think it sounds like Heather
Totaly me and my world where i life
🥲
This mv gives me huge timothee's gq photoshoot vibes
Wow this song is beautiful! <333 Definitely will be on my favorite playlist
"You're pining at stars That have already died" 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
I don’t know why this song makes me cry since I can’t even relate to this but it does make me cry... T_T
How come his songs are always beyond perfection 😭❤️❤️
Sarap pang emote
Conan 🖤
Perfect
*Imagine a Collab b/w Conan and Aurora or Ruth B... I can't--*
I m so proud of him
This song reminds me of a book I read, it's called Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe and I'm in love
Holy Starz Batman!
**sad Leo twerking**
*Astronomy Twerking*
this song is not that good to be honest.............. (simply find the song in spotify and add to playlist)
Can we just admit how perfect he is in expressing every word he sings
I saw taylor's insta story and landed here . The best decision i made in a very long time
okay but admit it, you would play this song for the coming months
Is it me or does it give Folklore/Evermore vibes?
*gemini twerking*
Only 5 seconds and i teared up and now am crying. BYE.
I just went through a break up and...conan, I can't relate anymore more. I love youu
He is so beautiful.
😭😭😭😭
Alternative title : POV : conan is your bf and is blessing you with his voice
💖💖💖💖💖
I had the biggest crush (first time I’d been in love) for four years but then I went away for a year and we fell apart  thank you for writing this Conan, I felt understood 🤍
twerking in cancer
If Taylor Swift was a dude
❤❤❤
This video and song are works of art
why you gotta attack me like that Conan :( this song speaks to me on another level of pain. It's a tragedy that my gf and I have traveled the seas and ridden the stars, but now we are two worlds apart because of her parents. Two years of relationship ripped apart and neglected like it was nothing. She and I tried our best but Conan, we lost, we died.
omg my conan🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭 whyyyyyy 🤧
this is so ethereal
I m conansexual

Stars do collide and get connected soon, Just trust💫✨

Pinche canción tan espectacular
Conan t amo
orang ini lagu nya aesthetic mulu perasaan.. sebagus itu😭❤️❤️
How does Conan do that... When he is speaking, he sounds like a normal adult, but the voice in which he sings seems to belong to a 12-year-old whose voice is in the process of getting deep and hoarse. His voice feels like a wandering and wondering child discovering the diverse world.
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Imagine Conan and Olivia make a song together
Luv u ;-)
this feels like a throwback to his older music like treehouse and all that but with more polish. love it.
guys my eyes are leaking ;-;
I love you.
i just need to say- i was here when conan, one of the literal best songwriters of our generation, made this masterpiece.
I love this. I love the folklore and troye sivan vibe. Mama Swift is so proud.😍
0:10 se imaginan despertar y ver eso...mi sueño
Don't know if i should focus on the song or Conan's pretty face. :)
His vocals blow me away every single time! :)

Su voz es hermosa(╥﹏╥)
Everyone keep twerking
I will be crying to this thinking about my 1st gf even tho we broke up over a year ago thanks <3
💓💓
When your zodiac sign doesn't match with your crush and when Conan Gray said 'You can't force the stars to align' I felt that.
This makes me wanna write a story so baaddd
"Its astronomy, we're two worlds apart" damn i felt that.
This makes me miss my non-existent boyfriend
How can such a painful feeling sound so beautiful?
it’s amazing
i love this
Not at all of us going on a date with Conan
Omg i love this song😭😭
I miss conan's old kind of videos, like him painting his nails and talking to us.
*Aries very sad crying*
My partner lives 2000 miles away from me  And we are really perfect for eachother.  But I am 19 and they are 18.  And this song made me S O B   because I am afraid that this might happen to us💔
conan me pede em casamento e eu digo se esperava <3
You listen to a Conan song for 4 minutes and it hurts your whole life.
This song really comforted me through my current breakup and gave me the strength to try and let it go
Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died OUCH 🥲
"the story " y "heather " tuvieron un bebe y lo llamaron  "astronomy  /"the story" and "heather" had a baby and called it "astronomy"💓
That bridge is so fucking good
You never fail 🦋🤍
imagine Conan being in love with you.... wow
is it just only me thinking about palestine while listening to this song ? 🥲
My Taylor Swift boy version ❤️❤️❤️
Awwww ❤️
Why does this hurt my heart?
I LOVE THIS THANK YOU CONAN
Te amo cielo <3
This is like resignation mixed with optimism is there a word for that?
This was really beautiful to watch, really really pretty clip omg
this bridge is one of the greatest things i've ever heard
I think I have never seen a video with a better like-dislike-ratio than this one... And it deserves it
TE AMOOO ME HACES MUY FELIZ CON TAN SOLO EXISTIR!♥️
Y'all dont understand the depth of  "from far away i wish i stayed with you,but here face-to-face a stranger that i once knew"
CAN EVERYONE STOP TWERKING FOR A SECOND IM TRYING TO CRY HERE
wow! another awesome song that rings true to my experience!  congrats and i am  not surprised ;-)   (song and video are spot on) BTW i have heard “fake” playing in public a few times..they blurred over the f-bombs  but i knew it was you even from a distance.
Reminds me of a video game I played called Our Life.
The real king of music
*TWERKING IN A FOREST ALONE IN FORKS, WA*
🤧🤧🤧🤧
**why are yall twerking, twerking**
😌❤️🙏✨🤩
Never heard about Conan but now I think I’m in love.
The bridge 🥺🥺
It's time to go ... Saturn to mars 👀❤️ i can see he is Taylor's child 🥺❤️
THE VIDEO CLIP THE SONG AAAH
ethereal twerking
you did it again here i am crying . i cant help my self but to think that this world would end if you never created music. you have inspired me to try to sing myself but im a really bad singer. thank you for being in this music world that everyone wishes that they could be a part of.
Wow 😳 🥺♥️♥️♥️♥️
if aesthetic was a person, it’d be conan gray
Fantastic!
WHY THIS SONG MAKE ME CRY        🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
idk y but this gives me a very Harry Styles kinda vibe and I'm here for it
Is it just me or does it sound like "Heather"
From my lineage I warn from experiental truth. Stay on the lit narrow path.. It will never serve you wrong. But it will forever. Be a becon of light on lifes stormy seas..
i'll never get tired of conan's songs
Being a teen a million years ago... Id like to say - guide the young with open dialogue youll never lose them. As hard it is in efforts - its worth it! They Dont know.. They are thirsty for the good Godly guidance they are thirsting. You parents may have forgotten.. How wonder comes to you through there eyes. As you once Were in there place🔓💌
*The whole Video* POV: YOU DATING CONAN
"cause socially speaking we were the same with run away fathers and mothers who drank"
YASSSSSSS
When you're a Leo and your lover is Pisces so you know you won't work *sad astrology twerking*
I'm guessing fellow space nerds will be playing this on repeat for the next couple of weeks.
Pourra conan como senpre quebrando o coração da gente né ;-;
oki but i was born in the right generation because all of you just perfectly get me and we all get each other
*sad socially awkward Leo twerking*
Conan Gray represents the entire generation with all his songs  💔  but it is impossible to stop listening to them
He seems like a good person, love him
It's weird that Conan understands us and our parents don't...
Ok but why is this my y/n fantasy. Like damn pov much... this and sabrina carpenter's on purpose videos are pure magic
I love
it's so aesthetically pleasing and gives me the best emotions!
future hit!
😭 Truly a melancholic and ethereal breakup song... Sorry to the ones who relate to the lyrics 🥺 May you find love with stars that actually align
I’ve never liked so fast 😨
CONAN DESERVE EVERYTHING

Astronomy (Poem summary) (Listening to this song with head phones up n lyd If fells like ur right there with him imagining him as the boyfriend I never had each word perfectly pitched,) (The poem) The journey of a young love that doesn't always last like the lucky ones, As astronomy proves we are two different persons in two different Worlds, A person you once knew seems like a completely stranger to you now, It's said distance brings fondness, But us the only mistake we didn't make together was run from each other , Not running from our love, Because it just died, Tho we've done everything were still different, Not meant to be, Making me regret🙂🙂.
a lot of songs nowadays fail to capture emotion and beauty. but this... this is art.
So perfect
so Ethereal ! i am floating.
conan gray did it again another song thats top notch.
Hey king! you have done it again. Constantly raising the bar for us all and doing it flawlessly. I’d say I’m surprised but I know who you are.
Lyrics:  [Verse 1] We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Verse 2] From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done)  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Bridge] Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh  [Chorus] Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
OMG,this song has my soul sinking,lifting my heart and my brain says let’s listen again. Thanks CONAN

eu poderia ouvir essa música o resto da m8nha vida eu juro
YES.😭🤚
Background Falun Dafa (also known as Falun Gong) was introduced to the public in 1992. Nearly 100 million people across China were soon practicing it after experiencing improvements in their health and character. Jiang Zemin, former head of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), perceived the spiritual discipline's growing popularity as a threat to the Party's atheistic ideology and on July 20, 1999, issued an order to ban the practice.  Minghui.org has confirmed the deaths of thousands of practitioners as a result of the persecution over the past 22 years. The actual number is believed to be much higher. More have been imprisoned and tortured for their faith.  There is concrete evidence that the CCP sanctions the harvesting of organs from detained practitioners, who are murdered to supply the organ transplant industry.  Under Jiang's personal direction, the CCP established the 610 Office, an extralegal security organization with the power to override the police and judicial systems and whose sole function is to carry out the persecution of Falun Dafa.

no solo te toca el alma su voz, sino que la letra te destroza. Que ser increíble que es Conan, que con una canción puede tocarte tanto el corazón y conmoverte a más no poder
This song seems the musical version of the book we were liars  "Runaway fathers and drunk mothers"
Love the aesthetics that he used ❤️❤️

This is the greatest “let’s get back together”song
Who else gets kinda old Coldplay vibes with this song?
this song is so sad but at the same time I want to play it at my wedding 😭😭😭
I’m scared that I’ll relate to this song one day
Dear reader I don’t know you and you don’t know me. Probably we are not even living in the same country. We look different. You may be older than me or younger. We are just completely strangers. But there are a few things which connect us. We are humans. We have emotions and feelings. A personality which defines us. And we are both on YouTube, searching for sad songs, no matter what’s going on in your life at the moment, you can do it! You can manage out of it, you will stay stronger because there are people that love you. And these people are worth it!! Yes, we are strangers but not too far away from each other to not say that you are a great person. Because you are! I hope even if it’s just one of you, that I could help or support you in a way.  This comment is for all the lonely people out there! Life is black and white, it's up to you to paint the colors, so don't give up You can´t live tied to the whispers of others, to the assumptions or to the accusations they put on you, you can´t. If you want something, get up, look for it and get it, because, the only thing that falls from the sky is rain, hail and lightning    You are all special ✨✨✨   Heaps of love from Argentina ❤  ❤  ❤
Let's be honest here conan is the definition of aesthetic , and as always sad boi doesn't disappoint us
this is august but from james’ perspective
bruh i usually don't say people are perfect because i know nobody is, but i think we can all agree that conan is pretty dang close

I think subtitles misunderstood an M for an W at 4:05
Dear people all over the world, do not bully people. In physical or other ways, violence is still violence. You may know or not, some people bullied this precious human (just like other precious people over world) and he is the best, when you try to know him. Please be kind. Kinder than you have to be. I wish I could protect him from everything when he was little and still, now too. Please. Be kind.  Thank you. Love you by the way, dear Conan. I adore your music since the very beginning.
I think if taehyung did a cover it will be a hit  *HIt*

Перевод:  Мы едем через лес, богатые районы смотреть Мы шутили , как мы смотрели , что они были слишком хороши для нас Потому что в социальном смысле, мы были такими же с беглыми отцами и матерями , которые пили Рассказ старый как время, молодая любовь не последнюю на всю жизнь И теперь я знаю, теперь я знаю, пора идти, пора идти  Мы путешествовали по морям, мы ездили по звездам Мы видели все от Сатурна и Марса Так же, как кажется, что ты принадлежишь мое сердце Это астрономия, мы два мира  (это астрономия) Мы два мира (это астрономия) Мы два мира друг  от друга Издалека, я бы хотел остаться с тобой Но здесь, лицом к лицу,незнакомец, которого я когда-то знал Я думал , что если бы я хотел, я бы падать обратно в любви Вы сказали, что «расстояние приносит любовь» , но предполагает , что с нами не единственной ошибкой , что мы не сделали было весело (Теперь посмотрят , что мы сделали)  У нас путешествовали по морям, мы катались по звездам Мы видели все с Сатурна и Марса Так же, как кажется, что ты владеешь моим сердцем Это астрономия, мы два мира друг от друга  (это астрономия) Мы два мира друг от друга (Это астрономия) Мы - два мира друг от друга,  Перестань пытаться сохранить нам жизнь. Ты нарисовал звезды в небе, которые уже умерли. Перестань пытаться сохранить нам жизнь. Ты не можешь заставить звезды выровняться. Когда они уже умерли. О, мы умерли. ,ох   О, мы путешествовали по морям, мы ездили по звездам Мы видели все с Сатурна и Марса Так же, как кажется, что ты владеешь моим сердцем Это астрономия, мы два мира друг от друга
Conitooooo I love you so much <3
Conans aesthetic is being aesthetic

Please.......TELL ME WHY YOU SOUND SO GOOD....... ;-;;;;; i'm inlove with your voice<3 ilyyyysssssssm
Conan should get more recognition as a songwriter. He has written every single one of his songs and many of them alone.
Aesthetically twerking
Wow 😢
</3
*His songs are so Aesthetic 💫*
"We're two worlds apart" not me thinking about fictional characters-
This brought peace to my busy heart  .... I teared up toward the end, this story is so touching
laying on the rooftop, looking at stars, wishing the world would become better soon
PLEASE I LOVE THIS
Love your vibe
"a tale old as time, young love don't last for life" why do I always get reminded of him when I thought I had let go....
He brings my dream in to reality✨
Conan te amo <3
I love conan
❤
Can we have a whole gay Disney prince movie with Conan  (Not coming for his sexuality just saying he’s a whole prince)
I love Conan so much his voice is so Angelic😩💞
b.e.a.u.t.i.f.u.l ❤
omg
It’s my ex girlfriends birthday today and this song painfully describes exactly how I’m feeling. “And now I know... now I know.”
Antes del millón #pro
Freaking GOOD thanks for that
Uncontrollable astronomical twerking*
I’ll never forget watching his video of him leaving for LA and his friend telling him “go follow your dream” and now look at him 🥺. this is amazing😭❤️
This song makes me wanna cry about the break up that me and my wonderful boyfriend will probably never have
🛸
Anyone here after Taylor appreciated Conan for this masterpiece?
Lv this song sm❤🔥
well this song reminds me of sparks by coldplay..i mean some parts are very similar tho
❤️
ok hello ive been thinking about this the whole day so i decided to share: I have been listening to a lot of conans songs this month and i think i found a story line??(if there is one) So basically what i think is in ''heather'' conan likes this person, but they like heather and ignore him then in ''crush culture'' he gets mad looking at other couples because they remind him of what he and the other person could have been if he/she didnt like heather, then if u watched the music video, in the last scene he gets a text from his crush(who i think is the guy in heather) which says ''wanna date'' so they start dating but in ''checkmate'' conan finds out that the person is cheating on him(with heather i think) so he gets mad breaks up with him/her and  trashes his/her house  and now in this song that person is trying to get back with him after the whole fight and conan is remembering what they used to do together and he says their bond has died.(btw in my opinion conans ex-crush was a male, but im not sure ofc)
This song is a masterpiece. Ths lyrics are actually too good to exist. LOVED IT CONAN BESTIE 🥺✨
We are now split in two with two worlds one is covid and the other is health :'(
❤️🌹
I just wanna say whoever the cameraman they so lucky
The bridge just ripped me off :""
His hair in every video: ⬇️↖️↘️↗️⬆️⬅️↙️➡️↘️⬇️
THANKS YOU FOR YOU SUBTITULOS,  VERY DEEPS YOUR WORDS ;)

I was watching this music video while thinking of how to end my writer's block and my friend looks over at me and says ''Are you watching male Dora?'' I'm like wtf!?

The mv is giving me "call me by your name" movie vibes and i love it!
*can’t twerk*
a literal pov..we love
Got the same vibe as in 'heather'
Parents really don't know what's going on inside our minds, but Conan does.
conan doesn't have one bad song
ya'll, our tay tay is raising her kids well.
if dpr live is listening to this rn, this is for us my NASA boy :,))
Verse 1] We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Verse 2] From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done)  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Bridge] Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh  [Chorus] Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
😭
Conan makes me rethink my love choices
not twerking. just crying
Imagining that I was the one who's taking a video of Conan..
A living aesthetic
Y/n feels
🍃
Hanna
I feel like its the camera roll of his partner, must be nice.
fuaaa
pov: you're conan's girlfriend
This MV can make me cry.
EU TE AMO TANTO!!!
Conan aesthetic is like warm-core / indie-core / 90's :))
**Sagittarius twerking**
i remember that i started supporting and listening to every song of conan gray because a girl i love really loves conan.
The perfect human doesn't exi-
So pretty 🥺
pluto has left the chat.
💙🙂
Un minuto de silencio por esas personas que no ha oído esta obra de arte.
Sometimes I think if would I ever be loved like how they take their lovers on a late night drive, or to go run under the rain and don't mind all the mud on your feet. I wonder how it feels to be hugged with all the warmth radiating from their heart. I wonder how it feels to be looked at in the eye and you can see how they sparkle at you.  I feel like I won't ever get to be loved like this but I'm still hopeful and for now I'll listen to this song.
CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT HOW CONAN MAKES THE BEST MUSIC VIDEOS AND MUSIC TO MATCH THE AESTHETIC-
I love you Conan 😘
"A stranger that once I know "
Te amooo
MISS EVERYTHING 😭😭💕💕
Why everyone tweaking everywhere!!!!!
The emotions of this song 😭
Why there isn't nobody talking about "you can't force the stars to aling" line? That. Was. So. Heartbreaking.
beautiful
i feel this song so hard in my life right now
I'm crying
this is amazing
Why is this so sad? It’s even sadder than Heather 🥺
Conan is a masterpiece of broken heart.
Conan
young love don't last for life
enk bgttt
🛐🛐🛐🛐
not Conan flirting and me blushing 😳
CONAN I LOVE U
this is giving me... troye sivan the good side guitar vibes and im living
Wooowww, why it's so beautiful, i can't omg 😻😻😻

Love u Conan🥺✨
Astronauts twerking
Conan is adorable
this gives me call me by your name vibes
Conan: yo whatsup, wanna daydream some HQ pov?
Imagine being the camera man...
Você não tem piedade do meu coração????
Pls I want a collab with Bruno Major & Lany.
So good
I fell in love with this song
i know everyone is saying how conan is dating the camera but like guys,, the song tells how they are in different worlds. the video makes perfect sense in the way that we're living in our world and he's in the video, basically in another world. he might have portrayed this form of relationship with the camera(us) like, no matter what we do, he's always in that screen and we're always here, watching him prepare us dates but never really touching him. that's so beautiful. if anyone has other theories about the music video, let's talk<3
Twerking twerking and twerking
it feels like the cameraman is olivia
Sad twerking
🖤❤
this might sounds weird but this whole music video feels like a pov
aesthetically twerking
*vibing Leo twerking*

You managed to bring my atmosphere
I'm here after tay's IG story. Cuz she said it's on another level.

Conan Gray de cachinhos, doutor esse foi o motivo do meu colapso.

AAHHAHHHHHHHHH
AAAAAAAAAAAAJJJJJJJJ
OMG CONAN
LORDE X CONAN GRAY collaboration  is all i want😔❤
thanks to this video, i had a boyfriend for 4 minutes and 10 seconds.
Pov: Conan is your boyfriend
This video has made me love Conan 1989 times more
been here around a thousand views, but then I have been so involved with the song that I forgot to leave a comment here (before it reaches millions of views). love you, Cony!
The first few seconds were enough to send me to my grave I LOVE THIS ITS SO CUTE HELPP
the lyrics made this song way beyond !
Can everyone stop twerking  *annoyed twerking*
its like me and conan are on the ideal FUCKUNG date!😭💟✨
why do i feel like this mv gives me lie lie lie and driver's license combined vibes omg  - like the car and the desert? But the song itself is on another level  wowwwwww it's amazing
The fact that Taylor called this song ethereal  - he's won at life
so cool
why is this just in time as my love story's falling apart :)
*Wolfstar twerking*
):
u have no right of making us cry this late at night because of this masterpiece conan.
OK. I personally didn't like Overdrive but✨ ASTRONOMY ✨ ISSA BOP ✋😭
🥺❤️
this song pierces deep into my heart.
cant wait till people say that they were born in the wrong gen
Taylor swift and Conan the only two people in this music industry who write their own songs and every song touches you in some way. Both deserve better in this industry!
Yahh im falling🐸
This man is a living art
it's time to go TS-
I'm here because of Taylor's IG story. I want Conan and Troye to collab so bad!
wah so pretty
I Watched this music video than Made me thought about my future date idea. It's like deeply stare eyes each other, nothing gadget. just me, him, power of nature, and definitely my God ❤️
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH CONAN
*depressed but in a cool way*

I love youuuuuuu
WOAHHHH NOT A FAN BUT THIS IS INCREDIBLY AMAZINGG! THE MUSIC VIDEO CONAN'S VOICE OMG the highnote on 3:20 really amaze me..
Can we talk about how aesthetic the video is
interstellar twerking
The fact that this song has the same guitar tone as Heather oml love.
OKAY am i allowed to say that this gives me hozier vibes? i'm like,, very serious. i think i could watch this for hours. the videography is kind of grimy, but in a good way, and i think i get that from the lighting and the select clips where it's really fuzzy. particularly the scenes in the hotel room where conan is ripping off the pieces of the wall? i could almost imagine him ripping all of the pieces off and then crawling inside the space that's left to get away from the sky.  anyways this made my mentally ill brain happy in a way that only grimy recordings made with hand-held cameras can so thank you very much for it conan. you've never disappointed with your music ^ ^
sigo apaixonada q ódio
Imagine Conan, Olivia and Taylor in one song
Collab with olivia !!!
So nostalgic to remember all of my past experiences during my youthful days. The bruising, the crying, the Nagging, the Bragging of new happenings, all smiles that can reach out others, friends that are struggling to go outside just to play, running to the huge tree where all promises are made, watching the crops beside to grow and playtime during the rain. Now we all grew up, not knowing that we are forgetting all the past. How good to remember moments before, but I know this'll be back in reality someday, I'll meet them again and play with them again. Aging is for all and maturity is a part of it. I'm happy to see everyone to grow and live a wonderful life.
Guys don’t go to Hell. If you see this comment it is God sending you a warning before it is too late. Jesus is coming soon. Get right with God. If you decide to follow Jesus after he saves Christians from the hard times that are coming. You will have to die for your faith. Accept Jesus before it is too late brothers and sisters.
Not people writing down their astrological signs, girl the song is astronomy not astrology 😭

I am currently writing a novel about two people struggling to find life in another world. It's all about astronomy. The boy is using a formula and the girl is from parallel universe. I think I already found the right song for my novel.
His voice is ✨✨✨
Conan is my bias! I love him!
This made me to experience the whole love and breakup, even though I didn't had either one!🥲
He really has no bad songs
OMG I LOVE ITT

*Pisces twerking and crying*
Huhu i love you, conan!

Who comes here after watching Taylor's story.🙋🙋
Im in love with conan
~the narrator of "Heather" looks back on his lover~  1:52 I wished I'd stayed with you  but with someone new a love that now felt true  I thought if I loved her I'd give up on love (ing you)  you said you regret having given up on an "us"  the only mistake that you couldn't fake was love  (NOW LOOK WHAT'S BECOME)  We've cried all our tears We've grown far apart We've seen everything through a ruined heart  As much as it seems like you own my heart it's Astronomy We're two worlds apart
Anyone think Conan and Keeho would be great friends/have similar personalities?
here because of Olivia!!!

✨ ASTRONOMY STUDENT TWERKING ✨
[Verse 1] We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Verse 2] From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done)  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Bridge] Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh  [Chorus] Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
i literally cannot stop listening to this song
Ilyyyyyyy
Ily.
Now i know you're my boy
"the only mistake that we didnt make was run  ***now look what weve done***" that is my favourite part and  " u cant force stars to allign when theyv. already. DIEED"
before a million
Conan and his lover were a but one of them created iron (iron will kill a star the minute the star forms it) imagine the line "you were the iron to my stare, from the minute we met, you tore me apart 😩😩😩

cosita ninaaa
how do we petition for an orchestra version?
Aesthetic
Gotta flex❤️
In love-
Conan,  i don't know if you ever read this because its been only one the song released and already there is 10k comments. But by chance if you do, i just want to let you know how much i like you, i much i adore you. I listen to your music most of the time. When i don't feel like music, i watch your old vlogs. Your voice really got me, its addictive. Your voice, the 15 yo. Conan and the beautiful smile...i'd have died already, but whenever i feel depressed or all the anxiety chewing by body..i listen to you. I feel relieved. Since the last 6 month straight, you've been my drug.. i listen to ur voice everyday i came back to home, or whenever this world shows its toxicity. I adore you much. Idk if its love, but i want to see you in my life, at least once, and that would be all. Can you please remember that there is a girl out there, talks to you in her imagination and cries for you at night? 💫
LOVE IT
"...Only mistake we didn't make was run🏃..."  🙇💚
🎶We've traveled the seas we're two worls apart IT'S ASTRONOMY 🎶

This song hit different tho!
*crying aesthetic*
as a deep thinker and an astrophile... this song hits me in the most lovely way.  nothing last forever.  every star eventually dies.
POV : when you dating a Conan Gray.  but then i start crying, of course  it sounds impossible. because we're two worlds apart..
Necesito el lyrics en español
this song is literally making me living….
Ahh his voiceeeee😌

I can't stop watching this video Conan is a genius
let’s stop twerking and start ✨crying✨
Enak bangetttt ueueueueueeee

Estou tão encantada🌞😲❤️ . . . •Algum brasileiro? 🏳️
I wish to never listen to this while I'm broken hearted, I just so-so love this man named Michael Angelo. I love this song, but me thinking of me nd my boyfie nd a break up its a no.
que buen tema amigo te amo conan!!!!!
GO CONAN
Yes Conan. You and I are two worlds apart💫
Lovely song!
beautiful as always
😭😭💔😭💔👍🤷😭
i listened to this wearing earphones and in full volume and i tell you it took me to fcking space 🤌✨
The reason I love Conan so much is literally just how cool he is. That kind of cool that comes in the form of having a beautiful soul. Everything about him is just so aesthetic and calming, he's gotten really famous now but he's still the same Conan that used to sit on the floor of his bedroom while drinking tea and talk about how he painted his nails.
“stop trying keep us alive, you can’t force the stars to align” bro i really felt that 🥲
Taylor Swift sent me here.
TE AMO PRECIOSO, BELLO, ARTEEEEEEEEE
Keep striving guys. Don't give up. Why should we, did he ?
#30 BRASIL 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Ahhhhhhhh I love itttttt
Can we PLEASE agree that this doesn't go to tik Tok for at least 3 months.  Welp.. that didn't happen

OMG!!!!! I'M SO PROUD, Conan!
*crying cancer twerking*
the mv really said 'imagine conan gray as your boyfriend."
okay but why is he the most aesthetic person?
ok but is that the mini truck from the story mv????
The aesthetics make me fall asleep
the whole songs is a pure poetry. live youuuu
[0805] I miss you when I haven't even met you
Amazing 🤩

Funado pero jamás derrotado

I'm here bcuz of Taylor's IG story.
Chẳng hiểu sao nghe bài này tôi lại nhớ đến " Call me by your name "

Here cause of Taylor. Can someone explain the twerking comments?
Duudeee conan , you are best
i cannot wait for this to hit like Heather all over again :)
this gives me i know a place vibes 🥺🥺🥺
The twerking is getting annoying y’all.
His songs always hits different. Conan makes masterpieces.
this touched me so deeply
This man. I need him in my life.
Conan reminds me of Taylor swift, they can explain things so smoothly in a song, say little things that mean so much but it only lasts a second and that's why you're always repeating that one song.
no bc this
Not an aquarius feeling something to this song 😪
**emotional twerking**
Esto es arte puro
*me adding to sad song playlist*
King Conan 🌟
Everthing you do is perfect
боже какой прекрасный клип,нет слов описать всю эту атмосферу которую я почувствовала за просмотром,очень классно 😭🥺❣️

Been waiting,longing for Conans next song and this was undoubtedly worth the wait ~I love it 💌

Astronomically twerking 🤭❤️
eyoo that's my boi
I’m so happy I exist in this generation where this beautiful human  exist and saves me through his music  It’s astronomy we’re two worlds apart
It's time to go... Hits different
💖💖
I'm in a long distance relationship with a guy. We've known each other for 5yrs, but we've never met. He sees us going strong forever, but idk why I sometimes think it'll be too difficult. That we're meant to drift apart. I shudder to imagine a life without him, but what are the odds
I guess everyone will listen to Conan someday
i love this song
this song is constantly revolving around my head if you know what i mean 🌠
conannnn 🌸💞
**dutch leo twerking**
What a gem❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭😭
Taylor sent me here.... Beautiful song
This song hits hard
for some reason this makes me wanna stab my heart.. in a good way
I have no words to describe this conan. you’ve absolutely outdone yourself. i love you
at the start i thought the mv would be so relaxing but i felt like i was in a break up after watching it all
"Its astronamy ,we're two worlds apart "
*scientifically twerking*
it's like I'm talking to my closest friend and living the life from that old American movies, the life I've always wanted to live. Thank you, Conan! You've been breaking my heart for all these years but only with a good way

You saved my life🤍
Lyrics speak to my core
Love it
You probably wont see this message since i know that you are so freakin busy. I know you are a superstar and dont get me wrong i am soooo PROUD of you. I admit that i discovered you too late but i am still thankful for that because i have the opportunity to have you as my virtual bestie. Where should i begin? That was my dark times, i cried without any reasons, i felt so fragile and down at that time, idk but when i found you on youtube i watched all of your vids your vlogs your music it seems like i found something that made me feel i wasnt as worthless as i always thought. You motivated me so much in all ways. You perhaps dont know how very important you are and how your words affected my life. I owe you cone really. Thank you sooooo much because your existence is such a serendipity for me. Sorry for my bad english but i really mean it i love you i support you and i always will.
Am I the only one who noticed that this was actually like "Conan Gray as your Boyfriend POV" ? Because I'm cryinggggg 😭😭
I love you!!
**sad leo twerking**
Aesthetic=Conan gray  true equation right?
closing my eyes and listening to astronomy  its the best feel
WE WILL NEVER STOP TWERKING 😤

*We're two worlds apart*
Oh conan!
Crying my eyes out
彼女目線になれました。幸せでした。もう一度見てきます、、
Thank you conan❤️
"Young love don't last for life" probably the deepest advise I've ever heard
The beginning is similar to heather!! Anybody noticed that???
Conan has no right being this amazing
beautiful.
Beautiful
I know him for a short time, but I LOVED THIS SONG ♥ ️✌🏻 It has such a ... cute and loving vibe (I'm Brazilian, so I don't know the Portuguese translation) BEAUTIFUL!!!
I played my mom the music video and she went HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL and I'm like I KNOW RIGHT and my dad is like YEAH HE'S CUTE and I died
my mind is about to flip-flop between "you said distance brings fondness but i guess not with us" and "absence makes the heart grow fonder, fondness makes the absence longer, length loses my interest, i'm a realist, i'm insatiable!"
*twerking in madeup chords*
*gemini with unrequited crushes since birth twerking*
Dudes sus af
Why is this so goood??  I really felt the end 😭😭 His voice in the final part was heartbreaking
This is so GREAT! KEEP MAKING ART!
I'm late to hear this masterpiece
Anyone got reminded of Ashley?

The sad thing about lowkey liking someone is that you can watch them slowly falling inlove w someone else.

For some reason when I listen to this song, I feel the mesmerising feeling of *petrichor* .This song makes me feel nostalgia and a lost sense of longing. It's just chefs kiss and makes me wanna cry n smile at the same time
Sometimes I sit in my room alone, to remember all the beautiful moments that happened with him and that they will NEVER repeat themselves 😥💔 heh, the memories.❤

CONAN GRAY IS A LIVING AESTHETIC. FIGHT ME IF YOU THINK OTHERWISE.

In 15 years there'll be teenagers listening to this and thinking "we were born in the wrong decade".
the lyrics are immaculate
Don't cry, Don't cry, Don't cry, Don't cry, Don't cry, Don't cry, Don't cry, Don't cry, Don't cry, Don't cry, Don't cry, Don't cry, Don't cry, Don't cry, *sniff *sniff *sniff😭

♈️ better be twerking
Astronomy isn't just a song, it's a cultural reset, it's the oxygen you breathe, it's a lifestyle, a reason to live, an escape from this cruel world, it's art, a hug from a loved one, everything you've ever wanted.
No sé si estoy sensible por todo lo que está pasando en mi país, pero esta canción me hizo llorar un mar entero. Todo lo que Conan hace es ARTE♡

1:33 The Astronomy 🌃🌌🌌🌠🌠 Part Got Me Goose Bumps 🤯🥶
*twerks from Saturn to Mars*
I hate how painfully beautiful the lyrics are. My heart crumbles at the thought of slipping away to the person I love to the point we're two worlds apart... Conan I love you but hey??? Ouch.
The definition of real aesthetic is Conan
Conan's flirting with me for 4 minutes:   👁👄👁
I need more songs by Conan 🥰🥰🥰
It's calm and Perfect
I love the vibe!
what in the world is * twerking * ?
I don't know what i have to tell right now 😌
If aesthetic was a person it would be Conan Gray
He gives off the most pure raw ambiance
You're the most adorable person and your voice is just so soothing 🥺❤💯
STOP TWERKING PLEASE
His hair 😭🤚
This song is so beautiful 🤩
Heather twerking
breakdown while twerking
Lots of comments about twerking but not a lot about how crushingly sad it is. According to Conan himself, the song is about the slow drifting away from someone you love until you two are too far apart.
When he said "we're two worlds apart", all I could think about was her. How I messed up our friendship. How as much as I still love her, we're two completely different people 😞... But either way, this is a great song.
I love this song💙
* 𝗹𝗶𝗯𝗿𝗮 𝘁𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 *
this feels like a melancholy dream
What do you mean twerking??
omg
Why comments are twerking ?? Can someone explain
* Mexican twerking  *
this song is literally if 'the other side' and 'little league' had a baby. I LOVE IT <3
THIS MV MADE ME FEEL LIKE WE ARE IN A RELATIONSHIP W/ CONAN BUT IT HURTS. HUHU
SO BEAUTIFUL INDEED.

*libra twerking*
[Verse 1] We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Verse 2] From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done)  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Bridge] Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh  [Chorus] Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
I can't think of any word to describe how good this song is.
I loved the song so much. Keep going mr.grey.🥺❤️🦋

Astronomy is Heather’s cousin and I’m in love with them both
*Proudly twerking*
Why are people twerking? **Curiously twerking**
Astronomically twerking while singing 💏
*twerk aggressively in an astronaut costume*
the fact that the song is made on personal  p.o.v like it feel like you are the person he's referring to...it's just beautiful❤
I just love all the gay artists i know, Conan, lauv, troye, my holy trinity 😭
i love astronomy 🌌
WHO GAVE HIM THE RIGHT TO BREAK MY HEART LIKE THISSSS
"Astronomy"  We drive through the woods Rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked That they were too good for us  Cause socially speaking we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time Young love don't last for life  And now I know Now I know It's time to go It's time to go  We've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  From far away I wish I'd stayed with you But here face to face A stranger that I once knew  I thought if I wandered I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness But guess not with us  The only mistake That we didn't make Was run Now look what we've done  We've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh we've died Ooh  Oh, we've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart

“we’re two worlds apart”  hits different when you just broke up with your lover
I think that this kid is very intelligent and getting bigger. As a people who knows a little astronomy, lyrics hit me differently.
Growing up gay in a homophobic household, this hits different
mwah Conan!!! loved it!!😊
The outfits. Ugh. So beautiful.🥺
We're two worlds apart. Damn!🥺🥺❤️❤️
That moment when he sings: We're two wolds apart... I felt that 🥲

Does anyone know the meaning behind this song?   I think its about an online relationship or someone is in a relationship and they can’t see their S/o so everything starts to go down hill. In the end they break up but idk if someone could explain that would be great!
Conan bonito🤎

KEEP HIM SAFE AT ALL COST
wowwww amazing
Lyrics=D    We drive through the woods Rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked That they were too good for us  Cause socially speaking We were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time Young love don’t last for life     And now I know  Now I know It’s time to go  It’s time to go We’ve traveled the seas We’ve ridden the stars We’ve seen everything from Saturn to Mars  As much as it seems Like you own my heart It’s astronomy We’re two worlds apart (It’s astronomy) We’re two worlds apart (It’s astronomy) We’re two worlds apart        From far away I wish I’d stayed with you  But here face to face A stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered I’d fall back in love You said distance brings fondness  But guess not with us   The only mistake  That we didn’t make  Was run Now look what we’ve done        We’ve traveled the seas We’ve ridden the stars We’ve seen everything from Saturn to Mars  As much as it seems Like you own my heart It’s astronomy We’re two worlds apart (It’s astronomy) We’re two worlds apart        Stop tryna keep us alive You’re pointing at stars in the sky  That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can’t force the stars to align  When they’ve already died Oh we’ve died Ooh        Oh, we’ve traveled the seas We’ve ridden the stars We’ve seen everything from Saturn to Mars  As much as it seems Like you own my heart It’s astronomy We’re two worlds apart...
it gives me so much 'aristotle and dante discover the secrets of the universe' vibes

Woah......that was so powerful💗💗💔
ILOVED ALL OF IT CONAN YOU KILLED OMGGG
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
2:59 this part of the song hits different
The love i have for this man is astronomical
I will take this as a birthday present, because today it's my birthday, the second worst birthday in my life lol, so thanks Conan, you are saving my day😔✊
This music video reminds me a lot of Lovesick Boys by Conan. Mostly the parts where he is running by the trees and playing in nature. It shows that even though Conan has changed his style a lot through the years, he still has a little bit of Old Conan still there. Or I’m reading way too much into it.  Edit: I just remembered that there is a line in Lovesick Boys that says “I guess then the stars had aligned.” And there is a line in this song that’s says “you can’t force the stars to align.” Coincidence?
currently heading to Spotify to play this 5 times in a row to learn the lyrics
الحين الاغنية ما نزلت الا ب رمضان😭!!
Why this made me think of snowbaz in wayward son??
this is beautiful.
this😢😢
Perfeito
Conan is literally the definition of beauty like he is beautiful, his voice is beautiful, his songs are beautiful everything about him is beautiful
This song plus the video clip is just astronomical🤌
*sad twerking*

ok, this is so perfect from top to toe, i'm officially sad
Conan Gray x Olivia Rodrigo The music and the vibes are just perfect for each other
the difference between the tone of the song versus the comments just all being about twerking 😭
This song hid deep in my heart, filling my soul with stars.
Proud twerking 🥺💜
Conan es perfección, para mis oídos 🛐🤍

Tolong aku ga kuat sama damagenya conan 😭😭
hi conan. i just wanted to say thank you. thank you for everything youve done for me and helped me through. your music has saved my life so many times i honestly dont even think i would be alive without you. i have been through a lot this past year and i lost everybody i had and you were the only one that was there to help me get through it. you feel like my best friend even though I’ve never met you. im so grateful. i love you so much thank you for always being there for me when nobody else was. i know you wont see this but i just wanted to write this <3
got the chills 30 seconds in omg conan you never cease to amaze me !!!
i say folklore’s and evermore’s third sister
POV: Y/n is with Conan..
loveeeee
I feel like I'm with him, I love it
DIOS TODO LO QUE HACE CONAN ES ARTE 🛐🛐🛐❤️🛐✨❣️
you may never see this but i hope it's not the end of our story. i hope our stars are not dead. i hope one day we would find our ways to each other again
If you see this conan you have helped me though every thing -bella;) I am 10
Te amo
*Scorpion twerking *
Conan maravilhoso como sempre 💙🌌
I love himmmmmmmmmmmmm
I'm crying a lot. I think I am in love with you. You have the best energy i-
i imagine i’m going to listen to this song way too much..  ILY conan
“you’re pointing at stars in the sky that already died” is such a genius line. since light from distant stars can take years to travel to our eyes, the night sky that we see today is actually like a glimpse into the past, how the universe looked at some point in time years ago. so you could be looking at a star that has in reality already exploded, but the light from that explosion won’t reach earth for another couple hundred of years, and to us everything seems fine. if you think about it, there’s a lot of room for metaphors about our perception of things vs reality. anyways just brilliant
"You painted stars in the sky that have already died, stop trying to keep them alive, when they have already died" "It's astronomy, we are two separate worlds" okay, it doesn't hurt ...
Oh to be the cameraman...
How is Conan so talented
“cause they’ve never even touched the sky. no, they’ll never even touch the sky”  “we’ve traveled the seas, we’ve ridden the stars, we’ve seen everything from saturn to mars”  (i blinked 🥺✨🪐💫⭐️🌙)
shit, this is beautiful
Your songs give me so much comfort and i'll never be able to properly thank you for it
tag yourself im the crooked lampshade
SHEEESHHHHH
Esta canción me da paz
this man is rlly making me cry or be extremely hyped and happy with every song he releases
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO CRIED AT THOSE BEAUTIFUL MESSAGE 😆😭😭😭
Aaaaaaaaa q canción tan hermosa lptm ❤️‍🔥
Omg conan se me mata do coração  I love you,i love yours songs♥️♥️♥️
This video only made me fall in love with conan more and more again <3

(from genius)  [Verse 1] We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Verse 2] From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done) [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Bridge] Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh  [Chorus] Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
This is so beautiful I’m crying *twerks*

**angrily twerking**
Love Conan love this song but I want to see some choreography from male artists. I think both he and Shawn Mendes need to give us more choreography in their videos. Casually walking won't cut it anymore. Great song tho.
Conan had no right to snatch my heart just like that- send help
I mean i love Heather  but this  sounds  repetitive,  i have  mixed feelings about this songs.
I've missed you Conan....

alien twerking*
I’m left breathless wow-
หยุด
This gives me comfort.
OMG
I love this song so muchhhhhh
I always take note of the colors in Conan's videos since "Grow". This is warm yellows, soft blues, earth tones, and pops of green. Clean, bright colors. The bridge and ending (which give me chills) are more washed out and grey (pay attention to the lighting change in the room and how the last outside shots are at night.)
So good I love it🥺
*Happy yet depressed twerking*
*astronomically twerking*
conan... this is incredibly amazing
god can we just talk about Conans beauty! hes so pretty! 😭✨

This song is very much appreciated 💛✨
q bonita cancion 7.7
*depressed twerking* and *planets twerking*
*    conan twerking    *
What Conan does are not songs, they are feelings that can be heard through his voice. And I know that sometimes I seem an exaggeration talking about how he has saved me from so many things, but he has really done it, and I can't do more than thank him for everything or what he has done for me. Because if I hadn't met him that day, I'm sure I wouldn't be writing this, or anything else. And I know he won't see this, but thank you, Conan, I owe you more than life, I owe you my happiness.       And, btw, sorry if I said something wrong, I actually speak Spanish and I used the translator to write this.
00:00 - 01:49 This is what I call perfect date❤
Thank you Conan for such beautiful music! Astronomy literally broke my heart 💔
i think i found my song :')

Todas las canciones de Conan son superiores * ✧ * • °/ * . ✧ * • • + ♡ ⑅ ✧ * 。~♪
mds-
Conan, you're one of my favourite artists! Go up !!
This song reminds me of Call me by your name. So bittersweet.
que depressao
So addictive 💞
it seems as though the actual song dosent even sound like it would make sense with the setting, the song feels weird in this setting. that's why it's amazing, it's almost as though it's supposed to be like this
As always another wonderful song 😌
Eu te amo conan, eu te amo <3
Yeni fav şarkımı buldum
✨
His voice  😫 🖤
i just literally finished watching things Conan gray cant live without 🤧
I can't stop watching the music video, lyrics and melody and filming the video. Your hair and tone of voice, Conan impressed me
I LOVE THIS SM
Uwu 🇵🇪🇵🇪🇨🇴
It's that kinda song to which you wanna fall in love, and then fall out
I love you Conan
this reminds me of klaus and caroline from tvd
pov: you’re on a date with conan
love how this was filmed kind of in first person! so cool
SUCH A LEGEND
I fucking love u😭❤️

This video makes me feel bad because I'll never meet you :')
A vibe da música, vídeo clipe, fotografia... TUDO  É PERFEITAAAAA✨💫🦋
No one: Not even One Direction in Night Changes: Conan: cuddling with his cameraman and looking at them with the most loving eyes in the whole world

***HEARTBREAK TWERKING***
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE, I DON'T ADMIT OTHER OPINIONS ✨✨✨✨✨
too beautiful to be song
im crying not twerking
please someone talk about how this music video is like Conan giving all of us the gift of spending a day with him- no, an eternity with him. we get a glimpse of his entire life, we see him at peace and in joy and insecure and in shame and in pure, unbridled rage. in so much more than words he's showing us the pure essence of him, taking us with him through his journey. we may be two worlds apart but we are stars colliding.
This made me feel like i was dating Conan Gray for 4 minutes
Omg, VERY BEAUTIFUL, COOL .... I LOVE
Um guys? Why does this look like The Story mv but dark ????? 👁👄👁 I’m anxious now
the mood is like heather but put some lana del rey and taylor on it
No sabes cuánto te amo ✨☺️
*Beautiful twerking*
I love conan 😭💗💗
Someone: You can't fall in love with a song... The song:
This is so beautiful I'm sobbing
😔😔💓💓
what a beautiful and emotional song! It's really really touching I'm about to cry
i love you Conan :’’)
I love how the guitar sounds like "heather", but the lyrics remind me of "the story". this song is incredible, especially the bridge.
You're pretty
The bridge is so raw. Feels honest and sharp and very real. You're one of a kind
"It's time to go"
Aristotle and Dante?

Oh its the pretty sad love song about space!
I am literally watching laying in my bed.. And didn't expect that bed part 👁️👄👁️ ya'll i am blushing
pov: you look at him for the last time as he soundly sleeps beside you..its just you both and the sheets...you know tomorrow he wont find you beside him, his bed will be cold... you smile was you trace his cheeks... its a smile full of pain and happiness... you both always fantacised about spending life together, knowing very well that you both have commitment issues, that at that beginning of this you both just used each other to fill the voids that someone else left in you both... the past flashes in front of your eyes... how you both were barely friends in high school ... thought you would never see him ever again... but then one day you found him in the hallway of your college... you tapped his shoulder scared if he would even recognize you...but he did and he smiled and both of you talked... shared your hearbreaks....how badly your ex boyfriend treated you and how without any reason his girlfriend left him...he comes over to your room to watch a movie..but things led somewhere else... you both thought it would bee just sex until you both find "the one"...but slowly while filling each other's void somewhere you both joined like lost puzzle pieces.... he wanted to travel the world.. you wanted to climb the corporate ladder...you didnt mind him going around the world...your feelings got deeper and stronger...he was becoming serious for you..and you were scared that what if your dreams stopped him from travelling the world...because he was falling so badly he might give up on the only dream he had dreamt since high school...the dream he worked so hard on....so you wipe your tears, kiss his forehead for one last time, slowly gets out of the sheets, writes a note and leaves it with your moon and star pendant .... both of you never said i love yous..scared that the other might not have the same feeling but deep down you both knew that you love each other so much... you never told him how the world just blurs out for you and you cannot see anything or anyone except him when he is around.. that you like the way he always asks you before holding your hand or kissing you because you ex boyfriend never asked for your consent, about how safe he made you feel actually you felt the safest in his arms the note said -  We've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart. your lips quiver as you look at his calm sleeping face for one last time wishing will all of your heart that in some universe you both live together forever and there would be no good byes notes no tears, no sorrys. no regrets of not confessing love. no cold beds. just happiness
AAAAAH AMOOOO ESTOOOOOOOOOOOO

Theory Y'all  0:36 "With runaway fathers and mothers who drank" and "both our parents were evil"  from 'The story'  maybe Astronomy is about 'the friend' Conan mentions in 'The story'
I’m not crying  Who’s cutting onions :”) ?

"We're two worlds apart.."
Hi bakla
Es bellísimo, bebé...
This is why I love Conan he is so genuine with his writing and not just another pop/indie artist. His lyrics are always so powerful and paint such beautiful pictures from really painful moments in his life. I love you Conan and thank u for writing songs that help me express what my words can’t. I’m so proud of how far you have come and can’t wait to see what you have coming ❤️
[Verse 1] We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Verse 2] From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done)  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Bridge] Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh  [Chorus] Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
*+Crying and tweaking*+
The songwriting keeps improving so much. I feel so proud. 🥲🥲🥲🥲
💜💟
*twerking with the heart broke*
Cottage core vibes? 💗
This is beautiful and brings back happy and sad memories of a past, thank you Conan x

just twerking*
My pillow covered with my tears now
Amazing ❤️
I think Conan should change his last name to Great, cause he's Conan Great

psychopath twerking
**breaking up cuz there's no other way twerking**
Solo me queda decir: QUE HERMOSO
Te amo
in love
<3 ti amo
Claro que me encantó, supongo que es nuestra canción, me crea un problema existencial pensar en esto, "el amor de la juventud no dura para toda la vida", claro que me da un toque, cuando pensamos que todo es perfecto, puedes llegar a pensar esto, "sólo es astronomia" "somos 2 mundos separados"  Ya no se que pensar, creemos que estamos bien, pero es mas difícil, solo dejemos esto así. las estrellas se alinean solas, dejemos que esto se alinee solo, no forsemos nada.  07/05/21
love it so much this is so fragile
Hey Conan I just wanted to say thank you you’re music calms me down and makes me smile a lot and I can relate to it and it makes me happy thank you for making music don’t give up and to people reading this you’re never alone someone is out there waiting for you <3

Every conan’s song makes me feel like I’m never alone, even he was there when i got no one to go through with in my darkest times in high school years ago, with his art tea & vlogs too. And this song feels like i’m having such a good conversation abt life with him idk how 🤍😭 I just wanna say thank you conan for existing, creating & inspiring!!! We love you!!

Who gives permission for this man to be THIS beautiful?
I guess its time to say goodbye to him. So to my young love, i let you go today. Thank you for the memories, for the butterflies and for all the times you made me feel like i was the only one that mattered in this world. I'll remember you in my fondest memories. But today i let go of the hope that we'll be together again, because i realised the stars really aren't alive anymore. Goodbye love.
sad twerking
perfeito sempre

*emotionally twerking*
*happy twerking*
bufo
"stop tryna keep us alive. you can't force the stars to align when they've already died!" as someone who broke up a relationship because although we cared so much about each other, we weren't able to keep our love alive (even though we seemed like a happy couple for others, we were literally two worlds apart with our feelings) I FELT THAT!
We are here for you, conan. We love you! Always remember that
*alien-like twerking*
You are just incredible!!!
This song is comforting

*astronomically twerking*
here’s the lyrics folks cry through the pain✨ We drive through the woods Rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked That they were too good for us  Cause socially speaking we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time Young love don't last for life  And now I know Now I know It's time to go It's time to go  We've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  From far away I wish I'd stayed with you But here face to face A stranger that I once knew  I thought if I wandered I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness But guess not with us  The only mistake That we didn't make Was run Now look what we've done  We've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh we've died Ooh  Oh, we've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart
Its perfect

them: twerking differently  me: twerking while writing!   "young love, looked up and traced the stars We love, fought and rewriting stars.  young love,  played roles, pictured out future we love, performing roles, nurturing future.  tale as old as time a young love we share  tale as old as time but we aren't our happilly ever after."
LAS CANCIONES DE CONAN HERMOSO YA SON OTRO NIVEL☝🛐💖 AUNQUE NO LE ENTIENDA A SUS CANCIONES ESTAN HERMOSAS, COMO EL 7u7🙂✨ Tiene mas likes que vistas? O solo soy yo😅?

me: "I was impatient and looked at Conan's dms on allday.blue that made me cry" now: "I should not have done that" I hope the situation changes

If I don’t find a lover like this I don’t know if I want one..
Better than your power
They were too good.. for us..👍👏✨💔
*cosmic twerking*
MEU DEUS MEU DEUS Q LINDO
I feel astronomically attacked
Finally I can date Conan without really having to date him
here’s the lyrics ✨     [Verse 1] We drive through the woods,  rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas,  we've ridden the stars We've seen everything  from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems  like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Verse 2] From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done)  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas,  we've ridden the stars We've seen everything  from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems  like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Bridge] Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh  [Chorus] Oh, we've traveled the seas,  we've ridden the stars We've seen everything  from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems  like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart

Dear Conan Gray,    You might not read this but I just want it to be out there. You've helped me through so much, life hasn't been to great on me with eating and just living. But your voice just sooths me and makes me so happy. Thank you Conan. Stay healthy bestie <33 To anyone reading this never give up, you're not alone.
imagine conan making a picnic for you in the middle of a forest
T amo
*astronomical twerking*

* *astronomically twerking* *
conan is all that is right in this world
Amazing like always
astronomical twerking
I’d like to travel to your planet!
I like that the video displays both the partner’s and Conan’s perceptions of the relationship. The song itself seems to be Conan pushing someone away, insisting the relationship is over. Here, we see such a different take that presents the pain that comes, even if you’re the one saying goodbye.
Diossss lo amo🛐😭💗
just crying
Doing homework while twerking
It's astronomy
💫
Let's travel the seas
EVERYBODY IS TALKON BOUT THE TWERKING BYE

Que video espectacular <333
[Verse 1] We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know, it's time to go, it's time to go  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn and Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Verse 2] From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said, "Distance brings fondness," but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done)  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn and Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Bridge] Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky that already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh, ooh  [Chorus] Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn and Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
Wow~ Just wow~

"Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh we've died" 💔
Qué flojera comentar en inglés, ya mejor procedo a decir que estoy en clase de biología y ya mejor me puse a escuchar esta canción, que no tengo ni la menor idea de lo que dice pero se escucha triste. Por cierto; Conan está bien hermoso y tiene una voz de ángel 💗✨

Did Taylor Swift started giving Conan poetry lesson and her personal dictionary cause it really seems like that.

**EMOTIONALLY SCREAMS THE BRIDGE WHILE TWERKING**
i can already see all the sad edits to this song
whenever i listen to conan's song, it always feels like i'm listening to him for the first time over and over again
3:36 😳
me: "I was impatient and looked at Conan's dms on ununun.art that made me cry" later: "I should not have done that" I hope the situation changes
when conan says 'two worlds apart', its the equivalent of falling asleep .
*learning how to twerk*  To keep up with y'all out there🤧🤧
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Yey
Love youu
I love the progression of this. In the beginning, it feels comforting yet distant and it turns into something more frantic, lonelier. I adore it.
*Two worlds apart twerking*

If Conan ever disappears it’s because Aliens found out who he is and how much of a perfect person he is so they abducted him so the could have him to theirselves
The song makes me feel in love.

Conan if you don't collab with Tate I have no words....🥺 I need it in my life 💖
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU KING <33,,,
**twerking in two worlds apart**
I feel like this video was made for conan's fandom. He says how much we are the same as him (because we like his music) and that we have done a lot of things together (by supporting him). But we are two worlds apart from him, because we will never really know the real person that he is irl, and he will never know us individually as people either. Just wanted to share my flawed idea :)))
AHhHhH
cute
:c
Nem ouvi direito já gostei
i love your voiceee
"We've travelled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to mars" I'm crying😭
This reminds me of the sunset season album 😩
It's time to go... ~♡
And conan keeps his record of only making good songs since the day he was born 💛
I am in love with you Conan gray....

Coisa linda 😍❣️🇧🇷🇧🇷
This video was absolutely life changing. I enjoyed the pretty scenes with nature and everything. I also like the scene with the breakdown at the end.  Is this song about online dating? If so, I think I can agree. Dating online won’t be the same as dating in person. Anyway, amazing video. Have a great day. I love you.
ARTE!❤😢

Okay I'm happy Conan moves on from the past that brought him dark memories and changes the themes of his songs, but I am so, so grateful for that line about "runaway fathers and mothers who drank". Honestly, thank you for mentioning it, I've always related so much to it when you talked about growing up in an abusive household of a small town. Letting go, but the experience remains, it's so important for me to see.
THE SCENE IN THE CAR OMG this is a whole pov I SWEAR
*twerks the song melody*

Can someone explain me how he put this much peace in his music videos???
My new favorite song
Conan,if youre reading this, this song really speaks out. It's perfect. It really is my fav mv! The song is wonderful also, the lyrics express emotions. I remember I watched your first video(of you making banana bread) and how you talked about wanting to become more famous and that you wrote,  like 30 songs in 3 days! You came so far, from Idle town to heather now to Astronomy ❤️ Sooner than you know, you'll take over the World😆 and I mean it! You've really changed my perspective on life, and when I'm sad I watch one of your videos to make me feel better. I suffer from anxiety and depression, and you really helped me get through it. You really changed my life❤️ thank you!
He's so cute 🥺🥺🥺
his voice is so angelic
it is not happening to them that 💫astronomy💫

⚠️ LYRICS ⚠  We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go  We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done)  We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart   Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh  Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart

Lyrics:  We drive through the woods, rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked that they were too good for us 'Cause socially speaking, we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time, young love don't last for life And now I know, now I know It's time to go, it's time to go  [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Verse 2] From far away, I wish I'd stayed with you But here, face to face, a stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered, I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness, but guess not with us The only mistake that we didn't make was run (Now look what we've done) [Chorus] We've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart  [Post-Chorus] (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  [Bridge] Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh, we've died, ooh  [Chorus] Oh, we've traveled the seas, we've ridden the stars We've seen everything from Saturn to Mars As much as it seems like you own my heart It's astronomy, we're two worlds apart
ITS ASTRONOMYYYYYY

❤️Lyrics❤️  We drive through the woods Rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked That they were too good for us Cause socially speaking We were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time Young love don’t last for life And now I know  Now I know It’s time to go  It’s time to go We’ve traveled the seas We’ve ridden the stars We’ve seen everything from Saturn to Mars  As much as it seems Like you own my heart It’s astronomy We’re two worlds apart (It’s astronomy) We’re two worlds apart (It’s astronomy) We’re two worlds apart From far away I wish I’d stayed with you  But here face to face A stranger that I once knew I thought if I wandered I’d fall back in love You said distance brings fondness  But guess not with us The only mistake  That we didn’t make  Was run Now look what we’ve done We’ve traveled the seas We’ve ridden the stars We’ve seen everything from Saturn to Mars  As much as it seems Like you own my heart It’s astronomy We’re two worlds apart (It’s astronomy) We’re two worlds apart Stop tryna keep us alive You’re pointing at stars in the sky  That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can’t force the stars to align  When they’ve already died Oh we’ve died Ooh Oh, we’ve traveled the seas We’ve ridden the stars We’ve seen everything from Saturn to Mars  As much as it seems Like you own my heart It’s astronomy We’re two worlds apart   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nux2dr_J118

OMG MY NEW FAV. SONG AWEEE I LOVE YOU CONAN
Astronomy twerking
OMG
**space twerking**
When it is conan gray I know I'm gonna get hooked up .
Just listened to the song and let’s just say, I’m not disappointed. This song is so good and Conan never fails to amaze with his lyrical techniques and story telling through his songs. His songs are always well thought out and absolute masterpieces. His music is something that someone, somewhere, can relate to and I think that is what makes him so unique as a artist because not a lot of artists can do that and do it well. 🤍
this song is magical ✨💖
STFU ABT THE TWERKING OMG
✨everybody is twerking✨
**universe twerking**
Жду🥰

LYRICS : ⭐️  We drive through the woods Rich neighborhoods to watch We joked as we looked That they were too good for us  Cause socially speaking we were the same With runaway fathers and mothers who drank A tale old as time Young love don't last for life  And now I know Now I know It's time to go It's time to go  We've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  From far away I wish I'd stayed with you But here face to face A stranger that I once knew  I thought if I wandered I'd fall back in love You said distance brings fondness But guess not with us  The only mistake That we didn't make Was run Now look what we've done  We've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart (It's astronomy) We're two worlds apart  Stop tryna keep us alive You're pointing at stars in the sky That already died Stop tryna keep us alive You can't force the stars to align When they've already died Oh we've died Ooh  Oh, we've traveled the seas We've ridden the stars We've seen everything From Saturn to Mars As much as it seems Like you own my heart It's astronomy We're two worlds apart
