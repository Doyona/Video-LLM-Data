This one was recorded the same weekend as Rich Men North of Richmond. Before everything blew up. Crazy to think how much has changed in just a few weeks. I cant thank y'all enough.
Do you have an Album, yet?
Your welcome! Poor ppl are rich! We have something that rich people don't have. Pride!!!
You should have used a 90 Chevy in the video ….
starting to think oliver anthony means something not well
your the one doing it to me
your music echo's in my brain man ... actually keeps me up sometimes XD ... your voice and lyrics are amazing ... I hope you hit it bigger than already are :)
I don't know you brother, but thank you for your music and I hope this message reaches you because you have cast healing over me and giving me music that I can grieve too pursue and learn from. Thank you so much for your talent and God bless you brother
somebody’s gonna have to do it its been 26 years
Me .I'm  who .in 2025.😊
New Mex
Man I love this song !
I hope i can find a woman like this.
I've been trying for 16 years to get on with the coal mines. I love this type of music. But when I hear it it makes me wish I could get a job in the mines. But it is one of the hardest jobs I have ever seen in my life to acquire. They are very very very very very very very very very very picky. As I said I have applied at numerous Minds over 16 years and can't get a shot
1990 f150 4 wheel drive with the 5.7 all blacked out with the dual tanks..
U are the man ❤
This song is the  "FUCK YOU" song ....can't stand a shitty chevy..never rides me right, cant make the hug and kiss at the door..can't roll for shit. Anywa..iykyk
“ case of beer and a Zebco”…… brilliant!!!
Wow good lord, your love is lucky. I hope me and my future love can listen to froggys in the creek someday ❤❤
Amen, Jesus Is Lord.
These damn lyrics call my girls name
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Would you object to a woman convering this? I just really dig the song.
❤
CHEVY NATION ❤ GLORY TO GOD

Please sing about Charlie.  I know you can do this.  Love your solo's.
Rip Charlie Kirk 😢
At 1:20 that is most def a Regent R100 1911 and I respect it. 400 dollar 45 is always a deal 👌
Brother your talent is truly incredible stay real homie 🙏🌹💯
Only problem is my friends turned her on more than I did... Actually anyone could and did, she had more passengers than a New York City cab
Just good music
Its going great, just remove the gun from the picture.  Going in the deep with a gun looks pretty bad. I know its for the critters,  but it doesn't look good
People love actual originality
Zemco.   Fish reel
Me and my husband had a 66 Chevy. 😊.
90 something chevy while hes driving a new chevy in the video. 😂 we all think it sounds good we just never actually do it.
2025
If you’re having trouble gettin laid just buy an OBS 💀🤣
he is about to hit europe for the 2nd time. treated like royalty
Your music always goes straight to the soul my granddad use to sing playing banjo and harmonica I miss him so much.  Thank you for such soulful music that speaks truths we just played I wanna go home at my mom's funeral August 2024 she was a coal miners daughter from West Virginia.
Im a ford man ,But I really love your songs. Keep up the good work.  Backwoods is the only way to go. God Bless you Brother.  This is from North Louisiana.
Yes sir
oh that's a good one
Lmao as hees driving a brand new Chevy lmao
God bless you
But when I listen to your music. It just carries me away to a better place
It seems like when you're down the government puts their foot on your neck to stomp you further down into the ground. And they don't care about you or your family. Pretty sad that our country is that a way. You live paycheck by paycheck you don't have any extra to give
What's it been almost 2 years since this song came out. Anthony you sing some awesome tunes. And this is one of my favorite out of all of them. It reminds me all the gravel roads I've been down and my 92 Chevy. Pulling my boat going out running trot lines. Lot of people don't know what a trotline is. Or a limb line. I spent most of my time out in the country. The concert makes you humble. City Life turns people into horrible people. But they have to have a little country to understand how to be humble. Congrats this tune hits my heart. Thumbs up to you Anthony. Been a concrete finisher a welder and now I'm a truck driver. Thank you for this tune thank you for these words
That’s one lucky dog.  When he scratches behind its ear, it’s like he’s changing the tone.  If he called this song 2013 ELANTRA, it just wouldn’t be the same as a Chevy from 1990
You the Chevy from back then
The truck aged better than the relationship
I broke my lamiglass when i rolled my 92 S10. Rip lil brown
hearing him sing about his good woman and having to put a ring on it just makes me mad knowing what she did! Women don't love men any more they just love what men provide and do for them! Make America Godly again!!! please god!
Bbb😢😢😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉🎉
To think he’s talking about the “scornful woman” in this song is pretty wild😂
Zebco reel
Plain sum of good feels as usual❤
💚💨🔥
Lordy Almighty.  Came back to listen to this after "Scornful Woman"
This is hard after listening to "Scornful Woman"..... Making this lady cry.
Oliver Anthony is my Elvis.. there.. I said it. Doesn't matter which song.. play it and I'm friggin melted. ❤
This song is golden. Literally cruisin in my 94 Chevy ext cab while jammin to 90 some Chevy. She is everything this man had to sing. 🇺🇸 Stay Blessed
I got a 90s Chevy had it for 6 years currently has 340k miles can’t beat em
❤❤❤
Damn truths all up in this song boys and girls
This man is the best thing to happen to country music in a few years!!!!  Let the sun sink good and low!!!!
I think it's wrong that you can't like this song more than once I like it every time I play it😊
Not anymore she ain’t, that damned scornful woman
You nasty little piece of work H.D... Fairwell and Goodriddance, you crazy muppet. Won't miss you after 8 years or next level left minded manipulation and zero effort. Shame on you... Thanks for Taytay's bubbickins, though. She's nothing like you, fortunately for her. ❤
Thank you for not signing with a studio.  They would have legally forced you to do things and write things you would have never wanted to. You would have ended up no better than the rich men north richmond
He is a gift we all need, truth is all there is left, slow this crazy world down.
Men work hard for their money.  Both politicians and women conspire together to rob them blind.
that 90 some chevy tried to take all your money bro 😮‍💨.. Youll find you an updated model soon
Case of beer and a what some kind of cone? Idk i dont smoke legal weed until federal legality.
WOW!! My BROTHER I FEEL THIS SONG SO MUCH I SAY IT EVERYDAY.
That Chevy is now running like a Ford I bet you he regrets this song
Take my 1970 k20 swb old old school
One of my fave songs of his
Thank you for this one
I was just a normal guy hearing this song. I thought it was pretty good. I have my own son, he's 2 years old now, 😮named Waylon. I barely see him during the week because i get up and go cut timber to support my family. I miss him to no end, and i have to choose between my family or a meager paycheck that hardly supports our family.  No hope to own a home, cant even afford a decent vehicle without payments and interest. My small little town is now host to a 200+ unit condo that takes up the same amount of space as our high school campus.  Now, i realize this song is a masterpiece.
Coming back to this after scornful woman,  oof
my 2007 town car.  270k miles, rusty, bruised.  still my safe space, she always agrees and doesnt even burn oil.
It’s crazy how he showed his wife how  much he loved her in this song and then showed her how bad of a person she is in scornful woman
Like it, but same mojo and tempo off beat as the others. I dig it though! Great feeling!
Nobody 2025
Fire 🔥 bro. you kill it. ❤
Too bad that biotch is now trying to take all your shit. Women have been gone since Adam and Eve. Shit needs fixed.
Crazy to think this is about the same woman in Scornful Woman
How the hell are some people soooo talented?? I feel sorry that the music has to come from pain but god is using you my friend to create this feeling that’s indescribable while listening to Mr. Anthony
All of this is ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Im shitty labor on a construction site an this is the only music that keeps us under dogs going
It's a very special gift and if everything didn't get destroyed that I had there'd be a lot of special people❤❤❤🎉
This song is harder to listen to since the new ones come out
Been a huge fan since I first saw, “Richmond.” Even bigger fan after seeing you on Rogan. He was right telling you you don’t need a huge plan. Just be you. You are the plan. You’ve got what it takes! Thanks for the inspiration you’ve provided for literally countless folks. The world needs many more like you, but it doesn’t seem to happen that way. Also, I’ll be praying for you, I’m sure fame ain’t easy, brother. God’s got you!
His new one is another awesome song... Lots of heart... You can feel his pain... Kind of makes you relive some of your own past pains... Hopefully getting it out helps him... With the pain... I think it's definitely gonna help him financially...  Listen to it Scornful Woman!
The shots that have blurry branches in the foreground make me feel like im hiding in the woods watching Oliver Anthony.
My God. How could this woman ever leave this man? He writes a song that makes him millions. He then puts out a song dedicated to his wife. She still leaves him for the money, and not just half of the money he's making, but more than that because she was with him when he had no money. Lawyers are trash, for the most part. She is trash completely and entirely.
I’ve never had a song hit me this hard , I’m usually a rap/hip hop listener but when I hit a rough patch in my life, I heard this song and I’ve been hooked on Oliver Anthony ever since! Thanks for your music Oliver! #mensmentalhealth
This song hits a lil different after scorned woman!!
I’ll tell you where you’re gonna go in the back of that 90 something Chevy. She’s gonna Take your ass to the courthouse to get a divorce. Then she’s gonna take your ass to the cleaners when she get half your money. The sun isn’t the only thing that’s gonna sink nice and low. Your goddamn bank account will also sink nice and low when she takes all your money.
That 90s Chevy has broken down. Time to take it and trade it in for a new one
AMEN!
Oliver stay strong! There are people who love your messages. You are a voice for many who don’t have the talent you do to express what we are feeling. I’m a widow and lost my soulmate 10 yrs ago, today would have been his b-day. A day doesn’t go by that I don’t miss him. But I had a love that many never find no matter how painful it is. Don’t give up on love or yourself, your soulmate is out there and God has a plan for you! There are a lot of people who will try and pull you down or pretend to be your friend and take everything from you (your wife seems to be one of them), I trusted the wrong people after my husband died and have lost everything we had worked so hard for(“friends” so we thought) I was so devastated that didn’t see everything was being stolen before me. I am now having to start over at 58 yrs old, it’s a struggle but I know God has a plan for me! Oliver God has a plan for you and when the time is right he will put her into your life and all of this pain will have been needed so you could meet the right person! Money & material things are worthless if you don’t have someone to share it with. Makes life easy, but there’s always a void. Don’t give everything to her, it won’t make your pain go away. You deserve NOT to struggle even though your music is priceless and will bring you more money, YOU EARNED IT AND WORKED HARD FOR IT! Don’t give up sweetheart your best years are a head of you! I will be praying for you! God Bless
Seems crazy that it has already been two months since you were here in our small town.  It was such a blessing for you to come play for use on our main street.  I was five feet from the stage, yet still I didn't get to tell you my story. I hope you'll come back next year so we can do it all over again.  Much love from Spruce Pine!
Let’s not forget Eve wasn’t created when Adam was told by God not to eat from the tree. Good music btw!
Love you brother.
Awesome music

The chick before she seen money now refer to the scornful woman song!😂
Just saw you on JRE again! Scornful woman I'm guessing you wrote about my ex that stole my money and fuckin dog. Good to see real country again. I'm so fucking broke welding all god damn day 7 days a week. Exhausted. It's good to see us workin men get blessed for our talents every so often, and I'm genuinely happy for you, and it keeps me going. Love you, man
The song lyrics and setting could not be better wish I was there!!!
I feel like i can trust your music
Cool tent
I guess it finally broke down
My dad has ALS and he plays this every morning since he found out. When he passes this will be played at his funeral and yes it’s in the will 😂😂😂
Welp that didnt age well
💜
😮
Sitting out back jamming this song . Man it’s a goodin!!
❤️
😂
I wish i could like it more than once
Chris, can you sing something about my guardian angel , Lance corporal,,,,Chapman The giant of a man  gave his life, so as i could hear you sing.
Joe saved his life, these woman are bad women
Wow!  Left me with goosebumps and tears.  God has blessed you with words.  Please keep sharing your songs.
Zebco
I had a 95 Chevy 1500. It was a perfect truck. I could crawl into the engine bay and sleep comfortably
Crazy, I’m assuming this girl he’s singing about is the same one he’s singing about in the new one, scornful woman.
Funny how much a year can change a woman
Chevy. Forever
You were great
My '94 Chevy has the 4.3......I need a 350.
I give up. Every song is my favourite song. Blessings from Zimbabwe. Thank you Mr Anthony.
Got rid of my 87 Chevy years ago and it’s been a huge regret. Miss ol’ girl.
Women can unleash some stuff on either end of the spectrum but you usually won’t experience it for no reason at all 🤔 Takes two🤔 Ain’t getting the spark from one piece of wood. Some sh!t going down here. Good song. Love me some Oliver Anthony ❤️
I don't know why this song has not the top charts
God this song hits me hard. I will never get rid of my 1992 GMC short wide it's Red with 18" tires on it so I can get out in the woods. With a big ice chest in the back the bed full of beer.
It's so good to hear music go back to it's Roots! Talk about a jam keep it up Buddy, good on ya
I can’t love this song enough.  True, real, original country! 💪🇺🇸🤘💕
The girl had a nice voice  too !!! 😊😊😊
Love this song and my ole 97 Chevy
I’ve watched this about a dozen times and it keeps getting better every time. I love it. Keep up the music.😊
What exactly is a zemcone?
Send me on a single cruise. I've given  up hope
music reflects something in the soul
From loving 90s fords my whole life I love this song alittle more

This is me and my wife I love this
I listen to your music everyday since i heard u i truly am a fan it reminds me of when i was a kid  better time
Such a simple man. Probably didn't expect to blow up the way he did. Man this guy rocks
Love jamming this in my 2000 Cadillac Escalade. For those that don’t know, those are based on the GMT400 platform (88-00) *real GM heads know it’s NOT 88-98* so this song is still relevant 😅
Thank you Oliver Anthony great music brother keep it coming love your music
Good one bro ❤
Real music here thank you for using your gift! Good for the soul
Annoying the fucking insurance commercials between tracks. I can get down in the vibe and embrace the frustration but the campy/corny evil advertising of these leeches just brings me right back to anger. Fuck you insurance. Fuck you Target.     Let me listen please I need a goddamn moment.
Listen to this everyday in my 95 OBS
No
Someone needs to explain to Beyonce what country is
❤
He makes every country song  from the last 15 years sound like k-pop
I'm a white N french Canadian, and i love this song.
God bless.
I love this song more than any other song on the planet
Sometimes I just like to have some time alone. And more 92 Chevrolet pickup truck. Kind of makes you wonder do we actually have time to ourselves
Today I've been drinking alcohol for quite a while. It's already 12:22 in the morning. And boss wants me to go to work but I think I'm going to take the day off
And I love to drink beer. And I'll sit here my 92 Chevy listen to the radio and enjoying myself for my days off. Until I get back on my tent for 13 hour day shifts
All over I got a 92 Chevy GMC I have a 92 4x4 Z71 and Lord you are 100% right about the 92 Chevy. They both sound terrific I love my trucks
😂
Born and raised in WVa, in Texas I really want to home to die 😊
Carter and Cash  ,  !!  ,so. Cool  .,.
This is a masterpiece !!
WE IRISHTINIANS ARE ONE WITH PALESTINE, AGAINST NAZI ISRAEL HOLOCAUST OF 220,000 CIVILIANS &40,000 LITTLE KIDS. SHAME ON YOU EVIL AMERICA,  GERMANY
Everytime I come back to this song it makes me want to keep my 90some Chevy even if it aint doin shit for me but pissing off the neighbors
Yeah
I love  your music.  Funny thing is I work for Toyota and I'm a good old boy like you straight out of the midwest.  Keep going amigo.  We love your heart and soul type of music.
Why can't I like this twice?
I put in place of a 90s something Chevy my twenty eleven Chevy. Ole girl has been there for me with my ole dog through the women I’ve been with. The ole Mississippi River knows my ole rust twenty eleven Chevy like the back of her hand. Many nights with the ole dog and some poles drinking a case of beer wondering where my life’s gonna go tomorrow. Thank you Oliver for this anthem I’ve caught some biggins listening to your music. Thank you
His voice is crazy, his songs are so good!
❤❤❤
Just got my 1999 chevy c2500 out the shop for minor repairs. Played this shortly after. ❤️
My rent has just gone up again due to supply and demand!!
Daaaamn sam...Oliver keep preaching I'm listening!!!!!
I love your music keep it up. Your real country.. your what we've been waiting for
Voice like Doc Watson
Dude's got some of the best pipes.
I've been having a rough time recently, trying to do right by my son and make him and my parents proud this song reaches my soul. Keep doing your thing man
Well this is my wife andy life.
This one’s gotta be my favorite I believe. My dude representing out here 🔥 🔥
Where are you from Oliver?
My people...
❤❤❤🤠🤠🤠🤠😻🫶🫶🫶🙌🙌🙌👏👏
Rebuilding my 90 some chevy longbed
Wow😢
This is outlaw the is great man outlaw Way
My 90 some Chevy has outlasted ALL the women. Wouldn't trade that rusted old truck for a Ferrari.  Its rough around the edges, and sometimes groans when it gets moving...that truck is JUST LIKE ME.
PLEASE DOING SOMINGTHING  85 CHEVY.............
Such a breath of fresh air
🫶🏽
Man idk if you will see my comment but your music helps me get through life.  There ain’t a country artist alive like you.   Thanks for being so real and sounding so true!
Hits home.
ALWAYS AND FOREVER
Love Chevy trucks brother this is me
Damn good song
nothing like ole like an ole Chevy ❤
Was ist eigentlich mit der Europa Tour? Haben Karten gekauft für Hamburg und wurde einfach abgesagt ohne das irgend eine Info dazu kommt warum oder wie es weiter geht. Berlin, Hamburg, Stuttgart abgesagt aber für Köln werden Karten weiter verkauft. Sehr fraglich und entäuschend.
Damn I feel old with my dude
We need another rousing anthem from this country prophet, please!!!!!
As much as i love alll of your music and messages. This is my personal favorite..
I love love love this song! Maybe someday I'll have my own life w a 90s something chevy
1994 Silverado over 300k miles 😢 don't wanna leave it.
Bbbj😊
Bbbnkkk😊
It's been a while since this comment section has seen any action, and you probably don't check these kinds of things, but just wanted to drop by and say there's still plenty of ears on you.   It's damn good music. Keep playing it.
Drinking a little white lightening and jamming some tunes!!!🙏❤️
Vvvvvv😂❤
im a huge fan but that's not a 90 something chevy
Pure talent..American hero
Love your storytelling. Your soul is relatable. Keep up the great work we need more of this.
Sounds like he says a pack of beer and a zebco lol
Little bit
Man you are killing it. You need that fiddle brother.
Legit your best song
You can see i. The driving scene in the chevy altough its not a 90s car the aligment is all out of wack... Just like in my 98 landcruiser 😂😂
Too good this is what we need
I'm not a modern country fan. This is like cool clean water washin' that new country sound out of my mouth
Haunting wonderful music. So Glad he didn't get corrupted by the industry. Famous, but in the good way...
Great.
Good God almighty.
Great new sound I'm enjoying it
damn i wish we could get these versions of out in the woods on apple music. the ambient noise is so nice with this guy
WHO is here with me in 2025?
i dont like this. bro had a unique virginia hillbilly accent but changed it to a stereotypical country redneck accent.
The spider injection needs replacement 😮😂
My younger brother fell out with my family and changed his first and surname years ago.  Hasn’t spoken to me (his older brother) for about 7 years now.   Never really understood what happened. “You wanna change my name gotta drain my blood” hit hard in this song
What's a zemco?
Love this!!!! Great Story Telling
Signs of a great song. Easy to play, easy to sing, hard to forget. Check, check & check.
I may be a Ford guy (06 Ranger, 08 F150, 16 Edge).. but I will always respect loyalty and this song rings true.
Wow.
Hahaha old pervert red lol!
MayDay!!!!!!!
Keep making music like this
Was this based off of Ryan upchurch song "the other country boy"? He says 90 sumthing chevy several times in that song...
Classic
Another Kick Ass song, I wish it were a Square body Chevy even better !!! Love it ...we're going to catch a show one of these days somewhere, The Rhyman I hope.
Thank you for the music you make. It’s helped me through a lot this year ❤
Dang this is music
That old darling of mine is like a 90 some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing that sounds better than that old 350 Is when she's running up to kiss me When I get home, it's been a hard day I tell you, darling, it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs Go and listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek We can take her nice and slow A case of beer and it's hell cold Let the sun sing, good Lord There ain't no telling where we'll go Back in that 90 some Chevy In the back of that 90 some Chevy Well, she's hotter than hell, I'm higher than gas She's sweeter than honey, I'm poor white trash She ain't had a check, that I couldn't cash Yes, if she's my Carter, then I'm her Cash And I've been sitting around, and drinking on it I guess I'm gonna have to get me a ring and get it on it 'Cause that old darling of mine is like a 90 some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing that sounds better than that old 350 Is when she's running up to kiss me When I get home, it's been a hard day I tell you, darling, it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs Go and listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek We can take her nice and slow A case of beer and it's hell cold Let the sun sing, good Lord There ain't no telling where we'll go In the back of that 90 some Chevy In the back of that 90 some Chevy That old darling of mine is like a 90 some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on
You inspire so many of us. Don’t lose yourself in this.
Just sold my 90 model to an 18 yr old man from Braxton county. The truck needs some love but seeing a young man with that ol school ambition I once had as a younger man myself. Well it gave me some more faith. Jesus Christ has blessed us again.
In my opinion. 78 Chevy would have been much better. But, I am probably 20 years older than Oliver.
🔥
Lol dude my newborn only falls asleep to this song... It's crazy just winds him right on down
SNOOPY...I LOVE U❤
God bless you. So many people on earth  and theres so much history , each person gets to write a tiny meaningless part of it. You're probably lucky if you even ripple the pond, sometimes you give a big enough part of yourself you make a wave like this gentleman here. Imagine, if you created something that every single person relies on...that would be a tidal wave. Imagine ...the tidal wave that destroyed almost everything that had been created up until that very moment in time....and then it's literally erased. That would suck...thank God some of it was preserved ..I am here humble , sometimes a good education makes you feel better when things don't make sense. I'm too stupid to make a computer and then ..make a virus. And then make a virus that feeds a machine ..and you won't get one from here. But maybe a clearer picture..https://youtu.be/pWmpCtxLjCM?si=XW8uxZWYLvOBGcTw
❤  Love it  ❤
One of my favorites
Love your music
Im 12 and i have listened to song from the 60 and i love them country for life
@oliveranthonymusic  ❤️ This Just Became One Of My Favorite Songs. I own a 94 silverado, @ 365K  miles, and she's not road worthy ATM , She thinks she's a crop duster when You Crank Her, but as long as There's Juice in The Battery. She'll fire right up on the 1st try. I miss driving it so bad. She's a  thirsty tank, but there's nothing quite like an old Chevy Silverado!❤
Its a 53.
@aleks_complex
I love you. Wedding song❤
Hey there Chris or Oliver whatever you like to be called  your music makes me think of North Carolina when I used to live there thank you sir you have a wonderful day stay safe ✌️
I'm proud of you my brother
He's got a whail like a bobcat with so much intensity and soul in his vocals.
wonder if chevy will ever use this song in a commercial
Dear Mr Anthony,  thank you for your obedience to doing whats right and using your God given gifts and passion for good. Maybe i could come see you play sometime,  if your near the swamps of Louisiana close to New Orleans. I'd love to see you and bring my granddaughter and introduce her to your music in person!
I still want you to sing me outta this world! You definitely are an outta this world singer and writer  but I want you singing to me when I am on my way out, that is if I am slowly going,  obviously a heart attack or something quick like that I won't have time for singing but I definitely want you singing to be what I hear last.
God bless you for singing the truth
❤ euchre tournament❤
Before :-(obamalay (❤ #90 some Chevy  W/350
I stumbled across this guy...new favorite artist
Love it!!! Ohio United States.
Frogs have been talkin' 'bout that old rusted chevy, should have been smart and bought a ride not so crappy. no telling how far I'll go in that chevy,  coulda been smart and bought a good ford but didn't have the money, dang I'm dumb for not saving up and relying on this ol' rusty chevy that the frogs done took and threw it in the ocean. Oh, dang, my old old chevy, couldn't get a ride no matter how I tryin'. Now I'm sittin' on this ol' road cryin'. Oh, hey, that ain't nothing like an ol' chevy rusted, can't get around cause dang motors busted. :)
KEEP TWANGIN GOOD SIR!!!!!!!! CHEERS FROM SOUTHERN ONTARIO !!!!! POOR WHITE TRASH ;)
i'm pertnear 50 and this made me cry
50's Chevys are better
John would be very proud damn phenomenal as always
Brother you have a fantastic voice and message in every song!
Id say he should of been driving that 90s gmc in this video if it dont run sen it my way ill make it sing like my 98 305
You look like you were enjoying singing that song. Awesome as always sir.
I'm 32 years old and this hit me like a ton of bricks my uncle and grandpa taught me how to be a man and my uncle died 3 days before my birthday in 2023 life is hard man
F dude! You absolutely take tears out of my soul when you sing, this one hit my soul hard brother.
The grief muscle. It’s a U-shaped muscle in the forehead. That’s only developed by people who have known a lot of grief. It’s a rough muscle to have. Also, please tell your mom and dad I said, thank you for bringing you to the world.  More covers! This land is your land by Woody Guthrie
Love your music
This should be on country radio repeat 😊
Another great day when Mr. Anthony gives his heart and soul. Makes this hillbilly proud
I read another comment that said it perfectly, I haven’t ever clicked on a video so fast. Except for the introduction last night.
There are a bunch of really nervous Rich men North of Richmond right now!
❤❤❤❤❤
What a belssing to the world his music has been.  He deserves all the success
I'm from South Wales uk. My dad was a minor of coal for 40 years. Magerat thatcher killed the coal industry in the 80s it destroyed Wales as a coal mining country. Our mountains are basically coal. But wind and solar are taking over because safer for the planet but Wales as a country is suffering, last month our steel industry just got abolished, thousands of jobs just got terminated even after promises they'd be safe. Oliver reaches more than just the Americans  he's known worldwide ❤ Be safe everyone
Reading the comments and seeing how his music resonates with hard working people from all over the world is incredible…God sent this man to us when we needed to hear songs that remind us we are not alone. We are all going through these battles, but we are not alone 🙏🏻
YeeYee
I ❤u
Need help understanding this line.  "We can take her nice and slow. A case of beer and a what?"  Sounds like Zemco.
Instant top 10 favorite song.  My Playlist goes Oliver Anthony, Young Thug, Polo G, Jason Aldean, Colt Ford, Three six Mafia, Ect... lol
He was close and then went right back to the programed class warfare.  People living in poverty eating fudge rounds aren’t the issue.
❤
You and Red Clay Strays are turning me.....Country ❤
Country, or Western isn't my music choice, until this song.  Wow, I love the music and his voice ❤
Thank you for the music 🎶👏
Your the best singer
I never really listened to country music until I discovered you. Every country song I heard on the radio didn't sound like a country song. They had trap beats, rap. Thats no country. I really apricate how much bring life into the age of corporatized songs made just for a profit. You care genially care about music.
What??? This is the first time I'm hearing this and it's been out for 5 years. This is awesome!!!
Lovely song, beautiful voice. I admire this man, he works hard and sings from the heart.❤❤❤❤❤❤
This guys music is Perfection
Keep em coming❤
The fact this describes my truck perfectly
LEGEND better than Jonny cash
97 Silverado extended cab checking in 🫡
My weekend a few months a year maybe pull out this ring 😢 na groovy Groovy god bless
I just love this man's soul, I have had the chance to see him twice. It was amazingly painful but I was dreaming about doing it for a while after getting ill.
Wow Brother, that's a powerful song! Another one is gonna hit the books bro❤🇺🇲🙏🏼God  Bless America and our world
I'm not a fan of country music but this guy is pretty good.
It’s been a while since I heard a song that gives me goosebumps!!  This is🔥!!!  His voice 🤯
Outstanding
better put a ring on it
Son as long as you are here God has a plan for you.Talk to him hes uses People who have a heart .And and obey him.❤10/29/24
Is there any way to go see Tom? Does he have any shows still? I'm very impressed by Tom and his whole life. We all go through phases or chapters in life, and Tom has written many.   I like the way he shows his wild side and his   more serious self.  It shows that people are complex and  that we are all sharing one common struggle.  Our individual journeys through life.
90 Some Chevy =  My #1 song currently. All the lyrics hit extremely close to home. Well done brother. Hey, whats the biggest buck you've taken from that tree stand?
My favorite song to listen to in my 99 k1500 lol
I have to thanks YouTube algorithm for matching me up with Mr Anthony’s music. But huge thanks just got to this man with a mic and a guitar speaking to my heart. Not a country fan or religious. But his music connects deep into my soul. I’ve listened to all his songs that many times he’s well and truly inserted into my YT mix. Thanks Oliver. You’re a true artist. Btw your dogs nonchalantly ignoring you is so funny lol
Best song I heard love riding in the ol 99 burban
definitely shot on sony a7iv
98 or 99 ya I had one 450 thousand km whatever that's in miles alot.....gave to the heart and stroke foundation for a three hundred dollar tax receipt from Edmonton remand center....actually it was some other foundation I think but I miss that old girl.........
My hubby and I have been married for 31 years in February (1994). We have been talking about renewing our vows in our backyard. This will definitely be a song we will be playing at the ceremony!!!

Классно поёшь брат я из России

Never wished i could shake a non veteran mans hand as much. Tha k you for standing in the gap and carrying your voice
Yr brilliant bruv ! X
Respect what you do Anthony! Here is a song my dad wrote!   https://youtu.be/woiwTIFLupA?si=T5baDyeDSHlaP7SN
This one was absolutely incredible! The voice and the message was spot on.

ive got a place in the woods with the deer rabbit foxx kestrel buzzard vole all over the place. northern england
Brother,  never change!! Amen🙏🏻🙏🏻
Everyone who reads this, we don't know each other and probably never will but I wish you all the best in life and all the luck in the world.
My new favorite singer, you are amazing !
Good doggos
My favorite song man. Absolutely beautiful song When we get married I'll be my girl said me can play it for our first dance
West Virginia is for lover's
I too love Gretsch instruments. Can't believe I missed you at the WV state fair!
I have been a concrete worker since I was 16 I am 33 now I feel like this man has finally gave me a voice the way they take advantage of middle-class Americans. It’s just not right we’re the ones that build your cities make your fancy homes and only ask for an honest days pay in return, but there’s nothing honest about the taxes. I pay not only on my paycheck, but then food and gas and everything in between it’s hard to provide for a family in this world we live in. I say vote this man for president. Finally, somebody who gets it all of these millionaires in the world with money they can’t even dream of ways to spend meanwhile, people like me are starving barely getting by working 60 hour weeks for next to nothing. God bless this man.
Your the real deal Oliver, music in it's purest state.
It's been a year and I'm still listening and praying you're holding close to Jesus. Even with all the money, keep holding your family and Jesus close. Hold strong, Satan is always looking for clinks in your armor. Blessings,and we're proud of you.🙏
Big Love for all The Goddamn Appalachia. Prestonsburg KY.
Excellent 👌
Absolutely fantastic
80 something chevy she loves it
Gold!
Makes me want a 90 model
A long time needed song Jesus Christ of nasareth please forgive me for my sins calling the name of Jesus is how i get by day by day amen ❤❤❤❤
Oliver....love you bro .
The man took Beyonce's "put a ring on it" and made it something new.
Breath of fresh air feel this sht in my soul
Love You Brother!! I Think Your Music Is Awesome!!
I really like this song.
I was with a girl for 10 years we separated for 2 months I got engaged with her after all that time we were engaged for 6 months I found out she had a secret relationship that whole time being engaged we got back together because I can't afford to leave yet I'm starting to think I should have stayed gone but I'm on probation and can't leave.
Man i really like your songs and i feel that way to i live in west vg
Just sitting here in my shop drinking some beer and jamming out I love this guy's songs restoring my Ole 91 Chevy but beer got in the way today lol
Man I love every lyric sung...really hits the spot
You think this sounds good wait till you see him live. Goosebumps and all.
I love my truck almost as much as the Mrs And when she's not looking I might give it hugs n kisses https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=yb0aV2pvFys&si=mzHzjx5QLHAEP1C9 0:25

That was just a lil dirty Mr. OLIVER ANTHONY...❤❤
Ignore the negative comments.
Come west. West .❤
Thats a song that gets me it fantastic thank you 2 guys
God bless ya Sir ❤ Thank you you keep me turning screws tapping toes and the lights ON
Awesome, 22 Vets a day take their lives and this is the hope that Hardy gives! I am a Vet, I've got issues, but taking dope and getting wasted on crown will only send you further down that road to where you decide to point the gun at your head instead of the sky. I like a lot of Hardy's work, but he totally blew it with this one. Sorry being a redneck will not save you from depression and coping with severe injuries. And yes, try Jesus! He changed my life and gave me something that this song fails to give... hope
🔥🇺🇸 there’s just something about your music !!🎵   Killing it brother !!   Keep on doing you !!   It hits me deep !! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
❤❤❤ all respect
As a mechanic this hit home so hard! I literally made a living on working on the king of engines the small block chevy.  Love my wife and love that engine!
LFG! Such an awesome song!
What a gift the Lord has given you Oliver. You are a blessing to millions now that need to hear how God's presence can be felt in this upside down world we live in. Thank you.
the phone recordings sound rawest
Oliver, I love your style of music. Sincerely ,Karen Jetters  👏
That old darling of mine is like a 90 some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing that sounds better than that old 350 Is when she's running up to kiss me When I get home, it's been a hard day I tell you, darling, it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs Go and listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek We can take her nice and slow A case of beer and it's hell cold Let the sun sing, good Lord There ain't no telling where we'll go Back in that 90 some Chevy In the back of that 90 some Chevy Well, she's hotter than hell, I'm higher than gas She's sweeter than honey, I'm poor white trash She ain't had a check, that I couldn't cash Yes, if she's my Carter, then I'm her Cash And I've been sitting around, and drinking on it I guess I'm gonna have to get me a ring and get it on it 'Cause that old darling of mine is like a 90 some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing that sounds better than that old 350 Is when she's running up to kiss me When I get home, it's been a hard day I tell you, darling, it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs Go and listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek We can take her nice and slow A case of beer and it's hell cold Let the sun sing, good Lord There ain't no telling where we'll go In the back of that 90 some Chevy In the back of that 90 some Chevy That old darling of mine is like a 90 some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on
Thank you, may the lord be with you
Keep making music. It's great. - Theodore Alexander Vegh ❤️🇺🇲🌎
I am 52. I am lost. Doing as little as possible. Smoking Weed and Vapes. Do nothing with my life.
You're perfect. Just as God made you, brother.
Cooking some blackberry peach brandy as I type this. Ya ever get up this way west Virginia. I'll have it waiting
Easily my favorite song, such a banger. Pa to Wv 🤙🏼
Sounds like a song that belongs on the radio to me.
Hell yeah bud
Please post lyrics. Especially the line after 6 pack of beer.
I haven’t been interested in music in a long time often choosing to listen to a podcast or audiobook instead. Your music hit my heart and I can’t tell you how much it meant to me. Keep doing you brother. I’ve grown up in Georgia and just tried to stay out of politics and keep chugging on for my family. It’s hard listening to news trying to divide us. Harder listening to general population agree with it. Thanks for your music. It made a difference to me.
Your music ❤
89 f150, 93 ranger, 05 f150, and a 07 Silverado,,, all American made, and yep, j got me ,4 trucks💪🇺🇸
Hi
🤠
I listen to the same song 94 times its great music and i never like country music until know love the music man keep up the good work Oliver Anthony.
marry me plz
0:39 saw you last night add to ever wise theater in Indianapolis 😊 my 1-year-old and my three year old loves your music @oliveranthonymusic
This hits home....
Been listening to music on YouTube for a while and the only good thing about hard times is that we get some damn good music from it.
Poor guy got robbed.  Mighta had some good music but the money traveled quicker.
Your music is telling the world how things are for us the regular people. My dad was coal miner in KY got black lung when I was in highschool. It was awful seeing him struggling to breathe when he got older. He's been with the Lord since 2022. Where I grew up coal mines was the best way to support families but dangers.
True oppression is not knowing you are being oppressed.  U.S. is the best country in the world and the people in power know that and take advantage of that
❤❤❤
Very well done - thank you so much! ❤️🤍💙🇺🇸
Old cars n trucks are the best!!
I got a 1999 GMC Yukon OBS  and i love this song
Me too! We know the times are all in His hands and when Jesus comes for His own it will be beautiful and spectacular for each of us. Your music is the most soul searing I’ve heard since Woody Guthrie and those of that time. Thanking the Lord for the integrity and truth He has built in you.  God bless and Godspeed your way.
OLIVER PLEASE GIVE US A THIRD VERSE...GOD BLESS..LOVE THIS DEEP...
I had a 91 z28 with a 350, what a war machine!!!!!!!
You come nearly close to looking exactly like JFK(John F. Kennedy). If you shaved facial hair, made the hair on your head dark brown near black, wore same suit JFK wore and adopted his beliefs and most parts of his personality....you would be second coming of JFK.  The idea will look as resurrection of JFK.
I've listened to Waylon,  Willie, Cash,  Conway and George Jones. This guys not bad, but I don't see all the fuss.
Your The Next Neil Young!  Thank You!
His name isn't Oliver by the way
❤❤❤

Anyone trying to write a love song, take notes. This is how you do it!
This is his best song by far don’t get me wrong rich men hits great but this song is a++ quality
Oliver you should make a song chasing the rich man's gold just to get slivers of  the pie
It’s a beautiful day out…hate to waste it being upset.
This is real music. No autotune, no special affects, no occult symbolism. Just a dude in the woods preaching truth. The world needs this so bad right now. Keep it up brother!
Love.  I've got a 50 some chevy.
Country folk are good people ❤🙏
You’re the reason my life is ok Man . Just want you to understand that you changed my outlook on a lot of things and life could never be better because of it ✌️🎶@oliveranthonymusic
This is a great song. I don't need much and this points to me
We love you Oliver I absolutely adore that you are not trying to sign a label and will not.   Also the video apologizing for signing a label was absolutely hilarious. I don't know he seems like a trustworthy agent 🤣
Pure GOLD!   Stay Golden Ponyboy! You inspire me. God Bless and much love man
The country music I miss 🖤🖤🖤
I got my papa's 1993 gmc she's got a 350 in her. I bet money it's one of the most clean obs out there in America besides the paint. No dents no rust. She just needs a lil paint. Interior looks like it just came off the lot pop really did take care of the Ole gal. Much love to you and the fans. This song reminds me of pops personality so much ❤❤ I miss him soooo much!! RIP PAPA HARRY! ❤
Ever come 2 florida I'd like to hear see him play at a park or a bar on a Nice cool day
Does he normally write a book or anything? No he just listens to music and screams out Dolly normally and asks Ty do you like is song all the time? Pods
Dolly!!!!!!

Love you Oliver Anthony, give those pups a xo for me, from one old soul to another. 💝🇨🇦🐾

Now this is country music never have I ever heard good music since Hank Williams Junior and all the old good ones
Boi I know you got 3 mosquito bites lmao love you brah
This song and rich men  north of Richmond have brought me to country music, and I'm a techno/psychedelic trance head to heart. I can't explain it but this mans music hits hard.  I have a good life that I am very grateful for and this man's lyrics make me realise how lucky I really am and how we can all take it for granted at times. Thankyou brother. I can imagine there are many people out there that need this music and its messages to keep their heads above water.
SO sweet a moments of peace in my shitty low life✌
get back to it
Nothing but love coming from skykomish Washington. Small tiny town in the mountains. Keep it up, and happy 4th of July
Hey buddy your voice is amazing write a song like The Thunder Rolls by night time and thunder and cheating to go through that in this 2024 version you will sell records you couldn't believe
The critique of capitalism at its finest....

Good music, 🫡
I was stranded in Virginia for a few days, i loved it i want to live there now.
This song is very underrated at 10 million views not best song forsure
Damn son! I’m old enough now to say shit like they don’t do country like they used to. But hearing you makes me thankful that artists like you don’t give a shit what people say. You’re an amazing original sounding Country singer that actually has an honest soul and something real to say. I wish you all the best. I doubt it matters much in the scope of shit…but brother, you have my respect!
You can tell its a great song when you look where people click on the video timeline. The beginning...let me play that one more time...one more time...one more time.
From a metalhead your music is a barrier breaker I love it keep gettn brother

If a politician would just talk to us like regular people they would win elections

Ty Sir for sharing your incredible talent and inspiring insight
Sitting in an old 1997 Chevrolet C1500 Stepside, nodding my head along to this, remembering my gf that I shared many moments with.
I think the reason why this wasn't a number 1 smash is because you're on the wrong side of the Atlantic
Love these songs!
Just a norn iron guy whose grown up with sectarian politics loving your music - keep er lit
See you in Canandaigua soon old boy
I can really can relate to this one, a19yo in the back of a 1990 chevy van...........😎👍

💜🙏🌠
I hope you and the family are good brother has the popular wore off yet
I love this song, but every time I sing it around the wife, she hates being compared to an old truck 😂 so I switch to “Always Love You Like a Good Ole Dog” to give some perspective. Doesn’t usually work out in my favor 🤷🏼‍♂️
Blastin this in my 91 c2500
This is what I want, I want to be able to take a fucking break, to let off the gosh darn gas and take my wife someplace safe. Best music I have heard in a long time.

Oliver Anthony is a bum and his career is over. Simple as that…
I HAD A 99 BURBAN THAT WAS GREAT
Your voice has a special ability to speak to my heart and soul. I'm taking back to a place where I felt rich without any money in my pocket.
One of the few songs on YouTube that can minimized without premium.  Oliver is a real one.
I like turtles
I feel like music like this is giving me another couple years to carry on
Love this song and I am in 6th grade
Still rocking it everyday
0:46 ❤😅😮😊🎉
0:46
Hell yes
Keep doing you man! Real music, not some bullshit from some industry that doesn't care about the people actually making the music. Stay real brother, never sell out your doing fine all on your own.
I fuckin love you bro
This is one of the ones I just keep coming back to.  Such a great song.  And that's coming from a proud Ford owner.  Bless you Oliver
Can't wait to see you on Friday in Albany GA
Thank you. Hope you continue to speak for us common, hardworking people. Need to see when you come in concert near Oklahoma city.Oklahoma.   best wishes and continued success . Keep speaking for the average joe
It’s funny , I’ve heard country industry guys not give this guy credit but  I’d rather listen to this instead of the shit coming out of VietNashville.
love it!
Ого! Парень, ты крут! Мне скинули ссылку на твой канал и я буквально заслушался... Привет тебе из России! Здоровья и творческих успехов!!! 👍👏
Instant Hit!
If this guy sells out, I'll be done with music.
Wish this and ain't got a dollar was on the album. Love em
I really hoped the rhetoric that dems and republicans dont care about us
Keep on doing God’s work. You’re are  the voice for the voiceless. 🥰
Im obsessed with his voice

Your music is the only thing that will calm my baby 100% of the time.
Yo a gift bro
Yes square box Chevy 😮fuck a fordl 😂lmfao😅
Dude im not a country fan never have been but your music has showed me true meaning of country, how music effects your moods and finaly that rap was bringing down my energy. Country makes me happy i dont get it. I used to be scared to listen lmao
2:32 "...back of that 90 somethin' Chevy" then immediately shows the GMC truck (nicer GM family), lol. I know it's going on a shoestring budget with what you had at the time, just thought it was funny. :D 2:32
She's hotter than hell I'm higher than gas She's sweeter than honey I'm poor white trash  Man that describes me and my girl perfectly
Anyone else think Oliver Anthony sounds like Mr. Gerison from South Park when he sings????
Man I love ur music dude me and wife  listen to you all the time
Close caption has no idea what he's saying 🤣 turn it on
I wanna go home.🙏
Just found this artist. Never was interested in country music but I listen to this album everyday cruising around in my patrol car ❤

2:34 GMC=Great man's chevy 😁😉😉 Absolutely love you and this tune.
I tell ya what my 95 Chevy has been there for me when no one else was. It’s gotten me moved into serval knew places. I’ve had it through the struggle I’ll never get rid of it because it reminds of when times weren’t easy.
Living the country life peaceful and beautiful I miss it and ready to go back and sit back and enjoy all that life and God has blessed me with and listen to the amazing Oliver Anthony and find my country soul mate and love hard and laugh even harder hold my head up high and open my heart wide and see what life has in store
Beautiful.
I love you your music is the best

Should have said 80 something Chevy… that’s the best truck made…
I listen to your music in my old Ford and I tell her not to listen to that "stuck on the side of the road bit" from the other gig video from somewhere near Longwood.  One day I'll park her up front at your show brother. All ears.
I'm proud to be the happy owner of a 2019 Chevy. Mostly because it has a 9 in it. ❤
I love how the add that played before the song broke out was for a Chevrolet. ❤
love ya brother!!!!!!
That’s a efen bad one 90’ some Chevy
Tough American man right here
This is the soundtrack of my life as I drive my 97 Silverado around town. Your songs are beautiful and touch us in ways that modern music can't. Thank you for giving us so much of yourself.

Hey @oliveranthonymusic what do you think about the other artists using rich men north of Richmond and putting their own twist on it. Have you listened to any of them and is there any that stand out to you that you like? I’m super curious about your opinion on this.
Thank you for this fine music sir
Elvis ish with a bit o’ Johnny

Boy I never get tired of this song and hope I never do
Lovin it ❤
I had a 1996 K1500 Z71 with the 5.7L Vortec. Lots of memories in that truck. Lost it when my home burned. I still miss that beat up thing.
A message from Millennial to there Gen X Parent! Yep I got ya your turn now!! Xxx

She's my Carter and I'm her Cash one of the best lines ever
This will be our first dance at our wedding in September. hearing it live in London last night was incredible ❤️
Wish i had known you were in the uk
you popped up on my recommendation around 24 hours after you posted rich men north of Richmond
I saw Oliver perform this live on Wednesday night. This song sounded incredible. Had my husbands arms wrapped around me, swaying to this gorgeous song. Scotland loves you ❤
This is what kids should be looking up too. This are the personalities we should all make famous and promote to become influencers. People like him make a difference in this world. Stay Blessed Brother. Love <3
Nobody can EVER PAY FOR YOUR BROTHER AMAZING
Best. Song. Ever. Love it man, I feel you
‘97 3500 Chevy👍🏻
I wish I could come to the strawberry festival show but I have to work of course.. I'm just happy I can go back to Oliver Anthony music and see your original videos because there are the best
My baby is a Chevy fan... Lol

Ive owned 5 90 sumthin chevys. Lol
This man has became the greatest in a matter of a year. So amazing man! Soo amazing! Im not a man who cries but damn man. Touches the soul
A case of beer and a Zebco. A Zebco is a rod and reel in case anyone was wondering :)
I'll be seeing you in Manchester UK in 8 days!
Seriously not one single song of his isn't good
So much looking forward to the concert in Utrecht / The Netherlands. Just one week now!
Don’t ever leave the dogs out

Virginia is my fave
Sing this song everyday... and have been since late last summer! Thanks Chris for makin me feel like singing again... Appreciate you more than you know!!!
Savin up for a 90 some Chevy 😊
Ese viejo querido mío es como un Chevy del 90.   Ella cabalga justo cuando la excitas.   Lo único que suena mejor que ese viejo 350.   Es cuando ella corre para besarme   Cuando llego a casa, ha sido un día duro.   Te lo digo cariño, ha sido una semana larga. Quizás tenga que cargar a los perros.   Ve y escucha a las ranas croar en el arroyo. Podemos tomarla agradable y despacio.   Una caja de cerveza y hace un frío infernal. Deja que el sol cante, buen Señor.   No se sabe adónde iremos. En aquel 90 un poco de Chevy. En la parte trasera de ese 90 un Chevy.  Bueno, ella es más caliente que el infierno, yo soy más alto que el gas. Ella es más dulce que la miel, yo soy una pobre basura blanca.   Ella no tuvo un cheque que yo no pude cobrar. Sí, si ella es mi Carter, entonces yo soy su Cash.   Y he estado sentado y bebiendo de ello. Supongo que tendré que conseguirme un anillo y ponérselo. Porque ese viejo querido mío es como un Chevy del 90.   Ella cabalga justo cuando la excitas. Lo único que suena mejor que ese viejo 350. Es cuando ella corre para besarme.   Cuando llego a casa, ha sido un día duro. Te lo digo cariño, ha sido una semana larga. Quizás tenga que cargar a los perros. Ve y escucha a las ranas croar en el arroyo.   Podemos tomarla agradable y despacio. Una caja de cerveza y hace un frío infernal. Deja que el sol cante, buen Señor.   No se sabe adónde iremos.  En la parte trasera de ese 90 un Chevy.  En la parte trasera de ese 90 un Chevy.  Ese viejo querido mío es como un Chevy del 90. Ella cabalga justo cuando la excitas.
Case a beer and a zebco...... woh😢
@oliveranthonymusic We would love to see you down here in SWFL. The Plant City Strawberry festival is always a great venue.  God Bless You Sir 💯🤘
wow
Counting down til the April concert looking forward to it
I'm currently spinning my way through life from my back to the wall and I don't know which way to go. Fear is my everyday friend, even if unwanted. I haven't experienced such peace since I ran into you. You help me every day. Go on. btw, I'm from the Czech Republic.
My only issue with this music video is his driving a early to late teens chevy just because you show a 90s you should be in that driving by the new chevy
Love it greatest made truck ever!!
Such a good one!
I sent this to my wife and she loved it knowing I work alot and it is the best time of my life to get home and kiss her
Just finished a 60 hr week and boy this son hits me hard !! Can't wait to get home to my woman
What a refreshing gift! 🙌🏼  Please NEVER EVER go to any music award shows, with all the foolishness!! You will always stand out like you do!
Still rolling in my 91 Silverado "Rocky" ❤️❤️❤️
Love from michigan so glad you didnt sell your sell brother, god loves you
Why do the closed captions say "foriegn music" when this starts? 😂
We love you
love this song !!!!
A small block Ford sounds a lot better than that old 350 too. Just saying.
Oliver, I know you will probably never see or read this and I understand! I am 76 years old, farm raised country boy! Went into the military in 1966 and Vietnam in 68! I was honorably discharged in 70! I was pretty much an alcoholic! My mama’s prayers were answered in 71 on her deathbed and The Lord Jesus rescued me and saved my soul and my life! Worked hard in construction until God called me into the ministry for 40 years! I am retired with severe heart problems! Finding you and your music and songs has stirred me in the depths of my soul! I love you young Brother and I am praying for you that God will protect you and use you and your ministry greatly! 🙏❤️👍🇺🇸
Much love from north east England
Love it!!  Keep on keeping on the good road my friend.  Like it or not you sir have become a beacon of light in such a dark world.  The lord has most definitely heard your prayers for guidance and it shows    Gives me hope that he hears mine as well. Be blessed friend!!
He reminds me of AC/DC.........the songs all sound the same .
I just wish I had my 98 1500 on 35s to let the wife ride to those places just once ....
@oliveranthonymusic your a national treasure, youre making real music for real people. thank you
Rodeo Houston! 🎉

Hey this sounds just as good in my 1972 Chevy C 30 on a muddy road in Alaska. Thanks Oliver.✌️
so purdy
As somebody who isn't usually into this style of music, isn't christian, and who had a 90 some Chevy with a 350 and thought it was a piece of shit but know what you mean.  Your music speaks to me.  Keep singing and playing from your heart and conscious and I believe it will do you well.
Your music's Fire man you deserve the best
Love...just love
Just sweet sound.
We’re giving credit, where credit is due. Just keep God first and stay true to who you are. Just keep singing with the style of music that your comfort with. God bless!!!!!
Beauty
Truth nothing runs better then a 350 ❤
i can tell you love that tent, keep being faithful brother. hope you come to arkansas some day
Happy new year!  God bless y'all
Bro, you called her a 350 and she didn't leave you?
That old darlin' of mine is like a 90-some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing sounds better than that old 350 Is when she's runnin' up to kiss me when I get home It's been a hard day I tell you darlin' it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs Go and listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek We can take 'er nice and slow A case of beer and a Zebco Let the sun sink good and low There ain't no tellin' where we'll go In the back of that 90-some Chevy In the back of that 90-some Chevy  She's hotter than hell, I'm higher than gas She's sweeter than honey, I'm poor white trash She ain't had a check that I couldn't cash I guess that she's my Carter and I'm her Cash And I've been sittin' around drinkin' on it I guess I'm gonna have to get me a ring and get it on it  That old darlin' of mine is like a 90-some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing sounds better than that old 350 Is when she's runnin' up to kiss me when I get home It's been a hard day I tell you darlin' it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs Go and listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek We can take 'er nice and slow A case of beer and a Zebco Let the sun sink good and low There ain't no tellin' where we'll go In the back of that 90-some Chevy In the back of that 90-some Chevy  That old darlin' of mine is like a 90-some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on

...One string, howling, even the dogs...
This song is fucking amazing. I almost love this one more than Rich Men. Thank you for being you & being an individual. Thank you for singing from the heart & not singing what others tell you to sing. We love you in my household - from Knoxville, TN. ♥️
This is a very sexy song.
At it again Oliver 👏 👏 👏
❤❤❤❤❤❤
My first vehicle was my truck. 98 k1500....body is rusty, but frame is good and she runs like the wind still.....kinda haha. I'm 33 now, got it when I was 17. This song hits me so hard in the feels, it's like it was always inside me but Oliver Anthony pulled it out of my soul so I could meet it. Laughter is the best medicine, tied for first with the one you love riding in the middle of that bench seat cruising up into the mountains to just get away from it all
I just wanted you to know that there are more people out there that see the things you see. Only difference is that I can't sing. To be perfectly honest with you I believe I have had a calling to be a truth warrior for Christ . I just have  a hard time couping with what I've learned and am drowning myself in alcohol . I believe with the thing you've sung about are plenty of proof you are also a truth worrier. The telivagilest system is dead .... They are all heretics. The church is dead. At least 99 percent of them are heretics. I know you don't know who to trust who to follow . Let me assure you that even though I am in the same state as one of your songs that eventually we will find clarity. We were shown what we were shown for a reason and it is our job to convey the truth.
One guitar...and one man...who embraces Family, God, & Country.   Thats country.
Honestly, I'm not a country fan, but I appreciate your lyrics and music. Jesus bless you.
OLIVER ANTHONY 2028 Pencil in ballot. Let's make it happen y'all.!!!
Yes babe I’m addicted to him cause he words are what I’m thinking about you babe 🙏 ❤😇🤔🫣🙀🫶🏼😾🫶🏼🦁🐯

Even though I turn you on you're just way too pretty.
This makes me feel down low. I mean I don't know which way to go! I should know if mom was gone well who's you know. Flying planes and there's no bug repellent I'm like f*** you though

What makes your music so touching is the emotion in your voice. You earned being famous. Glad to see it. 🎉
WOW!!! Brother you sure got sumthin special goin on here. My friend told me to look you up and I was most certainly surprised to hear such a refreshing style your putting out there. Keep it up man. This is music I can relate to.
Glad to see you in Murion... Even better to see you sell out that g-d box factory. I was jamming some rich men when it had 500 views I like to think I'm at least 100k of the millions 😂
I went to Virginia earlier this year and fell in love with the area. I have fallen in love with your music as well. Thank you for sharing. Keep up the good work, brother.

Shame i sold my 90 some dixie custom chevy step side, regular cab, short bed,  to a not-so-rich man, North of Richmond (outside if Baltimore).  ..in a walmart parking lot   I miss that truck a ton😢 She was from the South like me and didnt have the rust that a Maryland truck has.    Many of nights "chilling on dirt roads" alone in that truck after worming like a dog in a plant after returning home from overseas.    Took my old lady out many of times in that ride.    My old Rottie rode shotgun across state lines too, and was the anti theft device when stopped at a truck stop.  Trucks gone, dog passed, still have the old lady..  This song flooded 20+ years through my mind in the few minutes it lasted, and took me back through a journey and brought tears to my eyes.
Made me feel human again
The “load up the dogs” hits me hard, man. My 14yo girl will be put to sleep tomorrow and singing along to your music in the car has made me cope with it. Thank you for this and I wish you all the best in your life. Greetings from a city slickin’ Dutchman that wishes he lived around your neck of the woods.
https://youtu.be/BY9q6Lm0X3Q

Born and raised in south Alabama here, going on 40 years old. Single man, just bought a log cabin on a river down here. Can’t express how much I feel your music brother! If people are honest with themselves, they’ll realize life is about being “simple”. Appreciating the small things, and giving love and kindness where they can. Your music takes me back to simpler times I wish I could return to.
Sounds awesome with the resonator tuned down and playing on the 4th fret!!  ❤️
Preach brother
Bless you Brother and thanks.
You’re bigger than the rich men north.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

You're music is just so authentic, it reminds me of the folks I grew up around in the good days. Not so long ago.

You confused the word Chevy with Harley but I still love your music.
Good ol throttle body trucks not this vortec shit
Man, I live in a camper on two acres in the bush with my woman and the dogs. Every thing this man says is my life, love it. Just this guys soul and morals makes me remember that is ok living like this. Bye bye cruel world, I’m living in Paradice. Thanks for the incredible music my friend. Keep on doing you, it’s what the world needs, authenticity and morals.

Hah.. I don’t always drive my K2500 but when I do I blare this out the radio!!!
I’m crying so hard… his voice and words are like what I believe we all know how America should feel instead of what we’re being told it is.. this is music…
Oliver is a generational talent singing a common message for millions of hard working people.
We knew what we was leaving behind, but we had no idea what we was getting into with Oliver Anthony music!!!! A Legend of our time, and I am ever so thankful to be able to watch him grow!🫡
Sounds like Led Zeppelin, "Your Time is Gonna Come".  What's not to love about that?
Its tied as my favorite song of yours . Thanks for being you
I love you❤
Dont ever let anyone change you. Your music has brought me so much joy and brings me hope for the future. Thank you love. You're amazing. Don't ever change.
It'd be awesome to have your music on a cassette to listen to in my 90 some Chevy.
We thought it was about the King and Queen of America and or Earth, to bad they don't seem to be doing to well, Phoebe & Donald
Love from Australia!
You are very talented
Who else cant stop listening?
Love your down home twangy southern style country singing!! It's pure and relaxing to listen to. Makes me miss living in the south :) I can't wait to hear more of your songs. :)  P.S. You also remind me a lot of my son :) :D He's a redhead but reversed to yours hair coloring... He has the auburn hair and blonder beard :P (Yeah, I'm probably old enough to be your mom also or close to it.. hahaha)
Love your message Oliver. From west cork Ireland 😬
Oliver bro your a legend with your music and raw talent  ❤❤❤
Your music speaks to my broken Heart and soul!!! After loseing my Father!!!! Thank You!!!
Your music is Beautiful and iits helping me withing the passing of my daddy a month ago....that event killed my soul!!! I keep on livein for moms sake!!! thank you oliver Anthony for bringing back to jesus christ!!!!
Never been a fan of country. Grew up in GA and hated the fakeness of popular country. This though is authentic as it gets. I tell you brother I get it and it reminds me of when I grew up. I hear my grandpa from Kentucky playing his 10 string when I hear this, keep it going.
I drive a 96 chevy pickup
Another great song, but that’s not a 90’ something  in the video
Thank you for sharing.
I’m so proud of you Oliver even tho u might not see me just know we are proud of u Man U give us blue collar boys hope

I love this song. I love all of your songs. I want to go home never fails to choke me up. It was sent to me saying it reminded someone of me and it was right on. Feels good knowing I’m not alone.
Is that a 1911?, is the only question that popped into my head while watching!! Lol.
Boy if anybody has ever wrote a damn good song you did it love it
🍻 That old darlin' of mine is like a 90-some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing sounds better than that old 350 Is when she's runnin' up to kiss me when I get home It's been a hard day I tell you darlin' it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs Go and listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek We can take 'er nice and slow A case of beer and a Zebco Let the sun sink good and low There ain't no tellin' where we'll go In the back of that 90-some Chevy In the back of that 90-some Chevy  She's hotter than hell, I'm higher than gas She's sweeter than honey, I'm poor white trash She ain't had a check that I couldn't cash I guess that she's my Carter and I'm her Cash And I've been sittin' around drinkin' on it I guess I'm gonna have to get me a ring and get it on it  That old darlin' of mine is like a 90-some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing sounds better than that old 350 Is when she's runnin' up to kiss me when I get home It's been a hard day I tell you darlin' it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs Go and listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek We can take 'er nice and slow A case of beer and a Zebco Let the sun sink good and low There ain't no tellin' where we'll go In the back of that 90-some Chevy In the back of that 90-some Chevy  That old darlin' of mine is like a 90-some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on

Stop hiding so much !
The more I hear this song the better it gets, I just love it! 👏
i know you aint a big fan of record deals but your music is the kind i'd like to listen to on the way to work every day.  are CDs a possibility? i'd happily take a 'no' if it means you keep on doing you
i don’t typically like country music yet i heard rich men north of richmond and had to hear more. you have a beautiful voice, and you’re so true and genuine which is hard to find now! wish you the best
My everyday is a 97 short bed  Single cab 350. No AC  Start  On the first turn off the key  gets me to work and home 💪🏽

Don't ever stop we love you
I love that you record with your dogs
Wish I could like this twice...
My granddaughter loves this song. She is 9
Nice property. Looks peaceful. I live in the ghetto in philly. I want to retire somewhere like that.

That old darling of mine is like a 90 some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing that sounds better than that old 350 Is when she's running up to kiss me When I get home, it's been a hard day  I tell you, darling, it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs Go and listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek  We can take her nice and slow A case of beer and it's hell cold Let the sun sing, good Lord There ain't no telling where we'll go Back in that 90 some Chevy In the back of that 90 some Chevy  Well, she's hotter than hell, I'm higher than gas She's sweeter than honey, I'm poor white trash She ain't had a check, that I couldn't cash Yes, if she's my Carter, then I'm her Cash And I've been sitting around, and drinking on it I guess I'm gonna have to get me a ring and get it on it  'Cause that old darling of mine is like a 90 some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing that sounds better than that old 350 Is when she's running up to kiss me When I get home, it's been a hard day  I tell you, darling, it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs Go and listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek  We can take her nice and slow A case of beer and it's hell cold Let the sun sing, good Lord There ain't no telling where we'll go In the back of that 90 some Chevy In the back of that 90 some Chevy  That old darling of mine is like a 90 some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on
Wow, man! Your message is awesome! Wishing you would give a concert in Germany! What about an Open Air 24 in Tornesch on 4 ha near Hamburg?
Case of beer and a what?
God loves a country boy and so do I 👏
I LOVE your music! Coming from a Rap and Hip Hop lover.... you're awesome. And super cute! My Internet crush... lol

This song has to be my favorite song much more then north side of Richmond I gotta say this hits
Would be cool sometime when you could come play at tap three bar and grill in woodruff sc small town good bar and food
I grew up on a 96 acre farm and those were the best memories of my life. Now I live in the city and there still isn’t a day I wish I could just go back in time and get lost in the woods on my old farm. Discovering your music has taken me back again in a special way and I thank you. Been a long time since I’ve heard suck genuine music from the soul like you write and perform. Maybe someday I’ll go home and buy our family land back again.
Another one from the heart 🩵😖
Ur music is amazing brother! I respect u, ur story is inspiring
Just keeps getting better and better.   Everyone says , I know....but, that voice is magic.   THank you for sharing with the rest of us.

It's been a long week brother.
I normally just listen to rap. You sir , have changed my taste for music. I truly appreciate you. All 4 songs I listened to have been nothing short of amazing. 🔥
Niesamowity przekaz, przenika do cna. Uściski dla Piesków.  Pozdrawiam z Polski.
You can’t write a bad song can you???
Jesus Christ bless you 💘 🙏 raw talent.

D@MN ~  "LIVIN"<===

🥰
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This guy made me a country fan fasho. Being Chicano and from California we dont really hear this music but damn man it really is a beautiful genre. Keep pushin hermano. We got your back carnal. Mucho respeto 🤘🤘
This song probaly makes every city folk wish they didnt live in one stacked an packed n had a bwck 40 to relax in
Love what you have to say man!!
You got the beer we'll bring the weed.
I swear this is so good. He should make some remixes and add some beats and drums. Still love the original always.
Seldom cold
Huge inspiration. Hunting down my old tunes and will start posting online to hopefully share with the world. It’s amazing what music can do to the soul. 😊
Need a drummer at any time, let me know man. I don't know why but I get emotional when I listen to your music. I'm a rock and roll boy, but the good old country and bluegrass hits me hard.
Thank the Lord brother I love your songs because they tell the story of my life God bless you man
How's it feel to be so popular brother
My favorite song of yours, just resonates man
Just think $ he's missing out on being signed or whatever keeping him from being played on Radio!!he would have billions of new fans.. he definitely means what he says when he says he don't want the 10:00 tour buses ect....
Love you brother lol 90 some chevy and what you driving in the video going down the road a KIA??? WTH BROTHER LOL
my best memories are in my 98 chevy.
thank you <3
Besides you and upchurch I have never wanted to go see someone in concert or a meet and greet. Had tickets to upchurch covid happened ruined it for me. Would have been my first one. But know you may be it. Love the music I honesty hope this is just the beginning. So ready for more.
next please listen to the song by chat pile called "why"  you'd dig!
ur amazing
I went to olive Anthony's concert it was so much fun 😊
I just heard about you/watched my first video of yours 3 hours ago... I haven't stopped listening to you since then. Thank you!!
Keep it coming !!
Wow 👌
God bless you man. You got his flowing your veins.
i had a red 97 chevy silverado as my first truck... and i called her 'old red. that truck was more reliable than most people are
I’m 10 years younger than you and my first truck was a 2007 Silverado. Got a solid girl that this song describes too. Life is good.
Does it say " case of beer and a zebco" or " a case of beer and it's hell cold" ???? I'm dying to know which is correct
His christ-like intention allowed his mind to expand... which allowed his voice to expand through practice. The "soul" in a voice is determined by quality of mind.
You and the Lacs are the bomb and the next LUKE COMBS love it
I love this song
I've been wondering what I've been missing all my life
Sick place
Had to subscribe… I love your voice and songs… My mum would have loved your music… She loved country/blue grass music… I grew up on it ( and John Laws radio talk back… it was an Australian radio station). I stopped listening to country for a long time… it hurt too much, but you woken my heart up to it, even though some of your songs bring tears to my eyes… (yes, I wanna go home had me bawling like a baby🥲) . God Bless and please take care…. We hear you Mate and we support you!
😢
Yes  sir
Best I know I love the music it keeps me rolling and pushing them long hours  every day just when I had enough Oliver Anthony comes rolling out with more lyrics to keep my country ass rollin
His style reminds me of Johnny Cash
Keeping it real man. Praise God!!!
I might be only 12, but I know a faithful soul when I see one. God bless you.❤ I love your music. It’s so relatable. This is real country music.❤❤❤✝️
I🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉⁹
I have never sang a country song in my life until now. Your words speak to my soul. Thank you
"a case of beer and a Zebco" ............................... classic!
Oliver Anthony is the trifecta entertainer!  Sings, plays and writes his own songs!  Keep on being you Chris, we don’t want a hyped-up remodel!  ❤
As someone who works away 6-8 months of the year and only see my family on long weekends. This song hits a little different.
Well thit fit the right one for me
Boy this logic  tha
Hit the nail right on the head.
What’s a Zemco?
Every songs a hit❤
Songs that speak the everyday Joe’s normal life.
I just needed to play this again today feeling low
Thank you Sir!!!
Love all your music prob the best I ever heard
I’ve not been to any of concerts don’t like a lot of people but would love to set around with you and hear you sing but thank you for what your doing for everyone ❤
I swear to god this song makes my panties soaking fucking wet 😂 hubby gonna start blasting this whenever he’s in the mood. It’s your voice btw, he was concerned it was the lyrics (bc I’m a “chevy girl”) but it’s your voice doe 😅
People are mad at this guy for what he’s singing but I agree with he says so many people struggling with different jobs not getting paid enough money to support the family.
La grande différence c'est la sincérité et le ❤
That's beautiful brother. Don't let all this money you will be making change who you are.
Thanks for the memories young man!!  True life of us country folk….and it brings so many memories back just hearing him! Love how he named it ‘90 some, making it relevant to more people. I miss my ‘90 some Chevy. Powder blue and a hella truck.
Amazing! Hello from France.
@Oliveranthonymusic When are you coming down to Tampa???
@anthonyolivermusic when are you going to come to Florida for a show on the beach??? This is E.T. from Tampa
Your music is food for the soul. I grew up in the Aliganies NY's Apppalachins and the SC lowlands, both places where dirt poor people try to make the best life they can. For the past 40 years, I have lived on Long Island your songs make me think of home and Long Island isn't it. Like you my grand parents were depression babies and came from very poor and humble beginnings. They taught us work ethic and to be thankful for what God gives us. God has given you the gift to make people feel through your songs keep them coming!
When you're singing your story, life becomes hunky dory, makes me wax poetic and its all copacetic. :D
Good tune. I can relate
Absolutely love your music, the lyrics hit home. Right back here in the UK 👌
keep twangin good sir, cheers from Ontario Canada
I can't play this enough...thank you Oliver Anthony ...
New favorite
Ay Chris what ya trading on

Love your music, thank you bringing back real country music. Can't wait to see you at Alley Fest. Hopefully I get the chance to meet you.
You have so much soul in you. Literally all 3 songs I've listened to so far have gave me chills
LOVE to hear you sin✌️🇺🇸
I love love love this.  Want to hear some more!
What a beautiful song.
Best vehicule I owned was my 94 chevy.  I outgrew it so had to sell it and get a bigger truck.
I love my 95 blazer and my wife <3 good song man
It's been a hard day 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💯
Can you make a song that says, "2 men can't have babies. So where did the Obama kids come from?" Or something along those lines?
Amen Brother !!!
This song and "I Want To Go Home" should have way more views.
Wow!
Love your music. Keep it up
I drive a 89 Chevy shes the best truck I've ever had her name is midnight Rider I love her
LOVE this song SO MUCH. It hits on a level that cant be explained
10th visit to this song this week. Thanks for the tunes my man!!
Go on Tour with Darius Rucker and Dave Mathews. ❤
World play is her playground
Another masterpiece🙂
Probably my favourite I've heard so far ❤❤❤
I’m very happy to see that you didn’t sell your soul for 8 million dollars. You are worth more and your message is spreading like wildfire. I love hearing cars& trucks as I drive to and from work playing/blasting your songs. I’m in Chicago and I hear your songs all over this place.
Subscribed... man, you are extremely talented
Bless you from a Canadian fan!🇨🇦😀🐾🐾
Boy howdy day's are getting tougher trying to get by. When I break my  old toolbox and sit down and work on my little old pickup truck I just don't think about all the bad things that's going on in this world. Trying to find me some property to buy move out of City limits .get back out in the country. But holy smoke surprise our property has went up that high.
RAW TALENT
I am so in love with this song. Been on repeat for weeks, found it the same day I found rich men north of Richmond. Your music is absolutely beautiful, sounds straight from the soul and I admire you for it. Your voice, your talent. You’re the sound the world needs right now ❤
he should do a sequel to this song talking about how chevrolet became a welfare corporation in the 2000s
I dig it ✌️
I think this song might be my favorite one of his now.
Pretty 😍!!!
Awesome
Wow over a million subs already? Hell yeah son be proud of yourself.  You are breaking the Internet 😁
Keep going
Impressive 👌🏻
This is a rich vs poor story. Whether your party is red or blue has f all to do with it.  Capitalism has FAILED!
Love your music sir !
It's just good music, man. It's a very original take on early 2000's country too. I was never a fan of it but this shit right here is good af.
“case uh beer and a Zebco.” 😇
As the owner of a 98 chevy, and the husband of the most amazing woman ever. I approve this message!
Love your music brother. Don’t ever sell out to the industry so they take your music and message and stain it with their hate of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ
Im higher than gas ⛽😎👌🏾
True country! It's about time we get blessed with a voice who sings real down home country music. God bless you buddy. Your music has truly touched my heart, I pray it does others as well. Your a real blessing to this world right now. God bless you.❤
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydrDhx1448U
God bless this man for giving us the healing gift of his music. Thank you brother
Don't go Hollywood like jelly roll.....keep with the small town girl.
This guy makes higher 100% bangers
This guy is awesome, amazing, real, did i mention AMAZING!
Thank you Anthony! Your faith shines through in every song. Glory to God.
Nice
Sir, you are a treasure. I was yipping and hollering at my iPad to this song. Bravo. 👏🏾
listening to your songs from Ukraine
Can't get enough my friend. Tx
Rich men north of Richmond was a Beacon of unity to all the hard working American men and women that make this great nation function, It struck a nerve in every race and culture in America. Without us there wouldn't be hundreds of billions of our hard earned money to send to Ukraine. We all need to wake up and be willing to fight for the country that gave us the freedom to be so damn lazy we let it get to this point. If we don't we are going to lose it. I'm happy for you bro I really am you earned everything coming your way, I love the idea that One Man can make such a ripple of focus in a society designed to keep us so distracted, I would hate to see such influence go so swiftly in such time of need, We as a country need inspiration. Thanks for giving what you already have. Loving the tunes btw.
Oliver Anthony for PRESIDENT!!!!!
Honestly if you posted 1 video a month like this in the woods it’s all you need Oliver 👍
My husband had a chevy when we met in 97/98
Will you please Ayla to your songs in concert my gosh her and that fiddle
Your amazing brother. Man do it for us! Do it for the real working fucking Americans who don’t have any other way!!!! Love your music!
Thank you !!!!!! A true American !! Keep it coming from your soul brother and we will keep listening !!!!
Sure touches this 68 year old heart, good real American music. Thank you
This is a great song. I constantly have this, Rich Men North of Richmond, and I Want To Go Home on replay. Amazing songs.
Woody Guthrie of this century........watch and see.......
a case of beer and a zebco, I'm dying.
Boy u a genius
Hard to believe how many people were sleeping on this artist.   Voice, check, song writing, check.  Getting ready to blow up!
“A Case Of Beer And A Zen Calling”
Blackmore is the best character on this list but he has the most insane potential and he has a very strong character and is the most underrated player on this team in terms he has a great personality but but he’s also a great defender so he has has the most talent in this league but he’s also not a great defender in this team so I think he’s gonna have a better chance chance at
Criminal’s
BAZZZZZZZZ😂🎉😢😮😊❤
Thank you brother
Glad more good music is being made these days
Thank you true country.

Thank you Brother
I don't normally post to this kind of stuff. However, I felt compelled to write something.. I watched your Joe Rogen interview a little while back, and I was literally touched by the sincere tone of it all. I struggle every day with mental health issues and still haven't found a vent,  even after 63 years.  I hope you continue to shine. At least some of us make it out of this dark hole.
my '96 Corvette makes my day!
album loading???
Great song! 😎

From France, great job, man. I am more blues and soul music. I didn't know a lot country but you made me discovrer it (as you said, we can feel a delta blues influence). Magnificent
This song is so damn good.
Until earlier today I thought those was your best song. But ...if it's God's will. Made my head spin. Can't wait to hear the whole song
The best one
As a blue collar man.. I thank you sir.
Oliver, if you changed me a version from dogs to kids, I will have as my wedding song
His real name is Christopher Anthony Lunsford. Oliver Anthony was his uncle.
Beautiful natural beauty behind you love what you do thinking about the days when the first generation sat around playing music when the whole family got together for the weekend they all played some instruments in that time and boy was it fun
Yo I don't even like country music but this guy's voice is so unique ive become a fan 💕
Stay true brother
Case of beer and a what? Zemco? The only line i dont understand in your words!
I love this song especially the duet with Ayla Schofield.  You two should record this and put it on the radio.
Bud…. Your music…. Hard to explain how it makes me feels when I hear it…. Literal goosebumps from head to toe. Keep doing what your doing…. Keep being real, the world needs it❤
May god be with u all ❤🙏🏼❤🙏🏼❤🙏🏼

TOP #3 for me. Nice sing and string Oliver Lunsford. Keep soulin brother
“Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to Him, “All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me.” Then Jesus said to him, “Away with you, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.’ ”” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭4‬:‭8‬-‭10‬ ‭NKJV‬‬
Please don’t change many things. Beware with whom you shake hands. It’s all about profit.  You deserve reward and money without all the alcohol, drugs and bs coming with it. Keep it simple. Try to resist fame. Praying for you from a little country in Europe called Switzerland. Blessings brother. Peter
Keep it going man. You truly have the talent to keep on writing and putting it out. I can relate to everything you have to say in your music in one way or another. Me and my wife had our 25th wedding anniversary last week and this song is us. Been wantin to send something to you as we have been constantly keeping up with you on here. We live right here at you and live the same lifestyle struggling to work, hunt, garden, can, preserve and do all we can to make it through the year on our own. Maybe when things calm down for you we could get together and talk about it.
I really hope you didn't screw yourself by signing to that label bud . Best wishes to you
You are our voice ❤ thank you so much! Love from Canada 🇨🇦
Youtube tried telling me I couldn't play this in the background!
I am pretty sure the whole world is listening to you..Thank you for standing up ..Canada is listening God bless you ...
This is what I needed this mornin. Thank you sir
Im gonna grow my red beard again 😂
Just saw an article saying you signed a contract curious if that's true congratulations either way hopefully if it's true you won't let them change you because that's their goal usually
Hey! Nice music, man. I`m from Ukraine. world has gone mad! There is a dictatorship in our country. People are grabbed on the street, forced into minibuses and forced into the trenches. 8 of 10 soldiers are dying. And there is nowhere to run, control is everywhere, there is no freedom on this planet left, except internal. Stay strong, brothers!
Thank you 🙏
This is what your fans will show up. Get another channel for the live stuff
Keep singing the truth good stuff man
Oh Hell Yes Son !!!  You are fucking amazing
Love it
When I meet my wife I had just purchased a 93 1500 black Z71 Chevy extended cab. Hearing this song takes me back. We have been married 28 years now and still our love grows stronger each day. Thanks be to God for a wonderful wife and a musician like you Chris to hit on the emotions of so many people. Continue to do what you do and stay true to your heart.
You’re the perfect mix of Tyler Childers and Zach Bryan that I’ve always been looking for
Yea, don’t forget to thank all the conservatives you despise because they blew you up and made you famous while liberal Democrats hate you and are calling you a racist hick
I had a 90gmc two tone tan and brown ❤ now I gotta 96 silvarodo
my brother
Brother we can’t thank you enough.
Can you come have a concert in Edmonton Alberta?
Its everything that I am. Love this song. Wake up thinking about it.
We finally have proof you sold out.  How much did Chevy pay you for this song!  (kidding for those who are jab-damaged and didn't get it)
So I have a question please... None of us want to see Christopher used and abused by the establishment. All of us (apologies for speaking for "all", but i figure thats why we're "all" here), want to support Christopher to continue his journey, hopefully taking us with him. How do we do that, while not ecouraging Christopher to sell his soul? I'd love to purchase an album, some songs - even to simply know that I have purchased the right to - and to know "Oliver Anthony" is paid his dues.. Any one know of a download link available, where he will be paid for his songs, please?
If you ever need a good tour bus driver, just let me know.
this is gorgeous.
Beautiful Song
Dis sum real shit here
You have truly gripped me to your music. True soul in your voice. Thank you 🙏🏾 🤌🏾
Love your music and the fact that you stand on your principles!!! Keep it up man. Your awesome!!!
Mines even a 90s Chevy, 97 be in fact
I listen to this 10 times a day
Bordel cette voix...
i came here because of "Rich Men North of Richmond", discovered you made more music, and fell in love with the truth you speak. its simple, down to earth, and proper like it should be.   i am not a country music enthusiast. i do not listen to country or enjoy it... but your truths are beautiful and you sing of the most important things: simple, small things that really make up the world.   thank you for introducing me to the kind of country that's good and speaks about more than blue jeans, big red trucks, and easy women! keep it up, oliver anthony!  im spreading your name more than "Rich Men North of Richmond," I swear - an artist as good as yourself deserves even more!   keep it easy, brother! <3
love ya brother thanks for sharing you deserve it!
I support you from France, hang in there buddy 😉👍👍
Brother I love your voice don’t ever stop being you I support you all the way
"A case of beer and a Zebco".  Wow---that takes me back to my younger day's, when they were well spent in an old Jon boat on Ky. Lake and Lake Barkley.  Keep bending them strangs Oliver.
Just goes to show that people want simple genuine music and artists. Not this over produced garbage that people call music nowadays. Love this shit man... keep it coming and I will definitely keep listening 🙏
Lovers love to love. Haters love to hate.
Never been a country music guy. I'm a Long Island Yankee at heart, living in South Carolina.This man is God sent. This is what county music should be. Not this commercial generic crap we've been having
Beard Game is strong 😊❤
Brother I  do love your  music
Love this song
Keep up the amazing work.
This is fire
Buffalo NY is here and been since day one keep being you Oliver
I’m 23 and your all I listen to you help me through alot
This guy right here, is rubbing my soul, ❤loving it
My Chevy is an 89 it has a 12 ft bed that never has to be made and it has a cargo light that gives off a romantic glow and yes I am still in these lines from another
Find myself singing this song in my head and out loud all day long
Oliver! Please READ! I am your long lost brother from another mother. I too have been torn apart by alcohol and what the world dishes out. I too live on my own land (Monterey VA) not far from you. I am homesteading all alone like yourself. I am a singer and songwriter on the guitar as well. I am 3 1/2 years sober from alcohol. I love my herb though. I was finally getting back into my music after having to figure out how to play without booze. That's all I did before, was drink and entertain. Well one day not to long after I picked the guitar up again I cut my pinky finger through the knuckle completely. It was barely attached. My worst nightmare finally came true, I've been a carpenter for 28 years and was hungover most of that time and nothing. Instead I do it working for myself building a rain catchment. I have a long road ahead of me before I can play well again.     I really want to meet you. My Name is Amos. I know we have so much in common listening to your songs. I cry every time because the lyrics are the words I've been searching for for so long and there it is, you have done it. You wrote all the songs about all the exact same things I lived through and feel need to be said, Thank You. I am jealous that you beat me to it but I can't be more pleased with every song you have written. Please contact me through here and I'll send you my number. I need to talk to you. Serious as a heart attack. I really hope you see this. Keep it up!
Brought to you by Chevrolet
Reminds me of summer 2010 😎
THIS IS MY FRIDAY ANTHEM!!!!!!!!!! LOVE IT
Good music! Protect your self-righteousness. Take some crash courses on how to do business. People will need you for the long run, don't be a one-hit wonder.
It's nice the hear old school country music making a comeback.
Damn bro keep it up.  Been a bit since i heard something once and it stuck so good
Merci Olivier
Keep on writing songs and compose songs on the NEGATIVE JEALOUS SPIRITS.
Do NOT FEAR of those who kill the body but CANNOT KILL SOUL … FEAR HIM WHO CAN DESTROY BOTH SOUL & BODY in HELL.”
Oliver :  NEVER GIVE-UP,  “DO NOT FEAR.”   those people are jealous, nothing to do the talent you have.
I dub you Golden boy !!! You are my absolute favorite !! ❤❤ love this song as well !! I’ve shared every song on fb
🤍🤍🤍 You are helping to bring our Roots back like many others Upchurch, Struggle Jennings,JellyRoll Adam Calhoun, Nu Breed, Seth Anthony , Brodnax and many more God Bless skin stay true to yourself 🙏🏻💪🏻😎🤍
cant wait to hear you at  the grand ole opry
This is a great song brother! You are really in to something here. Sounds like Hank Jr.
I've this song on repeat on Spotify. Sofar, this's my favorite song of yours. Keep on Truckin
Love all 3 songs ive heard,hits the heart when hearing them
Goodun...
We with you on these brother
GMT400 trucks approve of thid song 👍
Man Oliver you really gave my dad a reason to think country was still alive haha he said he’ll come down and take that focus with the arc tires for a spin with yah , keep it up man your really giving people a reason to think for themselves again !
I would really like to talk to Chris I bet he's pretty cool.
I got to get an e85 carburetor just in case our fuel gets too high and we can't afford to buy it I'll make moonshine to run my truck on
But it's still a good looking truck. Some people who has their hundred thousand dollar trucks think they're junk. But I'm going to keep this truck till the day I die I don't believe it's junk it's my pride and joy and with that 327 in it with the 750 double pumper Holly and another ignition should run pretty good I think I can pull a car trailer with it
I have a 1992 short wide.its red with tinted windows driver door and back window. It has a 350 in it with a 4 barrel quadra jet 5 speed on the floor a building a 327 1969 that came out of a Camaro Z28. The truck needs some cab corners and some rocker panels but I'll take that to the body shop and have them to do that work for me I'm getting too old to do that kind of body work.
A good song is like good memories, you want to go back to them.
Case of beer + a zebco..makes a Kentucky girls heart smile💓
Awesomeness
Wow, real country music, last person I saw do this was billy strings
Thank you for this song
I'm a 52-year-old Canadian metal head that can count on one hand how many country music singers I like, so I gave you my extra thumb.  You make good music
Time for an American revival 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Chris always say true to God and yourself always remember that God is the one that is driving the train that you are on. He's the engine That's driving the you listen to him always. May the Lord bless you and your family always.Quebecca from Alabama.
Never seen a ginger spitting straight facts before
This is one of my favorites.sitting watching the sunset behind the mountains. Getting away from the craziness
God Has blessed this man , to do his work for mankind, a modern-day Johnny Cash.  Beautiful music i thank those that helps him get his message and music out there.  We are living in bad Evil horrible times of Lies and corruption and deception, the Devils works and the Bankers lusts.  May Gods people unite and free our souls...   Thank you, Christopher, Oliver !  and Jesus Christ the first rebel against the establishment and evil wealthy
Damn he is good  and i dont even know it :)
dude your music calms me down so much i literally love listening to your music i love the great work keep it up
God bless you and your beautiful dogs. Thank you for bringing bliss into the lives of so many.
Another banger
From South Africa.....this some real good shit goin down your side son!....luv it
Hey, Oliver, if you think you're angry now, I can't wait until you figure out exactly what quantitative easing (QE) is all about or what I call Equity Spending (ES) which process is in fact God's gift to his man species in these last of the last days which ES process is described as being able to electronically generate we the peoples' $s when there are insufficient funds available from our defunct federal tax revenue system that will never, cannot ever, never be revived? Let's just say that the Fed has very probably charged we the people anywhere from $900 billion to perhaps as much as $5.2 TRILLION in legal service fees for presiding over and or facilitating the ES process which amounts to little more that entering numbers in an electronic ledger.    Let me know and I will explain in more detail.
Be careful Chris, keep the Lord king of your castle and don't let the enemy whisper in your ear.
@oliveranthonymusic your music has hit me in the soul and I need more my friend
84 squarebody suburban for 2k dropped 8k ain't nothing drive like her God bless old school america and the memories I've made so far in her restoration the only way 🙏
I think his music is just so relatable to everybody. And its good shit too. One song hes sitting in front of a ford focus. Lol not some bs lamborghini. He isnt bragging about money or sex. Its straight up relatable. More artists need to do this or lose their careers to people like Chris and if you wanna go hip hop/rap. Then people like Harry Mack. Hes better than any main stream rap or R&B artist out there. Chris is better than the mainstream country singers right now. Hes relatable. Sings with a purpose. I love it! 👍🤙👌💪🍻
You have the most beautiful voice, Chris.  Thank you for sharing your voice and God’s message
Oliver Anthony I must say there is nothing pretentious about you. You are down to earth and comfortable in who you are.
Biden isn't good for this country. No matter what Oliver thinks.
That's you're a pothead
How do you go from sitting on your couch smoking weed all day to the number 2 song in the world
Man oh man! ❤
i dont think youll see this but your music is so truthfull and you live so close id kill to meet you !!!!
Chills through every song 🥶😮‍💨
its like someone describing a delicious meal
Scammers on this vid beware
Ne change rien, continue, grand respect
Félicitations, respect
Don't thank us, we all need to thank you.  Thank you.  God bless you and our our soldiers.
People are sleeping on this one
I think a duet with Roger Alan Wade would be 🔥
I like fords but I get the sentiment. Had to sell my truck. I sure regret that.
Branches in the way
Love you in the back woods there. S. S.
Well we don't like mud, skeeters or sweating.
so pure and relatable, love your music. Such an inspiration to all of us! keep it going my friend and open our souls to the unimaginable...
By far my favorite out of all of your songs.  The writing is just top notch

YOU KNOW HOW TO WRITE TUNES THAT TOUCH THE SOUL... MUCH LOVE FROM GREENSBORO NC
Get it son! Yee Yee! Western NC!
Good Lord.  I mean that.  Mr. Lunsford, I hope you avoid the corporatism, and I love that you are trying to keep costs down for your concert-goers.  But please don''t let them push you out.    You are important, and your message is important, too.    Love you, Bro.  Keep on keepin' on.
Killer track!
staged 100%
Awesome.  We will need to follow "Blind Joe's song soon again. Check it out. "I will NOT comply "
Who ever said you need more than 4 chords to make good music!
Heard Rich men north of Richmond today on the radio!! Congratulations!!!! Keep on keeping on brother!!✊️👊
Chilllssss 🙏. God bless you Oliver
I've been with my Old lady for 6 going on 7 years and two kids , still haven't married her . This song showed me the light to change my.kife with her
Future G.O.A.T
I think this one might be my favorite so far. Been singing the opening all day the past week or so. Hopefully I can find me a darlin like this one day.
Something to be said for his strumming, timing, and lyrics.
For God and REAL country music. ❤
Speaking the truth of poor man. Stay strong brother. We're standing right next to all over this world.
This is great song reminds me of my girl she loves 90s Silverado she rides just right when you turn her on hell ya brother
We ain’t trying to pressure you but we need more music.
You made think where is my old zebco, got that with S and H green stamps in 1973
You made think of my last 12 girl friends , I need a 90 chev bus
Talking about a 90 some chevy like you could figure out if it was tbi or vortec🤣 plus your driving a new chevy in your music video🤔 very questionable bud and no girl sounds better than a wide open 350 if you have that experience....  who knows sorry not sorry.
What is he saying after he says a case of beer and....??
This made me miss my first love and my first truck. Her name was Destany and it was a 95 Silverado. This song described em both perfectly! You kill me man!
Great song
Your doin something amazing man, keep on keepin on
My dad has a 92 350 this hits home
Only thing i hate about this song is i didn't write it for my darlin. Preach it!!!!
Man oh man keep  singing brother 💰
Beautiful Soul. Beautiful Guitar. Beautiful Music. Beautiful Landscape. Beautiful Nature. Beautiful Song.
This man sounds like ah man , love your music.

I pray you stay true to yourself and don't sell yourself the to the Evil Music Industries!!! As is seen you are everywhere with the Lords message!!! He sent you in a major time of need.
You are inspiring.  Kepp it up.
👍🏽🙏🏽❤️‍🩹
It's not just the sound its the lyrics you sing..like none other

#Art

Why you so good.
Bout time we got some good music! I can’t stand listing to the radio. Half the songs on the radio shouldn’t be!
This song is pure gold
I remember playing in the woods in Beckley WV. My grandfather  had a moonshine still  the bloodhounds could always get me to the sill and back home..thank you  for your music
Is there a story behind that guitar because it is definitely pretty and tuned special
That made me laugh. What a sweet song.
That song Rich man of north is a good song
Case of beer and a zebco

At least this didn’t make me cry
Simply amazing😊
Is that a 1911?
Just don’t forget where you came from 🤍🦋
Hey Anthony. I'm sure you're never going to read this but I would love to hear your version of House of the Rising Sun. Just a thought.
Everybody that's been singing/rapping "country" music for the past 15 years is gonna panic and start TRYING to copy you.
Sir you've jumped to the top of my list real quick, I never thought o'l tyler childers would have a runner up on my list, but damn it o'l boy keep it up
Im now in love with country music, first time...
Thanks! Doggone it is great as well as I want to go home.
What a voice.
Sooo awesome
Dam that awesome music bud 🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍
Sellout.. your one song was all we needed
You are rare one Oliver i wish there was more of in the world today!!!!!
One more song and then off to bed. I hear you.
I love how it’s a GMC in the video. 😂
Probably my all time favorite artist.
When will this version be on Apple Music?
You are awesome! I truly enjoy your  music. Keep it up man!
Keep on rockin that ol dobro like good old tg
All it took was a friend and a good mic. And your dogs and your voice.  Brother im not saying nothing but ur voice and heart u put into ur songs is really good. Hank . Vince.  willie. U got a voice u dont have to ask who sings this song because they will all know
You are genuinely the GOAT!!
“She’s my Carter, I’m her Cash” ❤❤❤
My SIL has a 98 Chevy and her and her husband load up their hound dog Red and go fishing… they LOVE THIS SONG… I do too, I glad I found it!
If I could "like" it twice... I would.
I knew you were a gm man! "Ole small block anthony" they call him.
His songs make you think just like the group poor man's poison
Thank you sir. Glad this singing and starting up music has deep meaning especially thinking about your grandfather (saw the Rogan episode) there's so much lost talent everywhere, you had the balls to start it up, & also learning from these poor folks getting involved with the industry and seeing how that can reak havock and choosing not to go the route I respect 100% , If you haven't checked out Aaron Lewis yet , he sings about some similar topics... He was that singer from Staind but then started his own thing up... Love em'. Anyway thanks again , always stay true , temptations will always be there but working harder to preserve your soul takes effort especially when you're vulnerable and can make other greedy people money. God bless
one of favs out todays much luv brother from the uk keep bringing songs big man
love me a good 1911
Love it. A man that gives us inspiration. God bless him.
Oliver just an average Canadian citizen here. Love your heart,voice and music. Don’t let the buggers  get you down..keep on keeping on being you, stay focused on the Good Book you so faithfully carry..🙏🏻🙏🏻
I hate country. But I love this. This is just straight pain and love, honest from the heart. Chis " Oliver Anthony" is chanelling something deep.
Case of beer and a Zebco is what I thought 🤣
Okay, nuther #1 hit right ther I'll tell you what.
The Oliver Anthony just cranking out some hits like a mudder fudder lol. Another awesome song man 💪🦅🤘
What a fantastic song
This guy is about as real as those people who did J6...
I used to have a field of grain behind my house when I lived in rural Illinois not too long ago. When I listen to Oliver/Christopher’s voice, all I see is the wind through that field of grain. So pure.
I really love the line "She's my Carter and I'm her Cash"--- my husband LOOOVES Johnny Cash and I used to really reject country music, after 15 years of him listening to it I'm all in and am loving it. He's definitely my Cash!
Makes Me feel Good that I got A 96 Chevy! If that Truck could talk it would tell on me!
On repeat
Damn Man ! You're a Breath Of Real America :-D .....  So Thank You for the Fresh Air !!!!
Noice!!!
I absolutely love how your music is “just you” no BS audio enhancers.❤❤
Bro! You are the real deal. Release more music please x
Bro! You are the real deal. Release more music please x
This is awesome. I deleted my tiktok brother, but I'm following you on here. This #AngryAsian can't wait to see you in Knoxville.
Your story time with the Bible every time is annoying. How about just singing your music, not all us care about your religion, especially the way you push it. Just like the left pushes their garbage.
This is nothing but the truth
You need to come out t Australia for the world famous country music festival
Glad you're a Chevy guy as well a am anti both sides of government. ❤
From a technical standpoint the video, production and music is just spot on. It's all genuine. It is hard work in the making and insane amount of effort of making it just right. The production of this is way too precise.   Country music found Oliver Anthony. Real good well written music. I can't thank this guy enough. He gave me hope once more.
Oliver has become my favorite! Lyrics from his songs hit home to millions of us, and exactly how we feel. KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING, and DON'T CHANGE OLIVER! 👍🏻✌🏻❤️
“She’s my Carter and I’m her Cash” LOVE IT!!
This man is who i had hoped Tyler Childers was going to be. Not knocking Tyler's music at all. Its great, but man this guy makes music that absolutely speaks to my fucking soul. God bless, stay greate Chris!
Can you make a good song that doesn't absolutely pull at every feeling I have. Love to listen without the emotional roller-coaster lol. My wife worried about me😂
🔥🔥🔥
My favorite one yet
Hats off to you my man, Much love from Australia 🇦🇺   Campfires and Holden utes have become a humble place here with your music blasting loud and proud
Sound a the people 🤘🤘
My first truck was a 91 chevy wish i still had it.
Crazy thing I heard you from a spider video lol
You're gonna make it big brother. Love from PA!!
Can you please re-record cobwebs and cocaine. Best one yet!!!!
spitting Barz #djbiginf
Grew up in chevys only thing I’ll buy brother and with 3 kids and and a beautiful family this song hits another level brother listening to you from Greeneville Tennessee plz do a show here my kids family myself would love to hear it and would be willing to pay for you to come here for my daughters birthday or he’ll anytime lol thanks for the songs and times brother cheers
Brilliant!

You’re a fuckin animal man and I mean that please keep it up your music is so amazing and it makes so many others think outside the box! Congrats on your success brother!🤙🏼
I love your songs so much thank you for stepping into our lives
We all thank you hopefully you keep pushing and maybe one day we can all be HOME FOR REAL
Man I've never been a country music guy.. I've found some songs I don't mind listening to which some were even covers of older songs. But when this guy sings "Its been a hard day.. I'll tell you darlin' it's been a long week.. Might have load up the dogs go'an listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek" that along with the picking and tones chosen just makes me feel some sort of sensation of relaxation. He really nails this song almost if not more than Rich men north of Richmond.
I got me one them Darlins! Great song
John Lakeman sounds amazing!
❤
Your Awesome Bud Love your Music!!! Keep on Keeping On!!!😎🏹❤️🇺🇸👊🏻
This song is so WOKE, it's like the WOKIEST WOKE song that a bloke can sing as if Oliver Anthony was saying; "In your face Republicans."
So glad this man is finally getting noticed
Solid!!!!!!!
Thank you Chris for beautiful music
Very clever, exquisitely crafted lyrics
OMG! I cried listening to RM N of RM....  I immediately shared it with my whole family on a family text thread...   Thank you; thank you; thank you!!  Your songs are clearly divinely inspired for sure.  Thanks for making the world a better place place because you are in it.  TRULY.  That must be mind-blowing for you!!!  I love your dogs too, by the way! ❤
Keep singing brother, keep singing!
Love this some
This guy has the rawest, most authentic voice.
My favorite one
Pretty sure this guy isnt capeable of making poor or average music😂😂..awsome❤💪
I need a cd from you now to listen at while at work ;)
Heard this on a Facebook short.. hit the comments to find the song and all the comments were about it. I'll be checking out everything, awesome song
Ur like the up to date randy Travis   this is some drinking shit here
Put kid Rock in a remix and Hank Junior with this song at it's going to blow up the country chart's. Best of luck to you Oliver
This guy makes the kinda music u can just sit around the fire and drink all night too, no talking, just drink and listen
Its time we act on this. It is literally our duty as Americans to put down tyranny, by force if necessary. Its becoming necessary every day and everytime they pass bills that line their pockets with our money.
Great video 👍😎👍.
Love this one brother
Oliver was never into this type a country more like or less like  Florida ga line or Jason Al dean or hank Williams but man lemme tell ya you have changed me man someone who understands man all of love
THIS is what you call a generational artist.  I pray that we have Oliver for another 50 years at least.
I hope the cover of the album is the guitar from 'I got to get sober'.  Artistry to the max.
Soon as heard his voice I thought is this Johnny cash woah god gifted him with the voice from heaven absolutely pouring every drop of blood sweat and tears into his music so glad I found this thanks to dax and now I’m a fan 🔥
Honestly i think this is my favourite song by you so far, love it man
Keep it up please.......................................................God bless..............................
I guess that she's my Carter and I'm her Cash. Oh yeah.
Keep writing and singing these songs for all of us poor bastards who live south of Richmond, west of New York City, and east of Los Angeles.....
Classic
What does everyone think he says after he says got a case of beer and a what?
Damn, it is been a hard ass day brother... Keep on keepin' on!
As a black guy . I approve this song 🔥
Son of a bitch...Dont drink and listen to this man. He will bring it out your eyes. God bless this man Chris. Keep it real brother, dont take the leash.
We the people of pain need you bro! Straight up 100% thanks for your songs.. im floored...i want to go home.. ripped my heart...i am ready to. So tired of this nasty rich mans world...and we all fuss and fight. Tired!
Finally an artist that puts heart into his music.   Oliver you are what this world needs.  All of your songs that I have heard are truly amazing.  Can't wait until you do a show in Minnesota.
Honest...full of soul and AUTHENTICITY...Its been a while since we heard real music!  I just LOVE IT❤
Praying for you Chris!  Love your music. It seems so genuine.  Keep your head, your soul, and sobriety. ❤🙏🏼
Shes my Carter and im her cash. Man, music hasnt sounded this good in decades. I drive a 98 1500 w a 350 and this song hits just right. All of your songs hit right. Keep your music real and dont let the money change your sound. This reality music is relatable as hell.
This song is one of my all time favorites.. Love your music keep up the good work and stay true
Can y'all help me out with a couple questions? Right after the lyrics "case of beer and a" I can't understand what he says. My other question is I don't understand the reference to Carter and Cash. Your indulgence of my curiosity will be most graciously appreciated.
Keep it up. Our souls need it man.
Played bluegrass with and old friend of mine who passed he sounded like this style and i would love to play with him again so oliver music if yall wanna jam let me know
This dude brings tears to my 63 yr old eyes.... Dammit son keep on truckin!
Love your voice ❤
Love youuuuuuuu Chevrolet gang yee yee!
When you sing it reminds me of my papa… WV born and raised miners and welders  (as most of my family until they moved to Ohio) Died from cancer after years of welding sitting on asbestos. He has been gone almost 20 years… I feel like he is here when I listen to you. He loved Bluegrass and country… please keep it up. You speak and are uniting so many of us. ❤
What I would give to listen to this man play live around a campfire with some good ole boys and beer. Whew, Oliver keep going brother!
Wait... he's talking about a truck, right?
Your music brings tears to my eyes. You are doing it right, sir. I may drive a '94 K1500 with a beautiful dog and lady, but you have a voice that would reach anyone who doesn't love 10MPGs, too.
Mate fucking beautiful
4 songs in now an quickly falling in love with this music keep the faith brother and keep doing what you are doing iv only heard- rich men… , I wanna go home ,wanna get sober and this fucking amazing work
keep going man! people are starving for the real music from a real human!
Oliver Anthony Music you have the Elvis affect on the common man and woman. You simply have the best voice I've ever heard sing in my 50 years of being in a musicians family. Skipped me. But DDDDAAAAYYYYUUUUMMMM
Knew there was a reason I like you so much, best goddamn trucks ever built!
This one’s my favorite so far. Maybe I’m just partial because my 88 Chevy.
New favourite 🤩
This one is a masterpiece. Great feel... Just a country boy's love song. Great job
She can take the 90 chevy, the house, the guitar but ain't no way she is taking the dogs or the frogs
Still have a 91 Chevy Silverado. I wouldn't trade it for any of the new junk "Technology" Chevy pickups....or the 80k+ they want for them. Keep asking for those 47% pay raises UAW, I'm sure it won't affect a thing for people to buy them.
Chris (Oliver Anthony): Doing what he does best 90 some Chevy values: Lets skyrocket and  go even higher in value now
My family loves old chevys. I have an 84, one of my brothers has a 83 and pa has an 94 and a 95.
I cant decide which song is my favorite,  so im just gonna love them all!!
Somehow his voice just happens to touch every one
My friend you came to at the rt time you're waking so many people in how screwed up this world is.. keep em coming and by dang we will turn it around.. oh own you're own music don't let em get they're grubby greedy fingers on it. Thanks again
Sell out
No brother, we cannot thank you for the semblance of normalcy you have brought back to humanity.
Few people know the beauty of a ninety some Chevy....
Git r done son!
love it!!!
This is the BEST SHIT I have heard in a lonnnnnnnng time!  Thank you sir!
Another one!
Thank you for sharing the gift of your music. I pray that you can help unite this country. You seem to speak from the heart. You embrace the Bible, one of my weak points. Please speak truth to power. We need a voice like yours. Stay grounded. seek help when you need it. May God bless you. Stay true. Much love for all you do.
God created us. We came from Adam and Eve. They were given choice and decided to ignore God's warning. They disobeyed. They were removed from paradise and were fallen. We have the same nature as them when we are born as humans. Unless we are born again. The only way to be born again is to trust in what Jesus did on our behalf, facing God's wrath which we deserved to face even though He lived a sinless life, even to death. Forgiveness of sins is only found in Jesus's name. He then rose again from the grave and is seated at the right hand of the Father until He returns. He was born of a Virgin and fulfilled prophecies about the Messiah handed and conveyed to us by prophets and those influenced by the Holy Spirit. If we are born again, we are sealed by the Holy Spirit and being sanctified until Jesus returns. The Holy Spirit gives us a desire to honor God, He convicts us of sin and helps us to become more like Jesus.  Works are evidence of the state of our faith and whether or not our faith is in the right thing. (For example... our works will show when we trust in our own works/obedience rather than trusting in Jesus and our faith leading to delighting in obedience. For example... believing we are set free to sin will lead to no fruit being produced. Both of these things are going to show fruit of dead faith.) Good works are not our response to God's grace. They are what God's grace causes in us when He gives us a new heart and the Holy Spirit.
So nice to hear some real country that will pull on them heart strings
Thank you for all the great music this country has been desperately needing, you have a fan for life here brother, keep speaking the good word and singing great music 🍻🇺🇲🍻 from your average hard working American!!
That was awesome!
You and Chris Stapleton together 🙏.  Keep doing what makes you heavy. Love ya man.
I am absolutely glad I found this gentleman. His voice and music takes back to Uncle Willy and family playing and singing. May you have many blessing come your way
Very refreshing! Country music these days is mostly pop music with an accent and some guitar strings.
Jesus Christ can this guy sing!! We need more people like you in this world! Not just for the music, but for the message.
Another great song.
This screams Shenandoah Valley and I'm here for it!
THIS HERE IS A REAL, TRUE AND FOR SURE STORY TELLER... OWNER OF A SPECIAL TRUTH ..
Love your voice, love your songs, love your message.
my soul screams what you are singing.
What is the lyric towards the end of the first verse: "We can take it nice and slow, a case of beer and a _______"?
Wow👍🏻
Another legend in the making stay humbumy friend
I switched to ford recently, but other than that...Peace, Love!!
The Blue Collar anthem 🤘 better be the next song
Bumpin your music here in the UK 🇬🇧🎶👌
we need to get this guy into top 5 trending for music good camping music for sure!
❤ please don't let the fame coming your way change you. Stay "down to earth". Much love!❤
Love your voice, it reminds me of the early country singers
The white duck tent in the background is perfect.
This guy is nation treasure. Wait that is poetically incorreect he is a world wide treasure. Should be protected at all cost
Thank you for being genuine. Thank you for not selling out to main stream.  Thank you for all the bangers you share with us.
Na man do some research bout Chevy/GM with north fox Island.
Our generation 1:21  hank William Jr
Remember that your pups are the best friends you could ever have. Don't forget about them with all your new found fame.
You do positiv  change 💖💖💖🤗🤗🤗
You are a lightworker a beacon for  those  who  struggles you are chosen 💖💖💖
I tear-up everytime I listen to you sing your songs. Thanks 🙂
Some real country music ❤
❤
I can’t stop listening to this. I would love a full band version. I keep thinking of different bands that could make masterpieces. Black Crowes?
About time good old country boy
The rich doest care about the poor
Love this simple ole hardworking, and AMAZINGLY SO TALENTED, SONGWRITER, performer in all around good guy! 💯❤️🤟
I wonder how many people listening to this know what a "zebco" is.  🙂
Theres a lot of high school girls, I used to know that will have good memories of my old Chevy,, And I hope they all have good lives!
Sometimes you just afirter give it a go
I'm new into county. What is a zelcone? I think that's what he's saying Zelcone?  "A case of bear and a Zelcone?" I dont know what that is and I couldn't find anything on google lol
Them hollers got more acoustic sound than a studio could ever think about having. I don't know if you can hear from one holler to another but damn what it must be like to be a neighbor. Definitely not saying you live in a holler in a bad way. Place of refuge
Oliver I have an idea for a song, "little mama at bottom, nice looking bottom, thats how they gottem, but they think she trash today, hey, it's they mistake, she was a keeper "hit me up if You dig🤙
Love This Song as Well As Rich Men North Of Richmond..There is something spectacular about your music..You feel it..It makes sense to us and hits home..My Husband and I Had A 1999 Chevy Z71 4x4..We had so much fun in that truck..He passed away 5 years ago..So this song really hits home for me..Thank You ❤
Chord progression? Would love to play this on the back porch
Love this song!!
Thank god, this music still exists 🙏
You make me want a Gresch Guitar mf Oliver
Fire!!!
There’s so much SOUL he puts in his songs it’s amazing. There’s so much SOUL he puts in his songs it’s amazing.
Thanks
this is the perfect definition of country music, reglardless of genre. and I absolutely love it. I've always been a johnny cash fan and few others, but most modern country doesn't sway me. This does.
Not immediately a fan of this song, but the video composition is great. Would love to see some of your other songs redone like this.
I absolutely love your voice.❤❤
Genuinous and authenticity are two things we do not see enough of today.  Thank you for being your true self for the world.  You allowed us to remember how we once told stories and shared our experiences.  I love harmonizing to your music, it is so therapeutic to allow some soul wailing in your tunes.
Thank you Chris. You are handling yourself so well and we just love the songs. May the good Lord continue to guide and bless you.
Awesome song, you are a bad ass!
Anyone else like the raw versions of his songs better? Nothing wrong with these either tho!
Sitting on the porch looking at my wife n kids n my ole chevy in driveway , song top notch
Thank you for keeping country alive. I had really just about given up, all the pop crap choking off the real country.
That’s the one fella. That’s quite a tune. I hope to jam around a fire with you one day. Keep at it bud
You hit home. I'm in newfoundland,  about as far east in north America as you can get and all your music still hits close to home if that makes any sense.
Go back and make sure you're still subscribed. I got unsubscribed somehow.
Love this song!!!! Side note. Would love to see your "Old Soul" shirt with the logo from your web site on the front of the shirt. That, is a winner Sir!!   Stay true, To YOU!
It's great song writing. You could talk about fucking a goat and it would work
One brief view  of a pistol  causes panic! Love you brother ❤️
I’ve always loved country, and this new “movement” I guess, is everything I’ve been waiting for. I always I forget how amazing country music is. Its because it’s real. It’s real.
Had a 91 and a 95 Chevy pickup can’t be beat
Please Cover David Alan Coe’s “I still sing the old songs”. It’s your type of song to do some singing on. The most beautiful song he wrote in my opinion.
I'm glad this dude isn't just a one hit wonder. Oliver Anthony is trying to bring this world back together. Keep being yourself.
Love it!
Great tune, keep em coming! I just left the Eastern shore of Virginia, every time I cross the Chesapeake bridge, I know I'm in heaven. I'm back home in Texas and its great too.
Beautiful voice! 🌻
Can’t stop listening to this song. You know you have a real talent when you can take a simple song with just a singer and one instrument and capture a feeling perfectly.
Man....ur taking over the Internet this is real country music ❤❤
Love your old country music. Don’t let the nay sayers get you down hang onto that good word bible you’ve got 🙏🏻4U🙏🏻
Awesome  love this..🎶🎶🎶🎶 thank you for sharing your heart❤ thru 🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
this is the music that makes be proud to be from the south
Great song. I can relate.👍🇺🇲✊
I've been wanting to write my own music so bad. You and Jelly Roll both make want to sing country music. I just don't know how to write a song honestly. Anyways just know you inspire me by how great you are at it. Keep doing it please 🙏 have a good one bubba.
oh man this just hits
Good lord boy she could zelda phone.
I’ll tell you what, I’ve been a Jersey born metal head all my life, but holy shit I love this guy!
OBS Life❤
Damn dude. This brought me to tears. Just incredible.  Your music touches souls. Sure does mine. 🤍
Real men drive bowties. Hell yeah🤟💯
You have captured my thoughts and feelings in your music and I appreciate the hell out of you
“Higher than gas” is a CRAZY bar!
The pull on the low E (though im pretty sure its tuned down to a D here) is such a wonderful and subtle touch everywhere you do it. You are incredible at every aspect of song writing.
his next best dong . Love it.
Humanism above liberalism and conservatism. Love your family, your neighbors, and your God, if you have one. Basic human decency and kindness MUST prevail, or we face a dark path ahead.
I just saw something about you touring with Aldean and Kid Rock...PLEASE don't sully your good name hanging out with those alphabet agents. LOVE ME A GMT400 BTW...🙏😎🍀⚡️
A slave to the world... thank you for your contribution.... .  . . . . . .   .   .  .               .            .              .                  .                                  .                          .
Damn dude, that hits hard!
perfect example of a sigma walking among the masses
keep living that dream this is your time
I wonder what it's like to get home from work and have someone who loves me running up to kiss me. I'm in my fifties now, so I'll probably die before ever finding out.
I totally truly love this song.  But the next one has to be " that ol' square body " please write it ‼💯🇺🇸
Shout out to all of us who drove them to high school  back in the day!!! God bless.
This is driving music!
You are the voice of working class America
Your music touches souls brother. Keep doing what you doing from all the way in South Africa.   Remember we never know what God has got installed for us in our lives and he promises greatness with hardworking and dedication my brother keep doing what you doing.
‘I guess she’s my Carter and I’m her Cash!’ Awwww….if you know you know…☺️☺️
Your whole Chanel turned right side up, content, videography, everything! Happy to see you succeed! Would be dope if we could see you perform with Zach Bryan
Heart beat of America. Says something when this hood ole country boy drives them Chevys
8 years ago i put a ring on it....we had 10 years before that.....now im 46 with  a 5 year old and  a 1 year old.......2 boys....youve made my life.....this ones for you sweetheart.......
I have the dogs, I'm a Tower climber so my days are busy. Unfortunately I cannot have kids so it kind of distracts women from me trying to get to know them. There us about 16,000 of us worldwide. The song resonates. As I have an old Chevy and she's my old ball and chains.
I'm just waiting to hear this in a Chevy commercial
She's hotter than hell  I'm higher than gas She's sweeter than honey I'm poor white trash  You make good music, glad you got some recognition
This is your radio hit - Nice tune brother!
Sounds awesome!! How you put your music out cutting out all the control leeches like corporates and record labels etc is awesome!!  Keep putting it out avoiding all the "typical" ways. Thanks!
Thank you Oliver Anthony Respect I'm 64 years old you're in my music Bible everyday God bless keep up the great work young man Respect Amen 💯🌍🇺🇲❤️🙏✌️
we need to defund the rich men north of richmond .....
350 was the best engine ever made the 5.3  is a 327 and that's all I'm going to say.
This has got to be the best song he has ever written!!  Share, like, what ever gets this song out there !
@oliveranthonymusic  Thank you for bringing us back to OUR UPBRINGING
You sound as good as any George Jones or Merle Haggard song I have ever heard!  I just love you
Love You music,you have the good words that people need to know
Baby making song. Love it.
Rich Men North of Richmond is phenomenal, but my god I’ve been hooked on this song. 🖤
Not a country music fan, but I can get behind Chris' music. Simple, heartfelt and memorable.
Love this song!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You got support from California
This sounds so good. Like hot butter my brother!! Love it! I also emailed you about coming to my small town to do a show!!
This song shows true, sir your not a flash in the pan. You have a god given talent. Love, love your voice and your songs are written with depth. Keep it coming my friend.
I don't care what this man's politics are, or even that he's a Chevy guy and I'm a Ford guy. He's an amazing artist and those that liked or hated him because of politics can fuck off. He belongs on country radio. This man could bring people together if given the chance.
It’s the true country boy coming out of him. Great SOUTHERN SOUL.😃
This shits fire!  Oliver please come to Tucson!  We need you!   Ring that Zebco and we catch some!  You been killing me for 4 weeks!
I would love to know where we can purchase your music!   We needed an amazing blues artist to remind us of what music really is. Thank God he sent us you!
You're the new Johnny Cash Chris.   Wish you the best, keep on with what your doing. Never sale out on a record deal.   You will be OK. You have millions of fans.
Keep your Sniper, the TBI is fine with me.
Just damnnnn I'm in awe...
KILLER SONG…straight 🔥
Turns down 8 million contract to speak his soul
Our generation is coming out swinging man. And they say we aint.
Belta
Good one old pal.
You nailed it Michael. Listen to the message from the artist and how they deliver it. It's all in the feels.
Awesome!
KEEP THEM COMING 🤠🥰🙌🔥
I love everything you're doing, Buddy. Thank you.
Thank you for putting out true music. Thankyou for being able to share the message we all want to. Thank you.
Sir, I saw that you stated something along the lines of you’re not a great singer or guitar player, or something like that.  May I just say, the imperfections in your voice, make these songs you write and sing, absolute PERFECTION!   You are a gift to all of us, and I am so grateful for the fact that I get to experience you and your amazing abilities as it happens!
Thank you very much for existing Oliver 🙏🙏🙏
That was 🔥
Chris the biggest thing you could do now. Is to get anointed too a pasture or a bishop and build your church. And share more of your un censored views to the rest of the world………Period. Plus still post your sermons and music on YouTube.
Love it. Thank you. Looking forward to seeing you in Louisville✌🏻
You're right to turn down those 8 million dollar contracts because they would've changed your sound. I could listen to your voice and guitar all day. True, raw talent.
Hey Oliver I love that lyric case of beer and a zebco
87 mustang 331 stroker. 🤣🤣
That's a hit son
Love those Piedmont tunes!!
Yee
Been a yankee metalhead most of my life. I can't get enough of this guy. After a few minutes he's done performing his song, but I'm not done listening. I play all his songs on repeat all day at work. I can't believe I'm a country fan now but I am.
Rides just right when u turn her on! Amen brother!
I bet that Gretsch resonator has been put into overtime production at their factories man you probably deserve a hell of an endorsement 😂. I pick that thing up everytime im at guitar center always wanted but even 400 bucks is a lot to me unfortunately.
Your voice is inspiring ✨️ 🙌
Cant get enough of your music.  Just so good for the soul and heart.
Dude , I feel you ❤
Im poor white trash hit me hard
My favorite ❤
My favorite ❤
Free man… that’s an awesome concept
Damn good tune bud
“Only thing sound better than that 350 is when she’s wining up to kiss me.”
Between him and Zach Bryan I’ll be set for a while!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing this guy!
I Love that you play these words and tunes.  It sounds like a revision of gospel the misery of life and hardship is there.  Let’s also help our fellow man feel the hope and salvation of a good old gospel tune.  Oh happy day, just a closer walk with thee, many others.  I don’t know how.  But i bet you could. An old guy in southern oregon

"Before everything blew up" . It is no mistake my man  I heard you on the radio and loved your song. Just got a few lyrics and googled them to find you.. ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤

Amazing voice ❤
God I love your m😮sic n unique sound. And I mean Every freakin song dude😊
i have to say i love the music and the beard
That old darlin' of mine is like a 90-some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing sounds better than that old 350 Is when she's runnin' up to kiss me when I get home It's been a hard day I tell you darlin' it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs Go and listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek We can take 'er nice and slow A case of beer and a Zebco Let the sun sink good and low There ain't no tellin' where we'll go In the back of that 90-some Chevy In the back of that 90-some Chevy  She's hotter than hell, I'm higher than gas She's sweeter than honey, I'm poor white trash She ain't had a check that I couldn't cash I guess that she's my Carter and I'm her Cash And I've been sittin' around drinkin' on it I guess I'm gonna have to get me a ring and get it on it  That old darlin' of mine is like a 90-some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing sounds better than that old 350 Is when she's runnin' up to kiss me when I get home It's been a hard day I tell you darlin' it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs Go and listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek We can take 'er nice and slow A case of beer and a Zebco Let the sun sink good and low There ain't no tellin' where we'll go In the back of that 90-some Chevy In the back of that 90-some Chevy  That old darlin' of mine is like a 90-some Chevy She rides just right when you turn her on
Are blacks welcomed to this party or nah? Lmk before I get into my 90 something Chevy y'all....
The fact the doja cat can come out with a song called demons and we allow that on our radio and let our kids listen to it but we won't allow the truth come out and let his music be played. It's INSANE! I'd much rather have my kids listen to this than that
This deserves to be on the radio and in main media! They won't let rich men north of richmond go on the radio because they don't want it there because it speaks the truth
He's not a one-hit wonder that's for sure!
Another great song.
**YES BEAUTIFUL**
Damn, this is a GREAT song!
Please don't sell out to Transplants in Nashville
Better music here!
Your writing is spectacular!!!Absolutely takes  my breathe away. Special gift from God❤
You and Travis Tritt my friend 🔥🔥🔥
Thanks Chris
Im from Germany and i Love that Guy. In Bad and Grey Days Hes bringing light in my life! Hes catching my Soul and i think Hes so insane. He knows how 80% of us are Feeling. Thanks for youre Music. May god Bless you
Oliver now you need to do a song with CREEK SQUAD!!! BE A BANGER! You and Upchurch 🔥🔥🔥🔥 like for him to see please!!
Great last lyric
Great song
351 is just better my good sir
Good music right there!
Id pay good money to hear him and Chris Stapleton to sit down and sing together
The acoustics there are amazing
I’m no biologist, but I reckon this 69 Mach 1 sounds at least a tiny bit better than some 350 kid’s toy. Hmm . Too bad the law quit ignoring all the drag racing (between stoplights at the speed limit) & loitering in Kanawha City’s parking lots that allegedly went on the 80s. It was a wild time to be alive.   What now, punk? Wanna race?   ✌️
1 Corinthians 15:1-4
Wow…. This song is pure perfection. I can literally close my eyes and picture everything you’re saying. You’re so talented! Amazing.❤
My favorite song of yours
I been thinking about this for a while. As of right now, I am of the opinion that your music is some of the best music I have ever heard.  I hope you don't allow the industry to taint what you've got going on, and I hope you do keep writing for years to come.
You've inspired me to keep tryin' this YouTube thing. Thanks, man!
Yeah just keep on keeping!! 👍🍻
I hope you're doing okay considering everything that's going on right now.
Been driving my white 96 Silverado for decades. Beat to shit, AC been dead for years (I live in the hot ass Deep South) - still driving that bad boy till the wheels fall off.  Taken me to many a badass concert - Mike and the Moonpies, 49 Winchester, Joshua Ray Walker, Whitey Morgan and the 78’s, Charley Crockett, Ian Noe, George Porter Jr., Argo McKinley, Charles Wesley Godwin, Rush, etc.
All ya need now is a beautiful child the two of you can strap into that Chevy for some weekend adventure. <3
Please don't get corrupted. Raw untapped Talent is the best. I can name countless musicians that have been overproduced. Really turned away or screwed from the Raw Talent that they(you) absolutely possess. It is a gift. Please continue to cherish it.
I really like your voice, so soulful.
His songs are just honest and real. Damn I love his music.
Aman
Go on tour with @frankfostermusic please! Hes amazing like you and hes independent!
My brother My Brother you have converted me to country music, your lyrics hit hard.  Something about your voice brings a tear to my eye, a good tear, love it.
immediately one of my favorite songs
Can I come do live sound for you on tour?
SOUND GOOD OLD BOY.
A great song. I love your voice. I can feel the emotions, it brings a tear to my eye every time.
90 fine!!!! Chevy
That whole darlin’ of mine is like some 90 fone Chevy, she rides just fine when you turn her on heavy!  Just a suggestion!!! Who cares if no one knows what it means! :-)
I love you music
Mannnnnn I got a 73, and my ol'lady is an 80 somtin
The 5.3L sounds better than the 350
Damn finally a voice with a heart and soul wow
I’d rather donate money to Oliver to make him rich than him take a record deal hes so genuine, love that he’s held out especially coming from nothing takes strong will to turn down millions
Songs of the blue collar, yet your blue or red, yet it's true because the middle class should never be divided.
I’m just infatuated with your music. I really needed it right about now. Thank you for being you. ❤ and bringing this world some amazing music and giving others something to think about.
Fuck the politics glad you’re singing about a Chevy
This is the definition of authentic. Dosnt get more wholesome god bless you brother

Uma brasileira inscrita 🥰🇧🇷
my 94 obs just went up in value.
Bro.. I can't get enough of you. I feel like we are best friends!
Gotta have a 1911 in that baby!!! 🔥
hey man talk about a waste of potential. not you, there have been a few chances for me to actually play music with people... i play a mean harmonica and many people around me always spar me on, i try to stay humble, but looking around (watching you with JP) man i do wanna do more, hearing you speak with Jordon i see many of the same feeling i have. hell i won my highschool  battle of the bands alone only after learning the guitar for a year (and harmonica) but its nothing compared to just being a positive influence, if i gotta do it myself i, feeling convicted to try, if you've ever considered a harmonica player. I'm here :) i love bluesin and straight harping chords
This is the best song ever!!! I may be slightly biased because I've owned a shit ton of 90s Chevys!
Keep the hits coming! Love to hear good country music!👍
What an absolute vibe
You could read instant pancake directions and it would sound good. Stay good.
are you so good oliver that i wanna say industry plant? why do i sense industry plant? God gave u the gift of self love,,,,,
What does he say at this paat of the song, we can take it nice and slow, a case of beer and ?
Come sign my 90 some Chevy I'm the poor man south of Richmond
Keep The Faith!  God did it!  There are those who want you drunk and high, but that kind of life will never satisfy.. you already know.  Praying for you
what a great voice
He has got to be one of  hank williams jr. Offspring ..maybe from when he odd in denver   😂😂
Dam this is fire
Thank you Chris for your music, I love it all! God bless you Sir!!!!
Wow i really like this song.. I can relate
You have an amazing Voice!
Actually, it's a GMC. LOL   Another good song though! Keep it up Oliver Anthony, the world needs you.
His voice gives me the old country vibes my parents and grandparents raised me on
That was a close call…..real country music was almost gone until he arrived
Valar Dohaeris ❤️
Plain and simple Awesome music keep up with making music
He got a better camera.  Money flowing now brother. Stay true big dog.
Had a 91 long bed S10. Traveling all over the USA ole Betsy never let me own
Don't ever change brother
People are bitching and complaining about how there's a handgun in the video. What a bunch of wimps.😢❄️❄️
Changed my mind, this one is my fav so far, keep dropping them
Bro!!! Your becoming a legend fast my friend I love you and what your doing brother please keep your head where it’s at because it’s on straight every song I Listen to of your I love your doing great!
Been out of cell service for 2 weeks then find this great talent wow
America loves you. Thank you for voicing our thoughts.
Singer/Songwriters like Oliver, will put a big dent in popularity of regular, old, run of the mill country radio stations.
Thank you Oliver.  Loving your music.  ❤️ Loving that Gretsch Guitar also.  I own the exact same resonator guitar.  It’s been a trusted friend for many years now.  Keep it coming…I’m all ears.  👂
I just want want to know the 1700 dislikes and WHAT they could possibly have not just clicked the back button for rather than a dislike.
Posting this on several OAM videos:  Shit is crazy today. We all know it. Rigged elections, racial division, transgender child abuse by monsters trying to normalize p3d0philia, open borders being invaded by illegals while the cartels sell fentanyl like it's lemonade with impunity. The once glorious US is ablaze figuratively and literally (fake climate change). The empire is imploding and it's deliberate. Everyone is scrambling to look after their loved ones.   In the midst of all this, I we see the end of a wonderful era in which we all had the best moments of our lives, as we dread the dark future coming of AI running our lives, social credit scores, facial recognition and eating bugs in our pods... JUST before all of that cements itself right over our dreams and hopes, we can all be thankful that all of the sane, good-hearted, just trying to get by people of this nation got to gather around the campfire one last time and listen to Oliver (Christopher) Anthony lay it down straight for us one last time. Just a lil reheated truth seasoned with a twice-plucked twang, a side of frustration and smothered in a graveled voice. You'll have to have the plain tea, ain't nothin' sweet here...
Simple and gracious! Hits the soul! Thank you for the solid tunes
This dude…I’m mean what can you say but it’s a banger!
Nothing like a good Ginger!!    Love it !!
MORE!!! Please and thank you for sharing your music with us all.
This man is no flash in the pan. This is real songwriter. Beautiful playing and singing.
Whoah.. You're getting major views on everything.  Super duper!
"That ole darling of mine is like a 90 Some Chevy, she rides just right when you turn her own".
I have the same Wrangler pocket tees... Walmarts finest!
Keep it up don’t let them corrupt you. Your music is amazing and speaks to the common man and woman’s heart, and he’s just spitting the truth of the problem. We’re all dealing with, including myself keep it up.
...this guy!
As a guy with a 92 Chevy and a good woman, this is my new theme song. You're just writing middle class hit after hit.
Sounds like Chevrolet needs to get on their knees and pray for Oliver to allow them permissions to use this song for their next ad although I understand turning down the contracts. This would be pretty badass to see from a fellow guitarist in Phoenix Arizona
This is great and I can really relate the 90s chevy. Best trucks ever made, and you've inspired me to fix the exhaust leak. Keep it up
Oliver Anthony performing live at Louder Than Life 2023 - Thursday and Friday (Sept. 21-22) at Kroger Big Bourbon Bar!
Damn, I love it.
Awesome
Anyone trying or making money off his back is just is a low life like a bounty hunter.
I could just chill in the mountains by a campfire and smoke a doobie while drinking my jack and coke listening to this guys music. Great job sir. 👏
You have red beard anthony you are viking
No one hit wonder here 😳
Country songs like these haven't been made for the last 40 years.
Case of beer and a Zebco! Love it!!!!
Keep it up brother!!!....
Yes brother!! Amen
You hit true American roots!! God Bless you!!
I just want you to know the impact you have on this 65 year old woman!! Your soulful voice reaches into the deepest hurts of us all, and cries for us with words we seemingly cannot find the effort to utter. Many a tear has fallen since my son introduced me to your music the day before yesterday. You are an anomaly, sir, and especially since you stay true to yourself by thumbing your nose to companies stressing how much you 'need them'. Honey...you need no one, just you, ' your dogs and the good Lord'. And may He bless you!
Very good.
Now this is music for your soul and an old back road!
I love your songs. Your awesome keep singing.
Its alright, but hes no Nickelback.
He got sober and unleashed himself upon the world.
Hey man thank you for awesome music. My life is falling apart right now and your music is helping me when I think I can't take it anymore. I had to take my firearms to a friend because I have seriously been thinking about it. Your music helps. Again thank you.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man, would love to burn one and hang out with you man. Keep it going.
I made a playlist for every song you have Spotify and I listen to it everyday. Your music is something my souls been longing for. Thank you.
Love it!!! ❤
Awesome!
The live version was better
Man Chris, what a tune!!!
Nooooo, go back to the unmixed songs!
I love my truck 😊country roads and dust im sure to Washington in white trash wouldn't like it any other way y'all😂 😂😂😂😂
I miss my old trucks
Great music for the head. Thank you sir to help my Vet Sanity ⛩️⛩️
Please stay true to yourself ❤
🍺
You a real one ❤️.
This version is good but I like the original. In the original, i feel a working class person talking to me and understanding the same struggles. The studio version just sounds like music which is still really good but I like the original better.  Keep up the great work!!!
I liked the first version of this i found much better, this one seems to have a slower tempo-
I wish I could give this more than one like.
love your music but a Chevy 350????   BUWAHAHAHAH   they wouldn't pull a sick whore out of bed... you have to warm them up with the starter...    LOL   had to mess with you...  A FORD GUY..  GM and DODGE still can't catch the Coyote 5.0   no hemi's no LS's can
Ur the shit OA keep them coming 💯💯💯
This song could be on the radio at 1.25x
Good job!  You have hints of Hank Jr. to your voice...
He has done it again 👍
With the heartaches of what the world has become, putting this on in my 93 Chevy Lumina really warms the soul. Thank you Chris!
This is the comeback of real country music.  Your music brings me back to a kid sitting around fire listening to country gold Saturday night .❤
Hi just wanted to say you have the same edge as Johnny Cash 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Chris I wish you would consider doing a duet with Alya Schofield. It is amazing how you complement each other!!
1.75x speed hits different
Ur words connect  and touches souls,ur  voice is one of the best my brother. God is working through u for sure.  Keep doing what he called u to do bro. You rock
awesome red neck beard
Platinum material friend keep up  the good work
Thats a nice tent you got there.
Salute 💪 🫡
I can't wait for season two when he shaves off his beard and does a face-reveal. I just spied an old video without it and spoiler alert - this man DOES have a chin.
Anthony is the best voice in the u s. Right now. The government has got to listen
You just will never realize how important you ate to the u s government  People need to be listening to you. I M from the hardest right voting district in the US. Red cloud Nebraska. Government has to meet the needs of the 😂.  People. That is what I learned from the basketball coach. Not the gard left
Beautiful man I loved my 2002 Chevy 2500hd ot was stolen from me by a charity that was supposed to be helping me that was a dark day in my life I k8lled myself that night
FWIW: 1. NEVER explain your songs; ALWAYS let them speak for themselves. 2. IGNORE the press, good or bad. 3. Keep doing it YOUR way; keep the suits out of it.
I was going to email you and talk about life. I have a disabled son he's 17 and his mom took herself out on 27th of July
Love it
Need more
Why’s his hair blonde and his beard red? 🧐
Keep singing for the people my man. 🤘 Love from middle of nowhere Washington
Damn this Chris guy made me a country fan and the only other country artist I really like is Willie Nelson. I don’t even know what modern country is but rap in cowboy boots and farms in place of skyscrapers.
Time is running out repent and get right with the Lord. He will come like a thief in the night.
This boy is on my chevy
How do you record so many great songs in a few weeks.
I'm a girl with a 96 Chevy who loves this song ♥️
Case of beer and a Zebco!!!!! Hell yeah
Your music isn't the Style I normally listen to, but you're what I like to hear. I don't know if you understand, but I know that you do.
Had my 96 Chevy for 16 years. Longer than all 3 wives combined. 😉
🎶..a case of beer and a seven cola?    Anyway LOVE your song, message, values and your faith!  Keep it up brother!
Just in case you start taking requests. I'd love to hear your Cover of "Like A Rock" by Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band.😜
Proof the the country music on the radio is commercialized.
Your a epic musician and you give hope to those that may be lost. Don’t ever stop doing what you’re doing. You’re changing this country. Thank you.
Mines a 95 gmc stepside, and a beautiful 72 panamanian
My family is from Dresdon Kentuky/Tennesse. Thank you for what you do
👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼  definitely a better writer than you give yourself credit.  Stay humble brother.
Im happy to see #ryanupchurch made this possible
Heck yeah!
His live versions sound so much better than the audio versions. I wonder if it was the quality he was recording with or if he just sounds better like this.
I relate to every song this old boy sangs keep them roots man I'll be a life long fan
He'll yeah a true country boy
I had a 91 k1500 as my first vehicle. Made some of the best memories of my life in it. It’s sitting in my backyard now waiting for me to have enough money to restore it and treat her like she deserves. One of the best vehicles I ever had never left me stranded and always got me home safe. I’ll never get rid of her
I have a really good sound system and I'm from Los Angeles. I don't normally listen to This kind of music but I've been bumping it in my car all over LA.  I do get funny looks here and there but I don't care.
Brother….., you are a word smith!  Nothing better than a musician that can write lyrics. 🎉❤
I feel this one more than Rich men north of Richmond!!!...I'm buying your album when it comes out.....#justanoldTennessean
Seriously.... Chris....your career will last  for as long as YOU decide. Your fanbase is established. Keep churning out these hits! LOVE IT!
Hoping you can stay sober through all this new. Love the song!
Keep it up, your definitely crossing genre’s… Your one of my new favorite artists… I’m bald headed, tattooed, and mixed Mex/ Hawaiian from Cali… I gotta give credit where credit is due…

Didnt Toy Caldwell pass away about the time this kid was born? The looks, the values, I think a possible reincarnation here. :0
💯Another hit! 💫💫💫💫💫💫
I e been praying the lord for some good music and he has delivered after years of ear bleeding he has answered my prayers thank you my friend for you’re talent
You’re the best out my guy
Been listening to you for a long time.. Glad others have gotten the pleasure.. Isle of Wight  County VA.
where did this guy come from
Turns out a generation can be raised on the Internet and still fall for the bait.
True music trancends. I have never been a fan of country music, but I am a fan of this music. Give everyone a chance, listen to their words. That's the message, that's it.
Love your sound, Chris. Nothing like it. Please keep bringing it hard...
I really need these songs on CD.
Damn Son! Giddy up! That's a good hearing tune right there!  ❤it 👊
Awesome tune !!!
What Beautiful  song Oliver
Such an excellent cruise song.
Finally some real homegrown country music 💯💯🙏
I don't even know what to say brother. Knocking them out of the park!
I think im hooked bud, down home folk music is my new peacful sipping & smoking background sound.
God has gifted you with amazing talents, sir.
This man just doesn’t miss
Oliver, you’re changing the game. Here I am, an 80s/90s metal head, with mad respect for the OG country singers, figured that style of country was gone, it’s not and you have my attention
Great music as always
I could listen to his voice non stop, very unique and amazing
That's some good pickin & singin there!
Keep um coming 😊
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Other than being very talented, I feel like the reason his music is resonating with people is because people are craving authenticity in such a fake world we live in today, No auto tune bs , Just a good ol boy with his guitar and dogs pluckin away
I just got my replacement headphones so I don't have to listen with earpods.  The writing, singing, playing, performance and musicality of this song is as good or better than the best country songs ever released. I very much enjoyed the video too. Kick ass and keep 'em coming!
Keep em coming! So glad God is blessing you while you bless us with your singing and lyrics that just hit so close to home!
Chris you have to come over to Amelia for the Field Day of Past!! We need you!
Hey Oliver, Sending you blessings and positive energy to handle all the crap that is being thrown at you.  Know this, there is a 57-year-old husband with a beautiful wife and young son in Diamond Bar, CA who loves your music.  STRONG brother!  Cheers, Rudy
When you coming to Georgia to see us??
Merci ❤❤❤
You rock Oliver! Lovin your music
He just keeps amazing me with his songs!
Young man, you have no idea how this song resonates to a fifty one year old man!! I have not been able to get north men north of Richmond out of my head until now. Only thing is I knew the year of the Chevy lol. Keep it up!!
Oliver Anthony, packing that heat and riding his girl like a old Chevrolet. Yeehaw!!! 🤠 🚗
Already bought it on iTunes keep up the great work. Loving your music. This and love u like a good ol dog hit home hard
Oliver, stay authentic and independent!!!❤
Just peeled off my boots today in hot Texas to listen to this and it HITS
God Bless brother!!
Anyone else have trouble finding his actual channel (this one)? I always get brought to Oliver Anthony Music-Topic. Not sure if that's also his channel or a form of suppression. Thanks
My man gonna win a oscar and tell them to shove it!😂
just discovered you today. your voice is amazing, keep killing it man!
Doesn’t matter what words he sings—I get goosebumps
Absolutely love your songs.  So genuine.. so real.  You feel it in the heart.  God is definitely standing behind you.  And using you as a vessel of pure music and feelings. Amazing 👏 .. touched by God
Another banger
Love this!!
As a 90s Chevy owner myself, this is a banger
Dude could be a millionaire within a week , but stays true to his heart, and i fucking love it!!! Keep it up brother!
Good job...gods really blessed you and your music....I'm subscribed...I like this one alot...I wished my songs would blow up like yours have...I'm a really small independent country singer/songwriter. Living in gladespring va..right off Interstate 81..if I knew how to use algorithms I'm sure I could get more views than I do...congrats and stay true to your music...singer/songwriters like yourself help me to continue writing praying one day I get noticed...again keep up the good work.  God bless you and your talents.
Thanks for your beautiful music, your soulful heart your boldness and your love. Believing with you for God to open more doors to bless and minister to hearts.
"A case of beer and a Zebco" perfectly describes my formative years and brings a smile to my face. Thank you from an old guy in Ohio!
Bravo mec ❤ il faut que tu soit connu en France 🇨🇵🤝🇺🇲
Love your voice not in studio!!
Heynid im talk to you like.anyome.w You blew up because God says it's time to show the world something now we are all on his time and his timing is perfect I just hope and pray that the holy Spirit was in this all as Christians I hope and pray we get more of them and I hope it we follow the right path in the right direction that leads us because it is for sure leading all of us in the direction tours Oliver but I don't believe there's no real big secret out there we're just here to do God's work and fulfill his will I truly believe that he died on the cross for our sins and that's what we give back
I'm from England 🇬🇧 love your music
dude you are amazing!!  I'm more of a metal guy I'm super picky about country there's no country singers I really enjoy since my childhood just a few songs I enjoy, but you are a country singer who I really enjoy, you gave me the same feeling I had when I was a little kid listening to Brad Paisley's Mud On The Tires album, and I haven't felt that from country in a while!
I like this one the most I think, great job brother!
Awesome music, Oliver. I’m a new fan because of Rich Men. We flew in to Raleigh from Wisconsin to see the Caamp concert. Unfortunately, they had to cancel tonight’s concert (possibly more it sounds). Are you playing anywhere close to here tonight?
This guys voice just hits the soul deep.
I ❤️this is my new favorite
This...this is how you write a song about a truck, beer and a woman. Not this bs you hear on the radio!
Oliver your music is off the charts amazing..i know you turned down millions for a record deal....if you don't want it that way, create merch..a T shirt or something....let your fans say thanks for the messages you are blessed to be able to deliver thru music you sincerely deserve it..!!
Brother now you’ll be able to buy all them 350 chevys
Your music saved me in a time I really needed it . Thank you man
Good music is good music keep'em coming buddy 🇺🇲💯
This was on my feed and I think I listened to this about 10x wait till I get back to work at the railroad I'm blasting this loud 🤘🏽🤘🏽
Love listening to this in my 99’ Chevy k3500.
Love. Keep them coming
Magnifique !!!
When does the CD drop?
thank you for opening up so many eyes. I just watched another reaction video form somone that I thought would tear Rich Men North of Richmond apart, and she actually loved it and agreed. A massive liberal, and she loved your song. Thank you for bringing both sides of the isle together with your honesty.
Dude amazing
Gretsch should sponsor this video for product placement. It wasn't the intention, but Oliver, you made that guitar really speak to people. Gorgeous setting! Makes me want to hike the smokies next year first week of June.
Check-out "Burden X Stern James" Remix. It's a remix of Rich Men North Of Richmond and it's great! They reach a new audience, one that might not see the original release on their genre. Just lovin' the whole Oliver Anthony vibe goin' on, it's exactly what we need! Blessings to all!! 🌟
Brother, just do us all a favor and never stop. When people ask who my favorite artist is, I'm gonna tell em it you!
Great song, and I don't even like Chevy's.
God's blessings are on your side. Git Er Don Brother. Loving it
Awesome 😊❤
Makes me miss my 93 stepside chevy i wish i kept that think and fixed it up
How many days you forget the shave befor the beard was so long?  Its very streange to see because you look so young. 😂😂 Nice color 😊
God Bless you brother spread the gospel
You deserve every bit of fame you’ve gotten in this short amount of time . Way to go Oliver !
It’s incredible that because of one song that when someone sees a new video by Anthony they need to click it. From no name almost to polarizing figure within 3 minutes
This is great American Country Music.  Harkens back to telling stories around the ole the campfire. Well done (again)
Who else got the Chevy commercial before the video?
The bright side of the precession of the equinox turns people into different animals, I always get excited to see what kind of strange creatures and critters we will get this time around. Sandalphon here archangel of the below space.
Your life is forever changed Oliver. Keep on 10 4.❤️🤍💙👍🇺🇸🙂
Bro you just keep pumping out the hits !
This song is really good ,keep them out and keep your heart and the Lord Jesus Christ in it.
I do like my '95 Chevy 2500.
Where can I go to see you
He's doing it, and doing it with our Lord CHRIST. Not Satan like so many of these sickos in entertainment. He may only be 30 years old and not gone through decades of suffering, but he sure knows what we're feeling. I support him 100%. 90 SOME CHEVY
You are an evangelist. I pray for your success.🙏
Dogs 💚💚💚💚
The destructive  force  will  not  take over  💗💗💗
My wife and I just had our 20th anniversary with the right one it stays like this. Love your music sir
You just made your woman smile brother! Good tune!
Not gonna lie I wanna know what kind of tent that is lol
We love you man!!!
All OBS trucks > any vehicle
God's blessings and protection be upon you and your entire family, brother! 🙏 💙❤️‍🔥💙✝️
only thing is i like square body chevys!!!!!!!  after 88 they were shit!   Dig the tune tho!!!
I just wanna say thank you sharing what came to your heart and for your music…it definitely good music and the coming from a city boy living in the projects
We have lost our Country to insanity and the 1 percent are running the show these days. Not sure how we get it back but if we don't, we will never be America again. For all their bitching about Trump, Joe and his crew are the absolute worst thing that has ever happened to this country. Thank you for putting what 99 percent of us feel into an amazing and unique sound.
My last one was like a Ford, not worth a durn.
Buddy keep the music coming best iv heard since the 90s
“A check I  couldn’t cash “ … , .if ya know ya know 😉
You have a wonderful gift from God! I have alot of respect for you standing up for God especially on your recent appearance on JRE. Keep staying on the narrow path (Mathew 7:13-14) allow God to continue to show you the areas  you need to work on. We all have areas we need to work on. Keep staying humble and daily pray and read where His Spirit leads you . God bless you!
Love this !!!!! Keep them coming 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Hank would be proud of you young man. Keep it real and look after those hounds.
Your voice has such soul and grit to it
Should be a FORD Truck
So good!!
Stay humble friend. Love your style.
What’s up brother! You are easily my favorite musician now. I’m a small town ky boy, 3 time combat vet, son of a coal miner, God fearing, Jesus loving, country boy. I respect what your doing, and 100% back you. There’s a lot of us out here tired of this new world. All races and creeds need to come together and take our country and world back, under God, with liberty and justice for all!!
Starting to think he living in them woods
Please. Please. Please. Wether you take a record deal or not. Don't ever stop making music
I miss my 95 single cab short bed 5.7 350 4x4 gmc 1500. She’d go through more mud than my dad 6.0 with 8inch lift and 37in boggers. Just bc I had more clearance and he had them be heavy axles that get hung up. Anyways good old days. Can’t say much bc the 6.0 is still here and the gmc been long gone
3 days 1.7 million views. Keep it up brotha loving the tunes.

Amazing song hits home from and live east tn I’ve daily driven 80’s Chevy pickup for 7 years
I hope you influence more country singers..better yet I’m gonna support more. Done with trashville
This is real country music. Its so refreshing, keep it up!
98 blazer til I die, not til it dies
90 Some Chevy……what a beautiful complementary song to some Rich Men North of Richmond they just flow together so well! Blessings my brother!
If iM going to support anyone its the Artist, not the "reaction" videos. Thanks Chris we love your soul.. bless you.
Many hits to come. Most talented artist today!
You are reminding me of my roots and the folk music my Grandparents used to play when I was little. Keep it up and don’t ever forget your roots. ❤
Real
the sound of an engine being turned off and the pitter patter of feet would have been the perfect fade out to this song
Creative and sexy.
Very nicely done
feels
I live in the Southern California desert  turn it up pops
Merica
Awesomeness love your music
You continue to amaze me!
Awesome 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Man I love this, this is just good damn music! And I’ve owned several 90’s Chevy’s, best trucks Chevrolet ever built
From one humble man to another, you'll never have regrets if you live with authenticity.
Good ol' Country Music. 💓
With a woman like that you are a lucky man! God Bless!
What is that Dobro you are playing? I was thinking to get one after hearing your music
This song is better with every listen.
solid little diddy
That voice just hits the spot!  Those words are touching my brother!  Wish you the best
I'm a bit older than you for me it's a 60 some Chevy
Beast mode brother ain’t heard nothing like this since frank and Hank
I've had a bunch of chevy's from the 90's. I wish I still had them.
This man is single handily resurrecting true country music.
A people's hero ⭐. Keep on keeping on and do what you do best bud. The people will follow who understand pure talent bud. 👍👍😎👌
This song is dirty 😂
The best country is a dude with just his guitar. Too much over produced country music out there, this is nice stuff man.
A man and a guitar. Simple. Good. Song.
awesome song that can resonate with people who like trucks that are American made.
This guy just might be the modern day Hank? Maybe.
This is literally the only music i listen to now.
Can I come jam with you? 😀
Oliver Anthony “Chris” for President ❤
Love the music, but you absolutely should be married if you are having sex with this woman the song is about.
You have such an amazing authentic voice man, I love it. I can hear your soul in your voice and I fuckin LOVE that shit!! Much love from Ohio 🤘🏻
I will always give a listen too a man of God.... proud of you for getting Joe to let you preach on his show it was great
I know what you feel being in the country. I got a few acers and it ain't much, but it's mine.
I'm so happy for you & proud of you young man  I witnessed one of, if not the most uniting song in my old lifetime. Stay true. Thank you, God bless!
I'll go there. Hank jr....so relatable...so much of what you're really thinking and raw.
Use your newfound influence and resources for good. Give back to the people. God bless you.
Hate country music but your voice is solid 💪🏻 🔥
As ya'll discussed on Rogan, I might go for an older Chevy, but I did really enjoy the IROC Camaros in the 90s.
I dont listen to country music. This song made me cry
Got a 1911 cocked and locked. Now I know your an old soul in a new world
Damn man I can’t find a single song of yours that I don’t absolutely love!  I’m not sure you understand what a blessing your songs and voice are to us! Your diving into the heart of America! Keep on singing and writing, keep on blessing America!  Thanks man,  #lifetimefanfromkansas
Beautiful song
Nice
Another good one. Thanks for posting Chris.
❤
Good stuff
"She rides just right when you turn her on"
As a owner of a 2000 Silverado and a 1995 S10, I understand.
Wow
This man is amazing with his music god pleased him I can only say amen. Don't let money control you Americans need you
Man that’s good stuff. Very relatable song to a ol common fella like myself.
Really digging these updated recordings.
"A case of beer and a Zebco"  Now you are talking to me brother.  Best times of my life envolve family, friends and 11 Mile Canyon.  Keep singing brother,  You've got my ear and my heart.
Awesome  song !!!!
I allow it
The old folks were playing your music at our little county restaurant. Youre lifting spirits in East Tennessee ❤
Most people nowadays don’t know what an “old 350” even means.
Awesome songs.   When are you putting out a cd.  I want one
Wow!  I like the sound, but comparing your darling to a 30 something year old pickup has to be right up there with a lyric Solomon would have written.
Love it! Need you in a real 90s Chevy Square body. Remake the video one day, maybe?
The feeling feels gone
Why do I feel like sturgil should produce a lil something something
I also have a song idea for Oliver. “How is it only 500 people that destroy this country”?
That's what ya call American Music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oliver this West Aussie here just loves your music 🥰 Your voice is amazing
🇺🇸
He is going to be the biggest country star real soon. And the best part of it is he is giving the record labels and studios aka woke corporations a big middle finger
I love your voice. You are loving proof that good music with a heart still exists. Thank you for that
Oh, my goodness...........................
Finally a non political song
The new only way do stop the rich is for their businesses to be owned by the workers, run democratically by the workers, with profits being distributed amongst the workers.
Damn he's good!
Rich men north of Richmond had that universal subconscious message that resonated with pretty much anyone who is an everyday Joe working for pennies. People understood the hurt. I don't know if I classify your music as country or any genre, I think you have created a new genre that should be universal subconscious music it resonates with people it ways that only an energy can explain.
1994 CHEVY 350 5.7 LITRE! MY BABY IN MY VAN! DRIVELIVE IS FUCK FROM RUNNING DESERT ROADS. BUT MY SMALL BLOCK IS THE BEST!!!!
I just got a notification for this
Him and Hank jr  should record one together
I have never liked music in general, country even less.  But this man speaks to me.  Where are the 7 producers, 22 song writers, 3 dance teachers, 25 back up singers , 9 studio techs, 300 tour staff, who know what else, didn't J Lo have someone carry her because the grass was wet.  Feels like someone you can meet anywhere and relate to.  Not these private jet, entourage types.
Pure Music from the heart. Wow....thank you...
I wish that i could meet you in person some day
Pls do a high quality version of I want to go home. It's my favorite song from you.
GET IT BO
Sweet.
This guy is pure honesty.  He writes from the heart.  Listen to his talk with Rogan.  He's down to earth.  He rejected a big money contract probably because he just wanted to write music, not be a cog in the machine.  That deserves mad respect.  Plus, he has a really good voice, the best since Chris Stapleton.  Also, lots of people, including hip hop artists, have used his work to make their own music.  He is a humble man, but he is also a phenomenon.
Nice song
Truly touches me right there brother. Thanks for creating amazing music with deep heart and soul
God you're voice is amazing . You're right up there with Cash, Alan Jackson and Randy Travis. I hope success treats you kind as a musician and you can share music with us for years to come. It's a good thing to hear damn good music. Keep country country.
Hey I just want to let you know you have an awesome voice I've heard only two of your songs the first one is wild all over the internet this one I'm listening to about the Chevy they're both awesome man you got a heart of gold you sing the truth keep it up and get it out there and get it to more people in the world
Another great song.
I knew he had to be a Chevy guy!🥳🥳🤣
A case of beer and a zebco. Just damn.
Oliver, Oliver, Oliver...you have done it again! Listen brother, I must admit that I'm not much of a Country fan (or a fan of most Modern music anyhow), but your music resonates with me. It resonates to my core, which is a very difficult feat for any kind of music to accomplish. You and I share much in common, and if God has sent some of His Angels to Earth, I believe that you are one of God's Angels, that you are one of His Faithful and have been sent to help heal the damned World that we live in.  I just want you to know brother, and I think I speak for every sane American out there, we appreciate everything you do, and I personally thoroughly enjoy your works! Keep up the tremendous work, and your powerful songs will help us to conquer the Demons that have control over the World! ✝️🙏🏻🇺🇸🦅⚖️👏🏻👏🏻  May the Heavenly Father and Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ watch over you and protect you, Mr. Anthony. God is gracious and merciful, and I pray to Him that He hath recognized your redemption in the eyes of the Lord, and you have found what God has called upon you to do. Amen.
Alright Anthony, you got everyone's attention now.... don't lose it
Keep singing, you do it great.  Real music for real people.
I can confirm
I live in a 90 some Chevy (94) with my love. It’s like this was written for us. ❤
This is a good one too Oliver. Love from Georgia 😊
Thanks for sharing your music with us, god bless ya brother!!
Brilliant!
Great song brother!
Absolutely amazing!!! 😍
@oliveranthonymusic you’re the breath of fresh air people have been waiting for
I love my 93 Chevy stepside
Well damn son.
Killed that shit again man !
Don't sign a deal brother!!! Make your own record label!!! Stay INDEPENDENT!!!!
Never liked country till I heard this nigga right here he’s hood approved 🔥💯
Great song
“A case a beer and a what”?
When will I be able to buy your music on vinyl ?
From watching him on the Joe Rogan Podcast, I realized it's "Oliver Anthony Music" not "Oliver Anthony, Music". As in, this is the type of music his granddad, Oliver Anthony, would play. Not that this dudes name is Oliver Anthony, and this is his music.  (His name is Chris)
If Oliver Anthony and Jamie Johnson make a song together it'll dominate the country charts.
Oliver Anthony 2024!
Keep it you and string’s forever
Love this song! I sing along with all these songs now!
👽
Grow your beard back
Build greenhouses to end poverty.  Jesus would
Love it 💖
You deserve the recognition and much more. Everyone needs to hear your words and music. Gods given you a great gift, and I’m glad to see how humble and genuine you are. The world needs a heck of a  lot more Oliver Anthony’s.
"a case of beer and a..." what??? First time I've never understood your lyrics, and not sure I'm liking that.  Just to be clear, no shade, as my daughter would say, you are not yet married to this girl, but you want to be? She's all that plus a bag of chips and she earns good money and she hangs with you even in your misery and you still haven't married her?  Ok. Put a ring on it, make babies, teach them well, sacrifice yourself for them, fight back like the greatest generation and stand tall like you already are. You will see that you will lose but they will win and your battles will be worth it all.
Keep on staying true to you! We don’t want label music, we want your words of encouragement & wisdom played just how you do em in the lyrical sense and harmonious sound, God bless you brother!!
Love them 90s chevys thank you for all you do Chris and thank you for being a voice for the rest of us keep being you love you brother
Beautifull song again! I have nothing with cars, but Oliver, love your shepherds.
I hope he takes his streaming money and starts his own music label. 😊 Keep it up
“I’m higher than gas” haha I feel yah bro
The soul of Ronnie Van zant lives in this young man.  A pure simple man's Poet
Reminds me of that night when i was 16 and my lady  at that time and I got out the back of that 90 some Chevy Camaro at the drive in, to a standing ovation.
I got no words.. it leaves me speechless. ❤ love it!!
Paitently waiting for a oliver ft chris stapleton and passenger track come on the world needs to hear your amazing voices together!
You are the best - I am addicted to your music. Keep rollin' put those songs. I have room for all of them. ❤❤ I love the line - A case of beer and a Zen Koan.  This man has really thought out his lyrics. I love the way he loves his gal just like he loves his Chevy. G-r-e-a-t
I have a 98 chevy k1500 z71. has a 350 in it now but upgrading to a stroker next year. She rides just right when I turn her on. great song brother.
you have the American voice!
@oliveranthonymusic absolutely amazing voice sir if there is any chance I can use your songs/audio for my drone videos it would be much appreciated!!!
Country music isn't even my style of music, YET you make me think I've not given it enough chance.  So thankyou for becoming my first. Uwu
Bro, u said it
Thanks for the flashback Brother !!!    This song hits home..
👍
You have moved people's minds and hearts. I hope whatever worldly blessings our Lord and Savior Jesus bestows on you, you will accept with grace and Thanksgiving!
Just as good.
Chris everytime one of your songs come out i become more convinced you have connected with people more than any musician in a long time.  I'm talking decades.  Just incredible!!
Young man, you haven't even gotten started yet.  ENJOY THE RIDE.  We'll be here. 🙏 ✌️😎👍
Great song! Reminds me of old time Country music.
Awesome sir!
Nobody that we need ever just explodes over night with a new viral song. The entertainment industry is just another propaganda medium. This guy was installed. I don’t believe this is organic.
Goosebumps on the Johnny line
1:20 Awesome. ❤ Real Americana!   Your popularity shows people still love that old sound! Loved seeing you on Rogan! I know you said that you dont like doing interviews, but seeing a regular Southern man on a podcast was awesome!  Finally, some representation!
So to hear all the publicity. Typical of Republicans to make some thing the weapon. After all, we all know they represent the wealthy always have. Any how love the music. It’s a shame everything in this country comes down to the dollar
This is Hank if there's anything close ❤🎉!
Great song and music you write Oliver, keep them coming man.
Every time I listen to you OA, my eyes fill, and my hope is revived. I think of this quote EVERY time I listen ~ "Stay gold Ponyboy." Stay gold OA!
❤❤❤❤
This guys got a genuine Outlaw Country voice.
Don't sell out to the media!
Man, What a song.  Had an 83 Custum deluxe. I miss that truck!
Haven't been a fan much country but when something resonates, it can be amplified.
"Might have to load up the dogs, go listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek" 🧡
You deserve all the success coming your way
You're awesome man, you say everything that needs to be said about this world, and you are a phenomenal singer, thank you for all that you do
I like your dogs
Lord these songs make me proud to be an American even though I’m from a small town in Yorkshire UK ❤
Makes me wanna smoke a fattie and chill with some poles in the water!!!
This one my favorite. Your a real talent my man.
I know it don't count much, but I like it!!!  Although I don't have a Chevy.
❤❤❤
Dude your songs are spot on, every single one! you have touched such a diverse group of people with your music and brought a sense of pride back to so many that have been beat down by all the craziness that has and is still going on in our country... stay true brother, stand tall and keep makin killer music
One of my favorites ❤!
Amen
Thats just good music...nothing more to say. Love your sound, brother.
Another authentic musician who didn’t flake out and sell his soul to the man in the black suit ! We can’t thank you enough 🤘🏼
I am a regular listener of Rogan.  Not so much a fan of him personally, but I like his variety of interesting guests.  I'm not religious either, but I admire you for not being afraid to go there in front of his MILLIONS of guests.  Nothing better than being real.  I live in Powhatan, VA.  Shout  out to you.  I'm very proud of you.  Please consider singing something one day from the High Bridge in Farmville.  What a beautiful spot.
Fookin unreal eh! From canada
Here I was thinking you were going to unite us, but here you are singing about a Chevy instead of a Ford. j/k, good song brother.
I’ve listened to this one a hundred times. Love it! ❤
This is what we need in the world ppl
Where can I buy a CD?
We love you Oliver. Your a breath of fresh air in some messed up times. You deserve EVERY BIT OF FAME YOU GET BROTHER!! much love from Southern Maine!!
Great song but I would love a small guitar solo in it. Just like 30 seconds of pickin’
Love It..!!
Love this one
This one got some soul 😏 In spite of what South Park says.
Hey bubba thankyou!!! This is some real 90 some country music!!
This man is single-handedly restoring my hope for the future of country music.
This just hits right. Thank you.
It’s a hemi!
Man if I could get half the response your getting.. just wanting to leave my small family something before my ticker goes out.. doc says I prob have around a year.. im 35 with 2 strokes and heart failure an all I want is to be able to leave my family something behind so there financially stable..
Hair standing up from first notes. only a few can do that
Great voice.

A man who truly chooses love over political beliefs, hateful rhetoric
Love this one!
Man love the music you do and more enough love how you look at this music thing you just make great music for people. And it's the truth GREATFULL for this man. Keep doing what you love.
A LEGEND HAS BEEN BORN

👍
My husband had been listening I was worn out until I realized this is the truest song ever and I'm singing it like a theme song....
You have so many amazing songs. Thank you
Sweet tent
Play it again!
Awesome man
North, North of Richmond 🇨🇦 here listening to your message. The souls touching everyone man, keep up the great work
It's so funny people still don't understand what your music is about.  Keep making music your way and let people and politicians gean from it what they may
I got a 90' some Chevy. Most reliable thing I have. Besides my wife.
Yeah another hit. Great to see
Damn what a great song...Chris you're a monster. Ty for the awesome images this tune paints...
Great music brother keep on pushing
Sweet
Man this might be my favorite yet.
Simply Amazing!!!!!! Thank You
👻 TRUTH IS: TRUTH IS ALWAYS OBVIOUS AND THE OBVIOUS TRUTH IS RE👻MEMBER  Romans 12:19 “Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.”  King James Version (KJV)
WOO. Tell ‘em boy!
Great song Chris.  I really like your lyrical style and melodies.
Imagine he makes rock music 🔥🔥🔥🔥
what the hell does "90 some Chevy" mean??
Mighty Fine! Loved your Joe Rogan interview
straight shooting brother
I had a 90 some Chevy. It’s an awesome truck
do something with UPCHURCH
Great music! Keep it coming!
What he said on rogan about his voice is absolutely true, he has had no formal singing lessons so when he cant hit notes right or whatever it makes the song better, everything is natural and a nice down to earth feel. Pure talent and class
LOVE THIS!!! SO CAN WE ALL MEET THIS SWEET LADY OF URS?? 💯🤘🏻👨‍👩‍👦‍👦🥰🙏🙏
Just goes to show ya Oliver...ya never know what God can do till ya ask! I just wish he'd hear me some day!
Country music is by far, my least favorite genre of music ever. And somehow, this, is really good. First time Country music actually makes me feel something. Special indeed.
Another classic!
I love my v6 2000 venture. It's not my dream Chevy. But it's a Chevy  baby
Another top quality tune brother - fantastic guitar And lyrics. Beautiful and captivating
So good Anthony. Ya rlly know how to connect with people through the great art of country music 🙏🫶
Although your sound is different, you remind me of old school, Hank Williams. He sang from what seemed like the bottom of his soul and you sound like that too. I think you could sing the alphabet and we’d all be feeling deeply. What a gift!
We soon begin  living  better  lifes  💖🤗
I love your sound bro.  Nothing like southern country music
Love listening to this good ol boy while sippin from a mason jar love the truth in his songs
Bro so spiritual brother much support coming from northern ky
Go Oliver! Kick the Politician’s where it hurts!
Great tune  sir! Love your music, keep on doing what your doing! Down to earth and sang from the heart an we can all feel it an relate. Love ya brother!
Listen to your songs everyday!! Love you music!!🙏🏼❤️
Keep up the great work Chris.
Boy I love this song..... Keep it up man, we need REAL country music right now
@oliverAnthonymusic   I love the music brother and keep up that work
Watched you on JRE. Happy for you brother. Keep killin it 🤙
Love it!! Got one of them 90 Something's myself....😊
A great 😊 man has talent 😮. Keep singing for all your fans. Proud to get to hear you sing. 🤟
Is that’s a song!!!
Such soulful music. And your voice is a real throwback to the greats of yesteryear. Keep smashing it, Oliver.
Im puerto rican from country part of island & relate to u so much bring tears to many pples eyes . Your amazing MY BRO !
Thanks 👍 stay true
@oliveranthonymusic I love your music and your style. Know that you are not alone. You've got a whole crowd that believes in you. I'm one of them. Keep up the good work, brother. May God bless you, abundantly, in all you do.
His voice is Folk lore get it Folk Music.
Love your music man! Keep up the great work!
Would you be so kind as to compose one about how corporate welfare is worse than welfare for poor stupid people please?!😊
Yes
2:19 "A case of beer and ....?????" Lyrics say "it's hell cold" but that definitely doesn't sound like what you said. lol
What I find the most fascinating is with government, media, and many other groups pointing to all our differences one man snaps us all back to reality and shows us how much we ALL have in common.
Read in between the lines.This song about Traditional women and a traditional marriage. Lot of the modern women today are trash and thats why we have the passport bro's of today.
casually the best song makers thats come out
To be honest your the only country artist I’ve liked since Lee Brice, thank you 🙏🏼
Mine is also like a 90-some Chevy.  It takes a while to get her going some mornings.  She whines & sputters, even when she's in idle.  She's constantly backfiring & spouting fumes.  Sometimes it takes some cussing to get her to change gears.  There's that funky smell in the back that has been there for years but I haven't bothered to investigate it.    That's what I get for buying used.
This is the most authentic, raw singing voice I've heard since Johnny Cash. Edit: I didn't even notice the Cash reference in the lyrics the first time.
Awesome song, brings me back to basics of my marriage. It's so wonderful spending this kind of quiet, slow time with my husband. The best part today is adding you to our play lists.
I wonder if"they" are watching this true patriotic man
Lyrics written straight from the heart🎶🎶🎶💞💞🌻
Love love love this tune
A case a beer and a Zebco....love it!!!!
Legendary
dude your music is so refreshing to hear
I love your musical vibe! Authentic!!! ❤
The Libtards are losing their shit because it shows a pistol at 1:19
Country is back!!! Lord..I do like Oliver, his twang and his message..keep on singin & playin..and try real hard to stay true to God and yourself🎸🇺🇸🎸🇺🇸
I was hoping you where a FORD guy.  I'm out.
Ahhhhh come on!   Where are the TRUMP flags Don't tread on me, come on.  Give us what we want!
This guy is saving country music!
Love him and his down to earth style.
Love it keep it conning
Storytelling is the essence of bluegrass music, and you got it buddy! I love it.
Case of beer and a Zen Cone…. Man o man! Oliver your lyrics are 🔥🔥🔥
For me, it would be an 80 Something Chevy, but it hits home just the same. Every one of his songs resonates with my soul.🙏
Some softy will be offended, "Oh my gosh he had a gun in his car." lol Wimps
I love this a LOT
This is what Sturgill Simpson needs to return to. His NPR tiny desk performance was legendary with just his voice and his guitar. Haven't seen him in a while, hope he's alright.
Keep it up man, this country needs your music.
This is music! Every last one of your songs has just been a breathe of fresh air that there are still REAL artists out there. Keep making music and we will keep listening. God bless you
In love with this song. Thank you
You know the reason they offered you that 8 million deal? To Try and keep you from spreading you insite on the world. Your songs tell of the way the world is. Our government doesn't want people to hear gospel of their live's. Reality is what they are trying to stop. They godless soul's. Sodomite's. Keep your messages going. The hearts of Americans need this there is answers to the question here.
This music does not over stimulate my mind. Typical music with half a dozen instruments and backup singers does though……
When my wife and myself started dating we would just ride around in my 94 chevy, some of the best memories. 15 years and 2 kids later were more in love than ever. Makes me miss that truck and how simple the world was back then. Great song, brought back some good memories
The word PRIMAL comes to mind a lot l when listening to this singer.
Numbers dont lie bubba ❤
One guy with one instrument sounds much better than the typical singer with half a dozen guitars and a drum player.
so good !👌
How long before the perpetually offended have an issue with you comparing a woman to a car? 😸
As a guitarist myself and musician who has played out for many years, your natural talent is obviously undeniable. The songs have great thought and flow and the vocals are powerful and smart. I would love to see you take these songs and record them with a full band at some point. I think they would really come alive.
Your Joe Rogan was epic 😂
You da goat 🐐
Absolutely amazing!! Your music speaks to my soul. Thank you for what you're doing. You're an inspiration for so many✨️ P.S. "She's my Carter, I'm her Cash" *CHILLS*
Your music is... Well it's not really country... It's more blues influenced and I absolutely love it!!! Dude keep up the great work... U keep dropping songs and we will keep listening!!!
Does her fuel gauge keep going out so you have to drop the tank every 2 years?
the accents of the song are very beautiful, country sounds in the shower
The day I heard Rich men … I downloaded every single song.! I’ve been obsessed with one!! 🖤
No one is more deserving of preching a good message
Amazing tune my friend.
This song is gold!
That's a damn good one man..
This dude is going to be a legend. I'm glad for you man. A talent like yours only needed to be seen and, I'm glad it did. Congratulations man you earned it.
Love Oliver's voice.
Case of beer and a Zebco. Nice.
Does anyone get reminded of Tanya Tucvoice. the early 90s when they hear that gravel and resonating in his soulful voice.
I love this song
thought there'll be no more country but Our Saviour have arrived... thank you❤❤❤
You're song's are AWESOME.....keep up the good work!!!
This man could sing a phone book and make it worthy of listening.
My dad played a Gretsch!!! And had a 1960 something Martin,  Alvarez.....I really appreciate you Oliver ❤❤❤❤
Keep it up man
SING IT MAN!
Kinda reminds me of 'Thinkin on a woman.'  Great tune
Brother I don’t even Listen to country music. As a black man from Buffalo NY you GOT ME. I’m hooked my man 🙏🏽
Okay, I am so happy for this guy.  He can sell millions of dollars worth of his songs with just him and his guitar.  If he wants to he can get a band and rerecord the songs with them and sell millions more.  God's divine wisdom is at work Chris.  He has sure blessed you.
Dude needs to get ahold of Upchurch immediately
Love it man. The carter and cash line is gold.
You really blew up. We know what kinda person you are since you turned down $8 mill
It’s the voice   I’m tellin you  Keep listening guys ❤️
*early 2000’s Chevy
Thank God somebody ..  is making REAL Hillbilly music again .. and i mean that as the highest form of a compliment as i can give ❤
I have a confession!!!   I'm a ladies man! 😊
Next johnny cash. True american folk music.
PEOPLE LIKE ME > PEOPLE LIKE YOU   WE THE PEOPLE
This geezer is good! Since Rich Men he's put out banger after banger.
My nigga
I hate modern country, but I love your music. It feels more like Appalachian folk, and being from New England it just feels familiar.  Please don’t change anything you’re doing. I’m not religious, but I respect your brand of faith, and approach to society as a whole.  Thank you so much.  for what you’ve contributed to our culture.
Nice ol skool country! Real stuff
Damm this makes me wana strum again
I had a 96 Suburban with the 350 and put 398k on before it got TBoned, this song hits close
Tune man!!
please sing more songs like this, not 'rich men north of richmond'.  you've got too good a voice and music talent to be known for just that song.  I get why "rich men" went viral, not hating on it.  Just saying that what you've got goes waay beyond that.  I'd go so far as to say - just stop performing 'Rich men' all together.. let that song fade out, replaced with song with little bit more clever writing..
You can fuck right off with your shit. By fuck right off I mean please stay, and with your shit I mean your beautiful music.
Not gonna lie, even how insane Rich Men North of Richmond was. This feels like another side of a coin but still just as good and a very comfortably listening experience.
As a man who drives a 97’ with the Vortec 350. I approve
This is perfect dude
Lyric help please.......A case of beer and a ?? Old Zebco?
Genuine country music we love you brother
I like the holstered 1911 in the truck! Carry on, Sir! Well done!
Was this dog gonit
Thnk you g, and God bless
Welp I definitely didn't write that one did I .....SMH
This one is fucking great Oliver!!!!
come to mobile Alabama deff make ya money if u do
Yes Sir
Just crankin out bangers
Thank you Chris 🙏🏻
This is fire
Joint fire
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Proverbs 4:20. You quoted this in Joe Rogans interview and it was something perfectly writen like you said. Advice from a father to a son. But also our country!! Love you all!
Keep droppin we will keep listening we need it
Chris, write more about the Washington puppeteers.
Just record every song in this format. I’m not a country dude but I am a music lover. And one who used to perform just a acoustic guitar and microphone. There’s something real and unfiltered about it regardless of the genre. Stay in this place man, it’s special and everyone is going to try and get in this place or get you away from it. This is your way to be grounded from the virality you have. Grow those roots here in this field and forest.
This sounds different than his other recording of this song.
I’m not to old brother but love the music at most but I wanted to say this one makes me think of every else that what the real meaning is. My best friend got engaged and made me think the best for him. Reason being is for all the memories we’ve been through over the years since we were little amen just appreciate life wether it’s bad or good And  remember the good times and things used to be and how wish I could go grown up in my grandparents ere ! Love ya man keep up the work! Ps hopefully see ya live soon
🔥🔥🤟😎🤟🔥🔥
Caught you kickin' it with Joe Rogan. Good to hear more of your story. Congratulations on livin' clean. You are in my prayers! Over and out Boy Scout. Bravo!
You got something big man don’t change at all we need more like you man a true country artist
Watching from NZ 🪕🎶🪕 thank you for sharing your gift with us Chris. Looks like your dogs enjoy their time with you in the woods and by the creek too.
lucky enough to have 90 sumpin chevy
I don't like a song more than once except Bob Marley, Jimmy Buffett, God rest their soul and you. Please keep it up.
Brother, you are like a breath of fresh air and music to my ears! I grew up listening to Hank Williams Sr. Hank Jr. Johnnie Cash,  Merle Haggard, Waylon & Willie, George Jones &  George Strait but the last 20 yrs or so Country Music has changed so much I don't listen to fake bs anymore. You are amazing and AMERICA needs what you GOT! Thanks and God Bless You! 💪🤠👍
Aussie bloke here, and fellow guitar slinger. No shit, right now you're inspiring me to put pen to paper instead of stumbling across something like what you've written and thinking "Fuck, I wish I wrote that!" Keep going mate, I absolutely love it! Will definitely be at one of your shows if you ever come to Australia 😁
Oh! I ❤ this one ❗
This is the music we need and Miss. Good sir, thank you for staying true to yourself and your purpose. God bless you and thank you for what your doing bringing people back together ❤️🍺
This is just simply amazing!  Absolute hits as well!!
Love love love the music which is why I made this https://youtu.be/WIktVytsQdE
God Bless you Chris, you've brought a voice to the working class that can't be denied.
As amazing as “Rich Men” is, this one is my favorite of yours yet.  It reminds me of being a kid, when my Dad had Waylon or Hank Jr. on the radio.  Wonderful memories.  Thank you so very much for sharing your talent with us all.  🙏🏻🫡
Sweet song man.
Video would be better if it was filmed from inside and outside of a 90’s Chevy with a 350 instead of a newer LS powered one.  But, love the song regardless
I love your music.  Down to earth and reaches my heart.  Stay the man you are.
Oh yeah this one was smooth!
Dude's living life right.
Good stuff. Great guitar. Keep it up.
That's a gmc fucking poser
Brother enjoy your music. It went so fast man because you speak the working man and women's heart and feelings! Keep going Brother!
Gas is $3.57 here on southwrst Ohoo noe let that sink in.
so influential. Makes me wanna be country
We got a 90 something Chevy we call her old reliable
What a voice! Perfect country music voice. I hope you do well in the music business. I watched your podcast with JRE. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
LORD works in mysterious ways.  Oliver’s  music just touches a Holy Spirit nerve
Damn, that's good. Really good.
Awesome song! 🤘
Chris has a unique way of putting words together and make them transition perfectly. Love his message and his music. Both are real.
Good tunes Oliver! I think you should take that Big music production deal and sign it for your family and your children so your bloodline is secure and safe forever. You have a heck of a gift the good Lord gave ya that can do a lot for your family and this world and you sharing it is appreciated. 👍
Chris, buddy, we are gonna be life long friends. Your music is magic. God bless.
That picking reminds me of Willie
Case of beer and a Zebco. Dude-that’s my dream
Honest lyrics for once. Keep goin brother
Man this is real music. For the sole. Something you not only hear but feel. EVERYTHING youve done is amazing my friend. Keep up the AMAZING work and never sell yourself out. no need . we'll ALWAYS be here!
I live right next to Lost Nations State game area in Southern Michigan in the middle of a 60 acre corn field country boy biker to the core and your music is how I've lived my 56 years. Keep em comin and keep em real 👍
I saw a couple comments of people asking but couldn't reply. The lyric is: "A case of beer and a zebco."  Unless I'm mistaken.
Thank you Chris..
My dogs love your music. They try to climb on my lap whenever I play your songs on my phone. They’re 95 & 80 lbs. It can be overwhelming.
Zem cone? What is that?
Your voice touches deep into the soul❤
Yep
Please write a song about the millionaires and billionaires can't take it with you 😢
Never thought that I'd hear real country music from a new artist in these modern times. My old soul is happy every time I hear this man's music.
😍
I like this better than the first one, nice!
Hotter than a pistol....keep trusting the process!
This is feast and famine, Passion and pain and loading up the dogs is something the working class does and knows the love that comes from it. Thank you for your God given talent and truth and reminding all of us of what is really important at the end of each day. Millions have your six Oliver.
The attitude of these songs reminds me of Woody Guthrie and Jimmy Rogers. Story to tell. Stark contrast from the top 40 country songs that plays on the radio. Unlike record labels who change to try to woo audiences, Oliver doesn’t, and that’s why it’s so genuine, that’s what everyone is identifying with.
Just a true American that knows how the hell to sing that speaks his mind, which is the truth 90% of true Americans can relate with 🇺🇸
Youtube is freezing the view counter. (They do it to tommacdonald constantly) This video had 15 to 20k more views every 15 minutes after it was posted, then the count stick around 372k for hours
Christopher  = Carrier of Christ
So beautiful!
Great love song.
Man, what a song. Love it
Amazing stuff!
Love U brother. Keep doin' U.
Ive got a 96 chevy suburban with an original 350 engine. Just got back in town after it took us with our 26ft travel trailer into the back country camping over labor day weekend. That 90 some chevy is something else. 👍
Love the gun passenger side at 1:20 hahaha
You read this recently before a show. I believe this was it?  Ephesians 6:12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of the world and against the spiritual forces of evil in high places. Therefore, put on every piece of God's armor so you will be able to resist.
Don’t go mainstream you can sell out shows without the Satanic music industry
This feller deserves our support lot to turn down. (8 million dollar deal!?)  True southerners are a different breed! Ive been across the US but born and raised in the mountains of NC and call it home today. I can imagine their faces/thoughts when he turned their money down, but you can't buy honor and what some people stand for. Stay humble God will bless you and remember there's more of us that want change, then the Rich Men North Of Richmond!
Thanks for sharing with us... sincerely

What's the word just after "case of beer and a..." ??? Is it Zebco? Thank you.
You have a gift for music, truly.
He needs to run for president!!
Stay true to yourself Oliver, don’t change for anyone or anything. You are believed because your believable. You have such a platform; use that gift God gave you to make a difference.
Yo what type of tent is that?
Wow my brother, that’s all I can say. Please continue to spread the good news of the gospel and hope for our country.
That unique Modern day willie nelson ..pure legend🤘such a fan ..
God bless Oliver Anthony your music 🎵🎵 is medicine for the people
Case of beer. I'm guessing throw-up in the back of the chevy.
Love your music!!  Thank you!!
Got teams of songs writers wishing they could write a song like this guy, haha! Nah you gotta live it to sing it brother.
Your dogs are your secret to your success :) Keep the music coming.

Hell yea obs life
your more than welcome brither.. I love it brother . Love how you swing your voice when i except a diff tune  I love it.
2days... 1.3M views!  Great to see!!
It has been a hard day…
People seem to be buying the old version on iTunes thinking it’s the new version. I had a little trouble finding it myself
Another great song. 👍 Love the music Chris, keep them coming!
Keep going strong brother 💪 your doing our generation a favor. Country music just aint the same anymore. You continue to bring back good memories from childhood sittin around the fire with old folks thats passed on now. This aint your last rodeo bubba 💪 keep singing them good 'ol songs.
This is fantastic music that makes me happy.
"a case of beer and a ?????" a what? I've looked up multiple lyric sites and they all say different things.
@oliveranthony, I know you don't want to get into politics,then why would you cater to Obama,he is a freemason who worships Lucifer, common fact . Your song's appeal to us the American people,but your losing   your fan base , because let me tell you the woke left don't care about you. They dont
Thank you! Keep up the great job. Just be yourself. It obviously works 😊👍
his lyrics are top notch and the way he sings it out a well. Great job man!
@1:20 speaks volumes. These left wing whack jobs want to take our guns. I live in a Blue state where they just passed the mag ban bill.. oooohhhh thats gonna stop bad guys with guns for sure.... smh... friggen idiots.
You inspired me I bought today a one owner 1993 c2500, a/c works and the truck looks amazing
Aye bro your f'n music makes the hairs on my arm stand up 😂
I like the other version of this much better. The one where it’s a still black and white picture of the forest. This is toned down a bit and doesn’t have as much soul. I’m lovin all the songs though! You’re a great song writer/singer.
For not wanting to be famous sure see a lot of him now. This supposably old song now becoming famous more then before. So becoming famous somehow... He posts these video now just sky rocketing away. Wonder what is next in his line up of don't want to be famous songs. Just someone and his guitar.
Can't get enough of your music man 🤘 Love what your doing and how your bringing so many people together with your amazing talent!
She's my Carter, I'm her Cash....that's gold brother! WNC
Got Damn Brother ....I gotta get up and see you in Flesh n Blood
Thank you . Finally someone that sings from the heart and not the pocket of a rich label company.
Oliver Anthony is my favorite artist as of lately, and will continue to be my favorite artist. His music and his lyrics has the best story telling, all combined with the musical aspect too. It’s just beautifully written, it’s beautiful musically, and beautiful to watch. The scenery just adds to it. It almost reminds the listener that this guy is genuinely from the south and from the backwoods, so you just know he really lives the lifestyle he sings about. The deer blind just hanging out in the bush, the dogs, etc. All of it adds to his artistry, and when people see this stuff, they can genuinely appreciate the authenticity. Because he just makes music in his backyard, and it seriously does not get any better or realer than that. That’s real soulful music that is sincerely heartfelt.

A million times better than anything out of Nashville.
God bless you mr.Anthony
I love this song it’s so damn good it’s ridiculous
Zebco, lol!!!
si quema cuh
Dont let them label you. Its how they tear you down.
I LOVE this song.   Probably my favorite. ❤
Lmao you got a gmc though
My wife took the kids and left me for being poor in hard times and not being able to work and be there for her. I'll tell ya the only thing that sounds alright lately is you singin' this one buddy. I appreciate you, your time and effort. Stay easy man. Love from Northwest Arkansas  @OliverAnthonyMusic
Hey if you ever need a bass player I can drive down to Virginia in my 90 some Chevy with 330,000 miles on it!
The Lord bless you and keep you; The Lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious unto you; The Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.
Fabulous!!
All the feels - thank you for sharing your talent
I just heard this song belting through the back woods here in FL. I was so happy to hear you released a new song
Keep it up brother. You're killing it!!
Good old soul  😊
True art! Keep ‘em coming!
Strums all the heart strings, most everyone can relate to in one way or another. Love your music, absolutely endearing and touching 😇✨🙏Many blessings to everyone💫
Fucking amazing ❤️
You have a itty bitty bit of power that will send your demon ass to hell with that gun. But I have the power of the son sun son on my side. The evil is about to be devoured.
I love you man you are amazing.
❤
Man I feel this...Great song! Love getting back in the woods and the love of a good woman!
Hi Oliver! Thought you may want to know that there's a Canadian Conservative YouTuber named Simon Hergot using your song Rich men at the end of his climate misinformation doc called Farmers under attack.
Love this guy!
I don’t wanna hear nothing bout you ain’t a good guitar player or singer.  That ain’t what it’s all about anyway.  Just be real(as you are) and people will love it.  I’ve been playing drums since the 5th grade and strumming acoustic guitars for 15 years.  I’m a solid drummer, mediocre guitar player and an ok singer but I ain’t got what you got.  So I’ll just sit back and admire what you do and love every second of it💪👌
You're a real talent young man  and lets hear it for that mighty red beard !
This guy is a Star ⭐️
Love it bro
Don’t sign any record deal and bet on yourself.
That’s winning brother you the best for sure
Not a 90s Chevy in the whole video but o well.
Stay true, brother.  Stay true.
And I bet she’s soft like that old sofa bench seat. If you’ve never owned a 1990-2006 Chevy, you don’t know what it’s like to drive a lazy boy.
Love your music. I hope you make i a CD because I'd love one im still old school
It was a 93 Ford short bed with the ol straight six 4 speed overdrive for me
Add drums and bass and steel guitar. Perfection.
Love your style.
I hope you never stop preaching the gospel Oliver. ✝ God bless you and everybody else here in Jesus name amen. 🙏
Dude as one musician to another this is a damn country song right here son!!! Great job brother!!!
your voice comes through cleaner than sound proof studios, how high is your gain on your mic? awsome stuff man, love seeing real people make it big
YOU GAVE ME COURIGE   THANKS A LOT  GO A HEAD BUDY  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I STILL DRIVE K 5 1977   ::: 350 :: MI WIFE  1989 S 10  4.3 V 6  THANKS SO LOT   RESPECT !
❤
So effortless & natural. Keep 'em coming! Greetings from Germany 🇩🇪 🎵🎸🎶
North of richmond should blow up more. That song needs to be played on the radio . In stadiums across america. If we americans want change we need to make it happen together
Eh GMC…but at least it’s an OBS 😄💪🇺🇸
I freaking love this dudes music. It sounds exactly like what I hear in my head when I think of good music. This the sound right here!
Sir thank you for some good home grown music 👍
Bros single handedly carrying country
Psalms 10:4 "The wicked through the pride(: a function of self-worth, a way of acting that will not lower itself to perform a healthy relationship and standard of love.) of their countenance will not seek God he is not in all their thoughts." So that in all their thoughts there is no remembering of the things he has done for them nor an imagination for the things he can do for them.   See Hebrews 11:1 and 6, Read the King James Bible and pray for wisdom.
I've listened to all of his songs and he just knows how to make music that touches your soul somehow. God has given him the voice that hits the heart.🙏🙏
‘97 Tahoe 2door  best truck, last trk I’ll ever own - ‘nuf said, none better
Dammit Garcia
Great song!
Omg I wanna marry u!! Im not crazy..lol there's just no country boys like u anymore
Bro this is the song that I think is the answer to our problems But 85 f 250 ;;still fits
I pick bluegrass music everyday. Hell, I’m pickin now. I’ve been waiting on another REAL ONE, glad u finally made it to my ears Oliver. Fan for LIFE! 💪🏽🤙🏼🇺🇸🤠
Damn you boy, you did it again.
Awesome song. Keep making great music and you'll drive the best 90 something Chevy.
There's somehow a world of difference for me between Chris sing a song like this and when bro-country artists who grew up in the suburbs do it.
Thank you for the music you bring to us, totally love the music you make, keep it up brother 🤞🙏
I am so happy for your success. Keep it up man. Stay true to yourself. Know you got this. Best of luck to you.
Be wise.  Be in the word.   Stay real.   Many blessings.
You can thank us by making more music that tells our story. #VA
I had a 79 camaro. 350 interceptor . 3 speed man. I loved that car. MANY tickets😂😂
Wow brother that’s an amazing song thanks an awesome video
You're keeping it real.   Thank you so much.
Thank you for sharing this gift
Keep the soul up brother. And don’t sell it to no one else but the main man up stairs.
Trump 2024
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Legit...I drove my 90 some chevy until the brakes stopped working around 2020's
My Son is going to love this, he has his Papaw's old Box Chevy.
I suddenly like country music again :)
Very real. Very at home. No politics. No bs. Just singin what we all think. Carry on brother!
Love my Ol Chevy Trucks !!!!!
Awesomeness! Much love from Pa! I have a Bobtail as well...keep it going brother!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB4VA8tWuM0  fiddle cover
This makes me want to buy a 90-something Chevy just for the experience he's singing about.
Dude, you need to sing with Stapleton.
This one ☝️
You're right around the corner from my home  Love you brother
America loves this dude.
You're a breath of fresh air, Appalachian style. Brother, keep doing you. There's not enough money in the world to let anyone else influence your music and what you sing about. You're songs are touching a lot of hearts and souls around the world. I believe you have a real chance at uniting people and making a difference. Peace, love and happiness to ya, brother.
Lol
Caramba. Mas como é boa essa música.
One of the best love songs I've ever heard.
Mi piace la tua musica. La realtà è ben diversa da quella raccontata dai media e dai politici. Una realtà sempre più vicina a quella italiana. Un abbraccio.
that was like a 2014 chevy in the video the hell man
i don’t even like country music, most of the time i find it absolutely abhorrent. but this, this sounds right. awesome stuff man. fuck the libtards!
Well done 👍
Happy Labor Day !!!
This man is special
this is my favourite one
I feel Johnny Cash is listening to this
More this dude puts out, less politics matter.  Real deal.
I wish i could go too
nice
Sounds good
Case of beer and a Zebco 303 haha
You have no idea how glad I am that your song became huge because now I have new favorite song writer, maybe one day I’ll make it your way an we can jam or better yet just be able to see you live. Your the man, keep doin you.
Awesome song!  Lots of heart in his music.
What a voice
I don't know if you'll read this or not, but here are my thoughts.  Clearly you have something.  But i worry about you limiting yourself artistically.  Seeing as how you are so early in your career it isn't a huge deal yet, but it may not be a bad idea to start experimenting with different sounds and subject matter to try to be more diverse in the type of songs you create and less formulaic in your structure.   But that is just something to keep in the back of your mind for now as it is also a good idea to establish a good base of fans with a consistent style brand they can rely on.   However you can only write songs about beer and trucks so many times :P
Your music hits my soul deep ❤
Chris look for Tom MacDonald. He's doing it on his own too. Maybe he has some sage advice for you
😉
Thanks for another awesome song!
this feller looks jus like me if i'd ever get a haircut (don't worry ladies - i wudnt dare). @oliveranthonymusic u got any relatives called granma sally?  yours truly, kleetis
Less is more. This is a case of such
How does one live in the woods? I love the woods and nature. However, calling them your home is another thing entirely. Mosquitoes, flies, snakes, coyotes, bear, skunks, raccoons, fox, opossum, crickets, grasshoppers, Bigfoot, etc. It takes a special persons to live in the woods, that’s all I’m saying. And I love this song!
Not a country fan, but that was beautiful, once again.
Simple heartfelt beautiful music that touches the soul. Your music speaks to the young people and us older folks. Keep making music your way.
I enjoy your music
Might be my new favorite song from oliver used to be doggone it
Represent us well brother ❤
Another amazing song keep it up ❤
90 Something Dodge with the 360 please do a cover I love your music and blast it all around town thank you sir for opening the eyes of millions of people
Love all your songs brother! Please don’t change a thing because you are perfect right now! Your soul, your message and your heart👍👍👍👍👍
I am just glad I am not you. Although you are me. Wish you godspeed brother.

Future looks bright. The libs already hate you…
Personally I believe Oliver Anthony is the best thing to happen to folk music since the guitar pick... 👀🗽🇺🇸
No vocal acrobatics, Just soul...... Wow! Pure as the driven Snow brother.
I remember my 90 something Chevy.  It was filled with pop cans that were supposed to go back to the store
Real country music 💯
Another beauty.
Beautiful! 🎶💙
This one is incredible
👍
This makes me wonder how many people listening even know what a 350 is.
I grew up a heavy metal and alternative Rock guy, NO rap or country. As I get older I see how much I missed. Country is pulling me in, the music is real and fans are good natured people.
This is perfect with just you and your guitar.  I don't want to listen to a band and mixed music, I can do that already.
Keep em coming brother I sing along to your songs full blast and my neighbors love it
It's now the 8th wonder of the world.  (Awesome  music)
This is actually my favorite song I have heard of his
I am so happy for this young man's success, bring us listeners such great material !! ThaNK You Oliver !!
It’s a shame the world is just now hearing your voice, but a blessing we finally get to. Can’t wait to see where your career goes, brother. You deserve it.
I live in a yurt too ♥
that guitar is a sweet piece
Keep doing it love it
Hi
True country music still exists! You started something in this nation brother! Truly amazing sound. I always look forward to whatever you put out next!
We love it chris keep it coming!!!
almost sold my 95 Chevy made me sick when i went to go sell couldn't find the title, There's nothing like hitting some back roads drinkin a beer and enjoying the scenery in and old truck all while listening to country and blue grass
This music goes straight to the soul 😌
Love ❤ it
No ladies he isnt proposing to random women.Sorry.
Someone on Anthony Oliver 2009 is catfishing using your stage name.Pretnding to be you
Amen brother
Love your message,and your music keep it coming
watch the media attack him
Buddy your killing it. Morgan wallen don't have shit on ya. Anyone who says otherwise don't know country or its roots. Doing it to look good, not to live.
Ahhhhhh country music is back!!!!!
Don't own a checy, but a Benz GT,    everyday is a struggle , and its only getting harder... Salute from the Motherland of Africa 🌍
Words sent from heaven
I always thought I didn't like country music..it turns out what I didn't like was pop music called country.
Great job, ginger tits. Keep promoting diversity like the Rich Men North of Richmond want.  Love how you only have a Siuthern accent when you sing.  Very authentic, very real.
❣❤❣
I sincerely hope this talented young man doesn’t fade into the realm of “one hit wonders”. He (you) definitely strike a chord (pun intended) with the silent majority. 👍
MAN YOU JUST DON’T MISS WHEN IT COMES TO WRITING SONGS!!!! I just have to say congratulations on all of the exposure because the things you sing about is what needs to be mass marketed instead of all of the degrading songs making it cool to degrade our women and killing each other and doings drugs and being in gangs!!!! You are the voice the people need to be hearing everyday and man have you done a good job on getting it out there…. 1.2 million views in 2 days is amazing and Rich Men North Of Richmond is doing that many times over!!!!
Keep making them tunes don’t listen to them haters.
I have one of them 90 sum  Chevy's too 😉
Regarding to his 90 Chevy    Like a rock
TALENT !   This man has a lot of it  !!!!
I love this guy's style and soul BUT I would love to hear his stuff done in a electric blues, rock and roll format. I can hear it in my head and it's smokin'
🤔💀👽
I love your music! God bless your footsteps.
Brother.... I don't know if you'll even read this but I can't tell you how I feel my soul singing to me with this!!!! Nelson county here, surrounded by pines. My wife is my reason to race home in my 90s GM, the dogs are home when I get there, smoke some home grown and find a river!!!! Man brother, we share an old soul! Next time you're on Rt.29....hit me up!!!!!
Prayer works. So, apparently someone had been praying for some real and actual country music.... Prayers answered.
IM GLAD COUNTY IS BACK!
My new favorite song!  My husband has an old Chevy...❤
❤❤❤
Perfectly Imperfect. Amazing. Keep your ears filled with golden music! Well done Sir.
I had a 94 Chevy Suburban with a 350....and it was sweet...
One of the most romantic songs I ever heard.    *sigh*
In Arizona, you’ll find a lot of Mexicans preserving these wonderful trucks. Whether it looks Patina or restored, has dents or leaks, they still run and get the job done!
You got great music man reminds me of bryan martin and zach bryan
I'm a 60 year old head banger of 70's and 80's metal, never thought I'd like music with "country" attached to it.....  *You sir, have my ear!*
Sang it baby... your are talkin about my life in Tallapoosa Georgia...love u man. Dont stop and dont change. ❤❤❤😂
This is real country, I’ll pause my rap for the first time for this man.
Another great song straight from the heart. Much love from Texas!
Suberb singing and music but those sharp uncut strings are not good.
Your music is incredible.
Been listening to country music since the '80s and stopped a number of years back when the music left me cold. You are an absolute breath of fresh air, and I love it...
Got a 94’ Chevy Silverado dually, he’ll yeah brother, sing it from the heart.
Going to be married 10 years this December. This song brought happy tears to my eyes. Felt like it reached out and touched me.
CIA videos have high production value.
God will often use the simple things to inspire, and give us hope and joy. He is doing this with you, and your music, Brother. Thank you.
Love the song but my Baby is a 70 some Cadillac! WOOOOO!
This is real country music
I´ve always loved country and folk music, it carries so much love and soul, no artificial flavours, just pure and authentic feeling - good job Mr. Anthony 🙂
I like it! Good stuff! I miss my 95’ Z71
Keep up the hard you put your soul in the music love it
This is damn good work,  sir!  The Carter & Cash line made me smile so big.
love the soul that comes out through your tunes. thanks for keeping music alive and speaking to the hearts of all of us all over the world.
Wow!  Well done!
Wonderful song my guy. Thank you for being you.
💎💎💎🖤💎💎💎✊🏿✌🏿
great fella
Is there a way to put up high resolution or CD downloads up on your own website? Then we could purchase downloads directly from you.
As if 90s chevy trucks weren't expensive enough, now they'll be that much more costly now.
The truck in the video is a GMC.
Creek?? I figured you would be a crick kinda guy
Zen Kōan? One with nature? Nice, man. Thanks
Nice!
👍❤️
Interesting to see if he gets political in '24 and chooses Biden.
Oliver, thank you for sharing your soul. God is faithful...the only thing that doesn't fail. You're a blessing to many through your words and heartfelt music. Keep doing what matters to you.
❤️‍🔥
Oliver does it AGAIN!!!!  You are the man bro, don't stop preaching. STAY HUMBLE!!!
As with the rest of your music, I love the lyrics, the sound, and the way everything you sing about relates to my own life! Keep doing exactly what you are doing brother! We love it!!!
Great song.
Your style of songs is similar to the "Hillbilly Thomists", a group of Dominican Friars and Brothers from the Dominican Order, singing and writing this style of songs.  Give a listen, just look up "Hillbilly Thomists"
Keep up the great work. Jesus has done great things in your life. God bless
Love it #teamchevy
meh... your next one should be called 'backwoods turncoat' or sumthin'
It is true,   Sometimes less is more.
❤
When you put this much genuine heart and soul into the music it resonates across the spectrum.  It also exposes the 'synthetic' overproduced studio garbage that passes for "music" today.
good stuff - keep making music Chris
Another great song with feeling
What a bop
I love this guys songs and his voice. Sad thing is all his songs sound the same just with different lyrics
Mine was an Old 70's Chevy with a 350 4 bolt main I had for over 20 years, had the wife now for 17
Not half bad for a Democrat.
Obviously he's resonating with tons of people. More of the Dylan/Nelson type of music in so much as touching people lyrically and emotionally.
Nice solo acoustic music here, it has a down to Earth feel - this in my opinion taps into the roots of American folk and country music. I think many people find that the modern recordings which rely a lot on vocal filters, synthetic percussion, and technological processing are lacking the "soul" that older popular music had. I feel there is a place for both simple acoustic music and for the modern digital processed sounds, and I like to record my own music and cover songs with just live guitar and vocals, which gives it a raw, more intimate vibe.
Love your style and originality. Don’t change anything. You can’t improve on perfection.
Not my taste but at least this is real country music. Not like these lame girly boys like Luke Bryan or Jason Aldean.
I love this song! #wigirl
Love you man, I'm a blue collar worker too and rich men north of richmond really gave me some sort of recognition
I don’t think hank done it that way
I have asked myself if you are one of the witnesses…. Coming to spread a message of surrendering to the lord.
I love it!! People are already making videos of how to play your music so you must be extremely proud!
Im so happy Rich Men went viral .. your work is awesome...
Hell yea 🤘🏻
I have disliked country music for 67 years but MY ears love this guy and my brain is going no,no..My ears won. Happy I gave him a chance..my pleasure.
Now he’s the rich man south of Richmond 👊🏻
Song name?
God has given Oliver an amazing gift! The world can feel the words, really hits home. His voice is smooth and soulful. God bless you man & thank yiu for sharing your gift with us! God speed! #FJB
love it
Glad Rogan got to him before Trashville.
You are an extremely talented song writer and performer.  Your passion for what you are doing shines through and I so much enjoy your music.❤
Everything sounds better in the woods. Keep making music and I'll keep listening brother
The new “counter culture” is here and Rolling Stone ain’t  a part of it.
Love it. Keep ‘em coming brother.
this is good song!
Good Stuff 👍🇵🇷
This is the greatest song ever
Amazing.
Your my favorite artist to date !!! Your music gives me the chills and cheers me up and i havnt had the chills or been cheerful in a long time i just wanna get in the truck turn it up and cruise
Your music is so classic yet novel. Refreshing. You gotta link up with Colter Wall.
This is new Bob Dylan!
Yanno I'm straight and have a girlfriend that I love very much, but this man's voice gives me weird feelings 🤣🤣🤣
Thank Jesus for something that's real:)
Thank you for sharing your story with us
I have a 1990 Silverado with a 350 and it sounds great and it doesn't beep at you if you don't have your steat belt on.
It’s nice that you got happy music in there too
Yeah, but it’s okay to think about a new truck sometimes.
Anthony you have so inspired me thanks for your music.
Wow!!! I luv this song!!
lmao 90% of comments are not even from the US smh hillarious- dont even know what a 350 is
Thanks for sharing your talent with the world. Praying you get all the blessings and it doesn’t change you in ways you don’t want. Sending love and gratitude
It's nice to finally hear something like what we all grew up too. God bless you man.
Some drum will do this justice
Chris keep writing these great songs.
The talent and passion aside, this is not novel nor the springboard for revolutionary awakening. If you needed a bluegrass song to wake up to the collapse of the empire, you are the problem.
2007 I was 16 years old, my first truck was a 91’ Chevy step side. PawPaw bought it new in 91, same year I was born. That 90 Some Chevy with the old 350 means a lot to me.
Beautiful and soulful
As a daily driver of a 90 some Chevy I approve of this message
Great song, I expect to hear your tunes in a movie some day soon.   Never change, stay true to yourself and your dreams become your life.
Mines an 89
I love to read tbe comments and see the spectrum of people around tbe world touched by the music! God bless him for being true!
I'd love to hear a version of this with a full band, bass and drums and a steel string, uptempo. Your voice is so great.
Goes to show that Heartfelt say it like it is country music still lives.  Can't stand that country got taken over by the Pop  music culture and convinced folks that don't no better, that this is new country. Keep it up Mr. Anthony.
I’m in the backwoods of VA, and I would love to record you!  ProTools Certified.
This is real music
americans should find their common sense culture again, all the woke culture pushed by US is messing up not just the US but because it projects soft power also the world
Seriously.. this is good .
Great music. Words that hit just right. Stay real.❤
Awesome. Cheers from Oz.
Just simply, thank you.
you are literally one of the greatest artists of the generation already shit is wild
Wow....one hit wonder my ass
This sounds like something an early Chris Stapleton would of written. Absolutely brilliant!! Just what country music needs right now. Authenticity.  Hank would be proud. Listening to your music here in the UK, and we own a 94 Silverado 350. Just a great, great country song. I'm gonna check out your other music, see if anything has made a fuss 😂 👍👍👍
Love your music. So much heart and soul in every song you create, allowing us to feel the emotion behind every lyric. Thank you for allowing us to experience your art. You are truley an outstanding artist. God blessed you, and may he continue blessing you.
If I was ahead of that chevy corporation, I would pay you a shit load of money to do my commercials because you are an American hero you say it like it is and you don’t sell out keep it up all over America is listening, so is the world
This man knows love...
This gives me home vibes. Soothens my soul/spirit...
Another hit
If Chris can stay authentic and true to his roots he'll forever be considered a American hero.
Looking forward to a album
wow what a great song
What a man turning down that money and fame
1:20 👍
unite american fuck DC
You are killing it all over the place 👍
Awsome. Man you have an amazing talent. Some of the most heart felt song writing ive ever heard. Sending love from the UK. Keep it up bro
I gotta 92’ chevy!  Unique voice.  Impressive.
As real as it gets, brother. Keep it up! 👊😎🎵
Bro can't miss
Love from Nz, man I gotta tell ya, a decent 90s Silverado costs a fortune here.
My speakers bleeding brother keep coming out with music man 🫡
It was a 90 some Ford Escort for me. Good times
Chill bumps brother man.
your music is beautiful - thanks a lot for sharing.
Beautiful 🙂❤️🙏
I just saw your interview ... even when you speak you sing....  with heart, your soul and your wisdom.
I mean those were the best trucks ever built.
Love this!  💕
It’s nice to see a regular guy do well. Congratulations sir! 👍🏻🙏🎸
i hope you're monetizing your channel man. Turn on the ads.
🎉🎉🎉
Got a nicer truck than I lmao ain’t doing bad as many
"She rides just right when you turn her on." Phenomenal line. The song spoke more volumes as it went on. your music has a definite build, never repetitive, always doing something new with each verse/progression. Lots of soul. - Love from Maryland!
This song feels like home, man...
The whole song was great. But, that "Running Up To Kiss Me" verse locked me up brother😎 Thanks again for all your music.
I'm pretty sure that chevy in the video is much newer than 90 something  Shoulda found a 90's chevy truck for this video lol. Or got that one sittin in the weeds goin
Would love to hear you sing with First Aid Kit and all of your acoustic guitars! Would be great. all the best!
another hit to me personally man, i push myself so hard at work, doin the overtime. fishing for days on the ocean, flying out to the mines when the fish season ends. and it gets hard, but when i see my girl smile, hug and kiss her at the end of the day, go on road trips thru the Australian Country. i know its worth it at the end of the day. Thank you for blessing the world with your Talent man <3
Your music always hits home with me. It's wonderful that you received so much support from everyone.
The Real Deal😎
Nobody (not even Oliver Anthony himself) can tell me he's NOT a Conservative and a anti Biden, anti liberal Democrat. I will not believe it.
This man’s songs resonate like nothing else. This is what country used to be. Humble. Authentic. From the heart.
🔥🔥I am YouTube chenal 🔥🔥 🔥🔥my Tack chenal 🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥mere chenal se apko shayta mil sakti hai 🔥🔥                     🔥🔥nice video🔥🔥🔥
You are doing well 😊
you're amazing man so happy for you
WOW I'm speechless 😍, God bless you brother, keep strong.
I love the natural sound of your voice...keep doing what your doing...Great song writer 👏👏👏
Oliver Anthony music is pure old school Americana…Roots music for your soul!
Every single song is just so solid, that's for the vids and good music brother!
The bumpkin accent is thick.
Could someone explain the perfect haircut, yet the beard is allowed to run wild? It's like washing and waxing your car from the door handles forward. The back is left to fend for itself. I don't do the beard thing so I can't advise in reference to the acceptable ratio.
The hearts  Sing  with  you  all  over  the  planet 💗united 🤗
Irish, working father from Belfast Ireland here, man this song just seems to have so much meaning to my life, I can't even explain it. Love your stuff man, absolutely love it.
Nice song man. This is what country is: America's folk music -- better known as the blues. Old school "black" country was called "Rythm and Blues" whereas "country" was the label for "whites' who were singing the good-old country blues. Keep bringing it Chris.
He’s the juice Wrld of country
This dude is gifted.Amazing tune and voice.
😎
Loving the music brother. Not even my kind of music but I like all I have heard from you Sir. Keep doing what your doing! I'll keep listening 🎶
Please continue.
Got your music playing in front my yard on Ouhu, Hawaii. 🍻
Finally, something that isn't depressing
I like it a lot.
Thank you
Great song. Your voice is magic.
Great voice nice song
my favorite of all his songs I've heard so far.
Oliver Anthony is evidence of God’s grace. I’ve experienced it myself. For this reason I feel that forgiveness is what would heal society. God forgives us as an example of how we should forgive one another.
Dam this song is amazing
The people's poet of the early 21st century. Dillon 60 years later. I was a kid then, but Oliver makes me feel the same way in an old man nostalgic way.
Chris, can you clarify the lyric after the line about a case of beer. Apparently everyone hears something different. Lol
Not bad. The folksie car stuff and poor white boy themes will strike a chord with conservatives, unfortunately I grew up in urban steel country with a diverse working class. Then I got a world class education, saw, taught, worked and did research on three continents. No, I didn't leave my roots behind, I still have them but I also grew many new ones. The most difficult thing to learn is, yes it's OK to be YOU, but there are many other yous out there. That's hard to see without some experiences beyond yourself.  You've got talent! Now use it to heal what divides us, maybe?
Keep it up buddy!! Thank you
I am very happy for you sir.  Thanks for doing the interview with Joe Rogan patriot!
Was that a 1911 or a 2011?
Congrats! Looks like you got yourself another hit...
Miss my 99 k1500 i had in high school had a old 350 small block in it. So many memories with that old girl may she rust in peace 🤟
man i havent been rooting for someone to get crazy rich in a long time, a breath of fresh air sir godspeed
Probably has the Vortec heads and the roller block. Pull that crappy TBI add a cam, intake and carb.
That's some fine pickin right there
Beautiful song. People in Maui were zapped.  Sing about them. Your land is next. You didn't ask for this. But we don't choose our place in this world.  RIGHT? LORD KNOWS. CMON CHRIS. MAUI NEEDS YOU.
Man I love everything you're putting out Chris (Oliver)!❤ You're healing a broken world ! Feel free to use that as a title to the next song "Healing a Broken World " . Thank you!    Songs That Pierce through the Heart And Bond With Your Soul
As a chevy man, i approve
We have Bon Iver at home.  Bon Iver at Home*
I'm going to get on it!!! :)
That’s what every real American is missing.  Real America like it used to be. Dam the corrupt politicians 🖕🏻
Excellent song...I felt like a 3rd wheel!👍
I’m looking at my 82 Chevy truck listening to this thinking how things changed. We can fix it.
why cant this man speak for us instead of youtube or taylor? I mean I love taylor but this man is fire
Love your voice Oliver!  I’m glad your getting the attention you deserve.😊
Jeez a icon legend in the making
keep it up man you rock
I drive a 83 some Chevy Chevette.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Still my new favorite singer! Would love to go to one of your concerts!
This man has a great voice !
Stay independent, stay in the light, thank you for sharing your gifts with us!
Thank you Mr Chris Oliver Anthony may God bless you with what ever would make you an your family happy thank you for your music I can tell it comes from a beautiful scared soul
Love this guy's music.
👏👏🙏🇧🇷🇧🇷
Chris, hope you find everything you deserve in life.  Keep being you!!
so good! that truck and some dogs , maybe some fishing gear.
👏 👏 👏
I feel like the comments are tons of people realizing how "overproduced" country music today is. It's downright shocking for people to hear what actual "country" music sounds like
@oliveranthonymusic keep crushing it.  You sing from the soul. I live here in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦  and as driving/traffic is crazy stressful here, we love listening to your music while sitting in the car with my children. It's calming and speaks to all of us. Keep turning out bangers on that resonate guitar!
Anthony Oliver here love the music
Thank you Oliver. For everything.
That is a fun song to listen to. Good job Chris.
Love your music!
A case of beer and a zebco.....maaaan.......👍👊
Really digging what you’re doing, and most importantly, keeping your faith first. Much love brother! 🇺🇸❤️
I know you used to grandfather's name anthony. Good luck, chris
These videos are awesome, can’t get enough dude, big fan from northwest Georgia 💯👍
If you ever make it to Hawaii......I'll buy you a beer.
Anthony,  Please sing out a " Sittin' on the dock of the bay - Ottis- with that plenum, you've got it! Only if you want man. It'd hit the soul.
THANKS GOOD TUNES CHRIS .
God Bless you!  Be the voice of the many……
There's hope for country music after all! Finally! So tired of the Luke Bryans and the "hip hop country"
Nashville sold its soul long ago
Authentic….. you can’t package that!
Keep on trucking like a 90 some Chevy! God bless America!
Wow I didn’t realize that i even liked this style of music all I can say is thanks
This song’s better than “rich men” 😊
All of your songs are red white and blue, 90 some Chevy is newer than I had;) Thank you man!
This makes me want to work on my Blazer!!
We need a Chris Stapleton colab
Another fantastic song!  Oliver Anthony you are amazing👍🏻
I love my wife. I love my 90 some Chevy and I love this song brother.
Keep it going brother!!!!! Listening all my troubles away !!!!
Poet. Soul. Pure country. George Jones'd be proud. "Who's gonna fill them shoes?" You are, my brother.
👍
love every single one God bless your sweet heart
Keep them coming brother I wanna come see ya soon. Love the story as I can relate so easily. Fire ass song btw every man needs a good woman and good truck I couldn’t make it without mine 😂.
Sooo good!!! Man you're talented Chris!!!!
Love it, but I'll admit I have a soft spot for the one on Spotify before this. It's got a rougher,  dirty, front porch feel.
Just simple 90 Chevrolet 👍
Watching keep it up
We need more man. I need more. You are passionate about your music and it is much appreciated. Remind me alot of Neil Young and the music he made.
Please, please, don't ever get tainted by Nashville. Be you, and play your music!! Thank you sir!!!
Crazy beautiful music man. I’m glad someone real from the country made it.
Ive noticed when you get in that zone you turn um out like cattle to an alfalfa field. GOOD STUFF BROTHER ROLL A FEW OF THOSE TWISTY TREATS AND KEEP UM COMING ^5
This was definitely studio recorded. It’s not recorded in the woods
A simple man singing the thoughts of simple men.
Sure hope Oliver keeps doing what he is doing.   These songs are much more relevant than the disco-rap-hipster trash being churned out by the east coast elites that control Nashville, country radio and the recording studios.  Sooo tired of hearing Morgan Wallen singing "last night we robbed a liquor store".
these rich elite have had their run. People are waking up to the slave system they are trapped in. It's our TURN NOW!, *God bless all the hard working people reading this comment today*  😍😍
Ugh, makes me wanna go drink a cold beer out in the woods. ❤
love you brother, thanks for this
And just like that a working man’s legend was made. Keep it going, brother. You’re killing it. Stay true to yourself we love it!!
My new favorite song..and I'm a person thts only said that once and it was when I heard this song..I rarely listen to music but been listening to this on repeat
"when half of my check goes into the tank"
Your hands down my favorite musician, God bless you
When I first heard Rich men it stopped me in my tracks and I listened to it a few times in a row,  you have a true gift man!  This song is great too! Cheers from Canada
I ain't even going to lie those Zebco Bullet are some of the best reels I've ever used. That's no bullshit. That Zebco Bullet is better than any baitcaster or spinning reel I've ever used.
This man can do no wrong. " She's my Carter and I'm her Cash. "  He is magic with his lyrics.
I love it! Great music!
Love this song!  I first heard it yesterday on Spotify while I was road tripping from VA to Wyoming.  I ended up listening to all your music on Spotify.
Absolutely awesome 🙌🏻🙏🏻🙌🏻
It is the simple TRUTH that people LOVE!
Absolutely fucking LOVE this. Keep ‘em coming.
This man is moving the hearts and minds of people across the world.. Thank you for sharing your soul with us. This type of music sends shivers down my spine. Keep doing your thing my friend 🙏
Take it Niiiiuce n sloooow. O.A. u po white trash. Lol😅
GOAT
I have a very similar tent. Except mine doesn't smell like butt love
Your music unites man. That's what we need. Don't stop playing man.
Great song Chris
Love it!  Really happy for ya brother, you’re an inspiration.  Stay true to your convictions and keep your eyes on Jesus and you’ll be just fine!
We Thank YOU, We needed your simple song that spoke volumes to the WORLD. You helped us get through the next day’s following. You may not comprehend why your music resonates to the world; But, We do. Just know you touched the world’s People. You give us hope, you give us something to smile about. There’s no better gift . Money can’t buy That gift.
Stay home we need you
Great song but a small guitar solo in the middle might be cool. Just a little one. I still loved it though.
Sounds like modern country lyrics wise. The depraved eat that stuff right up.
Dig it
One hell of a voice and true to the genre!  Old school country here!
You just made me smile. Love you dude
DON'T EVER SELL OUT! produce and distribute yourself never sell out to the soul snatching record companies
I was about to list my 90 k2500 for sale. Thinkn ima gonna keep it now!
Thank you for sharing your music with us
This guy can sing.
Lyrics:  That old darlin of mine is like a 90 some' Chevy  She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing sounds better than that old 350s when she's runnin up to kiss me, when I get home It's been a hard day, I'll tell ya darlin' it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs go listen to the frogs croakin' down in the creek We can take her nice and slow A case of beer and a zen cone Let the Sun sink good and low It Ain't no telling where we'll go in the back of that 90 some' Chevy In the back of that 90 some' Chevy  Well shes hotter than hell I'm higher than gas Shes sweeter than honey I'm poor white trash She ain't had a check That I couldn't cash I guess that she's my Carter Then I'm her Cash And I been sittin' around Drinkin' on it I guess that I'm gonna have to get me a ring and get it on it  Cause that old darlin of mine is like a 90 some' Chevy  She rides just right when you turn her on The only thing sounds better than that old 350s when she's runnin up to kiss me, when I get home It's been a hard day, I'll tell ya darlin' it's been a long week Might have to load up the dogs go listen to the frogs croakin' down in the creek We can take her nice and slow A case of beer and a zen cone Let the Sun sink good and low It Ain't no telling where we'll go in the back of that 90 some' Chevy In the back of that 90 some' Chevy  That old darlin of mine is like a 90 some' Chevy  She rides just right when you turn her on
Well, a Ford honey would love you stronger.
his soul is the being of our nation and he is the best singer i ever heard and he resonates to the culture. he is the best and his soul is woven in the fabric of the country.  He is like the constitution and is more important than one to we the people since Washington!
Keep on keepin' on brother. This is some damn fine music.
You are awesome, and you play and sing like it's meant to be! From New Zealand mate.....well done!
I love the branches and leaves you're hiding behind! Don't see that much in AZ!❤  Love your music, too!❤❤
shoot a real dang video
Love this song man it’s a good one 😊
just keep giving this world hell!!!!    you all everybody!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I still love your dogs!
keep on keeping on brother
I'm loving this one too, so talented.
🩵🌄🥰🎶
👏❤🙏   (How refreshing, too no synthesized music and vocals.)
Just make these videos. PLEASE DON'T SIGN!
Love the backdrop of the forest in this song.  It goes perfectly with the lyrics.  Looks like you live in God’s country.  Chris, your music is so down to earth and pleasing to listen to.  Thank you for sharing it with us.
What would be cool if Gene Watson get Oliver Anthony to tour with him I would go see both of them in concert
Keep it coming sir we enjoy it all and you have inspired more than you know
Great song! Keep it up brother! God bless you!
best song yet
Listening to this eating some fudge rounds
Brother keep up the good work with that wonderful music
🦅🦅🦅
With great power comes great responsibility. God has blessed you. Don't forget that.
I loved your interview with Joe Rogan. Your speaking & singing voice has an amazing resonance. I also loved seeing Jamey Johnson show up for you at the Farmer's Market. Your voices are uniquely similar and touching hearts and souls with authentic country music.🤠🎶🛻💗
I bought a 98 Chevy S10 sport package in October 1997 as soon as they came out.... It was sweet!
This is a new kind of music. His rhyme patterns and rhythm cycle are so fluid that one voice and one guitar develop a complexity that is as much psychological as it is auditory. Each stanza reaches for the cycle. Our thoughts are drawn to meaning as the eye is drawn by leading lines in canvas and photography. It is nuanced and blatant, sweet and smooth as habanero honey.
Blessings brother!
Can pop off a Marlboro to this one GGs
Got 2 90 something chevy!!! Hit it out of  the park god bless love what you stand for bud. Keep it up please
I really like this song. Nothing against radioWV of course, but I'm glad we can support you directly on this channel.
Finally! Some music I can relate to!
I'm hearing since Nora Jones influences in here. Really probably just jazz and blues influence, but the simple guitar and the slides on the voice really reminds me of Nora Jones.
Keep it up brother.
Lyric help please ..   "case of beer and a ? "  zem-cola?
You’re our voice brother, we’re all feeling it . May the Good Lord send you all the reward you need 🇦🇺
Well done. Love your music brother.    I’m curious about that holster. Can you share the make and model?
Like this tune 👏🎼
Haha shows him driving a 2007 plus Chevy.
Dang! I really enjoy his music. Such pure country.
Absolutely AMAZING!!!!
Thank you For being you.
You’re such a blessing young man, I pray to God your message and music 🎼 might bring this country around to where we need to be. God bless you mightily & God bless America! ❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Wonderful.
Keep making music the way you do. Your message is felt half a world away over here in Singapore too
You just keep on getting BETTER   !!!!
You're goin places, son.
Striking the right cord.
This dude is far more talented than just one song!
This man is will on his way to doing what Randy Travis  did for us that know what country music is.  Thank you  Mr Anthony
It your music is better then anything that's played on country radio this is exactly what country music should sound like not like this stuff on radio these days.
You are unbelievably talented. Literally my favorite artist. You're the next Johnny Cash my friend!
I prefer 80s squarebody chevys 😉 change the world brother. Goodluck with the opportunity of a lifetime👊🏽🍻
Brilliant— what else is new?  Love from Los Angeles
Put this against anything on the radio it’s not even close. Man is making real country music! Love that he’s getting his flowers
We doing alright here in Virginia with music. I can remember when hardly anywhere had people playing now it’s everywhere this guy grew up 45 min away and we close to the same age what a inspiration thanks man for producing good down home music
Awesome
A case of beer, a creek, frogs and an old Chevy. Geez that brings back beautiful memories.
well done friend, very well done!!!
Just so loving his music.  It's so real.  Keep it coming!
This is absolute gold
Please don’t change brother. Just a down to earth guy singing some good ass country music. Keep up the good work , we got your back !
❤
Dang hes better than any country singer.

Awesome ain't enuff for his talent. Oliver is a God Send🎵🎵🎵🎵
You are a poet for the people.
Nioce tune fa sho
It is so refreshing to hear some real country again. Keep it up young man.!!
Keep likin this fella more...
Are your videos not monetized? I didn't see an ad.
Hell yeah!
I's raised a Chevy boy! I've had four trucks. An ol' 86' squarebody in HS. Lotta good memories in that one! A couple of  bulletproof S-10s, and now a mid-size Colorado. All been good doggies, LOL =)
l wish I was 20 years younger. This man is an old soul and needs a good woman to let him know what his worth is.
My first truck was an 86 Chevy. Way better than the 90 somes were!😂
Oliver your like an absolute breath of fresh air I love your words and music.   I'm a 75 year old Australian who's loved American country since before it was called county music back in the Hillbilly Music days.
Love this song man
Love it. But it was a 70's Chevy for me.
Another hit.  I love it!
Keep going brother!  YOU are in there!
New microphone. Nice! Getting better audio now.....
Just raked a bunch of hay, baler broke down....another day on the farm. Come home to my wife, daughter, homemade soup, dogs, cold beer and this song. Spot on.
Son,  you brought me back to the best days of my life, in the woods and driving a good 350 and the man that built it.
It's just plain and simple good music. That is what makes it as good as it is. Or, I should say it is as good as a 90 Some Chevy.. I miss my 90 Some Chevy. She was a great girl.
Bless you and your beautiful soul brother 🙏
Great now 90 some Chevys are going to be expensive! Lol
Me and you are not so different.
Well Chris, I can only hope your new found fame treats you as good as your songs treat us listeners.  Music is as close to real magic as me get, and I'm completely content with that.  Thanks fella 💚.
Oh brother were art thou 2 , this better be the soundtrack.
Another great song! Keep ‘em coming
I hope Rogan bought him a new truck
Wow! Montreal Canada here. Who is this guy??!! I'm all in and not really a country kind of guy but like I said, I'm all in, big fan and I guess this is what real music is like. It's been awhile.....
Listening to this an hour ago you had 850k views. I love your music and your story brother god bless you and your family
Finally some real country music
Hope for all the best for you. I hope you were able to pay off your loan on you land and fix the roof in our camper and I am sure much more.  Don't let them ruin your authenticity! You deserve all the success.
Thank you brother.  Very nice
What a funking ledgend 😢does it to me every time
That's right, Brother !!!!!
What about a 80's Dodge... way better truck ..   Just saying  "m:)
I don't think his music would sound the same in a studio!
Keep it up brother sing from the heart
Droppin a comment to push this. Great song, nothing greater than a 90somthin Chevy!
Another great hit 🎉
Awesome 👏
Damn good song
Do it for Dale #3
congratulations on your success - P.S., I drive an '89 Buick!
❤️❤️❤️
Sing us an old hymn!
Love this guy don't sell out brother you're awesome don't let them suck you into that corporate record s***
I knew you'd be a GM man 👌
Bagger bro … enjoy the life that you’ve been given you’re going to be a millionaire whether you want to be one or not. God bless you my brother enjoy the money. Do some good with it and that you don’t have to work so hard you’ve been blessed with a good talent that just makes a lot of money.
What is being sung after "case of beer"? I've tried closed caption and looking at lyric videos but neither seem right. Is it Zebco? Like the fishing rod?
Great stuff
Stay independent forever, my brother. Another burner.
I dont do social media rage but thanks man. Its refreshing.
Brother you said there's better singers and musicians than you. I'm not either but real is real, you can't fake it, and you're IT!!!
I find it so funny that the cultural liberal elites in America said that people like Oliver Anthony were parochial and lacked global appeal. Meanwhile, Anthony is blowing up because most of the world can relate to his religious conservative values whether Christian, Muslim, or Jewish.
I've never been a fan of country music (though my mom has liked it for years), but this is really so cool and vibey! 😍
from the birth place of country music!!!   A truck was driving around this past Friday with your song blasting - it sounded so good!!  Everyone in hearing distance was cheering!
You just can't write a bad ol'e song buddy.
Ya boy! Keep puttin'em out!
👍👍
More. More. More. Keep feeing us Chris!!!!
What tent is that???
one millionth view, wow, proud of you dude you've came a long way.
This song is better than Rich Men imo. Rich Men just resonates with so many millions of Americans…
I have an 84 Chevy c30 👍lok
Proves you are not a one hit wonder.  You are the real thing.
@ Oliver 🙏🏼you’re words r how we ALL feel 👍
Nice song. Stay away from politics and confusing social commentary.
I'm speechless with this one. Took me directly back to the nineties and some incredible memories. One incredible song.
This one is a lot better than the Richmond one. Can't deny the soul. Just lay off the people on welfare bro. We're all struggling in some way.
We are lucky that this music was discovered and not kept to this great artist!
Never lose your fire, my Friend... this world needs your gift.  Thank you, for sharing your craft
I live on a lake north of Spokane Wa in a rural area, and you wouldn't believe how many times I have heard you blaring from the speakers in their boats. People just love you. You have become their voice❤
I don’t care about his politics or who he votes for, but I am disturbed that he loves Chevy this much, but thats the great thing America, we can all have terrible opinions on 350s 😂
👏🤙🍻🍻🍻🍻 yeahhhh!    Fk ya!!!!!
As a Chevy guy who also lives in the hills of West By God Virginia- I love this song! Just bought a ‘76 Chevy van! Keep killing it!
BE TRUE AND WIN
I like how you're anti-political in general. Politicians are the architects of our dysfunction.
Here in Brazil we now have a leftist government but many here in the southern part of the country are precisely like Americans simple people, like American Farms workers, and we have the same big problems as you and fight against a modern and stupid world like you.   Here, few speak and understand English but for me, your Music has a great meaning.  By the way, my truck is an American Ford Ranger 22-year-old.
I have a 99 Silverado.  Smh. lol.
Very nice! ❤
Great song !
And he puts put another fire 🔥 song thanks Chris for putting your heart and soul into your music.
Hell of a song man hang in there
another great one
My last name is Carter and I an kin to June distantly I am from SwVA near carter's fold
This is music the way it was meant to be.  Keep it Real, keep it Raw.  Don't let anyone change you.  You are the antidote to our crazy mixed-up world.
Please make a song about the government controlling people the government holding people down the government keeping people locked up and that we should all resist this
Another great one Sir... When is the vinyl dropN I gotta get me one...
Hey brother I work 500 miles from home to provide for my family.....I know im not alone...We all srtuggle but i hope your struggle is over.....Tell you one thing ...the linemen are riding with you and we are ride or die....stay humble and all the best to you
you are my favorite singer by far!! keep being you!
Brother I swear I had a bad day today, I put your music on in the truck and heard this song! I listened to it over and over, got home and there is my wife standing on porch, she asked me " is everything ok" I said it is now. Thanks brother!
Oliver Anthony is a breath of fresh air.
Another great song. You're not a one hit wonder. You're a true singer songwriter with soul and well thought-out imaginative lyrics.
Bro I’ll listen to you sing the phonebook keep’em comin.
beautiful song ♥
This man has it going on, 2nd ....
Ole 350 hit me
You’ve all been fooled.  He’s lip syncing to a studio recorded track.
I soooo needed all of this, right now.
keep up the good work..youre a rare breed dont sell out
Dude  stfu same shit different  day   Learn layers
I'm from England and this is weirdly the single best most relatable song I've ever heard in my fucking life ❤
That was so sweet of you to write a song about me!
What kind of guitar is that?? I want it so bad!!
I hope you make millions without the record companies on your own terms .  God bless you my friend.  God sent your music at the right time.  Thats what He does.
It gets even Better!? What the fuck Chris! Sumbitch sounds legendary...
Redbar is watching
But I love him
3 chords and the TRUTH   BY GOD
Same chords
All his songs sound the same. Same key?
Your music scratches a part of my brain that makes me feel good. Thank you!
Something about "poor white trash" that pulls at my heart strings.
For some reason  I think george jones would have killed this song if he was still here, sounds like a hank jr  shoulda wrote this song
bringing old contry back.
2nd best song you made congrats!
THE PERSON WHO IS READING THIS COMMENT I WISH YOU GREAT SUCCESS   HEALTH  LOVE AND HAPPINESS! 💕💗
Amazing song
Dog shit song
Love that you are re-recording the songs you recorded on your phone!
Im here because Variety magazine are a bunch of communists.   And I also generally like his witty music. Im waiting for a “Cobwebs and Cocaine” video.
Another heater ladies and gentlemen!
Man I would love to see you and RICKY SCAGGS TOGEATHER that would be a HOEDOWN
Now imagine this already awesome song with a full band behind him...drums, a bass etc...WOW!!!
Oliver your the only country music I like... Thanks for the Experience
I really like this one Chris.
Been a while since a musician sang from the soul. Makes me feel like I’m listening to todays Johnny Cash.
awesome,  took me to a great place
Why not just record yourself playing your guitar standing in the woods without the ruse that this song is actually being recorded there?  I love the aesthetic of a country boy just playing on his property with his dogs as it fits the music well; but I also feel like showing a microphone in the video when the track was not recorded in the woods makes it seem a bit fake or forced.  It isn't possible to get crisp and clean recordings outside with all of the ambient noise and especially the small air movements across the mic; even with the very best equipment available.  I've played guitar for half of my life and while I love the music you're putting out, I feel the videos would be better if they didn't give the impression that this was recorded in the woods.  This exact video without the microphone in the shot just feels like a better choice to me.
Amazing again don't stop.
Sir, your Representation is 🔥
Dogs will keep you grounded if you take care of them so they are balanced and listen them. Follow thier lead. Oliver keep those dogs close.
This guy is bringing back real country music.  One hell of a songwriter, musician, and singer.
Someone said there was an image of a gun in this video? So you see one?
*You have to love a woman with some meat on her bones, and love an engine that you can give it your all*
My favorite song is I wanna go home
Been following, listening from Rison Arkansas 🤟♥️
you made it bro make your own rules now.
Beautiful song.  I like it. I had a 90 some Lumina. She ran sweet. Cloth bench seat.  ❤
If you drive a Ford you're obviously an idiot!
HIT AFTER HIT
This song is brought to you by anyone that can rebuild a 700r4... On a real note Oliver has it figured out.
Please don't get dragged down to the bottom of the ocean and eaten by sharks. Be careful. They will steal your soul. Put God first.
3rd one down on the playlist. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOfZLb33uCg&list=RDMM&index=18 IS that offensive?
I think too much love IS asked of me, uss
this guy fucks... cars
Oliver, your music is so different it’s your own brand. Kinda like Frank Foster, oilfield hand to independent singer songwriter. I appreciate you.
You are more real and current than anything that's on the radio right now, heck, than what's been on the radio in a very long time!! You sing with so much soul and conviction that it grabs your listeners each and every time they hear you!! You don't need all the fancy stuff!! You are enough, just you and your guitar! That's all we ever want. You and what you are giving us right now!! Always!! We are always waiting on the next nugget!!
All those songwriters in Nashville that try to come up with clever little ditty lyrics that have no guts or authenticity, this is the water that quenches your thirst. But this is from a well only He has to drink from. Oliver's not copying anyone.  Dear Oliver, don't put your feet in the murky water that looks like glass. Everybody will come along trying to tell you what will make you better... you're already better... stay honest, stay clean, and stay away from the record business machine.  Great songs
up
Great song! 👏🏻 DON’T sell out! Stay in your backyard and hardly leave 🎉
Loving your music and it warms our hearts all the way up here in Iceland 🇮🇸 -Where many are cold and few are frozen 🤭😂 Be Blessed in Jesus name 🙌
I love it!
I had a girl like a 70 some chevy, took a bit of choke just to turn her on
Man, you're writing some good stuff.  We write from the suffering, some physical, some mental.  I was going through a divorce, homeless, driving a borrowed car, with a $1.67 in my bank account.  I still started a company, and I ain't homeless, driving a borrowed car, and have a few more dollars than a two dollar bill.  I wouldn't trade anything for it and the songs. Well, they rolled out, Redemption, Lost Down Here, etc.  I got to write with some great award winning writers and never made a dollar from them, or cared to - which, if I'm a betting man, is probably a lot like you are doing.  Anyway, I bought a few tunes to keep that 90 Chevy with a little gas money.
Thanks for sharing brother👍
Yes. You're like the best singer rn. Overnight.  God bless you.
90s squares body isn’t cheap, it’s as much as a truck from 2011 now- rewrite the song bum!!
thank you for sharing more of your music with us, Chris.  You're a man of our time and Your voice is healing many people in this crazy world.  keep up the good work my friend.
Awesome job again Chris!
I don't get the big deal about this guy, one on every street corner in Nashville, I'd rather listen to paint dry
Wow, I don[t even like country music but you're killing it. Love the sound, the authenticity, and the soul.
HUSBAND FROM FARMVILLE VIRGINIA BORN AND BREED
What a beautiful song! True American music. Bravo Oliver! 👏👏
🔥
Nothing but hits God Bless this man.
I’m from the deepest darkest jungles of Peru. Yet this still speaks to me.
Keep your circle small, don’t ever sell your soul brother, you are super talented!  Best of luck with everything!
So glad to hear ya still doin watcha love ! 👍👍🙏👏Ephesians 6:10-18

I haven't heard a bad song from this man yet!  Amazing!!
In 1976 I gave birth to a baby girl in the back of a Chevrolet. I named her Vrolet. Joy of my life❤
I hear Ya Brother ! Had a 1960 Chevy in perfect condition until the woman i was datings ex boyfriend snuck up and poured a bag of sugar in the gas tank and slit the tires ! I heard some noise outside the next evening had some sweatpants cut into shorts on and At the door was a pair of slippers in the shape of bunny rabbits so i slipped them on , sure enough here comes Roger walking down the ROCKY driveway dressed in his Biker dudds ya know full leather razorblades etc. And here i am sweat shorts and bunny slippers ! He ran at me like a Bull on a revenge campain ! I grabbed his leather and fell backwards flipping him behind me with my legs and feet but oW on those big white pointy rocks ! Good thing i had Waskily Wabbit slippers on cause he was a Wascal and bigger than me. I finally got him on the ground and commenced to pounding him out a new grill !  BC days ! 😁 next day his parole officer said looks like he got hit with multiple door knobs do you want to press charges Sir . I said no just want him to stay away from her and her daughter. He said i'll make sure he won't come around there anymore.He made good on his promise But i Sure miss that ol Chevy Truck ! Not so much the people !! ✌🎸
thank you!
Why isnt this 90k should be 100k.  🤝   much respect , and Blessings 🙌
Damn… Love every single single you’ve released. Release a CD and I’ll buy.
Your voice mate. Wow 👌  Thank you for making me feel alive again. 🎉
🙏

There is nothing more pure, more right, more genuine than you.  Hold your head up, and trust our heavenly Father as he leads you.
@ Dave sayer 🤷‍♂️lol
@ godsavers? 👍
Dude I love your vibe 👍🙏🏼have a beer w ya anytime 🌿🌬️🙏🏼
There’s so much SOUL he puts in his songs it’s amazing
i still got that ol 95 chevy….
Did it again
I own a Chevy and I approve this message...
Your music makes my life in Canada almost worth living.. Thanks brother keep up the great work and stay true to yourself. At the end of the day that's all we truly have.
Doing your music just the way you are will absolutely take you further than any of the greedy creep head record label agents ever could in TRASHVILLE,SPEW YORK, or CRAPPYFORNIA .  Awesome work and you’re telling our average Joe stories with great precision friend.
I remember my first truck, it was a 1995 Chevy stepside. She was a beauty. I also remember when Oliver Anthony broke the internet in 2023. It was a beauty.
I am so happy for this guy he makes damn good music
Lyrics are inspired and the performance is very satisfying. Keep it up brother. Love from penal colony Australia.
“I guess she’s my Carter, then I’m her Cash” is such a great line. So true.
You'll get a million
I love you. You are great
I feel some Old 80s Hank Jr vibes .  Anyone else hear it ?  I Think it's AWESOME!  Keep digging Son . God is Good
Keep up the good work
Best love song ever written.
Got one that is excited to see me when I get home n I got 2 "90 some" chevys.
Amazing song Chris🙏🏻 Keep being true to yourself
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Nice apiece you're carrying in truck is that a 1911? Another classic like the Chevy
Your music is amazing keep it up!🇺🇸
I know people talk about your voice and your musical style you're as iconic as Merle Haggard
Keep up the great work. Your are an All-star singer. And talented musician. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🍻🍻
Kick ass music. Keep it coming!
Sweet.  Gonna take the missus around the floor to it after dinner.
I think it sucks.
this whole vid looks crazy ideal.. no wonder.
She rides just right when you turn her on. Dam great writing.
Awesome!!! I love it ❤❤
He’s good but not good enough to be anything other then a one hit wonder.
Man that line really gets me. I guess if she's my Carter then I'm her Cash.  Really was there a more committed couple during one lifetime. Come on I know there's couples that are committed to each other but not a lot that are in the limelight.
Once in a generation !!!!💯💯
Almost a million views young man.....I get a real Johnny Cash vibe from you and totally enjoying it... Keep dropping the great music....God Bless...👍👍🎵🎵♥
MAGIC MUSIC from the soul!!!! MURICA needs to get her soul back, to GOD and good values. Those men North of Richmond must step aside and retire!
It sounds like your soul is singing.
That's a goodin'... Keep sangin" Keep pickin'...
Example of Zen koan.  3 monks stand watching a flag blowing. First monk says, the flag is blowing. Second monk says, no, the wind is blowing the  flag. 3rd monk says, no, your mind is moving.   Hummmm?
I absolutely love this song. Look at you, just droppin them soulful heartfelt bangers. Keep it up! Ill be along for every single one.
You keep getting better and better! Soul brotha soul…..
I see a lot of haters in the comments pretty wild considering Oliver Anthony is one of the realest best artist that we seen in a very long time no record labels no bullshit Nashville telling him to change all authentic can’t ask for more out of a country artist keep up the great work majority of us are cheering for you !
Just gotta say,  YOU ARE KILLIN IT CHRIS!  I am a fan!
I ain't knockin it, but I gotta say there are 100+ songwriters in Nashville writing the same songs as Anthony Oliver and they don't have a million plus views. What's so special about him?
you had your 15 minutes.. you  missed your mark... you decided  to proselytize  and turn a bunch of people off.  We're all not interested in being molested by dudes in robes.. been there.
Thank you for another great song, Chris! Keep on keepin' on!
Question about one lyrics in second verse.. Does he say zebco? Like a fishing reel, or, Zen koan, like the budist thought examination of different perspective? Please tell me
yep....thats whats up
Keep doing exactly what you're doing. If the record companies start calling, please hang up on them. Your music is pure and if you let the corporations in they will water down and taint the very special talent you have.
Awesome @oliveranthonymusic  Love this song!!
Awesome
HEY CHRIS! I sure like your music. I'm also a musician,  We hear music different than the regular Joe... You have this authenticity in your voice, lyrics and playing. You can really pick that old dobro with some soul.. I love that. It's such a talent to be able to sing and play at the same time.. I can't lol. I feel like I got to know your character a little when you did the JRE episode. You seem to be a good Christian man. And you describe depression and suicidal thoughts better than anyone I've ever heard do so. It's hard to find words for that shit man. So Thanks for that. Unfortunately I'm familiar with those same thoughts. It's good to see a success story, It gives me inspiration and Hope. I noticed that you talked about your former self as Chris, almost in third person.. like that guy ain't around no more..Stay humble man.. Stay true, stay You.. The world needs more Oliver Anthonys.. Thank You!
Who will sing for me ??? 🙏🕊️ Humanity,Not insanity.... ✌️🇺🇸
this is an awesome tune!!
Man, every song you write hits home for me. I truly enjoy the spirit of your music. God bless you!
Love this one!
your musical pronunciation and sound is pure soul of country. beautiful music
I love this man's music and his message.  It's what you would wanna stumble across on the radio and immediately just sit and listen. It's like what was missing in music these days just resurrected with Oliver Anthony music .
The long country tradition of comparing women to trucks continues~
One of my favorite songs of yours.. please do "Between Me and You" next
CHEVY IS FRENCH SWISS TRASH!  NOT EVEN AMERICAN!
New Favorite! 🔥
Keep. It Real.
Would love to see him go in the voice
Bro beyond “Rich Men North of Richmond,” you deserve all the views. You write some solid chill music that can be appreciated any time of day, any time of year, any age.
I like country now. :')

What a songwriting gem!
gozei
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stay true to yourself!!
Used car prices were high enough and you probably just single handedly made these go up in value!
Another amazing song.  Keep up the great work!
Love what your doing from here in he UK. Keep honouring the one who is opening doors and opportunities for you.
❤❤❤❤❤
I mean this is crazy how much you have made me like this kind of music. Amazing man!!! Sir you really are speaking for a lot of us and please do not stop. Don't listen to the Left or Right, Keep being you! Much love sir!
Great song! You are a true artist. Love what you do! ❤
Im a bowtie guy till the day i die👍🏽.  Great sound and just to show you you don't need all the fancy bells and whistles like they do in Hollywood and all the other big major record artist.  Sometime just the basic sound way better but the great work 💪🏽

Waiting for that John Rich collab.
Should have been an 80s chevy
And this time the "lefties" are all in a twist about the image of the pistol in a holster. Hang in there, your following is greater than the little people!
One request: Sing just O N E bad song??? You're making it so hard to pick a favorite!!!
That ll be me too Oliver. 1995 chevy cheyenne manual, 4x4 2500.  Great work partner working for my family.
This guy was obviously sent from above! Words can't say how great it feels to see he is fulfilling what God put him here to do! God bless you and your family Chris
The Ole Boy did it again.
Amazing! PLZ LMK IF HE EVER WANTS A BASS PLAYER
0:51 I have a song for you maybe. Can I send it to you. No angle
Man, your voice is like butter...
I just read your post in which you say that you aren't a good musician. I'll tell you this. You aren't good. You are an artist and art isn't about being good. It's an outward expression of an inward soul. You, sir, are great at that expression. Being "good" has nothing to do with art. What makes what you do great is the connection it has with those who see your art. Keep doing what you're doing. It's good for your soul and the soul of those who find connection to it.
Love it!❤👍👍
Anthony Oliver Music,I guarantee your ancestors are proud of you young man. Onward.
I'VE OWNED ALOT OF SQUARE BODIES.
keep doing what your doing
Somebody help me out. YouTube captions are shit-worthless.  'A case of beer & a...?'
Love this song , great lyrics. Keep writing these great songs .
Wow that was a really good song.
"...it's been a hard day, it's been a long week..." That's how the past 50 years felt, lol. Thank you , Oliver! God bless you.
I think you may have a dollar
Is that a Gretsch you are playing there…. LOL! 😂
This was great, I preferred the tempo of the original version tho, keep killing it brother
As a man with a 92 gmc and a wonderful wife I can confirm hahaha
I like how Oliver Anthony is an internet sensation who came from seemingly out-of-nowhere.  Many people can relate to what he sings about.
❤love that u are just down to earth still proud of u ❤
Hell of a voice
Love your music bro. Keep it independent. You will not regret it.
Love your music and your unique voice❤
Anointed
You give me Waylon vibes!
❤ creek life. Growing up appalachia poor, nature was our vacations. We had no money to travel the world, or even leave the state. We camped, fished on the creeks, swam in the creeks, went caving, hiked the land. Now its all private property bought by rich men who put up fences, no tresspass signs, charging folk for river access. Getting to be the poor cant even take the kids to the creeks anymore, cant camp unless you pay $35 bucks to set up a tent in a over crowded camp ground.
Carter and cash was a bad analogy.. the ish was f up.. he was a cheating talented  junkie.. hurt was his repent for his life of wrongs..  😢 how not to live. But the devil is only getting stronger these days.. find the key ❤.  Truth and honesty and kindness 👑. Not lies deception and hatred.. it's winning..in 2023.
I heard about you and music on news coming up. And then next day I heard this song on truck video and I was like who sings this I like this and it was you haha. Keep it up your music
My 94 Chevy is retiring tomorrow 😢.
💯🤍 SUPERSTAR🧑🏻‍🦰✨🔥❤️👌🏻💪🏻👍🏻👏🏻🤩😍
🎉
❤
1:19 just to let us know hes got the carry
💪
Wow, more whining from the guy who loses his southern accent when being interviewed on corporate media. Gee, thanks! Love the alcoholism glorification btw, real winner there.
93 Silverado blazer ❤️
I think this is your best tune so far.
thank God and thank you
My dad had and old 82 chevy growing up I know it’s not 90 Something but man it just reminded a you of simpler times and very relatable and I’m glad you said case of beer instead of 6 pack like most of that pop country. Keep doing it man your music is real.
Idrive1
Keep speaking for us brother !
Damn it boy this is good music!!
LADIES ladies, he's married, find your own😂
Real music for real people! I'm blown away. I've been enthralled ever since I clicked on the first one (RMNR).
This man could be a millionaire by now but refuses to give into the music industry cabal. Good for you sir.
I am in awe of how good your music and messages are and I want you to know how much I appreciate you and the music you create, I'm from Wales UK 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 and alot of the same shit is happening here but I have to apologize for that idiot billy Bragg who is just extremely jealous of the fact that you can write better protest songs than he ever could. You have made me a happy man Oliver and I'm extremely thankful for that.
That voice gives me chills!
Thank you so much for creating this song
You are bringing back what society is missing.
A different generation, I had a 65 Chevy rusted through. When it snowed outside, it snowed inside too!
nothing more genuine than a man singin about his girl and his truck. If that's not love I don't know what is.
Got my '90 4x4 Silverado out in the driveway
💙 from Seventh Day Adventist Stockholm🇸🇪
I go back to 1980 chevy memories. So dead on with the lyrics except i never got into the drinking. 1980 Z28 still have it.  If that thing could talk 😮
This definitely is no fluke.  Oliver isnt a one hit wonder his talent is legit.
Breath of fresh air,  keeping it real...........
Just got my 15th job rejection today. At 42 I’ve worked hard to get to where I am and the job market is hard. I felt this song so deep in my soul.
OMG you have a wonderful voice! Best regards from Germany friend 👋
It's nice watching somebody where I don't feel like I'm just watching performing seals and trained bears do their stuff on stage all of their scripted moves and scripted Behavior
💯✊
Where u been Son!! Watch ur self , don't let "them" commercialize u or ur music!! Stay true!!!ty
Nick Fuentes is right about this guy.
Great song even for a Ford fan keep up speaking for the common man
You have a really great contrast of newer country style meshed with a classic country singer voice.
I’m a Ford guy but this songs dope even though I’m not country either. Keep up the good tunes man.  Just let yourself be used by God.  Fill up that Cup then poor it on the People.  Let the Spirit flow in you and through you.
Putting country back in country music.
Nice video that’s a pretty sweet tent you got there. You ought compile a whole album of the most popular releases with  Some new stuff. I cannot remember that last time I’ve been excited about new music.
I like to think of my girl as an 80’s Honda no thrills dependable, reliable, if you treat her right she keeps going.
Your honestly best song writer out right now man keep the fucking great work up brother haven’t heard a song that I haven’t liked you sing ❤
Love your music! 💚
Fire, fuck Ford. Chevy is ultimate truck
This fella has his own unique style. Gonna go far.
Comment from the Sunny Bradenton Florida Construction site 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍
Single handly bringing back genuine country music. Not that there aren't a few good artists still out there but so many are all over the place .
Bahahaha , I have to laugh . As the song was ending I was thinking . Now everyone will want an old Chevy . Today they just doubled in value . :)
Great song
A case of beer and a zebco, that hits home. Keep em comin ol' son!

My new favorite love song
This is going to be the first dance with my lady in our wedding. Thank you for this
Well, mine was an S10, but all it was missing was a couple cylinders!  Awesome song, awesome sound!
My Mom isn't an Internet person... I played her some of your music yesterday and she loved it!  She's old school country, Tennessee-raised from way back.  I'd take it as high praise.  👍  Thanks for another good song!!
Amazing, your podcast with Joe was great as well. Keep up the amazing genuine authentic work you do!
This is so much better than the crap on the country stations. Thanks oliver for being you.

Case of beer and a zebco… great line, man. Zebco is what’s up. Great tune, btw.
Brother that was beautiful
Another awesome song, Chris. I'm so glad you're getting the chance to live your dream. It couldn't have happened to a better man.
Damn that truck needs an alignment. Lol😂
I fuckin love this shit. Bring back the beer drinkin rough neck mfs who love their women and children. Bring back America. God bless you Chris
He is also very humble. I'm glad he's finally taking off and he deserves all the success he's had.
Reminds me of my youngest brother's 95 Chevy LB.  David, may you be at peace brother. I love and miss you. Amen.
Love your music man. Down to earth, authentic, with old school Bluegrass roots.
When you always chase more, you end up with Less.  Another great song!
I have this one in my amazon playlist and its by far one of my favorites
💥💥💥💯💯💯💯
Beautiful brother! Just beautiful!
Star is born
YouTube is not counting the thumbs up! Keep up the music what make us happy drives the corporate company's crazy. ❤
That's awesome, thanks for sharing
Keep the faith brother

Get this to #2 on trending
Mans got 3 songs in trending music at the same time. Imagine the whirlwind hes going through.
What a good song. I'm primarily a metal head but you tunes opened me up to a whole new world of music
Somewhere Nick Fuentes is seething this poor ginger who ain't gotta dollar is making more off one song than Nick has made his entire career.   Absolutely groyped.
Damn brother your voice is something fierce! Thanks for the tunes.❤
Great song, Oliver!!
Definitely one that'll be on repeat ❤❤❤ this song is so damn sexy 🤩🤩🤩
This one might be my favorite.
Man this song reminds me of my childhood in my hometown. Thank you brother for writing and singing great songs. Man you are truly an artist. We need more of this these days.
Loving the pistol 💪🇺🇸😎
Nice and smooth bro. Keep your head up - you're doing great.
Either im getting old or talent is getting younger but never thought the hands of time would be singing about...a 90 some Chevy
Instant classic!
this bread tastes good for the circus im observing
Real country is making a comeback.
I like this kind of country music
My dad gave me a 96 Chevy when I graduated Highshool 13 years ago. Its in the shop now getting road worthy agan and I absolutely can't wait to roll the windows down and scream this song through the speakers!
A case of beer and a Zebco.... Brilliant!!!
I love this song...and I'm a Ford guy!
Nice tent lol Stuck in Cali.. missing the wilderness.  Thanks for the music and the nature  Jesus Christ is coming 🙏  Love you and everyone 😇💙
✌️🤠👏👏1977 K-5   2WD  ❤️🤍💙 Dirt Roads ,Tail gates  and hound 🐶🐕 God Bless Texas....... Well done Sir 👍
👍
nice song!
It's official, we're approaching "the hard times", as the music becomes good again.
That Gretsch sounds nice!
Badass tune brother!!!
The fact that thing isn’t rusted clear through is a miracle
The whine in your voice gives me goosebumps, I LOVE YOUR MUSIC SO MUCH!
These songs really relate to the average American. Average meaning an iq of 97 and bound to be subservient to people of greater genetic worth.
Can you write any bad music? 😂
Watching you on Rogan and catching up with your music Oliver.  You're an amazing singer, artist and, from what I can see, young man.  Congratulations and be sure to keep God close and always first in your life.  May the Lord continue to guide and protect you and your loved ones!
Красиво ❤ wandeful
Thank God for all this freedom!!!!!
I love this man he has a good heart
I really enjoyed that
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Take all the money you can from them...........BUT don't sell your soul to those PsOS!!!!
that is a good fuckin song.
Great song Chris!!! Go Oliver Anthony Music!!!!!
This is such a good fucking song
Great song.
Man that takes me back to my '94 and teenage weekends! Keep on killin it
Was interesting hearing your talk with Joe  I get your anxiety. I am a painter and I'm almost 34. There's a lot of sacrifice to make something So pure work in our world. It is unusual what we do... It's not "needed"  We depend on others income to survive... So God bless those people who likes what we do... :)
Shitt you are amazing 🤜🤛🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Beautiful song !!
Can you come sing at our fried pie festival? All the pies you can eat. My treat.
This is great, but the emotion is stronger on the spotify version! I like the roughness and some of the background noise. I just replaced intake gaskets, coils, plugs, and several other agin items on a 3.0v6, listening to Oliver Anthony Music while working in the shop goes together better that peanut butter and cocaine!
Yukon Cornelius?! Is that you?
She's got rust in the - usual spots, don't mean I gotta - seller off. She shines right  - up, When I wash - er' up. Got no plastic - panels, Cus she all o - riginal!
Well shit...that makes a FORD man think twice....😂😂...#HollerwhenurinSC

You Sir is what Country Music was before corporations got a hold of it. You tell a story with each song and all of its very relatable to all of us. Please don’t sell out ever! My only suggestion is get a hold of the artist JAX that sang Victoria’s Secret challenging the brand. To my knowledge she hasn’t sold out to a label and has refused to take her song down in spite of the brand threatening epic lawsuits. America is with you not the greedy corporations bro!! Just be yourself and ignore the rest. Everyone wants to make money off the next thing. You are upsetting todays country scene for all the right reasons!!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
Chris Stapleton should do a full album with you!
Love the song
Making me like country music Ollie.
I had a 91 standard 3 speed with a granny gear. Dang I miss that ol truck. She sure was a gooder.
Sweet. My Dad bought a 94 new. I still have it with the transmission out. It’s a great one and ran for 300k. I need it again for mulch.
A million views in 24 hours , not too shabby
Stay you...
Yup
I been humming this all day. A favourite
Wish i could share a picture of my truck. 98 long bed W/T. Basic as it gets.
I love this one too!
Keep it up man! I'm glad to see your success after all these hard times. I definitely feel your hard times songs after barely being able to get by. I just finished a masters degree but I've learned quick that doesn't equate to making it easier to find a job. From Western NC
Love you sir!! May God direct your path and be with you always. We need you!
Ahhhhh another stunningly beautiful song flowing out of you. Your my favorite artist.
Dear Oliver. Just be yourself. It makes the world a better place. Thanks and God Bless. Amen.
@Oliver Anthony - The people have your back, keep sticking it to the man, Brother. Let all those tyrants know how the people actually feel about them.
@oliveranthonymusic  I wrote a song about the state of the country today. Let me know what you think?  https://youtu.be/BpQ4Mn9gIOk?si=gzGhnt2h7iwWMSiY
Turn down 7 mill and stay independent.  You'll get 70 mill at least sir. Shout of from nc
This is what our country needs now yes please!
Sorry I've got a '60 Chevy 1 ton with a log cabin on the back. Never had anything that new. I'm old, older than my truck, with a straight six. Glad to see you. Been waiting a while for what is happening now. Bless you brother in Christ.
Wow don’t even need backup what a voice awesome!
🔥👊🔥⚙️🔨🏍🚜🌲
Keep singing because you are the real sound of American people.
I am an Indonesian staying halfway around the world, never owned a chevy or leave in a countryside, but still your song speak to me deeply. Please continue doing what you're doing. Your audience is global.
Halfway through listening to this I realised I was swaying! Beautiful 👌
Respect for your handmade songs and greets from Germany.👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻 (Called "Germoney"...) We understand you and many people agree with your messages. 💯
❤
Love your music brother and the raw voice you have
I have that same guitar in rust red but I can't play it like this! ❤Damn 😃
This is a song about Christ and His bride!
Yo this guy Oliver cant put out bad music!!  Epic much love from your irish brother from Galway! never back down!
Love the gun. A new fan. He gets it.
Chris out here preaching ❤
Damn good music Oliver Keep it up man
Thankfull for my 93chevy gets me to work everyday ...
This guy needs a place in office if we ever get out the other side of all this woke bullshit. He speaks more truth in his songs then we have herd in years.
Resurrecting the spirit of country.  Proud of you, your courage, and talent.  While most lament, you present.
This is amazing
Nice song, relaxing.
He has a very unique voice. I think he should find a song writer and make some pick me music.
Pure honest real music. Thank you so much!  Your music is good for the soul!
Love it brother
Yup, this is what we need.❤
LIKE A ROCK!!!
Brother I can hit replay all day with the music your belting out!
An alcoholic singing about drinking a case of beer.  That aside,  song is a lame duck.
💪
Stay independent Anthony! Come to Alabama look me up let’s pick!!
This is AWESOME!! Thanks for the real country music!! 💯💪
You're a breath of fresh air and I'm so glad you're getting the recognition you deserve. Your songs are healing on so many levels. Keep doing it for us who find comfort in the heart inspire lyrics. Sending love from Kenya 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
labor day weekend. this song reminds me of my younger years when “ love you till labor day”  was the motto of summer romances before heading back to school. now i’m sitting on the porch of my log home in the country, getting ready to go to church. it’s a good life. i have been successful. ( as i determine success, and on my terms). I admire your successes, and your talent, pray for your journey and thankful for you message and music.
I know it’s a terrible idea and no one would want to transfer into that world but I would absolutely vote for you if you were to run for president.
Excellent……. I drive a ‘90 some Chevy… A ‘97 Silverado in great shape? Need her for a video? 😎👊
Chris,  Thanks for being a genuine human being and carrying the message of hope. Don’t forget where you came from. Stay humble my friend. Holler if you need anything. We need each other.
If you've seen new truck prices these days it'll make a grown man cry.
Such a hood song.
Enjoy life, don’t work to hard lad
Great song  Keep on killing it.
Love this one, brother.
Awesome!
Man, I loved your first 2 songs but your sudden turn to this “neutral”, centrist bs just rubbed me the wrong way and can’t listen to any new songs anymore. You spoke against those that gave you millions of views and praised you and you acted as if you don’t have the same political beliefs as we do. Seriously? Who do you think supported your first song? Centrists and leftists? Give me a break. The demoncraps are actively burning this nation to the ground in numerous ways and you choose to take a neutral position? That’s cowardice and betrayal dude.
Something very sweet about his songs.
Beautiful song. Love how you never look at the camera:)
Man I hope you can really stay true to you and what you do!! There ain’t no one in your league right now
You have a wonderful voice. Thank you for sharing it with us❤
How many people in here had a 90 something Chevy truck you wish you had back???????
Hi on my channel, I'm restoring cars after an accident. Come see how a whole car turns out from a pile of scrap metal :)
Top of the morning Chris "Oliver" I truly hope this comment finds you and finds you well. I felt like sharing some inspiration you've gained me recently. I first heard of you and your music starting with the song RMNOR. Instantly hooked. Being a man of great values, a proud man, a proud husband, father, American, and someone who faced the same struggles with substances, hearing your words and seeing the faith you share show me a man of great value right here.   The inspiration you gained me recently is wanting to get back into music. I play drums mostly but a few other instruments as well. I started back when I was 13yrs old. My mom and grandpa have had their band since I was young and they still play almost every weekend to this day. Over the years with life taking over and losing interest in things. Once you've put them down, it's hard telling if they'll pick up again before your time is over. Just before I stopped playing music I was in a country band. But the funny thing is, I kept saying we need someone who plays a Dobro. Never found anyone who did lol But the sound of a Dobro is just something I needed it in my life. Something about that twang of a Dobro is mesmerizing. But long story short. After I left the band, I sold my DW kit which was the most beautiful kit I'd seen or had. Since then, I haven't touched the drums or the desire to. But then here comes Oliver Anthony, the music peaking my interests. I started getting this itch for music I've not felt in several years and oddly enough...... A damn Dobro lol   I hope to one day meet you and shake your hand, sit-down and just have a conversation on life. Though if that opportunity never happens, at least know you've Motivated me and that speaks volumes. Just know I can't thank you enough. I wish you all the best. Derek.
Oh, so everything you do is awesome? Oh , ok.  Gotcha
Another great down-home song!
Duuuuuuuudee…….  Another banger for real
Love it man, but it sounded better in the shed.
Had to trade in my 90 something Chevy after a massive heart attack almost 3 years ago. I miss that old truck.
They said Some one hit wonder?  This Oliver Anthony guy it seems every song gets better good Ole country boy he is
Thanks dude, just thanks. Thanks for single-handedly breathing new life into country music, and this country. If ya don't think one person can make a positive difference in this world then your eyes are closed. This song is every bit as good as Rich Men, thanks for sharing this with us. Fame can be a killer but I think you've got the right head and heart for it man. Look forward to hearing more from you.
Beautiful! Love your authenticity ♥️
Amazing 💥
Sitting here on my front lawn, listening to this song. Looking at my 97 Chevy.
Hey Oliver Anthony you said a case of beer and some ??? What is that?
Good tune my huy
Stay true to yourself. This should show everybody to stop selling out
Killing it brother
Oh dang Chris done set him up a fort hope his ol lady didn't send him to the doghouse😁
when Blueridge said you where going to be there I got so excited, man you will draw a huge crowed and I cant wait keep it up man.
you are the best man love your music good evening from greece
That voice is Golden heaven sent. ❤ Thank you
another stellar
Very good
Wanted to share a point of view with you. I have watched dozens of "reactions" to your music and often hear folks talk about how much things have changed.  Thing is, many of these folks saying that are not yet 30.  I'm 78 years old. Does the younger generation have any idea what us old folks are going through with this 'new world." It's mind boggling to us to see how much folks have veered away from the Bible, the family, and fundamental moral principles and behavior. I think your messaging is helping. Great work...keep it up.
Wow  sing it Buddy.   Talent!!!!!
That’s awesome keep being yourself amen.
this is my guy.. he's a man.
Currently sitting at 3 for 3.  You make good music, brother.
Was driving home yesterday, stopped at a light, and the truck that pulled up beside me was playing Rich Men North of Richmond.  We exchanged a nod and drove off.
Please don't ever please sign with anyone! Keep that independence !!!! They just want to control what you say! They know what impact music makes ❤
Damn brother. That’s a song
proper music all authentic just a man with a guitar
Straight from the soul.  I had a 66 Chevy in high school in the early 90s.  Does that count?
You gotta get you some money while it’s here. Do some good with it.  Thanks for the music.
hi Oliver, i loved your personality on Joe Rogan a lot. i want you to know you are not only hitting people in America. this kind of talent, it’s worldwide.
Me and my wifes first car was a 98 lumina. V6, smooth, goes like a tank in the snow, ac didnt work... Comfy backseat heh
90s Chevy's were the worst cars on the planet...jackass
Outstanding. Simply outstanding.
Holy hell, this is country. Forgive me if i don't get the exact term. Reminds me of the 90's country with a little Johnny Cash thrown in. Beautiful. Just a thought; although, hard, do music, fk everything else.  Don't read the 50k comments.... or do but realize the positives. ..... jesus im a stoner, sounds cheese AF but yea. ML
Could you imagine sitting on a river bank catfishing sitting around a campfire and Oliver pulling out this guitar
Damn - think I like it better than rich men north of Richmond!! You say you aren’t a musician - but we alll feel it! That voice 🙏🏼
Sir, I could listen to your beautiful voice nonstop forever and be perfectly happy.  *Wow*
🙌🏻
thats an absolute hit..
The price of 90's Chevy's just went up! Beautiful toon Chris!
America really need you
I’m sure I’m gonna be a fan of this guy forever, I’m from the UK but he speaks such universal truths
That was good.
True pure American country music 🇺🇸 👍
Chris, In some ways you are probably the wealthiest man on the planet at the moment ..... please keep your spirits up and remember your are not alone
I heard this song on your live stream. All the way from Australia mate. Absolutely amazing 🎉
Heavens light shines down on you Christopher. ❤ Thank you for sharing that Light.
🗑️
What an amazing song man the lord gave you talent to tell stories and keep the hope of us living into days world.
This song made me feel the appreciation for my good wife, her appreciation after i work 12 hours in the hot australian desert......my goodness i love my wife 😊   And i love how this song brings appreciation to the simple things, and i love it
Great song man! Don't stop! 👏 🙏
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Remember a week ago or so when Oliver had a couple of thousand subs?! Heading to a million good job everyone for supporting Oliver!!
I LOVE YOUR MUSIC❤  ÌT SOUNDS LIKE OLE SCHOOL!! SOULFUL COUNTRY MUSIC❤  THANK YOU.
Oliver, you are absolutely amazing. Your voice is one of a kind. When I hear your music it makes me think of my father. Unfortunately he passed away 😢😢. But hearing you makes my heart feel good. Thank you Oliver. PLEASE STAY TRUE.
He might be a racist I own a ford
I'm a Black 45 year old Hip Hop Head. I liked Rich Men, Get Sober and I like this. I live in the Midwest. I'm a blue collar worker who works 50-60 hrs a week to survive. Somehow his music resonates with me. I can't explain it.. almost like, "He's one of us and I can tell" pours through his music. The struggle sounds real and not just like some written lyrics. I like this guy. A lot.
I like that song brother. You speak my language (Harlan county USA).
🔥🔥🔥
A love song meets a used car Ad Still selling that Chevy ?
Real just Real
Continue to speak for the common people. God bless!❤
Dude, you're killing it!
⚡⚡⚡
Wonderful!
Goodness and truth  bring love  intro  the world  💗we are out camping walking  in the woods  with you💖

I never thought I'd be into country music.
RESPECT❤🇨🇦👍
Thankyou love listening to your music 🎶 rock on ❤
The Farmville Performance of this song was straight 🔥🔥🔥 !!!!
It's a dammmnnnnnn shame,  I love this O. A!!!
Que Dieu vous garde Oliver , vous êtes une bonne personne avec une belle âme .
Modern classic. History will put you  alongside the greats. We will he hearing  cover bands do you justice here in the streets  of Southeast Asia where good music can also be heard. Be happy out there Ollie
The art of life is having the courage to be yourself. The greatest joy of life is to love and be loved. You, dear lad,  shine on both counts. Your music is simply outstanding. I wish you n' the Mrs. every joy the world has to offer. Praise Jesus.  P.S. This here song is my daily go-2 song, a month on... puts the smile to my face. When them Rich Men North of Richmond are jarring my head n heart, when I Wanna Go Home, Doggonit, it gives me such great peace of mind and a true sense of freedom... witnessing old-school love lives on and who knows where it can take us all?

True talent
Thanks for the small intro into your world. I appreciate it  means more than you know.
Love this one here. Reminds me when I heard Run by George Strait about driving a Chevy...much love from SE Texas
Keep on pumping em out 💯
No half naked women twerking, no gold teeth, no gigantic gold necklaces, no Rolex, no RR, no cash flashing....Meaning you don't need all that to BLOW 😂👌
Awesomeness! Loved it..
Nailed It Piedmont. Got a Ford F-100 1981... Bought her new... 300...Straight 6... 3 in the floor with OD...
Ahhh back to when country music was country
I love the backrounds on these videos, so peaceful, a tent out in the wilderness.
As an owner of a 90 some Chevy, I approve of this message! 👍👍
Just please keep bring us your music, it hits the soul 🙏
Great song
Thank you @OliverAnthony 🙏💗🙏 #Cheby 😘
💜💜💜🙃🙃🙃💜💜💜
You ar the best singer and song writer of my Life.  I wish you the best from Italy Southtyrol
Keep em coming 👍
90s Chevys built like a rock
Just heard you on Joe Rogan... great interview man.
Thank You
I've got to say, the soul you put into your music is definitely felt. Listening to your songs reminds me of hearing Chris Knight or Bob Seger for the first time. Just a man and his guitar pouring his heart out for the world to see. We see you Oliver. You will never be forgotten, and rightfully so.
Keep it raw and real, brother. God has a purpose for you.
https://youtu.be/7AXrGO0ElyU?si=mgxzgJPeZmYCk258 this is what you really wish you could sing about
You are one of the most raw talent I have listen and honest arist .  Keep on going. Love your voice
Commented before about being from the UK and not really being a fan of Country apart from some Johhny Cash but damn Chris your songs just hit for me, raw, real, honest and from the soul :)
@oliveranthonymusic another awesome song the working man can relate too. Mines like a 90 some Chevy as well she rides just right when you turn her on. Nothing sounds better than an old 350 like when she’s running up to kiss me when I’m still soaked from the heat and she soaked just thinking bout me getting home. Love your music bro. It’s a movement called working for a living.
Absolutely brilliant. Im so hlad ive stumbled on you
The next Jamie Johnson
Hit after hit! Keep’em coming brother! Please stay away from mainstream and the NARRATIVE! America will embrace you for it!
Hi dear Oliver !   You are a great artist, but above all, you are a great man in the woods...   I send you all my love from France.   thank you  💙🤍❤
Young'n. For me it was an 80 some Dodge with my wife now of 20 some odd years.
Ever think of vinyl… a record would be awesome… thank you for the work you do…
God bless you brother ✝️❤
Freakin' LOVE THIS ONE, MAN!!!! Rock on, bubba!!!! Much support from MidTenn, fo sho! 👌
There’s nothing better than a night on the lake in Wisconsin woods holding your baby. 🔥 song Anthony Oliver.
I always talk shit about how the Internet took away, days of cruisin in a 90 some Chevy (or my equivalent 91 Ford Ranger). The times when technology didn't rule everything. The contrary to that is, if not for the Internet, I would have never had the pleasure of listening to your songs. You are capable of reaching people on a level that hits everyone. That's truly amazing 🤘🏻. I'm a metal guy, and tbh you're lyrics and string pickin is so in tune. You can change the world Sir.....I realize you aren't seeking fame or money....isn't weird how it worked out for you though? I could never imagine how that feels. I don't know that I would want it either.
East Texas approved!
Omg! This song is amazing! True country. Keep up these great hits Oliver. You are AWESOME!😊
The voice and cenery, combined with well-used words, are worth more than golden apples. 💛 ❤
Based yurt
From an "old guy", Oliver, grab the cash while it's there and do some good with it! Ya have the kinda talent that people WANT to pay for and Lord knows ya wont "biden" or hollywood the money, but do some good with it! That's the "thing" with people that get rich and then own 5 tour buses, a mansion, a private jet and a fleet of SUV's and luxury cars, then tell others how to live. I really don't see ya doing that stuff.
Hope this man sings worship music with that voice he has
Bringing All of Us Together, One Song at a Time!
I love it!!!! Imma Chevy girl too!
I make music and it is very complicating 2 many people !! I admire anyone who can express themselves and make it so big with just 2 instruments !! Just raw and from the heart !! Not generally the kind of music I listen 2 but I feel it !! Very grounding !! Thank you brother for sharing this!!
This is sweet. I love the powerful stuff, but I also love me a good romantic song. ❤
I look forward to buying a cd of all these songs. don't let anyone over produce this stuff its perfect as is. best new music i've heard in decades. who god bless no man curse.
Great music. Grüße aus Deutschland. Diese musik ist balsam für die Seele . Wir in Deutschland kämpfen auch um ein selbstbestimmtes Leben hier. Danke Oliver A. Du bist eine Inspiration.
Totally Racist lol
Oliver Anthony, your first month in the worldwide music spotlight has been incredible. As a retired professional music critic (45 years experience), you are almost a unique talent and incredibly authentic. Never lose these qualities. A suggestion - not every record label necessarily exploitive. An excellent agent can dictate stringent terms in a music contract, so that you can keep totally control of your music. A major record label would be crazy to try to change anything about your approach to music.
It Father’s Day in Australia 🇦🇺 listening to this song, having a beer on Sunday afternoon.
Love your style and your voice. I wish you all the best!
ItzaHIt
Im from philly and grew up on Wutang and Pantera, Mobb Deep and Tool, Nas and Slipknot, Biggie and Hatebreed and i cant stand country music! I absolutely love all the songs i heard so far by you! Im ready for some beers and fireball blasting this greatness
Keep on trucking brother 💪
The fact that people are trying to turn your music political is upsetting. I just like your music!!
This is just good old classic country gold!
OUTSTANDING !!
🤠
Thank you again Oliver Anthony
how the hell is one good ole boy form the Carolinas all by his own self redefining what country is, i guess this has to happen every once in a while, just to let the industry understand just how far they have fallen off the tailgate. more of this  please
This song is incredible. This is a lifetime jam from here on out.   Turn it up
I farted on my couch and spilled my beer....yeah yeah hillybilly BS we are all doomed.....
My first car was a 97 f-150 when i was 16.....man did we tear it up.
I don’t know how or why I’m asking here, but I am. Eric West of the HawaiiRealEstate channel has just been fired from his job. He’s getting the blowback from asking the questions we all want to know. He’s tired and ready to give up on staying in the fight. We’ve all been there at some point in our life. Freedom fighters, truthers and lovers of God. Pray for him, reach out and let’s surround our brother in our support for the amazing work he has done. Please help.
Sir, respectfully, that's a GMC.
That’s Ultra Mega MAGA BIGLYYYYYYYYYYY   🇦🇺👍🏻🇺🇸
@oliveranthonymusic another hit buddy! Please don’t let some woke record company ever get their hands on you. Stay yourself and keep putting out great music…truthful music that hit everyone’s soul. You sir are a national treasure. Thank you for being you. Much respect brother. Life will get better after January 20, 2025 at 12:00noon. That’s 90% of our Counties prayer. I hear you’re not into politics much (don’t know if that’s true or rumor), but we need President Trump back NOW to right the ship. And right the ship he will do. Keep your head up and please keep putting out your great music! 🇺🇸
I am higher than gas…Perfect line
singin about a 90 chevy and he dont drive one...
My playback speed was up 2X, and this actually slaps when you speed up, too!
few things bring such cheer as the baritone of a big bullfog like the growly purring of a stateside V8....
The audio quality is too good to be recorded in that forest.  Where was the recording done? 😮
killing it brother keep being you
Love it
Hey Chris, even Pres Trump has you covered 😄 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu6kfj188jo
Again, beautiful. Thankyou.
Anthony, you don't have to thank us, we have to thank you! Thank you for your words of truth. You gave us blue collar, hard workin men and women a anthem!
Love it man Stay the course!!
Love it brother!
Great song, Oliver.
This is your best song so far.
Bought my first truck a 1993 Chevy Cheyenne when I was 19. Met my wife in it and she rode next to me on the bench seat every time. Still my favorite truck ever! Thanks for the song!
Buddy Brown Oliver Anthony collaboration. Blow the internet up and lite the spark🤠
You can see in his eyes at the end saying... "why's everyone looking at me?" Pray for this man.
My Chevy made it to 260K miles.  If I took better care of her, she would've made it a lot longer.
It's just soooo easy listening ❤
"A case of beer and a zebco"  Make that a Tshirt my friend.

I had a 98' Chevy S-10!
let me guess, you want to share some political views
Beautiful brother! Saddle up cowboy, your now the voice for “us” … America needs ya now more than ever! Thank you sir.
Thanks for the music 🎶
It should not be true that freedom to bear arms, travel, and speak the truth, is fought for by only conservatives and the precious few politicians who will fight for them. But it is. The foundations of America are somehow right-wing these days. We can cry about the Monoparty, but what do we do? Convince the democrats to abandon their attack? Convince the establishment republicans that their time is long up? Do a peaceful revolution, just march up to DC and enforce radical transparency, maybe Nuremberg 2.0 while we're at it?
WTF, @1.20??? What place has a shot of gun in this beautiful music video?? Subtle insertions of this nature are kind of sinister Quoting scripture while toting guns doesn’t add up? What would Jesus do? 🫵
ya but why try and fake the illusion it's live?
if only every wom n w s s good s  90  some chevy   (sorry, my ehhhhy button stopped working)  guess i gott  spend some more h rd e rned c sh on more junk
I don’t know politics
You are touching the people of this country!  Funny your song was played at the republican w/e lol  They had to listen to the song you wrote about them.  With my family being from VA and you a ginger, we are probably related  Rotflmfao  Get it? Same state and Ginger’s lol. Hahahaha   Don’t worry I’m not after your $, I’m doing alright.  Just, the Rock and Oprah are so fake!  Be careful.   Like they did a commercial for Hawaii, to raise $ for the victims. Seems like a caring gesture but upon watching this, I noticed they were not donating their $ lol  I’ve seen a lot about her being one of the people who prey on children. She did say on her show, you touch a child like that and it feels good to the child.  Who says that on tv?  Disgusting 🤮 and sick 🤢   Personal opinion!  You’re going to be famous, unless you go off grid!  Look 👀 at how many people you have touched (figuratively) in just a couple of weeks.  I’m with you bro, a little patch of land and enough to get by on, that’s all we need. It’s really all anyone really needs but so many want so much more.  It will come with its headaches and troubles.  Like who can you trust?  Just keep being you and you will do well!  A 56 year old huge fan!
The ad after this song was for an all electric Nissan.
You are a disgusting grifter and we all know it. "Diversity is our strength" parroting leftist bullshit
Get a high fade or wear a hat
Well deserved
Please don’t take any record deals… you make great music and you don’t need no record label telling you different
Butter!
This is Flat Awesome!  A Good country Love Song! Stay Strong Brother!!
28 now. Miss my first 96 Chevy truck. Had so many memories in that ol truck. Takes me right back.
Nope! This guy ranted that he can’t stand ppl for liking his music! He thinks ppl are being too political and fake. Just another ungrateful turd! You wrote a politically charged song then dis those who made you!
Dude, what a great song. Blended Love, Women, and Chevy's perfectly!
I Love your music ❤
Reminds me of bocephus
Every word word just feels like home.
I love the Carter Cash Reference.. oh how I Miss Johnny & June..  my all time Favorites
Stay with the solo acoustic sound, no backup or auto tune. We the People love the vibe!
Good for you Olivor Anthony!!! Keep going. I will too.
Keep churning them out!!!
Dam another amazing hit so talented
God is good !
Oliver looks like my BF... Or does my BF does look like him? 😅... ❤
You hit the nail on the head about how great it is your lady greets you after a long day at work. That bar alone, I hope it makes relationships work again.
Ready for a concert ,💯🔥✌🏼
Much love. Stay true to yourself
Love it. God Bless.
Your music speaks to a lot of Americans who are struggling to get by, struggling to understand what went wrong in the world, and struggling with the reality being forced upon us by people who feel superior because of who they know or who they're related to. When all they want is to be left alone and live their life and love their family. Thanks for being seemingly the one genuine dude left in music today. Can't wait to see what else you release, I've been listening to all your stuff basically non-stop since I heard Rich Men the day it blew up
Not to nitpick, but that was a GMC Sierra. 😅
Loving your music and so happy for your success! Keep 'em coming.
Thanks for the great music and even more so for your testimony!
You are the realest thing in country in years great to see the good ol boys from the sticks ain't all gone!
Just lost my black German Shepherd to a copper head bite.  I see you with your dogs and I   think of her.
Waiting on a album!! I listen to you every day
Good job from France 🇫🇷
Love the song Chris. Beautiful lyrics. Your lady is a special woman.  May you both be blessed with amazing stories for years to come.
Ours is a 1998 Single Cab Long Box with 190000 Miles On Her But She Sure Purrs Hott!
Thank you Chris... finally some real music.  Something that makes your soul feel like it's been hit by a Freightliner . I really miss real music....
Another “knock it out of the park “ song, awesome 👍👍👍👍
I hope y thumbs up turns it to 78k
My god son this hit me
Yours is gold mine is green the best trucks your manual
I haven’t found a song that didn’t hit for me. But this one is probably a favorite for me. When I first heard it, it sounded like something me and my buddies would of said sitting around a bonfire a 12pack in picking our guitars and burning marbles.   That’s why your music has resonated with so many people, it’s authentic. It isn’t over done, it isn’t designed to be a radio hit.   Love your music man, now I just have to plan my road trip to the farmers market to hear it live.
Great job kiddo.  God bless 🙏
Happy to be a fan!
Hey, you are really good ❤
This is so good. Reminds me of a The Band and Black Crows song structure. Fantastic
So much better than what country has been the past like 10 years. Raw talent.
We thank you for sharing your talent. 🇺🇸💪
Love this song! My husband bought  me a 98 Chevy with a 454... 5 speed! Your songs are great....we spend a lot of time in my 90 some Chevy on our 85 acres of woods and creek
You’re a pansy
Keep it up brother
I listened to the Joe podcast at work. I was driving down the isles with tears in my eyes because it sounded like I was there. I'm glad you made it out of that deep hole. I'm right behind you. Nothing but love.
Damn good song!
You’re our voice brother, we’re all feeling it . May the Good Lord send you all the reward you need 🇦🇺
There hasn't been an individual, in this particular genre of music , as honest as this man since Hank Sr died. The opry trashed his name and music row disowned him after he made them all rich. Words like hillbilly and trash were thrown his way because he refused to be fake. Real folks know their own kind when we see it. There is nothing trashy or hillbilly about this young man. And, just like in Hank's case, I highly doubt any name-calling is ever going to deter this young man from playing his music. Whether it's for the woods and his dogs, or it's for 2,000 screaming fans. It makes no difference. Just know, brother, you have made so many people fall in love with you. Stay humble, and stay you.
Good song! I like this, it reminds me of my teen years. Your music is so relatable and you have a pretty good voice.
i hope we get more music like this ❤ songs that have meaning ❤
Buddy dont miss 💯🤘
R E A L   M U S I C !
hea telling everyoe on the right to stop playing his music which means hes controlled ops-  Hes got the voice- but hes on te wrong side and telling everyone to stand down playing his music.  no respect for anyone that doesnt stand up to the biden bullchit
Darling were are you im looking for you sign. Sleepless in. Sevierville. Tn
Here in N. Calif. I can get three country radio stations, and not one of them is playing this guy.  What the hell?  O, that's right, country radio doesnt play country music anymore.
I am so thankful that God decided and knew it was time for your big debut.  For we all have been blessed to be able to hear your story and your music!  They are both beautiful and inspiring.  Way to be a soldier of God and witness for him.  Thank you for sharing your gift with us all.  Stay the course my friend.  I couldn’t be happier for you!
Great song. Cheers from Wisconsin
Done heard it before now. Keep on man. You ain’t going anywhere putting these songs out..
Keep em coming brother that voice takes me to a better place .
Sooooo talented, perfect, keep on keeping on brother, stay independant and stick it up em❣🇦🇺
Really good shit.
This just sounds amazing , keep it up dude!
i'm a youngin (20) and this is some of the best country of this year.
you are amazing brother, love your songs, keep it up!!!!
I like the tone of the older version to be honest by so great
New country would have this on repeat with their autotune and cg music...
Case of beer and a Zebco, name a more iconic duo, I’ll wait.
Incredible
Love it! Keep it real brother!
Sounds great looks great.  Unique sound that’s easily identifiable.  Sweet sounding guitar, where did you come up with that?DGCFAD tuning With the Capo.  Thats a new one to me.  Your playing is expertly fluid with respect to tuning and timing.  I would love to hear about your journey with the guitar playing?
Stay true to your heart and soul! Don't give in to them, you are worth more!
This is a classic right here dude
Chris, after you say “a case of beer and a ……”  What are the next two words?!?
I love how real you keep it.
I am a black dude out of Atlanta..ain't supposed to like your music but I do....keep on keeping on Brother.
You deserve it
62 years young and I can’t get enough of this music.
Charlene never let me down 85 Scottsdale
Just been praying about a girl and this was the 1st video on my feed when the laptop was opened,,,,  Thank you, Chris.   :)
The first time a guy made comparing his sweetheart to a Chevy. Smooth... just a tiny tiny bit rough... sexy and whole lotta sweet .  Who knew and didn't get shite for it... I'm assuming.
Ive got the same pole ..
Absolutely the best love song I've ever heard!!!❤
Please don’t let anyone change who and what you are
I have my 98 Chevy for almost17 years. It will look new some day
the 90 some chevy apparently says GMC on the grille in this vid but is the same dang thing nonetheless.. would gladly take the chevy over the ford any day. vortek !
Beautiful my bro, got a brotha in the feels. Shout out from new zealand 🇳🇿
It is a pleasure to listen to. Stay well, Joe Z
Keep on keeping on Oliver!
Man, I don't say this lightly, but you really are this generations Hank. That's something to be proud of.
Don't let them edit you ever!!!!!
This was great. Thanks
Old soul mastery for sure.... which channels the spirit of your audience, puts their energy into words and speaks it directly to their hearts - coherence.
And ANOTHER GREAT SONG love it brotha keep kicking em out we will keep listening and dwnlding ur songs😊
Well done
daaamn! hit after hit!
Hillbilly to hillbilly... Congrats !!!!! Glad to see common sense coming to the top and getting some attention.. Keep doing it !!!!!
Great sound
My new favorite artist.
That tent costs more than some 90s some Chevy. And that’s about an ‘09 Chevy he’s driving 😂
98' Chevy, be playing this song in it every day! love your songs
Wow. 💯
Three  pro songs in and this man is legit. Fire from heaven Legit.
Please continue to do this. Don't change anything. You are country music.
He's like Elvis or something.
This one hits. I have a '93 that I bought new and still drive today. A/C went out years ago but she's still rollin'.
Awesome song again!!! Keep your pure music coming, you have sold me! Hugs!
in a world of super, over produced, music that hits the youths ears... This is such a relief!! Old School Style hittin us hard! You are the man Chris!! Keep us this amazing work!
Love ❤️ it!  The raw music is awesome
I am adding this to my roadtrip music. I love it. WV girl, grew up camping every summer. THIS.. is bonfire music right here.
Wow!! This brother is killing it and don’t ever sellout to those clowns in Nashville Sir!! God Bless you and America 🇺🇸 🇺🇸💪🇺🇸🇺🇸💯
Chris you have to be one of my favorite artists ever!
I've got a 94' Silverado . Great pick-ups from the 80's and 90's . Chevrolets slogan used to be " the heat beat of America " .... To bad not just Chevy but the rest of our country has strayed . From the idea of american greatness .   Nothing like a square body Chevy truck .
Ahhhhhh one of my favs.
Please do Cobwebs and Cocaine with this new mic setup. 🙏
1:11 more like a 2010's some chevy lol
Very nice! Thanks for sharing!
Real honest music for real honest people
Thank you, Sir!!
Nice work brother. It's a 60-some Chevy over here, but it still resonates :)
Got damn.  I love you ol boy.
There just perfect
All his songs are only speaking the truth 😂
THIS MAN JUST KEEP PUTTING OUT BANGERS
You’re the voice of a generation. You may say you’re not a very good musician but that’s BS! You’re real. The common man is what you sing about. God bless you sir. I’ll be picking up my guitar again because of you. Thank you.
👑🌍🪐🌕🌟
This is a crazy deep song for me. I had a 90 some (1995) Chevy with a 350 when my wife and I dated and then married. What nostalgia for me, keep writing these songs Oliver! This resonates with so many people in this country right now. We are all supporting you, keep giving voice to all of our thoughts and feelings. Your career is moving around faster than a fart in a hot skillet. 👍🏻
I have a new favorite song. I love this guy's music. Thankyou and God bless you Oliver Anthony
New #1 song right here, this hits.
I can't believe how many people swore he was going to be a one hit wonder. He's nailing it on almost every song.
Own 3 90 some Chevy Suburbans. One 97 and two 99s
Wow… another anthem. ? 🤟
Legit
Another great song.  Stay true to yourself and your message. Keep making music.
Another amazing song. I couldn't wait to show my husband this one, he enjoyed it as much as I do.
Another good song, and just verifies fords are not the working man’s truck
Good job Chris. Hope to see you at my uncle glens soon
Great job keep it up u go
As I drive my Fathers 1985 El Camino
Bob Dylan who? Luke Bryan who? This is legendary like Johnny Cash brother.
Chris i cant tell if you're just incredibly gifted, or we have just been longing for authentic country music for a while now.  But if you consider both to be true it explains your overnight success.  I hope you stay independent and dont give those Nashville scum a penny. Just like Upchurch,  Tom McDonald,  Dax, Acal and many more.
Dang! Another song that I’ll be singing all week at work.  Thanks Buddy! 🙏🏻🎼
Jamey Johnson vibes
Daily driver is a 1990 suburban, in Costa Rica. 350 never fails to perform. True story, every day....
Love your message, delivery of music, and the relative simplicity of your recordings, like the depth of soul, richness, warmth listening to music on vinyl. In the woods😉
Turn -it up BROTHER!!! & TURN-IT LOOSE!!!
love from ny
So uh... what's next?  p.s. love the jams man.
Never has been an artist of this magnitude, he has taken the world by surprise!!! Love your music Oliver!!
love the forest
I am huge fan of all authentic, sincere and emotionally moving expressions of self! And you have much bravery. My friends don't understand why I like your music. They are braindead
You blow my mind man! Please don’t stop being yourself! And please don’t stop making that good old feel good country music! World needs more of that Oliver spirit ❤!
So I have listen to this song on several different channels to hear the comments on the words.  There is one area of the song that it is difficult to understand what the words are.  No matter who comments are, no one understands what the words are. The verse We take a case of beer and ? What are the rest of the words.  They are scrambled and just want you to clarify what they are.   I think you need to re-record the song and pronounce the words more clearly in that verse.  The verse repeats in the song and is still not understandable. Sorry but it needs work.  I’m not trying to be negative.  It does seem like people do like the tune.  You just need to pronounce the words more clearly.
That’s a good song bro, thank you
Mine is a 2000 z71
For whatever reason, I get Johnny Paycheck vibes from your songs. Loved his stuff, and now I'm a big fan of yours as well.
Oliver, aside from your awesome music, I'm wondering why several people are calling you Chris instead of Oliver?
Another great song! Bless you.! Thanks!
Lovin that late '70s model  chevy buts she gets down the road like a 2000 something❤️
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
love it!   I am no expert, but is that an ole 1911 holstered nicely in ur truck? looks well used :)
Love this song. Rich men north of Richmond is overshadowed this great song. Both are great.
He sure writes some SUPERB songs.  Hope he keeps it up.
My dude vibes Chris Whitley (rip) like a mf-er
Jesus saves
Great stuff ! I sure enjoy your music !
Loved that song already. Thanks chris, for uploading this better quality version. Will this version be on spotify soon?
Love it!
Pure Gold
Pure. Good. Ole. Country.
Make song with Chevy in title. Career over.  Already washed up.
If I were you...just do gigs and get paid in cash or gold and silver.  Stay away from the system. Stay true to you and your intent. It's sick to see how the "system" has so quickly culled you. Stand on your own. Fuck em and feed em fish heads.
LET'S GO, DIDNT EXPECT THIS TODAY 🙌🙌
This man is a just a American treasure, im from new york city...I grew up on hip hop and r&b. Now other then Johnny Cash I never really liked country...but this man right here got me walking through Brooklyn loving this mans soulful voice and his pure Energy. God bless this man
Just amazing how this sounds as good as a studio recording just there at his place and simple setup. Basic and brilliant!!
Great Song!
Good for you Sir. God bless.
I like the 'piece' at 1:20.
Nice. Good on you. Pick her some wildflowers.
Aend sum Lord day

Love your music it’s just simple and easy to enjoy.  Great work and I am praying for you to keep your sanity with all the craziness going on.  Enjoyed seeing you on JRE show.
We will pray for Chevy.
my dude, you make good old school country. I can't stand the new pop-ridden stuff they put out, it's infected the rock scene too. This is just good pure clean goodness.
This is gunna leap off bud
Chris’s voice has a beautiful rich timbre and pairs so wonderfully with the haunting melodies of his dobro. His songs makes a person stop and listen. They resonate with one’s soul. They’re of life and love and living. God bless you, my dear… stay true to you and close to God🙏
Just keep doing you man. You're doing just fine.
I can't wait to see what this guy does. We haven't had an artist like this in a very long time.
This is fantastic man
"My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises!" ~ Psalm 57:7
Not since simple Man I have a heard such authenticity
Another killer tune!!!!!!! God BlessYa!
You need some bass. Shit doesn't hit on my subs in my car.  😂😂
🔥
Yes another one!!! Love this, you can tell your confidence in your singing and playing is growing more and more with each song you post. God bless!
Hi Oliver, discovered your music from a friend in Kentucky, im in Australia, so glad to see and hear some real roots music for a change instead of all those manufactured shitty modern country sounds, was wondering who exactly would carry the torch of the 2020's generation and i have found it! keep up the great work dude, appreciate the down to earth emotive, honest, sincere music you make. Regards and all the best from "the land down under" - Lloyd
Love
Beautiful brother 👍🏻🇺🇸💪🏻
Yet another one......so good...so soulful !  Thanks for keeping my ears ( & me) happy!  Continued success for you Chris.  Curious...what tuning do you use on the Gretsch???
Definitely worth a repeat.  very catchy.   :)   Keep up the good work!  XOXO
LOVE IT!
Now watch the prices of 90 some Chevy's go crazy 😂 love this guy's music but who doesn't 🤙

Great tune brother.
Oliver, you know Merle Haggard is smiling down on you. Yes sir, a very big smile.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wonder song keep up the amazing work you have a true gift
Fantastic, stay true to yourself and ignore the haters. My late father would've loved your music.
Feels like a mix of “sitting on the hood of my car” and “big green tractor”
Love his voice
Where is the real version of Rich men north of richmon.
Thought Rich Men was a bunch of cheezy talking points put into a song. But this feels more genuine and and from the heart like it should.
Another great one.
You and that bent frame Chevy. Man you keep doing you. You got a like and a view from me for sure!!
don't stop!  Awesome
This has to be one of the BEST LOVE SONGS I’ve EVER heard
Love it. My ‘93 3500 has 367K on her and she’s still going strong.
Dang it Chris y'all dun it again.

Thank you
This is my new favorite song!  It’s Been on replay for over a week.
Sounds great😊 Thank You and God Bless 😊
Thanks Oliver, keep going, yer gonna be super country hall of fame stuff
People are spreading lies online now that you hate and reject your conservative fan base by the way you should probably address that before that picks up momentum because that is the majority of your fan base. The ones of us that have a brain know that its a lie but some people not so much.
I tell yea what, we smell the fresh air your breathin!
Keep em coming Oliver!
You have a great career ahead of you Oliver, you will go far for being 100% all the time, wouldn't mind meeting you shaking your hand and having a beer 🍺 with you sir..   keep providing us with great music
I love you Oliver 😍.  You are super Awesome ❤😊🎉
Great song young man! Keep living your dream!
He don't miss "nah he really don't miss" come preform down in East Texas brother
Love this. Thank you for sharing your music with us ❤
Damn I wish it was 60 some chevy 🇺🇸👊
I don't usually like country but this is amazing
Great song from a great artist. Thanks
I understand why u didn’t take that 8mil record deal, simple man and will make more from views and plays and downloads.  Stay independent my man.  Keep it up.
Great

LOVE IT CHRIS!!!   Keep em' comin brother.  Gotta say though, I would like to hear you up front, bass guitar and simple drums while you sing these songs. Nothing big, same setting, maybe even an acoustic bass guitar, nothing electric.
"90 some Chevy" shows a GMC.
thanks
Been waiting for a singer song writer like you to come around for a long time brother . Much love and respect from us here in  north Appalachia
We love you so Chris. Prayers surrounding you. Much respect!
Wow...
this is the one bro.
Love it.  I would like to hear it with a full band
Love your music Brother
I love the song I love what your about Keep on Keepin On and keep em comin.
You the man! Blessings from NYC
Love this...❤
Dig it brother.  Keep doing what you're doing.
Don't change for ANYONE, not one single bit, much love brother.
No backing band, no over processed music recording, no scantily clad women or men or others......just PURE TALENT.....loving it from downunder in Australia...
Damn I love this song. But I honestly think the original recording better than this one.
Mine was a 81 lifted Chevy Blazer whew was it a blast!
The only thing better would be to see that old Chevy run.
Can't wait to hear you on the Grand Ole Opera
Awesome! freaking Awesome.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like it!
Not to be picky, but Chevy has a 352 engine. My Ford had a 350. Love your music, Chris. I live near Spruce Pine and Marion. I hear the dialect you sing in every day. Feels like home!
Suddenly Gretch resonators are selling like hotcakes. Cheers, Mr Oliver!
The Woody Guthrie of modern times.
Don't become a mechanical machine, I hope you don't get overwhelmed by your success you deserve it definitely. I hope you get to enjoy all of this.
I hope it works out for you.
I love all ur songs so much! ❤❤❤ I'd love to buy an album of ur music if you release one!!
Stands up Clapping. 90 some Chevy. I got one of those. Appreciate your music brother from a different mother.
I have a 90 some Chevy...and I'm a right winger , does that irritate the hell outta ya?
Top
All the shit we go through in lives builds us into who we are. When my moment comes, I hope to handle as well as you have so far.
This is a great song.
Another 🔥 tune.  Congratulations on your success.
This might be my favorite song of yours yet.
👍👍
Just made everyone else in the business look silly.
Nice 😀
Reminds me of storyteller Loretta Lynn.
Really great man. Had a few 90 somfin chevys. Love your tunes brother for real. Thank yah
My favorite song yet.
There's a man out there with a rebuttal to your songs. That white collar pos is making a mockery of the working man. Please give a rebuttal!!
Dude should have taken the biggest deal offered.  Yes he's talented,  but this is the internet people will move on real quick like. Good luck dude.
Wow 😮
LOVE THIS SONG!  ❤❤❤❤
I have the same Microphone. Rode NT1-A
Personally, county died when the great Jonny Cash passed. Thanks for bringing quality country back. Love your music.  Thanks man.
The iPhone version of this was already my favourite of your songs! Glad to have an HQ version. Gotta say, the lyrical stanza from "she's hotter than hell" up to "I'm her Cash" are some of my all time favourite, regardless of genre. Bravo good sir!
Chevy owes you $$$$ brother...
I love it, he is old school country music.
Everybody who has a 90s or early 2000 chevy is punching the air right now lol. Oliver Anthony just single handedly increased the price/value of older Chevys. LFG!
Thank you so much for sharing your story and your music. I’m a disabled USMC veteran. I love my country and I am grateful that at a minimum your music as gotten a little common sense put back into discussions. Thank you again. I really love your music…
I like how you're bringing attention to a favorite type of music of mine.
My brother look at what Jesus is doing with you! Your on the path. KEEP YOUR FAITH MY FRIEND AND KEEP Making that awesome music! MAY THE LORD CONTINUE TO BLESS YOU AND GUIDE YOU ALL OF YOUR DAYS.
My Man!!
You know I heard something the other day about modern country music being in a decline...Maybe it's because most of them have forgotten the working men and women of the world. They're sell outs. When Chris Stapelton charges $250+ for concert tickets.... What average working person can afford that? Oliver Anthony and his music have struck a cord with every blue collar working person around the  world. And that is why the big time, elitest. country music stars are fading. They've forgotten where they came from.
Really good voice. Kind of reminds me 70s - 80s country.
Dude, you are a breath of fresh air in the music business.
Drive a 2003 buick century with a tow hitch🍻
Good stuff Chris🤙🏽Love my Chevy.🇺🇸
“She rides just right when you turn her on” 🎶🤍🌾 This song is the 2023 version of heartland country from the 90’s and I AM HERE FOR IT! Love all your music Chris! 🙏🏼 Truly, thank you for being you!
Oliver is amazing how he sings about middle Americans working hard every day barely making ends meet to take care of themselves and feed and shelter their families. He also gets that corporate greed profit margins because he makes such terrible wages is through the roof . CEOs and large business owners have set up wealth for the next 15 generations of their  families. Lakeshore Houses, Cottages, condos in Cali and Miami, cars,  boats, all the schools for there children and childrens children.all because they pay Oliver and rest of us a portion of what we deserve to build their products. He also knows there are more of us regular people than the ultra rich business owners. This guy gets it!  Now we need to make some changes and vote the opposite political party as the rich billionaire business owners. Because we are not them. Let's face it their greed hold us down and if we continue to vote the same party as them because of small hot button issues things will never change. The Separation of wealth in this country will just widen and widen. Oliver is sick of it and knows it's time to take a stand! He sings what 70% of America is thinking. Follow the money!
I came to know about you with "the song" but I wish I knew your music before! I'm puertorican,  full on and accent,   even tho different culture, I love your music and I feel it brother, one day I'd love to buy you a beer!!!!! Till then bless you homie
Do me a favor and the world a favor, never stop recording your songs in the forest, I think if you ever recorded in a studio you will have lost everybody, this is what makes you real and very important to all of us, we all love you and believe it or not we need you and your voice and your beautiful songs❤ you are Perfect Just the Way You Are😊
I drive a 90 Chevy, you damn right the only thing sound better is when she come running up to me. Dogs at my feet looking for some love… it’s always a hard day. God bless brother.
Even your 90s something chevy thinks you are crazy for touting the rich men north of Richmond's favorite line, that "diversity is our greatest strength".
Dude can do it all!!!
Great song. Really liked it. I enjoy the mood that this song creates when you listen to it a few times in a row.
Why cain't the "country" singers today do this. It ain't like it's hard to do actual country music. 🤠
I love his phrasing, not country fan but I can appreciate good musicianship and song writing
Amazing!!
Real country music. Now you should write the “what ever happened to country radio” song. It’s all pop and hip hop. I call it Bro Country. And I hate it
(after reading your comments this audio is from the video) Damn bro, how do you get such a pristine studio quality out in the woods with one damn mic?  Did you even send this off to be mastered? I understand you added reverb in post but still.  You must be the greatest home engineer ever, I don't care what polar pattern you're set on, that's a condenser mic, outdoors, with no sound reinforcement.  Amazing.  What DAW software / plugins do you use?
Wow 🤩
Another really fantastic song.
I guess you can call me a fan! Everything you've released keeps landing on my play list! Bless you brother
You sir make country music enjoyable. In fact you make music enjoyable again. The music industry has lost site of what's good music. You make real true music, regardless of genre.
AN APPALACHIAN JOHNNY CASH!!!!!!!!
When is the album coming out?
Chris...Thank You and Your Dogs...You the Dog Poet...🎶💃
The soul is in the music. We all have been listening to the music industry feeding us what they thought we all wanted. What they forgot is the soul. We the people built this country with our soul.
A nuther goodern 🤠 keep em commin!
I’ve never once in my life thought to myself; yeah I like that country song,. Until this man came out the woods with his damn guitar and dogs. I will buy this album when it drops 💯
Every song is a hit wonder 😂
Awesome song! You can’t beat those Chevys! If you know what I mean! Keep ‘em coming!
I love listening to your voice Oliver I love your cowboy songs they are so peaceful and bring a calming to my sufferig in Virginia, why so many years and so much pain, why i hold my faith to keep walking and why do i continue to forgive and ask god to help me forget and its the most that I can do to keep living and loving my self, this loveless bird cant fly anymore or can i?     Thanks Oliver for your songs.
great song
You are so gifted as a writer and a musician.....   keep doing what your doing...
Amazing song. Reminds me of when I was 22-23
The way the forest echoes the music is like a warm pillow.
Awesome song, got me a 1990 Silverado its like a rock and still going
America wants this type of music not the crap that’s pushed on us on the radio! Thank you Oliver!
Just like an OG!
Nice!
You are so lovable and real 🥰 Much love from the land of Jesus
Man I am blown away your just so Authentic and the type a music the worlds been missing for a long time that can relate to others on a different level!!! Much love my Friend wishing nothing but the best.
Thank you 🥸
Just outstanding!!! You sir are the best storyteller that my wife and I have ever had the pleasure to listen to!!!!!
Please keep putting them dogs in these videos!
crank out the tunes brother
Chris your so good  you could fall in dog shit and get up wiping gold off....Don't change a thing...Greeting from Murfreesboro Tennessee.....
Thank you for your words, they are easy to feel and mean too much. All i can do is ask a favor and handle any fame with grace,  just the way you have.  Never forget where you come from and enjoy the moment. All that is easier said than done I'm sure.
90 Some Chevy.  Back when Chevy made a decent truck.
I fucking hate country music. But brother, I love ur music
What the has to say is worth hearing and considering.
You are the 🐐  hoss foreal i live in caroline county VA I'm glad we have someone representing VA but most of all the American people keep doin you brother 💯
it is such a pleasure to listen to you sing ! You Write Great attention grabbing lyrics! Stay Blessed!
Your music really hits the sweet spot between country and classic rock. It like real people country not just some sucker singing yee haw.
I loved it.
Chris  , all I can say is thank you sir. 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
This is what real country sounds like. Not today's generic Bullshit music.
i really think you are the new "Man in Black". Singing for the common man, the poor, the downtrodden, the regular working class people. Johnny Cash would be proud of your music for sure
Keep it up brother! 👊🏼
Love it. I have a 92 chev farm truck. It’s a beauty 350.
1:39 what da dog doin?
Very nice ❤
reminds me of Jim Croce
thank you Chris
May GOD continue to bless you to overflowing!
Glad to see country music is back.
Wow, he's got this one sounding amazing.
I take it back, this is my absolute favorite.
Love this one

BUDDY, you are the change. Love the music. you're definitely a hidden gem that has been found.
I like that your music has a real message and a smooth delivery. It's a welcomed relief from this modern pop country.
💕
The week before your first song blew up I prayed to God to make himself real to the world in a way they can understand. A week after you posted your song I finally listened to it. I wondered if he answered my prayer but then you shared Proverbs 4 20-27 on the largest podcast in the world. Now I know he answered my prayer because that kind of stuff does not happen in todays world. Thank you for being a messenger 🙏
keep it it bid 🐕.  would love too meet you in person and take you arrowhead hunting in Missouri.   love too walk with you and figure life out. let me know if you're interested
Here me out, sometime in the future a mashup of Oliver and Yelawolf. Yelawolf has a whole series of songs titled "box chevy". I think it would be awesome, not for everyone, but awesome.
This song is like an ol’ Chevy!! 💯💯
I don’t know why but this is giving me Merle Haggard vibes.👏👏👏👏👏👏👏great song young man
Best song yet
i got a good women and a good 93 gmc both the same age too
I love your voice and music. I’m old (60) and grew up listening to my dad’s country music. You apparently are an old soul as you fit into that old time country blue grass genre. Thank you for introducing this incredible sound and your message to new generations!
Pure poetry! 👏
Simply amazing thank you for the amazing music
Any one calling this man fake or hating on his music needs to take a good long look in the mirror and realize you are the problem in the world, spread love not hate, feels like not enough people were taught “got nothing nice to say don’t say anything at all”   Keep it coming turning a metal head and rap fan into a country fan. Much love Chris
Love listening to your songs!!
Love love it. Love all your songs. Great. Keep up great work.
God, I miss country like this!  From the heart, simple unprocessed... Nashville outta take notice! Love you man! May God bless you and your family!
I know I was subscribed to your channel, but when I clicked on this video it showed I wasn't subscribed. That is weird.
What a great song. Love song at that. I can’t get enough ❤
DO YOU HAVE A NORWEGIAN ELKHOUND!❤❤
WOW.... just WOW! I love this tune. Well written and well executed. Chris does even better when he taps it down just a bit. It goes you a chance to appreciate his voice even more in a smooth and relaxed presentation. Excellent!!!
You're a good musician.  Well played.  They're believing it.
Awesome song!  Thanks for the great music, it really makes me feel something.  🦅 🇺🇸
Hard to beat an old Zebco 33.
Thank you for the music.
This man just doesn't miss❤
Only a God give gift can sing like that..... God Bless you for sharing your spirit and talent....
🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🤘Awesome 🇺🇲
If she’s my Carter, I’m her Cash.
It's so beautiful❤️
98% of people watching this have no clue 😂😮
Another banger 🔥
This is the cure for the bro country, hick-hop horseshit that the radio pretends is country.
Damn good song.
Listening to this on a portable speaker while driving my red 97’ Chevrolet C/K 1500.
I’ll be watching you on the CMA show next year!!!!
thank you.
Commenting for algorithm purposes.
great song.
This is a great song with a great beat.  I'm a great guy is finally successful and a voice for so many people. Thank Chris!!!
I got me an 80 some Chevy.  She rides just fine.  They built `em better back then. I'm talking about trucks, not women.   😁
1990s chevy had transmission recall
Beautiful art there
Sounds amazing! Do you plan on releasing a version of all your songs on the good microphone. I think all your songs are great but the updated ones are even better. I think you should release all of your songs updated in one album.
Awesome!  You have a gift.  Keep going.  You are penetrating the music world like no one before.  Without the record label companies.  Love it!
You make great music man.  What country music used to be.
You make great music man.  What country music used to be.
You make great music man.  What country music used to be.
Pawpaw music! . Young man with an old soul. Bring it ALL back brother. Its on your back now. Stay strong
❤❤❤
Great song brother!
Man, this is one is hotter than asphalt on a summer day! Love it man, real country!
Chris- you are inspiring to me as a fellow musician and songwriter. I used to write a ton 20 years ago… before my meds for mental health. It’s so hard. Thanks for the music. I have a very similar guitar, but I more of a tele picker, as you may have guessed.
Dam, that was something
I open and like only Anthony views.  Not people hanging on his coat tails trying to get picks.  Stay true to yourself Man.
Man, this hits different at 3am after 8 beers
This what you hear after you take that WRONG TURN
If it leaks oil then it has oil👍
How does he do it? Hits keep dropping!!!!
I agree with one comment on here your voice is perfect for the music you make. I love the raw sound of it!
Had a 1990 silverado raised in it you have my support not much but I love your Jib you define a man and morals
Singing about my high school years , we will always remain free brother
As the proud owner of a '94 Chevy I bought in 98, this track hits a chord in my soul ❤‍🔥
Amen
A case of beer and a Zebco, damn it man. ❤🎉
❤ beautiful song…
I hope you never change, I love you music and agree with you on world today!! I know it might be hard but stay true to your message/music, you will go far without the music industry, we have your back Sir!!!
I love this ❤
So nice to hear this affirmation of life and God's  good gifts!
Biden & Harris’s Folly = 26AUG2021
His best song
Stay true to yourself friend. Jaw dropping integrity so far, at the same time take their money when it's right and do good.  Cant wait for more of your material. I've been waiting a long time to get rid of the Luke Brian hip thrust bull shit. Be the change, it's yours if you want it.
Cool
The absolute perfect mix of folk and country.
This is FIRE🔥 You have the secret cheat code my friend. Keep staying true and being you. ✌
I just finish hearing this song for the first time. I got up when it was over and walked out to the Garage and fired up my 1998 Silverado with the 350 V8 in her and drove her for about 30 miles, then came back home. There was a tear in this old mans eyes when I pulled her back in the Garage. Bought her new in 98' and the two of us just turned 100,000 miles together recently...  The 98' still gets jealous though when I park her next to her older brother, the 1965 Chevrolet C-10 Custom Short Bed with a 350 V8 also... Love my Chevy's.
Bravo, Chris.
Happy to hear some real country.
He is an off gridder! That is the future to tell the elite and wealthy evil people; F you!
Love it!
Fantastic!
Brother you are a gift from God. Your music hits the hearts of millions mate. 🙏🇦🇺
This is a very raw unique country singer! He is pure of heart and gives city corrupt folk a big F finger! Smart and humble fellow!
Dam bro another great song 🎵 👏 😳 😂😂😂😂
Good voice!
This is great  who is he 😉
Groovy
I keep listening and every time it gets better please keep doing you flow your heart.. sending this to everyone absolutely beautiful
LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!! Damn fine....
You got the GMC truck in a song about a 90 sum Chevy. 😂 Great song tho mang. We appreciate you!
Your singing takes my memories on a journey to Woodstock the movie I saw in the late seventies. Can the lyrics appear on the video? May be useful for many like me Asian
Great song
Authentic, which is exactly what a lot of people need right now. Keep being you fella.
Yes I saw the older video of this song awhile back. I like this better. 😉
Matthew 13:18-23 18 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. 20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. 22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
This is amazing man. Glad you're getting the recognition you deserve! This is damn good country music. Keep telling your story.
Songs to move to the country to.
Love it💞💞💞✝️✝️
I have lived/breathed you for a few weeks now and have been trying to spread the good word of your emergence to anyone whose head has been in the sand. That being said, I prefer the original BY FAR. Don't lose that raw edge that made you special, man!
Keep invoking the name of the Lord bro!!! It feeds the soul with every lyric sung!!! We love you down here on Mississippi
GMT400 🤟🏼
From Canada EDM AB, keep it coming you speak for all the working class ppl Much love <3
Hey Christopher... that Proverbs on JRE was epic. God smiled.   P.s Cool song brother.
Love this!!
Very few people find their talent and make the best of it.  Nice job
This is country music !!
Whas that beautiful or what? The videography was great too.
God bless.
Oh my word… I love it! You’ve renewed my love for music at a time when I’m just fed up with 99.9% of Christian, Country and any other type of “pop” artists.
You sing from the heart oliver and that's the talent GOD gave you so keep doing what he has planned for you. I really enjoy listening to your talent and how it's reaching and inspiring others. Thank you and keep your eyes focused on the lord and everything will be ok
damnnn
The original version uploaded is better.
I miss my 97.  It was the best truck I ever owned.🥲
I love this song.
Music industry trying to cash out on rural living once again.  Great song, man.  I was really proud of you turning down the first few deals offered to you.
Please keep making music for us/me  😏
Dude, don’t be afraid of success! You have talent and that’s what people have latched onto. The wake-up call of the famous song helped but ultimately it is your extreme talent that shines the most
Can’t go wrong with a Chevy specially, if it’s a Corvette.
Please post your lyrics in your video descriptions. I see a lot of "lyric" videos that are just blatantly wrong... your words are too good, I hate to see them getting twisted up
Your soul has such amazing grasp on how the real struggles that good people with good hearts must go through your blessed with a voice of reason don't ever lose that thankyou
Love this!
Listening to this with my zebco in my hand ❤
I love your voice and the music! While I love the new songs. please do ain't got a dollar next.
His voice is pure gold 🪙
Real music, from the soul. Don't ever sell it!
Thank you Oliver !
we shooud all comment and like each video 10 times minimum
What a great song!!
I play Cuatro. I can vibe this.
Oliver….. one word from your work….. fire fire fire fire. Rich men north of Richmond fire
REAL country music, not like most of the woke formulaic garbage coming out of Nashville.
Wonderful words !!! Wonderfully Written
Another great one!  I love the way you paint pictures & comparisons with your lyrics.  Very gifted, words & vocal styling from the heart.
So good
Bravo sir, bravo!
Great song... reminds me of a nice mix of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Hank William Jr., with a dash of Blue Grass... just a great song... like sipping nice aged wisky.... smoky smooth...
AWESOME SONG 👍🙏❤😇
Great songwriting and a very sharp vocal. Reminds me of people like Merle Haggard and George Jones.
Virginia Is For Lovers🥰 You are so original & fresh! I absolutely love your music. Plum tickled that ya being recognized for the wonderful singer & somg writer that you are😁 Stay true to yaself, young man.  Stay Free✌💕🤔🇺🇸
Rocks dude!  We needed this brother.   Sincerely, Western, North Carolina
Good tune
You might not have the vocal range of opera or the fingers of Eddie Van Halen but you're a good musician, singer and songwriter because it comes from the heart. That can't be bought or manufactured in a studio.
Chris don’t miss! Another banger
Wishing you all the success and may it change you only for better.
You are literally this generations Johnny Cash. TBH growing up I couldn't stand most country/blue grass music because of my love of hip-hop/r&b but most of all that new stuff that's out is absolute trash. Glad the algorithm guided me here. YouTube usually does us all dirty. 😅
I’ve been listening to this one for weeks (the old recording). This is my favorite OAM song.
Love it
Great stuff brother Great stuff.
Congrats on well done music and marketing. Times like these need the voice you have.
❤❤❤
Love it
Gota luv them OBS buddy. But I am more of a square body. But on both.
🇿🇦 This music hits home the world over! Brilliant! Authentic! The Gingers score a 10-7 round 😊
Nice one Chris.
Sweet tent.  I really want to get one with a woodstove.
So, what firearm is that in the truck. I do not recognize the make/model?
Amazing song great job Chris!
I’m not a country fan due to I grew up to blues and rap sir but you’ve gained a listener from my side ❤🙏🏽
sure reminds you of the one that got away dont it....
Thanks for doing this one next Chris it is one of my favorites.
Dude is really an impressive lyricist, this one is just as good as rich men
Bill and the good ole days.
The frogs in the creek..."KEK"  🤫
Run a farmers market, Roots Produce. Drive a 93' Chevy 1500 long bed with wooden gates built on her. Keep doin what your doin brother
A request from a foreign fan: Can official lyrics be provided? The ones available on YouTube and on lyrics sites are terribly inaccurate.
You have real raw talent sir. Keep cranking em’ out. I love your music.
Half million views in 10 hours.  Get it Chris!  Another great song.
My dad loved "old country."  He'd have loved to listen to this guy.  Keep up the great work.
I have never heard the culture of ancient Virginians captured the way you do. Makes my heart fly.
Love it man
God Bless
I hope you find your true love in this lifetime!
So true 👍..
Chris, I know you don't have any use for music industry, but, man, you need a band. These songs are gold, and deserve to be heard in their full potential. I've thought many times of grabbing my Les Paul and my Martin and driving up to Farmville to find you.  I grew up just down the road from ya in Victoria. Got my license in Farmville when I was 16.
The right lyrics are so damn obvious when you hear them, its like why didn't someone already write this song? Just goes to show you that there are still perfect lyrics we know by heart already that haven't been written yet like this song. Bravo!
Great songs for this Labor Day weekend!   Thanks Chris
Nice !!! Thanks Oliver for great music ....
Bro reminds me of Colter wall and Tyler Chidlers and Zach Bryan
I like 1911’s myself. Best pistol ever made. Love your music.
Love someone getting back to 3 cords and the truth.
Anthony Oliver, the forest around you is excellent for acoustics ... better that ANY studio...thankyou again for sharing. 🕊
Never change man!
No i dont like country at all and i love your song very cool. You know everything happens for a reason before i think you knew you were not living up to your potential and you knew it…
God bless you brother you have a gift from the good lord above. We send lots a love from Canada.
Wow!
Man this song has been going through my head for 2 weeks now. This is a beautiful acoustic version. I really enjoy the Spotify version as well for its own reason. The world has been needing them some of us VA boys 👊
I prefer the original version 🤷‍♂️
Man your a hell of a song writer its a breath of fresh air
Please cover Nirvanas song "where did you sleep last night?" I have listened to your cover of that and played it in my head based off of the song of yours I've already heard and that classic that I've known for years and I'm telling you you would murder that song Chris. You might see this, you might not... But if you do just at least play around with it and give it a try and tell me that I wasn't on the something LOL nothing wrong at all with being original that's one of my favorite things about artists like you and others that people don't know about because they don't get famous off of the songs they sing, they write em for artists we know. But you my friend write your own songs and sing them from your soul and it 😢.
What's that word stupendous.
90'S, Oliver must be rich!... 87 burb brother!!! Thank you. Killed it on Rogan byw. Cheers from the coffee truck!
Amen and Amen! ❤
i listen to techno and hardcore trap/memphis krunk but i like your music
What are your thoughts on people remixing rich men north of Richmond?
I'm 38 and have always hated country music. Your songs speak to the soul. There is something special about you. Keep spreading God's word.
We all dream of having a man like that and trust me, I’m 69 and have had a few😅
Finally someone to bring back true Country music. This song was sung perfect. Made me smile.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great song son. Keep it up and we'll  keep listening.
Thanks for making country music great again!
Yes!
🔥💯🔥
Another wonderful song!!  Don't ever change...you give people hope because you sing what they have been feeling ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤ Another hit!
Listening to your music I feel like Homer Simpson when he discovers lorlean lumpkin at the bar. Your voice just has this honesty to it. And I feel like I resonate with it. Are you bringing out a full album? because I would buy it straight away.
i got a 91 w 454 4 speed c6p, this song is my favorite , farly surpasses any song i heard before cept maybe  AJ Sanders - Chevy and Daddy
Blessings on blessings, thank you ❤
Keep them coming Cumberland!
This guy is American
Man I love your music.  Keep doin good by yourself, brother.
You sir make my heart happy.   Please please never change
Something special is running through your veins :)
Just donnt ever go to crick picken in va your career woukd be ruined...pitcock is a pos
I had an 88 chevy but jammed a 454 in it.  was a white trash hot rod for sure.
Jajajajajaajajaa you looks like my boss
Makin Country Great Again!
Ty nick for being faithful…Father in the name of your son Jesus Christ bless this man with your wisdom and peace amen
Heckuva love song right there.
Wow.

Would love to hear a rendition of the national anthem !!!!! 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
Thank you Chris for sharing your talent & passion 😊
I like you Dogs 🐾🐾
Alabama says Oliver is great
This has been my 2nd favorite after my deep dive on Spotify but I’d have to say Doggonit is by far my favorite! Hopin for a video of that one at some point, and I’m not even a fan of country music but I might be now lol
You could sang the coca-cola song and it would sound like heaven to the ears 👂
Such a Great Voice!! I'm Enjoying your music! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Everywhere I drive, I always hear your music blasting out someone's window.. It's a breath of fresh air. I just hope they get the message.
Chris keep doing what you’re doing. Don’t let nobody change you or your music. I don’t use the word perfect describing anyone, the only perfect one was nailed to a cross years ago, but I’d say your music is about as close as you can get. Keep up the good work.
2:34 Looks like a '95 maybe '96? lol
might be my favorite yet
Boomer Guns.
Another good song.
Music just sounds different outside in the woods 😏
All that auto-tuned crap can't hold a candle to this man singing and playing his guitar. This sounds cliche, but these songs go straight to the heart because of the emotion put into them.
Chris, this just proves that you belong to be where you’re at!
This guy!!! Awesome 😎
Ahhhhh, back to a simpler time before the phones, internet, and all today's distractions.  A time of going out in nature and spending time with the one you love, laughing, talking and just enjoying each other's company. The most human thing we can do.  Amen Chris, great song.
Heck yeah, love your music and your message, you have a great way of speaking to a worn down nation!!!
Guy in the woods with a guitar sending lightning bolts through all of us ...    Right time for this thank you brother 🙏
I can easily imagine, drums and bass. A playful sound
As a pure Bowtie man myself this brings me tears....just beautiful
My bf has a 87 chevy, I sent him this because its totally our life! 😊💚 Thank you for sharing your gift!
"I'm higher then gas" That is an amazing bar
Should do a collaboration with William Elliot Whitmore..
Another Banger 🍻 it’s got me missing home.
93 S10 cold beer and that red dirt road/ headed to the river to wet my zebco/ 2am ice on the eyelets/ sitting on the pier of a waxahatchee slough/ light reflecting off that water from a moon so blue/ hank playing on a little weather radio/ just a chilling this is the speed that i like life to go.....   Slow
👊🏼
another good one!
Freaking amazing
Just wanna say THANK YOU OA !!!!  Do what you do and do what feels right. You’re a light in the dark for sooooo many of us!   From one man to another……. THANK YOU ❤.
Yewwww
One number one after another. God is blessing you for accepting him and not being afraid to tell everyone.
Putting the country back in country ! Bravo 👏
A case of beer and a?
He loves his car and his lady. Sure does.
Natural talent just, WOW!!
i dont like country music.  i said that 30 minutes ago. now i fucking hate that i never gave it a chance.  this is fucking beautiful.
Pure, sweet, soulful sound to your voice. I love it!!
This. Is. Incredible dude….You are sooooooo talented by telling it like it is…The music is real and raw.      I love this ❤❤❤
Nothing better than a country song about an old car ❤

You’re writing some great music brother.  Thank you for sharing your music with all of us.
Not a one hit wonder. Oliver's got it in spades!
Just song after song from this guy soeaks to you! About time we had someone like this!
I have a 77 K15! Love this song. Maybe do a song for some square bodies. Your voice is on point!
Respect Oliver Anthony.. much Love Bro! 😎 🇺🇸
It's the red hair that has you on fire! Great job, fantastic music! Congratulations on your well-deserved success! Have a great long weekend 🤗
Beautiful song brother!!! Keep it up
Keep Being A Beast !!
All glory and praise to GOD brother !!! He has done this, and HE has mad plans for you  , HE is going to take you places unfathomable to the human mind. You have a GOD gifted voice. Use your gift to glorify HIM.   Jeremiah 29:11  Eziekiel 36:26  PTL !!!
The Nod to Johnny Cash is appropriate because as he changed the direction of Country music in his day so you are doing the same now, I’m a music snob and so far every song is a classic 🫡
Can someone tell me what he says after "a case of beer and _______". Thanks
This dude literally just made a song that should be a bigger hit that Rich Men…
Another heater! Good stuff bro
Oliver, i haven't read or heard anyone i know say anything negitive about you or your music. But if i do, it wont matter, because they dont matter, lol!)   Im'a nobody, lol! But i'll tell ya this though, im very picky about the music i listen to, i like all kinds of music, but just very picky (i believes it gots a lot to do with the fact that im on the spectrum...so ive been told)😂Lol!!.. I like your music and most importantly i love what you're all about, thank you, Oliver! 💜🙏 Keep up the killer job you're doing as a musician, and most importantly, as a fellow human being❤
Havnt heard great country since Merl, George jones and Strait. Your voice sir and words are equal. Congrats on all deserved success.
Hell yeah brother I had a 92 gmc 4x4 I loved that ol girl
Awesome
Beautiful song ❤ You are gifted to us ❤ your voice is gorgeous 🥰  Watching from Sydney Australia 🇭🇲4️⃣September 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣3️⃣
So nice.   Love you man.. Peace and be safe
Man im loving all of your music keep making these masterpieces
My favorite  song so far. My husband  of almost 26 years relate to this.
I cant wait til he gets on a track with Dr.Dre, Pharrell, or Adam Levine.  I have never seen or heard of a ginger angel, cause thats what this brotha is.
What's the words after case of beer and ?????
While Nashville is full of billionaires and bs entertainers, a poor man is in the woods making REAL music for REAL hardworking everyday people and we can relate to him. His voice speaks to us and for us.
Stay true to yourself brother. Fuck society!
❤❤❤  thank you
Great song!
you bring joy and hope too me and my loved ones, thank you, lots off love from Denmark, hope you make a trip to skandinavia to play. best wish 1<3
Trump 2024 till the world blow!
Oliver your one of those cool guys where you can sit back and and share a beer and stories
Damnit boy!! You never cease to amaze me 🙏🙏🙏❤
Do it by yourself brother dont rely on these record labels to push your music down mainstreams throat. Keep doing what your doing and you will go alot further then you ever could woth a record label. Your authenticity is what makes you relatable to people of all walks of life including myself and millions of others loving your music
I'm tinkering on a 90 Chevy right now. But not a 350. Got a 454.
Damn… 👍🏻👍🏻
The Man we needed.  Tough times make hard Men.
Women make it worth it, hell of a song.
Thank you Chirs
Gotta 90 Scottsdale and it feels good
Aaaaahhhhh!!! Love it❤ 😮😮😮😮
Keepem coming! Love it! I remember them BA 90 some chevys!
Algorithm
How country is supposed to be!!  Thanks for another one buddy
This guy is amazing
I may be from Richmond, VA, but I have spent some time in the Blue Ridge Mtns, living and spending weekends, I c an guarantee you, that is the best living I have ever done
We are raising up our conservative, American loving hero's. May you lead the next generation lovingly, Oliver!
I wish I could go back to the good old days when the world was normal. Thanks for all the memories.
Don’t ever lose who you are brother. Your music is moving.
God bless you, keep killin it brother
Loyalty is hard to find
Great stuff. That is all.
Rock On Chris !!!!!
Looks like you got yourself a mic ❤
Lyrically, this guy is more on point thjan any artisti in the last 30 years.  Keep it up, bro.
Just good ol simple song..... just what a country song should be
I've never enjoyed country, but I sure do when you sing. You warm my soul❤
I actually like this version more than the original
Aint nobody put any better than that.......
You sir are the music revival this country needed. Your tunes are uniting a nation all over and some! Keep ‘em comin son! I tip my hat to ya!
New fan keep that great work coming.
Yet again another unbelievable song that hits deep in the soul.  Keep using that pen and that gretsch!
Dang me , that was something. What a wordsmith!
Man... never stop..don't get caught up in that Hollywood crap. You are and will be supported all on your own by all of us. Don't get Eminem'd and 'lose your self'
Too bad the "closed captions" don't pick up all the words correctly. That's BS
Thank you for that brother. Thank you.
Mans voice is so full, it fills in any empty space in quiet
Keep staying original Chris
Take a break
❤❤❤
nice, i like it :) great song my dude!
WOW ....INSTANT HIT SONG....KEEP IT UP; YOUR VOICE IS A MINISTRY TO US!
❤️👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼❤️
I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for true country music like this. This man is blessed with unbelievable talent. The new Cash.
This is beautiful. And fun! It's great to see your "other' side and hear how beautifully you do both. I'd love to buy a cd of your songs, any chance of you doing one? I'm probably the only person left on earth who doesn't download music and prefers cds, though.
A natural talent with a solid and simple but powerful message!! God bless you Oliver!
👍
I like it. Just switch out the Chevy to 90 some Ford (ranger) :)  Heck yeah. Keep killing it.
This man doesn't miss.
My Dad loved his 90 (70) Some Chevy!
Great just great 👍
God Ole American country music is just pure
You're too perfect. You must be a CIA plant 😅❤
I've  missed your kind of music  .. you've got that special  knack...keep on it ... I love my Bowties to boot...cheers 🇨🇦
I just sold my '92 Chevy today 🙁
95 chevy wit my ol zebco 33 pushin buttons legoo
His normal talking voice has no twang, funny how he sings this
Great song!
The man!
Got two 90s Chevys.  A 1994 C3500 Standard Dually, and a 1994 K1500 Automatic.  Both with 350 TBIs.  Nice and simple engines!
I have hated country music most of my life.  Your music is honestly the only country music I love and is on replay in my head.  Keep being a bad ass country star and don't let the world change you.
This is real country music
I think his voice stands out better in this one than in Rich Men.
I know you don’t wanna hear it   But how do I buy it?    Album songs, whatever.
Cheers to the OBS🎉
"She's hotter than hell, I'm higher than gas, she's sweeter than honey, I'm poor white trash, she ain't had a check that I couldn't cash, I guess if she's my Carter then I'm her Cash." Absolutely brilliant lyrics.
Its feels, liike your music is a time machine to a better place in life.
I'm speechless, brother. Keep singin' them soulful songs with that awesome baritone voice. God has blessed you, and now you're blessing other folks. Lovin' it!
💪💪💪
Great, now he's going to piss off all the Ford guys😂
I'm not a country music guy, but I like his songs.
Real nice 😊
Great song!!! Keep doing what you are doing!!! Don't fall into the trap of mainstream music!!!
I love your music but this song is easily my favorite. Love it man.
From the heart brother.
I like the older version that's posted better! He really is something special! ❤
The 2020's have found their Bob Dylan.  Good.
Wow wow what a beautiful voice love from the hills of Tennessee God bless you in Jesus Christ name Amen ❤️🙏🙏
Amazing buddy. Never change.
You have touched my heart before I learned about who you are. My grandfather was a coal miner, my family is from VA & WV.  My Granddaddy meant the world to me.  He & my Grandmother were friends with Lester Platt and Earl Scruggs.  Long before I came along. They would love your music. I love the way you play the guitar. So much talent! Stay true to yourself and you will be fine! I’m 56 and a huge fan!   Much Love and Thank You for your music!
Love this one.  This sounds so good to me on this day.  I woke up this morning to hear Jimmy Buffet passed. I have been feeling comply down.   This song got me thinking in another direction.
Great song.
God I love this. Great to listen to at end of day
You remind of someone else that gets people of all ages that don't like rap to listen to his rap. I never liked country, but I love listening to you my brother.
Absolutely amazing. Just wanna drive down a country road with my arm out the window listening to this one. Keep up the great work sir!!! May the Lord bless and Keep you. Jesus Bless you 🙏❤
As a veteran your songs really touch me. I've lived in almost every state and you have touched everyone by opening your knowledge and soul. God Bless Oliver "American" Anthony.
Dang! You have what it takes to stir the soul, bring a smile, make one think, break the heart, heal the heart and sway!! Keep up the great music!
This is a damn good tune. Can see myself with this playing in the background during the best and most simplest of times. In fact thats happening right now on my back porch watching some ball
Thank you Sir.
Another banger 🔥🔥🔥
Yessir!
Alright then
this dude has some great songs and dogs.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Let me spit a second, this man speaks to soul's. Messages to the world you ppl need to listen, not with your ears. Thank you Sir.
I hate country but fucking love this guys stuff lol
He’s not a flash in the pan
dude cant miss. damn what a hit
Chris!!! Brother!! That must have been one amazing weekend. “90s Chevy,” man, I don’t think there’s ever been anything….except maybe my 96 step side z71, that Ive resonated with…. So THANK YOU!!
So stinkin' cool.  I smiled through the whole thing.  The essence of it reminded me of my husband and my courtship.  It's beautiful poetry and I love it.  Have a great holiday weekend and thanks for the great music!
Bro keeps bringing absolute heat and doesn't even care. Love the music man keep it comin
Enjoyed listening to this your JRE episode 👍🏼
Another banger. Love it!
good tune
A case of beer and a Zebco. A great line
Simple music just as granddad and dad played on the front porch swing. Thank you for bringing back memories of those days. Haven’t listened to music in years .  ❤🙏❤
Absolutely love this song... Just Wow you have touched my family in so many ways thank you for your realness and authentication 🫶😍🙌
Just your voice and guitar is perfect. You don't need anything else to make music. May God richly bless you.
Real shit, for real people, in real shit. God bless you man.
Oliver needs to be the opening act for MNF because I am sick of the NFL.
Oliver, does itunes pay you well for selling your music ?
I live in a town of less than 200. Ain’t nothing near us for over an hour and that town is worse than a pile of fresh dog shxt.   But u know what. I am grateful to live in the country, most of the people are good…some bad apples..but for the most part we’re hard working people who need a break. We’re already poor, not many opportunities out here…inflation has been hard. I don’t have any kids but for the people who do..they live check to check.   People say “move!” That sure is hard when u live paycheck to paycheck .    I don’t want to move. I just want my dollar to have worth. I remember when my dollar was worth something, gas was cheap, building materials were affordable, food was cheap… not anymore.
Had a 94' Chevy Silverado Teal Green (The Green Machine). I drove that truck all over the country, riding badass mountain bike trails everywhere along the way. I commuted in her for 20 years. 420,000 miles on the original 350. I miss my girl.
He's a chevy guy? My man. Got myself an old beat up 88 camaro and a o3 silverado big boy
Love your music as a 61 year old i can relate to all your music God has blessed me with 31 years sober so keep strong in the lord he has answered your prayers
❤❤❤
Hell yeah Chris. Makes me miss my ol 90 somethin chevy with an old 350. Like a good woman, they're something special.
Love your music!!!! Very down to the soul good country music!!!
I've got a 91 chevy regular cab with a 350 😀
Good job. Love the update video. Sounds good. Video was awesome.   Keep doing you. God bless. ❤
Keep yourself little brother. You are blessed.
You have to be related to Toy Caldwell
You going to press an indie album yet?  Come on man 😊
Dude is writing the damn soundtrack to life. Look how many damn people love you dude. You are doing the thing. You’ve saved a lot of people man.
Is Country Soul a genre of music??? If not, it should be and you’re at the top young man!!
Brother is out here paving the way for brothers with two first names 😂💪🏼🍻
Yep ,another hit !!❤❤ APPLAUSE !!
It’s nice to be able to enjoy some new country music again.  Thanks.
Nice
God bless you sir🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Very nice 90 some chevy🤝
I can play what he plays but no one else can sing what he sings.
What a legend. His music is unreal
We want VCR Kid!
90 some acres...
Always said, I HATE country, but I Love this dude!
I got a ‘93 Chevy!
They said they could fight a guy, they didn't say they could beat him !
Thanks Chris! I had to send this to my husband and tell him how grateful I was to be his 90 Some Chevy! We celebrate 30 years this year and this song is so appropriate! You are awesome dude!
Was hoping for a better recording of this one, absolutely love this song!
Oliver is like a modern savior of the best kind of Real Music Made by a Real Person For Real People  I think there will be a new rennasaunce of the good traditional Music 😊🙏🙌🪕🎻🎺🎸🎶
Keep doing what you’re doing. Authentic is the key not making deals. Your music is what’s missing nowadays.
Chris. Keep praising Jesus and making music. You're on a mission. Stay true to the red, white and blue. God bless you
Applauses from France !
I love it! Happy Labor weekend everyone! Love, joy, peace, & prosperity to all! 😍🙏💕🎉
Our generations Chris Stapleton baby
A man and his guitar, that’s music. Simple.
Dude needs to get on a track with Stapleton with those chords!
🌐✌️💚🖖👽🤟😘
love your music man im a singer songwriter myself that went to nashville and beat the pavement ..it didnt work out for me but i'm stoked to see guys like me and guys like you make it!!!
This guy is pregnant with hits. Keep it up brother.
This guy🤯🤯
Higher than gas  Herb And the cost of gasoline
I hope it pops on Amazon.  I don't do iTunes or Spotify.  I'd rather buy it straight from you without the middle man, but I know how the new world works too.
Yup Criss is my Fav
Oliver! Keep up the Great music Mr.   🇺🇸 🗽 🇺🇸     God bless 🙏         The Vermonter
Who is this guy?         :)
You're a part of the social revolution I see happening, keep up the wonderful music! We need more people like you to give us a sense of togetherness and hope, many like myself have been mired down by the negative and divisive rhetoric that is pumped into us by the current media and government. I almost cried when you read the Bible on Joe Rogan!!!🙌❤🙌
Chill Billy love song...
Great song and a lot of talent
great tune . love the truck gun.
Is he still selling that truck?
🎶🎶🎶🎶💯💯😀💯
👍👍👍  Great thoughts set to music!  Easy on the ears and the eyes.  Thank for sharing.
Another tune that sticks to your ears IMO  You have a knack for catchy licks & great phrasing, a beautiful guitar, a voice to match, and the soul to give the credit for all your success to God. God Bless you, keep the devil away
I am sooooooo glad Chris is not a 1 hit wonder. I already know were gonna be listening to him make music for decades.
That good ol' country being played in Cambodia. Tell you what.
One of my new favourites , thank you for being you !! Keep up the great work
He just fell out of the blue
Northern California checking in with the good ole boys from Virginia.....Bless you son.
Such a catchy song. Great work on this one, bud.
REMEMBER 1 THING!!! YOU Still MAN ALWAYS BEEN! 🌎 JUST NOTICED YOU YESTERDAY! KEEP YOUR SOUL & KEEP BEER COLD 😂
Chris? Who is that
One humble man.🙏
That was just awesome friend, I loved it!
We need a live version of I need to get sober frrrr
Instructions unclear -- I told my wife she reminded me of a 90 Some Chevy... the results were sub-optimal  Lovely song!
Dam bro hitting home again
Johnny Cash would be proud.
Thanks for helping wake folks up, Chris!
MUCH LOVE
In a world of auto-tune and multiple writers that look for algorithms to make a hit, you have brought soul back to into music that I haven't heard in a long time.
Damn, this has to be one of the best country love songs EVER.
HE DONT MISS!!
Keep being strong brother, I can only imagine how much the devil is in your ear with temptation. Praying for you.   “No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭10‬:‭13‬ ‭
Hey Bro!!! That song is cool man
90 Some Chevy > Bugatti
You said chevy, and real musicians talk about fords. So i cant fuck with it.
I like the voice, I like the guitar playing, I like the lyrics, I love the passion, and I love the simplicity without all the glitz and glamour.
I have yet to listen to a song of yours I don't like, whether it be the original iPhone recording or the re-recordings of your old catalog; I actually liked the simplicity, imperfections, and rawness of the original recordings just as much as the new recordings done with a proper microphone. Thank you for your music. May God continue to bless and watch over you.
New favorite artist he's amazing
And again he delivers!
Don't like the song anyone can do the same thing you had everyone but now I don't feel the heart in this song should go back to writings gods music
This is the most relatable song I've heard for me. I'll probably never get rid of the ole 93' C1500 that's been in the family longer than even myself.
Awesome Song!!! Absolutely love it❤
And god said I’ll give them a voice that makes them feel again…
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SONG!!!❤❤❤
I used to listen to country music - years ago when it was country music - before it turned into bad rock and roll with a twang.   This. Is. Country. Music.
God Bless You, Chris. Stay strong, brother.
Anyone notice the truck is a GMC and not a Chevy?
This song would sound good with some drums and bass and banjos and mandolins
You have a psychic link to all of us everyday ordinary people you are a gift to us all sir thank you and keep telling stories
Brother I want a concert! I wanna pay front row seats with backstage pass!
This song fuckin rips
His music makes you feel like you know him and your at his house and he is singing to you and your family
He was definitely blessed with a deep resonant rich expressive voice; and he’s using it very well. Nice lyrics too. I really wish this guy well.
Too damn good
you give me hope!!!  cant thank you enough   .................please for the love of God keep putting out your songs!!! AMEN Brother
Greatest artist of several generations!
Love it Oliver!!!
One of the Chris's out there lol
Nothing like putting on some good tunes while I make my thumbnail for tomorrows video! Love it
Did obama really contact Chris?? 😮
Killer song son, keep em' coming.
This old Aussie thanks you sir!
Love it!! God bless you! 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Awesome 👍 Song young man 💥. Love it 🥰... Beautiful country you got there!
Nope, it just sounds like Pandering like all that other new Nashville crap.
Thank you for being exactly who God created you to be. The Bible says:  the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.  Chris, you're a GOOD MAN! May God continue to bless and keep you.
Son, You are a poet and we all know it!
Love this bro keep it up ❤
I have a 2006 Chevy so this song sounds somewhat dated to me.
Amen
Love the sound Oliver and the message is real.
I’m 31 years old. I literally daily drive a 66 Chevy. I’ve been all over America in the old man.
Better than anything Bob Dylan could ever dream of.     Oliver has saved music❤❤❤
He is awesome, I love his music
I don't even listen to Country and this dude is incredible
Cmon now.
Loving your music in Wales, UK 💚
Outstanding  !!!
wow!!!
Please Chris, don't go for a today Barbie !! You need a woman who want's to have a garden and make canning, on a small farm, her happiness ! ❤ you !! Thank You 🎉!
If you really want to know how he thinks ask him to say Trump 2024😂😂😂🎉
Oliver!!! This might be my favorite one yet from you. You just keep getting better and better while somehow still staying true to yourself. It's really beautiful man
Reacting now
I have a 95 FORD with a little over 400000 miles on it...  she gets me to work every day, hauls stuff for the farm, and takes my dogs for a ride.   This song just makes sense to me, even if its not about a FORD
What made you pick a resonator guitar, Oliver?
Boring. See ya
Another great song!!! Love it!! ❤❤❤❤
Man, your songwriting is incredible, and your singing is just as incredible! 😲
The best music comes from an independent musician just writing and singing what they want and not what some music industry wants you to sing. Stay independent 😏👍
I'm damn near speechless. Another great song Chris. 😊 You are following a very bright path, in my view of course. Ever since I found the Truth in Jesus's words, I can see it in others. Even feel it. Thank you so much for sharing through your music. God Bless You. 🙏🏻❤
415,000 views in the first 8 hours!!  I'd say that you definitely are speaking to the hearts and minds of all of us out here.  God bless you Chris
Nailed it. Again.  Thanks man. Keep telling it like it is.
Me n my work partner were on our lunch when you dropped it. Love the music keep doing you 🤝🏽
This is some more good stuff, Chris! Keep up the good work man. God bless
God bless you
Listen to his music is like the old days when some country was cool & good listening.
Thank you for giving everyone a glimmer of hope.
Isn't it crazy to think this man has been playing these songs in the woods for a while now and all a sudden the entire world knows him
As Julius would say divide and conquer.
Chris!! We needed you!!! Seriously, man ❤
I love my chevrolet 97 k1500
🍔 #RIP 🏝️ #JIMMYBUFFET🎤🎸
I like your message but, sorry I just can’t stand country music.  🤷‍♂️
You are a very talented, keep up the great music.
You can tell it’s good country music when folks like me from the other side of the world can enjoy it just the same as you all.
Awesome 👏 👏👏
Here before this goes viral as well.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🍺
Case o beer and a zebco is a perfect combo on any day.❤🎉
Tyler Childers fell off when he stopped making music like this
Follow this man damn, 10 million of you mfers
Just another great tune, thank you!!! As a drummer, just wish I could hear some percussion to go along with that soul music!!!
I've been fan of ur music after hearing the first 3 chords of RMNoR. Never stop writing music please...
Dude thanks. Keep your music pure and simple like this song please. A guitar in the woods with your voice and great lyrics is WAY better than what they pass for music now days. I’ll take real music like this over anything overproduced every single day. Stay true to yourself and God Bless.
The anti gun video before the video showing his in cab Glock setup was pure irony I guess. Great song tho.
Perfect! It’s almost like you’ve read a journal from my early 20s
He tugs at heart strings but ask yourself who's calling the tune.😂😂😂😂😂😂
America can remind you she's still alive! Just lesten!!
1:09 bro in a 2023 chevy with apple carplay now
This DUDE is better than any country artist that's on radio these days,he brought back country!!!...you the man dude!!!
Most of us have some memories in the back of a 90s chevy. Especially country folk
love everything you create thank you for the beautiful music!
Cool he has the same tent we do!
God Bless you Oliver Anthony ❤🙏🏻
Love it brother
You tube shuts everything down but not this I Nearly fell for it.
Would love to hear a collab in the future with you Jamey Johnson and Chris Stapleton
I just want to know if you heard the which men can be women parody 😂
My 97 Chevy 1/2 ton single cab long bed Z71 was one of my favorite trucks! Lots of memories in that truck. Love this song Oliver ❤
another great tune.  well done
"And I'm higher than Gas" - Based
Build up that little farm you got, brother, you deserve every cent
thank you
I'm proud of this man for sure... definitely has had a impact on the world...please do VCR KID next..man I know you saving it ..but damn that's gunna be a classic
Keep your head up and eyes down in that bible man, you are gifted Chris.  Watch out for the snakes in this world.  P.S. it would be awesome to jam with ya if your ever in Pittsburgh pa.
❤❤he sings how we feel, absolutely love this guys music!
Full of soul as always, those urban folks are not going to like that view of your sidearm, lol.
Tellin' ya Chris, you've changed country for me. Love this!
Great song
Put some more music out and come to Dallas. I'll buy a ticket! Good stuff man. Bringing me back to my roots 🙂
My husband has a 80 some Chevy. 😉
Man this is the 3rd time I’ve had to re-subscribe 🙄🤦‍♂️ means you’re doin something right 🤙💯 keep it up buddy, don’t lose yourself 🔥💯
Nice job Oliver! Keep up the great work! ✌️❤
I really like this song!
Love it! Sounds like the god ol days.  I know Oliver is proud! ❤
This music brings me back to another time in my life. I grew up in a family of musicians and spent my young days and teen years around bluegrassers. Folks sitting around playing blues, folk, and old country out in the woods is right up my alley. This is the music of my youth. I'm taken there everytime I hear this music. I sorely miss it. And I guess that makes me, to turn a phrase, an old soul living in a new world. Thank you for giving this back to us and reminding us of who we use to be when we were good and well.
Love this!  Thank you. ❤
Thank you Chris for your great music ❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤
One man and a guitar slicing through "Bro Country" like a hot knife through butter.
Damn man....thought you were a ford guy. Guess I'll look elsewhere for a genuine artist.  😅😅
You can sing but keep your core. Without it you're lost. I like you son love your music. I like that you won't be political. Let it RIP brother.
95 with a 350 with 405,000 miles. I can relate . If she compares to that, she's a good one!
Chris, you are the REALEST real deal 🙏🏻
A man blessed with a soul.  Sings from his heart not a contact.   Thank you Oliver Anthony 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I was dead until I Heard Oliver Anthony sing
You are me and my 8 year olds favorite artist atm. Was planning on going to your show in Missouri but they said it sold out 😢 my daughter actually cried.
Imagine what the message would be if it was a "90 some Dodge"
Oliver did what no one else has been able to do for decades! You brought us back to reality and made us see ourselves from the inside out as the same people, same struggles, and a new world that none us want or like.  Most importantly it's obvious you made these songs for everyone and to see and accept other for who we are both the good and bad that it's  not worth hurting each over for bunch daily talking points and material goods because they are just distractions from what we are supposed to do here on the earth for each other!!! Semper Fi
Love this hillbilly 😊🙏✌️♥️
👍
Got 2 90 some Chevy's. Can hear my honey coming from miles away 😊
This reminds me of being a kid and my dad playing Hank, WIllie, Cash, and Pride on his reel to reel.   I truly hope this will be released on LP so I can play it on that old stereo my Dad has.
Real as real can be
I Love 💓 This Song!! You Are 🤗 Awesome & I Pray 🙏 GOD 🙌 Will Highly Bless You In Everything You Do In JESUS CHRIST 🙌 Mighty Name Amen💖
With your songs, I keep going..."this one is my favorite" and then now, THIS one is my favorite.  Nothing like a 350 Chevy for certain!
Yesssssssssssssssssss this song is amazing
Absolute banger of a song. Love the words, love the sound, love you brother
God bless from Newcastle Australia 🇦🇺
Brilliant 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼  Keep them coming !
Dang so good 👍😊 really enjoy this song probably my third favorite of his so far 😁
Chris is a very Rare artist, I hope that receives a very nice return on his shared art shared freely.
Singing from the soul Sole acoustic guitar Nature as your background orchestra This is country
...just put em to sleep Oliver. I will all be ok when "they" replace ur folks with the 3rd world
Pure excellence, thank you!
💪😀👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm glad I don't know anything techincal about music Makes it seem a lot more magic
Wow!
It doesn't get any more basic than this.  One man singing and playing his guitar.  And it's like a breath of fresh air for all of us.
Ford people who love Oliver: gosh darnit
Keep posting new versions of your songs. You are a beautiful person Chris. ❤
You're gifted with incredible talent, a beautiful soul &  a voice that captivates. Never change your style. Your music is true "country" from days gone by and your heart is in it, which makes it even better. You play - we listen to every word.
I have a new favorite song
This, ladies and gentlemen, is the difference between pre-packaged saccharine corporate "talent," and homegrown organic music.  God bless and protect this man, as his songs will be sung 100 years from now.
These independent artists are making real music The kind of music that the music industry left behind a long time ago. Songs that resonate with the common people That's why I listened to nothing but independent artist and Oliver Anthony is now on my playlist
No filler or BS; just soul music.
I only listen to one country artist and it's this guy.
My cheeks hurt from smiling the whole song through 😊
Thanks for the music Oliver, if some elitists have their way we will only be able to sing about our electric car and how it caught fire, while the elite still have their 65 Corvette.
Loved it
When I first heard 'Rich Men' a day or so after it dropped, I came looking through your other music and this was one of my faves. As a bowtie man with a good woman this hits close, I used to have a '96 extended cab that we'd take to the woods and pop a tent for the weekend. Glad you went and redone it. 🍻
You got real talent no auto tune or nothing
This man is the future
The people’s favorite artist!!
You are amazing!  You have been a blessing to my family and most especially my children.  A voice of levelheadedness that they don’t see anymore
Chris, You all ready know how many people are  putting this in their Labor Day BBQ  list along with your other amazing songs.  There's gonna be your loud music and good old boys and girls getting down.  That crazy drunk uncle with a voice that won't quit til they haul him away. Congrats, my good man. I am reading  Proverbs  with an open mind. Thank you for going on Joe Rogan...and just still being you. God Bless you and everyone reading this.
a country music artist actually making country songs!!
Solid folk tunes
You have a beautiful voice.  May God bless you! 90 Some Chevy.  I like it.
I cannot get enough of this man.
This song reminds of what I  always say, “Enjoy the small things.”
This one was recorded the same weekend as Rich Men North of Richmond. Before everything blew up. Crazy to think how much has changed in just a few weeks. I cant thank y'all enough.
Amen Brother, thank you for being you. best wishes for you and help us all get together maybe. What you are doing is helping all of us. Thank sir.
Chris is nothing but Electrifying ! PERIOD .
He has to be AI.
Man I found this one on the cell phone videos a couple weeks ago and absolutely love it
💚💙 Much luv
Amazing!
This is true country music
Much love from San Antonio Texas❤
love it, its like a refreshed and more raw chris stapleton. sick!!!
Keep making the music the way you make it and I'll keep listening. Absolutely awesome !!
i miss my old chevy /gmc
God bless you.
Beautiful song, got me an 81 chevy c10 straight 6, I ride around listening to his music everyday and then drops this song love it
If my husband could sing or play he would write this song ❤  Thank you for sharing this with us
❤
Jesus Christ you blessed the world with this man he just keeps getting better
Man can write movie with his lyrics and voice
See us ginger do have souls
I think you are the biggest thing to hit the internet in a while , I love that fact !
thank you oliver, thank you for giving us hope !
Love it! Remember, ladies that every man needs to be run up to and be greeted with a hug and kiss then be allowed to unwind for bit. I also love that he said Carter and Cash❤ He reminds me of Johnny Cash❤❤❤ Stay soulful and keep your eyes on YHVH (God), my brother.
Women, cars, good ol' nature. Classic!
Great job Chris! 👌🏼 The Lord loves you and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
Oliver's ie Chris and his team and very fast learners when it to comes to making quality videos. Great job to all involved in making this an awesome video. Thank you!
You got yourself a great voice there Christopher (Oliver Anthony)!!!
Case a beer n a zebco… good times!!
This song proves that you got it brotha, you can write with the best of them.
Chevy Commercial Royalty Deal!!!!!!!😊😊😊😊
Like a fine wine...you get better & better.
It is as beautiful as a Clint Eastwood  movie..
One my fave song.
It's been a hard day, It's been a long week might have to load up the dogs and go listen to the frogs croaking down in the creek. That just hits me, working as sailor in the Netherlands and working really long and hard days. Oliver Anthony is the voice of the working man in every country
Very good song sir ! I think it will go over well with us country folk !  We all have that pickup right - just not a found on the road dead one lol. Nice talk with Rogan - keep on doing you , we will listen and nod the head and tap the foot.
Another good one buddy!
Half a Million Views in 8 hours!!!😅 just buy property and Retire. Im serious. I am 41 living in my car $0. No kids no wife no job.
❤ Reminds me of what America really is.  This man has empathy for his fellow man.
This right here is what the real American Dream really is about.. Not selling out to the Record labels, spreading positivity in an overwhelmingly toxic world.. It's also a fine example that people should stop selling out to themselves with a "contract" to work for other people. It's 2023, and there has never EVER been a better time to take your trades , talents , skills and do your own thing with the internet & endless resources to do so.. Enjoy what you do, make the living and have the life you want to live. It doesn't happen over night and you still have to work for it but you also don't have to be a billionaire to be happy! Most are not anyway!!
This is a good song.  I'm gonna be a fan the more I listen
Great song but Ford is a better truck
Oh man, after wading around in that creek I bet those old dogs stunk like hell when they climbed up into that 90 something Chevy.😅
badass song!
Anther good one👍
brother your killing this . has to be that voice inside speaking good and you making good choices. keep making good choices
this song is gross
hey man,you are  fresh breath of today s music,love your stuff,i have one question,if you have time to answer i was wondering who where your musical heroes that inspired you to do such a great job at the musical art form
Another absolute banger brother!!!! Yessir!!!
even New Yorkers are listening . Love his music
I'm a blue collar man , but i did a semester of art school. What i learned was to appriecate the view from the artist's eye. Oliver you paint great pictures!
Great song! Keep on keeping on my man! 👍
I really like this one!
Man, I just thought of The series Patriot and how much I really love this kind of music
Love it ❤🇮🇪
Love this
Fire  brother. Speak them facts.
I swear I can listen to this man all day, every day!! Keep on keeping on Sir!! GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS!!
First to actually sound and be country. Props for getting on Rogan. I was saying that he would get you. Had largest audience. That studio mic and outdoors makes the sound heavy in the right way!
The actual year matters TAYM, send me money in this recession. get in the streets people, over , Cash for Clunkers right when we couldn't afford it! At the same time my empty beer cans weren't worth recycling anymore, government controls everything if you're paying attention. Is anyone going to say what happened to their 401k after Biden was installed, me the typical poor man lost $33,000 in the first 3 months, if I had known I could have junked my faithful 1994 Toyota with 257,447 miles on it, and bought a new one with what I was cheated out of!
That was dope☝🏽
Amazing song OMG
Need a drummer? I got you.
Love the stories , keep it  comin !
He needs a fiddler, an upright bassist, and a steel guitarist STAT! Oliver you are a treasure, please continue to share your soul with us.
Great love song Chris! I LOVE this one! ❤❤❤
Hell ya!!!!!
Everything you write and perform is better than the one you're famous for.  The only thing I like about "that song" is that it introduced me to an American talent.  Thank You.
This man is truly being guided by The Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit. He asked for Gods help and is now sharing appreciation.
Pulsechain Gang ♥️ 🪐
How many can sing a song comparing his woman to a pick-up truck & make it sound romantic? @Oliver Anthony! & THAT TAKES TALENT! Love it!! ❤👏👏👏
Pistol in the passenger seat..classic America
You have a forever fan right here young man. I'm so very proud of you!
Great job mate 🤙🫡
So i like country now?
“If she’s my Carter, then I’m her Cash”.  I love that line
LOV,LOVE,LOVE!!!!
He reminds me a lot like John Denver, Take me Home Country Roads
Bra hard. I been bumpin cuzz na. Yea us black folks fux wit him to
Keep singing
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ohhhh shit this song danm sir ❤
JUICE!
🔥🔥🔥
Them Chevys and zebcos been there Man so cool Mississippi jmj with you
I’ve always disliked country music except for the country music that was playing when I was a young child in the 80s at my grandparents house. Looks like I’m back to liking country music. Thank you Chris
Love you man! The motivation from your music is endless for a ole country boy just trying to make it working in the log woods!
Please keep writing and singing. This is the only modern music that I enjoy. It’s simple and meaningful in a complex and lost world.
Country music been dead for years, I hope CMA will pay attention and get back to their roots, that's exactly what Oliver Anthony  is doing, songs that speak of our world and the hardships and also things that bring you back home.  God has blessed you my friend, stay true to the Word and keep reading and reflecting on God ways, that's exactly what I do and it keeps me free!
Roger that.
Wow. . . You hit it out of the park, AGAIN!! ❤
Randy Travis vibes
hello oliver antony i see and hear your music from france and i love it it really touches my soul i hope all is well with you and that you remain faithful to yourself and to god. Continue to spread this good vibe that you have been spreading, don’t market yourself. Big hug and stay with God
I am 50 years old and I grew up white trash in Colorado and this song for lack of better words hits home more than I could ever be smart enough to explain😊😊
This is exactly what we needed ive listened to your original phone recording prolly at the very least 20 times it was already perfect but this here made it so smooth i love it i love the song even more now thank you so much for everything your doing
❤🐶🐞Your lyrics stuck in my heart like a dog tick!  Can't shake 'em off!  They make me cry without knowing why & I'll never be the same! 😭😍   🖖Live Long & Prosper, Chris! 🌌
Ya Brother you got that right
I would like to see you and Creed Fisher in concert together. That would be the shiznick
I just wanna be back in high school hanging with friends drinking in the back of my pickup with him on the radio.
Thank you
So good to hear REAL music and talent!!!!!
Anthony Oliver is so damn proud of his grandboy,
THIS is the one for radio.  That's a #1 if I've ever heard one.
Get yer some cones and burn em down in the pines baby.  My life 😢😮
Man, I didn't realize just how much I had been missing good country music. I'm so glad Richmond north of Richmond blew up so I could discover you. By the way, I heard it on my Pandora today hope to hear this one on there soon!
Fuck yea brother. ❤
I'm a simple guy, I see Chris post something and I click on it. Easy as that and I'm never disappointed
I don't normally like country but this is REAL music.  Keep doing what you're doing and remember that for every minute spent on a negative person, a minute of opportunity passes to spend time with people that actually get it and enjoy your music.
There's a lot of music out here to listen to, but I haven't felt the music like this in a really long time.
S All I can say.... Stay silver! ❤🙏
Chris you sing for a lot of us, and it's nice to hear ! I'm driving my ol Bessie until the wheels fall off and she has no a/c or radio, but my girl takes me where I want to go. Thank you Chris for sharing your talent, Life and precious pets with us.🌷
ok this dudes just got it
fireeeeeee
Love it!!!
Outstanding!!!!!!!! Thank you!!!
You are a God-given poet.  Bless you!  Stay yourself!
killin it like i knew you was going to be
Love driving my '94 YJ Jeep Wrangler 💞🌹🙌
Country is back! God Bless America🎉❤❤
I'm 33 and have been listening to Hank Williams Jr., Tanya Tucker, Johnny Cash & June Carter etc. for all of my life. I've never been a fan of new country but I finally get that good ol' feeling from these songs. Thank you so much for sharing your talent from a humble place. 🌱🛻
I hate "Country Music", but I love this American Made Man Making Music that has meaning!
Your Music is a National Treasure.
Keep em comin!
Love my 96 Chevy , this song is perfect ❤
Boy, I can relate. Learned to "drive" with a 1970's Chevy.  And we are still together... 5 kids later.  Grab a case of beer and let the sun go down real low. Boy, there were a few summers spent like that. Those days seem to be gone.  Did I mention the 5 kids. Lol This song brings up so many memories of my bride and 32 years later and a life of ups and downs. Mostly up, but some low points. But still the same gal and a lifetime of memories.  Thank you for sharing your song
I drive a 90 some chevy 👍
❤❤❤❤❤❤
For all country musicians remember this guy plays real country no special effect with fake instrumens learn something frm him than call your self vountry singer you know who your are
Its one of those songs that make ya want to go dance barefoot in a farmer's field
Hope you got her a ring... Thank you for what you have done to ignite the spark in all of us old souls in this new world (that is headed off the cliff...) Maybe we can still turn things around... Thank you, and don't let this crazy success s*** destroy your spirit!
I still have my 94 CK1500, all stock 350. She is a part of our family.
Chris, you are A POET !!!  Each song is better than the last!  Thank You for sharing your God Given Gift!
Keep going strong Chris aka "Oliver Anthony "... we're behind you all the way!!
This guy has definitely become the new Johnny Cash the only thing he's missing is a black suit.
Nature is the best background to pair with genuine love for music
We love you so much, Christopher!  Best tunes, ever!  I'm just an old hippie chick lovin it!
I discovered you a week before the world went into a frenzy. Just seeing what you’re about as a mother of two boys, one 28 and one 23 I wanted them to see where you are now and to listen to your journey and to appreciate your talent. your honesty, your heart Both my boys saw it I thank you I thank you xxx
This is real country music no electric instruments this man is the real thing
👍
Apparently, he likes not only 90 something chevys but he likes 1911A1 pistols, too----probably in .45 ACP caliber if I had to guess.
Singing about Chevy an all good things. Another great one Chris
I like your work. Good on  you. Thanks.
❤
Sounds very Jamey Johnson on this one.  Good stuff, OA!!
NOBODY should try to touch this man's voice. He's had no vocal lessons and still he sounds like life itself. Please don't change, don't try to be more technical or anything. Just keep being yourself ❤
Another awesome video sir
Who hasn't tried to improve a 350 to perform more like they want...and found that overhauling and giving a few new shiny things & rings does it right.
So good!!!
Love it!
Respect from Australia 😎
Ford drivers crying because they can't blast this in their f150 🤣
Love it man!!
Richmans gold next please.
Just coming home from a 12 hour shift of collecting milk from farm to farm and trucking the 40 t to the dairy factory. Your song speaks to me - just there is no 90 some chevy waiting for me at home right now. Thus in the end I am a bit torn between songs, as I am kind of feeling that I sold my soul and I am pouring a drink right now.  Keep going brother - hearing your tunes, your voice and your lyrics is balming up that ripped soul. 🤠
Love it!!!😇
Isn't that a GMC?
He tells the truth.  It's 2023 and someone is telling the truth.
This is country music and its great!
do a song on Kary Mullis
Love those canvas tents👍
'99 obs k2500 suburban here
Damn, so much heart and soul
My dude only writes good uns
Love your music
Such a tender song that settles the soul.  Great Job!  Keep them coming Brother!
Perhaps my favorite of his songs so far.  The man’s got a “deep bench” of tunes.  Can’t wait to see the haters lecturing him about his use of “white trash” and acting scary with his gun.  But that phrasing and tempo change in the part of the song talking about the dog, frogs, and creek is an amazing piece of song writing and performance.
More please thank you so much❤
Sadly my 90 some Chevy doesn’t have a 350 in it. I upgraded to a 5.3 lol
can you research my case, I'm facing 25 to life for defending myself against a mad man with a gun. I lost everything even after the judge said he didn't see intent for me to harm anyone. Injustice in Portland Or. I need exposure help
💪💪💪
Please share the Love of the Son of God. Please write His Words in your Heart, and share them. Please Forgive, and Pray for everyone. Immanuel, God with us...
It must be hard being a hillbilly 😢
I love this song and I love the 1911 the future has a little hope yet
So not much country music in my country and I have never listened to any but this is beautiful and speaks wonderful truths ❤ love it ❤
Oliver I have your songs on my playlist now. Thanks for adding another. Your songs have impact. Every time I am listening and your songs come up they stop me in my tracks. God Bless
Ahhhhhh the sweet sound of The Red Bearded Angel what a great way to start the day!
To all men !!! This isn’t time to sing or have a popular channel or show gun collection, this is time to act. Martyr sounds better than influencer.
Wow dude every song. Every single one is good. I don't know I guess I'm just used to the one hit wrapped in shit formula. Hats off to you bro.
I just wish he would cut them strings dangling 😂
I'm a proud owner of a black '99 Silverado Z71.  She's not much to look at, shedding clear-coat, missing a fender flare, got a bit of rust just about everywhere, and doesn't have working A/C anymore, but she's still purring and going strong.  My aesthetic fix is Old Glory flying proud from the trailer hitch flagpole.  I've fixed a lot of things to keep this truck going, transmission, fuel lines, trans cooler lines, the entire fucking front suspension, just to name a few, and I hope to keep her running for at least another 100K miles.
You're amazing. Keep it up and keep em coming!!!
this one hits hard... you're a gem, don't stop doing what you're doing
This is the first song of Chris’s that may even sound better with drums dropping at the chorus. Everything else he’s released sounds perfect in its rawest form. Only my opinion.
Its the gun for me. 😅 But it might get you cancelled lol.
Rite on get some your rocking culture thank you
You’ve made it all the way out to remote Queensland Australia! Keep it up brother
End of the day work song. ❤
Bless you!
Great song, man. I dig it. Been enjoying the music you have been putting out.
Ford guys punchin the air rn
Please never change! Your music always hits my soul just right. Its a beautful thing, thank you!
Country music has needed a man like you for a long time
What a great voice. From the heart. This man is so wonderful.
Me and Mtn Grandpa love love LOVE your music friend!!! You nailed it again with this one!!! 😊❤
His music makes me think I'm listening to "O brother where art thou" lol . . . Love that movie and love his music!
I love how the mainstream is up in arms over that quick shot of his handgun, open carry stops a-lot of violence just look what Kyle Rittenhouse did for his community.
Thank you Sir.
I've got a 90 some Chevy, and my wife ain't bad either
I really wish this man all the very best, and I hope he is playing for us for years to come
I’m from Scotland this man is an artist fantastic lyrics and music our generation BOB DYLAN
Loving your music. It has soul brother.
Beautiful.
I have a 1990 C1500 single cab, short bed with 256,000 miles on the old 350.  This song resonates.
WOW just WOW...
hotDAmn! didnt think you could come out with an even better version. thanks again for the good music. Appreciate ya
Thank you.
At this pace he's going to claim the top 5 spots on the charts all by himself .. God sent a message through Julie Green that he WILL change the entertainment industry .. I believe he is showing us the start of how he will do just that !
That's a good one!
What music from down here once was (and is again). Amen.
#RockOn Chris...
Chills never stop when I settle into the reality that I'm not alone. Now, I'm heading to a date with Mr Smallie-Mouth in a spring fed crick...later ya'll
🍻💪🍻
Another great song!
Another great song
I’ve never liked country music or anything like it. Chris is now my favorite artist in any and all genres.
Can I be your nabor. Is the property bye you available I promise to be quit until the end of every song and I’ll dance my feet off 😊
Now I'm waiting for him to do a video on "Love ya like an old dog" ❤❤❤. Love all his music this man is a blessing
May the good Lord be with him love his songs ❤😊
Love your work, stay true to the Lord Jesus Christ.
Beautiful.
Finally! Soul music full of heart. Love this song!!!!
Finally country music that dont sounds all the same. I found todays country music makes more noise then any.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💜💜💜💜💜💜
Doesn't get any better!! Keep it going hoss!!!
The LORD Jesus is great, praise the holy spirit's works within you, he's blessed you.
Love it buddy keep them coming
Sir, are you a mask wearing scardie cat?
My kids are 2 and 4. We live in Belgium.  Lately they want daddy to sing “wanna know what u do”.  Man u touched a lot of mankind.
your music is great dude
Feel the same about my 1986 GMC 3500 4x4 . First  truck  I ever bought bran new in my life . Just restored it , they definitely don't make them like they used to.  Love your sincerity and matter of fact real shit . 👍👏💪
@oliveranthonymusic  I saw a video of you singing this song in a bar with your guy accompanying you, & while I love this version, I really loved hearing the two of you play together. That version was super sweet with just a li'l more fun & depth... maybe think of adding the 2nd version sometime in the future to show off that fun side of you too, bc we'd like & enjoy seeing a bit that side you too 😉  Thanks for sharing yourself with the World while spreading GOD'S Word to people who may have never seen/heard b4; you're truly shining your light bright & uplifting many while you do ❤️  You give us something to believe in, in a rather bleak time; GOD Bless you & yours as you travel this perilous new road!
That's a really fun song, Chris.  Gimme more!!!
Good Ole Fashioned Country Love Song! TOP TIER
Just my brotha cut from the same cloth pickin another un
The new pop country can’t relate and is stuck in its own conundrum of dumb shit, over and over, just to relate to people that can’t think for themselves. Your music is a breath of fresh air.
Love that he brings his three dogs to his concerts.
This is awesome! This man must be protected at all costs!
Yah dog gone done did it again son! 👍👍
If you dissapeared tommorow Ill still be listening to your songs until I can't hear anymore. I don't listen to country at all but your music is food for the soul man. I grew up dirt poor in rural georgia till I was old enough to leave on my own. your music is the soudtrack to life for so many people like us.
How have you not been on my radio (Of my '99 Chevy) for the last 10+ years?!
Keep it up man you’re putting out some really genuine art right now. I’m here for it ✊🏼
💯
Great❤
beard trimed, sound crisp. You are up there. Cheers from Switzerland
This song should go super viral
I’m a lifelong liberal progressive who’s hated what happened to country music in the last 30 some years. Thanks Oliver, for you and what you write and sing, I’m back.  You’ll always be your own man.
My dude.....❤ I feel you.🫡
Great music and writing. You're like a country Dylan without a mouthful of marbles.
Really like this one. Next big time singer right here. Hope I see this guy some day!
Neighbors bitch about the loud 350 in my 93 Chevy 4x4
many weeks trying to figure out the model of that microphone ! captures the voice perfectly, and the guitar is neat
Oliver Anthomy is the Hank Williams of our time today.
God gave this man a gift.
tis is truly amazing come check our reaction to this brilliant song from Oliver Anthony   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMQcNFUPeCM
Don't change dear. Don't listen to them. You don't need nothing but you and that guitar sweetheart. God will give you what to say.
This mans music seems to connect with the ordinary man and woman around the world, Hello from Ireland and thank you.
They said you were a one hit wonder no my friend here to stay independent without the right mens soul destroying money and ways. Love
You could sing the phone book with that voice and I would listen to it. Much Love from Ireland 🇮🇪
Thanks for the 3 minutes of normalcy there today Christopher, it's greatly appreciated!
damn man this one hit way to close to home... beautiful song!
When this guy hit the big time, I was worried he couldn't sustain it.  I thought the world would demand a second song and he might unfairly flop before he peaked.  I'm so glad to see he isn't just a one hit wonder.  I hope he continues to publish a body of music like this.
LOVE this ❤️
You'll  definitely  reach a million subs. Love you, brother ❤
Goddam this is good🤟🇺🇸
The real deal.
Even as a Ford man, I endorse this message.
There’s only a few artists who can pull of solo material this solid.  Some will say Tom Waits, maybe William Elliott Whitmore, or Tim Barry.  I’d place Oliver Anthony Music damn near the top.
You are killin it. Voice of a generation. Thank you for brightening my day.
That's quite the chevy ad. I hope you supe her up, rather than selling
This guy has a true gift. I'm not a big country fan but love your stuff man. Keep doing you - your talent is incredible.
This man is amazing.
This man is one of the most genuine men on the planet
Oh my word. What a wonderful song...thank you Oliver
Fantastic as usual. Wondering if we can get a video for vcr kid? That one tears me up every time. Makes me think of my son and how much worse its going to be for him than anything we have had to go through. Thank you so much for doing what you do. God Bless!
I can relate to this! I have a 90's something Chevy!
A case of beer and a....?
Each song this guy records just keeps proving that a few people with their hearts and minds in the right place can create something more beautiful and meaningful than a large studio with ever flowing money.
Thank you!
Wow.
Change the line to - when you turn her HOME instead of turn her in and you’ve got magic again.
But that's a gmc lol
Enjoy this moment...hes as real as he will ever be.the wheels are in motion..be strong chris
Getting Waylon vibes on this one. ❤️
You got it right. Lyrics that speak from the heart again. Love the rich sound of the Dobro with your voice. And always outside. Please please don't let anyone talk you into anything else. It is a joy to hear the real deal! Praying God protects you and renews you daily!
ANOTHER  WINNER 😊😊
Funny. It won't let me thumbs up. 🤷‍♂️
I’m not even a country fan, but this guy is amazing 😊
Just what I needed
Love that line line about Carter and Cash! Priceless!!
Not much on country but this young man is really good and i really like listening to him. Hes one of the best ive heard in years.
Imagine warming up this many souls and then saying ''im no-one special'' THAT'S WHY YOU ARE SPECIAL TO US
Looks like someone got a new truck lol
And he drives them ol' chevy's....
This man can sing
Country music has hit a renaissance and this man right here is Leonardo DaVinci
I can't believe how much this calls to my soul.   I always hated country music.  But this guy.  Something about it.   Hits me right in my soul.
this is the real america
Stay true to yourself Oliver! God bless!
love this dude. all killer no filler
Know much about them old 90 some chevys. Good song.
Suck on that Music Industry.....   LOVE IT !!!
nice
Love
Love you, brother
ARTIST!!!
I prefer a guy like this over a mainstream musician.  Stay small bro
Thanks Chris. Stay true to yourself!
i'd love to see this guy in a madison square garden size audience.  song writing skills are so good and i hate country music normally
Makes  me miss my 90 Camaro with T-Tops
This is my kind of country. Old school sound with real lyrics that makes me smile
My 91 Sierra is the only thing that has NEVER let me down. All original with 312,000 on it ,was a city department truck well maintained and I bought it with 200k 13 yrs ago .. my only issue is the transfer case I have replaced it 2 times but I'm a logger and I work it hard for a 2500 4 bolt main 5 inch lift on 33's
Boom! Another great  song from this guy. Please get that money though bud. ❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
You are a blessing to all who listen.   Thank you for your message and testimony.❤
Good Blues with a different accent
From this day until your last, Jesus Christ is the absolute most important figure in your life, whether you believe it or not.The books write about Him and history bears witness to His acts. You cannot escape Him. The most popular book in the world is all about Him and more importantly is that His word is etched into your heart. Your being bears witness that we have a Creator, something cannot come from nothing, that has never been true. Trust in Him while you still have time. Unlike God, your worldly existence is finite. There is salvation in NO other name and the gift is free, it has been paid for. I love you and want the best for you. He has the ability forgive your sins and deep down, you know you're imperfect and a sinner, we all are. Trust in the Lord.
Love it.  Keep it up man!
Ok, YouTube guitarists, get to work on those tutorial videos.
Price of my 93 Chevy just went up 🍻
This kids voice is incredible, a true Outlaw, to carry the torch for Waylon and willie, or Cash....hes right up there in my eyes...a pure heart felt natural
Might be my favorite so far
This guy makes me like country music.
Keepin it real Oliver, keepin it real. 👏👏👏
Sing it Chris!!!! 🔥🇺🇸
he has had money and tons of land for a while. over 90 acres
Hey Oliver
It's the little things in life. Some call them the simple things.
Where has country music like this been all my life? 🎻🎤🎵🎶👍❤
Changed the words a little, 😊
Now thats a $100,000,000 man! Keep kicking ASS Oliver. God Bless
You can hear the crickets in the background
Love it. Banger sir! Well done
Excellent ✌️✝️
Great song! Did he say a case of beer and a semicolon ; ?
Like You Oliver,  I am just a branch on the "TREE OF LOVE", I am not the tree and that is what inspired this song, GOD BLESS YOU OLIVER, LOVE YOU BROTHER! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzK_3M1Sues
My dollar has more value when it’s used for your music
I don’t listen to country. But Chris has made a huge impact and you can feel the soul in every song. This is music!
I’m glad “Rich Men” blew up the way it did, otherwise I never would have had the opportunity to experience your music. Another amazing song, thank you for sharing your gift with all of us! God bless you and yours.
That's a frickin SWEET tent, People who are hating just can't handle TRUTH
Hey can you do one of those videos where people can send in their sung lyrics to rich men?
Another 1 Bad Ass 🎶🎶🎶🎶
Love the line "that darling mine like a 90 some Chevy rides just right when you turn her on" no truer words ever spoken sir!😉👊 great song,keep on keeping on brother!
WE STILL LOVE GAS TRUCKS ON THE FARMS.
Thankful for you!  Your voice is what we need more of and less of the sellouts on the radio. Keep writing and changing the world, brother!
After work this song hits different
Guess some people have to work
I live right down the road where your Grand pa Used to live, Raccoon Valley
Constant hits🔥
Love you man!  From Massachusetts, USA! ❤️🙏✌🏻
What a raw talent.....
Bro is proving he’s not just a one hit wonder, that’s for sure ❤ artist at heart
❤😊
This is pure, there’s a real peace about this song. Also, I’ve never been a country guy until finding you Chris. Our creator has given you a beautiful gift
Some people don’t understand ,run a few over 300 .
Real!
Aussies down under luv ya Chris... and we get to see some beautiful US country (we call 'out in the bush')
Team up with Larry Fleet man
Old soul. He's not a one off.
Nailed it. Great song
Another great song
Let America Go !  Men North 💫
Great song after great song. There's an incredible career waiting if you want it. Very talented
❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢 new subscriber
Im sittin' here and thinking,  damn.   That boy is one of us.  Country AF and not a poser.   Like DAC said,   "If that aint country,  I'll kiss your ass."
This is front porch, beer drinking, Southern life music.
Chris, I love all of your music! Reminds me of the good country my father listened to and the stories of our family's past and the struggles. You've brought back a piece of me thats been missing for almost 20 years. Thank you! 🇺🇸
His music sounds to similar. So once i heard the first i heard the rest.  You bandwagoneers wouldn't even know GEMSONVHS OR OTHER AUTHENTIC FOLK-BLUEGRASS CHANNELS.
All this guy does is CRY LOL!! CRY HARDER, Biden will win FOUR MORE YEARS!!!!
VOTE BLUE PEOPLE!!!
You took me back through my whole life.  Thank you Chris. God bless Men like me need men like you to remember we’re here for a reason.
How can we buy an album from this man? That is not digital and I can hold my hand and keep from these tyrants. Stealing in a way for me.
You make me appreciate how much I do... for once I feel good about the fact I work and don't claim welfare. Thank you 😊 ❤
You gotta go "Camping with Steve" !!!! That would be an epic collab !
This one has been on loop in my car since I first heard it a couple weeks ago. You’ve gotta do another about a Ford where they fall in love waiting for the tow truck on the side of the road. 😂
O’ Brother where art thou? Here….thou art here.
When our Creator programs the voice of his first born of Creation from the mind of a man using his visible body named Chris, it's an awesome sound of meaningful words mixing with the sounds of those vibrating strings his fingers are plucking and strumming. Chris said that he let go of his ego and let God take control but actually God has always been in control of Chris, his voice and body. It just takes some time for God to prepare his invisible Servant to be a vessel in this world of Satan and the Beast to show what HE can do. Chris and our Creator are ONE now so listen to our Creator's programming and enjoy whatever HE programmed Chris to sing and play.
"shes my Carter and I'm her Cash" thats gold brother :)
Nice job man
The only 2 country songs I have enjoyed hearing are this 1 and Rich Men North of Richmond. As the kids like to say these days, Oliver Anthony is him!
CMT keeps putting out this new liberal garbage, and Chris singlehandedly will make them go bankrupt. I'll only listen to his music only the rest of my life. I'm ok with that.
Keepin it real love i .. Country has another Fan from Down Under ...Not your typical fan , but the songs the lyrics resonate ..
The soggy bottom boys (o brother where for art thou)
Chris, God is using you and it is absolutely amazing to watch.    "The night is far spent, the day is at hand.  Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light."  Romans 13:12
Just plain awesome!
“Case of beer and what”??????🤷🏿‍♂️
Beard is getting more red everytime I see it. Rock on brother , we're all here for it
This dude don't miss.
How in the world does this man make music that reaches the soul of any person alive and speak to us all? My favorite artist of the last 2 decades, utter perfection!
Nice.  Just close your eyes and let this song wash over you like a cool breeze on a warm day.
You shouldn't rush your title publication like that.
I wonder if he going to put out a CD people can buy
It’s a hit
Ain’t much on country music but every song I’ve heard makes me tear up
When he wants to, this man’s choruses come around harder than a peach vodka hangover
Normally not my kind of music, but I could listen to Oliver Anthony all day long.
Oliver Anthony makes music that heals the soul. His lyrics are as deep as it gets. I’m so glad a normal guy out in the sticks is making history. Land, Dogs and music ❤️
Total American man. Traded the delusion of alcohol for the christian ideology delusion . Otherwise a very talented man who currently has the ear of all nostalgic people.
He's keeping it real true country
👏🏼
I might start reading the bible again.
I thought his name was oliver?
He'll yeah. Thank you friend. Good job.
Makes my blood pressure drop 10 points appreciate you my friend
Great video Chris! 👍🏼
Best music to come from this part of the country since the movie Songcatcher !!
A case of beer and a Zebco 🔥 🔥
Another great song! Thank you for putting out more music. Keep shining!!!
Going back to the best way of life, Country is where my heart is,  in those woods, a slower time of life.
Lol everyone has found his page sweet
Fire 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😱
Too bad my ex is like a 90 some Ford. Completely unreliable
I may live in a city, but this is my kinda people. Thanks for singing it out, my brother!  We're all listening, 0livar😊
Wow!!! Knocking it out the park!!! America HEARS you loud and clear! Stay humble my friend 👊
I love it, your songs have a lot of “air” and comes off very smooth
I didn't know I was a county music fan until Oliver Anthony.
🧡   🤜🤛
real down to earth music . p town trading post has wire cutters/side cutters on sale .lolololol
Me and my 90 sumthin chevy can relate to this great music
Whoa! I love it ❤
He’s gone and done it again. Instant hit! Beautiful melody, heavenly voice.
Not even a million subs? Please YouTube is suppressing him for sure
I'll listen to this over the crap that passes for country today
Nashville? What's that?
Next song will be bumpside ford lol
He rhymed “cash” with “cash.” I guess they can’t all be winners. Lol
My favorite!!   I gotta a ole 94 Chevy with 405,000 miles.  Just need a darlin’ to go with it!!!😂❤🍺✌🏿🎵
Love it bro ty
Sweet
This is some good soul music
Brilliant
Who else hits the "like" button before the song even starts playing?
🤯💯🔥
Dudes not playin straight up Dimond in the dirt found
This one's my favorite, I'm sure I'll say that about the next one he releases, but for now this one is it.
Havent felt this kind of country since my childhood in the mid 90s. I can almost hear my mawmaws voice yelling for me to shutup so pawpaw can watch the news 😂
An old Chevy truck, crickets and frogs and a creek and someone waiting to kiss you when you get home. I am in.
I like it!  BROVO
love the fully cocked 1911 45
i agree tho love the chebbies
Fantastic! 🎼
❤
Your music touches us. Please keep pushing. And don't let the pressure change you! God Bless
They don't understand you but I do I read and listen to the word and try to apply the best I can we can't be bought because we're already sold to Him keep singing love it your the only secular I listen to is u because I know were your coming from sand mountain Alabama
love this guy but he keeps singing the same patterns kinda makes it sound like one run on song hope he changes it up a little bit
✨GREAT🪕JOB✨
Stay true to yourself, and your music.  You touch the soul of everyone, with every song you release.  You may not have 8 million. Dollars in fortune. But you have the fame of 800 million tortured souls.
You keep doing you bud,much love
Well if I ever get my hands on a 90 something Chevy I know what I’m blasting 😂
Vibez
JESUS IS GOD
You're pretty legit sir. Keep on keeping on.
Outlaw music... Raw, from the heart and soul , just a voice and guitar.
Great song. He needs a new chord progession though. I think he atleast added a C into this progression. Either way his music is more about the vox and lyrics anyways 👍
Sing it brother!…❤️🙏❤️
This is better than any song Ryan Upchurch has ever made....
Now thats what I call music.. lost hope of hearing contemporary good music again, you know, the kind that acually means something and trying to make a difference.. hope it will awake other good old school artist to wake up from the democratic party dogma
This might be my favorite so far
Oliver, Thank You for bringing real country music back to life my friend. God Bless brother 🙏 Jay🕊🕊🕊
I hope Gretsch is sponsoring you now. You are a great representative for their guitars.
Chris I'm glad you choose to sing and play music we need your music now more then ever
Vote Biden
Not sure if it’s the mic or what but it’s much easier to hear the lyrics in this song
Our country is so divided that even  if someone has a message of unity people will fight and get more divided and then try to cancel the person trying to unite everyone for not being on "their side" because of course you can either be a republican or Democrat noone can just be A political. This world is just crazy
Keep spittin them out. This was great.
Awww yeah!
WOW ❤️🇺🇸✌️
Love this song buddy!
If you truly want to be a help to this nation I'd suggest to not mix the Lord's name with cases of beer and riding "her"
Damn, appreciate the quality upgrade ❤ sounds and looks so much better 👌
Taylor Swift is better
Very solid, well done Oliver.
Beautiful keep up the good work Chris we love it.
This is real country for all who haven't figured it out yet ?
Thank you, Chris! 😃😎
💯 🔥 👍
Love how your videos are filmed outside. In the woods. Makes the song feel more real down to earth.
Keep striking while the Iron's hot! Chris putting up some numbers. I'm happy for him it's nice seeing someone turn into a star
Nailed this one!
VA stand up!
Love the song and video
100% Thank you!!
Zebco fishing reel 🙂
This man is epic!!!! Great soulful sounds with simplicity and vigor!!!! God has blessed us all with this fella! The Lord is on his way!!!! Praise Lord Jesus Christ!!!! We gon’ be alright!!!!
that's one beautiful, soul-filled song.
I just realized that I had been "Un-Subcribed"...When I know for a fact that I had subscribed weeks ago..... Pay attention folks !!!!!!
❤❤
Another great one Chris! I don’t miss real country music as much since hearing your music.
I agree with so many others who admire your talent, but I don't care for these lyrics. They're too much like other lyrics today that disrespect women. That's unfortunate.
Love how Chris' music videos gets more cutaways haha. Keep the good music flowing!
Thank God for Oliver Anthony.
Qu'elle sonne bien !
Real music for real people 🔥🔥🔥💯🎶🎶
Personal opinion, you have saved country music from the pit of despair that is “pop country “
The Dog Poet
Keep em coming man, you are the current day preacher.    ...peace...
Thank you for your God-given talent. Thank you for making me love country music again. True country music...the heart of America.❤🤍💙
Love this pure music.  Authentic. ❤
Beautiful and very relaxing.
You guys need to check his net worth…he’s pandering
250k views in 5 hours
Damn dude! I love the way you write and sing!
Yeah- that’ll do it. He’s gonna be top of the country
Enjoying this from Zimbabwe!
To all of those that thought this dude was gonna be a one hit wonder. WRONG!! Every song he puts out is just a laugh in the face of the so called country you hear on the radio. I quit listening to so called country music years ago. Thank you Oliver (Chris) for writing and singing songs that nobody in Nashville gives a shit about anymore. You have millions of fans that actually are glad you’re not on all the local radio stations. Nashville would ruin you in a minute!!
Love it!!!
Chris I love that I could sing this whole song without you even putting it out yet. This is one of my favorites just for what you mention and the words you use.
👍🏾
great song love it your fan
That's awsome Chris! Keep up the great work. Love from Germany!
Love this song ❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great job. Sangin from your soul boy. 😊❤️🙏
Sing it Oliver!!!! ❤❤ mad respect
I’d love to see him cover Saint Jhn ‘s 84 Bentley for fun
Great job!!  Show em it can be done from Gods woods!  Great music!  Love it!
Just rocked this in a 90 sumtin Chevy 😂 Oliver strikes again🥃😎
Great song, Chris!  Genuine and authentic, quite the opposite of the trash “country” we’ve been fed for the past few years.  By the way, you forgot the verse about getting stuck and a Ram or a Ford pulling you out!
In Oliver Anthony we Trust!
Hell yeah brother
Another great one.
Great music.
Your podcast with Joe Rogan was great man. You say you're not a huge talker, but I think you articulated your character just the way you should have. People love you because you're a man's man, and they are few and far between these days. Keep up the good work, and share your soul with all those who need it. Love ya brother.
This is peak male performance   deal with it libs
I like this cleaner version, but i'll always listen to the iphone setup as well.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Man that "case of beer and a Zebco" line reminds me of fishing with my Grandpa when i was a kid. This is music for everyone, keep going man. We appreciate all you do
Thank you so much, Chris 🙏 Keep staying true, to you. Don’t listen to those “parasites” …. they don’t have jurisdiction in your Body, heart, mind, soul, and Spirit. You are free, they are miserable. You have, what they could never have. Peace of mind. Much love, and God bless you brother. We are cheering you on, and we all have your back. 🇺🇸
Grats on your success!  Stay vigilant👍 there are wolves everywhere.
This man is bring a lot of people back to their roots God
Love it!!
This man and his music, is a gift to us all.
Great song. I inherited my fathers 1999 2-door Tahoe. Love that truck. I wont LS swap it either. Im happy with the gas guzzling stock 250hp L31 Vortec on the 4L60 for now.
God bless ya brother!
Nice ❤
Même en France artiste fait un carton
This is another great song. So many people in the comments confuse me, if you don't like this then just move on. Creeps.
Damn Bro where you been all this time?
Your grandfather would be so proud of you Christopher.  You bring happiness to so many people across the world with your music.  😊😊😊
How much did that guitar cost, it's super badass
My first truck was 98 Chevy with a 350. Miss that truck.
Bro you have officially made country great again 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Beautiful ❤️🇨🇦
Been a lot of years since I’ve enjoyed country music. A lot of years being cheated by mediocrity in the music business. No autotune, no glitz, no glamour, a man, a guitar and actual talent that doesn’t need to be sold or marketed as something it is not….
90 some Chevy and a 1911!!! My kinda guy!!!
Like a rock. -ford guy
whoever is directing these...if you need some help to improve your video quality please let me know. A lot that could be improved here. would be happy to help.
Goes to show ya, the dude isnt a fluke.
nice!
Your words and voice are very soothing. 🎉❤🎉👏🎊👏🏆🏆🙏
Fantastic. 🙏🙏🙏 to you brother!
Chris…….I’m glad you are posting your music to your own YouTube channel now. Hopefully you have realized how much revenue you lost on your top song.  Hopefully YouTube will offer you a Partnership soon then you can monetize your videos and make some cash .
Stay on the path with Jesus my brother. Love to hear some more of that voice praising God. ✝️✝️✝️✝️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
About time to hear Great stuff, thanks O A.
It’s nice already knowing all the words when a good recording comes out you can blast in your 90 some Chevy!!! Brother that’s a hot mic and your vocals are great!!!
Not one bad song from this man. Keep this up, and we’ll keep listening.
We love you!!!  ❤❤❤❤❤
Love the songs and message, but after downloading in iMusic, the quality is awful compared to this video audio which is wonderful and sweet. I hope the better audio gets uploaded…
Dont ya got a buddy with a drum set? Just asking for a friend! Admiring the guitar skills! Looks easy, non guitarists have no idea of the countless hours it takes.
I'm with u I left the city know stress 😊
Who else’s gana be be knocking  boots to this song later
hope you dont sell ur soul
Got it made brotha…my dream is to simply live off grid as possible,help people when paths cross for such,and stay as close to GOD out in the woods as much as possible!
Good job Chris
Oliver (Chris), thank you for being you, for inspiring the world, and for remaining true to yourself. You don't need the music industry. They need you. But they can't have you,a nd it's driving them crazy. Good on ya.
I mean all of your music is epic, but this is my fav so far! 🤠♥️🫶🏽
Great song and video!  I love the woods
Best yet. :) cuz it has been a long week...
Praise God for you sharing .
Hey now! That's no 90 some chevy ur driving sir lol. Nice song. I'm here for it. Keep it up bud.
"I'm higher than gas" now that's poetry 😂😂
The beauty in simplicity. Music doesnt have to be complicated to be loved. Oliver brings simple good country life to us. Nothin better in my book. 🎸🎵🇺🇸
Great song.
2014 silverado, the last of clean lines. I'm very biased on this!
Damn it boy you just keep throwing out keep it up
Your definitely going to be the next Hank Williams. For sure will be the next country superstar. You have THE voice of country royalty.
My 71 Dodge do me right
Wonder how many talented musicians we didn’t get to hear because internet wasn’t around and liberal music executives had total control of what got played
His voice is like butter
This is great, well produced. But, I almost like the selfies better.  Write good songs that resonate with people.
Better than anything on the radio that's for damn sure
Love it ❤
i have to work 6 days a week to make a living wage, 5 days just doesnt do it anymore, so he sings how i feel, an life is hard, living the life we all think we should have..  it hits hard, every time.. a real god send in these times,,
We who are about to smile ? Just keep doing what you’re doing and keep true to your self! God bless praying for you and all of us Brother 🙏🙏🙏✝️☦️🇦🇺
Can I come camp in that tent?
We all should find a way to donate to him for allowing us to hear his precious voice a gift from God he is well worth our $$
Ford and Dodge never get any love in a Country song 😂
This man just keeps getting better holy shit‼️
Dude you’re an awesome singer! I saw you a few days after you got famous and been a fan since. If you want to come out to Wyoming and talk with some working class cowboys you’re always welcome here!
Awesome voice and music!  Love your style... Pure Country Music at its Finest!  Thank you so much... Praying for You, Families, and America... From the Hills, Ridges, and Hollers of N Ga mtns to Virginia, I Thank you and Love all People... Living for our Lord and Standing for Gods Word until our Lord Jesus Returns to carry me Home!  He's my Rock, my Firm Foundation that I'm holding to, to carry me through until I can kneel at his feet. If you should make it home, look for me for thats where I'll be at Jesus' Feet, Amen Amen.  All Glory to God Almighty... 🙏🙏❤❤🇺🇸🇺🇸😁😁
Your music brings me back to life! Thank you a thousand times plus one more!
This is what I needed after a long day at work. Thank you. God bless you Chris, and god bless Oliver Anthony.
Awwwwwwww ❤❤❤❤❤
You are amazing Oliver. You have opened up so many eyes not only with your music but also with your incredibly strong faith in the Bible and our Lord in heavan and his redemptive power. Please write a song and bring awareness to the tragedy that has happened to the people of Lahaina and the 2000 children still missing.
Ya know him and Colter Wall would sound awesome together.
Good song to listen to while I'm sitting in my 94 Chevy 3/4 ton HD.
570 people suck.
So the closest I have ever gotten to listening and enjoying "country" music is Blue Grass. Which as we all know. Predates country. This music right here. THIS right here. Has me at least enjoying your country music. This is was amazing.
I wanna do music that hits like this!
1:20 - Tell me you keep that thang on you without saying you keep that thang on you.
Beautiful and heartfelt. Thank you.
Oliver please re-record stuck in the new world because it’s such a good song but poorly recorded
Same!!! This guy rocks!!!
Hello Agent, Walton Simons here. What an expensive mistake you turned out to be.
i love my 95. it would be great to find a woman that is half as reliable.
Thank you keep doing you brother!!! Much love
Beautiful. Just a great song with soul and heart. Wauw.
Yes Sir!!! Simple Life. Good Times.
My first car was a 1975 Chevy Nova with a 350. I miss those days, they seem so far away.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 you make me want to leave mississippi and head back home to the hills in va.
when you said dogs i was sold ... thank you
Hell yeah Oliver can afford a microphone now! 😂
Congratulations stay true to yourself don't sign with anyone because they would try to own you and tell you what to sing. I love all your songs the people of America has your back. Keep singing the truth from your heart
Wow! Definitely not a one hit wonder kid. Those lyrics were more powerful than Joe Rogans leg kicks.
Good to go.
Hell yeah brother love your music keep up the great work bubba🤘🏼
Oh my good Lord! How I enjoy feasting on your music. Your music, the lyrics, and the things that you say about God are so refreshing. It makes me sad to think how undernourished the world has become. We’re starving to the point of dying in our souls. So when someone comes along with simple words, simple music, simple truth, and a little bit of God, we gobble it up like we haven’t eaten in years. And I guess the truth is is that we haven’t. We’ve starved ourselves of good wholesome food and values. We’ve filled our hearts and minds with garbage. Thanks so much. Keep the truth coming.
Country music, honest, no frills, raw, from the heart. I like it. Thanks.
I’m so glad to see you have the equalizer right by your side in the truck. Stay safe brother, we need you.
I don't even like country but here I am listening to Oliver Anthony again and liking it
Everyone all of your song sounds the same😂
Oliver  I got 2 more songs for ya  Please get with me
Good stuff Chris! Thank you!
The only problem with any of your songs is we just don’t want them to end, every song speaks to us and we enjoy them so much we anticipate them to just keep going and going! Thank you so much !
Dont sell out
Plot twist the corp man found a way to invade you folksters. How many cameras you got on the video, how much did that tent cost. Smelling a little fishy ole red. Signed in the dotted line the part he will play just in time for Trump 24
Music
Sounds amazing can't wait till you come to Oklahoma City.
Congrats!! America loves this man!! ❤❤❤
Simply amazing music
Now this is country, I never liked the shit they have on the radio
Nice music, Chris.
Glad he’s rereleasing alot. Make money why you can man. Your singing definitely got better as well
This is what makes your music so powerful, it's where you sing it from. Where you live and where you're roots are, not on stage or on the road doing concerts. Never forget where you came from and the road that got you here. God bless.
Need to add in a harmonica.  Nice tune.
Another awesome song. Keep up the great music!
this is original American Bred
Is this country music? I LIKE it.!!! Then whats that shit they've been playing on the radio for 20yrs
Watching from Scotland dude. Good stuff this🤘🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
This guys songs keeps getting better and better keep it up
Very nice..keep em comin brother!
Great song!
This song takes me back to the good old days
Fire 🔥
Thank you, Chris.  Blessings.  John 17.
Dudes just singing about a normal basic goos life, used to feel easy but now its a damn dream.
Chris is my favorite artist too!!! He just resignates with the normal hard working people!!!  We love you Chris, keep it up buddy
Cool!
Rich men and women of Congress you have been put on notice.
❤❤❤❤
We're listening. We feel ya. We love it. ❤ Keep giving us real music. Have a blessed Labor Day weekend. From California
I sure miss my Green machine 97 chevy 305
Fire
Real music for real people.
Feel good song
That song was so awesome. I love this video two.
Great song, I’m curious if this was recently written?
God I love it!! Ain’t nothing like an ole heavy Chevy.  Please keep making us smile and reminding us what true country is!!!
His music is story telling
❤😊❤ just love ur voice ur so special and the rawness is what i am here for❤
“Might have to load up the dogs…”  Let’s Go!!!! 🐕
My guy sings bangers only. ❤
The best love song I've ever heard! Straight forward raw, real, absolutely fantastic!
I once had a 92 short wide. One of my favorites.
nice song mate
Love from Canada  🇨🇦❤
Beautiful
I'm SO glad you went this direction with your next song.  I lovee all your other songs, it's really nice to have something more lighthearted though that I can bump in the car with the Mrs.  To all the people saying you'd be a one hit wonder, or fade into obscurity in no time, FOH.  The style, charisma, authenticity, songwriting & love of real music that you put on display in these songs is timeless.  Keep doing you brother, God bless.
Man, keep up the good work. You're making music everyone can relate to and appreciate. I wish you all the best. Stay humble, stay grounded.
fuck me run'in
The visuals along with the tune and the lyrics made this my new favorite.  Thanks Chris.  Well done.
Makes me miss my 90 some S10.
All the glory to God  love your music
Looks like Chris built a guest room?  But is missing a dog.  I hope Mr. Hooch is well!
I miss this kind of music. Simple. Beautiful. Thank you so much for sharing your God given talent. Many blessings to you.🙏
Your amazing I have listened to I want to go home at least 10 times today and sober  I have been sober for 14 months and what I have achieved is amazing thanks for your amazing music
such a shame how Maga fascists tried to hijack your music.
❤
My favourite song of yours!!! ❤❤
"and I'm her Cash" put water in my eyes. Wish 'The Man in Black' could be here to cheer you on, cus son, he should would do.
1992 baby!!!
Glad you decided not to go commercial. They would autotune your great emotional voice.
Well, I really enjoyed this. Thank you.
Sounds like most of my best evenings
This is country music. We need more of this. Keep it up.
You are, what you are. Authentic.
I'm about to be 32yrs old Monday....but this is the kind of country music I want .....he reminds me of the old school country
It should have been a Ford.
Man your killin it Chris. Banger after banger keep on keepin on sir.
Very nice Chris❤ wish you the best of luck on your journey forward
downvoted
Just amazing!!!! This is what we have been needing god bless this man !!!! Finally we all agree on something! He was sent from good to us 🇺🇸👍🇺🇸👍🇺🇸💪🎤
Chris: GREAT, GREAT stuff. (!) Love it.
Real country
Love your videos and wish you the best of luck for the future
Now that is what country music sounds like, not the pop music they have been doing in Nashville for decades
He's telling stories that you cannot only feel but you can actually see it, the characters, the places, the setting sun from the back of a pick up... "hotter than hell' higher than gas"
RIP to my 91 IROC-Z from high school. 😢
And he's done it again!
dude, that voice!
🔥🔥🔥
been sayin this for some time now, there is no real music out there these days, most have gotten away from music in there lives.  being in my 50's  singing in front of my daughter songs of the past, she is impressed that I know the words,  when I crank up the music and get lost in the words  I get things done and time seems sweet vs sitting in front of computer  watching silly videos to political news madness... Music has a reflection of how we are as a generation  sadly where is the music of this generation  ???  beats done by algorithms   this gentleman's music is refreshing and kinda what we need to hear ...   music from the soul pure from the heart  and  with the right emotion in the voice ...   I "THANK YOU" kind sir
Awesome
Thank you Oliver Anthony ♥️ You ground my soul with your music. Keep going man, and thank you again♥️👏♥️🙏♥️
Why aren't your newer videos posted on your Rumble channel? Nothing there since August 13, 2023. You have more videos here on YouTube. Why is that?
Nothing but the best!!
Thank you!!!🥰
1've got a wonderful woman, a 90 some Chevy, and a Zebco. Redneck heaven, I am in.
W O W.... It's crazy how you sing with a southern conservative "voice" yet your "normal" voice and politics are that of a liberal shill? Odd no.
Something weird about this
Fill the freezer n keep makin music ppl lik3 us wanna hear PLZ SIR...I LOOK FORWARD TO REAL TALKS NOT TRUMP THIS N WHATS GONNA HAPPEN...EITHER HE ROTS IN JAIL OR HAS THE RIGHTS AS A CITIZEN. AND WE THE PPL QUIT PAYING FOR HIS BODY GUARDS
Your music comes from the down to earth lives of many struggling people in this country and your voice makes it real. Keep your songs from the heart coming. God bless you Oliver.
Sing it brother! The world has been missing music like this, and it's great to hear. I look forward to each new song you release!
I’m loving every song Oliver debuts!
Turned up the speakers while cooking over an open fire on our land. Best of living. Oliver Anthony puts out down to earth music to where we once came from. THANKQ
Another winner from OAM. Keep it up, keep it simple and direct to your audience. I’m off to buy this one and I’m sure the music industry is terrified as a result.
I bet Chevy likes this song!
Chris step away and process everything!!! Do not align with anything. Everything is the opposite of what has been shown. I had a experience very similar to yours  in 2018. A something full of love told me we were at the end of suffering. It brought me too my knees. The first words spoken as a light filled my room was the meek shall inherit the earth. I was taken after one year of bliss to the depth of separation. To be tested by god. Once you surrender you will be tested prepare my love. It is a difficult path.  When I heard your song I immediately knew Gods plan. The Omega.
wonderful
Chris I think your voice is amazing I think your guitar playing is pretty sweet and I also think your songwriting ability is sweet much love from Huntington West Virginia
Yes keeping it real… 😮🎉 much love from the holy land…
My favorite. 💖💖💖
Yes sir 🤘🏼🤘🏼 The days are long and the years are short!! Enjoy the company of the true family you have in life 💪🏼💪🏼
And everything without the need for any big corporate music industry parasites or fancy effects and mixing! Soul music is still alive.
Seen your appearance on JRE one of the best interviews out there it was really good to get to know you better no place better than with Rogan here's an idea in the future put a few bucks into making some limited edition pressings  on vinyl no studio enhancements the background sounds of the creek or a dog barking  would be cool whatever happens happens keep it raw and real but put said vinyl pressings up for auction and either keep the dough or favorite charity  strike when iron is hot I know its not about the money for you but certainly would be a cool thing to be out there
God Bless you 🙏🏼❤️🎸
Oliver is changing the game! We need an updated doggonit playthrough!!!
This reminds me of much simpler times. No cellphone usage or Onlyfans, just Back Country, BlueHoles & Bonfires. This Drags me right back Through The "PassageOfTime." I know I stole that from Harris, but no pun. 😂 Besides, what the hell would she know about the Passage of Time? She's yet to make it to our Southern Border  But I want to thank you, for you, being you. You're the epitome of authenticity.  You're true to yourself. We all can respect that. In that, you would never use you're music, or position to mislead others, as many other singers & songwriters have done throughout the years. Just look at Cardi B, Nas, Christina Aguilera or Sam Smith. As the Music Industry & their Musicians, have been using music as a means of manipulation & indoctrination.   They're acting as influencers, misleading our most influential youth. They know & understand how much of an impact music can have on today's generation of children. Music can be utilized w/malicious intent, whether that's to indoctrinate, or influence the young minds of a generation that can't think for themselves.   You're not like this. You are as real as it gets. Your music has impacted so many others in such a positive way. It ignites a burning fire & desire to do somethingwithin us all & forces us to see the truth for what it truly is. We resonate w/stories being told within your music, as though they were currently living it, played out in real-time.  #RichMenNorthOfRichmond has become the #BlueCollarAnthem of the #WorkingClass. You got me hooked on this #GrassRootsEffort, Style & Genre. Lord, Family & Freedom. You're the torch that lights the way, my Brother & others will soon come to follow & get right w/the Lord.  God Bless you my Brother.   #IWantToGoHome.
A real country musician, what a refreshing change from the "industry standard" bullshit thats been forced on the scene since the 90's...ironic eh?
Another home run.
Chris you are a natural phenomenon talented as no other and country to the max and we are witnessing a mega country star showing his talent right before our eyes✝️☝️✝️
Great song keep it up !
love it!!! keep them coming!!! and keep the appalachia in there, please!!! <3
Nice yurt man!
Great song!
This dude is a BOSS!
Big fan of the man.
Wow, his voice is just getting better and better. I love this version of his voice, it’s easier for me to hear the timber and richness of his vocals now. His singing voice (non-shouting/wailing) while “Rich Men in Richmond” is definitely a great song, sung with a lot of anguish and with his heart, his vocals truly shine in this song here, I like it! I’m not a huge country or folk type music fan because I enjoy rock music and R&B the most but this man’s voice and what he sings about is a true force of goodness and it’s real, no pretense, no ego, just what the good lord has given him, a beautiful voice to share with all of us, heaven sent.
Why did this make me cry?? It’s a blessing to hear beautifully written and performed music. Thanks for being REAL.
You're killing it! Banger after banger, I'm glad for you and your dogs :)
Good remake. Also the original take is good too
Given er on the back roads
Awesome. I am so glad for this underground country revival thats been going on the last few years. I can see you being up there with Sturghill, Whitey Morgan, Ward Davis, Hank III etc. I think we have another outlaw scene in the making here. Great work!
This man speaks from the soul. 25 years old just tryna find my way in life. You’re music inspires me and everyone that listens. Keep it up brother!
So great! 🎉
Stop playing a guitar made in Indonesia
Z71 Silverado
I really wished he would hv had a Ford truck setting on the side of the rd with the hood up and it smoking 😂😂😂😂😂
Really digging your playing style with that resonator -- just what needs to be played, nothing more and nothing forced. Fills in all the right spots and leaves plenty of room elsewhere. Like a breath of fresh air in the middle of the sh't-storm we're all navigating these days. You are appreciated!
Thanks for helping us find the path again after wandering around this political wasteland for so long
Your music is alive, it has soul and passion and it makes me feel like it knows me. None of the plastic crap nowadays does that. You are real and your music makes me feel alive. Thank You from India <3
Yee boy
LOVE THAT
makin 90's chevys great again. about to make my chevy avalanche cool again. or for the first time.
Chris, that’s some sweet playing, for a “Chevy Guy”, much respect to ya Bro.   Ed “Ford Guy”  See we all can get along.  Probably all do a lot better without a bunch D-Bags from DC, and the puppet masters pulling them strings. Just saying.  It ain’t the clown sitting on the throne, it’s that we believe we need a clown to sit there.
Reminds me of Ronnie van zant 🔥
Chris...thank you. The perfect song about my Jackie.
Beautiful
Keep them coming, brother. God Bless
Killin it
I love this!  Every video and song you sing reminds me of growing up with my grandparents in the WV/KY area.  I remember visiting them when I was young, and once the work was done and family was relaxing in the evening, we were sometimes blessed to hear them sing some of the old songs and hymns.  Thank you for blessing us with your music.
Thank you. Can’t find words more than that right now.
Thanks Chis BIG FAN.  Be well Sir.
Just real good country music you wouldnt hear on the radio. If anyone says they hate country they have never hear colter wall, tyler childers, waylon or other white boys like oliver anthony. The real stuff aint on your radio. excellent voice and simple guitar. No need for the full band. Bravo from north idaho.
This some real heartfelt music. A Man and his guitar with some amazing vocals and lyrics!
I'm a little offended. I don't think of a Chevy from the 90's as that old...
And all this time we've been told that Gingers don't have a soul.  LOL
Gen 1 Tundra for me. If you know, you know! 😜❤️
Looking forward to hearing your songs for many years to come. Beautiful work, brother.
Woohoo 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why everyone calling him Chris when is name is Oliver
The best singer songwriter of our time . Nashville better recognize him !! Just wish my Mom was still around to hear him ( 4 20 23) she would have loved him !
275 on his next life will be better
Perfection
I absolutely love this song! I put 640,000 miles on my 07 Silverado! Just awesome music and this is coming from a 80’s hair band guy!!!
Down home country boys ! Great music Oliver stay  strong brother.
Chris your music is amazing and I'm a metalhead!! I have a strange music playlist now. All the guys at work keep asking me who you are so the fans are growing. Keep it up!
This young man’s voice and  messages makes my soul smile. Thank you Chris!
Keep it up! Brother
My left kneesays night night...or i killed him...idk i didnt look back
A case of beer and a what? I can't make it out.
killin it.
Them 90s chevys are awesome to bad the women arent.
Much love brother!
You are amazing!!! Every song is a hit!!!!
Dude - Yes.  Dude just Yes.    Hes HUMBLE because all the BS over the last few decades gave REAL people imposter syndrome when it came to thinking THEY can do what THOSE guys are doing.  Truth is you dont want to be doing what they're doing-  they're forcing it out and telling people its what they want.  By some miracle here we have it-  Music people wanted and were missing.   Sir you are filling the gap in peoples lives for the music- the sound of real music that they feel- that they've been missing.  People have been listening to music for how it sounds not because they actually like it, they get some catchy sound they pronounce some certain way and repeat it til autism kicks in with people-  No this is actual music people want to hear and  THANK YOU.  You are getting the love you deserve-  and thats the truth.
Really good stuff! 💯✌️
My truck is a 90 some Chevy.
A soldier will ask u why do u wanna fight me...ill put ur face in the ground b4 u say another word...say im a racist so ppl can have a valid reason to fight me
I really hope you keep your music this way.  Hopefully success wont keep you from being successful.  Keep it going brother.
You are killing it keep it up brother
Reminds me of my obs
Preach it.
It's songs just like this that has me anxiously waiting for every new release! 💯💯💯 I absolutely love the sound, the message, just everything your doing brother. You truly feel like one of us!!! Keep up the good work,  God bless
FRAUD
Dang man! This might be your best one yet!
Are you putting your music anywhere in mp3 form for purchase/download other than itunes? You make some great songs!
All I got for you is "Damn Son!"
Roll a jay listen to music n par take
Fantastic song, great voice, love the lyrics.  This is true country at its best.
banger upon banger.
Just so good.
Sing ur heart out brother n make ppl mad for no fuckin reason.. They wamt a civil war but scared to fire the first shot....if ur scared to fight then why act tough
Thanks man. Love it.
after a long while of listening to fake generic country music that sounds like it was made in a factory this is a breath of fresh air, keep it up brother
Chris, Stay the course, your worth way north of 8 MILLION! I have listen to all your music for days now. It just gets better and better! The Lord is in control now, and he will guide you to where you are meant to be! And when you accomplish what the Loed has in store for you, you will be HOME!❤ You are one of the chosen few! Stay true to yourself and the Lord. The world feels what has been bestowed on you, and the blessings are being cast out through you. I’ve watched so many reactions from people around the world 🌎 hanging on each of your songs, and the words. Hang strong, stay the course! Ronnie East Tennessee
Wonderful music dont let them buy your soul
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ thanks for staying YOU! May God continue to bless your Journey
The  beginning of this made me think of George Jones. You should really cover and put ur own spin on it sometime. Hoping you come out with an album of your stuff soon! 🔥
Beautiful.  Please keep this sweet sweet music coming brother
yeah
Somebody buy this man some wire cutters
Another hit. Wow
🇺🇸
Can you imagine how strange the last two weeks must seem to this kid . He's not one meal and two dirt sandwiches poor but it's a big jump from everyday life to hanging out with Joe Rogan and probably a ton of traveling.
Not a chevy guy but songs amazing
Hot damn dude this was another great one. I’m so glad this new outlaw country is destroying the Nashville Noise. Pop country written by paid writers and sung by upper middle class yuppies has never been country but now others are realizing it. Keep on doing your thing man.
Another artist proving to the world that you don't need the corporate hacks in the music industry to out out good music. SUPPORT ACTUAL INDEPENDENT ARTISTS. Oliver Anthony & Tom MacDonald have proven you don't need the corporate music industry.
You are AWESOME brother
My song is " some old pos ram"
Get a Harmonica
I love how they said "He turned down $8 mill because he would have to fill an album" And this dude just starts pumping out hit's.
Every comment said what i came to say. You just keep putting out hits.
Love it.
Great song!!!
Song is actually hot trash. One hit wonder.... he is not even a redneck
He’s talking about sex
IDK why my comments keep getting deleted but I wish you nothing but success and happiness! Keep this amazing music coming!😎
They just get better and better with each song!!!
You play from your heart and soul  is why yo👍ur music is awesome.
Great song and video  I see the bell tent! I have the same one in olive drab
Great sounding song, but it's missing the truth bombs of rich men & go home... those two songs really hit the heart world wide❤  🇺🇸🇬🇧🇺🇸🇬🇧🔥🔥🔥💪🙏👏👌
Well done son I couldn't have said it better
Damn sure has been a long ass week sir. Think I'll take a page..
She's my carter and I am her cash is old school country! Love your writing more everyday .
I’ve got 1992 GMT400! 🍻
Come see us in Madison…again.
Great song chris
Dear Heavenly Father I pray for Chris. I pray that he will not compromise. I pray that You protect him and his family from harm. Keep his mind stayed on You. In all his ways he will continue to acknowledge You. In Jesus name. Amen
Absolutely true 👍
This one hits. Had to pause it cause it was bringing back memories. Well done, sir. Well done.
love this song  thanks Chris.
Guys more American than hot dogs and hamburgers on the 4th of July 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Why am I sitting here in my car whipping away tears after listening to this song for the third time in a row? Because it's a real song about real emotions that millions of us can relate to, not the contrived junk we've been fed for years. I almost forgot what real musical food tastes like. This is sweet.
My 94 Chevy Z71, still on the road, 315, xxx miles. Paint is faded, but easy to work on, and owned outright. I'll never get rid of that truck.
I miss my 97 blazer, lil red lucy had some amazing memories before being sent to the damn junkyard haha. Love your music chris, you've  got a soul no artist can compare too, your rogan interview was so eye opening and made me appreciate you more as an artist and human being whose just trying to get through this rough life 🙏👌
Well my Saturday is made! Love this!
Great song man. Keep up the good work.
Man this dude deserves everything he getting
He doesn’t miss
His voice is sweeter than honey!
This is a HIT!!!! Wow, just love this guy--and I'm not a country music fan! But this folksy-country from Oliver is special! ❤️
You writes songs like Alan Jackson.
Im 68 and have been into music my whole life. I have never seen a guy come along with such a powerful message, great lyrics and guitar. The fact that he is garnering millions of views and topping the charts shows that he is in tune with how people feel now. This is the 3rd song Ive heard from him and each one is great. His lyrics and timing are amazing, and the fact that he has turned down the big contract and all the glitz shows that he is the real deal.
Yahdah Yahuah Yahusha for life and this
Damn son you done hauled off and done it again.  This is and I wanna go home are hits.
Great song! Just left out the part about tapping the hood to pop it free cause the alternator overheated and warped it,
Now this is music! New favorite song and artist! Right there with Tyler Childers and Billy Strings!
Yes indeed he's the real deal
lets upgrade that peace, hit me up. ill make you something.
You just keep knocking it out of the park man! I love the soul and spirit you have sir! Delta Blues, country, folk, whatever you wanna call it, theres a soul and a spirit in your voice I think the worlds been looking for. Keep killing it brother, praise the Lord and thank you for your music!
Oh lawd, all the Ford boys bout to unsub now!
I wonder if wondedstar will come after this song too.
Beautiful voice and tone inflection-
Another great song my brother! Keep it up man I'm not a country music guy, but there is just something about your songs that I love.
This is right behind Rich Men!
High taxes and total control?   Sounds like the modern democrat party (DSA party)
Love it.  So happy for you,  Chris.  Happy that the Lord has blessed  us with your music and The Word........ and that He has blessed, anointed, and affirmed you. I only learned recently, at 63 years old,  that God is a God of ABUNDANCE, not poverty and despair.  If we fully trust in Him; conduct our daily lives with Him always  in mind; and understand He wanted this to be His Kingdom, here on earth, "as it is in heaven", and wanted all those who Believe in Him to have the keys to the Kingdom. It's time for believers all over the world to.....pick up those keys, spread His Word.... which is the Way,  the Truth, and the Light (Life) and, by the power of PRAYER, brush the devil right off.
Love your artistry! Beautiful site for this holiday. Keep your sights on, tracking skills up to date!👍🤍🕊 Spent many years livin' homeless in a tent.$$ woes.🏕 Sometimes we have to do what we have to do. So grateful for your courage & strength. May you have an awesome "Peace" filled holiday.😇Luvya!😘🥰
190k views in 4 hours. Good for you man, you deserve it
That was awesome
You’ve officially solidified that my favorite music genre is Country. 😃
The only thing missing is more dog shots. Give them beautiful pooches more screen time.
Another hit! Thank you
:)
That metal disc on his guitar is called a resonator. It makes an acoustic guitar sound like it’s got its own amplifier.
Every creator of art needs take a moment and realize they don't need any damn "industry"
95% of "music" on the radio falls into 3 catagories: 1: fmnst hoor 2: whiny simp 3: woketard. and then along comes Oliver. Its no wonder the music labels were falling all over themselves to sign Oliver and control him fast, he has singlehandedly exposed the music industry for the corporate scam it truly is
I got my 1998 Chevy S10 when my uncle passed around 2012.  He served in WW2 on the USS Kwajelaen.  He lived until he was 90 and cured his diabetes with his diet.
I bet he won't get a single CMT award.
Congratulations🎉😂
That Carter and Cash line is fantastic.
yipee , another JD Vance FRAUD who HATES poor and working /rural Farming by CHOICE people and culture. A cynical nA**hole Culture-VULTURE. Yuck , his music sucks also.
The kid has talent oozing out out of all his pours. Hallelujah! Watch out for those demons of success. Lord protect this man!!
1000 times better that that boot scootin' butt shakin' crap sold as Country Music for the last 30 years.
Practically Like another Hank Williams, Sr.
This man has a massive hog.
Ooo nice tent
Another Great Tune !
Is that the 90 some Chevy that fell off the back of the tow truck?
You forgot to sing about the 93 Dodge 12 valve 😉
I'll take some rural land and a camper and fresh air over any politician's town house or gated community in Washington D C
Jeremiah 16:19; O Lord, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.
This dude is just a simple man trying get the world to come together not divide that was Jesus Christ plan all lone it took a man name Chris to do it
Just patiently waiting for an EP to drop
Amen 🙏 keep ‘em coming!!!!
His voice is so sultry and rich! A true talented man with a story to tell too ❤
Every song he's got is gold
Case of beer and a “what”?  Zencone?
I use to like this guy but I think he lost his passion and soul with not saying his word is for conservative labor collar workers! So yeah I’m over him! God blessed him with Rich Men North of Richmond understand when God is with you and when he isn’t big guy!
Omggggg❤❤❤❤❤
Love your music brother! Keep being you and putting out amazing tunes!! Don’t conform to the ways of this world 💪🏼💯
Great now the cost of 90 some Chevys are gonna skyrocket after this
I fear for your life brother :( they don't like it when you turn them down; thank you for turning down their offer. You are a hero.
Please keep your music raw, just you and your guitar in the woods
Love it!!!  This is real life. Enjoy your music.
Well, my friend has done it again. G.
You are definitely NOT a one hit wonder!!
Legend
Really enjoy the authenticity of all your msic. I'm 79 and my Dad was born and raised in southwestern Virginia on the family farm. His father died in 1920 when my Dad was 6. 7 kids in the family. 5 girls and 2 boys. No welfare. Granny took in sewing and worked some at a tobacco factory. They all worked hard. Your music honors my family and I appreciate all your efforts.
Good call saving this one that is professionally shot and edited very carefully back to release after you magically became the world's number one sensation but already had the media strategy ready to go thank God! There just arent any other honest genuine Country songs about trucks and dogs these days. Bring back the 90s, Opie the Profit!!!
Man you should hook up w/TOM ,ADAM,&DAX. AND STAY BLESSED❤🎉🎉
🎉
No thanks.  Depressing music is not worth the bottle it came out of.
Absolutely love your music and style. Spent a few years in the commonwealth during my navy days. Loved Hampton roads area, Norfolk, VA beach , but loved it up north of there  by Williamsburg and of course Richmond. Knew some good folks off the beaten path. Got invited to join a Nascar truck farm team but I'm a Kansas boy and I really wanted to head back home and get started on my G.I. bill as a jayhawk.   Keep em coming Chris.   Someday I hope to get my foot in that music arena world as well.   Simple love song to my wife.  Check us out  Tiny and Tammy - Until Paris.
I hope this guy makes millions without a record label. @tommacdonald, might have some good advice on how to get it done.
Chris, I know you turned down that $8 million and it gave me more respect for you! I will say that I hope and pray that however you make a living, you make gabillions and stay real brother! True inspiration!!!!
Is this version gonna be uploaded to spotify?
Heaven sent
Thank you Chris for giving me hope in humanity. Keep true to your heart.
An artist who doesn’t lip sing and actually plays an instrument….. rare.
I like my 80s chevys better personally, but since that don't flow well with the song, that was a fair trade
Great Song! Of course the Feminists and the Anti-Gunners are going to explode when they see this Video, but too bad.
I am so proud of this guy. Major props for not signing a contract. Play from your heart, and we will listen.
Chris' storytelling reminds me of Tom T Hall....😢
Love It. My dad wouldn’t loved this song
Thank you for being a real voice.  You entertain and educate.
✝️🕊🇺🇸⚖️💙🙏💟
I dig the yurt
Maybe you and Ryan Upchurch can do something together would be wild to see
So when will you be on the Opry stage? You sure deserve it!  I'm not saying you should sign with anyone or anything like that but I feel it's a tradition and a right of passage for REAL country music artists. I'm so happy for you!
❤❤Thank you for the music. With love  Greetings from Germany
...touch of Bob Seger here...but uniquely Oliver
Driving along, 1911 in the truck. This is country music
Reject Country. Embrace Folk.
200k views in less than 6 hours. Not 100 people on Tube can do that.
Buddy, every new song you put out becomes my new favorite song. Awesome man. Keep doing what you're doing.
So thankful for your devotion and testimony! Wonderful vessel you are ❤ Procreate with your wonderful woman and continue your line! Be fruitful and multiply!!
Another great song ! Oliver just may save country from the hollywood fake. You are the raw, real talent and nothing can ever sound better than that.  Oliver reminds me of Hank Williams Sr. from lyrics to sound. God has blessed you and staying humble proves your faith.
It's okay again to compare a woman to a machine. THANK YOU CHRIS!
A yurt. ❤️👊
I heard Chris is a democrat playing music to make money off of Republicans
Well that's another wonderful song. Thanks for sharing this with us:)
Im sure telling a woman she's like a reliable beat up old Chevy is only romantic to us dudes.. and his female fans. I'm sure my wife wouldn't like me comparing her to a Caprice Classic or a Suburban but she's my reliable beauty with a 350 motor 🥹 ..I'll call her my Corvette lol
First time I disagree with Chris 90 some Ford  keep jamming brother
Reminds me of the days hanging with my dad in the Chevy Astro van. Not a pick up but dammit my dad was a Chevy guy.
Going to be another number 1 hit!!!!
Woah. You had me by the second line of lyrics. Nice job. I honored my late wife with a tribute collector car in her memory several years a go. Paid off the loan in June and she's getting a new clutch as I write. Love this one. Keep doing what you're doing. When the time is right you can consider a contract but be your own boss now and do what you want.
Never really loved country. Thanx to you i love it. Your texted are 🔥♥️
GOOD SHIT. THANKS GINGER WARRIOR.
Chris has pure talent plain and simple, keep on keepin on
Nice 1911 with Hogue grips(?). Great song.
I love your true-to-self style. Keep being you bro!
More cowbell!!!
Nice truck those years are bulletproof
This is the kind of music we very much didn't get to hear enough in frequent years unless you very much a underground artist doing the music you feel comfortable artistically. Oliver Anthony is the real deal of whats going which we hadn't heard the likes since Jimmie Rodgers (The Singing Brakeman) who also did recordings with a mike a guitar. Anthony is bringing back real rural music none of had heard since 1933.
👍🫶🤙
I heard he was running for president— 🤣🤣
Niiiccceee and slow!!! WOW….
Thank you Chris Oliver 😊 for your talent ❤
3,2,1 cue pitch man offer from the bowtie crowd. 🤠
It’s so nice to hear real music again
This ginger got a soul lol
This belongs as a movie intro, but since he’s not into that…..
Thank you
Another amazing song❤️❤️
I love this song! Super cute :)
Everything you sing is amazing my friend. Love the backdrop. Home
We need more down home voices to cut through the elites electronic jackboots.
Nice gun
She rides just right, when you turn it on 😮
Damn everything that comes out of your mouth and from that guitar sounds good!
Thank you
Good music brother.
I love your music. Can’t stop listening you bring me hope. I’ve worked hard all my life fixing to be 60 and have less now than I ever had in my whole life! Its not because I don’t work hard. I work a 40 hour a week job.I can’t afford to live in this world anymore. It’s sad when you hope you can pay your bills and put food on your table working 40 hours a week.
Thank you for not selling out !!!!
You keep makin me cry, but it's as beauty of a thing that's come over me in half your lifetime. 'Lord, I love the part of you that is Oliver Anthony Music'.
Yes sir buddy. You can't beat that with a stick.
Well, to no surprise you've done it again! Freaking Zebco, I love love it. Keep on brother...
keep it up - god bless
Keep em coming !!!!
This is just flat out GOOD MUSIC! Oliver, I hope you get all you hope for out of your music career! I love the simplicity of what you're doing and keeping it all the way real with yourself! Don't change who you are, whether the love you or hate you! Ive been watching you close. Good podcast with Joe Rogan as well! -Dee
Pure gold❤
Wow,  freakin awesome man.
Guess the price of 90 some Chevys just went up!!
Another great song and I love it that you are recording your music in the woods.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏽👏
Awesome brother 👏
I like your music, but you need to get off the fence politically. Take a damn stand man.
Love this!  I still drive a 96 Chevy.
I honestly think this is my favorite song so far
Every rock band from the 90's would be called country today. These days country just means using your actual voice.
Just LOVE listening to your tunes Chris. Keep it up brother. ❤❤
Another amazing song!
Just awesome!!!!
LOVE THIS, Chris! Awesome! Come play for us in Concord.....just down the road. We have a great barn!❤
Wow! Just wow! Thanks for this!
Change the word Chevy to Ford and at 350 to a  351 and I'll be with you!
Hell ya man we love ya here in Kentucky!!! The improved sound is awesome on that song bro 👍🏼🇺🇸
I prefer Ford.... but great tune
Astroturfed by daily wire, fake accent, name ain't Oliver. Something fishy about the guy lol he already using anti white talking points. Guy has the fake accent down tho
Love this one!! Should have been second single.
That's good stuff 👏 😊
It’s like all this guy knows how to do is drop bangers that touch ur soul
Great job as usual. 😊 I love listening to your music when I'm chill in my yard with my animals ❤️
That voice is a gift from God. Congratulations Anthony/Chris on all your success. Please, keep doing it YOUR way, your messages are important and you’re making a difference in this world.  🙏🏼🇨🇦
I'm not much of a country guy, but I like your playing.. You have a great weekend too kind sir..  Regards from the hills and woods of south central Indiana. The heartland. Indiana. USA Tim
Can we get all these songs on an album please 🙏
Another great song going on my country playlist. Keep them coming.
Beautiful
YESSSSSS😂 my favorite one!
Another one ❤ God bless ❤
So good to hear real music ❤
There might be better song writers but damn does he lay it down and it’s all relatable for us country folk
Another great one Chris!! We will see ya in Missouri!! Can’t wait. October 7th. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏻❤️
Ok buddy, this is my new favorite song, keep those words coming feller. Love it. Lot's of love from American Hillbilly and Hillbilly Nation, Hillbilly Up.
Sending love, Brother, from up the road a piece in Buckingham County, Va. we’re proud of ya❤
GOD BLESS YOU!
Oh how I live the 350 engine!
Man, that is banging in my brain. Great stuff❤
Got to say Chris you outdid yourself once again good ol country tunes keep em coming bubba you don’t need a band behind you just a guitar string and a mic
Absolutely beautiful Chris!!! Where can we get some of your shirts and stuff at buddy? Are you doing those or are other folks jumping in trying to capitalize off of your success? I’m scared to order anything unless I know it’s benefiting you and not some pirate somewhere!!  Take care brother, be safe my friend!  Love ya and I pray daily for your continued success cause your keeping me out of a bad, deep dark hole right now and I am forever grateful to you for that!!! This country needed you right now at this time and the Lord blessed us and you both by opening these doors for you and giving you the wisdom to know which door to walk through on that very special day!! God bless you young man!!! Never look back, but never forget where you came from either, it’s a delicate balance but out of all of us, god gave you the strength and wisdom to understand that!!
Take the newer country artists to school oliver
Remembering when it was normal to ride in the back of truck.  So much fun.  Love this song.
Great song. I have a tent like that  love it lol
Something for the soul
The GMC is subbing for the Chevy
Ah, I miss my 97 Chevy. I mean I love my wife.
Thank you for another great tune Chris !
every time i listen to his music it just sounds better
I love this!
What is he saying ....a case of beer and a ______????
Good stuff
A composer that can reflect real life, not fantasies or crazy lifestyles.  And his voice is real.
thank you for your music, thank God you didn't sign that record deal. keep your music your own and thank you for sharing it with the world.
I had a 94 green extended cab Chevy in high school and my wife and I spent a lot of time together and went in our first date in it. Showed her this song and danced in the kitchen
Oh that's another BIG winner
🤠✌🏼🙏🏻
Nothing quite like driving away from this world
Awesome!
HELL YEAH!
Reminds me of my Lady ❣️ love this song
Really good
I'm hearing more than a little Charley Pride in his voice! Thank you Chris!
Great song Chris. Incredible vocals and you make that Gretsch Resonator sound much better than what she costs. Well done!
Thank you.. from the other side of the pond 🇳🇱 Carry on son, this is your bright path after all the pain 🙌🏼
Told em where to stick their contract.
Love how you switched it up but kept it the same!
welcome back to real country music ! best song writter/story teller ive ever listen 2,,,this is needed in the crazy world we live in now.
Thank God for this feller’s talent and for his courage to share it with us. Just something special about WV and KY country music. And yes, I did own a ‘90 Chevy K1500 Z71 heavy half. Damn good rig.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Your writing is what makes you better than fantastic
Makes me miss my 90 some Chevy
Makes me live the days my husband now with Jesus… ❤
This is what is meant by "keep it real". You are the Hemmingway of music. There is no substitute for simple true words.
Somewhere up there Waylon Jennings and Haggard is smiling down knowing country has a chance to be restored again.
Thanks Oliver.  about a decade ago I bought a 99 Chevy 1500 for 900 bucks.  and for the past couple years I just can't justify buying another vehicle because people want 10 grand for something just a couple years newer.  And now you just went and gone raised awareness of how good these trucks are even after all these years..now I am just going to prolly have to buy like new, new and take a loan out for over 40 grand and I've never borrowed more than 10k in my life.
1911 in the car holster? This man is country 👌
I can attest.   I have three.
❤
Nashville don't make music like this no more.
Honest, genuine, hillbilly singing about stinkin’ human struggles and real life. Nature is such a gift to help lighten our troubles and stress! This song is incredible! Never change! You are a gift for healing our souls!😊
I love this video. It’s like you’re sneaking  a peek at his life.
Fantastic Chris. Thank you for sharing your music. Gods blessings !!
The new thing is to sing in the woods. Everyone is Fn doing this now. Not original
I drive a Ford but I’ll bump this in my ride! 🛻🔉
Glad to see these songs being rerecorded with the microphones they deserve ❤
Blam!
kimber 1911?
I see some comments say people don't listen to country music. I particularly do not go out of my way to hear it until now. When you think about it , what do the words country music mean...?  IT'S MUSIC ABOUT OUR COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE!  COUNTRY MUSIC IS THE PLIGHT OF THE AMERICAN MAN AND WOMAN.  (Perhaps weird space-age techno music is safe for those of the other 69 genders).  So when you hear the words are country song that's an American telling you his plight, his state of life, his being...  It tells the story of the American soul.  And it's hurting like hell right now
Don't STOP. Please keep writing and singing.
Praise Yahweh!  Thank you for making Organic music that comforts and cuts deep into the human heart.  In the world today most music that we’re allowing into our minds is poisonous and  influences us as a society in the wrong direction. Thank you Chris for making music that’s healing & encouraging the people.  God bless you!
G’day mate 🤝🏻 Great song, well done Thanks 👍🏻🦘🇦🇺🦘
It's a beautiful thing how these days people don't need these record labels and advertisers. We all can just create music at home and put it online for the whole world to hear.
This song and all of his others are how country music used to be. Chris is the best I've heard in years. Thanks for the awesome music, keep up the great work. I can't wait to hear more.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love this song And everything Your Doing. God Protect This Man And His music 🎶 🔔❤️ In Jesus Name,  Amen
Just wanted to say sir. Thank u for what you do. You truly are a beautiful person. I have some health issues happening now and your music is exactly what I want to hear. God Bless you and I hope you get only the level of recognition you desire. Because I understand that may be an issue with some people. Sorry for your troubles and struggles but I believe it happens a certain way for a reason . Thanks again
Like a rock...Tune is just solid.
Another good one.
I hope this dude records everything he creates in the woods. Please don’t ever step inside of a studio
Love it brother thank you for sharing
Love the song!!!! I stoped listening to country music a long time ago because Nashville, TN became the Hollyweird of country....I love your lyrics....
🔥🔥🔥
Listening to this man is amazing but listening while high is one of the best things I have ever done
You're such a talented lyricist. It feels real and authentic with you.
This is your best effort yet, Red... Stay true.
Thank you for sharing your gifts. Great voice, great songs.  May God bless you.
Thank you, sir. I needed that.
Seized my throat. Couldnt talk if i needed to.
❤
Chris, you speak for more than you know. Ain’t no one better than anyone else. We’re all just blind men trying to find the light, struggling with our darkness and trying not to die.
Son- you are blessed by the hand of God. Continued success bubba
Stay acoustic. Stay solo. You do not need a band. Your voice and your guitar has its own special sound. It feels real and talks to us. Do not change that.
You've sang this song before. This version sounds better
I daily a 95 z28 with the lt1 350. 60% of the time it works every time 😂
Sometimes God sends angels, sometimes he sends Oliver Anthony
That's a damn good song ❤
I'm from Nebraska. And your music brings me back home. Thank you.
Just makes me feel at home I myself feel just like a lot of people this is taking country back to its roots. Pop country has its place but you can never get more pure country than Chris's music
This is so catchy! Props to you Oliver Anthony!
This is first country ive listened to in over 20 years. Reminds me of...country music. Not bad rock bands with a fiddle.
The beauty is in simplicity. Just a dude with a guitar. No fancy bullshit.
Rawr, lionesses and kind kings
❤GOD BLESS OLIVER ANTHONY! 🙏
Real music. Nothing artificial. Takes me back to the days of real country music. The stuff today is mostly country / pop. It’s horrible. Stay humble Oliver Anthony Music.
I think I can now finally get over the loss of Johnny Cash.
Love listening to your music mate! Inspiring stuff, Ive picked the guitar up again and im enjoying playing after years of feeling uninspired.  Thanks so much for your music bro. You're a real talent! 🤠🤘💚
This has been my favorite song so far ❤
Love a pure and simple emotion.  Show it when you feel it
Should've been driving a 90s Chevy instead of at least an 08 😂
thank you Chris for makin me love country... much appreciated brother :)
This is a happier song than some of the others I've heard. Keep being authentic
Stay focused on things that matter, son.  God, family and freedom. Love you.
You have found your calling.  This is God's purpose for you.  To put the feelings of millions of into a contextual piece of beauty that God would do his dang self... But is tone-deaf like the majority of us! 😅  Hey the good Lord appreciate the good sense of humor too!  Stay true to your roots and what you were taught and what your heart tells you.  With love respect and appreciation...Mair
Good job Americans for worshipping neckbeard number 3910234 instead of taking care of the demographic destruction of their country. Diversity is your strenght
That’s quite the love song!
Dam I love this song Chris! I like singing to my woman, it gets her all riled up.. you already know what happens after that!
Another beautiful song. Good lord. 🤘
Chris SO MAN ME LLUONS are loving your   music! Wishing you the BEST!
He’s the goat of the 2020s already!
Wow! Just wow….
I live in a small town in new brunswick canada and i came out of a store today and a car went by and i heard rich men north of richmond playing in his car,it put a big smile on my face.i only wish i was your neighbor so i could listen to you all the time
What an incredible song thank tou so much god blees ya🙏🏼
Insanely talented young man.
This guy is the true voice of being a Democrat. Pro union, pro blue collar worker, stick it to the man. This is the new punk.
CAPTIVATING FOR SURE
Singing about loving your wife, a novel concept these days. Oliver just doesn’t miss.
My favorite, of course I have a 97, and a creek, and some dogs, 350 still runs just fine.
It's nice to see a fellow VA born fella with some common sense make a difference.
My first truck was a single cab 95 Chevy full size with the vortec v-6 and a 5 speed. God that truck was fun to drive.
Well thank God for Chris! As long as he doesn’t go woke he’ll continue to be successful and rightfully so: a country singer who’s actually country. I can relate to that!
Wow. The original was fire but the real mic helps so much. Keep it up bubba.
If this music is for the soul.
Man, everything he sings gives me the feels. This is real, down home, country music.🙂
Oliver, this is a bad ass video and a fabulous song. I absolutely love this thank you sir thank you so much for sharing this. I love the dogs. 👍⭐️
Best thing about being independent is you can release songs whenever you want, if you were on a label these songs would probably be released months apart
Great song man this old country boy loves it. You are doing it just right I can see my life when you sing. Many times loaded you wife zebco  and the old hounds up and went to the bottoms. Keep doing your thing. God bless
This is APPALACHIAN FOLK MUSIC.
That's what country music is supposed to sound like
Awesome driving song brother! No joke ❤
Love it, love it, LOVE it bruda! I had givin up on country but for u and Jami Johnson!!
Thanks
Great song brother right up there with Chris Christopherson
Carter and Cash, damn now.
Love you man, thank you for continuing to warm our souls❤️
By the grace of god...
Not gonna lie, I upvoted as soon as I saw them doggos.
This man is bridging the divide created and fueled by the soulless.
Nice.
Best since Jonny Cash
This man sings the truth. Amen brother. We don't need to sing hallelujah to praise our Father. Live with dignity, protect your own, be decent and generous to those who aren't in your community and maintain this standard. Be the better Man. Stand tall, and use that height to slam down on idiots who demand that you walk away from truth.
That was a good one man! 👍
Love this one!
3hrs later 150k views I'm so happy for this guy
I dunno, this wreaks of CIA.  Maybe I'm wrong, hopefully.  My gut just doesnt feel right here, it's too good to be true, at too good of timing. I dunno.  :/
Love this one
As a man who drives a 94 Chevy, I approve of this message. Hauled my kayaks to the river in it today. Great music from a real American Patriot
Yep!
Number one👍🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆 Greetings from Italy Oliver Anthony 🏆🏆🏆❤
Digging it
My first truck, 1990 two tone
Great song!
Higher than gas lol
That truck better than any of these new ones. 100%... Wait a minute. They done fucked you up filming you in a 2010 somthin chevy for the vid. If that ain’t your salvage title truck you already fuckin up.
Also, thanks for showing your hands, love learning the new songs!
Another good one! Keep doing your thing, Chris.
Solid dude making soulful music!
And another perfectly done banger.
VOTE REPUBLICAN NO MATTER WHAT ❤
Got drunk and got laid in the back of my old truck. Heard it before, but this version sounds okay
Hands down, my favorite artist of all time!❤ I've been playing all his new songs on loop. Try to get his songs in the top #5. Let's help our brother out....he is pure talent, uniting us and he deserves it! God bless us all❤❤
Excellent!
Another Winner! 👏👏👏👏
You sir have incredible talent! Plus you seem like such a stand up guy! Thank you for sharing your awesome songs with us!
His music takes me back in memory and this is the music that I grew up on my Papaw listen too music like this..  this guy is definitely refreshing and his voice  has soul rhythm one best artist with ikd souk I've ever heard
This is the new generation’s nitty gritty song.
Just lovely. Made me smile and imagine. Thank you.
Keepn it nice and simple 🌟 just what the WORLD needs !!!!  Bravo young man  🎶👌.
If your not country you might not understand this music
Dropped it down a key........easier on the vocals for sure. My favorite tune of them all
Deep gift Thanks
I never listened  to this kind of music.   I love him
🔥
Love your music!  Had my 16 & 17 yr old daughters listen and now they love it too.  Thank you from Boca Raton Florida ❤
dude is problably the first guy crushing it with chatgpt lyrics. j/k Great songs holmes.
Love it Chris keep it up brother
Great song.❤
the voice of the people.
Dudes voice is so smooth and full of life
Oliver Anthony... a PROPHET.
How in the world are you cramming out these bangers all the time??? I've listened to this one 5 times now I can't get enough. Do you have a patreon or some way to donate?
Holy shit. One Song better than the One before.  Me as a german does  not get it  all. But my heart understands.  Pro- human!
Well Chevrolet's gonna be blowing up your phone now lol.
Probably one of my top 3 songs man, great song . And the relatable fact of having a 350 chev
Dude is out here letting off a barrage of Bangerz. Back to back to back to back. You’re on fire brother. Keep it up man.
Nothin` better`n startin` at th top of the charts...
I'm really digging this guy. I've been wondering where I could find some good country music here on YouTube that's not industry music. For decades I enjoyed country music because it was good. But as of the last several years country music has been hit by the virus that has hit the entertainment industry in North America and Western countries. And now finally country music might be finding its way onto YouTube and the internet away from the labels contracts and stifling. I hope this is the beginning of Something Beautiful with many more talented artists like this man. This was a good song and I've dug the other two that he did. Well done boss
Incredible. Just every song sounding amazing and hitting you in the heart.
💪💪💪🇺🇸
Beautiful bro.
A case of beer and a Zen koan?
country music is BACK
We would have had to call the authorities if you were singing about your 68 F100 with a camper Top saggin, don't get no Miles per gallon but she's sittin by my Mansion...
🙏🏻
Brother its kinda creepy how this song relates to me and my wife. It's like you followed us around for years and wrote a song about us. I love everything you do brother!! Keep up the good work!! You need to come to shelbyville tenn
I love Oliver Anthony!! Dude dosent miss!
This music makes me cry happy😊❤
💙🤟😁🔥
Guy comes out of nowhere and just continues to drop bangers
Thanks Chris. We appreciate ya brother.
I can't wait for more =)
I think this guy might become famous!
What a beautiful tune. Loved it.
I was so hopong you'd record this one. I love it!
KEEP UP THE GREAT SINGING OLIVER - YOUR GRANDFATHER IS LISTENING PROUDLY  THE LOVE OF A GRANDFATHER IS WORTH MORE THAN ANY MONEY ON EARTH
Everything this man writes is 🔥
A GMC counts as a Chevy, right?
Take.the. money. Otherwise you are just another moron moaning.
I’m glad you redid this one. I’ve been listening to the first version in my car and still love it. But the mic makes it sound that much better in tye car! 👍🏻
Keep doing what you are doing. Don't let the man screw you. God bless you and your family.
Praying you stay humble and kind. Don't let the evil, demonic ones stray you off your path. {stay on the narrow road] Love your tunes. God bless you and your family. Godspeed my friend. 🙏💙
This guy is just amazing. Everything he singing about is right there around him. I don’t know if we have ever seen anything like this in our country or the world. We all desperately need it.
Waiting for some political party to politicize this song and ruin the good vibes
Where’s the white dog?
Waiting for some political party to politicize this song and ruin the good vibes
Wow.
Phoney
Man, another great song.  You're just going back to the basics, heartfelt lyrics and a guitar.  Since you won't sell out to the country music industry, I bet they are going to try and find a way to capitalize on your sound.
Just Awesome.
fun song
What a great song Chris. Keep ‘em comin.
Silky smooth man.
Homeboys’ out here making country great again!
Not my favorite song but it feels good. Country music hasn't felt good in decades.
Lovin this music.  Not the stuff coming out of Trashville.   It used to be country, but now its all about the money.   Thank you for keeping your music real!
"so tired every day, doing' her in my 90s Chevey, darlin' gettin' old just like mah Cheveeey"
I haven't listened to country for my whole life. Just couldn't relate to the vibe of it. Until now. How does the audio sound so good and one take?
Oliver Anthony doesn’t write songs.  He writes anthems that stick with you and make you pause in reflection!  I hope you don’t mind me saying so, if you catch this Sir, but I arranged “I’ve Got to get sober” on piano today, and I love how it came out.   I’m just a random fella.  Just love music. :)
Great Tune!
Awesome Job Chris! Love it
Keep it up brother. Loving it.
OMG YES!!!!!!! I love this!
Congrats to the success, you have an amazing voice, great songwriting.  The world is craving authenticity and you sir, have it.  Thank you.
Now this is music. When I first heard Rich Men North of Richmond, I loved it, but kinda thought he wouldn't be able to match it. Boy was I wrong. This guy is the real deal.
I got a 85 Chevy with a 350 but close enough ahaa this song hits home
His songs are so soulful!
With a rapper being the face of country because they didn’t have shit! Then this dude blows up! Real country voice right there!
Wow 👌 👏, I really love his work, go Oliver
That sure is some beautiful country there and gorgeous animals - I can see why you’d never want to leave it there. Thank you for sharing your songs and life with us. Another GREAT song and video. 🙏🏻With Gods love and blessings 🥰
Sounds real good.
This is a damn good song 🎧
I'm a fan!
Man these song’s sound so good i mean they sounded good off your phone microphone too but the quality of the sound now is so much better!! Really makes your voice come out.  Good job keep doin it. The rogan cast was also amazing glad to here your side of it.
Beautiful song Chris.  Texas loves you ❤❤
This is what country music should be! 👌🏻
Thank you Chris !! Your music is amazing . My family and I all love it my two boys are playing it every day it’s incredible what you did for the people of america. A lot of tears hit the ground when you released rich men but they were good tears that the earth needed . You’ve opened up a new world of pride and belief and I just wanted to say THANK YOU and WE ALL love you and appreciate your message it is powerful.
This guy cannot miss due to authenticity
Please please please never change !  You are what we all crave and love .
American soul music 🎶
Heard his interview with Rogan, he said his music wasn't good because he didn't have training. I don't want smooth and fake. His music is REAL! Real is beautiful! ❤️👍🇺🇲
Please keep the nature sounds, the crickets, cicadas, and frogs in the background of the music. That’s the version I’ll buy. 👍
Banger after banger!!!
How does every song he comes out with give me goosebumps 🤯
Is this what country music sounds like? I am a fan now.
It is proven that you can do music on your own without any strings attached.  God bless Oliver Anthony. I love the music, this is real music.
This guy doesn’t miss. 👀
Another awesome jam!! Let's see all the "rappers" piggy back this one!!
Nice work Just remember Have fun, make money, make a difference.
The true country/folk artists like Waylon, Townes, Shaver etc are smiling down on this man right now.  This is REAL country/folk music
Hits my soul. Got a 93 Silverado that's been passed around the whole fam. Still runs. Our women do too lol
Record label Exc's out combing the woods looking for another guy like this... lol.   Good song man.
Thank you sir for sharing your amazing talent with us it has been an honor watching you blow up and I loved most every work of your Joe Rogan Experience episode
🤘🤘🤘
This is REAL country music.
Love the full vids! Stay strong and stick to your convictions.
Amazing voice and 100% authentic. A true star. Have you already checked out Emma Kok? The Dutch 15 year old singing "Voilà", a French chanson? She's your equal in authenticity and passion and you could learn why you yourself have captured the hearts of millions.
Hell yeah brother
One Love from Germany ❤
she's my carter im her cash is brilliant
Great Music. I still want to call you Oliver because it sounds so Country like
Not really a country music fan but love this his songs.
i would turn down all the money too....otherwise you would lose your soul
What can you say other than Oliver is a welcome breath of fresh air.
If you like this kind of music go check out Jim Lauderdale. He wrote 15 of George Straits hits and not only a great songwriter but singer too.
❤😢
Todays my 26th birthday, glad OA dropped this GEM. Lifes been a serious struggle at the moment... Stuff aint like it used to be forsure, but God keeps Me moving🙏❤️❤️
Great music
I love the pups
Amazing REAL music
You’re the 1 Chris!!! Love you & thank you ❤
This dude just keeps dropping Gems!
Just fabulous, just fabulous.. America has been needing this type of music for such a long time. Music from the heart.. Thank you Oliver!
Why do people copy other don’t y’all have y’all own why?.. dude was put on to blind more than y’all are already
When I was a young girl I hadn't met anyone like Oliver. I don't know that I would have appreciated him. I sure do now.  A salt of the earth , blue collar working man that loves the simple life.
Your lyrics are creative and flow incredibly well. I may have said it before but it's like you're having a conversation that rhymes, set to music. It's not a formula, but the themes and melodies are revisited, making it relatable and consumable. This song proves you're more than one song. Awesome job, brother.
I would love  for you to come up with a worship song.🤗🥰
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪👌👌
Beautiful! Love to hear these songs again, on the new recording gear!
I’m worried he’ll stop talking about class issues since he got the record deal and will make typical country songs like this.
Hello from México. I love your músic...❤
Amazing!!! 👏👏👏
Just an other great song
Sooo Good!
Ridiculously good!!
What a great reminder of the Good Ol’ Days❤️ Thank you🙏❤️
Oh my God this is a beautiful love song❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
HELL YEA BROTHER
raw, but very real and pure and honest
Yessssss love this one too+
You're an amazing song writer Chris... hold on to your integrity. - Christ is King
Another great song!  Thanks!
Being raised in the deep south by a Granny who worked her fingers to the bone in a sewing factory just to barely afford food, clothes, and keep the lights on, I've found this music resonates with a place in my soul that I haven't been in touch with for a long while. I'm grateful that this young man is finding success by being who he authentically seems to be, speaking to a place in all of us that we may not even know is there. It was a joy to hear him on Rogan, and learn more about who he is and why he feels compelled to tell the story of those of us who quite often go without our story told.
This is hands down my favorite song and I absolutely love the video
Been a long week a lot of us feel like that, crazy!
Keep doing you brother! Love it.
Adoroooo🇧🇷
Chris great song brother. Hits home. Sure wish I could sit down with ya one day and just shoot the shit. God bless
This is what music should sound like, I love this song. Fantastic
Nice tent!
Damn man, you are amazing.  So proud of you ❤️❤️❤️
Chris, hit me up sometime, sorry I lost touch since our adventure on your property back on new years eve...keep it up brother...I always knew and told everyone about how you can sing and play in an unique way...everyone loved having ya here last year at the bon fire...hope ya can make it again this year...I can keep it on the down low  if ya decide to join us again.   Btw...I'm pretty much pain free these days. I shouldnt be limping this year! Lol..So glad to see ya sober! Hope to see ya soon.
Am I the only person who has been in an endless scroll hole of his music for the past two weeks?  Lol
Dude, you're killin it.
As a shitty guitarist myself, I really appreciate your approach to songwriting. Sounds really fresh Bro. The lyrics and your accent make me think of only one thing. America! I am from the Caribbean
Another hit
Another masterpiece well done
Literally get the chills listening to this. Rare power this music has.
This song is a beauty. You can very easily listen to this if you had a Chevy in any year before it as well
Incase you didn't know his real name is Chris! Oliver Anthony is his stage name as a tribute to his grandfather "Oliver Anthony". Have a nice day 😊
Every song you put out is great.. love your music from a fellow Virginian keep on being you budy we are listening
And he is a chevy man yeeeees
Keep doin' you sir.
God Bless you for your inspiration and having some faith in humanity.
Love every song this man makes,keep em coming 💖
Real music
Gold! God bless brother...
Oliver Anthony has me enjoying Country/Folk!!! How 😮😂 have my ears deceived me all these years?
Real country music!
Mid
🔥🔥🔥🛻🔥🔥🔥
God Bless you Chris! 😊
Bros voice is coming from Jesus
90 some chevy...love it!!!
Good music dude. Keep it up
How many hours for 1 mil views? You've blown up! Congrats!
wow man. REALLY good. Like REALLY good.
Awesome song!
GMT400. '91 C1500.
Love it Chris! ❤
Love it ,My Man. Keep churning out that soul. ❤️🙏
Had a 1979 Chevy Monte Carlo
Need your cd of music....your music comforts me.
I was always a fan of the old stuff... Merle singing about surviving the depression, Cash about prison, Jones about hopeless loves, Waylon and Hank about letting loose. It's good to hear that kind of music never disappeared, it was just waiting to be discovered.
Thank you Christopher for witnessing to Joe Rogan.  It was beautiful to see you stand up for JESUS.  You are a good man!!!
I loved the Rich Men North of Richmond song. But is it just me, or does every song have pretty much the same melody?
I am a vinyl collector. I really hope someday you do a pressing of your songs.
Pickin' and a packin' Yeah we noticed. 😊
This should be a Chevy commercial.
Love the Glock
Killin’ it man!
How come that this guy is a democrat? I can’t believe it he is too good to be one in this days democratic
Plain-spoken simplicity can really strike a chord in such a world of noise and confusion, and wholesome humility welcomed like a long, cool drink after a hard day's work. Y' done well, laddie! Bless you.
Chevy actually made decent cars in the 90s. I relate so much to this song and all your others! Keep it up!
I can’t even listen to your songs without cryin’ like a baby(62 year old man!) I’m a Chevy guy too!!😂  Thank you brother!!🙏🇺🇸
So proud of you Chris. Keep preaching brother.
Please don’t ever go mainstream and sign to a label. I would hate to see your style erased. Can’t find music like this anymore
Another one. Man just thank you. Just...thank you. Youre able to articulate my thoughts.
Man this is so good!  Fantastic job!
Even this Ford guy is diggin this one👍🏻
You know I normally don’t like most country, but you’re one of those rare exceptions.  That’s for putting your music out here for us to listen too.
Amazing!! Bro you are so good.
Pandering to your audience I see
Good song man. I like
❤ love your music!!
Wonderful son.  You can sure strike a cord, both on your dobro and in our hearts.  You go Chris!  We are watching and lovin' what you're doing.
Take all the money you can! Life is long and USA is expensive and cancer will get 6 of 10 people!
Great song, buddy
Whoever your videographer is/are, DONT LOOSE THEM!
Good song but I like his original raw version better.
Love this! ❤❤❤❤ 👏 👏 👏
Not good One hit right wing wonder
Like musical theater of the mind just close your eyes
How is every song this guy makes so fucking good man
single malt OA
Wow so good. I love this song 🎉
This guy is the reincarnation of Woody Guthrie but without the socialism.
Your music is fantastic. I would never consider myself a fan of this type of music before. I have always been a Metalhead, but something about your voice and the things you sing about and the simplicity of a man with his guitar and his dogs... It's so appealing to me. I think it's the authenticity. In a modern world where 98% of music singers are made into stars by producers and most can't sing better then your avg person without digital effects and don't write their own music etc.. A genuinely talented person with real life experiences to sing about just strikes home.
Your MUSIC IS GOOD TO LISEN TO  BEAUTIFUL ❤❤❤
That's a lot of views for 2 hours. Kudos.
...and he has absolute artistic freedom.
I grew up in the back of a 94 suburban!
Got me a 96 Chevy and a 74 women!
Good stuff. 👍
Hell yea, real music not shat out of a corporate machine.  This is what pop country musicians pretend to be, genuine.
Dude just release that independent album so I can give you my money already! I can listen to this stuff all day.
I genuinely never cared for country music, but i love yours man.
I used to think I didn't like country music, what i didn't realize was i was never introduced to true country. When I was told is was country it was just soulless script made for the charts. Thanks for this music Christopher.
Jimmy Buffett is doing his last " Labor Day weekend show ".. And Oliver Anthony just released another hit... The Universe is in perfect order
Epic Song 🎧
WOOO!!!! BRAVO!!!!
I heard your story of finding your voice after hitting rock bottom!! This is the universe showing your path and your potential! Stay pure and never forget the this phase and realize you’re still the common man. We can all find this strength. Keep it up beautiful brother. Amazing!!!
Everytime I hear a new song of his, by the end I'm sitting here with watering eyes. What the heck is wrong with me?
I have a 1991 GMC Sierra XLC with almost 400,000 miles on it ,,I drive it everywhere, anywhere, anytime. Only thing that doesn't work right now is the radio ,,and I don't care. Seats and carpet look new, body is in wonderful condition,People are always coming up to me wanting to buy it. I tell em' they don't have enouth money to buy this truck.
90s Chevys were  good.   My mid 80s  Chevy blazer was so awesome. Fixable.    After 2008 they were not good. Then by 2012 they were  worse. 2016 they were junk. Now , even new, they are piles of crap. Overpriced,  loaded with stupid technology,  unreliable  garbage. Some have had major engine failures just getting them off the transport. Happy days are gone. We are really sinking fast.
Love your studio! This sh*t is real!
To all you WOKE C**ts  This is what Country sounds like!!!
A return to real country
He's awesome! Thank you for the music all the way from Canada
Personally hate country but you sir are killing the game.
Great song! A collab with Colter Wall would be great I think 😃
Some of my best memories was in a 98 s10..kicker comp 10s with a punch 900 ..loved that truck ..✌🏻
As an owner of a 98 chevy 2500, i know a woman must be pretty damn amazing to compare love of her to the love of a 90 something chevy.
St. Oliver really knows how to touch your heart ❤️
I see thousands of likes on y’all’s comments if you can like a comment please remember to like the video … that’s how we keep this going … that’s how we change the algorithm… they want to take our dislike button away we have to give power to the like one then … god bless you all!!!
Damned good song, man. Bravo.
Damm good song😊
American values making a come back.
Fuckin guy cant miss
i saw a comment that talked about his departure from music standard. i really respect his pure talent and lack of frills
Nice and simple.  Great song.  👍
Mines a 95 Chevy!
Fucking great Chris!  We love you man!  Stay well!
Legend in the making 🔥
This is country I can jam too. He speaks my language.
Who wouldn't want to give this a listen
As a New Englander, I've never been able to relate to country music as much as I have with Oliver Anthony Music. Ya gotta love it.
Good music is universal. From God the vibration comes
Mr. Jones asked, "Whos gonna fill their shoes?". well sir, them shoes fit you well
90s chevies weren't that great
Beautiful ❤
Here before this one goes crazy viral too
I Dig It
SAME DAMN TUNE OVER AND OVER ( Rich Men ) ...........play something new . Your milking it dry now .
Please don’t pull a Tyler Childers bud! You deserve the attention you’re getting… stay true to your beliefs, and Gods precepts and you’ll do just fine!!  Hold fast, and ride slow… sending love from Wilmington NC
Great tune Oliver.  Loved the video
Keep it up brother hell yea
So long Nashville! This man has put the final nail in the coffin of all the crap country music coming out of that city.
reminds me of a hank 3
Keep going what God puts on your heart Chris, another banger for the books.
Another great song. He proves that if you have a gift you don't need millions of dollars worth of production crap like so many need to make them sound good. I have said for years that many of these so called entertainers couldn't even play one musical instrument if their lives depended on it.
I remember being 16 and sitting next to me boy friends in his 1980 Chevy listening to 38 special the reservoir  thanks Oliver❤
I shared your playlist with a friend of mine, he told me to check out Billy Strings. Don't get me wrong, Billy Strings is exceptional. But he did the one thing you refuse to do. And that's join the commercializes fraternity of today's country music industry. Turn the radio on 20-30 years ago, tune it to your favorite country station, and you heard real country music. What they play now, commercialized, synthesised crap that's been run through so much sound equipment, that if the "artist" were to cut all that modified crap out they wouldn't even be in the top 1000. Oliver, you have the gift. You are well on your way to being compared to the great country voices of yesteryear.(of which only a handful remain with us) Keep doing what you enjoy, and at the same time bring the country back to country music.
Great song!!! You never disappoint!!❤
Beautiful voice and playing.
Music for real county boys, just like me.
🔥
That voice!!! Would NEVER EXPECT THAT!!! Awesome Bro!! Also,... I got your back! F&#%$ Wranglerstar! His time will come! Keep doing what you do Bro!
This is real heartfelt music ❤
your doggos look like bears! haha they r so big n fluffy, so adorable
Dude your song writing skills and singing is raw talent. We love you.
Beautiful song 🎶 ❤
Im not into country but he has caught my attention.  You can actually hear what hes singing.  I totally relate to his messages.
Keep'em rolling.
oh I adore this song!!!
Such wholesome vibes and pure music ❤
Keep singing from the soul brother ;
Your doing good work my friend, I've been looking to get sober and picked up the good book.
I was just listening to the version you uploaded on your phone right when this one dropped !
I can't put into words what i feel when i hear this/him in general ❤. I want to smile/laugh/cry at the same time. Absolutely takes me to a place i didn't know i needed to be!!
this man has more talent than any modern rapper
love u voice ❤
your songs light up my heart, thank you!! I smile or cry but its all good.
This music is home!!! So much love ❤️ ❤️❤️
Keep it up bubba
Good God, this is amazing
Too much effort, but not enough. The audio is off with video in parts. And play the guitar in a forest. I don't need other clips or other angles. Be real, the anti-star, not the same...
I don't like the country music of today. most artists don't write their music and it sounds like pop rock . I can relate to Oliver though . he is down to earth and good hearted. Wishing you and your family the best and keep loving your shepherds . I have two shepherd's and i love them with all my heart and they give me so much more back.
My wife and I did a lot of miles hauling horses in our old 95 dually. She was hard starting in the winter, grumbled all day, and smoked like a chimney but always felt just like home. The truck was pretty nice too.
Just makes me smile!💯
Grouse song.
90 something Chevy. Not 90 some…. Just like trying to rhyme rich men with Richmond it makes no sense
If I never heard Rich men north of Richmond, this would be my favorite song by him
Ahhh. Good stuff. 🤘
I agree!
Zebco was my first grown up reel. As a 5/6 year old couldn't been prouder. Fished 100 hours or more on it
Great song brother. Much love and respect.
Another one for the playlist. God bless you my man.
Keep doin what your doing, your the voice of us working blue collar guys , that has been silenced by Main Stream propaganda. We need you brother!
Real music... Real Men... Real Life! Thank You...
Chris, what makes you way better than anyone else out right now is your REALNESS. Your voice is great. Your sound is great. I feel like your this generations Hank Sr. Just be you. Don’t let anyone change you. We all got your back.
Thank you Chris, you speak for so many of us!!! God Bless
DAMN IT... I have an 88
My man sings what every body is thinking! GREAT Song brother!
Keep on singing!
Good stuff, love ya Chris.
Chris, as a songwriter I know you are under a lot of pressure to come up with another song that is really good and not repetitive. It is not an easy thing to do. Don't concern yourself with being so prolific because people expect it. Just come up with the really good ones and nail them like you have been doing. I only live about an hour and 15 minutes from you so if you would ever like to collaborate on a few songs, let me know.
Sucesso Oliver Anthony!!!🙏🙏 Abraços do Brasil!!🇺🇸🤝🇧🇷
I really enjoy your music. Don't let the partisan talking heads change the message you are spreading. It is resonating with the people, and the mainstream powers (in music, politics, news) hate it. Keep up the great work.
I'm a concrete jungle🏙 city girl, inspired to head out to the nearest woods 🏕and drink a beer.🍺 I don't drink booze , I'll modify with synergy guava goddess🍾 kombacha😊. This tune sends me back in time to Hank Williams 🤠 love❤ this song. 🎵
I bet the Good Lord is having  a Chuckle at this Smutty Song , he's probably thinking let the Boy have some Fun , he deserves it. For those Americans Smutty in England means Naughty or Sex                      lol
I hope you realize that you're so good that you've made people like me actually like this kind of music. I don't even really like music but i love your voice and your sound..so soulful.
I live at a lake in California.  Last night, my wife caught a 22-pound catfish. I was hollering her praise and wondering if we had potatoes for chips. This beautiful woman told the fish, "It's okay, beautiful,  go home," and she turned it loose. Every day, she does things that prove she's better than I am, but she takes care of me like that old fish. This morning, I discovered this song and showed it to her.  As she moved closer, she said, and I quote, " I wouldn't be caught dead in a Chevy." She's a Dodge Ram girl. Great song , brother.
Me and my Love had 70 Some Chevy and lots of sweet memories
How do I get him out of my feed?
What life and love is....just beautifully simple.
Country music is trash, Oliver said “nah man, I’ll show ya.”
Never disappoints.
Well, this is novel in today’s climate. A heterosexual relationship theme. Good song. 👍
❤❤ ❤❤❤❤❤
Don't stop bringing this gold, Chris...
Great song!!!! ❤ GOD BLESS YOU Óliver
I keep hearing he is an over night success ,, only took 10+years never to late to make perfection! Way to go brother 👍
Can anybody ID the make of that truck pistol?
Wow 111k in 2hrs with no contract
Keep killing the game Chris!!!!
The UK rides with Oliver Anthony 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Hell yeah man! Loving the music and the video! This is what being County Strong 💪 is all about! Keep on killing it!
This man is AMAZING and definately not a #1 hit wonder.Such a gift to the world.I want to say Thankyou to you Mr.Oliver Anthony and God Bless! =)
His music isn't my thing but I do know a good artist when I see/hear one. I subscribe and like just to support him especially cuz I know he ain't signed to a label and I know all my clicks/$$$ is funneling straight to him, not some greedy label. Keep doing what you're doing man. 💪
When can we expect a release on Amazon music?
Wow Amazing! Chris, you are definitely ready for the Opry. You are the best thing I have heard in many a long years. Please tour and spread your music. You could easily fill up a stadium now. Much love and many blessings son, 💗Debbie, Southern Indiana
🔥🔥🔥 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
The music, the lyrics, the voice are so, so right. Thank you.
My favorite song so far even though everything he sings is amazing
🫶🏼 thank you for being actual authentic country music.
The voice for small town America and God-fearing folk all across the country 🙌
Chris your incredible! So much talent!!! Also enjoyed your joe rogan interview
Great work again bro
How does this MF keep getting better?
Farmville may not be the Blueridge or Appalachia but you definitely have some of the Crooked Road running through your veins.
Song writing. Ahhh it's good to hear a brilliant song writer sing. You have a gift sent from God brother. Keep being you.
Music that means  something  again  omg  I need more
I love his voice!
If this dude keeps it up , he might end up being our generations Johnny Cash .... minus the substance abuse .
Damn that man has some talent
thank you for being you !!!!
The handgun in the truck will trigger some, but who gives a rip?
If you're tired of listening to party rap "country" music, then Oliver Anthony's songs are for you.
MY GOD ❤ WE NEED A TRUE AMERICAN MAN JUST LIKE THIS.  BLESSED TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL, TRUTHFUL SOUL. SPEAK EASY, SING GENTLY FROM THE HEART. ❤️
Rebirth of real country music!!
National treasure.
Thank you! I miss Western North Carolina!!!!!!
Ohh, how can you not love his Music 🎶🎶🎶
Good grief, this is what happens when lightning strikes multiple times in the same spot - nothing is ever the same again.   Oliver Anthony Music is not a fluke, a flash in the pan, or a one hit wonder. This is better than we deserve. 👍🏾💯
Wow!  Your music fills my heart and warms my soul.  Thank you.
Oliver Anthony, your Grandpa Anthony is smiling from heaven, soooo proud of you 😊
Sweet brother! WNC fan!
I can relate to this as my 2005 Chevy is doing great with almost 300k
pls pls pls do long gone ❤
Chris may not be the most "technical" musician, but it doesn't matter!!!! He's got HEART AND SOUL to spare!  Much RESPECT
Appalachia is the same mountain range as the one in Scotland, strange how the ancestors of the Irish and Scots naturally moved here.
Country music has been a damn scam. No fucking reason a concert ticket should be $300 for some seats in the nose bleeds. Country stars are the absolute biggest sellouts.
I know you're pretty much anti-corporate music industry, but this could easily be a Rock and Roll anthem that Nuno Bettencourt could play the lead guitar to.
Hearing you loud and clear in the United Kingdom. Hearing everything you're saying. What's happening in the United States of America is happening in United Kingdom.God  bless you. we are behind you. and Love you. I hope you bring out a vinyl record one day. Because I'm sure going to buy it.
Mines an 89
so is this real country music?
Loved it!  Thank you for sharing your music with all of us.  ❤️🙏🏻
Sing it brother!!
Soul music sir! 🔥
Awesome songwriting and singing
Ah-mazing
BOW TIE all day long!  Great hit [sorry Dodge and Ford 🤣🤣🤣]
Dodge rams are entirely made in Mexico.
As trees lose their leaves yet stand tall hoping for better times, we the patriot people have received hope from your music and humble soul/spirit. We also will stand tall.
Thank you Chris for reading the bible on Joe Rogan. I don't know you but I'm proud of you for that. If you ever come to Tulsa I'll come watch and buy some merch. You got my support bud
Amazing! I can so relate. You Rock son! God bless
I'll tell you what, brother I've been hoping and praying for a change. Things just ain't right and we all know it. If all of us who've connected through your music can bring this country to a grinding halt, we can all go Woodstock Washington, and camp out until we see some changes. Idk, maybe I'm just a dreamer, God bless. W/♡ sister
This comment feeds the Anthony algorithm 🚀
"Virginia Is 4 Lovers, etc; ***MAGA3***"
this is real country like Coe, Old Hank, Waylon & Willie
Stay away from Nashville buddy. Keep doing what you’re doing.
You are the LIGHT for the young country lovers stuck with OLD SOULS WHO HAVE FELT LOST!
You're a clown
Another masterpiece from Chris. ❤😊
I wish I could triple thumbs up
The good lord has truly blessed you and I  thank you for taking us along .you Make music for simple folk like me to relate to and enjoy listening to .....keep them coming brother can't wait for the next one
As a smalltime musician and producer I can tell you this dude is doing more with a mic and a guitar in the woods than all these super star mainstream country artists that have huge studios and big money backing them.   CMT where you at?
I dont even like country music ...,...but got'damn we needed this .. ty for being you and keep being you..
COUNTRY MUSIC NEW ARTISTS OF THE YEAR GOES TO!!
This is a perfect example of why i don't like polished and pretty country music.  This shit is the real deal.  What do I know as a Yankee from Boston about country music anyway?
Very sweet…
You truly sing from the heart …. Blessings Brother 🔥❤️🙏🏻😎✌🏼
Oh! I want to be my husband’s 90 some Chevy!
Stay outta the hamster wheel,and just keep do'in it right!Northeast ontario here.bear season in full swing.
He is a great storyteller. I'm not a country fan, but the authenticity of his words and sound make me want to listen.
My guy just keeps putting the best music I have heard in a long time out. Love your music brother.
Just plain good music! Thankyou for being authentic and not selling out!
Love how you strip it down, so bare and pure.
The simplicity. This dude is different.
“Not a wheel turns, not a phone rings, not a light bulb shines without the kind permission of Working Class. Once this enormous power is mobilized no power on Earth can stop it!” - Ted Grant
awww
Love this man’s music
nice.
Keep going buddy… keep fucking going.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bro just stays writing hits
oh great.. more far right cringe we did not need
Great song. S funny was contemplating selling my 98 Chevy. Gonna hold on to her for now
Mighty fine song there ! Thank ya kindly! For such true lyrics !!!
Im proud of this young man theres a light at the end of tunnel for sure!!!keep making good music!!
Great song
Yay! Thank you Chris for picking this song to re-record!! 🎉
Can't wait for his album.  The guy can't write a bad song.  I'm really hoping for a new recording of VCR Kid
Can't wait for Poppy mountain
❤
Young man thank you for sharing your music. Y’all 25 years younger than me lol but take me back to my boyhood days.❤
Oh my  huge hit  coming !
Love you, Chris! So talented and authentic. Keep spreading joy through your music!❤
Things are going to be much better💖
Green Bay is waiting for you! Out at the yard I'll be riding on my lift, passing different warehouses. They're all playing your music! Come on with it brotha!
First time in the last 20 years I'm excited about a new band or musician releasing new songs 👏
Yeah, this is good music.
I hate country....I love this!
Such great lyrics!
See, this is country music.
Just a simple yet heavily-weighted thank you, Chris.
Good song I learned to drive in a 1952 Chevy pickup
Wow! I love this song 🎵 ❤️
The great ones make it look easy, you sir make it looks effortless!
One guitar, one voice, one take, one great song.
❤
Higher than gas. Amazing, this man is a national treasure and we need to protect him. The illuminati hates this guy
What a beautifully raw song i hope he can handle the fame
Johnny Cash would have loved you!
Counting the days till Oct. 7th to see you in concert.
Country Music is reborn.
They say a picture's worth 1000 words.  This song is worth 1000 feelings.
Just crushing it
Most "country" artists today are larping. This dude is the real deal.
Brilliant!!!
Perfect!!!
This man is on FIRE!!  Living the good life.
This is so PURE! The voice is so rich and authentic. There's nothing worse than that slick country crap. His lyrics are so clever and moving.
I don't like country... I bet this guy just ruined the careers of Morgan wallem, and them Sam Hunt type singers
Another banger
This is my favorite of his! I guess if she’s my Carter then I’m her Cash ❤
Hell ya! Love it!
Chris I know you know this is Krista from Tampa Florida watches women they don't try using you have lived in Florida 29 years but my family is in Virginia and thornsburg Fredericksburg thank you for your beautiful talent all my family went to Farmers market to see you I wish I could have went maybe next time beautiful blond in Florida
I thought I hated country music?
Amen Brothers Amen
SO happy that this one is recorded for real now! I've been listening to it on repeat since day one of Rich Men 😅
Its a breath of fresh air to hear real outlaw country instead of the pop country bullshit that's been shoved down our throats for years now. 🇺🇸
Damn it Son !!!!!!
Country before it went pop, which it was never meant to do. Bluegrass, even blues or motown. Can't figure out what style this is, but I love it!
Love it.
I love the "I guess if she's my Carter, then I'm her Cash" line! Keep it up Chris! ❤
I like your style....Keep the music coming ....Cheers :)
102k in 2hrs
Blake Sheldon take note... this is what real country is all about. I would love to hear this recorded in an old Voice-O-Graph recording booth.
thats true country music, thank you...  greetings from italy <3
Amazing 🔥
Love it !   His sound is perfect to me and this song so good I love it !
I started driving my dads 97 chevy z71 back in 03 and to this day , this truck has gotten me more women than anything 🤣🤣✌️
100k in 2 hours! 😎🇺🇸🙌
Just a guitar and his voice makes so much impact ❤
My favourite song of his by far
Love this one❤
God had given you all you needed but it was meant for this Time to Proclaim, as you are. The Truth. As God and Truth have always been One
Very glad to hear this one remade. It sounds amazing and the quality is well deserved. Thank you. Looking forward to whatever you release next.
Keep putting them out brother!
This song allows you to take a deep breath.
So when does the album coming out? I sure would like to keep this music.
Life
Man, I love your metaphors. Another great tune!
As a guy who thought he hated country for years i found it refreshing when i stummbled onto the more indie country scene. Glad this man sinsngs he has that old country voice that you dont hear much today. Dudes got heart as well
Now do 'Living in the New World' 👏👏👏👏
Good song
That's just BADASS!!
Nailed it boss!
In the early 90's hard rock with honest emotional lyrics destroyed  hair metal and it's boring sexist lyrics.  Oliver Anthony is going to do the same thing to country music.
This is the best song yet. So well written❤
We’ve all been waiting together for this man’s music. And we all have never met. I’ve never experienced this before.
Beautiful. Your voice sounds perfect to me. God bless you and keep you in your heart ❤
Another good one, thanks for the listen
AMAZING... WOW WOW WOWOWOWOOWOWOWOWOOWOWOWOWOOWOWOWOWOWOOWOW
Love his voice and word play in his songs!
Hellyeah
Fine as frog hair !
I don't listen to country music but I must say I do enjoy his music
Oliver Anthony is what America needs right now!! Truth and someone real
Excellent song. The more I hear this guy's stuff the more I like his music. Now watch him get chastised by some feminists in the mainstream media for comparing a woman to a car.  You know that nonsense is coming.
Why this guy is good?(Serious question)
Good song Chris
He's definitely not a one hit wonder.
I like a few different genres of music. I'm a musician and for most of my life I've been a Metalhead. LOL. But after hearing this guy I've been transformed :-) just something about his voice, the stories in the songs that he writes, and the way he plays. It's almost like he makes me feel like there's hope for man again
Love listening to you sing! Your music is awesome!! Thank you for being you and keeping it real!!
This my fav song
From Múnich-Germany 💪❤👍
🙏🙏🙏
Real country music has returned! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸✝️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Gotta get sober next?
A case of beer and a zebco".....that's from the heart and soul, folks. How many of you know what a zebco is, or even used one?
Homeboy getting that whole album ready 😎
I now know that Nashville has fallen. I miss this kind of music 🎶
Dude, you are THE BEST country singer I have EVER heard! Please stay true to your roots, your songs are amazing!
Hey Chris, I fully respect and support your desire to remain an independent artist but I think you could really use some older heads guiding you about your order of song release. You're a sweet dude and the soul of this song is sweet too but that chorus lyric is a bit raunchy for the masses. Not that you need to try an appeal to the masses--your authenticity is appreciated. But you have some good core messages to spread and you can spread those messages further if you keep everyone on board. Just keep turning to the Lord and you'll be fine, brother.
Thanks I needed that .
Good Lord brother, you don’t miss
Love my People THE JOHNNY CASH OF TODAY
So much better than corporate country. This guy lives it. The ass wipes in Nashville sing about farm life etc etc and most have never set foot on a farm let alone a tractor.
His music was sent to us right when we needed. The events of the exterior world will increasingly to try to steal our peace. These songs help to soothe us interiorly.
Blessings from Texas trooper. Loving the tunes.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hell yeah man, the quality here is perfect and still sounds alive like the others. Keep'em comin big dog
Sipping my cup of coffee, eating my breakfast listening to this masterpiece... anyone reading this, I hope you have a blessed life.. idk you but I care about y’all and I love y’all
Hey Chris, is your music considered part of a sub-genre of country music? How do I find more music like yours that isn’t modern country pop bullshit (what do I search for)?
this vid was posted 2 hours ago, just pulled it down from Apple Music. It's in my "A-rollin" playlist :D
Outstanding!  Beautiful!  Magnificent!  I just don't have enough words...  🙂
I turned this on and my six year old son came a runnin "did he release another song?" 😂😂 You and your music are loved by so many
Chris, you’re so talented. You deserve everything good that comes with your recognition and success! Bless you
Another instant classic
Good Music sippin on some whiskayyyyy 🍻
been there,done that with 57 ply, 383,but i didnt have to carry my 45,too old to fight!
Was hoping you'd do another recording of this one, Chris! I've been wearing the original one out!  OG is at https://youtu.be/WxkoyqmJelE?feature=shared for anyone who hasn't heard it yet. Love it!  What's next!?!? "Hell On Earth"?? OG as seen at https://youtu.be/a7IM5cDjyU0?feature=shared.
Thanks for sharing another amazing song Chris!
Oh man, we need a colab with Yelawolf 🤘
This video has little snips of truth, and reality. Like a memory, well done.
Could you please clear the air... Did you really say that you thought Joe Biden was doing a good job 😵‍💫
Damn he’s so good
Your Democrat ghost writer is writing you some 🔥 songs bro!!!
That's a slapper!  I love your music young sir.  Keep healing the world with your songs.
‘93 suburban with 312k on it and my wife and I celebrate 30 years in March. Love this song !
Another one!
Another one guaranteed to pop
I can honestly say, I've NEVER in my 5+ decades of life had an artist where I absolutely loved every single song they created. Thank you, Chris. 😍👌🙏
Great song, makes me wanna go back to Georgia to home...
This is a masterpiece.
Are we Seeing a change in the way country music is played in the main stream? If so I can get down with this not that pop style shit they have now days. This is MUSIC
I may have been one of the people who built that 90 some Chevy.
This song's lyrics and your singing are great! Mayne the best one I've heard from you. It reminds me of old country music it has soul and you feel ever word and note!
Great song!
Owen Benjamin is right.
Modern day, Song of Solomon.
Thanks for something that isn’t that tired old same four chords bro country garbage that can all be stitched together as the same song.
thank you for sharing sir
👍❤️🙏 I love the simplicity and natural settings of your music. Please stay pure and honest to yourself as you continue to bless us with your music. Serve God always and let God guide you through this journey. Blessings and love from Northern California. 🙏🇺🇸
YESS!! LOVE IT!! WAY TO GO CHRIS!! ANOTHER CHARMER!!
So proud this ol boy is from our neck of the woods. Glad to see his music is helping so many folks.
"She's my Carter, and I'm her Cash."
Been snging this one since first day I found u.  Said oh hell yeah.  I actually just asked my wife to marry me with this playing in the background
My neighbors will learn to love this song.
Brilliant, basic and stripped back, not over produced, wonderful, country music i would actually listen too, can't stand country music usually like Garth Brooks, hes overrated.
OBLIGATORY COMMEN TTO HELP THE ALGOS
👍thanks for sharing your talent, GOD speed!
THE MESSAGE FOR AMERICA September, 1984  Dimitru Duduman  Late one night, I could not sleep, The children were sleeping on the luggage.  My wife and daughter were crying, I went outside and walked around.  I didn't want them to see me cry.  I walked around the building, crying and saying, "God!  Why did you punish me?  Why did you bring me into this country?  I can't understand anybody.  If I try to ask anybody anything, all I hear is, "I don't know."  I stopped in front of the apartment and sat on a large rock.  Suddenly a bright light came toward me.  I jumped to my feet because it looked as if a car was coming directly at me, attempting to run me down!  I thought the Romanian Secret Police had tracked me to America, and now they were trying to kill me.  But it wasn't a car at all.  As the light approached, it surrounded me.  From the light I heard the same voice that I had heard so many times in prison.  He said "Dumitru, why are you so despaired?" I said, "Why did you punish me?  Why did you bring me to this country?  I have nowhere to lay my head down.  I can't understand anybody."  He said, "Dumitru, didn't I tell you I am here with you, also?  I brought you to this country because this country will burn."  I said, 'then why did you bring me here to burn?  Why didn't you let me die in my own country?  You should have let me die in jail in Romania!  He said, "Dumitru, have patience so I can tell you.  Get on this."  I got on something next to him.  I don't know what it was.  I also know that I was not asleep.  It was not a dream.  It was not a vision.  I was awake just as I am now.  He showed me all of California and said, "This is Sodom and Gomorrah!  All of this, in one day it will burn!  It's sin has reached the Holy One."  Then he took me to Las Vegas.  "This is Sodom and Gomorrah.  In one day it will burn."  Then he showed me the state of New York.  "Do you know what this is?" he asked.  I said, "No."  He said "This is New York.  This is Sodom and Gomorrah!  In one day it will burn."  Then he showed me all of Florida, "This is Florida." he said.   "This is Sodom and Gomorrah!  In one day it will burn."  Then he took me back home to the rock where we had begun.  "IN ONE DAY IT WILL BURN!   All of this I have shown you" - I said, "How will it burn?"  He said, "Remember what I am telling you, because you will go on television, on the radio and in churches.  You must yell with a loud voice.  Do not be afraid, because I will be with you."  I said, "How will I be able to go?  Who knows me here in America?  I don't know anybody here."  He said, "Don't worry yourself.  I will go before you.  I will do a lot of healing in the American churches and I will open the doors for you.  But do not say anything else besides what I tell you.  This country will burn!"  I said, "What will you do with the church?"  He said, "I want to save the church, but the churches have forsaken me."  I said, "How did they forsake you?"  He said, "The people praise themselves.  The honor that the people are supposed to give Jesus Christ, they take upon themselves.  In the churches there are divorces.  There is adultery in the churches.  There are homosexuals in the churches.  There is abortion in the churches and all other sins that are possible.  Because of all the sin, I have left some of the churches.  You must yell in a loud voice that they must put an end to their sinning.  They must turn toward the Lord.  The Lord never gets tired of forgiving.  They must draw close to the Lord, and live a clean life.  If they have sinned until now, they must put an end to it, and start a new life as the Bible tells them to live."  I said, "How will America burn?"  America is the most powerful country in this world.  Why did you bring us here to burn?  Why didn't you at least let us die where ALL the Dudumans have died?"  He said, "Remember this, Dumitru.  The Russian spies have discovered where the nuclear warehouses are in America.  When the Americans will think that it is peace and safety - from the middle of the country, some of the people will start fighting against the government.  The government will be busy with internal problems.  Then from the ocean, from Cuba, Nicaragua, Mexico,,.." (He told me two other countries, but I didn't remember what they were.) "...they will bomb the nuclear warehouses.  When they explode, America will burn!"  "What will you do with the Church of the Lord? How will you save the ones that will turn toward you?" I asked.  He said, "Tell them this: how I saved the three young ones from the furnace of fire, and how I saved Daniel in the lions den, is the same way I will save them."  The angel of the Lord also told me, "I have blessed this country because of the Jewish people who are in this country.  I have seven million Jews in this country, but they do not want to recognize the Lord.  They didn't want to thank God for the blessing they received in this country.  Israel doesn't want to recognize Jesus Christ.  They put their faith in the Jewish people in America.  But, when America burns, the Lord will raise China, Japan, and other nations to go against the Russians.  They will beat the Russians and push them all the way to the gates of Paris.  Over there they will make a treaty, and appoint the Russians as their leaders.  They will then unite against Israel.  When Israel realizes she does not have the strength of America behind her, she will be frightened.  That's when she will turn to the Messiah for deliverance.  That's when the Messiah will come.  Then, the church will meet Jesus in the air, and he will bring them back with Him to the Mount of Olives.  At that time, the battle of Armageddon will be fought."  When I heard all of this I said, "if you are truly the angel of the Lord, and everything you have told me is true, then all you have said must be written in the Bible."  He said, "Tell everyone to read from Jeremiah 51:8-15, Revelation chapter 18, and Zechariah chapter 14, where Christ fights against those who possess the earth.  After His victory," the angel said, "there will be one flock and one Shepherd.  There will be no need for light.  The Lamb of God will be the Light.  There will be no sickness, no tears, and no deaths.  There will only be eternal joy and God will be the ruler.  There will be only one language.  Only one song.  And no need for a translator!   ... And, Dumitru," he continued, "a word of warning.  If you keep anything from the American people that you are told, I will punish you severely." "How will I know that this is for real -that it will really happen?"  I asked.  "As a sign that I have spoken to you, tomorrow before you wake, I will send someone to bring you a bed, and at noon I will send you a car and a bucket of honey.  After which I will send someone to pay your rent."  The next day someone brought Dumitru a bed, and at noon a car arrived with the bucket of honey. His rent was also paid, as God had promised him.  (See chapter 10, "THROUGH THE FIRE WITHOUT BURNING.") Then the angel left.  Excepted from:  Dreams and Visions From God
Absolutely amazing song.

Obligatory comment of support.   Thanks for being you, sir.
84 square body   High country  3 pedals
You did it again. I have listened to a lot of your songs now and haven't hread a bad one. Keep it up and stay you brother.
The same way we name our rigs , why not have one for a song 😅😮🎉🎉🎉🎉
Can't wait for Aint gotta dollar, Doggonit, and Sober with  Mic...  They're all the best songs I've heard in ages.  Thank you!!!!
Cause of you Chris, I now have a YouTube playlist with JUST your music. Titled ‘MERCA ✊🏽🇺🇸
Your music is absolutely amazing. So soul stirring it just picks you up and takes you away.  Sweeps you down memory lane yet hopeful in the present. Keep doing what you're doing.
Love this guy
It’s been over a decade since I’ve listened to country music. Mostly because it’s 90% trash. But in the last year or so we’ve had a resurgence of artists who come from the right places, singing about real life shit, and aren’t just some Nashville pushed idiots.   Real shit. I’m glad this man has become popular the way he has. It’s pissed all the right people off, and for that I’m grateful.
not bad for a ginger...
Really enjoying the new versions with such great sound with real life backgrounds keeping it simple. Wishing you blessings and that good wife in the song and children to bring you joy.
Im from Scotland !never wanted to visit usa ! But hell i want to visit farmville now ! Love your music my friend !!!
I DO NOT LIKE country music, not in the least. But this dude is so amazing and puts tears in my eyes. Chris, Where the hell you been? Lolol Your an amazing artist. PLEASE be what another artists mom told him, stay a simple man, do this for me son if you can.  (You look like my youngest sons twin)
Man keep it up your music pulls on heart strings and is gut wrenching stay true to yourself
Wow!!!! You did it again. God has blessed you sir....and the world by raising you up
There's that Suburban he was talking about on Joe Rogan's podcast
Authentic....best word for this music ❣️
y’all i was done on this song pre full release he’s the best single artist and speaker for the country in this decade.
Most beautiful voice 😌
Your music is AWESOME Oliver. Absolute Hit. Reminds me so much of the "Lifesong's" written and sung by Tracy Chapman back in the 80's. I hope you can find a way to make a good living from your music and stay true to yourself, giving your spirit to others. There's got to be a lawyer who can protect you from the Rich Men North of Richmond. But, remember, a lot of the politicians are lawyers too. All The Best to you from another Country Boy
Phenomenal
❤
whoooo weeee reminds me of some of the fine women in my past. Just like riding that old '66 Harley, she fires right up vibrates quite a bit and runs a little bit hotter the further down the road you get. LOL  Thanks Chris for another great song, your taking people back to the roots of real country music.
🔥🔥
For the algorithm
Usually people lose their accents when they sing.
Diversity is our strength Oliver🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Which berg/ stein/ weisel set you up bwoy?
Ohhh..so country is just the blues with a twang…😬😂😍😍
Never added a song so quick to my playlist!
Perfect song for today! Thank you Chris! 🙏😁🥰🍻🇺🇸🐐🇨🇦\\\
A case of beer and a zebco. That may be one of the best lines I’ve ever heard. Everyone who knows what your talking about knows
This good old boy is somethin special
I came to the comment section afraid that the political tantrums the internet has been throwing about Chris's music would've ran rampant, but I'm happy to find that people here can see, feel, and accept the true importance behind his work: The simplicity.
HE’LL YEAH BORTHER ANT NOTHING LIKE A OBS CHEVY BEST ONES THEY ever made I tell you hwat LIBTARDS CAN DRIVE THEYRE PRIUSS ALL THEY WANT CAUSE AINT NOTHIN LIKE A 90 Something Chevy!!!!
It's Amazing How Our Lord Jesus can work with a lump of coal that we are. & turn us into diamonds.
No fake country here real as it gets Thanks Chris 🙏
I love being the darlin’ to my husband of 14 years. ❤

This is my favorite song of all Chris's music. It just hits right on an old dirt road on a Sunday afternoon.

Beautiful ❤ nature too ❤️🇺🇸 God 🙌 you, yours and the dogs. Follow your passion ❤️🕊
I absolutely love this man's music! I actually feel a bit guilty that I'm not able to pay him for it! This is real country music! Stay real and grounded! And let us pay you somehow for the beautiful so relatable music your giving us! 🎶
Love that rasp in your voice when you sing!  Another great song, keep them coming!
Stay Independent my guy. The industry can't touch this. Real music is rare and priceless nowadays.
Really love your music, brother. And thank you. Eric in Kissimmee Florida.
nice... simple... i want more please..
I CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THIS LEFTIST, INORGANIC, REPUBLICAN-SHILLED, JUST OKAY MUSICIAN. HOW ANNOYING!
Chris, find yourself a good God-fearing woman and make her your wife. Don’t let the groupies chase you down into the pits of hell.  ✝️🙏
You made a music video! Dude.... This is awesome! By the way, I bought the original recording of this song off to Amazon music two weeks ago. It is my favorite song of yours. I have a 93 Chevy Corvette, dogs and a good woman! This song is my anthem. Awesome man! Congratulations!
Killing it
Love it. Like that nice tent in the background too.
I’m so glad that you’re song rich men north of Richmond had such a controversial debut or so many people would have never found you. Keep up the great work and as long as you stay true to yourself you will not get lost. Much ❤️ and respect.
Wanna sell that Z71? I’ve got a ‘99 GMC K2500 the same color.
I love it!!
Love it!! God has definitely blessed you with an amazing talent!! You are such a word smith!!!! So glad you have decided to reach deep down an bring your amazing songs to life. I know I sure do appreciate them ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Keep writing. Look forward to your songs.
The amazing musician that we didn't even know we needed. Loving these songs Chris.
As much as I enjoy his music, I think he would benefit from collaborating with another  like-minded song writer.
Could this man be the new Woody Guthrie?
Hey Chris. Could you do a fund raiser for Maui. Maybe a concert to help the people?
❤️
Thank you for having the courage to use your God given talent, putting yourself out there and being an inspiration. You are so gifted, talented, and may you be blessed for giving that back. You are appreciated.
All praise to you and your family Chris, thanks for sharing your gift with the world. Sorry it took us so long to appreciate it.
And another great song ! Thank you for bringing real country music back
You don't miss
this is junk. try again fed.
Keep doin your thing brother! We love ya 👍
👏👏🔥🔥🫡😍🤩🙌🙌🙏 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲♥️🤍💙🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲

❤❤❤
Chris......... Man, I can't stop listening to your music. Excellent art my friend
Great song keep up 👆🏻 the good work
Hang in there Kid." A day is as 1000 years.
Praying for you hope god uses you for his kingdom brother
What I find most amazing about this song..... Only a 30 something would think a 90 something Chevy was a good chevy, heh.  Yeah I'm 60, lol.
What a breath of fresh air. Don’t change a thing . I certainly understand having the friend with You at those last couple shows, but that was a bit too much in the lead riff department, a little bit here and there would be fine . Just My humble thoughts. The way You do it Yourself is true perfection . 👍👍🇺🇸
Amazing. Thank you.
Thank you for listening to God's voice, and thank you for sharing yours with the rest of us
I'm not a country fan in any way shape or form, but this dude has some kinda talent making me a believer. Lyrics are straight from the heart.
Tk u !!!!! Thank u for give God the Glory!!! Keep it up !!! From Mississippi ❤
Zebco 33
I like that
That's another great song. Thanks for sharing!! How many dogs do you have?
It’s amazing that the sound of your voice puts my mind in a different place. New favorite.
👍🤘💪💪💪💪🤘🙏🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
I dunno. I like Olivers music but I been wondering. Is he actually country? Blue grass? Folk? Or maybe modern day blues? Perhaps he is all the above and more? Just a man strumming on a guitar singing about his own life. About as real as you get, regardless of what the music actually is. Keep it up Mr. Anthony.
Im your new hero, my msg is diversity is our strength, just give up amd go along to get along, trust me im just a normal guy that blew up on his own not an industry plant
This is that over the road music .. it will have you zoning out, your mind in a whole different world while you watch the road.
That was a Great Song!
Nothin like Country air
Life back to reality right there buddy!!
🤗✨✌️🌿🌈🎵🎶
Hollywood ,CMT and Nashville  It’s a fact we don’t need you!!!!
CMT has gone WOKE.....hope they go BROKE! Country music is back folks!!! This along with Texas Red Dirt genre gives me hope again!
I like this one the best so far. Keep em comin'.
Why are you worshipping this man who is playing in the woods today?  John 5:39, the Lord Jesus Christ speaking  "..Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life:  and they are they which testify of me.  40 And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.  41 I receive not honour from men.  42 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.  43 I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not:  if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.  44 How can ye believe,  which receive honour one of another, and  seek not the honour that cometh from God only?
Love the song.❤❤❤
I would love to see you do an acoustic song swap with another singer songwriter. Loving everything you’ve done so far.   Keep doing what feels right, Chris. Your heart knows the way.
Great song!! Missing the original "good old days! "
Dude is near 100k views in an hour...i hope hes working on building a nice comfy house on his property  with the ad cents hes getting. He owns the rights to everything in his music...no percents being handed out. Smart man. KEEP IT UP CHRIS!
Another good one. True Appalachian country. Keep 'em comin'! Never sell out!
He is so humble❤❤❤.....greatings from Serbia to you all🌹
a case of beer and a what??
Geat song!
The music indursty doesnt want talent.  They package untalented people to sell to the masses.  They sign talent like Mr. Lunsford here and keep them from recording because it hurts their investment in these talentless manufactured musicians and sets the bar too high
THANK GOD WE NOW HAVE WONDERFUL WONDERFUL COUNTRY MUSIC!! GOOD HEAVENS I REALLY GAVE UP ON THE COUNTRY,! CHRIS MY DEAR YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! SO SO GRATEFUL FOR YOU KEEP SINGING YOUR HEART OUT YOU ARE THE REAL DEAL!! In this new world we now have a new world HANK WILLAMS!!! LOVE THIS SONG MY GOODNESS LOVE EVERYTHING YOU DO!!!
Love it!
Bench seat leg rubber right here!
My dad used to sing Let the cork bob away my blues by Marshall Tucker band when I was knee high to a grasshopper. No instrument, just his vocals. This reminds me of that.
Damn... what a masterpiece! Keep doing your thing man!
A 90 something Chevy, dogs, frogs croaking, a case of beer, and a Zebco! You, brother, are MY PEOPLE❤❤❤
Wow that’s incredible
So awesome! HIS BEST SONG !!
This is the kind of country i love. Well done sir, always a pleasure to hear your thoughts.
Well, good thing she doesn't run like a '85 Renault ....
Oh my!!! I love it
Serious question, why do the YouTube videos sound better than the Spotify version?
Yes sir 💯
So refreshing to hear your music. Great getting to know your truth on Rogans show and hearing your story on how God is in your life❤.   Take care of yourself and Happy Labor day weekend everyone!😊
Comfortable, sweet, and mellow... and who wouldn't want to be there with somebody after working hard. Another gem Sir, thank you.
Was waiting for this song
Love the old soul in the voice!
Love Me Some You😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
GOTTDAMN !
It’s great to hear good country music again. Well done.✌️
Now that's a real, great country song!
The next Johnny Cash
I love Rich Men North of Richmond, but this song is now tied for the favorite ❤️
Thanks Chris, good to see you're putting up more songs with the "real microphone and camera!" You're greatly appreciated brother! You showed up for us at the right time. It's giving everyone a little hope that maybe we'll get out of this mess. Keep living in the hope of a better future. We need you!
This man is pure talent, touched by God! Love everything about him! His voice is amazing!!!!!
99 dodge 2500 Cummins. Just sayin. It talks loud.😉😆
This man is a f*"kin' Genius... So glad he is sharin' his God, his Soul...and  The coolest Vibe..... Keep em rockin'
You the man! Thanks Oliver for brightning our day!
This guy ain’t got one good song. He’s got a 90 Some Chevy full of them.
thank you Oliver.
You are such breath of fresh air, Chris. Stay close to the vine and you will be just fine! I am so happy you found peace in our Heavenly Father. I pray for you each night! God Bless You! Stay True to the Faith and your rewards will sure follow. Keep looking straight ahead, not to the right or the to left. That road is very narrow. LOVE coming your way from my heart to yours! Just remember: your desires are HIS desires when you follow HIM. They will go away when your stray! Happy Labor Day! Thank you for sharing your talent with the world!
He's pissing off some people lol. Did you see the shot of the pistol?
I love the fact that he redid it!
Dude!!! I mean, come on!!! You're killing me! Banging tune!!
Awesome well done Oliver

A Zebco is a fishing pole for all y’all who ain’t lucky enough to live this life 🎣 🐠
👏👏👏
I can't believe how much I like country music now.  Always loved R&B and pop music, but this just makes you feel good inside. Thank you Sir!
Never was much of a country fan, but this stuff I keep hearing from this guy really gets to me.
I have a print by thomas kinkade, it has a beautiful cabin and river and he put  snow white in it.
Brother. You are way too modest about your music. Your songs are amazing. Thank you for making them. I'm glad you're here with us sharing these feelings. We needed you, man. God bless you, sir.
And where did you get that car holster?
Thank you for being so humble and sharing your music with the world, and thank God for your amazing talent and that powerful voice of yours. You're changing lives, brother.
This dude is going to make a lot of money!
Now that you’ve re-recorded these songs, you’ve got to release them as an album!
So real and genuine, I hope he never changes his style
🙏Thank you for this one. Just beautiful! Much love 💚🇺🇲✌️
Do Hell on Earth too please.
Been wanting to ask....Did you go to a small Christian school in a small town 20 min south of Richmond....I believe you were in my nieces class.....also really love the music brother gets stuck in my head for days
Zebco, Carter & Cash. America. Keep being yourself Chris. You’re awesome and authentic > and you totally get it. Very cool to watch you fly dude!!

BANGER AFTER BANGER AFTER BANGER MY MAN!!!!
Still driving my farmer dad’s 95 Chevy pickup til I die. He was one of the greatest generation  that freed the world.  You are helping do the same now Chris.  Praying every day for you. 🙏🏽💚
Brother did you sell that truck yet?   I sure could use it
Chris 👏 👏 👏 take us back to the good old days.
About 6 months from now this guy is going to kick himself bevause he didnt take that 8 million dollar music contract.
What I love , is the TRUTH behind all his songs. We need more folks to wake up to this!
My new fishing song.
I think I like the original recording better. :)
Love the feel of this one!! Real country music!! Stay true to yourself & God Bless!!!
Fantastic! Keep ‘em coming 🤘🏻
Keep them coming Chis! Love them all.
Keep doing your thing brother! Loving these songs lately
Great song! And it didn't take 4 people to write it.
Preach on Chris! Can't wait to see what you have in store for us in the future. Biz from France
BEAUTIFUL!!!! 🥰😁
Another good song I hear you Oliver
Who the heck thinks a 90's Chevy is a good truck? He clearly hates this woma'am.
Dang!!!!
Once again, amazing
Country is the new soul.
Your voice is just amazing
Great song
Awesome ! Only thing better is if he had a 90ish Chevy in the video. Anyone would have loaned him one. Keep it up. Stay grounded.
Amazing
It seems every song he puts out hits the heart and mind of what real people were already thinking and feeling.  He may not think he's amazing, but we do! Thank you!!
Beautiful brother. Keep bringing that good ole music. Love it.
Your voice reminds me of bocephus ❤
I guess 90 Some GMC doesn't quite have the same ring to it....
Just got that classic feel every blessed time😘 👏👏👏 ❤
East Tennessee USA 🇺🇸 ♥️ 🌿🙏  Keeeeeeeeep SINGING 🎶🎵
The world needed *real* humanity ... well Sir, 🙏 Chris, you've given it to us! Thank you
Almost 90k views an hour :)
1 hour after posing, and he’s on his way to 100k views😂🎉🎉🎉great song.
This dude is the real deal
No finger snaps , claps, or rap.   Refreshing
Another fire ass song Chris. 👊🏻
Bro... you and Ren have breathed new life into music for me!!
Thank you Chris! I've been hoping you would put this one up next. This might be my favorite of yours but it's hard to choose lol.
This man music is amazing. Heartfelt ..would love to buy his cd
Perfection
Sent to my Daddy who loves your music and has a 94 chevy. Y’all call your daddy today!
Oliver Anthony is proof it takes one song to change your life forever congratulations Oliver Anthony you deserve it your music touches souls and you have an old soul sound which is what music needs
EVERY. DAMN. SONG. IS. A. BANGER.
This is exactly what a song and a video should be. Just perfect! Please never change!
Every time I click on a new song I’m nervous. There’s got to be a bust someday.. once again you knock it out the park!! You on fire bro keep ‘em coming 🍾🍾🍾
Can you imagine this Chris and Stapleton did a duet together 🤯🔥
I used to think that the worst part about Oliver Anthony was that he was likely a one-time, flash in the pan phenomenon. Man it's good to see that he's got another hit just as good as the first, less than a month after he hit big time.  Also, I really want to know what make/model that pistol was. It looks old school badass and now I want one. Been on a hammer fired binge lately. Sick of polymer space pistols.
Well done!
Your one hell of a song writer.  Stay well protected of your songs.  Wonderful. So glad your here to escape and add some joy to the day!
I do not listen to the country genre at all, but i can not get enough of Oliver Anthony's music.   True country music in my opinion.  KEEP SINGING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY LIVING LIFE
For the beginning, I thought he was so unique, soulful and genuine. With the massive success of Rich men North of Richmond, I see Chris going very far.  ❤❤❤
I like the bones from the original recording better. Either way A great song by A great dude.
Someone finally knows how I feel.
That was a 90 some GMC though
Oh my gosh! You did it again! Your music,every song is amazing! WOW!
may all those who seek God be blessed including you reading this, you will never hunger again, i love you, God loves you, love thy neighbour as thy self ♥️ 🖤
2000 comments with 80k views is crazy
Keep it up!!!
women loved to be compared to cars...................thats why the junk yards are full of rusty old cars  i mean bars  sorry
Another great song. 👍🏻
I blast  Chris' music every day, since finding him❤. So refreshing....real music....needed so bad. Realness....authenticity....God bless this young  man....many blessings to you Chris.  🙏 The Lord has quite a calling on your life.....good job faithful servant... the vessel you have become is nothing short of one of God's miracles.  .  Another beautiful song.  Thank you brother..we love you.❤
Everything he puts out is a hit glad he turned that deal down he do better doing the way he does god bless you
Best date in the world is when the radio is playing in the cab, but you're in the back of the truck bed, firelight from the bonfire and making out so long your eyes are sleepy, your lips are swollen and you're debating on whether or not to go all the way 😘.....sigh my favorite thing ever and this song would definitely be playing ❤
My man here is a hit maker
Your songs are so good man. Please keep it real and true.
Out of nowhere. Incredible! Chris you have single-handedly elevated a music genre, storytelling and a sense of community. Bravo young man. 👏

Thank you chris for making music we can relate to so deeply!  Your an awesome person and i highly respect your getting sober for yourself, ( ive been dry 6 years), and singing about your feelings which are feelings we all have to some degree.  I wish you well and hope you remain independent so we can HEAR all your music!  Thank you hon!  ❤❤
Go... Oliver!! 🙂
Awesome. Imagine this song set to a good drummer, a picker and steel. Come on brother…
Great song prefer the other version though.
Just trying to figure out how you fit on a bed in a 27' trailer now, you must have to sleep diagonally on it? 🤣🤣🤣  Great stuff man, keep it all coming, don't bend your will for anyone.
This is real God family and country is what America was founded on!
I love your music. You have a heart and soul in it❣️ Don’t change bc we need more like you stepping on out!!! 🙏🏼👏🏼🙏🏼
Takes me back to a simpler time in my life.  Only thing that's missing is how after a few beers you forget that your being eaten alive by the mosquitoes.
Ah, my ‘94 K5 Blazer with 204K miles, pulling my 69 Camaro to an out of state for a cruise night.
Another burner…!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Great to see a little more put into the production. Keep it up! don't change.
The man don’t miss

Christopher, you sound so much like some boys from Jacksonville FLA that I listen to growing up, thank's man for the memories
Keep em coming man . Great stuff. This just made my afternoon
Speechless he's so good
Chris your music is awesome! Keep on writing! It's that great because it just gives you the right feelings and you sing from the heart. Some true song. Not songs just to be able to be on the top 100 chart. But the quality is so good that it will make it there. Im happy to see your music is helping u get back on track! Stay who you are!
Damn, I really resonate with every song.  Keep um coming.
Keep it coming, Chris. We'll be listening.
This is my favorite Oliver Anthony song , so far !👌✌👍 edit - Brilliant Song !
By Gawd we have a poet right there
With all the money and fame you must be up to your neck in Appalachian poon by now.
Sei un grande Chris-Oliver.Ogni tua canzone mi fa emozionare.Che Dio ti dia la forza di fare la differenza.
God Bless Everyone
Damnnnnnnnnnn that’s the shit 🔥
Another BANGER!

Whatever "IT" is, this dude has IT. natural talent and song writing.
Ford 302💪
I love it Chris!
What a fresh breath of air, I'm totally in love, I was born in the 60's all the men in my family played guitars and sang. You literally take me back to my childhood .My daddy was on the radio singing muddy waters,I'd loved to hear you sing it ❤love ya, kid may God continue to bless you ❤
Just absolutely amazing love it keep them coming and be safe GodBless 🙏🙏❤️❤️
Just a man, guitar, and millions of people tired of all the glitz and glam, broken promises and auto tune.....
Love it, keep em coming!
Nice to hear actual country music and not the shit last 20 years
just beautiful ❤
Anybody feels a link with traditional Greek music using bouzouki?
🤘🇺🇸🤘 incredible. God bless America. God bless Christopher and his Misses. 🥃
A Chevy man to, well , shit man your alright man!
I am proud, straight  white trash . 😊.
Prepare for a sale spike on them 90's Chevy Trucks on the  facebook market place.
Oliver (Chris) Anthony is the real deal, as authentic as authentic can be.    He provides the contrast we all needed to what has become fake as fake can be in what is sold as country music today.    Bring us more, Chris.  Bring us everything you got.  We can’t get enough of your authentic self and your music!

Nice 👍. I've got a 95 with 385k. Still dive it for work regularly. Part of me will go when it finally does. Truck has been better to me than most friends and family have.
I am so damn happy this dude exists. I am extremely happy for him too. He deserves everything.
What a true good ole boy artist  Love it brother
Love this guy
Beautiful brother.
The red-bearded Janis Joplin❤❤❤❤ sound of your voice is just so unique
Sounds good, like home.❤
Truthfully,it's ok
Now, if you are going to describe your "Honey" to a truck, that is how you do it. Nice one, Chris.
Please do payments next. I think it's a lyrical masterpiece.
Mr Lunsford, a '90 some Chevy is still a new car to me....a shame what Cash for Clunkers did...........For my age I would be singing about a late 60's Mopar , or Chevy or Ford, etc but the '90 Chevy is good too...... I Like your Style alot !!!!!!!!!!
❤❤❤😊
Such a pure, masculine and country voice. Love it!
Ill put your music on replay as long as you stay genuine
Love from Germany
Love from Germany
You men and myself are on our way to get our woman closer and dance to this song away into the back-seat,..or backroad and see what rmp limit she's got 😅..that redline type action 😂
Your music is like a breath of fresh air brother, keep on
Love me some Chevy!
Can't wait to hear people complain that there was a quick shot of a pistol in the video... Just wait..
This guy is so good, he is better than anyone else. We need more like him.
Country artists today own mansion's and drive Mercedes and will never be  country like this Oliver Anthony is. A true artist.
Who would have guessed a super star from FarmVille va. Not me ! - Longwood alum here hahaha good on ya bro.
Wow!! Don't know if it's the new microphone, but the sound of your voice is just AMAZING! Pure & simple. A pleasure to listen to  💯💯💯
I came to listen to your music again...and heres another one! You've knocked it out of the park Chris! Love it!
This is so good. You know they want to take the 350s away from us.
I believe this song will be more divisive than Rich Men... 😂 I'm a Ford man... I'm offended.  But for real good tune as always brother!
You take your 94 Cheyanne with a topper on it , place a blowup mattress in it and go to th e  drive in movies . 😀
God bless a Chevy....
Thank you to his amazing production team for helping him step his quality up this sounds and looks amazing, bringing out the best of our boy!!!!!
Chris is making the country music that needs to be made.  Most of the modern stuff is unrecognizable from the country music I grew up with.
I thought he was left handed?🤔
Yep.. 🥰
In a purely Christlike way I truly love and appreciate you Chris. God Bless!!
This new song is straight up FIRE! Love the video! Chris is a National Treasure!
Awesome video, brother. God bless you, Sir
Chris you are such an inspiration to so many around the Country ! Keep your light shining , hold tight to your Faith in Jesus and keep plucking that guitar . Much blessings
Oliver Anthony is the Real Deal. Keep up being you.❤
Got me a 92 some chevy truck! Great song
My 5 yr old son loves his music. Says daddy put on my favorite music when we get in the car.
🥰💯💜
BEAUTIFUL ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Go run Flag Pole Knob in that Chevy.
I never was a Country type of man but I really like your music. Not sure if it's a god given gift or just raw talent but your music always hits me just right, so full of heart and love, something rare these days
This guy has an "old soul".  Love his music/poetry.
This young Man seems to have discovered his "God given talent". Some real opportunities only come once in a lifetime.
This is how music is supposed to be.
Soothing music for the soul
Great Song Chris 👍🙏
Can you believe how good this video is? The chord progression in this song makes me tear up every time.
What more could you ask for… one dude and his guitar singing true words 👍 keep being you sir
Damn that's some good music.
Man we need a collaboration with Colter Wall, like seriously 👍✌👊
Sir are you pro-American or a democrat as the media now claims?
Hi from South Africa
You have taken music back to the good old days of singing the truth of life, good and the bad! Lovin' your words from Sydney Australia and can't wait for what's to come! ❤
That's natures mansion right behind him.
Wonderful 👏🏼
He really knows how we all feel! Thanks for taking the big leap of faith to spread your music! I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of your journey! Keep going!!
90 something GMC doesn't have the same ring
It doesn't get any more real than this!  Thank you.
This RIGHT HERE is backwoods country music ITS BEAUTIFUL
Never thought being compared to a ol chevy could make me blush.
I hope this dude makes millions!
This makes me remember my first new bought vehicle, A 93 Chevy S-10 5 speed manual. loved that little truck. This was back in the 90,s when life was good. Had a decent paying Union Job making a REAL Man's Wages. Then Shit hit the fan around 2000. started seeing them Crating up some of the factory machines. They were being shipped off to China. Now That Good paying Union job is gone, That factory is gone, they even tore the building down. and all we have left is "BULLSHIT WAGES" and LONG Overtime Hours in this country. This is NOT the America of our Parents generation.
Great song man 💙
I hate rap now and love country 🎉 I said it first
Real stuff going on here 👍
Remember when one of the biggest dividing issues in this country was Ford vs Chevy. We all want those good days back. Whatever the politics I am glad this guy was discovered, love his music its what I listen too normally.
76,000 in one hour! Come on baby, music just got its soul back 😇😇😇
great voice
My taste, smell, touch and hearing are enhanced by every word, the song is a living picture  !!
More heartfelt, thanks for sharing.
God bless this man!
Should a lovesome song
Keep um coming chris, people are hungry for your music brother
I'm suddenly a country fan.
👍
You will never disappoint 🙏
His music has character, heart, and soul.  Most commercially produced music today is worthless junk, over played and exploited.  His music reminds me of the singer-songwriters of the 1960's-70's, when people spoke and sang stuff that mattered.
Every drop is rich and raw and passionate!  Someone very special has arrived  God bless you mate 😢😢👍🏻👍🏻😎
❤️
You know an Artist has talent when he could sing the Dictionary and you'd enjoy it. Another great song Brother. Godspeed
Love
Here before 1 million 🎉
This perfectly describes my me and my ol lady! Simple life just aint so simple no more. But! A drive in my old truck makes it all alright. Keep bringing on the new classics brother!
Gingers ate not to be trusted 😎
🔥🔥🔥🔥
He's right, no sweeter sounding engine than a 350 Chevy
NICE. 2A4EVER
Looks like this man is not a one hit wonder after all! Good stuff! 🙂
I hope he does I've got to get sober with the new set up next! This is great
He doesn’t miss, Geezus
Damn well done sir
Nice.
He sings like the country singers of old, but about living in today's world. 👏👏👏
Man's got himself a new pickup. Fuck yeah.
Good one :)
It's like the hills are singing a sirens call. Simple life manifest.
God Bless you Chris!! Keep creating and bless us with your talent!!
Your voice makes me just sit with my eyes clothed and enjoy. I was a fan before Joe Rogan, but what you did with your Bible on his show made me your number one fan!
Thank you
Bravo 👏🏻 🙌
Thank you for not using Nashville studio musicians , producers , engineers, etc.  Pure country without the cookie cutter sound they have pushed on us for the last 25 years.
We have an eighties Toyota.  That motor just keeps on ticking.
aah come on dude, leave some space in that top 10 for others will you 😂
Man I’m enjoying these songs. You’re great brother
💜
Oliver just doesn't miss!
NICE 😎🤠🇺🇲💪👍🔥
I’m so happy for you Chris, your music speaks to so many working class folk. Good head on your shoulders and a kind soul. Perhaps your music and voice is a conduit for the powers above. ✌️
You know his style, his voice, his genuineness is just fantastic, but what really stands out is his song writing. Just hits you in the bullseye.
Fire!!! 🔥🔥
No teeth whitening strips, no hair gel, no personal trainers, no ProTools, no Photoshop, no consultants. Just… him. I love this guy.
That mic is sounding great man!!!!! LOVE the touch of reverb on your voice!!!
YEEEEEEEEEEFKNHAAAAAAW!🇺🇸🦅👊✊✌️💪👍🤘
Heavan voice
Buddy is on my list beside Randy Travis and garth brooks.
Thank Gawd for Real Country !!! Love it
Let's see the lady Chris! Good that you've got someone to keep your feet on the ground and the fire burning. Keep on treating us to these  lovely songs...
❤❤FJB❤❤
Another excellent country song.  Well done Oliver!  Looks like the video production values have stepped up a notch.  Good looking video.
Play this song at 1.25x speed
Great song! I was wondering if it was coming out after seeing you sing it at that live show recently.  Congrats on another banger Chris!
Love it💗
This is a great song!
You must release your album on 180 gram vinyl !!! ❤
I think the good lord sent him for every broken spirit
Wow. This man knows how to sing the basics of life of so many of us. Even those that have found themselves stuck in suburbia and few in a city. We didn't start there but,.. found ourselves there somehow. Some of us still hold onto those treasures and head out just like this man describes. Blessings. Mr. Anthony,.. you're dropping pearls from heaven good sir. Thank you so much for sharing your music, lyrics, culture, humanity and Lord's word.
This puts a smile on my face, and a brings a tear to my eyes. 🥲Lordy, I sure miss my husband. He had the right key to turn over this ol engine.😅   Thank you for giving us music that means so much.❤  Continued blessings, young man!
Oliver seems like a great guy. Love everything about him and his music. The fact that he chose to include his “good boys” in the video is the icing on the cake
That was beautiful! ❤😊
I like the other version of this song thos one's to slow
Case of beer and a Zebco. Too 😎 cool.
Have a Happy and safe labor day weekend and keep on enjoying that new found stardom enjoy every minute of it its your turn ENJOY
Dude, I don’t know how you do it but you touch the human soul so easily. I’m a grown ass man with kids and your music brings tears out.
Yep!
Ohh ayyyye!
I love his voice!! Love this song!!!
Hell yeah brother!
Chris, thank you so much for pushing yourself to get your music out. I cannot tell you how it touches my heart and soul. ♥️✨🙏🏼 Your music is bringing us together and that is such a beautiful blessing. 🌎 I’m really starting to realize that there are a lot more of us that think the same, feel the same, even though “they” let us to believe we are separate, we’re not, we are all ONE! Sending you my best, hope you are feeling good and not too overwhelmed by all of this. Please keep sharing. Be blessed ♥️ #United #loveistheanswer
Real Country Music!! Glad to see it's making a comeback.💓🎶
Love song to dogs?
On a quite night in central PA you can hear a Chevy rust...
Well done sir
Great work!

Another winner! Thanks for sharing.
I have been singing this song all week at work
Thank you for sharing your music with the world, Brother
Pure, Raw Talent.  Talent that hasn't been seen in a while. He has something to say all the time and it all makes sense to the majority. Very relatable music. Keep going man!
Oh man! This is so good!
Amazing
I won't say your the voice of the people but damn your songs hit everyone just right.
Ford owners: My wife's boyfriend would love this song!
🎣🐕💛🐕🙌🐕💛🎣 Sweet! a legend is born😎🔥

Awesome!  Thank you Sir, shared.
Nice song Chris, thanks and take care old man.
All time favorite love from SL
I really like this song!!! Did ur thang once again brother!! 🤝💯
After discovering Oliver Anthony (Chris) he is now my favorite music artist and it  has been an incredible journey. Not only is his music exceptional, but Chris’s character and values shine through. He uses his platform to inspire change and spread positivity, making them truly remarkable. It resonates with us all on such a deep level. Remarkable!!!
70K views 1 hour after posting. I'm so happy for you dawg.
God I love this music can’t wait for all the other songs to get this treatment
👏
Sounds even more racist at 1.75 speed.

Wow I love your lyrics! Awesome song just Wow much love from Florida
This simple man is full of wisdom... genius...
This is my new favorite man. What a good song. And thank God you didn't use Ford. Lol joking.
I  would imagine the good Lord driving down a dirt road listening to this song in his 350 chevy and smiling ear to ear ... good stuff Oliver !
Love it!
Freaking nailed it! Awesome man
Thanks for bringing back the basics of life Chris. You bring me back to the good old days.
This blue collar girl loves this song. Reminds me of my sweet husband and I.❤
On a quiet night in Ghent, Kentucky, you can see the beautiful stars in the sky, hear the crickets chirping, the frogs croaking and the Chevy's rusting as your Ford Truck stands guard over the barn. Ha ha. Great Song brother!
Good stuff Chris
Thank you brother
Very good.  Just stay away from the media the will try to destroy you

During this BS going on in this country right now... This man has given me hope more than I've had in quite awhile!!! Bless your heart and soul my brother!!! ❤❤❤
She’s hotter than hell and I’m higher than gas😂👍
I grew up with musicians around the kitchen table, and some of the best music was played there. Your music reminds me of that, and it feels like home. Thank you, and God bless you
Amazing! What a talent! Keep it up Oliver!
I don't understand him saying he wasn't a good musician  he's playing  great music with out digital help with a really old style guitar that sounds awesome.  Maybe I'm little partial it's the same style my grandpa played in Fries.
Keep 'em comin' Chris.  The whole world is loving your songs ! Side note:  wonder how many people will be lookin up what a Zebco is ?  🤣         ✝️🙏🇺🇸
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏!
I never thought I’d ever hear something original again in country music, you’re a breath of fresh air.
keep it up man! love every song!
Another fantastic tune! Well done, brother! God bless!
I had a 96 Silverado so butthole stole it
He needs to do a duet with Ashton Shepherd. Shes as country as he is.
The music isnt synced to the video.
Another awesome song!!
Oliver is now my favorite! Love your heartfelt music and the way you tell a story 💕💕💕💕
Stop with the phoney southern accent. signed TENNESSEE
Thank you so much for another one! Been following along closely! Can’t wait to see more of your songs!!
His Songs are a bit short but i'm happy every second
every song a story, every note played and sung a callback to the days of real country mountain music. PROTECT THIS MAN IN ALL OF HIS DAYS HERE ON THIS EARTH
Repent America 🇺🇸 Repent! If People can be programmed and Mind controlled to vote for a Dumb Idiot like Biden and Fetterman, it means DARKNESS  Reigns over and RIGHTEOUS  are Not in Control of the Church and the Land....The Victory always begins in the Spiritual realm...The Church in America is the one to be Held responsible....  Samuel Machado, Warrior in Christ from the Land of Satan, India
I love this song!
Proof that gingers do have a soul..
I GUESS WE KNOW WHOS GONNA FILL THIER SHOES, WHOS GONNS STAND THAT TALL
Love your voice and style of music.  You mentioned you were not trained on Joe Rogan and that is what everyone loves.  You are real!
My sons just asked if I was listening to “the band” I said no but that’s a hell of a compliment !!! Great stuff keep it coming 👍
Man is making great music
Just finished the Rogan interview and I agree with him whole heartedly. Tell the record companies to F off and keep doing you. You’ll do fine. Love the new song!
The lyrics are really cool.  What's that thing in the background? A tent? You live on some nice land I grew up in the Rocky Mountains and miss it. Get your self a few horses for that land A couple of donkeys?  Love the film footage like the creek and your dog's swimming. The woods are doing you some good coming up with these great songs
This guy is incredible keep em coming Chris great song!
Love the sound of your voice, love your lyrics and last but not least, love your dogs! Thank you for sharing your gifts!
Dude! You got to preach our Lord on JRE! I have been praying for Joe for over ten years! And there you show up. We serve the greatest King, I love you and your heart brother. Stand strong, if your ever in SW Florida I have a cup of coffee waiting for you.
Awesome
Another Great one Sir. Please keep them coming, I was/am stuck in the 60's for music, but I'm going to make a change to Bluegrass/Country.
Thank you another great song.
MAKING US VIRGINIAS PROUD
Outstanding, really enjoyed that, I've had some of your music in in my car, and people have stopped next to me to ask what I'm listening to, your sound is so raw and full of soul, you can't be it.
masterpiece!
She’s a beauty 😍
He’s blessing our ears!!! Thank you!!!
Your such a blessing to my soul. I really wish GOD would make us cross trails an meet in this old, new world brother. I've been bending strings and unfortunately cutting heads on this old guitar for many years. I've never felt a calling in life to play like I feel when I hear what GOD is saying through you. If you ever get short handed and need a GOD fearing man to back you up ,I would jump in that old truck an cross that  Tennessee line to head to ya  in a hurry. I know it's a long shot but just know I would be there. I always played music with my brother that went to Heaven a few years ago and since layed that dream down in my heart. I would pick it up again if you need me cuz i know he would be quite disappointed if i didn't and I believe in what your doing and for some reason feel like you could use another GOD fearing man around.❤ Finish that race Chris, you got this man. OUR FATHER would never put no more upon you than you can handle.🤜🤛💪🙏❤
Unfortunate. I’ll be unsubscribing now. Materialism and the pornification of women continue. No Christian should listen to this. Scripture is explicitly against this kind of talk. Let your modesty be known to all men.
This is real.  Real good, real life, real heart, real soul, real feeling, really beautiful.  Thank you❤
Keep on driving, brother.
Your songs remind of a great one from Hank Jr. The Blues Man.  Keep up the good work. And after watching your videos and interview with Joe Rogen I’m I don’t have to ask you to stay humble. 👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸
This dude just proves we've all been ripped off by "Country Music" for the last 25yrs. A man with a guitar, in the woods, singing about everyday stuff that everyday dudes can relate to.  You're 100x more country, authentic and relatable, than ANYTHING out of Trashville, TN.  Thank you for turning down the $contracts$. 🙏  Stay grounded brother. 🙏
It’s simple. Just good music.
Man. That's a good song!
Never sell out Oliver because we got yah !!! Sixty year old Canadian and still got my ninety something Chevy and you're hittin my strings !!! Love it!!!  Huge respect from up North !!!
Another "winner." TY Chris
Like a bell skipping across calm water. Grounding soothing Feel, when all other stuff  seams troubled and hopeless then I hear this tune and lyrics ,two bars in its all a little better now, a few more listens  and I'll feel calm for awhile. Thanks Chris you say you ain't a very good artist , what evev dude we need real truthful humble old souls like you , that aren't perfect and know it and not troubled by that.
👏👏👏
I'm now a country music fan thanks to you!
THANK YOU
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I like me some vintage fords... but I must admit, this song alone almost made a covert out of me, almost...
A good feeling, love your woman song❣️  Every song you make is awesome! 😊❤🙏
Liked this one a lot - I like this version too. Keep up the great work!
You remind me of my Jeep remix
I have my dad's old 91 chevy pickup. It has a nice rumble.
GMC   GOD'S MAGICAL  CHERIOT!!!
🎯🔥♥️
Lots of people are going to lose their minds over that 1 second gun clip
listen to this song/video at 1.5 speed, sounds just as good as regular speed 👍
Fate Makes No Mistakes Chris, You are EXACTLY where you should be TOP of the charts…God Bless You My Friend❤
I can't wait for some idiot to autotune and quantize his music put some stupid beat on it, and rap over top it, and call it theirs.
You Keep on changing the world with every song
I'm 45 and cynical af. when you think it's all been done this man writes a perfect country song ! wow !  got to see a bit of the process and still blown away. this is gonna be #1 on the charts by the end of the week.
This is a real love song. His feelings are so raw, gives the listeners chills. I love it
❤❤❤ My favorite Song bro 😎
✌️👍😎😎
Chesterfield Virginia here. This is my favorite song man!
These songs just get better and better, keep doing what you do Chris and don't change for anyone.
Love it!
C'est important pour le référencement
Just Simple and Authentic, and That's why we love him.
Glad he re-recorded this one. It's my favorite
I wish I could put into words what your music has done for me. It's amazing to feel connected to your fellow man through song.
I like this song… but I really LOVED the other version.
Why does all his song slap hard af
A real artist, deserves all the praise, thank you Oliver Anthony for being an amazing musician 🙌

First note...chills all over! You are an incredible human and a good man. Thank you for being here in my lifetime. It's like watching an Elvis being made...only you are the REALEST!
I guess 90 sumthin GMC didn’t sound as good!
I love that this in not my genre but still enjoy the hello out of it!
You are awesome   Great human integrity  Great music  ❤❤❤ Xxx🎉
I enjoy his voice and the simplicity. Good stuff.
Nice

Protect this man at all costs!!! 💯🫡
Great song! Love the look around
Well done, country music at its finest. You are a gift, sir. thank you for blessing us all.
This guy is incredible. What a talent!
Great song.
So glad to be along for the ride, where is he channeling this music from? Seems otherworldly.
Nice
Another awesome song. Thanks for it buddy.
Please re-record Doggon it!
I love 90 something chevy too. I have a 97 off road blazer.
Bravo…..Praise the Lord.
Philippians 4:8-, Jesus Christ our Lord.  King James Version 8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. 9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.       (It's not about man-made wisdom, training our mind to be in step with the word of GOD, JESUS CHRIST our LORD. CHRIST is a true, pure, lovely, good report, virtue, and praise to CHRIST alone. )
Another badass song from the legend! Keep em comin. God bless from Texas!
🔥
I dont think iv ever heard so much talent before
Nice yurt 🛖 where you get something like that?
Please make the next song about my 2007 Certified Pre-owned Toyota Prius hehehe
love it.
You are overexposing yourself and oversaturating the audience. Take a step back, otherwise the attention and the pressure may very well maul you psychologically.
If asked, I know i was not. But still I would say this is just missing a reason to value his girlfriend. A connection that ties them. His previous songs I heard gave enough to connect us with his song messages.       He talks of wanting to be a good person. I am putting it out into the world that substance matters and framing a song of love have an impact on consciousness and society.     I never wrote this idea before or even thought it was worth it.  Perhaps his previous songs struck me so hard that his songs and his verbal communication he has spoken on are needed in our country and need moral values. Females and males need to be reminded of what to value in our partners.
Love love love! And I absolutely love "I've got to get sober"...please do that song soon🙏🎶
Chris, when is the album coming out????
Total respect from Canada
This reminds me of what music use to be.   Real.
Even though he trashed us conservatives and was very ungrateful to us, I still like his music and will follow him. Keep singing man!
❤
Thank you Chris💕🇺🇸
Your voice 🫠🥰 keep on keepin on 🙌❤️
I'm a ford guy . Lol chevy 350  sound like crap to me lol    Good song none the less
Something only these old country boys can understand! Except I was always a Ford guy.😁 ✌🏻❤️🇺🇸🙏🏻
Every so often somebody comes along, strips off all of the old coats of paint and vanish to reveal the beautiful old hard wood underneath.
Listening to this sitting on my porch staring out at the pond watching dragon flies, birds and butterflies float around. Only the sound of wild-life and this got damn beautiful country music. I salute you brother!
Just imagine a full band behind this song...dam, this man is amazingly talented!
Hotter than hell but I'm higher than gas. Man that's a fire overlooked verse but sad to say that gas is so high that being higher than gas can mean something else because higher than gas use to only be a candy bar
As a owner of a 5.7 obs tahoe z71. I approve
The lyrics flow like Ronnie Van Zant's did.
Amazing!! You just keep delivering awesome songs! Thank you for all you do!!
Damn son you don't miss
the best music comes from real pain and suffering, you can feel it in all his music, keep being you man, amazing talent, amazing voice, world needs alot more raw realness like this.
I wondered what your next release would be.  Nice!  Maybe this will put the politicians to rest (oops, just saw your carry on the passengers side).  Haha.  BTW, that Joe Rogan podcast answered everyone's question of the master you serve.  The Master.  I had not read Ecclesiastes in a while.  I have had a lot happen since my last time doing a study of that Book of the Bible.  I revisited because you said it was one of the books you looked to for wisdom.  The words had a totally different view since the last time I read them.  God bless you and keep you!    1 Corinthians 1:27 - But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong

Thank you for sharing your gift of❤, you are genuinely gift from GOD. Your songs go beyond, goes or feeds the soul, heals the broken, and comforts the poor in spirit. Restores hope. Protect your heart, my dear.
My dad had a 92 extended cab....that truck got us through some impossible situation....not a place on the planet i felt safer....except at the end of a long day cuddled up to my wife....brother....are you singing about my life?
I come here for the dogs and stay for the music.
Good song man. Keep them coming
Wasn't expecting a traditional country love ballad but I'm totally diggin it brother. Another banger as always!!
My local country radio station is playing Chris' music for everyone to enjoy!! This is such a sweet song, lot's of heart. 💕💕💕💕
My face! 😵‍💫 My new favorite!! Great job Chris!
Wow every single song is awesome.
I like your dogs. Sing a song about them.
Rock Island Armory Double Stack 9mm 1911?
That was a great song i really love your music dont ever change.
I hope gretsch gives you a cut of all the resonators they will be selling now
Pure talent. His music speaks to your soul.
Chris, you make me smile, you bring a tear to my eye, you make me remember.....God BLESS you!!!!!
Love your music! Keep them tracks flowing.
Gonna be listening to this one a bunch. Great song!
Perfect for my anniversary today! Thank you!
I'll be 75 next month and your song just took me home.  Only the pickup in my version is a 1960 something Chevy.  Thanks for the great music.  Looking forward to more.
niiiiiiiiiice 🍻
Daqui do Brasil. 👏👏👏👏👏🎵🎶😎
Man your just killing it your songs are so true full and heartfelt as it gets
Chris singing about his truck is pure joy🙏
MOAR! Thanks for the upload!
God Bless this Old Soul lad
Terrific video. Beautiful video. Love your songs and your singing. You are a really great looking Man too. Thank you for sharing your talent, your music, yourself, your story, and your Bible.  We are sending you 👏🏼Applause👏🏼 and 🙏🏻Prayers🙏🏻.
Great song and video. Thank you. Made my day.
Hit after hit. The best part is, "You be my Carter, I'll be your Cash."
Pretty sure I like this song, but I guess I’ll have to wait for the national media to tell me what I should think about it. Man, it was so much easier when I use to be able to decide what I liked on my own.
#This is the Country music I've been looking for, for thirty years. Jamey Johnson and George Strait gets close. But this man crosses the finish line. Thank you, Chris. God bless, partner.
Oliver clothes off 💋
<3
1 OF MY FAVORITES BRO🔥🔥 BIG LOVE FROM SHREVEPORT,  LOUISIANA, KEEP EM COMIN FOR THE 1s WHO AREN'T ABLE🙏🙏💯💯🤝🆙️🆙️
Another song idea could be based on mentally off borderline personalities suffering in life. My mom moved us house to house maybe 18 times growing up. All due to over spending, check to check, pulling scams on people, being 2 mo late on rents, manipulating people and losing all her family to the lies and loans never repaid. Good potential there.
❤❤❤❤❤
You are amazing Oliver. Take care of yourself,  family, friends and dogs.
Absolutely amazing
This guy and Colter Wall 🧱
Another great tune! My personal favorite.
i made this beat!!!!!!!!!!!! better lmao.test me lmao i lovve u dude!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you for putting the heart and soul back into music. It’s been a looooong time since I heard music I can feel. Congrats on your success and looking forward to what you bring to this world.
I am really happy for you brother
Pureristic 🦾🫠
Oliver I thank you and love you for what you're doing God bless you brother and keep on singing the song of The working Man...
Mine is an 85 Chevy and she needs a new body, still rides nice though.
The reason that so many non-country fans such as myself are sitting here listening to this guy is because he is a brilliant writer and his soul just oozes out through his music. Another great one!
Your the best !!!!!
Women, beer, trucks and 🐶, ya pretty much checked all the boxes. Good stuff!
Do me a favour, thank gawd he's finally autotuned.
U should do a song on the zombie people from drugs and cell phones and people just doing groundhog day over and over. All zombies.
This a banger 💯
Used to want a ninety some Chevy but they're too bad on gas so gotta settle for a mid to late 2000's.   Yes, I get this is about a woman.
Thank you Chris. I haven't enjoyed music this much in a long time. No auto tune!!!
Do NOT stop singing or writing songs! You remind me of the songs I grew up with before all the woke garbage.
Love it ❤
Another great song
This is the most original set of lyrics encompassing this classic rural subject matter that I’ve heard in decades. Love the fact that you mention the 350 and that the song isn’t just pushing innuendo. It comes across as honest instead of Nashville romanticized.
Damn good song
I never liked country music. Then it turned out what I thought was country music wasn't actual country music. This has heart and soul. It's smooth, sweet, playful, soulful. It feels like real life, and what we hope real life would be once again.
Found your way, brother.  Faith, everything else falls into place.  Don't let up.
Makes me wanna rewatch justified in the best way  Thank you Chris
This may be my favorite song from you, as it relates so well. Thank you for your words, and being so humble about it. You got a brotha up in MT!
Love it brother! Support that 2A!!!
Hey Oliver!!!! Im a ginger bearded man myself!!! Won all sorts of local singing competitions and was even on the TV once in Boston!!! Would love to start a bearded redhead group!!! 😂😂😂😂 Soulless country baby!!! Oh yea!!! Keep up the great work man!!! Freedom strong all day every day!!!
😊
That resonator sounds incredible. I play a Martin D-18 and it sounds great, but nothing compares to the sound of a resonator. Is that a G9230?
Nothing much is better than listening to the frogs croaking.  ❤  This is though.  😊
Ok, you got me ,fan for life x🇬🇧x
Don’t you ever take voice lessons Homey
TY for sharing your talent
Hey dude, the songs keep getting better. God bless from Ireland 🙏 🇮🇪
I have been enjoying your catalog on Spotify, but I still enjoy the live stuff as well. I laughed so hard when you said a lady drove all the way there to warn you about the Aliens....🤣
Absolutely magic. Grew up on a farm with a Silverado. Country Gold brother. Congratulations.
Another amazing song...This music just cuts right through all the bullshit for me.  I can literally feel it.  Thumbs up brother.
I love this!! Keep being true to yourself ❤
So good. A true southern description of love❤  and I love it takes me back to “well she was hotter than a $2 pistol”
i had a tent like that i miss mine
Love the video scenery.
Would it be too much to ask to get a video of your song Virginia up here? That's my favorite song of yours, besides Doggonit...I grew up in the Shenandoah Valley and moved to NC, and the swamps up here don't do it for me, but your song Virginia is perfect on days when I'm feeling those homesick blues...Love your stuff man, and CONGRATS on the Rogan Podcast! We see you Mr. Bigshot!! Love ya dude.
Damn son...
Long overdue authenticity.
Dude I don’t know you but I’ve got to say I am very proud of you ! Thanks for sharing your talent with us it is an absolute treat for the soul!!
Another great song would be on the meth epidemic through middle america. Really bad in the Rust Belt. Maybe mix of getting high, stealing to feed the addiction and how to overcome it. Again some interviews on ex addicts could add a bit to the background of the song. I know a punk rock kid, who was hooked on something, got into grub hub to pay for his addiction and then tried to commit suicide. Sad story.
LOL....
Absolutely love your music
Down home! Love it.
I think we are all thankful that you started putting your music on YouTube each and everyone of us that has listen to your song rather we enjoy country music it has resonated with all of us truly are a gifted musician I watched your podcast with Joe Rogan I'm glad you're still here sir I really am truly glad that you're making music and you're still living breathing walking this Earth from another man to another man love you brother stay the course
I have grown up workin' on 90s chevys and gmc's. Man am I a sucker for a ballad for my ol' 6.5s 😂 only one has ever left my sight, but not by my own making. The 93, 98, and 2006(optimizer block) are still kicking! Restoring a 93 four door dually with my little brother. Guess what we are blasting after I get the sound system done....😂
This song is pure gold!! I love it!!
keep it up my friend.veterans memorial museum in branson mo supports you.
Great song. Well done
WOW! Just... WOW!
Uuummm, well, you see, that a GMC not a Chevy😂😂😂.   🤭🤭🤭😏😏😏😏😏😏😏just messing around lol! Another good song good sir👍👍👍👌.
Stay true to yourself self Oliver, don’t let Hollywood and the music industry take you to the dark side!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Chris i just wanna say im 28 hard worker been put down by most most of my life. does not stop be from being good to people but ur music hits my soul in a certain way that makes me feel a lil better. Thank you. only way i can explain it brother.
I like how he's going back and refining his older songs but yet keeping that nice raw sound.
Bravo me boy! Keep it up we’ll keep supportin. God Bless!
She has Expired tags and a blown Transmission?  😁😁
Fantastic! I saw you without the beard- very handsome under there  I was conceived in the backseat of a car- mom said they almost named me Carseatta...love your art ❤
Not a big fan of country, but your music is like a tall glass of ice water for the thirsty. It is so rare to find things that are authentic anymore.
Thank you for sharing.
🤘🏻
Country GOLD!!!!
Great video.
I've hated Country music for the past decades too I guess uioughe, and I listen to Trance/Dance/EDM. Now THIS is Country.
Old school stuff is the best
2023 = The year of Oliver Anthony
Chevrolet, pay this man :)
He's much more than a viral moment for a song that spoke truth to the world. This dude can sing and play a guitar. He's a musician in a world full of fake musical illusions. Keep doing your thing brother. Bring some country back to country music.
So much feeling in every word!
Do a farmer song!!
Bet that 90 some chevy hauls hella bags of fudge rounds.
What a talent .... I'm sold and this is what County music has been missing for years ...
Fuckin real music! Thanks Brother!
Let's Goooooo! He's on a roll!
Chris, I'm a rock fan and never really liked country or rap. But after listening to your music, I can now say. I don't like rap!
I love this song.
Mate: you were gifted with such a voice and a profound instinct for melodies. So happy for you. Please stay in the Woods. They will protect you. God’s speed.
I can't get enough. I could listen to your songs all day.
Dude your just killing it!
Awesome great song ❤
Do you ever stop singing? WOW
Super necessary!!
Soundtrack to my life,  thanks 😊 🙏!
Sitting in my 90's ford down by the levy listening to you sing about 90's chevys
Love this s h i t
Good shit chris😁!
It Is Done. I Thirst
These songs sure have a way of making you sit down and do some self reflection on your own life!!!
Thirty years on and the question of whether humanity has advanced materially is as relevant as ever.
Where do we find out where you're playing next?
I take his music to be Americana/Country, love it! He showed up on my Pandora playlist ♥️
the new waylon jennings
Love this one my man!
The devil's gonna come for you hard with temptations stay strong brother, you're doing the Lords work.
I like my 65 Ford F-100. It's still going strong.
every time i hear one of your songs for the first time i feel my hair stand on end and goosebumps forming on my arms, i remember listening to rich men for the first time as a single tear rolled down my, face your music speaks to every part of me, thank you please keep going
All the 90 some trucks were better... I had a 94 extended cab Dodge Dakota Sport with a 3.9 Magnum V6 and a 5 speed and that thing would outrun a phone call! Lol
Epic beard
Good simple music from a man just singing about how he feels
Love it.
Sweeeeet! Keep 'em coming ;-)
Love the song, but that chevy interior looks 2008 or newer...lol
Give’em  hell, Chris!
Ahhhggghhh... Pre - OBD...
This man is insanely amazing at what he does. He is so humble as well. I'm so glad he finally took off and he deserves all the success that he is getting. Thank you Oliver Anthony for wverything.your doing.
Wow! This presentation of 90 some is even better than the first one. Oliver's voice, and his strumming is so raw, pure, untainted!
No words
Straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Love your music brother.  Keep that music coming. For some reason i still have hope for this beautiful country we live in thru your songs . God bless Oliver Anthony. 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🙏🙏🙏
Wish we could just get an album.
Thank you! You most definitely have an old soul. Love your stories.
Chris is the best thing to happen to music in my lifetime. Keep the songs coming brother. 🇺🇸
Dang, another good one. Wonderful voice
Enjoying good music and the simple things in life.
hermano no te detengas sigue adelante acuerdate de los pueblos latino americanos tambien sufrimos mucho  viva el pueblo pobre de norte america viva venezuela Dios te bendiga
Amazing bud
Oh Hell Ya!~ I love this one bro. It resonates in my heart and  feels good in the back of my brain!~ Keep on Going!~ God bless you Always! Amen!~
Absolutely incredible
This Guy stumbled back quite a few years and done it right, ever wonder what real Country music sounded like back in the day...Every word that comes out of his mouth. Good to hear a song do what it's supposed to do, tell a good old story😉 THANK YOU!
Chris, Keep it up brother. Try stay busy to keep your mind occupied. Don't worry about our countries problems cause you can't fix them alone. Don't get overwhelmed by people wanting to "help" you, just go with your best judgment and the sky is the limit. But CASH OUT CHRIS. YOU DESERVE IT. I DOUBT MONEY WILL CHANGE YOU ANYWAYS. Loved seeing you on JRE. I got to just really hear your personality and life experiences. Your such a genuine feller. Sorry from KY. Lol. I been reading Proverbs, just a couple verses to really sink them in and see how they still hold true today. Alot of wisdom from our ancestors that relate to today. Stay strong and safe. Your friend  Nick from Kentucky
This is such a phenomenal song!! I can definitely relate to this song 😏
love from Australia my friend
Great song dude
I love these outdoor videos! They have me anticipating a bird flying in the frame. 🦅
My brother's first truck was a 73' Chevy w/ a 350 that ran like a scolded 3 legged dog. Was a great first truck. He later had a 1970 SS camaro w/ a 350 monster.  Fantastic song!
Much love brother !!!! from Hateful Bones in lynchburg Va
Hell ya brother keep em coming
Honey, it's OK to go get you a new truck.  You deserve it
This man I shitting on all cylinders.  We get you my man!
Thank you for your songs. Your the real deal fs! An were living in a bell tent and minivan, nomads, vanlife…out of the rat race and just working when we want and paying our bills. Workcamping, seasonal work, etc. US has lost there way
My dude
I like his lyrics and messages in his songs. But I just can't stand this twangy, dingalingy dingy dangy ding dang doodle music. It's like nails on a chalkboard to me. To rach their own I guess.
You should do a song with @MorganWallenVEVO
Absolute tune!
Dig it🤙
As a 51 year old ginger, you are the very first redhead in my life I have felt proud to call my people!!! We don’t get enough representation!! 😂😂😂😂👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼
He forgot to mention the occasional breakdowns and leaks... maybe in the next song
This is authentic and pure..... thank you
All I have to say is, your music is getting better and better, I would Definitely buy your Albums....
Straight fire
I'm higher than gas🤭
Banger love from Ireland 🇮🇪 ❤️
Dont shave the beard
This guy is too good.  Is this the new American Idol?  Something is going on here behind the scenes.
Notjing to prove
NOTHING like a good truck and a good woman...
This song brings me back to being a little girl growing up in the 90's listening to old country songs on the radio on a Sunday morning drive with my dad in his 90's Chevy! 😍🥰🔥🙌🙌💯 #Z71Baby #IYKYK
Editing on this video is fantastic!!!
Your gonna hit 100k subscribers without even asking for a subscription!!! Its obvious your gonna be a legend in country music!
Let's go 🎉
Hey man, What kind of gear are you using there to record? And what reverb?
Goodmorning America
Someone bought a new truck
Keep singing your heart out. America is listening.
You are fuckin awsome
Oliver Anthony 🎉🎉🚀🚀🚀🇺🇲🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
So good!! Keep it coming!! And doing what your doing
Kol
Got a song idea. Maybe do an intensive set of interviews with the recent Afgan vets on their thoughts on returning from Afganistan, returning to normal society, maybe getting homeless. I think there could be a real strong song about that it would resonate massively in your style.
Working on a perfect record, amazing songs!!
Babe wake up, Oliver Anthony posted!!
Ok....this is a banger...good job man
Sounds great Chris, keep going!
This is what unbridled talent loos like. Keep being the voice of what we all feel.
always absolute fire!
Hell yes brother I was hoping ya remastered this one. Next needs to he dagoonit that songs hits the soul. Love the music man!
Happy Labor of Love Day to you as well.....
I'm a 37 year old man, all 3 of these new songs make me cry.
"shes hotter than hell! I'm higher than gas! 🔥🔥🔥
That's a good one,I like that one. She was hotter than hell and I was higher than gas 🤣 I can relate.
Praying for you, brother.
Now hear me out for a second as I say this because there is a good meaning behind it: I've never been a huge country bluegrass genre fan infact it's one of my least favorite music genres but Chris has a way of speaking into the soul and connecting to people like how music was always meant to be and my God with all this technology and division in the world its a relief to see artists doing just that
Arlo Guthrie would be proud
Congratulations Chris but remember stay humble
Old Steel built truck w some real Steel conveniently mounted 😁👍
Chris you’re the best, please don’t let the Illuminati destroy you 🙏
Another awesome track for my Spotify playlist.  Thank you Chris!!!!!!
I've been promoted by the mainstream. Puttin' on my accent. Just another steam valve leading to nowhere....
Love it, love it, love it!!! Keep ‘em coming Brother, I’m loving every minute of it….even all the dumbasses trying to hate on you, just makes me listen louder and prouder!!
💜💜💜
Beautiful song. I love my wife ❤
Awe FINALLY, real county music again. No political BS, no drama, just good ole country music. ❤❤❤
Love it! Brings back good memories.
Goddamn this man is singing to my soul.
Oliver, your music has so much soul and feeling, it gushes out of my speakers. I love this mans music! Great voice, great lyrics, great playing...and that Gretsch resonator has the sweetest tone!
when can we get T-shirts
♥
Thank You Chris ❤ your 🎶 music❤🎉 Happy Labor Day to all the Hard Working People 💪 🇺🇸 🎉
There is nothing better (in my opinion) than the sound of southern picking, I don't care if it is blues, rock, folk or metal, those boys down there are my favorite pickers of all time. My soul is delighted with this music, and it is even better because it is pure and medicinal, like music is meant to be created and shared.
i was birthed in the hills of Cuba, next to Guantánamo Bay. the visuals alone make this a great video.
Nothing beats a Chevy ❤
That's America, heart & soul.👍. Love it, brother.  God bless.
Nothing better than old trucks and good hearted women.
Should have been a Toyota but still pretty good.
So beautiful love god every One ❤️☦️
The red beard and different colour hair men are going to take over.
This man's music hits my soul
You are awesome young fella
You're truly talented, Keep it brother!
Bluegrass has returned
I’d pick ol’ blunt-nose Fords, but I hear what you’re sayin’.
Wow. I feel like the damn trees shoulda been clapping for you at the end of that one. Well done!
Gives me solace as I reflect on my good fortune. I've got a 98 Siverado  I traded 2 ounces of gold for and a wife I married in 93 who I wouldn't trade for for anything or anyone.
Great song, keep it up.
Love this.
Good ass songs man
Keep sending out the messages in your songs. Keeping it real.
Beautiful man. Just beautiful. Thank you.
Everyone attacking him outlines just how fall our society has slipped from consciousness
I'm so thankful for Oliver Anthony (Chris), you've been faithful and obedient to God and in this you're setting an example for others to follow.  If you're going to be anything, be a Moses and don't sell out.   There's been a spiritual shift. Jesus is calling you to turn, place your trust in Him, who is able to save. Hear the heart behind the words, there is more to God than a canned church service with 3 songs and a sermon. God sent His son to seek and save the lost. We are the lost. You and I.  God bless you and keep you.
I feel great listening to this music
👍🏼👍🏼
🌹
Everytime he drops a new song, all I can say is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC
Great song.
you sir are talented as can be keep it up brother man
This one might just be my favorite. Absolutely love it.
I play guitar and I love to learn this old country style I love it, so simple so much soul.
This is the best music I have heard in many many years. I wish nothing but the best for this God fearing man.
Shabbat Shalom 🔥 Happy Holy Sabbath day
❤
LMAO What a GREAT song/tune/tone !!!! Keep'em comin' my VA cousin:))
I don't like the editor of the video. Dickhead included footage while Oliver was driving a newer Chevy. Great song, but that editor is a dick.
Thanks Brother!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Magic absolutely magic 🐻🚀❤️
Gonna have this song played out by the end of the day. 5 times so far. My kids are gonna hate me lol
Chris, you are truly an amazing human being. Nothing sugar coated, as real and raw as they come. God bless
Pure gold!
From the 60s until now there has been very few "singer / songwriters" that pour themselves into their lyrics as what you have been churning Chris/ Oliver Anthony .  You might not think you are that great of a musician, singer, picker but even with all the help other artist get with auto-tune and fancy gadgets they don't compare.
Excellent reference.  Thanks Chris!!!   Keep it up dude!!   Love you!
Let's go
Just Awesome
He’s Better than this new wave country shit at any rate
Algorithmic bump. Keep at it good sir.
He is really good but I've noticed that the way his sings is practically the same for every song just different lyrics.
Sweet!!! I've had three '90 Something Chevy's. A '90, a '93 and a '99... I dig the song Chris. :-)
I miss my lifted 97 C1500 single cab short bed with a 5.7L V8 and auto trans. :(
Wow! Much better recording! The new mic is an improvement to the cell phone for sure. Love your music.
Nice.
Love it, Chris.
God bless this patriotic voice!
This brought back some memories, seriously. Keep’er going Chris, you’re amazing.
My (ex)step dad is a rodeo contractor and in his ammy days he drove a 90 something Chevy. Drove that pickup some my senior year of high school, 1993.
Chris, this one is incredible!! Love your music and your heart.
90 Some Chevy- brought to you by GMC
Sing it son. We are listening!
❤❤❤❤
And the end is epic,he puts the guitar like positioning the rifle😂
Love love love this song. I can’t tell who he loves more… the woman or the truck? Haha! Sounds like a perfect match to me. Lol. Beautiful honest music. So special and to be treasured. Thank you for sharing your gift with the world. It’s like a light in a dark room
This flow crazy nice and slow
God bless Chris for giving us unknown singer songwriters a voice !
Rich men of north Virginia is one of my favorite songs ever. The lyrics were deep. But now I head this song and see that you represent White America. Nothing wrong with that though. Nothing at all. It'd be nice to get a Polynesian artist to sing about our own struggles.
wonderful piece of art!
Great stuff man
GO ON OLIVER!!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
.✝️🩸JESUS SAVED OUR SOULS✝️🩸
Oliver Anthony has easily made the best songs of Summer 2023
"Higher than gas."😂
🔥 bro keep doing you. I love it. ❤️🤘🏼
I hope youtube is paying him atleast some $$
This guy doesn't make anything mid. I have gone back to all the old songs and everysingle one, is a piece of work. Lets go!
Here I am 7 AM blessed with another OA banger. Respect ❤
Breath of fresh air 🔥
The  Peoples President needs to add your music to his rallies .
Great version of this one!!  I love the subtle shoutout to the 2A community. This is how it's supposed to be in this country!
❤️❤️❤️
Lol whole new meaning to dully ass
SHEEWWWW BUDDY! LOVE IT
Gave me chills. Once again one of us Appalachian folks sings from the true soul of REAL America.
Chris Anthony  has it all.   The voice,  the look and personality.   God blessed him dearly.   Thanks for the music.
You are authentic country and that's so refreshing. New country music isn't country. IMO
Man, this dude just came out of nowhere with some of the best country songs I've ever heard. This is so refreshing a d simple and a true joy to hear
I liked the 4.3 V6 with 5 speed on the floor. I had a 91 GMC that was stripped down with just an AM radio, but she was smooth.
Another fucking banger
Lyrics?
When I was a kid in the 80s in Louisiana my grandpa use to wake me up for school every morning with Hank #1, Johnny Cash, and Waylon Jennings. This takes me right back there and I can’t thank you enough for reminding me my friend. What I would give to hear you cover Hanks “I’ll never get out of this world alive” or “Lost Highway”. Thank again my friend and God bless.
Whole world is full of a bunch of fake crap. Chris is over here making songs around 3 minutes long they're nothing but the truth all coming from a real guy that's why we love it.
I just love his voice!!!!!
Brah.  I really like this one.    She really is  a 90 sum chevy  Great tune thanks
i cant get enough of this hillbilly redneck shit.
Love that you are always out in nature! Love the tent! The love between a guy and his car is priceless 💖 blessings to you my friend ✝️
Johnny CASH & June CARTER! ❤‍🔥
bask in thine glory, man. this is your time.
My brother from another...  Thank you.
I love your felted to heart music: God Bless you and your family Brother Oliver.
Good ol boy.
Love it bro 😎!!!!! Keep it up. Stay blessed !!!!
I just finished listening to you on Joe Rogan. Amazing. God is using you to change our culture! Praying for you buddy. If you have an theology questions please reach out homie. Love ya fam!
Bravo!
Has anyone found a good playlist on spotify with similar music?
👌👌
Started out my Saturday just right
Gotta tell ya young fella I absolutely love yer song Cob Webs and Cocaine !  Reminds me of songs like Long Black Veil and other older country music !
He just keeps writing about what's important!!!  The love of a good woman and some time wth her...  This is what's best in life!
It looks like a musical Sasquatch in the wild, get em Ollie!
You are now America’s bard. Thank you for this.
A Legend in one Day!!!!!!!!!!!!! Luv U Man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😀😀😀  BEST OF THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Keep em coming Chris! Much love from the UK!
Wow! Amazing! Outstanding! Keep on keeping on. Golden.
Mentioned beer.  Mentioned truck.  Looks like he is finally transitioning to mainstream country.
I'm from India n I'm juz listening to country music recently coz of Oliver.
I own a 96 Chevy step side
Everyone is so happy for you. Take all this joy and put it to good use.
Nice! One of my favourites since listening to all your videos since RMNOR dropped. I’m personally hanging out for the re-recording of ‘I’ve Got To Get Sober’. Keep up the awesome work man and stay strong in your convictions of the amazing way you’re handling everything and staying grounded 😎
Fuck man. After hearing you sing, and watching you on rogan, I’m sold.
THIS is Country Music.
Another good one...
Very nice
Love it.   Keep up these feel good, nostalgia numbers and you'll be unstoppable.
Next song no beard..
What makes this music better is I believe you. Country now is millionaires talking about being raised poor and loving their rusty truck which is a song they thought of in their Lamborghini. Your genuineness comes through in the music.
Can't wait for the Doggin video to come out. My kids love the eating bugs part haha
Chevy needs to Gift you with a brand new Chevy in this day and age of Social Media...  * Just putting it out there???!!!  * Keep it cranking Oliver Anthony.  ** Will be adding you to future podcasts of The Ron Wiles Music Show.   MANY BLESSINGS TO YOU - RIDE THE WAVE!
I was going to say how much I liked your song but other people said it better. Instead I would like to say how moved I was by the overwhelming love in your comments.
My husband had a 63' we'd go for rides all over tennessee. We were married young. I was 17 he was 21. We were very poor. Married 18 years, then I became a widow. I miss those rides and that slow pace of tennessee mountain living. Now I'm 52, raised our kids alone, and live a world away from Appalachia. Tennessee will always be in my heart and soul. Your music brings back so many memories.💛
Thank Almighty God for you!!! You're exactly what this country needs right now!!!❤❤🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I don't think Oliver has enough diversity where he lives
Beautiful sound to my ears ❤️🇺🇸🙏❤️
All the Ford folks going to be full of hate now..
Another hit imo! ❤
I got here 41 minutes into the new release. Holy crap. This is awesome. Hey Oliver, I love you man from a hard-working man that digs ditches every day for a living you’re my voice.
This is great ❤
Ok now do a project with #Upchurch would digg a southern gospel album. 🎉 #RHEC
I’m here for this!
❤❤❤ love your voice.  Great song 🎵  you just keep singing young man. ❤ 🙏
Another amazing song to hit the repeat button to for the rest of the day. God bless y’all.
Raw talent. Love how real this music is.
Great song
Hey love the work, but you alone with a guitar is getting old quick sound wise, I think it’s time to find you some band mates brother
Blessings,  Brother
So glad you are reposting these for people who didn't already dig in. 90 Some Chevy is my fav
Fucking amazing man!!!!!
Stay true
Solid song right here
Good Lord son, dropping one banger after another. Outstanding!
Thank you. Relief from the concrete and asphalt that surrounds me in the city.
❤Please don't stop,and don't change a thing! ❤
New cars, new technology, new problems.
Your music takes us to a world where we live nice and slow again. I long for that world. Thank you, Chris. ❤
N!CH
Love all your songs. Glad you’re upgrading your iPhone recordings! God bless you in your walk with Him.
My man actually read The Bible but doesn't push Religion on others, He is for guns,He is for weed and everyone doing their own thing as long as your not hurting no one. Quite a rare Man.
A country revolution. This is Paul Revere. I don't hear the lyrics, they are felt. Thank you.
What a gorgeous song! Normal women will be in love. Feminazis will say "you're objectifying women by comparing them with cars". Keep on with your authenticity, Oliver. We, people like me, need people like you.
This som-a-bitch is the next Johnny Cash! God Speed Mr. Anthony.
I listen to your song as I look out over the fields . The farmers are harvesting and the song fits with it. beautiful song thank you
Thanks Chris! Another beautiful song that touches the soul. Your music is keeping me grounded to my roots in this crazy f'd up world we are living in now.
I lked the first one better idk i felt like the pace was a bit faster
Why is it always look like Chris has a stalker recording him through the trees
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ love it!! Keep'em coming!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Another great song.  Keep em comin'
We comparing women to cars and sexual innuendos with a touch of dui is very lideral
Nice work brother, even better
Who wants an Oliver Anthony/Zach Bryan collab???
Nah... He's now pandering to liberals
Just sharin a tune. Thank you!
This sounds like every other country song on the radio.  Beer, trucks and camping.  The decline begins here.
Just got off a graveyard shift, sitting here with a cup of coffee and this song. That was a nice way to wind down my day.
The timing of this post is wild because I just had essentially a meditation session this morning, listening to Got to Get Sober and Want to Go Home. Those are my favorites. Sat in my kitchen having a good cry while everyone was asleep. ❤
Please re-record doggon it! Love that song
You bear stop now bafore you become famous. NumbSayin? Love it like kat and I love it like kiss keep on keepin on
This is so real. Hope to make your acquaintance someday in the sweet bye and bye.
Holy mother of God 😮.  He is just filled with talent & God hearted soul❤❤ God bless you n yours😊
Great to hear country music coming back I've got to find your CDs❤😊
Sweeeet! Cranking this up tonight around the fire pit. Another banger from my favorite new artist. Thanks Chris, have a good, safe Labor Day weekend. ❤
Is that a short bed ?
✝️🇺🇲❤️🤍💙🇺🇲✝️
Listening to JRE I think so many of us relate to him. We are just trying to make it through this life and are fed up with the left vs right nonsense.
This is not commercial country. It’s folk-blues. Put some Ricky Skaggs bluegrass players around this man and we’re good to go for decades.
jesus christ man. stop knockin it outa the park I'm not just saying this because I am a fan of you personally I legit REALLY like this song  one time and it's already stuck in my head
My one and 5 year old love his music. It's timeless and reaches all ages.
. It’s hard to sum up into words how much you are helping. So I just wanted to say thank you.
I miss Virginia...

Breathe of fresh air, no twerking half naked, not glorifying guns & violence, a humble & super talented guy, god bless you brother 🙏🏿
One of a kind.
Good one.  I loved your interview on Rogan. Keep the faith, you're an inspiration to many.
Finding your music this last week has helped alot after my nan passing on the 26th ❤ Thank you
A case of beer and what?
Merci de France, tu as touché mon coeur et mon âme, toute ma gratitude pour le bonheur que tu nous offres💕 Dieu te bénisse Thank you from France, you touched my heart and my soul, all my gratitude for the happiness you offer us💕 God bless you
This is Real country music before the Barbie's and Ken's took it over.
I be singing this to my 4 month old son.  😁
Hes our Bob Dylan of today
This is Music from the Heart . Truth always Behind This Beautiful Music .
This is the most genuine country music I've heard in forever. Grounded, real, and truly relatable.
Yup.........
Write a song about Horses, you write and sing beautiful music.
My man keeps this up, he’s gonna be a true legend.
Gingers are not to be trusted
I just one wheel peeled until my tires blew with a tear in my eye, thank you good sir. Men of culture will know
We must protect this man at all cost. He's a national treasure.
Beautiful.
Love it!!
❤
This one was my favorite so far, glad to hear it properly recorded.   Keep spending the love brother ❤
I'm glad he finally showed a "90 summ Chevy" I was starting to think he didn't know the year of his Chevy 🤣
You are such an inspiration I look forward to seeing more by you in the future.  Keep it up brother.
This is real fucking country music!!!!
Dont get me wrong i love this one, but i hope he dosent delete the orginal video
What country music was meant to be.
Yup! I have a 94 silverado single cab that I call my time machine. Everything is alright when I am in my truck. 🇺🇲
amazing!
She’s my carter I’m her cash is a fucking line!
Thanks brother! Love all you guys!
Thank you Sir. God is Awesome I sit & listen dog next to me  I thank our lord every day for the smallest gifts he gives us now he has given us one large gift as I sit with my dog & listen to you  we fight on we ride on we pray on & we let folks know we know a guy that can help all its starts on your knees
30+ year long hip hop and punk rock listener that wouldn't even consider giving music like this a chance after hearing what they play on country music stations.  I am now here every day with tears in my eyes listening to your music.  This is not country. This is soul, and I am all for it.
What a lovely suprise today! Sweet song ❤ I love it! Thank you for being you.
You know why I love Oliver Anthony Music? Because he's always singing to the trees, the permanent audience.
That’s home. A bit more west in the foothills, but same same.
Still driving my 86 chevy. She's like a part of me I can't let go.
Stay in the Bible, young man. Do not flinch. Isaiah is one of my favorites, as a recommendation. May God continue to bless you.
Yikes who shot this video..why the weird angles..it couldn't be simpler...why fix what wasn't broke.
I support him, by watching all the ads,on his YouTube channel
That’s home. A bit more west in the foothills, but same same.
Damn dude this is a badass love song
Just in time to bring people together right before they release "the election variant".  Hopefully everyone sees through the bullshit this time around.
Wow. Happy he dropped another song. Wish him the best.
What a wonderful tribute to your lady. I hear the love when you sing.
❤️ My husband and I (especially him who's Abt to be 50yr old😋) absolutely loves your music, Mr.Chris, and how much you express real true emotions and feelings as you sing n perform... Right by yourself in the middle of the backwoods (which is exactly like the place we're located; very rural). You're an true man of God and such an inspiration to His people. Your talents has really woke up this world and those who can relate (which is nearly the entire world's population!😂) to everyone's life struggles... God's sending a message through you Mr. Sir and it's gotten our attention through and through. We're listening, Lord God, and Thank You for giving us the opportunity to be awoken by this incredible young talented American child of God! Bless you Oliver Anthony because you deserve it for having the balls to spread the Goodness of God's love and sending out His message! HE'S COMING BACK AND THIS PROVES HE IS THE ONE N ONLY WAY, TRUTH, AND LIGHT! WAKE UP WORLD.... HIS MESSENGER IS TRYING TO TELL US ALL SOMETHING.... something GREATER THAN WE'VE EVER KNOWN OR SEEN BEFORE! We're blessed to have this beautiful soul love us enough to spread God's Word and His Love! 😚💖😘
Man….just a great song.  God Bless you Brother.  Making so many people feel just a little something.
Change to a Toyota and it's perfect! 😂
I'm waiting for him to criticize liberals like he criticized conservatives.  If you sing folk music, and you say that Republicans are exclusively the problem, then you are 100% faking a personality to get views. Ain't a person from the hills or the hollers that says conservatives are the problem with this country, and NOT liberals.  Dude is fake.
I’ve hated country music my whole life. This guy is changing that. He’s it
Been trying to decide my favorite Oliver Anthony (Chris) song. Finally decided it's:  Rich Man's Gold Payments Hell on Earth Between you and Me I Wanna Go Home Rich Men North of Richmond Cobwebs and Cocaine Ain't Got a Dollar Doggone it Always Love You (Like a good ole dog) Feelin Purddy Good  Ain't Gotta Dollar Virginia  90's Some Chevy Stuck Living in the New World I've Gotta Get Sober Cover song of: Where Corn don't Grow  At the start of everyone, I say to my husband, "this one's my favorite". Got 'em on a playlist on repeat. Now I just need a CD copy to play in my 90's some XJ.
I love this song!!
Sounds great, Chris! Keep on Keeping on!
Don’t know much about a 90-something Chevy, but I can tell you that my 20-something Chevy was unreliable trash.
Love this one! Been blasting your tunes on site for weeks now ❤
Another good one 👍🏻
Ma man
Thank you! Stay safe and be well. God bless
WAKE UP AMERICA AND FIND JESUS THE CHRIST!!!
❤💯🙌🙏☝👊
Hell yea I've been waiting for a newer recording of this thank you so much chris
Yes, sweeter than honey💙
You said it brother. A 91 S10, a bag a smoke, a bottle of Beam, and Renee. Fishing on the bank of the Ohio, riding the quad, or each other. Damned good days.
Oh my soul! That is pure, real life country son. Good lord..
Dam good song!
OMGosh Oliver! I love this-beautiful and my favorite so far. Nothing like a song of being in love -it transcends all the other BS going on in the world today.
This is purdy good ❤
That was just plain awesome.  Thank you!
love you man, you restore my faith in humanity  sounds weird i know but its the truth
Killin it. Best one yet
Those centrist talking points do absolutely nothing. If anything, it now made you seem weak and someone with no convictions and just a hit song.
This is sooo original I love it appreciate it man
Your music speaks to my soul.
whooooo hoooo! Love  it!! Sing it!!!
Man! This is the music we have been waiting for.❤
❤
Your music changed me, i was depressed before i found your music keep it up you are my hero
Happy Labor Day to you too... Great song! 100 says it will be the top of the charts . BTW Are you single? Asking for a friend ha ha i love you!!! Peace!
His voice is like honey, smooth and sweet.
From the first time.i herd this man sing i have been a fan. his music and sound is my good feeling on a bad day keep on keeping on my man
Quick - buy up all the 90s era GM pickups
😊God Bless you.
Mr Chris and Mr Zach asp
Great song! Keep them coming Chris!
Pure authentic “heart and soul” music with no centralized agenda. Music like this is not just refreshing, it’s healing…
Your music is a blessing. Thank you, Oliver.
Keep it up Chris! God bless ya Brother!
Oh how the times have passed. Am I really getting that old? Back in my day country singers sang about a 60 something Chevy. Another good one sir.
Damn. Can this dude write a bad song? I don't think so.
Hoo weee son, you pluck those heart strings for shore.....
i predict cops will nail him for the gun at 1:20, and the IRS will nail him for taxes, and a Spec Ops raid will kick him out of his squatters' tent compound.  but he'll find a way to sing about it dandy.
Love it!
i need an album. there is no music like this right now.
Natural effortless talent.. Love folk music.
This guy I'd phenomenal!!!❤
Such an original sound, I love this, Chris. Keep em' rollin' in. Adding another classic to my playlist!
Everything about your music is just so real, and makes you feel like you really are in that moment.
She's my Carter and I'm her Cash . Holy Shit Lord that is good  👍
Love this song, gets stuck in my head most days.
Rad. If you take care of her, she'll take care of you.
Boy, I can relate. Learned to "drive" with a 1970's Chevy.  And we are still together... 5 kids later.  Grab a case of beer and let the sun go down real low. Boy, there were a few summers spent like that. Those days seem to be gone.  Did I mention the 5 kids. Lol This song brings up so many memories of my bride and 32 years later and a life of ups and downs. Mostly up, but some low points. But still the same gal and a lifetime of memories.  Thank you for sharing your song
Glad she was a "Chevy"  Not some broke down Dodge full of rust holes And oil leaks, or Found On Roadside Dead🤣
I'm packing up work a second and am going to go driving down some nice roads listening to this in the sun here in the UK - thanks Chris!
Hope the Preacher ain’t mad when I request this on Sunday
From all of my previous comments you outta know I'm a huge huge fan !!! Any chance you could give me details on that yert  tent in the back ground !?? Thanks regardless
He’ll yeah
I would like to see an album of these outside recordings and not something from a studio. These songs are remarkable!
turned me on to country music
Keep cranking out the great tunes, and never give in to the music industry 🤟
22k views and 800 comments in 32 minutes. I've never seen anything like this.
This guy is the biggest plan in music industry iv ever seen. Look how he said ''Diversity is our strength." 😂🤡
Your music, just hits the soul
This song is beautiful
I have a 97 Chevy z71, I can totally relate😊
This is real, authentic music in a world of fakes. Thank you!
love this
It’s like someone is bringing the Music back to us
Cool, liked it! Softer voice this time! Always leave us wanting more!❤😊
Got you another million-dollar bill there, thanks love, for showing me the Cash.
Chris, I hope you’re planning on releasing a vinyl album full of your music 🎶.
Waylen would love this tune
My Man!   What an absolute beautiful song!  Those lyrics just keep on pulling emotions and imagery out to us!  Thanks again!
For the algorithm!
Superbe musique, je suis français, et ici dans le sud de la france on écoute vos morceaux, et bien-entendu , le hit " les hommes riche de Richmond", félicitations, et bon courage, bravo encore, merci pour votre musique qui touche les coeurs.
Thank you, and we hope you enjoy your Labor Day weekend too.
Beautiful💜
Saw you on Joe Rogan,  It seems you are in need of a power train upgrade.    Maybe a collaboration with another YouTube.  Amila  Hartford has similar goals and upgrades car.
Stepside baby!
Another hit. Keep them coming
These songs are almost like getting punched in the nose. Can't help but tear up a bit.
Hm 🤔 song ideas for the next few songs..his gun, his tent, his dog and/or his case of beer 😆😉
This is REAL COUNTRY MUSIC!   Smart lyrics and all from the heart.: "She's my Carter, and I'm her Cash."  Thanks for this today Chris.
Absolutely fantastic! Good Heavens you most definitely have a God given gift for song lyrics so please keep up the great work, thank you so very much for taking me back home in a time long passed! Lee from Tennessee!
Not a country fan but I love your Music!
We love you so much ❤❤❤
That boy got some soul❤❤❤
When ever I fell bad I just listen to Oliver Anthony music and I’m instantly good. Thank you
Step into the river of destiny and get caught in its flow 💜💚🙏🖖
You're such a great songwriter. I truly enjoy your music
I wish I had some kind of talent Oh yeah I do This dude inspires me to pursue what I always knew I could do
Im rooting for you brother. Sing it
Oliver Anthony keep up that great music. i love all of song man. mad respect for you are putting out there for music.
I love this type of guitar it's simply amazing and love Mr. Anthony's music.
I’ve been waiting for this great song
every song sounds the same.  enjoy your 15 minutes of fame, while you can.  the first song was full of pain, anger, frustration, now you're just recycling, reheating leftovers.
The problem is that I can't hear English well
Another Great one.. Good shit keep it up
God bless you brother. it's nice to know there is still country folks like myself.i feel like they keep trying kill us out
Well here we go, singing about a woman like every other mainstream Nashville song.
This video has been up for 28 minutes total and there are already 680 comments. If this doesn’t show you how connected people around the world are to this man at this moment I’m not sure what else you need to see. This immediate flash of unity will smolder but the effects will linger. We are starting to grow together. Little steps at a time. One humanity together.
Love this one. Such a beautiful  song.
Always nice to see you.👊
Brother that was awesome.
Hey Chris Aka Oliver My brother I Been Jammin to all your songs since the release of Rich Men North Of Richmond!! Love the music & I grew up Listening to old country/folk from the 50's & up. Your songs hit my heart & soul Every time  I listen no matter what. Much Love to you & thank you for the amazing songs. I pray we all come together & get along. God Bless you my friend.
This is a banger...you are a legit badass songwriter and singer..thanks
He done it again
Gretch should hop on this and sponsor you ASAP
Ahh,, you youngsters! 😉 That ol' soul should have made it about a 70 Some Chevy.😉 Plenty of memories in my 79 K20 4WD 3/4 ton Chevy, totally rebuilt from the bare frame up, which gave the truck a very special attachment to me. Your song puts those memories to music. Seriously, this is a fantastic song and your voice is perfection to my ear.
Thank you ❤🙏
Awesome!
Pure, genuine, authentic and real grateful ! Thanks Boss!
Where has he been all this time?
And the views go boom son
Watching/Listening from Bonny Scotland.  Oliver Anthony is truly magic!  Wish he was 'one of us ' Scots!  Well done sir.
maga
Thank you always enjoy your music.
The voice of America!!
Hey chris! YOUR MUSIC HAS REACHED THE UK :)
None of us are good Chris. But your weakness means that God can flex his strength.
My man I like your music but I’m wondering why you have no country accent when you’re talking / only when you sing
Man this is a good song🥰
Awesome song! Id love to hear this with drums!
Thanks for your music! This is not the perfect country song. It didn't say anything about trains and momma or getting drunk. So i had to
It's nice to see the music videos getting better camera work and audio. Love to see it.
Love it! God bless you!
Be careful brother and watch your ass as the spin doctors try and twist your story.
Yes! This songs makes me glad to be alive! Remembering the sweet joy in simple pleasures
CDs don’t matter anymore but I just wanna say I would buy your CD and I don’t have a CD player
This isn't the song that introduced me to you, but is one of my favorites!
❤❤❤
Hello again. Hello.  Do you like my hat?
He's gonna shine soon. ❤
Oh I like this one too.
3 chords and the truth.
Love your work. Keep it up! You're my inspiration to keep going in this world.
I do think this is "country" music.. this is soul music
Amazing talent!!!  More please!!
I love his songs but I think he would be better with a band behind him and some back up singers
Nice!
Don't burn out the fans.  Space yo shit out.   but its great, as always.
❤
It was fun while it lasted.
audio is off at 0:39
Please do this for every one of your beautiful amazing songs! We all want these higher-res versions of your already amazing lower-res/iPhone/laundry room versions 🙏
In a Africa it's been a Long Week🌍
A few of your songs have mentioned a woman. Are you married or about to be? Honor Jesus with your songs and your life, and keep up the good work!
The lyrics tick all the boxes for a Country song.
Long as she ain’t heavy as a Chevy💍
Finally! I love this song
This is amazing He's got me into country music now, Keep  it up young man👌
You have a gift brother.
Is this about sex?
God sent this man to save country music
The new "Americana" Love it! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I wish people would stop trying to ride this man’s coattails and just enjoy.
👍
lets go Oliver!
Ya it confirmed, definitely not just an idiot with a guitar!!!! Making it look easy, but don't want the easy money. LoL well done Mr oliver
Gezzzz you have such a gift! God is good!  Thank you!
Rich Men North of Richmond was a folk anthem. This is pure country to me. I've never been a fan of the genre but I'd listen to it much more if there are other artists like this. Can anyone put me on to similar 'country' singers?
Great song, got it stuck in my head already
Anyone singing about a case of beer and a Zebco is my people
Reminds me of the 70's. When we didn't rush to get "NOWHERE" like people do today.
Thats some good ol country soul ..
Hands down, my favorite artist
Lovin' it!!🤩🎵🎶 Thank ya Chris!! Keep it up bud!😉👍👍
Love it!❤
Real music didn't die, it lives in Appalachia
Amazing
Thank you Oliver 🙏🌲🐕🐕🌳
All you hard working people, enjoy your labor day weekend. Enjoy the burgers and beer!
Legend
It's amazing how so many people have been so wrapped up in social engineering tht they had no clue all these musicians like Oliver Anthony exist. Grant it they won't believe because they refuse to accept anyone could be on par with Oliver, but I'll go listen to Joe Huber after Oliver, and other roots musicians that've always been around.
Wow my new favorite song of his now.
As a 90 some Ford Guy, even earlier, I LOVE this song!  Keep up and hold strong brother!
Morning! So nice to see a true Va Gentleman. I just want to thank you for putting ur ass out there for the truth. I grew up n this city of rich men from Richmond. We r not guaranteed tomorrow and GOD isn't making anymore land. Take care my friend.😀🤪
This man is an authentic true American Patriot!!!!
❤🔥🍻
Love this. Love my Chevy also.
I really like your recordings with your phone, gives it a kind of old radio rustic sound to it. But hot damn the new recordings on your new equipment amazing!!!
What a voice and songwriter. Unreal
Don't loose your people Oliver
Absolutely love your music. I love the raw sound to your voice! Keep going please!
10k views in 20 minutes...
God bless you Oliver and your family.
You just keep moving me. Forward. "THANK YOU"
Instant Americana Classic! (listening from Taiwan)
🙏😊
Bummer he diddnt have an old chev for the video.
O joy ❤We finally have some real country music 🎶
Please stay true to yourself and in that narrow path.
love it
“Zen cone” is the best euphemism for pot I’ve heard in a while!
Wish I could find a good woman like that, God has blessed you well in this life.
Perfect
🇺🇸🙋‍♀️🐴🍃 In the Country every chance I get and a great song to get there. ❤
God bless you, sir.
Comparing a girl to a 90’s Chevy… Is genius!   There’s gonna be a lot of girlfriends and wives I hate this song, while us guys love it because we get it! Lol!
Blessings!
This is a damn treat. Classic folk country song. Dont even need a band to feel the music here.
I’m an absolute listener ! Chris thanks for sharing your thoughts with us! Your biggest fan Buffy from Kentucky!!
Chris, thanks for speaking for a nation. #LiveEpic
👏👏👏bravo
Please redo a version of "I've got to get sober".
Yes fantastic!  We have a 90 some Ford 150, with no payments, not so good paint but comes with no payments. LOL so many people have asked us to sell them that truck.....NOPE.
💜💜
I really like the video on this one.
Who else had this song give them goosebumps
Stay Straight. Keep Your Head. Don't Kiss The Ring.
You truly are a gifted artist ❤ It's because you are singing everything from your heart and soul. It just comes out so easily and flows ❤ Raw, real, simply perfection
Love it!!!!
Do it ole son
Cool song. I dig it. Thanks man!
Killing it man.  Keep it coming! 💯🔥
I miss my 90 something convertible Cavalier now
Thanks, Chris!
Best artist in the country was just chilling on a farm in Virginia a couple weeks ago. Wild.
👍👍
Yeah boyyyyyy!....you are for real something big brother. I'm really digging your music. If I could only get that pinky hammer down right on that D cord.
You need to write a ballot 😁
Proceeds to show a GMC. 😆
Thank you, Chris, for putting yourself "out there", for the sake of humanity! Lord Jesus, surround Chris & his loved ones, with the white Light of Your Holy Spirit, keeping him safe from ALL harm! Amen!
I have a 94 chevy Z71 and my dog rides shotgun with me all day brother!!!...rock on!!!
And the hits keep coming  Love the authenticity  Skew the Fantonos and the haters!
hit after hit after hit. watching you rise to fame has been a fun ride. i wish the best for you!
The independent music you’ve been pumping out shows how irrelevant big labels are now.  They can’t stop your reach!
Wow, epic storytelling!
That’s right! Love your song.
I have two 90's Chevy's.
Fudge Rounds
I hate how getting high is a normal part of our culture. It’s so sad.
Proverbs 4:20-27 KJV   Jesus Christ is the only way. GOD Bless 20 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. 21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart. 22 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh. 23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. 24 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee. 25 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. 26 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. 27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.
keep it up bro!!!
Thank you so much!  Maybe I won't wake up with 'Cussin' myself, every damn day' running through my mind now...😇
Thanks Chris. Enjoy your Labor Day, too, with your "Darlin".
This guy is taking over 💯
This song is inspiring me to get my 90 Chevy 1500 running again. Slow ride to this song. It may be hard to hear over the tires burning
White people.
Man, you're just knockin' them hits out, aren't ya?  keep em comin'~!
Insane talent
well this is a nice surprise on a saturday morning
Wonderful
I love your voice, great song. Loved it.❤
I just sat here and listened to this song 3 times and it’s only been posted for 20 minutes. I love this song and the sound and the lyrics. Your voice is something special young man!

"Load up the dogs and listen to the crows talkin' down at the creek" now that's livin' it
Ya know, I'm getting a few years on me now, and I have to say it's been some time since I heard music that really just reached out and grabbed me right by the heart. This music sure does it. It's just something pure, and genuine about it I guess. Im glad im here to hear it.
Good work Son
Dated a girl and when she came over we’d take the dogs to the creek like that. Good times :)
Thanks for the song, With all this attention, I hope you survive unchanged. 😩🥱😑  I mean if you’re adick, being less of adick would be a good change
Chevy, Girlfriend, the dogs and camping... I'm onboard.
Wow! Just beautiful , specially that voice!❤️😌
Damn  he is good love this man and the natural way he sings through you and calms your mind in a hectic world
THE $1,000,000 voice of todays #MURICA . Take care and keep spreading that message. <3
😍🤩Thank you for being YOU!  I can't sing well at all (ask my critters), but I sing along with you like I can!
Thank you Chris. God Bless you brother.
Great song Chris, I have an 88 GMC pickup with over 200k. It's been a good truck. I bought from my wife's dad a few years before we got married. Almost 30 years later and I plan on holding onto both forever.
thank god for america
Chris is really out here making country music great again.
Brand new recording!  Gorgeous!  Not a brand new song--this one was out a while back on the cell phone recording.  Doesn't matter--wonderful song, nice new recording.  Thanks, Chris!
Good to see you keeping true to yourself and following the Lord... 💜💍💜
❤ Carter and Cash! I love this!!!
I absolutely love how Chis's music resonates with the average American. 🇺🇲
AWESOME!😀
❤
Thank you so much could you write a song about me I’m a teenager Eagle Scout I am a girl always have be always will be people try to pressure me to be a boy or be a lesbian but I am not  Also I am the only one in my class that stands up when we are supposed to say the pledge of allegiance if so sad no one wants to hear about America be a good country anymore especially the new kids as I mentioned I am Isabelle miller from Okc an Eagle Scout that loves god and Jesus and actually appreciates America
Love this one ☝️ ❤
Great tune! This man is killin' it 🔥
Remember when all country music was this good?
Easily just became one of my few favorite artists.  Thank you for your inspiration.
WOW...that's 🔥. Sexy and romantic.  Cool Chris.  Good one, good timing.  Smart.  GOIN STRONG.
Damn this man is great at making music

Love love love 💙💙💙
Does anyone know where we can find a touring schedule for Oliver Anthony?  Thank you in advance! 💞💫
Great song! How in the hell do you get such great sound outside?
Man, you just keep on hitting the nail on the head and tugging heartstrings.   I don't know if it's just bc I'm in the Piedmont too and blue collar but your music hits me just right. This video looks like it's shot at my ole creek.  It's providential how you're touching so many and spreading a good message with it. We'll keep praying for you.
Oliver, thank you for sharing your beautiful music 😊🎉
Love it man. Keep changing the world.
Yup this is going into my car riding music. Right up there with Hot Rod Lincoln,  One piece at a time,  and many more of them awesome songs that you just wanna cruise to
Incredible.
I just more recently started getting into folky/country music...and I can't stand the mainstream shit.   This man is a fucking gem! Keep doing your thing brother! People are listening!
Some rich basturd somewhere is getting a migraine trying to figure out how to make this one political and divisive.
Love it. My mom  had a old 50s Chevy. On our farm. ❤❤❤
Love when the music isn’t drowned out by the glitz and glamour of the industry!!!
🇺🇸
Am I allowed to supply this music with a beat, chors and maybe even some banjo and violin?
Oliver, thank you for being a voice for us. I sweated, i cried, i worked to this point because I thought it would be worth the blood sweat and tears. Been welding for 4 years now, and I have a job that used to be good money. But prices are so high on everything most weeks I don't even have money for food.
RIP Jimmy Buffet
Love the lyrics and melody!!
This guy is just amazing,  from what rock did he magically crawl from underneath,  he's going straddle to the top on his own, he doesn't need much help if any
"She's hotter than Hell, I'm higher than gas" 💪💪💪
Oliver, thank you for being a voice for us. I sweated, i cried, i worked to this point because I thought it would be worth the blood sweat and tears. Been welding for 4 years now, and I have a job that used to be good money. But prices are so high on everything most weeks I don't even have money for food.
The timber in your voice is out of this world. The human you are is like a tidal wave over this planet. We all love you. Unreal lyrics, music, voice and testimony.
I think this man is a great man, and yes I said man!!🇺🇸
Every part of the scenery in this video is like heaven.  And the tent in the background,  where can I get one?
Good song, keep up the good work.
The dude gives me chills!! Love it, brother. Keep to your roots!
His best song yet
In ~ca. 2004 The first Shooe fell when Apple droped iTunes on the World. Brining the touch of death to your then favorite Record Shop. At the time some People were prophesing the end of the entire Music Recording Industry,  when someone could come along, and find out they didn't need to sell their Soul to the Labels.   In 2023.... That other Shooe just dropped... I bet there are Men in Suits slowly pooing themselves in the slow realisation they really are the Dinosaurs, and the Meteor is inbound.
so refreshing and so real.  thanks Chris your grandpa Oliver would be so proud~*
I love gay men north of gaymond
The heart of the country speaks out!!
Thanks
Love the music can listen all the time
Great song!! Thank you ❤️ love your music 🎵💕
Happy Labor Day weekend you all  😊
Another great one.  I love how you've went past the business' nonsense and took music back to what it was supposed to be - Songs.  Just an instrument and singing.  Individual meaningful moments presented honestly.  Not packaged and polished 3 album deals with leeches sucking the soul from those moments.  Well done!  And thank you for quoting Scripture on JRE.
Commenting for the algorithm
Christopher great song. Watched you on Joe Rogan and found out that your name is not Oliver.
the simplest of times in life seem the most  memorable
This will make you throw rocks at Rich Men North of Richmond.
just simple and wonderful..keep channeling it!
God bless you love from Canada brother
Chris keep it just you and the guitar.  It is the magic.  Nothing else is needed and would detract. Keep hammering Brother.
So much talent
Keep pumping them out chris ❤❤❤❤ we need you more than you know and God has sent you to us 🙏🙏 whew you can play that Dobro ❤ cracks me up hearing people call it a guitar 😂   PS I love how you live off the grid. It is the most beautiful piece of gods Country ❤❤
cool song
I'll  NEVER get tierd of you're voice!😢❤ ✌️ . Awesome song ! Mr.O.A.
Thank you for the music. I just lean back and smile and enjoy and for one second I almost feel live we live in a normal world.
Keep doing what you do brother.... Fuck the big music companies and politicians
Hell yeah.... 🔥.
Man he never fails every song is golden. 🤘🍻
Every song is another gut-punch to the music industry's processed and manufactured crap.
Brilliant
Remember man: you aint gotta do nothin you dont wanna. Stay true to you and yours brother
Love all your songs Chris.  Keep them coming brother. Makes me wanna buy a case a beer and fire up the brush pile. And I don't even drink. But there's plenty of brush to burn from hurricane Ian and idalia
Man this song is amazing, I live in a tiny little town in Texas and it does seem the same old chevys have been here for the last 20 years plus I’ve lived  here still seem to  keep on going, besides the truck aspect this really does capture what country living is man
Another great song 👍
Love it brother
Another great song!! Keep singing and preaching the truth. I appreciate you more than you know. Thank you.
That is one fuzzy face. I wanna pet him like a dog
You have a really amazing voice. Thanks for making such great music.
My guy!!! I am amazed by your talent!
Wow… 🎉❤😊
Really great song Oliver my brother God bless you .
Somewhere in your ancestry are  fierce red headed vikings, you honor them by picking up the sword of truth and justice.
His music and lyrics are just so refreshing for the soul.
Very nice
Please don't stop singing your truth for those of us thirsting for it and needing to hear it. We enjoy you, your style, love you brother!  God bless
Music with actual soul teemed to it🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love it!
Every drop is an absolute banger. The consistency is so amazing. Pure talent.
Aaaaaand cue the salt!  You have now both offended and excited leftist and 'conservative' women everywhere.   This may end up your biggest song.
We like our guns here in VA.
Oliver Anthony is the man for the people!
You had me at Zebco.  🎣😎 Or did I mis-hear that?
Great music Chris. I have to say, I was shocked when you stated that Camping with Steve is one of your favorite youtubers. I went to school with Steve and so I had to immediately send him the link. He seemed genuinely honored that you brought him up on Rogan.
good luck to you sir on your journey, i wish you all the luck in this world.
Hell yeah
Write a sing about stolen elections and coke in the white house.
Great and what a  amazing voice
We’re all listening sir keep doing what your doing 💗
Another instant classic.  Great work Chris, keep bringing back honest and real music ❤
Thank you Oliver Anthony, for your Grandson Christopher who has single handedly brought back REAL COUNTRY MUSIC, your 1 in a million young man 1 in a million, Bless-ed is the man who sings his heart out honestly, Sincerely, a Granny, Ky.

Best one yet. Keep’’em com’n
DUDE!  You went from 50 followers to 740K in a month.   It takes folks years to get there.   Your music is resonating with many of us.  Keep Jesus #1 and stay true to your music craft and artistry.
Excellent song! My husband always says I'm in his name... like the property 😂😅😂 because I always tell him I'm only his... and this song is exactly what you look for when you are in love!  I love this!
Support from French❤
Well shit if that don’t just hit right!
Music from the heart has a better beat and a true message.  Thank you for shining a bright light on the world, Chris.  It's needed.
Dadgum.  This is just straight up good azz music.  Keep them coming.
Rock on Chris!!!!! You keep doing it man. Love the voice!! I normally don't like this kind of music, but you have a sound that is just awesome!
Love your music brother keep rocking!!!🤟
That old country voice is something else
I liked the first version better, you put a little more into it.
I COULD LISTEN TO  YOU SING ALL DAY!!! REMINDS ME OF SIMPLER TIMES WHEN I WAS A KID. WE USED TO SIT AROUND AFTER A GREAT MEAL & SING WHILE THE ADULTS PLAYED ON GUITARS. GOOD TIMES!!❤❤❤❤
Bro the reason your music is so good.... your original.... you shop and eat at the same places I do I'm sure lol.... just keeping it simple and real ...normal people get beer and go to the lake bc that's kinda what you do then have a fish fry ... it's american 🍻😎🚬
This is my favorite one. Awesome stuff Chris!
Real country music for a change.  Thank you
I’m looking forward to seeing how you talk about your newfound fame.  I know you haven’t had time to write anything in the last three weeks, but if you had little faith in the powerful before, it’s gotta be rock bottom now.
God bless you and your family from Big Texas.
🔥 I love it. I think the world is hungry for more of this!!
Your music brings humanity to those who listen brother. Thank you
So glad he re-recorded this in high quality. Great song.
Music from the Soul, For The Soul
🎉❤ Thank you Chris, I think you’re amazing!
Great job Chris!
I got up with this song stuck in my head this morning.... saw that we lost Jimmy Buffet and then saw this video release. So many emotions this early on a Saturday morning.... 😊
Brilliant!
I hope Gretsch do right by you. My mate runs a guitar shop here in the north of England and he's already taking orders.
WOW!! Another great song. You're on fire!!
Good one again  brother 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏼🙏🏼
give me a bubbling brook and I am home.
Love you man, I haven’t felt this strongly about an artist since Sturgill praying for your continued success.
Yep, get high on cheap beer and fornicate in the back of an old Chevy! What a great message for young people...
Beautiful folk music, gorgeous lyrical talent here folks. <3 ;)
NICE!
You are the man
Great song! 👍🏼 your music is just so pure.I love it, keep it coming and best of luck with everything!!
The first song I heard was great because of the message, buy the more I hear I thing your a excellent musician. It doesn't even sound like you are using autotune.
Another Incredible Song
Awesome video! This has been one of my favorite tracks so far!  It’s gets a lot of play in my truck while I’m driving!
Wasn't expecting to be blessed with another one so soon thanks man keep doing what you're doing and God bless 🙏
Very few things sound nicer than an old 350
yoooo lets go a new song
Oliver head on down to SC 💪 lower parts 😂
Wonderful song! I love that you are putting the pups in the videos! You voice penetrates! God Bless You!
I can't belleve how much he's exploded on the scene and how scare the politicians are of his message. He's uniting the USA back together and they can't stop it. They know their power trip is over and they are on the way out.
Tell them boi! Putting the South of VA on the map!
I love 'at..
Another song to relate to I don’t think he’s ever gonna stop, nor would I want him to keep it up Chris you’re doing good. Keep that good head on your shoulder don’t ever change.
Nice! Keep it coming man! You’re starting a new wave of music. Time for us to get back to reality.
@Oliver Anthony ❤ God is just using you son to reach peoples hearts. People need that same Salvation you've just experienced in giving your life to God thru Jesus Christ His only Begotten Son. 🙏 love & prayers for your faith to grow and for you to be Born Again filled with the Holy Spirit .

Beautiful song. ❤
You can't fake inspiration.  You can't fake from the heart.  Be inspired people --- Cuda       @jigsquad

Another awesome song, keep being you man.
Another haymaker... keep em' coming brother you're music is awesome.

My little brother likes your music a lot apprently since he was in the room while I played this and he started jumping around just now. He's 2 just about 3.
Gosh darn I love this music. I think all these songs hit deep bc they feel authentic. It’s not some Uber rich country singer talking about driving a beat up truck with no money.
nice! keep it up good man!
"Behind every great man is a great woman."
Best studio ever! Great..😁
This is great, Oliver. 👏 👏 👏
I am also a frog-listener. I feel that we are bonding lol.
Ah yeah ..the ole Zebco.. ✌️🙏
Every song is like fresh air to this world.
Straight up awesome!!❤🎶🪕

Any woman worth her salt will understand what high praise it is to be compared to a Chevy 350. :)
🤟🏽👍🏼❤️‍🩹
Good job Oliver, I drive 68 Chevy and work a 49 9n ford no up loads except a fuel filter

My old 1990 Chevy K1500 had 310,000 miles in her when I sold it. Still running...
You are killing it brother! Keep em coming! 🤛🏾
Amazing keep fighting brother! GODS WORK!
Congrats man. Hope things keep going up for you.
Thanks for putting the Country back in country
Another one to sing along... ❤
Not a big country/folk music fan, despite living my whole life in Tennessee, but you, sir, have joined Chris Stapleton in winning me over through your soul filled music. 💁🏻‍♀️💕
This is so refreshing to hear!
2th Amendment!! 👍 🤠 🇺🇸
This guy throws some bangers out.
Great job man! You are making many of us happy with your talent. Thank you! I think we all kinda need this right now. :)
KEEP DOING THE LORD'S WORK, BROTHER!!!   YOU ARE NEEDED, WATNED, AND LOVED <3
Much Love to You, Oliver,or Chris, which ever you prefer, but it's ALL the Same. WE are ALL loving you from the Appalachian Mountains in South Central Pennsylvania Somerset Pa USA ❤️ No matter where you Roam, Jesus Christ Our LORD and SAVIOR,goes with You and His Love covers ALL. You may not quite understand or realize that You are Changing the World.Unity is what We Need 😊🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💯💯💯💯💯💯
Chris is that a White Duck behind you? I want one.
I raised in the city by parents from the hills.  I'm 56 now, but your music speaks to me on a cellular level.  The authenticity is everything.  love you, Chris.  So happy the republicans put you in that debate and introduced you more fully to EVERYONE.  Peace to you my brother from the holler.
It hits us hard because he's playing what we're all living 🙏🤟
Hearing this reminds me of the checy S10 and the things i did in that truck eight now.  This isnt really singing. Countryfolk dont call this music that. WE call it "sangin'".  Whatever you want to call it Dont stop doing it.
I got your ticket money ready when you tour to GA.
I feel your soul!
Great jam
Media pundits: “so this song is about communism being bad and how school teachers should carry semi automatics”
Love it  !
Yeeeewwwwwyeeeeeeeee
✌️❤️&🍀 from England mate 👍
I had two and they were both great trucks. The last one a 1999 I had for 18 years. It got me and my boys threw a divorce, a finder bender or two, College, the military, dates for the boys, moving them and me several times! Liking your music a lot Oliver. Thank you
Keep 'em coming Chris! Great songwriting, Brother. God bless you.
You can tell he's a poor hillbilly. They the only ones that like Chevy or someone who doesn't know any better.
I'm not even a country music fan and here I am, listening happily to Oliver Anthony. Beautiful. Thank you.
Your voice and message are pure gold.  Don't let them give you money to control your message and silence you.
Keep it good, keep it honest... 🎶🪕❤
I hope those fat fuckers on welfare are shaking in their boots when Oliver takes up the Oval Office and rips em a new one #fudgerounds
From Apache Oklahoma 👍🏼 Your s*** hitting home my friend Like for real 👍🏼💯 Thanks Oliver Anthony AKA-Chris u-da-man!!! 🙏🏻❤️✌🏾💯
Case of beer and a Zebco.  That's all I needed to hear.  Thanks
Damn. This hits. This is THE GENUINE SHIT. Right on brother!
I'm patiently waiting for the remake of "I've Got to Get Sober".
I never liked the frat boy country.  This is not that
Love the song.
You move ALL of us with your music brother.  A true American hero

As a libertarian I appreciate your honesty the GOP always wants' to jump on every bandwagon
Rogan was right you don't have to worry about sh*t, I like this one best so far.
Chris, thank you for reading the Bible on Joe Rogan.....and everywhere you go.  Who knows how many hearts and minds will open because of it. May God pour His favor and blessings on all you do.
Already know all the words to this song. Love the vid where you're hanging out 'round the fire with friends. Just like home.
Alright! That was fantastic! 🎉🎉🎉
