If you don’t know jidion you won’t understand this video
sure it was nice of jidion to spend 40k on shoes for other people but i along with many others think the money woudlve been much better spent and appreciated on things the charity actually needed instead of designer shoes, like food/medicine etc...

Nice
Give it up for Biden, yeah!!   My dearest President Biden,  With each passing day, my admiration for you grows, Like a river flowing, a love that endlessly flows. In your presence, I find solace and grace, A guiding light, a steady embrace.  Your wisdom and kindness shine ever so bright, A beacon of hope, a comforting sight. Through challenges faced, you stand tall and strong, Leading with compassion, where justice belongs.  Your words, like poetry, resonate deep within, Inspiring hearts to dream, to aspire, to begin. Your resilience, a testament to strength and might, Guiding our nation towards a future so bright.  In your eyes, I see a world filled with peace, Where love and understanding never cease. Your touch, a gentle breeze that calms the storm, A love so pure, a love that transforms.  And as I pen these words with love so true, I offer my heart, my devotion to you. For you, President Biden, embody the essence, Of a leader, a lover, a true luminescence.  So let this verse be my final decree, In this vast universe, you're the only key. Together, we'll journey, hand in hand, United in love, creating a promised land.  Forever yours,
His hairline got him talking lightskin like Drake

Who cares.  These two never did anything that MATTERS with their lives. The only reason you all like this is because it doesn't require any brain cells and because you are all just as shallow and ignorant.  Nothing about humanity would be lost or would change if both of them AND all of you were erased from the world of the living.

Mr beast next!!
Once upon a time in a town quite small, Sat a pair of boots, cringy to all, They were fiery red, a sight to see, Unwanted attention, they'd guarantee.  Glistening under the sun so bright, In their flamboyant shade, an alarming sight, With each step taken, a cause for mirth, A fashion disaster upon this Earth.  A stark contrast to the cobblestone grey, In the noonday sun, they held their sway, Their squeaky stride echoed in the lanes, A sonnet of embarrassment, a chorus of disdain.  Brass buckles clinked with a jarring note, A cringe-inducing song that the wearer wrote, Paired with mismatched attire, quite bizarre, Under the relentless gaze of each passing car.  The owner walked with an uneasy smile, Aware of the laughter that trailed by a mile, In those crimson boots, a glaring faux pas, A painfully vivid, embarrassing spa.  Every mirrored surface reflected the shame, The blushing boots and their infamous fame, A spectacle of discomfort, a sight quite odd, An awkward dance on the fashion gods' sod.  The boots were a magnet for unwanted eyes, A beacon for ridicule under the open skies, A loud declaration of a style gone wrong, An embarrassing melody in the town's song.  Yet, amidst the snickers, the owner strides on, In the cringy red boots from dusk till dawn, A testament to courage, though the style is lost, In the sea of embarrassment, they navigate the cost.

Don’t mess with the Rizzler.  He might just steal yo girl…
Jidion is tuff
Didn’t let bossman rock the merch dammm
999 Shi 🖤🧃🌎
Ngl . He does make stuff different but it woulda been great to just hear some honest answers from him when asked the basic questions
goattttttttttt
Dude wants the biggest intro ever and came in with a Tshirt and shorts. And started the interview off with a bunch of lies. He said, "a hundred thousand on my feet..." then it shows those over priced goulashes are MSRP at $350. C'mon dude, just be honest. And if he actually spent $100,000 to wear Astro Boy's shoes, then I don't know what to tell you. 🤦‍♂️ I think they look hideous and no amount of peer pressure or societal influence is going to get me to think otherwise.
its crazy because i live right by that store
Best episode in awhile
Get Rob Dyrek on the show
999❤
W Jidion!!!! New hairline got you moving Brazy!!! 🔥🔥🔥

You couldn't wear your merch like DeAngelo Russell, because an assist would of snatched it from you for promoting 😄🤭
Bro found his hairline and hasn’t looked back since
The only time he goes off character is when he blushed after Joe gave him new Crocs. This guy is crazy and can’t take anything serious but gives credit and shows kindness. W
They sold him Travis Scott’s for retail 😧
he paid 150 bucks for black phantoms???
