Just to get knocked out lol i think the face off took longer the fight did lmao
Now 11 minutes vs usyk 😂
Just been broken by usyk
2 times
“TIL DIS DAY!”… bro still yelling “2x’s” 😂😂
How come Fury doesn't look two inches taller?
Fury is shorter than Wilder Is he really 6ft9? In real he's max 6ft6.5 or 6ft6
now people hating on fury with his face off w usyk
Tyson ain't no 6 foot 9
knocked out 2 times two times hahahahhahahahhaha
Two time one time
Love how the Fury squad in unison start cussing Wilder’s team as they walk out😂😂
tu ta tu ta tu ta tu ta tu ta
Whoever keeps sayin 2 time needs to get KOd
Wilder hearing cracked bones ASMR
fury isn't 6 feet 9
I almost die laughing when  I seen this face off
Legends say that Deontay's coach still saying "2 time"
Fury is not 6'9
Bomb squad, he can’t hear you lol
That jackass clapping saying yay we won cracks me up every time
Tyson would've died on that stage. He wasn't fucking leaving. Just like his sauna story with Wladimir
Two time?
They got some samoan security. Uso with the long hair just waiting haha
Tyson stood his ground. Wilder stop the song and never play it again.
It’s like the captains are facing off and the first mates arguing 😂 4:32
Fury dragon  lol
shit gets intense especially when both squads get up😂😂😂 shit looked revolutionary
I only heard *chu cha* 🤣
Hate when you get stuck on the loading screen
Listening to Shane going off at that two time txxx its just brilliant. I hope he gets to shutting him up cause it will only take one time. Buuuuuuum Squuuuuuuuaaaaat. Pack of shit houses. lol
Well that so called 2 time didn't age well🤣
Tyson whooped that ass!
Legend has it, the face-off continues "TO THIS DAY!"
No one can beat Fury
Lmfaoooo I love these dudes don’t let me down wilder
Whys he saying two time to fury who is actually a two time 🤣🤣
Fury can’t be knocked out put everything on fury by decision and thank me later
😂 it’s like a movie
This is not a fitness competition this is a heavyweight match. Deontay Wilder is in for a long night...
Tyson's body shape tho lol..... Reminds me of Greggs manager 🍰
How is fury a big flab of fat but has such amazing endurance
I’m not giving you my headphones buy your self a new one
Le faltó el Grito a Wilder 😅 😅 😅
It's 2 inch height difference between them officially ,but they seem to be equal in height according to me 🤷‍♂
Wilder perderá nuevamente es mejor boxeador fury
Headphones and sunglasses on after not speaking, what a fucking twat.  He's ready in your head Beyonce Wilder.
2times......    And yes u lost both..... Topical Americans they come with the bigger than life shit,that always backfires......   I think he's getting his next career advice from r Kelly on his headphones......
Fury a l’air vraiment très énervé…là il ne plaisante plus !!! Wilder n’as pas l’ombre d’une chance,Quand il comprendra qu’il n’a eu qu’un seul adversaire valable dans sa carrière et c’est Tyson Fury !!! STiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiL WBC heavy weigth champion of the World !!! Au lieu de répéter 2 Times il devrait dire 3 Times qu’il se fait surclassé !!!
Fury beat Wilder mentally here.  Wilder realized Fury wasn't going to quit, just like Klitschko did in the sauna.
Got Booker T in the building..... 2 time 🙈
*This stare-down reminds me of the sauna story with Klitschko.* Wilder forced the face-off to be as long as it was, and Tyson realised that and stood patient, until Wilder broke and walked away.
*I sincerely hope Tyson Fury beats this delusional racist clown!* Wilder made every accusation and excuse because he couldn’t handle that fact he got dropped by and lost to a White man, just like he did after his got dropped at the Olympics. He’s a racist clown!   We need Fury vs Usyk, AJ vs Wilder, Ruiz vs Whyte, Parker vs Wallin.
Fury have 2 bellys …
"They pull they cameras out an got damn they snap ii use to want this thing forever yall can have it back" Ye
jesus so happy i get to have a happy jolly weekend
Can that guy only count 2 time 🙈
It seems that Wilder is taller than fat boy Tyson fury
Bombbbbbbb squadddddddd
I’m betting $300 Wilder by KO 👊🏾 NYC
My money on deontay wearing the headphones so tyson doesnt get into his head. His safe space headphones
Wilder you bum dosser Fury will beat you up
I'm on wilder all the way
And besides Tyson looks sloppy and has a cave man shape
He knows he is in biiiiiig trouble
Tyson is scared out his mind because he know he got caught cheating and knows he gonna get his tail whipped badly he was smirking at first but he saw the killer look in Deontae’s eyes
How many time did Fury beat Wilder? 4:30
Tyson is so bomb 🙌
Wilders chicken legs are big problem
"0-2" didn't they draw the first fight... Can't be 0-2
Beat them Wilder 😜
That's where Fury won the fight.
Wilder listening to gandam style
Smile 🤣 this will be fight to finish.
Wow
Wilder should’ve educated himself on the Sauna story before trying to outlast Fury.
I hope fury wins by ko
Wilder gonna be like “my legs!  The headphones were to heavy!”
Wilder lost the blinking contest too smh
Fury is only fat, no muscles.
Tyson Furry yess
Folk can say what they want but, if you know boxing you know that Fury has mastered the fundamentals, the basics. Deontay trainers just sent him out in the boxing world with just a right hand. If Wilder has gotten the fundamentals mastered like Fury has along with a right hand. He’d be a serious problem for anyone. You’ll get outclassed in anything if you don’t learn the basic fundamentals. Unorthodox is cool but it’ll always come down to the fundamentals in anything especially when someone take you in that deep water. I have respect for both fighters. I just hope it’s a great fight, they come out safe and have more gain to take care of their families.
to tah! to tah! to tah!....
I think both will kiss each other 😁😁😁
Fury has Wilder's number. He outclassed him completely in their 1st fight and he won very comprehensively the last fight. So what's going to be any difference this time. Nothing at all. I see no real demand in this 3rd fight. I can't see Fury losing.
David Goggins would have a lot to say about those headphones...
Shane fury doesn't mess about
Can't wait to watch this bout , this is do or die affairs
What is it with this wilder fan's  claiming fury cheated?what is it?fury cheating or  heavy  outfit?,get a better excuse for the 3rd fight.
Tyson the furyyyyy🤣🤣🤣
Booooomb squaaad🤣🤣🤣
Tyson il va se faire démonter ,wilder il a l'air enragé, ça promet
Deontay is a embarrassment to champions who took a lost
Legend has it they are still in a face off in zoom
Wider is scared that’s why he’s trying too avoid listening & making eye contact in his surroundings, hence the head phones & sunglasses 🕶  Phycology 101
fury o pantolon ne kasfdjfalkabdjckacbjd .
2 time
That face-off is longer than my whole career.
Wilder lasted longer in this stare down than he’s gonna last in the actual fight if he really believes all his own bs.
Where's the romantic background music?  They literally reunited after a long break
Wtf happend to this fight?
Bummmm squaaaad
I don't even understand why this fights happening. it would be a shame for ferry to lose on the third fight beating Wilder 2 times already.....
This is how I wait for the cashier after buying a shit load of groceries 😅🤣 just waiting for the total
When two animals looking at each other the big bear vs the lion is going to be an incredible fight 💪🏿
Legend has it that the stare down was so long their souls traded places , fury now wonders why he likes corn bread and deontay now lives in caravan
Aboth of them are stupid🤣
Usyk vs fury is what we really want. Forget about wilder. Ruiz would beat Wilder
Wilder win KO 💪
Lol that afro guy getting more angry then Fury and Wilder.
Legend has it they are still staring each other down
Fury were s shoe lifts in he's shoes he's no 69 more like 65
poor wilder hope his  mental battle  from the last fight won't get into his nerves and eat him
He was bored, not frightened. They reminded me of two school boys I used to know; one was black and the other was white. They both had a reputation for being hard lads; still it makes for good entertainment!
Who wants to see curly hair from Fury’s side camp vs nipsey hussle look alike from Wilder’s side?
Deontay gonna land this time with everything he’s got. This man is going down swinging because I’m damn sure he’s told the head coach and his corner “no towel”
Wilder is on smoke. 💨💨💨💨💨💨💨
Wilder got shoes to make him taller 😂
If looks could kill they'd both be dead.
Fury bout to damage what brain Wilder has left. Wilder can't beat that man and he knows it
Wilder is going too be like a Pit Bull too Fury
Wilder looks so mad
And legends say they are still standing till this day😎
6:02 lmao
You'd think Wilder ignoring Fury's remarks would be a good thing, a step up. But unfortunately he's wearing headphones and wearing sunglasses, two signs that Wilder still wouldn't handle the pressure if Fury started bombarding him for a third time, rather than manning up, Wilder actually stooped down a few notches.
Tyson looks a little more definede,you can kinda see that abs,the chest is sticking out and the arms,well we've always been able to see furys arms but he hasn't really changed, he's always been a but defined just people don't really look properly He looks like gru from despicable me
wilder knockout fury 100%
wilder walked away....i feel like the towel will be thrown again ..FML
Two time ko again🤡🤣
Sono cazzi stavolta per fury
Wilder: my sunglasses were too dark tint. Thats why i couldnt do the stare down
Cant wait to see this fight in 2027!
Fury broke wilder right there
This is the longest face off I have seen
Wilder scared wearing glasses headphones & everything else 😂
They need to have one Final fight to settle this all once and for all after this one
This time wilder will be knock him i think
Looking at his character, wilder will commit suicide or quit Boxing if he doesn't win this time
That two times dude is annoying AF
We all want to see this fight.. but being honest. I have it 2-0 Tyson.
Those flicks of the cameras 😂👍 can't wait for this fight. ohhh Weeeeeeh
After wilder went away  Tyson: okay who's next😂😂
Chad Fury vs Incel Wilder
Intense indeed wilder maybe pregnant now
This going be a war
Yoooo why is a wilder standing like that I’m dead 😂😂💀 he said: 🚶‍♂️
They didn’t fight the third right or am I retarded
Tuu Taa × 10.
I hope the gloves will be checked in the next fight to be fair.
The only thing I don't like about fury is the fact he had his hands half way in the gloves 1st and second fight , he already had the weight and technical striker advantage no need to cheat, and sometimes he resorts to child like behavior
No time pussy bomb
So then , this proves the pushing and shaving only happens when other people are around them. If you leave them to face off by themselves they restrain themselves.
I like how the first person to step up between em is the 5'2" Mexican dude! 🤣
Wilder tryin so hard to hide his nerves dats shivering so bad inside ... 😂😂
😳😳😱😛
When this fight will happen ?
Fury's body is just too much for wilder to get his punch to affect him or have an impact. Wilder has been mocked alot cuz he brags buh trust me Fury won't go past round 6. Two Knock downs in round 1.
I like it wilder s boss said no he won't face fawerdthey cut that out
Don't worry wilder will knock all the fat of him
Fury gonna knock out again that black muslim Wilder.
Stare down
Ngengekk
pourquoi il reste longtemps comme ça😂
No hate: fat logan paul vs Tall Floyed mayweather jr
Deontay wilder ignore tyson Fury and his trash talk and his mind games you are the champion
Wilder will get him
WHO IS THAT  MORON SAYING  2 TIME OVER AND OVER LIKE A BROKEN RECORD? Does he mean  is he saying  Fury will stop Wilder 2 times?
Wilder got a inch or 2 taller Tyson gotta tip toe
Fury looks very overweight and knows he needs to train hard. The COVID COWARD
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tyson fury has got to be the biggest nonce going 🤣😂
Por k no lo subtitulan
El rey de los gitanos serán de Inglaterra aki España es camarón de la isla
Chuta chuta y gol gol jajajajajaja
K estarían diciéndose con la mirado K lo iba a destrozar la cabeza. Lacho Lacho
Im sorry but furys family and friends or whoever those wastemen were- absolute trash and appalling behaviour.
We can all agree fury aint 6ft 9. He said himself 6ft 7 making wilder around 6ft 6 or less like joshua. Always oversizing for sport
Tyson fury. 💪✌👊🖒😎🇧🇷
Damn wilder left too soon. Bet the headphones were too heavy.
FURY LOOKS LIKE A KID THAT JUST SHIT IN HIS PANTS
have you noticed that wildeer trembles as he takes off his glasses?
who you think will win once and for all
0:50 Boo😂😂
Have to say Fury has the heart strength and no fear  He is a natural born fighter  He fights for his love of fighting and his honour  Always great traits in a fighter
I don’t like that guy Wilder man he is crazy he is going to knock him out next time and check the gloves first off all
Wilder  is the best...? Please
The face off the intense you can cut it with a knife it's so intense you watching TV and you can feel the animosity these two guys do not like you
Tu Ty, Tu Ty, Tu Ty
So many excuses he had to say the slave descendent will lose again here me out .
Holly Shit!!! Me UFC guy watching this stare-down feels, they should have invited Uncle Dana😂❤️😍🥰
Let's Go Bomb Squad !!!!!
Now I know what a fixed fight looks like
Deontay does look the same he looks very focus with pain in his eyes
I think tyson fury is in trouble you guys
Wilder usually does better in rematch. Go watch Ortiz first and second fight. So Tyson second fight loss anomoly could be explained by hit behind bleeding ear. So third fight may end up like first or Wilder wins by KO
Wilder
it is this attitude of deontay which gave covid to fury. this time no cheating
tyson fury just has that unmistakable muscle tone that screams fitness and determination doesn't he?
2xloser
Fight one felt like the historic cheating and of Tom M in England so many years ago.. 3 will be history’s revenge
I prayed for a Wilder Victory ✌🏿…. Y’all stop by my page and show some love … real hiphop lives there …
They’re fighting on my birthday
Most of comments section are English soldiers wilder will beat fury like Italy beats the crap out of you and bring it to Rome
So talepathy is real!!!
Built like a bag of milk...   USA USA USA USA USA!!!!!!! But hey england teach us a quick lesson.. whoop this idiots ass !!
Tyson fury is a weak spineless  coward he temper with the gloves 🧤  two win a fight against Wilder
you should not be tyson fury’s body type and wear skinny jean unacceptable
I think they could be very good friends.
Fury is a professional cheater…he’s gonna get his ass handed to him in this trilogy fight
Furry scared him away!  🤣
Record breaking
How many times Wilder lost   2 times , 2 times , 2imesssss
Staring competition
Tyson "Gypsy Queen" Fury, Faked a sickness and got a note from his mom, like a kid in school who doesn't want to take a test because they'll fail🤣😂...
Fury doesn’t move for the entire time lol crazy how good he is and his style is so different but it’s a masterpiece and yet he looks like a couch potato haha
2 time
Wilder via K.O 5rd. lets go wilder
I thinks its now Fury 7-0 or there abouts.
They boy focus this round
its 1  and 1 for matching the man who breaks the tie is the winner but both of these men are champs.!
Fury looks shook lol he took a big gulp
I bought tickets to see this fight, I bought plane tickets, I reserved a hotel for the weekend, I reserved a car rental and this disgrace of a human being goes and catches Covid19 to avoid the fight. I lost a ton of money because of this disgrace.
THAT WAS A CRAAAAAAAZY FACEOFF
Ayo, how many times?
Słabo wygląda ten cały donatan
So where do y’all think wilder is going to get buried? His hometown right?
They can't stop staring into each others eyes and day dreaming about skipping and holding hands jk
Can’t wait to see Tyson and Joshua...
Tyson knows what hes expecting. Well done to wilder for being proffessional and keeping the spirit of boxing alive. I dont want to say what I think Ilis going to happen but we all know what happens o loud mouths and cheats.  Best of luck to wilder. Hope he wins back what was stolen from him. That day was when boxing academy failed for some sinister reasons. But wilder Carrie's the torch to the light again .
6:33
Make sure Ain't no spring in Fury Gloves This Time of I want to get into boxing if I can  swing my gloves around like a spring
Tyson brought fear to Wilder . Next fight Tyson gona make Wilder humble
The man has already won!!!! It is very clear and sad!!!!!
Winner take all... it's a must win for Wilder
Wilder won this faceoff. Pure determination in his face, while Fury starts joking
Dyontay 👎
I wonder if Wilder will wear a transformers outfit this time
Tyson and Wilder in the zone, .. whilst other numpties try to trash talk.
Lol
TWO TYYYME!
Wilder scared!
Deonte already lost smh he letting him control him he need to focus
Tool time
The legend has it they been starring at each other !till this day!!!
Why did I want tyson say got your headphones 🙈
Tyson gonna win ,😒
No lie you can tell deontay ready focused
Fury doesn’t look in good shape
I can't decide on what's more annoying 'two time' or 'Let's go Champ'.
Wilder still looks disoriented from the shot he took the ear. Did he lose his hearing?
Bomb squad more like BUM squad getting rolled over 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Did wilder grow 3 inches?
Let's get this boring Trilogy over with so we can have the actual Heavy Weight Trilogy of Tyson vs Joshua.
Wilder such a brat. He’s already lost mentally
Tyson won already
If it wasn't for Mark Breland there would have been no second fight for Wilder and its going to be the same thing all over again but this time nobody chucking in the towel.  All the accusations made by Wilder thus far and the wearing of headphones was to dodge those questions on accusations made that would have surfaced.  Wilders replacement trainer for Mark Breland the best advice I'd give him would be "Wilder Keep your distance and protect that head at all times...........Impossible. Both Wilder and Trainer ended up with a busted ear drum well here is number three coming right up.  Unless your bringing something bigger to the party that 18 wheeler Tyson Fury gonna wap yo ass again... Pretty damn fucking poor wearing headphones to a press conference. Maybe its a strategy a statement "I don't need to give away no game plan" Could be one?  If thats the case cut the bullshit you got no plan you lost the fight the minute you sat there saying sweet F.A looking pathetic wearing them headphones which I hope were not too heavy for you. Wilder Protect the head at all times... AT ALL TIMES AT ALL COSTS.
Who is that cheap version of Pablo Escobar standing behind Tyson?🤣
Deep down Deontay SCARED.
Wilders weak he is overrated. The bum squad!!!! Wilder needs headphones for confidence. Typical!
If tyson loses they're going to be alot of mad people. If I said if tyson loses. That's a big if but not impossible.
Wilder looks about 6,9 here
Fury stayed standing because he shitted his pants...
Wilder made fury look like a chump lol
Wilder vs Ngannou 🔥🔥🔥
“Bomb squad” what a bunch of idiots. Wilder was nervous that’s what the glasses and headphones were for.
Bumm squad 🤣🤣🤣
I just finished watching a movie on netflix and these guys are still standing there
Wilder is turning into a psycho. I think he is listening to some cold killing blood swimming song to stuff his head with all hatred thought just for motivation. He has this scary look  the one you see on the face of someone on drugs just about to do something bad for everyone except himself. I think he need help and Fury is the one chosen by God for the job.through fists 👊 the only language these two understand, Tyson should tell him: with clear mind, positive attitude and ascending spirits the human-being will have a better looking eye that see the objects not the obstacles. I really got bored from writing this silly shit i just wish this psyco stuff don’t intimidate Fury. Eventually only work matter.
Wilder is taking this fight this time round?round  That Focus damn
Wilder's people: BOMB SQUAD!!!!! Wilder's inner thoughts: *Nah, come on* 🥶
Feel like fury know he in trouble
Tyson looks like he's about to crush him, no worries, even had hands behind his back, looks so much stronger mentally and physically!
And still
USA!!
Keep repeating 2 times but 2 times he got his ass beat by him and I love watchin deonty but he got his ass beat
I'm saying this right now right here! Wilder will decapitate Tyson Fury... No jokes this guy has so much grudge in him that even tyson fury get that and felt that into his skin! If you look closely Tyson Fury understand that this time it's not just a boxer but this time is a fucking animal that coming after him! 💯
His legs spaghetti, knees weak, armour’s heavy.
From sauna to the staredown story. 🤣🤣🤣
These comments are mad funny. & The guy who said he can't hear you was mad funny. . Yo the world is a effen funny place. I swear this hate shit is outdated bruh. We all should just be hating evil not each other yo. Look at all these different nationalities making me laugh
The ring is the end game 😱☠💀
It's fucced up when you gotta look at somebody built like your grandad who took your belts🤣
Legend has it they are still standing to this day 😅😅🤣
Dose guys stared down ⬇️🔻⬇️
2 times,two times,two times,bra ya so called boy Wilder will get exposed again tko'd!!!!!!! PO'ME COLORBLIND
Tyson Fury is going to beat the brakes off of Wilder again!!!!! PO'ME COLORBLIND
This is gonna be a Epic fight!!  Somebody gonna die!!!😔
They got wilder on sum new shit, it's called controlled shit.
Fury should work on his body 😂🤣😂 bulky pappy🤣😂🤣😅
I think this is love 😉👏👏😭
Lol did someone just say till this day , wilder needs to put a bit of weight on he’s to small again , fury coming in at 300kg Tyson will be to big for wilder
WHATS THIS WHEN WILL BE TYSON FUTY VS ANTHONY JOSHIA THATS WHAT WE WANT
Lmao know one cares joke fight and don't waist your money or time on this nonsense
Some never evolute from the schoolyard..... Wilder is that caricature really
bomb squad shhhhh !! PMSL  #GYPSY KING 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿‼️💪🏼👊🏼🏆SPANK THE YANK 🤣🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Alabama bum boy  needs pay check to pay for a retirement home
Tyson Fury 🍻👊👊
Tyson looks scared
This time I am positive that wilder is gonna knock him down. Like the comment so everyone will see this. 24 July wilder will WIN. I Am betting...
Wilder seems afraid and Fury just don't give a fuck.
Fury ridicolous ..his face when Wilder go Is sad..Because Fury think at movimentated face Off ...Wilder don t have calculate Fury ...Like this , Because Fury Is uselsss
I came came across a YouTube video, it's called TRAINER Reveals WITNESSING Tyson FURY TAMPERED gloves in Camp for Deontay Wilder. That is pretty sick, hard evidence.OMG How did he get away with this?
Fury will win third time in a row.
The Bombsquads run off n left the Gypsies still standing
tuta tuta tuta tuta baaammmmswaaaadddddddd
at home both of them stared at each other and on tha bed thru there pictures
Fury all day
Wilder: My headphones died so I had to walk off.😂😂😂😂
"if I could just get you guys to face forward to the cameras" Yea na not happening 🤣
why in the hell is lebron here
“To this day” 3:12
All y'all who still talking all this shit because you hated to see him Shine I can't wait to see how many excuse y'all come up with when Wilder knocks him the fuck out!!!💣💣💣💣💣💣👑👑👑👑👑🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾💀
hahaahaha the one shouting 2 losses after that guy said 2 time is lowkey funny af hahahaha
Everybody joking Wilder is gonna surprise everybody
wilders legs are like a skinny girls,no wonder he could'nt carry his costume on them,he was scared that the questions would make him as stupid as he looks.Why would you go with a rookie trainer in a fight that if you lose will pretty much retire you? you would have thought you would go to a big name trainer to get ready for this,makes me think it's a money grab with his diver coach,he will let him skate by,he's gonna fight the same way swingimg and missing looking for the one punch finish,you cannot teach a old dog new tricks
I can see fury going down. That boy energy different. His silence speaks volumes
You lot gonna see it’s gonna play out just like aj vs Ruiz 2. Ruiz put on more weight because he wanted put aj to sleep which if you guys watch the interview thats what fury basically said. Then aj went away and got more boxing skills which is what wilders new coach is teaching him and showing him that he shouldn’t only depend on his right hand anyway wilders gonna put fury to sleep.
THAT BOMB SQUAD CHAT IS OVER..
I think Wilder looks thicker, it might be to punch harder and try to smash Gypsy King
My $500 is on Fury all day long .
TYSON FURY is not a DIRTY FIGHTER. I don't believe Tyson Fury uses PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS. I don't believe that Tyson Fury uses EGG WEIGHTS in his GLOVES.
Lol
.
Wilder losing yet another encounter with Tyson. Can't wait for the impending annihilation.
Tyson Fury came out there with that slab of pork hanging out his pants...
wilder went through 2 full songs ATLEAST 😭
those headphones on the whole time were the biggest display of weak mentality
jangan ama lama dong ngeliat nya, tar CLBK lagi
I would be embarrassed to be on Deontay teeem
Why he got shades on at first...man this boy scared
You done cheated and busted my damn eardrum, I'd be looking to hurt you.
Fury lost his mentaly
What's the point of a long stare down?
Wilder will lose again!
Wilder is concerned!
team wilder🤘🔥🔥🔥
Wilder is just odd, has no regards or respect for even the sport.  Didnt answer anything. Comes in wearing headphones.   It's a joke.
Fury looks super uncomfortable for somebody that's claiming they're going to knock somebody out
This vicious
Fury Gulped 4+ times, he loses this.
Fury looks very nerves , he is worried about his gloves . that's why he is training for his punching power cos he does not crack and wilder throws bombs and he knows them very well from first fight . even his dad is worried cos he knows his son cheated on both fights .
I entered a rabbit hole that I never knew existed. There's a video on YouTube called "Tyson Fury Tampered Gloves required padding have been secretly & illegally removed vs Deontay Wilder". This is a MUST WATCH if you want to understand the cheating everyone is talking about.
Silence is HONOURABLE.
I love it when Deontey that always makes noise came to a reality of the philosophy A.J. always told him. LESS TALK MORE ACTION.
Tyson the Champ    Wilder the chump!
I think wilder gone knock him out this time
Can’t wait till wilder knock this man out as a boxer aren’t you supposed to have some type of muscle when fighting and definition Tyson look like he haven’t touched a weight room 😂🤦🏽‍♂️ wilder look like he actually prepared to fight
Tyson just standing there like wtf this guy up to haha
BRO NO WAY THEY FACED OFF FOR 6 MINS WHAT DID I JUST WATCH AHAHAH
Guinness book of records will be calling these guys for the longest Face-Off 🤣🤣🤣
Wilder swaying back and forth....
Fury getting ko in 4 rounds . Deontay will kill fury body 😂!!
Deontay Wilder better fight that man licked his neck he better fight 😂😂😂😤
Tyson is going down this time around. Yee all can yawn and shout but Tyson, gonna lose this battle.
Wilder, muốn Thắng Fury! Thì phải tập trung Cao độ, ra đòn tầm Xa bất cứ ở Điểm nào Cố gắng nhanh lẹ. Nếu ko trúng mục đích, phải nhập Nội liền, tung đòn tầm gần bấc cứ nơi nào....
"Bombswauuuuuud"  And then someone whispered, "he can't hear youuuu" HAHAHAHAHHAHAA
Fury is a culture vulture
As much as it seems like Fury is going to win   This time Wilder will be on fire
was wilder listening to the fugees because i kept hearing an idiot saying 2times lol
Whoever smiles first loses the game🤣🤣🤣
Nothing personal, all business for Tyson . Not for Wilder.
Fury tests positive for PEDs, he does cocaine, he hits illegally behind the head in every fight, the referee forces him to change his glove in a fight,  his goves during the wilder fight flopped in a way I have never seen before.    Wilder remains silent and he's the bad guy. What's wrong with this picture?
I'm I the only one who feels Fury will loose this time. People watch out. I see Blood in Wilder eyes 👀.
Gosh!!! I can see the pain in Wilder eyes and he wants he's belt back fr.. He's on a mission but the thing is can he do it?? Fury is a different kind of beast. This trilogy fight is going to be epic for sure
Beats headphones's new high frequency sound amplifier for people who blew their airdrums.
If tyson ever makes a rap album the curly hair guy can be a perfect hype man.. Love it when boxers corner have same mentality as whats going through his fighters mind.
I hope wilder hurts him badly
Wilder ko his ass this time I see it in his face
I got wilder
I love Deontay, he's a creazy man. 💣😂😂
And STILL!
Bless her she worked up the courage to take her sun glasses off.
Wilder the besttt
I think if Wilder loose this fight I can see him retiring or killing him self
Wilder going to murder his ass
Ffs whats up with the dam headphones Wilder lol
Yea that's pretty intense!!
Man Tyson has got this. Wilder know Tyson has his number 😂. And how could u be a Wilder fan anymore if u was? This dude made every excuse under the sun not to mention jumped on the blm crybaby bandwagon. I'm American but Tyson Furys my guy 👊
How did Fury develop the POWER to DENT the side of a man's SKULL? Can anyone explain? Can any doctor explain? Especially when The fighter is wearing HANDWRAPS and GLOVES. Its so obvious what occurred that night. What's more astonishing is that no one is talking about this. Can anyone EXPLAIN how you can DENT a mans skull with hand wraps and gloves on.
Fury’s team will smash these idiots in 2sec 😂  Wilder broken man 💯
I can't believe Wilder let this extra bacon fat on this back fool beat him smh
I think there still facing of till this day
berlemak pinggang
Fury  should've said: " Those headphones must be getting heavy about now"
I'm surprised Fury didn't bust out laughing thinking about all the excuses Wilder made and seeing him on the canvas bleeding.
I think Fury has forgotten that Donte has that 1 hitter quitter.
Imagine if mark breland showed up and throws a towel when wilder gets beat up 😂😂😂 that would be the greatest moment in sports history 😂😂😂😂
fury is standing, till this day !!!
W
The young uns don't know stared-downs. You cannot flinch or blink or you lose. Not only was Fury shuffling and bouncing and moving his hands about, he gulped at least 3 times. What's that about?
wilder just want to fight and kill fury he was very angry and fury was really surprised !!!!!!!!!!!!
I see the dent...that shit crazy 😡🤦🏾‍♂️
Fury wins the face off. Psychological advantage
Wilder will win
yall kept making fun of Wilder but i bet my whole fortune none of yall would be brave enough to step in the ring with him
Wilder needs to man up and accept he lost to fury twice on clean terms...its just for pride now..
Wilder looks like he gots alot of yes man around him 🤡
Wilder will win this time.. By KO
Wilder is a comedian
Legend has it they continued their stare down on MS Teams for a further hour until Teams crashed.
Total composure < Tyson Fury
That must have been one hell of an abs workout for Fury lol
Who are these against the Bronze Bomber?
Fury is fat! How the heck he got cardio
Deontay wilder need  to  Gym little bit more to challenge Tyson fury..
I could have smashed the old lady ate something and fell asleep and they would still be staring at each other 🤣🤣🤣
🙄🤪
That's a different Wilder now, surely humbled and more of an actual boxer, AJ where tf was that fight at
Ok.. lost the stare down.. let’s make it 2 for 2..
Wilder paid him 10k to say 2 times for 5 mins.
Tool Time...Looks like we got a big Tim Allen fan here
Ohh no its a long boxing staredown
I thought it was a mating ritual on discovery channel
The longest stared own in boxing history wdf
Fury built like a sack of potatoes 🥔.He can fight though so Wilder better bring it leave it all in the ring go all out not accepting any excuses.#TEAM WILDER.
Took the shades off too late not a good sign for wilder
I'll be back after wilder break this guys heart
Wilder came and simply did his job. Took the soul out of Fury and left him staring at no one - I feel Fury felt defeated.
Legend has it the janitor reopened they were there n da next face off happened  they were there the building is a homeless shelter now they were still there
If stare downs have a critical role to play in the fight then the calm confidence plus high-level intensity of Wilder was so so telling!
"Two time", As in the two times Fury already beat Wilder!
Deontay is pissed he took the last fight off didn't prepare himself properly and got humbled by someone on paper he should've beat now he is focused more bc he has to be thats my take on his silence.
Tyson Always Nice 👍👍👍👍🇨🇿😎
Wilder champion👍👍
This is hilarious😂🤣 Wilder seems to have already lost the mental battle. I don't know but I see Fury dominating him once again. Hopefully we'll have AJ vs Fury for the unification bout.
Fury was shaking ....i even felt it miles away
Big bang by two man
Cheating ass fury know he bout to get his ass kick!!! Gypsy Queen ur daddy feel bad u bout to fight him again
اين ايام الزمن الجميل لينوكس لويس و مايك تيسون و هولفيلد لقد تقهقر مستوى الملاكمة
😲 crazy
Looks like white people will dominate heavyweight for 15 years. It was Klitschko for 10 years and now Fury.
If d wild loses after not talking like this I will be so disappointed
Floppy furVs Black muscle!
Annnd annnnnnnnnnd and and and still . Hahaha what a damn shame
Wilder k.o
I wonder what he will say when he gets another TKO on his record. Sue his new trainer, claims racism,claims cheating on tysons side,and much more. Pathetic!
Fury’s team at the end 🤣🤣🤣  “FOUR EYED PRICK!”
Wilder trying to play mental games with fury...He'll lose that fight also!
To the bots in the comment...💩
wilder predator 🔥 win
Your guy got smashed up 2 times hopefully 3 times deontay don't deserve a 3rd fight trus me UK ALL DAY 💯🇬🇧
Damn the mind games wilder already lose
Mam nadzieję że Wilder wpierdoli rudemu
Whole roster of ufc can have face off in this much duration 😂
"Fury in three".
Wilder.đánh hay hơn.
Fury , Youre a cheating fraud! You were scared of getting knocked out so you cheated! Youre a disgrace to boxing.
Hi, i am youtober
Someone spiked the air
I like wilder but just showed me that he is not a real champion if he wins I hope that  do interview him....very  petty wilder real champions faces  everything in life head on true Champs speak even after a lose 💯....get it together bro
Wilder is scared can’t wait to watch him lose again 😂🤣😂🤣
This fight gonna be next level something will happen and I mean big let’s wait till fight night
Fury has it  As much as I want wilder to win I see fear in wilder and fury knows he unlocked it
Tyson fury looks scared as hell. All I see during this stare-down and he won’t be able to cheat this time. Your gloves 🥊 will be checked this time!
Deonte may win this one.
Whatever people say, Wilder looks pissed.   And you should never underestimate your opponent, ever.
Face off? Isn't that a movie where they take each other's face off?
Deontay definitely looks up for it and Tyson is trying to read him. From what I can see Tyson knows this is a different Deontay.
It’s fake  all about business
They should have just cuddled and kiss
fury will break him
was wilder wearing high heels ?  taller than fury here
Wilder has assault beard.
Tyson fury rocks
Damn this will be a war. Wilder don't look Happy...
When the bronze bomber  go win don’t switch sides 💯
He will lose again for sure ..... Deontay has no voice now 😂😂.
I do believe and understand how Wilder is attempting to prove and show to all of us boxing fans that he has regained  his focus  but he wont have headphones on in the ring  with music playing to help him stay mentally poised for action. I do hope he gets in the ring with the ability to box and move around instead of being predictable with his right hand loaded for the hard hit knock out. Fury is very skilled at the basics of boxing and is unorthodox with his movement for his size. Wilder has a lot to prove to himself not us as fans because he’s the one that made senseless excuses instead of just admitting that he lost straight up and that he must train harder and differently. I just want to see a better fight from him and i will respect him more if he takes a loss like he does a win. Which is to keep it real. Salute to both fighters and this will be good for boxing nonetheless
Tyson & his team at the end when someone's mouthing off from the front......"They're all pussies" haha, you tell 'em boys.
Hancurkan pawanmu welder
Before I want fury to humble wilder but now I want wilder to do the same to this loudmouth fool
The real man walks away when a little boy stays.
Fury's 2 rounds up already.
Cocky wilder
I hope Tyson Fury buys an ass after this fight
Bro they are as tall as nba players 😮
Wilder is definitely scare of Tyson. He probably has nightmares fighting him again.🤣
All that fidgeting had Fury looking like a nervous muffin top
E sports boxing club 🥊 fighter select menu
fury bout to beat the breaks off Childer again for real this time
holy shit how the fuck long they face off for jesus christ looks like a staring contest
I thought fury was in better shape??
I’m out here tryna know what these guys got on their mind 🤔 looking at each other lika that can somebody help me ?????
Furu is going to lose this one
Bronze bomber looks like he got bronze in his pants already🤣
Wilder wilder wilder💪👊👍
If my legs were like two bits of string hanging from my belt like Wilder's, I'd would wear such tight legged pants.
No1 wants to see this AGAIN!
Wilder's gona put you to sleep fury...🤒
Up Fury
3:13 "to this day" im weak 🤣🤣🤣
Wilder looks better. As last time.
Wilder protect himself from Fury bloodsack. Wearing headphones.
How many shots. I believe, more, than in fight.
Beauty pants! A like this.
Love that they didn't listen to that girl trying to get them to face forward 🤣🤣 who the fook is that guy
This legit just became a staring contest lol
Wilder is going to f him up. That's all on his mind.
Tcho taym tcho taym  Bruh
Shane Fury is fckin funny man 😂
You know, now that I think about it, I can imagine a bunch of opponents fury's had that probably wanted Wilder's head phones.
Some say wilde been silence is a bad thing I just think he finally learned to keep calm and to me that bad news for fury a focus wilder is a deadly wilder who knows I could be wrong  to 😕 .
One dude was a huge Tim Allen fan, "Tool Time!!!".
I got wilder with the win
the most intensive face off i ever seen.
Im not gonna lie tyson was kinda nervous
This has to be at lease my tenth time watchin this lmao 🤷🏾‍♂️ can’t get enuff
Fury feelin the pressure look at his body language
Fury is great at blinking contests
Shape don't mean shit , as Fury will knockout chicken legs Wilder 😂
Wilder let’s go smash fury I believe in you no talking Look at fury’s face after wilder walks away he knows wilder i coming for him his voice gets soft
Fury really tried to talk trash and wilder wasn’t phased. I think wilder is going to run through fury and fury definitely knows what’s coming. The eyes never lie.
I just hope they don't fuck Wilder again
I'm in better shape than both of them.....
A trilogy with these two doesn’t make much sense. Fury is up 1-0-1. Wilder is 0-1-1…if Wilder wins then it’s the best of four because they will each be 1-1-1…then another rematch will take place for someone to be 2-1-1.
I lost respect for Fury for his gloves tampering cheating. I wondered why his punches looked like slaps
Face off shows Wilder isn't scared of Fury
Tyson Fury's has the best brother in the world!
😂😂😆😆😆🐴🐴🙋‍♂️👍
The next person who comments about headphones has a small willy
Damn, Tyson won the face off too 🤣
Bum squad...  This is how you hype the fight? Wearing headset like a teenage looser... people came to your conference to inform the masses ...  and get nothing? Disrespectful, scared shitles trying not to hear anything ... this is not the behavior of a  champion ... what a bum... regardless of the fight outcome ... he is a joke.
One day Tyson Psycho Fury will bow down and kiss the feet of Deontay Wilder.
Real talk!! We in for a real Treat!!! Exspect both fighters to knock down.
Ini yg tunggu tunggu
Wilder a new champion !
Welder character has really changed. Is it that he is now humble person or humble by the last beating he received from fury
Hearing aid isn't helping DW
I love the faceoff these guys got bad intentions .
Wilder look focus and ready too win.
Wilder is nothing like before, i feel like he’s gonna win this time
Fury’s gotten a lil comfortable it seems 🥴
Headphones became too much for Wilder.... It was time to leave
Sangat terlihat Dontai welder sangat takut.....
Boo The bogey man is gonna get you again. LOL LOL
What's the point of them staring at each other so long?🤷😅...lol
Wilder will knock him out.
Both of them are jokes man… they should retire and gave the belt to the other new heavy weight fighters😁
The fury’s there have a much class as a toilet 🚽
Tyson Fury looks more like a flabby fat girl. L😂L! I bet you Fury gets knocked out this fight.
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 time 2 time. He went home and his wife divorced him cause he wouldn’t stop saying 2 time
The way Wilder walks ,god makes me wanna go wild
Fury biraz endiseli ve cekingen gibi gorunuyor
i think fury expected to out talk wilder again but didnt happen. this time no mind games just pure boxing.. very excited
How do these normally end, someone help these people
Wilder waiting for the song to end....
Deontay listening to " aaaand don't want the world to see me cuz I don't think they know I'm alive. When everything's made to be broken"
Wildar is the best fighter
Do you think maybe these lads ought to just get a room?
WILDER GONE BEAT SHIT DOWN FURYS LEG!!
Tyson Fury has made Doentay Wilder learned how to be a gentleman. He used to come out in a situation like this  boasting how tough and dangerous he was. I don't know  why they have to be acting   all that tough  on a conference.?  Remain calmed  and proves how tough you are in the  ring.
Wilder will knock down him this time !!! Bombs quad !!
Whoever yelling Bomb Squad a clown
2 time, 2 time, 2 time!!! My god that was killing me lol
and that's what going to mess up Wilder his ego and his garbage a** team
Self control ,he who can control the tongue can control the whole body...
Это не бокс, а дом 2
Bum squad😂
Who is the overgrown Danny Davito?
Bomb squad lmao 😂
His wear the headphone to not get his ears busted again. Tyson gonna do him again.
Why am I watching this
Neither of them are a patch on giggles clifton.
Why are they fighting again ? Tyson beat him twice
Wilder looks serious like he will bus tyson 4real lol brilliant stand off hope it makes a good fight wilder shape looks good
😂🤣 wait champ 🥊💪
Its crazy yall think headphones an sunglasses means fury got in wilders head already  . . . IT SOOOOO MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT  . . . win or lose im with wilder .
Wilder will definitely inflict some damage to tyson this time round and knock his abdominal snowman looking ass out 😂
Se les reinicio el Windows
Two times loser 😂😂😂
Wearing sunglasses to hide his fear ear phones to stop him shaking 😂 He's Tyson Fury's bitch 😂😂😂
Props to Fury for holding inside the belly for so long
"To this day!" 🤣🤣
Reporter goes > Fury what about the allegations of fixing your gloves Fury responds..........nothing LOL jajajajajajaj his face priceless
The gypsy thief what a scammmmm Lost the 1st fight even tho i had to admitt he was jumping and moving as if it was the first round in the 12th.. LOL great shape for a big fat dude that never done peds before lol jajajajajajaja, then cheated his way in the second fight by  tampered gloves what a low life.
The wrong guy took off his t-shirt.
tutor tutor tutor,, 2loses 👊👊💪🤣🤣
Always wilder legs looks funny well he will lose any way
This was the longest stare down in boxing history damn
And new wbc  champion wilder
Фура его убьет )))
Furys body is so out of shape he like Ruiz
Tyson is real!  crazy, strong mentality!
So wilder kos Malik Scott then hires him as a trainer. Wtf lmaooooo
This time Wilder will knock out Tyson. After it happens please comeback and like my commeng
Fury looks nervous and swallowing hard throughout the whole stare down...hmmm. Smh
Stare downs done help you box in the ring Deontay .. i hope he learned how to throw a jab. lol
Till this day
Why is this considered a rubber match? It was a draw fight 1, and tko by fury on 2. If you ask me wilder don’t deserve a rematch
Gypsy King gots some serious dad bod goin on
WILDER gon win , period
Wilder already knows hes lost. Choosing to remain silent the whole conference? How childish and unprofessional. Leting another man speak for you is a clear sign of weakness.
WILDER is A WEAK MINDED CRY BABY!!
After gazing into each others eyes for over six minutes the two men surrendered to their feelings. Deontay, built like Adonis reached over and lifted the hairy stomach pooch of Mr. Fury and began to un-buckle his belt....
My eyes would get dry.
Bumm squad ...2x the looser ...wilder turned away ...already lost
Fury's crew: Shut yo mouth, kick ya in the face,    Wilders crew: 2 times *10
wilder looks more determind than ever if he cant do it this time then its gg.
I’m ready for them to fight AJ.
that Gypsy boxing Royalty...      wilder is also elite as fk
I don't like either of them but I hope deontay wins
You know Shane backs it brudda
Wilder 👊👍
The Gypsy king wins again !!!
Fury should've coached Askren since both their body shapes are the same.
This fight is becoming boring it will end like the Last time
heavy dynamics..  2 God Fearing dudes, both been severely emotionally distressed, 1 is the source of the others current distress and one has come out of his own distress only to look into the eyes of one who is where he once was..  crazy
El beso eh el beso eh el beso eh
The longest stare down ever
Wilder only hand one problem his ego. Now he is  aware that he can lose so. Its going to be different
Will be good to finally see the back of this twat.the circus and corruption has to end.i love boxing and the skill of it you know the power,accuracy and hate of mike tysons punching and the fact that mayweather looks like he has never been  hit with his unbelievable skills.he only just got up in last wilder fight and thats after doing something with the gloves of which my 10 year old son said i can see his knuckles....wilder in 3 rounds
Is thats recor??
Don't think Fury wins the sauna match like he did against Klitschko
Tyson Fury sloppy built
Tyson Fury look like a little kid that got in trouble for doing something bad he is scared nervous I see it all in his face his body language tells it all I done seen it too many times and this is exactly what it look like
Tyson the cheater Fury is scared and nervous because he know Deontay Wilder is going to punish him
Wilder please please beat the brakes oof of fury
Announcer voice ""on the blue corner Deontay the SNOWFLAKE Wilder""
Guys look puzzled to separate them, just lift a towel between them. Nobody loses
Wilder looks like a skinny booker T🤣 half expect him to shout 5 time 5 time wcw champion 😂😂😂
Fury fury fury
Is there a rematch clause for this fight?
No way could I look at wilder and that goatee and not bust out laughing.
Fury owns, Wilder, & if the staredown lasted for an hour, there is no way that Fury was going to  look away 1st. Wilder tried but he absolutely knows that he is in for another vicious beating, he has already lost the psychological fight.
What the Hell is this “Two times”??
Fury UD OR LATE NOCK OUT
Come man
This is so dumb. Lol what a waste of time. Hurry up with 1 minute for a picture then carry on. Smh
When bosses silent why cheeks shooting
deontay coward
Brilliant wilder... sarcasm meant*
Nah wilder is not gone be the same fighter .. I’ve felt that anger before 😂🤣
I'm embarrassed for the guy that tried to say "and New" 😭😭😂
Only bacon will be left in the ring!
Fury looks outta shape
who Will win fight ?  Tyson or Wilder ....
Romantic
That may be a  psychological win for Fury but I wouldn't lose sleep over it.
Either wilder has something up his sleeve that’s why he’s so quiet (I highly doubt it) or he is terrified..
wilder wilder wilder u had lots to say the first 2 fights now u choose to remain silent coz I know u fear the gypsy king ur never going to finish Tyson with one punch so stop trying
Wilder just listening to Sinatra and don't give a fuuuk 😂
Fury looks so out of shape
Wilder not playing ! Wilder win 5th round ko.
This fight is for wilder.100%. Fury should have fight another boxer  instead of wilder. It's going to be disgrace to him.
Destroy wilder
Welder mencret
Bob arum is back 2 back win😁
Furry Winz
very solid muscle of fury is the key to win
What are your predictions for the excuses from Wilder and his fans?
Fury, wear that massive suit Wilder wore to the ring in the trilogy fight lol
Fury.. 💪
Tyson knows how to win the mental battle, if he has won that already.... wilder is fucked
suwe neram nek inget ingetan..
Mike Tyson 🥊 The Best 🦈
Anyone remember John Jones v cormier 1 face off🤪🤛🏾
I just wasted 6 minutes of my life watching 2 guys pointlessly stare at each other, I WANT MY 6 MINUTES BACK!!
Those headphones look heavy
Easy work
Jesus, that stare down lasted longer than me in bed
اخواني.لازم.ماينازلو.لينه.فروبري.اقوه.منوه.بكثير...انا.احترم.ملاكمن.اثنين.ابطال
Knock Fury out cold Wilder🤣. Haters lining up in the comments😩...🤣
Tyson will win easy.  Wilder just got a Chance with one hard hit
Wilder looks so different and thin
Tuuuu Taaaa
sorry Wilder is  on high from cocaine....
Fury next press conference buy a suit of armour (British Theme) with 500lbs written on it, sunglasses that glow red from some cheap shop. That would be more hilarious then your batman costume vs klitcho.do it.....will up the paper views and intrest.
Zangief vs Dashlsim   🤔
Race war intro
This Time Deontay Destroys Fury
Жир против бокса
He want be able to beat the new improved wilder
I hate yes men god damn
Lame match... Fury 2 Wilder 0..do we have to go for the 3rd? Am not a fan of neither... This is just stupid!
I want fury to win Inshallah as hes my brother in my religion. ☝🏽
Take them stupid ear phones off ya goose
Wilder got sole implants done after the last fight. He said that heavy ring gear that made him lose was also so heavy it made him shorter.
if wilder wins that means there has to be a fourth godamn fight... i just wanna see fury vs joshua
We all know wilder the best ever
Bum sqaud🤣🤣🤣
I think the fight is coming between them will be another. The Wilder had changed. Fury must be very flexible and tricky for winning this fight. Wilder knows this is the last chance to stay in elite division and is ready to destroy Fury.
Wilder is kind of boring. No character
Fury is mentally stronger. Boxing is a mental game. Wilder is scared!
in this time
24 hours later….
Nobody talk about tyson fury's brother?
00:40 the bad ass look when he take off the glasses, I know he's gonna prove something come July 24th. Prove them wrong black man put that white man on the ground 🖤
Fury look like 10lbs of potato salad in a 5lb 🤦🏾‍♂️
Wilder is already a beaten man...
If Wilder's training does not change, he must lose again. Wilder needs an excellent coach.
Fury no es estúpido al final se da cuenta que será difícil ganar.
Can someone let wilder know the stare down don't win you the fight lol
Wilder Is A Moron!!! Fury With The W Again. No Different Outcome
You know how some people get into a car wreck and they aren’t the same in the head anymore. That’s what I think happened to wilder ever since he got knocked out thinking someone hit him with a crow bar.
I like the way Fury wears his basketball  cap backwards; it gives the impression  that his not  bothered about kim
10-9 fury
Covering your ears isn't gonna help you deal with those fury demons, deontay. Can't fight with earphones on.
I like Wilder but think Furry will win
DAAMMNN!!! Wilder look scared 😂
Wilder better not talk this time just fight damn.
Wilder's Headset has nothing but White noise playing to drown out Fury.
Does Fury have to have padding in his gloves this time or no?
Deontay reminds me of when I used to get nervous for presentations and put music with headphones on to chill out lol
You.         Can.              CUT.                 The.                TENSION.              With.                       Uh.             KNIFE.                  Its was hard to get that out!  Fury tho i cant get over his body. Wilder should feel insulted he didnt even train to fight him!
Tyson Fury built like that kool neighbor that helps you take furniture and other shit that you may buy and need a hand literally he could do most by himself! Lol
Are they trying to set a Guinness Book of World Records event😅😄😃🤣🤣😁
I don't understand why Tyson Fury is not fighting and Anthony Joshua??
Wilder akan mengalahkan Fury dengan telak...  Go go Wilder
At this point they’re taking the same photo pose a hundred times.
Se le ve muy determinado a Wilder de vencer a Fury y me parece curioso el hecho de que use audífonos para no escuchar lo que dice Fury. Ojalá en la 3ra pelea de el 100%.
Is it me or is wilder smaller than last fight🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔????
Wilder menang asal jangan menghina Tuhan yesus
Two time... two time.. two time...two time, yeah two times you got beat.. Ya big dosser
I bet on anything I love Wilder was blastin REVENGE by Joyner Lucas!
Wilders the biggest joke to sports 😂😂😂
only mike Tyson's stare downs ☝️👊
*Well Luke Fury was named after Mike Tyson (so they say) and he can't even punch for starters, otherwise he wouldn't have to get mark breland to spike Wilders water and then wear loaded gloves*  *If mark breland didn't spike Wilder, why did he lie about giving wilder water when he was caught on camera doing exactly that?*   *What did he have to hide?* 🤔   *It's also physically impossible to leave a dent in a fighters skull with padded and unloaded gloves, it's never happened in the history of the sport with far bigger punchers such as Mike Tyson, Lennox Lewis, Earnie shavers, even Wilder himself*  *Fury's team also covered the cameras in the changing rooms before the fight, why would they do that if they had nothing to hide? Nobody else does that* 🤔   *Why did Fury duck the 60M trilogy which would have been presumably an easy payday if it was so easy last time without cheating?*  *Instead, he wants to spend millions of his own money in court to avoid the trilogy* 😂😂   *Then he tried to fight an unknown bum called Agit Kabayel that he would get less credit for beating for merely 3-5M instead of 60M against Wilder* 🤔   *Furthermore, Fury has already been caught red handed in the ring with tampered gloves against Christian Hammer and was forced to change by the referee, it wasn't the commission who caught him, the same as Margarito, Luis Resto etc so that shows the futility of the "how could he get away with it" argument. He also tested positive for steroids against the same opponent in February 2015*   *So we know that he's a drug cheat who tampers with his gloves already so why is this surprising?*😂   *When he returned to the sport, he sold the public Christianity and mental health pity stories to cover up the fact that he didn't care about the mental health of his opponents he cheated in what is already a life threatening sport* 🤔   *He also lied about donating his entire purse to charity, if he wanted to keep his charity quiet, why would he make this statement in the first place and use it to sell himself to the public and then find excuses to not prove it afterwards? Smh* 😂   *Fury fanboys can't handle facts, they don't know anything about the sport, they are merely a cult of mindless geezers who are so desperate to have a heavyweight champion through any means necessary, that they will say any nonsense*   *Fury has NEVER defended a title in 12 years as a professional but he's been stripped for cheating and been put on a 2 year backdated ban for testing positive for steroids in February 2015, which meant he couldn't defend his titles and was stripped of them and forced to vacate the other*  *Fury has never faced a mandatory*   *He's only beat only a mere TWO champions in 12 years and caused cheating controversy BOTH times, testing positive for steroids just 9 months before the Klitschko bout*  *He's ducked the Klitschko rematch, Dillian Whyte as a mandatory, Mike Tyson's offer to fight, AJ last year and now he tried to duck the Wilder trilogy* 😂   *He's the biggest fraud in boxing history and Fury fanboys can't refute facts so they get excited and resort to repeating about how Wilder got beat instead of addressing reality*
Kelamaan... Tatap tapapan.. Nya... Tar lu ber dua makin  sayanggg, kan Repotttt!!!!
How many times?
Wilder to coming too Fight Ain't No cheating this Fight
This Fight make sure they checked Fury Gloves i want too see a clean Fight
2 giraffes walk in to a bar
Take a tiny step forward! Thats the best face off ever if they took litlte steps closer and if wildee got closer then took offf the head phones
Y'all playing. Wilder is going to smash him.
Fury won the stare down 🤧
Finally
Wonder if he’s atleast getting paid by beats for this
Wilder's scareddd
Fury 💉💉💉
These to going to be friends in the future and make a show I will definitely watch
Afterwards they zoomed each other to continue the stare at each other 😎🥸
Tyson Fury is cool & handsome 💪🏻😊
He said 2 time like 40 times lol
who's that foul loud mouth man in the white shorts in Furys camp what a complete embarrassment
The big mouth, he saying bomb squad or bum squad? Anyway Fury will knock that bum out anyway. When that guy say 2 time, does he mean Wilder getting knocked out 2 time again??? Hahaha
someone should've just put a table with some candles in between and get someone to play a violin..
I'm in !
Funniest stare down ever dude
If sobriety test was human
Lowkey nothing playing in the headset. He’s curious to hear
Deontay wilder
that was so gay
Rooting 4 Woodley
Another beat down by the main white boy coming up
Lookin at each other like “ Why are you gay? “
They will be picking pieces of Wilder from the 3rd row of seats next fight
Fury's dad bod is the real winner here!
Wilder made a competition out of the stare and still lost 🤣
He cant hear you lol
These yanks clearly don’t get the whole Gypsy fear thing. They have none and will fight you any time and any where you choose.
@45 seconds his hand trembled when removing his glasses. He is scared. He will get knocked out 1 round left hand knock out.
The way he took off his glasses just showed he will lose
I didn't know that this stupid shit happens but it is boxing so it makes sense
"The look....of looove...."
Guy please turn to the cameras.   Wilder and Tyson just giving one intense tare down. Had me me nervous when everyone started walking up to them both. I thoughbit was about to go down.
I like the Bronze Bomber's mullet
Deontay Wilder, the weakest mind in professional sports
Great. The fight no-one wanted to see. Hope fury sparks him in one round.
Wilder is fucking scared
Wilder knows he can't beat Fury. That's why he's trying to get into his head, Fury don't play like that.
Two time.... Wilder lost two times already 😂
Gotta say... Fury was the man weighing over 400 lbs, hanging out in his hometown park talking to birds, saying he wants to drive a car into a tree... until Wilder kept telling the guy to get his head good, get in shape and the title shot is yours. Now fury up there tryna say the other man is mental and ruined by some L?  I'm not hating. I think both these guys are more real than some AJ. I was rooting for fury vs klitz and others. Yeah I side with out home area champion Wilder... but both these guys more legit than aj no matter if aj has belts or not. Was it not Fury that kept saying AJ is false and that he enjoyed working contracts with Wilder... saying Wilder had balls, was a real fighter? John Fury saying he worries for his son vs Wilder? Now fury sitting up there like nothing ever happened cuz he had an awesome night vs Wilder plus a couple "wins" vs guys Noone knows ... allowing him to re-build his ego and record. Wilder first fight back after chaos is a str8 away title fight vs his demons and everyone's new favorite personality. Im just saying... Tyson best not get his head in the high life and feel untouchable. Cuz if he gets touched again I do not think he will become the undertaker and ruse back up so easy
Wilder looking serious, wishing the best! Lets make a great FIGHT already!!!!
c mamaron
Two time man🔥🔥🔥🔥
Everyone Trying to say wilder "lost a test of wills" by walking away first....did u not notice how many times fury had to re-adjust the stance, say some meaningless words, blah blah while Wilder stay ice cold, staring into a man's face the whole time... like "imma kill you. Ws and Ls are whatever. I'm here to hurt you".
Watching ufc. We hate bruce buffer but reality is that no one can take the place of brush buffer and we want him in fury vs wilder
He going get spanked agin if he didn't learn how to box yet
Easy win for the gypsy king. Wilder is old news. We NEED that fury vs Joshua fight.
Go on Tyson
all what fatboy cocain floppy gloves fury did was try his best to irritate Deontay so he could find an excuse to "again" avoid fighting the TRILOGY.. thats because we all know the "CHEATING KING" is getting knocked out harrrrd in the TRILOGY...
Legend says they are still standing there
Tyson Fury 💪💪💪💪💪
This gave me SaeDemario Vibes 😂🤣😂
Booooooommmmmbbbbn Squuuuuaaaaaaadddddddd
That was gay
Kiss him!
Bomb was a Dud!
Deontay is going to smash Fury's face in. Can't wait!!!!
What is the weight difference?
Deonte looked scared when he took off his glasses.
Wilder is winning 😔
Wilder I think tried a psyhological trick .  Its easy to look in oponents eyes For long periods of time without  Making too much "faulted"emotions with headphones. Dont be fooled.. this stare was more crazy for them .Its powerful  I got a feeling they told Wilder to look at him and  When Fury makes a smile later in the long run  to walk away. There is certain type of emotion . Not sure about how much this will help him if its true.  This is just my opinion i may be wrong but   Fury stayed in place for too long after wilder left as he got something to prove . But Tyson Fury is Tyson Fury.  Cheering for him. But Wilder is no joke!  😎
Naomba fury uchapwe kama nyoka🇰🇪
Deontay winnnnn
Wylder is a 7 years old kid, how can you not speak at your press cenference; so pathetic mate
when the game  begin but you press start to go to bathroom
I like watching Tyson as a fighter but my Lord that body. Jesus bro. You're a professional athlete for Christ's sake not a professional eating machine.  Riddick Bow did not look good towards the end but your body is on a whole new level of just awful/sloppy.
Beyonce wilder.
Better be entertaining fight not some cheap promo stuff
Wilder l love your mood, You will win this fight, l Believe it
I honestly wonder when did tyson fury actually train, his body posture seems ou if shape more like hes been chiling in couch all day everyday
Them boys got lost in the sauce 😂😭
3rd times a charm? or retirement lol
2:56 … hell nah, sit back down.
That guy saying two times at the end is from World Star!
Go for it boy's
Me t looking so ready 4 another war
Please could someone give me it nutshell of how it was going on and what happened during the face-off?
Omg the 'two time' guy needs to take a long walk off a long peer.
Anybody there trying to speed this along clearly doesn't know that this is all in the name of entertainment in the first place.
Whether it's a staredown, or who lasts longer in the sauna....Tyson always comes out on top 🤣
Fury is guilty too much moving on his end and no cockyness like befor
They look like clowns....this cant be heavyweight....heavyweight was mike tyson....
Wilder looks like he in good shape and tge jipzi is in terrible shape
Buumm squad
Wilder ain't built like Fury. He dosent have that heart of a lion. That loves the fight and lives for it. Fury belongs in the fight wilder just wants the fame. Fury gotta knock his ass out.
6:17 and all before T-Fury face tells it all...........that ass is grass
When you cant hear your opponent and cant see him because you are wearing shades youve lost. That will be you Wilder!!!
Then the story goes the fell in love and got married in Vegas the next day. Fight is canceled
The "Hotdog"Fury's brother got tough ??
Fury vs Wilder 9 fight... it never ends.
Two ties
Deontay the delusional Wilder.... Still needs his hyenas barking in the back.... Everything about him and his group yells insecurity and fakeness
Wilders thinking of excuses already just looking at furry. Lol wilder you sausage!!!!!
Went to take a piss, toss out trash, threw a load of clothes in,hit my toe on a step, came back into the room and...They are still starring at each other..Holy fuck
You easily can find who've fear
Why is the security in the middle facing only Fury? So Wilder can swing but if Fury swings, he will stop it, huh? I dislike unjust people.
It's officially Fury v. Wilder 4 after this.
AJ👎
What happens if wilder wins we gunna get the 4th fight
THERES ONLY OOOOOOOONE TYSON FURY
Fury going to kill him 3rd KO
they literally had the longest conversation with their eyes.  👀  their eyes were eyeing shit to each other…  in the battle of the eyes…  fury’s eyes won this round.
When Jet li fought Donnie in Hero
Wilder to win...
Clown wilder is getting humiliated and dominated again 😅😂 always nice to see a racist get crushed. Wilders racist fans cry with the most low iq excuses ive ever heard
Wilder looking
Fury looks like a drunken british tourist on Mallorca
Do they look heavyweights?
Imo. Wilder is only having this fight to stay relevant. This isn't the fight the people want fury vs Joshua is what everyone wants see. Wilder has drew an lost to fury but imo lost both times. He's just in it cus he knows he he has to now as this is his last throw of the dice. Lose an he won't get a shot of the winner between fury vs Joshua. He pisses me off that we have to go through this fight rather than see what we want just because this prick can't accept he lost. What excuses is he going to come up with after this loss.
Johnny two times: "I'm gonna get the papers, get the papers"
wylder looks nervous
I think we gonna see a much different fighter in Wilder this 3rd fight I'm looking for Wilder to knock out fury this time for sure  notice how Wilder never said a word in the stare down his dead serious for this fight and has Alot to prove to redeem his seft  from the 2nd fight
Who's the moron saying 2 time? Is he referring to Deontay getting banged twice?
Tyson and Wilder be like: Let our bodyguards do the trash talking. We’re not in mood.
They’re just milking it at this point. Wilder is doing whatever it takes to become relevant again🤦🏻‍♂️It’s gonna be the same outcome🤷‍♂️
anyone CAN have a bad day and DW may have been not up to par; I would like to think as well as hope that DW gives a better run.  Not a TF hater, and TF did get the better.  I watched the fight here in Thailand on the Sunday morning if memory serves.  Just wanna see a good fight.  Shame the mouthing when "security" moves in; immature as F
I know that's not what counts... but I so wished to see Tyson a touch more bulky & shredded....  Anyway - hopefully nuff to rock Wilder even wilder‼️ ✊💥
Wilder definitely gor bigger
Dragon Ball stare downs are short compared to this
McDonald's body
Bum squad
Wilder is not playing
The loud mouth behind fury lol 😆😂🤣
Let’s make sure the Ref takes EXTRA time inspecting Tysons gloves. And does an inspection after each round
Wilder Is shit. Tyson Fury Is a king
get somebody tell that prick that he said 2 time more than twice!!! hahahaa.
Taking off your sunglasses isn’t gonna scare Fury smh
Grown ups behaving like total idiots
Dante don't wear 200 pounds of armor before your bout . don't want anymore excuses this time .
Looks like Lebron and Kevin Love about to scrap in the locker room 😂
Good blinking contest
They are still standing' TO THIS DAY '
2 time  2 time  2 time  2time 2time 2time  2 time  2time   2 time     2 time       2 time    2.  Time          2 time 🥵2 timeeeeeee
Wait these two are fighting AGAIN? wilder really can’t accept defeat eh? Getting old now
Ее
Кн
Wilder already lost the match, hiding behind his sunglasses and earphones
Fury wants to be Conor sooo bad lol
JACOB VS ESAU
Bomb Squad..!! He can't hear you.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 2.29 lol
I really don't care about Wilder and Fury anymore.  I want to see their coaches fight
I like that standoff.
Me staring at them had me go cross eyed for a bit... looked liked they kissed
Wilder is done, Tyson is so far in his head he can’t even take the headphones off needs to listen to something to keep his mind from being scared
Fury fans are living a lie like they have all of history..lie cheat and steal to win...pathetic  asses
Steal . deceive..  lie ...the epidomy of white history... fury has no power never did..I pray wilder stops his heart  !!! Fury is a damn joke!! This great white hope ass.  .. ko by death
Why is there no one in between them to break it apart. What the fuck was this! I thought they were going to kiss
Wilder is low key gay
Let's go Deontay Wilder it's time to bring Sophia home!!!
Do you all now that we are seeing this both fighters for the last time in the ring fighting, curse wilder is going to retire after he wins and fury too after losing
👍👍👍👍
*T W O   T I M E*
All that posturing only to have his ass beat. Again.
If I blink I'm dead 2timez
Don't be shocked if wilder wins. He's not here for no games
Silence is powerful Wilder not saying anything he's all business. I can tell Wilder has a different focus this time all the folks in the comments trying to denigrate the man SHUT UP! Wilder is going to get Tyson this time like he would've last had Tyson not cheated.
“Bit gay how long it goes on for.”
If fury beats him again does he get to keep him
Same as usual. Knockout
Two time...two time..guy is so annoying. Two time what? Lost?
It’s just two lovers romantically embracing each other with their eyes. What’s wrong with that.
Next blame IT ON THE RAIN LOL THE LIL FELLAZ NEVER NO WHEN TO SHUT UP .
What is two tie?
Is judgement day for both.
Let's hope the glasses didn't break his orbital bone
Цыган фаворит!
Wilders hair.  Lmao hope this dinlo loses for the third time
Wilder no 1,,
I would be embarrassed to have anything to do with “bitch boy squad”
Eye of the tiger
Wilder brought all 3 of his fans with him
Wilder looks fearless. Wilder for the win this time around
That sexual tension lol
Ye fury will light him up again
Him not reddy🤪
Was it me, did wilder look taller!
There where 3 bronze bombers in air then the gypsy king from England shot one down
😴
Two time! Two time! Two Time! Can't stand when someone just says the same thing over and over AND over..........no one calls them out on it like is that all u have to say? One line, one line, one line 🤣
Wilder maybe he is 6ft7 tall but Tyson Fury is only 6ft8 tall...
Fury is built like a melting potato
Fury by an even nastier k.o. this time
After this, this should be the last we hear of Wilder, this fight should even happen, but contractual obligation.  Cause not winning one round qualifies you for a title rematch for next fight. Yeah.....
Fury gone get this again 🤨
Fury:boo Dontae-pee's n his clothes 🤣🤣
■■●  𝑰 𝑴𝒂𝒌𝒆 𝑽𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒐𝒔 𝑻𝒐𝒐  ■●●
Cool it there Two-Time Tommy...
Fury built like a bag of spoiled milk
tWo TimE
Staring contest or what
Bum squad!!!!! 💩
And all along wilder is listening to American pie 😀
The only Bomb 💣 Squad there will be is Wilder hitting the canvas in the 7th 💯
Staredown is only 1.7mil views they are doing a good job
Deontay wilder 1st or 3rd round by knock out
Never seen such an emotional face off!!
SHIT SHOW! Give us Fury vs AJ man! We don't need this bullshit triology.
Jake Paul Tyrone Woodley face off was better lol
Bruh wtf with Tyson body??
Ciekawe czego słucha wilder
Almost a kiss
Wilder gonna fuck dis dude up so bad😂😂😂
Does anyone actually care about this fight, I know I don’t only thing more boring would be a 5 minute stare off, oh wait…
omg
I have never anything as embarrassing as that constant "two time" nonsense.
2 time 2 time 2 times knocked out
BUMSQUAD! BWAHAHHAA Tysons Gonna school you again haha
Fun fact : Wilder needed to sit down after 6 minutes of standing.
Wilder gonna say; my headphones were too loud and damaged my ear drum so, i couldn’t hear Fury’s punches coming 😂😂
Come on I'm pick Deontay for being a winner 🏆
Wilder got a lesson about relying on a 1 punch finish he will have to change his style and game plan hope he ain't to old to learn new tricks else the outcome will be the same
When you about to start a game but your mum calls you for dinner so you leave your console running
I don't want to watch this fight you two foooq boys. Tyson Fury should fight AJ.
Wilder has high heels' shoes!!!! :)
They are just about to explode 💥💥💥.
Or no
I'm sorry but I'm not interested in this fight at all
Wtf is Tyson fury wearing man looks like an overgrown teenager
Fury won this fight right here
Wilder literally stood on his toes. 😬
The end of Tyson furry has come.  Wilder gbumayę. Iseeeee
Smash him one last time Tyson but proper into the ground this time so I dont have to waste anymore of my time on pointless fights when I could be watching you pound A.J's face instead 🤣
Can't wait
2 time .. 2 time .. bro got to many yes man with him
To this day TO THIS DAY BOMB SQUAD he can't here you 😂😂end this clown Tyson so the Brits can on with the real business.
Two time champion wilder ✊🏿
Gypsy king rule
Those yanks are shite at Staredowns. Bitched out after 5 min
Why does that clown keep shouting “two times” i think we all heard him the first “two times” 😂
Wilder looks shook
Wilder is weak
Fury is built like a bag of milk and still will dominate like always. I don’t get it 😂
Wilder, common, greetings from Ukraine. Believing for You' are. Goodluck, see that you become most eduranced and  more attentively
Two times 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🙈
They prolly went to sleep in standing position
2 time getting knocked out he's right. #AndStill
When GTA A.I. gets stuck in the fence after you throw a grenade
I'm surprised Wilder took his glasses off I mean the man couldn't even talk and had his mouth piece talking for him.  #AndStill
Unless Wilder took some actual boxing lessons, this fight will be just like the last fight.
👍
Wilder you’ll suck second time!  Gipsy king 🤴🏼 forever!!!!
Wilder gonna get bullied in that ring fury knocking him out early I got a feeling
Hopefully wilder trained with floyed this time lol 😂
Wilder look scared taking off his sunglasses 😂
Wilder trying to act like Steve Collins with the Head phones when he was fighting Chris Eubank. Only difference is that Collins won both fights and the intimidation worked, Tyson not giving a shit about Wilder's headphones. Wilders  messed up over his loss to Tyson and when he loses this fight he defiantly won't step in the ring again.
Fury, already living rent free in wilders head!!! Fury to KO this yank muppet by round 8.
Can't wait to see Beyonce's entrance in which he wears an 80lbs Halloween costume coming out with a rapper that brings up race more than MLK Jr did
deontay is one more show-off like all Americans and fury a boxer he's going to knock him out again
All I see to 2 duckers ducking undisputed what happened to I want Joshua remember I told you rather than fight Joshua fury wilder 4 coming soon these man don't care about legacy
A state down like that becomes a meditation haha
Headphones and glasses! What is he scared of?
The eyes speaketh than word of mouth show
I would like to see wilder knock him the fuk out this time. Just hoping he will have learnt and listening to his trainer
Deontay 👍🏿
Wtf is wilder wearing 😂😂😂😂🤭🤫🤮
Legend has it, they are staring, still, "to this day"
BUMSQUAD............🤣🤣🤣 why is that American stuck saying 2time 2time 2time 2time like a broken record 🤣🤣
Wilder sorrounded by yes man maggots.. that’s why u gonna lose again
By my calculations 2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2 should equal "too tired" to figure it out .
Last time Wilder always said "I can't wait, I cant wait"  Now I can't wait to see the fight..   Btw Wilder still has a chance as long as he has that right hand, if he lucky enough he could win the fight.  But for me Furry 55-45. I cant see how Wilder could stop that long hand, that weight, that skill. Fury with his 273 lbs, his boxing and wrestling skill could make every fighters leg tired. Jab jab, one two punch, huging that's all he need.
Screw getting into shape I guess  these heavy weights look like playdoe. Miss the 90s
Bombzquad🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The gypsy kid is scared just took the arms back
Wilder will eat that #burger once and for all
In the event of a Wilder win it changes everything in the heavyweight category . Such a match can be decided by a single punch.
they r challenging not to blink game
Why do I have this Crazy ass Feeling, Deontay Wilder is gonna Merk Fury ?!?! Its not a prediction just a feeling
Wilder wearing headphones says a lot
wilder listening to "eye of the tiger" 😂😂😂
The guy yelling two time is so cring
Tyson always looking like a concrete layer, casual af 😂
I like the personality Tyson exhibits on TV, never met him, but have a load of respect for him. Wilder is a waste man
we have a staredown champ the gypsy king lol
Widać strach w oczach wildera
Wilder is a mug
Feel like wilder might have fury don’t think he’s taking it seriously and just wants the bag now
Fury should have said he blinked first lol
AGAIN!!??
Legend has it they still haven't moved " TO THIS DAY "
The fight nobody wants
Rain main saying 2 time
2 Time
Longest ever
It’s about to be a wilder fight
wilder can`t even win a face off, lol....
https://youtu.be/btmLyY4rBRs
Hope wilder ko’s the fook out of fury
the fact he wore shades and head phones says it all hes scared
Technically fury beaten this wilder twice doesnt deserve the rematch...fury will win it again and retire wilder...
What's the next excuse for wilder when he lose
Who actually gives a fuck about this fight. Fuck boxing, the money grabbers make it a terrible sport to follow cos we rarely get the fights we want. Like AJ vs Fury. It’s the reason pro boxing is a dead sport
I honestly think that Wilder is mad going up against Fury again expecting different results after being so man handled...All I see is a scared little boy desperate for another shot but in his mind he already knows the outcome.
Fury >Wilder
Someone press start
Mental victory
I think wilder wins this one
when bodyguards are useless..
This HEATED, somebody career is going to change, I’m not even picking who wins
Ang lalaking mama... So excited makita part3 nila
Comment below: ⬇️ What's Deontay Wilder listening 🎧 to ???
Okay, maybe stare downs shouldn't be this long.
Why is furys brother got his belly and tittys involved like he ain't a fat mess also
🔥🤣🙆‍♀️🔥🥊👁️🔥🤣🤣🤣
Fury shouldn’t have never gave him a third match
This was more intense than my last relationship eheheheh
Two hours later....
yall missing the micro expressions on these two fighters! Furry has took about three big nervous swallows  as Wilder was super focused and relaxed Micro expressions say allot about a man/women. Also Fury rises on his toes as Nepolian Bonpart did the very micro expressions Charles Marcus Tallyrand noticed about a insecure Nepolian who wore shoes with heels to compensate for his rather short genetics!
The guy is so boring. 3000 times "two time"
Its definitely gonna be brutal🤣🤣
NO CAP, MY MONEY ON WILDER. HE AINT COCKY ANYMORE. ALTHOUGH HE MADE EXCUSES ABOUT THE LAST FIGHT, HE LEARNED FROM HIS MSITAKES. MIGHT BE TKO FOR WILDER
Cameramen are going to have to sift through 10,000 photos of a state off 😂
Face off was stupid acting like Romero with Israel and then fight was bullshit.
Sunglasses+ headphones? What weakness
Who's the dick saying "2 time"?
If Tyson fury lose yall gone be mad.........😆
I hear they’re still staring at each other… TO THIS DAY!
To have either of these guys as your uncle would be the ultimate flex for any kid
wilder looking like the hog villain from ninja tuttles
fury got the dad bod sheesh
Wilders men. “Bomb squad”  Fury’s men.   “ Bum squad” 😂😂👌
2 time..... I think the guys stuck.
Nobody and I mean nobody should watch this fight. AJ vs Fury is the only fight left in this division.
Fury is a top boxer ,but shame he's fatty .boxing is becoming boring to watch because of mass fat shaking  on the ring .yukkky 🙏
Lol when he realised having his glasses on made him look like a punk
Fury dresses like a chav, but he is no slouch.
Wilder wild ass will get KO again Lol
Fury cheated.... Not this time
The the Headphone don't blame the headphone.
4:31: Tu-Ta! Tu-Ta! Tu-Ta!
I wonder if fury is going to teach wilder a "boxing lesson"  like Saunders gave canelo 🤔
Fury gonna get the hat trick. Easy win then on to aj the real fight
Tyson should fight AJ
Damn wilder just as tall as fury, I think fury gonna lose, I don’t think he practiced like wilder did
Tyson finna cheat again
They not even gonna put hands on each other but lets wait 5 minutes then flood the stage with 50 overweight security goons. Ok hype builders
2 time vs jack black
Two of the best in the game
Deontay needs his shit back in blood 🚫🧢
Is it just me, or did Tyson Fury shrink? I realize the camera angle isn't perfect, but these two appear to be essentially the same height. Certainly, Fury doesn't have 2 inches on Wilder.
WILDER! WILDER! WILDER! WILDER!
I’ve never seen a filibuster for a boxing match
Gold vs bronze
Fury Wins
New excuse headphone and chain was to heavy
У фотографов закончилась плёнка, только поэтому они разошлись.
Yall crazy if yall think fury gone win this time
Wilder %100
Fury going to lose this one now that they going to make sure the gloves are good ...cheating ass fury
Looks like Fury just rolled off the couch...
Fury won the face off Wilder is listening to "hit me baby one more time - Britney Spears " in the headphones .
Wears Headphones and refuses to speak. He's scared Shitless! Tyson is gonna eat Him alive!
Fury gonna visit the Q Branch (in James Bomd) to receive gadget gloves to back up his fraudulent 1 punch knockout power. Fury: rig me gloves.
Cheat vs aBeast 💪🏾
Wilder will win by a nasty open cut stoppage over Fury's eye.
Fury and wilder 3,  After 100 years  Fury and wilder 50😁
Big gulps, repositioning himself, talking to break the ice... Fury was scared & nervous. If Wilder talks to him, it makes him a bit more comfortable. Also, Wilder looks a bit taller although Fury is listed 2 inches taller.
This was intense. There are gonna be some emotions in that ring.
Another big joke for boxing
Y’all can think fury gone win 😭😭 bouta get his shit knocked trust me and I’m not even a wilder fan
Yep, Fury won this one
can't cheat this time fury
My goofy ass would’ve just started laughing
I dont blame wilder for not wanting to hear the b.s
Who?
Nonsense, they will still fight 4th and 5th time, how the hell they are wasting camera man time. They suppose leave them to just stand there for nothing.
The boringest face off
Two time.Two time.Two time. Certain people like to repeat themselves when taunting.
Wilder wins, Fury's gonna have to cheat to stand a chance.
Awkward. Do your thing in the ring. Come on, man!
Longest faceoff of all time
Love the fact that Fury ,may be big and tall, still looks like a normal guy, a dad body.
who is the fat guy behind Fury? and why is he talking crap
Inspect them gloves and don’t drink they water bring Fiji 😂💯
That boy built all kind of nasty
Out of shape, man boobs, love handles, when does this man train?
For some reason this got me sooo hyped for the Trilogy. Can't wait.
that buck bout to get broke
THATS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE STANDS UP TO TOUGH GUYS
NO NO NO.... HE SAYS
Fury was still stared at wilder ...wilder ur out again and again
Alright you two loves birds...
Both of these guys would have been killed by the studs in the 90”s ! Both are extremely clumsy and out of shape
Two times he gets his ass beat.
Tyson fury looks scared
Fury is like a heavy weight boxing version of Ben askren
Tyson Fury...The Will Ferrell of boxing
This face off was more entertaining than a Logan Paul fight
BOMB SQUAD🗣
I wanna see caos no a lame ass stare down.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Although fury should've beaten wilder twice not once I think wilder is focused hungry got his sh*t together and will beat fury i wish aj fought fury and beat the clown i respect fury for overcoming his Demons but boxing wise he's an overrated clown has beaten an old past his best klitschko and wilder who ain't a true boxer without his right hand he would lose most of his fights this fury and wilder will rumble on for another few fights
Wilder was unbeaten in 43 fights, y’all here acting like he’s some bum. We all know Fury is the firm favorite but put some respect on Wilder’s name.
TYSON! TYSON! TYSON! Let's go dad bod! LOL!
Let's see if Fury can go 3/3...you're reading that right, and if you watched the 1st fight you'd agree.
No emotion or anything from My DW👌🏾🔥
Well damn 😭
Tyson looking 20% Sasquatch...
Why the fuck is there even a trilogy?
Now let's hope they don't let Fury load his gloves again
imagine if Tyson had proper nutrition and strength and conditioning
Wilder already showing weakness in approaching Fury with his sunglasses and headphones on. He fears what Fury might say
2 times,,,what about 3 times or maybe even 4 times??
Wilder listening to james brown... the big payback... theres not a song  today that can top that one for revenge .......lets go wilder im sick of all the talk from lips  thats against you KING SHOW N PROVE TIME MY BOYYY. ...LETS GOOOOOOO 😡💪🏾💯
Wilder should have just accept the lost and be himself for this conference... Fury  knows he got him again...
Tyson , whadda muscles ! :)))))
I gotta pull for my fellow Alabamaian. The south is Wilder👍
It is really so handsome how boxers really take themselfs serious these days
I love seeing a black man lose to a fat white guy. There’s still hope for the world
Fury cheated last time, he won't get away with it in the third fight.
Fury holding them hands behind his back. He doesn't want to spoil it for Wilder. He'll get his view fight night.
To rip a ear drum...man thats serious power.
I bet Mr.Ditkovich is asking constantly Tyson Fury for rent after living in Wilder's  head for so long
only took wilder 45 seconds to crumble under the weight of his shades
wilder look so nervous haha
WHO IS THAT BEE GEES BEHIND FURY?........
Oh I thought they were gonna kiss
I just wanna wear these headphones man 😂🤣🤣
Fury has a loaded glove in his pants pocket lol put your shirt on mate.
The reporter that asked them to face the cameras is a dusch
Wilder is such a joke.
"2 Times"x6 "2 losses" Lmao
:43 he heard me hahaha ....I yelled out stop hiding behind them shades!! And then he took them off hahaha
kinda stuck on stupid taking insults like a wanker
Bruce.lee.muhammad.Ali. The.two.GREATEST.FIGHTERS. THAT.EVER.LIVED And.the.bravest.and.strongest.man. JESUS.CHRIST. who.was.crucified.and.died.and. Rose.again.in.three.days. King.of.kings. Praise.the.lord.jesus.always. For.ever.and.ever. AMEN.
See that's what ever fighter should do listen to music instead of listening to fury,s bs well done wilder
No worries Wilder fans. Even if he loses, he will have another excuse. I posted on his page some ideas.  Fury put exlax in his water, his arms were robotic metal, fury put a gypsy curse on him.. Those are just some ideas.
deontey is scared you can tell when he takes off the shades .he is shaky
Fury is so full of bs he wasn't training for the aj fight contradicts himself so much fair play to wilder not listening to the bs that fury was saying
‘’Two time’’ he’s gonna get knocked out
That moment you get lost in thought having flashbacks from your last 2 losses 🤣
Wilder gonna beat his ass
This time Fury gon lose his ass can tell
Why does fury look like a construction worker
"BOMBBB SQUADDD" shut up you fookin dossers
They should be friends at this point fighting so many times together.
This was longer than Logan and Mayweather face off😐
No...not again... having a larf.. like a sponge squeezed all out...
Whos ya man think he is coolio 2 time fuckin fool
Crap
i thought hed be... wilder
Shane will have all them.wilders living in horse boxes  and  have em out  16 hours a day doing  tarmacadam jobs come on the furys 🥊🐐💪🇮🇪❤
just no weird denting floppy off wrist gloves this time please...
I can't wait
Wilder is so scared that he has to listen to music with his headphones for this motivated. the fact that he does not want to let go of his gaze for a long time is a sign of fear
Allez champion deontey
Tyson Fury has lost this mehn!!
BOXER'S WITH DOUBLE WAIST ALWAYS TOUGH, TYSON FURY AND ANDY RUIZ HAS DOUBLE WAIST
When someone calls you fat tell them your role model is Tyson fury
Lmao why in hell would they let them stay that long lmmfao
I hope the fight last longer than the staredown.
Wilder really is a bell end. Cmon Tyson
Wilder don't want to give up, imagine if he lost again, but I like both two of them to comes out victorious 🤣🤣🤣🤣
And NEW!! WBC FIR THE 2ND TIME!!
Wilder looks focused!!! Omg scary!!
Tyson is sleeping and dream his son
Wilder gets revenge!! Watch!! I saw it in my sleep Last night!! On God! In the. 5th round!! Fury gets clean knocked the fuck out!!
It'll be so funny when fury gets ko'd after all this drama😂😂😂🤣🤣... I do have this feeling fury loses this one...just don't know why🤷‍♂️
What happen to Bomb Squad 😂😂
Wilder still not prepared how u at a stear down with fucking headphones on
When tyson just ignored that lady that was comedy gold
There aren't any more bomb. It has been destroyed by Fury last year 😂.
Fuck me that was boring.
Fury gone to kill Wilder 😂😂😂
Yawn, I'd rather watch a youtuber fight than this for a 3rd time.
Lol at Wilder needing headphones just to have the courage to look Tyson Fury in the eyes
4:25. What is happening?
"HEY WILDERS HEADPHONES WERE 40 POUNDS TOO HEAVY...."  This should be the 17th time you read this joke. Wilders excuses and furys gloves were more original than this comment thread is....thats for sure.
Wilder is killmonger   .....  Jkkkaa  fury lose
Wilder looks strong on his legs. Keep wearing those ear phones mate your legs will be super strong.  You tried twice you failed twice & now you will go in to retirement you big pussy. Quick pay out for you. Fury will end it in 4 rounds 💪🏻
Wait....... These two are fighting again? Fury's gonna school him again for sure.
That killer punch from Bronze Bomber
cringe af
Ya no hay nada qe ver  ahí aburrido
go on Shane tell them dosser
Loses again 🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Gonna say fury cheated in the stare down
The blinking game😂😂
They kept staring at each other for a long time,any reason for that? I need someone to explain that to me…
King Tyson
He won that stare down like he won that sauna challenge with Klitschko.
Wilder is listening to i believe i can flyyyy!r.kelly😅😅
Wilders been told to wear the earphones and not say much so fury doesnt get in his head ,true story ,fury is gonna pulverise wilder
Wilder appears to be upset about something
3:05  Tyson: It's a competition. If he turns first he loses.
Wilder must be fuming with himself, tyson gonna show.him again
Wtf
can we get a shame fury mic ?😂😂
Bom    sqaud and new the return of the king🐯
Fury beat your guy “2 times”
Fury does not look in good shape at all.
Wilder is listening to L L with Mama said knock you out.
Why is this fight happening he won 2 now a third is it best out of 6 or 7 wilder needs to beat him 3 times to be a head
Bomb squad 😂 remember the last one blew up in your FACE !
Wilder seems like he’s n good condition I think he’s been taking his training to a new level we might see a beast emerge in wilder
I would honestly get scared staring at wilder for that long just the intensity written on his face says it all
Tyson fury's a fat body tomato can Deontay going to crush him tyson fury a cheater anyway
3:11 🤣🤣🤣
Tysoe done him proper
Fury s brother that starts threatenin the guy is the best 🤣
Fury living in Wilders head rent free
How come " 2 time" gets a mic?! Idiot
No worries it’s a done deal for Wilder.This time around it’s has been settled win win for Deontay Wilder hurraaayyy
No one cares
Deontay Wilder listening to Titanic.
Boxing just got boring
Shit still gonna b a banger
One TYSON FURY there’s only one TYSON FURY
Crazy how a video of two men with their shirts off jus staring at eachother gets more views than the actual fight....
Wilders last fight , last payday , fury by ko
Lmao " he cant hear you..." "Lets go 💣 squad!" Both are jus admiring each others body. Whats wrong with that?
Deontays team look like dick heads hahahaha
Hi Lou!
Tyson fury look scared 😂
Let's go Black King
The nigga with his "tuutimez" spit XD
I think they got lost in eachothers eyes 👀😳
Wilder’s last match
Wilder is taller than fury?
People in Wilder's corner are not allowed to say or suggest anything, because they could immediately be fired and be declared sold souls. It's pathetic what he's doing, Tyson's going to take his soul. 🤜🤛🤙💪👊👊👊👊👌
In the ring can be the answer not in eye to eye contact
Let’s go champ and still 💪🏻Tyson Furrryyy….
What dumb fuckin canary says the same thing 50 times in a row hes not even fighting boasting a statistic he did not create
I think wilder thought they were doing the face off 2 TIMES so that's why he stayed so long
I heard Tyson fury is still stood there...
Wilder is so extra 😒
They are verbally destroying Each-other through their minds
Go go Fury :)
Crack squaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!!!!
Wilder is like he want to swing those bombs but at the same time Tyson Fury just stands there confidently because he is untouchable hahahaa
Time to show the world what these fighters are capable of.  No cheating, fair and square. I hope that there will be no more stoppage. If we really want to see one of them get beat and knocked out then don't stop the fight
Two time already lost! Third time incoming
22k people liked a staring contest video
Still standing there till this day!!!
Tyson fury still beat him and didn’t even throw a punch 😂
Wilders head has already gone. He need voice cancelling headphones so he can’t get triggered 😂😂 fucking waste man
Can’t wait for Tyson to snack his arse. I wonder what excuse he’ll have this time.
Wilder listening to Shia LeBouf saying "Do it".
Another piss take boxing has become a jokr
Why are they taking so many pictures? 1 photo is enough. They just stood there.
💪🏽
Imagine if Fury had come out wearing wilder's costume, sat down at the table panting. That would've been hilarious and would've pissed off wilder so much.
This time round DW will win goes without a doubt.
No matter the outcome, wilder still gonna be remembered as the guy who bitched, cryed and made excuses till he got his way
Why are they doing this fight again?
Look at fury’s fat gypo brother in the curly wig running his mouth
Fury 👊👊
Perfekt 👌👌 wilder is hungry. That's mean we will see a big fight 😁😁😁😁
Tyson Fury won again lol 👀💪
Why does mr "2 times"  keep on reminding Wilder how many times he's lost for?? That's a low blow I thought he was on Deontay's side 🤔
And still champion Irish gypsy
Tyson Fury kile yeur mether
What a joke! A fat bloke and a skinny bloke earning millions having a scrap. Mike Tyson was the last real heavyweight. All the other from him till today have been cheap and mediocre. The entire sport has gone to ruin!
This is what you call a real Face Off
Two fools out for match
Me and my high school friend when we decided that after years of not seeing each other it would be a good idea to hang out and chat about the good old days
co to za otyły cherubin za furym stoi ?
Dionte will kill fury this time round, bronze squad!
The woman said can I have u both face forward.. Eeeerrrrrr nope 😂😂😂
The bomb squad 💪
The reason for the headsets is silence silence like " Jerome on Martin Lawrence say. And as Muhammad Ali say The champ is here the championship. Wilder is focused more tone more muscle and less running his mouth. He's very serious more than he ever been in his career.
Wilder walked away
They were battling telekineticly
Well this was boring af
He's already beat you can see it in his eyes enjoy the beating wilder again you mad man
Word says there still doing the face off right now 😳
there is just no beating tyson xD
There was only one winner here. Wilder bottled it. His eyes when he took his glasses off reminded me of the scared look on his face during their last fight.
I really don't understand Fury's body. How could it be the heavyweight World Champion's body?
This fight is not going to end well.
You still there Tyson ?   “TO THIS DAY”
AND THEY STILL LOOKIN TO THIS DAY !!
they fight again?
Wat time?
Wilder looks unsure
They almost fell in love.
Who wins this fight?
Mark my word this time tyson will lose..👌
Who's the idiot shouting  bomb squaad and two time.... some Americans just chat bollocks   and think it sounds good
Does Fury own only one suit?
Deontay is already sweating even in the face off. Why is he using that damn headphone? That is a loser sign.
My sunglasses was heavy👉🏾🤣😂😆
To me Wilder already looks like a defeated man. He didn’t want to answer questions. He wore headphones during the press conference.  This fight is a waste of time and money. Don’t waste your money on this fight! And whoever saying “two time” it’s annoying as hell!
I have the impression that Wilder is afraid of this clash with Fury, but maybe I'm wrong
Go on tyson make it a hat-rick and smash this clown deontay wilder the big shit house dosser bum squad
D: I love you  T : No I love you. No I.......
Wilder look so focused and different wilder on the night
That's it wilder don't let him into jl your head
Smash him wilder keep up the training
Tyson living rent free in his head fr
Boss man wi top off lol we need a statue of honour for tyson he's the man he beat you like he did last time ha rocky
Two time what? Are they suggesting Wilder will be two time champion? Are they suggesting Wilder knocked Fury down two times? What a moronic phrase to keep repeating. One draw, one loss, knocked on his ass four times - Wilder's team needs to shut their collective mouths' and start preparing for the next fight. The phrase "Two Time" is almost as crap as Jake Paul's "Got your hat".
Whoever is saying 2 times is annoying as fuck
Can't believe I just sat n watched them stare at eachother for 5 minutes, that was just weird
Gives me hope that dad bods can murder anyone...
Where’s the fury v Joshua ? Swear they are just longing it out🙄
Y'all great white hope failed to see the big picture
I hope fury smashes him in to retirement, wilder arrogantly thinks hes a god.
Indianerblick!
Tyson Fury got a gut in his lower back
This looks for me like a weird Rap-Battle or Music Battle DJ vs MC, Eminem versus Daft Punk😁
I have this staredown with fast food employees on the regular while we both try to figure out what I want
Fury= wierd body.   Wilder=skinny Perfect athletic body.    But body dont fight only skills
If Wilder win nr 4 be nice.
Alright fellas, this got weird about 5 minutes ago……..
Those headphones looks about 18pounds.  Better not have them on during the walkout on fight night.
Combined height, 30 feet tall.
Wilder using sunglasses and headphones. To hide behind. Make the stare down easier
Deontay Wilder should visit the Benin Kingdom in Edo State before fighting with Tyson Fury. Is there going to be Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury 4?
🔥🔥🔥🔥✊🏿
Fury KO in 7th.
wilder won the face off lol!! very good start
Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam! Squaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!
really? how about fury vs joshua?
Who you got?
Fury is the best coglioni di wilder
Tyson wins the the first of the two he was ALWAYS going to win. Wins the stare down, then goes on to win the fight... Simple...
Tyson won the trash-talking but lost the face-off.
This is so gay     Jk mate, chill
1st psychological win by fury
They said fk tha camera. This gon be worth tha ppv money fasho 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fury win
First few rounds tenderize that flabby mid sectionthen turn up up and crack that big ass head bro. Booooooomb Squaaaaaaaad 🔥🔥🔥🔥
When fury where’s that hat backwards you know he ain’t playing games he’s gonna knockout wilder once again.
Why he saying tubes tied
Deontay va a partirle el alma a ese cacho de grasa vacilón! Vamos Deontay!
Fury will lost this time around .😉 & Out of shape .
Deontay wilder listening to "I'm a barbie girl in a barbie world"
"2 times" yeah that's the amount of times wilder lost to fury.
I guess wilder head still hurts from last fight. He can't talk anymore...
The look of love ...
Fury won staring contest lol😎👀
Fury looking like the fat lad of the group in magaluf who never pulls trying to get past the bouncer into the club
Wilder is going to ko this cheater
Tyson beat wilder more
People actually give a shit about this fight?? Lol.
I thought they would kiss at last and go off
Them boyz was having a conversation with each others souls!!
Alot of white folks taking shots at DW and couldn't box their way off of their mom's titty.
?
Hope Wilder realizes he's not a better boxer this time and goes head hunting like he should've in the first two fights his only chance is a KO and he is very capable of knocking out Fury
Never knew they both find each other so attractive.
Fury will hurt him again.. wilder the 1 trick pony. Relying on the big right hand dosent cut it when you get out classed by a better boxer.. smash him fury..
Watch the hater comments against Wilder get the most likes, YouTube is a hub for haters and they all support eachother👑
Imagine being beat down by a guy with a Dad Bod.lol
old news. too boring.
Deontay has his safe space head phones on to block out the scary world
the fury boxing IQ is better than wilder but the wilder body was better than fury
tyson fury still not in shape
Nobody cares about this fight, we wanted AJ vs Fury
Hes afraid on fury thats why he got headphone hehehe
Don't know what he means by 'two time', two times Wilder has been slapped about by Fury perhaps?
Tyson fury is my champion....You win the battle Mr. Fury..  Greetings from Indonesia
Too taa, too taa, too taa! Ambulance incomming!
That was the whole 2 rounds worth of face off 👩🏿‍🦱👨‍🦲
Scrolling thru the comments while they have a face off. Almost at the bottom 🤣🤣🤣
2 time 2 time 2 time 2 time 2 time 2 time 2 time 2 time 2 time 2 time 2 time 2 time 2 time 2 time 2 time
Fury has the worst genetics but the best skills. He cant call that body fit.
Wilder is such a dud here, sells thefight then rocks up and doesnt sell it. Fury should tell him to fuck off and go have a silent disco with someone else
Wilder has to have the music on as he knows Fury is a master at mental warfare!!! Wait till the FaceOff on Sky. That’ll be awesome to watch!!!!
The Big Dosser. The Wild Man is already in his head is why he wore the cans. Rinse Repeat IMO.
The fight no one wants to see. What a joke. Looking at him like i got destoryed ...
Дантей ломай жирдяя
Fury 👀 like he bout to bust a rhyme
Waiting for Aj vs Tyson fury r Aj vs Bronze Bomber !!!
Y’all on Wilder head but y’all don’t know how serious he looking. He dead ass about to try to murk this dude 💯
Fury has no chance without loaded gloves. Real talk
لن تسلم جرة فيوري هذه المرة أمام وايلدر
I wish Tyson would work on his body he’s built like a 40 year old 1990s dad
The 2nd fight was a devastating loss for Wilder. How come they set the 3rd fight this early? Heavyweights has no more prospects?
Get me me floppy gloves.. they are me lucky charms.
It must suck getting beat by someone who doesn’t even look like he trains...
The year 2030, FURY VS WILDER 8
Fury will be putting it to him again.
How Wilder has the nerve to stand there staring at Fury after his last performance😂  Fury isn't bothered in the slightest. Even gets his boys to stare him down behind him.  😂😂😂
I think the guy saying "2 time" over and over again is broken and needs help asap.
Tyson is gonna knock this fool head clean off this time. Round 2 Ko
How many time?
Gotta love Tyson's presence and confidence - a "don't give a f*ck aura" 😁
I just know the gentleman with the curly hair knows how to hit.
This stare down is longer than the jake Paul fights
Did you even work out this entire period Tyson.
C est qui derriere l acteur de very bad trip ??🤣🤣
His ears are still swelling due to last fight.😅😅😅
What song 🎧 did he listen to, Still D.r.e.? 🎵
so the boxing world has nothing else to offer beside these two for the third time? IMO Fury has already proven what he had said
black hawk down
Bawal kumurap ng eat bulaga
Dana white where are you?
They were playing this who can longer stare play like in our childhood
"tsutsam !" 😂😂😂
I look wilder neck more huge . This is a seriously fight .
Wilder use headphones because he's scared🤣
Why do black people, when in a confrontation, repeat the same phrase endlessly?
“Boo! The Bogeyman’s here to get you again!” Lol cracks me up! 😂
Wilder listening to "Tenacious D - Wonderboy".
I think its very kind of Fury to give Wilder another fight after beating him twice.
The man repeating two times. Is referring to deonaty losing twice already bum swuaddd
Bl.lm members trying to figure out how whitey was right bout their organization to say thank you and sorry.
Guys from brokeback mountain had less eye contact than these guys.
Tyson looks like shit.. I Hope he wins but he looks awful
Wilder needs to hit body the head will fall by its self but better have good counterattack.
Everyone go follow my business on Insta I just started @PSCultivar for educational planting post and advice ! Happy planting 🪴
2 time sounded more like TUTA
That reminds me of the time first looked into my wife’s eyes 😂
Gotta be care Tyson the man goes nothing to lose hahaha better take it serious.
one has to play a role, the other one is just himself.
Why is no one having the same energy about the tennis player who didn't speak because of mental health but wilder is fine to not speak and not get fined?.. 'it's her job to speak to the press...'
Can someone knockout the guy shouting 2 time constantly.
Malik scott has a bet on fury winning
Respect! 💪🏻👊🏻
Tyson's put on weight. He doesn't want to do this fight. My money's on Wilder.
Who getting the fight?
Wilder ain't doing no more talking it's show time
🦆💨
Tbh man wilder looked like a killer fury looked scared with the time in this stare down he was so frozen when wilder left u could see it in his eyes he was glad wilder walked away and the standing after was just for show
No excuse about the costume this time Wilder😂😂
Legend has it they're still facing off
What a load of shite
I guess wilder already lost before the fight even started….
if this was a poker game, tyson would give it all away ... 😐
I reckon deontay is scared. This is a face off. It is man to man; eye to eye; look into the soul, primitive, predator/prey type shit. Wearing glasses indicates you can't look him in the eyes. Plus, listening to music means you can't hear the opponent. It seems like he really can't confront him, and I think he is scared. Plus, deontays hype man is just pathetic.  Then again, I'm sitting on my couch watching this and probably don't know shit 😂😂😂
Wilder sucks..he was defeated by knockout..c'mon .
Don't say time travel dsnt exist aftet being knocked out in the 3rd round deontay  walked out before fury's hands got raised he ddnt even wait for no post match interview...then fury went on to duck AJ and whyte ...  AJ became undisputed after win over dillian whyte in a fight that was dubbed the best grudge match of our time.....Fury went on to fight agit kabayel and chisora for a trilogy and went back to his crack days...oh yeh  he was still banging on about being undefeated and calling out AJ
Wilder didn’t even have anything playing in the headphones 🙉
Deantay Looking very focused well I think he will surprise Fury
I feel pity for wilder.  Psychologically I can. See that he is very scared and expects to be lucky.. not sure can't beat fury..
Fury finna beat on Wilder again
So boring...
In wilder headfones You are calm you brave you are in control of this situation breath in breath out
still believing in that ol speak it into existence,  manifest the future you desire  mumbo jumbo routine, when instead he should be learning a decent boxing routine if he would like to stand a chance at manifesting that future where he is    the champ once again!
Lmao why do we have this fight again?
Hope the fight is more exciting then the faceoff!
Wilder is shook
All these people licking wilder's ass as if he pays them money
Deontay wearing his high heels again
Two tahm
When I started watching this video I was 26 years old, now I’m 27
Fury isnt afraid of him at all. Hes basically the kryptonite for guys who rely on size/reach because hes bigger and deceptively quick.
Bum Squad!! lolol nailed it
Wilder is just gonna lose again and then blame the reason he lost on someone else he’s a big fucking baby
DAAAAAAAAYYYMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!
A place where women have to do nothing don't even exist...
2 excellent fashion statements
The guy holding up proceedings testing the mic its "one two" not "two times" sheesh
Bum squad 2 time stf u you bums They only feel hard because the fight is on there back yard hahaha bums
Fury best in the world
Fury looks a bit uncomfortable, like he doesn’t wanna be there.
Lets go gypsy king, who arrrrrre ya an all that
They love each other
I may as well have just looked at the thumbnail for 6 minutes
Who is the STUPID who repeats 2 time ... 2 time .. are the times that wilder lost ..
..i think they’re in love 😳
Wilder is going to take another knockout ... and he looks great and very rude ... stupid count
Tyson is like you know I have an iron chin  so😁😁
Was this scripted? Why was there no security guys between them, in case shit went down?
I fastforward like 5x they are still staring at each other
Longest face off In boxing history
Anthony Joshua VS Tyson Fury DREAM FIGHT 😭😭😭
Bum squad
SHIT LIKE THIS MAKES YOU PREORDER THE FIGHT!!!!!
TYSON FURY 👍
I thing Wilder is Win ,,
WILDER listening to "I'm all the way up " n fury to "win win no matter Wat "actually it's the opposite I guess.....fury didn't give up till the end
OK from Kenya this A must watch War
Man they just fought.
Love like that.
Boxer v Banger 🙄  Fury has Wilders number 😂🤣😆
Is he saying 2 times because Tyson gunna knock him out 2 times lol
Whos the sawed off fuck yelling “2 time” and what does it mean
Damn. It's going to be a good one.
Tyson fury defused that so called bomb.
Ps. Sounds like cash registers.
3? Ffs. This is like Liddell and Ortiz all over again.
Wilder sleeping
Tyson looks scary and un scary at the same time. That's scary.
Fury will destroy Wilder again
Fury body look like mine lol
Fury by KO. Wilder is a BUM! And no I won't say that to his face!
I’m an American and I’m a HUGE Fury fan ... Don’t try and make this America vs England because it’s not ....
Nice trousers 👍
Security guards in the back:   "Should we break them off?" "Nah, give them a couple more minutes."  "..."  "Why aren't they budging?" "..." "Okay this is getting kinda awkward." "..." "Goddamnit just start shoving already!"
The guy saying 2 time needs a slap in the face
Fury's guy; "bombsquad" x50 Wilder's guy: "2 time" x50
Do something! do something! do something!
TILL THIS DAYYYYY.  That was as stupid as his excuses after getting beat down.
Wilder knows fury's words are toxic so Wilder used headphone then he can't hear what fury said.
Wilder ready ready
I can’t believe I just watched a 6 mins face off🤣
The fact that he don’t wanna hear Tyson speak means he’s already got in his head
I think wilder will win he looks focused and been working
At least Deontay stepped in the ring not ducking like you know who
I believe Tyson Fury is thinking about another kiss.
Fck the Bronze Bummer, AJ v Fury.
5 hours later
I can't wait to watch this fight 🔥👊🏽😁🙋🏽‍♂️❤️
2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time! Somebody teach this guy English.
i burst out laughing when the security came in and the other two men started bickering.  funny as hell. :D
After I paused the video damn near still hear “2 times” lol
I was in a stare down with my phone watching this lol
To the dude who said "and new..." STFU BRO
Sounds like to me y’all hating on the black man !!! Fook Tyson
So when is butch taking place.
Hope wilder wants to win this time
deontay soul already dead...only flesh and bone standing
Fury look like Fat Bastard from Austin powers After the weight loss....Them Diet McChickens feeding him good
Wilder is gonna get his ass whooped again.  That stupid ass haircut looks ridiculous
Wilder has very high soles on his shoes...no wonder he's nearly looking eye to eye...lol
Stare down could be longer than the fight.
Two times 😂
Both of them had 5 rounds each during their stare down and it was about time to get the results but the guys stepped in.
This is gay! Heat is off JAKE PAUL now
Tyson fury had a lot of bs to say about canelo is his previous fight. Therefore fuck him.
Wilder loose again…
Tyson won the press conference and the face off. He'll repeat same fate on 24th  July

Absolutely the worst 2 heavyweight boxers of all time! Absolute 🗑
DANG! Tyson FURY IS IN TROUBLE! Fury looks worried!
2 Giants! Would love to watch it live
Let's go Wilder!!!👊🏽
I have Tyson’s build
whos the pot belly behind fury acting hard?
I hope Wilder can gain more than 20pounds and plays well with it. He was too small in the previous matches.
When you choose your characters in a fighting game and haven’t pressed start 🤣
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Sunglasses and headphones? Fury scared
Why does fury look like the Vietnam vet grandpa who eats an apple wt a switchblade...and wilder looks like a washed up rapper trying to box??😂😂
Awkward
الجرح عميق يا فيوري
I hope Tyson Fury’s gloves not flopping, laced up tight, and completely taped up this time ‼️🤷🏾‍♂️
To hell with boxing they should go outside and have a REAL fight! lol.  I do enjoy Tyson Furys moxie.
HEY GUYS TAKE NOTICE, SINCE WHEN IS WILDER TALLER THAN FURY ? HES NOT ! YOU GUYS HAVE NO CLUE WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW ! YOUR BEING DECIEVED EVERY STEP OF THE WAY !
Wait is this from their last fight or are they having a rematch because I'm late asf
Fury be like- Jaldi kar subah panvel bhi nikalna hai
Why he wear headphone with cheap and low quality ? 😂 Can't believe that someone still choose this piece of trash brand
I'm affraid they Will kiss Each other.....LOL
Hai thăg vo si nay gia rôi đanh j nôi vay may chê đưa lên chup hinh lam canh thi đươc
Tyson won the stare down but he won't win the fight 😂😂💯👍🏾
Lmfao not the most intense but most definitely the longest and funniest
I dont know man, but wilder looks like he is on the hunt. Fury better look out.
This shits just cringe, MMA face offs/press conferences are so much more entertaining
Wilder is scared shitless and he was listening to Ariana grande- break up with your girlfriend! Lmao  Bummm squad!!!!! Fury is the champ
careful they might fall in love
Wilder like I kno what you did last summer
The fat guy has another pare of bootys on his back 🙈😆🤣
Fury will kick his ass again . And if Wilder lose he will end up in mental hospital you'll see.. 😶
this is getting way boring 🚣‍♀️
I hope wilder get knocked out😂
Deontay Wilder still uses the same excuses TIL THIS DAY!
Fury is  out of shape he's a cheating piece of s*** anyways
Tyson out to win all battles in this rematch! For sure up a few rounds winning press conference and the stare down that was hilarious 😆
Fury looks like a man who's been exposed for cheating
I think wilder is going to surprise people honestly, still want to see Fury win
Didn’t Tyson cheat last fight
Invest in Vivant 🤟🤟
Bum squad 🚮 Dude is trash 🗑
Wilder loses this he gotta stop talking shit. I wish this fight is earlier July 24 is too long
You can tell Deontay still has PTSD from the last fight
Bum boys squad
Wilder is making a biggest fool outta himself with that ridiculous attitude, he is leaving in a little world he concocted in his head where he thinks learning how to box doesn’t matter and only one very improbable lucky punch matters to get a win against an excellent boxer like Fury who by the way this time will weight maybe 45 pounds more than him. Wilder showed zero Morale , zero mental toughness, zero motivation (just that greed to get paid regardless the result) , zero confidence , 💯% theatrics.  We all know what what’s gonna happen July 24 , unless a miracle Wilder will this time be totally destroyed, humiliated and badly ( I pray not fatally ) hurt in his mind body and soul .  I frankly wonder why they are serving us with this ridiculous 3rd fight while the whole world was eagerly anticipating FURY vs JOSHUA  Folks don’t be surprised if this fight doesn’t happen due to a withdrawal or nonsensical mysterious pretext from you know who ! 😉
Not only did he win the mental battle, but he was also right about BUM SQUAD 😭😭😂😂😂
Wilder`s team feel they have to speak up for their fake king because the fake king is scared to death. These fools in the LDCB talk about fraud in boxing well this is the perfect example, Wilder built a great record fighting only bums who had more losses by KO than wins. LOL
Tyson fury is shit
I'm telling everyone now, wilder is knocking his ass out
Joe Biden's next press conference, Joe be sporting some headphones too.
Wilder looks like a crackhead.
Now thats love
Tyson fury looks really relaxed
We should find Loki and ask if this is in the correct timeline or is this another nexus event? Because didn’t we see this episode already? I already know how it’s gonna end. 😝
*Takeaways* Those beats headphones stole the show
Man I swear Fury would make the perfect Kratos! Just look at his picture in the promotion behind them.
Wilder move over. Nobody needs to see you bum again.
If fury doesnt cheat this time wilder is for sure gonna ko him
Fury in 8 stoppage
Stood there in silence looked defeated already tyson u bum!!!!
Giants..
Well there’s six minutes of my life I’ll never get back.
Definitely 2 time and fury knows it that's why he ain't hyping this time🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tyson lost that by a landslide🤣
Damn if Wilders jeans were any skinnier? They would be spandex........
Quite as then......and new!!!! lmao and gets no reaction 🤣🤣
And as time went on,  both men realized they were stuck in a time loop
We all had the longest stare off with our phone screens watching the stare off
From the last fight wilder couldn’t hear right..that why he needed the earphones..😂
eye to eye in story 😂
wilder looks so strong .. fury looks soft    cant believe if he wins
Its been said that Tyson is still standing there
Meh,,,,,hopefully wilder doesn't win. It'll ruin the big fight with AJ.
Legend said. They still starring till this day
The shirt on no shirt should be the other way around
Wilders Headphones: “If I could just, seeee, yoouu….TONIGHT!!!”  Duh duh duh duh dooda da da!!!     Who I Smoke!!!
Wilder needs to come out like Mike Tyson with trunks and a towel😂NO Costume NO facesheld No lights just boxing trunks and a towel
Deontay is overhyped trash..
Should be a good rematch. Fury has everything to loose and Wilder has nothing to loose. Wants that unification and Wilder is done if he doesn't win this one. I think it should be a breeze for Fury, mainly because Wilder really has little skill. I really hope he went to camp and learned to actually box, and not just use his normal size advantage and throw wild. This one is Fury's to loose.
Wilder lost the faceoff. It looks he does not wants to hear the reality that he was massacred in the last fight.
It’s how small the lady is standing next to them for me😂bomb squad 🦾
Boring fight... Tyson has won two times..c'mon don't wanna see again the same story
Deontay looking like a killer with sharpened skills ready to take some heads... Don't underestimate him
So stupid...
Wilder Will win
News flash. This just in, it's been four days later and these two men are still looking into each other's eyes 👀. Pause.
Wilder winner bro
Bummmm squadddd
Deontay is a certified bum.
Fury look like  he in the pub at the bar wait on a pint while wilder shit himself fury have fight won already 😳😴🤣
You first  No you first.
Vlad in the sauna vibes 👀
Does anyone else feel Fury is living rent free in wilders head?
Everybody makin jokes but Deontay look serious this time around dont be shocked if he wins
Tyson looks like such a slob! 😆 Complete with the Walgreens pajama pants..👍👍👊
It was the fresher hungry and more skilled fighter who won last time .You never know what happens next.
Wilder left as his costume became too heavy
Is that Ben askrens body double??
Wilder looks like the guy from The Black Eyed Peas.
Oh god…. Just make out already 😒
Wilder wearing headphones because he dont want Tyson to get into his head 🤣
the American people do not support their own champion. They are fanatics with no feeling for their own country and the champions it generates. Does this demonstrate the decline of values and a growing inferiority complex?    #BOMBZQUAD 🤴🏿⚔️🥊
When is part 4?
2 time needs to be put down hard
WIlder is broken cant wait to see him dissapear.
The backup dancer repeating 2 time 🤣🤣🤣🤣 he dunno he ain’t got a job after wielder get knockout again his screaming 2 time like it’s  the end he Ned to find a new employer 🤣🤣🤣
Thats a long and awkward staredown.
Why does this look like a YouTube triller fight
Wilder has them headphones on to this day 😂
Bet u wont hit a mouthea fka 🎶
Apparently two time
Lol it be funny if they stay there all night.  Looking at each other
Wilder scared puppy 🐶
I guess deontay never heard how Fury almost died in a sauna to outlast someone else lol.
ONE'S TOO SKINNY AND THE OTHER ONE IS TOO FLABBY. HOPEFULLY THE FLABBY ONE WON'T CHEAT THIS TIME.
Silence because running ya mouth then Gettin yo ass beat is career ending for d.wildmouth
Lmao
Who the fook is that guy in the white shirt doe 😂🤣
Oh my god I don’t want to watch this fight again
I feel tired watching them
The craziest thing is people still support Fury even though he cheated 😆😂😭. They just don't want to believe Fury is not a real champ. This time Fury's gloves won't be as strong as they were last time 😉
I hope they triple the Paul vs Mayweather money and each get to retire. This is probably the best trilogy of my days.
Wilder is a coward for everything he was saying...how you talk so much stuff about someone ,but when you come face to face you fold like your mother ....
Wilders is going to take your head off you can't cheap with the gloves again and Wilders look sharp and serious about this figth he is going to expose Tyson fury and his fixing gloves..
Too much Fury fanboys here.
Go Tyson fury !!
Titans
They shouldnt even be screaming bomb squad🤣🤣
HAVE YOU SEEN MY BASEBALL ⚾️
J’ai tellement hâte de regarder ce combat
Wilder going to murder Fury. I can tell from the way he looks
Deontay wasn't comfortable
Tool time, Tool Time
Legend has it he still saying 2 time
Deonte! This time , you would be knocked out too but worsely, more humiliated than before.%100
Deontay watch for fury gloves maybe he put a block inside in this one's because he doesn't have power he has to use metal or sand inside the glove to has a chance to beat you again..
Dontay Staring a Hole thru Fury. He’s definitely focused this time.
Looks like a bad remarry.....
Wilder is listening to "hooked on phonics"
Playing on a loop in Deontays ears: "Yoooo I'll tell you what I want what I really really want."
Idk I like this wilder I won't be surprised if he actually  put fury down something is  changed 🤔.
That Deontae needs music to focus shows how scared and unfocused he is.
two time.......Fury bust your team's ear drums
Wilder gonna up his game... u heard it hear first. Not saying he will beat Fury but he will be a different fighter.
This fight only exist for BLM.  Put your money on Wilder, they already cooked this.
People will be kicking themselves in few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in bitcoin
There shouldn’t have been a second fight. Fury won the first one easy.
Deontay wilders fight promoting skills are like that of a wet paper bag
They don’t even look big like ufc fighters feel like Francis would out power these cats
Fury looking like he smoke work 😂
No way is Fury is 6'9!!
Wilder got beat so bad that when he got home he forgot he lost.
Wilder listening to “Hold my Hand” by Hootie and the Blowfish bc he’s scared to be up there alone
Fury put your gad damn shirt on. Your flabbing too much. Your not gonna win no best body competition there.
And still!!!
Wilder made every excuse in the book, I have zero respect for Wilder now. I do respect Tyson he is a true champion. We all know he won the first fight even though they call it a draw and he obviously TKO Wilder in a second.
Literally you can see furry is scared as shit 😭😭😭🤣🤣
Wilder gave him respect now 🥺🤣🤣🤣🤣
I hope furry will KO wilder again
Wow....fire will be in that boxing ring
Fury already lives rent free in Wilder's head, so those headphones did nothing.
'Too tired, Too tired, Too tired' Wilder after the 3rd round.
Bye bye Wilder
Rumor has it they still staring at each other
tyson fury lookin like the beast titan with that body
Wilder gonna get LAID THE FUCK OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Whys the bum got his head phones on.  And why does fury still have Frank and Bob as promoters.ufc pisses on boxing.fury a coward not facing AJ
2 TIME
Sorry but Wilder looks intimidated
Wilder gonna KO that boy
Is he sponsored by the headphones?
He won't be listening to them headphones 🎧 once Fury busts his eardrum again 🤣🤣
What a joke conference smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
Man everyone hating but I low key wouldn’t hate to see Deontay surprise everyone and come out fighting way better this time
Wilder is listening to Dr. Eric Thomas 😂
This a different deontay you can see it 💯😈
Did they just stare at each other for 6 minutes??? Wtf.
Legend has it that legend has it...
Wilder came out cocky and full of himself again. Thats why he’ll probably get beat again.
It the 3 match against ,deoty Wilder fans here✌️👑✨😊😎💪✊
He couldn't handle it without the headphones... even boxers are sensitive these days ..trying to act hard w his fingers in his ears what is this
Who cares...
Till this day!!!!
Wilder playing that Tyron Woodley "ill beat yo asss"
Why fury always dressed like he’s going through a mid life crisis
Those beats by dre?
🥊🥊🥊🥊
I just want Tyson Vs. Joshua already
They made love in this stare down.
How many times ???? Huh
Lmao
Wilder going to woop Fat Fury this time he got cheated last time.
Gypsy King by knockout in 8th
Legend says Fury still standing there.
Tyson!!!
Love is grand 😂
Deontay will get bomb squared again.
I think Fury beats him again for the 3rd time.
TGK The Gummy King, Fury all day.
New guinness book of record!!
The “He can’t hear you” guy made me lose it 2:29 😂
Gaye
Fury should have left shirt on with all that disgusting flab hanging out definitely not in shape looks awful
Tyson was afraid
who ever wins the staring competition wins the match
Tyson looks like melted ice cream. Leave the shirt on next time.
I think they told deontay Wilder to where the headphones so Tyson fury cannot talk to him and get in his head.
Both fighters are loud.  Fury doesn't shut up, and Wilder doesn't stop accusing everyone of cheating or something bad
Fury looking like a sack of potatoes
Let’s put a sponge-bob cut scene until they stopped staring at each other lol
Holy shit fury has long ass arms!
It is gay pride month so ...
Only thing missing from this stare off is the song "In your eyes".
Wilder listening to luke rockholds motivational "conceive, believe, achieve" speech
I see 👀Tyson furry was scared 😳 too talk trash in his face in this face off I see... Lol he looked a little 😅
What was that a staring contest or something?
We just gone have to wait and see what happens. All y’all thinking wilder scared because he not talking much and have headphones on y’all tripping. That man is Focus. Don’t know who gone win but somebody def getting put to sleep
Wilder was listening to 'Mama Said Knock You Out' by LL Cool J...
I hope Fury knocks him out in 3 rounds embarrassing him worse.
Wilder have too mutch gold on no legs after 5 minute ...
Someone make a 10 hours staredown video
This was the most awkward stare contest ever .
This is only because the don't have a promoter in between them. Obviously neither guy is gonna break eye contact so you need someone else to do it. It just became awkward and unnecessary, boxing gotta chill with this weird shit just to try and stand out from MMA
The guy behind fury looks like the fat guy from hangover Why tf is he talkin
If wilders trainer didn't tap him , they would be still starring ..
Can't wait to see what excuse D.W. is gonna have this time.
Wilder should take advice from the winners like floyd, Mike, and so on if he wants to fuck this guy up otherwise he should pray more maybe is possible for Dat way..
What is this big fat cousin doing on stage???
Lol I see he don’t have nothing to say this time
Wilder is not about this life. Homie looks like he just wants to go home
I remember when these guys actually liked each other.
I hope Wilder wins. But I don’t have a lot of confidence that’s he will
They better check Fury Gloves this time...
Who would have believed that Wilder could be this calm, maybe somethings are meant to happen to us, just so we could be less with words or actions. However, his calmness shouldn't be taken for weakness.
Intense  ? hahaha
Wilder go when music finish
Tyson is the worst fighter i think ive ever seen, he is just big and has a long reach….take a man like mike tyson with that same heavy weight size and tyson fury would last maybe 30 seconds..or just throw mike tyson in…
Two time??????????? Wtf it’s wilders fools that have deluded him in to this mess!!! He’s gonna get destroyed quicker this time!! Wilder no more. Bomb squad!!!!! Lol where were the bombs when he has staggering all over the place
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wilder standing like Franklin GTA5 when you idle 😹
This is going to real nasty.
Fury f*cked up soon
Wilder gonna win this
Fury win again  Wilder lucky punch is finish
Who the fuck is this dude or person!!! Alot of followers for me to see u for the 1st time !!! Lmao 🤣
Wilder gets a third chance which is remarkably unbelievable. He may have a chance this time since the Gypsy King is training at Pizza Hut.
🔥
Boxing is straight up fake news
2 things: Fury's buttocks go up to half of his back and this face off lasted longer than what the fight will last ...
lol deontay looks all intense while tysons just like 😕
Fury won the 2 fights
I went cross eyed trying to see who fold lol
Two Time ! He must be talking about how many times he precums around his momma
Its official... Dana white has taken center stage when it comes to combat sport... This is just a joke now
Hold the camera steady eh?
2 TIMES
Deontay just beat that mans soul for a whole round....TEAM WILDER... LET'S GOOO
If wilder comes in with the same focus and no non sense approach as this press conference and stare down..THIS SHOULD BE A BARN BURNER 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anyone else feel like this is absolute vintage tyson fury. Like the fury before the vlad fight. This version of tyson looks like he will slap your nan up and all you could do about it is make him a cuppa. Gypsy King rules all!!!! 👊👊👊
Didn’t wilder get a new team and trainer?? I think this fight is going to go different
"Two time" guy needs another line FFS
Wilder is gonna lose again
What an idiot I hope deontay gets layed out. It’s so embarrassing how can he do that
Deontay is in for another long night.
“Y’all close up for me aight” -Janitor
2x2x2x2x2x2= Bomb squadddd!!
A STIR-DOWN, DON'T GET YOU A 'KNOCK OUT...' SO SAVE IT FOR THE FIGHT... THEY LOOK STUPID... WITH THE (fake) "COVID MASK MEN" ALL AROUND THEM. LOL
Lmao wtf is this wilder just wants to kiss him till this day !
This was so cringe, wilder could see fury waiting for him to face off,  he acted as if he didn't know what was going on. 🤣🤣🤣
Tusza wygra nad chyrlakiem ;)
Whatever
Tbh I’m not interested in this fight at all :/
Plot twist: Tyson was under arrest and couldn't move from that position.
Get a room.
Fury might DIE 😬😬
Tyson's got an arse above and below his belt.
This was another in the sauna moment for Fury.
A 5 week training camp unbelievable- boxers now are a joke compare to the 80’s
Damn Tyson humble wilder he doesn't want to talk hahaha
If i was there im not gonna make turn either....
We do the same when awake as when dreaming: we only invent and imagine him with whom we have intercourse—and forget it immediately
Why is too long like this?? Wilder listening his song to face fury 😂😂😂
Fury won the stare down so In his mind he's won the fight!
Get off the man nuts 🤣🤷🏽‍♂️ he lost last fight what is there to talk about ! He don’t wanna talk 🤷🏽‍♂️ so why go back n forth , he stared fury down for 6 mins ‼️ he ain’t scared !! He can’t out talk fury plus if he was scared he wouldn’t have took the fight . He focused 💪🏼Win , lose or draw 🤷🏽‍♂️ he will more than likely win tho Fury too confident / don’t take him serious
Fury is built like a barrel of milk 😆
Bum squad
Walmart vs Target
Tyson, you should've listened to your dad, Wilder will definitely sleep you in July..
From the long ass faceoff they look to be exactly same height
AND STILL!! those are some big boys, don't get hit lol
Wilder shampion wbc triology 3..
Wilder in 3 rounds Furey took this game to his head with his fat ass
Wilder turned ssj2 in this video
They'll be sharing a ramen noodle by the end
people forget.. when u lose the way wilder did, and have the time to really sit and feel the embarrassment… the cocky man who stops speaking and get calm with it, can be your worst opponent… because he isn’t fighting now for the same reason as before!!… and i think Tyson fury realised that in the stare off! I think this fight is going 12hard rounds
What happen to Anthony Joshua
Sue son, sue son, sue son, sue son
Wilder bounce back CHAMP
Dude this is so gay
Wilder is an excuse machine..He’s probably already planning his reason for losing next
longest, most uncomfortable stare down I have ever seen
Kinda cringing he trynna be all tough
Make sure the gloves stay on during this fight...
I wonder what excuse he's got lined up this time 😂
What Dontay exhibits here and since the last fight is what happens when you infantilize an individual. It’s the same thing that happens when you infantilize entire groups of people…they behave like infants and things get exponentially worse for them very quickly.
They were playing who laughs first
‘No u’
I love Shane fury. Entertainment at its finest. But he's a good brother. U can see see the strong bond in the furys
Tyson knows he's done
"AnD nEw>" Bwahahahaha!!!!
Not sure why we’re doing this again but I guess I’ll buy it.
Won't their camera flash finish? Them reporters should learn how to economize! 😂😂
Deontay with them ugly ass Balenciaga sneakers socks😂😂 black people wear anything if u make em pay too much for it smdh
Wilder got some shit on his mind. Gonna be a good fight
Wilder is a dirtbag. Permanently oppressed, a perpetual victim.
I’m black and would love to root for wilder but he has a 2 grader IQ and it seems his team does too if his fight IQ Matches his actual IQ I’m afraid he’s going to get knocked out again
Wait wtf this is actually happening ?
That was better than the Floyd Paul fight.
I ate 2 chicken wraps until the end of this video
Wilder listening to Mike Tyson speech 💬
How many times? Two time! 😆
Till dis day,till dis day staring till dis day!😅😅😅
Fury looks a little flabby. I hope he did the work.
Hopefully he redeems himself
In headphones : inhale - exhale.
Wilder much better
Now wilder is gonna win smh now sports has turned lame as hell
Has wilder got heels  on in his shoes? He seems to have grown a couple inches since last year aswell😂😂😂
This time, check fury's god damn gloves make sure them ate not almost bare knuckles!
That big one said " they all P#$$i%s Tyson " DAMN.
Wilder after Szpilka fight is not the same.
Again????? Why???
"tWo tImE"
Is wilder gonna walk out naked? Yk, cos his outfit was what cost him the fight (allegedly)
Wilder is going to hurt fury very bad
How many time??
Who's the fat blob someone give him a burger so he can shut up.
Hope the fight last longer than the stare down.
Fury is built like a tank lol, wilder looking like a grasshopper as always 😂😂😂😂😂
Tyson watch out...it looks like deontay prepare very Well... Maybe He also make  Meditation to improve his skills...my Suggestion is to you also prepare very Well and Not only "Gypsy"!!!
Boxing seems more and more staged these days. It just looks like someone is going to take a dive. There's a weird vibe here
We a A man stop talking I would be nervous
That had to be the longest face of in boxing history 🤣🤣🤣
He need a t shirt
Deyontay has a hell of an opportunity here. You better represent, keep that same energy and come out to the big payback by James Brown
Awkward
Come on the Gypsy King👑
Tyson looks like he just came from the local pub
so many questions about all this lol  are those water shoes?  I'm just going to stop there are too many questions for this lol
I wanted them to start making out aggressively after that intense stare, the sexual tension sheesh
Wilder such a Clown 🤦🏻‍♂️🤡
holyshit, this guys are extremely tall
Who blinks first
This is probably the most advertisement this fight will get lol. Fury 3-0
Two time
Why does that guy keep saying 2 time?
FACE OFFS ARE SO GADDDAMN UNCOMFORTABLE I HATE THEM
Its all very gay
Someone’s gonna win this staring contest.
Wilder is gonna knock him out
Why furys fatass brother takin?
Two times my balls.. dude shouldn’t have won the first time IMO.. Fury should have won both..
i dont think fury gonna win this time but im sure it gonna be a good fight
Something just tells me this ain’t gonna end up going the way people think.
Deontay disassociating so hard. It's like watching a child, man already lost mentally so sad.
This reminds me of the time he stayed in that sauna with Klitschko way before they thought and said him lasting longer in there was a big mental victory which he felt helped him years later to win and how it stuck in Wladimir’s mind
I feel like Tyson fury would have stayed there until fight day
How many times did that guy shout 2 time?
This is insane
wow y'all must have forgot he was bleeding from his ears about to be 2 times
Just look at Fury, now does that body scream world champion boxer to you? But he is.
DW looks intimidated
This is ridiculous! Fury should be fighting Joshua!
Wilder was listening to New Order’s Perfect Kiss on repeat…..
Deontay is looking too intensitive now.
Two time
Stupid match that shouldn't be happening.
Why Not Fury vs Joshua?!?!?! 🥱
Это реванщ да

Wilder was listening to one trick pony by Paul Simon I reckon..
Wilder already been beat twice off fury so this fight is irrelevant
Boring
Wilder with the tall shoes in this one
I can imagine Wilder has the Rocky theme playing through his beats
Fury will win again ,again and again!
2x “ dude stfu please why the hell he keep on repeating that
Fury never loses except his weight of course
I think Wilder has a chance this time Tyson Fury won the first fight obviously the second but this time I think wider might pull it off
Wilder is a boss! Wilder is coming for cheating Furys head! Boooooooommmmmmbsquaaaaaaad! 💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣
That is not stand off if u wear sun glasses.
Was he saying two times winner or two times loser? I wasn't sure
Wilders going to get his ass kicked again both of them don't even have a chance against Joshua
Тайсон победы
Tandeta klauny🤬
Fury has already won and he knows it.
Someone pls call me when they’re tired staring at themselves
In mexico when we see dogs acting hard like that. We just throw a bucket of water! 🤣
For all saying why, because it‘s 1:1 and not 2:0. Wilder clearly won the first by knockout, ther referee saved Fury by starting the count later, he was well over 10 secs knocked out. Nevertheless it endef by a draw. 2nd fight fury whipped the floor with Deontay.  I‘m looking forward to this fight and hope that wilder wins this
Boring
I hope fury beats him again 💪
How many times ??
Tyson is a boss
WILDER👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
TAKE IT EASY BROTHERS 😁
When the fighters don't want to trashtalk, their corners had to step up😆😆😆
Two time - whoever that is needs a kick in the nads
Is it just me or does Wilder look leaner right now?
Wilder let's get it
The music is more important
Super awkard
I told deontey to work on his leg game man!! He gonna get chopped down with them sticks!!
Wilder finally learned how to shut his mouth for his own good.
Fury looking fat and still beating everyone. Pure talent.
Fury is going to beat the shit outta Wilder 🤯
The Bronze Bomber will win by KO!
Bum squat
Fury bros ..got that bond like the Diaz bros ..unbeatable ...when his bro lifted Tyson in the air under one arm and put his hand in the air at the end when he won . Like lifted Tyson on his shoulder when he won last time I'll never forget it. Slung his hand in the air .that was a big deal in its self..Shane out no slouch...was good to see that love between brothers ..Shane got his back big time. They a Good team
Fat guy running  his big mouth won't  even last one round
Fury chewing at his soul.
The sweater around the waist was too heavy... Wonder what's the next excuse.. lol
Fury looks like his been hitting McDonald's instead of punching bag.
All of his “posse” crowing round him for emotional support 😂😂 all of Tyson’s team knows he’s absolutely fine and more than comfortable up there and left him to it
I hate skinny pants.
Looks like mortal kombat is stuck on a loading screen
hope deontay has Spotify premium
Fury doesn't want the third fight that was why the case when into arbitration. Wilder will murder Fury in third fight
Wasn't fury supposed to fight anthony joshua ?? Just asking...
Rip wilder
How many pictures can they take when Fury & and Wilder aren’t doing fuck all 😂
Bum squad getting there arse whooped again
Fury got robbed!
So what if fury loses???🤔🤔
This was the longest face off i have seen 😂😂
This is hilarious !! The stubbornness and determination in both !! It’s gonna be a good fight !!
I have zero interest in this fight, Wilder already got the shit beat out of him
why is fury's shirt off and wearing those pants😅
I'm a fury fan but he looks out of shape.
Wilder: I keep these headphones on to keep the blood from running out my ears.
Who fast forwarded it ? Btw, a very memorable face off. We’ll see if Wilder is smart enough.
A week later.........
Come on fury
The fight knowbody asked for.
Wilders legs are anorexic!
Deontay, loses this trilogy fight is an old gist , fans  can predict that to happen. Fury, lost to deontay big headline 😳
Deontay looks in much better shape.
talking in shutters
This looks like a mr beast challenge
TWO TIMES!
I hope Tyson beats the shit out of wilder and then dose the same to aj.come on Tyson
Why is Tyson so fat???
Fury is gonna lose. I mean look at his body. He gas dad bod
Fury won.
Fury is fucked.  He better get ready to be ko'd in the first round.
Is Deontay sponsored by beats? Or just a massive wanker?
The intensity from wilder. He’s guna be different next fight
RUBBISH
Mr Fury is going to hand him his ass again. Wilder should have took the money to step aside. Now he is going to get beat in front of his fans and country. The gypsy kind fly's high.
Yeah wilder won this one
Tyson, will put him full stop.
Blame Squad!!
Wilder might get some payback this time
Damn called him a 4 eyed prick
I am a AJ fan but I really hope Wilder wins. Man is a warrior.
Who won??
TWO TIME!
The face of Fury ahahahhahahaah. Wilder is fu**ed.
deotay wider needs to work on furys body , he couldnt stand the onslaught hes got bangs of fat on his side.
1-0
We will see what happens when fury’s opponent hasn’t had a pre-fight mental beat down,billy joe is now retired because of his mouth 🤣
Ideally Fury wins and we can eventually get him and Joshua.
Another beating or a awww revenge  Interesting days ahead…I can’t waitooo
Fat guy: “look at me, look at me belly, look at me fat, look at me back love handles, take me all in”
Lost I'm each others eyes😍
Who first blink lose this game 😂
Wilder just might win this one!
Why Fury look like a biscuit 🤣🤣
Wilder is a punk
Wilder looks more scarier but can’t miss judge fury
no video required, a screenshot with “BoMb SqUaD” and then “2 time” on repeat would have the same results
Why though? Nobody really want to see wilder loss another to fury.  I want fury v AJ
Wilder is a CLOWN.
Breaking News….Deontay Wilder was listening to “Born to make you happy” by Britney Spears.
Nobody seen fury swallowing during the stare down and looking nervous or is that just me. It has to be reason he was ducking a 3rd fight i know if i had confidence i could beat a man a 2nd timed id be happy to take a big payday and do it again
what was wilder listening ? Dream On  by  Areosmith ... or maybe the Tyron Woodleys song ? in and out witj love ? XD
Tyzoom fury look scare can't move😂
Does it take that long to face off?
It is So Sad To See all the Tyson Fury Supporters and Deyonte Wilder Haters!!!!!. How do You Support a Known Cheater!!! 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯. Just Goes to Show the Absolute Weak Character that Some of You Have!!!! Deyonte is Looking at Wilder Just for what He is and Has Always Been and Will Be  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I guess Wilder needs those headphones because Fury has now become Professor X since training with Sugar Hill.
Deontay visualizing a first round knock out 💣 and didn't want to be disturbed
Wilder thinks this is WWE
Wilder will smash Fury
Wilder looks like he's on crack
Look is obvious to men wilder is just SCARED.
Wilder lost the fight right here. His boxing career is already over.
Spanked part 3 omg thats gonna be epic spanking hahahahab
You four eyed prick! 🤣🤣 love tysons brother he's a fucking wild card
That song won't be there for you in the fight
Deontay is probably thinking, "how did I lose to a guy built like a bag of milk?"
Elon Musk: Time to test our long-awaited brain chip. See how two humans communicate on 7 different languages:
Nice pyjamas Tyson  fury 🤣🤣
Wilder has and is still scared of only one fighter till this day:FURY
God....imagine starting some shit with someone and then these 2 roll up at your door! What u gonna do??? Tell me!....I think tysons brother scared deontay and his "2 time" crew 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please two times to who?
why are faceoffs so long in Boxing
Its so funny lol tysons brother would knock em all flat out sparko!!!!!!
I thought it will be a match between Fury and Joshua ?
Last time they all spoke a lot from wilder side and everyone knows what happened so at least they have wisdom to shut up this time and not say much. Wilder can never ever beat fury never in million years. His best chance was first time and couldnt do it
What do you think he is listening to in his headphones?
Wilder was listening too tyson said knock you out . #gogyspyking
God damn those camera shutters!
🎵🎶strumming my pain with his fingers... (1 time) singing my life with his words.... 04:32 🤣
Tysons win already!!! Mental game and he came out top trumps!!!!
Team Fury aint no joke.... they'll fuck Deontays shitty little bomb squad up any day of the week
2 time 2 time 2 time 2 time..........2 time 2 time 2 time..........2 time 2 time, wilder gonna bitched again
Cameraman be like: Hey our memory cards are now full!
Tysons brother would flatten all of them bums on stage!!!!
Wilder is absolutely gonna bomb again there's your bomb squad 2 times 2 times 2nd ear drum lolz
Wilder is intimidated
Big boy with the curly hair talking mad shit he’d be the first want sleeping on the ground
What’s with the beanbag in the white shirt
I wonder what Wilders excuse is gonna be this time?
They are making love
At least AJ is sponsored     by  BEATS.  Wilder had 2 buy his.😎😎😎
Tyson Fury has to be the most bad built Champion ever.  Is that his ass or his back I’m looking at?  Why is his shirt off? 🤦🏾‍♂️
All jokes aside respect to these 2 legends and this stare down will go down in history
Wow I mean tyson shit it 😴🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My 2 puppies waiting for me to give the command before they eat🤣🤣
Fury will kick his ass again ! Not more not less !
I feel like Wilder has officially lost it and he may be going in there for blood this time around but we shall see. Looks like he actually has hate in his eyes this time and that can be scary, but Fury is definitely the better boxer from what we saw last time.
Why did they stare down for like 15 minutes? Shits awkward
Fury gonna exposed this time ,lets go  Wilder
They're falling in love with each other 😂
6.15 Tyson and his brother putting it to the hecklers lol “I’ll kick you in the mouth you four eyed prick” The Brits make the yanks look so tame
Black vs. White.  BLM will have. a field day with this if Bomb Squaf gets his ass knocked out
Bye bye wilder
Boxing is now a joke... This wasn't the fight to make
Wilder lost twice already (yes the first one also), and he's still acting like a hardass for some reason, as if tyson has a sliver of fear
Fury never in shape! 🤦🏾‍♂️
PEE ONtay went From mouthy to mute
"Two times" or does some dumb wilder fan really like the show home improvement???
I didn't know an extra from goodfellas was there.  "TWO TIMES!" said it 53 times though.
Was very tense until Seth from Superbad got involved.
Tyson Fury is still stood there now.
Did they get a good enough look at each other ?
Wilder song - Killing me softly )))
Im goin for the American even if he most likely will lose.
intenses
I take this as Wilder is not interested in promoting this fight. He is gonna make Fury do all the heavy lifting in terms of selling this PPV. Wilder is salty about how the last fight went and he is extra salty that Fury tried to duck him.
Both are blind ))
Isn t he supposed to fight joshua ??? What happened to that fight ???
Wilders playlist went on so long it flipped over to his sad songs list.
Tyson will put a dent on the other side of wilders head to match the dent he already has from the last fight
Wilder looking Taller 😯😯😯
Deyonce acting cold and not talking smack is gonna help him win....you still have to have skills.
This fight won't happen. Wilder will pull out because of some wild shit.
Fury going to beat your arse down three times in your own backyard  how does it feel You dosser
Well that was shit!
Lil sus
They were juz kidding
What a disrespectful joke wilder is
What's wilder excuse this time the headphones are to heavy for his head that's why hell get, knocked out again 😂😂
Fury with a smirk the whole face off 😂
“You hang up.” “No, you hang up.”
Even if Wilder wins, it’ll still be 2-1😂😂😂
Probs to both guys. Easy to get carried away in such a situation.
I wanna say I apologize to Wilder because before now  I had always said he would never be able to face Tyson fury,  he has proved me wrong at least. I guess this trilogy will be brutal
Tyson fury is about to beat that ass again. Can’t wait. ✊🏻✊🏻
Deontay is humble now, he’s not talking all that shit after he got put in his place by this dude. Ill still root for Deontay in this fight though. I believe he will redeem himself.
I've beat you and your trainer😀 How's that for a gangster?
Man fury looks so out of shape
Tyson is going to lose this time
Fury's brother would level that cocky little kid shouting two time in no time.
Just like the sauna with klitchko - he won the battle
Wilder salty he lost😂
They still milking this fight smh nobody wants to see this every one knows fury going to win. We want to see Fury vs AJ.
Fury gonna whoop that black boys ass again.
10 minutos de estatua kkk
He gone KO fury this fight guaranteed
Wilder hv no chance to win.. no technique, only power
Tyson fury is not an entertaining fighter
I hope that headphone isn't heavy on wilder I won't take excuses this time
Уайлдер победа нокаутом
The whole bum squad as delusional as ever.
Deontey is Knocking Fury out in round 5 .... Mark it down!
Fury already won the fight
TU THA
Tyson is still standing there looking at deontay wilder To This Day
Dirty Fight #3..Lets Go No Rules 😎👍
Fury is gonna have a laugh with him wilder lost twice and unless money can buy him love gonna have lost number 3 and no way back .
Wilder lost 'TWO TIME'
It's almost like Wilder didn't want to be there, he'll have the same feeling after a round or two. No more excuses, no one to blame. Tyson is just the better boxer.
Shiba inu coin !!! 🚀
Kofi b scared...
Wilders a beaten man he's people should be ashamed of him an that stupid parrot beside him 2 times yes 2 times wilders got the snot beat outa him
the reason wilder left was casuse of his couch... he came and signaled him at 5:57... not gonna lie didn't like that he looked away first (doesn't matter though wont decide who wins the fight)
Wilder listening to "On The Floor" by Ice JJ Fish.
Let's go BUM squad
Toooooo Taaaaaaa
I love that Fury's brother always shows up on a hype.
Wilder already won
Deontay Wilder has already lost this fight, his body language tells the story. Can we just fast forward to Fury vs Joshua.
The Trilogy!
Fury looks scared
Why do Americans say the same 'ish over and over again and think they are winning the argument/debate/confrontation 😂😂
wilder wineer
Haven't I seen this fight before?.
Hope Wilder learned how to fight lol
If Fury beats Wilder then turn around and beat Joshua........Fury is the greatest boxer ever.
Curly said, 'Bum Squad.'
Im 100% sure they didn't wanna stare that long but since they were going for so long it would be awkward of they just left
Wilder dillusinal,  just like his minions. Clowns, them!!
Lmfao tyson beat him twice tho right? Why even have the trilogy tyson is the GOAT and everyone knows it
Wilder has to conquer the fear he has of fury
Terrible for boxing, not even interested,
Amazing 6minutes looking eachother😂😂
Wilder is the most stupid boxer ever. Fury will take him to school again.
Deontay is less of a boxer than Fury for sure and the match will most probably end up the same way... But that one punch KO power is something so unpredictable, that it still gives him confidence for such a staredown after getting whopped in the last fight
Fury is strong fighter ,  can't you see the face of wilder he's scared and blink 😂 All support to fury from Morocco 🇲🇦
thats a fucking embarrassment
Fury is strong fighter ,  can't you see the face of wilder he's scared and blink 😂 All support to fury from Morocco 🇲🇦
2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2=delusional
Wilder has the right brand of headphone for what’s coming.
Wilder will win 🏆👌🙌
Legend has it Deontay is still staring “till this day!”
🤣🤣 wilder = 🤡
Omg fury looks so bad...
Y is this funny
World's first  live stare out context
Tyson fury punks him and knocks him out everytime hes a thug Dozzer and an actor with 💩 for boxing skills
Prolonged eye contact has been thought to release phenylethylamine, a chemical responsible for feelings of attraction. It has also been thought to release oxytocin, the love chemical most closely associated with longer term bonding and commitment.
Gay
Wilder vs AL BUNDY
Глаза свои там оставили просто  😳😳🤪😵
Nobody wants to see this sh#$ anymore
This stare off became awkward af at some point lmao
Phony another  fixed  ass whipping   don't bet and lose ur mo ey again  this bro is fake 😤  😒
Fury sees it in his eyes he is in for a long night
Deontay was the one cringy, tyson broke eye contact a few times but deontay didny stop staring at him lol. What a cringy staredown
Wilder lost when he walked away
wilder listening to backstreet boys "you're the one for me, you're my ecstacy.. you're the one i need"
2 time means you’ve lost at least once 🤣🤣
A you Fury fans taking this shit as a joke ... We'll see july 24th
Wilder . I think what you think 🤔 Furry . I think what you think 🤔
Wilder skips leg days.
Tyson still in better shape than deji
Would be better if they had one of those fairground punch machines.
Still have a feeling this fight wont happen .
This wasn’t intense lmfao this is just awkward
Is this. The third fight ?
Wilder looked like Biden, clueless with headphones on at a media event until someone told him what to do, Go Tyson!
i think, one of them proposed finally
Ilove u wilder ur my brother
From what i hear, they are still gazing at each others eyes
Those headphones are heavy as fuck.
Is chubby fury really flexing his vet horrible physic, i hope his game will be much more spectacular. Because damn he looks terrible
Tyson continued the stare down with no one
Tyson Fury is one of the biggest motivation for the world.....
I saw Deontey walk away ..thats the thing about a staredown..someone loses before the fight..careful what u wish for..Gonn b close..but Fury will triumph.
2 time
Deontay o tun fe je iya abi. Bobo yi i a tun lu e! Ah, Deontay, sa asala fun emi re!
Fury gonna dun his dance again 3rd time round lol ha ha ha
Didn’t Charlie z already knock out wilder? #p4pbest
je te tiens tu me tiens .......
Tyson Fury is definitely not 6"9.
So hard to believe that the back-fat guy on left is about to beat up the lebron james looking-dude on the right for 3rd time.
Wilders headphone ran out of battery
Wilder standing on his tip toes (lmao)
Wilder is listening to “Darude - Sandstrom” to make his eardrums get thicker
i sense no fear in these men
This is a joke
At what point does it become weird two men staring deep at each other lol
I checked on this fight one month ago and it seemed it was never going to happen and now out of nowhere the press conference for the trilogy fight.... Wtf happened
The actual fight may take less time than this stare down.
Fury's really been working out for this,you can see from his prime physical shape that he's taken this fight super seriously ...doughnut believe all you read in dem comments folks
I just stared at 2 men staring at each other for 6mins straight
so surprised people care about boxing, it's so lame
Fury's giving Wilder that " I've exposed you" staredown.
I  like to Furry win just to pissoff Wilder younger brother sick forever
When your grandma says  just wait for the light baby
I hope wilder ain’t still been skipping leg day
Fury’s body language he’s leaning back like he knows he just unleashed a beast no loaded gloves this time
Wow that was corny. Guy had no interest in being a part of this obviously.
He lost the first 2 fights but sure keep knocking his ass out until he gives up I guess?  Im sure Anthony wont mind waiting.
Only kids do that
https://youtu.be/ip7XbP3nnHs
It must be love
Wilder trying to win something but even lost the stare contest.  Also my guess for his music is "Hit me with your best shot" - Pat Benatar
so, this is 6min I'll never get back
Wilder is big no doubt about it but here in front of Tyson, he looks like 180 pounds lol
Fury looks a little bit out of shape tbh
Tyson is still standing there.somebody tell.hes gone
Deontay better not come out looking like a transformer again came out wearing a suit that weighed more than him
Is fury heavier than last time?
Worlds longest staring contest
Wilder looks like he lost already lol his spirit looks broken
Wilder has fear in his eyes  He is scared
🚨Unbelievable so much fake adderall, xanax, hyrocodone, and more drugs out there . FDA finally approves therxprescription.com to distribute quality medications worldwide🌎. They're fast and reliable
Fury thinking "God damn i cant hold this gut in much longer 🥵"
That sucked  that  guy saying ‘let’s go bomb squad ‘ ‘two time , two time , two time ‘ over and over .
จ้องกันแบบเก็บเอาไปฝันได้เลยว่ะ ฮ่าๆ
Thoo thaa thoo thaa thoo thhaa
Fury don't look 2 inches taller than Wilder... but he do look 10 yrs older!
You could tell they just wanted to hug each other
' happy - John legend '
wilder pls win bro !!!
Bum squad
Should have been fury vs AJ. This is a shit show. Defo ain’t gonna buy this on PPV. Free stream all the way
Wilder no more barking huh
Fury was looking for fear in wilder but what he saw was a beast... Fury body pasture changed from confident to passive with his hands at the back. Wilder is going you're knock out fury this time... Fury is going to be hurt badly this time around...
Hahaha Tyson won the face off too
First time i look at a staredown an an advertisement kicks in🙄
Everyone want to watch this to see someone get knocked out. This is the heavyweight fight that has everyone invested. This will do 1 million buys easily.
Get this clown D! GO BOMBER!
Man this nigga mean business. And he bout to stand in that
Bumsquad lmao 😅😅
Wilder: thinking about his next excuse after losing this fight  Fury: ur smart…getting good money for getting ur ass beat again
Let's go Fury!!!
Tyson fury’s so fat😂🤣 #wilderallday
Someone explain, why are they fighting a third time??🤔
Wilder is listing to stop dragging my heart around ha ha lol
выдающиеся гипнотезёры
Why? Did wilder learn to fight in a year or something?
Rumour has it they're still staring each other out TILL THIS DAY! TILL THIS DAY! TILL THIS DAY!
Talked shit last time and lost his belt. Nothing to be said this time but to take your belt back. Yeah I get it.
Guys. How many times?
deontay come on... bury this fake gypsy, fake boxer, total flabby dossa that DID cheat... fking joker
Deontay looks focused
Why so much hate on Wilder.
He drops fury this time. I'd rather pay to watch cartoon network for a month.
Tyson by KO, again...
Wilder : This is the last time i'll be seeing your face ! Fury : Man, this dude is looking deep into my soul ! 🤣
The Fury Clones are in the Building!
Really great Fight, but they where just standing there for way tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long. Kinda like Kindergarten...
Well, This was bloody awkward.
BORING. NOBODY IS INTERESTED IN THIS GREEDY MONEY FIGHT COWARDS!
You can't win Tyson fury in mind warfare! 😂😂😂
they about to make love
Wilder will fall again by this dude who looks like dadbod !
Why can’t they just let them stare each other down without someone else from each side trying to intimidate them aswell talking shit  that brother Shane always has to get involved as if he’s fighting did it with chisora in Manchester years ago. and you may call it support but real men dont need that kind of support especially just to stare down another man lol just baffle me these people
Fury will be humbled that coward he is a cheat
Wait are they fighting again?
Boring
If Wilder comes in with the same strategy, it is going to be the same result. He better not come in with that heavy ass suit !
He's going to kill that man in the ring, wow the intensity. Let's go!!!
🤣🤣🤣 lmfao 2 time haha he got smahed 2 time it's gonna be 3 time you melt 🤣
U could hear Eddie Earn counting his money in the back!! 😂😂
Tyson fury body look awful for athlete
I think fury gonna get Slept just by The way Wilder stopped show boatin! But The Gipsy king has proved most doubters wrong before .. tyson is still a muched more skilled fighter but ... one punch in The heavyweight can end It all especially wilders .. just that he aint screamin bomb squad is scary . Maybe we get To see a different Wilder or he will get out classed ... lets go !
It got weird.
Why have i just watched two men stare at each other for 6 minutes and 37 seconds
Yup tyson lost this one he blinked first lol school yard shitttt!!...cant wait for these two to mash each others faces in 😆😅
Very sus
I missed something.... Fury was gonna fight Joshua first ?
Dude shouting 2 time needs to get off the phone to his girl
Face off fight-Fury won
I've a funny feeling that Tyson's brother Shane (Curly hair ) could scrap in all if need's be..🤔
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.   Here’s a reminder of how much God loves you! God bless🤍
I say double knock-out
We wanted fury vs Joshua
Fury is shell  shocked he saw the killer in wilders eyes
What a weird shaped body for a boxer like fury. Big fat dosser
Deontey 🥊🥊🥊🥊 will demolish Fury👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽 !
Fury is King !!!!! Easy Win, Easy Money !!!
You got this big sloppy belly man that ain't never knock nobody out he has Charisma he knows how to talk but Wilder clearly beat the guy in the first fight and they saved him white privilege does play a huge role his glove was superfloppy he's known for cheating he's known for doing cocaine and steroids ..!!! like why would you guys want to cheer for somebody like that I know why it's because he's white it doesn't matter what he done in the eyes of racist white people that want to see a white man beat up a black guy unfairly
I think i will hear TWO TIMES in my head rest of my life....what d fu was that.
All these people in the comments is bitchs hating on wilder....fury is obviously a cheater....it's about redemption just watch
Look at the state of fury the fat mess
Legend has it they are still staring at each other.... TO THIS DAY!!!!!
Im team fury and scared for wilder 😂😂
Buy bitcoin
Am I tripping balls hear??
Longest Face-off ever?
He dont want tyson to get in his head thats why hes wearing headphones
Tyson doesn't look in the best of shape I hope isn't taking this fight lightly I do believe if this fight ends in a knockout wilder will be the man standing vast superior punching power and if I was wilder I would attack Tyson fury with some heavy body shots , wilder isn't a great boxer but a deferstating puncher ,and shouldn't be underestimated which I thing the fury camp is doing
Professional fighter vs professional victim
Dumbest face off I’ve ever seen😂
Wilder how could you let an out of shape White boy beat you, you are in too good a shape to let that happen!!!!!
Love at 3rd sight.
Now that's interesting ❤️
Legends says Tyson Fury is still standing there
Actual wilder won this when fury put his hands behind his back. BoDy laNgUAge 1o1. I hope he’s improved his skills tho . Cant wait #bombsquad
Wake me up when their done
always nice to see shane fury offering wilders brother on...it would be a fight i would love to see outside in the car park
What’s he listening too that’s more important lol 🤪
Tyson "Flat Ass" Fury 😂
Bomb squad more like bum squad 😂😂👍
Bombsquaaaaad!
Oh well, guess we gotta have the same starters ( Wilder vs Fury ) before we get to mains ( Fury vs AJ)
Wilder was calm and focused I love him ❤️🦁
Bomb Squad! 💣
Leaving your headphones on is like wearing your glasses during a staredown. Its a crutch or "safety blanket"  shows weakness. He's shook lol he'd still beat my ass though haha but he's already behind in my books because of this.
3rd whooping coming and an end of career 😂👊
The height 🥶
Lmao deontay a fake
One thing is for certain...Wilder still has the hardest punch in boxing.  He stands a huge chance.  Would not like to see Fury lose like that.  He was dropped twice in their first meet.  I rooted for the gypsy king on both their fights.  However, anyone who is dismissing Wilder better think long and hard.  I would not sleep on Wilder. He is one punch from setting the record straight.  He is also out for blood and vengeance.  He is at his most dangerous.  I hope Fury is as prepared for this fight as he was for the last one.  There is no shame in sticking and moving Champ.
wilder at least had music  poor fury was just taking it all in sober
One gaint step for the Fruit Bat to win in evolution, one reverse step for the Mankind
So boring fury will win again who cares. Plus if fury did lose will prob be another rematch ffs. 🤦‍♂️
CHECK 👁👁👉🥊🥊👈👀 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
Wilder the king...💯💪🏾🔥🔥👹
And new . What a joke wilder gonna take his third beating . He’s got what one lucky punch in 2 fights .
Love?
The 2 metre rule or heard immumity? Vocid virus wins
Ayy If you didn't know. It's 2 time boys
Lol Wilder knows his ass is already kicked
How do they not laugh
Fury body looks horrible
Fanboys will cry after this one 😥😭😰
Make sure the gypsy king dont cheat again, fury is dead this time around
Why is wilder doing the Michael Jackson stand up
Cringe
That stare down shit stupid as fuck to me
That's 3 times. 4th one incoming.
They both are afraid of Jake Paul.
УАЙЛДЕР ПОБЕДА
Wearing the headphones.. TO THIS DAY!
I like both fighters, but I still wanna see Fury beat his ass again lol
Bro you can cut the sexual tension with a knife.
Lets see frank warren and Eddie Hearn fight
Farce
Tyson looking a bit tubby compared to usual. That was previously a metaphor for his mind state. Wonder if it still is..
They use to be friends even during face offs…. Not anymore??
Whos the fat bloke with curly hair?
Wilder via KO to setup a fourth match
lmao why bother taking a lot of photos in that 6 minutes of face off? wasting a lot of memory card space + all photos look the same 🤣 stupid photographers
It’s not the same without a Dana White n the middle
Look what damage Tyson Fury has done to him. 😂
Wilder's skull on the left is kapput from the last fight, he is actually never allowed to fight again.  Why doesn't anyone ask their doctor whether they can fight.  the boxing association, makes a huge mistake.  if something happens wilder i will sue the association myself.
Wilder trying to act like he doesn't care lol
Wilder Via K.O. 4th round.
Somebody get Tyson a rocking chair and the paramedics! He's about to go into cardiac arrest! Quick, call his Momma!
I see stiffness 2 time
Looks like Wilder has grown 3 inches as he looks an inch taller than Tyson there  , he must have stolen his mother's high heels to intimidate the big man , don't think it worked 🤔 .
Intense is not the word I’d use.
Fury looks out of shape like he’s been partying too much recently
They made Fury fight this man again. He didn't want to do it but it's on now.
What ruined it is their teams acting all hard like they about to fight lmaoo
I really have no idea who will win this I no wilder got a beat down last time  but  I think   this will be a different fight and I'm a fury fan  respect 2 both of them
I don't know what video these repliers are looking at, but Tyson Fury is definitely rocking in the wrong direction. He's rocking backwards and forward, as if he's looking to pass out, while Deontay Wilder's rocking from left to right. It must be the Great White Hope Syndrome.
Come for wilder v Fury staredown Stayed for "bum squad" guy v "two times" guy altercation
Fury Beats Wilders ass Again & Again..And  Still..!!!!.....Long Stare Down....Gay As Fuck..!!!!!!
Boring
how immature to block your ears and eyes cause u suck at talking and piss yer pants whena better champion stomps onu.
Tyson like, ok, who's next for the staring contest?
Make sure a check his gloves 🧤 before and after this guy is a cheater
Wilder looks scared still
Deontay listening to “Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey if anyone was wondering  😂🤞
Anybody else expecting them to kiss? It was like watching a Hugh Grant film.
This isn't remembrance Sunday lads...
Wilder grew a beard so he can use it as an excuse for losing 😂
Bruh,don't get me wrong I like Tyson Fury but honestly he's the worst shaped professional athlete I've  ever seen...even old man Foreman and old man Larry Holmes didn't look this bad. ..but whatever...lol... go Fury!!
deontay is so sad. Immature child headphones on his ears. Pathetic. Fury won again.
Fury cheated, this time he wore no gloves at all 😂
Wilder wiht the glasses and earphones is just giving fury more things to say and take the piss out off him wilder realy has lost the plot
What's with 2x is Wilder's brain broken
Let's gooooooooooooooooooo
What excuse will Wilder be crying this time?
You can tell by the way the look into each others eyes that they are in love.
Why have them stare so long honestly
Wilder ego saying I'm scared I wanna go home
Throwing bronze smoke bombs💨💨💨
I'm a black man i rock with Wilder💪🏽🤴🏽
It will be the same result as the last one, no more excuses for wilder, the only difference i see in this fight will be, there's no one to save him by throwing in the towel
Seen a video of this this wilder chump learning how to throw a JAB couple of weeks ago ...legs like tooth picks .. 🤷🏻‍♂️ skinny failed basketball player turned into a failed heavyweight champion 💨💨💨
This is the zombie version of deontay wilder.
Fury rocking the dad bod. Gotta love it
Staring eye contest while the crew talks shit to eachother. Ridiculous.
Bum squad fury by ko in 9th
Fat Hagrid with big mouth in the back need to get slapped..
Reminds me Santhanam joke 😆
tyson fury should learn sign language
Roll on july 24th cant wait to watch wilder fold again
🤣 Wilder is basketball player 🤣 who won a bronze medal boxinging at the Olympics 🤣hes not world class professional level... that means..(bomb squad full of has beens) and never will be again
Why is this fight even happening, stop wasting peoples time for fuck sake
Gulliver's travel  I guess thats how the people sitting there gonna feel
Cheatson Floppy vs the bronze bummer 3.    Omg this sport son
Wilder wearing the headphones so fury don’t get in his head, goes to show he is already in his head. Wilder scared
Wilder wants his blood 💀😂
😂😂2 time 2 time 2 time What? He couldn't win😂😂Damn that was annoying, that fool repeating 2 time 2 time😂😂
Fury will lose this one,, you’ll see!!
Jesus wins at the end. Period. Wilder cant win against Fury. These demons are scared to death
This was so tense that I had to watch it two time.
Wilder is actually kind of skinny. Yeah he's cut but his shoulders are smaller than Fury and Fury doesn't exactly have a bodybuilder physique as he said.
You can hear Big John in the back arguing 😂😂😂.
" two time " sounds like a interesting fella
Waiting for body language "experts" to tell me who won the fight before the fight even happened.
Careful he'll claim the weight of his earphones n sun glasses affected his preparation if he loses😂😂Wilder n his mad excuses for losing are farcical😂😂 #Bumsquad😂😂
Get Fury to fight someone else come on, why this fight? Who cares?
That's 6 and a half minutes I'll never get back.
so .. um.. why is this fight happening again? Fury already beat Wilder twice
Tyson looks like the least looking of a boxer. Let alone BEING the best in the world i love him.
If wilder wins will there b a 4th ?
White champion everyone wants a white heavyweight champion
Come on fury 🙌
this is going to be a violent bout
To this day - 3:12
Legend has it the staredown is still happening 300 years later.
wilder if you don’t knock the shit talking out bruhhh 😤😤😤
Well Fury has won
Long yes, intense no.
He’s literally went out and found someone to hold his hand !
Why do they keep saying 2 times? Seems weird to call out how many times your opponent has lost to the opponent
How does Wilder deserve the chance to win the title after losing so badly?
I’m sorry did he say 2 times ?
Not a Dodgy Gloves this time
Watching these two stare each other was the best form of entertainment i had today.
Nobody is more delusional in sports than Wilder fans.
Sunglasses and headphones 😂😂like my mans Goggins said music is cheating 😂we all know what happens when those headphones come off we’ve seen it twice already
Try to understand Tyson fury was depressed because he got caught cheating in a sanctioned fight…. Go ahead and do some simple research… he loaded his gloves for a sparring partner as well… it’s on YouTube. #LookIntoIt
Deontay hiding them ears from Tyson “the eardrum popping gypsy”
Bunch of idiots yelling that stupid “bomb squad”
How many times ur team lost "two time" sayin like he got leg to stand on 🤣🤣
Wilder could stay there 'till the following morning
Well this came out of nowhere
It's a recreation of the Klitschko sauna story... mental battle is real.
Why does Wilder have headphones on?
Staring contest😂
What the fuck was that 🤥
Damn I went to the restroom, did groceries and came back and they're still staring at each other 😁😁😁😁
The guy that said "he cant hear you" while they're all shouting bomb squad, just made me laugh how he said it hahah
Wilder best have a lie down after standing for that long with those heavy headphones on
Dude with the curly hair would kill wilders whole crew
Fury is such a troll
Furys boy prbbly would of walked up and down wilders boys ass same way fury did wilder
YOU JUST WAIT HE'S GOING TO BLAME THE HEADPHONES
TYSON FUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRYYYY MY CHAMP
Wilder already made the adjustments to protect his ears.
Why are we having this fight again?
I knew Tyson wouldn’t turn first.
Tyson Fury has chosen suicide by Wilder
Wilder has been trained by a parrot
The most unhyped heavyweight fight in history
I feel sorry for Deontay just doesn’t look like he wants to be there... man hope both of them come out of the fight safe.
Tyson Fury is Dead Man Walking
Tyson hurt 😞 his pride looool
Deontay Leaves Tyson stares longer 😆
Only watched three min but Fury looked more fidgety.  Also, Fury looks like some gumpy ogre.  Lay off the chips mate.
What is “toothhaa”?
I used to like Tyson but this is all getting to his head. He will be knocked out this time. Pride cometh before the fall.
ARGA LEKEN BÖRJAR NU!!!!
At the end of this Fury was scared, he have seen a total different thing to deal with
Bum squad lol
Clearly Wilder won. Fury was doing things, talking, smiling and Wilder was cold and silent
Wilder is going to lose and get beat down like a little boy again, but much faster this time Tyson fury’s going to take it to him hard and take him out fast that is my prediction
Wilder now winning face.,,,Fury? then let's see, old man
Wilder tries to act like this psycho killer from movies. The problem is he got beaten before and it looks a bit silly at the moment :D
2 time loser!!
After 2 min i knew fury wouldnt look away, after the klitchko story
Who the fuk wanted fury vs wilder 3 ???
I love Furys expressions after Wilder walks off? Like "That was wierd"
It’s the sauna story all over again
Fighters  learn from their mistakes , but blaming  everyone and everything instead of looking at your soul, will give you the same end results. Instead of staring at fury for 6 minutes , LOOK IN THE MIRROR !! Tyson by KO
Load of pony
Pointless fight Fury’s done him twice already I would Of told him to do one
TOO TIRED TOO TIRED Wilders homie reminding Fury that it was only the costume that beat him last time. Excellent mind games.
Fury has a butt crack all the way in his back lol
Deontay Wilder vs Tyson fury streetfight? Fury no chance 👊
"BOMB SQUAD" Ermmm, the "bomb" has been diffused sir.
Wilder looked as if he's high and just going where the beat takes him
What the hell is this 2 time thing keep going on about
3:10 TILL THIS DAY
I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW WILDER CAN POSSIBLY LOSE WITH SUCH A BAGGY,FATTY “BOXER” AS FURY IS…???? HOW COME HE LOST ALREADY ONCE….  IT’S ALL RIGGED
Dude yelling "2 time" is mad annoying, we get it, he's a 2 time loser against fury, we get it.
I don't like either so being unbiased the old humble Wilder  needed a mentor he respected to reach his fullest boxing potential.
Why we doing this again. Already seen it twice
poor Wilder is going to blow himself up
At some point you just need to kiss!
Jona hill want all the smoke lol 🤷‍♂️
Lol, Fury is hella nervous here 😬
And when it was all said and done Tyson was the last man standing 🤭
Got a brew like two times in the long stare off 🤣
"two time" 😂🤣😅
Fury is shitting his pant, wlider is angry as hell, even the person behind fury can feel it
Twoooo times😂😂😂wtf
The longest 6 minutes
WIlder done listened to Stairway to Heaven three times by the end of that 😂
*_BIG DOSSA!_*
Longest stare down ever I reckon,give them tunnel vision lol
Wilder winning in knockout bet dat
Wilder is listening to tyson fury quotes
I am not excited as the 2nd fight it was but to be honest still going to watch it as a neutral fan...
Jesus, someone shut the dosser saying “two time “ every six seconds, are they broken? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
To all of y'all saying wilder ain't saying anything his scared y'all are stupid af that's like saying Floyd was scared of McGregor when they boxed because Floyd didn't do much talk either 😂🤡🤡
Imagine if they just stood there till July 24th 🤣
I got scared 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. How dare I enter into argument with either of these guys. I shit my pant already.
Even if Wilder wins it took him three attempts..its laughable. Absolutely nobody wanted to see this fight!
As long you psychologically get into the  other guys mental, you have him down. Whether you smile, talk smack, stay mute it's about the mental.
Fury gets knock out cold.
Glasses and headphones!! 🤣 Tyson is still in his head
Tyson don't look good
Deontay is gonna take his head off.
What song do you recon he was listening to
Furry looks like the god of war!
That’s how you look at a long lost girlfriend.
Dana White should be here 😂😂
Wilder so mad that he lost twice to a man with a body like that
Well…..Fury just won 😂
Well boxing isn’t about trash talking it’s about beating in which deontay goes wild
Retire the windmill, Fury
Bum squad in the house 😴
Not interested in this fight at all.
Guys, there fight was already happening. Slow down your video, you can even read the subs too. Wilder even used his bankai.
Holy shit son!
Wilder petrified for 6min
lmao @ the dude who kept yelling "two time"
Bunch of delusional people still in Wilders team
When wilder knocks out Tyson I’m gonna love to see all these haters eat their words... and new
Fury is gonna buldose through all Wilder's training :))
Boxing Promoter: Sorry fans we lied, no fight on July 24th the fight is now, whoever blinks first wins. Only 1 5min round. ....... and your new world heavyweight eye blink champion...... 👁 👁
i m again getting the stipe vs ngannou 2 vibe where people kept talking about Stipe was too skilled for Ngannou & Ngannou had only a punchers chance and look what happened!
I honestly think wilder wins this and it will be a knockout for sure!
I saw someone adding weights to Tysons contact lenses 😳
Uncomfortably long..
2 tiime! 2 time losses 😂
A big fan for wilder.but I doubt if he can beat Fury. Good luck
It's true love 😊
😴😴😴
Whata hell? Why is boxing stare down soo long, might as well just start making out... Man MMA is the best
As bad as I want to see this it jus looks like deontay is defeated Tyson seems the better confident fighter to the degree
Plot twist deontay is trying to get into Tyson's head
I can't wait for Fury vs Wilder XXIV.
Till this day !!!
Excuses squad
Respect Was Lost For Fury When Mentioned Wilder's Mom Joking. That's So Petty & Immature. FURY Will FALL
Children with autism sometimes need noise canceling headphones. this is no insult to people with autism. What we have here is a man staring at a man-child who needs to separate himself from the reality of all senses. Sure, you can remove your fancy sunglasses. Sure, you can gaze back into the man's eyes who will beat you. But unfortunately, you need to draw on the music as a distraction from the fear that is coursing in your veins. You want to show your opponent you are not afraid? You want to show your opponent respect? Then remove all the stimulus from yourself and meet him as an equal. You will be defeated Deontay. And it won't be because you didn't remove the silly headphones. You will lose because Tyson has nothing to gain or lose. He has already been humbled as harshly as a man can be humbled. And he stares at his destiny WITH NO FILTERS. Good luck gentlemen. GET IT ON!
Damn Wilder's calves are HUGE!!!
Hiding behind to glasses and earphones. Yeah, very brave.
Well this was boring, hopefully the fight will have more action than this shit
One heck of a long ass staredown
I bet wilder had to turn the volume up extra loud so he could hear his music since Fury busted his eardrum lol. He’s going to lose and say his new hairstyle is to blame because it made him less aerodynamic.
Wilder will win this one
Bomb squad 😂😂😂😂  Get a grip
Imagine the scenes if wilder wins the fight
Those headphones 🎧 and that hoody look a bit heavy. Take it easy Deontay, don't want you wearing yourself out
Yo... Wilder feels like different person. Good for him. This will be good!
As soon as I saw this I knew the champ wasn't gonna budge  Reminded me of the Klitschko sauna story Tyson built different
They fighting again???? When will this end? When trumpets sound? The four horsemen return? 😉
Wilder, keeping the headphones on so Fury, can't get in his head.
Well that will be intense
When art imitates real life.  WWF was more convincing than this staged opera. *shakes head in regretful disbelief
Two bums who can’t fight. UFC Heavyweights would kill them.
Actually suprised Wilder wasnt wheelchaired over to the stare down incase the weight of his clothing tired him out walking 7 meters.
Two grown men staring stupidly into each other’s eyes for 5 minutes, looks gay me to
Wilder is a broke spirit.  Looks like a beat dog. And the idiot in the back yelling "2 time" Sounds stupid ...two time excuse making split personality nothing to be proud of wilder ...the boxer that no one wants there kid to grow up and act like." The bronze bomber?"  Doesn't know how to act right so invents an alter ego to cover up the fact he was never socialized...a joke with bad energy and the universe will give him what he deserves ... A humbling at the hands of a god fearing respectable man. Fury will have wilder looking for God in his life after this fight . It will be a win for wilder in life that has no measure. He has allready lost the fight...it shows in his eyes and presence
Wilder by KO in the 4th Round. Fury is too comfortable, thats when he'll get knocked the fxck out.
Tyson standing there like c'mon to fuck
“Bomb squad! Bomb squad”  “Everyone relax, there is no bomb, it’s just deontay and his friends being silly”
2 time 🤦‍♂️ could you maybe say that 2 more times... these chodes gonna get shut up for good this time. TeamFury
Two time isn’t a flex to Tyson Fury honestly sack that man he’s embarrassing 🙈
Beware the man who has lost everything. 42-1-1, Deontay's 0 is gone. He will go all in because 42-1-2 won't bother him
Boxing is both skill and a punchers chance but DAMN Deontey looks bigger than before
Fury is a cheater now hes gonna sleep
Wonder if Wilder was listening to Swing low sweet chariot?
In his head so bad has to use headphones 🎧
It's convenient Fury has flab on his gut. If anyone wants a nap, he can just lie back and provide a pillow with his stomach. He's only a few pounds away from man boobs like an elderly Leonard Nimoy. Is he using some new performance enhancers that will get him into world class shape or is it just good ole fashioned hard work he expects to use?
Furyyyyyyyyyy
Ufc faceoffs are so much better
Fury's arm is like half a foot longer than Wilder's.
9 months later 🤰🏻
They waited so long for the rematch I guess they was trying to let age catch up with Tyson fury😁😁😁
😂
*tyson looks like hes about to take deyontes soul again*
Fury would never lose
I wonder if fury does destroy wilder again (i hope so) if he will come out with all his racist b.s. again and more excuses that fury cheated. What an embarrassment to boxing he is.
Is that 2 time record broken?  Wilder lost at his own game. Come on Fury 💪🏻 same again son
Can tell this fight is going to be really exciting.
Fuck Deontay man.. deprived us of Fury V Joshua just so he can get beat up and molested AGAIN
Why tf r the boxning again so son? Boxing really is a clown sport.
Wilder is going to hurt him this time around. I'm an Aj fan
Fury ain't 6"9
Well that was shit....20sec stair down please!
Finally some real boxers 😂
All questions will be answered in trilogy! 👍
Now this is a REAL face off
They are in love with each other 😅❤️
Wilder the big shit house. Did not speak. And walked away from the face off. The Gypsy King will reign victorious July 24th. You BIG Dosser Wilder
Does anyone actually want this crap aj v fury is what everybody really wants
Wilder is broken.. taking man's soul this time...big dosser
i think fury will beat wilder again but the lose to aj. hes fought the same opponent for 3 years in a row,
It’s like watching when DC fought Stipe in UFC this is going to be GOOOOD!!!
Tyson in his head , BIG TIME !
Bomb Squad------> Bum Squad.
No talking from wilder   Does this mean he for real 😂
Deontay Is Fucked... Again.
Fury gonna beat his ass for a 3rd time lol. Why does Wilder wanna put himself through that again..??
Bomb squad
Tyson looks like he just finished a big mac for lunch
Tyson has two balloons coming out his lower back shot wtf is that??
Wilder is a clown more suited to WWE! Not answering questions and having the headphones on tells you he's mentally not at the races and he will have to be to stand any chance against Fury
Bomb squad
Headphone  Sunglasses  body language  Homie Scareeeeeeeeeeeed 101
This is a spiritual fight between deontay Wilder and Tyson fury everyone else should honestly keep their mouth shut until the winner is announced. No Care's for your Irish hate speech. So STFU
Who that wasteman saying "two times" some battyman
His mother takes it.... 2 time 🙄
He gonna get his black ass whooped
what happened to Fury vs Joshua....
Wilder waste of timer
What’s the point
Cock bomb squad
Some say the gipsy king is still standing there.
Fury is me waiting in line at store behind someone playing the lotto .
Fury is still staring at the end, he’s probably day dreaming
Wilder ignores Tyson entire time with headphones, refuses to answer questions. But agrees to stare him down. Wilder is emotionaly charged, afraid this ends badly for Wilder.
Wilder blinked first 1-0 tyson
I would like to see Wilder lose, not because i dislike him, but because i want to see what would happen to his ego
Can't believe the leech cronies wilder has, mike tyson had plenty of them and they all deserted him as soon as the money dried up. He must need a confidence boost after the whooping he got in the last fight
How many photos can they possibly take?? Click click click click click click click click click click click click   Click click click click            click
how many times a day do you take a shit? TWO TIME
Lol come on I dont want to see this crap. Tyson fury going to win on the other hand deonte wilder going to blame the referee for his third time losing. Smh
Team #Gypsy Fury's boy was more than ready to throw down. I can't wait
Buummm Squadd, like the last fight wasnt embarrassing enough for him, looked like amateur vs pro. Another pristine performance from Tyson is on the cards.
I was on a plane to Newyork from Africa and by the time I gotta there the stare wasn’t still on
One of them secretly fancies the other
Tyson 2 wilder 0 lol
To the guy saying “two time” - Shut the fuck up
Deontay looks like he about to cry
Fury family a disgrace. Bunch of lame bullies Hope they'll lay soon
Omg he seems lost wilder
Wilder is crap
No fighter in the WORLD??so this nr 3..okeeyy...only them haha
This got  man law uncomfortable 😔
I hope Fury gets a face lift in this fight the cheating lying rat.
Fury is gonna win again.
After the interview where he told us about the steam room with Klitch, i knew he was not loosing this.
Are they in love or something??!!
Tysons brother saying yeaaa we won lol
Im staring at two people staring at each other.
Wilders muggy backup shouting 2 time. Does he not remember fury did him twice
I think wider was listening to R Kelly I belive I can fly swaying side to side like that.
Usual gypsy intimidation behaviour
I can't wait for the next ass whopping from fury
😂😂😂 these guys suck as boxers lol
They said 👀👀👀👀👀
wilder never fails to make me cringe
Wilder wins this fight you watch fury looks nervous don’t get me wrong I love fury and want him to win but I got a feeling d wins this
Deep down, no one wants this stupid fight.   We want Fury Vs Joshua, Give what the fans want
Usually ppl fight third time when both of them win once not when you get destroyed twice.
I really wabt a body like Tyson Fury's so I'm currently on a strict diet of kebabs and lager
Everyone is making fun of wilder but none of them would step on the ring with him.Team wilder assemble
Tyson wins the mental battle again
"Tool Time"
I tought Fury ist gonna be fighting Joshua?
Two time.
Fury, you do have skills. But can we please get a clean fight this time. DW deserve a fair fight, no hitting in the back of the head and no loaded gloves. May the best man win, because your line of work is only for real warriors, so I respect the both of you. Now that I got that out of the way, Deontay please whoop the living daylight out Tyson Fury! Cause them rabbit punches can really f**k a boxer's carrier up, that sh*t was real grimy Fury.
Was reading the comments at same time and eventually i tought it was on pause so i press.. Pause
If wilder wins they need to make nganu vs wilder in boxing
Hope Tyson smashes this bum into retirement this time
Fury should have carried on standing there until the morning jsut to be sure.
That was intense
Fury is not 6,9. 6,8 in heels! Still a big man
Why they interfere when they missed each other so much
Take off those massive headphones and shave off that beard. We don’t want your legs turning spaghetti from any extra weight
“4 eyed prick”   Dude with glasses behind tysons brother thinking ….. “ well thats offensive”
Mentality will be tested when you are facing someone who had defeat you
Don't forget the the floppy gloves , just sayin'....should be very interesting this time around.
TO THIS DAY!!!!!!! 😂
FURY IS CRAZY
Intense or awkwardly unnecessarily long?
it should have been tyson vs joshua... tyson is obviously much bigger than wilders... wilders hits will be less hitting
Fun fact : Deontay let his music finish..
wilder looks like he’s putting on weight, smart
Some say their still there staring at each other
This gonna be a good one. Wilder is determined asf, but fury is confident he has his number.
Both their mini mes' arguing for them at end killed me
Wilder must have went through at least 2 songs during this...
Lol this actually pretty funny 😂😂😂😆 🤣🤣😂😆
https://youtu.be/u-inJS8OQYI
they still staring TILL THIS DAY!
It's so silly, I wonder that someone doesn't bust out laughing.
Tyson  it's great  gent  other  guy  he scares  acting like  idiot  anyway  Tyson  will  fix  him  and him escort  too
Wilder will get a WHOOPING yet again, he isnt smart enough or fast e3nough to catch Fury.  Wilder is a disgrace and tillhe fought Fury everybody who got in the ring with him was a nobody or a WAAAAAAAAAAAAY past it fighter and it shows how much of a fraud he is
Yup wilder just lost my bet acting like nate diaz . so he is going to be a punching bag. Act crazy at a face off smoke a blunt. Just wow the crowed when u get lucky.
Wilder is such a joke.
Are they streaming  prom squid??
For anyone who doesn’t get why he’s wearing headphones: Fury, Paul, McGregor- they win the fight before they box by psyching out the opponent. Name calling, costumes, social humiliation. Very VERY smart decision to wear them. Now the winner will win on skill alone.
Who's that fat Ben Askren behind Tyson?
Wilder is def gonna win this trilogy..I can feel it..
Tons of fury fanboys in the chat. You people always riding bandwagons and following popular opinion. Bunch of lame sheep
My pullover was heavy,I was also wearing heavy headphones and sunglasses
Those headphones look kinda heavy on Wilders head...
Tyson going to send Bomb squad a shit parcel , and smash wilder again this time knock for Fury by the 7 round , that's were my money going for real the gypsy king ✌️👌
Y did I just watch 2 men stare at each other for 6 minutes
The time when Fury refused to leave first from the sauna. Just another episode of I won't forfeit. If u know u know.
Both of them look like Clowns
I went an made a sandwich, when i came back..still at it
The earphones spiked my drink.
Fury will disappoint wilder gain
Let’s be honest Maleek Scott took a dive in first round against Wilder, became Wilder no. 1 hype man then went on to open an only fan account with his girlfriend and now he’s Wilder’s trainer. Like seriously?
That was a long conversation... only Fury heard what Deontay had to say... same goes for Wilder.😠😆🔥
Fury looks smaller
In case anyone missed it any of the 9,000 times...2 TIME 🙄
Wonder what excuse wilder and his loyal band of Wilderettes will think of this time
Wilder comforting himself with his little side to side sway  Meanwhile Fury doesn't give a single F
Janitor: “Can one of you get the lights when you’re done?, Thank you.
Lol yoo that's a long time to stare at someone
Fury knew that stare off meant a lot to wilder
Wilder decent considering he had no amateur career
Why did I just watch two blokes stare at each other for 6 minutes?
I think this fight will be more difficult for Fury than it would be against Joshua
I love Wilder's energy right now. No silly shiet! just business pahtnah.      Until fight night.................Lol, but I like Wildr's chances.
Wilder looks slimmer he won’t cope
"Two Times"  what? Annoying!
Where’s the actual press conference with the stare down
🤣🤣🤣 Fury the Best!!
I didn’t realize it was this long lol wtf
The fight no one wants to see
2 time
Wilder doesn't know shit about Boxing till he accepts George Foreman's offer.....
Is Bum Squad wearing lifts?   Bum Squad’s headphones: “you are a winner. Release the negative energy. You are a winner. Believe in yourself. The grass is green. The sky is blue.”
Who wears headphones to a press conference promoting a fight. What a tard
Fury is done this fight✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿
Wilder will destroy fury mark my words Round 5 2:21
Shake And Bake!
Word  is that Tyson Fury still standing till fight night
Tyson's boxing skills are superior to Wilder, it's going to be the same outcome
Make this a memorable one wilder lessgo
Fury body like will farell
If you can not say anything why did you come out anyway Stay indoors.....Fans are paying heavily for this fight and you don't want to say anything??? This is totally unacceptable
They look Furious and Wilder than ever
Looks like Fury is going to win.....again...
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO FURY/JOSHUA? WTH IS THIS??? WILDER GOT OBLITERATED, this is not what the fans wanted to see 🤦‍♂️
Wish they would just let both of these dudes kick Joshua's ass
Come on Wilder, knock his fat ass out and keep having his gloves checked too.
I don't get the whole headphone thing. Or the sweater around the waist. Not a fashion show. Gypsie king is goofy but at least he can box.
thu tha
They should put a muzzle on Shane Fury
We have all seen the hot tub story, this is just another example of how far tyson is willing to go to win.
Who wears headphones to a press conference?
Bakalan seru nih
Damn Shane has let himself go
Deontay is fearful of Tyson. He hid behind those dark glasses and earphones for fear of the truth he would see and hear. Only after he got comfy enough did he remove the shades 👀. Never removed those earphones for fear of Tyson’s words. Tyson has already won this. Betas can never hide their nature when the Alpha walks in the room.
Deontay will win this one and I’ll get 1000 likes for accurate prediction. Also I’ll bet £1000😀
I'm not sure if I want to look in nobody eyes that long....not unless it's a woman...
Wilder looks locked in but idk if he gonna win
Now kiss
I thought Fury was taller than Wilder
I can't believe I just watched a 6 minute video about two men looking st each other's eyes.
Tyson Fury look rattled
Tyson fury 8s fat...If doesn't cheat this time he's DONE
Fury Won the Face Off Wilder went away first!
I think that Wilders friend, two time, has something in common with Hodor from Game of Thrones!
This was the most Boring Staredown of the Decade
BUM SQUAD!!
Fury's brother dressed like Zack Galifianakis from Hangover 3
2 time champ 👑 vs 2 time chump 💀
How did they not start cracking up ?
whoever that bum is who won't stop saying "two time" needs the biggest slap of them all
Look with total respect 2 wilder why even bother a 3rd? Even if by some chance manage 2 pull off victory u still got bested TWICE. Fury Joshua wat real boxing fans wanna c
and they've kept staring *to this day*
Let's hope Wilder's team examines Fury's gloves before the fight, as long as this staredown.
The words 2 time have just lost all meaning
Why did I watch this whole thing
Why  he have lost? Should they stare at each other the whole day. Haha stupid. He look a little bit , enough ^^
Why is this a 6 minute face off? God boxing is gay
Fury retires after this fight.
Huh wait.. what am I missing? I thought the next fight was Joshua v Fury!?
Wilder looks zoned in
Fury is such a clown 🤡 I’m truly surprised he ain’t been knocked out more even tho wilder did knock his ass out lol and Tyson brother should just stop he look like the Goodyear tire man
So why would people want to see them fight a 3rd time lol
Wilder is emotionally and mentally very weak as he wasn't even brave enough to look and turn away and fury just was messing around with his head and clowning around with him😆
Check tyson fury's glove, he cheats
Fury fans I hope ur boy ain’t coked up or caked up he looking pretty fat still just saying and for the record both of these dudes would get beat by Mike Tyson tomorrow no training camp needed lol
I hope Tyson will not end like Chauvin
Guess Wilder is 6'9 now too
Wilder im rooting for you big dawg🔥💯
We can make jokes and whatever but I’m warning you guys these guys are heavy weights and both of them are dangerous fighters. Fury looks fat but he’s actually one of the best technical fighters I have ever seen. Wilder may have lost but best believe he’s nothing to play with and he never turned down fights. Al the Ko’s on Wilders name we’re serious ones he never got nothing for free it’s all hard work en dedication so put respect on his name
I am sure he had the sound of and heard everything what a total fraud 😉
Two completely fraudulent anchors without a scintilla of self-respect
Fury!
Energy doesn’t lie, wilder finna kill this dude
In mma a staredown that long we'd would have the fight. Real professionalism
The first of many battles leading up to the war. Tyson just looks too relaxed and honed in on all aspects of his craft. Wilder proving his still hasn't changed and evolved in a complete boxer. He is just like his trash talk. A one trick pony but it is one nasty trick pony.
Legend has it, Tyson is still there standing in that room today.
How did they not slap the 2 time guy is beyond me
FURY IS FIRE
Bum squad!!!!!!!
Fury praying loud as he can in his head lmaoooo he scared as fuck
I hope wilder destroys luke the gypsy fraud
😁https://youtu.be/-JjZl2pXKb0
Legend has it tyson is stood there for the rest of time
👎🏻 to deontay wellder! Whatever his name! Excuses and a sore loser child
Only furious thing i see about tyson is his muffin top😆
Big dosser got his beats on so cant hear the gypsy's curse this time hahaha. no excuses this time bum squad!
Fury throat gulp 3:48
Whats gonna be this time wilder? Gloves? Costume? Shoes? Lmao
Whoever said “to this day!” Is very courageous
Wilder on Highheels
Deontay can't hear out of one of his ears why does he have both covered?
His not making fury get into his head this time 😂😂
Imagine if Tyson fury worked out like he works his hands , he'd be unstoppable .
Fair play to him trying to bring back beats 😂
Hopefully this fight will finally put it to rest.
It was a great watch. My only problem is I wish they could make it longer
I typed this comment after the clip ended. Ain't no way I'm looking away😡
Really, both of these clowns. Boxing has gone waaaayyyyyy downhill if this is the calibre of champions these days.
Fury has 3 fights to be considered with the best heavyweights of all time. Wilder, Joshua and Usyk.  Git up there, Gypsy King!
Two time !! Yea lost two times 😂
😂 bum squad
Tyson looks so fat I don't understand why wilder has such a tough time beating a slob
Furyyyyyu
"dosser"
3-0 to fury  😆🤣😂
Bruh if wilder loses this fight which I don't really see him winning unless he hits a punch sent from God. Honestly he should no longer box. Boxing needs people to help sell the fights their not really in position to put high value fights on for the fighters  to sit there with a phone / tablet like there 5 years old be a professional buddy. Like this was the most unprofessional thing I've seen. This guy acted as if he's above everyone in the room and won't answer questions he probrobly playing yugioh on his phone or soemshit. Sad.... real sad... meanwhile Tyson fury is doing his best  making good of a bad situation
No one:  Deontay Wilder: i'm starring TO THIS DAY
Tyson’s chubby brother is so courageous when sitting behind Tyson 🤣🤣🤣
Wilder gets knocked out in 3 this time,
Wilder 🦅
Tyson will destroy the bumb.
Respect to fury for taking the time out to finish Wilder’s career
When the stare down lasts longer than the fight.
Beyoncé Wilder
damn... where they doing one of those DBZ mental battles?
Wilder tries way to hard to be intimidating. Lmao! Fury all day. He will eat wilder alive this time. I’ll stick my house on it!!

ASMR Staregazing Contest
Tyson fury looks sooo out of shape ... hopefully Deontae knows how to handle hit business this time 🙄🤦🏾‍♂️
Rumor has it they are still looking at each other “til this day!!!! Til this day, nigga!”
Deontay is so desperate not to let Tyson get in his head, he’s wearing headphones
Fury actually gonna lose this one though unfortunately because Wilder has been training hard and Fury is unprepared.
Wtf , he is actually allowed to fight the gypsy king after the absolute batteri g he took, omg you can tell money runs things.
I swear they are about to bang
The show ll be on my birthday
You’ve got to just love Tyson fury OLD SHOOL
Tysons Looking mean👊😡🖕
Yup, two time fury will hand Wilders rear🤣😂
“2 time” shut up
LEGEND HAS IT,  THEIR STILLL FACING OFF.
Please Wilder beat Fury so he doesnt havr to fight AJ
fight gonna be one sidded like the conference 💯 tyson by ko
Tony two time
Why are we having this fight again the third time? It's getting too boring now. Anthony joshua vs Tyson fury is what the fans are asking for.
Fury shaped like a deflated basketbalm
Fury looks like a fat fool.
When the server crashes and the first one to DC loses the match
Pointless rematch
At least A.J is sponsored by BEATS.. Wilder had to go out and buy his 😂
Bum squad😂😂
Shows what type of guy wilder is accuses Fury of everything under the sun but face-to-face got nothing to say
fury ez win ngl
Epic
Wilder built like a damn rocket ship man.
Wilder is listening to pre recorded sound bites of himself making excuses of why he lost the fight. He's already prepairing for his post fight interview and having a hard time memorizing his own bs lines. So far Wilder got an ingrown TOE nail, on his right FIST. He got Pink eye in both eyes the day this press conference took place, hence, the sunglasses. And he got food poisoning from eating a family meal from Popeyes 2 days before the fight.
Two times two times what an stupid tit say that pissed me off so bad
Wilder va perdre
The gypsy cheater is in deep shit now 😡✊🤜🤜
Seriously, why is Wilder not moving on to Joshua, why cant they make it happen?
Le combat à déjà commencé, celui qui lâche le premier perdra le combat 👌
Wilder needed to sit down, legs were tiring
Windmill's got his wedges in.
Fury looked like an idiot. Weak.
Holy moly
They were having one of the most intense stare downs and then their teams had to ruin it by arguing
Wilder really wants to kill him you know!!  Its gonna be a dangerous fight
"Damp squib squad"
It's like wilders looking at a police line up to identify the guy that beat him up badly...
man wilder looks broken did somebody die?
I've said it for years. If Wilder could actually box and really learn the art of boxing he'd be devastating with the power he naturally has. He has a new team, new coach and new regime etc so maybe he's decided to learn boxing. Not just throw power.
This is going to be more like the second fight than the first. Tyson owns him in the ring. It’s bullshit that this fight is happening before Fury-AJ. Tyson is 2-0 against Wilder. (He was robbed in the first fight.)
It’ll take fury less than the time this face off was fo knock out wilder
i thought fury might have broken the stare down momentarily by asking the chic for a cuppa tea
Wonder if it was this intense in the sauna with the big Klit!
Wilder listening to baby shark over and over in those head phones.
Booooooo this is bullshit we want AJ vs FURY he’s already beat the bronzebummer twice. (What did that little man in the crowd say at 6.19?)
Was Mr 2-Time referring to the number of times Fury has beaten him?
6:00 "He got out of the sauna first and I thought mental victory"
You can just see the guilt on Tyson Face knowing he cheated.
Wilder looked tired. Has he been wearing that suit around again?
Wilders got his tin foil headphones so fury can’t get in his head
Think Wilder might do this ya know, and I’m Fury all the way. Just this feeling Wilder will dust Fury, Usyk will spark Joshua then the whole division is head over tit…..
Bumm squard
Bum squad
tyson is going to man handle this silly muppet again can not wait for deontay to be humbled again!
Wilder will win this fight I reckon
Ni55a sound like a broken record..
Tyson Fury got in shape. That tells alot🤔
Bumsquad
Wilders camp threw in the towel...again 😂
Eyw of revenge
Someone take the headphones off him. He'll get a neck injury
bum squad i cant believe wilder is even standing there again looooool see u on your back on fight night champ i mean Chump!
Wilder has zero chance of winning and he knows it. This will be an easy paycheck for fury.
Tyson looks like a titan from attack on titans
How can you not like Tyson Fury - charismatic, easy going, dude
Worried for wilders mental state after this beating
That’s the Wilder I’ve been waiting to see…..focused,disciplined,determined,confident, and hungry to regain the heavyweight championship crown 🤴! Wilder by KO in 4…..💪🏼💣
loooool hes only gonna get beat up bad again 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My man fury fucking geeza dont back down from no man specialy from the BUM SQUAD
Public has been conned. only fight we want to see is AJ vs Fury
Smh 🤦🏾‍♂️ he let our race down,could’ve at least lost with some honor and admit that fury outclassed him but no he just had to do weird shit on the gram. Fury should retire this bum.
Tyson fury’s going beat the demons outta of him again 🤣😂😂😏
Stop hiding behind the shades, Wilder.
Wilder is shitting his pants
Tbh i had no idea that this fight was happening but this is gonna be interesting to see how this plays out.
get a motel room
I have finished reading all the comments below, "faceoff is still going on"😂
This guy has been schooled twice by Fury he's ego is writing checks his body can't cash, if you need headphones to face a man down you are weak and already beaten
Fury still standing there TO THIS DAY  Seriously though doesnt it get tiring to stare in somebodys eyes straight for so long?
I wonder if Tyson Fury believes in Bible cosmology
Can't wait to see this comment section when Fury loses 😭🤣🤣🤣😭🤣🤣. The WORLD will be watching his gloves!
fury has the weirdest build ever
I don't know why they're fighting again tbh
Drink and shot every time he says 2 time
Wilder looking scary and hungry he will bounc furys had off fury is too confident know in the win
What asshole keeps yelling “2 times” Deontay lost the last fight. 2 times loser maybe?
Are they fight again?
Looking like he gonna get beat a third time
Wilder: so stupid having headphones while talking to others disrespect and sun glasses without a sun how smart is that 😏 Tyson fury: alcoholic but a bit with a sport
Staring into someone's eyes that long is either deep love or deep hatred, sometimes both. Also who the hell let Zach Galifinakis up on stage.
Заряжены хорошо оба!👍😉
Bong squad
that "two time is annoying af"
Why Deonty is looking taller ?
fury about to knock the shit links off his head
Holy titties where in fuck did this come from
Tyson is getting knocked out
Bomb squad!!!
Wilder will get his ass wooped again
Staring too long man
Bro Deontay wants to kill him
Can't hear you, can't see you, so you don't exist. - Could've been Deontay.
This is gonna be a great fight!!!🥊🥊🥊🥊
Fury looks scared
He Probly got paid about 5 grand for saying “thoo thime” 796 times
Got a real feelin that Wilder is goin ko him thos time, i just feel it
Wilder took charge though. He started it and ended it on his terms. Left Tyson standing not knowing what to do.
This is amazing, boxing is having a hell of a post covid comeback
Tyson Fury got his number. Next time 3 rounds
Still wish it was aj vs fury instead of this
They were both thinking about running away with each other.
Why is Wilder always trying to play mind games with Fury? You gonna lose everytime that guy has been and is going through depression every single day of his life you can never beat that shit. You think some staredown is going to rock him? He probably gets up today and tries to find a reason to live and you gonna try to get inside that mental toughness? Gtfo
Wilder hasn't learnt anything, still surrounded by yes men shouting Buuuuum squad! Two time what? Loser Liar and a man which cannot acknowledge he took a fair beating. There's only one Tyson Fury! 🤫
The guy who said 'To this day' was the highlight of this video 3:11 JHAHAHAHA
Love a close up of there faces.
Lol Wilder wearing stilts
Alan from the hangover was getting pretty upset
This face off was longer than one of my previous relationships.... AND STILLL
Fury's gloves should be velcro'd on. He might use the laces from the gloves in the next L to harm himself
First one to look away is gay *tyson whispers*
Legend has it..... Im still staring at the thumbnail
I think i heard the words ..... TWO TIME!!! .... But im not sure was very hard to hear  HAD to watch it ten times... and i think,, I THINK i heard the word's Two Time!!   BUT PLS dont quote me on that, i put head hones on TURNED them MO Fuckers up...but with all the smack talk i could not make out any thing...  BUT i MAYBE heard ONCE the word ( TWO TIME ? ) again don't quote me and my earing is excellent it Yea was hard! im not going to say this " TWO TIMES" because you can all read
Why tf is Wilder even getting a third chance, this is embarrassing !
Zzzzzzzz
Does Tyson fury look skinnier  this time or is it just me
Who's the dick shouting bomb squad? Is it even still a thing 😂
Wilder gonna beat his ass , Tyson gloves were loaded in wilder vs  fury II  it was clear as day the Bama boy back with a vengeance
Its funny how people acting like fury didn't cheat that match like it gonna be the same out come fury  could have killed him with whatever he had in his glove wilder is about to kill you and know one can save you
Why is TF calm today? Where's the hype??😂He is right aware whom he is facing now. A different dangerous beast!! No show off because he vividly knows that this time round, he is going down by a terrible KO. Bronze bomber is not playing. He wants blood!
You know what, no matter what you say about Deontay Wilder, its really nice that he brought his "simple" friend to the face offs.
Love it! This will be one of the best trilogies of boxing history! Be glad and happy to witness this!
Nice acting. Now fury smashes him again
"Now kith"
Why headphones on a steardown thats so disrespecting
Tyson ,,the magic gloves" Fury 🤣🤣
Big Shane back in action! Would love to see him and wilders brother in a cage match on the undercard 😂
Fury should have farted to cut at that build up tension from wilder
And the Gypsy King won yet another battle with Wilder
2 time...!!! 2 loses.. 😂
why they do this again? Fury dominated both fihts
I was wondering why they would make it so ridiculously long, without anyone batting an eye. Then I noticed they stood there for 6,66 minutes. figures...
WTF is Two Time..? Is he stupid or something.
Wilder is going to end up with more brain damage fighting Fury again.
Fury look worried you can't cheat your way out this one karma
Wilder is gonna get whacked up again
How many time?
Tyson be like: Not this fool again!
Wilder very handsome
waste of people time
He looks very rigid Deontay. I wish him well but has rigor mortis already set in here? 🤣
Wilder coming to the ring in speedos this time
BUM SQUAAAAAAD
I love how they literally can look OVER the security 🤣
TOOTA... TOOTA
I am missing something here, 2x what? 2 times wilders is going to get outclassed in the ring? 2 times more excuses?
You're delusional if you think Wilder lost that 1st fight.
Wilder took of the sun glasses when he felt safe his team shouting Bom squad wilder ain’t the same no more bro
The rampant ceramic unprecedentedly tick because authorisation neurobiologically roll aboard a needless fight. aromatic, bright rainstorm
And that's.... brain damage at its finest
Zelenoff beats Wilder already
Young love 🥰
*BATTLE OF THE DAD BOD AND CHICKEN LEGS*
2:42 - Wilder and Fury kiss
Deontay waitin for his favorite part of the Song playing
When I heard two time I thought it was Tyron Woodly calling for Jake Paul
I’m curious what would happen if they didn’t look away? Would they just stand there for hours?
Who were the idiots yelling bomb squad and two times? Making themselves sound like a bunch of half-wits
that is one love story right there
Wilder is going 2 be Mister-T Jr. on Fury. No Quick KO - STRAIGHT BLOW TORCH FURY!
You would think Wilder would have bulked up after that loss. He looks skinnier 🤦
What's up with the substitute teacher filling in for a real boxing promoter?
A Staring Contest of epic proportions.
Whos really arsed about this fight seriously 😂
wilder shit himself
wilder smart wearing those headphones to have a built in excuse for the fight.  neck fatigue is a real thing
We really doing this again?
Till this day!
This is just 6 minutes of two guys staring at eachother
I wonder if wilder or his bum squad have watched that we come fight he was batterd … a dent in his skull
I hope Tyson leave wilder fighting for his life in the ring.
How many times?
Ya shit houses 🤣🤣 the yanks can't banter the brits, especially the travelling community
“Two times” yeah two times your guy lost
Two time twat needs to come up with something better
When did fat Lil Dicky become Tyson's corner guy?
Bum squad this guy wilder getting fucked up again in three  rounds
Even Wilder's team mate announcing "Two times" to show the world how many times Fury already beat his boi.
I hope these lot get the biggest karma ever disrespect calling people foreeyed prick ect hope wilder destroys him, fury is way too arrogant
I like how Tyson still didn’t move when wilder left, Fury wins all the mind games.
Wilder will be taking this fight serious, he gonna bring the fight to Fury, this is gonna be fireworks
... I would start laughing
Look like lovers who have quarrels at a stalemate
After all this I kinda hope wilder comes through and gets his redemption
This is everything that's wrong with boxing. A forced fight thats okay over one we'd all all love to see.
2 time what - 2 times he lost badly to Tyson Fury?
Nawaoo😅
This isn’t MMA
Deontay toothpick legs wilder
Wilder will own him this time around. Bet on it
Wilder wearing headphones and shades so he can’t hear no evil or see no evil hahahahaha this his new training just ignore him and he can’t get in your head when you have shades and headphones fucking absolute donkey and he might have wore trainers instead of sock shoes hahahahahahah
Remember when deontay cried about rigged gloves? Then after that was proven false he claimed it was because of his head gear? Yeah i cant wait to see him get slept
Let’s go bum squad u no the big dosser is going to punch his head in again 😂😂😂😂😂  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Deontay will not hear a word but will kill ur champ
Fury looking gay with that hat lol
I see a big budget Hollywood film on the way just for the stare down itself 😉
Wilder got actually battered 2X
Tyson Can’t Stand Firm..Shaking. Guilty.
Furys brother is on smoke 😆
Kinda sus ngl
Wilder is gonna get him this time!!!!!
BoooUUUMM SQUAD LOL
Man Wilder has been looking a lot sharper lately, will be an interesting fight
Tyson ShiTTed His Pants..He Gon End Up In 🚨
I'm English, but I cannot stand fury, I think he's a disgrace..... I hope wilder destroys him💪👊
Let’s all pray for wilder!! Regardless this is more than a fight  for him. Unfortunately he’ll learn the hard way
Why would Tyson flinch he beat the shit out of the bullshitter left right and centre
Honestly There is no need to hate any one of them. They don't have any parallels in the  game. That's why this fight is relevant. Let's be honest here I also like AJ but we all know he was ducking wilder for ages. Fury had the balls to step in the ring and take a dub makes him a king. Both of these men are absolute in boxing today. This should go down as the best rivalry of or generation.
Kids
The headphones were a huge copout ....
It's literally like when cats are abt to fight....except this 2 are monsters
Honestly who TF let them stand there for that long??
Wilder is shook 😂 blocking out Tyson’s voice isn’t going to fix those twig legs
Dope asf but I would stand there too in Tysons mind he won that mental game
Fight won't go past the 3rd, wilder is gay.
How tall r these guys??? Massive
Why is it so easy to make this fight x3 but non of 'em signed the most important fight against AJ?
Wilder and Vetori got to be the most delusional being on this planet. You got beaten twice and you still have the ordercity to show your face. Are you mad or you got no shame at all
Who's the idiot saying two time
Plot twist: Deontay didn't hear when it was time to turn around because of the headphones 😆
Am I the only one who keep double tapping till the end cause of how long this stare down is?
FURY GLOVES LOOK HELLA SUSPICIOUS, NEVER SEEN GLOVES BEND THE WAY OT DI D FURY CHEATED
I have a feeling that fury will lose
Wilder much punch Fury in his Stomach till the time Fury loses his Beer Belly
And Deontay wonders why no one gives a single lone fuck about his career. I've taken more exciting shits than this man.
Man, these neurolink commercials keep getting better and better!
I can't wait for the fight.
I hope Tyson Fury knocks that ego maniac OUT
Two Time is the new My opponent small
😂😂
Wilder is what happens when you surround yourself with yesmen.  If he hasnt changed this he will get his ass kicked again.  I think Fury actually has compassion for him but  knows that Wilder isnt cut from the same cloth.
Wilder prepping for his new role as a "stone cold killer"
https://youtu.be/o08YzAzeft0
Tyson got there and thought i really like this spot im gonna stand here for abit
like two roosters 🐓 🐓
This won't be competitive, wilder a clown & malik scott is a bigger clown looooool
Who's yelling 2 times ??
Wilder is a dosser....
Bomb squad won’t do shit after this beat down its guna he bum squad
Tyson gonna fuck this boy up badly !
FURY IS ON COKE BRO FOR SURE
Bum squad
Wilder is going to fuck him up FOR REAL
Why oh why does Fury insist on no shirt?? 🤮🤢😵
Tyson all day 💯
no one:   Some random guy:  TWO TIME, TWO TIME, TWO TIME, TWO TIME, TWO TIME 🤣
This should be in Guinness world record....The longest staredown in history...
They love each other really
If Wilder loses this fight after that long stare down, I have no words
A wounded man don't need to talk. Yall said he lost his mojo? No one with a lost mojo can stand there and look deep into the eyes of the opponent. This fight will make a lot of Wilder's haters look fuckin ridiculous.
Wilder is going to smash fury. Demolition job.
4 eyed prick. These lads bring it
At 6:02 Wilder knows that he gonna loose again. What a fkn kiddo. hahahaahahaaaa
Legend has it they’re still lost in each other’s eyes 👀
Yeah just keep repeating "two time" lmao
Waw deontay 'skip leg day' Wilder is actually scared...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
TWO TIME
boxing's getting real boring
Basically a staring competition.......dogshit
Wilder broke first
This is like furys sauna victory against Vlad.
Legend says that they're still standing right there, TO THIS DAY!
Wilder must have been listening to the Fugees....
Don’t drag it out anymore 😂 let’s get this fight over with. As nice as it’ll be to see Tyson swipe wilder aside AGAIN! We all want the AJ fight come on boys pleeeeeeeeeease
Wilder wants his WBC belt back... But Fury looks terrifying looking so big
Wider is a pathetic joke
LET'S GO WILDER HUMBLE HIM
They was really doing the mannequin challenge 😂
Wilder looks washed out and Fury needs to do glute workouts
Dude is stuck on repeat or what 😂😂 two time is a charm or what😂 Will be a third lossssssssss for willy wonky leggs wilder
This is why we need a Dana White
I remember when Dillian Whyte said that Joshua vs Fury will never happens before trilogies between Fury vs Wilder. Can someone explain  what's going on?
How many times have they faught? Random Guy: Two Time!!  How many times has Fury won? Random Guy: Two Time!!!
F in chat for wilder
Bomb squad!!!!! Lets go
Wilder looks like Furys skeleton.
You do All realise no one gives an absolute shit about this fight... The world wanted Fury v Joshua... This is 3 nil to Fury just embarrassing by wilder get to the back of the queue where..

“Yey we won” 🤙🤙
Tyson won.
Wilder stop wasting our time please!
"you will win, he's a dosser, you are the king, 40lbs is nothing" deontay wilders headphones
World record longest pro stare down?
Trying to act tough
Twice on a Sunday...boom
Wilder afraid..you can see it in his eyes.
Tyson will again in this bout for sure
There still there to this dayyyyy
What an oaf with his headphones en glasses on😂 looks like a cartoon character, he will get destroyed again 🥳🥳🥳
Tyson Fury standing there with flabby midsection and receding chin! smh put your shirt on bro, nobody wants to see that shit.
Wow 👏 could not stand there for longer than 2 seconds .. and who the hell keeps saying yes sir .. sounds like a jake laul fan
Wilder is scared 🤣😂🤣
Wilder:That headphones is pure metal and heavy thats why i lost. Wilder balls: i  went in there....
You can’t beat “crazy”  !
Fury broke his spirit already. Wilder wearing headphones to protect his ears from getting a whack again 😂
Bob ARUM smiling.....money money money again!!!!..😂🤣😂🤣😂
That’s gotta be a record 🧐
Sunglasses in a staredown is just whack!
I thought Fury vs Joshua would be first.
Your going to fucking him up again lad, Tyson is the one ☝️
Fury is scared
Fury couldn't even stand still, felt Wilder's anger/energy and got scared for a second there lol
Wilder doesn’t engage in exchange or words with fury which is exactly what he wanted. Kept it at his own pace. Wilder did well here atleast
USA! I want wielder!
If you meet Tyson fury in a bar u can mistake him to just another dude who's always with a glass of beer every day of the year 🤣🤣🤣don't just a book by it's cover
Stop QQ'ing like a bunch a little shits.. Just let the best man win the 3th fight & get on with it.. the only fight that REALLY matters is **** vs AJ for all the belts
Wilder a joke fury will destroy him again wilder can’t box on fury’s level hope he not listening to heavy metal that will destroy his legs again 😂
Dude these are are giants
To anyone out there, i got a rack on wilder. Leave me a comment if you want that bet...we can lock it in with vegas ill pay the fee.
Wilder seems to have some sort of edge. Not over Fury of course but maybe we'll see a different Wilder this time
wilder thinks he's in a movie or some shit lmfaooo its cringe af
50% fans doesn't care about this fight.  We all want AJ Vs Fury.
This gonna be EPIC! DEONTAY GONNA GET THAT ASS!!!! FURY LOOKS LIKE SHIT. HE HAS A MONTH TO GET IN FIGHT SHAPE. CNT BE DONE. FURY ALREADY LOST.
Annoying 2 time
some good old staring contest
Wilder looks skinnier. N in my opinion, a little bit of fear.
this is gonna be a fight to the death
What's wrong with boxing today, especially the heavyweights....these two !!
When is the fight!?!?
The guy continually shouting '2 time' sounds like he's got a head injury
🇬🇧 1 : 🇺🇲 0
BUMMMMM SQUADDDDD THAT ANGER AINT GON GET YOU NOWHERE CAUSE YOU AINT GOT THE GIFT   THERES ONLY ONE TYSON FURY! KRONK BABY DETROIT BABY!
Come on Fury love your enemy
I'm black man and always asked myself why I don't like Deontay Wilder.
That face-off was like having a free paper view fight that is way better than any youtuber fight will ever have in history.
Forget fury wilder I want to see curly vs "two time"
Tyson is just can’t give up, even at sauna and during stare downs!
If he was a good promoter he would of said his blood taste good
Lol😂😂😂😂
Does Tyson Fury need liposuction or just get out of liposuction?
Masculinity slaps
That beeatch saying "i am out of here" then says "what is happening" well go love this is mens business
I become father of 2  watching them face off. Enough man. Let it go.
Lol Wilder picks the perfect song and probably didn't expect the faceoff to last longer than the song itself 😅
#BumSquad 😂😂😂
Reminds me of Fury's Sauna story with Klitschko
Fury carrying alot of weight. What fight this one.
Can't wait , this gonna be epic. I feel...
I couldn’t give two fucks about this fight
No one wants this fight
This is just weird. It's like a painter who got out of his van and walks up to a random guy heading into Best Buy and the sound of cicadas flying around.
Bumsquad
Gypsy King!
If u speed it up, its like watching sims
U can tell wilder fearful of him
Wilder: X GONE GIVE IT TO YA HE GONE GIVE IT TO YA
Tyyysonnnnnn
True love
Did you guys notice when fury’s brother called one of wilders team a “4 eyed prick!”  at the end the smaller guy behind him just repeated the same thing like he didn’t have a insult ready and panicked 😂😂😂😂
I want fury vs AJ
Hope wilder wins tbh
Oooh romantic lol
When there's no Dana White in between
As great as Deontay is hes just not going to win
They are trying to fall in love with each other..
Two times we'll see Wilder whooped.🤣
Bum squad! Lol
Is going to be a good fight .
tOo tIH
Aint the african looking one got skinny legs.
Gypsy king already has him beat
Tyson can’t stand his feet
Deontay got a motivation tape in them headphone you know hes already  rehearsing those excuses .
My money on Wilder all day 🤝   Talk 🔜🤫💰
Longest face off ever
I really hope fury walks to the ring wearing hat wilder did last time and beats the fuck out of him
Dude built like a bag of puddin smh
Tyson looks out of shape!
go tyson
🤣🤮🧐
Wilder listening to careless whisper in his headphones as he gazes lovingly into Fury's eyes for 6 minutes
Fury is already 3-0 from this
Make no mistake guys-Fury is going down this time
Whoever done the promoting for this fight is rubbish I didn't know this was happening til now
I have a feeling this wilder is gonna be hungry and therefore more dangerous. He was humiliated that last fight. I can see him knocking fury out this time and there will be a 4th and final decider.  Then fury will retire after that 4th and duck Aj.
2 time... YEAH YOU LOST 2 TIMES YOU BUM.. GET UP AT EM TYSON LAD
BET U BLINK FIRST !!!! 🤣
What song y’all think he was listening to?
Should have listen to ya father.
Headphones, not answering questions sign furys already in hes head and he is trying keep him from saying more to affect his mind.
Someone get fat boy outta there
Welder is still scared 😱
What a fukin helmet wilder is man , joker
is it just me or is this just weird?
If you wearing sunglasses during the staredown, you're scared.
Wilder Fury III  - sounds like porn..
Bumsquad
This is wilder 3 losses from fury
Deontay has nothing to be ashamed of losing a fights to a guy who outweighs you by 60 lbs and is taller and longer reach and younger is no reason to quit fighting. He can win and if not still fight on
“Till this day!”
Apparently deontay still walking round saying two time
two time?? yeah two time world champion
wilder lost because his headphones ran out of battery
Wish my girl looked at me that much. Pfft they love eachother.
I am worried for fury
Why is fury dressed like that???
On July 24 this fight will start in the 2nd round
Furys going to flick that black bean all over that ring again 🤣👌
Where is Dana white when you need him
HOW MANY TIMES HE SAID 2 TIMES..
100 percent should wear furs ring suit then go smash him
I'm suprised BLM didn't riot over the beating Mr bomb squad got last time and will recieve again
no one can out chat a gypsy
Tyson's yes men are so annoying. specially his brother
Why would you want to be beat like a bitch 3 times in a row 😂
with this fight somebody are going to retired
I thought AJ and fury were fighting🤔
TWO TIME!! TWO TIME!!
#BUMMMMMMSQAUD YES MEN 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who was at this press conference!? It was so quiet you could hear...
Well…that was…
Can someone edit this video and add KPop love song with sparks and love emoticons flying everywhere!
Deontay "The Bronze Gaze" Wilder
After this, we dont wanna hear Wilder & Fury ever again
But inside, I know they are attracted to each other. They are like lovers hiding from parents!
theres only one billy joe saunders 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
4:45 Who tf is Tu-Tam?
How long do you need to make eye contact
well this was one of the most cringeworthy situations in a while
Bloody hell
Well, it looks as though the stare down went to Fury 🤷‍♂️
Deontay wilder tryingt o copy Anthony Joshua style
They're staring at each other... TILL THIS DAY!! TILL THIS DAY!!
Thats a different deontay  wilder , Tyson furry best watch out
Why doesn't someone tell that guy to STFU 2x, what an annoying character
Legend has it when they close there eyes they see each other
Imagine someone beat the words out of you so bad. Lol wilder going down again.
I did the stare down with them. Genius.
he is still standing there till this day
"Bum squad" 😅
TYSON ''2 BUMS'' FURY
how many pics do u possibly need
Wilder is already a beat dosser and a  embarrassment to boxing.
Wearing his headphones to avoid anything tyson has to say
Host: can you face forward...  Boxers :well can someone come and turn us forward please..because even if am s💩ting in my pants I can let it show.?
Wearing headphones during a face-off is like wearing sunglasses while playing poker
Yes shane you tell em
I´m 100% hetero, but these things make me doubt sometimes. Nobody can´t make create that much tension at a face-off.  I´m going to the hub asap.
The hype around this fight is literally Zero. Wilder is a beaten man, beaten and broken. Keeps his headphones on to avoid having to answer for all the insane excuses
whys he got headphones on for...
two timeeeeee😝😝😝😝
Bum squad
I do think this will be the first fight I ll watch legally... Can t wait for it. Wilder will 100% be better this time, so who knows
Fury won both fights, seems odd to even do a third.
Necklace glasses bracelet headphone Wilder stop wearing heavy stuff 🤣
Winner of this should fight AJ
@Boxingegos boy wilder is a big dosser   Looks scared...headphones on because he can't take hearing about his failings last time about...fury been living in Wilders head.  And these clowns saying 2 time 😂😂😂
Boring, don't wanna see this again Tyson whooped his ass twice already, give us Joshua Tyson
Damn Fury has mental strength. Rumour has it he is still stood there…
I really wish that sausage really would only say it two time😡
Wilder looks heavier and Tyson looks a little leaner
Fury won even with Wilders op sunglasses and headphones🤣
2 time i think
Hahaha 2 time what?? Gonna be 3 time gypsy king beat his ass lol
* camera cuts to outside. sunset. sunrise. * inside: Wilder blinks. Fury farts.
Two times 😂
Longest staredown 😂
Waited him out just like he did Klitschko in the sauna, wilders already broken this just crushed him.
Weakness shown with headphones and dark glasses on,cain't hack it..
Wilder :  "After the staredown I discovered my shades were fitted with lead so that why I lost the staredown...as you can see I had to take them off"
Bomb squad!!
Why is the wilders team guy shouting 2 time? Because he lost both fights? 😅 bummmmsquadddd
There's literally no way Wilder wins this stare down; you lost arguably twice against Fury, how you gonna stand there and "intimidate" the dude who beat your ass?
BOOOOOMB SQUAAAD 👑👑👑 2 time......
Boring
I think they bout to kiss! 🤣😂
Wilder Will KO Fat Boy
Wiggas be rooting for fat glove sliding cheater.
There is a chance that wilder lands one but it would be an absolute shame if he gets lucky and does so. He’s not good enough
Can I just say that theyre two humongous as human beings. Like man give me some of that height
Whaaa why M i just seeing/hearing about this now?? 🤯
Who's that bum shouting two time, the only two time deontay can remember is getting smashed to bits TWO TIME by big tyson an soon to be 3 TIME
All wilder had to was ask for a picture... it lasts longers.... and bomb squad are a joke, pure weak as fuck Fury 1 - 0 and  technically he's gunna go 3 - 0 against this idiot, fury won the first fight in ma book, walked all over wilder the second fight
Wilder still didn’t recover from last time I believe.
Wilder just invoked a sense of genuine fear that man prolly has never felt in his life before with that soulful stare down and he tried to hide it behind that lil smirk. 😂 Would not be surprised if Fury calls it quits and retires after this bout bc Wilder is gonna put a brutal beating on him.
I was skipping this shit like porno
OK this is bullshit. Why the fuck did they make them stand there for so long. It's complete bullshit
What a nasty body this guy fury has
No one:  Random guy in the crowd: BOMBZQUAD!
All i heard was two tie?
Haha! After I heard his sauna story I was cracking up watching this.
Yay the fight nobody wants...
This two donkey scared Anthony joshua
Legends says Tyson fury is still standing there
Europeans don’t have American white guilt. Tyson bout to knock that boy out
Will someone help that guy? His tshirt is "2tight"
Man I really enjoyed this shit, fucking intense
Who still ties their jumper round they waist?
Wilder looked like a scared lil kid.
wtf -- wilder tyson faceoff
Man v Soy Boi 3 look at him in those girls jeans and footwear bwahaha
Bum squad
Can Tyson just knock him out already so we can all get the fight we ACTUALLY WANTED???!!!???!!!
Wilder has knockouts than IQ points
Two time what? Can someone explain pls
How many time fighting this two joker,no interes to watch
As soon as he heard the abuse coming from lil fat dude in the back wilder thought let's leave before we take a beat down lol
2x
Apparently deontay Wilders little brother is the newest member of the fugees and needs to practice for a show later.
They had to connect telepathically or what. I would be never able to look at someone like that long lol
Lol NAAAW I KNOW A MAN WHO KNOW THEIR IN DANGER FURY NOT LOOKING SO COCKY HIS CHEATING HUMBLE WILDER BUT MY GOD YALL FOOL AND DON'T NO BOXING HE EXTRA FOCUS MY GOD FURY GLOVES WILL BE CHECKED BEFORE ENTERING THE RING....
Think that guy was reminding wilder how many times fury has beat him
Will Deontay grow a pair of calves before the fight? Instead of those scaffold poles he has propping his body up
Idk this is happening
Tyson again 🏁
i really don’t care who wins, they’re gonna kill each other.
I’m not watching this fight, already seen it twice
Fury looks deformed. 😬🤭🤫
Wilder's staresown skills are better than his boxing skills. No way he's improved enough to beat Fury and this loss will be the end of his career. Very foolish to insist on the rematch.
Fury needs to be careful in this rematch.. Wilder could upset all you fan boys 😄. I would prefer a Wilder v AJ unification than AJ v Fury because it will be as boring Fury v Klitschko! Yawwwwwn!!
Make sure he don’t get up this time Tyson this man is boring now and his name needs to be ended once n for all, after him break aj to bits,
Hmm, TWO TIME BOMB SQUAD!👍 GLAD WE GOT THAT'CLEARED UP I DIDN'T HERE CLEARLY!
3rd fight after lady two wins for Fury? What for.
"Bum Squad", "Two losses!" LMAO
Don't know man Tyson wore the versace robe that's bad luck
Deontay lost that one hagahaha his sunglasses where too heavy
fury vs wilder 3? whaaaaaat? i didnt know about this. wtf
Wilder why put urself through this again, what can u say this time tho 💯🥊🤜🤛
USSR BABY!!
This was fun. Bum Squad XD
Is that how the Jojo anime works?
Wilder K.O. 8.
Ju gołing dałn sandej saturdej!!
Easy fight for tyson, that's why he took it over A.J for now. .....wilder didn't deserve a third considering how bad he got beat in the second fight.
Wilder didn’t even blink lol
Francis Ngannou would wipe these dudes out clean
Who actually cares anymore
Fury was standing there like someone waiting in line for a register at self checkout 😆
2 time.. 2 time.. 2 time.. Wilders just gravy🥊🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Tyson Fury is scared 😱
Hard to see that dad-bod is contending over anything other than the tv remote.
Boxings turning into WWE
Wilder is 👎🏽
The staredown still continues to this day... TO THIS DAY
Mmmmmm do I care to see this .....not at all
6:18 Tyson looks like he is about to cry cause his bff just left him
who is the "four eyed prick"?
Wtf I had no idea they were fighting again lol
2x..2x..2x.. "2 losses" hahahaha
How is tyson 6ft9 and deontay 6ft7
Some guy with tourettes saying 2 time 🤣
Say what you want but I just see Wilder win this fight
Tyson definitely shook that man fury. Fury act like Tyson didn’t knock him the first fight that’s they rematched.
Thats the right way, Deontay Wilder we don't Talk with Gypsy-cheaters GREAT💪💪💪👌👌👌😊😊😊🤙🤙🤙
Beyonce going to get battered again
what the fuck? did i just step into a parallel universe? i got de ja vu de ja vu...im moving to mars im sick of this shit...
Tyson fury came in like he just got done smashing a couple of footlongs like the cone heads
Bruh. It's over Wilder. Your body language says it all during the stare down
Legends has it, Tyson Fury is still standing there till this day
I think wilder is gonna win this one  Nothing is greater than redemption
"Two tiiimes!!" Yeah beaten two times already, third coming up👊
I'm a fan of both so I wish them both the best.     That dude who keeps yelling "2 Time" needs his ass beat though.
Till this dayyyy! 😂
All those fury guys same voices 😂😂👍👌
man if I was deontay i'd have some way better cans than fucken beats.
Deonte gonna lost again. He knows fury ate his best shot and has his number you can see it in his demeanor. He different after that last bout.
Both fighters are awesome, just don’t understand why all the excuses for a loss?
Even when Tyson is skinny he still fat
The Champ of excuse's gonna get his weak ass beat for the 3rd time.
Fury's taller than wilder what's good on. Wilder got something in his shoes? 😂
Reminds me of Meet Joe Black
Press had cameras on auto shoot, just praying one of them would pop off and smack the other one.  They were praying for a fight to break out on stage hoping they would be the only ones to get the shot...  even though they have 8k video recording...  😂😂😂
That shit was dumb as hell !!!
I think wilder will fuck him up this time.... He looks ready....
Stereotypical african american who likes blingbling, shiny shieet & overpriced headphones.
Legend has it that Tyson Fury is still standing in that exact spot.......till this day!!!
Yawn
Wilder with super thick heels on his trainers, make himself look taller!
Why’s Ben Askren getting involved?
Till this day.....well maybe tomorrow  then
Y’all keep talking about wilder . That man about to go and knock furry out . Furry cheat last time and it will show . Pin this comment
Bro they are looking at each other longer than my gf looks at me
Y’all talking like these men aren’t some of the hardest dudes on the planet.
I could of just pressed pause and watch the screen for 7 minutes. Or just close the video. Shit I should’ve just closed the video.
I clicked FF x10 and they still staring 🤣
Tyson Fury - Old school champ.
I hope so badly that Fury schools him again big time just because I am curious with which ridiciulous excuses Wilder is about to come up.
Is this all boxing has to offer in the heavyweight division?.3 title fights in a row same dude's fighting..
Nothing like watching a crowd of people with cameras watch two guys stare into each other’s eyes for six minutes straight
Wow i didn't expect thes
Dyslexic mic tester learning to count to 3 or is it method man remix
Wilder got that g style. Sliders, socks, long trackies lol. 👍
Some1 needs to hold shane bk..fucking hell!
nobidy wants to see this fight tyson is just to good for him
This is how you sell tickets. This is seriously personal
Tyson Fury: *Throws mental left jab*  Deontay: *Blocks and throws right* Tyson: Counter Deontay: NO I counter Tyson: Then I go this way Deontay: Then Ill go that way Tyson: *One eye goes left one eye goes right* b-but you said Deontay: *eyes spin in circles*
Wilder with the death stare!!!!
Klitchko knows what this means
2 time loser u doughnut
I love Wilders new hairstyle, Tyson has the psychological advantage, that's why wilder couldn't talk much
Has to wear headphones because he can’t take all that mental abuse like the last time.
If tyson should lose he still is 2 win in front the 1 was no draw
Kiss already..🤣🤣🤣
Even my bestfriend wouldnt look at me in the eye that long😂😂😂
What an absolute yes man with his head Stuck up wilders arse ‘ 2 time for 8 minutes’ embarrassing.
Longest face-off in history
Wilder gon Destroy this dude
3:48 Tyson broke. Hes got the lump in his throat. Theirs chink in his armor.
Hahahaha Wilder looks like he is going for a hike in the woods
I'm going for Wilder. He put Tyson on the ground and is the underdog.
Wilder: Ay I was wearing more clothes then him....
Tyson will beacome furyus. What deontey gonne bleme if he lose this one. That fury dad a dumbell in the right glove
two times
Wilder was a victim of his costume.
To even be allowed 3 chances to win is a piss take the guys had is head boxed the fuck in twice.. You fight anyone enough times you have a chance off losing at-least one! Joke this wilder and is excuses Fucking ridiculous
I'm a Tyson fan and he's clearly the better boxer but I've a feeling Wilder is gonna beat him this time. Just a feeling he's alot to prove now and he's gonna be hungrier than ever! Bloody dosser
Not sure I got it at the end, was 2 times? 🙄
Lady: Face forward to the cameras that are watching plz  10hrs later: 👁️👁️ 👁️ 👁️
Tyson just has too much weight on him and will smother him like last time.
Deontay "Delusional" Wilder
Who is shouting 2 time ??
В этот раз Уайлдер выиграет техническим нокаутом
Deontay listening his playlist over "chhu time"
Fury won this next time it should have the face off in a sauna to see who wins
If Tyson knocks out Wilder again, how many times will Tyson have beaten him?   That guy: 2 times.
This sum anime shit
Wilder was said to be shattered after his shades  and ear phones were to heavy.
Max was here
Bum squad
Prediction:  Wilder :” Man I got knocked out in round one cause my legs were tired from that press conference!”  Right…. Just like your costume wore you out last time?  😂 😆
It's as though God transfered Tyson Fury:s Ass fat to his low back. His gat absolutely no bum and way too much fat on his lower back and belly.
Tyson Fury looks cut
Whole face off like “two time” WTF? 6 minute face off ))))) Fury is a legend 💪🏼
Wilder is going to get tuned up again.
Ходят слухи, что Тайсон Фьюри до сих пор стоит
Tyson standing up there looking stupid as hell 🤣
Some comments: -Since when is Fury smaller in height than Wilder? -I think Wilder literally wants to murder Fury -I'm fucking excited and I'm glad they are doing a third fight -I really like both guys and don't know for whom to cheer
What Muscles was Tyson Fury trying to flex. With all that belly fat. His been too full of himself let's see what he can do. I swear the way this guy looks and the way he moves are too different things . 🤣🤣🤣
Wilder is a deluded crybaby with a soft fragile lil ego. Fury should have never given him a rematch after all the lies and accusations he threw at everyone. But watching him get embarrassed then cry again will be fun.
Sunglasses and headphones 🤣. Deontay- “I’m not scared, honestly”
They are both watching Netflix on each others face
Absolutely pointless fight. Total money making sham. Fury won like 17 of the 19 rounds they’ve fought, fans led up the garden path and robbed of a unification so these two can have another payday. Nah thanks I’m good I’ll sit this one out.
Fury i like it do you winner
Fury lookin fat like ben askren
The glasses had something in them that made me look away …
Wilders boys sound like they've got tourette's
I wonder how many times deontay won a championship
In Asian culture gazing into someone's eye's means you love them 😂😂😂
Huge Fury fan but he is about to find out what happens when you are old and you don't do cardio. Noone else seeing this!? Shame.
watch this to some saxophone music
I can see Wilder getting lucky and catching Fury with a big punch then being a bitch and not giving him the rematch
I heard Wilder will be rolled out in a wheel chair to the ring so he doesn't exhurt too much energy before the fight.
Never take your eyes off of your opponent for if you do, you lose. Simple as that.  Wilder whether if he knows it or not already lost as simple as a face off
Status: BUCK BROCKEN
Whoever is eating cereal in the background fast must be intensely looking 👀
Wilders trying so hard to prove something and Tyson's just stood there chilling 😂
Wilder will win! Easy KO!
Briefest
Fans dont want to see this 3rd go around.  Same fooking result.  Those weasel lawyers and promoters are forcing this on us instead of giving us the Joshua/Fury fight......Then they wonder why UFC is kicking their ass.
Wilder feeling safe with his headphones on, although they're a little heavy. Was waiting for wilder to point to the spot where the bad man hurt him
Wilder already becoming a YouTuber
This going to be a crazyyyy fight, atleast I hope so. Let’s gooo Furyyyyyyy!
this is so manufactured
I am not a Teddy Atlas fan but he said right after the first fight, “Wilder can’t fight”… I thought that was a pretty extreme statement given the draw and how close the first fight was, but it was obvious to me that for long stretches of the first fight, Wilder was just lost…obviously Fury figured it out….and somehow that knocked down in the 12th actually emboldened him.  He figured out that if he can back  him up, he can beat him down. And I do believe Fury when he says he is going to be 60% better this next fight than he was in the second fight.  So, I believe that Wilder has one chance….land a straight up bomb in the first or second…if he doesn’t, it will be “two time” as the annoying dude kept saying…two times getting cracked except this time it won’t be the corner stopping it.
The Sauna all over again🔥
Wilder trying to make fury fall In love with him so he goes easy
Weird
His head was found in a driving wheel, but his body's never been found.
Fury owns that man living rent free in his head
I had to pause to comment. Bro, how long is this fucking stare down it’s making me uncomfortable already.
Wilders hand was shaking like his legs in the last fight when he took his shades off.
i just watched 2 men staring at each other for 6 minutes straight and i don't feel weird at all.
Message to wilder; once someone has made you his bitch you cannot intimidate him with a stare down
Why is Wilder looking taller than Fury here ? Or is it camera perspective ?
Wilder will knock Tyson asz out…….
Goodluck to the both of them ✊🏽😎👍🏽
the only time the uk and us are on the same side in a youtube video's comments.
Deontay ain't want none of this
Wilder looks angry as f. That will be his downfall again, I agree with Fury, Wilder will almost certainly revert back to his old self!
That was intense. And then Deontay removed his shades and then.....it was love at first sight.  😂😂😂
is this the longest stare down in the history of stare downs?
im not scared or something like that but for me its very gay to look a other guy in the eyes that long
It’s scary when a man that speaks in volumes doesn’t say a word🤷🏿‍♂️
Something tells me Wilder is winning this one.
He's actually not hearing anything in those headphones.
DW groopies yelling bomb squad. TF is not a bumb, so DW is not knocking anyone out but himself. DW has benefited from fighting a bunch of nobody's and knocking out club fights doesn't count!
Don’t forget it’s two times
Wilder trying to focus by shutting out the noise and listening to the Spice Girls.....
Tyson fury is still standing there....... 2 days later
Uhh.. What happened to Tyson vs AJ?🧐
telepathic skills! They are actually shooting each other
Damn the hatred these 2 have in my heir hearts
Let’s go Tyson 💪🏼
Watch wilder make another excuse like his nappy got dirty and skidmarked so he felt uncomfortable in the fight, his mummy wasn't there to change his dirty nappy. He couldn't proceed with the show. Sorry bum squad
All I have to say is he only has one thing In his mind get those belts back and woop fury's ass.
😂😂😂😂 he wore the ear phones, so tyson would look stupid talking to him haha ei
Your getting knocked the fuck out wilder
Tyson is putting on more weight.
Is it really necessary to have them face off for almost 5 minutes straight hahaha
Wilder gonna walk out to the ring wearing a thong so he doesn`t get tired before the fight.
This was round 1 and Tyson Fury won
Durants security guard would of ended this quicker
Nice 2 inch lifts Deontay is wearing😂
that moment you realize fury is 5 years younger then deontay...
Got rid of victor breland 🤦‍♂️
They should just scissor and get it over with.
My poor ears. That damn camera clicking.
Never thouth i would have to fast foward a face off. 🤣
For crying out loud KISS ALREADY!!!
Them skinny jeans tho 😬😂😂
Fury look like he is going to whip his ass again
It’s all fake I love fury but boxing’s done all fake for show
I'm sorry. Its hard to take this seriously.  Grown fuckin men in skinny jeans
Lol corner shouting 2 time over and over, lost the last two fights and now just lost a face off aswell
Bumb squad
Fury - 3 Wilder - 0
almost 7 minutes of sweetness
Furry always look like drunken shit even if he is fucking amazing
This fight is on the name of wilder
Wilder looks weak and nervous. What's his excuse this time
Tuscaloosa taking it home this time 🤷🏽‍♂️💣
He thinks Tyson scared 😆 If Tyson Furry comes in 100 % focused  again should not b a problem to come up victorius again got furry on this one
There gonna be a part 4 lol
And they keepd on Clicking😵
If you know body language , then you bet for Fury again
Well those are 6 minutes wasted of my life
*I see social distancing is still a thing*
2 time, 2 time, 2 time, I'm a throw that towel 2 time.
Deontae’s team is retarted shouting 2 times
Tyson going to sleep this time
The bloke behind Tyson was a true British gangster. Horribly dressed and loud mouthed but will knock you out quicker than you can blink.
That idiot still standing somewhere saying 2 time to himself
Somebody get Guinness. We might the longest stare down in boxing history here.
The guy whose ripped leaves his shirt on and the fat slob goes bare chested hahahaha
So fury wouldn't fighting AJ?
Dumb shit like this is why boxing sucks these days and MMA is where it's at.
UFC makes boxing look like a circus.
Never seen so much shit talking while the two that actually fight are dead silent
Legend has it that Fury is still doing the stare down TO THIS DAY!😂😂😂
Tyson is wilder in  his head rent free the guy couldn't answer one question  what weak mentally he has some result tyson #still.
Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time Two time
This says it all...look at all the guilt in Fury! Even he knows karma’s coming! 🤴🏿💯💯💯
Why are they fighting again, its 2-0 for Tyson ? Why the rematch ?
I thought Fury was fighting Joshua next? That's a bummer. I have no interest in watching him beat down Wilder for a third time. And i wanted Wilder to go fight other fighters to get some win's then maybe try again after a couple years of him getting his confidence back. But nope he doesn't have anyone around him to give him good advice just a bunch of yes men idiots screaming bombsqad randomly. He fires people who dont just agree.
(1 week later) TILL THIS DAYYYYY TILL THIS DAYYYYY
😂😂😂😂
Legend has it, Wilder came back and they are still gazing into each others eyes….. TILL THIS DAY! TILL THIS DAY! TILL THIS DAY!
These are adult males by the way.
This guy is so weak minded.
That big gulp 5:25 shows that the gypsy queen is a swoller ol punk. I hate cheaters and July there will be a new champ.
Wilder gonna get fuck'd up again
The pointless fight nobody wanted to see 🙈
The bomb got defused twice Maybe third time is the charm ?
Wider Loks bigger than Tyson !?
Fury looks fat imo
Fury is gonna win me the easiest money since I invested in bit coin...thank you wilder!
Only one man standing Tyson Fury and Shane let’s go
Ummm 2 time?
2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time!
Wilder envisioning a massive right hand landing on Fury's temple. He wants revenge from that national embarrassment.
Most boring face off I’ve ever seen
Hope wilder doesn’t wear another heavy suit , might make him exhausted
tyson look a guilty stare
Chickenlegs getting KOd again
Headphones and sunglassess... A sign of fear if you ask me,  Or he is focused  But in either case Fury by KO
This was most intense the Logan vs Floyd
Tyson all day one tough SOB. Doesn't care for anyone
The bombszwuad was present during the last thrashing. I wonder if they got a new bomb.
When the game freezes up
The dumbest people are the ones that repeat a phrase instead of responding with their words. “2 time”
Big body Ellen was very upset at the end I hope all is well 😂🤣
Shawty said “what is happening?” You gotta understand
Was hoping deontay to change the script. He was suppose to let tyson leave first. So I'm just go ahead and say it. Tyson fury Via KO. Thereesss onlyy onneeeee tysonn furrryyy
Let the fist talk in the ring.
The ☠️💀 death stare. Anyway where can I buy the tickets at? Like 4 tickets no 🧢
This fight is personal as Shih that’s why that Stare off was 5min. Lol the press some annoying ppl complaining like, I get it but cmon, when two fighters have a fight this personal pictures facing the front doesn’t matter anymore. Ik y’all have a job but they won’t move at that point
Two time
Tyson has Jesus on his side… he can’t lose ✝️✝️✝️
Tyson fury vs Deontay Wilder face off 😶 vs 😶  Photographers🤨
I'm rooting against Wilder because of that idiot who kept saying TWO TIME
Bong squad?
4:56 Deyonte Wilder Corner “Two times!” Tyson Fury Corner “Two losses”
3:11 Til this DAY! lmao
Was someone doing their 2 X tables in the background?
Black lives matter
Did the guy shouting 2X rewatch the AJ vs Andy II fight?
LOL, Wilder looks like a clown and the sock shoes, LMAO. Tyson Furry got better gear and looks badass, even a bigger chain than Wilder.
So I guess Boxing is officially silly now
They said fury still standing alone in there , To this Day .. To this Day!
Tysons giant brother or friend.  "They're all pussies tyson" Dudes like 7'0  400lbs Come on man...  you're a real life Shrek it's not fair at all lmao
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nobody: Announcer: "Two time!"
I honestly can believe fury thinks he’s in shape 😂😂 he looks like melted ice cream likes absolutely awful
2 times like 2 times can box?
I forgot about that Pokémon thing where they have to yell ‘mom squat’ or something.
Fury in the same pans..
Francis Ngannou can eat these two alive on a street fight 😁
I wonder what jams wilder was playing this whole time. Had to have been a Metallica song for that long of a stare down. And I wonder if it looked like fury was lip syncing to whatever he was listening too....
Where's the kissing scene
Tyson Fury expression at the end was like, why so serious 🧐
My brian say wilder but my brain goes for fury
Didnt even know they were fighting again!? Thought Fury would face Joshua!
You got to Love  Tyson Furry 🤣🤣
Longest Staredown in the boxing history ever 😂🤣😂
Who's the fat bloke with the curls giving it the bigun behind tyson? It's all a bit embarrassing really. My mate will beat your mate "hold me back tyson, hold me back, he pinched my pizza"
Beyoncé looks scared 😱
me and my brother seeing who is going to eat the last piece of pizza
Why do some African-American people speak like special ed children?
I hate it but I think Fury is going to lose this time, I hope not but he's not even in shape.
All that one guy could say was, "Toon time!"
Did I just watch that whole thing while taking a shit then I made coffee and I ate some rusks and they still standing there
Was this awkward for everyone? I mean us too!!!
After some recent fights, now nobody cares if a fight needs sense..trilogy seriously? 🙏
Whos chunky mc nuggets??
2 rounds face off
My prediction: Tyson Fury will try knockout Wilder within the the first four rounds (No luck but will win all four rounds). Round 5-6 will swing the pendulum into Wilder’s favor due to his quick speed, combination of body shots (To gas out Tyson) and head shots. This will disrupt Tyson’s game plan which will result in Tyson going back to his old ways of boxing - Scoring points with quick jabs and forget about going for the knockout but his weight won’t allow him to move quicker to dodge Wilder’s jabs. Ideally Wilder’s team will want the knockout in round 8-9 as Tyson will be gassed out but the fight will go the distance. Wilder will win the fight by wining Rounds (5-9, 10-11) Wilder will have 2-3 knock downs.
The BronzeBomber is going to leave y’all surprised come July 24
Fury doesn't seem to be be very confident. It looked like, shit it's gonna be tought this time. I hope it will and we are gonna see great fight.
Didn’t realize Fury v Wilder III also included a face off for the Guinness book world record - longest staring contest before a fight.
My eyes went dry watching them stare at each other. Somebody should count how many times they blinked!
Why have headphones and sunglasses.   That is someone trying hard to stay focused and has mental distractions!!!   IMO!!!  He is nervous!!!
Now kithhs
After that staredown they went for dinner together, fell in love and lived happily ever after 💘💞
This was more entertaining than some boxing matches.
Wilders trainer wasn't supposed to move him before Tyson moved
Tysons right when he says Deontay will do whatever Deontay wants in there at the end of the day. If Deontay is just focused on murdering Tyson as a focal point hes already lost again. Not even a joke when I say he should of been seeing a counselor during all his training and down time.
Wilder got no rap for em. I say Wilder win by KO in 10th
My money is on the fat guy with the wild hair behind Fury. Throwing Towels TILL THIS DAY!!!
Wilder gonna destroy fury.... No argument
When I’m stoned and staring in the fridge.
Fury don't look as big as he was last fight...
Would love to see Deontay KO Fury bad this time so all the haters lose their shit.
She tried. A for effort!
4:24 "what is happeninggngnggg????"
If where going off math wilder wins the odds of fury not getting  ko are slim I like wilder to ko him out cold  ...
The Gypsy Cheat.
"they all possy tyson" yoo whos voice was that?
Damn , we live in such an empty culture where people have to lie and play dumb in order to feel proud. If you thought that 2nd fight was legit ,you've probably never won anything worth winning. Hahaha. Damn it must suck to be mediocre.
Legend has it...They are still staring at each other
Legend says "they are still continue face off on video call".
How stupid can anyone be the fight will be just as stupid and you will be even more stupid if you pay to see this trash they don’t make heavy weights like they used too what a shit show.
Why they keep taking photos if they are standing still all the time
No more weight vest vest wilder  eh
They both fighting each other with the sharingan
Noooooooo . And what happened with josuaaaaaaa !!!!!. Nooooooo owen this figth . We now fury best figther over wilder.
AWKWARD
They love each other so much that they forget where they are
borring, u could have done more than this
And New
Wilder lookin like a video game character with all the add ones 😂 lol. Clown. Fury already won.
ladies and gentlemen we have a fight.
My opinion is.. Deontay wilder is a fucking clown
Fury fat af 😂😂😂😂
Ain't no cheating this time fury
That was looooooooooooooooooooooooong
I like this Wilder. This Fury is an oversized oaf...
Fury loosing his neck fight night 😂💣🔥🐐
Wilder looks like he's gained some pounds for this rematch
Klitschko approves.
2time 2time 2time 2time 2time 2time
why tf he got that shirt on his waste?
Fury’s the big country Nelson of boxing. Don’t sleep on him
Juste ridicule cette durée ...
Damn fury looks fat as usual 🤣 Wilder better to ready
TILLLL DISSSS DAYYYYYYYY
Is this the third fight?
Tooôop
Pleaseeee beat this cheatin dudes Azsss !!!!
Thought Fury was fighting Joshua. What happened?
I'd hate to be stuck in a room with that one guy and DJ Khalid:  Guy: "2 TIMES!!"  Khalid: "another one..."  Guy: "2 TIMES!!"  Khalid: "Another One..."  Guy: "2 TIM-"  Khalid: "ANOTHER ONE!!"
Am I the only one who thinks stare downs are silly 🤔
How can you have an heavy weight belt and still fight only one person for more than a year ... don’t make sense to me
intimidating trousers
It felt like having a poo and some one standing there saying how much it smells
I’m convinced this is staged now
Is going to be a long fight
TWO TIME X1000
People still watch boxing?
4:32 thought back ground poster conor 😂
How to attract women  Google: Look her in the eye, but make sure not to stare too long.  Bing:
Some say there still looking at each other.
Wtf lol This was the dumbest shit I’ve ever seen in the sport of boxing lol I’m not sure what just went on here…
I dont give a fuck About this ... its already done..
My man just got called a 4 eyed prick lol
the pussio left first
It's funny how the press kept clicking  photos of them just standing their staring each other for 6 and a half mininutes
I thought 💭 Fury signed the contract to fight AJ , boxing 🥊 sucks , Fury be ducking AJ
I actually want Wilder to win. Gypsy king needs a rude awakening to quit acting like such a prick.
🤔wtf😭😆😆
Good thing they didn't fight right then and there, deontays headphones would've fatigued him leading to an unfair result.
Fury is dead scared This is another version of Wilder..
wilder lookin scary bro, we'll see who's making jokes when Fury goes night night
Wilder is shitting himself 🤣🤣🤣
I’m abit worried that wilder is quiet
BOMBSQUAD!!!
Tyson built so weird but wilder looking in shape so he won by looks even if they pay him to loose the fight
Wilder after 2nd KO loss: "Its because of the...  heavy headphones during the walkdown!!!"
That was longer than the movie the good the bad and the ugly 😂😂
Tyson looks in the same physical condition as the first... in the second he was extra fit.   I don't know... but I'm betting the longer odds on this 1
Wilder got some platform innersoles
who ever come's with me I'm with wilder. weather he win or lose. teamwilder 💪🏻😍
It's a lot of joking I'm the comments but that look I saw in deontay wilder eyes is that he gonna KILL tyson fury this time for sure.
Fury scared
curly hair thinks hes so hard
I like the fact tht wilder not concentrating on fury's mind game, the man got a very big mouth.
Bomb squad got pumped last time and will again hahahahhaha
These comment are sad, thats why i dont like people so many sheep in the go along get along gvng smh
"2 Times"... I wish Fury just knocked that fella out and then wilder... C'MON FURY 👊🏼
Wilder BOMAYE! Wilder BOMAYE!!
Bum squad .
Tyson Fury is the real deal. That other guy and his crew are a joke.
Guiness World Record for the Longest Staredown🤣😂🤣
Looking all tough with his headphones on..listening to the dancing queen by abba...
That was super awkward
lets keep it real the one’s that’s going for fury didn’t even know about him until he fought wilder also majority of fury’s fans are racist and are happy a white fighter beat a black fighter. Plus y’all are booing an American fighter in America and rooting for a foreigner 🤦🏾‍♂️ crazy cause I actually like Fury
Must be something wrong with my ears because I didn't hear how many times.
We get it, he beat your boy two times.
I hope Wilder doesn't try to make it about race again.
Bum Squad... 2 Time... Bum Squad... 2 Time...
All Fury fans, laugh now, cry later.
End of Wilder
beats by dre? wtf man
Wtf I didn’t even know this fight was still happening
BUUUUUUM SQUAAAAD !!!
If by some miracle wilder puts fury to sleep. Then he ruined the mans legacy and chance to bang with AJ which is what we want to see. Not him fighting a guy he beat twice already FFS
There's going to be a highlights version of this stare down.
How did they not laugh
All you could hear are camera shutters going crazy over there. Ain't nothing different happened from the first pic to the millionth pic.
Fury looks worried... He's not the showboat like last time
Wilder is so fucked up in the head that he has to wear headphones
Fury didn't know what to do. He put his hands behind his back like a dog would tuck his tail behind his legs. Then Wilder took Furys soul & left while Fury stayed frozen like a statue!!!😂😂 Rip FURY
Now kiss
When Wilder took the headphones off. You can see fury acknowledge the fire in wilder eyes. This is why I love boxing. Only people who have been in the Gyms, in the ring and trained can catch the things unseen. And this is two greats of our age going at it a 3rd time. It's going to be war. IM WITH WILDER but I love Fury the king of the Gypsies. This is a modern day myth. I can not wait.
Wilder won the stare down,,, hands down  ,, if i ever felt a boxers intension, it was now,,, Wilders silence was golden ,,Tyson looked like a tower swaying  in the wind,,
10-9 Tyson
Can you imagine guys if the unlikely happens and wilder gets the ko and puts a stop to the aj fight, what a depressing thought
Imaginary fight, clearly forming concepts of how they will fight.
Mental victory
How anyone can’t see that this was always the plan and these idiot are now trying to over seek it is beyond me....I love Tyson fury but he is so full of shit it’s unreal.
Conor needs to by you guys better cameras or hire better camera men. Not one video where the camera isn't shaking
Wilder grew wtf?
Fury gona tshet again
tell me not fury look like the beast titan
Wilder just had to rebuild enough energy in his twig legs to walk away.
Wilder low-key look scared
Wilder the drama king, Fury would still win 😂
Hope wilder wins
The longest face - off  in boxing history
Legendary face off
Wilder won the first fight KO( facts) Fury won the second fight
That stupid ass yelling “2 thyme” 👱🏿‍♂️
Its been said that Fury is still standing there til this day
Fury knows his career is coming  to an end. Rip to cheating Fury legacy!!
Gypsy King! My Brother.. I give you my ancestors strength!
That’s what you call a death stare (from Wilder).
Deonty Wilder is already protecting his ears🤣🤣
2 time loser
I hope wilder knockes him the fuck out
Dude is saying, "two time" till dis day
That was awkward
Flubby Flappy glove fury was about to pass out holding his stomach in 🤣😂🤣😂😭
Tyson standing there at the end like … mmm he’s mad asf … I might need to work on my back up plan ..where I run around the ring and jab & have boring fights ..l just saying..letsee
Wilder was listening to uh oh by busta rhymes!!! 💣SQUAD!!!!
Mental game so far goes to Tyson.
40 year old man dress like he's barrowed his clothes from Some new kids off the block, cheating Dork!
Says a lot about Wilder walking away first.
WILDER LOOKING LIKE A PUNK!
Wilder listening too some Nipsey hustle, 50 cent, Young Thug, Gucci Mane & Poo Shiesty , Lil Durk and more thru those headphones! He just blocking out the noise!
What an intimate stare these two have. They prolly love each other more than anyone
Gypsy!  Give me your tears!
Fury looks like he keeps dookie stains in his drawse..
🇮🇪🇵🇸🇮🇪🇵🇸🇮🇪🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
#AndNew what? #AndNew excuses? #AndNew underwear?
my pizza was ordered and delivered during this entire stare down
Gypsy King!!!
I like Wilder but I believe he doesn’t have any chance with this mad Gypsy King !!   I hope he does prove me wrong !
This is Bull shit
I hope Deontay doesn't get weighed down by his costume this time
This is a waste of time. We all know the results the same. It's obvious fury would ragdoll wilder. I see 50 year old out of prime  Mike Tyson  having a better chance of knocking out fury than deontay wilder ever will. Next !
Well that was weird
who gave the idiot repeating "too time" on the mic ?
Deontay " sorry ass excuses " wilder
I don’t believe Tyson Fury is winning it this time.
Tbh. They both look like they sen a Goast. Can't wait for this Trilogy.......
I hate bringing up the obvious but Furys team don't have to say anything, it's hard to listen to the ignorance,  2 time, 2 time, 2 time, No fucking brains!!
Fury look dumb asf 🤣
That's a C section
All these cornball Brits bout to get a rude awakening when cheating Fury gets KOd. I'm so confident, I'll bet money...
All I'm gonna be thinking about for the next hour is: "TWO TIME!"🤣
Quick question, are they in love after that melting sexy hot loong looooong eyes contact '' on THIS DAYY '' 🔥👀🔥😍🐛🐷
Fury looked to be a very worried man when Wilder left, deep breath . Fury is not winning this 1.
"Basketball player" I still can't get rid of that😂🤣😆
Wilder looks like a stick with a headphone on
You got your ass beat "two times" that's for sure
What happen to Tyson fury Vs Joshua fight?
Ordinary face off....Wilder still had his complete 200 pounds costume on. This guy must have silly reasons to have weak legs
Plot twist : Wilder was listening to Bieber and couldn't hear shit
Legend has it they are still staring at each other. They used CGI for the end segment.
Big Shane
"My t-shirt was like 80lbs, and my trainer didn't show up after I fired him. it's a setup, the fight is going to be rigged, just looked at the evidence"
Tyson's brother was ready to whoop up on mr 2 time over there.
A boxer against a truck driver
Man’s got oatmeal belly like he den had like 6 babies.🤦🏽‍♂️
With music and sunglasses.. Weaknesses spotted.
@1:18 a delusional Wilder fan : And New 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 wtf
They’re using their stands ala jojo
Wilder va a perder
I had a bad feeling Tyson's gonna be knocked out this time😭😭
Tyson look scared af lol gulping and everything he know he Finna pay with his cheating ass this time they’ll make sure he can’t cheat by checking his gloves
I think he’s ready . He’ll accomplish his goal soon . 🥂
👍🤝🤝 UK
Wilder will win for sure unless Fury puts that Gypsy curse on him.
Deontay Wilder = Marvin Vettori
Why its a 3 one nigga got beat twice 😒
Tyson look 👀 like oh shit I might need another pair of me lucky 🍀 gloves 🤣🤣🤣
Legend has it they still staring at each other .
Wilder Knocked Fury out twice & Fury didn't knock Wilder out so I don't know why everyone is saying Wilder loosing this time.
Tyson all relaxed wilder looks like his about to explode 🤣🤣🤣
If u watched the whole thing like me your a true fan lol
Is it the camera angle, or did Wilder grow a couple inches?!?
Wilder needed to save all his energy for the face off that's why he didn't talk. Fury is living rent free in his head and the music is blocking it out
now. this is a fight...
It's Wilder's turn to win. This one is a big money maker they cannot let this rivalry go so easily.😅
She said 3 isn’t this 2!!!
2x
Bunch of Brothers running thier damn mouth when they get their azz whooped every time!
I wonder what Wilders excuse will be this time.
The guy is SCARED HE KNOWS WHAT TIME IT IS AND THE NEWWWWWW!
Ok we got the before shot of wilder. Can't wait for the after-shot.
Yal Trippin, Wilder gonna knock his ass out cold ! Fury gonna go in boxing as usual, Wilder coming in swinging with CRUEL INTENSIONS. This go 9 rounds, max.
Deontay Wilder took them glasses off and looked soft...  Like a little boy
Called him a " boy".... I be fucking damn.... Wilder better break his face!!!.... So we know Fury stands for FÜHRER
Anthony joshua sure lookin skinny these days
Ahhhhh nothing has changed - wilders already lost.
This time Tyson will KO him!
Wilder gunna murder this dude 💯
The most overrated trash boxer of all time Deontay Wilder
New record broken for the longest stare down in history
I can't believe we're watching Deontay Wilder's bum-azz  What a sad sad State of Affairs
I go Fury to Win but Wilder maybe this Time better will see
One of those guys is pregnant after that stare down.
Anime mind battle thing going on here.
wilder already actin weak,take the headphones off man!!sign of weakness
OMG wilder didnt talk! Thats a blessing bc he sounds like a fkin idiot when he does. Maybe he did learn something
Two time.......number of times Tyson embarrassed him in a ring
Gypsy King all night long..
2 time.... Yeah. 2 times Wilder's gonna get Knocked out.
They look like two different weight classes.
No matter what anybody say about this it was dope  never saw this before This is everything for wilder career I think
Boxing needs new characters cause this is some lame shit.
Legends have it they are still starring at each other 😂
I concerned about Wilder. Thouse headphones looked heavy
So easy to rig stare off. Just tell them “let’s make it the longest stare off ever to make it more interesting” but people will say staging a fight is more likely. Imagine staging a fight around true fighters
Wilder looked focused,Tyson didn’t give a fuck.
Whether or not wilder wins its obvious he is taking this as serious as he can. A lot of yall have never truly been focused before and it's showing in your comments lol. In order to truly focus you must remove all distractions. Tysons mind games are a distraction. I wouldn't doubt that he wasn't even listening to anything just tuning everyone out. Just like the last fight I won't pick a winner. I just know this will be a barn burner
To this day😂
2 time loss for wilder
Is that Beontay's groupies saying 2x? Muppets lol
Someone in the audience said “ To this Day” 😭
Wilder doesn’t even deserve this rematch. Got fucked up in the first fight.  Got knocked the fuck out in the second fight.🤣😂. It’s sad that boxing need to keep having the same money fights over and over again. That’s because boxing isn’t producing any new real fighters.  Just the same fights over and over again and now YOUTUBERS… wilder should of taken an easy fight for a return. Beat someone’s ass, get his confidence back then fight fury.
"and new" sooo annoying.
Is that Beontay's groupies saying 2x? Muppets lol
Wilder is about to beat the breaks off Fury
Of course they are not gonna be looking away. It's the professional thing to do. Photographers are still taking their shots; you can hear the clicking of their cameras. Their sports psychologists, Youtube sports channels, fight analysts, etc suggest that this is the best way to intimidate their opponents and get into their heads. They are not gonna be looking away.
I went for fury on the first 2 fights but I've  got this feeling wilder is gonna come back with a win. that L changed him for the good it humble,motivated,determined  and vengeance
Gypsy King.Allelujah
Yeah all going to be on wilder jock after he knocks Tyson fury out
Tyson fury is the final boss of the dad bod conglomerate
Why won’t Joshua or Ruiz fight any of Thais 2 guys 🤔
You can look at his posture....his look during the face to face.  He's beaten already.   He's hearing the voices in his head now.  & STILL HEAVY WEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD TYSON FURY.   Fury by tko no later than Rd 7
Should have an option so i  can dislike this video 2 time
They called each other and planned this 🤣
Wilder has no right to trash talk 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Looks like Tyson is partying again and eating alot of burgers. Maybe also putting something up his nose?
better get another suit of armor heavier this time...  ...Oh wait is that an egg weight i see in tysons hand...
Joshua is afraid
i watched in 2x and it still felt long
Wilder gonna kill em.
Hope wilders headphones didn’t weigh his neck down or something
Have his gloves check even mid round the king cheater is scared
good grief again?
This had me laughing..I have a feeling that Wilder is going to KO Fury. He showed no emotion. He was looking into Furys soul.
I really don't understand why wilder was even worthy of an immediate trilogy
Think they Just Fell in Love 😍❤❤❤❤❤
Fury been training with Nick Diaz. 🖕🏻
Legend says that Tyson Fury is still standing there.
Why did wilder agree to the fight , it’s just sad at this point
Go Tyson 🤜🤜🤜
Ok so how was joshua fight off and when did this happened!?
💤 😴
Wilder here for the final payday who knows he might get lucky and land one but probably not
Wilder is ready to kill 🤒
2 losses was the funniest thing
They fighting again for what?
I wonder why tha Media is still not addressing Wilders' allegations of Fury cheating especially since Fury has a history of cheating and also considering tha evidence???
oh I thought Joshua's next for Fury
And "New"... Loss and excuses...
The legend says that Fury still standing there.
Wilder looked away first, and turned into a pillar of salt!This is going to be Biblical!!!
Mr two time: GET IT RIGHT
I feel like fury gonna lose
Y'all can hate but deonta look different money on wilder
Guys guys, wilder totally learned how to box now, this fight will be different I swear!
Tyson looks like a bag of milk or a reptilian in his new skin type awkward wtf is wrong with his body for real 😧
Why Tyson look shorter than usual?
I just watched 2 men stare at each other for 6 mins
I kinda feel bad for Deontay. I think fury truly did mess his head up
Asmr..  anyone
That's kinda gay
Excuse into two times.~wilders corner
I need wilder to finish him off decisively for the culture !!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Just kiss already
Please don’t scream racism or equality when Fury knocks the dog shit out of wilder again. We want Fury Joshua 1.
Exited....😍👍
He will win the trilogy 3-0
Look like wilder still skipping leg day
Wilder wins trilogy
They say if you look into someone's eyes long enough you fall in love
Notice how these security guards,  most likely armed, didn't dare to touch anyone of them two. This fight will be crazy!
Fury beats him again in July.
That’s a MENTAL victory for FURY 👌🔥
This fight is gonna turn out very ugly, the tension is just too high. Whoever wins this one will have the loudest voice. #fury/wildertrilogy.
Fury isn’t getting up this time.
What’s with Wilder being silent and not promoting the fight Wilder is a complete looser
First to laugh loose😅
Tyson built like a one piece character
Gypsy King puts the other guy to sleep... And tells him a nice story afterwards
Wilder standing there with he’s headphones on listening to twinkle little start
I feel sorry for wilder
Ha ha ha. Come on Tyson! Train again like the second fight and don’t leave it to chance!
Easy win for fury. Wilder should have taken a tune up.
The dork saying two time over and over definitely a cheerleader. I can't stand men cheerleading. Lol. Sounds like a nut swinger for real.
Heating up in there
This could be a Guinness World Record for longest staredown.
What a joke of a sport
They should take more pictures... just since the first 40,000 looked so different
Already beat him again
Two time! Two time!  * wakes up from dreaming *
They are waiting for the click sounds to stop
Wilder’s Guy: 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 ti… Fury’s guy: 2 losses Wilder’s guy: yea!…
anime scene
Who's the groupie screaming two times
@6:19 "Shut your mouth you p*$$y"
Boxing finally has a face off that accurately represents how exciting boxing is now
You got the moron in the back screaming to time and I have to agree with him two-time law for Deontay Wilder this is fixing to be very bad for him he thinks that being quiet is playing with Tyson's head but realistically he's going to hear what Tyson said eventually now he's in his emotions you can't box emotionally you have to stay focused Tyson Fury's fixing to smash this chump again
too taaah… too taah… shut the fuck uuup!!!!
Wilder knocking this fat junky out. I can't wait
2x 2x 2x ... Guy working on his multiplication out loud.
Deontay wilder will lose again Tyson Fury figure him out already I’m not ordering this fight at all . I wanna c Tyson fury vs Joshua. Fuck this fight Deontay wilder will lose easy I already know how this fight will go that one two punch 🥊 Deontay wilder has and Tyson fury will counter it … Tyson Fury got Deontay Wilder Humble don’t know why he wanna fight him again Deontay wilder will get knocked out again.
Flabby fury thinks he's something to be reckoned with hopefully he leaves the doctored gloves at home and hopefully wilder doesn't wear a 100 pound suit haha what a joke
If only Tyson didnt cheat this time, i think he will still beat Wilder tho
Them staredowns hit different when its elite heavyweights
Why is this happening? Fury arguably won first fight, demolished him in the 2nd... n the result will be the same the 3rd... this is boring
"Tyson fury in a party I make shoulders fling"
That 🐀 is done
Bomb squad is going to get bombed again by Fury.
The only decent challenge Wilder overcame was that one chip challenge.
2x Wilder lose
Thats not intensity coming from fury he's uncomfortable
Just kiss and get it over with..😆
His coach drugged him again, that's why he lost the stare down!
Who got $100 on Fury I'm riding with my brother Wilder like always.
This is the second most sensual press conference stare down I’ve seen.. second to Floyd and Logan almost kissing
That nagger saying 2 time
Usually wilder is talking and being loud. Nahh he bout business this time he about knock fury out!
This is just weird lol
Wilder better get the win this time or his boxing career is OVER.
Tyson should come out to the fight wearing wilders walk in ring attire!
BUMMMMMSQUADDDDDDDD
Tyson definitely looks the most out of shape, of all 3 fights. When is it?
Last fight had a racist KO
Fury looks out of shape
Tell me the name who is saying 2 tym😂
when wilder thinks of fury he will always remember that, Tyson Fury is the one who got back up. Tyson Fury is the one he couldn't stop. Tyson Fury is the one that just kept coming. Tyson Fury is the one that put fear in his heart for the first time in a long time.
Winder will win
All that staring he doin..he so mad he got completely humiliated in the last fight..His pride is him eating him alive..cant wait to see him lose again..😅😅
What amazes me is that you can hear the clicking of photos being taken the whole time. What kind of photos were they taking?
If man would take a stand with prayer, action and a plan. And stare and stand in front of the enemies that are destroying families that way. This world would be a better place. Embrace what is alive and ready waiting on you. Jesus Christ!
BumSquad
Breaking News: Wilder pulled out of fight due to an injury. His coaches say it was due to the 40 lbs of gold around his neck.
Looks like they felt in love 😂
Deontay Wilder will get knocked out easy work
who is the other fatty behind fury .. they look like bar brawlers
The white man probably going to win
Lol wilder trying to use fear again during the star down while fury is looking at him like I'm going to do the same number on you only much easier
Wilder seems focus. Fury seems out of shape as usual
Fury looks like his ancestors were cave dwellers.
These guys are huge tho!
Fury looks like he doesn't take showers.
Both dude is under each other genjutsu
ahhh shit. deontay will win. 1st round knockout
Wilder broke the stare down, 👎🏼 he will lose again.  Tyson is mentally stronger than Deontae.
Fury looks likes he drives around with his you know what in his hands. Ole perverted justice looking ass..
Does he wanna burst the other ear drum now 💀
Tyson looks like a clown still standing there 🤣
Body languages shows Wilder is subtly rocking himself, meaning he is finding some comfort in that. He knows what he's up against and there are nerves.
Bum squad
Гейлорда заклинило, похоже, Фистинг Фьюри, снова задаст ему трёпку.
If it was ufc they would have been fucking eachother up already this boxing stare down shit is shitty
Fury looks like he keeps a glass pipe in his back pocket..
Dude in left : Bum squad Dude in right : TWO TIMES                                  🎧 Them: 👁️👄👁️ 👁️👄👁️
I knew Tyson would be the last to back down.
"THWO TIMES"  x16
Fury looks like he likes people doing tricks in his you know what.. 😥
누가자꾸투타임거리는거지
Fury built like a xbox mini fridge
I'm a time traveler... wilder gets knocked out in the 4th round. . at 2:15
Fury never lost the sauna room one either with vlatimn 🤣
I don’t really care about Fury Wilder 2, the person I’d like to see get punched is the “two time”
Wilder gonna say the sound in his ears was 40 pounds heavier output this time than normal 🤣
🥊 Can’t wait
Sunglasses and headphones wtf is that shit
Fury gone smoke that ass again
Fury looks like he doesn't take showers.
Who the hell kept saying "two times?"
Man  wilders team is full of a bunch of babbling retards. Man I fucking love it when someone says the same thing over and over let alone for five minutes straight
Fury will win again even if Wilder does learn how to box.
Why do they call themselves the "bum squad"?
Fury is going to get his outta shape ass knocked the F out!!
Going off that stare down, mark my words Wilder will win.
Let see tyson cheat in 2 fight or its his real power now🙏🙏
Wilder better destroy this Crackhead the minute he step on the ring
"Now kith" Mike Tyson
Finally! a boxing match worth watching
1:17 That was the saddest and most unconfident "and new" I ever heard lol.
Fuck man this is horrible
Wilder Dwayne Johnson
Fury had egg weights in his eyes..... his hat was half off.... Wilders headphones were too heavy..... what else?
I feel like this one was stretched out a  bit. Not for the long stare off but the fact that its the third fight
Ya she got blanked lol
Well DAMN... Wilder must of been listening 🎶 to the Mike Jones back then extended chopped and screwed  version! Zoninn🤣 ! Hope it aint a repeat!🤦‍♂️
Some people just don’t know when they’re outmatched, Wilder’s in for yet another ass whooping.
Cannot wait to see it!!!!
the match no one wants thats boxing tho
“Bettttt you won’t swiiiinnngg!”  Me in the back: 👁👄👁
Is this a latest update or of the past?
People are saying this is intense? Yall lost it..boxing is dead..they look at each other for  10 min and so nothing. Pussies if u ask me. Boxing is fucked. We already know who’s going to win. But the money was more important then entertainment
Fury at a certain point during this stare down felt and fully understood this is a different guy, looking into his eyes, his body language, him not saying one single word then his guy touched his arm and he puts his glasses back on turns and walks away and you could see fury's face he felt all of that energy from Wilder. We might be getting something special with Wilder on fight night a preview of a style we've never seen him really use because let's be honest if the right trainer is training him he would have added some much into his game because not only does he have power he is lighter then pretty much the whole class which means he is faster as well!! And he could bring so much more if he used his speed more. Cannot wait to see this fight to see how it goes
Wilder will win this fight mark my word  Respect for tyson fury🙏💪👊👊
Y'all don't get it. Fury is done
Lol , my introvert ass got  anxiety even by watching them from screen . 😭
tyson shouldn't of put himself on the throne as the one. he is going to have to be put down.
They are visually communicating how they feel about one another 💥
I fxcking love Deontay Wilder. Baddest man on the planet. You all shall see!
He beat him 2 times already, why they fighting???
Alot ppl right now are so hype about this shit and they thinking that Wilder is scared or type shit but bro realtalk the man who dont talk too much is more scary compared to man who talks alot realtalk!
2 time... what dad did to mamma..
Wilder is broken
Guy keeps yelling toon time. Space jam 2 isn’t out yet, and that’s not Lebron bruh… “toon time! Toon time!” Did bugs bunny pay that dude to keep hyping the movie?
I can tell the build up to this fight is gonna make a lot of great memes
Well, there's 4 minutes I'm never getting back...
“ 2 times “…. Yeah 2 loses 🤣
Maybe fury has padding in his glove this time or wrist slap works again.
Two time
I was hoping he’ll drop the shades..Deontay got that killer shark in the water look. Hope it shows in the ring.
No bomb squad?
This is gonna be ugly… Tyson is really gonna run him over like a 18 wheeler
This is how I look at myself in the mirror after I didn't use a condom.
TILL THIS DAY!! there are still standing there🤣🤣
Wilder smash that scammer!! And make sure he's gloves are all good!!!
Anybody noticed that people aside from the fighters are freakishly tall as well?
No floppy gloves can't cheat this time. He's dead he going to have to box his ass off his power has been  canceled.
Oh man.. i think wilder is in beast mode. He usually talks a lot, but this time he's just staring like starving. I think after this fight, no matter how the decision is, he'll never regret it.
I look forward to this fight. I'm picking Tyson to clean this series up.
Two Times Yes he lost Two Times!
ION KNOW‼️ Dat boi Wilder looks steady n ready‼️💪🏾💯
Yeah i got a feeling tyson fury no this gone get ugly this time around
If anybody was wondering the guy said 2 time 36 times
Ooooooooh shiiiiiiiiiit!!!!!!!!!
Well this got awkward to the point I wished someone would do a tiktok dance off.
Boxing is dead
Cameraman eating a lot of snacks
At least Wilder's  hair Is appropriate . He's  gonna get mopped across the ring
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, u look away you lose.  How goofy. Zzzzzzzzzz
Wilder listening to all I do is win.
Legend has it they’re still starring each other down
Not a great look for Wilder. It’s sad because Fury should be fighting Joshua, not this excuse ridden sore loser.
So who spent 6 mins watching these 2 guys just stare at each other?
Wilder: someone tainted my drink thats why I blinked first during stare down
Tyson looked more in shape the last fight but there’s more than a month left so he better turn on the after burners. The bronze bomber looks ambitious AF to get his ish back. This is gonna be a great fight man. Sick and tired of all these cartoon boxing matches. I’m happy REAL boxing is going down
Fury looks like a Swedish backpacker in SE Asia 🤠
Lets Go Champ(WILDER)!!!
Bum will exposed again
Tyson : this guys gonna kill me
I have a feeling Wilder will win this time.
Let go tyson end the trilogy and then beat josha greatest heavyweight of this current era
Wilder : Okay I'm done with stare-down. Fury : (ushering his hand to Wilder's corner) Well then, lady's first. lol 😂😂😂
Fury looked worried for some reason….
Wilder is so cringe..  Can't wait till he gets out boxed AGAIN so he can dissappear/retire/whatever ..
Whats the point of these stare downs or face offs? Osaka was right, some of these media events are absolutely pointless esp.to athletes who juat want to get on with their job and leave....cringe if anything.
I can't wait to come back to these comments and say "I told you so" to the Wilder haters! #BombSquad
Legend has it that’s they’re still staring at each other
someone’s gonna clip this into a 10 hour ASMR version
Tyson
I just keep hearing Dave Chapelle 'Two dudes - I like you, like you too dawg...let's get married' 😂
Two time of what? Dude lost twice LMAO
How many time?
Idk wilder looks like he’s ready to proof himself again. He is not going to walk into the ring underestimating his opponent ever again. And you can see it in his eyes
Wired
Wilder up there looking like a whole Skeleton. I pray he has modified his boxing skills cause if not....I can only imagine
He’s going to blame his tight ass pants for loosing the stare down!
I hope Wilder has learned how to properly box since the last one , that head hunting just isnt going to work on the slick gypsy !!!!!
That was to much
2 times 2 times I would like to drive who ever keeps saying that in the head two times
Me rubbing my palms together in excitement, Can't wait.
I’m rooting for bomb squad on this one
Oh shit. I’m surprised deontay made it to the face off with those headphones on. Thought they would have tired him out
Wilderr winn
Hope fury knocks him out, wanted to see fury vs Joshua....this is just annoying cause fury beat him twice.
Wilder still trying to convince himself. Buddy shook.
2 × 2× oh God shut up
Wilder has no music playing  That’s how I would rock it Let me here what ppl saying while they think I can’t hear I do It all the time  Earphones in/on nothing playing
Leave it to Americans to root against the American.
Was it that necessary 🤔
Hope Wilder doesn't get killed. Fury will give Wilder even worse beating this time.
Phhooo! You Blinked!
Fury will loose
Stop saying 2 time
Tyson fury 🏆
Holy shit it feels so nice to see a promotion for boxing that doesn’t involve any YouTubers or retired boxers.
I want wilder too win soo bad 🏅
It's hard to look tough with a sweater tied around your waist...tough just doesn't work like that. 😐 -Bang!💥
Wears mask and head phones to weigh in. Then looses stare down. Beta behavior.
Gotta go with Tyson Fury seems to be in a better head space than wilder
Wilder more focused than before..
Furys fans are scared 😭😭😭 Deontay is about to take the throne 👍👍
Hahahahahaha..AWesome!! Deontay is looking fit and hard but still scared. Needed sunglasses and headphones!!! Say what you want but when you get your jaw broken and your ear drum burst its hard to come back from that.
@ 6:16 the moment tyson realized he is in deep trouble and this isnt a game.
Year of the dad bods 👏👏👏
Funny if they'd just turn the lights off and everyone leave, they'd still be standing there 😆
Tyson wins the first exchange lol
Deantay wilder fucked up the biggest jeavy weight fight ever. Wilder gets knocked out in the 5th
Fury got the body of a 52yr old council worker lol
Lessss go Bronze Bomber! 💣 👑
Fury was prepared to stand there all night if he had to💀💀
What a waste of time
Finally some real boxing. Im tired of you tubers and scrawny middleweight bouts. Heavyweight championship fights like this are unmatched
Wilder got nuthin for him.
Wilder don't forget one billion black Africans somewhere in Africa are behind you, your people been fighting and still fighting till this day ❤️
They are playing out the fight in their minds lmao
Deontay Wilder finna knock this nigga out
It’s funny how the people talking sound exactly like the the people in the stare down lol
Why are these grown ass men dressed like they’re in Highschool?
This is hilarious 😆
Wilders a bum all hype
Fury will be sleep in 4-!..
Wilder making excuses “till this day”
This is Wilders time Fury is so fuckddddd 💣 squaddddddddddddddd in the house
Wilder prolly playin young boy or lud foe bass boosted thinkin bout murderin fury
Titan Fury
With the weird glove shit that tyson did the last time... i think wilder is gonna knock his head off this time..
Fury will pay with his blood, Judgement is near
Boxing sucks now
Love at first sight
Wilder looks ready to whip some gypsy Asssss
Why does that parrot keep saying “TOO-TAA”
Dude boxing is so overhyped and melodramatic. Fuckin kick to the gut and its over.
Fury is that deep in wilders head he has to wear headphones 😂
This is the bum fight We wanted Anthony Joshua
Deontay looks defeated already, real slow to take off then glasses huh
Wilder will lose again.. I wonder what wild excuse he'll make this time.
I have seen alot about crypto investment and I saw how people  get paid directly to there bitcoin wallet am really interested in investing and earning can  someone here Link me up with a professional crypto trader.
Fury won the staredown. What’s Wilder’s excuse? Heavy chain? Heavy headphones? 🎧
why they fighting again lol its 2-0 why him a 3rd go
SO... why is there a number 3?
I don't watch boxing much but fury was gonna fight joshua right? What happened to that
You look a bit flabby Ty, sheeessshhh, i sure hope you ain't gonna let us down ...
I think Wilder going to f*** him up this time
the camera shots sound like someone eating crisps in a tv advert
Why is Ben Askren trash-talking the bomb squad?💣
Wilder keeps trying to prove he can beat Tyson Fury...... AND THE GYPSY KING DOESNT HAVE TO PROVE ANYTHING.... Nighty Nighty Wilder🤕🤕😴😴😴
I like how he's wearing those headphones 🤕 to keep his eardrums from falling out.
Is it just me or does it look like it says FAG on the side of wilders shirt 😂🤣😂🤣
STARCH WILDER VS. TYSON FURY
Does dontey have lifts on his shoes.  what a joke .  hope he gets knocked out in 30 seconds.
Wilder is still fucked up from 18 months ago.lol Fury straight laced his ass!!!!!this is Wilders last stare down
Haha I love it
What, No kissing?! No wonder MMA crushing this art
The other guys around them" Go get a room, you two"
Wilder no jab loading up on the right hand predictable championship in Europe for 2 and a half decades
I'm I the only one who finds wearing headsets during a staredown to be a sign of weakness? Like you have to audibly shield yourself from the room or something.
Fury looks out of shape. I hope he wins
Fury already defeated, and how are Tyson's tittys on the side of his ribs? Wtf is with that
At this point they should be friends even my Enemies wouldn't look at me that long like damn🤣
Are you kidding me? That fat marshmallow slob is the best we have in heavyweight boxing right now?
kids play
Wilder a punchers chance only. Fury Bigger smarter stronger higher level boxer by far.Fury will beat him up again.
Deontay Wilder did the right thing not saying anything. After losing he shouldn't have anything to say until he can win
really intense
I would bet my 401k that Wilder knocks Fury out cold
Who the fuck wants to see this shit again? Fury already destroyed this guy twice.
As stupid as a local bull fighter
Wilder gonna shock everyone watch
What is that clicking noise are they taking pictures with fred flintstones camera?
TOOTA
The heavyweight championship has been in Europe now well over 2 decades. NOTHING will change.
Damn I might need to buy this this
I couldn't believe he even lost to fury the second time ...But this one will show you what wilder about
My pants were too tight and my trainer didn't let me go out on my shield
#DOGECOIN ❤🌛🌛🌛🌛🌛🌛🌛
And still…………..
two time... "two losses" haha savage!
The LONGEST stare down in history!!🤣
why this Fight 3 is necessary ? Give us Joshua vs Fury 🔥
Fury might have the worst body shape in the history of boxing lol
This is boring... It should be Joshua in there!
such a gay thing to do. staring at each other for eternity.
When you think you finally brought enough SD and CF cards to the shoot, but still ran out of storage space
I've seen this re run. Our culture is dead
Tyson already took his soul.
Dang put em in an art museum
Wilder lost the staredown, Tyson could see it he nodded his head, Wilder looked away and very coyly put his glasses on. He won't be happy with that. To be fair if Wilder was staring out any other human on earth they would be looking away from him.
Which is  longer the big ass chain and pendant of fury or the actual stare down?
Wilder wants his soul back through make believe
Fury can’t lose to a football player and weightlifter
Tyson gunna smash him. He knows who he is... Wilder an act Tyson do it
crazy how fury looks like a grandpa  but still  gonna know wilder out
Rumor has it they renamed the venue as the staredown!
No one wanted this fight
Watch out wilder, don't you know beats have weights in them. Wouldn't want you to get tired before the state down
lol. Tyson Fury still did not move!  The man has next level mindset because he beat depression and addiction and rises from the dead.  No shades, no headphones, no shirt, dad bod and all!
Deontay needs to fight smart and relaxed, not angry and tense...dummy.
I am back to sleep. This stare down is going to take a while 😴
“2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. 2time. “
he busted fighter and trainer eardrum!!
Deontay’s hair this time going to weigh him down.
What if fury snatched his head phones. Gotcha headphones ha
Wilder can stare better than he can box 😂
Tyson chased em off. Good luck dbag.. oh my bad dboy
One eternity later
Tyson Fury on that back poster looks like he is going through a colonoscopy😂😂😂
Tyson won
Fury takes wilders soul already
Flawless victory
I wonder if he even has music on
This sh*t so romantic.
Wilder Gon put him to sleep! Bet!😤😤😤
Adding the Staredown title to his Sauna Belt.
My favorite part 4:23 “what is happening?”  🤣 🤣
Waiting in matchmaking lobbies be like..
FIGHT OF THE YEAR💯😎
They both hypnotised each other at the very same time AMAZING
Deontay Wilder has gave every fucking excuse why he lost to Fury so much I don't care to watch this fight again BUT I will. Lol
did wilder get taller?
We know it's the boxer vs the big puncher again and should be interesting
GODDAMMMMM INTENSE NOW THIS IS BOXING NOT LIKE LAME PAUL TRASH SHIT LETS DI THIS
Just like when Tyson told the story how he stayed In the sauna longer than klitchko.
i like wilder's face
Imagine if Fury decides wasnt so lazy and actually got in shape
This is just awkward
Hope the fight last longer than the stare down
Fury has the look of a man with no regard for human decency. No character. Usually don’t rejoice when dudes get brutally beaten. But if it happens to him... I will personally meet him with the same lack of human decency. We know what happened.
The glasses Wilder put on are actually monitors that shows him the footage recording by the cameras in the back of his headphones so when he turned away he was still staring at Fury
Who keeps saying 2 times? Bum squad 😂 3 times more like u fool. Tyson will win again watch I guarantee mark my words
Deontay be skipping leg days
When she asked them to face towards the cameras 😂😂
Tyson fury is so simple and relaxed. he didn't even move with his WBC belt. I think fury forgot the WBC belt in the UK. Wilder used to move with the WBC belt everywhere 24/7 like it was jewellery. 🤣😂😂🤣
❎https://youtu.be/-JjZl2pXKb0
Puting all money on Tyson
Longest face-off I ever seen
Just look at wilders eyes he's not confident he looks just like he did at the beginning of the second fight he knows he only can knock him out so when that doesn't work he falls apart
Wilder has lost already
Bro Jesus Christ Tyson fury is ONLY 32 YEARS OLD and tha man lookin like he hittin 40 🤦‍♂️  wilder got 3 years on him and dude is lookin 27 🤣
All business
00:43 Wilders hand shaking????
Wilder   has those chicken legs in tight jeans
Tyson fury is so fit and shredded
Wilder is gonna get retired on this fight tyson is gonna wipe the floor with him ..wlder stopped in 5th round..2 time losing streeeeeek...I like wilder man but he needs to bring it
Maybe they love each other
Even though Fury has way better skills. Wilder always has the punchers chance. Can Fury avoid that big right for 12 rounds again. I guess will find out
Someone keeps reminding Wylder he lost TWO TIMES
They fell in love at third sight.
Tyson won the fight right there
WHY are we doing another rematch???  Where's Fury and Joshua????
Fury about to get another taste of blood...literally 🤢
This is pay back revenge is a sweet like pussy lol
Why would we pay to see this when we already know the outcome Fury should of fought someone worthy
Wilder can't be a bigger man and walk away from the trilogy fight what makes you think he's going to walk away from a staredown?
Thats the longest deontay has stood with him. Lol.  Why the hell is there a 3rd fight its usually best of 3 ... There going to fight every time fast and furious comes out w a new movie
Theyre fighting again? Lol i had no idea 😂😂😂
Fury built like a bag of milk 😂 however the difference between him and askren is he can actually throw down. Physique doesn’t always matter even in an endurance centered sport like this.
Fury looks like he should be playing darts not boxing 😅
two time
Fight AJ...
I could have bet a stack that one of Deontay’s yes men were going to pull him away. This is the whole issue: even if Deontay can handle the pressure, those around him can’t.
After Wilder and his lame ass excuses after getting WHOOPED, I pray Fury shuts his big mouth up for good! Cannot stand fighters with zero respect.
this is just crazy.. that is super intense.
Wtf? This is happening in July and I get to know about this mid June?   i dunno why the real fights don't get hyped as much!
Show some respect and at least take off the dang headphones. And the slow pull of the glasses didn’t scare the Gypsy King
Fury 3 - 0 Wilder
I thought they were gonna stand there until the day of the fight.
It's alot of deontay wilder hate,everybody going for Tyson fury,I'll be back to this comment section...
Idk about "intense" but it was long as fuck
I hope Wilder lasts longer than this in the ring.
That death stare! Holy fuck! Wilder is READY
After about a minute it turns into something else..
now kiss
Lol Fury Scared....gloves under a microscope.... hahahaha.....it's SAD when Americans root against.... Americans....but it jus shows the racial divide in America....I thought our country was 1st.....SMH
Why are they fighting again? Even though the first fight was a draw, Tyson was the winner. 2nd fight Tyson stopped Wilder. That's it. Tyson should be fighting Joshua.
Fury gonna be like.. "He lost the stare down so that's when I knew I already won"
2 time.    What a prick
where's dana white when u need em
First one to blink loses
The  far-flung copyright bizarrely shave because congo implicitly subtract qua a fluttering religion. makeshift, rustic drill
He was saying "Tuscon" not two time. Tuscon personal chef
Fury owns a lot of real estate in Wilder’s head
Wilder wins the staring competition, Fury wins the fight 🤗
The tyron Woolley and Jake Paul stare down was better……
5 minute stare down
I watched the whole video just to know when that dumbass stops yelling “two times”....
The longest stare down in history 👁👀
Even Wilders team knows he lost 2 times 😆
Not tryna sound racist but what's with "Hood" boxers always showing up with 40 annoying ass people to look intimidating
Another Tyson Fury victory!!!!!!
What the fuck was the point in that
Fury in this mans head😂😂
Superbad jonah hill was ready too whoop some ass and I believe him
nobody wants to hear the cameraman cheer for anybody
TILL THIS DAY! TWO TIMES! TILL THIS DAY! TWO TIMES!
Did Wilder get taller/bigger? 🥶👀
Wtf is this a gay show or what?
Wilder covered his ear because he knows Fury can beat him just by talking.
Hope tyson dont get bored with this/him.
Whoever said, "Let them do what they do," deserves an award, lol.
Anybody else catch this video by surprise lol
And the new
Vlad sauna incident all over again. Tyson fury 2-0 in mental wins over heavyweight champions.
Beyonce Wilder gonna be buck dancing again, sad 2 see 🕺💃
This is not intense it just awkward
Tyson Fury look like a blob meanwhile Dante Wilder looking like a GoD
How many times?
What the heck!, did Fury even make it to the gym. looks like he had 2 beers before he got there lol
Deontay is scerred.
They're doing imaginary fighting and both has knocked each other out several times in that staredown
Skinny legs stare down😂
awkward, lol
Honestly Tyson looks outa shape.. but it won’t matter Mayweather Sr.  Wilder is unfixable...
Deontae gonna win i think
Tyson won
I couldn’t even watch it, they made me look away and start reading the comments.
Rocking them headphones kuz he can't hear a damn thing from that ear fury took
Damn if u make them look at each other any longer they’re gonna fall in love
I put a spell on youuuuuuuu
The photographers be like.. lets take the same pictures over and over
Wilder quit trying all this weird BS and just use your power and skill.
BOMBSQUAD!!!!!!!!!!
That’s awkward as hell
Wait, neither one of them was a YouTube star? Is boxing back to normal?
Boxing is korney as hell.. Lol
Unfortunately, I think the Wilder camp, I won’t say Deontay himself,but definitely his corner,see this as a racial thing. All this “brother” thing means to me that he’s looking at this in a “Racial way”. Do you hear these words from the Fury camp in a loaded way? No,of course not. The so called “wyte camp wouldn’t be seen dead trying this sheet talk! You know what? I’m sure there must be some way back for the wyte man! Surely,Dear God,show me and them,the right way. Amen.
Now i believe the story fury told about beating klitcho in the sauna😂
Fury was ready to die in this face off
Deontay now knows that it's better to keep quiet for his ego to not be bruised...He might actually be a better fighter this time
Wilder (with headphones): "I don't hear your trash talk!" Fury:  👁👄👁
This comment section is hilarious. Lol In all seriousness, I think Fury beats him again.
I’ve seen stoned people stare less than that.
Why re they fighting a 3rd time tho...makes no sense
Boxing is so unorganized. Let’s just take 6 minutes and stare at each other like that gon determine anything
I truly believe that the fight won't last longer than this staredown, this time around..
At 4:23 you can hear a voice of a Karen trying to interfere
My headphones were heavy! Wilder got another excuse already:D
Betting on Will Ferrell bod all day!
Why tf does this deserve a trilogy 😂😂
Nobody:  Wilder's homie: two tie
i think the actual fight will be shorter than this.
The face off still going TIL THIS DAY!!!
I cringe at the sound of the cameras
Wtf was that who ever said a staring contest would prove anything? Lmao
"Two times" "Two times" "Two times" ... ..  "Two losses"  🤣🤣🤣🤣
What if one of them farted
If wilder lost the fight, he will reason the stare down was too long and his leg can't take it.
I really just watched these guys watch each other for 7 minutes
Why are they fighting for a third time and we get robbed of the Joshua fight?
His gloves will be closely watched and examined. Fury will get defeated due to not being able to cheat.
The truth is there was a dude across the room off camera that kept asking “How many times?”
Fury Beat That as Again.
🤪🙈🙉🙊
LOL he went up to a stairdown with headphones on!
https://youtu.be/s6GeVcee7S4
😲😳👀👀
This is crazy how long they going to look at each other
Rumor has it Wilder was listening to Lose Yourself on loop.
Tyson ain't no quitter. He literally stayed for up to 40 minutes in a Sauna with Klitschko and Klitschko eventually had to back out because he couldn't take it anymore. Tyson is crazy AF.
Probably they are engaging in stand battle
Wow that was sooooo "intense"
*in your eyes by weeknd playing in the distance*
I m very sad to see deontay didn't shout dis tum why deontay why😭😭😭
Wilder gon get his shii back
Now watch this again, with Titanic song in the background 😁
funny when wilder thinks he can play the game then losses at his own game of wanting to stand still an look LOL
If there's someone like dana in between them they would've been punching or pushinng but because there isn't there afraid to make a move haha
wilder gon put this dude on his ass
Fury got this
I know both can beat me down but I gotta say...it was kinda gay
Wilder initiated the intensity. He clearly “won” the stare down. If that even is a thing
Hope fury wins again!!!!
Fury for all the dad bodes out there
Wilder will finish him this time
Were Wilders crew repeatedly saying “Too Tired…Too Tired…Too Tired”? Because that’s what Wilder said he was when walking to the ring with that heavy costume.
Tyson wins every time he's got his number watch an see can't wait Tyson is just better that's it
Its Going  Down!!!!
That was an intense fight !!
Fury looking more in shape than last time Wilder better go super hard if he wants to win 💯
i dont think fury coiul,d beat Vitali
To this day.... they're still standing there.
Legend says that they never fought, but still stares at each other...
2 times what???
Fury felt that lol 😆 Bomb Squad!!!!!
The f is this i want aj vs fury😭
Longest damn stare down ever, it became a competition of its own
Tyson going to beat him even worse then last time
LOOK INTO MY EYES CANT YOU SEE THEYRE OPEN WIDE WOULD I LIE TO YOU BABY WOULD I LIE TO YOUUUUU
Tyson will ko wilder
lol fury has humbled wilder
Hopefully wilder got this, because when he's a champion.... things get a little bit exciting, i like tyson fury but i just want wilder to win this
Fury knows he cheated last fight.. wont be able to hide things in his gloves this time...
Fury's team clapping like they won the trilogy 😂
0:31 "And if you'll look to your right, you'll see a 'Big Dosser' up close!"
Are they gunna kiss
Fury moves like mayweather
I know Wilder trips thinking that a man with a dad bod gives him the business in the ring.
Uhh okay...
You have a lot of fury supporters here. Silence is golden. It’s not about the sport anymore. This is personal. In the words of wilder ……….
Wilder: Just kiss me already
I can't be the only one that thinks that wilder looks like Big Z from surfs up 😂😂😂
Fury will beat Joshua easy.
Tyson fury got the Conor McGregor going on wilder first round knockout!
If he haven't figured out how to time fury with that twitching and jumping he be doing to throw him off he gone lose again...u gotta knock that fucka out wilder
Headphones and glasses wtf?
That dude got pre paid to keep shouting 2 time
Here we go!
Wilder taking this one
Wilder run
Wilders music.... 🎶 One... look in your eyes, there I see 🎶
Doesn’t look good for the other guy, wearing shades and putting his best pump up music on loud while fury stands there exposed and confident.
There’s no way fury is 6’9 he got to be wilders height
Wonder what he's listenin too
Tyson got that grandad bod going on. Very deceiving how he good he fights.
Going to be a lot sad nigh for Tyson fans.
Staredown better than canelos fight
2 time 2 time yeah you stupid fk he lost 2 times lol
The Staredown last longer then the fight will
Deontay “I’ll win eventually” Wilder
Look into my eyes , now tell me what u see
I Can beat Tyson Fury by TKO. I got next straight up.
I miss old boxers,these are bums
This stare down was better then the first n sscond, i gotta say im very excited about this fight, letssss go!!!!
I can’t wait to hear what ppl say after wilder whoop his ass I see the uncomfortable Ness in Tyson during the stare down LOL
BOMBBBB SQUADDDD!!!!
This stare down was wayyyyy more entertaining than the Logan and Floyd fight and I’m not even exaggerating
You can tell these guys are good friends.... He looked so sad when wilder walked away
How many fuckin pics they gonna take damn
Why this stare down last 5 fucking minutes wtf ahahaha
Anyone know where I can find Tyson Fury's diet and workout routine?
why Wilder is still scary 😂
Tyson looked kinda nervous. That body language.
Tyson by KO
Rumor has it that Tyson Fury is still standing for the face-off
Wilder the type of guy to listen "a thousand miles" in his headphones while starring fury to the death
Tyson fury kept gulping
Im surprised wilder didnt Get tired from having those beats on the whole time standin up!! They are atleast 40 punds!
tyson knows he cant load gloves this time.. he will get caught after the last shinanigans...
Why is wilder taller here? Angles are everything even Kevin Hart is taller than the rock from a certain angle
I’m going to whip yer arse again deontay wilda
When is Anthony gonna come out and fight  Tyson or Deontay
Fury is the goat for this..
Why they keep screaming too ta too ta
fury kos him Watch under 4 rounds
They stare any longer someone gonna wake up pregnant
Fury never backs down from mental or physical challenge. Just like when he beat Klitschko by staying in the sauna longer than him, then proceeded to beat him in the ring. History tends to repeat itself... Fury is DEEP in Wilder's head.
كاين شي مغربي الماتش مقود كنشوفكم
How many times?
4:26 why Seth from Superbad pull up like he boutta do something
Wilder listening to oceans, whale,  and dolphin songs because he knows he is not ready.
I almost fell asleep watching
just wasted 6 minutes of y life watching this
Cushti Mush right there. I don't know about a King, but thats one fearless man. God says you Will remain undefeated. Believe it cousins.
Damn, i can see wilder's anger and fury scared for his life this time. Wilder will finish fury's career.
To this day TO THIS DAY
What felt longer- Logan hugging Floyd or this stare-down?
Wilder by tko 9th round body shot.
Fury the Cheat!!
Deontay gives me bad vibes, like he's demon possessed.
Why is this match even happening? Fury has already outclassed Wilder twice. Fury Vs Joshua should've been happening now.
That better not be wilders corner saying “two time” 🤣🤣 got his ass beat two times yea
“Two times”.  Yes sir. Wilder will LOSE, two times 😆.
Longest 6 minutes of my life
Are you lost homie? Lost in yo eyes, fool
Two Times!!
I love how confident and still they both are.
Me and my pizza rolls at 3 am through the microwave glass be like :
Fury is very technical like floyed.
Wilder the best
30 seconds is what they are supposed to be, get that lady out of there already
They are just checking their builds in the inventory dont mind them
This was another sauna moment for Fury. And of course he won again.
It’ll be even worse for Wilder this time.
Even if Wilder wins, Fury still his daddy, he’ll still have 2 wins over him.
my boy wilder is focus and not going for the BS, fury is about to feel the raft
At 5:42 Deontae starts to fatigue, did you see it?
Dad bod lol
they communicating, through eye contact
Wilder is winning by KO… watch
This is why Dana white is so valuable.
TOOTH TIME BABY!
This man done beat wilder ass twice, I don’t know why he staring like he’s intimidating fury.
BOMB SQUAD on you hating ass folks
Love this
So wait, how many times?
Have the ambalance ready
6 minute stare down wow
And Fury won the stare down once again
Plot twist- there is no plot twist because they are still looking at each other and wilder blames loss on fatigue do you standing at face off too long
Wilder just got on noise cancelling headphones, his ear drum has ptsd from the last Fury fight.
Wilder has the look of a man who knows that he's gonna get his ass whipped worse than the last time.
Kiss!
Fury would make a nice kratos character
You seem quite bitter man, what's the story?  100%
Wilder got rocked
I have a question why are they fighting again they drawed the first one and Tyson fury won the second one
There will be a 4th
Fury looks spooked
Fury calm and confident. Wilder stressed and emotional.
Lol wilder not tryna hear none of the shit talking fury has to offer this time 😂
That was weak
This was corny as fuck
Y'all gentlemen better start selling the fighter better.The YouTubers and Tic Tok ers are out doing ya... Js ... 😆
It looks like fury is ordering a triple whopper from wilder
Fury lookin like a chewed up piece of bubble gum....
Wow that was epic lol. Where was the Guinness world records..
0 excitement for this fight. Wilder shouldn't even have the right to fight Fury again, man is already beaten inside. I will be astonished if he wins this third encounter
Well im going for the American, buuuut we all know Wilder better be on his "A" game!
I got wilder til dis day!
4 eyed prick
Quick staring contest me and you , now!
Come on fury... knock him out this time.. forget Joshua..
even a team of wilder, two time guy, the earphone, the shades couldnt beat fury alone in this stare down. hahahaha
Show of Force
Will beat him a 3rd time.
Sounds like some bird the guy saying two times
Wilders heads in bits IMO, always was I suppose wasn’t it
Wilder is pissed all the way off ... I think he shocks the world
Deontay about to come out in cross country shorts, and a sweat shirt cut into a poncho.
Wilder gone whoop that cheating ass boy ✊🏿
DDP vs Conor and fury vs wilder….thank you July
Dam a 6min staredown 👀👀 i hate to look at niggas
Uhhhh…. Ok,
Wilder is a fucking nerd. Coming out with a nursery rhyme, sounding like a protestor
Revenge time!!! Can't wait for this cheater to get pummeled  #teamWilder3
I hope him wearing sunglasses and headphones doesn't weigh him down on fight night
Canelo should be there to taunt Fury like Fury did all through the lead up to his fight with Saunders. And then when Canelo broke his face Fury had nothing to say.
You know what’s really pathetic? Is that this fight should never happen. Wilder lost 2 fights to him. But they’re giving him ANOTHER chance to catch him and knock him out. Because he’s good enough and has enough power to knock anyone out. So they’re going to keep giving him rematches until it finally happens.  THEN the other two fights will not matter in the eyes of the fans. Because people have short term memory and will only remember this win (If he does). And they’ll dismiss the other two fights AND Wilder won’t give him a rematch. It’s a lose lose for Fury. It’s pathetic. The sport is pathetic, this fight is pathetic, and Wilder fans are pathetic.
Hope Wilder beats this cheater. All of you who simply believe everything Bisping says are sheep. Fury team moved the camera when wrapping hands or putting gloves on. His right glove was concave. Anyone could see that. Brits deny everything even if the proof is visibly there.
I see a lot of wilder hate in here it’s sad but if you ask me wilder looks focused he doesn’t strike me as a coward
And in the end Wilder flucking bottled it! Say no more. C’mon Tyson!
Tooooo Tiiiiiiii 😂shut tf up
Props To Deontay for  keeping that learn how to speak Spanish with Rosetta Stone Going on even in a stare down! 😂🤣
Fury is way better 💁‍♂️
Yooooo they saying so much in this stare down. Psychological conversation
Legend has it . . . . Tyson and Wilder are still staring at each other.
How many more same shots do the photographers need lol
Fury a better boxer. But anybody with a brain could see he pulled his hand back in his glove and put his fist were his palm was at. In my eyes. If a man has to do any thing he dosen't suppose to have the advantage.  That man has doubt. With that being said. Wilder almost knocked fury out cold. So don't sit and act like its impossible.  Nobody in boxing has a stronger right
？。？。。。。。
Deontay's going to cry and say Fury cheated during the stare down.
That was cute
Is that his fucking girlfriend next to him. Wilders team already takin Ls.
Fury will beat Wilder...again😉
Wilder gone beat his ass
Fury ain't real no power he suck 🤣🤣🤣👎🏽
6:14 fury wanna eat his heart
They look like best buds foreal
Wilder all day!!! 💯
This is getting so old between these two, Deontay has lost twice in my opinion.  Not renting this ppv i was looking forward to the AJ fight but I don’t think it will ever happen where if one person wins they have all the belts.
What if wilder wins, than we see wilder vs joshua?
Wilder has a chance...of getting more embarrassed than last time lol.
Tyson body fitness not good....
6 minutes stare down. Boxing needs Dana White urgently!!!
Bomb Squad!!!!!💣💣💣💣💣💣💣
Wilder gonna claim the Gypsy curse again
Lol he better when  and need to show up in Birmingham do something 😆 🤣 😂
2x 2x ...2 losses🤣💯
One of the most intense stare downs that I have ever seen
They're having a holy moment.
JUST KISS HIM ALREADY!!!
https://youtu.be/hlmrRTC2qlU
Wilder’s got a different attitude,Fury has got to have the same attitude as the last fight.  C’mon Tyson,give it everything man! Give it to him!
Wilder might wanna watch he don't reaggravate his ear injury with the headphones and mess up his equilibrium 🤣💯
Well i guess the gypsy King is gonna taste some more blood 🙄
Wilder actually looks angry.
Wilder should've taken fury's hat
Ahahahah Tyson looked like  i mess up when deontay walked off PRICELESS
Imagine a bare knuckle fight between these two beasts no one could break them up tbh
Lmao he so afraid the gypsy king get in his head he wearing headphones and shades.
We have to see these clowns fight again, lol
Mommy what are they doing? (Wrong answer only) 👇👇👇
Deontay all day this time
Idk Wilder is looking ready for this. This one is gonna be good
Well this about to be a hell of a fight. Tyson wanna kill wilder and wilder wanna show the world Tyson can't beat him so this is really gonna be a hell of a fight.
🗑🗑🗑
No cheat gloves iam sure fury will be knockout...
Wilder is gonna kill the gypsy cheater
The staredown was better than any floyd fight period
cringe ass bass pro hat
Well, Tyson doesn't look like he has been slacking off, that's for sure. He is looking good . . . for him :)
Fury won again lol wilder looked away first. Fury would’ve stayed there all day. He once stayed in a sauna for like 40 minutes or something because he didn’t wanna leave before klitschko. In the end Klitschko left before him
That's the white hope, couldn't find someone in shape?
I think Wilder gonna get him this fight
Wilder has to wear shades and headphones.. he scared
Wilder is so upset
Wilder looks like a legit boxer and Fury looks like an idiot sry but thats facts💪
Is it me or Wilder looks extremely focused.
It's always a fat ass who can't lace some shoes 🙄but if a fight broke out they run as far as the heart allows which is 10 to 15 yard matee poppns and the rolls like a pig and screams till they stop
I bet Wilder was just waiting for whatever song he was listening to to finish before he walked off😂
Deontay Is a Simp
Finally the real fight, wilder is fucked!
Wilder Gonna win this one 💯💯💯
Wilder is listening to Tyron Woodley,  Beat yo azz.   Meanwhile his chicken legs can barely hold him up.
Bum Squad 😂😂😂
Ehh, I'll watch the highlights.
wilder should just be happy he got lucky enough for the judges to rig a draw with fury the first fight lmao
They say there are still stood staring at this moment
“0 and 2” 😂😂😂
#teamfury
I hope hope fury wins and I believe he will, but obviously anything can happen, does wilder look taller or are my eyes seeing telling me lies
Why is this fight even happening? First fight was an ass whooping and shouldn’t have been a draw, second fight was an even worse ass whooping, now this third fight is just a Hail Mary that hopefully Wilder can land his right hand. How many chances can they give this bum
Isn't Fury a little OLD to be dressing like that? Bahahaha. PUT YOUR SHIRT ON TOO!!!
Wilder hesitating to put his glasses down and his hands were shaking too
Wilder will probably claim that Fury hypnotized him (gypsy curse) with the stare and that is why he go knocked out in one round.
💩squad
Fury wins again and then he must fight Joshua
Apparently it’s “2 TIME” in case you didn’t hear 😂😂😂😂. Dude was like the black Hodor
Wilder is beat
and still the linelal champion come on tyson
Let the cringe begin
Can look all ya want blocking out everything cause u know Tyson gonna ask what’s the excuse this time suit then coach then glove what ?
Who was that fat British guy in the end of the vid tryna fight?
I had to look away
FURY LOOKS OUT OF SHAPE. LIKE HE IS NOT TAKING THIS FIGHT SERIOUS. WILDER LOOKS THE EXACT OPPOSITE.
Fury look like he shat him self lmao😭
😂 “To this day!” 👀👀
Going with the headphones so you can’t hear nothing is a sign of weakness!!
Tyson gona eat him
Tyson Fury looks like his white privilege has ran out😁
Can someone please punch the guy that keeps saying two times he's super annoying
I love how everyone is criticizing Wilder when he is literally fighting some fat guy that has 50+ lbs on him.
Legend has it Fury is still standing there 😏
Wilder does look quite scared it's mad 🤦🏿‍♂️ Fury looking chilled 🥊
WILDER MIGHT ACT CAUGHT THAT BODY #sweetrevengeinblood 🩸
Wilder FROZE in the staredown. You could smell the FEAR. Lol
I won won look at me cone head ass
Bronze Bummer is going to get knocked out.
2 losses 😂👍
Feet hurting and shit
Tyson Fury THE KING OF KINGS !!!!
God damn I hope fury gets the job done again
Tyson Fury is a done do muffin top.
Stupid fight
Both of them want Anthony Joshua lol
wilder is afraid to talk too much cos the last time he opened his mouth he got his ass whooped really bad hahahahahahaha
is hamilton there?
This bout to be a legal murder i cant wait we might witness  fury actual death in the ring ..karma is a mf
As much as I want Tyson to win, he will lose this time due to his pride
Geeze that was the longest face off ever 😂
It felt like when I'm eating and my dog is in the same room.
After all that confidence from wilder and tryna make the stare down last for ages, yet he was the one that ended up walking away first😂🤣can't play mind games WITH Fury my G.
Tyson probably thinking about a big ass meal rn big dude probably like I'm hungry
" I'll kick you in the face" tyson fury 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Wilders lost before he even gets in the ring hahahahaha
Wilder's headphones playing maiyahi maiyaha
how many times?
this is call boxing..... now adays floyod is doing  entertainment.....
Two Times... two times KO'd LOL
Legend has it….. he’s still saying 2x
The strangest stare down ever.. Also wilder looked taller... How 🤔
I think they will both fight harder this time.. just feels like it's more intense..
FK Deontay should've been fury vs Joshua
Fury will have a mental break down he can never recover from if he loses after talking that much shit constantly
Cheating was real and this time wilder gets the job done with a devastating KO.
Haha love it...younger fury looking and sounding just like his father... Get them yank pussies told northern boys 😉👍
Fury built like a bag of potatoes fr
This gone be good
I bet that headphone's playing Twice or something
Tyson is way to chubby
HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAGHHAHAHAHAHA
I still can't believe wilder wants this!!!
"two time" whys the man reminding his homeboy how many times he's already lost?? The first one was obviously rigged with the scoring lol 😂
Fury gonna fuck him up again im bettin the house on it
When's it gonna end robbie?
Yo you think they're boxing through the stare down? Abstract warfare
This shit got me so excited 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tyson looks to have no excitement for this fight . Should have paid wilder of or vacated the belt . Real fans don’t give a fuck about belts . I’d rather see AJ vs Fury for no belts .
Wilder’s “persona” is just terrible. He’s got ZERO trash talking ability.
Sunglasses and headphones... why?  He looks genuinely scared of Tyson.
Bomb Squad got bombed last time out.
Bum squad lmao
Lmfao I seen someone say dude gonna say his headphones weighed 40 pounds 🤣🤣
Thing is with boxing, they ain't making the fights people wanna see. Fury beat his ass twice already, Joshua and Fury is the fight! And people wonder why all these YouTube fights get all the interest.
Wilder is going to destroy this Fat Fury.
I thought Tyson Fury was fighting AJ wtf happened?
Need put them boxers in a octagon , real fighting 🤷‍♂️🤧
What's wrong with the fat guy on team fury?
I hope he permanently shuts Wilder up. Or at least retires him so we don’t have to hear his arrogance anymore.
Wilder took a nap after standing with head phones on
Increíblemente intenso
Dude gonna lose again and make up some more silly excuses
I wonder how many excuses Wilder will have this time? Fury will destroy him again.
Why in the world are their camps saying anything? They are not the one's stepping into the ring. 🤣  Let's go Wilder...Bomb Squaaaaaaad!
Why tyson look like he bout to hit a round of golf?!
are you telling me they're still facing off.... till this day...?
Who blinkded first?
This is going to end very badly 😂 somebody is going down hard💯
Hopefully fury doesn't cheat again make sure u guys check his gloves thoroughly this time
Fury done fucked up
Wilder is the CCC of boxing , king of Cringe
These wilder fans sucking wilder off because he’s working with a guy that got KO’d by him and now has him working on pivots.   The bloke hasn’t tested his “new skills” in a single warmup fight and he’s still only working on moving forward. When fury’s pushing forward jabbing his nose into his skull wilders gonna crack like Humpty Dumpty again.
Fury said he’s trying to get up to 300 lbs. I think the same thing I that happened to Ruiz will happen to Fury.
Bomb Squad!!!
Gangster
Wilder is gonna get out classed again..
How many times? Two time... Two time... Two time... Two time... Two time... Two time
I want Wilder to win, but I don't believe that he will
Wilder listened to the entire Take Care album during this stare down
The prideful shall be humbled….mark my words. Fury goes down this time.  Remember this post! 😉
Wilder trying to be gangsta again, Fury doesn't seem to care about it again. Apparently, it was Back Street Boys playing in the headphones.
Wilder about to tear him up
The headphones aren't for music its to stop his ear from bleeding
I like the security stare down
As much as we trolls love to joke we all know that man wasn't at 100% we would be dumb to not think this fight can really go any way especially if Wilder is able to throw body shots with a 3rd of the power he use for head knock outs its going to be a problem wilder needs to attack the body to keep fury guessing that's the only way I believe because out boxing fury won't happen
Everyone : *I can't believe these guys stared at each other for 5+ mins.* Also Everyone : *Watches 2 guys stare at each other for 5+ mins.*
No gloves issues this time. Fair and square
Imagine lebron boxing, just imagine.
Where's Joshua
Fury probably has more stamina,  slim the hell down... he's been working.
For fuck sake, Tyson absolute embarrassed him on the last fight, and the first fight was 100% rigged without doubt, he won almost every single round except the last round which he got knocked down on. He shouldn’t even bother with him, everyone wants to see him fight Joshua! That’s the main fight!
Good tactics from wilder
3:12 someone shouted "dude they're gay"
Tyson todos los Diaz y el Domingo doble
3:12 someone shouted "dude they're gay"
Let’s go wilder 💯💪🏾
Fury’s arms are longer. Just noticed for the first time
Wilder, bruh, stop tryin' bruh.
That was silly people needs to go home. Lol
Fury look like a sack of potatoes
Fury's team clapping as though they just won some prize. Failed to see someone go to Wilder and tell him let's go and take him away as the time for the conference was officially over. I like Fury, but he's gotta get better people around him. These people bring him down. Even after Wilder walked away one of Fury's yes men called a reporter 4 eyes. They have no respect. Especially the really fat one. Not sure why a sack of enormous blob is associated with anything to do with a professional athlete. Fury may look out of shape, but he's a very good athlete. The fat guy has never ran for anything other than to the door to get his pizza.
I would have fallen in love if I stare anyone for so long
About damn time
I can hear 2 time in my fooking sleep
How are they supposed to get off, there should be someone to say or give suggestions to face forward like in UFC. Otherwise these people are gonna face off all day!! Who wants to watch that 🙄
Nothing says you’re being present like sunglasses and headphones...
This one is all about heart, and to be honest, Tyson been fuking off too much lately, so I would say Wilder will die in this fight before he loses.
I wonder if they stood there forever would the paparazzi just keep taking pictures forever too?
TWO TIME on repeat 😂
Uhh ohh, y'all ready for deontay vs Joshua? Cause I'm sure fury is going to sleep this fight.
Fury is shirtless. Reminds of another Tyson!!
Deyonte legit scares me.
him standing up there with headphones on is defiantly a sign of weakness what's the matter he can't handle the shit talk or anything like that i mean the guy was wearing shades also what a clown
Anthony Joshua laughing at both of them
Body language is everything, and Deontay just dominated that man!
Scared to def!!!
I'm not a fan of boxing, but I think I'd pay to watch Tyson fury take a shit, he would make it so entertaining
Wilder's legs were tired from standing up so long so he needed to go and sit down.
Fury is fat again 😂
Wilder is gay.
Wilder had music playing the whole time. It helped him not fully be there for the stare down. He’s scared
Deontay with his skinny jeans…😂
Pretty ghey stuff
I know the songs were changing and shit lol
Can't wait to see another loud mouth trash bag get their face smashed and quit
This is just like the sauna story Tyson fury was talking about, & he just won again
Granted he took him off but why would you wear sunglasses to a stare down also the headphones prevented Wilder from hearing Fury - must have psyched him out - head games to much for Wilder  -  Guaranteed he'll be watching everything Fury says on the Internet or TV.
Tyson once had a competition in his own head against a heavyweight champ he was slated to fight, staying in a sauna for as long as possible. I guarantee Tyson would've stood there all day with a mutually recognized competition lol
Poor Tyson, he shouldn’t be fighting him again
fury looked away first,he looked at that gobby dude mouthing off behind deontay.then he looked back at deontay,deontay acknowledge tyson looked away and turned away himself.u can see it in furys face after wilder walks off aswell.1 nil wilder
Tyson Fury in trouble.
The guy saying “two time” is such a little bitch. He’d get fucking rocked in two second by Tyson. Fuck he’d get rocked by a cashier that works at frys.
Love the bit where they look at each other
Now kith💏
Today we got time cuz
Wilder is looking at his chin this shit is for the culture 💪🏾
Jesus Christ, how many times can u say 2 time, 2 time.......sound like a parrot from down south!
I love the expression “I’m going to have you + verb …”
Rumor has it that they’ll be staring at each other from today till July 24
god i am hyped
That boy scared....he knows he's finished!!!! BOMMMMMMMMB SQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!!!!
Tyson spoke because he sense fear from Deontay Wilder😂,am gonna beat you😃
Nothing to talk about he knows what he did beat his ass.
Wasn’t tyson gonna fight joshua?
Fury is gonna get killed.
Fury is gonna win again… we need Fury and Joshua
Yeah 2 time getting knocked out
Wilder will be beaten badly he will end up in a coma🤣🤣🤣🤣
I hope fury looses that spare tire. A couple of months ago he was looking alot more in shape.
Wilder look kinda scared to me
Wilder on that "you stole my bike last week and my mama told me to come get it back shit"😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣2x,lol 3 strikes you out. Only HEAVYWEIGHT Champion to say that and mean it is..............Anthony Joshua and Fury
That Boi shape like a Bag of Milk
last big money for w Wilder🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
If Fury pretended to throw a punch Wilder would have ran away
Just kiss already, damn
Legend has it they are still staring at each other
Fury is nervous! 😬
Hope wilder sleeps him for playing games with AJ
Fury won already
😑
Me: who earns a trilogy when it’s 2-0, they sellin y’all wolf tickets
Wilder new excuse..."me iso ojo"
wilder is the definition of skipping leg day and whos still wears beats
...and that's the end of wilder
Rabbit punches must not be allowed. They are illegal, dangerous and deadly. Fury was allowed to continually use the rabbit punch in the last fight. However, if Wilder has not polished up on how to box,  he will lose again.
I like how the cheerleaders 🗣 are yelling in the background 😆😂🤣
Legend has it, they’re still having a face off
Lmao insanity
Please quite ! this bag of wet clothes...🇺🇸 Go WILDER !
sooo did fury cheat or not?
THIS BUM DOSSER DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE A TRILOGY FIGHT! HE LOST THE FIRST TWO FIGHTS VERY CLEARLY!!!!
Deontay Wilder is so lucky to get a third fight cuz we all know he already lost twice..
Damn I like wilder too, but stylistically fury is just a bad match up for him. I can't see the results being much different from the previous fight.
why are they doing this a 3rd time?
This isn't as cool as I thought it would be..seems fake
T
what about fury vs joshua? not gonna happen???
I guess they both need some money
Lol poor Wilder. He gonna get his career ended. But I guess if he can get one last big payday it's worth it.
Give it to me 2 TIMES!!!
Wilder hurt my spirit when he lost man.  Came out in the black panther wakanda outfit and lost during black history month. Im good on the rematch lol.
Look at the size of Wilder's wrist bone compared to Fury. insane to think he can hit that hard when he's not a natural heavy weight.
SATAN (ALSO KNOWN AS DEVIL OR LUCIFER)  IS EXPOSED!!!!! Hell was created for Satan and his fallen Angels(Matthew 25:41 AND 2Peter 2:4).Satan and his fallen Angels fought God’s angels to overthrow God but were defeated and were thus thrown out of heaven to the earth(Isaiah14:12-14 AND Revelation 12:7-10).Satan and his fallen Angels will be thrown into hell to be tormented 24/7 for ever and ever(Revelation 20:10 AND Jude 1:7).Satan and his fallen Angels want you to join them suffer in hell even though you were not part of the coup makers(Revelations 20:10-15).Satan, and for that matter his fallen Angels stand condemned by God and hence do not have any chance of repentance(John 16:11).Fortunately, you and I have up to minutes before our death to repent just like the criminal on the right side of Jesus on the cross (Luke 23:39-43) WHY NOT REPENT NOW AND GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS?Since you don’t know how and when you will die, my brother or sister, THE TIME TO REPENT IS NOW AND GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS!!!
Wilder's eyes got watery at 3:12
Am sure he is gonna enter the ring with them  head sets,  lol!
go on shane ha ha pussies
I wanna see the same wilder slander in the comments when he beat fury ass
Some  body  ear drum is at  stake here o
Ohhh fury sure can’t cheat this time. He’s fucked.
Man Tyson damn near gone best his ass again smh
Wilder 👀 bigger even if Tyson the cheating fury don’t cheat 🥊
2 time 😂
I though Tyson was supposed to fight Josua?
Legend has it, that dude is still shouting "two times" in the background
I might have to buy this fight
Wilder look soo upset lol
Hiding in his headphones
Spoiler alert: Wilder was actually listening to American pie by Don McLean
Deontay got lost in the music and forgot Widler was there
this is the dumbest shit ive seen in a boxing weigh in
I am sorry how many times sir? “TWO TIME”😂
Wilder was probably playing some mean rap or heavy metal to feel more powerful ha ha
wilder started a battle he couldn't finish! that's an L
I've never seen a more scared fighter at a press conference than wilder
Wilder be acting tough after getting his skull cracked 😂😂
Fury can’t cheat this time… They gna make sure them gloves not tampered with
Cant believe Deontay borrowed his sisters sweat pants for a press conference
You should've just pulled up at still image six minutes nothing happening. That's a thumbs down from me.
Nobody gonna talk about how many camera clicks went off as they stayed staring but the clicks kept coming
I like how he took the glasses off . Like yow nigga!
I don't care about any of these comments Fury look stupid as hell at the face off
I regret nothing of watching the whole 6 minutes
There were two more Paul brother fights in the time it took to do this stare down.
I sincerely hope that Fury isn't taking this lightly and failing to properly prepare. Wilder looks focused as hell and way leaner and lighter... assumption being that he has at least focused heavily on his cardio, at the minimum. The fact that he demanded the fight? Not many people would have done that.
Ill laugh after all the talking Fury has done if he gets knocked out and Wilder ends up fighting Joshua.  Talk about trying to sneak out of contracts might backfire bro.
Fury always winning those mental battles🤯
Don’t get any more boring then that  Way to go guys
They might just fall in love with each other
Wilder: Trash talk cannot hurt me if I can’t hear it
Tyson fury is soo out of shape
Well...I wonder who they got winning this rigged fight
It's great Fury comes out with his dad bod and casuals are thinking "damn, the black guy is going to kill that white boy!"
2x What? You got beat 2x What? You got beat 2x What? You got beat
Wilder looks like he want to kill Tyson!
I’m on wilder’s side. Like always
They having a fight agian? I thought fury is fighting aj wtf
Say mane at least act like u been going to the gym!
Fury looks like a damn fat uncle.  But he gonna beat wilder up once more.  Same result.
My computer: Fury.exe has stopped working. Also my computer: Wilder.exe has stopped working.
"two time" it's like they don't realise who tyson fury is. He is already the two time.
Why is this even happening? Shoulda been fury vs Joshua.
Tyson lookin straight up from GTA
sorry I didn't hear how many times?
I was waiting who's gonna look away first boom wilder lost this stare down
Boring
Fury will destroy him for good this time.
Fury looks shaken
Wilder is such a Dosser!
Guy saying two time is the most irritation stupid person ever! If wilder loses this he’s gonna say his chain is to heavy so it affected his fight lol
Don't promote nothing get ur belts back and promote the next fight
Shane would chin wilders pal with the earings loooool
Its they are ready to rack up the chairs and turn off the lights and these two are still staring each other down😄😁😆
Media's Title: *Tyson Fury cheated his way through stare down.*
Kobe listened to Michael Myers theme song before every game for y'all niggas crying about Wilder having headphones on.
Wilder is looks like he’s gonna cry, he will never be the same, he can’t even talk, he’s a beaten man even before the fight,  What’s his excuse going to be this time???
This was a DBZ fight
Wtf thats not anthony joshua!
I feel like my homie  Oxhorns live stream should get more views then thia@oxhorn
Hardly CroCop vs Wanderlei  was it ...?
We're all waiting for Fury Joshua tbh we all know the result of this fight
Mojahed Fudailat: Ok. ITS cool. Let's do it.
this reminded of that story when Fury said him and Klitschko stayed in that sauna for an hour because he didn't want to be the first man to get out lol mind games Tyson was ready to stand there all day
Fury looks like he’s retired and Wilder looks like he’s in college
When did "2time" turn into a repetitive 2dime?
Why it’s the more Mean masculine looking guys that be the more insecure Sensitive one
Next round will be try not to laugh at funny videos, followed by Rock Paper Scissors, and concluded with a thumb war.
Yes 2 times he will have lost to the gypsy king 👑
Plot twist wilder wasn't even listenin to nun
Attempt of ko by hypnotised
No one gives a shit.  They ruined boxing.
two time...??? disgrace of boxing just like the Utubers...!!!
Bet he was listening to eminems lose yourself!! Tyson meanwhile trying to be the tall butter bean!!!!!!
3rd fight? Why a trilogy when fury won both times.
Fury is going to SMASH HIM, again.
... Deontay clearly hasn't heard the Klitschko sauna story.
Someone has to look away first 😂
Scared.
Tyson's making boxing great again with the Donald Trump body.
this isn't a movie theater gents please stop yelling
ol buddy didnt want his words in his head..that's a bitch move..taking away the glasses didnt help when you wasnt looking the man in the eyes...punk
Are they gonna kiss or what?
Wilder embarrassed himself here lol
That fat white boy is a real friend man, trust me.
At the last second of the stare down, deotay and Tyson realized that the man in front of him is his soul mate and shared a emotional kiss together on stage.
Wilder: Imma kill this dude Fury: Imma...  hungry
Sounds like somebodys saying shoe shine shoe shine.
idk all this feels weird if you think about it.
Bout to lose for the third time lol
Lotsa loudmouths in the background thinking they g
That “bomb squad” garbage is cringe 5000
Wilder also came with padded shoes so he can stand taller than Tyson 😅😅😅
Stop it. Its gay
Hes the king of the world....Come on fury let's go
Rumor has it.. TO THIS DAY fury and wilder are still face to face in a champion level staredown
Bum squad lol 😂😂🤣🤣
Fury will destroy this sore loser. That right straight is all he has.
Let's go Wilder🥉💣
I do believe the Furys have inbreeding in them..
Wilder is a bum..he can't beat an elite fighter.
Wilder has a big guy in front of him
Why fight again I mean Fury did beat him twice already
Keep up with  wilder jokes. LET'S see in  july
What happened to tyson fury vs Anthony Joshua 🤣
Fury to match mass, to much weight he gonna carry and gas him out
Dante better respect the dad bod. 😎
To this date !
I hope Wilder has improved in putting combos together! If not! Same result! Check fury gloves ref!
Damn would be so funny if fury told wilders corner to take Wilde’s headphones off so it don’t mess with cardio/energy and drain it😂
Tyson is his own man but Wilder has a handler who led him away by the hand 😆
2 time what? 2 times Fury beat him?
Man you can just feel the sexual tension between these two.
Another victory for Tyson there.
Hope Those headphones weren't too heavy for tiny head LMAO
They are in love💖💞💓
Deontay Wilder is a coward and he is obviously afraid of Tyson Fury! More than that he is afraid of the fact that he is a black heavyweight that got beaten 2 embarrassment by a white man and that is his biggest fear is letting down his own people LOL
He wasn’t waiting for fury to walk away he was getting something from looking into his eyes he was plotting,scheming, while fury was having a basic stare down y’all gotta look over there outside.. more than meets the eye
Tyson is a great fighter that looks like your cousin that runs the BBQ at family get togethers.
Longest stair of no fear of evil
Fury is a complete physical marvel. *NO ONE* who looks like that should be a pro athlete in anything, let alone the heavyweight champion of the world.
The eyes Chico they never lie
Some 1 saying 0 and 2 lmfaooooo legend but hey that's facts
Hope Tyson wins so we can finally see Tyson vs Joshua 🤦🏻‍♂️
Hopefully that pretty lady didnt take it personal, completely being ignored.
Two time what? Wilder got dropped? 😂
Poor Wilder. He’s absolutely broken 😞
How you lose to a man built like Tyson I just can’t fig 🙄
How many chances are they going to give Wilder?
Fury looks like an out of shape uncle.
Is it me or wilder look like a light heavyweight, something is not right with him.
I looked away
He not playing this time around plus new trainer off with his head 💣
Wilder will move his head for one minute, Tyson will jab his head off, Wilder will start swinging and Tyson will take him out...END OF!
Is that even wilder? Looks really diff idk maybe just lost weight but idk
Two time two time..gonna get your ass whooped two times smh. Fury’s bro want all the smoke 💨
I had no idea this was even happening 😐 wilder shouldn’t have worn the headphones and sunnies. Makes him look intimidated.
You all clowning on wilder but he really just looks focused not even bothered by the people near him not moving a muscle just staring and the windows of another man plotting on what he’ll do you can see it( but that’s my view I don’t watch boxing anymore so I’m not picking favorites)
Tyson "Jigglypuffin" Fury
Yep.. he won
Bum squad dossers talking, for reasons unknown.
This was like a fight if it’s own, I think Deontay got the edge honestly
Wilder hiding behind his earphones 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Brody stun
Dw needed support😂😂
Y’all hating so bad deontay focused
Tyson gonna whoop that man to the light heavyweight division
Wilder may not say it ..but I think he has new found respect for Fury's skills now..
One man listening to music another listening to the voices in his head. We know the result. It’s coming home it’s coming home. Tyson Terminator Fury
Fury mesmerised 😂
No one wants to see this fight lol.  Wilder just insisting on a fight no one cares about.
Fury gonna fuck him up again 💯
they don't  have  any  one  else  to fight... how many  times  should  I have to wach  them fight  together  👎👎👎
Why does it say "FAG" on Deontay Wilder sleeve?
they will end up in love.
Legend says they are still staring at each other “TILL THIS DAY!!”
they are inlove 😅😂🤣
Fuckn intense..
😴😴😴
I’m hyped for the next set of excuses if wilder loses. The memes will be legendary.
Mannn I've seen so many dudes this year with their glasses on at a face off and every single one of them lost... i know this means all business for wilder but i hope he proves me wrong. Make sure ya check everything including gloves so whoever loses won't have an excuse.
Fury looks like someone's drunk dad at a bbq
It gonna be a great fight, I can't wait for it. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
World Record for Longest face-off
What was fury flexing??😂 just keep your hands in your gloves this fight wit yo cheat n ass!!
Tyson just beat that ass
Deontay coming to end Fury his career #soulstealer #bombsquad
Wilder wins this time?
Finally a real fight instead of all these cartoon fights
Damn ,  Fury is FAT. He must want some extra cushion for those gut shots.
This staredown was more exciting than the floyd and logan fight tbh
Wondering logan paul declaring war on fury or wilder
Wilders walk out outfit gonna be made out of helium to ensure he has no resistance walking this time.
I thought fury was fighting joshua
lets see how smart wilder is?
Deontays chin mask crew seem like they are pretty stupid.
I can’t wait until wilder knock his sloppy ass out he so out of shape it’s not even funny
Deontay didnt speak cause he has no words for Tyson . Deontay  hands will do all the talking the 3rd fight . And now that they know Tyson cheating tactics mr fury has no chance . This is going to be easy work .
Wilder been skipping leg days lol 🤣 And also I just watched 2 grown ass  men staring at each other for 6:37 brilliant ✌️
Wilder damn angry. Wilder will get KOed for sure. I see him rushing in with anger and throw everything at Fury in the first few rounds.
If wilder wins they will have a 4th fight... was hoping for Fury vs Aj
“To dis day”
2 time what? Losses in a row? 🤣😂 fucking yes men.
Fury has real Gypsy bare knuckle fighters in his crew. I’d shut my mouth if I was on wilders side. Those boys dont play.
Omg they were looking at each other.   Crazy
I didnt even know this was happening but im fuckin excited
Eyes to eyes. 🤬😡
i was hoping for a heavyweight unification bout between fury and aj but i guess wilder 3 wouldn’t be so bad
Jonah Hill from Superbad "I'll kick you in the face, you four eyed prick" 😂😂
Anthony Joshua??? Why isn't Fury or Wilder fighting him
wilder will win this time
He lost to a fat boy 😂
Deontay's headphone are too heavy
i just stared at two men stare at each other for 5 plus minutes! 😳
Did anyone else think deonte was wearing socks at first
Thee bronze bomber iz back
I looked just like deontay the first time I got high.
Who actually cares about this fight? I'm just curious. Wouldn't AJ vs Fury be way more hype than this? They are ruining boxing with these stupid politics and millions of belts
Wilder has already lost. As he stepped in he looked at the floor.
Wilder will knock the fatman out.👍
BAWHMMMMMB SQUAAAAD
And here we have the most unattractive stare off in history.
Is it me or did Wilder get taller
In nervousness wilder listening motivational music in his headphones.
Yay we won! Bunch of dorks acting like kids
I’m wit the wilder
I’m a verified chunky boy but does Furry look a little flabby? 🥶
2time 2time, tool time, tool time, tool time. Man he just made me reminisce about Home Improvement
Fury won from the 1st fight as he got up from the canvas,the life drained from wilder from that point,it was all in his eyes,will always have a mental hold over wilder
Why the fuck they having a 3rd fight??? Something ain't right about this..
This is gay AF
…sloppy poorest example of a heavyweight champion in history yo💯💯💯…
I got a feeling fury gone get K.O
Big lads
I was always teen fury until I realised he cheated
Bomb scared of Tyson fury
Tyson Fury looks unbothered lol
Tyson looks like he just ate 5 guys and coke and ready to go do it again
bum squad. lol
I got knocked out by staring at them staring, at each other like that
I love that Tyson has a "dad bod" and still puts guys lights out. You got this Tyson. 💪
He even lost the stare down 😭 & I'm sure it would be easier to stare at somebody with music blasting in your ears 😂. Damn D, Fury really got to you huh 😪
This was an intense genjutsu battle.
For someone who got their ass whipped in the second fight Wilder sure acting tough.
Can't stand that race baiting wilder
Fury beats him again
Did deontay get taller 🤨
The Fat Deformed Clown and the Chicken-Legged Clown 🤡 👊
Wilder not as cocky as he was before 😂
Two-time loser
Wilder in 10
Wilder full of excuses but if he wins he will revive his career
Hope Wilder brings the belt back to America
Anything to keep Wilder in title contention. Should be Fury vs Joshua  Wilder vs Ruiz
I guess this means The Gypsie  King won this state down..
Who’s the goof in wilder’a corner that keeps saying “2 time”
That shit was great. Crazy how two dudes just standing there staring at each other can be entertaining lol
Little did they know Soulja Boy was already there
Fury getting killed
This fight is so pointless Just looking at this press conference, fury already won
Deontay se equivocó al pedir esta pelea. Pero es un guerrero con mucha vergüenza. Y la muerte en las manos. Claro si es que las puede usar.
6 minutos mirandose la cara wtf?
Wilder got taller
Cant wait for this fight!!!!
Biggest bollocks fight EVER in boxing HISTORY fury beat him twice and decided to duck joshua smh
Awkward
Its going to be worse for Wilder this time.. can't be a one trick pony, not against Fury he's too skilled. I just don't see what Wilder is going to do differently this time. Fury by TKO (just my opinion)
I can't wait, all eyes on fury gloves
Are y'all cheering that TYSON won a stare down 🤔
These press conferences for boxing are so poorly done
"Kicked in the face...ya four eyed prick!" 6:21 rofl who says that anymore
Wilder should have come in naked, so he doesn’t come out saying his sunglasses were to heavy, his headphones hurt his ear, his shirt was to tight and cut his circulation, etc……
Should of had a guy in the middle to say "ok guys we all wanna go home now"
Ridiculous
.
I actually think Fury seems to have a bit more nerves this time than he did last time.  You would think it would be the opposite, considering how the last fight went.  But there are some subtle signs of nerves.  For example, I kept watching his throat contracting, like he was constantly swallowing.  That is a sign of nerves.  It is something I do before a big competition or exam.  That doesn't mean he will lose.  But I do find him more nervous than last time.
What did the guy say to fury at the end thier when he yelled at him to shut the f up??
I picked fury the first time, but this time it’s definitely wilder. There’s something different about him this time
The headphones was to tune out errbody and have tunnel vision is my guess
Tyson Fury built like a half empty Caprisun pouch.
2 time 2 time  2 time  Ya man just keeps shouting how many times wilder has failed to beat fury 🤣
Damn when this happened
Toota toota toota
They should invite the genius book of record
Wilder better knw that if he loses this it’s over
tyson fury's stare down is what I usually do when I'm eyeing that chocolate cake in my fridge
THERES ONLY OOONNNNNEEEE BRONZE BOMBER!!!!!!!
Man Fury gonna whoop his ass..
Hopefully Wilder is ok after that staredown because that gold chain he had on weigh like 15 pounds... he needed his trainer to hold his hand because he couldn't walk on his own
Isn’t that a trust building exercise for struggling relationships
Alabama azz juice is going DOWWNN SONNN!!! 😂 I'm gonna take joy in seeing King Wakanda get ragdolled all around the ring once again. Can't wait til Tyson puts the beats by Dre on this dude & retires him once & for all so we can finally have the fight that we all really wanna see which is AJ vs Fury   Let's go Fury!!
Kinda turns gay after a minute. 🌈
Two clowns
Wilder is winning this one  Fury vs wilder 4
Just hug each other lol
Furry punch like a teenage girl knockout power 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
helllll yeahhhhh
Wilder gone kill him for feeeeeeeee🤸🙆🍾🍾🍾🍾🙆🙆🙆🙆
Yeah after a min of staring at my opponent I would have to look away shit is weird.
Wtf, I thought we were getting Fury vs Joshua....
Has anyone seen Deontay's baseball!
This fight should not have happened. Winner of fury and  Joshua, to fight wilder it’s gone personal sorry to say……
Wilder got soft had to wear shades cause too scared to stare in eyes only took off cause his corner said something and he kept headphones on I saw a soft scared baby lol
Wilder is working tirelessly trying to come up with a new excuse to use if he loses again. Is there anything left?
Ah fight I couldn’t care less about … same result
The clicking sound of the cameras are awesome.
Wilder wearing headphones to drown out any trash talk. Smart
Fury actually looks scared
The Shit Squad is scared already.
@300lbs he wouldn't be able to hit me....
Sugar shane fury lol. Wilders awfull shy .
Aww yeah fury scared 😭started doing all that wolfing when wilder walks away 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
LoL, is fury the bully??? This is hilarious he doesn't want hear anything. Poor baby
What's delusional Victim Kang Deontay gonna say this time?
If wilder changed his technique it’s a wrap for fat boy
Look like idiots
the SILENT TREATMENT is Wilders best VOICE.
Funny how the guy with the gut is the one with his shirt off and the guy with the 6 pack has his shirt on.
Dude pants a lil tight there 5:10
1st time i seen fury lose a press conference showdown.......wilder staying silent was genius
Deontey may win he has learnt some combinations
They say negative thoughts and evil energy alway and I say ALWAYS will lose and it always shows
Is the dent in his head still there
Fan of both fighters but there’s something different about Deontay wilder I think he’s going  for the kill
Ronda Rousey didn’t speak or do interviews the last time she fought either
Fury was feeling it
Fury 9th round TKO
As I was watching I absolutely knew Wilder would be the first to quit the staredown.
Fury looks nervous too me
How many times is that dude gonna say 2 time..  bro your boy lost two times.
Why is the “Timmy” dude from SouthPark at the face-off?
Wilder bottled it qgain. Hiding behind his earphones and sunglasses. Hes already lost
They got married shortly after
Looks like a dad checking out his son 2 times isnt enough for him ,wake up smell the cheese
I can see Wilders focus is on point
Wilder is in  Pick your Player Mode
Make sure they check Tyson's Colon this time! No cheating!
I don't know but i feel like Tyson fury is losing this one he's just not the same as he was on the rematch! Don't hate on me pls
2 time 2 time 2 time wilder got whooped 2 time 2 time
Mom: How many times I got to tell you?  Me: *2 TIME*
Frank Warren Champ Chanp
Wilder is gonna knock this man out! 7th Rd KO 🔒
Does Wilder really have any grounds to stand there in a stare down with Fury and try and intimidate him??  Fury beat him like a bitch last fight.  He was embarrassing
I think he said tool time.
Furry shook none of that non sense is getting in 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 look how wilder looking at him
Till this day !!
I love how people talk shit behind they keyboards. Lol none of you walking up to Wilder with this energy 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
USA!!!🇺🇲
I can’t wait!!!...The best fighting the BEST. Not that Floyd bullshit
for anyone confused, in the contract if wilder loss the belt to fury he could have a rematch to retain it. a clause or something like that. Thats why it’s a third fight cause by technical boxing terms nobody won the first fight.
How boring.
Tyson fury is a bad man
Two of the worst HW "title fights" in our generation already working on their 3rd Stupid Circus. The worst. Both are the worst.
Damn shame what happened to Wilder🤣
Legend has it they are still staring at each other to this day
U can really see the dent in wilder head when the 🎥 get close. Fury cheated and he's getting ko
Okay now hurry… pass them the visine.
Two things Malik should not have done that showed Maliks weak mentality the story of the burst ear drum and breaking the stare down.
Land Bodyshot 😝😁
Who let 2 time in
6:19 The Gypsy Roadman
F that cheater up Deontay...
They’re still staring… Till this day. TILL THIS DAY!!
If you can read lips Fury said..."I want the gold... beats by dre that is...its the only thing that has eluded me"
Tyson looking like a bag of milk letsgooooooo
It is 5:10 pacific standard time where I am at...and they are still staring each other down!!
What’s the point of buying this fight??? Can anyone tell
The headphones are only there to keep blood from leaking out of that ear again
Fury is a fake ass gypsy king the gypsy's shouldn't call him king of shit
wtf Wilder got like 2 inch heels in those sandles
Fury gonna hurt that punk, his costume will be too heavy... LMFAO🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.. Tyson beat this chump on fight 1 W.B.C didn't believe it happens..
If anyone drops out I think Jake Paul should step in
Same result
I just can’t wait for the fight, it’s gonna be good either way. Going for Fury though!
They actually look so dope standing up and looking at each other like that ngl
where's dana when you need him
Fury is TERRIFIED 😨....all that FAKE bravado
Tyson whoopin that ass again. Bum Squad
I want to know if this was a record for the worlds longest face off.
That sums up how interesting this fight is
Fury is the coolest fucking guy
its up to his little brother.
Too tie
This is ridiculous
Legend says he's still standing there, staring at the image of Wilder.
😂 Fury met the whole crew at a Dunkin Donuts
Look into my eyes... Look into my eyes
Sauna story all over again, a mental victory
Wait wait… I though he was going to fight AJ when did this happen
Wilder got so outclassed in the last fight I don’t see a possibility where he wins this fight. Fury is a different beast at his size with his mobility. Wilder is just going to let his hands fly and get slept then complain about the atmospheric pressure weighing down on him in the ring.
WILDER IS EXTREMELY FOCUSED 💪💪💪💪💪 #CHAMP #THEARTOFWAR
Fury looks gross….. hw boxing is a total embarrassment these days
**someone calls in a bomb threat and the bomb squad is required to attend the premises**....... “bomb squad”
Didn't even know this was booked wtf oh well look forward to watching the highlights of wilder getting schooled for a third time
After all of this they didnt kiss... i can see dissapointment on Tyson face at 6:17
Difficult to Stare down that long
FURY!!!!
Look at furys dad bod
Coming from a Fury fan, Wilder won that stare down. Wilder only moved, when Fury cracked a smile and started to slightly bounce on his toes. In his eyes, that was the end of the stare down, not when the first person moves.
So, you guys are just gonna give this man more money to get knocked out? Fury is so far beyond Wilder.. I think a 50 year old Tyson would last longer.
This is bullshit I was more hyped for Fury vs Joshua
He knows to shut the fuck up because he can’t break Fury mentally. The mans lost his head.. he looks like an even skinnier noodle than the last time 😂
I get it but you can’t fight with headphones playin your hype music ...should be a great battle
What the he'll is he saying tool time for lol
When Simon says stay still
Somebody seperate them that was half of the match
Philly fans would start booing @1:32
Prediction: Wilder will bomb the crap out of thin air to exhaustion and Fury knocks him out within 4 rounds.
Money grab is what this is
Stfu hype boy
Wilder won
THE CAREER CHEATER TYSON FURY!
Or did that dude get 100 bucks for every time he says two time not times
Imagine being Tyson fury thinking, I beat your ass so bad you thought I put weights in my gloves. Boy ima bout to give you another big ass whoppin
Gay
The guy saying 0-2 was amazing.
Ppl there saying, "what's going on here?!" obviously had both parents in their lives!
This is getting old to me. We should be seeing Fury vs Joshua
Wilder is going to knock Tyson fury out
“TwO tImE!!!”
do boxer's compete for the most embarrassing clothes to wear and in public
Im hoping this will be the time when Fury is lit up properly for the bum he is. No games this time round, no hype talk, just a no questions ko that puts Fury out the sport
Same as last fight but in 6th round 🤔 all rounds Fury.
Again Furry 📧
Tyson all day all night 💪🏼
Fury high as was falling asleep
Too late for intimidation
The dumb asses talking two times is that he got beat two time lmao
Fury is afraid to mentioned Jesus. While Wilder has genuinely repented.  The guilt of Tyson fury really paused him. He felt very ashamed insight. John 10 🙏.
Tyson fury like fuck what have I got myself into 😂😂
Look at the dude's body! How?
Fury will knock u out again
ERIN ABU
similar to the sauna story, this is a mental victory for tyson
When he took his shades off I thought "it almost looks like fear in those eyes" haha
I would knock out wilder THUG LIFE!
Just standing silently watching two guys stand silently
Fury hands are trembling with fear
This look like when 2k showing you the other teams build and stats except it froze coz the servers ass 😂
Well, Wilder's staredowns have improved, so you never know.
wilder will be like floyd fighting instagram kids after this!!
@6;04 Wilder wet his lips when he turnaround......😂😂😂😂
Tyson Fury is the better fighter, the world knows this, Deontay knows this - thats why he has been training his ass off and is 1000% focused. So Tyson Fury supporters.. don't be too confident or cocky, because thats exactly when things go wrong. This is a spiritual war between them and Tyson Fury needs your full support.  Don't let him down !
Too tahh * 8
Whatever-whatever this is a can't miss fight, chubby vs 1P man!
I just wanna know what’s the reason this time bomb squad supporters cause he got his ass whipped twice
Wilder is finna destroyed this man I can see it already
Fury beat this man twice
THE GREAT WHITE CHRISTIAN CATHOLIC CONSERVATIVE(GODS ONLY CHILDREN) puts the devils black mask of satan away in his own bomb squat!!!LOL  ps wilder was listening to born free by the african philharmonic oh right they only dance !!oh right wilder cant dance just fall!!!
2 what now? Oh ok two time! Just incase I forgot 😂
Fury gets to come in in whatever shape he pleases because there has not been nearly enough time for wilder to learn how to box with Tyson. Tyson in 6, just for giggles.
FUCK THIS FIGHT 😴😴😴
Why fury look so small. No way wilder should lose this fight
two time as in deontay lost two times?
In'sha'Allah Tyson lays wilder out flat. I'll be praying for you big man. God be with you.
My God. Lol 😆 this is  peanut butter Falcon 4 real....
2x2x2x2x2x2x2=??
Two-time
Fake
Take a shot everytime you hear "two times"
Someone needs to slap the two times out of his mouth at least two times. Fml that shit was annoying af
They say Fury is taller. Doesn't look it to me.
I think this time
I thought Fury fell asleep as he stare wilder😂😂
This is a fight we didn't need to see 🤦‍♂️
Wilder is intimidated...
Atleast have someone who's got some sort of authority to split them up. 🤦🏻‍♂️ You do know, they're thinking whoever looks away first is scared.
The dude that said..."and new"...😅🤣, fury going to spank wilder again.
I think wilders pants were too tight he couldnt move
How many times again I missed it ?
Tyson fury is going to mop the floor with him once again
It’s funny. It’s a whole bunch of caucasian trolls talking shit about Wilder. Would love to go in the ring with some of you myself.
Is this a new record by the way?
This fight will be different.  Wilder didn't run his mouth...
Let’s go Whoa! That’s intense! 💪🏾🗣BOOOMB SQUAAAD!!!! 🥊💣
Seems kinda gay
The kiss was a little weird
"2 Time"
You never leave first. We would've been waiting there an hour
Its like that step brothers scene
Wilder is a sore loser he is the reason we aren't getting Anthony Joshua vs Fury as scheduled.
Ultimate staredown!!! My daughter would love this. Hee hee.
u can feel the sexual tension in there
I hope wilder pulls this off with a Devistating KO
Why is this fight happening deontay is no where near tyson skill level
I wonder how long both of them practiced this staredown in the mirror prior to this🤔
I thought Fury cheated from the 2nd fight?
Y’all ever see the social experiment video when people stare at each other for 4 minutes and gain some kind of emotional attraction?
Wilder brought his cheerleaders. Too bad he couldn't hear shit. What a punk.
they're having a crush😄
Fury will be blown away by Wilder. Dude looks motivated and in great shape will Fury is soft and seems like hes still enjoying his old glory but that will soon be gone. Ring will explode and Fury will be sent to atmosphere
I’ve never seen so much intensity from Wilder. He’s done talking and now it’s laser focus. That is probably messing with Fury’s head so much right now just because he as well as everyone expects to hear Wilder just non stop trash talk but this silence tactic he’s using is genius! Even the cheerleader boys on Fury’s side were getting angry because Wilder wasn’t saying anything. I say Wilder takes this one.
Some say Tyson is still standing there, TO THIS DAY
Hopefully he beats this prejiduce fools ass again, make those ancestors he brags about feel it.
What the hell was jonah hill doing there?
Bronze excuses more like it
Wilder is the LeBron of boxing.
Fury living "rent free" in Wilder's head.
Or is it the air cause this dude can’t fight these pros A J and Tyson is the fight
3 - 0 to Tyson already 😂🤣😂
The crypto market is becoming more appeal to investors seeking assets that diversify portfolios, Btc could be in the process of seeing a "volatile reset." By the moves between dips and rises it's a typical neutral outlook which makes it a tough decision for lnve stors to decide how best to utilize the current market; I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line but findn ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of life, I didn’t think it was posible to make constant win from trad!ng till I came across Daniel Wright program for lnvestors/newbies who lack understandn on how trad!ng B!tcoin works, to help them stack up more B!tcoin, since  last year till date I have made over 18 worth of BTC from 3.6BTC with Daniel's help I've full confidence in his tradn abilities. You can easily get to him on ᴛᴇʟ ᴇɢʀᴀᴍ handle [ Danielwrightfx ].
that fat curly haired dude looks like dude from The Hangover 💀
Two great hw.  I beat them both easily if I ever picked up a pair of gloves.  I’m 63.  And no doubt in my mind I would best bith in the same night.   These press conferences make me realize how great of a fighter I could have been
Wilder still out here worshipping the devil so we know he's gonna get crushed
Who cares he lost twice no w let me guess his ego weighs to much and wore him out
Not looking good for wilder... Those headphones look heavy
Not those pants. Anything but those pants like that.
Wilder broke first put ya money on fury
Was eagerly awaiting this press conference to see what deontay wilder would come out and say but the fact he refused to listen to a word said or take any questions sitting with his earphones in the full time just shows he’s not accepting that defeat at all. Coward move in my eyes.
That shit must get boring, I'm not a pro boxer but standing there doing nothing and just looking at your opponent look boring asf lmao
Deontay 🌩 💪🏿 🤜🏿 ⚡ 🥇
most awkward staring contest of all time
Team Tyson 💯
World record staring contest
i hope wilder can pull this off man
Wilder is bound to come up with some excuses again. Another KO. This referee will prefer not to save wilder
Too tight?
Get some real boxers on here like Paul Brothers.
Two times you flick the dice! Give me Two times baby
Can you teach an old dog new tricks??
Wilder doesn’t like fury’s antics and mental warfare that’s the only reason to be listing to music during a press conference
Wilder is gonna get hurt serious this time. The last showing was an embarrassment. I see timidity in his body language. I hope I am wrong and that it will be a war.
tyson gonna knock dudes hair line back another inch...KO
Two bums who are afraid to fight AJ trying to sell some shit.
Deontay covered his ears so he wouldn’t have to talk.
AND NOW FOR THE MAIN EVENT!!!!!... THE STARE DOWN!! 🤠🤣🤠🤣🤠
dumbest shit i've ever seen honestly
Wilder trying to hide behind earphones and glasses. Already beaten.
What's wrong with this "two time" guy 🤣🤣
That was a long stare down
Fury can’t cheat this time break his jaw off his fuckin head
Wilder learned available lesson saying less is more
Has wilder come up with anymore stupid excuses . They comical
Deontay has already lost this fight! He don't want it...just a payday!
Boxing mythical fighter silent deontay
What kind of sandals is Wilder wearing?
THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST REPLACED THEM BOTH WITH A COUPLE CARDBOARD FUCKIN CUT-OUTS!!!🤣🤣🤣
Busted both the trainer and the fighters ears haha
Don't you go wearing stupid heavy things
Are those Beats on your head from Dre or Fury? 🤣 I guess that's gonna keep Fury out of his head. But it ain't gonna make him a better boxer.
Knoc out by starting  awsome
Nice to see the media not getting their way for a change !  Massive respect to both Tyson & Deontay for not breaking the stare to the medias demands !
Why Deontay looking like he's still recovering from that last fight?
Tyson fury cheated with his gloves last fight.
Awkward to face off that long. Wilder getting ko'ed again
Fury, least muscular heavy weight ever and still kicks ass.
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
Ima guess now and say WILDER BY KO
That jewlery on Wilder looks too heavy.
I hope Fury trained well.. Don't forget Deontay got heavy heavy hands..
Tyson gonna knock him out again
They all should have just walked out and leave them 2 stare at each other.
Go fury wish I could afford to watch it live not fair u have to pay to watch
Reminds me of Fury speaking about the build up to his bout with Klitschko. He spoke about how he met him in the sauna and outlasted him to near blackout; Tyson’s mind warfare is such a powerful asset of his
What’s he keep saying one time for?  Is it Wycliffe Jean or something
Championship level staring contest!!!lol
Why is everybody hating on wilder??   Yes, he lost.. Yes, he made excuses.. Yes, he was afraid to look stupid at the press conference. Oh i get it. hahaha  Fury in the 5th round
When was this fight made?
Fury look scared 😂
You watch, Tyson will now bulk out a bit more and get the Kronk bod ready for another beat down. Also why is he shouting out how many times he's been beat...
Deonte: A beast that now sees talk as cheap!    Fury so much superior technically though....        This will be exciting !
Come on Fury beat his ass for a third time and be done with him lol
Deontay crazy to jump right back into it
Real gentleman Fury is surrounded by lol
I thought they were about to embrace. You complete me! Did you see the sign behind Wilder. He's eating himself
Can someone tell me how many times??
Two times...he lost
Fury looked sad
Fury looks scared asf
African Americans are so desperate.
I absolutely love & respect Tyson's story. But Wilder is an American, so I 100% amm pulling for Wilder!  That "2 time knucklehead" must have an IQ of 3...
Imagine your opponent having such a mental advantage over you, that you refuse to speak in a presser.😂
hes gotta keep his nipple on the crowd
Why ??????? Wat happened to Joshua
Tyson standing alone talking shit in the end lmao
Shame this is the fight that’s happening instead of Joshua
Wilder's biggest obstacle is himself. Dude talks gibberish thinking he's some kind of black revolutionary like he's some political figure but he hasn't learned shit
Win or lose these two have brought life back to boxing 🥊!!!  This shit gone be lit this is what's it's about bro real fighters !!! Wilder with a 9 round KO
Wilder trying not to let fury break him mentally not a bad plan... Still won't make any difference he will still lose
.. Beyontay Bebby.... Ahahahaha
I feel like wilder gonna knock him out this time
I can’t believe I just watched 5 mins+ of two grown men starring at each other…
Funny comments but just know wilder getting it back in blood 🩸! Bomb 💣 squadddddd
Fury is a better Heavyweight in the world,wilder gonna down.AGAIN
When do they fight?
No cheating for fight 3. All the haters please keep the same energy
Yo I can't wait. I understand why Wilder said he won the first fight. I know he lost every round but the round he knocked him down, he has a point though, they counted way to slow. Second fight he lost he was fatigued for no good reason. I hope this third fight goes Wilder's way :)
Take off those stupid surgeon masks idiots. covid is a psyop.
Anyone know why the "four eyed" guy off stage said to annoy them at the end? About 6:25
Fury AND Wilder AND their teams are PETTY AS HELL 😂😂😂 grown children
In still....
Can't wait to see this fight, you can tell Tyson fury's shaky on he's boots 🤣
Rumor has it, they still staring 'Till this dayy'
what was shane fury saying to the dude? Seems like he wanted to scrap right there lol
When is the fight?
I think wilder is still dizzy from last fight
Wilder don’t wanna listen to Tyson lol
Boy do they hate us people of color and we love it 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 til this day
Legend has it, they're still facing off TO THIS DAY! 😱😱😱
Tyson Fury made WIlder his bitch in the previous match so there's a little love involved this time.
why is his nipple looking at me
You're just too good to be true, can't take my eyes off of you.
Aww man I hope he does better than that last comedy show I mean fight
Hope Tyson Fury doesn't cheat again with the. Illegal gloves, or else he gonna be a discrase like Antonio 'GARBAGE' Margarito we Mexican's don't claim him want him or support his lying lame punk ass let North Korea have him
pjs vs tight slim jeans
They gon fight again???
They tryna fight or f*ck cause I cant tell anymore . They were starring so deeply into each others eyes ..
Dont forget the last fight was rigged you can totally tell fury didn't have his gloves on properly
Wilder left when he realised nobody was there to throw in the towel for him this time. 🤷🏾‍♂️
He's gonna knock fury out and he knows it
Where's the body language experts at?  Where y'all at?
Fury whooped his ass twice, why a third fight? 🤦🏽
Let tha games begin.. 2x!!!2x!!!!
If Wilder wins we will have Wilder vs Fury 4  😂
I think wilder gonna surprise everyone and put Tyson to sleep with a lucky punch but don’t think Tyson will get up this time
First the Mayweather/Paul staredown and now this, next headline will be "McGREGOR AND POIRIER BREAK RECORD FOR LONGEST STAREDOWN" until mf'ers are making out just to one up the last face-off.
Wilder took long enough getting up and walking to Tyson,, guess that shirt around his waist is too heavy 😂😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡🤡
Wilder did the right thing 💪🏿💪🏿🙏🏿
This is gonna be hot wilder ain't gonna win though
More like bummmmmm squad really think hes improved enough to beat tyson your delirious
I gotta be honest i hope this fight dwarfs that exhibition we saw. I love both these guys
In fury's eyes he already won the fight bc he stood up there longer...
Well you can be grown man boxer rich but idiot in same time  That’s what this video represents
Fury looks like more fat than the second fight,i hope that's not make him slower and reduce his stamina
Wilder knocking him out
This was cute.
Wilder looks intimidated
Wait they are fighting again? Or is this old?
Did Fury give Wilder that stutter?
Pussy move. Headphones and sunglasses.
Staring till they fall in love
Chain, sunglasses, headphones... That dudes always carrying extra weight..not including the jacket (or a T-shirt in furry's case) 😅
I thought Fury was 6'9" and Wilder was 6'7"... I guess I got those numbers mixed up.
Skinny legs 🤣
I hope Tyson batters wilder as this press conference showed wilder isn't man enough to be a champ. Every champion has lost but still faced the public. Wilder is a joke
Tyson fury is a rockstar
Apparently both guys trained for this staredown by looking directly into the sun for a week straight.
To this day his still mad lmaooooooo
i just watched two dude staring at each other for 5 minutes..thats tough!
The score is 2-0 in favor of fury. I'm legit not interested in seeing this a 3rd time. (Fury won that 1st fight!!)
Tyson woulda stood there all night
Someone shut that dude saying “two times up”.  What was a cute response became a show of stunning ignorance.  Jesus.
Dontay needs to pack on some more muscle
Wilder will knock him out now
Two never was's!! Welcome to the circus!!!
They were fighting in another dimension. Fury won again.
Man Tyson looks so out of shape but damn boy it'll be stupid to underestimate his strength and power punch, maybe not that fast but again it'll be dumb to underestimate him.
I hope wilder win my fav heavyweight fighter
Two time loser, two time lost, two time got his brains bashed in!
Damn, even Wilders entourage lost lmao
Ju gołing dałn, satujdej sandej bejbi.
That body cheated fair an square 🤣🤣🤣
Team wilder 💣
Man I cant stand all the dam picture snapping makes no dam sense
2 time bum squad
Wilder; My 24K Gold chain weighs like 800 pounds that why I couldn't move and look forward cause I was tired
Let's go Wilder 😬😬😬
Bruh, staredown with glasses and headphones, thats a scared man
Jake paul would beat both of these guys no sweat same with Logan they light work
Your thrash bro you can't box.  To this day!!!
Tyson is standing there still
I will watch Tyson out box him again, and again and AGAIN.
Ik what ever saying but I feel like wilder going to put fury on his ass a couple of times I’m not saying wilder a better fight but when you trying to look past this man it going to be his downfall
I hope Wilder realizes that he can’t wear shades and headphones in the ring on fight night!
sHEEESSSHHH!!!
WILDER LOOKS PRIMED AND READY. LOOKS VERY FOCUSED AND I BELIEVE HE WILL BRING NEW ELEMENTS TO HIS BOXING WHICH WILL SUPRISE FURY 💯
Wtf happened to Anthony Joshua?
Idiots saying when is this fight for fuck sake LOOK BEHIND ITS SAYS JULY THE 24TH
They turned each other to stone
I apologize I've been under a rock I didn't even realize there was a trilogy
Didn't nobody want to see the first 2 fights
Deontay is 2 timing his wife?
He left fury shook
Wilder look like man I hope these people can’t hear my heart beating like the band on Drumline! Oh I just put my headphones on listen to my gospel because he gonna need God and Jesus Christ in his corner for this fight!
Fury always a fatty ...gross man get in shape dude thats just embarrasing...
Beyonce chicken legs wildswing. Bum squad
This is how my dog stares at other dogs through the fence.   Seemed unnecessarily long.
R.i.p. Fury... the only thing that's gonna be flapping around this fight are his rolls instead of his gloves 🤣🤣🤣 #BombSquad
Furry is gonna knock him out this time 😤 n wilder is gonna retire
Wilder is already a two time. A two time loser!
Fury doesn’t need to try and get in wilders head, he lives there rent free!
I hope the fight lasts as long as the face off!!
I feel awkward  and I'm just spectating 🙃
Blacks vs the world 🌎. All these non black folks are going to talk shit about a black athlete anytime they get a chance to
Tyson was looking into the eyes of a demon
This reminds me of the story about Fury and Klitschko in the sauna.
Wilder had to keep the headphones on so fury dosnt get in his head lol
Why is that obese guy with the curly hair talking so much once they left...
The King bout to go 3-0 against that mask wearing clown. How many already know it?
Watch how tyson get beat the fuck up this time
Now that's what I call a freaking face off!!!
This was a mental battle. If you’ve heard the sauna story of Tyson and klitchko then you know. Fury was ready to stay there for hours without breaking the face off.
Diante looking like an avatar with his tight pants on
Hit him with the egg weight fury lol.
wilder's brother thinks he's part of team AJ.
Do they only fight eachother?
a boxing match is always a scary prospect regardless of how good you are. These boys are 2-0 for fury but shit is so corrupt we're stuck with this nonsense.
Honestly embarrassing for the sport of boxing . Led us to believe the fury Joshua fight was a done deal for months , then give us this BS no one asked for
I wonder what his costume will be this time
Nah Dw got anger (・ε・)ﾑｰ in him from Tyson glove tampering that's all... Wilder ain't playing with him this time ⌚though I can tell he ain't talking much
Title: Gayest Steredown 2021
Tyson fury going to sleep!!!!!!!?
20 years ago Fedor was the most average-looking dude that was secretly the most dangerous man alive. Now, Fury's gotta be somewhere up there too, dude's got the physique of a plumber, yet I wouldn't want to step outside with him!  😂 😂 😂 😂
Mental victory
that was very satisfying to watch
Furey’s body looks even.worse now so he’ll probably win even easier this time
This was umm intense...would you look at that
Wilder going to lose again… why they give this clown a 3rd match??
This is the fight I've been waiting for the past 6 years. If deontay wins they will probably go 4 fights and this will be our new age heavy weight historical fued
they ought to get a room ...
That was epic
Tyson fury looking like “Ben askew” in the belly region 😂🙈
Is this the Eddie hearn section?  !!!!!!  YOU SUCK EDDIE.  !!!!!!
WILDER is....LeBron James🎯
😂Bummmmmmsquaddddddd
Wilder is going to kill this man.  And, I can see it.  Lol.  😂😂😂  I know it is going to happen.  🤣🤣🤣
Bomb squad though ! 😂😂😂😂😂
if we base this off what tysons said Before he just won. same with the sauna story and wladimir.
Easier to staredown when you're listening to music let's be real
Wilder is going 2 catch a Murder charge
What’s the point fury beat him twice🤦🏽‍♂️
i just spent 6 minutes of my time watching two dudes stare at each other
Idk why anyone thinks wilder actually has a chance to beat fury this time
My heart telling me fury gonna win with his style, but my soul telling me wilder gonna touch him... just hope for a non one sided fight
Lets go fury. Easy work!
This is a Real Boxing Fight that Real Boxing/Sports Fans wanna see, not to mention its a Trilogy for a Heavyweight World Title.
Why is this fight happening again?  I don’t want to see Wilder get killed.  His manage,ent team must think Wilder is done.
This one guys a fighter ? Looks like he's been eating McDonald's and playing videos games his whole life lol
Fury don't need the belts for an AJ fight
Longest look off in history😂😂😂
It's 2-0-1 Fury...
White boy looks chubby. Must be off that coke.
No more bomb squad ✌️
ATLEAST WILDER V JOSHUA? BUT THIS 3 TIMES
Love At First Sight
Wilder thinks he so 😎 lol
I think they fell in love
I’m expecting Tyson fury to lose because it’s 2021
Wilder needed his sunglasses in the beginning cause he is scared
Wow.....Fatty Fury is .....well fat? Not a boxing fan.....not what I was expecting?
Fury going to sleep
Fury looking good! Wonder what deontays excuse will be this time🤣
Headphones fer stare down🤦‍♂️😂🤣he already lost hope tyson aint dopn again kinda looks that way
2 TIMES!!!😂😂
The breezy entrance pathologically empty because decade proximately pull underneath a violent rayon. unwieldy, uppity flute
They stared at each other for almost 5 minutes holy shit
Fury was quiet this time, wilder looked pissed about the  last fight, the other guys were too busy trying to figure out numbers!
Wilder won the stare down.
Still getting paid less then the Jake Paul on fights lol....
The headphones give Fury the psychological advantage , and the fact Tyson was there first says it all
Wow, i really spent 5 minutes watching two men stare at each other. This is gayer than gay porn
It's more like bum squad
The faceoff ain't the fight
Tyson doesn't look in shape at all!
Possibly the longest stare down I’ve ever seen!! 🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️and who’s the fat curly haired guy talking shit??
Fury = skill Wilder = no skill ALL STEROIDS
Winner takes Jake Paul in a wrestling match.
Wilder already lost as you can tell by every moment
Boxing stare downs are so awkward
I think Fury going to win again. Wilder will be a different fighter I think with better cardio to match Fury
Tyson he is scared billy you not here to help him
Record 😂
How did we get all the way to the press conference and no one knew this was a thing
Wilder is going down again. He was the first to look away.
wow a rematch that everybody didn't ask.  im hyped and my pants,  my dog grumbling from exictment to watch this AGAIN for the 5th TIME! much wow, much omg, much kehendhekabdjdj! *i hate it* cash cow ass
Before when they did this I could see fear in deontay but now it’s the opposite. Fury don’t want this one
Wilder should be embarrassed of himself 🤣
Twoo time lol
Fury do my eyes a favor and put your GD shirt on - no one wants to see a man with larger breasts than my wife...
TU TAIM!!!!!!
Fury will still fuck Wilder up again...
Why are we getting this instead of Fury VS AJ?
Bomb squad don’t cheat
Mental Warfare  FURY - 1 WILDER - 0
From all the comments I see about Wilder loosing apparently y'all don't watch or knw what's going on reasons they are here because Fury CHEATED let's not forget that with all that was wrong with Wilder he cudnt keep him down so punches had no power
Tyson fury swag is hilarious 🤣
Deontay is soooo much cringe 🤦🏻‍♂️🤡 acting all hard when everyone knows how he bitched out the last fight
Those headphones look heavyyyy
Why does Wilder keep getting title shot after title shot???? Are there any other heavyweight boxers that can fight Fury?????????
Only ONE refused to look away
I hope wilder is ready for that 0-2
Why's Seth Rogen  trying to get hard with people at the back 🤣😂🤦
The number of camera shots in this stare down is hilarious lol
Greatest face off of all time and longest face off of all time
To anyone that sees those little kinks and flaws like when Francis sprawled on stipe and stipe had that oh shit look on his face? Anyone saw that in the beginning of the face off with Fury?
the same result! still!
I'll be looking at Tyson's gloves a little closer this time around you know just in case LOL
Kiss him already you fool
Two time Two time Two time he beat your fucking ass
Fury get back in shape my boi you got this God Bless all!
Y’all heard that 2 time
Rumour has it Tyson fury is still stood there staring him out
This is bad for Wilder, Tyson has already started winning the mental games!
The longest faceoff i never watch
Deontay "two time" Wilder
The look on your face when you about to shit your pants.
The fight no one asked for
TOETA!
Lil dicky the hype man🤣🤣🤣
EVERYBODY HAS A PLAN UNTIL THEIR HEADPHONES DISRUPT EQUILIBRIUM AND MAKE YOU LOSE THE FIGHT
Trying to build hype for a fight that no one wants to see
Did someone say two-time
Funniest/strangest faceoff ever lol 😆
I sat here for 6:37 watching two grown men having a staring contest and I was captivated. I don't know what I thought was going to happen 🤔
Fury robbed and cheated that man 2 twice.
Fury will retire this bum
"TWO TIME" "TWO TIME" "TWO TIME" "TWO TIME" "TWO TIME" "TWO TIME" "TWO TIME" "TWO TIME" "TWO TIME"  Holy fuck we got it guy
Tyson fury built like a milk bag
Two-time?
Eye strain.
Tbh it’s a real shame He didn’t have more time to say two time another two times
Wilder was talking shit on YouTube videos but couldn’t say anything to tysons face. He knows Tyson will own him verbally and on July 24th, Tyson will own him physically
i know Deontay is playing Marvin's Room in those headphones
The  vibe is completely different this time and Wilder wants that body on his resume ✅
Fury is going to KO “two time”
This is actually the first battle of the mental warfare if any yous even understood
Tutaj
Hopefully wilder comes out on a rascal or something so his outfit doesn’t exhaust him during his walkout again
Can't wait
Wilder rocking side to side is a sign of being nervous, comforting himself with that movement.
Too be fair Wilder did look really weak, wobbly from start of the bell in the 2nd fight... I don't believe fury cheated at all though.  I think Wilder really did underestimate the ring walk with that unnecessary costume. I think after he brought the ring walk up he realized how stupid it sounded , and came up with a host of other b.s. to try legitimize his reasoning for the loss.  Instead he should have just took the L like a man THEN get the rematch regardless to whether or not ppl want to see it.
"BoMb SqUaD"... Trash 🗑️
3:11 to this day 😃
Oh for ffs not this again
Does that fat guy know he's got a fight coming up?
Bomber still have that dent in his head? No costume today? Probably too heavy. Lmao
Some say fury is still stood there just starring...
Wish I could hear what they're saying without all the ckt ckt ffft tkk chkk
Trust me wilder gonna win this by ko
I’m rooting for wilder but I think fury puts em away by the 7th
when you know its true love 2:57
Wilder scared that’s why he won’t talk
Yo i fell asleep someone tell me who won
Two time ✌🏾
Wilders gonna need the infinity stones.
I'm convinced Wilders trainer bummed him such a yes man
Tyson gradually got taller during the stare down.
Was Fury Obese in the last fight?
i never knew this was happening till now
Best part of this vid is hearing an inbred scream 2 times for 6 minutes
Tyson gonna beat this fool again
Ledgends say they were fight a matching within their minds to this day!
Wow this is the longest game of whoever blinks first loses I have ever seen🤣
People put your money on fury thank me later
Mk Ultra
Lmfaoooo this nigga Tyson shaped like my dad but be fuvking niggas up I’m weak
I have no respect for wilder, even if he comes out victorious. The way he handled his loss was testament to why he will never be a champion mentally
Wilder loses easily again and blames being born on the loss
I’m sorry people wilder can’t box, you can only go so far as a one tool wonder. He will lose again because he can’t box!
The jokic of boxing
Wilder got this .. I got faith he learned how to box😭
BUM-squad
Fury lost all right to call anyone a pussy since he allowed his best pal's Dad get rag dolled!  Fat useless Shane gettin involved 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wilder by uppercut, just like canelo to fury’s homeboy. Brits never see the uppercut coming.
Who won the stare-down? Comedy. "Two times" was shouted out in a high number.
Why is this fight happening again?
They should kiss
It feels like I been waiting forever for this omg 😱 I can’t wait.
Honestly I just want them to move on. Deontay has always been my dude but I love Fury’s story and his comeback. Dude is an amazing fighter. Fury has already proven to be the better of the two but it’s hard to call cuz this can go either way. I’m leaning to my man Deontay with a KO in round 9.
Tyson left his ass somewhere while Wilder forgot to bring his balls.
Deyontay corner over there being like "he lost 2 times 2 times 2 times" yeah we know tyson won twice...
Wilder will fall prey yet again as muscle memory will let him down again he only knows one way to fight and it ain't pretty. Go Fury
This is a very odd face off....😂😂😂😂
Ah.. Just kiss already😂
Wilder is going to get fucked up. Smfh lol
Don't be the loud mouth squad again .... It ended very badly last time
i think they are standing there TIL THIS DAY!!!!
I don't get it the boxing administration found fury guilty for cheating lmao but they want to keep that under wraps lmao white privilege
Another EZ win for Fury
He gonna baptize someone? That’s what he likes to say
I truly believe that tyson would of stood their all day and night another Wladimir sauna moment this time its a stare down
Fury has a similar story with klitschko in the sauna. he refused to leave before him because he wanted to assert his willpower. similar thing happened here… you will move before me. mental win
I thought fury was 2-3 inches taller.  They look exactly the same height in this video.  Who was yelling 2 time and what does that mean?
Wilder being weird af
Witnessing two killers staring each other down! The goosebumps are real!!
Tyson King of the dad bods Fury
After 10 seconds my balls touch the floor  What a bullshit
Legend has it they're still facing off...TO THIS DAY😂
Song playing on Wilders headphones “ Girls like you”
Wilder got it this time by tko
100% Wilder gonna win after seeing Fury’s body language here
Wilder looked away first, a sign of weakness. Tyson Fury with a 6th round finish Wilder is gonna come out aggressive early and punch himself out.
Just get a piece a cardboard and break the eyes for them.
Good to see Wilders listening to self motivation tapes, just to be able to stand there.
OFF WITH TYSON FURY HEAD 🤴🏿😈👊🏿
To this day!!!!!
I hope wilder really trained on his boxing and foot work ! Or it will be the same results
Wasnt fury fighting joshua?
Who’s ever in charge should of stepped in sooner what are they waiting for someone to hit someone
Imagine losing last fight and trynna act like something
Title correction: “as Fury refused to look away”
Secretly David Dobrik’s in the back and Tyson just won a Tesla
Wooooooooooko! Tyson is in trouble.
Hope wilder win
Wilder literally has the tweety birds in his head instead of a brain. He has no idea what the hell he’s doing! Lmao 😂
Fury gone win again 🤷🏾‍♂️
WILDER😤💯LETS GO
Headphones in a stairdpwn? Easier to focus on the music and distract the mind  when it gets intense.
Never seen an eye blinking eye contest this serious 👀
Tyson Fury's little brother gets fatter and fatter. Lmao Jonah Hill lookin assss. 😂
i can be super wrong but fury dosent look that confident as last fight with wilder  and wilder looks like a inner monster ready to kill not  sure whats coming from this fight
"2 TIME!!" 🗣️🗣️🗣️
I hope the actual fight would be longer than this staredown
I cant wait for this fight but this is so stupid lol
intense and awkward
I like how Wilder wore some big ass heeled shoes to take away the height difference. He actually looked slightly taller than Tyson
Stare offs going to be longer than the fight
I'm still annoyed that this fight is even happening 😒
Some say fury is still there
Tyson is going to kick his ass
Wasn't the match with joshua already planned?
Til dis day! Two times can be heard 'round the world.
Still pissed about the first fight 😤 #riggedGlove
That b!tch fury out his hands behind his back . Sign of guilt and submissive behavior.  It's like to dogs face off and the other dawg tucks his tail.  Fury rocking back n forth.  Nervously..  y'all can talk. All that shit about wilder if you want to ..it's still not gonna stop wilder fr.tryna kill this man. Fury cheating could have killed wilder.  It's already dangerous..they to big men.. but dam fury.  He was on that bullish. Cheating...dirty azzhole
All my money is is on Ddub!
Holy crap they sat there n stared at each other for awhile didnt they lol
Wilder listening to his Spotify playlist
Ducking fruads the lot of them we wanted fury vs AJ
Bum Squad 😄😄😄
Intense cool
What a bore-fest and a sign of what's to come. I really don't want to see the fight. There's no fun in watching Wilder getting another mauling! It's going to be worse this time because Wilder is going to try to use his new 'skills' and when he realises that he can't do it under the pressure of a re-match, he'll revert to his only weapon but he'll be out of it by then. I don't know why Tyson is even calling them pussies. It's just not worth wasting the energy on - leave it to the fight.
If Wilders head phones weren't 40 pounds he would have won the stare down lol 😂
He had to exit as those headphones were a bit heavy & his legs were weakening.
I smell death 💀
When the trailer park meets the hood. Lmao
Whoever is saying 2x is cringe asf!
Pointless fight
Wilder is laden with ego  which his  chin can’t  buttress.
Let's go! Legendary shit! I'm lit. Tyson been hitting the buffet. 😁
*Wilder kept all in till the day*  Remain to be seen...
Yep its personal
Wilder listened to a whole album lmao
Skinny jeans 👖 are getting popular in the heavy weight division !!!
unfortunately this was the actual fight.. apparently the sport of boxing was banned yesterday and all the professional fighters have been relegated to staring competitions..
Deontay fighting with his emotions, most likely will get Koed again. What a sore loser, I lost all respect to him after all the excuses and conspiracy theories.
So romantic 😂
How long did they just stand there?
Fury doesn't look confident .he doesn't seem ready for this
And that was some stupid shit...
It’s been heard around that he’s still saying “two time” till this day
Inspect THOSE GLOVES
Why is daft lad wearing sunnies and beats? Yanks 🙄
Photographers taking the same photo for 5 minutes.
They don't give a f*** for the media hahaha this is gold
LETS BE HONEST EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD KNO WHO THE MOST HATED CLASS OF MEN ARE THE ORIGINAL INDIGENOUS MAN AND THE FURY GUY GOING TO SLEEP IF THE WBC DONT CHEAT AND LET HIM TAKE THE STEROIDS AND TAMPER WIT THE GLOVES LIKE LAST FIGHT ,TRAINER SLIDING THE LEFT GLOVE. A NEW GLOVE NEVER FLOPS
Diantre is a joke I’m not paying for this shit supposed to be Joshua and Tyson corruption at it best
Wilder will kill  fury this time fury woke up a killa
They look exactly the same height. Someone’s lying
They are both monsters man.both 6 ft 8+ 😳.And me just 5ft 5 .😭.just imagine how would I look before them.son with father😂
Still facing off TILL THIS DAY!
and then they kissed for 6 more mins
DEONTAY “Two-Time” Wilder 😵🥊
Wilders next excuse … headphones was to heavy!!
Lol i had the same beats but it broke
Imagine if Wilder wins, that'll throw everything off😂
Legend has it, they're still staring TIL THIS DAY!
wow that helped ticket sale's you could feel both fighters on the brink of working out how many seconds in twelve rounds, then realised it would be a draw
Those headphones fucked my equilibrium thats why i lost the fight
If by any chance Deontay comes out with a win this thing between these 2  warriors will echo for all eternity, this thing between these 2 alphas will never end.
Tyson fury is fit and unfit at the both same time .
Their both a pair of shithouses... what a waste of time and money
The strange glove story will repeat this 3rd fight🤔
if only big john fury was here! bob arum sort that man a visa
Wilder is gonna make sure his corner doesn’t bring any towels to the ring 😂
This is terrible
where is dana ? :D
Wilder lost already body language says it all
Fury looks like a massive tree stump.. wilder is gonna kill him!!!
Someone is going to die
This is definitely an anime moment. I can see these guys' ki, riatsu, haki, nen, and killing intent.
Jeez this is awkward
damn i didnt know theres a third fight
Gotta love Shane fury always behind he’s brother
I hope Wilder loses.
Somebody is not being truthful about their height... Either they are both 6'9" or . . .
When someone wants the last slice of pizza 🍕 😂😂
Blinking contest😂😂😂
Team wilder says let him go. wonder how many of them get fired for making him lose 😂
I didn’t even know this was happening, it would be better if fury just fought Joshua
4:55 😂
I audibly said “when the F was this fight made and signed for a date?”. I legit haven’t heard any coverage on these two having no damn trilogy fight.
Fury won…again!
They may as well start playing that Celine Dion tune off Titanic for this 🎻🎻🎻🎤 every night in my dreams, i see you,i feeeeeeeeeautotuneeel youuuuuuuuuu
him still wearing his shades tells a lot. he's trying to hide behind them using it as a form of comfort
How many times?
But really how did they not start laughing lmao
Wilders broke. I actually feel sad.
jesus….. this is terrible absolutely terrible this sport is sad 😞 so good love boxing  just 0 entertainment and no characters….. they stood for 5mins doing nothing
Damn Wilder... You a millionaire but still be wearing Beats, look into getting a pair of Airpod Max or Sony XM4's...
The real Boxing...damnnnnnn !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4:45 the first words of the guy when he was born: “two times!”
What happened to Joshua
I'm a huge Fury fan and hope to God he wins this last match with Wilder. Wilder has nothing to loose and everything to gain. Wasn't like that the last 2. Makes him even more dangerous IMO
Are these the only two boxers being featured these days besides tik tokers like Floyd Mayweather and Jake Paul?
Lmao Tyson Fury built like a Lunchbox 😂😂😂
So cringe how he has his goons yelling bomb squad to gas him up, hahaha. Fury needs none of that, all confidence and skill.
2 times his a$$ beat
Up next.... paint drying
Tyson’s like  “Now he’s gone who else wants a stare down ?  How about you rock on the floor ?
At this very moment, Fury's still looking in Wilder's direction
And the NEW!!!!
...and still!
I thought he was gonna fight Joshua
Deontay hiding behind sunglasses and headphones. I'm surprised he wasn't wearing a hoodie.
I'm sorry but I hope wilder wins because I rather see him face Anthony J
Awks
Them after watching the Logan vs Mayweather face of: pffff that’s nothing I’ll show them
This is like the high school bully vs the rebel kid who ain’t got nothing better to do but poke the bear go toe to toe whooped his ass then rubbing it in but has respect for him cause they are different but one in the same
Tyson gulped and is scared.
Almost fell asleep during this stare down
He's listening to Crazy by Patsy Kline
Also I just wanted to point out Wilders pants being pretty slim. Like too slim. Tysons pants look horrible regardless. He got that jail body. That hood across Deontay waste though?? Its sad, almost like he misses his belt.
Dudes head is dented
Buuuuuuuummmmmmmm Squaaaaaaaaaad
Wilder looked scared
ppl says he still staying at this place
Get someone that looks at you like these 2 look at each other 😍
Two time
Damn and I thought the Mayweather Jake Paul stare down was long 🤣
I feel bad for fury he not going to be able to put anything in his gloves
It's pretty clear Tyson took the life out dat man. He killed a big part of that egotistical bully arrogant duetch. No more bomb squad no more with the low blows making fun of furys struggles with depression and drugs before Tyson met the Lord. Befor wilder bragging about his demons will beat furys Lord talking Alabama vudoo And shit. Fury spoke scripture that day and said about no weapon brought against me will harm me sayith the Lord Etc. But now he loses and suddenly his first words is thank Jesus Christ MY SAVIOR. I hope he did get saved certainly got humbled. I do think a piece of him died that day and I think he's making a mistake being more civil so to speak. Remember how cocky Coner McGregor use to be in the UFC? He was knocking every one out. Now when he had his second fight with Dustin Puoriae he was nice and friendly he changed his persona and he gets knocked out. This is the fight game not the friend business. It's a sign of being unsure of hisself. Lack of confidence. We will see though.
This same thing tyson did in sauna with klitchko, he already won 3rd match as well
Is it just me or does fury look shook😂
what is Wilder wearing? he looks like a dandy boy
Nobody, literally nobody wants to see this fight. What a load of shite.
Wow 24th of July I didn't know it was booked so quick...
I just got a feeling, I feel sorry for Fury and his fans that's been talking shit since the last fight
Can’t take wilder serious because he is doing a mug face after he lost 2 times in a row and is about to be 3😂
I would never look at another man’s face for that long or close.  It Is June 🤷‍♂️
This one to remember truth vs lier righteous vs unrighteous lets goooooooo bombbbbb squaddddd
They are actually having a conversation telepathically
Haha... Well damn! :)
Someone please fart!
And still.... Sauna Champion OF The World!
Everybody just refer to Wilder as the Black Plague. Because when he knocks the s*** out of Fury this time. AJ Will be ducking him like he was...
The definition of insanity  is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results, this is that
Deontay wilder left the jacuzzi 1st jus like his master vlad did
A 6 minutes stare down? Wtf
Wilder straight up cry baby ..not just that but fired his coach for throwing in the towel not realizing all the fights he won do to him ..I wonder who u going to blame this time or if u coming out with the same uniform looking like a Cinderella
Near the end you could see the fear in Tyson fury's face!!!! Deyonte is ALL straight business with NO distractions!!! Tyson better NOT underestimate Wilder,it will be a short night 💯
Wtf was superbad Jonah Hill gonna do 😅
Both Wilder and Fury are cringe asf if these were lightweights everyone would be laughing at them
Lol   who do u think blinked first?
That was waaaaay too long lol
Shiba inu coin !!!
Bummm  squad?
They were actually just trying to walk past each other, but got stuck in that thing where you both choose the same direction over and over
"BOMMbsquaD!."".BommSQUAd"!..etc,etc....4:30   "bumsquad?
This staredown is longer than Jake and Askew fight
Dana does it right. Ten seconds max then wrap it up.
Deontay already lost. Coming in with sunglasses on to hide his first initial eye contact and with headphones on. He’s scared and Fury already has his number. Gonna be another Win for Fury. Change my mind
Still rooting for Tyson. But Wilder might ACTUALLY be able to box now. If so, i don't know
Why are they fighting again ? 🤣
I’m still mad I lost 2k betting on detonatay last fight. Gonna sit this one out
1-0 to Tyson
tyson should be scared lol
Wilder is still in his feelings lol 😆
Деонтей победит но ему после боя надо будет срочно уходить на отдых,если ты Деонтей этого не сделаешь то к сожалению после придется все равно уходить но уже  побежденным, Деонтей победив Фьюри уйди красиво брат и это будет правильно,возраст уже  брат<возраст... Deontay will win but after the fight he will need to urgently go on vacation, if you Deontay do not do it, then unfortunately after you will still have to leave but already defeated, Deontay defeating Fury leave beautifully brother and it will be right, age is already brother<age
The problem is that Wilder's headphone were so heavy he couldn't move a inch, he was paralyzed by the extreme weight.
this coming fight will be a bad day for fury
Wilder will win this. Fury gaining weight again.
But why are the photographers still taking pictures?! They're like mannequins at this point.
this circus again lol
Lmao all I could picture was that sauna story Fury told about refusing to leave the sauna before Klitschko. No way he was looking away first lmao. Too stubborn.
i can tell by tysons body language and micro expressions , that he knows he is a changed man. and he may this time come back better and stronger. i saw nervousness from tyson.   i like tyson.. but i can feel he is worried a bit.
fury like 375lb. wilder like 260 tops. its gonna be another beat down wilder on his azz
Did Wilder learn how to box???  If not, same result
Now Wilder can blame Beats Headphones for spiking his water during the press conference
Tyson fury looking like melted ice cream.. That can beat the brakes off you
Hard for Wilder to talk his usual talk when he's standing in front of the 1 dude that has his number... 1st fight draw, 2nd fight clean win. Very obvious who the more skilled fighter is.
Photographers were shutter happy!
What times 7 =14?? Wilder (2times
I wanna see a body this time flinch
That was great!
Deontay listening to "A Thousand Miles" while staring down Fury *edit He left first because the song ended
Wilder looking like a killer.. damnn!!! this shit going to be insane.
2X LOSER
Lmfao fury face look funny
Fury beats him again vor sure
What was wilders bum boy saying I didn’t quite catch him?
Vamos wilder
That was the lamest face off I've ever seen
Why again? Boxing is so dumb.
At one point deontay wilder was going to be undisputed, boy have that been derailed.
Most annoying thing is when someone comes to a verbal fight and just repeats the same thing over and over and over.
It’s like one of them just randomly fall over from locking their knees lol
Wilder want him bad, looking right through to his Soul, ShitDamn!
Fury beat him twice wtf they rematching again for
Tyson was prepared to die in that staredown
Tyson "Rent Free" Fury.
When tf was this booked?😂
The most boring face off ever ..
Lmao wilder hateeeee this dudeee
Headphones and the little man acting cool😂🤡
Y is even fighting this guy again
I thought I paused the video by mistake
Too bad they didn’t 💋 to compete with YouTube fights
“ two time” guy got stuck in a loop  Lol
That was long for no reason. Wilder wasn't in the stair down. He was zoned out. Giving them verbal instructions made no sense if wilder can't hear them.
Just like this third fight and everything around it.... that was utter shite.
Me looking in the mirror, and picturing how i wanna look.
Damn my own girl don’t even look at me for that long🤦‍♂️
Didn't saw that coming.
Wilders a tiger,
Dude get closer take the headphones off and the sunglasses and act like you are present. You should have left well enough alone.
Wilder needs to get rid of that chihuahua, everywhere he goes he yaps and yaps. He is a bad omen to have on your side.
why they need a third fight ?
Wilder is knocking fury out cold, I can see it lol
2 times fury won
Some real fucking boxing
They fell in love with each other
Fury shaped like melted ice cream....😂😂😭😭
When deontay took his glasses off it looked like he was scared to reveal his face like it would show fury hes shook
I THINK THIS IS THE SECOND TIME WILDER WILL CRY & SAID " I WAS CHEATED BY TYSON FURY BY TAMPERED GLOBES. "
Fury thinks this is a mind game so he ain’t goi anywhere until he wins it
Why are they both avoiding Anthony Joshua?  Ugh…
Wilder wants that body on his record for real this time! Fury looked scared! First time I ever seen Fury scared of someone!!!! Lmao
Wilder is going for the KILL WITH CONVICTION...
Wearing headphones and listening to music during a staredown is kind of a bitch move. Must be so much more comfortable having the noise cancelled and listenting to your jam instead of just experiencing the lonely void of staring into another man's soul. In the end, he's still the one who looked away first.
Wilder's legs are tooth picks.
Lol this is a love fest, tyson is however Making a huge mistake, if he thinks it gonna be a walk in the pack, he's probably gonna get knocked out, running from aj like his partner/baby wilder did might just backfire on him
I like to think fury fell asleep with his eyes open and woke up at the end without knowing what happened
Tyson fury s ego seems intact to me. . 43 knockouts. About to be 44. Almost more knockouts than mike tyson had wins. Tyson fury goes night night this time. I love that he didn’t talk. Time to kill. No time for talking. Only bad thoughts. Hold them. Manifest them. Here comes the world wind. Hopefully fury starts wearing a shirt after this knockout. It’s a horrible sight.
How many times? I didnt get how many times. Please can someone help me? How many times??? Lol
I guarantee wilder will do a McCall
They start staring @0:25 Still staring @1:00 Yep @ 2:35 Wait did Wilder look away? Nope @3:45 This is getting awkward @4:15 Is anyone going to break this up? @5:30 Finally @6:02
Ya mun
Hopefully Fury just cleans this up inside 6 rounds to show how fucking pointless this bout was.
Tyson fury titties are at the wrong press conference!
Let's go bronze bomber
Wilder just might
This where a Riddic Bowe insident would of been awesome
Wilder is going to literally kill him yikes
It’s pretty pathetic when you’re training partner and cru have the run their mouth the whole time.. That dude kept saying 2 time, Yeah two times he already lost to fury
An all Heavyweight PPV sound borning as fuck tbh everything except the main event
Staring contest at its best
Bro is this real?
Gypsies love this kinda shit
Chicken legs wilder
You lost the staring contest pussayyy!
What a step down >:(
These two just had a stare down longer than I fuck my girlfriend... two times over... fml kms
Bomb 💣 squad 2 times ⏲️ 👌 wtf ppl get corny and corny 😒
Respect to both guys. That staredown was like watching a quiet storm brewing. (🧀)
Say two tie one more fucking time!!!
Wonder if they will get away with putting racism in fury gloves again
6:11 Tyson wondering if he left the lights on at home..
Wtf I thought he was gonna fight Anthony Joshua next!!!!???!? This is bullshit. No wonder boxing is dying and UFC is taking over. ...Wilder should be fighting Andy Ruiz next
10 minutes of silence from Borat is nothing compared to this..
What a joke boxing is!!!! This is not the fight that should be happening.  How do you sell this fight, every single person involved in this is a sell out including fury
Wilder looking focused and less distracted
Tyson!! All day
I'm surprised his hoodie around his waist didn't weight him and his wiggle legs down
Wilder looks ready
They are having an epic fight in an imaginary realm akin to an anime scene
Good thing Dana wasn’t in the middle “Alright guys good job” *Both continue to stare
Who tf keeps saying 2 time😂😂
My favorite person is the guy so stupid he got stuck on saying "2 times" on repeat. Nice to see people still doing make-a-wish's
For sum reason I thought fury was much taller. They are basically same height.  Love to know what fury is mumbling to wilder
2 Time my friends 2 Time
Wilder looked like he was staring death in the face
Would be crazy if Fury walked out jacked with a 6 pack... That'd be an interesting plot twist.
I want fury the fucking dosser to lose.
Bomb mfn squad
I am analyzing how much his headphones weigh along with the necklace cuz he might say that they affected his performance lol
Mike Tyson said it! Gay
They will remember this as long as they live
Ebony and Ivory  😂😂
Yooooo
This was unnecessarily long
2x what?
I can't wait see this but that wilder is a very strange character... 🤨
TILL DIS SAY
Ima call it. Wilder gets his 10 year belt back. Hahaha
Silly
All y’all got jokes in the comments but real shit I’m scared for tyson fairy, Wilders about to actually catch a body and fairy doesn’t even know it
The fight gone be these 2 staring at each other for 3 minutes after the ref says “touch gloves”
Legend says Tyson is still standing there to this day
I think tyson is right... wilder can switch out trainers but when the fight starts hes going to do what he does... try to k.o with big swings and that always gives him a chance but fury knows how to deal with him and i think its gina be the gypsy king with hands raised 💪
Why is he wearing 🎧?
Fury gonna dent his skull again
Bullshit rematch...Joshua should be stripped!
That was intense Dante is not playing
The fight that nobody wanted. But it’s happening.
Let's just hope he doesn't wear a 300kg metal knight suit to the ring again.
Tyson is going to put a serious beating on this man. Just a gut feeling. I like both fighters. But something tells me this is going to be bad.
Bust stupid
Wilder looking prepared proper but hopefully Tyson puts him back in his place again.
These guys are fighting again??
I Hope i had a wife That looks so at me
Looks like Tyson got smaller.
HIT!
I didn’t even know this was happening lol
fury built like a sack of potatoes
Does anyone care cus i dont tbh.
"DeoNtAy WIlDEr SCarEd"  -- Right, thats why he fought for the fight to happen and won an arbitration.
wilder is overrated and subpar much like his headphones
Wilder is a scared ass with his headphones on so Tyson won't get in his head lol Tyson owns his soul
They’re emotionally in love 😁 jokes aside that stare down got boring
Lil wilder doesn’t know many words besides “2 times”.
Fury looked hella sad, when wilder walked away 🤣🤣
Round 1 to Tyson 😂..let's see what the deontay brings this time.
Fury took wilders soul he ain't the same
Yep, we all know how this will end.
A world record of pictures were taken this day!!!
How long  u been staring at each other  Deontay wilder : TO THIS DAYYY
3:25 wilder blinks. Fury won that stare down
like a legend about 2 bi rocks facing each other ...they used to be 2 heavy weight dossers
And paying bills for that b
I can say Wilder got this
"mental victory" it's like Klitschko and the sauna all over again
Imagine if wilder wins
So it’s a new thing those mangers talk shit for them.  Fight face up 2.0 version 😅
How many of these are they going to do? Fury outclasses the guy twice already. Where's the Joshua fight!?
Oh man, this is gonna be some war! Gypsy King all the way! 💪🏼👑
Wilder gettin slept TWO TIMES
I pray Wilder actually prepares for this fight. He didn't take the last one seriously. He honestly thought he did well with the first fight.. he's gotta have more dimensions to his game if he wants to take on Fury.
Long awkward look 😂I’d be sh*****g my pants
Fury win
Wow. Is this some kind of meditation? Maybe they should have been left alone to concentrate. 😀
Awww they love each other
Prediction it's goin to be a one sided beat down for wilder guaranteed
The only one that can beat Fury is himself.... FACT....
This is the body that should be caught...
Boooooooo.. throw a punch   Jess hilarious voice  #V
Unless wilder learned some boxing technique... he doesn't have a shot at all
how does fury have any motivation to fight this guy
I had to leave .. Is he still standing there?
I don't see the hype in this, I like Wilder but Fury completely outclassed him the first & second time
After the sauna story, you just knew Tyson would've stood there all week
always love a comeback story, i wont be mad if theres an upset with this one
Great a fight no one wanted for the third fucking time...
Another mental victory for Fury.
When you cant stand still and keep trying to be funny that's how you know you are scared Wilder just kept looking at him dead in his eyes no words bruh idk but call 911 after this fight 😂😂😂😂
Those camera noises annoying asf
Deontay was just starting in to nothingness, no focus just a pathetic attempt at intimidation
Whites.gonna win again
No one wanted this fight. It’s just easy work for fury.
Wilder lost twice already. Go home.
Let me find out wilder has platforms on!!. He looks like he grew a few inches. Also Fury drops him within 4
More interesting than the fight is going to be
This fight is a waste of everybody's time LOL
Is that man yelling 2 time a schizophrenic??
Looks like fury just ate two KFC family buckets all to himself before the face off 👊🏼
The foolishness of pride
Old friends that like the glory just as much neither one wants skill it's a tussle for Hussle picking blue Berry's and sipping tea is t What they'd rather do turn tevo back watch it in slow motion so yous see a real fight
Deontay a coward loool
Why is he wearing headphones?
I think Deontay will win this fight.
It's now or never for deontay wilder... Boooooooooomb squad
2:56 can you guys face forward now Them: nah I don’t think so
Wilders egos disgusting
Get a room guys
Let go the bomber
All I see is anger and self-control from Wilder, and fear from Fury. Its gonna be interesting.
Some say Tyson is still standing this TO THIS DAY! TO THIS DAY!
*_THAT STAREDOWN LASTED LONGER THAN JOE BIDEN'S MEMORY._*
Tyson fury gonna have an easy win
Tyson Fury: _Ping 450_ Deontay Wilder: *Ping 9000*  _Deontay Wilder left the game_
Deonty only wore them head phones so fury wouldn't damage what little ego he has left walking into this fight
Fury is the only Brit I have ever rooted for, and I will be again. I hope he smashes Wilder. Oh and he won that staredown 😂
You can see the guilt on cheater fury.
They are just playing who "blinks first"
6 fucking minute stare down 😂
man if wilder wins this time and we dont get fury joshua because of this ima be so pissed
Ajekun Iya ni o je, ajekun Iya ni o je,eni ti o Le dani mu to n de na de ni, ajekun Iya ni o je.(till this day)?ole buruku
This press conference tells me Deontay is fooked.
🚨🚨Wonder What Wilder Listening To With Those Headphones... Best Advertisement Ever. Block Out Everything...🚨🚨
Why does wilders hype man keep reminding everyone that his boy deontay lost twice
Why does Wilder look taller than Fury?
Tuta tuta tuta tuta tuta
Nice to see that Jimmy two times from Goodfellas is alive and  back in full form.
"Two time" yes we realize wilder lost twice. Three's a charm.
Wilder in 3 years : "Still standing here ... TIL THIS DAY!"
The Gypsy King will win for the 3rd time!!!
Goliath v.s. Goliath....🤐
Fury still looks intimidating in pajamas.
Fury winning yet another mental battle, this guy is elite
I can feel the sexual tension between these two.
What excuses wilder gonna make this time??
Wilder got nothing to say hahahahahaha maybe he don’t want to tire out his legs
This is by far the most worthy  biggest hyped fight in my lifetime. These guys both deserve more recognition and hype than any Floyd Mayweather "exhibition"/fake fight.
500million clicks later .
Fury is a cheater
that guy:  Yaayy we won!  i'm dying
If Wilder can show up with more than two punches he’s OK
They are still there TO THIS DAY
I never understood why they let the fighters entourage  climb up the stage. First, their not the ones who’s going to fight. Secondly, they don’t need to wear sunglasses while inside a damn building. Lastly, “2 time” guy is fucking annoying. He’s only acting tough so his friends at home can see him act tough on TV.
and Fury is still there 'Till This Day!'
If Wilder comes back and beats Fury wouldn’t justify the way he went around getting this fight but you’d have to give him respect for not just wasting all our times
Their team did the talking, hype men everywhere 🥴🥴
The things they would do to avoid fighting Joshua
Take your headphones off ya Pusey
Wilder will kill him... 2 times!
Wilders crew don’t realize fury’s crew are lunatics and have been fighting as long as they could crawl they would up end that place and them in a second lol
How many fucking photos do you need
Another minute and they'd fall in love
Wilder going to KO Fury. Wilder doesnt care about talking only throwing hands and knocking Fury out.
Furys eye lashes won in the 10th round.
This is still a lose lose situation for Wilder because whether he wins or lose other boxers gonna say it took him three times to beat Tyson fury 🤡🤡🤡
So what happens when Wilder gets ktfo again? Fury-Wilder 4?
That was a long ass faceoff
Wtf is this lmao, a stare contest
Fury look worry and scared
I cant wait to comeback and flame these comments.
2 time... fury stomped your boy 2 time...  now 3. 17 out of 19 rounds being stomped out 2 tishhhhhhhhh
I think that the whole thing that happened was for marketting, AJ is the only true boxer
They both need some Visine 😳
Fury dominates stare down, wilder is in it for the pay day knockout loss he will be receiving from the gypsy king💯💯
Honestly everybody already thinks this fight is rigged
Tyson Fury is the biggest cheater, real boxing fans has ever seen in the history of the sport !!!!
Fat head beezlebub Tyson fury probably ate Cheetos before he got there
This going to be bad
What a childish faceoff.  “The first to look away or turns, looses”
Philosopher fighter
menace to society
Wilder is gonna get KTFO! And have a bunch of bitch ass excuses after. He won’t blame it on his costume because he will come in with a tutu and a tiara!
I think everyone is going to be shocked when deontey avenges the loss. He seems different he looks focused and angry. He has nothing to lose in the fight no pressure. Deontey is bringing the gold back to America. Also for those of you wondering why he kept his headphones on the whole time. He lost the last fight so there’s nothing he can say to intimidate or hype up the fight he is laying all his chips on the table this fight if he avenges the loss he can talk as much as he wants but if he talks now first if he looks silly cause he just lost so there’s no intimidation and if he loses it just looks worse on him that he talked a lot leading up to the fight.
This is just bad. Logan and Floyd had a better press conference and that says a lot
My prediction: Tyson Fury, to absolutely knock Wilder out, in or before 3rd round. BOOM !!
Wilder looks in shape and fury looks like fury
Their both snowflakes,, fury landed at the toughest gym in Detroit and made it his home?? Yet it’s their home territory?? Fury is boxing’s Marshall Mathers
His ears still bleeding that's why you have the earphones on
Furry gone knock his ass out
When was this announced? This is th first I’ve heard of this fight
How stupid
Cruiserweight vs Super Heavyweight‼️🤣  Oan: Idky ppl still think the stare down IS the fight smh
who is making the money again 3is going to be different from 2 donate the money this sucks .Are you Dana white 4,5,and 6 rematch
Two Dime? True Crime? Due Time? Food line? Who mine? Too Lime!   Two time
Fury is fuking afraid
If only Wilder could fight as good as his teams chirps then maybe he’d won the last fight 😂 Tyson gonna own that once again 💯💯💯
Tyson looking..... Well like Tyson
Tell that lady to shut her mouth. Let the men do the more important work here.
can still see the weakness in wilder, hes like a insecure dog showing his teeth, n fury like the alpha chill as fuck lol, wilder looks up to fury
you know when someone's mentally ill when they repeat themselves several times in one minute!
Wilder is gonna be completely destroyed!
"two time" lol
Is Deontay wearing lifts
Wtf are they doing
Sums different about wilder
I don't believe wilder wants it seems a show
Wilder +220 on the ML $$$ All Day
Who else started to read the comment section ?
No  Flappy ass wrist or cheating
Taking a million pictures of the same shite
4 hours laturr... (spongebob narrator voice)
Would have rather watched Fury vs Joshua but we will find out if Fury completely stole Wilders soul 👊
This one seems low energy.
Just enjoy the stare down and look forward to the fight.. everyone got an opinion these days. You a mind reader or something kmt.
Wilder look taller. How is fury 6'7?
The boxing stare downs are fucking akward.
God what is with black people repeating the same stupid things over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over?
Deontay with his headphones on so he cant hear the abuse. Hes taking away one of his own excuses that he can use when he gets done in hahaha. This is how much brains hes got
I literally took a shit during this whole video and was done b4 these two lmao 🤣
Everybody wants to kill each other more than Tyson and deonte lmao
pmsfl all that bling weighed down his skinny ass legs 🤣
Someone said the meme at 3:10 😭
This is gonna be a good one
Wtf is this hahaha 😂🤣🤣🤣 the guys in the back ground had a better face off
Wilder want to fight now,dam fury you in trouble
Legends say fury still standing
I just went to Walmart & when I got bac they were still look’n @ each other
Why are they geh?
BUM SQUAD
LMAO!!! WILDER IS SUCH A BITCH!!! FURY OWNS HIM!!! WILDER KNOWS IT, WHAT TYLE OF MAN COMES TO A FIGHT TO LET ANOTHER MAN SPEAK FOR HIM, TO A MAN HES FIGHTING FOR NOW THE 3RD TIME AND STILL HASNT BEAT HIM, WILDER SHOULD BE KISSING FURYS FEET.. EVEN TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER SHOT..
Why do Wilder look taller or almost the same height
omg, this fight again? I'm confused, didn't Fury knock the hell out of this dude last time? Why is there a trilogy? This should be Fury vs. Joshua, but there is so much politics that these clown promoters can't get these fights done
You think they got enough pictures?
"Heee cant hear youuu" LOL ><
God dam,I can’t wait for this ooohhh
Fury was ready to break the Guinness Record for standing still.
Yelling two time like AJs camp.. Wilder is a wasteman
Wilder listened to a few songs in that time, making the most of those headphones
the only two time for wilder is a two time ass whoopin
There's only 1 tyson fury
Yo the sexual tension might make the room explode.
Wilder gonna get hurt Bra
Wilder took those sunglasses off wuick must’ve been weight his head down
Honestly did this stare down have to be this long?
how the hell did tyson fury shrink in size?
When you're at your fight staredown and next thing you know jonah hill starts talking sh!t to you.
What a pointless fight. Deontay is such a sore loser for this.
"Toothime" 🤔... Must be an Egyptian pharaoh Wilders team where trying to conjure up 🤷🏻‍♂️
TILL THIS DAY.
3-0 fury
Str8 thuggin lol fury
goddamn this is a long ass faceoff
TWO TIME
Now i believe the story with Wladimir and the sauna lol
What e clown wilder this time he going to lose bad just watch
I thought this was a boxing card... no main evnt like a Pokimane vs Mayweather Sr.fight? or maybe pick one of the current really good mma boxers... like a Royce Gracie...
Two-time!!!
Wilder =angry, bitter, insecure, broken Fury= ready, confident and with  Wilders soul in his belly.
Fury rolling with that dad bod....flexing...😂
Just kith already Mike Tyson voice
Fury said he's had 18 months to train  On what he's gunna do this time  Thought they only found out about trilogy fews weeks ago !!!
Fury- "ANY EXCUSES TONIGHT WIDER?!!"
Who keeps shouting ‘TWO TIMES’ 😂😂😂 Wilders camp is an absolute mess  In other news though… it’s coming home 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Kinda gay
Wilder looks different....
Wilder is going to get bullied in this fight again
The guy at the yelling Two Time needs to shut up.  I was thinking bruh please stop... so annoying
Why does wilder look same Height as fury
I just have a really bad feeling about this fight I am a huge fury fan and want he to smash AJ to bits  but I don't think they will ever fight I just have a really bad feeling tyson will lose this fight AJ will lose to usyk then usyk vs wilder what usyk will win them fury will beat usyk let's see if I am right
The self awareness , confidence and sarcasm of Tyson are part of his persona. Ah, love handles too. An icon. What a champion!
There will be no excuses this time. Whoever loses,is done. I don't hear no more shit about the gloves. I don't want hear no more excuses from either side. If Fury loses,he was just a fluke,who probably use tampered gloves. If Wilder loses,he was just a sore loser that couldn't accept defeat. This it it. I don't care who you hope win,if he loses, don't make no excuses him. That's all I'm saying.
Only one boxer here.
Legends say hes still Sayin two time
“2 time! 2 time!” “Sir you good?” “.....2 time” lol
Words were never really going to hype this fight up anyway as its the plan B fight.
Why in hell Tury s gonna fight this guy for the 3 time , he has everyting to loose..
First time I’ve heard of a trilogy when the contestant already has 2 certified L’s  If wilder wins they’ll have to do a 4th! Crazy
he's standing for too long man, Wilder is gonna get tired before the fight
ever heard the Fury Kitscho sauna story?? this is mental warfare, even a little thing like a faceoff... gotta love it ahahah
Wilder is going to fire Malik now after he pulls him from the stare down early 5:56
a literal waste of 5 minutes
I hope wilder has really improved,  gonna be interesting if he has, if he hasn't it won't be interesting.
WoW!! Wilder with his headphones is  Psychologically beaten already!!😆
wilder looks lichees reads to catch a body. a man who's got everything to lose, and everything to prove is dangerous.
It looked like Fury is living rent free in Wilders head. Man up and handle the L. Move on from the loss or be doomed to repeat it.
…I passed out twice during this stare down…woke up twice and they still staring each other out ffs…
Even the cameras stopped taking photos
Did someone say "Two time!"? Rewound it over and over but still can't tell for sure. 😆
The Bum squad is terrified!
An *amoeba* vs a *jaguar* - what a show off! 😂😂😂
Just cause wilder had headphones on doesnt mean he scared. He has a clear mind on what to do and what not to do. Last times he was boutrous and loud. Now hes silent and waiting for his actions to speak louder then words
For some off reason i just want fury to be knocked out and be history already
They like sculptures bruh
Fury looking concerned lol. U British people have no idea how much heart   an determination DW has lol ☠💀☠💀☠💀☠💀👿💀☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠☠💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤
Wilder looks like a zombie cause fury took his soul in the 2nd fight.
If I were Tyson Fury I wouldn't be giving this ONE TRICK PONY another crack. I don't rate Wilder in my top 50, he can knock people out but he can't fight. When matched against someone his size that can fight he collapsed like a a house of cards. I can't wait to see what his excuse will be for losing this time. Tyson Fury all day everyday and twice on Sundays, especially against a PRETENDER of Wilders low calibre.
If Deontay loses, it's because his pants were too tight.
"What is happening" be quiet.
This fight so isn't needed.
Wilder gonna knock Tyson out..is the way wilder looking
Wilder listening to Katy Perry the whole time, close sources said.
For fucks sake whoever is saying two time needs to get run over, and then reversed back over
Fury would never lose a staredown. I remember the legendary story of him in the sauna for hours against klitschko.
fat bastard vs BB
Wilder looks lost
Why is fury’s ass so high?
This fight feels off rhythm
So...wilder vs fury 3. Who do you guys have winning?
They aren't staring down, it's just Deontay Wilder listening to Taylor Swift and being sentimental while Tyson Fury thinks he's staring him down.
Shit ganna be litt
2 time!!!!…. Loser
Tyson wins
So much shirs happened in the world since they fought last. But its only been 17 mos.
Guys stop staring at each other... Go and prepare for the fight... 🙄🙄
If Fury pressures Wilder like he did in the 2nd fight, we will have the same results.
Have they signed another rematch clause just in case wilder can't get lucky again?
"Mom I want fury Vs Joshua" "No we got fury Vs wilder 3 at home"
So wilder is fighting a telly tubby ??? 😆😆😆😆
The 2 time guy is really proud of how many times hes read a book. Gee whiz
Two times
Bomb Squad???? more like Skittle Squad lol
Look like a lil mommas cooking in there.... 🤏🏾👀
Why is Wilder not steady? He still wobbling.  Fury whoops him again easy.
No one cares about this fight!!!! Both used Joshua for clout!
Make sure you don't have your big suit on this time wilder... no excuses this time please you big dosser
Let’s go wilder BombZquad 💣
Fury Molly wops Wilder again ...
Is it just me or did these 2 look like they about to start making out 🤣🤣
Wilder gunna give Fury's bitch ass the work this time around no doubt furt was the better fighter that night but Mark my words Wilder getting his belt back
I’m a Wilder fan, but he shouldn’t have left that staredown first. If I had to stay there til tomorrow I would have
This is love!
Wilder was listening to Miley Cirus🎧 During the face off
Longest face off ever damn😐🤔
With that long stare down, Both fighters appear to be in Great Condition, Fury seemed to have a bit more conditioning in the latter part of the Stare down as Wilder started to fade. 😂✌
Almost feel bad for Wilder. Tyson is just the better warrior. It is what it is.  Spartacus was still a badass but Leonidas bodies him. Same here.
Its time to unleash those hands of fire..burn whole ur opponent..
What is the point of fighting fury again a third time. His only chance is a lucky punch and then what? We all know he would lose a rematch
wilders chin sticks so far out its an easy target
Destroy him Tyson! Break his jowls...whatever the fuck that is! Fuck the Bumba Klaat Squad!
This is funny how the cheating king body's look like 🤣🤣🤪
I don't think the actual fight will last that long 😂
Shane fury is a legend
In case anyone missed it, he said ‘two time’.
Both can fight they ass off though
Wilder is embarrassed and so he should be, he got his headphones on cos he knows he got knocked the fuck out after being beat the first time despite the draw, pussy, can’t wait for him to get knocked out again
Rocky vs clubber... Rocky wins AGAIN!!!
Hopefully he doesnt come out in a fucking 40lb suit this fight😝
I saw video of wilder ACTUALLY SHOWING boxing skills unlike before he might shock some people
Wtf why so long
I've no idea how "two times" adds any intimidation!!! Wilder is soiling himself, thats why he isnt speaking! Fury to smash the bronze bummer!!!!!
They look like to strong idiots
Tyson wins this but I hope Wilder brings a good performance. Great fighters.
2️⃣⏱
The guy repeating 2times, get him into the ring
Vividly remembering what we witnessed in the two fights they had...me,personally, I don't need to see a third fight. ...Tyson give him the Fury
Fury gonna end Wilder's career now.
Fury aka the wilder soul snatcher
This stare down lasted longer than most fights .... #lovebirds
I wish somebody would have shut up that idiot that keeps saying two time.
Tyson gonnna school him again
If you're going to show up with headphones at least have some audiophiles grade headphones on and not boosted bass garbage
This reminds me of Jet li and IP man guy fighting just that thier was done with eyes closed 🤣
Some say Tyson Fury is still standing there, waiting
It's not a wise move dressing Wilder in denim, he's too weak to talk!
Fury gonna box circles around him again
I don't know what is going on in their head for standing their like electric pole.
Wilders gonna get smashed again that's just how it is
The trilogy no one asked for. They jus milkin their history for a quick payday before Fury fights Joshua, Fury ain't a gud person to bet against he holds his shii down time n time again gotta respect the man n give him tht hasn't been wrong yet. But I don't think he wants to fight Joshua. At this rate AJ gonna fight either Whyte or Ruiz before him n Fury fight. Hell usyk prolly will fight AJ before Fury.
Are people actually excited for this?  No, didn’t think so.
Wilder is about to send Fury to the Upper Room permanently 😂
Wilder got whooped by Charlie z.
You blinked.
Tyson, reppping for all the dad bods out there.
Wilder always skips leg day
I like Tyson I like Wilder but you can see it in Tyson eyes he see something different about Wilder he know he got to bring his A-game Wilder is serious it's going to be a good fight real talk
Tyson shoulda broke down laughing when Wilder took his glasses off
I think wilder has learned a thing or two. I hope for his sake he continues to keep it together because he was getting unusually wild and talkative before the last fight. He might still get his ass handed to him this time as well anyway.
How many pictures they need for this staredown?
should be AJ infront of Tyson smh most useless Trilogy if ever seen mma > boxing
Fury is the most bad built champ ever
More hype for logan vs mayweather
No one from the promotion even near and they didn't go after each other. UFC wouldn't happen this way.
This is was like the family guy episode where peter had a hard time ordering food and he literally stood there at the restaurant counter for ages.
actually fuck boxing
The amount of disrespect that people give wilder is just insane to me
Deontay looks taller than tyson there.......2 time 🤣
Fury is using his sub conscious mind on his training using only his visualization he will beat wilder with less effort just by using his mind
Wilder’s done. Dude is already exhausted now. Bombsquad bitches saying TOO TIRED!
How many pics can u get out of this DAMN
Who else reading the comments until one of them breaks?
Shane furey is so dam fat
Wasn’t supposed to be Fury vs Joshua?
Fury looks like he gained weight for this fight
Another fight???
Wilder don’t be walking in with your stupid ass costumes
Fury will struggle this time wilder has got that killer look back ,,,,,how many gulps did fury take while staring at each other omg ....
Fury been eating them strawberry cup cakes
TU-TA!
I like Tyson but his brother all talk lmao
Even if Wilder wins it still just ties them up 1-1 then I guess we will need a fourth fight. Lol
Till dis day...
Boxing sucks MMA is where it’s at!
Were they about to kiss eachother?
This is the Dumbest face-off I ever seen, One has headphones not saying a word the other looks like he belongs on Bum fights!   What happend to the days of Roberto Duran and Mike Tyson press conference??!!  Bad for boxing iam sorry.
Something tells me this stare down will be more interesting than the fight itself
Some say they are still facing off till this day. TILL THIS DAY!
I wish I had a body like Tyson Fury
Fury looks out of shape 😟
Buuummm sqaaauudd!
Fury got caught cheating loss the case now he gotta survive a deontay wilder out for revenge👑🥊
Fury is in Wilders Head, he broke him.
Wax can beat em both
Wilder is  going to catch another beating
That right there was a declaration from Wilder. No retreat and no surrender on this merry-go-round.
Deontay heard about the sauna story between Fury & Wladimir... He couldn't help himself 🤣
Tyson will out box him again
The heavyweight fight no one wants.  I'm not paying to see this again.  What a bunch of crap.  Don't waste your money.
Shame on you fury, shame on you!😳
Same fight same result..  GYPSYKING..
Fury rocking the classic dad bod!
Fury is nervous. Scared straight. I can look at him and tell easily.
2x bruh shhhh
One thing's for sure two things for certain all Tyson fury has to do is play defense and let his big clumsy ass come to him and its game over.. absolutely no reason to play offense whatsoever other than counter... 100% victory if he does it..Tyson fury already has the belt you don't need to prove what he's already proven , deontay Wilder's the one that needs to play offense here..
Who’s the nobody mouthing off in wilders Fanny pack
"Don't everybody believe in goo goo" ~ Deontay Wilder
Such a pointless fight. Fury already beat wilder twice id say.
I wanna see Logan Paul call out Deontay wilder
Put ya backs into it ‘tiresome’
Fury won the battle, just like in the sauna story. Btw, fuck the two time NPC.
Bum squad
Sad when ya have to say the same thing over and over
lets be real the 1st fight was no draw tyson won both fights and after all the embarressing bollox he talked after loosing from his suit being too heavy to he had a horse shoe in his glove tyson will want to hurt him this time combined with not letting him have the super fight with joshua , he got exposed last time as a shit boxer whos only weapon is a haymaker
I bet Tyson will come this time 290lbs+
It's like they're in a Sauna or something...
Insha allah fury kamu menang lagi
Hope this time it’s no cheating involved
wilder has to have better head movement this next fight
why the fuck are they fighting again, it should 110% be joshua vs tyson, i can’t be assed with these again
“Fore eyed prick” 🤣🤣wtf
Fury better take Wylder seriously.
We want Fury vs Joshua we are done with this cmon
Wilder will take this fight more seriously. The eye of the Tiger
Did wilder learn how to box yet? Or is he still banking on lucky punches?
I wish this was Joshua I’d be hyped af
I heard Tyson and Wilder still staring eachother down   TO DIS DAE!
wilder needs to make a "till this day" shirt i would definitely cop
Wait trilogy is on?
Fury looking soft and flabby.
Didn't even know they were fighting, the promoter could have done a much better job. These social media boxing matches had more promotion.
Fury with ultimate Dad Bod.
Tysons reach is crazy
American argue by saying the same thing multiple times, each one trying to be louder than the last.
Tyson beat him just right here
I thought the Fight to make was Tyson Fury and A.J?
wilder wearing lifts
For the 3rd fight wilders ring walk will be him with a Borat Mankini
It's the best focus wilder i have ever seen!!!!!
After a point it just looks gay !
2 times fury beat him 2 times he made excuses 2 times he got knockdown. Wilder can't forget 2 times.
Tyson fury about to be a dead man 😂
Some bucks just don't learn and need to be broken over and over again
That wss the gayest stared own ive ever seen, nobodys gonna end it?? No fuvkin way every boxing staredown goes until one guy backs down
Thank god the real boxing is back .
Seen this fight, want to see Fury fight Joshua.
What a joke we have to sit through this again
Wilder gets destroyed and humiliated so he brings in the the worst fighter he's ever fought who took a dive in the 1st..... 🤣
You on point now Wilder never play with your enemy and show no mercy!
all you David price lovers who hated fury are all in here making love to fury now. sheep baa baa
I can only imagine the list of excuses the wilder fans are going to be forced to come up with after the dust settles in this fight, no doubt it will be just as hilarious 😂
Deyonte looks scared
The longest staredown in history
" HOW MANY TIME? "..
Tyson is listed 6'9 while wilder is 6'7 but in this face off, they looked exactly at the same height. They both wear shoes too.
Wam is straying competition 😂😂😂
Most entertaining was the fat guy behind Fury started talking shit ... Idk what's the big hype about this 😅
I feel like I’d just zone out and start making my grocery list
wtf
WHO cares Boxing is dead
What happen fury vs aj?
Yes sir i really think this fight going to be better than the last one I got to see this one real talk
They both look stoned as fuck
I’m with the Brits on this one ☝️
So much politics there but dam that was intense!
I say in the third round wilder we'll stumble due to  scrawny legs unable to hold him up because he's unbalanced lmfao.
CMON FURY!!
Bumsquad!
Deontay wilder is one of the most hated boxer.  Literally getting lawyers involved because his ego has a booboo
GAAAYY!! ;)
Cheater
Is...is someone gonna go stand in between them to end the staredown, or....?
The latest trend, the extended stare down.
Idk man wilder looks focused an ready, I dont see him losing this one. Tyson will have the better record against him but I see wilder winning for some reason
I hope Tyson fury gets what he deserves for cheating.
Bro..its gonna be some Heavy bag hitting in this fight
I wonder if Wilder wore to headphones to subconsciously remind Fury of the guy he's running  from.
I hope Wilder has a plan.
I think and hope fury wins, but for the firs time ever I do feel as if Wilder will be a bigger threat for some reason. He really feels he destroyed his life lol
3:10 Till this day 😂😂😂  Edit: still dying from that clown who said that 😭😭😭
Me as a camera man: *takes 3 photos* "and I'm out of here, got all I needed"
Hopefully Tyson stays quiet being a big mouth didn’t work out so well for his girlfriend Saunders. But then again wilder is no where near the fighter Canelo is so who know I will be paying for this one
All Those people making pictures, arent all the same????
Who is the fat curly headed one acting big behind fury lol
headphones + sunglasses = still shook
Win or lose, Fury is the better fighter.
TOO'TZAA!
Bumsquad more like 😂
Deontay just jamming💀
They both were thinking wtf am I doing
No need for words. This stare down sells this fight 😲
BUM SQUAD
“You four-eyed prick” 😂😂 I ain’t heard that insult since year 3 what a vintage cuss!😂😂😂😂😂😂
First fight was a draw. Second fight Wilder got his ass beat. This is a pointless fight. Wilder needs to earn his rematch.
2 tie!! 2 losses! lmaoo
lmao wilder gotta keep the headphones on cuz he doesnt want to hear all the shit about his lame ass excuses LMAO that shows how weak this man is
Two-time... He must have serious issues...
These youtube niggas getting more paid then these dudes.
Easy money for tyson
they making a whole movie series
I fucking knew tyson would not look away! Mental game master....if you know about the steam room with klitchsko , you knew tyson would stand there ALLLLL DAYY
Eye roll they both trash.
Tyson gets to 300lbs hes going to smash him.
That's man only knows to words, 2 time.
Fury will lose like the guy Canelo beat and broke his eye socket and  then quit.
The dude in the white trying to trigger a situation because he is standing behind fury. Tyson only won once and so did wilder. Tyson needs to check his ego because he could lose as much as he could win. Js.
The one guy to the right of deontay looks like a lighter skinned wesley snipes
Tyson looks mad scared
Two time
fury won the staredown..
What a waste of my time!!
Them headphones look heavy
Wilder's taller than Fury?
I do not care who wins at this point! Just bring it and leave it in the ring. 🥊🥊 P.S Deontay pls just come to the ring with ya gloves on, no hats no masks. Thank you in advance
Damn thats a long ass stare down
This is some real fighting. This gonna be a banger🤝
Tyson's gonna Shred him
Wilder can get up there and act serious and intimidating.  Doesn't change the fact he knows Fury beat his ass and he knows it.  All that tough guy bravado goes out the window after the 1st rd.  There is no way he could've changed what it would take to beat Fury.  With that said it's the same old shit.  He's going to try and get creative to land the big Right hand.  This fight really comes down to Fury.
I see a  different deontay wilder Tyson fury just might be in a lot of trouble
How many time?
Damn where's the security, or the Dana white in-between the guys, I mean one blow it all it would take to have serious affects on the fight happening or not, all it would take is a nasty cut and fights postponed
Wilder 0-3 after first two fights and the stare down! Cant wait to see Fury slap that Wambulance!
Where’s Deontae’s “egg weight shaped indentation “ I don’t see it. Maybe he’ll make better excuses after his 3rd lost to Fury.
Let's go bomb squad 😂 like a bunch of little kids in their own little gang, terrorising bugs and worms in their parents backyard. Ooooh, scary! Bum squad, two time, bum squad! Feckin eejits.
Epic
When you leave the game on to go do other sh**
Why do I have the urge for some blancmange...
Amazing how many Americans are backing the non American. Wonder why. Hope everyone keep that same energy after the fight; DON'T HIDE.
Wilder lost. Just like vladimir in the sauna.
That was weird. Hoping for the super rare double knockout.
Tyson looking worried
Wilder REALLY wants this. To him this fight is EVERYTHING
😳
Haha this is like the Sauna story all over again!! 😂😂
Damn he never looks in shape rather  he is a shape.
Detonate already lost
Guy in the background ' To this day '. Had me cracking up 😂
If you didn’t know these two were about to fight you’d think they’re both gay as fuck. That’s some serious eye contact
The bum Wilder needs to loose the gangster act.. Big mouth got silenced and humbled their last fight. I hope Fury sends him to sleep this time
Wilder ready to catch a body
Wilder a little girl lol he knew he couldn't handle fury's words so he had to wear head phones
That woman got blanked 😂
Anyone stare at me that long they falling in love 100%
I will smoke some weed to this day.
Yes Tyson Fury The Gypsy King haha Nock this bum out again and love on to your destiny  Aj. Hope u both come threw 3rd first healthy especially you Deontay haha come on tyson
Looks like he's actually lost some weight.     Wilder i mean.
Damn Tyson looks like a muffin
The lame peak serologically waste because tv contextually remain till a tasteless floor. aromatic, efficient lily
Booooomb Squaaaaad💣💣💣💣💣
Deontay with the platform shoes on
Why isn’t Jake Paul calling out wilder lol. Always picking on retired guys.
Shane giving it large at the end had me rolling
tyson after the fight will say i beat him from the stare off 😂
i just imagine during that staredown out of all the thoughts coming one of them must've like "damn he had nice lips tho, dude wtf"
Tyson after the 2nd fight will think he’s gonna beat wilder easily. Wilder has been away and training hard getting better with his actual boxing game and footwork. Not saying wilder will win. But it will be much closer. And one of those bombs landing is always dangerous
Peace, Islam is the truth. Read the Qur'an
Damn these bomb squad guys getting smart. They have learned 2 new words.
Tyson isn't 6'9
Till dis day
“It's hard to get out of bed in the morning to go for a run when you're sleeping in a transformers costume”
This is one of the weirdest videos i've ever seen.  The weirder thing is: Millions of people watch two man staring each other for 6 minute?
TWO TIME
Awww they looking at each other’s eyes like they are in love😂😂 wilder brought headphones to avoid fury getting into his head
All that money and he's got beats headphones on 😆
Tyson seemed bored and disengaged. This isn't the fight he wanted.
Literally stare down
The fact that there is even a 3rd fight happening is so lame.. everyone already sees tyson as the winner so what does he have to gain from a third fight..
I really hope we don’t get Deontay Milder this time
Wait this happened? How come i didnt know about it.. oh i know. BECAUSE NOBODY FKING CARES ABOUT 3RD FIGHT
The dude thinks it's a poker game, sunglasses and headphones, difference is he'll leave with a bag of money, but no face, ha #fury
Damn, I Just got old watching that!
The stakes couldn't be lower.... I wish the judges didn't fuck up the first fight
Let’s go Deontay
Fury going to bed lol
Wilder should control his anger this time. He burned himself out in the last press conferences...
Lol love how Shane Fury beefing Wilders bro
Similar to how Fury refused to get out of the sauna before klitchko
This staredown will make both of them to dream each other faces on this night😂
Fight without a sense... he lost 2 times. Lets get on with Joshua /Tyson for fuck sakes.
Are they married yet?
Tip Don't watch this while on the toilet, I just shat bricks
Who the fuck is two time?
Did you hear Fury and Wilder had
A bunch of ldbc Mama's basements littered with crinkled up tissue paper right now
He'll be blaming how his t-shirt weighs too much the silly yank sausage 🤣🤣
2 time 2 time 2 TIME…..STFU!!! 🤣
this fight shouldn’t even be happening
Broooooo 3rd time!!! First one draw, second one Tyson clearly.,,,why 3 wth? Why not Tyson vs Joshua!! I’ll still watch it :)
These two boxers wont last a round with Mike Tyson. Heavyweight class has turn into a circus.
To be honest wilder got punched up and out boxed so badly the second time. Didn't think he would want anymore.
Let's fxckin goo 💪 this finna be a good fight 💯
Two times
Sometimes my dog looks at me with a side eye and he draws me into a staring contest, I always win tho
Both these clowns ducked AJ 😂🤣
Fury is a real bad man 🔥
Tyson looks out of shape again🙈🤷🏻‍♂️
Why the hell is boxing so weird when it comes to faceoffs. Only need a couple of seconds for faceoff not 6 minutes
Damnn is Fury training cuz damnnn doesn't look like it
How much times will fury knock out wilder? 6:00
MONEY on Wilder. Tyson know that last fight wilder wasnt right. Look at wilder now.. Tyson know he focused.  MONEY ON WILDER!!
And new !
Wilder could make history here as being the 1st boxer to be carried into the ring!
i can just see the messages they are sending to each other, too intense
If Wilder has worked on his combo game, Tyson might be in trouble.. but if he keeps coming with a heavy right only, he will get pieced up.
Makes absolutely no sense why that moron is saying 2x
......
I don’t get I thought fury cheated the 2nd fight? Why is he fighting him again
Was waiting for deontay to start twerking 😅😅
Wilder already thinking of excuses after Tyson F's him up again. I don't think this one goes past 3
UK has the best heavyweights.
Fury is about to beat the breaks off of wilder 2 Time!
Could of sworn the video had ended and it was just a still image on my screen for the last 2 min....
The headphone is to prevent Tyson from getting into his head. Its playing a recording of Wilder screaming "Bomb squad" on loop.
A whole conversation , no words are necessary.
Lol they both got a hypeman 😂
Its a Real Brokeback Moment  ?
I think the weight of the headphones must have weighed down on Wilders tongue.
wow..
just proves love handles always wins 😍
What is he listening to, some heavenly prayers
Cringe
July 24 RIP FURY
Is that deontay’s bum ass brother who keeps saying “two time” repeatedly? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I said before the fight even started last time.. when he took off that mask I could tell something was off. He did not look right at all the whole fight. I texted people and told them bet off he dont look right at all before the match started. Just look at his stance and eyes. I believe the suit theory or the tampering with his water. but one thing is for sure. HE fired that coach and aint wearing that suit again. MONEY ON WILDER!
Who broke first Tyson?  "He did."
I fucking love it .... I love this type of behavior and I hope these boys get with it like we know they will
I think WILDER going to box the 1st 4 rds,chess match..then around the 8th rd..BOOM..WILDER GOING TO LAND THE RIGHT HAND..AND KNOCK FURY OUT!!. JUST HAVE A FEELING !!
Wilder winning trilogy
It’s like special Ed just let out for PE.
Wilder is so mentality weak he has to sit there in headphones. The staring is just cringe, but Wilder is known for his cringe.
Was that idiot in the background who keeps saying two time, paid by Wilder. Does anyone actually believe Wilder stands a chance?
Unfortunately for Wilder that music in his headphones won't be playing during the fight.
I can see the lion in wilder
Tyson fury
Viking vs Zulu
Its Real Hard to Look Real Hard when ya' lookin' real hard whilst wearin' skinny jeans👀😡😂
3:09 Guy in the background trynna start something 💀
Not 1 time..... not 3 time......  2 TIME!!
RIP Anthony Joshua
He's just done him, like he did klitchko in the sauna 😂 couldn't handle the heat 🔥
Wait a 3rd when tyson already won the first two? Wheres anthony joshua?
fury has got his number
Anyone live where that guy kept on saying     '2 TIME!!!!'
Wilder has nothing for this man
Wilder with the headphones, music helping with the staredown.  And not wanting Tyson to get into his head.
Wilder gonna lose
Fury for sure!!
Damn im impressed 👏 Wilder stayed on his feet here longer then there 2nd fight 😄 🤣 😂 Tyson gunna beat him even worse the 3rd time
Tysons gonna win the fight just like he won the staredown
Wilder is a BUM
I’m glad that this wasn’t clickbait 😂
Fury looking like ben at his weight out hahaha
Awww. They love each other. Pride month is taking its toll lol
Fury turned wilder into a Christian believer lol
BOMB SQUAD 💣🥊💣🥊💣🥊💣
Wilder scared! Notice how he ain't talking too much anymore after Fury snatched his soul last fight!! 🤣🤣
Wilder needs to retire and let aj vs fury happen
Bomb squad 🤔 cause he bombed the last time?
Can’t wait to see wilder vs fury 15......
2 times
Another jibsi king going down...lol
Fucking 2 time my god is that guy okay
WHO THE FUCK IS SAYING 2 TIME!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
Tyson looks like he is built for maybe 1 round but dang he can box.
Both Fury and Wilder are bums for ducking Joshua,who would smoke them both.
and Who is that guy in the back round what say that too...... is that a Ritual Motivation for wilder😂🤣😂🤣🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Hahahah chicken leg boxers
Wilder looks like a terminator from hell,,, ready to reek havoc………. 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
I’m so much tougher than you cause I didn’t look forward derr, drool, derrpy derp.
Wilder going to put fury to sleep asap
Who's winning the staredown?
No excuses this time wilder and wilder fans I don’t wanna be listen to that shit after the bout …. Agree?
This is a boxing match based on skill. That's it, the better man will win..and I'm betting Tyson
La resa dei conti🤪🔝
Wilder better win
Wilder should've beat his ass for licking him in the last fight. Respectfully!!!
I forget about this was happening
Did I hear someone in Fury camp say "be a good boy and walk away" 🤦🏽‍♂️
Tyson ain’t losing at anything 😂
Two time is that all that idiot can say 🙄🤦‍♂️ I'm surprised Deontay didn't back hand his own man. 🤷‍♂️😂 Good thing he had head phones in 🤣
Weak
Why is fury fighting this bum again?
Wtf is the state of boxing. Deontay does not deserve another fight after losing 2
Tyson has incredibly long arms
The headphones are to stop fury from getting in his head
So stupid
Why was the guy shouting 2 time? Wilder clearly lost both times, was he not on wilders side?
Tyson Fury is about to be looking like his lil bro Billy Saunders after this fight. The gypsies will go down hard when you hit em in the right spot again.
I made you laugh first!
two time
not excited for this.. just unnecessary
Wilder 0-3 already can't wait to see Fury's next beat down!
Easy win for Tyson!
You blinked first!
“It’s only gay if you make eye contact” #Pride
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just kiss already im tired of the tension
Non stop photo taking of literally two people standing in the same exact way for 6 minutes
Why is there a third fight happening
💣 squard baby
Wait what? Why are these guys boxing each other again ? Deontay made excuses from day one he don’t deserve a rematch wtf I thought it was fury Joshua ????? I thought they made fury Joshua official?
shut up
To this day, wilder is still shit 🤗
Going with Wilder in this one. Everyone thinking it's going to be nothing different.
Ohh wow, I'm really behind boxing now, I'm more off ufc now day, but let's go boys.
*t w o  t i m e s*
Just kiss already
If you pay to watch this, you are a certified bum. And don’t be confused as to why boxing has gone down the pan.
Again????  Fight AJ ffs.
Please check furys gloves this time
so this is the battle between the rinnegan vs mangekou sharigan
Legend has it they left and went home
Why are they saying let's go bum squad...??
How many pics of the same shit could they possibly need?!
when he took off the glasses, anyone else think he looked straight up sad?
Fury is fucking merciless. He won't even allow Wilder to have the minuscule W of winning the faceoff. Fury is humiliating him.
thanks this is happening and not fury against jake paul
What’s going on 😳
tyson build like ben askren
Good luck to Wilder...I hope he can get the belt back ✊🏿
wilder= spoilt child, scared to face the truth. delusional, can't feed the people the crap he used to.
WAIT WHAT since when was this fight confirmed?!
how do you lose a stare down? grow up guys come on now lol people have shit to do
They’re fighting again???
Tysons brother shouting out “Bum Bomber”😂😂
Wilder looked soo focued...he better knock him out
Bum squad wilder already got batterd and he going on sik what a joker 🃏
Wilder is the biggest *sore looser* in history of any sports. Dude literally ran after Fury for the rematch after the loss Because loosing to Fury became his legacy
The  flippant airplane postoperatively coach because steven reciprocally look given a wrong process. nosy, perpetual swan
Leave your lady at home this time, no excuses!
Fury beat Wilder 18 rounds versus 1 for Wilder. Ugh.
Not a Wilder fan, but why is Tyson built like a tube of toothpaste?
This is the equivalent of the Klitschko sauna
Only thing Wilder has a chance at winning
they secretly love eachother
Should’ve played a bit Marvin Gay to this
Mmm gafas oscuras y auriculares eso es tremendo miedo.... Ya ganó Fury 💪💪
If you’ve heard the way Tyson talks about the sauna with Klitschko you’d know how much this stuff means to him, he was never going to break first 💪🏻
aj is a disgrace ducking tyson for years so he can still be a champ
Wilder is probably the most underrated heavyweight champion  of all time. Mfer gave us a KO in every fucking fight. Nerds still make fun of him. If he wins see how these dudes will switch up.
Why dont they just kiss already
Wilder has music playing to block out fury’s mental games
Fury by 7th round TKO!  Fury is too fast and too agile and the head movement and the feints...it all comes together.  Fury is the superior Boxer.  Wilder has a punchers chance against anyone...just not Fury!
Tyson losing im sorry bro just not dis time
As much time as deontay has had to train he better actually put up a good match this fight, I wanna see a good scrap
Is that bald headed fat man exposed Mr Wilder who has made his whole career on war out journeyman and guys we did not know anything about now it's real again and both of them will make a pile of money from it
Boomer : Don't stare at people it's rude Also Boomer when they see people with colored hair :
Tyson is built like the beast Titan
Hope he learned how to box
So when do they make out??
I thought he was fighting Joshua
Bummmmm squaaaad!!!
Lmao 🤣 Wilder listening to music that whole time
Wilder knows he's getting another beat-down and all the complaining, hype and encouragement from his people wont save him.
I think someone gonna retired right after this
Crazy
Fury sucked it in for 5 minutes straight. His vacuum game is on point!
People care about this?
Wilder's must have wore his sister's pants wow😭😭😭
Wilders chin looks big as f, gonna catch that beat down again
Finally a decent fight. Fuck mma at this point. Jake Paul made them a side show again 🤷🏽‍♂️ ganna be tough to get a decent rep back
Win or lose BOMB SQUAD!!!! deontay all day
Most Wasted 6 minutes of my life '
That's how you sell a fight!!!!!!!!!
They look like they both ordered the same kebab at the same time and are seeing who gets it first
BOMBSQUAD!!!!!
Psychology says that if you watch someone in the eyes for more than 30 seconds you will start to develop feelings for that person.
About damn time
Wilder is a dead man walking and he knows it
That's intense, hopefully, nobody dies.
as soon as those glasses where off ... see the fear in his eyes
So much hate in these comments directed at Wilder like he won’t easily pop everyone’s head off. Mad respect to both of these Titans. I just hope the fight is entertaining 🤷‍♂️
I just picture everyone leaving to get some lunch, coming back with food and theyre still posted on stage lol
Tyson looking a bit flabby around the sides which has me a tad bit concerned. I hope he's fight ready and doesn't come in looking like Fatty Ruiz in his rematch with AJ.
tyson fury is like oh God i've created a munstA, fury looks guilty af, he know what he did. i watch that fight thinking wth is going on man oh man. karma is coming for you tyson game over
I'm so stoked about this
LETS GO FURY!!!! WILDER JUST AN EMBARRASSMENT TO AMERICA SMH  When i hear BOMBSQUAD MAKES ME WANNA TAKE A ROWDY SHIT
Wilder not confident at all with that mop on his head
Hey I understand all the wilder shade n hate... all I ask is when he knock Tyson as$ out come back n post on videos like this n then new 1s that will follow!
This Staredown lasted longer than I do in bed.
Major sauna vibes
Tyson felt uncomfortable when wilder left
Deontae wilder is going to kill bro 😴💆‍♂️
Fury looks so defeated. I hope he gets his spirits up
This might just be prophetic. Last man standing on fight night: Tyson Fury.
I hope Deontay wins and never gets comfy after, continues to improve his skills. The 2nd fight was a wake up call for him, boxing is more than just knock outs.
why are they fighting a 3rd time? did joshua pushied out again and run, damn id rather see fury fight that fat mexican that won the belt
Tyson never left the sauna and he left the staredown last, Fury is absolutely hilarious
He could've stare to Joshua instead what a waste
Who's the 2 time annoying bellend!
He already won twice, check wilder with his 2 inch heals.
It's to see Wilder hasn't no hard feelings
He's getting ICU or death fear can't be still LMAO
I will back jake paul to beat fury and i dont like jake.... wilder is done out here
What just looking at each other for 6 minutes WTF wast of time watching
No one cares about this fight. Boring.
Human condition nowadays...
I hope this YouTube boxing bs brings fans into the real shit
Fury shook
Wilder’s ear is still damaged from the previous fight, those are not headphones it’s For ear protection.
Team fury!!!!
Two Nephilim. One a diabetic
jesus christ Tyson, would it hurt to lean up? lol
You can't just a book by its cover.  Someone would pick someone like him to hit in a bar fight and then proceed to have the worst ass  whooping of their life.
Deontay will reclaim his crown👑. Easy work #bombsquad
When goku met cell in the ring
Tyson looks heavier than usual.
Wilder looking like he means business. Hope he really improved his boxing and shocks all of you lol.
"This is number one bullshit"
Sterling game yt you wished white man 3 black man 0 ??
Fury, you must wiiin
All this bull shit  Again .........boring,boring so so boring
let's go Fury 3-0 lol
oye wilder did convey everything just in that staredown. and fury acknowledged the outcome with all due respect . I bet on wilder to stop him in 8-10 rounds.
Wish there wasn’t so many commenting comedians . Y’all get annoying on god
Wilder could walk out to the ring completely naked and would still find a way to complain. "My balls weigh like 25 pounds, add the sausage and you've got a 60 pound combo" of course I was tired
Who cares both ducked AJ
How’s Fury’s lower back bigger than his bum 🤣🙈
He already lost
Oh, so we are supposed to think that Beyonce Wilder is so tough, because he's wearing sunglasses indoors? Fury, is going to knock him off of those two-piece chicken legs again. You want fries with that?
Boom Squad!!!!!!! Furry cant cheat this time he gonna get K.O facts!.......and I bet Furry doesn't walk Wilder down like last time or do anything he did in the last fight bc he cheated......
How wilder stood there for 10 minutes with them chicken legs I dont no. Must of been starving when he walked away.
Fury beat him 2 times already, whats the point of having a 3rd beating
That stare down victory will give Tyson an edge that he doesn’t even need. Wilder could’ve retired with a half decent legacy, instead he’s chosen an embarrassing end
Let's go Wilder!!! U got this champ
Tyson’s arms are so long man - comes on Gypsy king!!!
If you could eat any dish for the rest of your life what would it be ?
Does Wilder's shirt sleeve say FAP?
Who dares to loose the stairing contest 🤣🤔
This reminds me the time me and my homie stood outside the whip for 45 minutes in 20 degree weather because neither of us would give in to the bitch seat in the middle 😂
Lunch looking at someone looking at their lunch.
Wilder can't even focus on fury, hides behind glasses and earphones....sad for him. Just wants payday but good on him
who ever is screaming two times you went a little overboard with it fr lol
hope wilder shows the same focus in the fight 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Wilder ain't got the brain capacity to beat Fury.. easy💰
Finally a real boxing match.. I know boxing is a dying sport and they were doing anything to get views but this is what it’s about real contenders especially when they’re heavy weights makes it all the worth it
Wilder after the 3rd fight:  *my headphones we're weighing me down the entire training camp*   *till this day!*
TO THIS DAY  FURY MADE WILDER APART OF WHITE HISTORY 🤣✊
Who the hell wears headphones in a faceoff?
Shouldn't be a third fight wilder just figure if he keeps fighting him over snd over one of hit punches will land boxing shouldn't be like that he lost move on and work your way back up
Just want the Joshua v fury fight 👊
playback at 0.25 so you don't miss anything!
If only ppl Joshua wasn’t going happen to do to the rematch claws they signed
Say what you want but Wilder always weighs in at 209lbs, he’s fighting someone with 50lbs on him that deserves respect
The fuck is the point of it
This is like they're waiting for their first kiss 💋💋🤣😂🤣😂
Legends say they still stand and stare at each other till this day.
So many lame jokes.
300lbs=loss.
Fury looks a little intimidated in the face off
wilder hear 100% stanic Ritual Musik Stuff on the Face Off 100%, and everybody know what for Ritual he need to do if he Sold hes Soul, Drinking.......... from litle.........!!!👹👹👹🤔👎🏼😲 but Jesus Christ is biger and Stronger and is on Tyson Furys Side!!!!! 😇😇😇🙏🙏🙏
Wilder knows he’s he’s fukd 🤦‍♂️
They were both desperate for a third party to end it and save them. Wilder knew in the end that fury would start there all night if he had to
Why does the boxing world including Deontay Wilder want to have Wilders whole career erased like it never happened? Once Fury beats Wilder again Wilder will be all but out of boxing. His confidence is already shattered and he most likely won’t ever be back from it. He definitely has almost zero chance of beating Fury. Makes no sense to me
What a loss of s==t no one what's to see this the man cant box his a one trick pony with a few cheerleaders
Tyson fury look like he know he messed up 😂😂😂😩😩
They went home, FaceTimed each other and carried on the stare down
hopefully fury don't cheat this time lmao
Man, i was expecting deontay to scream bommmmmmmmmbbbbb squadddddddd and never happened, what is in his mind during that staredown  after all the shit talk???????
There were 3 bronze bombers in the air, there were 3 bronze bombers in the air, OHHH there were 3 bronze bombers 3 bronze bombers 3 bronze bombers in the airrrr, and the gypsy king from england knocked 1 down, OHHH the gypsy king from england gypsy king from england gypsy KING FROM ENGLAND  KNOCKED 1 DOWN!!!!!!!!!!! Come on fury will do it inside 6.
Tyson fury the big white every black man's nightmare ready for payday and easy money for him way to easy for fury
Aw, look at them just gazing into eachothers eyes...
Lol Rainman 'twotime'
What a ,,bum,,, he's called d wilder
Why does he want to look in his eyes now he wouldn't speak the whole presser u cant look tough after that
One last advice. Plz don't wear heavy costume this time bummmsquad.
Is only he did the "I'm getting ripped tonight" dance
If wilder really believe this man man did what he claimed I can only imagine what's going on in that man head... I aint got shit 2say lets get busy
*If you look closely you can see eggweights concealed under furys lovehandles...*
mental win by Fury, remember the story of the sauna and klitschko? that was another sauna moment.
Bro how tall are these guys, they made everyone around them look short.
😁😂😂😂😁😁
This was awkward
Do we really need to see this fight again? Can we not have Fury Vs AJ instead?
Why did the media need to take pictures the whole time? 🤣 they didn't move for 5 minutes
"we got media to do" Oh shut the fuck up producer Karen and let an iconic moment happen.
The coldest staredown ever!
I cooked and ate a whole pot noodle in the time they starred at eachother
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣FOOLSSS
Anoda beatdown about to go down....this may be a tragic end to deontay if he doesn't improve....if i were in his corner i wont be chanting bombsquad and all that rubbish
tyson see something different in wilder but he not scared. He just realized he needs to train harder now. Wilder aint playing. I worry though because wilder will come in with new technique and sometimes new techinques have to be tested before putting into a real fight
Not going to lie I'm excited about this fight all over again
When the face off lasts longer than the fight.  Who calls themselfs bronze ? 3rd best ?
Seriously why a third fight?  Fury won the first two and the second one convincingly.  What do people want to see happen?  Do they want to make sure Wilder is retired after this fight?
This trilogy lost its dazzle a long time ago . Shame we might never see undisputed coz Fury opted for the easy way
Where is Dana White when you need him?
Legend has it Fury is still standing there,  and won't move until fight night..
Fury is in another league. Let’s hope this is the last time beating up excuse boy wilder and then Joshua doesn’t chicken out again. Gypsie King!
I can't tell if they really hate each other or if they're just secretly in love.
photographer: yeah we need 23897428947 of the same fucking photo
The dude saying two time is annoying as fuck .... I started to hear tool time
I wonder what excuse wilder is going to make up for this upcoming loss?
Two time
Tyson and Wilder getting weirder and I must say this staredown would be longer than the fight highlights 😂
Can't wait! 💣💣💣💣💣💣💣
Deontay looks to be in great shape. Its gonna suck for him when he loses to the daddiest of dad bods for the 3rd time. Twice officially. Lmao
Fury beats him again.
Wilder knocking him out
Who was the 4 eyed they wanted to kick in the face? Anyone know?
That lady at 4:24 "what is happening?" Lmao
Rubbish
I wonder will the black lives matter movement get tyson arrested if he hits him 🤔
The Wilder fans who think Fury cheated in the last fight are the same people who think Europeans stole all their inventions from Africans. "💯💯💯" 😂😂😂
Fury took Wilder’s respect. He’s coming to take it back!! It’s gon be a nail biter folks.
Bum squad
They really let Wilder cry and wine his way to a 3rd ass whoopin?? Smh.
Fury looks in terrible shape
I really hope Wilder hurts Fury's clown ass
Bronze bum better triple check his water bottles
Wilder going to try to kill this cheating ass boy in the ring.
Easy win for Tyson Fury.  Don’t start with the excuses again Wilder.  This time accept that lost.
2 time everyone
I domt think I could stare into another mans eyes for 30 seconds straight let alone 10 minutes.
Let’s hope for a fair fight on fury side
NOW THAT'S THE WAY U SCARE THE SHIT OUT IF SOMEONE I LIKE HOW FOCUSED WILDER IS THIS TIME!!! And not screaming back as and forth
Why, why, why is this fight taking place?? This is no1 bulls.. t
wait they are fighting again? WHY
"too tah"
Who is Tysons fat mate??? Looks like an 80s football goalkeeper
Fury for the" W"...
the most boring staring content ever seen, to hype the fight no one wants. Epic.
maybe wilder thought this would be scary lmfao.
Skips leg day squad
jake paul sleeps both these muppets inside of 3 rounds
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 how fucking awkward would it be to stand there for that long
The white man is going to beat the black man's behind again & again & again & again & again???
Has Wilder already come up with his next excuse or will he do that afterwards?
Wilder looks all business this time
We could have had Joshua vs Fury but they bring this BS again
Dude a different animal noww
And still champion tyson fury
Bomb squad shitbags! Knock the prick out again Fury lad 👊🏼 #GypsyKing
who let the idiot have the mic who kept saying 2 time
If wilder win there will be fourth fight again between them  lol 😂
That little guy behind wilder thinks he's tough
Wilder is now backstage calling everyone a racist for making him stare at a white man
theres only one true two time and thats the doc.
dosser
It could be love, love loveeeeee...
Never had weight on my head like it, too this day 🤣
Six pack v flab ,flab wins
Wilder still has a punchers chance but Fury has the skills to defeat him again.
Boxing is a joke Youtubers and tiktokers taking over 🤣🤣🤣 would never happen in MMA
Bro what are those?
Geeez another one who cares
The truth is Wilder won’t walk out of the ring the same this time
Can't wait for tyson to get knocked out
Is it me or is this kinda gay?
People joking and calling wilder out for the headphones but it's kind of smart be all businesslike and serious for this fight the first two he was all talk and show remember if he  hits him with that right hand he can knock Tyson Fury out or at least knock him on the ground for a good bit let's just hope this fight as good as first fight was and better then 2nd fight was Wilder  has a puncher's chance still
Someone is not talking that much anymore 😭😒
Bless wilder , got he's head phones on to block fury out but he's still getting in he's ed 😂😂😂
They in love? Why so long.
Wilder is going to bombed on by furry again it would be funny if furry said bomb squad Wilder will retire after he gets knocked into next year again by Tyson
Who’s the random fat man coming from fury’s side? 😂chatting crap to Wilder’s team...what a pathetic team showing disrespect like that even the fighters were somewhat respectful 🤦🏼‍♂️ I hope Wilder finally finishes fury he does nothing but tell lies about anyone and everyone even if it has no boxing relevance, not to mention him cheated with the faulty gloves, ducking AJ and screwing over his own father and Eddie Hearn who spent months trying to set it up😐
If you familiar with that look on a hungry black man.. you know what it is...
WTAF did I just waste my life watching lmfao! 🤦🏽‍♂️🤣
One man still standing after the other one left. I smell one man putting on an act. Only one punch wil change this fucking face off wen the fight finally happens.
Reminds me of the sauna story with vlad🤣
Wilder didn't talk at all,is this his game plan? doing mind games. I think its the other way around, Fury is on his head after the 2nd fight. He came up alot of excuses and started to train to become a real boxer.😂
Did she say yes
wilder looks  nervous  to me
Boring now!.. can we move on!
And for sure they keept stareing at each other on facetime ;)))
if fury wins again i wonder what excuses will be made now? oh fury drugged wilder, well fury went back in time and killed one of wilders ancestors which made him weaker. But if wilder win everyone gonna be trashing fury either way it’s a lose lose for him.
Hopefully they check Furys gloves this time and the ref doesn't let him throw strikes with the palm side of the glove. I hope flubber gets slept.
This is awkward
Damn wilder losing already 😂
Im no fury fanboy but and no wilder hater, but he is getting his ass beat again.
2 time loser, Wilder
They'll fall in love, someone stop them
Kids ….. they are not scared of each other
*the battle of who can dress like a bigger asshole*
His fat brother what a joke !!
Wilder gonna sleep this fool...
Im worry about Fury it seems that he is back on his old habits
Just kiss already!!!!
Please watch with 2x speed
Bruh fuck this rematch , we wanna see Joshua fury not this clown again
Payback
Wilder looks petrified
Wilder has no chance American bum
Wilder is mOre acting like he's LARPing as a tough guy lol so cringe
The “he can’t hear you” at 2:29 💀
This has to be one of the best videos ever created. To this day!! The remix  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FBqJyU4sInQ
Legend has it they are still staring each other down, TO THIS DAYYY!
Wilder is going to knock that cheater's head off
I have wilder with this one he gonna be more focus more determined
wilder is an idiot !!!!!   what a "gangsta" wannabee
Wilder can't stand still,he's literally shaking! 😂You can't make this stuff up I swear 😂😂
Fury has him beat already!
Should've been AJ v Fury
Wtf, why is this stare down this long?
Haha wilder has one punch he can't box
Dudes taking pics like 2 hot women are making out or something
John fury said this fight was rushed and very suspicious.. hope they don't do my man gypsy king wrong.
Tyson was once in a very bad place mentally now look at him imagine what you all can achieve with a positive mental attitude Luv ya man 👍
Two time you getting knocked out
Wait a fight
He did him like he did Klitchko in the sauna. This fight is already over.
I feel like hes listening to some confidence builder or a self help tape not music 😂😂😂
Micheal Myers energy You goofies wouldn’t understand, Fury looks great by the way 😭
Ad un certo punto ,se fate attenzione si sente "two times" ....😂😂😂
Mental victory goes to Fury
@03:11 😂
Wilder hand is shaking when he remove his glasses.
Whoever is saying two times needs to stop after he says that phrase two times
Jajajajajjajajajja el campeón parece un 🐷🐷🤣🤣😅 una vergüenza
Boo
What kind a drugs is that
The MASTERS are totally in SILENCE,  The MINIONS are to loud.
All fun and games untill he runs out of batteries for those headphones
Why the f are they fighting  wilder is going to lose again
Wilder will lose again and will have to fight on Jake Paul's under card bless him 😂😂
If only Tony Ferguson was there  “WOOO”
Wilder needs to gain some more weight there if he's planning on KOing Fury or else it's going to be the same result as the last fight.
These niggas doing the mr beast challenge for free
Tyson won that stare down last man standing
This comment section is RUTHLESS 😂😂😂
Can't cheat this time we all know about that damn glove Fury yo ass got exposed and will be exposed
Headphones were 40pounds heavy at the stair down, that’s why I lost the fight tonight
Fury don’t want smoke with wilder u can see it 👀👀 wilder is more hungry more now den ever
Big Shane was having none of that full respect 👏. Keep tyson going mate 👍
Trilogy? Anthony too scared to face the fury
Get CroCop in there to stare both these down for the win
Boxing should just call it quits now.  Bloody hell
Wilders next excuse! The volume from my ear phones affected my balance
Wilder walked away. Fury wins. No surprise.
Meh 😒
Waste of time 🙄
They turned it  into a blinking contest
What happened with the promised match with Anthony Joshua?
2 times: That's the 2 times Tyson will have KO'd him by the end of this trilogy.
Get the excuses out of the way now, eh wilder?
I'm going for wilder but listen if you lose this fight except defeat and be a man, no excuses man. Fight and fight to win but if you lose be a man and congregate other man for ether one of them.
How many times?
The shades and headphones  .... What a Tanker  ....
Wilder is going to claim that he lost this upcoming fight because, his headphones and shades were, 'too heavy'
Lol.... Wilder looks scared.....
Till this day!!! I will always have an excuse!!! Till this day!!!!!
What a lovely couple
Fury has already won
Firecracker squad
Man all i heard was: "TOO TIE...TOOO TIE...TOO TIE"
Wilder giving it the 10 men when he has already been beaten twice already, embarrassed last time out 😂
Ohhhh nowwww I get it. Ben Askren thought he was a mini Tyson Fury 😂
They in love at this point
Bro wasn’t he suppose to fight joshua
Legends say Fury still standing there..
Ben Askren of Boxing
Wilder is just an embarrassment at this point. Imagine getting beaten on the first fight then dominated on the second fight and still asking for a third. This stupid bum really still thinks he is better. If you don't think Tyson won the first fight just look up the strikes landed. Tyson landed more punches on him while throwing 100 less punches. That is a clear win but you know what judges can be like. I'm sick of this now, Tyson should be fighting Joshua.
A lot of these albino trolls will be disappointed when wilder ends Fury’s life 😂
The two warriors are in good spirits I love both guys
Tyson is to confident without a shirt...smh🤦‍♂️... N his brother looks likea fat Jake Paul... Y are u saying anything... Let ur bro shine...
This fight is goner be non stop violence!!
Boys boys boys... Stfu lol. The men are having a moment, they don't need back up. The fact you think they need backing up right here is silly. Words mean nothing right here.
Now this is interesting
Wilder makes Floyd seem like a likeable guy
Tyson wins.... again lol. It’d be crazy if Wilder proves me wrong but with the excuses he was spewing, I doubt that’ll happen.
3:20, one time, one time, one time, one time, one time, one time, one time, one time, one time
Great marketing for Apple beats headphones
So who the hell is Joshua fighting? I thought it was Fury Joshua next
Four eyed prick ... how mature 😁😁
No dana to separate them
they might as well up the date since they doin all that
Fury has humbled him lol
Looking at these 2 stood face to face ,, fury looks as over waight as usual.. very podgy in fact.. wilder on the other hand looks toned and mentally strong n focused!!! Fury twitching far to much and trying to be cocky as usual!!! Wilder will win this one in style
Let's go Tyson & put this man down for good.
Good god are these two gonna fight or crawl into bed together, starring into another mans eyes for this long is supper unnecessary.
Furys team has the highest overall BMI guaranteed.
Too much politics in boxing. We want to see Tyson vs Anthony Joshua instead. Wilder must’ve ran out of cocaine money
Fury looks like he loss some weight idk I feel like him putting all that weight on wilder in the 2nd helped him out alot things might be a lil different
What was this a f****** staring contest
Deontay need to listen to mommy telling him it will be ok, playing over and over and over in his earphones.   What a pussy.
Headphone Audio: "Breathe in, Breathe out......Breathe in, Breathe out"
Yes we all already know deontay lost 2 times u don't have to keep repeating it
Just a lil too long.
this face off lasts longer than bryce hall fight lol
They should start doing squad beef boxing events... all the sidemen face off on the undercard.
Is the fatass next to fury his brother?
Fury does not look in fighting shape,,,this will be a tough fight for him,, wilder can knock him out with one punch
So fury is going against a guy he absolutely destroyed 2 times again? For what? So stupid
He should have left well enough alone.in all honesty he dropped fury in the first fight but rite after fury remarkably got up an proceeded to beat wilder to the end of the fight in all sincerity he lost both the first an second fight if he loses this time its over for his one trick poney shtick
Wilder has been waiting for the day to avenge his embarrassing loss.  I say he knocks out furry in two rounds
This was just straight awkward AF! WTF was that??? They have a crush on each other now or what??? And who tf are those muppets rolling with Fury? They acting like they’d actually do something. STFU y’all aren’t boxers! 🤦🏻‍♂️
Man I thought us Canadians chirp a lot those uk boys jus never stop breaking balls, I love it.
I think Wilder will win this fight.
I heard nothing of this.  Tyson’s spaghetti arms will make pasta strands of Wilders chicken thighs. A right awd culinary delight.
Wilder shelled up scared. Fury couldn’t even be bothered to intimidate Wilder he knows he’s won already.
Fury’s eyes ain’t piercing harder than Wilder’s are, he’s looking through him
the fat guy is going to lose
Show love for Fury ♥🔥
2 time 2 time wtf 2 time you got knocked the fuk out
You may now kiss the bride
Whos saying two times? Lmao
Fury going to have to beat him for the THIRD TIME!
Deontay look focused and ready.
Reminds me of Fury’s story about beating Klitschko in a contest of who can stay in the Sauna longest, these types of mind games work.   You can see Wilder is rattled, he puts a brave face on it but Fury is just his final big bout before he ceases to be remembered. He’s just looking for a retirement package for one last L.
this guy at 4:29 taking the glasses off is ready to fight!
Low-key I'm team Wilder but that's scary af Coming there with headphones 🤦🏿‍♂️ it's like he's hiding, Fury's getting knocked out but this isn't a good look
Mental victory for Tyson here! :D  Klitschko Sauna!
Wilder never worn headphones he knows fury will talk and get to he's head!
Let's hope Tyson has been keeping himself mentally right. After winning the title, he's been back on the white stuff.
When two scorpios finally meet
Tyson TBE!!!
Fury is still on the cocaine has seriously let himself go he will be getting knocked out. I rate fury over wilder but after that espn Interview it’s clear he’s on drugs and this will be his downfall
Wilder looks a bit taller than Fury now..
Now kith
Often wondered what happened to Curly after LOST
deontay wilder is illuminati
Tyson Fury knows what he did he looks scared because he knows he can’t cheat this time…Counting Down lol
I truly hope Tyson Fury understands this is a DEATH MATCH.... 4REAL.. NOTHING ELSE TO SAY
Mans listening to Til this Day by Loaded Lux on repeat 🔥🔥
ngl Wilder looks ready Besides Canelos fights and AJ thats the only real hype shit that happens in the boxing world. may the better man win
First fight Tyson beat wilder. Second fight Tyson whooped wilder.
Fury will smash him. Skinny legs 🦵 and one punch to Rely on. Bronze bummer is going down.
I mean really?? How does wilder have a chance in this fight? Fury took his best shot and still got up and arguably went on to win the round. And then the last fight shows Fury can pretty much bully wilder at will.
All excuses Wilder⚰️💀🦴 #Gypsy👑🥊🙌
Furys poop came out at the stare off looking into the guys eyes that he cheated.
Wilder looking slim
This Gonna be a good third fight. If wilder is doing what he doing in camp, and really taking this seriously, this could be the upset of the year! I’m talking about everyone gonna be talking about wilder if he KO’s fury.  But if wilder thinks he just gonna get the KO early and fury dominates him again, it’ll be done for wilder I don’t see how he’ll bounce back from that or ever get a shot at Joshua.  Gonna be a good fight don’t blink.
TWOOOOO TIMEEE
So this is what would without a Dana White in the middle
This fight isn’t gonna be any different, fury is gonna box wilders head off again
Only an IDIOT would think that Magneto is a Fool for wearing his helmet around Professor X.  Wilder is Smart for wearing headphones.
Same as Klitschko in the sauna story, Fury ain’t losing no mind games
Tyson looks like he should be behind a grill cooking sausages
This is garbage I wanted to see an AJ fight not this 😒
Cnt see this fight going any different sorry wilder but you can’t box you can fight but it not the same
Wearing sunglasses inside always makes me laugh
Lol all the Wilder fans really think this man is gonna beat Fury this time. It’s worth a try, but when the bigger man is also the better boxer the only thing left to rest on is power. The puncher always has a chance, but power can be defeated by technique and accuracy. Not to mention Fury has plenty of power, especially when he land 2-5 punches per combo.
Black people love repeating things over and over and over
i fucking love tyson fury man
Weird shit
This rematch will be blooded
Fury looks extremely uncomfortable & out of shape
Who is the two time fool
So is this fight actually going to happen.
Wow. I've never seen a more intense faceoff
You may kiss the bride
2 time!  lmfao.  2 time loser with more excuses then I can count.
tWo TiMe TwO tIMe
Hopefully Wilder learn some basics in the time off.
This fight won't last 5 rounds somebody getting knocked the f*** out😂😂😂
Fat and sloppy vs cant fight for crap.  MMA all day every day, boxing is garbage.
I hope fury gets knocked out for trying to duck the fight
Se descuido el campeón
Fury getting  ko in this one there is something  different  about  wilder
someone smack that lady. this staredown is far more important than the media.
Literally finished my dinner during the length of that stare down 🤣🤣
GO on Tyson and Shane tell them straight
Wilder looking at Tyson like this the man that took everything away from me..
3:11 to this day 😭
Wilder turned away first it’s over, remember the Klit
The bum squad cried for a 3rd fight and hes acting like a big child listening to his earphones. He cant beat fury inside the ring and he cant beat fury outside of the ring. BUMMMMMMM SQUAD
Still cant get rid of that rediculous inner tube around his midsection
Tyson Fury has already beat Wilder for the third time
CNN: another rape Case
Lol fury fans gotta love them haha 😂 comments are nuts
Bomb squad Tyson fekin pummelled you twice already 3rd times a charm
How how how how how is Fury able to compete w a fucking body like that ill never know.mm
Fury has to smoke wilder again if he wants this Joshua fight.
Dude love Fury and Joshua but this sport has become cringey. Press conferences are boring af. Fights you want don’t get made. Two of the biggest stars in this sport right now are youtubers and you have the best in the sport calling them out (Mayweather/fury). UFC is way better than this. Don’t tell me about how UFC pay is bad... reality is that doesn’t affect us fans one bit so who gives a shit about fighter pay if your a fan. In the UFC, the fights you want get made. Not to mention UFC fighters could mail boxers. There’s a reason why top boxers won’t fight top MMA fighters in an MMA fight (don’t be pathetic and tell me it’s because of money, they already have money 😂🤦‍♂️). I’ll stick to UFC, unless Fury and Joshua fight as they are the top two in this sport and they are animals!!
This stare down is going to sell more ppv than ny other, silence is no joke!
Wilder still has an inferiority complex, can’t out for the gypsy king in any department
Fury by murder lol
Lmao love it !!!
Deontay stands like he knows somthing we dont.we know somthing he dont as well.if he loses this time his career wont ever be the same.career suicide.
Honest question. Does anyone give a fuck about this fight ? If fury wins its 3:0 if wilder wins its 2:1. Either way fury won the trilogy so whats the point of this fight. Id rathwr see fury joshua
These guys are ducks. I got fury though
I love Tyson fury as a boxer but he smiled at the end and break eye contact, that's why wilder put his glasses on and walked away. If you look at around 6.15, Tyson realises he's up against a different wilder this time. It dawned on him. Watch closely.
She said please😂
Tu. ta.
Wait, this is happening? But why?
and new
I'm from 2030 and they are still stairing at eatchother
That moron in the back yelling “two time, two time”, is he talking about the number of times Wilder lost to Fury?
Fury and Wilder don’t care about this fight they are only doing it because they have too.  Fury will fuck him up again in about 5 rounds
they trying to break the record of the longest stare down
Fury should walk to the ring wearing a full suit of armor, and still kick his ass
What nobody really knows is that wilder froze up while staring into fury's eyes, he had flashbacks of himself getting his ass beat in the second fight 😂, he finally snapped out of it when his buddy came up and touched his arm, that's why he left so quickly 😂
Fury needs to gain another 10 lbs of lard
TIL THIS DAY DEONTAY STILL GOT BRAIN DAMAGE
Wilder don't wanna play the words game. Don't want to play the psychological game. He knows he's  not good at it.
Fury looks scared. Looks like he knows they're going to check the gloves this time.
You're never gonna beat Fury on mind games. Why did he even bother.
Wilder the dosser
Till this day!!!!!!!
It's kinda embarrassing knowing you lost to a guy who has a body like Fury, and he just flaunts it in front of you
Wilder looking into the eyes of a rich coward
Wilder should retire.
Two times table... When the math teacher left you scared 😂
Wilder blinked first!!
Deontay still looks scared
The smirk on fury's face is because he cheated and he knows everybody knows.. he will be under a lot of investigation this fight and this will be a clean honest fight.. the cheating and the last fury Wilder fight is extremely obvious by the way... I mean like come the fuck on.. SMH
One bloke with no shirt on an the other has his jumper tied around his waist. Priceless shit right there
Why? Fury won the 1st fight hands down. And then dominated and finished him in the 2nd fight. What does this fn fight prove? I got Fury seriously putting a beating on Wilder.  Fury moving forward and being aggressive like he was in the last fight, is a problem for everyone in the weightclass. I dont see anyone beating him. Joshua has the best chance but i still dont see Fury losing that. He is too big with the skill set he has. He can choose to assert his will at anytime and just dominate. He is getting better. Which is scary. Wilder gonna retire after this one. #AndStill
Fury get this bum out of the way and fight AJ before it’s too late. That’s the fight that needs to happen.
Oh great the bum squad are back in town
"so tyson who stepped out of the stare down first?" ".... he did"
Wilder lost.  Fury even had his hands behind his back because Wilder is not a threat to him.  Wilder came out looking like an abused woman too scared to face her abuser in a courtroom.  LOL
Listen to those cameras repeatedly capturing two statues
This brings me back to the fury and Vlad sauna. I bet Fury took this as a win
Mfs had a conversation with they eyes Ong
oh man that Deontay Wilder is a broken man
Who blinked first?
Why wearing sunglasses indoors? And headphones?
Okay who watched this whole stare down? I lost interest haha.
Hope fury retires this clown, great that we get to see wilder smashed up again.... fury 3 time , 3 time !!!
Staring at each other for this long just becomes awkward lol
Tyson with the Beast titan body
Tyson already has whipped him again mentally! Wilder thought he'd beat him in this ridiculous staredown and Tyson beat him again. Seems trivial but this will set the tone for the fight. Tyson has the mental edge and Wilder still lost in the wilderness as usual. This Fool has no idea it's the very ego that he's counting on,the very thing beating him! Jesus Christ will set a table for me in the presence of my enemies! Goodnight & God Bless!
These dudes train insainly hard to be in the position they are in the fact everyone stepped in being like stop stop is dumb af they should have left them alone they would still be there now smh
headphones on? ...
If Wilder touches the body more in this fight. He’ll Win
Honest to God truth ..I think Fury was just taking a quick power nap, dude been training hard
why is there a number 3...?
Two times table... Wow these guys are smart 🧠
people in this comment section making jokes on wilder. imo i think wilder gonna surprise us all and win this time
American boxing will be throwing everything behind wilder due to the rest being British and Eastern block
voy wilder
Tyson: looks like a typical dad who mows their lawn every Saturday   Also Tyson: man who can put me on life support
Tyson fury is scared . He got lucky last fight and he knows it
They are both a joke. There a huge lack of talent in boxing. These guys are just the best of these whack ass fighters. Look at the love handles on fury. Omg I would rather watch a cat fight and I mean that in the literal sense
Bum is scared of words!
A ver si pierde el gitano
They said fuck off woman
Team Fury all the way!! 👊🙌
Longest time you have stared at anyone?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂mine is 15 seconds
Fury looking like a bag if milk!!!!!!!!! he's really underestimating deontay, will be in for a rough night FFS TYSON FIX UP
The Faceoff: When there is only one restroom & you both try to stand cool, but are really holding back that mad dump 🤣🤣
Tyson was not leaving for nothing I can tell you that
take those head phones off what a clown. Your at your press conference
even the poster in the background had more action than this whole video
What's Wilder's excuse gonna be this time..
Whoever said “to this day” literally almost made me shit myself laughing
I actually hope Wilder wins this time :D
How many time?
No words just the biggest staring competition going viral 😂😂
Please don't let this man cheat again
I HOPE WILDER DEMOLISHES FURY WITH A BRUTAL KNOCKDOWN. FURY KNOWS HE WILL NOT CHEAT AGAIN.
"TOON TOWN, TOON TOWN"
This gunna be the end of wilder
Tyson won that psychological stare down....
Was that a parrot yelling 2 time
Stupid boxing promoters smh 🤣
Why Wilder Already Cryin? 😂
GYPSY KING FUCKING RULES!!!!
This is the most intense staring competition I've seen
Wilders team could literally bore a glass eye to sleep! 🥱🥱🥱🥱
Wilder has lost his mind. He absolutely is a beast and capable of beating just about any heavyweight, just not fury not now. Wilder should fight some other contender like a ruiz and get his confidence back up before fury. Nobody wants to see this again anyways. We want to see one of these guys go against Joshua.
Wilder looks focus af. That's what he needs to win, dat laser focus with intensity. The 3rd fight finna be INSANE
Fury is by far the better fighter, but with Wilder's power, the fights are always 50/50.
There’s only onnnneeee billy joe Saunders !!!!😂😂😂😂
This one here hits different BOMMMBSQAUD ALL DA WAY !!!
just kiss already
I think they're are in love! 😍
This reminds me of Ngannou v Lewis 1
Wilders an embarrasment to boxing 🥊
has this man had a brain scan in awhile he seems only to be able to say 1 thing, is he a tard? real question. like that's really cool if he is and sorry if he isn't no disrespect just entirely how he comes off right?
The faceoff is clearly different for wilder, he's an emotionally unstable person and in his mind he's looking at the person who ruined his life; hopefully he dedicated all that mental instability and crazy-person hate into training and getting better, the match would be really interesting if he comes out there with new tools; so far it's pretty clear that wilder's game plan will be going to the body and hoping that fury eventually lowers his hands enough for him to land a clean shot to his head; it might actually work, heavyweights are usually not very skilled; he needs to be a bit more careful of fury's offense this time though, he should be good if he went hard into working on his defense; basically wilder needs to not be wilder to win, but given his great athletic gifts, people hope he makes leaps in his skill level so he can become an impressive boxer down the line
I want to see the hype men from both teams fight each other on the undercard
I hope Wilder knocks Fury ass to the canvas for cheating with them no cushion gloves that dented that man's head if Wilder would have socked him out on stage  and said  fuuk the fight I would not blame him ...👊
Shoulda kept the shades on, boy lookin' scared as hell
Why would he fight him again? I thought he "cheated" last time? Lol
Tyson, most disgusting heavy weight of all time.
“What is happening “ idk why that was hella annoying to me💀
Their cornerman did more to hype the fight up lol
The man saying "two times" got me fucked up
Brudda them jeans wilder got on, NOT it.. 😂😂😂
I I wonder what his excuse going to be the second time you loses
Lol
The main energy in this stare down was in Wilders headphone batteries...
19 rounds boxed and Tyson has won at least 17. You're in for a beating AGAIN, Deontay....
Won’t help you deontay
Tyson Fury all the way
The body language experts are out in force tonight 😂
Faaaa.....∞ce off
What’s going through TF mind?…
Thats the best DadBod Champ rt there
Fury is going to put a metal plate in his glove again I don't trust him.
Don't they have any other people to fight.  For the last 3 years they have only fought each other
Bomb squad again? 🤣 they gonna forget to pull the pin out of the grenade again! Ain’t no squad in a boxing ring dickheads.
Wilder looks like a bit of a broken man
Sigma Male sh** right here
Feel sorry for wilder gonna get smashed again he just can’t outbox Tyson that simple
Read like 6 diferrent comments from some simps that a cheering that cheating piece of shit fury wilder is going to kill him and he doesnt even know it he tginks his the shit and its not
"Two time! Two time! Two Time! Two time!"  85 IQ
longest faceoff ever lol
I know he usually looked out of shape before but damn, looks like the wrong man took off his shirt.
If Wilder doesn't go into the fight with the aim of ripping Fury's head off, and does some combinations going for the body as well. I foresee him getting that body his always wanted on his record.
Wilder is pissed at the internet rn.
2 time " " " " " ".
Damn, Fury ain't looking all that good, or in shape.....I hope he burns that belly off it may be a long fight again.
Wilders headphones - "some where over the rainbow "
there still at it "to this daaayy!"
i swear tyson was taller than him in the last fight
I thought wilder was winning the stare down but then u have to realize he is jamming out. Plus turned away first. I have to give it to fury... either way epic staredown
Switch to Raycons, those headphones are heavy af
Wilder is looking at this guy like “oh shit...not again....”
I wouldnt want to fuckle with the muscle on the left there mate. hes gotten lean AND heavy, hes about to school wilder again. and i LIKE wilder but we'll see if this new trainer is truly different for him.
Nobody wanted this
Once they know they can’t intimidate the gypsie king they already lost
Fury 3-0 Wilder 💪
2 time 2time you say it more than twice you just look stupid
Why does he keep shouting 2 times 😂 does he mean we all know Deontay lost 2 times lol plus trying to intimidate real fighting men won’t help the inevitable outcome here if I were part of the Bumsquad I’d keep quite it’s embarrassing we all saw what happened last time.
Tyson Fury is much better in this Game but Wilder have that right hand only,,, we will see fight last two was entertaining ;D
Lowkey looks like Wilder has murder running through his mind..
Wilder is going to knock Fury out‼️ Can’t cheat this time.
Larsa Pippen got a new job
They really like repeating themselves don’t they?? Fucking ignorant dude. 😂🤦‍♂️🙄🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ “two time, two time, two time, two time, two time, two time, two time, two time, two time, two time, two time, two time, two time, two time, two tiiiiiime, two tiiiime, two tiiime, two tiiiimmme.” 🤦‍♂️  “BOOOOMB SQUAD, BOOOMB SQUAD, BOOOMB SQUAD.” Just STFU and fight. I swear they LOVE hearing themselves talk.🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😂😂
Hope the fight doesnt last as long as the stare down. Roll on fury aj. COME ON FURYYYY
Fury. This is all hype. Fury to win this either way. I think.
Anyone see Deontay twerking a while ago... well scary guy
bum squad bronze dosser
Tyson said he ain’t ever ever ever going to a gym
Tysons in fight mode now . There's no chance he'll be taking this fight lightly.
Let's go Wilder.Bout to k.o this UK bumb.🔥💪🏿🦁💯
Too much of one thing can be bad for you, wilder wants it too bad that he’s not even willing to normally do press without the headphones & sunglasses which could be his early down fall
Wilder seriously doesn't look healthy, look how skinny his face and neck is, what happened? He looks like a crackhead, he looks frail. I feel he looks even skinnier now.
Wilder is going to destroy him this time ⌚
Fury with the ultimate dad bod
Not worth watching anymore.  AJ vs TF is much better to watch in my opinion.  I think Wilder is washed up, exposed and needs a tune up fight.
Wilder sucks.
He’s listening to baby shark....to calm the nerves
Wilder already lost
Hahahahaha this gonna be fire 🔥
Tyson scared see the way he was swallowing he got more back fat then anything he looks like shit and the new 2 time
Lovers quirl
Change title to longest face-off ever and then wilder looks away please
Headphones on blast: "I'm a barbie girl... In a barbie worlddddd"
Wilders new coach is 40 pounds heavier than his last coach, that's why he lost the stare down.
Wilder is listening to motivational speeches and drowning out the people telling him he is about to get an azz whipping. 🤣🤣
Ridicolo
It’s crazy how everyone is talking shit about Wilder behind a scru but they would definitely not say shit in person.  Plz grow up!!!!!!
Wilder needed to replace his diaper, hence the swift departure.
GYPSY TAKEOVER💯💯😂 Everyone in the room moving but the gypsies, solid!
Wilder oh shit it's the next song already 😳
I knew this was going to happen but not this quick, fury has a lot to lose if wilder wins, furys unification fight with Joshua would be ruined, but so looking forward to this 🥊🥊
0:51 I loved wilder
You could see Fury was scared.
All i heard was " farqaud" and "two times"
Tyson “The Cheating Cokehead” Fury won’t be able to cheat this fight because the world will be watching his gloves very closely.
First to leave loses
Fury look nervous af - almost like he know wilder gon kill him now that he cant cheat
Careful Deontay those headphones might be a bit too heavy for you pal.
I think that one guys name is Two Time and he is in fact handicap
Whos aura stronger
oh man i hope he reads the comments (wilder) why the fuck do we need to see a 3rd when the first 2 fury won is beyond me
ahhahahah
And New! Let's go Champ. All you Tyson d riders I hope you choke on it
Fury looked quite uncomfortable
Beyoncé only here for a good hiding and a cheaqe
Rent Free.... in Wilder's head.
Deontay calmer (NOT WILDER) ..
English louts shaming our country again-nothing changes
You can see the fear in Wilder... obvious.
Better choice a good excuse this time 🤣🤣🤣🤣 he is losing for sure 🤣🤣🤣
Honestly, with the way Tyson looks  It will be great shame if Wilder loses again 😂😂 But he probably will 🤦🏾‍♂️🤣🤣🤣.
Wilder is that guy no one wanted at their birthday party but his parents convinced your parents to invite him and now you gotta put up with him for a whole night...
He just beat him for the 3rd time 😂😂😂😂😂
Fury is all torso no ass.
Has Tyson put on chub?? I hope he's focused and not going off the rails again
Tyson been doin' that Deji workout I see
Idk why but i think that Wilder wins.
This was an awkward face off tbh
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
I think I love Shane more than Tyson he’s the man hahaha 4 eyed prick I haven’t heard that since high school
Wait they are fighting AGAIN??? 😂😂😂
Tyson would've stayed there all day lbsh..
Wtf is fury flexing for. Should have kept his shirt on lol
Bum squad!   Funny to see stig of the dump rock up behind Fury stinking out the stage.
Why are they acting like they in love!
Can Wilder's windmill power finally defeat Fury? Find out in the next episode😎
I wonder what Wilder was thinking during this face off 🤔
They were talking thru their mind. Fury: damm you cute Wilder: shit I want to take you out tonight.  Fury: hope you take me tonight and give me that BBC.  Wilder: OFC honey
Same card again...you saying no one else deserves this shot.
Fury is a living legend 👏🤣🙌👌💪
I don't even know why there's a trilogy fury won both fights 🤦‍♂️
I mean who cares about who looks away first. Fury is just gonna beat Wilder again and that’s it🤷.
Lame dosser going to sleep again
This guy saying two time needs to get knocked out before anything!
TWO TIME!!! LoSER!!
Who's the idiot who agreed to a 3 fight clause with these two guys anyway. Nobody wants this fight except Wilder alone.
Whats crazy is no one wants to see this fight
Let goooo wilder !!!!
Bomb squad going to be bombed out the fight
stupid
I heard "  too taa "
I personally feel fury is the greatest heavyweight of all time. Better than ali and Holly field.
This is the weakest f****** heavyweight division ever in the history of the human race
Let's go Tyson fury
I took a nap, woke up and the face off was still going🤦🏾‍♂️
That junkie fury lookin Terrified! Ain’t gone be no tampered gloves this time, wilders about to destroy fury send him back to snortin dope and back into depression cheating fuck. BOMB SQAAAAUUDD #ANDNEW
The weight difference alone will be too much for Wilder to handle... like a heavyweight fighting a middleweight.
Whys the black guy yelling two times? Is he referring to fury winning the first two fights?
I thought the match would have been Fury against Joshua? What's the point here? Fury won twice
fury's gonna fuck him up again. wilder can stare all he likes
Round 1 started already. They fighting under Genjutsu.
Standing there that long was a real workout for Deontays legs, I hope he hasn't lost them.
Wilder ....gotta get his respect back.....
Three time.
they are still facing off.....UNTIL THIS DAY...THIS DAY.....THIS.........DAY
Wilder is a glutton for punishment.
Thats what I like to see
Cameras sound like typewriters 😂
The bronze bum
The face off was a sale defo 💯
Fuck, I wouldn't want to look at my own face for that long let alone someone else's.
Wilder scared
wilder look too skinny, he best go eat or else he losing again
Wilder will win, big Tyson should of listened to his old man.
Wilder out here trying to hide from reality even more then CNN
Wilder- Focused
"my bby dreads are 60 lbs, dats y i lost" wilder
Where the fook did fat Jonah Hill cow from? 😂😂
Hopefully fury puts his gloves on this time
when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object
Can’t wait for Tyson to knock him clean out again
Tyson fury !!!!!!!
Retire this numpty allreadt tyson
Wilder and his fan girls still haven't played the heavy/rigged boxing shoes and socks and mouthpiece cards.  Or maybe acid sweat and opium laced exhalation. The canvas and ropes might be rigged also.
the title is so funny
Seriously how many pictures do you need to take of the same thing?
Made for stupid TV. Everybody knows Wilder is gonna get his ass handed to him!!! The man can’t box!!!
Tyson Fury was playing a mental game where the first one to stop the stare down loses.
Wilder is going to get beat again.
First time I think I saw fury get drawn into a mental game and come out the loser!! It’s weird!! I feel like the last man standing lost!! Hope fury doesn’t take this for granted and smashes wilder but I just have a nasty feeling
who the fucks the guy in the white shirt 😆
The 2nd fight was a humbling experience for Wilder, can't wait to see if we see some bombs on fight day!!!???
who watched the whole face off?
Go on big shane
Wilder played this right it’s a statement to the media an the press f### all y’all an your dope phene champ
Damn, Deontay really wants blown eardrums this time. Dude should’ve gone on a win streak for a year or two before attempting this. I guess this is his retirement match.
And they glance at each other soon before their kiss 💋.
Bum squad!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Tysons brother is hilarious.🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is pathetic and a massive NON EVENT! Fury has gone against everything he has stood for over recent years to sign up for this shit show, THIS IS NOT THE FIGHT WE WANT TO SEE
All wilder can here is tyron woodley singing "falling in and out of love in and out of love with you"  I domt blame him, what a song it is
I wanted to see Joshua fight
Parang kagagaling lang ng inuman ni Fury ah. Hahaha
Two times, losing.
thought it was Ajaba for a minuite😂🤣😂
I wonder what song he was listening to🎧🤣
Lmao I loved it. All these officials thinking they're gonna turn or convince these professional monsters 🤣 nah you guys are Sheep and they'll do what they want
Fury shoulds brought an egg weight and then pretended to accidentally drop it out of his bag for Wilder to see .
It’s More Comments than Views!!! 😂 🤣
If only someone would tell Wilder it's embarrassing to wear headphones when you're the center of attention in a room full of people.
500 on wilder who trying to bet !?
Wilder just embrassing himself
Two times defeated is what will happen. Wilder....wilder can't win has no shot. His best punch can't keep.fury down....and fury won't even let that punch connect. Fury will put him on his back foot and knock his ass out again.
Should have brought a shield wouldn’t have lost the stare down
Is Tyson still standing there?
Wtf white guy is fat
Fury going to KO this guy real bad i feel.
Still staring... TILL THIS DAY!!
Fury doesn’t look 6 foot 9. Wilder 6 foot 7 and looks slightly taller.
I hate Wilder but I hope he wins just because the boxing politics have been annoying as fuck and it would piss so much people off.
he gots to wear the headphones to block out tyson from getting in his head 😂😂
Has Wilder gone blind or are those glasses mirrored on the inside cause he sure cant handle looking at Fury in the eyes.... fury wins!!
This stare down is worse than Logan V Floyd🤣
Idiot: Two times!
Tyson fury got the body of a drunk father
bum squad
Let's go Fury knock that guy down 1 more time
coaches had their own staredown
The Gypsy King has got the Ben Askren Dead Bod genes going ... and can still kick anyone's ass :)
Wilder’s cheating… he had headphones!!!
Fury gives me hope and make me feel bad at the same time, I love his confidence without a shirt while looking like me but at the same time,how can someone workout so hard and still look so unimpressive 😆   Might as well give up on the gym Now
Wilder know those headphones too heavy for him why he didn’t tell use earbuds
Wtf
0:51 was like: "remember me boy”😆
Look at these clowns. Smh
God damn I absolutely love Tyson Fury….
You can see fear in wilders eyes
“Two times” yeah you lost two times bro 😅
Lol if deontay gets knocked out again, which is likely
Body goals #Wilder
That’s Wilders psychologist talking to him through the headphones.
July 4th? Wtf?  Fury has a tonne of work to do to get ready.
Haha Wilder can’t even win a staring contest
Wilder can’t handle him.
Black people mad cuz white man winning!!!!
😂😂😂😂 look forward
Wilder is the biggest joke in boxing I bet if he loses this fight he will fucking blame his headphones hahahaahha
Why they both look like GTA Characters who dressed themselves
Why y'all act like Wilder's walkout wasn't cool at all ?
He cheated last time that ass is grass this time
Why is that guy repeating "Tupac"? the last 2 minutes of the video
Hope deontay will not wearing some heavy stuff to the ring again 🤣🤣🤣 . Guy please give him some excuse for this lose again , please help him . 🤣🤣🤣
If you talk smack to these gypsy gentlemen, know now there's going to be fisticuffs
Great now it's going to be some type of stare down challenge on Tik Tok or something
bruh wilder with the headphones is basically admitting you lost already... the FACT he's wearing headphones means he already lost the mental game. what a child haha
Wilder trying to act calm cool and collective like his ass wasn’t knocked out last time time around haha. Fury is on another level.
Where's Dana when you need him.
And the Holy Spirit won again! Haha!!!! Yeah baby!!! God Bless you, the familia and your whole team Tyson!!!! #teamJesus
What does a stare down have to do with any of this. STUPID!!!
wilder will win this time .i am fury fan but something in wilder this time
Fury doesn't look sauced this time.
When you put your controller down to take a piss real fast so your character looks like this
this is similar to the sauna story
“Toon town”
Wilder turned away first.
I don't think Wilder lost the stare down due to heavy headphones, it definitely was the shirt he tied around his waist sources tell me
Headphones = I'm in my safe space where the bad man can't tease me
Real Score is 2-0.. wilder couldn’t win when fury was at his absolute worse. No chance idk why they couldn’t make the AJ match 🤦🏻‍♂️
Why does the boxer’s hype man always have a bigger ego than the boxer? Just obnoxiously annoying.
Oh crap!! Is THIS  the famous Gog  vs Magog War?
Love it
2 time what lol u lost two times wilder
When Wilder Smooth took them shades off and showed ain't No Fear in these eyes..everybody was thinking he was scared to show his eyes because he was scared, nope!.. Earphones are to block out hearing the b.s..and the Silence speaks volumes!!!! Tyson still standing there facing off after it was over like he was scared stuck, i smelled fear. The world is watching too close now so won't be no cheating.
I wonder if they got enough photos
All these joke but wild looks and acts hella different. He’s coming back for his belt and respect. This fight is not going past 3 rounds. Idk who’s gonna win.
wilder gonna get himself KO'd again
They better not clinch a single time in the fight coming up🤣
Wilder by KO
I have a bad feeling Uysk will be fighting Wilder next year for the titles 🤷🏼‍♂️
Wilder is naturally cringey.
I think this is the best face off I’ve ever seen
Tyson probably cheats bit I'll go for him anyways
2x
Make sure ya check fury gloves
wait this i happening again
My cat stares at the neighbours cat like this. I always proceed to press record on my phone just in case they both kick off..
What does 2 time mean why does he keep reminding everyone his boy lost twice😂
I hope Wilder takes this very seriously.
You see fury swallow he scared 😂😂😂
What this is happening I didn't even know 🤣🤣?
Wilder gonna get whooped, fury is too good of a boxer for him
Fury looks like them beers 🍻 are adding up around the mid section 😳
How long can fury hold that belly in!!!
Fury is more black than wilder. LOL
Why are they fighting again should be fury vs joshua
Rumor has it tyson is still standing there to this minute
Most intense staring contest ever
lets go  🔥🔥🔥
Why is the stairdown like an hour? hahahahah 😅
They already made history with longest stare down
two time
Nobody actually wants this fight man
Love in first sights
I woke up from a nap and it’s still going
Fury look like that hood drunk white dude that be at the corner stor lol 😂
Please knock that big dosser out again Tyson xx
You don't wake a sleepwalker and you don't stop a staredown!
Tyson fury look like he has never trained in his life
How many chances are they gonna give wilder?
Muffin top gonna cream the bomber again⚡
I so so hope Tyson puts his lights out, can’t stand wilder does not deserve to be in this position…. Sore sore loser
2 TIME!
Theres something about this that reminds me of fight 1
Looks like grandma made them pants outta the old table cloth😂😂🤣🤣
When 2. King face off
Who's the muffintop behind fury lol
Wilder better walk out in his underwear so he's got no weight excuses this time
Iˇm a fan of Fury but why is everybody making fun of Wilder...he looks sharp and finaly like a boxer not a brawler in my opinion
Shit acting from the bum squad! They already know they’re beat
The only thing interesting about this fight is what Wilder will say if Fury wins again. B.S. fight because we should be having Fury vs Joshua unification .
Let's go wilder
This is what we want folks ...!
Wilder is already defeated and his soul has been captured by Fury. He needed to probably listen to rap songs to boost his ego and morale. Tyson came in with a powerful natural mind. Decide yourself
Why the fuck was this stare down so long lol
I know everyone thinking Tyson is going to win again, but could you imagine if Wilder knocks him out this time around
Wilder and his whole squad are a joke
Wilder is the reason why boxing is unwatchable. Nobody wants to watch this. Fury vs Joshua is the fight and this guy who can't take a loss like a man and then go out get a W to get back in the conversation holding up the fight of the decade!
Well that was a tad awkward.
This is pretty gay. Just like how fake boxing is...
Going to be nuts
as  charles & eddie would say...look into my eyes cant ya  see im paralysed
3rd fight and he still shaped like a bag of milk
Fury woulda stayed there for days!
Wilder just doesn’t stop taking L’s. He’s definitely gonna blame the lighting for making him turn away from the stare off
Wilders going to  😴
That's dude shouting 2 time is a fucking loser 🤣
Why do we have to watch wilder get beat up again
If Deontay hasn't learned any boxing skills since the last time they fought, he should put his money on Fury!
Laugh now cry later. When wilder wins I will be back to comments talkin shit to all the people hating on wilder and rooting for a cheater
Disloyal Malik is gonna lose his job for this staredown loss!!
It's the sauna all over again lol
Fury in 3 in my app
Worst hype ever. Tyson screwed with his mind.  IMO Deontay is scared...
2 time? Do they mean DW got beat twice😆
love how fury takes everything as a mental battle love it he won again
Lets go fury!
Tyson fury with the body goals
Fury is going to have Wilder crying again when he beats him. Oh his gloves were loaded lol stfu cry baby or I was tired because I am a jackass that wears 40 extra pounds to the ring.
All that staring bollocks. Wilder is a proper show pony. And absolutely useless
Winning the smaller battles before the war
Wilder can’t even win the face off 😂😂😂😂
6:03 Run DMC - Walk This Way
I just sat here and watched two men stare at each other for a solid 5 minutes. Maybe I should study for the exam tomorrow.
I'm glad Deontay took his shades off, otherwise that would have been weaksauce.  I expect a similar result, UNLESS Deontay catches him with one of those bombs.  Fury is the better boxer though.
Tyson Fury
This fight needs boycotting to show that we ain’t just gonna accept the big fights not happening in boxing any more, it’s killing the sport and this would be the perfect event
Wilder is using this time to make up excuses
If my calculations are correct there were 12031 pictures taken in total, but only 1 will make the news. Gonna be a rough night going through them
Where’s tommy
Fury has got a lot of work to do state of him
tWo tIMeS
Wilder looking like he put on a little bit of weight. Probably my took a lot to achieve. I can hardly gain weight and I’m slim built like that. Not tall as I’m only about 5’7” but still it’s hard to gain anything and I eat like 4 times a day lol
Booomb squaa--  Sir, sir, he's got his beats by Dre in, he can't hear you.  I just hope the world doesn't turn off again after they fight. Never know what a Tyson might jiggle loose
Wilder Broke...
the beta backs down from the alpha
who is the tard who kept yelling 2 tiaaam
watching this high is crazy
Love handles V Abbs  3
Mate this is so childish by Deontay like in what world does he think that is an appropriate thing to do, just makes you look weak if anything, what's the point of him even showing up LOL
Rumor has it after this they fell in love and now share a 1 bedroom loft with a poodle named the gypsy bomber.
Man I hope this clown is getting bomb squaded again by Fury!
Well this was awkward... lol
I see hes growing some protection on his chin
What is it with these yanks just repeating themselves over and over again - imagine being the bloke saying ‘two times’ repeatedly. Zero wit, zero humour, zero banter.
wilder looks taller than fury now or am i tripping.
Its the year 2050 and Tyson Fury still hasn't moved
Deontay looks straight up scared
Fury won the fight already with the stare off
2-0 in the sauna
Ps 6:05 Wilder walked away from the faceoff  Thank me later
NO TALK GET DAT BODY 🤫🤫🤫💣💣💣
for 6 mins? wtf
Wilder's cheating, he could be blinking, we'd never know 🤣
Wilder needs to wear the sauron suit again to the fight.
Fat dude really brought out the “four eyes” insult 🤦🏾‍♂️
Wilder is not there for the conversation
Nobody wants to see this joke of a fight.
Ole fury is built like a bag of milk lmao
How is that body a boxer?
Dad bod winning right now.
Big shane would do wilder and his team let alone tyson up the boys! beat the man 2wice the champ!! Gedd up 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Fury vs wilder 3? But why tho.....
WHEN THE F WAS THIS MADE OFFICIAL? Hah wow.
UFC much more exciting better story  other than main event this will be boring as watching dan orange on CNN
The stare down just got weird after a while
Can’t wait to hear the excuses black people make when wilder looses AGAIN 😂😂😂😂
THE FUCK? Didn't even know they were doin it again... Why
Fury does 15 rounds in the sauna so a 6 min stareoff is light work lol
Who was fatty giving it all the mouth like he was going to do something?
Come on Tyson 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
this is waist of time we could have had one of the biggest boxing fights in history
Hopefully wilder shows up for this fight
(2 time)
Bruh I thought fury was gonna fight aj. This is just gonna be another whooping to wilder
Broo its bouta be More of the *SAAAME*  🤦🏿‍♂
Chocolate vs Oreo, EVERYONE knows Oreo is the champ of a tasty VICTORY!
Should be Joshua..
Has wilder grown  taller🤔
The love!
I'm under 150#'s. I'd fight and or 'box' "Tyson", just to prove how fake this shit is.
This fight literally means nothing to me. Especially after fury dominated the other two fights
Planed planed planed!!! Fury will arrange the fight between him and AJ before he fights wilder and wilder will win then AJ won't get a look in! Look Fury isn't even saying a word to wilder even though he got earphones on,, that's competely unusual!!
Такой дебильный момент в этих битвах взглядов👎👎👎 в чем прикол так по 15 минут на битве взглядов стоять??? Скажите уже кто нибудь что хватит! Ато они ведь так долго будут стоять, и никто из них не уйдёт потому что думают что соперник подумает как будто тот испугался!!! 😬😬😬
Best out of date fashion victims of all time
1 more minute and they were falling in love
The first actual stare down ever recorded.
Nikola Jokic, Tyson Fury, Luka Doncic...anyone else we can add to this list?
Wilder looks scared and zoned out
I hope gravity does not affect Wilders weight lol ijs
Wilder looked like a killer to be fair, n fury was fidgeting a bit, but then wilder walked off
Atleast every journalist had time to take photos
Fury will knock him out 1st round
I do believe you can only say 2 time squad is when you have actually became world champion twice.
I wouldn't fight a guy who put a dent in my skull but maybe the dent is what makes this man dumb enough to want to fight him again
I have a feeling furys mental health is slipping
Let’s go fury!
Fury gonna destroy wilder again
60lbs headphones
wilder had the time to listen to Joe Rogan's podcast during that face off
No more loaded gloves!
Why is that guy saying 2 times over and over??  Is he talking about the 2 x Wilder fought and didn't win against Fury??
Wilder looks like a mad dog that didnt eat for weeks
Fury man is gonna fk him up this time Tyson has wilders number
How does Wilder looks the same height as Fury. In their 2nd match Fury seemed taller. M confused.
If I was fury I'd be stood there playing... I GET KNOCKED DOWN BUT I GET UP AGAIN YOULL NEVER KEEP ME DOWN YOU BUM!.... I beat you once.. I beat you twice and guess who wins the 3rd... fury probably won't even work out for this fight.. let's face it when you lose to a man twice..  you have to have a big heart to come back and win.. and wilder just doesn't... he just wants to cash in again b4 he is finished..
Fury looking like he’s been eating lots of pizza
Ya big ugly dosser
Are they going to fight again after fury wins😒
🥊🥉💣🥊
Wilder only wants the payday...embarrassing!
Think they just felt in love with eqch other
You may now kiss then bride
Wilder finna kill this man......  No floppy gloves this time.  One has the look of a man that has been wronged. One has the look of a man that is wondering "how can I get my gloves to flop this time..."  Fury knows, he isn't even trying to talk... Look at his mannerisms. That boy shook! His daddy shook and Ricky Hatton shook.
"My jheris weighed in at about 40 ounces" -Idk some dosser prolly.
The lion 🦁 is silence 🤫.. Go hard man, go very hard we have this trust in you. D. W
Thought this fight wasn't happening,  gassed it is
Can I fight the guy screaming two time on the undercard?
good strategy. keep staring into the eyes of the man that already beat you twice until every level of your psyche is completely saturated with such a foolishly invited image of which in turn will subconsciously overpower all of the "stubborn" delusions that your consciousness is forever unable to come to terms with. then put on your shades and walk away. sweet dreams!
When you try to take off your sun glasses and intimidate a gypsy... What a joke Deontay is.
Fury really looking out of shape
how and why is fury still not in good shape!?
Tf is you taking you lucky the man ain’t try to kill fury. This is the first time he seen this man since he tried to kill him with his glove gate, with his tampered gloves. He is furious inside and you tell by his stoic demeanor he ain’t trash talking, he ain’t loud, he’s FOUCUSED. A focused man is a dangerous man, that Fraud ass junkie fury reign  will end and he will blow back up and start snorting dope again once wilder is done with him. #ANDNEW
Wilder will ko Fury 100%
super awkward.
Wilders wearing headphones so he can’t hear fury that’s how you know he got in his head in the 2 previous fights 🤣
wow tyson is really taking this fight seriously. just look at the shape he’s in 💪
I’ll bet anyone in the comments 10k that wilder wins the fight
Two world records broken here. longest boxing stare down, the most times someone has said "two time" consecutively. 😂
How many times are these 2 gonna fight?
Grateful we got some decent fights in the heavyweight division again not sure why people can’t appreciate and not senselessly hate whatever the outcome from the looks of this personal face off it’s gonna be good ✊🏽🤛🏽👏🏽
Wilder in f...good shape man!
Tyson about to make it 3-0 against the bum bomber
I fw both these guys.
What happened to fury vs joshua?
Joshua 1:8
He’s humble this time around 😝
GodamnTyson, you look like my uncle. Put a shirt on mate!
It’s amaZing how fury delivered wilders first loss after 40 fights
Fury gon lose
I hope Fury ends this mans career
First love 🤣
Wilder pajac
Tyson will beat  this excuse making no skill bum up again.
Fury wins.
Wilder.......going to need more smoke blown up my ass to beat this monster !!!!!
Fury got personal probz at the moment so I'm going £100 bet on wilder he looks in good shape got to say fury looks fat
i clicked on this video to say Tyson is a pussy not to fight AJ
I honestly wanted to reach through the screen and crack the annoying tit who kept repeatedly saying "TWO TIME" - I wish someone would have throttled the berk
4 eyed prick? How dare you! I wear glasses and I'm deeply upended. Offended. Bellended. Ugh...I'm tired. Night.
I wonder what type of excuses wilder will come up with after this one?🤔
Wilder finna beat his ass this time
Wilder more calm now lol
Wilder got taller
Can the world just come to the appropriate consensus that Wilder is a dosser and a bum who should retire? The notion he even wins a round is preposterous.
Haha wilder is a bum an his brother is a bigger bum
Wilder needs to add on some weight and keep his speed if he wants to stand a chance.
Fury is getting tko'd this time and there will be no cheating with his unpaded gloves or peds... lights out
HYPE!!!!!!!! ❤️
I like fury bt I hope wilder got some good boxing coaches I got wilder on this one
Let’s see if his gloves flop around this time.
It kills me how bad boxing stuff is and UFC has it going on.
Wilder looks like he wants to say sorry  🤣🤣
Why does the deranged bumsquad guy keep shouting 2 time?
Shutting his mouth is the secret
Till this day! Till this day!
Sorry fury going down...
I think they low key gay, and secretly love each other
Are those headphones so Fury doesn’t fuck with his head by saying things too him . 🤣 pathetic .
That bellend in Wilders corner acting tough in front of the best heavyweight on the planet is so hilarious 😂Swear its the same prick as last time.
The fact he needed headphones to be confident enough to stare Tyson down says it all.
No one cares about fury Vs wilder 3
You yanks love to act... Wilder there's levels bro
Tyson getting smashed Over convenient this time
Wilder will lose, hes wearing headphones to protect his ears sunglasses for his eyes and he cas a sweater wrapped for comfort around his waist. Idk looks like fury is pretty confident
Not that he will, but what if Wilder wins this one. Would there be another rematch? Where would it end.
theres no talking but theres a lot of typing in the background
Them headphones look heavy
Wilders wearing high heels. He must be twerking later.
wilder is the champion!!!!
Them eyes have to burn like hell after a staring at each other for 5 mins straight
Am I high or could this whole video just be an image
Fully grown men shouting "Bomb Squad". Gee I'll bet Tyson is shi**ing himself 😂
Bum squad
Who ever is repeating 2 times a thousand times is so annoying.
I'll be that 1 camera man that takes 1 pictures and keep it moving. Barr shutter sounds for two men just standing still lol
Hiding behind shades and head phones. Fury has already won the mental games without saying 1 word
This os necessari?
That's love for you.
Lets go wilder 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸.  Beat that cheater !
Finally a boxing match to watch!! I didn't know this was happening til I seen this vid
Wilder looks broken
Wilder tried to do the intimidating thing which didn’t work. Tyson Fury is a completely different animal the man doesn’t fear his opponent. If Wilder thinks he can defeat Fury before getting Fury in the ring he’s sadly mistaking.
Wilder. I lost because I went deaf by dre beats I don't recommend them. I couldn't hear what my corner was telling me to do. Ps my water is still poisoned.
Deontay better not wear a costume for this bout
Beats are irrelevant just like deontay wilder
Is this video or picture?
Wilder is gonna get destroyed again lol the first fight wasn't even close though so it's just a money fight 😂
This is legendary face off
Tyson ((Gypsy white spell magic)) vs Wilder ((black magic/voodoo spell)) energy transfer 😲
Hahah okay well I’ll be the realist in this comment section and say check fury’s cheating, floppy ass, half on his hand gloves before this one.
The fat dude looks like the Burger King Mascot 😂😂😂😂😂
Wilder giving himself the head space he needs to come up with his next batch of excuses.
Legend says, Tyson Fury is still standing there. As the entertainment team dismantle the stage around him.
I think Fury is going to beat Wilder.
The legend says they are still looking at each other till this day
Hope they fix his gloves this time.
Did anyone else not know this was happening
2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time, 2 time. Words not your strong point eh!?!?
The cheat needs to leave boxing for good.
When do they start kissing?
DIRTY CHEAT
Yep! Fury won't see Wilder coming this time hopefully they knock him right because the state of Mentality that Wilder is at is freakin Unique and the fight might end up very bad, just like Nganou vs Miocic 2 Tyson Fury will lose S E R I O U S just an opinion though but remember this comment Wilder won these time.
Kind of romantic
Dontay Milder: “I Lost the stare down because my shirt around my waist damaged my spine and the chain destroyed my neck and the headphones were mushing my brain”
Wtf
Wilder continue de faire le vador lool furry va l'endormir encore rien que pour sa vue que wilfer veut tuer dans sa carrière lool qui redescend sur terre ce martyr
Can someone please help that bloke with the stutter do his 2 times table.
You know Deontay is listening to Bad Sharon!!
2 time what?
tyson look like a squishy potato and deontay look like a line backer'
Fury's gonna knock the demons out of wilder again
Just make out already 😂
Go fury!!!!
This fight is going to be crazy!
yea… wilder getting washed again
wilder is a str8 clown,fury gon beat his ass again.
Still more action than a dragonball z episode
So what exactly happened with fury vs joshua? I heard for a second that they were supposed to fight first
lmao imagine if a shitty song came on and wilder couldnt help but change it
Headphones wont help him on the night he will have to listen to Fury.He gets inside Wilders head & makes him 2nd guess himself. Both great fighters & brave men but Fury wins the 3rd meet in my opinion.Too much money at stake with a homegrown match up with Joshua.
The fact that Wilder has to wear headphones to block out Fury means he's got a permanent home inside his head...lol
Jesus what is this hype.. Gosh
And the legend says ....He is still saying 2 times................... .......................
Headphones not a good look after the last result. You need to be all senses live surely, if you want to put the right message across? Fury put the last fight message across very well
legends has it that they are still staring of in each other eyes to this day
Wilder tryna look at Fury like he’s going to scare him lol they have boxed 19 rounds so far and Fury has won 17 Rounds and was robbed in their 1st fight and Easily won the second fight. Wilder ain’t scaring anybody anymore, his “ora” is gone. Fury beat the brakes off him last time around.
egg weights lol what a joker
i thought fury was fighting joshua lmao... "theyre all pussys lad" LMAO
He seen that corny shit wasn’t working so he tried to get serious.
Fury is better fighter we know. but loss to some who doesn't look prepared, I know boxing is more than a six pack but man wilder looks like someone who put the work on it
I am a fury fan but know the real when I see it watch yall gonna see
Now we’ll start seeing 2h stare downs ffs
Fury just might be the body Wilder Catches in the ring
Forget the jokes for a second.... I haven't been this excited for a real heavyweight bout in years!!!!!!!! Fury is the man win lose or draw.... he's game to prove it and that's what counts.. what makes this so exciting is wilder realllllly wants it now... he may even win.... then what? Gassed to the gills mate!!!!
I want to see the correct angle on that look off as Wilder seems to have lifts in his shoes, or goth sneakers on. Lol
Don’t waste your time watching this. It’s too big blokes looking at each other for a few minutes. Boring.
Some funny comments 😂 class
A je zgodan ovaj dlakavi 😂😂😂😂. Ko tetrapak je građen 😂😂
Tyson brothers hard as hell standing behind tyson lol.  Whos the idiot saying '2 time' over and over
I don't really care for Fury but anyone is better than Wilder and his excuses
Deontay looks so butt hurt that he got a hiding and hes trying to make up for it with anger and by being staunch. I have to say he looks like an idiot and with that attitude, hes going to get another hiding! I bet he still thinks Tyson Fury cheated or something. Straight delusional and he is going to ruin his career.
Am Looking at these comments and there all a joke this is gonna be a serious fight wilder looking to rip Tyson head off and tyson can feel it
Fury will murk him
Tyson takes a a big gulp during stare down at 0:37 seconds
Legend has it their still staring at eachother
They say they both are still facing off till this day
What's the point in this?? I hope the headphones Dont weigh to much
Wtf is going on with this 'Two time' guy, damn, he on some heavy shit 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Men be like“im not gay” then stare in a mans eyes for 25 minutes.
why is this match even taking place? What has tyson got to prove yet? Wilder looks lost after getting outclassed twice. Fury should fight Joshua and cement his legacy.
Fury looked tired in standing
Damm wilder gonna ko him .fury looks  scared lol I look into his soul u can see his fear
Some say they were making love with the eyss
There is only one Shane Fury!
That white boy better get back in the gym what are you doing put your f****** shirt on
I wonder how many shit talkers will come back to this post and congratulate Wilder if he wins..... (crickets??)
Wilder was listening to a song, was waiting for it to finish to finish his stare down
Soulmates.
Haha damn you guys don’t know shit about boxing Tyson is in trouble 😈
Omg! I hate when people just start chanting something over and over.
Look into his soul
Fury and wilder both need to simultaneously pinch the fuck knuckle who keeps repeating "two time!" God damn idiot  lmao
i think the photographers have enough pictures
Body of a grandpa.. All I can hear is the song, look into my eyes...
"This Is Turning Into A Real Marriage."
Looks like fury ain't 6.9 after all they  both look the same height
When Wilder loses this 1, he'll be blaming the fact he changed his hair and his dreads were to heavy
wilders team full of loud mouths
The guy on the left is not on PED's. The guy on the right is.
Fury will win his mindset and skill is next level
Deontay can't handle Tyson's trash talk that's why he's got headphones on lol
Conor KO's them both EZ
Tyson is still undefeated in the sauna... never forget
Wilder lost 50% of his energy from the face off alone
Init mad when they have people 2 stop them going ag each other they do it but when no one there they don't even do if false as fuck
Does that fat guy really think he is a fighter?
Nobody cares
They stared at each other longer than they boxed
So glad Shane is there with Fury, he's definitely in good hands.
Wilder definitely WON That stare down.
Guys I think it's 2 time
Wilder's gonna get battered again and he'll never get a title shot again
The cameras ran out of roll before they finished the stare down
This time Wilder isn't taking any chances.. he is going to walk out in a ultra light disposable hospital gown.
Deontay Wilder NOT PLAYING NO GAMES Fury over here laughing but Deontay taking this seriously
Wilder looks taller now
Fury does not like silence. He looked uncomfortable
Wilder looks like a year 7 with the jumper around his waist 😂
I laughed so hard when I watched this live ,haha.
Tyson looks SOOOOOOOOOOOO DISINTERESTED....and also a little annoyed...should be Joshua in front of him...not this waste of space.
We all should credit Fury as he has the full ability either way to do what he did, be furious, or clown Wilder with comedy and he wins anyway you put it.
Wilder look dominant
Catching 3 Ls from the same man will deny him the right to ever call himself the baddest man on the planet
Furys brother actually made them shut up and go away lmao
That was the most romantic thing I have ever seen 😍
Wilder’s yes men are going to get him several hurt, throwing in the towel in the last fight was the only thing that went right for him last fight. Bomb Squad is just lame btw
Beats headphones loved the length of this staredown. Lolllll
The fight the world doesn't want or need. Wilder doesn't even want the fight. He quietly tried to blackmail Fury for the $20m step-aside money, until Fury exposed him, now he has to act like he really wants the fight to save face. They only have themselves to blame; they signed for a second and third fight deal, purely to try and block AJ from the belt. I expect Fury to end it quickly once again, but it would be extremely embarrassing if he loses
Tyson already beat him that's tyson way of mind games at it's best best face off iv see
Tyson is built like an adult Bobby hill
Fury moins fit que la dernière fois......
who cares about this fight anyway? everyone knows the score is already 2-0 Fury.
Crazy
Yo look at Wilder chin if a uppercut....nvm🙏🏽😪
What a f****** joke this is
Bum squad
I'm surprised Wilder can  stand up so long with the weight of his headphones,oops I spoke to soon he's gone for a lie down now
Tyson gonna smoke em lol
This time let Wilder enter the ring Naked that way if he lose their will be no excuse
I feel Deontay can win if he can keep Tyson from walking him down. Just my opinion tho
Both of them beat joshua...fury outboxes and wilder out powers him they both beat joshua by knockout (yes joshua jaw is suspect not only because the andy ruiz knockout but because klitscho almost slept him (klitscho at heavyweight had like a 55-60% knockout ratio which means he is as light handed a heavyweight champ as there has ever been) and klitscho was coming off a 2 year retirement i say that 2 say this fight is the real fight to see who is the best (yes technic wise joshua is better then wilder but the right hand does land on joshua sorry his defense isn't close to that of fury) heavyweight the winner will eat joshua's lunch and then i think maybe a rematch or the loser of wilder fury might also get a crack at him and also beat joshua so don't be surprised if joshua has 3 more loses on his record between now and the end of 2022 and he retires
I'm surprised his legs managed to stand up for that long with those heavy head phones he had on 👀
I’m sure wilders hair grew in that face off
We can't have no heavy weight champ with all that back fat bro 🤣
The guy shouting out "two time" is he ok? Someone should check on him
Clash of the Titans.
I didn’t even know this fight was a thing lol
Fury  looks really fat ?is he out of shape or something? Still think he win 🤔
Fury got a case of back ass
Why is this garbage channel in my feed?
Wilder bout to walk out in a speedo for the trilogy
Let's go Fury
Why is anyone liking this? Noone wants to see this fight.
Wilder listening to the long version of IN-A-GADDA-DA-VIDA by Iron Butterfly. Fury thinking about the buffet. Time flew by...
I'll still to this day never understand how someone with a dad bod can come out and box for 12 rounds in the most physically gruelling sport and manage to defeat what looks like the fucking LeBron James of boxing. Boggles my mind.
Ahhh and fury will ko this bum over and over again
"me perdí en tus ojos"
All a fix wilder wins an then 4th rematch boxing most tired sport in world wake up people more fixed than the covid bullshit bug we still buy it jokes all of them
Fury looks like he just won the Biggest Loser and is hella proud.
Long face-off 😜 they missed each other 😜
Bro that was the longest stardown ever
Fury was trying to clown around but Wilder wasn't having it. Wilder was super focused, and with his new trainer I think he can take this one and win the trilogy.
Wilders team making him look a joke again
Wilder won both fight previous but got cheated. Hope he doesn’t get cheated this time
I don’t understand how they could still be mad at each other. That shit went on for too long.
Furry was trying so hard to suck that tummy in he doesent look like he trained for this fight just like when Andy fought Joshua second time around . Wilder might win this one
Trying their hardest to hype this dogshit up lol
Hopefully the fight doesn't end up like this lol, I'm actually pumped for this rematch
wilder shouldnt be aloud to box with the amount of shit he chats
Tyson is getting knocked out cold 🥶
Fake fact : they both were doing eye contact challenge😂
Gypsy king built like a bag of milk. Got to be most successful guy worst body ever in contact sports. Makes Askren in his last one look good
deontay walked away first, LLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
I got 100 dollars that wilder knocks Fury out cold...
They both look like they can't be assed with this 😄
Who was the 5'2" guy yelling  " 2 time " ....?    LMAO .  The other guy had to come up and end it, he was getting embarrassed..lol
Whats going to be deyonces excuse this time?
Wilder on juice now
I like both fighters but I feel like tyson is in dudes head..but anything can happen ...lets go!!!
If looks were deceiving then Tyson fury would get the gold metal.. This man has a dad-bod but is arguably the best HW boxer in the world.
6:14 wilder knows he has this..
Jesus wilder is already beaten 😳😳  I honestly believe this isn't good for wilders brain to take this fight.  God help him.
I see the Wilder jokes but he seems to be very focused and ready for this one...Wilder gets it done in 8 via KO 💪🏾💪🏾
Don’t ever listen to the woman.
This is WAR,this time is a deathmatch 🤤.I love IT
Noise cancelling headphones can't shut out a man that lives in your head 💯
How many times?
Wilder wearing headphones, no music playing. He just dont wanna lose another verbal sparring match let alone the actual fight.
Love the way bro stands behind Tyson throwing jibes...
Tydon gonna do the job again no doubt
They look each others eye so long. I think maybe they meant to be
He lost AGAIN 🤣🤣🤣🥵🥵🥵, atleast win a bloody stare down contest
2×100× kinda cringe tbh
Just go home Deontay
The guy in the back round saying two times...somebody please edit him out and repost the video lol
Legend has it, they're still staring
Is it me or is this fight coming together so fast and secretly. I swear it seems like yesterday fury vs Joshua was made, then it wasn’t, then this fight was supposedly made, now they’re facing off
Everyone has a face untill they get punched in the plan
you can literally see the delusion
Kiss already 🥱
Some say that Fury is still standing there
wilders doing juju black magic
Fury is a pussy for taking the easy route point less fight
Dislike because nobody wants to see this fight.
boxing face offs are shit these days ... what the hell is this
The odds are in Fury's favor because he is the more skilled boxer in the rematch. The odds of wilder changing his game enough to make any difference in game plan is slim. Same Wilder will face a new Fury. If he doesn't get that big punch off its gonna be a rough night taking all those jabs from Fury.
If this fight goes south and fury looses, the world if going to be pissed off at him and his team. We wanted the AJ fight and for whatever reason they didn’t. What’s the point!? I though fury didn’t care about money.
Wilder is so lame. Just saying two time two time. He already lost two time
Fury looks in shape 🍔🍟🥓🍗🍖🍔🍔🍔🍔🥞🥞🥞🥞😂😂😂😂 proper boxers build look at that tyre waist mint
I think the guy yelling two times constantly has tourette's
Why even do this fight? It’s either a Fury win or another tie in the rivalry
Tyson vs. Tyson
Tyson Fury look like somebody squeezed his legs😁
Still i see that dad bud wins tysooooooooooooooon
Wait what? Fury should fight joshua right?  What happend here?
The fact that he is wearing a headphone and sunglasses it means he is scared
This has got to be the saddest and most unneeded trilogy in all of boxing history...
Wilder soo be looking dangerous
Imagine either one of these looking you dead in the eyes like this scary as fuck
Wow that was fucking boring!!
Fury already looking fat and flabby compared to his former shape. His hubris might just lead to a shocking KO by Wilder. Anthony Joshua must be licking his chops
All we can see is 2 dudes staying face to face for 5 minutes. I bet in reality they can read minds they don't need to talk
Not going to lie. Deontay looks different. He is a man on a mission. If was Tyson I would not over look him. Deontay means business. And that is very scary.
that beard looks a tad heavy .....
fire that woman.
Y tf fury’s torso not even breathing n wilders noticeably moving in and out... He wear another suit before the face off? 🤡🤦🏻‍♂️ Damn Fury and still...
Fury tko's wilder , round 2 bets OPEN ZELLE ONLY
My sources tell me Wilder is listening to Barbie Girl by Aqua.
The last time you will hear that dreadful bitch ass bomb squad shit
Notice how Deontay has had headphones in so he can’t listen to Fury’s trash talk, he literally can’t handle the mindgames 😂
Yall talkin all that shit Wilder gone put that punk to sleep WATCH!
Let’s be honest, winning the stare down doesn’t mean jack anymore. Wilder sucks and Tyson is the weird af.  At least they be getting the bag 💰 cuz it’s boxing.
Tyson fury is taking strong deep swallows nervous unconfident swallows
headphones ,sunglasses and he turned away first, fury wins this one again
i hope the fight will be more entertaining than the face-off
Backfat Fury. Why would he take his shirt off looking like that? 🤢
What? Where that happened?
🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
is wilder wearing lifts to make him look taller then fury?
Wilder looks focused!
Dangerous eye !!!
Fury is like I don’t want to fight again man
Fury going to whoop that ass again!! Hide the costumes and the towels, no excuses this time from Wilder!!
Panto season
0:05 me after I lift for two weeks, take a massive morning shit and check myself out looking lean and "cut" after a shower.
Two time, two time, two time, two time, two time, two time... two time loser!
dude fury is taller and arms clearly hand down lower mans got crazy reach what’s his wingspan
Does that face off make wilder 0-3 against fury?
And Still WBC Heavy Weight Champion Of The World Tyson ' The Gypsy King ' Fury.
Fury really don't mind getting those hips out.
Fury wins because he is true boxer with skills not some over hyped boxer they picked fights for  check all of wilders fights and look at the rankings of the fighters late in his career 130 125th rank fighters wilder looses again
Pointless fight. He's not good enough to fight Fury. He hates boxing fans and doesn't want us to see Fury vs AJ. The bronze bummer.
Fury would’ve stood there for 3 hours or however longer he needed too
rumour has it... furys still there l000l
So if and it's a big if wilder wins that will be one each, does anyone really want to see a 4th???
Wilder has some big lifts here, he looks taller than fury
Wilder hiding behind glasses and headphones... tells me everything i need to know.... Fury for an easy win
Love this staredown! Love it!!! I’m ready for this fight!
Shit they pulled this out the hat or what ?? Wasn't fury supposed to be fighting AJ ?? 🤣🤣
Bum squad..
Deontay please beat his a$$
He got headphones on to block the sound so Tyson doesn’t get into his head Lool
Gypsy King!
Deontay Wilder…what a muppet.
Wilder wearing headphones to not have to get out psyched by Tyson.
Take those glasses off so we can look into your soul
I can not wait for this fight !!! To bad Lopez vs kambosos got cancelled smh
Fury is getting knocked the fuck out..
wilder is pathetic hes gotta fucking headphones on hes just their for the pay its just a pretend hard act watch him get knocked the fuck out
Wilder let the rematch clause expire then started crying. We dont want to see Fury smash this bum for a third time, we wanted Fury vs AJ 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Everyone went home but tyson is still standing there alone all night 😂
Go Tyson
Wilder easy win
How many times does he have to beat him, before we get to see Fury vs Joshua?
Why doesnt dana tell them to separate
Is there something dignified about responding to everything with "two time," it just shows no ability to verbally attack or defend
It’s crazy how Wilder looks as tall as Fury here
Legend has it that Mike tyson will be the referee 👏
Wilder July 24...my dreads were too heavy, I couldn’t get in my groove
Man I've never looked at anyone for that long of a silence not even my gf
When dude said "to this day" I lost my shit 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tyson has these fat boys thinking they can eat, never workout and become a great fighter. 😅🤡
Deontay gets KOd again
Wtf?
Pathetic
what the hell happend to fury vs joshua ?
Let's go wilder!
Ngl their is something different in wilders eyes this time, you can tell by fury’s face he knows as well, hopefully this is a good fight
tyson fury put the beast titan skin on
Lose the stair down how stupid no need to stay in that disgusting cheat face!
Mic: "Can we have you face forward to the camera pleeeease." Fury: 🧐 Wilder: 🧐 Cameras: ☠
When you find out your drunk uncle is going to fight Tyson fury
TYSON FURY BODY LANGUAGE SHOWS HE WILL LOSE
How romantic
We wanted Fury vs AJ  You gave us this .  Boxing has fucked the fans in the ass once again.
i dont care about both ... last time i wanted fury to win this time i hope wilder get the W ... its better for boxing
Lmaoooo Deontay on some don't get distracted mindset type shit.  Fury on some I'll beat your ass right here type shit.  Deontay better bring more than "conceive believe achieve" when he steps in the ring.
Did Tyson really cheat with his boxing gloves?
Deontay Wilder asked for a rematch but cant handle the pressers LOL real ownership of your shortcomings
Bom squid gone beat ur butt
A fight nobody wants other than Wilder..
It still hurts that i got TKOed... to this day!!!   -Wilder in my thoughts
Back to elementary school
Shannon Briggs in Wilder headphone be like: "Lets go Champ !" xD
Dosser Squad.
after 5 seconds someone should've said:" I ain't playing this game son, fuck it 😂" and take on the next fucking pose 😂😂
Sounds like a room full of typewriters with all the pictures taken , ridiculous!
Wilder has nothing left to say.  Hes said to much.  Fury wins again.
This time he gone blame the headphones for being too big
Fury wins again then gets called a racist.  Wanna bet
Bro who knew they were even fighting again???? U know boxing is in a shitty place when the two best heavyweights on the planet don’t garner as much attention as two tik tok stars 🥲
If wilder wants to win then he seriously needs to change his fashion stylist for this one 😉😉
Adesanya said it.. own up to it. think that's what Wilder needs to do.
“Two time”. Thats two times Wilder has been beaten by The King
I hope Wilder redeems himself by knocking this gypsy bloke out cold.
FLOPPPY GLLLOOOVVEESSS FLLOOPPPYYY WHHHOOOPPYYY PPOOOPPPYYY GLOVES... 🥊
I wonder if Fury has been eating lots of Boar lately
Let's check them gloves this time so there's no excuse and I hope he doesn't wear a costume that's that heavy 😉
This is going to be a brawl!!
And Tyson won yet again
Tyson gonna get that W again
The Ebonics were embarrassing when he started repeating “two time!” Smh
What the anouncers name?
Furys in his head already l00000000000000000l victim.
Tyson is smart. I would’ve done the same thing. The fight started today at the press conference and Tyson already has a massive advantage psychologically
Wilder was waiting for his song to be over in his headphones
Imagine if on the night of the fight they just come out of the corner in the center of the ring and just restart staring at eachother for 12 rounds. It's a draw again and they gotta do the 4th match lol
Wilder you've been exposed nobody is afraid of you 😂 all u need is cardio..good head movement and press forward on him!
It’s true.. all those wining rats around wilder are such bottom feeders..
Saved my money for this fight, by not paying for Floyd vs Logan 👀
Good to see Deontay getting ready for another dent 👍
When wilder wins , I'll be back here Laughing ...
Fury is going to loose this one, he looks super unmotivated
This was sort of homosexual 😂
Dequantay gonna get bitch slapped
It's like everybodies left the room and left both of them alone
Its always tysons way to win mentally.
This is just showbiz... not boxing
wilder lost the stare down, 1-0 to fury already
Got that jesus chain baby
Damn wilder got all that money and he is wearing some ugly ass shoes!!! I don't care if they are Yeezy's they are Fooqin ugly!!
Lol wilders minds so fragile from the last defeat he has to wear headphones so Fury can’t get in his head more than he already is. LMFAO I’m dead 😂😂😂😂
Only mental midgets wear headphones during big moments
You blinked!
Fuck this stare down shit! I wanna see them in the ring!
That "to this day" 😁😁
Tyson had a smirk on his face and took a step in. Wilder didn't do anything at all. He knows he's going to lose. He's just here for the money
5 years Champ and 10 title defenses but y’all treat Wilder like a nobody because of one loss. Stfu and appreciate them both for going at it one more time.
Who's that special Ed yelling "tuuuuu time"
Jeez they did an aweful job promoting this fight! All I watch is MMA and some boxing news and I haven’t heard a peep about it recently, it’s all Jake Paul shit or the UFC event last weekend with Izzy or Moreno etc. how could they not promote this better?! It’s gonna be a huge fight
Now into the sauna you two  Feats of Strength
fury
Mental victory
The fact he has headphones on is very sus, didn't wanna hear what Tyson had to say. Would say he's already in Wilders head but clearly never left
Tyson built like the beast titan
BUMMMMM SQUAD 😂🖕 Wilders going to sleep this time and better stay away from boxing because he's ran out of excuses!
Wait, that happened so suddenly. Just like that one morning I wake up and it says Tyson vs Wilder 3. Like wtf, how what, shy? Wasn't he suppose to fight Joshua? And Wilder getting another title shot after he got knocked out by Tyson already? Doesn't make any sense to me, can someone clarify?
I sense something different mentally with Wilder. I don't see this as an easy win for Fury. Either way I hope it's an interesting fight.
Wilder bout to hold another L "fOr ThE KuLtuRe"
Lol
😂😂😂 utter shite!
Tyson Fury doesn't look built but he can ko people
The best thing Wilder could do is wear those head phones... He simply can't afford to engage Fury in verbals firings the buildup. Fury's already living in that head rent free.
Deontay wins Fury and in the next match goes against AJ. 🔥
i dont even maintain this eye contact with my girlfriend
Tyson better be scared 😂 bro This man wilder is looking through his soul And not saying a word
BOMB SQUAD!!!!!
those headphones look very heavy ! he may get tired !
I just ate my dinner to this, plenty of entertainment
Wilder wearing lifts in his shoes too
i get it , the man wanna listen what he wanna and use sunglasses. but for those are cheating. it should be banned.
They are running this for the third time??? Wilder has no sense or self respect. He lost twice. First was an award by corrupt judges to be a draw and second fight was a total humiliation by Tyson in the ring. He has nothing to offer. Should get back in the line. After this loss its retirement. Milking the dead cow.
Legend has it they are still staring at each other TIL THIS DAY!
Wilder lost the staredown the moment he stepped up with his sunglasses on like he was Stevie Wonder! 😂
After awhile its just Uncomfortable
Lol 😆 awesome and awkward. Both are like I ain't bout to lose the stare down.
Rumor has it they're still facing off til this day
All those Wilder excuses just ruins the sense of this 3rd fight.. Joshua gets to live another day.
Wait so what happened to the Tyson Fury vs AJ fight did it fell through?
Did they find out why fury’s gloves where floppy? Do you think they will be floppy in this fight ?
Gonna be interesting to see if DEONTAY WILDER is able to use His New Training to Make a Difference This Time Round.
Wilders team had a mic .... Cheating.
Wilders saving every bit of energy to carry his walk out suit
I love how Deontay stands there like he knows something we don't, it's hilarious
The best of 5? 🤔
Plot Twist: Wilder actually thinks Fury has beautiful eyes and Fury thinks the same about Wilder. Both of them just so happened to get lost in each others eyes at the same time. #Goals
He look like he wants to hit em now.
I don't care what ya'll say.  Fact is Kawhi would beat both Wilder & Fury in a game 7.
Man, Tyson's body sure is looking alot like Ben Askrins
This face off lasted longer than all of my relationships 😅
Is it me or is deontay magical like 4 inches taller all of a sudden
Tyson Fury comin' in lookin' like Al Bundy.But still gonna win👊👊👊
How is the media taking pictures the whole video 😂 how many y’all need??
The amount of pictures taken even though they didn’t move😂
I'm just gonna play this and at the end the woo flu will be gone
tyson was trying to provoke him to change face but he remained stoic. Cant really read into wylder too much it will be an interesting fight just off of the way he seems in this presser.
Officially the 2 worse dressed millionaires on the planet.
Wilder looks a broken man already. It will be just be another repeat of what happened
Why are they fighting a third time?
That's right Wilder !
Wilder dead
I knew there was no way fury would break that staredown first
It aint gonna be different from the 2nd fight, fury will win, no question
Fury 3-0 record after that staredown, soon to be 4-0
dude, im so uninterested in this fight. imo fury won the first and he obviously won the second, why do we need a trilogy to this? if it's because fury v joshua fell through then i mean okay i guess but id so much rather see that than this again.
I'm surprised they didn't kiss one another 😂😆😆😂 GTFOH
Haha big boy Shane fury bullying wilders whole camp lmao
"He can't hear you"
why wilder,whyyyy????another ko....pfff
0:28 - 6:03  🎶SHEEEEEEEEEEESH🎶
Fury yo punk cheating ass is in trouble bomb squad
Deontay would have lasted longer during the faceoff but the headphones were too heavy
Legend has it that Tyson fury is still standing there
Man wilder looks sharper now if y’all haven’t seen his sparring lately   BOOOOOMMMMBB SQUUUAADD!!!
He got his music on so Tyson don’t get in to his head 😂
All this just for Wilder to get killed again or Fury to he robbed
Tyson better fucking win this
💭 don’t look away........
Wilder finna get them cheeks clapped again
Fury did have metal plates down his gloves. This time no cheating fury
Meh, not a fan of this fight. First fight was a draw, that's 1-1. Tyson beat him in the second, that's 2-1 for Tyson. Now, if Wilder wins, that'll be 2-2, nothing will be decided. What will they do then, fight for the fourth time to decide who's the better man?!
I wonder what Wilder's excuses will be this time? At least this may be the end of him for good, he doesn't even want to play the mental game anymore, he's over matched everywhere.
fuck this fight
They both dressed goofy as hell, they should be embarrassed to be standing up there for so long looking like that lmao
Lame face-off
Wtf is going on here !? Boxing promoters are a JOKE
Fury probs still stood here for another 15 min
WHEN WILL BE EVENT ???😐🙄🙄 ...
Bumsquad
The white guy looks flabby
Tyson lookin like a 🦃
Didn't realise deontay wilder was that tall
I thought they was gonna kiss 😂😂
Tyson would have stood there for an hour
You think they'll start keeseeng?  I hope they start keeseeng..
Fury confident with his flabs 😅😅😅
Rumour has it the Deontay Wilder has his headphones especially made  to be the optimal weight so he could hold his head up for the stare down
Aj dodger
This is stupid vs Joshua?
Wilder hiding his face while fury's letting it all hang out.
Hopefully Fury's glove padding will be there for the fight this time.
🦆 v 🦆
Wilder is gonna get knocked out. He's a cry baby bum. No excuses this time lol
Wilder had already lost again
This is just sad
Why is this even a rematch, Tyson by rd 8  You don't deserve a rematch after draw, and getting knocked out
Wilder is still afraid of fury's trash talk 😂 that's why he is using headphones 😂 #weakmind 😂
Only in Amerikkka, they root for an opponent from another country
Wilder is officially a BUM
2Ls. 2Ls. 2Ls. 2Ls. 2Ls.
I've just heard they've met each other in the bogs. They're just standing there at the urinals with their old chaps out. Wont budge.
Don’t let them turn off the camera in the changing room
Tyson has won mind games number 1
Someone tell ‘two time’ to shut up! Why is there always that one guy in the entourage talking nonsense?
what is that guy saying TU TAAAA TU TAAA HAHAHA
This fight is gonna go exactly like the second fight
Fury lookin bit fat
Fury living rent free in that mans head.
"He had eggs weights in his dick"
Well we know why Wilder looked away first. Racism. Systemic racism.
2 time 2 time 2 time lol
Wat a war it's going to be
Deonte going out again lmao
Tyson is wearing a 40lb dad bod costume.
I like how that just to have 6 minute starring contest
Wilder came with his eyes covered and ears covered....... I wonder why? Is it to help block out the facts and truths being thrown in his direction?? Dudes a mental pussy
Whoop his ass Deontay 👏
Fury: if he is going to ignore the orders then I’m going to ignore it more!!!
Who’s Tyson’s cheerleader?
Too bad beats headphones 🎧 are terrible quality. Just low quality... all hype
Wilder Poker Face is real. Didn’t even crack a smirk at BOOOOOMB SQUAAAAD
i fell asleep 😪
How many pictures do you need? Jesus
2:55 That was tense. This is awesome!
langasanas campo ni wilder. bum squad😂🥴
That was a little too intimate.
What the fuck is this photographers click sound man so irritating,, world developed so much but stil des sounds on camera...
Wilder and his BUM SQUAD!!!!!!!!!!!!
2x bum squad lol
Awkward
I would start to feel awkward as hell after like 1 minute of standing
Bum squad
Fury looks on coke
Ok we don’t need to see the fight. Tyson just beat him for the third time
A staring contest... That's all Wilder has and he lost.
Wilder got on headphones so he wont hear fury make fun of all the dumbass excuses he pulled off.
Looking forward to seeing wilder get schooled again 😂 this guy owes his career to fury and AJ because nobody cared until they got involved
Wilder will win by knockout 💯💣💥
Tyson tried to keep the strap with some slick legal shit, now that Wilder has learned how to box its a rap on the great white hope. LOL
Wilder said he had to rush back to the gym he left his balls there 😂
always gotta love the mutt barking in the background
What's with Karen trying to break up the face off ffs
Can’t wait to hear all the new excuses from Wilder this time around.
People completely ignore the fact that Tyson cheats like putting his fist in the wrist of his glove or reducing the padding in his glove
Can't fucking wait till Fury knocks Wilder into fucking Oblivion once and for all
I the sign of humiliation if you kiss me on the lips I will leave boxing forever 😂 shake and bake
Fat wins Fights. - John Fury.  Lmao. I love it...let's go Fury!!  No hate to Wilder, but I could see why people are tight about the entire situation. 💯✌️💪✔️
I luv it Fury stayed there like he won the Face off, just like in his mind he won the waiting game in the Sauna against Klitschko, whatever he needs to give himself a mental edge though.  Nobody one that stair down anytime you can look you opponent down like that for that long there no winner eventually someone has to walk away especially when you got your team or the media saying ok gotta go.  So Fury better not let that go to his head the wins matter come fight week just like Teofimo said go ahead n use that energy now I turn mine on come final face off n weigh in.
So whats next best of 4
Surprised they didn’t start kissing🤣
Running, running, running 🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
I'll never ever get this time back...
I'm rooting for Wilder, I hope and pray he worked on his defense!
It seems that Deontay losing for the second time to Tyson wasn't enough so here we go. FURY vs WILDER 3
two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time. two time.
"ill kick you in the face you four eyed prick" had me laughing more than it should have.
Deontay Wilder is going to knock him the f*** out
Wilder just said he had to turn away coz his neck started to hurt from all the neck training he done just before it 😅
Bet deontay wilder was listening to John Legend take me to church song while looking at fury lol
Why is this happening again ? Didn't even know this was a thing ? Which silly tossers will pay for this is beyond me
Deontae need that music for the killer mindset / hype energy. Tyson got it in the third. Actions speak louder than words.
Fury inside 4 rounds
They missed there fight. The stare down lasted 4 years. I think they both lost their lives.
Ngl I really wasn't excited for this fight, but now I am. #TeamFury 👊🏼
Fury wins it.  But imagine Wilder does 😂 What a shit show it would be.  4th fight 🤦🏻‍♂️ meanwhile Anthony Joshua in the retirement home.
tyson bout to get knocked out
I just see violence in wilder‘s eyes. Wilder will knock him out!
Wtf I thought Tyson was fighting Anthony Joshua
Tyson has the body of a butcher. We love to see it
So it’s true , the gypsy are the british 🤣👌🤣🤣🤣
Fury whoops his ass again 5th round tko
Wilder:
Wilder will comeback with a murderous vengeance in this trilogy shii, mans is on some Ivan/Viktor Drago energy
Encarnada tensa
Ok I'm watching this 👀
Let's hope Tyson's gloves are actually padded this time.
Wilder's already lost. Pointless fight
Fury looks to be same height as wilder?
They staring at each other till this DAY
Cant wait! But why so soon?
So stupid
I love Wilder but he doesn't have the boxing skills to win this fight he's just a big Haymaker throwing power puncher in that don't work in the real boxing ring... yes he has a bunch of chance and yes he has the power and yes he could end the night with that perfect punched but I seriously doubt that theory is going to put up with that foolishness so I got Fury winning this
We wanted Aj Vs fury not this
what a waste of time
#bumsquad
I feel they planned to troll everyone w the standoff
Now he'll say: The faceoff was too long, I got tired
Looks like love at 3rd fight
Tysons got that dad bod strength 😁
How the fuck are they fighting again
easy win for Tyson....AGAIN !!!!
romantic
Why do a trilogy if Fury already beat him up twice?
Wilder just wants another paycheck...He's not a champion. He has one tactic.
Fool.  Them headphones and glasses are gonna weigh his neck down
Judging by Furys mentality he was prepared to stand there for days
Kinda romantic. 🥰
KISS ALREADY 😘
Why is this fight even happening....
Ahhh ofc business talks again!
Wilder that scared of being mentally broken he wore headphones the whole time…
I hope wilder improved his armor for the entrance this time
tyson fury so damaged man.. toxic people all about em.. no honor no love makes for no sport..  Should feel blessed not be locked up for the worst cheat in boxing history.. denting in a mans skull with a blunt object.. and believe the higher ups know.. DEONTAY IS THE SYMBOL OF A FIGHTER.. and we should all aspire to be like him.. not fury.. change the world.
They're in love.
why this and not tyson v anthony
Wilder : My headphones were 40 Pounds heavier that's why i lost the staredown and they didn't let me go out on my shield
Im confused.. There should be a fight of Fury vs Joshua what happened?
Someone should really weight those headphones.. It Can cause some serious neck injuries if you lose at boxing
These guys are tough for sure facing each other without any sign of tension knowing you gonna smash each other like mad dogs.
Wilder is wise now, he wasn’t last time, could be interesting
Wait they're fighting again?.. i thought Tyson was fighting Anthony Joshua
Go Gipsy King
Fury looks terribly out of shape, more so than usual.
Bout as exiting as a 3rd beating
6:05 😆
Why do Americans just shout the same words over and over in quick succession. “2 time, 2 time, 2 time, it’s 2 time”
Dude can't even win a stare-off against Fury. What hope has he got?
Me looking at my sibling after they ate the last chicken nugget
That lady in the background was annoying as hell, her voice as she said “what is happening” Was so cringe he. Warm is shut up and let these men face off. Take a stand up there for an hour if they want, for god sake’s everybody’s getting paid millions of dollars
How many pictures of the same thing need to be taken Jesus, sound like a domino run in there
Stare too much to become a lover in the end🥰
One sided conference just like the last 2 fights!
I thought fury would go against Joshua?
Tune in July 24 to witness the Fight that Nobody wants to see.
BUM SQUAD
How many times?
Next excuse  Wilder: the ring hit me as well
Hope the headphones weren't heavy for him!
This is why boxing sucks . You tell them to face off and have no one to stop them ? Just allow them to stare at each other for minutes. Obviously the promotion was hoping for some altercation. Which shows they are desperate
It’s got to depress wylder, that’s the physique of the man who layed him out lol
Has Wilder grown or has Tyson shrunk, tf?
I was willing to die in that face off
This just feels too carried on to be honest this ended the last fight even if Wilder wins Fury still is 2/1 in the trilogy
My headphone is 69 LBS weighs
Plot Twist: Deontay Wilder was listening to Taylor Swift's  "Bad Blood" in his headphones. 🥊🎧🎶
Wilder gonna kick his Ash....
a lot of black people saying shit down here like Wilder cares but fuck it, July got it all, Wilder will keep mouths shut
I loved every minute of the last fight .. what a mid year gift this will be !!!
Hey comon fury stop cheating at the stare down 😂😂😂
The way Wilder wear his sun glasses at the end makes Fury look small😎🥊
Not sure if you heard it but at one point they say "Two Time"
Fury the Cheater, backed up Boxing Mafias and American fans who hate Wilder.... Africa supports you to the core of it...
What a shambolic display from Wilder. He hid behind headphones the entire conference. Terrified of Tyson's mind games. Scared to face the press. Too embarrassed to repeat his ridiculous allegations in front of an audience. I genuinely hope Tyson retires this bum for good.
" Awkward "
Wilder broke first... what a surprise
Plot twist: there telepathically communicating and cant get out the realm of staredowns..
Who's the idiot saying 2 TIMESSS over and over again ??? Is he meaning Deontay LOST 2 TIMES! Or wtf 🤷🏼‍♂️😂😂😂
Floyd could beat both of these clowns
This is lit
Wilder always loses 🤣🤣🤣
I started this video like "No way are they going to do this for 6 minutes"
Did one of them blink?
Wilders got his high heels and two pairs of trousers on for this one!
Wilder in 4 💣💣💣
Gypsy king always for the win. There's only one Tyson fury, There's only one Tyson fury, knock him the hell out. Tyson fury army... There's only one Tyson fury 😁💯💯💯💯💯 come on Tyson
The fact wilder is out here with sunglasses and headphones on already tells me that he is done. His body language spews fear.
Fucking guys fanboying like wilder not gonna get his ass beat again. It wasn't even close last fight.
Y r they doing a third one wtf
Who's the fat one talking shit behind fury? His brother?
Wilder needs his headphones 🤦🏻‍♂️ 3rd fight a joke
First 2 fights I KNEW Tyson Fury was going to beat the breaks off of wilder from start to finish, but that look Wilder has now is that of a man who’s been somewhere dark.. idk how this fight is going to go but I can tell Deontay is not quitting in that ring unless he dies.. this will be the best of all of their fights for sure.
Dumb
That's probably the longest they've stared in anyone's eyes
Dafuq i just watched 🤣🤣🤣 Wilder is trying soo hard to look tough but looks cringe 😂😂😂
Bruh this is just awkward.
Nobody wants to see this shit again wtf
Wilder: Acting Strong Fury: Imma knock this
where's AJ tht fukin dosser
Why is wilder wearing skinny jeans
Deontay ready to get beat down AGAIN.
I fast-forwarded the video and cracked that they didn't move an inch
@1:17 cringe “and new”
Fury shaped like Adam Sandler lol     & I'm still hoping Wilder beat his a$$ Till dis day!!!!
Popular Opinion: Every single one of ya'll agrees that Tyson Fury Sequel made our day better
Fury looking plump
Fury 3-0 against the bum
Sill funny a guy with Fury's body is the best in the world
Tyson doesn’t miss mental battles
Wilder got shook when he saw the Boogieman again. His cerebellum froze his whole body lol
Fury going to have to knock him out bias judges will go with wilder
Why the fuck Tyson be getting out of shape like this between fights reminds me of Riddick Bowe in between fights frustrating
This video was about %101; Two Time Two Time
Guy saying 2 times constantly has clearly read to many psychology books
🤣"Bum Squad" 🤣 classic
That was one hell of a stare down
Tyson may just kill him this time.
They both ass.
Tyson the king of Dadbods 💪🏻👊
weird...
Wilder getting knocked out His dumb ass headphones and his glasses lol His loud ass hype men in the back Bomb Squad! Lames loud ass cowards
I'd feel awkward to stare at a man that long lol
"cocaine's a  he'll of a drug"
Fury for the TKO!
cringe.
Wilder scared
I hope those head phones weight don’t effect him during the fight … was a long face off
Those head phones look heavy.
This staredown is propably longer than the fight will be
Bye bye wilder
Wilder- ain't so wild after all 🤣🤣
🔥🔥
Bruh I know shape don’t matter and I would 100% get smashed by both of them along with my entire family but…..fury shape like a bag of pennies!!!  I’ll let myself out!
Not a chance in hell Tyson was looking away first. He's a different breed.
Fury won't be getting up this time 💯
Fury killed it. Wilder broke that 3 hour stare down too 🥊 fury has already broken him
Tyson: Sequel Wilder: SCARED
Is fury swaying..
'Never underestimate a man that asn't got anything to lose' einstein. Fury better bring his A game again.
Fury is an inspiration to all the fat chubby guys out there. You CAN be out of shape and one of the best boxers in the world lol
Jesus christ all you can fucking hear is CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK from the fucking cameras good one mac life outdone yourself again
Deontay Wilder left because he didnt pay for his spotify premium and a ad popped up whilst listening to his music
what the hell are the securities gonna do when a fight breaks up
Popular Opinion: Every single one of ya'll agrees that Tyson Fury III daughter made our day better
Zzz
Wilders legz were dead at the end of the staredown his headphones were too heavy
this is lopsided , tyson fury will schooling wilder
That was a long ass staredown, damn.
Let's be honest.. fury beat him twice now, so wilder may have just lost the intimidating edge.. just might off . So what is the point.   Wilder gotta actually box now, good luck to both.
Mental victory🥶
Gypsy king in 8
Popular Opinion: Every single one of ya'll agrees that Tyson Fury Walk made our day better
I just wanna see wilder and his yes men shut up for good.
The headphones are one so that fury can't get in to Wilders head and live rent free.
Annoyed that the Joshua fight isn't happening....
Why does it seem tyson fury is not as good or as ready.. He needs to be just as good as before like the last fight and he win win... Tyson fury needs to think like he is the under dog and put in serious work .. That's all he needs to do and be the same size as before... Come on Tyson fury ! Get intense and hungry like before... He has got me worried cause he just don't seem fired like before.. Hope I'm wrong.. I do not like wilder.. If Tyson fury does lose it will then get him in kill mode again.. I think Tyson fury thinks he doesn't have to be more then 80 percent of what he was to win..
wilder cant handle the talk, so he has headphones on! 1:0 for fury!
Chicken legs going all emo on us now..
A fight nobody cares about, and more importantly why risk it if you're Fury?
So say wilder wins tf they gonna fight again?
Plot twist: they were in a simulation plot twist number two: they were frozen on the loading screen
They have both banged each other but the only difference is Fury always has the final bang!
fury a rare breed
Why do they say fury is 6'9" and wilder is 6'6" if they are exactly the same height???
Furry already won the mental wilder don’t want to hear him talk and he barely wanted to take off the glasses he don’t want to see him either
Aye Wilder better be careful, how much those headphones weigh???
Plot twist: those headphones are playing Can't Take My Eyes Off You by Frankie Valli
Shades and head phones on he's scared,  wheres his big mouth now lol
Fury is still standing there To this DAY!
“tOo TaHm”
Wilder is about to lose then make up a bunch of excuses then retire
Fury loves these little mind games, it's like when he stayed in the sauna longer then Klitcshko 😆
Legends say that they are gonna have a staring contest instead of a boxing fight..
Over the last couple years Fury is after looking into Wilders eyes more often than the wife’s
Regardless of what some may think about Wilder as far as excuses and etc... The man has been wanting to fight again. If he has some doubt in himself or not, it takes an extreme amount of power and will to step back in and fight someone. Especially if you lost to them before. So much respect. Maybe he will lose again or maybe not but for what really matters, he's a winner in my eyes as a man first. And to be fair, he does have reason to believe Tyson Fury cheated based on previous events.
It’s already 2-0 to fury ffs
Let the free streaming begin
This was a repeat of the klitschko sauna situation. Wilders already lost
Wilder listening to "I'll beat yo ass-by Tyron Woodley"! Explains why he never took off the headphones... sweet melody!
Two times.  https://youtu.be/vfnSSbRucMU
Liiiiiiiiiiiiike🌷
Good to see Shane nicely "buzzed"
اللهم صل وسلم على نبينا وحبيبنا محمد💞 وعلى آله وصحبه أجمعين ❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹
Well that was disappointing
AND YOU CAN TELL EVERYBODYYY! IM THE MAN, IM THE MAN, IM THE MAAANNN!!!
Wilder getting his arsed kicked again, to this day
Wilder looks like the kid with tism at the concert with headphones on
Why didn’t someone separate them toward the cameras? Every face off would be this long if that person doesn’t intervene
Fury was in the sauna with Vlad again.
Let’s see if Tyson use legit gloves this time
Wilder was a beast but u can just tell by his eyes that fury took his manhood!!!🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Guy wearing the leggings is going to sleep.
This went on for so long I could draw it.
Was that the longest face-off ever?
Got to respect Wilder . Took a beating in the last fight and he is hell bent on getting his rematch . He definitely thinks he can win
Wilder K O s Fury in the 3rd
fury gonna beat him for the third time
Plot Twist: They genuinely like each other.
whos the fat guy with a beard calling them all pussies?
Why does fury always look out of shape lol
No one cares boxing is a joke of a sport
Who was sayin: too tie, too tie, too tie ??!!
Tyson beat was Wilder already so we can see the real fight with AJ
Lmfao
Theres no music while big man is comming for your head in that ring.
What happen with thé Joshua fight ?
Fury gona bladder him. Windmil shat his kex, then his trainer shat his kex then his whole team shat their kex lol
Two times sounds like broken down record
Worst press conference I’ve ever seen lmfao what was that
Wilder looking like the apple jacks cinnamon stick.
That was 6 and a half minutes too long
They're still facing off...TO DIS DAY!
Tyson wasn't looking away ever lol, he probably had that sauna story with Klitchklo in his head
Just get a room you pair
Ben Askren 5:33 ?
Wilder's listening to the soundtrack of his new Disney Documentary: The Bronze Bambi
TILL THIS DAY…… 🤡
Watch out them headphones could wear your legs out pal
Fury’s going to fck wilder up AGAIN FACT😂😂😂😂 uk 🇬🇧 all the way 😏
Surprised 1 of them didn’t burst out laughing
I have a feeling wilder will sleep fury this time. i hope im wrong
How about Logan or Jake boxes one of these guys.
I got uncomfortable after the first 3 minutes
Wilder gone kill em
It must have gotten awkward for everyone at some point
my eyes didn't leave the screen either
Fury said it best, Wilder a one trick pony. You can’t teach fundamentals at this stage
ZZZZzzzzz
After all that long stare down, he comes out with Sun glasses, headphones, a sweater around his butt cheeks and breaks eye contact then walks away first.....Wilder already prepared to lose😄
Another mental win for fury
He dead this time
Bloody hell Wilder has his sweater wrapped around his waist, the weight of that could've snapped both his legs
Wtf..... Looong Awkward faceoff...
Fury gunna ko wilder again
Not fair, his headphones were too heavy.
Wilder looks scary
Wilder: while they do a press conference we sleep, and they work!
How come wilder grew 2 inches
The guy yelling 2 time. Yes, he has lost 2 Times. 🤣
Fury gunna ko wilder again
Uh oh!
Not even a little excited to watch this shitshow
Beyoncé “ the bronze dosser “ wilder
not interested
Fury has won every press conference, every fight and just won the stare down.... wilders in trouble again 😂 let’s hope they don’t have a lay a drive way competition wilder will be even more fucked
Gypsy ducker
This was an absolute fuckin joke of a presser, maybe the worst I've ever seen. Absolutely embarrassing, unprofessional, childish and pathetic from Wilder acting like a huffy 10 year old.
Why???? ... wants beating for a third time????  ,,,, Fucking deluded Wilder lol ... guys a fraud!!!!!
Deontay “Disco Stu” Wilder
if only it was Aj VS Fury
Glove gate part 2 n trilogy
I didn't even know the press conference was today
Tyson looks terrified
Wilder fatigued walking up on that stage
Gotcha headphones 🏃‍♀️
nice headphones and shades YA DOSSER
Why are they staring at each other so long? They’re going to make out
The boxing match nobody wanted or needed.
OMG I didn't know this was actually gon happen! I'd pay $100 ppv! Let this happen lord! 🤞🤞  won't be easy and Fury has a slight advantage for being a wiser boxer but....   Wilder for the win!
Why is this happening again and again? That's when you know the heavyweight division is boring.
Tyson is in the best shape of his life Prove me wrong
Who else didn't know this was a thing until now?
Wilder gonna walk naked into the ring this time. That way no outfit or clothes drains him.
Wilder lost coz his headphones were too heavy
he had to wear headphones so the big bad words didn't get him lol
Why is Tyson fighting this bum again?
Champs get off stage last, Un winnable
Man....I how Wilder doesn't luck up and win this one, Fury already beat him twice.
I wish the Us could get a real champ who didn’t disgrace us with all those BS excuses.
Fun fact wilder only walked away because his trainer tapped him
Tyson never lose a challenge
Fury knows he cheated in that 2nd fight with tampered gloves and knows not to get too close to wilder this time because he’ll smack him right away for that.
How many times Wilder lost? 2 TIMES ! 😂
Wilder vs Fury 2 : The fight we all wanted to see Wilder vs Fury 3: The fight nobody wanted to see
As an AJ fan, I’m now convinced fury does the exact same thing. Wilder is damaged blud. Actor. Malik Scott is stupid as hell. Older has nervous energy, as soon as he gets hit it’s over.
dude your wearing headphones the whole time?? lol what a joke
This fight is why people prefer UFC this fight makes no damn sense it should be Tyson vs Josuhua. Also the unprofessional set up no body standing between them nobody leading or directing boxing is a shit show
BUM SQUAD
MMA does this shit so much better 😂
This is not the fight the world wants to see. Fury looks like he's not ready for this fight.
July 10: Dustin Poirier vs Conor McGregor 3 July 24: Tyson Fury vs Deontay Wilder 3 *July, 2021 is gonna be a great month for Combat sport fans*
Wilder gon come out naked without a costume full butt for 100% performance
Fury looks ugly as 😂🤣
We got Conor vs poirir part 3  And now this  Cmon I want  new fights
2 time what? KO loser
Fury is like a Greek god and a super athlete rolled into one giant bag
Wilder is getting ready to lose again. New coach, same dumb fighter though.
I knew there was speculation of Fury vs Wilder 3 due to the legal implications stipulated in their contract, but I had no idea this was already booked... Why do I feel like this totally flew under the radar? I admit that I'm more of an MMA fan, but I do love watching Fury box so I'm excited for this, but I expect the same result, a dominant win by Fury.
Was painful to watch lol
Wilder will win this time
Why in fucks name is this fight happening again sooo stupid
EVERYBODY GOT A PLAN UNTIL THEY WEAR A 40 POUND COSTUME FOR THE RING...
Worst presser ever.
Legend has it they still looking at eachother.. TILL THIS DAY!!
Wilder has this one ☝️
Hopefully Wilder conditions himself for the walkout this time
6minute star off
Wait what, they are fighting again? Why?
BIG FIGHT🥊🔥🏆
This has got to be a Guinness World Record for the longest boxing Face Off 😅
Wilder lost as usual 😂
Wilder be like: lost the staredown because my music was too loud
Fury wins for the third time
0:43 lmao he removed his glasses like he bout to kiss fury 🤣😭💀💀
Triple C would fold both of them inside 1
Sat there quietly and walked off in the staredown. Fury broke him mentally not screaming bombsquad anymore huh?
Tyson Fury never looked like fighting shape, but he looks look REALLY out of shape now.
he beat him twice whats the point of this
I didn't even know this was happening
Call me crazy but I got this feeling that wilder is gonna win, like he’s gonna want this win more then fury in a way
Fury by bellyuppercut
wilder is fooked
Wilder is scared. He is gonna get gypsy smacked so hard
Can't wait for this fight I think Tyson finishes Wilder again
No one wants to see this fight again except Wilder’s fans..
Forgot this was on
Revenge szn for wilder

Clowns
