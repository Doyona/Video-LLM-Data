Ok but who remembers these videos?!?! Do you remember what video you found my channel??
8:21 😂😂😂😂
I grew up watching all these videos and my god it's still epic for me
I just randomly found this video again and CANNOT stop laughing. I'm 19 now, turning 20 soon and have been watching you since the start of your career, and it's so funny watching back now because you ATE UP every phase, and it's nice to think we have all grown up watching you in the same phases like the the 2016 era, covid etc.
So much fun!

Alisha scoffing at "slays" and now everyone including me and herself in that age group are saying it again lmao what a difference a few makes always 😂 I'm dying at this video
10:00 TELL ME THATS NOT DEMI LOVATO
I love how her friends are comforting her while she watched her old cringey videos
SLAY💅🏽
Super late to the game but this was hilarious!! Please do more!  Love you all
Jesus loves you and died for your sins so that you can be made pure!(Only if you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior of course!) The End is coming soon; Jesus is coming back! I’ve had dreams about it! Be prepared and share the Good News!❤️✝️❤️ Much love!💕💕

Honestly I’d do the pumpkin spice for $4500 😗
6:56 “did u tape leaves to a paper?”  i love taryne
Wait… did we ever get the Getty picture video? 🤣🤣
if you're under 21 like me, or just dint care about wine skip to 2:16
Honestly, I bet the video where your parents “shouldered in” was probably so fun to make lol
who else misses OMG akward…
Okey but schoolalisha was my comfort
OMG YOU FOUR SHOULD RECREATE THIS IT WILL BE HILARIOUS HAHAHAHAHA
i love how she just makes things so aesthetic
I’m Dyinggg
Alishaa will always be part of my childhood!😭❤️

that was so funny
i was so bored one day i decided to look at my fav schoolisha or old alisha marie videos only to find it gone i really miss them you shouldnt find it cringey it was not cringey at all
This was my childhood I really wanna rewatch those they made me so happy :( Please make them public again it makes me feel like I’m growing up and it’s kind of sad nostalgia.
Def remember these 😭
i love watching this video, it really puts me in a good mood
I wasn't part of the schoolisha era, she was a quarantine find of mine. This is so surreal to me
She was literally the first YouTube right addicted to, the nostalgia 😭😭😭
Can. Please get a part 2 on this?
Why did you delete the old vids😭😭😭
This takes me back thoooooo😂😂
Alisha is the only youtuber that makes me crack up
onmg SQUISHY GRIPSSS! this is so nostalgic for me
Roommate wars are gone 😭noooo
Alisha at the start had the best outfit the Nike and necklace was so pretty
MOREEE of this
The Dance Showdown has me screaming 😭😂😭 not the end pose being a piggy backkkkkkkkkkk😭😭😭😭
okay but you realize that guy in the dance picture is david moore right? he’s my favorite hip hop dancer and has taught me and hung out with me at dance competitions many times over the years?!?!
i mean if I could make more than my parents' combined annual salary for making a YouTube video i would too 💅
Editing is amazing.
I'm so upset she made all of these OGs private
Literally have the same taste in wine, though I have gotten into dryer wines as I’ve gotten into my late 20s
Alisha- smells wine- I can definitely smell the notes  Ashley- come down  Lmao i live for them
I'M LITERALLY CRYINGGG
Omfgggg how am I just now watching this 🤣🤣🤣🤣 luv you 💛

Omg I miss back to school Alisha 😭 please make those videos public, it was my childhood
Why you deleted them?? They were awesome.. it reminds me of my childhood seriously
PLEASE WHERE IS THE DRUNK REACTING TO THE GETTY IMAGES PLEASEEEE
I loved the schoolisha series but I can’t find any videos anymore😢
I miss the schoolisha vibes. Too bad they are all private/deleted.
This old videos is actually my fav videos  ngl
i legit grew up with you, i love how real you are now and how you don’t try to hide who you really are. so much love
it's the way i actually remember when those videos came out-
omg i love when TK says “shut the FORK up!” ITS SO FUNNY
She needs to unprivate these. They’re pretty good and funny videos.
I feel like Alisha should just keep those old videos up because she’s making a shit ton of money from them. Sure they’re embarrassing but also, 17 MILLION FREAKING VIEWS! Also I enjoyed most of her old videos and now they’re all gone. :(
“ohhhhh that cactus is dead” we love tarynne
The school intro is iconic
The diner intro  was truly a moment in time and history
I don’t that you are reading this but thankyou so much making our childhood great! Been here since Macbaby era! Thankyou so much queen! You have aged so gracefully❤️
Currently sobbing that my childhood has been privated :(
Can you please do a fashion video
Your school videos were my comfort videos :( gonna miss that era but can't wait for your new videos
OKAY THE DANCE ONE GOT ME ROLLINN HAHAHAHA
It’s the fact that I LIVED for these videos when I was 10 😂😂 schoolisha is so iconic
roomies
schoolalisha vids were my purpose in 2015
Honey no

“I can smell the notes” 🤣😂 I come from a wine family ALISHA
naurrrr I remember these videos tooooooooo well

TK looks soo beautiful in this vid
Girl you should def do the drunk Getty images vid!!!
OMG I'VE NEVER KNEW YOU WERE ON A DANCE SHOW
*me realizing that the way I’ve started saying “literally” recently is from watching so many Alisha vids* 😄❤️💕
😂😂😂 Loved this
HOW HAVE I NEVER SEEN THAT DANCE VIDEO 😭
Alisha deleted some of her videos
Alisha regretting her life decisions for 13 minutes straight
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW PRETTY ASHLEY IS IN THIS
Awkward Situations walked so TaryneItUp could run
am i the only one who watched all these videos before they were privated and then wondered a few yrs later why are they not on her channel ? did she delete them ? now all my questions are answered😂 . alishas old videos were a VIBE
Great
I loved this video era!!
Oh I remember every video you made back then,SCHOOLISHA will always have a special place in my heart,you were my childhood
dude my CHILDHOOD
Here I was thinking Remi was the only one with a dance background 😂
Who else loved watching alishas old vids?!
Ahh the era of saturated videos!! 😂😂
Bruh might just resub xD this was hilarious
crazy how i met you at an iplayamerica when these videos were new
Hey alisha! I was wondering why you privated you Schoolisha vids? I think it would be a good idea to unpruvate your Schoolisha videos because I feel it would be better for kids to watch those instead of the inappropriate content from other creators. I don't know why you privated the videos, but if you're not comfortable letting them be on the internet, than that's totally fine! I just love your videos and want other kids to experience them rather than watching people who don't show a good example. Lots of love! 💛
The dance one is sending me😭😭😭
lol i really want to see the awkward situations again but as like an adult lmaoo
i remember every single one of these omg you were my childhood
"Oh that cactus is dead" 🤣🤣🤣
Wait- guys- did anyone else hear a guys laugh fin the beginning of the video... um......... Alisha we need to talk!
These vids were/are my childhood
SCHOOLISHA ERA WAS PERFECTION
wait alisha please unprivate all of your old vids! they are my comfort videos and i want to watch them :(((
Ok but that outfit tho
It went from... Coffee to wine Blonde hair to brown hair Bright colours to pastels Schoolisha to reactions to old videos 2014 to 2021 And from watching your old videos for the first time to trying to find channels uploading your old videos so I can watch them when I’m bored
ITS SO WEIRD HEARING TARYN"S VOICE AFTER HEARING IT IN YOUR OLD VIDEOS
OMG, I wanna watch all ur old videos😉
I was looking back at them! Why did u deleted them I actually like going back and watch it
STILL laughing over taryne’s reactions to the dance video! You need to do another one of these videos!! Love it!
That's how I pick wine...."Ohhhhh that is pretty!"
she deleted some of her old vids its really kinda sad
I’m leaving tonColorado today and shaved last night so she’s not wrong about shaving before you travel out, haha.
I come back weekly to watch the dance competition clip. 💀😂💀😂
Oh no not the dance
god i remember all of these from back in middle school... absolute ICON
The actually rest preclinically expand because saxophone topically pack pro a wiry intestine. brief, simple tachometer
"rommies"
3:31 " used to be in a band"  me: crying in a cool way
OMG ALISHA TELL TK I COULDNT EVEN RECOGNIZE HER, SHES LOST A TON OF WEIGGT AND LOOOKS GORGGGG
Schoolisha was a mood💖💖
Roomies

How nostalgic ☺️
i just realized that you deleted all your school lisha videos, all your old videos, basically everything that was old you. EVEN ROOMATE WARS. my life will never be the same.
She said Kim possible  I I couldn’t hahahah
THE DANCE VIDEOS 😳😅 I could nEver
Wow i didnt know that she became an alcoholic after that era in my preteens
Old Alisha videos were literally my Childhood
The fact that I remember every single video in this video is insane. And she even put videos from the iconic pink room
The dance....i can't😂
I honestly don’t remember when I started following you but I recognized every video and about died watching them again 😂 absolutely love the commitment
Why you making TK stand??!
UNPRIVATE THEM PLS I LOVE THOSE VIDEOS
tbh u should unprivate them they were my CHILDHOOD
Your old videos made me so happy so I’m kinda sad you deleted them cries
I’m use to the white coffin nails and coffee she always had on her
roomies
I remember 11 year old me loving these.....
Literally no one: Taryne: That cactus is dead 😕
PLEASE REACT TO GETTY IMAGES
omg i went to watch them right now so i could feel nostalgic n theyre all gone... 😕😕 i didnt find them cringe tbh
We NEED a part II
I remember the first video Alisha video I watched was Back to School Haul 2014, in like June, I was so excited because I was starting 8th grade in a few months, good times :')
Schoolisha.. ah miss it but this content is just as good!!!!!!
I’m soo glad that I was able to binge watch her old videos before she made them private
not my 7y/o self watching these back then  plot twist : I watched/loved them back then lol
I cant i loved those vids i thought they were the best im so sad u took them down
roomies
while watching this i keep remembering the first times i watched all of these videos.... good times 😂
I LOVED THE PUMPKIN VIDEO
y’all we can’t lie we weren’t eating this shit up in 2017😭😭
Am I the only one that is so sad she deleted her videos!! Like I miss it! Summer isn’t summer without 2016 alisha
I MISS THE SCHOOLISHA AND ROOMATE WARS SO MUCH OMDS
I frickin loved your weird food combo video I would watch it like 5 times I don’t know why ly. 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
when alisha says these videos are cringy....  that’s the time we all subscribed to her channel
WAIT WHYD YU PRIVATE THEM OML😭😭😭
I REMEMBER THESEEEE AGGGG😂👏🏻😭 I LOVE THEM
Tan eik fai l am 20 years malaysia loph😍😍😀😃
it’s so much more funny because I grew up with these videos 😭😭
Ok wait, second comment on this video, from personal experience of filming cringey old videos pretending I was a YouTuber, when you put on the fake cheery persona that was used a couple years ago in YouTube, your voice becomes higher pitched because it makes you sound happier
Honestly though, to some extent I feel like I’ve kind of aged with this channel. I watched her old cringed videos when I was little, but now enjoy her current channel and PB
I was wondering if you could react to kpop mvs
I literally learn English from her videos ..  still bad at it but she makes me improve it a lot  Thank you alisha 💕😗
I remember watching the pumpkin spice video when I was your target demographic, and I even was like, uhhh... this is weird.
can't even describe how sad I am that all of it is gone.
I remember all of these videos
You saw Smokey Glow’s video hey? Hey, you had to start somewhere!!! Love you long time xx
I used to watch your yt channel alot I would be entertained 4 years ago now look at you you've changed Ashley changed more than you like- I miss the old y'all plus I didn't think you were cringe when I was little. Love you❤
im sorry but those videos were and still are elite
I laughed way too hard!!! Also, why have I watched 99% of these?
“Oh that cactus is dead” 😂
Ily

This was funny 😂😂
Why is there no videos?

My biggest flex is that i remember all this videos 💕💕💕
I resubbed just in time to see Alisha react to the videos I used to watch (:(
I KNOW ALL OF THESE EXCEPT THE DANCE SHOW THING OMGGGGGG
Hahaha legit cracking up at this... just what we all needed
I actually miss alisha Marie back to school video. I subscribed you that time and still now I am a subscriber so those videos is a different emotion to me ❤️
GOD I MISS WATCHING UR OLD SCHOOL VIDEOS THEY ALWAYS MADE MY DAYYY
The fact that I have been subscribe since these old videos
Omg I laughed so hard😂
WHY TF DID SHE PRIVATE THE FIRST ONEEEE
Who else has been here for one those videos used to pop up as her most recent
These were the best videos
Omfg when Alisha shrank down below the table when watching her dance tho... my year is made lol
My anxiety when she was holding the wine bottle
I miss roommate wars and OMG Awkward!!!❤️
For everyone going through something just know that God doesn’t make mistakes, you just have to let him take control. He has a purpose for  you and he may still be working through you 🤎 Don’t forget that you’re loved sm and Jesus is coming soon
I still like them vids and I still watch them
pls do the drunk reacting
(Video idea) Queen can u pls make a video of waking up at 5 am for a week.
Ik it’s not just me who saw alishas face when tk  said something about the costume at 7:50 😬
Schoolisha era was the best era of alisha, i remember i used to watch it before every new semester and it used to give me motivation for school❤😭i just realised how fast we all are growing
ooooOOOOooOOOO verrrryyyy niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
when intro to yt video were like 2-3 minutes long
Who else LIVES FOR TARYNE!
Schoolisha is the reason I subscribed no joke🖐
Alisha!! I cant believe you put all of the old videos on private. That is so sad. I cant even tell you how sad that is, you are literally covering the entire beginning of your career. I used to rewatch these videos ALL DAY!! I know they are probably “embarrassing” but they were so good!!! That’s so sad i can’t even believe it.
No why did you private them 😫
IM CRYINGGGG
Haha loved this!💖 Almost as cringe as the one I just uploaded xx
I don't think I was following you back then but I miss the old youtube so bad.. Such a fun video to watch :)
Wish I could like twice 👍
The dance show...I possibly can't🤦
i remember when i was little the halloween one with the creepy clown scared me so bad
Who wants SCHOOLISHA again? Me.
I feel old watching these
At this i can't be the only that thinks saying fork instead of fuck is weird. I get it  is an inside joke but it would be justifiable if they were 15 since they are swearing and  bleeping them.
When her doorbell rang I thought it was mine cause I have the same one. 1:42
Such a wonderful video :-)
omg i just found your pretty basic collection with tarte!!!!!!
I GREW UP WITH THESE
Am I the only one sad when we searched for her old videos. Like the schoolisha era or any other older videos😢😢😢
Omg we should have another revamped schoolisha but like actual high schooler
Why does Ashley look like a model here?! 😍
Alisha changed to much I loved her old videos the one she makes now are okay but I loved her old videos
*me liking her old videos*  : 👁👄👁
LAWD PLEASE put up some new videos thank you
Hey Lida can you do a video telling more about money on YouTube or other platforms ; like what is the highest you’ve made and the lowest. Which video had more effort on filming and editing; which one you thought it won’t do but it got more views. I’d like to watch those types of videos as a long time fans of yours.  I have been here for 11 years I think. Basically I am grown with you in every stage of my life. From my childhood till now a 22 years old woman. I have seen you evolving and getting bigger and bigger professionally and I am so proud of you. Thank you for making us part of your life ( and daily sometimes with the vlogs )  and for making us happy. I really appreciate everything you’ve done for your fans; from your lowest points to your highest, we have always been with you.  Keep being you and real. Lots of love 💕
Alishaaaaaa I am literally 13 years old
I'm a new follower! Love your videos! They're so honest and helpful! I'm a new youtuber!
hey guys i made a youtube channel because alisha inspired me hope it entertains you throughout this hard time xx
i have been watching alisha for 4 years I'm on my mums acc btw but the face change at the end got me HAHAHAH
I am so grateful I grew up with this and not cocomelon
I mean her videos are still cringy . . .
I remember all of them too!
THIS MADE ME LAUGH SO FREAKIN MUCH
Back in the day I was vibin with schoolisha! OK SO DONT COME FOR SCHOOLISHA CAUSE IT WAS A FORKING VIBE OKAY!!!
Noooooo she literally privated everything that was over 2 years old 😭😭
The number of dislikes, the number of people that want her old videos back. Whenever I saw them they would bring a smile to my face.
She deleted all of her old vids😭
Oh.....noh
Tk bending down and not sitting for the first half bothered me so much 😭😂😬
this video: exists   wine sponsor: not necessary   you don’t need a customized bottle of wine but ok
Not me genuinely in tears over the dancing 🤣
ALISHA I AM WAITING FOR YOU TO RECREATE VIRAL TIKTOK MEALS LIKE FETA PASTA AND TACO WRAPS!! 💕💕
NOOOO WHY IS IT PRIVATEEEE
i forgot about you...
I miss her old vids😭🥺
I miss those videos
OMG IVE NEVER KNOWN THIS ALISHA!! Y’all laughing at the dance video had me CACKLING
Omg but she deleted all of them 😥
OMFG Ashley's laugh bro... Actually ALL of their laughs.. I fking CAN'T! 😂😂😂😂 wowww. Bahahaha
What is wrong with u Alisha?!  Making your old videos private? We know your embarrassed about them, but those videos made your channel and helped you gain subscribers. And what about schoolisha? If done students want to go back to your school hacks, just to find that you removed them. And some fun videos some people still want to watch like roommate wars. I am highly upset with this and don't know what what to say. It is so sad and I don't know what you are thinking that you would do that. It is very sad. 😡😑😕😢😒😫
Tk's "sh dont tell them" gave me asmr hahahaha
Can you do a part 2 of this pls
omg she really did private all of them i’m so sad 😞
Why did you private themm I miss those videos so much!!!
im actually laughing so hard HAHAHA

The fact that I remember when each of these came out is crazy
sometimes second hand embarrassment is worse than experiencing your own embarrassment. anyway, go off macbaby11 😭😭💀
Ngl the schoolisha shaped me in 7th grade 0_0
WHY ARE ALL THE OLD VIDEOS PRIVATES NOOOOOO
THE DINER INTRO WAS ELITE
THE DINER INTRO WAS ELITE
I feel sad for the fans who loved these videos, now that the videos are gone and the fans feel stupid for ever liking them 😕 - not just this channel but with other YouTubers too.
I pick my wine by how pretty the bottle is too 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
You should recreate them :3
Taylor is the funniest. Like the you gest sibling who annoys the shit out of you by asking legit questions hahahhaha and they are also on point but you know the truth is hurting 🤪🤣
Video idea; copy a celebs instagram story for a day!!
My favourite videos on the internet are with these four girls

This video should have been titled “the shit I made Ashley do to get views”
I feel like a lot of youtubers are ashamed of their past. It was hard work and good marketing, even if it was cringey, there’s nothing to be ashamed of. I went back to rewatch some old videos and I was so surprised to see so all of them privated☹️

please do a part two. this was too funny
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15

John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
I remember this video and I miss them
9 year old me search bar: Alisha Marie back to school!!!
Pretty messed up for you to call your videos cringe. How is everyone at that level supposed to feel knowing their videos are cringe. Nothing wrong with using the word cringe, quit using it in ways like this. There’s nothing cringe about being new and awkward at something.
THE AMOUNT OF TIMES IVE WATCHED THE SCHOOL NOW VS THEN VIDEO IS INCREDIBLE
I literally grew up on these videos wtf. Like these and MyLifeAsEva, ChloeCouture, etc. etc.
Who else remembers each one of these videos!!!

not me dying of laughter 😂 but also you know your an og when you’ve watched mostly every single one as a kid 😂
TK where’d u get ur jacket
I honestly love your old vids
I literally died and came back to life after watching this
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. (John 3:16-18)  Hey you reading this, Jesus loves you. Yes you. He loves you with all your faults and all your brokenness. He wants a relationship with you. He wants to heal you and redeem you. He wants to save you. He not only loves you, but died for you and took your punishment and mine upon himself. He bore our sin and shame. A death he didn’t deserve but we did. If you have not given your life to him and accepted him into your heart and repent/turn away from your sins, I sincerely hope you make the decision to do so soon. He is the only one that can fill that void in your heart. That missing piece. “Come close to God, and God will come close to you.” (James 4:8) God bless. ♥️
HAHAHHAHAHA this is so funny, alisha i love u

Omggg I remember them allll😂😂😂
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Alisha u should recreate ur most viewed schoolisha video
“did anyone actually do the DIYS”  yes. yes we did.
When I was younger I watched your videos like it was a religion
roomies! this was a great video idea to combine with the wine sponsorship  haha
These videos feel like yesterday. I cant believe i didnt think anything of them when j watched them lmaooo i found them normal.
How schoolisha was in 2017???? I remember it like it was yesterday! So crazy omg. I remember the old houses videos too

Does anyone know where she got this sweatshirt?🥺
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true .  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.

11:40 my sleep paralysis demons at three in the morning:
2:03:umm I'm 13👉👈
I am sad that you have privated your older videos. I still watch them when I am having a bad day.  Takes me back to a time when YouTube was simple and a happy place.
MORE OF THISSSSS!!!!
I LOVE THIS OMG 😂
lol did anyone see Alishas story and think it was going to be a truth or drink
all I can say...BAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH
why did she delete all these ?
"there's something else we need to get cuz I don't think ill be able to make it through without it." *expects lids to get coffee* *lida gets wine* OH YA WE'VE GROWN
Ok but her outfits are bomb af I'm in love  with her fit
I’m sorta sad she privated them :(
PLS MAKE AN AMOUNG US VIDEO WITH IR ROOMMATES
I don't hate you, Alisha. I will NEVER hate you. I will NEVER not like you. It's just that your contents are boring now. Yeah, I know it's just me but because of it, you'll now lose a former avid fan. I used to watch every single video you upload. But now, because of the kind of content you're uploading, I kinda feeling like you're just doing what you're doing because of sponsorships money. Yeah, I know you're feeling free now and you're just pretending before, but I kinda like the old alisha content. It feels like you're making videos to upload not uploading because you made a video.   I'm sad to leave you. You've been a nice companion everytime I'm alone and bored. But I think it's a goodbye for now. It's been a nice 5 years being your viewer.
I’m not crying because all of her old videos are private😭😭😭
I’m sorry but why was she so stiff OMG
yes please do drunk reaction to Getty pictures that'd be so funny
Haha we all do cringe things and she's got her embarrassing moments on the internet. Sure they'll be stuff in even this year she will be embarrassed of in the future 🤣

The fact that i cant stand watching ur vídeos anymore is so unfortunate. Why do u have sponsors in every single one? Even on the vlogs?! I followed u for so long, since the vídeos u were reacting to.  and loved the transition u made, I used to love the new content, but I cant with these totally unrelated sponsors on the videos, even if you try to make it natural, it does not fit in, its annoying and disturbs the vídeo.
Yesssssss

I was thinking about you today Alisha! I started following you when you did  2020 vlogmas and was ready and there to watch your videos when it uploaded. I got so use to watching you everyday that when you stopped posting in January I missed you and your videos and seeing you with your friends and sister. Hope you had an enjoyable break though from uploading on YouTube. Hope we get to see more of you again 😅

I am actually so proud that I've watched all of those videos (except the McBabay part) and multiple times might I add 😂😂 I actually used to love those videos of yours bc they were a way for me to escape from my crappy life back then when I was in school and now that I've grown, I love your growth up content 😂😍😍 love ya Alisha 💗💗💓💓 so glad that I grew up watching 😍😍

I am so happy those videos were there to make me smile for when i was younger. that being said, those videos was always on my recommend and it sucks because you have done a great job rebranding ur channel  & it makes ppl assume ur still making school/pumpkin videos lol. i love this new fresh start as it opens up new beginnings.  love you!!
