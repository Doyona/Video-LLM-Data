The fact that you can see the blast and the satalite got a picture of it 😭
Tonga Volcano Missile Attack Jan 15 2022   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw5blvCz3O4
It shows how big the eruption is of a space Satilight can capture the event
That is not a volcanic eruption that is a weapon
🙏🏽👸🏽💞🇹🇴🏝🌊💎
It just blew AGAIN😨😱
Climate change is getting out of control.
That blast wave was impressive!
Things are getting biblical.
Look at the shockwave coming off that thing.  Wow.
Basically me after eating Taco Bell’s wings
Ayo this was yesterday Rip people
That's Crazy :D
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~ 🎈
Earth farts are deadly.
សហហ្ន
Fun Fact it was set off by the world government don’t be fooled
U steal fossil fuel from the ground blow smoke in the air and u don’t think that one day the volcanos under water won’t blow
What's man gonna do when he loses all control he thinks he can buy - not a question at all.
How fake is this shit
Dammit 2022
I live in fiji and the shock wave reached us here the sound was so loud and the Windows were rattling and I was at a supermarket
Hmmm
The celestial ?
People saying its the end of the world and I agree with them they are 100% right that Tiamut is coming like the Celestial from Marvel
The eternals ?
This is a stupid test to see if you’re stupid stupid
Nuclear weapons test
Repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved." Romans 10:9
Told the wife I didn't do it....she's still not sure.
Holy shit, thats massive
#412 🌋
How are we all not dead from this?
https://youtu.be/S8edmFh2gpQ
I heard the atmospheric pressure in Japan was dropped by this shockwaves!  No wonder I got headaches!
I'm not buying it. This looks more like bomb detonated before its target. Wake up.
New Zealand, tutukaka marina this morning 20+ boats damaged atleast 2 sunk
Incredible!
😂😂
It was heard about 1300 km away the eruption was. That's the equivalent of an eruption in Los Angeles and hearing it in Pueblo, Colorado! Damn.
The volcano isn’t just near Tonga.  The volcanic island that formed around 2015 is a new part of the country.  And clearly visible from the shores facing it.  Real close.
Fuckin bullshit. There is no globe. Fuck the Masons.
Enhanced for effect huh

I legit dreamt of an explosion just like this overnight... 😳
Wow check out that carbon footprint.
I'm Tongan. Was kinda freaked out to hear about this, but it looks like the impact wasn't as devastating as it could have been. All my family who still live there have been posting about it on social media, and I haven't heard about any deaths. Thank goodness 🙏
They should use this music for BF2042 after they completely remake the game lol
Impressive!
That shock wave was like Norbits wife jumping into the ocean
Its going to be a long winter
Too bad Bloomberg is such a biased piece of Crap 💩 Organization
Looks like an atomic bomb! Wow 😮
Is this a time elapsed photo?
Just here for the stupid flat earth comments. 🍿
That ain't a volcano
Looks like a nuke! Who’s testing in the area?
How do they know it was a volcano? Could have been a H bomb
Flat Earthers on suicide watch rn
Looks a bullet when straight threw it smh prayers for the ppl near by may God b with you
We are living in the Last Days. REPENT!
Came for the comments. They did not disappoint.
Almost like a pimple burst
Imagine that twilight zone... just capturing a view
Which satellite is supposedly taking these photos! This would clearly be taken from outside low earth orbit, what do we have out there capable of taking these pics…?🤔
Anyone living on a coastline will feel the wrath of tsunamis - sooner or later ?  No defense except Luck ?🤔
Look like a meteor just hit earth..
lol now do yellowstone
Good thing there is no intelligent life on this planet for it to wipe out.
Just another doctored image to perpetuate the globe myth.
People actually think that’s real footage, lol.  Products of a 15,000 hour indoctrination course called the public fool system
God I hope it’s destroys the earth
Thanks DRUMPF
Seen from "space"  Hollywood and Disney addicts: wOaHhh!
i knew 2022 was being too quiet
That's amazing. But not as amazing as tic tok.
I predicted something like this around January 18th. Check it out at 3:08 in my January 2022 predictions.. https://youtu.be/JUR2ocnJPNw
Next week it will be aliens. Anything to get the attention off of them.
Loook At Those Ripples---  ReMinds me Of--- Oh wait--- Never mind
If that ain’t the fakest shit I’ve ever watch idk what is great CGI btw
Another fake picture of earth. Thanks nasa!
I was rowing in the area, https://youtu.be/TajZpvZUCK4?t=283
👆❤🙏❤☝🐦 !!!! TY. JOHN !!!!
That was actual footage of me taking a shit
Earth farts
Pretty cool
That’s a sign that Mother Nature is fed up with humans. The people of Tonga gonna need aid. Feel for you and wish you a good recovery. God bless you
Nice CGI
Seeing that through space. Makes me think how small we are yet God loves us more than we can imagine!
Just got a warning on my phone to stay off of beaches... it said 8:14.... I got the message at 8:30.... I feel safe
I blame Obama for this
I read about this at the end of one of my favorite books 😆
Prayers up for my Tongan people
Y'all still believe in the blue marble 🤣
Had it been Yellowstone...
What if it was really an asteroid strike
It’s like a pimple burst on earth’s face
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEKzFg42NJ0  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrD4ho1RSIs
CGI FAKERY! Why? Because that explosion covered 50 miles in less than 5 seconds. Also. With all the eruption that have taken place this year. This just happens to be the only one recorded from space. The government has stolen all of your common sense.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEKzFg42NJ0  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrD4ho1RSIs
Funny thing is flat earthers and space/NASA deniers will still say this is all just CGI or something.   Takes all kinds to make the (spherical)  world go 'round. 🤷🌍🌎🌏
Wow alot of co2 to the air.
WOAH!!! Mother Nature!!!! Incredible power. 🌍☄️⚡
That shockwave
Earth zit…
Shockwave was incredibly powerful and keep in mind it was a underwater volcano😳
Let's go Brandon#FJB
Is this Russia showing us who's boss?
very cool
The bible speaks of such things we are in the end times believe it or not its your eternity thats in jeopardy.
Yo mama goin for a swim
Sorry doesn't look real.
Damn Mother Nature you scurrry
Yikes, I hope Hawaii doesn't get a Tsunami.  I better go check now! 😳
My sons Micky mouse cartoons look more realistic than this vid
Wow that Shockwave at the end
Eruption my arse, you evidently think your audience is stupid...... That was some type of underwater ordinance; nuclear or other.
Fake
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine!  ~REM~
lol yall play too much...why is it in cgi (like always) but let them tell it they landed on the moon.
Wow!
Revelation 9:18 refers to volcanoes,  Also spoken of poetically in scriptural history. "The sun turned to darkness and the moon turned to blood" refers to eclipses too.  #extinction #level #event
Fakenews
Interesting this happend after they announced that planned on "harvesting" energy from volcanos to power bitcoin mining..
My condolences neighbors.  Be safe everyone!
Is Tonga near china? The north china sea?
celestial emergance....
There goes green peace campaign against gas 🤣
Holy shit
Manmade. (sarc)
I’d like to know how quick that shockwave was traveling.
That's great and all but can we get the ultimate form of covid-19, more people need to die quicker.
Looks more like an underwater explosion. Russia?
Were there people there or near it?
That is awesome footage 😃👍💯😊👍
Why don't we have a satellite video of the 2004 tsunami?
Suspicious Observers channel has more information on the event. 👍🤓
All the billions of dollars on space research and the earth looks like a 2006 presentation with 360p resolution
Can’t believe Bloomberg got this one right
What’s that black line. O it’s an animation.
Wow that is huge. I had no idea it was THAT big. That is like 1/10th or 1/12th the size of *Australia* !
Good thing they have all been locked up and poisoned 💉☠️  now they are safe from anything, just ask the government
Prove it or its just cgi.
The very earth 🌍 rejects Biden FJB!
I want to see videos of the space station being built in space, none to find not even a home video.Hm why did they not film that.
I see how much Don't Look Up is coming true is these incredibly STUPID FUCKING COMMENTS.
Let's go Brandon#FJB
if that happened on land in a major country prettys sure that country is getting f'd up
My science projects of space looked better than that thirty plus years ago in the fourth grade??? If you think that is real? My old cell phone from twenty years ago could take better video?  Lmfao I have not seen such poor stop and go video since the original king kong,,, or the original gumby cuts,,, and than you go and tell me that this super camera is mounted to a floating satellite?  Sorry folks,,, lol  that looks so dam poor... the creators of this video are basically begging you to wake up...lol and dear god of all gods or whomever or whatever you believe? They will not be able to help you if you fall for that?  Sorry,, if you think that is space? From a satellite view? If so? Just find a real picture of a satellite?  You cant...just computer composites,,, because all they really have always had was high altitude balloons... this is your wake up call,,, knock knock
This is what it looks like when you patch together flat images into a sphere.
Farting in the bathtub
imagine just chilling on a cruise ship and then the water blows up beneath you
Mother Nature: KAPOW! Shark: Lunchtime Fellas!
Must have been caused by global warming or climate change or a herd of angry bunnies…..
That was me dropping a dizzy after eating at Golden Corral
Look at the shockwave coming off that thing.  Wow.
I couldn’t help but wonder how the mushroom clouds of today’s nukes would compare to this 😳🤯 😬
Amazing that you can see the Shockwave wow stay safe folks
Pour
I like how you can see the dividing territory lines of Australia from space. Sweet CGI NASA
The volcano had covid
surfs up.  carbon emissions are up. the price of goods and services are up, but the beijing biden regime disgrace are too busy helping chinese spies and taliban terrorists and haitian streetgang refugees and criminal clinton crew cronies than to fly over the site and fix the polluted problem, like joe did for the mandela rescue.
It was said that the eruption was heard over 1300 km away in New Zealand 😳 in comparison, people in Africa heard the Kratakoa eruption over twice the distance in the 1880s. Though that was already a volcanic island above water when it exploded. I'd be interested in seeing which one was bigger, as this Tonga eruption was underwater.
Cmon I’m not trying to be one of those people but this looks fake. And this is coming from someone that plays kerbal space program and loves space
They don't even make their CGI look real anymore
There goes the neighborhood
I heard there was a tsunami but I haven't confirmed that with a reliable source yet.
O wow, thats cool.
The climate is affected by the ash in the atmosphere. We had so many last year it’s no wonder we are experiencing climate change.
Are there any aftermath effects to anything surrounding ??
Amazing
the shockwave though
😯 oh dear, the tonga variant
