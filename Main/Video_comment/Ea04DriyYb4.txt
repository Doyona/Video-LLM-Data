To Everyone Who Thinks This Is Staged, It Could Be, But I Think It's Real Because This Explosion Really Happened.
The filming style went from modeling to first person shooter.

Imagine your ears after listening to a explosion shockwave. You would not be hearing for some hours

LOL!!!! LAUGHED A LOT!
"allahu akbar" talk about timing LMAO

Her wedding was a blast
Dope
Opening scene of No Time To Die 😂
You can say they had a "Blast" at the wedding day...
I like how this guy said allah ackbar right when the explosion happened. Classic
She T H I C C
the camera man was like “IM OUT CYAAAAAAAAA”
Politicians, the biggest arse wipes of humanity, along with religion. Will have the angle Micheal ready for you waiting. My name is Philip. I will decide if you even have the common cause to pay the ferryman. Everyone else will never come back. You have your warning. Only later will you find your destiny.
The Cameraman was on creative mode that's why the Cameraman could move the camera smoothly like a movie
WOW. at least it was just the shockwave.. jeez.. thats horrifying to human ears
I wonder what the overpressure on that measured.
How in the world did the cameraman not even flinch but kept it steady all the way.
he starts walking like an npc in first person after the explosion
So was this lebanon where this bomb blast occurred was once a locked in island inbetween bombay western lines harbour areas from churchgate marine lines churni road grant road stations till mahalaxmi, something tells me that this place and its old vintage houses were once of bombay from 850 a.d. to 1560 a.d. So some bhundasya helpers keepers of the below spindle world might had given the lands to beirut lebanon when the whites populations went away to europe. So if one studies the old buildings of bombay proper of 1055 a.d. had the same bricks structure like the bricks of lebanon beirut. So if we drop a note to the below bhundasya devi queen of the crypts, and ask her followers to open wide the space in bombay mumbai between the rail lines then a big gorge would open the mid earth deep, and the seismic plates of lebanon beirut town would start to move. So some in lebanon ministers who has knowledge on how to communicate with the below world should mark the boundary lines and then move their lands to bombay again with the existing buildings and houses with people too from above machine assisted lifts. And then the seismic plates of bombay should not destroy the houses existing in bombay and its people and water from oceans came into the lands. So then the docks and ships of western line harbour would again come into being existence. And the lebanon people can make some adjustments with the locals and its governments.
I LAUGH SO HARD WHEN HER DRESS GOES FLYING AND HE JUST WALKS OFF
Check out the optical image stabilization on that camera.
👽
My Saliva drips inside her mouth.
Looks like everybody was getting married that Day.I pray for Lebanon
I always like how when you see photogenic of a large explosion from a distance you see this huge giant piece of destruction and then all the sound and shock hits the camera people about 5 seconds afterwards
Academy award I don't care.
That put a little bit more adventure into the future wedding cake.
Warning! Do not have ur headphones on Max at 0:14!!!
I once received a death threat from a Lebanese. Over a girl. Take this buddy, Cant run away from Karma
She’s So Beautiful In Her White Dress.
Such a beauty. Such a terrible disaster. My heart is with the ones, whom are suffering.
Earrape
Hi all here is my new song to support the Lebanese people after the shocking explosion.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM7Vi-UebOc   Thanks heaps for watching. From Aussie Chick
I'm glad she wasn't hurt
Laa Illa ha Illallah Muhammadarrosulullah....
Bride - The Church (Truly saved born again Christians who trust in Jesus's shed blood that cleanses us of all sins (Romans 3:25, 5:9 KJV, Ephesians 1:13, 2:4-10, 4:30 KJV) and stand in the Gospel of 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 KJV. Bridegroom - Jesus Christ Explosion - Day of Redemption (Rapture)(Notice that the Bride is not harmed and is snatched away by the Bridegroom from the blast. Those who are not lucky are those that will be left behind. Mostly those that call themselves Christians who were never saved and sealed with the Holy Spirit to begin with.  Time is short, have your souls cleansed with Jesus's shed blood and sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise.
Directed by Michael Bay...
She had a blast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8hDrSi3Of0&t=9s listen to it.. give your feedback. May god save all living creatures
Fuck man looks like a mission in CoD pray for lebanon
It’s heart throbbing.. It’s seems like Hollywood clip.. god bless people ..
The video starts so elegantly with the camera motion and the bride looks so beautiful then BOOM! It almost is like a movie except it’s real
And this is what happens when you think it would a good idea to get married before 2020 is over
so beautiful
haha explosion go boom
This year still has 4 more months to go.
revisited this. I'm surprised she was able to remain standing. This video really shows how explosions are a bad thing.
In August...  People: 2020 can’t get any worse    2020:  This isn’t even my final form
This is girl fault she is evilllll
damn she kinda bad
Nah...i don't believe that  ....its a clip from "Saving private Ryan"
Photobombed?!
A lucky strike. If there wasn't for the blast, she would have get married!
This photographer should have grabbed the woman....please what's wrong with humanity
J
This reminds me of when pain attacked the leaf village and obliterated everything with almighty push
Top explosion captured videos!!!!! https://youtu.be/Jj0YeZa1Gx4
Looking like a call of duty scene
It’s an omen and the wedding shouldn’t happen
Unprofessional camera work.... I would have kept the shot on the bride throughout.
I almost died by heart attack
Hope the bride and groom is fine my heart goes out for everyone in the country
thank god i wasn't near the explosion my house was 20% broken but it better than nothing
https://youtu.be/_Ngh1TM7OSM
This is nothing what the people in Beirut have ever heard. This was a full fledged nuclear attack minus the chemicals.  This poor woman endured horrible comments because she is Muslim. Damnnnnn all the people who said one word to this woman. She is beautiful whatever religion she might be.... The Lebanese are sick of you.
Fun Fact: She is a doctor and left her wedding to go help the injured victims. Beautiful inside out.
Lmao, all the teeths fallen out after an impact 😬
UNDERSTAND! This is a symbol of the bride of Christ as she is unharmed and they took her away quickly she was rescued by her groom, Jesus is the bridegroom.this video is telling people to wake up, he is coming for his bride then sudden destruction. The bride is taken that quickly.before destruction can harm them. Wake up, Understand what is coming.
Just noticed they see it before the Shockwave and the camera man starts praying before the blast.
Don’t watch this if you’re wearing headphones 🎧
So they must have seen the cloud of smoke first and thought, eh it must be locals burning somethin
All those broken Windows, she was just far enough away from being cut badly or killed
It’s haram to show the shape of you’re breast
0:12 Allah ackbar!
Ale jebło

My God

https://youtu.be/IsuslqbpLOs
Poor poor people 😣
You can hear the sonic incoming before impact? The news lied also immediately reporting 50 deaths?
Is the bride safe??  And also who the hell shot this video... honestly if it was a movie it really had left all experienced Holly wood film makers behind
This is a strange commercial for the new Sony Steadycam!

NADIE ES TAN TONTO COMO PARA ACUMULAR 4 MIL TONELADAS DE NITRATO DE AMONIO EN UN SOLO LUGAR ESTRATEGICO COMO UN PUERTO METROPOLITANO
Thank you so much
Hope the young lady was not injured
How far from the blast site were they?
so tragid.
GOD BLESS YOU ALL.AMINAMIN.
seems everybody forgot YEMEN....them humans too.
Did your hear someone repeatedly says  "Allahu Akbar"
From heaven to hell
Things can change in just a blink of an eye
March order
Wow
On s'en bats les couilles 😆
You could say the weeding was a Blast .  Jokes aside, RIP to those affected
Picturesque  scenery,  beautiful wedding dress .... the west, should pinch a few ideas...
whew seems like movie
The wedding dress showed how poweful that blast was
Michael bay directed the wedding film
PLZZZ CHECK MY VIDEO ON YOUTUBE . I KNEW ABOUT THIS EXPLOSION WELL BEFORE . THANKS FOR SHARING IT .
Jesus will take his 👰 away without harm , this video is no coincidence it's a sign of God .Repent and believe in Jesus and become a part of his bride and we all will be out of what is going to come on the earth .we need Jesus in our life you need him .
Damn is this real? So sad and crazy
oof
It happened like a calculated satanic wicked attack ,the first blast attracted the rescuers and the second was even worst to finish them all .
First case, they growem big in the big T! That is one frightening female!
Icon video .best videographer of the year
Wow in one heart beat everything changed
She is so pretty.
What happened to the bouquet ? Was it retrieved?
Хороший стабилизатор
OMG.  The people behind this are not human , they are creatures of evil and people need to do something.
Is the bride OK? We know that her nice dress is no longer a keeper but I want to know if she’s OK. And it was so preventable if only they opened the valves none of that would’ve happened they were empty tanks you leave it empty tank with the valves closed it becomes a ticking time bomb sometimes it can take years and years. My thoughts and prayers go out to the people of Beirut, Lebanon. I’ve always wanted to go there, I got close, I went to is real in the West Bank other parts of Palestine and honestly I feel like Palestinians are we First Nation Aboriginal Native Indians of the MiddleEast.
goodness gracious,  she is so beautiful
This is what extreme Islam is.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei5C53lUh1s
People wake up actors
First time I saw this clip, I swear I thought it was some sort of commercial or a YouTube ad, and then BOOM!!
😢💕 Beautiful Bride😥💞
0:12 it's funny he says Allahu Akbar and the blasts happens
Prays for Beirut!! REAL EYES REALISE REAL LIES!! ..this never shoulda happened but the government dont care! The people do!
Alhamdulillah
Unbelieveable
am I too late and lame to say her wedding was the bomb? yea I'm lame, I'll leave now
Weird I saw another video with another bride and groom only feet away from this bride .
ما أحل كلمة "الله أكبر" عندما قيلت في الوقت المناسب
Special effect.
Poor woman, to have to run for cover on her wedding day.   And she made such a pretty bride, classic Lebanese beauty!
le cagaron el casamiento
Very good - Allah was displeased with this HARLOT.
It scared me sooo much
It looks like the intro to a blockbuster Sci Fi movie.
So sad
When you have a wedding in that part of the world isnt such an event 500 dollars extra ? All Kidding aside, He is Very Pretty and THE ENTIRE World needs to STOP Living by moral codes from 9 centuries ago. Violence is the By product of Spirtually and Interlectually BANKRUPT.  Its That SIMPLE.
Am I the only one wondering why this looks like it was filmed on a potato? o.o;
He's saying Allah Akbar as they saw the explosion approaching... How terrifying that must have been...
Man that explosion just crashed the wedding photoshoots. Celebration is ruined.
🤣🤣🤣
Looks like The beginning of a James bond movie...
Her husband thought she was the "Bomb"
Was this filmed by a drone camera or a real person holding the camera . That's some sick level cinematography
🇦🇫😢😬😐
Her wedding literally started with a bang! I didn't mean that to be funny BTW... This is terrifying.
Allahu akbar = God is great, some people might misunderstood since it is usually shouted by suicide bombers.
Hahah😂😂
Unbelievable.  God save world.
Matthew 24:36-39  36 “But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,but only the Father. 37 As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. 38 For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; 39 and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
Repent for the kingdom of heaven is near
It doesn’t seem realistic.. it seems like a clip from a movie. So scary! Praying for Lebanon 🇱🇧
What kind of equipment is that?
I got married on September 11th.....not a great choice....
https://youtu.be/Ry7OKCX1gkM
الله أكبر
So sad
So are these guys just casually Allahu Akbaring all day like someone might go zippedy duda?
Looks like a Cod map 🤔
0:14 Camera guy: Nope
The rapture will also happen and will find many unawares.  JESUS IS COMING.  TIME IS OVER. Somebody repent and prepare the way
it wasn't an explosion. she had beans.
omg =( Im From Mexico City  I feel You about corruption  My heart is with Lebano
Don't believe everything you see online
Chaddi utar gayi.....🤣
Does it sound like he says "allahu akbar" at 0:14? 🤔
Allah-hu- akbar, ALLAH-Hu -Akbar 😍. Love to this brother.
She will never forget that day.
Right before the shockwave you heard the yells and cry's of the others who saw it first.
That wedding was the bomb...   Not being insensitive guys, just trying to lighten up the spirits a bit. What happened was truly tragic, horrible and heartbreaking. My prayers go out to all those families and innocent people affected by this event which was truth be told, avoidable and preventable.
Macabre....
New evidence found! https://youtu.be/A0qQOK5gzUw
nuclear weapon
That's horrifying! I can't imagine how scary it was during that moment!
Why this look like CoD MW 0:16     CoD Anyone?
I hope they are all okay, what an awful thing to experience 😥
Smh this looks like a scene of a movie
She’s beautiful... glad the images were taken before the blast...
2O2O  IS SO  UNFORGETTABLE
still for the photo
Quieta.....para la Foto....
she blew me away before the explosion did!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BEIRUT APOCALYPSES video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr0zTiu9WFM
now thats a photoshoot she will always remember. Tragic accident though
*You are evil 2020*
In Beru berut explozion
💐💐💐🍀🍀🍀
Before any of y'all get it wrong saying "Allahu Akbar" is like saying Jesus Christ not cuz he is hiding a bomb or sum
God help them
Repent
You're fired. You should have kept it camera on the beautiful woman as the explosion happened.
Holy hell 😳 glad she's okay. Do they know what caused the explosion. Such a sad tragedy
U said allah u akbar..Masha allah good words..But tell me is it good is it allow in islam that a woman should cover her body like this
накладные ресницы уцелели?
This is the wedding day of a lifetime. Condolences to everybody impacted!
😳
Looks like a scene straight out of mission impossible franchise
is that an omen.... maybe we should post pone this marriage...
i guess you could say that shoot was pretty............                                "ATOMIC!!!!!"  ☢☣🧨
Om my Gooooodddd..
That was truly breathtaking! The purity of the white lace of her gown, the beautiful bride, the camera panning down to the bouquet, and the blast so sudden and deafening; while the train of her dress blows so violently backwards....
The one exploding bomb also calls allah hu akbar and the one who is victim is also telling Allah Hoo akbar ! I mean allah is really confused whom to listen and mean while the bomb explodes and both reachs directly to allah ho akbar
This footage is going to be historical
Cameraman's level of commitment to keep filming. If it were me folks would have got a diagonal shot of assholes and elbows.
Damn, when it's this loud it makes you wonder how close they were
How terrifying that must have been to experience.
No wonder today people are on streets clashing with police and protesting..port of Beirut belongs to government and they are responsible for the loss of 170 lives and 6000 injured lives.. hope other countries who are less impacted by Covid 19  support Lebanon in this hour of crisis..
Advice to the groom: If you forget your wedding anniversary, she is 100% right, and don’t be frustrated by the event .
She’s so beautiful!   It’s look like a movie.  Suspense!
something screwy about that blast. They're claiming accident, but unless they were stupid enough to store explosives and blasting caps in the same place, most explosives will not explode without a cap. A fire next door will make them burn, and burn like crazy,, but not explode. You can stick a match to nitro that is in the open air, it will just burn, vigorously, but just burn. Same goes with any nitro based explosives. Back in the day when helmets were steel you could fill a helmet with water put a bit of C4 on the bottom and light it, it would heat the water for  ... whatever use. However, the black powder most firworks are made of will explode without a cap, black powder even exposed to the air will sometimes explode rather than burn. Was that enough of a cap to set off the amfo? Was it close enough? We'll never know.
That is the Messenger.The new Era the White Horse!
you can see the seismic wave hit first which is 1.7 times faster than sound waves equal to 3.5 quake then the sound
Poor couple!
هههههههههههه
You see americans, war is not funny.
She looks amazing but afterwards so horrible so so horrible
Fake! Lol!
Dude hears 1st small blast says allah akhbar. Then runs away from bride. Idkkkkk somethint aint right
https://youtu.be/PIH_lKZACPU
What a Shockwave!
He is saying God is Greater. Wow, in that moment. May God bless him.
People keep saying this is like something out of a movie. There's a reason. Movies have conditioned us for tragedies like this. Not a popular opinion, but I stand by it.
Those eyelashes acted as safety glasses
What's her name
The Princess of Death
So obviously August can in with an explosion so say. Or like seeing A nuclear attack. Prayers for all.
Damn what a horrible way to end your wedding
The only people who have the power and military to do this is our governments.... its so SAD how human beings are being treated!!!!! God Bless ALL!!!
So explain the "alluh akbar" comment from the cameraman right after he HEARS the blast and he says it again after he FELT the blast. HE KNEW about it. Inside job 💯
STABILIZER IS AWESOME
Lol what are the odds that the guys what say Allahu ackbar the moment the place explodes!? The meme has come to life! 😂
ORIGINAL CAPTAIN MARVEL Full Vid https://youtu.be/wXgOIbKxxcs
This was the first explosion the second one is is to horrible that was took all I think they also died
https://youtu.be/8VKMT9Me9Mk
Very difficult to imagine this wasn’t a domestic terrorist attack( even if through negligence). A government made up of terrorists, HEZBOLLAH has been part of the Lebanese government there since 2005. Why Is everyone so suprised that this happened ? Why do the lebanese continue to tolerate this ?
was it real ?   was it a scripted fabrication ? probably a scripted fabrication.  why ?  a blast  creating a shockwave that would blow a door  OFF of it's hinges will kill all human beings within that range.  a blast that would blow a door of it's hinges would not leave the glass laying near the immediate area.  the glass would be  EVERYWHERE.  some glass was blown out - some glass was intact and many of the blinds were still in the windows.  this was a scripted fabrication.   you may not realize the u.s. is literally 1 election away from this happening right here in your own back yard.  no ?  don't think so ?  who would believe a year ago - cities would be burning ?  rioters would be immune from police action ?  governments would support rioters and punish peaceful law abiding citizens ?  governments would mandate masks  ? forbid worship ?  forbid a birthday party ?  less than 1  year ago this only happened somewhere else - to someone else.  if YOU  don't fight against this  - it  WILL  come to  YOUR   back yard.  this is coming for  YOU.  it's coming for you, and it's taking your family with or without you.  at that point you will either surrender everything you have, including your family  OR  you will be making a stand in your own yard.  choose.  choosing not to decide - is a choice.
She needs a brace for them teeth
it should be wonderful day and suddenly became horror
Lol
https://youtu.be/3BNfY8FTjto please share this. The truth behind the explosion.
God bless them Love from India
Poor woman. She just wanted to have a nice wedding day, and then this happens. I feel bad for the groom and attendees as well.
That was terrifying enough I can't even imagine the terror that is yet to come when GOD comes back! The bible says it will be "Terrible" and He came as a lamb the first time and His second coming will be with a sword!
Bad shot but glad they were okay.  I wish her and her future husband a happy and long-lasting marriage!
Wow to go from pure bliss to utter terror in a matter of milliseconds is surreal.  The bride is so gorgeous!  Does anyone know who the dressmaker is?  so interested.
весело там у вас
That was a sign
"Call on the Lord in the day of trouble, And He will deliver you"  -Psalm 50 15
And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man: They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came...   -Luke 17 26 (End Times warning)
was the guy saying allahu akbar before and after the blast added in post?
try better next time. good day.
HOW MANY BLAST you DID on US SOLIDIERS.? FINALLY I GOT IT yourself!
Hahahaha i am feeling sad for her 😂
youtube channel:  bibleline broadcast network (BBN) video titled:  The clear gospel in 4 minutes
Brings a whole new level to “wedding crashers”...
Is there any up date on this bride?
Let's appreciate what we have
The bearded man in the background seems to be looking around noticing something a split second before the shock wave arrives.
I seen pics of the entire city it looks like a nuclear weapon was detonated.
Barbie doll got scared... OOOooo
To the people who don’t care it’s actually very sad some of my sousing are there and too of them died
Wtf was that damage my guy
She’s so beautiful and her dress is so perfect. I felt so bad her moments were taken away like this it would’ve been so terrifying. Then I think of the people who weren’t okay and lost their homes and businesses. That’s the scariest sound I’ve ever heard. They’ll be in my prayers!
Horrifying, I can’t imagine
He said a allus Akbar and then explode
Shit mannnnn my heart
looks like fps footage
Not something you want to remember on your wedding day. Prayers to her and her husband
This didn’t Even look real , this is insane and super scary .. hope the Lebanese people stay safe out there 🙏🏽
Dude maybe a little fucking warning
RUSSIA: can you feel me? BEIRUT: can we what? ILLEGAL BOMB STORAGE: BOOOOOOOM! CNN: It wasnt Russia, IT WAS TRUMP! ANQUEEFA: my cousins uncles brothers wife's disabled distant cousin was there! THE LEFT: now Biden is in for sure ME: inside job, likely taught and demonstrated by the same deep state Americans that facilitated Saudi Arabias attack on 9/11.
Damn you Michael bay
Scary! It's like death traveling the city and destroy. I remember the story of Moses 😣
I doubt anyone here remembers Beirut in the 80’s.
that shockwave was crazy
It was tragic but I think I need to say this , that makeup is 🔥🔥
"But that all changed when the fire nation attacked"
Horrible my god
I dont know whether the latest sighting of a missile shot straight to the ground zero has been released or not.. it can be clearly seen when the video is in a negative- color mode, taken from a specific angle..Im searching for it since
girl id be so pissed. she looked so gorgeous!
so Lucky both the couples are  safe now you can enjoy your honey ❤️😄
Oh god!
Who the hell said allah akbar
It is like the days of Noah. Unbelievers of christ will be destroyed
The explosion shocks me even by watching this video, don't want to know how it is live.
Wait why did the bombing happen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_Uu_23yKSc
Luke 17:27, repent God giving us all a warning.
Camera guy just panics immediately
Damn thats a sign from jesus right there
Redcross.org.lb
Am i the only one who heard that sound of Jet?
This honestly gave me chills 😨
To the bride—you’re beautiful and please don’t let this tragedy ruin the beginning of your marriage. Best wishes to you and the people of Beirut.
0:12 Was that guy saying “Allahu akbar”?
4aug was the 216 DAY THIS YEAR 6×6×6=216 AND OBAMAS BIRTHDAY SAME DAY AS EXPLOSION IN BEIRUT
Lmao looks like someone got the tactical nuke
The camera man must’ve been a director to record this.
She’s still beautiful
Michael Bay: This is what I called perfection
The most unforgettable wedding
Holy Quran(and when Allâh will say (on the Day of Resurrection): "O ‘Îsâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: ‘Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allâh?’ " He will say: "Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my inner-self though I do not know what is in Yours; truly, You, only You, are the All-Knower of all that is hidden (and unseen).
its nuke kind
I wonder.. 🤔who attended this wedding and secretly wished they would have objected to their union? Then, when this happened! that same person saw this as a sign, and tried to talk them out of it?😱  I’m glad to see everyone walk away from this though. Devastating circumstances for those impacted by this.🙏✌️
0:13 That guy who said "Allahu Ackbar" might've been part of ISIL (jk)
This is satanic a bride and a baby born worldwide coverage and a capital destroyed leveled by shock n awe.. start kissing your children and tell them a future of death suffering is coming
These are the last days a final warning to those who refused God. The devil has been born on earth. He is of age and willing to love. You all are out of time...your money will not save you. Your love will bless you.
As the devil Marrying it's creater this will be the shock of the world. The creater loves all and will have her husband and her husband will strike all her enemies. And they will love and dance with each other for all eternity. YAHWEH!!!!¡!
Her wedding day was a blast.
It is time 💞👨‍👩‍👧‍👧
OMFG that is fucking terrifying. omg
I hope no one there was injured...
That looked like a scene from a hollywood movie.... but in fact it's reality and this woman was having the most beautiful day of her life turning into a nightmare in an instant. I feel so sorry for her, that's just horrible.
Omg all those people! Praying for all affected by this!
it looks like high budget video not just ordinary recording
The sound makes it much scarier poor lady she’s so happy too
Now that’s really cool.
Yeah fukin play it twice
How far ?
It’s so crazy how the color changes before the shockwave reaches them
God is great the camera man

O...man...Haven't you thought-one day- about yourself ? Who has made it?   Have you seen a design which hasn't a designer ?!  Have you seen a wonderful,delicate work without a worker ?! It's you and the whole universe!..  Who has made them all ?!!  You know who ?.. It's "ALLAH",prise be to him.  Just think for a moment.  How are you going to be after death ?!  Can you believe that this exact system of the universe and all of these   great creation will end in in nothing...just after death!  Have you thought, for a second, How to save your soul from Allah's punishment?!  Haven't you thought about what is the right religion?!  Read ... and think deeply before you answer..  It is religion of Islam.  It is the religion that Mohammad-peace upon him- the last prophet, had   been sent by.  It is the religion that the right Bible- which is not distorted-has preached.  Just have a look at The Bible of (Bernaba).  Don't be emstional.  Be rational and judge..  Just look..listen...compare..and then judge   and say your word.

Hello may I use this video on my channel?
Thats why nukes should be banned..
Ok around 41 seconds theres something going on with her neck...it looks superimposed
It’s looked  like such a beautiful city with beautiful people smh
Could there be a clearer sign? Don't get married.
Nice that ABC gets to make ad revenue off a video they didn’t film featuring an explosion killing lots of people. Wonder if they’ll donate the money to the cleanup and restoration
shit you would might have think it's a terrorist attack, fugging hell
It blew her to safety
How is the camera so smooth
Well you can say that wedding was the bomb
Too bad special effects aren’t this good.
Cameraman: "Yo, you're on your own."
Happy wedding I guess
Look like she had a blast on her wedding day.......🙄
What an amazing effect.. and bride got amazed..oh sorry it's real thing. May the people of Beirut gonna revive soon. Stay strong.
Pain: Almighty push!
Poor girl 😥
Ugly
She looks like devil
I can't stop watching it. Heinous.
Did they really just play it in slow motion?
Lol did you hear the guy say allah huakbar
Oh my Lord Jesus in heaven .
She looks bomb 💣
2020 is bad year
😔
It's a photoshoot
She looks modest
If she was a few blocks up she would of been hurt thank goodness she is ok. 😭
😢😢
If any gamer is out there, this reminds me of the mission in mw3 with the car explosion
Symbolic of the Rapture and the Bride of Christ
I jumped so hard-
If there was any sign you shouldn’t get married lol
I am the GOD OF WAR! I AM IMMORTAL SOUL MACHINE! SENT BY GOD!
“Life is amazing. And then it’s awful. And then it’s amazing again. And in between the amazing and awful it’s ordinary and mundane and routine. Breathe in the amazing, hold on through the awful, and relax and exhale during the ordinary. That’s just living heartbreaking, soul-healing, amazing, awful, ordinary life. And it’s breathtakingly beautiful.”
I cry omg I really really wish all the people in Beirut staying strong. Wish for a speedy recovery for the Lebanon ❤️❤️
It’s hilarious to me how everytime something happens in the Middle East you just here a bunch of people saying “allah hu akbar” repeatedly
Looks fake to me if it’s real well it’s real
I wish it would of blew that dress right off and knock the radio to the Benny Hill chase song!
Song of solomon 4:8 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, come with me from Lebanon. Descend from the crest of Amana, from the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon, from the lions' dens and the mountain haunts of leopards.
most footage for first prize
Was it just me who jumped when the noise was? It really scared me 🤣🤣🤣
Everyone ignoring how stable the camera's stabilizer is. 😮 This guy literally running with the camera.
This is going to sound like I'm making a joke when I'm not that's impressive that she's able to stay standing in those heels
Daaaaamn!
This was such a horrible thing to happen and my intention is not to take away from that, but her dress was so beautiful!
Wow i feel bad fir them
Scary
Holy shite that’s not what I expected
Bruh he said Ola Akbar
The blast gave away the bride
The best wedding ever!
Looks like the opening scene of the end of the world movie. #Pray for Lebanon
Some people are just rude y’all should happy it wasn’t you 😤
Lol
What an impact,, that is very traumatic......🙏🙇‍♂🙏 you will never know.....🙇‍♂
these ps5 graphics look crazy
Dammmnnnn 😮😮💔
That Was DAMN F*CKING COOOOOOOOL 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
She doesn't look real.
Woe that's insane
Bittersweet it would have made a great meme
A wedding day they will never forget !  One minute preparing for the wedding the next running for cover !
Lmfao she was just modeling😂😂 people are such liers.
EVERY KISS BEGINS WITH KAY
Just astrology 101 that lunar eclipse on June 5, 2020 could be the reason behind bad luck and misery on the middle east 🙄 cause the eclipse was only visible in the East.
My God. You just don’t know when your life will end. Could have happened to any of us. They were storing explosives at the port. I bet there is more to that story. Prayers to the victims. Just so sad.
Why did camera man just book it towards that wall?
If anyone here thinks these two should not be married, speak now or forever hold your peace.
There's 2 explosions.  Small then big. And where is everyone.   Trump right?
So ugly.
Damn! I've heard of starting off a wedding with a big bang, but that's crazy! I hope no one got hurt from that wedding party it would be a bad way to start a wedding. We already know people died in the blast, but I hope that all those concrete structures around that explosion help to keep the rest of the city safe.
I feel so bad for her I bet she so sad
This should be a commercial for DJI Drones. The thing literally survived through a bomb without crashing.
Ужас😱😱😱😢😢
Just imagine what will happen in a nuclear war...
My name is William,i am here to testify of how i got cured from Cancer  by a Doctor called DR Abumere, i was browsing through the Internet searching for cure on CANCER and i saw comment of people talking about how Dr Abumere cured them. I was scared because i never believed in the Internet but i decided to give him a try because i was having no hope of been cured. so i decided to contact him with his email that was listed on the comment when i contacted him he gave me hope and sent a Herbal medicine to me that i took and it help me a lot, now i’m a free person now without sickness, my CANCER test repot came out negative, even when I went back after three months again there was still no trace of any cancer in my body. I pray for you DR Abumere, God will give you everlasting life, you shall not die before your time for being a sincere and great man. I’m so happy. You can also contact him if you have any problem via Email: doctorabumrer6@gnail.com, you can also WhatsApp him on +2349021975055. HE ALSO CURES OTHER DISEASES LIKE (1).HERPES CURE(2).ALS (3).HEPATITIS B(4).HIV/AIDS CURE(5).HPV CURE(6).SPIRITUAL HEALINGS (7).ASTHMA(8).DIABETES and many more
I got literally horrified just by looking and hearing this I can't imagine how horrifying this was for them I hope they can reduce the damages pray for the families
Everything changed when the fire nation attacked.
THX
Allah plz forgave us and help Muslims
🇱🇧🙏

Bride on her wedding day.  2020: *hey*
It makes so sick that Israel was behind this. Here's the link https://youtu.be/Tpnieb0fVgo
It's now been proven that Israel sent a bomb from the air. You can search online and you will find video of bomb coming down on the building where the chemicals were stored.
I feel so bad for them🥺
the blast even scared the shit out of me and i saw this before and knew it was coming.

They’re city will never be the same
Surely a wedding to remember. But really an unfortunate situation.
Well, now everyone know her with such a beautiful dress.  I like it. Even though the city exploited.🤦‍♀️

Hey 2020 plz chill a little!!
ABUAKBA
I can’t believe they didn’t catch her face on camera
Omg! I'm glad the model was ok! That was way too close😬😬😬😬

Allah ytlataf fena w b Lebnan 😪😪
I feel so sorry for her
God im so glad she is okay 😔
Great camera work
Damn who knew Resident Evil could come to life? But seriously this is the kind of shit where one second you could be having a good time and the next second, *BOOM* everything goes bad.
خطيا ماكاملت زواجها😭😭😭😭
Muslims and the whole world have been informed few years back about those mathematical miracles in the Arabic Quran yet they have been ignoring them all along. So far Muslims became the unhappiest nations on earth. Although one of the laws of the Almighty is "Nothing happens to you if you follow Allah's rules" and "Anything bad happens to you is from your own wrong doings."
Bro wut abt her wedd now🥺🥺🥺😭😭hope she alright
so stable the camera guy.
Is that a drone with a camera on it?  If not, that was some pretty smooth camera work considering the circumstances. Terrifying.
Marrying and giving into marriage
The first weak gust of wind you hear before the blast is all of the air that was normally sitting in the atmosphere around us being suddenly pushed outward by the shockwave, then the shockwave catches up, which is the moment we perceive the huge blast
When will this stop
0:54 is where it started
The sound of the explosion almost broke my headphones
Oml when the explosion came on , it looked like a video game , poor them :(
I’m going to hell for laughing... I’m so sorry 😂😭
She just wanted a photo
Allahu Akbar
This just makes me choke up, the fear the uncertainty, you don't know exactly what the hell just happened or what is going on. You know something exploded but you don't know if it was a foreign/domestic terror attack, you don't know If it was an accident you don't know if you are literaly under attack, confusion kicks in... so much runs through your mind that all of your thoughts just become your worst enemy... instilling more fear into you.. This is heartbreaking, how careless of the Lebanon government/officials. One thing I don't understand is how can people during these times, find the time and in their hearts to protest... holy mother.. This is time for them to come together help those in need assist your neighbors bring your people back up... then protest your country, demand answers, change and for those responsable to be held accountable, but right now.... really...goodness...smh.
ربي يحفضك  ....من العراق بغداد
imagine if those explosives got into the wrong hands.
Someone drop an N2 mine?
Anyone else hear Allah Akbar prior to the blast
:(
That’s terrifying
This videos shows the real horror people of Beirut had to face that unfortunate day. How sudden, loud and powerful the shockwaves were. Prayers for the Lebanese
It,s call real Hollywood clip😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
That's messed up because she was slaying!!!
I like the sound because I am crazy
Thats definitely a bomb
That’s so crazy they felt it before the blast wave hit  So scary
لا استطيع تخيل حجم الرعب الذي عاشته هذه العروس ومن معها في أسعد يوم لها، الله معكم..
This is so scary
my heart breaks for her  =(
My heart goes out to everyone that lost their lives this is crazy 😫😭
That is so fucking cool
man she is sooo ugly
:(
Here comes the bride all dressed in white.
I saw this on tik tok
Supposed to be remembered as the best day of her life is well ahhh well how sad her wedding will always be releated to this tragic day
According to Trump it was a terrorist bomb ?
not the wedding anyone wanted, but they will remember it. good thing the bride wasn't blown to bits - she has a rockin' body.
This girl is so F beautiful!
incroyable la vidéo on se  croirait dans un films force aux libanais et libanaises de tout coeur avec vous .❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵
Camera person must be a woman.   She left the bride real quick.   A real man wouldn't run away like that.
Somebody really said me after taco bell 💀
Omg. That sound made me get the chills. I couldn’t imagine being there when that happened. My prayers go out to that country.
Poor sweetheart. This was her special day and special moment. What a way to mark their wedding day.
🤕😞😞💔🇱🇧🇱🇧 الله يرحم موتاكم ويبعد عنكم الشر.  🇮🇶🤝🇱🇧
Fantastic four scene
How is the camera so stable tho
🤯😨😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😳😬
💔😞
As if straight from a movie.
I feel so bad for her, this was her fucking day and they didn’t have a clue
why tf megumin in lebanon
someone gotta 30 streak and used nuke
2020 is the worst year of this generation
SKIBIDI BOP MMM DADA- 0:58
Mabovp
واووووووو
Oh boy this is nothing like nothing of what I heard when I was living in Syria  But for all the people that got injured i hope you get better and for the people who lost their lives you will always be remembered .
Dangeros
Me imagino a los japos de hiroshima haciendo cosas random como estas hasta que los genocidas estadounidenses aparecieron
Good for the photographer horrible experience for the bride. I am sorry
Who else shook in shock and fear when that sound randomly happened
For first time saw something real in a wedding video.
.... looks kinda fake tbh. the camera barely even shook... impossible unless the cameraman expected the blast.
I got into it and forgot there was supposed to be a blast  That scared me
Got jumpscared
You now have the most interesting wedding photo shoot ever
Just before the shockwave hit them, you can hear the cameraman praying. This is a tragedy...
2020: This is not even my final form
Looks like a nice save of a drone, too (look at how smooth the camera operation was)
"Bride"??? or just a model doing a photo shoot?
Thosse at some fire wedding pics
So sad wow
Is she okay?
حتا الواحد بعرسه ميتهنا
Everyone wanna bitch about life in America. Imagine having to deal with this kind of stuff.
Hubby was already moving her to safety when the photographer found them after the shockwave. Saw them on TV and they were not injured.
😭😭😭😭😥😥😥😥😥😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😥😥😥😥
If that’s not a sign she may be marrying the wrong guy I don’t know what is 😬🙏🏽
Let's live for Jesus Christ. This world will only get worse. And death can meet us at anytime. Get eternal Life with GOD through Jesus Christ. Avoid the agonizing eternal damnation through Jesus Christ.
Life changing moment happens within mins everyday....Thank God they're alive.
Wow
This looks surreal almost like a movie..🤯
Yep....that’s 2020  But on the real note I hope they doing well there
LOL BS and fake..I like how you could see the air nuzzle at 0:58 in the upper right corner and also right before she braces her dress with hand with anticipation of air nuzzle....Phony as CHIT!!!
Great camera work though
0:14
Sorry headphone users
Where is Michael Bay right now ??
they Blew Up Grain silos that held 85% of the country's grain stocks!!!  With a world wide orchestrated famine on the way! LOOK AT ALL THAT GRAIN ON THE GROUND! Much TV Fakery and  Tares shapeshifting Fake survivors
It is like Beirut just cannot be anything but a bad place! ☹️
Sucks for the bride because now she's the poster girl for the best and the worst day of her life.
Who else heard him say allah alakbar
The island of Puerto Rico sends its prayers to its brothers and sisters, may you have peace!
Child: Mommy is there any special memory you have of your wedding? Mommy: *Vietnam flashbacks*
Omg I literally jumped
Camera Man was so professional he kept the camera perfectly still the whole time
I wish we could donate so they can have a nice wedding
Unbelievable,  glad the bride didn't get hurt
The flags are down in Jordan. People in front of TVs crying. Give us a break 2020.
the voice by it self hurt after hearing it here i started to hear lower for 2 days but its back normal and i live far from the place idk what happend to them
My heart stopped, I couldn't imagine.  . . .such devastation
Truly a day she won’t forget
Outlast 3 gameplay
Yooooooo he said allahukbar I'm weaak
The freaking visual difference between before and after is giving my body chills all over. It doesn't even look real, how can that be real? 😬
This reminds me of the intro to Children of Men
This has to be a nightmare for them. I feel so bad
https://youtu.be/YQE-9LkSJeM
Bless all
U guys realise that this was just the shockwave 11km away!
Looks like that dress was...... The bomb!     Too soon?
Imagine getting married and then BOOM
I posted a video of the aftermath it’s horrific !!!
My speakers are all crispy so that was ear rape omg
She's lucky if she didn't get hit by kiloton yield gamma rays, it looked atomic, only exception is some new technology that doesn't create fallout.
Jesus Christ <3
Lucky you guys have buildings in the way to disrupt the blast
Hi.
I guess you can say baby girl’s dress was “the bomb.”
That’s so sad. These poor people are just trying to live their lives. 😢
This is so sad 😔
unbelievable....so sad and devastating.....praying ....
Great shooting.  I wish it was only a movie ....
Crazy ass shit man.   Now imagine what the poeple of Hiroshima and Nagasaki heard/felt before being decimated
Is it me but your getting married in BEIRUT ?   Gee.   What could go wrong ?
It looks like a video game where those people are running randomly in fear
Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un
He was so chill i would gave shit my self God
🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🇱🇧🕊🕊🕊🕊❤️
I hope they are ok
horrible. A wedding is supposed to be one of your greatest days with your life, not something life traumatizing
So this is a blast not on some video games or some shit this is real and iam so sorry foe the woman she was so happy
Lesson learned, pls postpone all Weddings during Pandemic‼
What a gorgeous young lady I hope she wasn't injured and that she and her husband have a long and happy life
What it was a beautiful day to remember become their worst nightmare...let's pray for Beirut😔🙏
This is so sad, man. The fact that her face, dress and pose all symbolize happiness, peace, and purity while there's an explosion in the background is just heartbreaking to me. The world needs to change. I truly hope that she and her family are safe.
Whoa
This has got to be one of the most terrifying things I have ever seen. I can't believe it's not a video game, it's real life.
This thread has the potential to produce some epic one-liners. But for now, I'll just say the bride is beautiful and I'm sorry her wedding day turned out like it did. I wish her and her husband a happy life together and many healthy children to follow.
Their wedding was a blast      Don't delete me
*recorded on the Xbox Series X*
Did someone really say "Allah Akbar" as the explosion occurred?! 😮
This looks movie scene
She got a dumptruck🥵
Bet that dress isn't white anymore
Excellent camera shot tho.
i have saved this video to my smut collection... of course the tragedy is terrible but the beauty before explosion is heaven on earth
This looks staged. They were not even rushing  Way. See how they were walking slow. And other person just stood there. Also, see how there was a cut in the video. Then video starts again. Propaganda
I would be her Groom any day .
If this happened in America, America would care more
She's a doctor who was saving injured people. She's a true hero!
That was epic!!!
Who else heard the alla akbar
Man I was terrified even KNOWING it was coming. Imagine being COMPLETELY unaware like those individuals. I hope all is well and Jesus is looking over all those in need. Amen 🙏🏽
She's  Beautiful !
It went from beautiful sunny town to dusty apocalyptic town real quick!
😢😯
bruh i’ve never laughed harder
Lol a natural reaction when theirs an explosion he says "god is great" "Allahu Akbar"
All mankind is under the power of sin and death. Jesus came into the world as God in the flesh to redeem mankind from sin and make a way to follow, the narrow way, that leads to eternal life.  If you are not walking in freedom from sin on this narrow way of hearing and following Jesus, then you are in bondage to the way to destruction and hell. There is no middle ground in Gods kingdom. Either you are with him or against him.   To be SAVED you must: Repent, believe upon Jesus which means you go seek him and live for him from now on, get baptized in water, and he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and lead you himself and be with you till the end, and resurrect you to eternal life, in the first resurrection, thus saving you from the second death in the lake of Fire.... GET RIGHT WITH JESUS TODAY!  Matthew 9:37 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;
Wow that’s crazy.
REEEEEMIIIIIIIIIIX
https://youtu.be/r2CiLakmWmA
I hope these folks are okay. Well she got a wedding day nobody will forget.  No. That was not meant as a joke.
Thank God everyones okay in here ♥️♥️ however, why is this art in itself really deep art...
*When your marriage starts off with a bang, then your know it's going to be a blast.*
OMG-I’m speechless-just-just-BRUHHHHH
She will Never forgett
That dress looks nice on her, great fit!
I literally jumped from that explosion. That's must have been terrifying
This was terrifying :( oh My heavens
Im sorry but thats plain wrong to blow an explosive
Puts a new meaning on a day you’ll never forget
This is an old video i saw this a while ago
Imagine if this is a nuclear bomb.
شو في شصتر
I am from Beirut
Clebrate wedding with a bang.
That's what a really big fire cracker sounds like
this is so heartbreaking and unfortunate. this is why we need to cherish the time we have with people while we have it :(
https://youtu.be/B_hbJRNInkA My god she z just love.. cuteness overloaded 🥺🤭🤫🙈🥰
https://youtu.be/B_hbJRNInkA Don't miss the chance to see dis enjoyable banter😂
Dragon Ball Z in real life!
Hope the woman and everybody alongside her are okay
Dude my body is quivering just sitting behind a screen. I can’t imagine what it must’ve felt like for them. May god bless the people of Lebanon
The Bride looks absolutely stunning but that explosion was completely terrifying though.
this reminds me of batman vs superman where bruce was running through the city when zod and superman was fighting
$Pettypablo55  Cash app whatever you can it will be appreciated💚  I could really use a blessing💚
Wow.... the camera man didn't even shake the camera.....🤫🤔
This is probably the most stable video of the blast, because the camera is on a gimbal... Except of the CCTVs of course, they're on a wall
Where was the camera guy going tho? 💀
This is disturbing but honestly a stark reality. Wait til the bombs start going off. Dumb motherfuckers running the world are gonna be the ones to destroy it and us as well. Bunker babies
😍😘😇
Did I hear allahu akbar before it went off!!!
I think something is telling her not to get married
This beautiful lady will forever be embrazened in my mind. Her beautiful her strength peace be up her
This is actually very sad 😢 how life can just change within seconds ❤️
(our Lord Jesus Christ said) “So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’” - Matthew 7:12-23    “See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure. Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness. But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin. No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him. Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work. No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God. This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not God’s child, nor is anyone who does not love their brother and sister.” – 1 John 3:1-10   “Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.” – Revelation 14:12    “For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie, and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.”- 2 Thessalonians 2:7-12    “This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits. They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for only a little while. The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction. The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast. They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings — and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.” – Revelation 17:9-14   (our Lord Jesus Christ said) “To the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead. Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God. Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will come to you. Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy. The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out the name of that person from the book of life, but will acknowledge that name before my Father and his angels. Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the Church in Philadelphia To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name. I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars — I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you. Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth. I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown. The one who is victorious I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will they leave it. I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on them my new name. Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation. I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth. You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see. Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent. Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me. To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne. Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.” – Revelation 3   "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death— even death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose. Do everything without grumbling or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.” Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain. But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you. So you too should be glad and rejoice with me." - Philippians 2:5-18
*Go on Instagram @FoxNews and look at the comments, they are brutal. America is just Brainwashed by Trump*
i feel bad for the bride she must've been so sad and disappointed
Mw3
Wow, she's a bombshell.
OOOH MY GOD, ITS JUST LIKE A MOVIE
What kind of camera rig was this? It's so smooth.
Looks straight out of Children of Men.
WHAT KIND OF BOMB BESIDES AN A-BOMB HAS THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS???!!!
https://youtu.be/B_hbJRNInkA Experience it.. u gonna be fond of dis sweety❤️
It's almost like a beautiful but frightening film when it was played back in slow motion. When the camera goes down towards the flowers her hand gives you the sense she is scared when she hears the small boom from far away. Then the shock wave rolls through and what was a beautiful scene with flowers and a gorgeous white dress turns in to a nightmare with dirt and debris as the flowers vibrate and jump off the ground. The camera then flees from the scene but it's not till the camera turns back you can see the aftermath of complete and utter chaos. This is rare footage that can be considered a real life movie scene. Can't imagine how they most have felt.
Cant stop watching this.Look at his bro too at  https://youtu.be/onPVA5i1a_E
🙏🇱🇧
🙏🇱🇧
Superman fighting Zod with all chaos. Bruce Wayne helping on the ground.
This shows the cruel irony of life that when you’re feeling your happiest and most beautiful—your wedding day—a day every bride dreams of looking back on— is destroyed in an instant. I’m so sad for this tragedy and the loss of life and destruction. Truth is stranger than fiction. May everyone affected begin to repair and rebuild. I’m so sorry for your loss. So glad the bride and groom were ok. Sending love
Isnt it strange how the videographer keeps rolling with the filming after an explosion of that magnitude - ? Just awkward to me how a camera man stayed so composed - its not normal
At least her dress is pretty~
I feel bad for this poor girl. That's definitely one wedding no one is gonna forget although I think If this happened on a day I was getting married I may second guess that decision that maybe this was a sign telling her to run away from that wedding/groom. I feel so sad for the people of Beirut. All the people who lost their lives, the people seriously injured and the people made it through with out a scratch that will forever probably mentally screwed up in the head with ptsd, depression over losing friends and family and the anxiety they'll forever feel from this horrible disaster.
omg
*and thats on a crappy government*
I laughed when I heard “Allah Akbar”
This video feels like the sort of content that teachers will show their history classes one day to highlight the fact that the tragedy struck civilians just trying to live life.
For the people sayin this looks staged, or like a movie, its bcuz the camera man is holdin his camera on a Gimbal, they're designed to stay steady even if moving around...Thats why it seemed like such a professional shot...but man this is horrible...I feel so sorry for everyone affected by this...
That was a hell of a photo bomb.
Binod
omggg, now i start to imagine the blast in Hiroshima , how many weddings  were  ........ruined
Her dress shows the implosion or vacuum as the explosion happens followed by the explosion that was a hell of a big dettenation🤒
Okay guys, If someone can hold a camera this steady when a bomb is going off, there’s no reason for your video to be shaking while filming spring break fights.
Where i'm from, people break porcelain or glass at a wedding, because it is said that shards bring luck. If you want to see a little light in the dark, this couple is going to be a blast.
The husband is probably thinking this is not a good sign. ...
Why?
when I tell you I jumped- I couldn't imagine how it would actually be if I was there at that moment, may god plz bless those souls.
This is Call of Duty level stuff 😁👌
I thought it was a New Commercial for  that STUPID show, The Voice!!
That's f*n nuts!! Why would someone do that to people?
N her wedding becomes history
What the.... Its her happy moment of her life and then a giant blastwave just sweeps it away
Prayers to all from Kansas City USA 🇺🇸💖💞💕💓.
If they made a movie on this  scene will be added
Maybe we should be worried... things that happen in a million to 1 is becoming more frequent...
Imagine if the cameraman was in front of her, that’d be a photo you see made by an Artist.
It must be traumatic for them they would probably remember this on their anniversary every year.
😮 OMG like a damn Atomic bomb.
ALLAHLAKBAR
Wow better than Micheal Bay's explosions! 10/10 would love to see the movie
For a second I thought this was a video game with how smooth the guy was holding the camera
San Francisco is praying for you 🇱🇧. Our hearts are breaking  and we are sending our deepest condolences and love. May God bless this couple on their wedding day. She is so beautiful.

Everyone is so sad and acting like America isn't behind it stop lying
Just a short horror film!  Hopefully They were not to near 😦
Imagine this happening on what was suppose to be the happiest day of your life... Praying for this woman, her family, and all the people of Beirut 🙏
That’s some once in a lifetime footage. Beauty and disaster at the same time. The way the camera is panning in as the explosion happens is unbelievable. Terrible the amount of lives lost and lives changed forever from this.
Suddenly, suddenly destruction comes.
Just imagine that the most happiest day of your life turned into a disaster because of a explosion :(
Reality is starting to feel like a dream nowadays
Гсмтмап
Ohmy!
额
Crazy shot. This should go viral.
Its a sign 😖
That cameraman wont win any bravery awards!
Lebanese have to understand that they have to get rid of the hezbullah
Hundreds that survived are now permanently deaf from how loud it was. It’s reported that people heard the boom from up to 100 miles away
I know Allahu Akbhar just means, God is great, but ISIS yells it before suicide bombing, and that guy that said it RIGHT before the shockwave blast, was a funny coincidence. Not saying this situation or ISIS bombings are funny, just the coincidence.  Edit: Just realized he may have said it as a type of prayer as the blast and sound probably took seconds to reach them, but he saw the explosion when he saw it.
Is it an exploding harbor or is it her dress?
POOR LADY🤧🤧🤧
trump's fault again
In the END DAYS they will be marrying and giving in marriage, WAKE UP PEOPLE!! FOCUS ON WHATS TRULY IMPORTANT NOT THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD.
Smile! ~~~~BOOM~~~~
Definitely my experience in Pueryo Rico was excellent and wonderful, the super friendly people, the beaches, something about natural, the super exquisite restaurants, the super luxurious hotels. extremely large parks and very impressive museums I would definitely recommend the very impressive science park. I recomend you

Honeymoon in Beirut.  By Rick Springfield
Dear friend, Jesus Christ shows us the ultimate example of humility. God's Word tell us, "In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant" (Philippians 2 : 4-5).             Jesus demonstrated the greatest humidity of all. Though eternally with the Father, He chose to bend beneath the cross in love so that through His death He might lift any who recieve Him into the joy of His presence. We imitate Jesus humility when we seek to serve our Heavenly Father by serving others. Jesus's kindness helps us catch a breathtaking glimpse of the beauty of setting ourselves aside to attend to others' needs. Aiming for humility isn't easy in our "me first" world. But as we rest securely in our Savior's love, He will give us everything we need to follow Him.             Precious one, receive Yeshua (Jesus Christ) THIS VERY MOMENT!! Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord of your life. Believe in Him and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all mankind. Start living for the One whom is far greater than yourself. It is through your humble faith in Christ that you will be elevated through Him and in His glory. Allow Him to live within you, transform you and glorify you to be a blessing to others.  ❤️❤️❤️
Are they okey though 👀
Even the sound gave me a heart attack wtf I’m so sorry for them and keeping them in my prayers ❤️🥺
I would just like to say that i’m sorry people are blaming muslims and saying horrible things about this :(
Props to the camera man for staying on point
Movie trailer

Scheiße

@-nwg Xurmatli xurmatlilar shu ssilkaga kirib rolikka baho bering !
It's so Cringe watching this because I know at some point in this video she's probably going to get knocked over and seriously injured by a explosion blast. Really Sad.
I kno its wrong 4 laughing but she went gone
this was supposed to be the best day of her life
:(
2020 is a crazy ass movie so far.
Beautiful, terrifying and Sad. I hope she’s okay❤️
0:55 *DAMN BRO*
Omg this made my heart violently jolt the first time. Cannot imagine being in that situation hope everyone was alright 😭
It is crazy how the camera man didn't even shake a bit
My dress would be brown after.
Goregous young lady, I hope everyone is ok.
My heart goes out to all this people. One moment everything looks fine and next minute, destruction occurs. Prayers for Lebanon from PNG 🇵🇬
He was blown away by her beauty.
Why tf do they always say Allah akhbar before and after an explosion
This will probably be offensive.. But if something like that happened on my wedding day, I'd probably take it as a sign and gtfo out of it.
What an inauspicious marriage
truly horrifying.
Sad scene yet a beautiful bride
So sad :/
So you still wana get married??
Wow every single window, shattered
Not the best way for your wedding video to go viral.
beautiful
That poor woman her day went from absolutely amazing to nightmarish in seconds
50,000 people used to live here, now it's a ghost town
Was expecting some mw2 loading screen debrief after that.
Damn this feels like a scene in a movie
I hope this girl actually gets to live out her perfect wedding at some point.
Wow how far 2020 has gone i don’t think we will make it out alive!
Me : 2020 can't be worse, 2020 : You haven't completely saw me yet...
She look Beautiful
she really blew the camera man away
This made me think about the bride of Christ ! Wowzers
Deidara: katsu
My heart truly goes out to everyone affected by this horrendous tragedy. I hope that one day we can live in a 🌎 without monstrosities like this happening. I fear that the earth will not know such peace until human kind no longer walks the earth. Terribly sad.
Well, now we know that dress aint white anymore......
She looks so beautiful I hope she’s doing ok🥺
LOL THAT WAS SO FUNNY LMAOOO
You'd think they'd have a better camera
It looks like a game
...is her husband okay..?
Any mideast never safe, as US always propaganda 'freedom' and bomb
*She is definitely going to remember that*
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
That is probably a Bum
What a wedding to remember...
Well that’s going to be a day she will remember for the rest of her life. Wedding or not.
This was accidental, imagine the power of nukes or ballistic missiles.
Sad. They been trough war and much more. And the thing that’s almost broke them was caused by the people ruling the country. Lebanon and the people there deserves to be treated better
I like how even after the explosion the video  was not shaking at all. Good camera and equipments!

God damn, this shit looks like a movie opening
That young lady certainly has at least one absolutely unique video for her wedding memories! The family should treasure that for generations.
Is the couple ok ?
I would've had a heart attack
I have my headphones on and that sound of the blast just had me shook. Can’t imagine being there at that moment
0:55 is that her husband who turns up to look at the sky
Wow!
She’s so beautiful. Unfortunately there bad things in the world. Hoping her life plans will go forward. Keep moving forward.
Nolan: This is how practical effect should be.
🤣
The human life is as fragile as the fluttering of a moths wings.
I deadass heard Allahu Akbar
i heard the allahu akbar in the background & i already knew what was going to happen
What is the Beirut explosion and why is it all over youtube
How scary
Most famous bride of 2020
Ouuu she packing
Her eyeliner and eye shadow was flawless.. that ruined everything.
"People will be going about their business: having babies and getting married" -This is an example of that. Unexpected & horrific! *But so beautiful-she perfectly modeling that exquisite gown. Truly.
Where's her mask!!!!!!  Don't you know theres a pandemic!  Can she be reported to the contact tracers?
Well she still looks beautiful at the very least
Explosive fart
YEAR 2020... 😵😵
How he keep the camera so steady
Allahuakbar
What a terrifying year
Definitely a beautiful bride.  To bad this had to happen
Yeah people died but sooo bad for her special day ... 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
From serenity to war zone in one second. The beauty of the color and the setting was amazing and in the blink of an eye it was a gray, filthy disaster.
How they manage to get a shitier quality of the video 🤦🏻‍♂️
Omfg 😂😂😂 so funny
Omg I knew it was coming but I jumped when I heard the loud “bang”!
Holy shit
This made me crack up
i just heard someone say alluah akbar 0:13
She sexy
Just like a random cut from mission  impossible one would say.
Can we just appreciate this camera mans’ skills?
The way the cameraman moves makes it feel like a video game.
Beautiful bride...
Jesus Christ that’s got to be the luckiest, craziest and rarest situation I’ve ever seen!
OMG was she hurt?
Allahu cubar
Some friends' family lost their home but survived. They stood under one archway and that was all that was left of their house. God protects
Looks like the beginning of a music video
Her wedding was surely a blast!
I wanna know what's happening from a physics standpoint. You could see the pressure change as her dress flowed beautifully toward the blast, then the blast occurs I think and it blows out. Did the blast already occur and we just didn't hear it but saw the pressure change to make the wind flow like that?
poor bride :(
this is so sad, i hope she’s okay. both mentally and physically
Wow.  Shocking.
Allahu ackbar
L M A O!!!!
she's so beautiful i feel so bad for them that sounds so scary
That shoot must have been a blast
Poor girl :(
Guess she didn't get laid that day.
I can tell the wedding was a blast!
I'm getting shocked by her teeth.
The camera guy is so good I thought I was watching a movie.
It was a sign from God
My fking ears 💀
Hope she's okay
Still not strong enough to knock those fake lashes off
https://youtu.be/-bQm_GV7JLk 🔥🔥
Wow impactante
Thought 2020 was taking a break in August? 2020 came swooping right into this poor woman’s wedding and said “think again!”
wow... the bride is stunning... i dont approve of traditional weddings but she looked magnificent. so beautiful. great posture and stance. her reaction looked like something scripted. a gorgeous calamity.
What I don't get is why after the explosion the bride and groom head towards where the explosion happened? I be like holy sh#$ and run the other way
Everything in this video is creepy, even the bride
First beast of rev trump Second beast is Obama Trump will be taken out Obama will return. The MESSIAH returns in 2024 around the time of the eclipse America is Babylon  Babylon falls hard this year.  Repent for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand Jacobs week of trouble stated in 2017. Who do Jews call messiah. Trump. Who say the messiah is here. The Jews. Who on coin with king cirus saying make war with the light. Trump. Who is splitting isreal. Trump who has a peace plan trump. The are masters at deception
What are the odds that it would blow up so close to her 🤕
1:01 me on the mic with the boys at 2:00 am
Did anyone else notice how nice her breast looked in that dress?  Just wondering ...
Her husband probably hasn’t seen this video it would be bad luck
They took photo bomb to next level
Priceless video
This may be terrible but god those are some "i'll poke your eyes with my teeth" teeth
How Michael Bay make his movies
This does remind me of the introduction of the movie Swordfish though...”Sometimes life is stranger than fiction...”
well that will be a day to remember, but why get married on  Wednesday?
It was a Photo Bomb
So hot that bombs decided to bust
Damn that camera was very sturdy.
Bro, f*ck this year.
Meanwhile, some country still want to declare a war with a fucking nuclear weapon.....
;(
Wuhahahaha god has spoken
Getting married to Michael Bay lmao, but no this was a terrible day
Why am I suddenly having CoD vibes here
And the Oscar for Best Cinematographer goes to...  *Whoever the the hell this dude is*
God the timing couldn't be more better
I flinched so hard😭🤚🏼
Bro.... at 0:13 do you hear "Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar"
Not gonna lie, that camera work was impressive.
That wedding must have been a blast (dark humor sorry)
This is the type of video that'll pop in and out of our YouTube recommendations.
This looks absolutely terrifying. I’m keeping the residents of Beirut in my prayers. Life is very short and I we saw in this video things can change in second 😔 so sad
Did Michael Bay shoot this? Geez.
Man is lagging after that no cap
The first time I saw this I thought it was an artistic reenactment to bring awareness, I did not realize this was actual footage from the event itself
Hands down most interesting wedding ever.
that sound is absolutely insane! i can not imagine how the people in lebanon are dealing with this. this video starts so beautifully and then becomes so tragic. prayers for the lebanese
She looks amazing, so sorry this happened to you all 🥺 prayers to you all 🙏🥺
When she’s starts looking at the ground 😶
God that was so scary. Geez 😱. I got chills 😰
bendiciones a esta bella mujer
HOLY SHIT THE EXPLOSION SCARED ME
Didn't know they were aloud to wear such tight dresses....# fake modesty
Amor explosivo 🌡🧨🧨🧨
I found an interview of her afterwards https://youtu.be/FalSSaDmU_U
Starting the wedding off with a bang
That wedding is gonna be da bomb...
Nouman ali khan
Probably a sign she shouldn’t marry whoever the fck she marrying
Ya allah
it went from a pretty summer day filter to a post-apocalyptic filter
Heaven and earth will pass away Jesus said. But my words 📖  will never pass away. There will be a new heaven and a new earth. Revelations 21  We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness and to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity. 1 John 2:17  NKJV
Terrible
My prayers go out to the people of Beirut.  What an awful tragedy.
That’s crazy!!!
0:14 Poor girl was _directly facing_ the blast when it happened (just look at which way the dress moves).
Just a trip to watch it go from gorgeous bride to apocalyptic in seconds. Prayers for the people impacted by this tragedy.
Beautiful video until bam. So scary. I hope they were all safe.
That earrape though
Where's the lightning? I don't see it???
And they were just minding their own business! Like bruh!
Photo bombed
Big Bang attack !
People in these comments keep commenting how people are making fun of the allahu akbar but they don’t realize that these are mostly teens and children because they have been growing up and exposed to videos of suicide bombers tarnishing the phrase. It would be like if Americans began to blow themselves up and saying Jesus Christ. People would feel a little bit of oddness hearing it. These children are seeing bombings as a regular occurrence, and the news often cover isis bombings in which they say said term. So ofc there are gonna be people making jokes and dumb remarks you just have to except it and hope they learn better later on.
That sucks
Honestly  that’s epic.  Got a shot infinitely more dramatic
my dudes carrying his camera, I woulda abandoned that shit and taken the insurance money and keep my life
Bro that was funny af
More wedding days should begin like this.... 5 years later in divorce court the groom will be experiencing the same thing anyway.
that looked straight out of a movie
That scared the shit out of me. May god protect us all 👍
Who gets married on a Tuesday tho.
This is the best artistic film I've ever seen.  Hope she's alright.
WHY. Did. I 🤭 laugh
Terminator Judgement Day
This is terrible, such a beautiful day for a wedding, then everything is just destroyed 🥺💔
Hermosa. Bestimeta.  Le. Favorese a la. Novia.
Ik this is serious and not funny at all but this video took me tf OUT.
Shame on this channel for monetizing this video. You really need that money huh?
Call of duty
This gave me chills
Yo who TF turned into a Titan
That sound. I would have thought a meteor hit the planet. God bless Lebanon
Dude said “allah akbar”. Good luck with that pal.
What a increadable moment for her !!!SHE WILL NEVER FORGET IT.
Seems a little weird. The bride is featured right next to the street. Then the explosion happens where the camera wanders off to see some windows across the street. Then the camera returns to the scene where the bride appears to be being hurried away from another area away from the street? I hope no one was injured!
A beautiful bride, indeed.
absolutely surreal
I laughed too hard at this.
This is definitely not something you want to remember in your wedding day.
lol
fake
Not gonna lie. This is pretty funny.
Looks like a preview for a new COD game.
Any one gonna talk about the camera man just running away and leaving her to die
I feel super bad. That sounded like I could of had a heart attack..
Me after taco bell
This some Fallout 4 stuff here, man.
I saw this on ig. I commented that I felt bad that I laughed
I am sorry that such a beautiful occasion was ruined by stupidity. I hope your wedding ends up with everything you want!
The fact people are saying Lebanon deserved this. Easy for you to say when it doesn’t affect you.
lol
that's pretty cool shot
How hilarious indeed.  Whatever.  lol XD
Beauty and the Blast
Ya Allah forgive us and help us’ at least they are still alive
Wow she's beautiful
Were they already married? Or was it canceled?
litterly got the best shot this guy is going places
Photo bombed
That's fake
Stunning bride. I’m so grateful she wasn’t seriously injured. Praying for so many Who lost their lives, or family members or livelihoods
That’s crazy
Terrible
She da bomb yo
Bruh I heard allah alkubar then the explosion happened
She looks so pretty :( this is horrible
That must have been really loud considering that it hurt my ear in the video. I hope that nobody got hurt during that incident, very tragic
You can feel the power of the blast. It's horrific.
Omg
Well... she's definitely going to blow the attendees away.
😭
Holy shittttttt
its crazy how fast life can change.
Im glad no one was injured, *i hope* but thats kinda cool that they caught that on camera.
When a Mach of Nuke Town ends 0:15
I mean she looked incredible like dang but this is awful
The bride woman has huge ass eyes! 🤣🤣💀
Terrible. Pray for these people...
Wtf he dubbed her smh.
i hat midle easrt grrrrrrrrr
Wedding crasher award goes toooooooo....
What exactly was the initial noise? Almost sounded like a siren.
This is the first Beirut video I have seen and that boom scared me and gave me a mini heart attack.
She is exquisite and breathtaking
So sad! Peace and blessings to them all.
this is like a seen in a movie
I hope she is ok.
Her video is so much more exciting than most
Lord have mercy.
I'm in tears and goosebumps at the same time to watch this video. Both of them will get married and I could feel sad from the boom's attack when they were doing wedding photo shoot. Thanks to god, all of the people in the video are safe. #prayforbeirut 🙏🏽
Pretty sad bet there’s a brown stain on back of that dress🤔
Shinra Tensei!
This isn't app appropriate but the slowed down explosion Is hilarious
Looks like the Russian floating bomb pulled the trigger early
It’s not a movie.
I like her dress.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SxhLiTxdj7c
I feel bad for her but this was kinda like a movie scene lowkey
this is like a start of a horror movie scene..but this broke my heart i hope everyone is safe and doing well! <33
If anything why is the cameraman still perfectly panning through everything instead of dropping or something. That seems like what would be a normal human reaction instead of still filming just sayin
Did she make it?
Sheesh
Unforgettable moments i feel sorry on her special day the good thing is their alive 😍
The wind cloud gave me a jump scare
this is gonna be a super good movie one day, no trying to be rude, i just think there’s a lot of potential to bring something good out of a horrible situation.
that literally made me jump, I’m so sorry for all of the people living there
who said allah akbar?
Must have had a killer gimbal to get such a still picture after that
Imagine getting the nuke on your first game...
If you have earbuds in.. just a heads up you might wanna put the volume a little low
Wait why was he saying god is great right before the blast......
That jump scared me twice
This is literally something out of Call of Duty. I’m horrified
Bruh I literally jumped off my chair as soon as a heard the blast, terrifying and terrible.
https://youtu.be/eEa3vDXatXg
To all those 1% of people who are reading this I wish your parents live for 💯 years♥️😊♥️😊🙂
To all those 1% of people who are reading this I wish your parents live for 💯 years♥️😊♥️😊🙂

What's that sound right before the  wave hit
Buy imagine thinking Allah is a peaceful religion
To all those 1% of people who are reading this I wish your parents live for 💯 years♥️😊♥️😊♥️
Stunning woman. She looks like an Egyptian goddess getting married
It was all silent until the big boom happened😬
5 min in and i talk about a link.... https://anchor.fm/75thchamber/episodes/Episode-20--Portland-Terrorists--Beirut--And-much-more-ehoshd
0:15 am I tripping or someone said alluah akhblar
She looked beautiful. In glad they are ok.  GOD watch over Beruit.
Sad thing is they don't seem like they even reacted. I wonder if they are used to that sort of thing and desensitized.
@0:14 Middle Eastern Marilyn Monroe! They replaced subway with an explosion!
That guy is sayin allah akbar because he thought it was over..
That blast sound scares me every time!
Can someone explain who’s saying “allau aqbar”? Or how ever u spell it. Cuz it sounds like the camera man is sayin git it it’s edited in
Wow praying for everyone in  Beirut I saw the blast and there are still people missing pray for the those families and the families that have lost love ones!
So cool there was an unskippable 15 second ad for t mobile before this!
I'm fairly sure I heard an Allah ackbar
Wow. That camera control during that blast seems unreal
Marriage in a nutshell...
Omggggg bruh this doesn’t look real holy I’ve never seen something like this ina Lila hi wa ina elayhee rajeoon 🙏
Oh my ..... saw it on the news this morning l couldn’t believe it was real .... beautiful bride .. ... definitely something she will remember for the rest of her life
This is insane footage!
Oh my gosh I hope her family and friends are ok (as well as others in Beirut). My heart goes out to anyone who was hurt or died❤️ glad to see the groom and bride were ok though
😥
Thats sad for everyone. Especially on her wedding day.
I was so glad to see that God protected her. She was able to walk away!😊🙏🙏 She is a very beautiful woman!
"Some people did something..."
The camera is so stable it looked like movie scene
thank god she lived😖she was so beautiful♾
I’m wondering how the camera man keeped  the camera so still
She was slayin
Poor woman. Poor everyone. Truly horrible.
sad to the world, pray for Beirut people
You can tell it's real because it looks so fake Elon musk
OMG IM SK SORRY FOR LAUGHING😞
You can hear him saying alah uakbar  😢😓 🙏🏿🙏🏿
Anime dont lie, this pretty accurate
Abs Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️so glad she’s safe 💓💓💓💓
Its bother horrifying and beautiful.  I'm glad her and her husband are ok. It's so surreal and terrifying and like the beginning of a movie.
:'( how great moments can change in seconds to horrible
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. If you have been put down or held back by addiction, sin, weakness or infirmity, doubt, fear, or hopelessness, Jesus Christ is the answer. The gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation and if you will repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you will receive remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 11 days after I obeyed the gospel by believing on the name of the Son of God and being baptized in his name, the name above every name, the name of Jesus Christ, I received the gift of the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave me utterance. I was struggling with addiction, sin, fear, doubt, and loss of hope. But after the Spirit of God filled me, I was endured with power, and joy, and peace, and love, and an abundance faith. This promise is unto you if you will believe on the name of the Son of God and be baptized in the name above every name, the name of Jesus. Blessed are they who love the Lord in sincerity and do his commands.
Woah that was beautiful but so scary 🥺
crazy!...glad they're all ok.
https://youtu.be/kMtQymn507c this is the scariest video from the explosion !!:((((
from Instagram
What a beautiful bride. 🙏🏼 Such a tragedy.
How is this trending?
Honestly though, do you expect anything different from the middle east 🤣
I love how they edited the Allahu akbar right before the blast. Listen close.
It’s said allahu akbar right before it
Wow that sonic boom blew out all the windows!
Que pasó ahy
الله اكبر
Okay this isnt funny :)
Oh shit
Ugliest bride ever....must have married a simp.....LOL
Thats so crazy such a beautiful moment and just like that gone
no disrespect, but the camera work on this is truly amazing.
She looked so beautiful. Absolutely stunning. What a horrendous thing to happen. I can’t imagine how scared they must have been 😔
Looks like a movie trailer
Loud noises!
This really puts life into perspective and makes you realize that in a blink of an eye all can change!
to the amazing people seeing this, have a great day and stay safe:) i hope everyone is doing well and finding something to do in quarantine. my dream subscriber goal is 1k:) any help is better then no help;)
Was there two blast??   Creepy Video.
Imagine what was going through their heads! Probably thought it was the end of the world
He called it though! He said...                    Allahuakbar...
Some scary stuff must be going through your head the moment you hear a blast like that.
headphones.... Why did i fucking wear headphones... wish i got my reaction of my eardumbs blowing off on camera
Why is the photographer saying “God is great” right before the explosion?!
Who the hell is holding this camera it’s so stable when they were running incredible
Aliens landing
Does this not look like the dopest movie scene ever?
I guess you could say, their marriage started off with a bang
Thank god she wasn't in the midst of consummating her marriage when the blast happened. I wonder what the people who were climaxing thought?
Honey, I think it's time we move to Switzerland
Hopefully we can all live through this.
I can’t stop laughing at the fact that he said Allahu Ackbar just before the blast
Omg 😈😈 https://youtu.be/F-xxDAQv9Jk
Dude this is heartbreaking..
This sums up how humanity is treating one another this year, Beautiful for being us but distractive to everyone else.
That is crazy.
How long will the Arab world remain oppressed
Life can truly change in an instant😢
Anybody else hear a low flying jet right before the explosion!?
Life can change in an instant.
where’s everyone’s masks?!?
Ngl she kinda bad
Remember that one mission on MW3 where you play as a dad and a big ass explosion happens. Da shit crazy af
LMAOOOOOO
She. Is so pretty and so was her dress.I hope Lebanon will be okay.

Nobody: Hiroshima:

Best Wedding Video,EVER!
I heard akbar sorry I don’t know the first part
Thank God they survived
those lips look fake
I had my suspicions about the two, so oneday I was adviced by my friend to contact swordworm on IG who hacked into my bf snapchat account and I got the shock of my life ..He was cheating on me with my best friend 😪😪😔if not for swordworm I would've been living on lies and cheat..Thank you swordworm.
Remember that our President Trump truly loves our country. Vote blue out to keep your rights. We've had enough of crazy
Big Probz to the Camera man 👌
TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING
Hope she's ok. Looks like the windows were blown out.
What a horrible moment feeling sad for those who lost their lives.
You can hear the guy say 'Allah Akbar' before the explosion.
Holly shit
If there was ever a sign for the groom.
Whoever did this must love hell
Her day was ruined
I mean they already used to.. right...?!
She’s beautiful but DAMN was that blast powerful
Dont even look real
I feel soooo sorry for her 😭🥺
This video is orchestrated. Demonstrating Bible prophecy. They tell you all the time. They will set of bombs after rapture of the bride of Christ. Ask God to show you truth. First rapture will take place in three years. Folks, tribulation is on us.4th seal. Book of Revelation. Give your life to Christ now while he can be found.
This is like some scene in call of duty just before the mission starts, Rest In Peace for all those who lost their lives so unexpectedly
Well he did say “Alahu akbar” twice..
When the beat drops....... too sone?
Allah Akbar? What
That shot of the flowers in focus and then proceeding to the explosion is just so mesmerizing and yet terrible..
So terrible, all my prayers go out to her, her partner and everyone else affected by the explosiom🙏🙏
R.I.P headpphone users
Other than the explosion, she looks great.
Love to Lebanon from Pakistan
How long till this turns into a meme
omg this is horrible I'm praying for all lives lost and injured
Oh WOW that was really really crazy what the hell happened there oh lordy lordy lordy
Just wait until the reception then you'll see a real show.
Such a moment...
I just can’t get over the fact that this looks like straight out of a movie but sadly is real
الله يحمي بلدنا لبنان
تفففففففففف
Anyone else here ala ocbar
You have to appreciate the camera work though. So smooth.
The message is clear .
My volume went: DOWNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
This clip literally reminds me of a scene out of a Bond movie. I hope everything is okay with them :/
you know people got incinerated in the blast
hundred of tons of ammonium nitrate: BOOM Gimbal: Yawn
And boom goes the dynamite
Now that is scary
Talk about bad luck😐
A reminder to cherish each day as if it were to be the last.
It's incredible
I stg i heard alahu akbar before the explosions  (And yes i know it means god it great)
Tactical nuke incoming!!
REMEMBER THE EXPLOSION IN TIANJIN CHINA. LOOK AT THE SIMILARITY'S. LOOK AT THE DEVASTATION LOOK AT THE CRATER AND BOTH WERE IN A CITY PORT.    STRANGE    (   ;    FROM THE UK
holy smokes that was incredibly loud
She was having a blast
I prayed for all of those precious people involved with this disaster in the name above all names Jesus Christ!
Soooo sorry that on the start of what's supposed to be a special chapter in your life, you had to endure this terrible tragedy on your wedding day. You're such a gorgeous bride. Praying for our brothers and sisters in Beirut❤😩
So awful
Bxhdhdh was the day you wanna I gotta ya know how to get it to get a good
So many people lost their lives, hearing, homes, businesses, etc.... so sad man
Desde el segundo 0:17 parece que el video pareciera un videojuego
2020 in a nutshell
Lol 😂😂💀💀💀😹
The explosion was caused by that bomb dress.
Yo that blast legit scared the shit outta me
Terrifying. Feels unreal, like something from a movie
Happiest day of her life forever tainted by this tragedy. Just shows you how shit can go south real quick.
this breaks my heart so much
Don't worry people,they had a blast at the wedding.
العروس نجت بأعجوبه
This is heart breaking, Allah is with you guys. I'm so sorry for everyone who has lost their lives, loved ones, friends, pets. I'm so sorry. This is horrible. My heart goes out to the many lives impacted by this awful tragedy. 💕
On a day you do a beautiful wedding shoot, a catastrophic explosion comes out of the blue and ruins the whole op. The chances of that.
Everything was going so well until the guy said Allahu Akbar.
I agree with fellow who said, "when they make a movie about 2020, this is the opening scene".
may Allah increase the hidayat.
Prayers of Peace  & Love to all effected........
الله اكبر أبوية الله نجاه برحمتة الواسعة و بابا ضبح خروف علو نجاته
Shit looks CGI. So unreal what happened. Prayers to the Beruit people
It should have been her most beautiful day in her life.. now it’s one of the most terrible in her life... 😔😢 so sad..
This is a literal example everything can change in a blink of an eye.
Now imagine if a real Nuke goes off on people. This world with Nuclear weapons is just the end of mankind. World FACTS
Anyone who See's this message you are so  valuable and special to Jesus, he died for your sins so that they can be forgiven ,come to him as you are doesn't matter how broken you think you are , he loves you so unconditionally no matter where you've been  and he knows you personally doesn't matter what you done he'll forgive and wait for you to come to him so he can give you rest no joke he loves you so much!
She looks like that female lizard from rango animation
That is one damn good camera stabilizer, anyone know what he was using?
Okay the explosion was terrible and I feel bad for everyone who was affected by it....but like the building was on fire smoking for 3 hours before it exploded. Who the fuck goes and takes wedding photos next to that
When he sais Allahuakbar i feel really bad 😭 im muslim
People thought the world would have a quick death but dang the slow death is more painful, repent to Jesus and also can anybody tell me any good thing that happened this year. I can tell u some release of ps5( vry good one) we have cleaner air more than ever, we get to spend out last days with our families, we don't go to school anymore or work, but most importantly Jesus is Lord and he's coming soon I know yu hate to hear it but that's just a fact.
This poor couple will forever remember their wedding day for the terrible tragedy so near to them, as well as their own joy.
Just like that,  a beautiful moment turns into terrifying moment. Sad for her, but she's ok it looks like.
Is this being shot with a steady cam rig? Did the camera man keep shooting after this?
This looks like an atom boom
Rip explosion victims and headphones users
Beautiful bride glad she's ok .
My God this was heartbreaking her moment was ruined smh. #JakeHunter88
Well that sucks
Sorry for being ignorant but what is a Beirut blast?
Damn. Them pics must have been da bomb😱
Quite the commemoration.
This is sad I'm glad they were not harmed.  She is a beautiful bride with a big happy proud smile in the midst of a chaotic place.  I heard the guy in the back round saying allah akbar.  I don't wish this on innocent people anywhere.  My prayers 🙏 ❤  go out to her and all in the area.    Jesus Blessings and protection to all.   <><   Be Saved through Jesus John 3:16 Be Rapture Ready 1 Corinthians 15:52 Don't  take any mark chip or tracking device Rev 13: 16-17 Don't fall for the strong delusion  2 Thessalonians 2:11  Checkout  YT Acts17applogetics channel. Peace
🙏🏽  from h-Town s💔
They really are starting their wedding off with a bang
Wtf
*remembering those who lost their lives in blast and get well soon who are injured*
Talk about a hot dress
The n-th woman of this muslim is it ?
My guy is straight bitch made. First instinct was to run and hide. Didn't even attempt to protect the bride. Its probably not his bride but that shouldn't even matter.
The bribe was just showing how loud her farts sounded. Lol 0:13
Lmao
The town went to this "💎🥰💅❤😍" to "👁👄👁😳🤮🤢"
Really looks like a scene out of a movie
My heart goes out to her and everyone else. This is not something you want to associate with one of the most memorable days of your life.
Well need a better camera. Resolution sucks. One way to remember you wedding lol
It’s a pandemic why is she a bride right now anyway 🤔
Ok
At 0:13 the way the screen got so bright and her dress started blowing back and then the explosion hit made it look like she was about to get slammed into a wall from the force like in a movie or something 😳 that’s scary
Prayers to all in Beirut 🙏
bruh I couldn't even imagine their eardrums after this explosion
she looked so beautiful 💖  please donate and spread awareness 🙏
Traumatizing to watch. Can't imagine experiencing this.
At least it wasn't an American wedding when the ask, "Speak now or forever hold your peace."
Yo that bride looks like the bomb...      I'll see myself out
I feel very bad for her
What is weird and ironic is the guy in the background saying “allahu akbar” before the explosion..
Now EVERYONE knows she got married. And I will send the newlyweds my best wishes from the USA. Peace.
wie eine Atombombe
Wow that wedding was a blast
If that’s not a sign I don’t know what it is
No body walking around??
I can't help but laugh this is hilarious.
She's beautiful, and blessed to be alive! Rip to all that lost their's.
It was surely a blast
Why are you posting this without crediting the videographer
Ahaahhahaha
The bomb made me skip a heart beat
i guess this video will blow up.
So unreal
Here comes the bride, all dressed in- *BOOOOOOOOOOOOM*
she needs to dump her soon to be husband. This is a bad omen.
0:13 someone says Allahu Akbar in the back
Wait was that an Explosion , it terrified me when I heard that burst , it sounded like a  nuclear bomb
What a terrible thing to happen to those people. I heard she is a doctor and she quickly started taking care of the injured.
Ďó á fłīp
😱😥
The happiest yet scariest day of her life
God says no
I think they didn't have a blast doing the photoshoot
Most people would've shut their camera off or put it to their side as they run away. Good work, Mahmoud!
omg looks like movie thx god she’s fine and her husband
It's horribol... pray for all Lebanese people.
Shes a doctor. She rushed in to help other immediately.  A true hero
They probably thought Allah farted.
Holy shit that was crazy
Omg this so scary but good thing she is ok I hope everything goes back to normal in 2021
Wow 😳
You could literally hear someone say “Allauh Akbar” in the background before the bomb goes off.
Is the husband ok....?
Damn he ditched her quick
I know what happen was terrible.. But this video is so awesome.. Like in a action movie..
STAGED!!
Omg help them all & she is a beautiful bride , so sorry for all that has been lost 🙏🏻❤️
This is sad
😳😢
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FalSSaDmU_U             This is an interview with her after this
I'm sorry for saying this, but this would be a great intro to a videogame
Wow 😲 que beautiful 🤩😍😍. Pero lástima que no termino la toma😍😍😀😀
That looks like it was straight out of a Hollywood movie
Bruh yall cant be scarin me like that bruh I literally jumped 😔😭
Omg this is so shocking may Allah protect us
You can see the light intensify about half a second before impact and sound. Watch at 0:53 - 0:57
Crystal skull
what the actual fuck is this like a simulation? why is the cameraman not moving vertically it's like from a video game
FBI open up
They did her dirty with those eyebrows
Worst timing ever
wowwwwww...she looks beautiful though
The way he walk while holding a camera is like im playing an action game
Her and her husband mustve not been for eachother😂😂😂😂
She's beautiful, as most women from that region are. This was sad, what a wedding memory. Smh.
Their marriage started off with a bang.
Poor things... ugh! I feel so much for everyone over there... 🥺😭😭😭😭
It’s a sign
Glad they're okay
People will be getting married and feasting with there family enjoying life, than all the sudden the son of man Jesus Christ  comes out of the sky just like that, prepare for judgment , repent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus Christ! Praise his holy name!
Very beautiful Bride,thank God she's okay 🙏
Holy shiz....😨
This Wedding was a blast!
Guess you could say their wedding was a BLAST 😂😂
HOLY HELL!
Well that escalated quickly. The atmosphere was so tranquil too,it's a shame. I feel sorry for that bride.
I hope she and everyone else is safe.  Prayers from the U.S.  God bless you.
What the hell         That’s like the sound of 5 nukes dropping at once
My heart was beating so fast!!! Imagine what they must have been through
0:15 wow it looks like the flash on his weddind day😔
No offense but LOL I'm sorry that happened to you
Why no
I'm blaming the couple tho,they shouldn't have married in 2020
Amazing u can see the shock waves energy in her dress. Wow
If that was my dress it would have a brown spot at the back of it...
Lmao
Same thing happens when I blast my sound system driving around my neighborhood
Wow what a close call!! Poor thing. What an awful thing to happen on such a wonderful day!!
https://www.facebook.com/patallah/videos/10158862231900086  Watch for the drone.  4 drone strikes yesterday,  NOT JUST ONE.
She has nice teeth
😳
I bet she had a BLAST that day!!!
It’s like a fever nightmare.
This can be depicted has art in its true form, the beautiness can be seen in the beginning but the ending of marriage is chaos in its true form!!!! Brovo brovo brovo you captured the true essence of marriage here.
XDDDDD
man the sound wave was intense
Not as tragic as the doomed bride in the helicopter, who was captured smiling only seconds before the camera filmed the helicopter crashing killing everyone. Here on youtube.
I am glad you and your husband are alright. Believe me it was so hard watching the news & world news these last couple of days and seeing all that destruction. My heart ❤️ and prayers 🙏🏽go out to the Lebanese people & there country
She will never forget that day . For real !!!
was thinking bout that ass
The man in the back his reaction..
That's just sad.
You're on your own lady...
who else jumped?
Such awful timing. This is terrible.
Her wedding was the bomb
Allahu Akbar being whispered caught me off guard because it was said a second before the explosion
She'll remember this day as a beautiful tragedy.
Lesson learned, don’t get married in 2020
I know she peed and crapped all over that gown..
This totally looks like a scene from an apocalypse movie. So sad that it happened in real life though :_(
Dega q te trabe beras
When the guy with the camera was running away it looked like a video game..I hope they’re ok 💕
can't wait for 2020 the movie to come out
When the Taco Bell hits
The sound scared me so much I'm shaking right now
Why does it look so cinematic and tragic at the same time!? Wow 😰
One might say that her wedding was a *blast..*
She looked so beautiful!
A wedding is supposed to be the HAPPIEST moment of your life , but for this bride she had a very  shocking wedding
She gone
Beautiful bride✨ Saddening footage.
Jesus
Why does the worst happen to the best?
Awful
To all those involved in this tragedy, God/Allah be with you. 💗💖

Gave me chills.
Lowkey thought it was a movie 😓 I hope everyone’s fine
Aloha snack bar
No cap, I shit myself upon hearing the explosion. Didnt expect that. Prayers going out to Beruit.
All the way from America the bride is beautiful, love the dress! Hope for a speedy recovery from this horrible lesson learned to not store high explosives within city areas you were city officials who knew that was there need to be held accountable probably a democrat type of Situation it’s never good
Dude I’d of shit myself, what a fucking wedding video
She's beautiful
Great footage. Unfortunate event.
Hal SNACKBAR    (BOOM)

This looks like a scene in some Terminator Movie. God Damn!
How devastating!!!
Thats a day to remember when youre that girl.
Top 10 pictures taken moments before disaster
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18  Jesus Christ is the only way.
Looks like she has a nice body. Glad she's ok
It brings tears to my eyes. RIP to the victims and families of this tragedy.
Good thing she was protected by the court yard area.
I know this maybe too soon... but they got photo bombed.. literally... :((  I pray for Lebanon's quick recovery. God is with you and He is for you <3
this is so scary-
God bless the people of Lebanon I hope we can all come together online to help one another. she’s a beautiful bride sorry this horrific incident happened on her wedding day.
My prayers are with these people 🙏 this is so heartbreaking 💔
Dont lie who else almost had a heart attack when the explosion came and hopefully shes ok
Pray for Lebanon
Beautiful Bride 👰🏻 Horrible day 😞
Wow...intense. Hope they are all ok!
RIP to those who die but somehow i find it kinda funny the noise and the camera angle looked also no hate

She literally had an explosive wedding.
Nerf this.
The Lebanese show remarkable calm in these videos because they are used to Israel dropping thermobaric bombs on them.
the way the camera focused on the flowers for a split second
How sad.....
She fine
The dinosaurs had it WAY worse.
The video captures the moment very well. You get a glimpse of whatnot sounds like, what it feels like. I’t’s terrifying obviously.
That’s crazy!!!!
This looks straight out of a horror movie or some shit.
This why you don’t get married on a week day.
But according to the MSM... it was a fireworks factory explosion. LOL!
God is great before explosion? 🤔
Rip wedding dress
My GWAD...the O2 pull you can hear before the boom is crazy...that swoosh sound is 02 being sucked it because it is hitting critical mass.
Holy crap @upchurch this is nuts omg
Bruh I thought I was watching a movie
Questa sposa adesso e famosa in tutto il mondo...
My heart goes out to the people of Lebanon.
Looks like a Seen from a movie
Alisnya 5 meter
Went from 0 to 100 in an instant
In an instant, everything can be gone. Im just thankful to God that life still goes on and times like these we can truly appreciate what we have
Worlds coming to an end for real  Countdown has started

Imagine if it was a nuclear blast
I guess God doesn't want that wedding to happen.
Totally scary!
Why does it look like it came from attack on titan?
This is so awful. I would be so devastated if that happened where I was. Life can flash right before your eyes
So sad 😢😢😢
Keep on living
I was there I saw it..I put the clip on my YouTube https://youtu.be/PlBXbw3N6MA
Lookit that prominent schnoz
0:14 shit turned into a Jason Bourne movie
Wow what a beautiful bride . I hope she's alright as the rest her and her husband's family's are. What horrific thing to happen . My heart and thoughts are with with the families effected by that awful blast .😥😥😥
Lmao worlds over populated anyways
She was feeling herself ,
Damn this is something straight outta some Micheal bay movie
Omg
🦕
Ok
So sad- she looked so sweet and happy. Right in the middle of all of that... at least the two of them are ok.
so what is the point of posting this? for creating fear or?
That's artistic and then instantly horrific. This looks like it could be a sneak preview for a John Woo film.
you ain't suppose marry in a pandemic anyway?😷
Omg!
❤❤❤❤
Gimbal = 1 Exploration = 0
Who else got really scared and hopefully everyone there is ok
Such scene only can be seen in the movies   But I hope this will only happen in the movies
When the bass drop 😬😬
Allah is a unique word for god specialized to the semitc languages like arabic hebrew aramic it cant be translated to a language out of the family of the semitc languages it can't be plural it has no gender and it means the only one and true god  Allah (arabic) Eloh (hebrew) Alla (aramic)  Akbar means the greatest  So you say Allah is the greatest (you can't translate Allah to god because god can be plural gods but Allah no) For Christians Allah is the father that you refer to G od with capital in English
humans ruin everything
That scared the heck out me man.2020 really said pull up then.
So haunting. Like this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.katerini.mandelaeffect
God bless her!
This is some MW3 intro shit right here
allahuakabar allahuakabar allahuaka- BOOOOOOM  bro if my friends showed me this I would think is one of those allahuakabar meme compilations
debris littered the streets in a moment
Thank God that she and her groom are okay 👌
How is that camera footage so steady 🤔
What a stunning bride I hope she's okay.. that was a powerful explosion like I said I hope she's all right and everyone else...
Lmao
She’s so pretty
Thats look like saitama's punch 🤤😓
*LOOKS LIKE A DRAG QUEEN!*
Every second is a blessing, for you never know what will happen the next
If that's not a bad omen I don't know what is😬
My nigga ran and left the bride tho💯🤦🏾‍♀️😆😅🤣😅🙆🏽‍♀️🏃🏽‍♀️💨
Celebration turned to a really bad memory  https://youtu.be/Mre_klm2Yj4
I just said “holy fuck” out loud
Pretty darn good looking for a Arabic woman.
Camera stability was next level ...  Btw i feel sorry for them
Imagine hearing an explosion and posing for wedding pictures.
La hawla wa la kouwata ila bi Allah.
It's like a Allstate commercial
YOU ARE THE LUKCYEST BRIDE IN THE WORLD.......🌸🌷🌷🌹🌹🌺🌻
Her body banging frfr
Damn the timing couldn’t have been worse. I wonder if they had the option of doing it earlier or later.
Its interesting to think that future generations are going to have this level or record of historical events like this
Nacionalna katastrofa, jednaka Hirošimi i Nagasakiju, a neki je uspoređuju sa Černobilom  135 mrtvih, 80 nestalih, 5000 ranjenih. 300 tisuća stanovnika libanonske prijestolnice ostalo je bez domova.  A sad pogledajmo brojke jedne druge nacionalne katastrofe, zločinačke vojno-redarstvene akcije "Bljesak" i "Oluja"  Preko 2000 mrtvih , nestalih preko 1200 ranjenih nekoliko tisuća 250.000 ljudi ostalo bez domova. Najveći broj kuća i stanova srušeno i popaljeno.  A ono što čitavu situaciju čini "bolesnom psiho-simfonijom" je to što se zločini počinjeni u "Oluji" slave kao najvažniji nacionalni praznik u Hrvata.  A što to nije u redu s Vama, draga moja "braćo" ?. Imam dojam da se nešto gadno sa Vama zbiva. Ne sluti na dobro. Vaše ponašanje u meni izaziva duboku uznemirenost i zebnju.
This is like a call of duty cut scene. What is happening in 2020
Good timing
hope the bride is fine
That's probably the most epic bridal shot ever taken. I was blown away at the beauty and tragedy of it all. 😔
That's scuffed
why did the cameraman say allah akbar? how did he know it was coming!
The amount of jokes done in bad taste in the comments is disgusting.  Please try to remember there is a time and place for such things and this video is not it.
Jesus Christ that scared me  Condolences to all the victims on that day
My heart is bleeding Our World is beeing destroyed😞😭
This broke my heart, and scared me terribly. I’m so sorry to the people out there.
A) She’s gorgeous and congrats to her! B) This is such a horrific event. My heart goes out to all of Lebanon. Prayers for all of the families and people affected by this. The explosion captured on video was so shocking and hard to watch, I can’t even imagine actually being there. Bless Beirut, and anyone reading this, know that you are loved. 💖
When God tries to tell you he ain't the one.
Wow God bless you all
Damn who farted?  Groom says it wasn't me.  Condolences to the victims.
Words can not describe how sad I am because of the explosion. Many lives were lost. Please help by signing petitions , donating and even volunteering.
G-d is great no doubt, but allah has abandoned lebanon long time ago.    When they let syrians and transjordanians in to run their lives.
Peep the guy in the back u can notice the a tention in the air even before the first wave that beats the sound wave before.
Sad situation, but you gotta admit the visual is kinda dope. Blessings to Lebanon
I think something disapprove of wedding photos
Best wedding video ever
The sound and the husband's turn of the head indicates INCOMING! (to me)
Wow she very beautiful and that dress is amazing hope her love ones and her is safe reminds me of impression I had a long time ago and like dream laters🗡️✝️🌫️
Bride is a doctor. She went out to look and assist/treat for any survivors for then later returned to continue with her wedding
The wedding was a blast! On a serious note, glad she was OK.
I've seen pics of blast on guardian news. Interesting there was a blasted night club afm name miles away but the buildings or area around it was totally untouched.. Wonder what they we're doing to deserve such death..I heard the major  earthquake in Turkey was because of a horrible party too.. Everyone says it's reminds them of 911..oh interesting it's the American emergency code! Nice plan.. Well what about the damage USA did to Hiroshima & Nakazaki?! Nobody wants to remember that?! Too painful?! Nobody feels ashamed?!.. I think at least more than dead.. Massive explosion Don't start blaming Muslims.. Muslims were mostly killed obviously.. Nuke were involved too.. They said themselves existed in the warehouse A Lebanese told me to shut up when I said Hezbollah should give back the money Iranian government gave to them
This was supposed to be a very special day for her. Instead, it was probably one of the worst days of her life. God bless the people in Beirut ❤️
Looks fake
منو عربي يحط لايك
The Lebanese people have already suffered enough.  I really hope something changes in their government
Ahahahaha allah akbar then boom. Should be familiar to these people lol
At least the video wasn’t in portrait mode.
I hope they're not deaf after the blast
This should be a commercial for the camera gimble. Damn that’s a steady shot.
Sin palabras 😔
Why did I just laugh. Smh😳😔😣
Life can change in a split second
That's what happens when Muslims say Allahuakbar. An explosion. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Cant believe 2020 is even real this is movie scene shit what the hell
I feel bad for laughing
Talk about being blown away
I’m laughing because of how loud the explosion was
Ahhhh so she caused all of this chaos, there is other ways to get attention lady... geez
This truly represents a historic introduction to our new era of human events.                               ... time to wake up.
The moments captured before tragedy, this is a film masterpiece for the record books
I pray she and others around her got away safe
This video makes you feel like you are literally right there when it happened....absolutely terrifying
Oh man I love explosions.
🎵It’s like a boooooomb on you’re weeding day, it’s a freeeee rrriiiiddde when you already paid 🎶
MAY ALLAH BRING PEACE ✌ INSHALLAH
My heart literally jumped out of my chest. May god bless these souls.
Like they always saying be the cameraman to survive
Lmao
Ok but why did some one keep sayin allah-akbar
hydrothorax acentric
Beautiful bride ❤️
This ain’t the Bay Area
This look like some movie lol
That is one strong-legged woman, PURRL just behind her is all smashed up but she stood like an oak in storm.
Who attacked Lebanon
Damn such beauty and art
Wedding is gonna be a blast
Omg
Funny asf
I imagine is as God saying *"Stop"*
My goodness that unexpected blast spooked me! I can't imagine how they must have felt in person, I'm glad they are ok!
Welp this is what happens when you give irresponsible people nuclear warfare
0:13 and 0:14 does he not say "Allah Akbar" or how its typed?
Who would dislike this, people have died front this explosion
Went from: 🧚🏻‍♀️🥰💗💝💞🎉.                     To: 💨💨💨💨💥💥💥💥🔥💥☄️☄️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌪🌪☄️⛅️☄️⚡️☄️💥⚡️⚡️☄️💥⚡️⚡️🔥
that's just messed up
Is it fake or real
99% won't see this but,  *those who are reading this, you may become successful in the future.*
Wow.  She is beautiful!! So sad that day 😭
Allah akbar
R.I.P her flowers
Glad was only the scared and nothing more happened
Is that a goat?
Goofy lookin w/ so much makeup. I bet there’s a brown stain on that wedding dress now 🤣
Imagine a blast like this times 10,000 with the scene and wedding party obliterated, it was called Hiroshima
It’s just crazy, looks like something you see in movies.
The bouquet...blowing her joy away...
WOW real life
I feel sorry for this bride, and all Muslims who live like this. It was probably done just for the photo shoot. Instead of turning on a fan to blow her hair and dress around, they blew up some local infidels. Ah yes, a honeymoon in Beirut.
This looks like something out of a movie
At least they made it out alive
Wow. 😢 praying for Lebanon
Trump says top U.S. generals believe explosion in Beirut was an “attack”
https://youtu.be/tdbeXQALCyQ
Thank God they r alive.
Just like the movies.
Was this a drone
This is the most interesting juxtaposition of events.
I hope the woman gave consent to have her image spread all over the internet like this She must be incredibly traumatised right now!
And that's why you shouldn't get married.
This is horrific! She is absolutely gorgeous. I can't believe this happened 😭 it's like watching a movie.
That’s so scary.. it’s like what you see in the movies..☹️
Omg so scary.. seemed like right out of a movie 😖
If they put this scene in movie, it would won best director & best cinematography at oscars.
That made my heart jump
God bless , sending prayers & peace in any anxious hearts🌿
Somebody just farted
If there ever was a sign from above not to get married. That may have been it.  All jokes aside I'm glad they're okay.
Dang this crazy soon as she pulled her dress BOOM! I feel bad🤦🏽‍♂️
You can hear the camera man immediately begin to pray after the first, smaller explosion.
It's saddening, to watch a beautiful capture of a Moment of Time ,to be horribly destroyed the next Second. ..I pray to God to have Mercy & make this World peaceful for everbody! I'm glad the Bride & People got away with not been harmed!
Is that a bomb?
She will always be able to say her wedding was a blast. Seriously though what a horrible thing for everyone there. To look so happy and then shear horror.
Looks like a scene from an action movie.
I'm speechless... wheres the 4K video footage of this?
Some thing out of a movie
allahuakbar
Well done Good Job, this guy took the most dramatic and rarest alternative wedding video in the history of human wedding in the world, and wrote a new history. Very Hollywood Style ! Give this guy an Oscar Academy ! (This is only a mess up and nonsense, don’t take it seriously)
Hahahahah Allah is dead hahahahahaha
This Beirut explosion is truly devastating. The magnitude suggest something sinister. This doesn't look like ordinary accident or occurrence. Whoever is responsible for this carnage God Almighty will never allow him to have any peace. Truly humanity is on leave.🤔
0:14 from the movie become real life. Hope they are ok
almost died on her wedding day
A beautiful bride though. Glad they are ok
Now that's a blowout 💣 ass wedding
That was a monster fart 😂
Poor people of Beirut. Prayers are lifted up to our Lord, for the people of Beirut. What an utter catastrophe. My prayers and thoughts are with you. What can we do to help these poor people?
Hope she wasn't injured
The way it gets a little bit brighter, I couldn’t imagine going through something like this
Lebanon we stand with you
0:09 Lebanon
That cameramans reaction was pure instinctual panic
That must of been absolutely traumatic for them, sending my love to everyone there.     stay safe x
Women: What was that sound? Me: OH NO! THERE IS AN EXPLOSION ON UR BIG DAY Women: aww man that was a disaster
Watching this with earphone with high volumes, that explosion blasted my ears jesus! That was massive! Hope they’re okay
Why was he saying Allah akbar
Bruh he dipped and left her lmao
The best camera gimble even can withstand bomb shockwave
Listen @00:12
That sucks
If it happened on the wedding night. Did the earth move for you too?
Thats one hell of a blast! Pretty lady by the way..
Honestly, my first thought would have been some sort of massive bomb and war.
For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,   And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  Matthew 24:38‭-‬39
Jesus with a proper microphone like that you can really tell how loud the explosion was! R.I.P ears
Biutiful bride and terrible paisaj
That was a sign to not get married
How did the blast occur right after the person say allah hu akbar
My heart is breaking for these people.. I could never imagine my son having to go through this, so scary and devastating. Prayers to their country.
Those are hella bridal pics!😲
😢😢😢😢
Planned as wedding video. Became a Michael Bay.
If thats not a sign to not get married i dont know what is???
Thanks something heavy not hit on ground
Pro photographer using steady cam rig.  This does look like a kick ass intro to an action movie or the next call of duty.
Why not show us the real  victims, instead of this green room photoshoot.
00:50 He hears the whistle, right before the wave(in the background) 00:50
That is some crazy footage jesus christ!
Completly fake
That veil!
How everything changes in a  second .
wow, this is so surreal
And that was the FIRST explosion the second one was TERRIBLE
It's not just the explosion, look at the 1:04 window columns, they are losing pieces to the earthquake caused by the explosion itself.
Epic.
So damn sad. What a tragic shame. I have heard it was a terrorist attack n now hearing it may have been an accident. They will find out soon. I pray for the good people of Berut.
As a human being, I am horrified. But as a former videographer, I can't help but marvel at the stability of that glide cam.
حسبنا الله و نعم الوكيل
I'm curious as to whether or not the blast blew off those ludicrous fake eye lashes.
The camera movement looks like COD as he approaches the windows
Kinda haunting in a way like a nightmare everything is peaceful and okay then all hell is unleashed
Wtf
0:12 you can only see your hand yet you feel the sheer shock and panic going through her body before the shockwave comes
Damn I flinched. And it’s a video can’t image how bad it was in real life
shocking, Such a horrific tragedy, How could this happen? How come they stored all those explosives there when the country is already in the war zone,It is so sad I wish the people get recovered who got injured, get started forever, Let's fly together and win together
well that will be memorable *yikes*
My heart feels for her, I hope she gets her dream wedding. May Allah bless her heart and her family
Can't have an explosion without a good allahu akbar!
This looks like a Spielberg Movie. The blast occured at the exact time the cameraman shot the flowers. Very professionnal filming by the way, you could feel the power of the blast trought the movements of the dress. Artistic but horrible at the same time.
“allah ackbar” ....*BOOM*  pretty typical tho
So we can’t go a month without some bs
Horrifying!!
Everybody relax, i think the dress is ok. And the camera guy is still available for hire. Due to his heroic and quick reaction to save the camera.
Man 2020 is just not playing around.
I'm so happy she isn't injured
It felt like an introduction to some Michael Bay movie.
A beautiful dream turned into a nightmare. So sad hope she didn’t get hurt 😞
The cameraman didnt know whether to run or fly
wow
A nice Lebanese wedding. So fun living in a hellhole
I have seen the dead bodies on IG i swear it’s gruesome I won’t get into details because it’s fucking gruesome and sad and It’s the worst way someone could lose a life don’t let your children watch it
It was supposed to be a beautiful day for her instead... 💔💔
Omg what if her bridegroom was where the explosion happened😳
Bruh
The man shown briefly behind her sensed something about to happen...about 53, 54 second. He may have been operating the drone but he wasn't looking at it or the bride.
This video is gonna become historic pretty soon to help capture 2020 in the future.
This is like a video game advertisement.
She didn’t have to wait till the wedding night for the earth to move.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuvY-Udd_h4
I think this in moving acutting but still really allah akbor
Lol
🙏❤ to Lebanon
0:17 *camera man like window*
Beautiful but not expect scare people’s. Also. Praying hope everything is allright
I think that under all that make up and botox could be a nice looking person.
Just shows how fast a beautiful day can change into a fucking nightmare.
How was the wedding 👰? It was the bomb 💣🔥!
:54 the guy in the background looks up like he knows something is coming then boom!
How the hell was the camera so steady the whole time???
Bj from the habor before Wedding?
This honestly looks like a scene you would see in a movie 😱
From feeling on top of the world to that...
please be safe
That drone operator though
Omg I have seen this kind of things only  on movie😥😥
Beautiful lady. I wish her and her husband a long and wonderful marriage and Beirut a swift and full recovery.
Maybe youre marrying the wrong man.
Fake
Hurts me to see this.  I have no words.
god damm!
She can certainly say she had a 'blast' on her wedding day!
Maybe if she take some of that makeup off and all those eyelashes.
Good grief, she's Hot! No wonder there was an explosion!!
I would’ve taken as a sign I wasn’t suppose to get married.
Wtf did we just see ,I think you found your bomber the dude knew it was coming he didn't even flinch and he ran to the blast not away from it.either he was in on it or hes got nerves of a super hero..
That was really scary!!!
For today, the most beautiful and captivating woman in the world. Demostarating the eloquence, hope, pride and now resiliency of the Lebanese people.  What an saddly extraordinary way to capture the moment.
is it me or did anyone notice at the 0:13 mark , they guy says .."Allah HU Akbar"  and in my head i Hear the ISIS theme song play
We just gunna ignore the guy saying “Allahu Akbar”?
Holy fuck. She must’ve been scared senseless.
So ugly!
WOW! That is just crazy. When I was in Beirut I witnessed a lot a blasts similar to this one.
Shes kinda hot.
i saw her talk to reporters without the bridal make up after the explosion.....omg she still looks so beautiful even with casual outfit.
Her dress is gorgeous I’d want the same....horrible that her wedding was ruined by such a terrible event
I can’t imagine how terrifying this had to have been.
Rip Mia Khalifa
So sad... 🙏😔
They were shooting during what photographers call the "golden hour" when daylight is redder and softer than when the sun is higher in the sky. It's in this courtyard area surrounded on all four sides by tall buildings that they got the least amount of harsh shadows and, unbeknownst to them, protective shielding from the blast of the explosion.
لا حول ولا قوة الا بالله وجعت قلوبنا بيروت
Gotta blast!
Even THROUGH ME CELL PHONE... that was the scariest sound I’ve EVER HEARD.!! Prayers to Lebanon🙏
Crazy
EVERYONE IN BEIRUT JUST DECIDED TO GO ABOUT THEIR DAY AS A FEROCIOUS, EXPLOSIVE INFERNO WAS RAGING BLOCKS AWAY???
Are you fucking kidding me? Someone saying Hallula akhbar RIGHT as the explosion happens then the perfectly level video footage?
Beautiful bride and a gorgeous dress I feel sorry for her
How far is this from the blast?
Awesome!!!
Looked like a scene from Mission Impossible. Especially when he focuses on the flowers and the scene changes from happy to gloomy in a matter of seconds
Wonder if she still has her hearing
Look at her... little bombshell made the windows fly out on their wedding night
You can see how quickly everything was ruined. A matter of seconds
I hope this bride and her family are okay.  My prayers for the wellbeing of the people of Beirut , Lebanon.
Omg my heart breaks for this city. Can we please send USNS comfort or mercy ships to this area to assist with the injured. I can only imagine hospitals are flooded not only with this but COVID-19 as well. So sad. Let’s help them heal.
Poor thing tragic!
The video is fake
I Pet Goat
They were like "later".
Baby you rock my world!!!
this is crazy.... almost out of a war film or something !
Oh she got cut.  Look at the columns in the windows.  Also eyebrows.
She looked so beautiful and happy and then the worst thing happens.  I feel so bad for the woman.
She is beautiful in her dress wish her the best
Yikes!
What an explosive photo shoot
I know what happened is absolutely terrible, and as I said I am praying for everyone, but I have to say WOW SHE IS BEAUTIFUL!!!! Absolutely STUNNING!!  Edit: for the person who thought this was shallow of me to comment about. Look I am sorry if my comment made you feel some kind of negative energy. However I will never apologize for being able to appreciate beauty in a world filled with so much Chaos.
The air blows from the opposite angle of the blast even... fake fake fake
https://youtu.be/LkRnjU-chgA
So hollywood
why is the camera moving like that
why is the camera moving like that
How far away was she from the explosion
Wow...he really married the bomb.
She is hot! Lucky dude. He has one hell of challenge to rock her world more  than that blast just did!
Steadicam!
The motion of the camera is very weird. Why did it slowly turn toward a window?
Like out of an action movie.  Couldn't have timed it better.
how did the cameraman hold so steady?
I want that videographers gimbal! Not one shake on that blast.
"Some people did,...some-ting"
Creepy looking lady
Waw kreatif
Her eyebrows could withstand a nuke.
Damn. That's looks like a scene from an 80s movie where a nuclear blast suddenly goes off.
Her beauty is explosive...
I guess the wedding was a blast
He knew there was a possibility he was going to be hurt and immediately said “allahu akbar” which means “god is great”
DEW (Direct Energy Weapon) was used! https://youtu.be/A0qQOK5gzUw
The camera guy though. I can't even hold my phone straight
When the bass drops!
Surreal
Lebanon Is Now Chernobyl History Repeated itself...
I wouldn't have run away, but towards her and covered her because I wouldn't be happy with myself if such a young beautiful girl died on her wedding day. God bless Lebanon.
Aweh ♡ beautiful girl. Was about to get married and then a horrible tragedy. Thank go she is okay
If they were not in a sheltered compound they just might have well, more than likely,  lost their lives. They were blessed and thank God it wasn't adding such a tragic incident like this as if there wasn't enough tragedy  in Lebanon that day as it was.
Best bride's photoshoot  ever!
Bet her husband will not forget their anniversary.
Stop posing start praying
Real life Fairy tale!!!!!!😢🙁
Wow. Scary.
😥😢🙏
😥😥😥😥
Everything you know can be changed in a split second. God bless them.
Imagine what a nuclear bomb would do..crazy
Solid gimbal right there.
God bless Lebanon.
Glad she is okay .hope they all okay .Jesus Christ Mama Mary holy spirit or allah whatever is our beliefs .hope this time we keep strong and always Pray to GOD  AMEN ....
I cannot imagine how scary  these moment
We need to know the I sheer scale of a ATOMIC bomb to this explosion   I really think this explosion is equivalent to a small nuke  Any opinions?
Whoa she is stunning!! Lucky man!!
She will always be the symbol of this day I think.
Well that's a wedding day to remember
Imagine how much destruction will a nuclear bomb would do 😯 , Humans are cause for their own destruction
Doesn't "show" the explosion.
Should have seen her face!! what a shocking surprise!!
ok i almost had a heart attack...
Y did he say Allah akbar....???
That was insane!! And she looked amazing! Hope they were ok.
Why is his allah akbar the same tone after the explosion as before it.
I hope they got some good pictures before the blast.
Damn, talk about a day to remember.
RIP TO ALL who died! So sad :'(  Unbelievable... what happened. I hope that the whole world will help all those people, to find people who are stuck between buildings. To bring them water and food! And shelter, to rebuilt there homes! We have to help them. This is so sad to see :( it breaks my hearth! I saw on my television, my country, the netherlands. They send people to help within one day! With dogs to find those who are missed! I'm very proud of them! I hope more country's will follow! To find every single kind who's still alive! May god be on your side. My thoughts are now on Beirut😖😢. Please be safe everyone!!!  I'll light up a candle in church tomorrow for all the survivors, and those who are suffering ❤. Stay strong!!! Greetings from the Netherlands
That's terrible.
Wait! Isn't it the bride that's supposed to blow everyone away?
Explosion might have made her not a virgin anymore, shockwave/air pressure. Husband might be mad.
Prayers for the people of Beirut
THANK GOD SHE WAS SAFE
Wow, scary and sad for this beautiful bride. Six mile blast radius
She is a gorgeous bride!
this is crazy
How did the camera move around like that? It seems like CGI. Is this real?
at least no excuses to forget the anniversary!!!😄...im glad they are ok!!
Hideous
It's always odd experiencing an event where awesome physics are on display. The way the sound travelled initially, then being able to feel the blast had to be terrorizing.
Beautiful as all get out but did you hear allahu akbar then boom
An unforgettable union!
wait a sec, did you guys edit in the "Allahu Akbar"? because that's a hella coincidence
Who paid for this wedding? I thought the country was broke?

#ForçaLibano 😢
إنها جميلة مع بقية الناس هناك.إنها جميلة مع بقية الناس هناك.
that blast just on here sent me into shock. I can't even imagine what the impact there felt like. Maybe being disintegrated in a flash.
The guy said allahu akbar before the explosion LOL
I am happy for them that they were in an interior courtyard and sheltered from the worst of it.
She will never forget this though. 40 years later, "Hey honey do you remember when" "Yesss Yes The explosion on our wedding day"
Thank God I don't live in a war torn region.
Whoever or what did this, is in for a "Rude Awakening"...?!?!?!... 😤 😠 😤 😡 😤
That wedding was booming
