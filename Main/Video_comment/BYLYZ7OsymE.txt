"you ready to squeeze off on the man" 1:04 that's gay bruv
فوق العادس💯💯👍
ogni tanto torno a riguardarmi questo trailer ed ogni volta ho la pelle d'oca
They made the dopest trailer for the most disappointing, badly written, horribly executed season they could've produced. I can't understand how they dropped the ball after near perfection  I'll still miss it though
thank god netflix has subtitles otherwise i got no clue what they saying this is why American and aussie english is the best spoken english
Muito bommmm, very very Good... Brasil 🇧🇷 amou, loved... tem que existir mais temporadas mais episódios!! 🙏
Just getting here in 2025. This is one of the grittiest shows in history. Here’s hoping season three is a masterpiece
The trailer is better than the season it’s self. Too rushed/too short
I know this has been over, but when Lauren OD'd...should've known it was over 💔
Wtf they did with jimie dead he was besf character and he get killes by ussless sully which i never liked in series pfff failed plottt shit season 3
What a let down. Only 6 episodes and they wasted them. The last series might have well have been a fever dream and Stefan wakes up at the end. Jamie’s death was the worst decision this show ever made.
Power is better not that top boy ain't
2025 anyone?
this trailer got me..
Hi Netflix i just want to film this series like an actor I live in Italy turin
Jamie was the best thing in that series 😢
The weakest season in my opinion and very rushed 💯🙄 but enjoyed the others 👍👍
Jamie innit😢
Much love from the US for this masterpiece
"Laterz cus." Rafe will always come back for you in the end.
Song name?❤❤
Never food
Interesting how the reason the riot started in Top Boy is the same reason the riot of our time is happening.
Season 3 was some joke ting when netflix took over. It's embarrassing and whoever sold out needs a slap. People need to stop letting our stuff be recycled. 1 and 2 had a real story behind it that most can relate to. The new series is just a joke and fake as fuk
I just started watching the series and I'm on season 2 now, Jaq is sexy as hell lol.
Drinking game: Down a shot whenever anyone in this series says: "Food",  "Wagwan" or "Innit".
Back round music
Song
What s the song of this trailer
I have to say I usually don't watch shows like thos..but can I tell you this was the best series I've watched in years..there was so much power in this series..pain..life lessons..beautifully written..amazing job truly

🔥🔥🔥
I love this track ❤
Background song please ?
Die Serie ist extrem langweilig 80% nur reden 20% action alles wird in die Länge gezogen nur quatschen
Wow this trailer gives me Scarface vibes.  Season was trash tho  very rushed made Dushane look like an idiot.
A show about scumbag losers.  Imagine thinking these types of people are anything but trash lol.
We should have had a cameo from  Neutrino 😂
Netflix fool us  In reality season 3 is season 5 and season 1 is season 3 first season come in 2011 but not in Netflix  Check Wikipedia
If this is how London really is nowadays, god help Britain. What in the world is going on in this once great city where gang violence is normalised and young black men think it’s acceptable to behave like this.

I just finished watching the series finale, and my heart is heavy. "Top Boy" is undeniably a masterpiece, and I'll genuinely miss these unforgettable characters.
This show will always have a place in my heart man. Just watching the trailer gives me the goosebumps i miss this and the last season wasn't even as good as the trailer portrayed it to be
This show just underlines what a hell hole london is
Innit
Song please?
But thats mainly season 5
Top Boy 3 AND Toy Boy 3(Hint).  Where is Toy Boy 3🤔😉(hopefully comin' by Spring/Summer/Fall 2024🤔)
Going into season 3 is tuff😭😭
Hands down the best trailer I’ve ever seen
Melhor série ja feita top boy🔥🇧🇷
American’s will never understand how much of a good representation of London this show is, and that’s why Top Boy is so good, the realism of the drama and events that happens to each character is so accurate. We won’t get another show like this, with this quality of writing, for a very long time.
I grew up on the roads of hackney and lost many friends to Postcode/drug  disputes, either through being killed or commiting murder.   So many deaths over trivial things
The ending is ridiculous. If you know anyone involved in the business, they normally have serious trust issues bordering on paranoia. The idea of him trusting and leaving a little old Irish woman to take care of his finances is ridiculous? They would make sure that they had some kind of leverage on her, so that she could not disappear and run away without repercussions.
Malis 🇸🇴😂 the funniest people in the world
A war is coming between the zt
Feel like they rushed this last season. It was cool, but could have been better. Dushane  deserved better
It’s alright if you can stand the stupid fake accent these London kids talk
I just discovered the new season dropped and everybody saying its bad 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
What a boring season 😂 we spent the time watching black lives matter protests and the rest of the show was about Jaq’s sister being depressed ahaha this was more like the Turkish drama serials then top boy what a shitshow
This season plotted along, after jamie it really didn't have a drive, to be honest this felt like a violent season of Easter enders.
Why 😢😢😢😢😢 Dushane😢😢😢😢Sully!Noooooooo😢😢😢😢
Acting story everything is amazing in this series
I liked the older seasons, this ones shit. Too much 'blud this blud that'.... Its for kids
Thanks for letting Rodri get a red card
'Top Boy' is for UK as 'The Wire' is for US. Go and Watch both now. This Trailer is LIT AF!
They need to redo the last season and trash wharerer this was.
The trailer is much better than the actual season.
worst season of the whole series. what the hell was that
The session feels like the just want to end it the first seasons was real this was like idk
Dead show
All I do is work I’m definitely late lemme tune in tonight after this shower famm
I wish they somehow brought Ranell back in the show
Ending was madddd ❤
Can’t lie I’ve got to ep5 and I’m disappointed bruv. Just felt kind of rushed I understand it’s the last season but cmon
🤔Last season extremely rushed... did the punters dirty with only six epsiodes..
Kano feels so real. Little Simz being a friendly nail parlor girl feels kinda crazy.
Когда же он выйдет???
Personally this show is in my top 5 listen at the end of day do kingpins have a happy ending?
great show
11
The Irish were supposed to be worse than came before. Yet Sully takea them out in few episodes. Season 3 needed 10 episodes and more story. I have to say the people causing a roi5 and Sully and Dushane are chasing each other  Not one cop saw them. Its just bad tv. Season 3 by far American isd
Wow I hate Sully. Great actor but his character is ruthless. Hoping he gets what’s coming!
Sully killed my favorite character in the show 🤦🏾‍♂️
S3 of this show is mediocre at best. While I'm happy they made a season 3, shit could've ended the way it did with ONE more episode rather than six. The ending was fkn fire, but they did us dirty with it only having 6 episodes. Wasted hype
Where is the German version
So if o spoil it in these comments am I wrong ?
Bro its sucks all died
La serie se acabo cuando murió Jamie.
Trailer good season shit
Name Music
The trailer was better than the actual season😂
Trailer was better than the actual season
The fact that they showed Dushane Sully and Jamie at the start shows that only these 3 could ever be the Top Boys. The first 3 were always the best 3
It’s me coming back to watch this trailer over and over after finishing the final season long time ago  Edit: finished this show months ago but I just keep coming back to this trailer. This is how you do a trailer-so impactful
Background song ?
Man this season was terrible. JFC how did they think this was acceptable? What a way to end the show on lol
So sad it's ending
Song choice is goated
This reminds of the walking dead series, grow smarter and stronger from there hard experience and trials or life, just to make dumb ass decisions in the end that leads  to their down fall, which is nothing like the real truths, the third season was a stupid piece of crap
Sully actually looks real scary
anyone know the song playing in the background
Lobe me some Kano 😍😍😍😍😍😍 x
Song??
What's the name of this music in the background
Load of crap
How come I can’t find this on Netflix
"If we're not monsters we're food... and I could never be food" - Sully in a nutshell.
Song?
definitely one of the best shows on netlix if not the best
This season sucked. Jamie was a big lose
Jamie will be missed...this season was trash without him
Im not here to ruin shit. Just a question that has me confused. Jaqs sister and her lover. Is it some poly shit or what mad confused yk
Was a good show loved it
On episode 6 of season 5 and honestly it’s a bit of a letdown
Peace fam... I have enjoyed the entire series starting with Top Boy summerhouse. However I gotta say this last season was trash. They totally rushed it. I'm so disappointed with Netflix and there lousy endings. We waited so long for this last season for it to be disappointing . Wow Netflix. Soooo disappointed Peace fam
Without Jamie and a true villain , this was a complete waste of time. The ending was terrible… no face ? Steph wasted the entire show seeking so called vengeance just to be all talk … didn’t realize how important Jamie was till he was gone
Ranell killed sully waatch 0:17
Jamie innit
For sure at top of recent European Crime Series but still nothing beats Gomorrha. Maybe Netflix should buy license to present it to the US audience.
Damb sully died. How does season 4 continue
Whats the song in the background???
Just finished watching season 3. Top Boy has to be one of my favorite shows of all time
🔥🔥
Does anyone know the name of the music used on this trailer ???
Disappointing , waited thod long for a finale and it wasnt great . Ending is frustrating
Wish this come on tv they need to add some black films on tv n bit off boondocks 💯
One of pure British best, so didn't want it to end, wonder who it is that shot sully guess we will never know, top class acting and script's. 🇬🇧 👊
Diversity
I enjoyed it because I came in with no expectations. I’ve always cared more about the characters experience than some conventional plot line with a big bad boss. If I was then I would just watch Breaking Bad, Snowfall, and Power.
Kids there's more to life than this BS
Watched this trailer after binging the season and it feels like we were finessed! That last season wasn't the one. Felt mad rushed and why was it only 6 episodes?!
Binged it last night. 10/10!
It's so low brow....but acted well.
The 2 biggest gangster in this hole show turned out to be lithe and lizzie,  living like queens on a beach somewhere,  while dishane and sully lie in a grave 😂,
Trailer was better than the season itself 😕
Terrible final season, misleading trailer, budget was seriously cut, woke writers, half the season was about Keiron being deported and how evil the home office is, ESG must’ve funded most of this season.
Dream ending sully buns dushane and stefan bodies sully for big bro❤️❤️❤️
Never heard of this but it popped up on my feed, I read the description. “Grammy winner drake executive produces…” that’s how far I got before deciding, nah.
What song is this ?
To the writers: Yal had Dushane go out bad. The storyline should have been Lizzy working with the Irish link and the obstacles of Sully and Dushane getting it back. The WHOLE LAUREN angle was weak. The whole angle from Curtis to her ODing. Just wack. Yal tried to make Jaq look this hard core stud bt in the end she was just like a typical woman. Emotional, making horrible decisions off her emotions and her not being able to handle her emotions literally caused death and destruction to those directly around her. Sully was the ONLY character that stay true to form from the first Summerhouse episode to the end. He robbed, he killed, he shut, and he stayed loyal to the rules of the road.
the 3rd season was MAD! and the end as always shocking... if u didnt watch it yet, run buv
What's this song called
Why would ya make this last season ya lame
Id say in the top 5 greatest British TV show of all time. Its creepy real world like this exists. Gang and tribal culture.
The trailers are always put together good. And wasn't impressed with series 3 . Somehow I think Du shane is alive.  He's my fave always has been .
No one wins in this life move on people
Wasn’t even good it has a plot like a marvel film boring season 🥱
M83 theme tune with this trailer was bloody amazing...the trailer was better then the series. I wont give anything away in case others aint seen it. But  c'mon only 6 episodes? The writing had no depth, story lines where pointless, acting amazing but writers storyline let them all down. Where was half the cast as well, Aaron for one. I just feel you couldnt be arsed to give this amazing series a send off it deserved. Gutted for what it could have been. Gutted its over, best uk series ever!
The trailer is better than the actual season, alot of hype for a whole lot if nothing
Anyone know the song
🔥🔥🔥
Very disappointing season alot of time waisted stories in the last season. Kano killed it again 💯 hope to see some more in new stuff.
song name?
So damn good.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Boring season..way too much talking  and not enough action. even the action scenes weren't interesting.
Whats the song tho
Who killed sully jaq ?
Bollocks
worst season in top boy
The police release him?!?!?! wtf episode01.s3, what kind of reality are this writer living in, they would have called in the riot police and arrested the whole damn block, this has never worked and will never work, seems top boy has gone woke, what a joke, just make up a fantasy series, you might as welll give dushane a lasergun while u at it
Season 3 was good, but it felt undercasted
Whole season felt like some shit PSA on why gang life is bad about "lauren died from this" such lazy writing and useless plots like  jamies little brother meaningless wasted my time
WORST SEASON SHIT ENDING
Sully is an emotional gangster
Why people excited to watch a bunch of black people represented in a bad light? Bunch of uneducated fools living on an estate selling drugs, robbing people, killing other…. Sad how UK has no standards.
Habrá 4?
Never saw it. Never will. Seems utterly nihilistic
Waited all this time and only 6 episodes?
just finished this series and id recommend Jungle over this, it was like they thought of the scenes over a 5min breakfast - and best they could come up with the Bennie Blanco ting and saying: bait - food - i got you/this and of course "say less fam" every 2mins, maybe 1min...fam. i hope all the actors get something out of this, some great talent.
Maybe the reason there won’t be another top boy is because there will be a top girl… Jaq 🤔
The trailer was better than the entire season they got us too hyped for such a disappointing ending
This is the worst season of this series, I thought the niggas were going to be more entertaing, but unfortunately they weren't
Go Penn State !!! 🇭🇹🔌
I mean it's a decent programme and we'll worth the watch but this "the best shoe on Netflix ever" is an absolute stretch  Sons of anarchy absolutely blows this show out the water, so does sopranos, ozark and many other things  Let's be honest here, as good a stop boy is, it's not even top 20 shows on Netflix
This season was absolute charachter assassination
Okey. Does anybody know the brand of Stefs jacket/hoodie?   I need that!   Thanks!   PS: I think the whole series was awesome.   Love
wAllah billah die staffel 3 müll bis auf die letzte folge
Season 3 ? Who’s smoking ?
worst topboy season by far
who shooting sully??
My man should’ve went to Rwanda 🤣🤣
I’m gonna miss this show, what a great ending.
what a load of shit this was 🤣
Netflix is like Disney. All about ticking boxes and pushing agendas. 0 quality, 0 story, 0 acting, all politics.
this was better than the actual show
I’m the  biggest top boy fan but this series was poor it’s like they rushed it was so slow in parts an unrealistic to.I had a feeling it wasn’t going to be good It just lacked the spark of the last season I still think this is the best uk series ever but series 3 was poor.
Intro song?
SPOILER: After watching it I felt like the season was missing something or I guess the finale didn't tie up enough loose ends. This trailer literally said *NO. LOOSE. ENDS*  smh. Take Lizzie for example. Dushane literally came back from "retirement" cuz she stole his money and we didnt even see her face. Overally I think it was good with a slightly odd ending.
So wait is ranell is season 3 or not or does it at least explain it?
It was trash
How many think the rooftop shooting he let him go? Not shoot him?
stephan should have killed sully man...
I dont believe... K so sad...🇧🇷🇬🇧
Cristale in topboy go onnnnnn she does a track on it plsying as jsmies brothers crew..cristale is a uk drill artist if you know uno
Jack killed sully 💯
Realist show tbh road life only ends with death or jail some people just can’t take the ending ITS AS REAL AS IT GETS
I don't think I was ready for this last season wtf is silly tripping on everyone man
Worst ending In series history. This whole season was ass man. Wtf this whole season finale did make any since. Way  to go for running one of the best series ever. Seriously how are they going to end it like the way it did?
Im gussing sully and dshane die and the weird girl stays alive. Thats how the lgbt propaganda works.
This is  A LIFE TIME CLASSIC
Yea boy
Pense em uma série besta aff só propaganda 😅prometeu tudo e não entregou nada tempo perdido
Where can I watch it for free
What's the name of the song
Is this season 5 or 3 because top guns had 4 season 😅
Who killed sully they can’t end it like that
Accountant makes the house of cards fall 😅needed like four more episodes. This wasnt the strongest season
This season was a let down. They could of done so much more with it. Just like the last season of snowfall
W song
What piece of music is this
just on S3 episode 1 - if they mention immigration or windrush In  episode 2 or any woke shi  - I'm done - all streaming accounts closed....
FFS ... 🙈
What a let down proper disappointed trash season worst of the lot
When Jamie died so did top boy. Shit season
litteraly the worst season ever, so boring
I worked on the set as a medic  I’m so glad I did 🎉
Here after watching season 3 the trailer is pretty much the entire last episode with lines from other episodes oh and btw sully dies by a random at the end and dushane gets done by sully Steph wimped out of offing sully
I’m on episode 5 it’s been so dead worst season yet
I used to hate sully in the previous seasons ..he's my favorite character after completing this new season...i think i know i understand he had to catch all those bodies "You"re either food or a monster "....sully carried this whole season.what a performance
Sully kills dushane and sully gets killed by the irish
We need more seasons for this series
anyone know the song in the background?
Man deshane should of left his ungtateful assss back in south london let them finish him
Anyone else watching it
Man a been bad from day one
lets goooo
Not me on Netflix at midnight waiting for this to drop 😂😂😅😅 shameless...lemme go refresh...maybe its up now 👀👀👀😀😀😀
The only way this can end is with sullys death
Is anybody else waiting to finish this season then watch summerhouse 😂😂😂
interstellar theme tho
what song is this?
bro its not on netflix yet im tryna watch it im sooo gassed
Damn!!! They should have found a way to bring Jamie's character back for the final season, his character was mad and wicked in the best way!
Bala
I just have that feeling dushane is gonna die and sullys gonna just get away from it all
Yes Sir
Anyone got a track ID?
SPOILER I WAS WORKING AS AN EXTRA IN SEASON 3, SULLY WILL DIE YOU ARE WELCOME
I wanted Jamie’ to live
This is going to be epic ….
It makes me sooooo made we have to wait between seasons, but I will say this is most anticipated.  I can't wait😊
Kano and Ashley Walters are living legends man, hope they bring it to a good end. One of my favourite series ever for sure
I should be among the cast of this movie already... please tell the producers about me
Jame
My predictions are Steph is going to M Sully, Dushane is going to get locked up for life and Jaq is going to take the wrap for Curtis' death.
Gonna be Sad asf this
The final boss - Gentrification
Steph shoots Sully in the park 😢
Team Stef
"You ready to squeeze off on the man" bro I cant with uk slang😭😭
Innit❤️
First mi a si this
What’s the music in the background
Letttz Gooo
Im thinking sully/dushane death & or prison for either or... & jaq is gonna be *Top Boy/Girl*
That scar face beat
Gangs of London could have learnt a thing or two from Top boys.
The show can’t end unless they bring back Ra’nell, it’s only right!
The best movie 🎦 ever indeed! 💯 ✊🏽
nice use of M83 for this trailer :)
Nah man i seeit in tha 2022 on polish netflix dont nowwa when season 4
top tier trailer
Clock is ticking ⏰
Why are the ones from summerhouse in the trailer?
So hes dead
True fans know this is season 5 not 3
cok iyi dizi amQ
Im so mad, just saw steph put jamie chain on, it means he really gone 😭😭 thought bro was dreaming
W
@0:55 looks like a white dude throwing the molotov. They going to Northern Ireland?
Dushane is gonna turn snitch..
hope this one to be better than the last one.
Who came here because they heard this music from tiktok
Yeeeees here we go!!!!!!
Season 5
Bout to be a banger 💪🏻
All these people saying it’s a dream and he not dead he is my teacher knows Micheal ward
What's the song used? and where did i hear it before.
Anyone else kinda p*ssed that Jaime was killed off and was hoping he'd kinda be a pass the torch moment as the whole Deshane/Sully thing is getting milked to death?  That kid was the most interesting character since the beginning, and deffo breathed a new life into that season, he was the guy to carry this show forwards for another generation, thats where the Deshane/Sully story needed to end.
I think we know what’s going to happen, after watching this brilliant trailer by the way. We know
Steff Kills Sully. Dushane dies of a heart attack. I tell you the plot in one sentence.
Unrealistic rubbish
Mmmm
Season 5* ifykyk
Its funny because if you point out the fact that all the crime and gang activity in London is committed by these people they will scream "racist" but they also will make movies and TV shows about it
best show XX
looks like its gunna b the best szn ever, stef looks so got w those braids.
Stef gonna smoke Sully… revenge
Real one's know that it all started on Channel 4 hence for the original recap on this trailer
Why don't they just get normal jobs
So the Joker's going to be their new connect / antagonist.
I'm hoping I've glimpsed a Somali character in the mix.  It's the East End... there's loads living there 👍🏿
C’mon🚀😭
I cannot wait to watch this, to me this is season 5
This is one of if not the greatest show ever put together
🎉🎉🎉😮😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👍🏽
Am out here in Nig thinking the thug life in the street are maddd over here bruvv uk nahh that’s way bloodier
Still worshipping and trading off street gangster runnings
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Isn't actually season 5?
What song is this??
This is we’re it ends 🤫
All i know is Jamie better be alive cuz I’m not taking no bs
JAMIE???
Stef should stick to selling hamburgers in school init? It would be terrible for him to get capped in the first episode. Hopefully Aron's done with uni and onto a better things, it would be funny though if Stef did get capped and then Aron would have the villainous arc written in only to die in the second episode.
I'm a Fan of top boy since 2013 and i am 16 So i was 6 since i started Watching it
Bottom peasant
Jesus is lord
🍷🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
are episodes dropping weekly or every episode at once
Does anyone know what song is this ?
Netflix version isn't as gritty as the channel 4 version which is ashame. It's like having rum with ice straight (channel 4)... then Netflix coming along and adding a chaser to the drink with a cocktail stick 😂
Dope!! Sully will get smoked lol
Looking forward to the 5th and final season.  Maybe they will do some spinoffs in the future.
Greatest trailer ever
I'm already crying.  Dam I'm going to miss them
Can't wait
I'm real hyped back here.
🔥🔥
Hope sully gets his ass wrapped
I'm still in my feelings about Jaime dying...I know he was up to some shady stuff, but not in front of his brothers...smh..
What’s the theme tune?
I CANT WAIT!!!
Only show I get truly gassed for at this point moving thirsty for a new episode  😂 who's got the early release?
Johnny is gonna give Dushane n sully hell but like all the other gangs n suppliers they will die
Still..
TrusT me bow bow
U ready to squeeze of i On a man
Top boy s5 gonna be cold Stefan a bad boy

But that road don't end good...sully to stefan 🤔🤔🤨
That guy that said   Are you ready to squeeze of on a man needs to go home asap . Doesn’t even suit him lol 😮😅😅
This SZN is gonna be mad one for sure, there’s gonna be some death to ties up loose ends, a Top boy who’s gonna survive “the game” < Jail or on the Run but it all leads up death eventually, I reckon Lizzie is gonna be on mad one getting help from that new guy who we see with sully in the trailer as there “Irish” as Lizze loved Jamie, Dushane will be going down, Dead or in Jail but I know for a fact summerhouse will turn him against him < the mandem & the community as body’s are continue dropping around him, I can’t wait to see this masterpiece of series to sadly coming to end & hopefully we get sort of some kind of spin off with “Jaq” or “Stefan” becoming the next “top boy” 💯🙌🏻
what’s the name of the song pls?
Poor Jaime :(
i hope jamie doesnt die i really like him :/
yo you ready to squeeze off on the man????
The is NO Top Boy without THE Top Boy
More like season 5
Micheal Wards,  yeah !
WE SLIDEIN FOR JAMIE 😈❤‍🔥
Cant wait❤️❤️❤️
Jamie should not be died one off best actor in the film
STEPH’S COOKIN
I hate when the cut an amazing show..
Thank god, took forever..
This is making out that fuckin ass passion ass
This is season 5
Its so dissapointing to see these people people reduce themselves to this, which is a further emphasis on an existing stereotype..I send prayers for their self reflection and move towards the wholesome path. Amen 🙏🏽
Cant wait to see this 😬
The best TV show ever...The only bad news is that it will be the last season :(
Letsss goooo🔥🔥🔥🔥
stay tuned !
Let’s go!!
Honestly think Top Boy beats the wire. Seems a lot more authentic to me ✊🏼 can’t wait for season 3 or 5 I should say
SOOOOOOOOO READY!!! This my show 4show!
The show has great antagonists. Jamies story made sense thematically,  but Curtis and Modie were wasted. Great show
Just rewatched first summerhouse and top boy 2 seasons for the 3rd time… can’t wait for this to be out
Mamma mia che toppppppppp
FINALLY ❤
Wait where's Aron...?
watch top boy summer house then watch top boy
The best Netflix series period. No other has had me binging like this one besides Sweden's own "Snabba Cash".
Dudley & Barry Keagan, Nah Top Boy is setting Levels for UK TV. straight to number one
Yes to the yes
They gassed it with the song
Wag Wag my G ! Save bro!
baba geliyo
Vcç
Season 5..!
5star
I just saw a quote about it being the best show to come from our little country; it’s bigger than that, it has touched generations, opened eyes to poverty, survival and the need to find your way, whichever that way may take you. It will and is and always be totally iconic.
"Ello Guvna, me heata goes pish posh. Sully gotta die innit".... or however tough guys talk in the UK........ I'm very exci'ed bruv.
Good to see Barry Keoghan involved,Great actor.
Yea baby im waiting👍🏻🥹
BRO I’M GASSED!
Anyone else find it rly hard to understand what they were actually saying in the trailer ? 🤔
this is gonna be huge
L movie cuz jamie died fam
IS THIS REAL?!?!?!?!? FINALLY!!!!!!!
I hope Jamie ain’t dead coz he was main character material
Im so excited.
why am i seeing jamie then😂 he got brucked in the head 😭
Finally… long overdue
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Song?
The Irish boys gonna shake things up! Cant wait love the show 😍😍👌👌
Crazy talent in this show! The OG seasons were elite quality, but they upped it even further when they brought it back to life on Netflix!
Was that Dris's daughter Erin in the car with Steph?
No please don’t  tell me it’s the last chapter 🥲
Cant lie i believe that Ra’nell is in the new trailer of Top boy: final season because I’ve watched an interview on the actual actor & he sounds exactly the same as the one at the end of the trailer talking to dushane, also text appears saying “NO LOOSE ENDS” but if you remember sully killed Leon in top boy summerhouse, so it would make sense for ra’nell too appear because no mention of his character was brought up during the time of the new top release, he even said “I know what your on, but that road don’t end good” if it was another important character, they would have been shown and realistic the person alive who knows deshaun the best would be him after sully cause dris isn’t alive anymore
you know it’s real when dushane and sully got bulletproof vest on cux they ain’t NEVER wore that shit in none of the 4 seasons before this ! shits bout to be mad
They fckn milked Jamie 🤦🏾‍♂️ summer house started wit sully and deshane but Top Boy started with Jamie I wanted bro to survive I hope he make a comeback 🙏🏽
Jamie really needed to be here🥺🥺
Wagwan
Can't wait
Man can’t have another season without Jaimie
Masterpiece
Wokism
truely legendary series're eventually coming
Ooohhhh yeaaaa
I felt "one day that bruddas gonna get what's coming to him" in my soul...
0:41-0:44 then 1:25 tell me Stef gonna pop Sully in that park it would be gangsta af if that's the park him and his brothers was at last season
I Still Think Dris Is Alive.. Pop Up Appearance Would Be 🔥🔥
Musti from Baiteze yeah 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Stef vai se vingar da m0rte do irmão Jamie, ultima temporada vai ser f0da 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro where’s this song from
is jamies youngest brother running endz is sread of jamie
Remember when people came up with theories that Ranell was Modie 😂
This final season is not gone be the same without Jamie he was the star of the show! smh
LOOKS GOOD
you need to watch top boy summerhouse first !!!!
Pike 🎉🎉
Based on the younger days of Andrew tate
Top boy would never be the same without jamie
Season 5 let’s go !!!!
Song playing in background?
Get a job
What separates British crime movies and TV series are cinematography, attention to detail, and character development.
Can't leave it be.  TB is done.....move on...
Top Boy summerhouse
Say less
The truth is back!
Barry Keoghan in the cut tho
About time
Ready to what off on a man!? Ayooo pause
CRISTALE GOING MAINSTREAM MAINSTREAM🔥🔥
This show made in the image of "the wire" it's decent, but it's definitely not at the level of the wire not even close. Jacqueline is such a water down version of Snoop. All in all I like top boy a lot. But if you don't know recognize it's just the wire in England but not as well executed. I don't know what to tell ya.
lets go
1:08 is that stef with the gun
Perpetuating a stereotype. Rasisms.
The characters in this make me laugh, they all look soft, british boys are never this organised
Goosebumps
Goosebumps
P'd they killed off Jamie.  Sully has to go.
Proper shit
Jesus Is The Way The Truth And The Life Amen 🙏
jaram sie w chuj pozdro
This is evidence of the real thug life
Only show that rivals this kind of style is Mocro maffia Holland check it out
Great show but probably never going to prioritize watching since they killed off Jamie. His character brought much needed relatable youth.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
thank you Drake 😂🤣😂🤣
Best ever.
seen this last night and wow its a load of shlt .
Who else watched more than once 😅
Where is the food bro
I haye sully
lfg best series ever!!
gripping tv show 10/10
🔥🥳
Did he get time or suspension from the sexual assault he was accused of?
Can't wait🔥
Ra’nell returns , he’s a pro football player,doesn’t want to get dragged back
U ready to squeeze on the man  😢
❤
Jamie’s dead, not watching it smh
We want VINCENT back!!
The background music in this trailer is straight out of an instagram reel 😂
That sound like Jamie around 1:34
I'm still sick about the ending of season 2
Cmon now 💯💪
🇯🇲
Im a bottom boy 😉
Biggest crime in history that this is the last season.
M83 - Solitude 🫡
is jamie really dead😢
Whatever happened to raffe the mad man 😂
Jamie we miss u!!! Sully gotta pay!
I don’t even wanna watch it that Jamie’s not in it the end of season 2 was so dumb
Berp, Berp.. Init
The name "Top Boy" is wild😂😂😂😂
This is gonna be insane
Man I love this series. Something about British gangsters that’s so captivating
Just rewatched the whole thing again summerhouse and top boy. I am so ready for this
jamie not coming back?
Been waiting since the beginning!!!😅
the soundtrack made it 10x better
first time i got the chills for a long time this about to be a good season because we know steph is coming for suly
I'm very excited for Season 5 of Top Boy  Dushane is the true top G
Can't wait!!!
I miss Jamie alr💀
Bro i watch anime most times and i cant wait for this to drop am so excited bro
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
what is the background song here? incredibly breathtaking
This isn't season 3
Jamie dead???
No way!!!!!!!! Sick😊
From the beginning I related to Sully because of his hurt. He never took pleasure in hurting but it wasn't hard for him either. Now with Jamie gone and Steph essetially becoming a pain clone of Sully I can see just how crazy pain cycles are. Sad that him and Dushane keep ending up at odds with one another, but again, life does that. Especially that life. Let's see how this goes. Keen.
so hyped!!!!
STEF COMIN TO THE ROADS NOW
failed society.
Hope you boys are free on 7
Когда подумал что это трейлер пацанов , просто ошиблись с цифрой сезона 🥴
dont joking, its my favorite series of all time
Sully gotta go. I'm sorry
Maybe it aslo seems her fan's love GOD more, also has 2 do with her basically pledging her allegiance to satan
This is the from Top Boy?
They killed Jaime and I was devastated I’m definitely waiting on season 3.
Sully dead
Billionaire Bears 🥲

Serie foda  🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Jamie 😢
this aint 3 this 5, SUMMERHOUSE
Omggggggggggg
Wow 😮
Cool
I still cant get over from Jamies death
It’s amazing how they were able to keep the main characters together even after being cancelled. This series is one my top 5 series. Right there with The Wire!
We need Jamie to be a live there's no topboy without him😢
It’s not the same anymore I like 1st one only
The joint and I watched since day 1. Official
🔥
No cap season 5 going hit different iykyk
Athena vibes?
"10 years " it was made in 2011 netflix it's 2023 ... that makes it 12 years xD can you guys even count ? xD
ooh snap !!! talk about a NICE FKN surpise !!!!!! cant wait !!!!!
If we had balance in the programming, like a black uk sitcom, a good quiz show, some educational stuff etc... well written with good budgets... that would be cool. How comes it's only possible to spend money when it's to promote these depictions of black life and illuminate this to the masses who then believe these stereotyped characters. With the amount of knife crimes and drug use in the UK and USA in black communities, this serves to further promote that lifestyle and I say well done, credit where credit is due, to the program makers fir their understanding of the power of manipulation through politics and media👏👏👏👏 There are many people who don't read, question or think about the long game who fall for this form of crap as entertainment.
King of series
*season5
Wow. Shout out to drake
Yes it's back
This show is the reason eshays exist
Mad Things ✌️
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾

Best Series of all time ,I've seen the whole series repeatedly I've been waiting on this . Just sad to know it'll be ending it's what I look forward to on Netflix
WHERR IS ATTIKA WHERE IS MA SON!!!
Top Boy for live 🤘🏾
Kano is a Bad Ass and should be in more roles
Calling out of work 4 this.

I love Top Boy 😍!!!! And just want to see how the story of the show plays out. Feeling all the thrills, chills and angst that it is going to have, I’m excited but not ready. 🤦🏾‍♀️ I love all the characters in the show so much, the “good”, bad and the ugly 🤩This is one one of the best series I’ve seen of it’s kind since The Wire.  Also my other favorite is Gangs of London 😳.
😁
Can’t wait 💃🏼💃🏼
Yo why is jamies brother working with someone formally zts but now under dushanes crew even tho someone else frm dushanes crew killed jamie
Will resub to netflix just for this show! Lets gooooooooo
Jamie was beautiful that was it!
defo gunna be an episode about how the police are racist when the African community in London take no responsibility for anything...
For whoever put this trailer together - this is a total work of art and you're a genius! Great work!
bruv im getting excited for this one
Kano is so underrated

Screaming yessssssssss been waiting so long
noooooooooooooooo the final chapter? WHY????!!! how will i survive without this show. It was the best thing after peaky blinders
Is that Barry Keoghan?
No Jamie is gonna be hard
Sully speaking at the end is Steph holding a gun to him and him telling him going down this road of revenge won’t stop and he’ll end up like him and his brother watch😊
Great show! looking forward to downloading this as soon as it comes out!
Goooo go wagwan bruv
Bring back ramel
The get back for Jamie gone hit like crack in the 80s
We gonna see Ranell return ?
He better get back 😢 sullyk
Feel like they misjudged with how they handled Jamie's character arc and missed a golden opportunity to retire sully and dushane
Its not cool to be a thug and a bully, cool is being a good soul, raising a family and respecting the law. Thugs can kiss my law abiding balls.
I NEED IT NOW!!!!@!!!!!!
Love This😊
Everything comes full circle now
YESSSSS
can’t wait init
Can’t wait for everyone to think there a roadman for 6 months. The fake gucci bags are coming out
Aaron still studying for finals
Since Jamie is gone, I want Deshaun to make it out alive. Originally, I wanted them both to make it. Sully has always irritated me so whatever. I’m not looking forward to Stef’s revenge but if he does, I hope it’s pointed towards Sully & not Deshuan.
What's the name of the song ?
This show some dogsh't 😂
Maaaad fam  ,i love this show and all of it's seasons❤ lets goo
His little brothers coming back
Kanos a real gully badman. Man said u can’t drop a season that involves my character getting dropped

Great show. Keep promoting the culture of violence in the black community. No positive images or strong role models needs. Good job Netflix.
Sully still sliding solo
Cant wait!!!!!!!
Best Netflix show OAT..
I did not know about channel 4?? I am not from the UK. Is it possible to watch it back somewhere? I heard that Topboy started over there. 🤷🏾‍♂️

Endlich der dritte Teil
Wtf ten yrs 3 seasons something is wrong
Finally 🙌🏾
Whew baby!
finally!
I was hoping they’d bring Ra’Nell back and have him team up with Stefan. The person to guide his anger. He hears about what happened and wants to help him. Dushane respected him as a child so that angle would’ve been crazy
Sully dies calling it
LETS GOOOOO
I dead forgot michaela Coel was in The Summer house series
Jaime lil bro taking the throne

IM SO HYPE. lets goooooo
Lego Still pissed about last season ending  they better deliver it's personal 😒
Sounds like I gotta watch the previous 2 seaons again in time for this.
Kano needs to get out of the UK, wasted talent.
I knew Steph was gonna turn to the streets, There was no way he was gonna let Jamie get taken out like that, I wonder what happens to Aaron though.  Kano is different class not only as a musician but as an actor too!
can't absolutely wait, so sad to read 'final season'
Yessssss
The most realistic series i have every watched! Sad it's the last one. Its been incredible!
Sure this series will have a mind blowing ending. Some of the best acting and writing ever in a British drama.
Never seen this show is it good ?
Damn Gates azz cheeks 😂😂😂 but this was a good game
Counting down the days
so ready
Steph is about to get on a war path and it’s understood
Hold on I'd the boy from season,top boy summer house, there tho
Wag on my niggas
can't wait to see how it all ends 🔥🔥👌
Rip my boy Jamie man I hope lil bro turns up and get that get back for his bro
It ain’t the same without Jamie dawg
I’ve watched this like 10+ times even on slow mo jus to see any hints or predict how it’s gonna start!
i cannot fooking wait....
Started watching this series because of Marco from Blue Story.
Top boy is shit
The end will satisfy some and leave others disappointed. Such is life!!  I KNOW WHAT ROAD YOU'RE ON, BUT THAT DON'T END GOOD.
I know what you're on, BUT THAT ROAD DON'T END GOOD.
Season 3 ? Wayment
Americans do their series better than us. Snowfall, Power, BMF. Top Boy doesn't even come close but I'll watch since it's filmed in the ends
So many kids watch this and think its cool then replicate it and die or go prison. We really need to think of what type of people we glorify as its effecting the kids if you haven't noticed...
Jamie should of survive that hit honestly smh
🗣️About f🤬kn timeeeee!!! Let’s goooooooooo
Damn Brodie
All good things must come to an end 😢
Classic & Legendary Seasons 🥂
Steph bout to be on demon time
I will be watching this off my fire stick
they should have kept the scouser in he was top
Can’t wait! I heard Kano walked off set when asked to do something he didn’t agree was in character so I hope nothing silly has happened.
Man i love this show!!!!!
How can it be season 3 when there are already 4 seasons of Top Boy🤷‍♀
Another overrated netflix how 👏
So funny how many of y’all haven’t even watched the first two seasons this is season 5💀
Payback tor Jamie
They can’t bring my ninja Jamie back 😤 Sully gotta get it
I better se steph go fully in on everyone
This is not season 3
Get the food
Let them motherfuckers all die jamie is the top boy
Ooooooo when
N it drops during Virgo season come on now ♍️♍️♍️♍️♍️♍️♍️🖤
OMGGGGGGGGGG😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 big fan from US I watched every season I deadass real life love this show
jamie brother hopped in his place like u knew he would to get revenge for his brother
Bring back Ra’Nell
“STEF”   Spin off would be $$$ did me let me write it   Jaime plays pivotal role in stefs villain development  Sully is the culprit to the empire demise i imagine in the final season  The trailer looks good but could have been better  Where’s Aaron the middle brother??  Stef needs a dark dark side like bipolar schizophrenia or something that we didn’t see coming developed from the trauma
finallyyyyyy
Jamie init
Kano’s acting has been top tier in this show. 👌
Finally mandem
I hope Sully survives, lets not pretend Jamie was a good guy.
When you know something gonna end, but you put hella soul thru strife, the outcome will be victorious either way.  "heard in a pub east of the river"
👑👑👑🇿🇦
You got Barry Keoghan in this? Exciting 😎
Chaantelle and ranell returning i hope
Steph goin ham this season
This is season 5 but two of the seasons are like different   angles of the hood example tokyo drift fast and furious same shit
So Steph joins Summerhouse and now Sully's telling Dushane that he has no choice but to rely on him?
Best series on Netflix
Goosebumpssss
OMG THE MUSIC 100000/10
My year has been made😭
Yes finally man dem ready eno
This the last season innit😢
Is that Steph and Tia at 1:13?
Looking mad
This show is a piece of art! The trailer is already making me excited....cant wait. Top boy is underrated and deserves all the best. 🏆
The best uk show is back as an American too hype right now
Bro this is literally hands down, one of the best series in 10 plus years!
I'm sad that it's the last season man
bruh they killed of the best character of the show, who the f wanna watcht this shit now
This is will be very emotional 💪🏾💪🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!
power is better
I cant wait.
This one’s looking serious 👀
A Melhor série dessa plataforma !! 😱
They done tun stef into demon 😢
Season 3 seems to be too heavily influenced by Athena.
WE NEED ANDREW TATE ON THE NEXT SEASON SO WE CAN CALL IT ‘TOP G’ INSTEAD OF TOP BOY 😂
Omg I love it!!!
👀🍿
pls don’t make this the last season shit is better then half the shows on Netflix summerhouse was a banger also
Crap more drugs and violence.
Bro Stephan better have his get back for Jamie no mf bap
I said ages ago, I hope Darnel comes back,  he and Stef could link up for revenge ...
Excited ! But scared to be disappointed. But I know it’s going to be 🔥.
I thought Jamie died
Steffffff
Whats the name of the soundtrack? Any one  know" ?
That’s how you promote a finale! Recap from S1 and no bait spoilers of what’s to come. Most trailers you can predict “ah yeah this is gonna happen” wasn’t able to say that here. 👍🏾
Finally
what is the name of the song in trailer?
Song name?
Literally chills
What’s the song playing ?
Thank you Drake
Sully gonna die. Dushane gonna have a heart attack and jaq gonna be the top boy. Agree or no
Wagwan
The fact that this is the last season pisses me off
can’t wait for this new season
LET'S GOOOOO! ❤❤❤
Nothing will ever come close to season 1-2 i couldnt watch past the first 2 seasons with the forced bad man ting
Why y’all killed Jamie!!!!!!!!
Ready
Boo I thought this said the boys lol should’ve known on Netflix
Im just mad that Jamie wont be around to the end😡
Without Jamie?
Team stefan
steffs acting is gonna have to be brilliant for this story line
Actually got goosebumps
The show was good when it showed what happens on the streets in UK, the last season was so boring
steph wearing jamies chain is so good
Gives goosebumps ♨️
Micheals back no fkin way
waiting for this for a whole year
Let's not forget this was only possible thanks to Drake, without him we wouldn't be getting this. One of the greatest series.
Spoiler pls😊
song name please?\
this shi comin out on my birthday this finna be a hella good day
As an American I had no idea about the road life in the UK until my brother moved to Birmingham from NYC in 2001. It was pure chaos. This show is such a gem to watch
Looks terrible
Gayyyyyy
top boy without jamie hits different
Is Jamie gonna survive 🤔
Omg cant fecking wait 🎉final season 😔
I just want them to properly acknowledge the first 2 seasons of top boy
With that show. Netflix will make the black community more voilent.
Fantastic show! From its inception till now.
I know y’all saw Stefan with the hoodie!?!! Brodie bout to ride for Jamie !!!!
Looks unreal
Jony boy revenge
Something in me was hopin Jamie took a shot to the dome (pause) and survived. But his lil bro being on demon time might suffice
They're both gonna die I'm calling it
Hopefully Jamie Comes back and kills  the guy who shot him
Me still waiting for Ra’Nell coming back
How do they always make it look so corny 🤣🤣 “you ready to squeeze off on a man” 🥴🥴
icl i was secretly hoping jamie was still alive somehow and there be a hint at the end
Даже в сериал про грязь и банды запехнули лгбт
Omg I’m so excited
Where are the Albanians???!
If sully gets killed I’ll never watch tv again
Lesss fuckin gooo🗣️💯💯💯
I can't wait to see how Steph's revenge arc plays out
I really hope they dont do the crime doesnt pay trope
Yesssss!!!!
looks trash
How Steph starting his thanos arc but only 1 season. Need another 4 seasons to see that story done properly. If they end it with a child popping sully then the show is going in the hall of shit
netfkix u suck nowadays
Break bad beats it
Finally. I'm disappointed you killed the hero man
Here we go
You know him as Sully, we know him as Kano. We are not the same.
Seems so sad this is the end what a show
one of the few shows that changed my vocabulary. sayin innit, still, and im not even from the UK lmao
VAMOOO vrada
Can’t wait
❤
sheeshh🔥🔥🔥
I hope Sully is the last man standing
steph villain arc incoming
Best series !🤝🔥
Should’ve never have brought it back. The first 2 were golden
this looks well sick
Pray for cornrow Steph
Ahhh the wait is over!! I hope stef doesn’t repeat the cycle and life of his brother despite him being killed. I hope he gets out of the trap/sunken place and betters himself. I hope that’s the ending to this show.
I’ve got such a sick theory, what happens if Jamie was actually shot and killed by sully. Steph plans to find out sully as he’s worked with the gang before in previous seasons. As see. In trailer Sully and Dushane argue so when Suply is on his one’s Steph and the mandem jump him and he’s dead. Then Dushane gets oissed cos he let his boy die after not watching his back from a typical argument which shouldn’t have happened. Too boy then finishes as Dushane says it’s too risky in these streets and retires.
Les acteurs les plus importants sont mort la saison 3 sert à plus rien
Love top boy but that trailer was poor
Unfortunately it's the last season. This show is up there with breaking bad, game of thrones, sopranos. It's not often you get a TV series that grasps your attention.
What about Jamie’s other brother , I hope he’s still in it and gets revenge too!
It’s gunna be a banger
Noooo final chapter cry😢
sully the real top boy
What’s up with the TikTok sounds tho💀🙏
Weirdly rooting for stef even tho sully is a day one fav, this is about to go so hard boys
Woke shit
We want less americanised cringe and more nitty gritty dirty true face of London
THANK YOU! BEEN WAITING A WHILE.......
about time for season 3 (5) netflix is ​​dead without this one. top boy eats up american crime movies,series
As a day one of Top Boy Fan I know this is going to be epic
May Allah protect children from this show.
song name?
holy shiiiiiiiiiiiiiit '
SKINNNNNY BAAAAAAAADY
Ces acteurs sentent la rue ! Une des meilleures séries !
I fort the story line with Jack's sister ended. What she do now 😂
Hopefully it's better than last season fingers crossed looks promising
Everything that’s wrong with London today
Ruinner kamrmly comes back he’s not dead
Is that crystale aswell? She prolly be a crazy actor , her drill vibes are litt aswell. Hyped!
Oh yes I’ve been waiting for this one
I don't understand didn't I just watch a season,.is this new new ?
10 years on there's no other show like top boy??? bruh, Gangs of London made Top boy look mediocre, I love the show but don't gas it like that.
Song name?
I watched up to Season 3 already' Is this Season 5.
Absolute garbage for poor people .
Man like doo-shane. Do you respect sugar???
Top Boy Season 5 cannot wait
“You ready to squeeze off on a man” ayoooo Pause
Dead trailer
Damm no Jamie 😫
I can't believe they used this song, i'm so happy.
THE BEST OF THE BEST COMING BACK!!!!!!!
Song?
People really think Jamie is the main character 😂
R.i.p Jamie . Do it for your brother Steph and all da mandem 💯
Time to start from the beginning again
They even got Barry Keoghan @ 1:00 minute mark I remember him from Dunkirk
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Song name ?
NETFLIX is on fire!
Ah shi this is about to be lit though cuzzyyyyyyyyy
Sully is gonna have Steph at gunpoint then Aaron is gonna pop sully out of nowhere
😢
I’m happy it’s coming to an end I hate it now they killed my fav character
I had to see you go 😩
How many seasons top boy got I thought they already branch out season 3
Yooooooooo
"NO LOOSE ENDS" yanno.. look forward to this chapter now!
Can’t wait man, that last season finale had me shook. Shit is about to get real innit 🤣
End of season 2 messed me up. Didn’t think I was capable of being invested in a character like that anymore 😭
PLEASEEEEEE BRING BACK RANELLE
Why did they show Jackie’s sister with the baby? Like why are they wasting screen time with that stuff. I hope they brought a new element into the story, not just Stefan versus Kano, if so, they can do a surprise twist ending. Maybe we’ll see a new crew appear, or a new player from Spain or Morocco or maybe Holland or Ireland.
❤❤❤❤ Nomaa Kila kitu yangu inna zidii kutokaa ila ❤
Happy its back cant wait ❤
Let’s goooo
Classic British television
I’m having goosebumps watching this right now 😂❤
like what ending😭
YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
one of the greatest series of all time
Finally.
TALK TO ME NICEEEE
STEF FINNA STEP UPPpppppp
Sully ain’t getting clipped, man forgave Jamie and gave him one last chance.   And he still did him dirty, sully plays by the rules, that’s why he always end up on top

SULLY FI BLOODCLATT DEADDDD
hyped
1:03 all baiteze  fans gather here for Musti Skinny Bade🔥
About time
I think Jamie was a key part in this series, I really hope his death don’t affect the outcome of this season
can defiantly see dushane getting killed
Just noticed Stef and Dris’ daughter together 😭
Bro can’t wait for season 3 mann!!!
Uk cats are the biggest culture vultures after Canadians
cmon
I am so confused, how comes it says “season 3” and not season 5 ?
See my girl likkle Simz! Can’t wait
Goosebumps, also bring ra’nell back
Better serie❤
Still hate how Michael got killed
Sometimes I feel they’re not even acting, just acting out what they experienced.
My bwoi grew up with the braids ready to take revenge mad let's gooo
M83 always great
My show !!!! Wa gwaan bruv!! Manz need dis food enuh!! 💥💥💥🇰🇳
STEFANNNNN
This trailer looks shit ngl
for everyone who thought that Jamie had a chance to survive or the people who have been saying that Sully killing Jamie was a dream. This confirms Jamie is dead.
Name of the song for the trailer
Sully is gonna get smoked
snowfall is better than this
Top boys rivals are coming soon..  And these manz aint playing..  Watch this space..😎
One of the best series ever
I rock with Dushane and Sully but damn I want steff to get his get back 😂
1:21 this cilp is Sully and think about it they did show this cilp in the Top Boy Teaser of S3/5
show is good
sounds like dushane was talking to Stef with that last line
Weak
Finally!!!
Did you guy not see am seeing Jamie is in the thriller
He'll yea I has no idea live this show from the IE
This will just inspire more 12 year old to carry knifes and wanna be idiots
nah this can't be the final chapter still thats a mad ting
Where are the alboz fam
Gangs of london is better this is a kiddi drama lol
It looks like its set up for revenge for Jamie
Season 5 finally
Actually season 5, And the first  two seasons were the best ones 😂
They’ve finally got their payday from Netflix. They must be getting double figures in the million each for this season.
What's name of this song please!!
Cant wait  Probably one of the best series on Netflix to my opinion
If ra'nells not in this season, imma be pissed
I hope jamie dying was fake fr
Madd!!
holy shit
Goosebumps, can’t wait
Hyped!
I need that get back for Jamie
They got Barry Keoghan?? Damn! I'm so ready for this.
I know someone gonna have to lose but I just hope it doesn't give us a sad ending like it did in snowfall.
Omg dis best be real lol
Who’s watching every episode soon as it t hits
Jus plz have more than 8 episodes and I’ll Be happy! No one gonna talk about Aaron not being in the trailer!
ok but Jaime is not really dead right? cope? maybe?!
Hmm wat is this about
Jheeeeeeez ❤
what is that song?
It’s good serie ?
Stef is about to rain the fires of hell on sully. That kid has had so much pain and anger bottled up for years and sully definitely has pushed him over the edge when he killed Jamie in cold blood right in front of Stefan and Aaron.
Didn't know the Keoghan fella was in it. Thats mad
What’s the song
This is gonna be lit
Finally
the last season will take some topping, but this is promising
This could've been THE UK WIRE but 🤷🏾‍♀️ Yes Man Bring Back Renz 🎉
Apparently Kano turns super grass
That Guy who was choosing this song for this trailer is definetley a Sigma! <3
Pathetic
Netflix sales gonna be up lool
😮😮 je suis choqué ça va être une dinguerie cet série
Ride outs for jamie
i met the mc next to my school
Bet one of them die hope it’s not sully like . Top show
STEFF SELLING DRUGS 😢😮
whos dying sully or dushane thats the question. It will happen sadly
The best UK series
🔥🎬🔥
Season 3 😂😂😂 just because some yanks took over to fund it
Long Live young Jamie
This final season will be the best top boy yet. Does Dushan and Sully team up one last time or do they go against each other. There can only be one TOP BOY
Jamie still I life 🙄🙄🙄
“Squeeze off ona man” is a WHYYYYYY
I hope this won't glorify crime because we got enough of that.
Ranell !!
Song??
RIP JAMIE
I’ll never forget the first season back in October 2011 when they had a new episode every week of the mid term break. Had a long hiatus but my god it came back with a bang in 2019. Buzzing for the final chapter
Criminally underrated series 🔥❤
wag11111111111
Man I’m so hyped ❤
Whoever put this trailer together needs a raise. Can't wait for this!
R.I.P Jamie
Jacs carried last season. I hope this one is better and goes out with a bang
when sept 7th is here put your phone on DND for everyone this gonna be a movie 🔥🍿 enjoy !!
Sully is one of my favorite character but icl I hope he gets what he deserves this season 😂
1,:04 that musti from baiteze?
leshgoooo
They got rid of modie way to eary
Hopefully they release the whole thing day one and not in 2 parts 😒
I always relapsed on Top Boy,it’s  like having a particular sweet tooth for a certain dessert.❤️👊🏽
No Jimmie no Fun
The moment sully burnt jamie and left his brothers alive after seeing it, I knew the way sullys story would end. 🩸🩸❌❌
Kano the best actor in this series by a mile
no jamie pretty much ruins the season
I just want ra’nell  to return ngl
IM SO HYPED
no wayyy
its over...
Where’s ranell
MAN...… My Guys back let's go! I knew lil bro was going to be a problem though after doing Jamie like that smh.. Sheesh
damn can’t wait
Damn... Cristale on it too, this last season gonna be sick
Where’s Jamie fam??  And why final chapter?? 😢😢😢
I really wanted to how Dushane escaped the Albanians but judging by the trailer, it looks like that story wont be covered..
I think they will all die just to show you there is no haopy ending in that life
Shit will be wack without Jamie
I’m terrified of Steph becoming Jamie
Song ?
Steph & Ats mum are the only 2 i feel bad for. I never liked Aaron 😂
This show is 🔥🔥🔥
Snowfall still better 😂😂
Finally
September 7th it's craxkin
Gonna binge this and talk like a road man all week
YESSSSSSSSSs
Yall needa reincarnate jamie or sum
Jamie still the Top Boy, can't change my mind
still sick about jamie
More black negativity 🗡   Garbage...
Anyone like me who thought "The boys: season 3"
I gotta re watch everything now then lol
Bets show on Netflix history for sure I still am mad they took out Jamie he was my favorite guy he made the show better
I need the music for this trailer man
Sully gotta die!
Season 5*
Back in secondary school, I was bus stop boy...
yes
can't wait.
I don't care what happens as long as Sully survives.
Season 5 😢
Man I'm waiting for this. They were well overdue for season 2.
Sully gotta go. Too comfortable where he at.
they wasn't wrong stefan becoming the next top boy
STeph about to let that chopper sanggg
F SULLY
Jamie’s not gonna die I’m hoping
the best show on netflix is breaking bad dont disrespect that esquire u mugs
Called it at the end of last season, and sticking to my theory now - last episode will come down to D and Sully.  I reckon Sully kills him and goes lone wolf.
My goodness I can't wait. The UK don't always turn up but when they do? They make I solid statement
Kano in april
Here for stef villian arc and revenge agrhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I'm hyped
again the British media don’t give this show the credit it deserves… best British drama iv seen in a long time with great performances …
You think they will bless a Drake feature on the final season ?
Yoooo 🔥🔥🔥 I Know Steph Gonna Step Up, But Bring Jamie Bacc!!! And Bring Another Top Boy After!!! This Show Must Not End
Jamie Innit
Ranell gonna be back
Ah top boy, the new woke unrealistic soap opera just like that cringe power ghost book
Can not wait blood !
Bro wtf🔥🔥🔥🔥
The fact they put "The final chapter" in the end shows that this is NOT the end of Top Boy. It's just the end of this chapter of the book.
Finally
We need Jamie back fam
Was that Ranell 👀
FIRE
Pounds
Imagine Stephan ends up on top
Can't wait. Been watching these guys over 20 years from lord of the 🎤 days from rappers to big time actors they came along way.
Yeah. I think Jamie is dead.
So sad to see this series end! But well done production
Gave me cold shivers just watching g the trailer can't wait so sad it's the final season
Steph bouta avenge his brother death
Can’t wait tbh 😮‍💨
Usa love us on this show London!! Stand up!!
I don't wanna hear no furthermores, please.
LESSS GOO
Yeah sully a deadman
my predictions:  dushane dies of a heart attack or sully deads him stef kills sully or sully kills stef jaq fucks up and gets arrested or killed kieron gets the L plate  ra'nell comes back sully kills si  if sully dont die he either gets arrested or makes it out  shelley has dushanes kid lauryn commits after she killed curtis aaron becomes successful and gets rich
I rocking with steph full 💯
Where is Dave?
This looks mad still it might be the best one
Sully walking alone in the park, Steff is behind him… 0:44 1:24
All of a sudden there are police in London, they didn't exist in first 2 seasons
dont call me september 7
Sully the goat
When’s it out
if you watch this shit youre prob a gangster wannabe, get a life stupids mfs
Modi coming back
So we just supposed to go on without Jamie?
steph bouta be on anitok edits
Crazy
finally, let's go🔥🔥🔥
🎉🎉🎉 Top boy
Everyone acting like pebbles after one episode of top boy
I need Steph to get his kick back
RIP Driss. All he wanted to do was shot food and look after his daughter 😢
Name of the song?
Song name?
I think sully is gonna get what was coming to him
I wonder what the significance of the flashbacks of s1/2 summerhouse characters were? I feel like that was done on purpose
What song is this
Lorans script: cry, cry and cry some more
Wonder if they will release every episode from the get go or provide it weekly ?
BEST MOVIE EVER IF DONT AGREE GO AGURE WITH YOUR FOREFATHERS
anyone else think that u can hear jamie say to dushane but that road don’t end good
Idk how y’all feel U.K but I’m tired of watching hyper intelligent black men use said intelligence to sell drugs or to be a kingpin. It’s getting annoying I get it gotta finish what y’all started but can we start leaning off that common trope plz. Snowfall, power, BMF, top boy it’s literally all the same toxic shit. We have better and more diverse black stories to tell y’all. Not a hater just getting black drug dealer fatigue. Just saying
I bet sulky gets drilled on this time
Did i just see skinny bawdyyyy??? Musti yknaaa🤣🤣🤣
Funny how the last season they said they wanted to try and highlight the problem with police harassment yet they’re all playing drug dealing criminals.... Stupid
Ey yo, the mandem is back
Am hoping sully finally went on holiday
Is Paul in it ..?
Goosebumps. Not ready for it to  end 😢
Can’t believe drake revived this series
Can not wait. 🔥🔥   Best show ever made.. 💯
Too American for me still keep it realistic 🤦🏾
Some of the best acting, writing and direction out there, period!
Bloodclart, my goosebumps r on a mad ting
i cant bellive that Jamie died
I have been waiting
I think this is better than power
I’ve been waiting all my life for this 😊😊❤️
This is too real to watch for me man. Grew up in london in the manor or as I call it Kensington Palace gardens. Every day FR it would be hustling with the mandem, moving bare food, avoiding the boys in blue & running into opps whilst I’m just trying to collect my poke bowl fam. Americans don’t understand how real this series can be for some of us in the UK but for real….  Kensington is the real ends. If you know you know
ARE YOU READY TO SQUEEZE OFF A MAN. Now that’s what I call pause
CAN'T WAIT!!!
Shows like top boy and snowfall is the reason why I can’t take nothing about the power series serious 😂… but at the end I think steph will be the next man up
Sully was wrong for killing jamie man,...steph is coming for him
Kano acting’s mad, he really an artist
YEEEEEEEEEEEE BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Ash needs to stop acting up.... Kano will bruck him up in no time, he's gotta chill
Please netflix don’t release all the episodes at once, i don’t want to finish all the season in one night like season 2
I thought it was over. Can you really keep stretching this out?
Only thing i dont like is there is only gonna be six episodes this season. Wish it was more like 8 like last season. But as long as they do it right ill be fine with it
Give us a Drake cameo😂
Dushane or Sully, one of them are definitely not making it to the end. Come back to my comment to check to see if I'm right or wrong.
I. am. ready.
Sully 100 percent getting corned at the end of this.  Hes done way to much fuckery to be living comfortably in London.  And its Stefan thats gonna do it.
Dushane wants out, he’s done with the roads. Sully, who is looking to to financially support his daughter for life (his only true purpose at this point) needs to stay in the game - this is why he popped Jamie imo
Show dies with Jamie - shoulda killed off the old heads and built around Jamie, Jacqi etc smh. Viewership tanks this season, rip to a goated TV show.
It sucks that too boy ends 😢
If they only made movie trailers like this 😂
Yesss been waiting 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
uff
Finally bruv
I want steph as the new top boy ngl
Finally included some Somalis
Oh shit😮 that’s coming out on by birth day 👊🏿
Anyone know song name?
W lessgo
Musty from baitez class
Worth it to start this tv show ?
I'm from across the pond and I am glad I found this series! I am sad that this will be the last season.
🥰🥰🥰
Dayummm is jaymi dead fr???
Let me go ahead and request off on September 7 so that I can binge watch lol
I hate it so bad that this is the last season 😢😢
What’s the song in trailer?
One thing netflix knows how to do is end a series i hate shows like the walking dead why the hell is it like 30 seasons
Steph on demon time
Are you mad 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
season 5 by the way
"If we not monsters we food, and I can never be food" 🔥🔥🔥
I’m sure we’re not going to be disappointed in the finale.  Top Boy going out with bang…
On another level
Movie making inspiration
When Sully puts them green jackets on it’s over for them likkle boys
It’s just one of those days ……
There's a shift in sides this season I can tell.
stef bouta go crazy this season
I might just pay my Netflix just for this
Literally t h e best series on nflix
Steph is a P7 😂😂😂
M83- solitude Thank me later
My Netflix subscription ends on 07/09/2023 after watching this 👌
As satisfying as it would be to see Stef get revenge on Sully..I don’t think it’ll go like that. “Know what you’re on. But that road don’t end good”   This feels like in Boyz In Tha Hood when Trey wanted to get revenge for Ricky but opted out at the last minute.  Stef might do the same.
Oop. Time to go back and watch the first 4 seasons again. Sad it's the end, but you know they're gonna push it and some crazy shit gonna go down. Mad bodies.
No more Jamie 💔
I predict Jason will comeback and be topboy😂
…WAGWAN…
Let’s gooooo
Ayoooooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I’m geeked
Sopranos..the wire and this are really the creme de la creme of modern tv shows..pure wizardry❤
IF SULLY DOES NOT DIE THIS SEASON IAM JOINING THE CAST MYSELF TO DO IT
WTTFFFFF!!!!
Not believable in the slightest. The characters don’t come across as clever . Good watch but seriously have a day off
son
Am I being delusional or is that Ranell at the window ?
if stef is going to die im done'
OMG
But they killed Jeremih and he was my favourite innit
YESSSSSSS🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
OMD I can’t wait for this, final chapter! I feel like Steph is gonna be the one to clap DuShane 💯
Cristale😮
This show is cringe af 😂

Sully died damn
LETS KURWA GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Finally I've been actually waiting for the longest time
Plot twist would be Ra Nell getting his lick back and not stephan
Steph is about to become unholy😂😂
Icl i dont think im ready for the craziness
Steph gonna be on his villain arc but at the same time he’s ultimately gonna loose cus he’s not the main character which is sad. Cus I’ll rather see him win
This is cold and dope
Holy shitttt 🔥🔥🔥
Is Jamie alive??
Creed 6 Apollo creed lives.
Masterpiece, end of.
Lets Go.
YEYEBA
Shelly and Dushanne have the driest TV romance
🥹🥹🥹🥹
i just cant get my head around why netflix doesnt produce more of these shows!
No way in hell Kano is walking away from this season with his life. He is gonna get killed, Dooshane going prison and Steph running summer house. Can't see it ending any other way
BROOOOO I CAN'T WAIT😭😭😭

Finally 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cool
Cant wait !!!!
MAN LIKE MUSTI, BIG UP BAITEZE
That's my 40th bday night sorted 👌
Hopefully sully kills stef aswell. Dunno why I’m only one who don’t like him
where’s my lauren dooooshaneeee
Season 5 for all the originals.
I literally forgot what the storyline was😂 everytime i watch a topboy trailer i dont know what the season was about.
This is season 5 people now season 3 the first 2 seasons wasn’t bought by Netflix 😅
Can’t wait
Whoever worked on this trailer needs a raise! Last season, we move!!
Shout out to Ronan Bennett, the cast and Drake. BRILLIANT!  Cheers from France 🇫🇷
Real and raw, that's why and how top boy is so good
I hope stef wack sully i hate that man
Wasn't season 3 released in 2019 or am I trippin
Steph looks badass
sheesh
One of my fave shows
I would have been surprised if Steff didn't get on demon time after seeing his brother getting popped
LFG
When is this released?
All I wanna know is Jamie coming back ?
Sorry but they don't want no War with Sully, this season is going to be a madness
Man im so sad jamie died
1:01 Wait no way is that Barry Keoghan? 👀
Some of the dialogue is cringe but  the trailer looks good
Got done watching top boy for the first time and damn Jamie death was sad af, especially after smoking his own homie to prove loyalty
COUNTIN THE FUCKIN DAYS UNTIL STEPH ROLLS UP THAT GOOF SULLY INTO A PACK
The end of an era 2011-2023🕊️
bro ik top boy good and that but best show is crazy Ong got/Game of thrones  could beat top boy in my opinion
@0:45 I swear that better not be Stef behind sully
song name pls?
Shits gonna be maad! 🥶
If dushane dies from some kind of heart problems after all of that I will be truly disappointed
What song is that
Hopefully Sully survives and gets his own spinoff show!!
Why is it the final chapter
Really excited for this season! Been waiting for it while keeping up with NBA games.
THIS IS A CULMINATION. EST. 2011
give top boy another spin off man, top boy series still has so much to squeeze up on a man, trust me.
What's the song name?
steph getback is about to be legendary
Stef needs to smoke sully and get revenge for jamie fr
The world is yours. Love the Scarface style song the mix is🔥
Ainda bem que a 3 temporada já vem tava quase ficando doido😂😂😂
The first two original seasons where the best🔥
Oh no not this glorification crap again
What ever you do Netflix, drop it once a week, build up the anticipation and excitement  so we don't get spoilers.
Barrryyyy, I hope it’s not just a cameo from him
cant wait...
why we can see jamie in this trailer👀
Anyone know the song in the background
cant wait
I heard Ra'nell pulls up and wraps everyone!
This shit better not end with Dushane killing Sully ima be so pissed otherwise
Who gonna get smoked tho Dushane or Sully one of them bruddas dying for what they did to Jamie
dis gon be a collld ting season 2 was toughhhhh brudda im hyped everyday BIG UP YASELF
Can’t wait man
Is it only me that can not wait to see this
wonder if aarons gonna mention that hes studying for the 100th time
Sully dies  Dushane gets life in prison
The music is mint, this season gonna be sick, steph looks like hes on his villains arc now
How can it end tho?!
Yo steph finna run it all back bru
Where's Aaron??
Noel Clarke back on the BBC? pathetic!!
FACT: THERE IS NO OTHER SHOW LIKE TOP BOY  + DID I SEE CRISTALE ?
Can't wait 😍😍
This gave me chills, final season Gon me bad. Did I just see cristale😊
Started when we were like 25, touching 40 now...its time to end....but need more shows like this, Ash and Kano have been sick....hope to see more from both of them.....kano should jump on that bullet proof or a cop type drama with Ash
Scarface music
Spoiler alert ⚠ they all end up dead, in prison, or with nothing to show at the end of it. That's the reality of gang life / drug dealing. They all end up with nothing in the end.
I gotta go watch all of it again before this shit comes out
Barry Keoghan is about to terrorise these mfs 1:01
What’s the song called
Rafe, Ranell and Gem better return
That music slyly gives me scarface vibes
Lets f🤬king GO!!!!
Seeing as it’s the last season. It’s very clear either Steph, Dushane or Sully will prolly die. Not enough time to do some big narrative
mid
I want at least 10 episodes we’ve been waiting
GOATED
Isn't the next Season 5?
Popcorn at the ready to watch all 3 series to remind my myself
Can't wait ❤
lets gggooo
Damn I was hoping it was just a nightmare that Jamie saw his own demise
PLS what the song
I wanna watch this soo bad but I’m not old enough yet 😅
Anyone know the name of the song?
This is the 🔚  🇬🇧🥷🏼💷
Im here since season 1 (Summerhouse) and truth be told... I hope Stef gets his revenge and Sully gets finally what he deserves. Karma is a bitch.
bit of a sticky one stylllll
That scene where sullys walking in the park in all black u can see someone behind him in all black too that’s Stefan
with all that sully has done i think in the end he will lose the most important thing ever which is his daughter. stefan definitely is gonna come in hard on that man for killing jamie. i’m still not over his death, it crushed me so hard. dushane probably will get arrested or have a massive heart attack. i also don’t think lauryn is quite off the hook yet. i think curtis sister is going to end up killing her she seemed crazy last season. i have a feeling aaron isn’t going to have a big arc since he has stressed many times the road life is not for him. this final season is going to be one for the books
BARRY????? oh i’m hyped
We need more than 10 episodes easy
I really hope Steph gets revenge for Jamie's death
thank you drake for creating the opportunity for this masterpiece to come full circle. legend.
0:11
I can't wait
Rip sully
Stef garn tun bad man
Bring back Jamie
BEST SHOW!
Steph turn big stepper
this will get watched
NOT GONNA BE SAME WITHOUT JAMIE
Watched this from day 1 on channel four and it amazes me how big it has become. One of the best shows iv ever watched, Both really excited and really nervous for the final season. Stef killing sully is far far too obvious imo, think we will get a really big twist. Only one will make it out alive I think but who?
Steph will be top boy
Sully needs to go
The big plot twist will either Sully kills Dushane or Dushane killa Sully
LETS GOOOO🔥🔥🔥
Name of the song please 🙏
Let who out? Jamie from the death?
Did I just see Musti in the trailer 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally Sheesh!!! Cant wait. Ready to Hit Play! One of the best shows on Netflix, hands down.
I’ve been waiting 🔥🔥
Let’s gooooo

Let’s Gooooo
Niggas arc
Song Name
RELEASE IT PLSSSSS
So since they killed off Jamie, Jack is now gonna end up as top boy? Ok don’t care much about this show no more
Jamie is alive 1:30 he is speaking to Dushane and he is probably in a hospital bed
Is it season 3 or 5
Time to binge watch season 2 again in preparation
1:05 first somali I've seen in top boy 😂😂😂
stef is gonna be on the same team as dushane watch
yo
Song name?
“The best show on Netflix” is the wildest take I’ve heard in years
I don’t know about y’all but ima get some good sleep cause on 9/7 I’m watching all episodes in 1 day 😂
This show is just a poor copy of the wire  ' and the main man dulshane is a grass.  Got his rival nicked by using achild to plant whatever in hes house.      Nobody would ever graft with a wrong un. Ever again.         Very unrealistic.    Nuffsed
Fiqadu
F yeah🎉
Can’t believe this be the ending of top boy they need to do more !!! One word for too boy immense
name of the song ?
🔥🔥🔥💯
PORFINNNNN
Let's bora
So Jamie is gone ffs😭🥹
you ready to squeeze on a man? 🤣🤣
Cristale😭😭❤
Utterly brilliant. This is the state of our nation. It's not the black and the white thing. For me it's about people doing the right thing. Those poor kids. Sometimes I'm in tears watching this. Brilliant. Thank you Kano...... Legend☮️❤️
I don't want it to end .. Going to be EPIC and SAVAGE all at the same time...Maybe dead people aren't dead and will pop up ... Respect to the writers and cast
Sound track
Cuties now More BLM  propaganda
I for one am not ready at all for this series to end UNLESS they start a new chapter staring steph as a main character
If waiting was a person 👀🧐🫶🏾🔥
What’s the name of this song
I have a funny feeling Ra'nell coming back and sully is gonna die
I forgot what happened in season two 😂
Guns in london?😂😂
If Steph tries anything sully gotta smoke that kid 😤
I believe Shirley is pregnant
Ahhhhhh the racial stereotypes that everyone's so hungry for.... WAKE UP FOLKS!!!!
Steph finna Step !! Hope we get to see Ranell in the final season. Ain’t seen his character since Top Boy Summerhouse.
Ready to squeeze off on a man? 😳
Song-Solitude by M83
Whats the background song ?
TIME TO REWATXH THIS
Can’t wait
CANT WAIT
1:25 isnt this the jacket Sully wrote when he killed Jamie?
Something is telling me sully is going to die in this last season dushane might have a ♥ attack I remember sully & Jack asked if he was OK he brushed them off he has a health problem this might be his downfall
Sully needs to go!
Mirror mirror on the wall  Who’s the boy that tops them all
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rip Jamie 🕊️
Can't wait for S3
My bro knows the guy who plays aaron wish I asked my bro if i Could speak to aaron and try join s3 😭
Song name?
Not ready for another black crime movie. No Thank You
As soon as this show is released,I will forgive Netflix for all other abominations
Does anyone have a doubt that sully will be smoked or squeezed off by stefan.
Shame it's the last season show can't miss all good things I suppose though
sooo excited
yea the writers had no idea what to do with this show anymore
I knew this show would end with a riot
I can't wait for this...sunny I think he will get pay bk from Dushane
Il watch a few months after it comes out, last time the idiots cried that people watched it right away so 🤷🏾‍♂️
It’s Jamie enne
Dushanes getting nicked, sully gonna get killed. That's my prediction, it'll be ashame tho Sully's the guy
Don't loke Barry keoghan being in it, personally think he's a massively over rated actor
Best series on Netflix i think, i watched season 1 then discovered Summerhouse and watched that then season 2 (all twice). I guess i better rewatch the first 3 series again just in time :)
Best thing about sully he keeps it og
I hope Dushane finally loses
Took months filming this for man to watch it all in one day
This season is going to be crazzzyy!!
Gassed ...... Will anyone survive ?????
No jamie😢brooo
Everybody on smoke this season 😮😈🔥🔥😈🇬🇧🗣 I'm ready uk fam ma boy looking dark 😈
I still say Dushanne has heart attack. Last season he kept going on about pains in chest, even spoke to sully in car park about it. Can't wait to see how this pans out. Ashley Walters and kano have truly brought us a real uk hood series. We'll done guys.
Dat tiktok would u rather music
Awesome
I can just tell this is going to end with no winners, just body bags.
Anyone know Name of song in trailer
Steph's not strong he's not about that life top has always had good writing steph isn't that guy
"Ready to squeeze off on a man" wild statement but I'm excited still
This is it goodbye summerhouse going miss this show explosive ending coming
La frappe qui arrive 💪💪💪💪
Wait so Jamie dead for real?...
No dris in the flashback 😢
This music in the background 🤝🔥anyone know what’s its called
those big budget shows got nothing on this
Name of the song please
Song?
I wonder if curtis sister v makes an appearance
Where do you guys think you will go when you die? Heaven or hell? Do you believe Jesus Christ died for you was buried and rose again three days later for our sins?
This Looks Nuts. I need another two seasons.
No showing of Vee? Do you honestly think that she's going back to Liverpool quietly, after what happened to Curtis. She will only go back to get more backup and weapons. She ain't finished yet.
bro this go hard
ranell should be in the last season
I feel like Jaq is about to die 😧
Name of the song?😢
trailer song plz
Ranell and Stef vs Sully and Doooshane.
steph about to be a mad man
This shit gonna be emotional. Can't wait.

I thought it was a Prototype trailer 💀
Can not wait 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊😊
say no more
Dris comeback
the fact that i be checking everyday for this and it's finally here! let's go!!!!
What if the Albanians return and wipe out everyone
The Mandem
peakk
steph about to turn into the prowler
Looks good , I hope they cut through all the theatrics between sully and dushane . That story’s getting old . Just let the line be drawn once and for all PLEASE lol
Bruh idk why the part with Steph putting on the chain is so cool to me
My son Jamie really a pack 😣😖
Jamie got put in a spliff, Stephan got put in a spliff, Aaron got put in a spliff🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wish we could have gotten more seasons out of this show, three seasons just doesn’t seem like enough.
Steff killing Sully is too obvious and he's only been on road for 2 mins he ain't capable of shit against summerhouse
Jamie  🥶
1:10 NOOO NO SULLY IS GOIN AFTER JAMIES MATES THATS MY FAVOURITE SIDE ACTOR FCKKKKKKKKK SULLY
What song Is this
FINALLY A TRAILER WTF
Pause.
They blur out Jamie’s face holding a gun if u watch it in slow mo don’t know what this means tho
Jamie.
There’s jail gates closing that sound means someone’s getting life or Someone coming out   Also I think Steph tries he flops the mid race boy tries and sully kills Him
I can imagine Sully telling Steph, "You still going on about that? It got wrapped up, it's cool, innit. Gonna have to eat that one." 😂
I thought this is The Boys: Season 3. 😅
Barry Keoghan about to save this entire show now that Micheal Ward left.
They need to release these episodes in the cinema
Slide for Jamie💯
Can’t wait bruv 🖤🔥
September 7.⛽
Goosebumps
We all know we’re gonna a need a few more seasons
I need a Stefan story after this just like how power got PowerBook, I need to know how Stefan turns out thanks
"Squeeze off on a man" 😂
now yes netflix
Steph on roads
Kano needs more acting roles in U.K. films and series, guys got mad talent
Ra’nell is coming back I’m calling it. They showed young him in the trailer and then out the end said “no loose ends” HIS COMING BACK
I wish Jaime wasn't dead but it's impossible 🥲
İ miss jaime 🥲
Can’t wait to see sully killed
Man, the music swelling up in this trailer is soo unnerving..like the whole story is building up to an explosive crescendo of beauty & tragedy. This is my biased opinion but I feel like this show is the most authentic story about gang & hood life since The Wire.
we all about steff aight erbody
can't wait
ABOOOOOOOOOOOOO
No way this the last chapter
I bet there are gonna be some goosebumps scenes in this final chapter😮‍💨
whats the song they used in this?
All the og top boy fans still want ra’nell to pop up somewhere
Istg if jamie alive im gunna be buzzing
Bary fukin keogan
My theory:  Either Dushane or Sully is left standing, winning. I just can’t see both of them making it out alive. Either Dushane gets gunned down or Sully. Either way, the other one will take revenge and stand on top, being the real top boy in the end.
Going to be amazing this
IM SO GASSED
Bring da food
We definitely lost Steph 😭💀
Imagine if Rannell comes back and helps Steph take revenge against Sully cos Sully also killed someone he knew
Stef the topboy thoughts
Why did drake buy top boy to end it after 3 seasons wtf was the point
Ok I’ll watch Toy Boy again
What is this song
show bout to go no1
Sick ass trailer cant wait!!!
Revenge!!!
End of season 2 traumatize me !!
Saw Barry and i got excited. Saw Barry in a irish type of top boy it was so good he was really young but really good. Its one show I'd pay to see on Netflix usually I'll watch online but top boy is a master class show so I'll definitely rewatch the first few seasons to catch up and I hope they release all episodes so i can binge it on the weekend
i aint ready for sully inevitably meeting his harsh fate, damn
Looking forward to it
I’m readyyy 🔥
Lovely!!!
bad show not watching
The straps look too new for it to be london but nevermind 😂😂
Can someone help me with 750 dollars through digital currency, I have a very bad disease, the cost is expensive, please help me
Let’s go😭
Alright, lads! Rioting is okay but misgendering an officer is a no-no! haha
stefan get back gonna go crazy
Watch the plot twist being Aaron becoming topboy after smoking everyone after not securing the first
The last season ended with the old bill on dushane and sully Who gets em first the feds or steff and his crew
Them scousers are coming back for revenge. Dont sleep on that crazy sister and wonk eye 🤪
You know someone big is about to dieee
I just hope this final season don't disappoint. I've seen time and time again a banging trailer for the final season and then "the let down". Been waitin on this for minute, please go out with a bang.🙏🏾
Song name?
Jamie’s back?
Soooo.....to my complete understanding, Jamie really dead?????? Couldn't it be a dream or something😭😭🥺 whhhhyyy🤧🤧🤧🤧
I hope the boys from L8 turn up and get revenge for Curtis
now ppl can stop saying Jamie aint dead 🙏
Can't wait!!!
Something realky bad happend to sherley, daughtr or so. Ee could see Dris baby mama banging on the bus. Jaq saying there aint no going back meaning Dushane would have to do something
Man hopefully Steph get his revenge
They should bring rafe back
Does anyone know who it is dushane is takling to at the end because to me it sounds like a badly wounded Jamie but i dont know if that makes sense
Yesssssssss I've been waiting so long for this💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Been too long since i watched jamie get done up. Stef needa finally put an end to summerhouse sully..
Where is aaron in this trailer? Still studying?
Stef needa avenge jamie fr man. "Stef innit"
Sht about to get crazy!!!
Steph is on a mission
What’s the name of the song
I MISS YOU JAMIEEEEEEE😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I need to watch it
This finna end up just like snowfall I’m telling you 🤦🏽‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️
CANT WAIT
I'm super ready for this 🔥
I can NOT wait 🎉
As an American, I love British movies and series.
Brazyyyyy 🥶🥶
ITS SUMMER HOUSE SULLY
🎉🍾🥂😆😆😆 I can’t wait for this 🔥🔥🔥👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Stephan bouta be on DEMON time
My question is what positive influence does movie show to minorities on making a better life for themselves instead of programming one’s mind into indulging in folly?
What’s wrong with the sound. Can barely hear them speaking.
I can’t believe it’s comefermed that Jamie’s dead 😢
How many episodes this season is the question?
What,a great opportunity to re-watch everything to refreshing the mind. Its gonna be a sad moment when I'll watch the last episode. When I finished The Wire it took a mad long time to feel in the gap. This show kinda did.
Steph going bad!!
Gooose bumps!!!! Sick trailer! Let's f*cking go!!
I hope thr writing improves from last season
Song?
dushane probably dies of a heartattack
What is this piece of music called??
about time
yoooo did y’all seeeee…..crustal bruv….this is already a hit ukkkk🫡
Hell yeah. Right around the corner.
Best show on Netflix and can't wait for the final chapter!
Where’s KSI
So I’m watching Top Boy rn wondering when the season 3/5 trailer is gonna drop and I look it up and low and behold it dropped today. What are the odds?
stephs character has so much potention for dis season!!
Team Skully….let’s gooooooo!!!
Whole series is shite!
IM SO HYPE OMGGGG
Somebody please tell me the name of that song.  Edit: Found it. It's "Solitude" by M83.
Can not wait for this
This show is  a Masterpiece on the low !
Glory to black on black violent crime
Epic👌👌👌
Top 3 best shows of all time
Steph will be top boy after he takes down the current sully
This final chapter is about to be gut-wrenching. I can feel it!
Can’t wait brudda 🔥
I'm I the only one seeing koffee
Song anyone?
Kano has to die this season
Cold frfr
Now thats a trailer. I first watched top body on channel 4 in the UK all those years back and honestly Netflix has done it justice
Remember Dushane Is The Brains 🧠 And The Muscle While Sully Is Calculated And Just The Pure Muscle And The Equal Partner And One Of The Equal Bosses 👑Alongside Dushane In The Summerhouse Empire 👑So They Both Will Survive Because They Are Monsters 😈🥶🩸📌😈s🩸📌🗣💯💯♟🩸📌
Who else seen Unknown T 😂
I hope Sully kills stef and he has a happy ending. Idc bout the rest
Sully about to cause a madness
Dushane goes to jail as Top Boy as Stef kills Sully
I hope they bring back 0:17 Ra'nell all the characters for one last final season
Seeing that intro makes me hope we’ll see characters from summerhouse that are all grown up now
Im absolutely choking to see this season. Lets gooooo!!!.
Looking forward to it😊
Is this really a good show? I have never watched it before. It looks boring....
I thought it said TOY BOY SEASON 3 HAHAHA🥲 trailer wasn’t making any sense for me
What's the music on this productys  a madness
We just gonna ignore Aaron wasn’t in the trailer even though he’s in the season 5 cast? I think they got something big lined up for his character this season
Musti from Baiteze you know
I feel like this season will be similar to the French movie athena where the main character goes on a revenge arc with all the other youngsters cuz he's brother was killed
Can’t wait
yasssssss🥶
WAS THAT CRISTALE
someone help me out here, aint this season 5?
I clicked reading its The Boys Season then i read that again.
Stephan definitely killing someone, just gotta take your guess on who…
Been waitin for dem man!💥🔥
“Loose Ends” 🔥🔥
Realist show on Netflix
Stefan bro...
Can't waiiittttt
Give Kano his awards now, man about to rip it a new one
Remember when they dnt show to much of the show in the Trailer its gona be good. 😂😂
dushane vs sully
i can’t wait🔥🙏🏽
Why does the veneration of vice have such a massively disproportionate presence among this constituency? It's a crisis of character.
Jamie alive in the hospital
All I see is flames 🔥
TOP BOY!? Thats the name they went with? Is there a Bottom Man?
Sully better not die man
Shesshhh🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anyone know the name of the song they used in this trailer?
Is Jamie alive
I just hope sully has a good ending, best character. But got a feeling he will get life’d off, dushane will probably have a heart attack since he been having problems with it.
Top boy
Finally . Looks EPIC
Like a flat circle...
Yes my mandem Gonna be peak innit fam
This show hits different 🔥
A great TV series I will be watching like most,but that person who said this is the best TV series on Netflix it's quite hilarious I assume he ain't watched much TV series on Netflix apart from top boy🤔🤣
I wonder if Erin was the girl Steph was in the car with
Yooooooooo 😮, I'm so Shocked it's coming out... Not watching the Trailer I need to Be Surprised 😩🙃😮‍💨💯 Thanks Netflix 🫡
this was film right next to me
At last, it's been a while waiting for the fifth series! Sully better not die.
Stephs bro dies now he thinks he a gangster 😭 so forced they about to ruin the show by pulling a tariq
OMFG
Someone is about to lose a friend(more like a brother)
Let’s gooooo🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 man Jamie was my fav person in that bihh Steph finna go bat shit crazy lost his bestfriend and brother getting head shit right in front of him
Finally. But when will it be on ? I heard Mid September
Ayyy this looks hard can’t lie
Lmao at the people that think Kano is acting 😂
If Steph doesn’t take sully out I hope he takes someone close to him . That’s all .
Steph goin down a dark road.. Man I hopin Sully stays alive.
Oh shitttt! This caught me off guard and now im fuckin hyoeddddd
Whose speaking at the end
No no no no  What is this!!!!!! Where is my all those characters..........?
The music choice was 🔥🥶
anything gay? no? 😢
Bring back Ra’nell !!!
Hopefully no LGBT whatever in the show
Guess it’s time to start rewatching Top Boy, tooooo gassed😅
i cannot wait
Haven’t shown Aaron yet in trailer wonder where he is
Hopefully they don’t screw this up. Curtis’s sister shall better come for revenge. Also Dushane will never match to Bobby Raikes, Bobby Raikes was the original top boy his reign is way better than Dushanes.
It aint the same without jamie
Oow yes please
Finally been waiting for this 🔥
Can’t wait for the final season man it’s unfortunate how quick time has flew past but every good show comes to a end
1:05 “you ready to squeeze off onda man?”  seconds later you see sully punching him
Can't wait! ⏰
I just watched it... what a show.. mind blowing... ❤
They messed up starting on season 1 when it ahould have been season 3. Most people never even seen the first 2

Only 84k views in 7 hours? Nahhhh must be bugging the hype in the UK is crazy for this
It’s Loyin’s time now boyyyyy!!!
This is gonna be the biggest tv show of the year these guys mad a show and a half the years and filming make this the best
Bro it's been forever ♾️ can't wait
Steph gonna be on madness
Dunno why ra’nell wasn’t carried on he was a great character would love to see him back for this one
that was either Ranell or Jamie at the end
garaaaa
I'm from the UK and this gang culture is shit compared to how it was nearly 3 decades ago its just cringe. But Snowfall on the other hand shits on this 1000000000% percent.
how? i have watched top boy season 1,2,3,4 🤨 wait what is this old or what am confused
Bobby Raikes was right when he told Dushane that Sully would be a liability and eventually bring him down.  Edit: This reminds me of the Flashback in the Final Season of Better Call Saul when Mike URGED Jimmy not to work with Walter White because of how unreliable his ego and impulsive response to his emotions made him a liability. The beginning of the trailer of the final season of Top Boy is deeper than the surface the images that came after Sully are the faces of people that were all affected by his recklessness and decisions. Nonetheless Dushane backed him everytime. Along the way, Dushane had several chances to get out the game early and that along with how Sully's choices effected everything is also catching up to him"When Peter pays for Paul, Paul shall pay for all".
I can't stand that Stef is there. SMH.
YESSSSSSD OMGGGG IVE BEEN WAITING
Im going to kiss episodes to binge it
0:57 Mocro maffia??????
I just don’t understand why they only wanna do this season as the last !! Could definitely go on !!! Dumb decision from Netflix
Steph With the Cornrows, he going Neeky now innit 😭🤹🏾
"You ready to squeeze off on the man" is wild 😭🤣
🔵 or 🔴 pil?
this season is gonna be war
September gona be lit dammm..kano deserves an award
The best show on Netflix.. 😂 that’s a bit of a bold claim. I mean… it’s good but don’t disrespect stranger things
Me and my homies smoking that jamie pack 🚬
Ard
The end
Lets gooooo
Ooooooh
show is called top boy and in the thumbnail the two men have so much segsual tension lmao
❤great
Good shiii
Sully dying this season in last ep without a doubt
we better be smokin on Sully by the end of the season idc.
It will be mad for sully and dushane to beef each other and Steff take side with dushane
So peak there’s only 6 eps though it’s getting blasted off in one day
Yes!!! I get to brush up on my street vocabulary! You get me Fam 😂
My man Barry Keoghan gonna be putting in some next level quirky zany eccentric performance
WILL BE A BANGER OF A SEASON CANT WAITT
This season will be the maddest of em all, i know it!!
The black stereotype and glorification if roadman continues.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this will be lit
Anyone know what this song is?
Looking forward to it !
Been looking forward to this been a long time coming 🧡👊
Barry Keoghan 🔥
Sad when this show ends... absolute masterpiece/  uk- the wire
Lets gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Ra’nell??
I'm intrigued by Barry Keoghans involvement. First off because he's a great actor and secondly because I wonder will his character essentially be based on Daniel Kinahan. Would make sense as an "end boss" antagonist for the series seen as the Kinahan cartel have been been one of the real life end bosses in the Western European drug game particularly in the UK and Ireland for so long.   Also Barry Keoghan is actually from a really rough inner city Dublin background and to be honest probably grew up knowing people who were or still are actually involved with the cartel, which could lead to a brilliant performance given the fact that characters like this are usually played by middle class actor types who just do broad over the top parodies of what they think these people are like.
I am so hype for this.
Load of shite, bad acting and glorifies absolute dickheads in this life. Sure it will keep a few simpletons amused.
That lil brother ain’t got the balls to murder someone
Ra’nelle has to come back in this series always wondered what happened to him. Did he become a baller in the end! Please give us closure!!
Yo tbh i can only think about steph and what he experienced/what will he do. and i hope they dont give him some corny lackluster ass ending to the situation.
What song is this on trailer
I can see sully dying and it’s sad cuz he’s been my favourite character.
Yessss
Gonna be special. Haven't kept up with a show in awhile and I know people still haven't seen this one. Excited to close this chapter. Kinda bittersweet tho
so jamie innit, really is dead
Is Jamie actually dead???😭😭
While the British hype up black culture , the Indians Chinese and Arabs are ruling you
Can’t wait for this 🙌🏽. Hope they release all the episodes at once again and not weekly
It's mad no1 knows the trailer is out yet
Does anyone know the name of the music in The trailer ?
Song?
JAMIE JAMIE I DONT KNOW NO JAMIE
I want  that steph vs sully war🔥
Topboy was best thing on Channel4 then best thing on Netflix. Really looking forward to this 5th and final season Xxx
Imagine if Jamie comes out of the blue, would be maddddd
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 🥳🥳🥳🥳
I don’t think people are ready for Kano, Stef and Barry Keoghan’s characters this season. Performances are looking crazyyyyy 😮‍💨
💛💙💛💙💛💙👍
It won’t be same without Jamie❤
Kinda lost its grittyness since the first season but still good.
The best serie
Cant wait for the spinoff Bottom boy😂😂
Big riot too
Need the off shoots of this  Mad acting by all 👊🏽👊🏽
Rar did them man bring the joker into topboy sware that was barry keoghan
renew the partnership contract of stranger things x deady by dayligth
I WASN’T EXPECTING ANOTHER SEASON😳!!! F’ING YAYYYYYYHYY😁😁😁😁🤗🤗🤗
Barry keoghan that’s a good actor to see in top boy
Have a feeling sherleys daughter was attacked or killed by stefs gang
What’s your early predictions ppl ?   It don’t look good for any of character question is does Dushane die or get life in prison I think sully survives and that snitch friend maybe saves dushane
Trailer was so well put together, the flashbacks of summerhouse characters, the eiree music, and the little teases without spoiling too much, grew up with top boy, fully grown adult now and ready to put this masterpiece to bed!
Where’s Stefan’s other brother ?
Mad to see Cristale play a role in it, big moves 💯
Great that theres still shows like this rather than woke shit
Finally we got Somalis 🇸🇴 in this season 🎉
This how the thing go. STEF kills sully thr police arrets stef. The entire summer house goes on a riot. To let stef out of jail.
Channel 4 Dropped the ball!! How could you miss out on this!!
Unknown t is gonna be on this
where's my Lauren, Doouushaneee
Man imagine ranell returns, doubt it but the real fans have wanted him since the revival. And stef is gonna be in the game cannot wait
You all stupid if you don’t think this will end sully and dushane story and start stef and Jacques story off. The show is too popular and they will see what power snowfall GOT etc all are doing which is making successful spin offs.
Waguan
They put Somali's in top boy?! It's about to go down
Buzzing for this final season its going to be lit i feel their will be a few main cast members deaths
Sully bout to get smoked i know it
All my favorite shows are ending. 😢
So excited for this!!!one and two were 🔥🔥🔥
BARRY KEOGHAN in TOP BOY?!?!? 😱😱😱 1:00
Did this season air on channel 4 years ago like the other seasons, or was it recently filmed?   I watched TopBoy that many years ago, and with Netflix airing more episodes as 1 season, compared to how it was originally aired, it’s confusing.
Jax last G standing....
Sully has to die idc 💀
Is that Jamie at the end?????
I am downloading netflix just to watch the final season of Top Boy after that I'm cancelling my membership, I am that hyped for it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I THOUGHT IN THE TITTLE SAID THE BOYS SEASON 3
Barry keoghan 🔥
Hopefully you don’t f with it too much like you did last season, too much “ he’s gotta go” not that’s it’s gotta be 💯 realistic but still half believeable
If they bring back Ra’nell that will be insane. Looking forward to this season regardless 🔥
cant wait for this one huge fan cant wait
you just know sully is gonna get capped by steph
𝓼𝓲 ....🔥💨®️7𝓽𝓱
Will there be a Russian voice acting?
But did Jamie die tho
Gutted it is ending, not much else like it...
stefs get back 😈
Aint no way! Is this Christmas already for me?!
Can't wait 🎉
Can’t wait
1:30 sully is deffo in a hospital bed
I hope it’s not the cliche thing of Stefan being the one to end sully. Whoever is penning the end should do it right pls, not something the viewers already think or know.
ranell is back
I swear I’d miss this. Top 5 best Netflix shows. This deserves some award in its right
Was that mizzy at 1:07?
September guys
Last season gonna be a Mazza 😍🔥
Dushane and sully will probably both die or Dushane finally gets caught and get life in prison while sully is killed by Steph in revenge probably
It was about time they got around to this!! 💥
A storm is brewing and Stefan is here for it all. This revenge and villain arc will be chaos, amazing and sad all in one 🥶
😢
*ITS BEEN 3 SEASONS* and no Drake cameo as the local Boss-Man - disappointed.
Can someone tell me the name of the background song before I lose my head please 🙏🏼
Lol I thought it is The Boys s3 trailer XDD
It only makes since to end this season. No one stays the top boy forever.
Yes 👍🏽 yes 👍🏽 yes
Stef be thuggin it's happening 😭😭🔥🔥
OMG IT ALMOST HERE!!!!
Im so exited  omd
They need to do some Top Boy spin offs with some of the main characters like the Power universe
Yes!!!!! Im a huge fan!
Song name?
This supposed to be season 5 not 3 I guess.
Só assistir a segunda temporada a primeira está em inglês 😅😅 que a terceira venha  dublado em inglês 🙌😅
Cant wait for season 3, DUSHANE OR SULLY? ONE IS GOING TO GO BYE BYE I FEEL, TOP BOY STILL SLEPT ON, BUT IT'LL BECOME A CULT CLASSIC WATCH.
Please don't be crap. Writers have a habit of fumbling final seasons.
Cristale!!!
Amazing show, great cast, great acting, great writing, 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nooooo way !!! I’m beyond excited . Need to re watch the other seasons first
stef killiin sully is too obvious, im hoping theres a different ending
🔥🔥🔥
mẹ bà. Top boy mà tao tưởng The Boy seasion 3😅
Thank Drake for reviving it
Song id???❤
I CAN'T WAIT 🔥🔥🔥
Can't wait!
To end it now is perfect in my opinion, it won't make the mistake of game of thrones losing direction etc and come on how much more can really be written other then other top boys stepping up
Jamie not being on the show seems weird. Tf is Steph going to do as a roadman?😂😂😂
Oh yeah ❤️
Can’t wait
1:09🤔
seasons gonna be a madness
Glad netflix saved this from channel 4, be another sad day when it's finished
This the song
Man got caught lacking 😢
Lol thumbnail reminds me of prototype.
being different with interest and quality is a big thing...🖖🏻
Awesome Top Boy: Season 3 Official Trailer.
Yh finally
ok
At a glance i thought it was The Boys but then I saw the stupid Netflix logo and all that excitement went out the window.
Dris is still alive dammit!
who asked for this though
🙄
please dust off sully 🫡
Dammit! This wasn't what I thought it was. Skip!
Finally. I have been waiting
Cool
Mane I forget what happened from szn2😂
Name song?
GANG GANG
Fire 🔥 ass show let’s get to it Netflix . I appreciate the display on your platform
Hell yeah 🔥🔥
Allow it fam
Peak is back for one last season
I can't wait omg
No more loose ends. Time to tie up the loose ends in the endz 💪🏿👊🏿
Notification pop up i thought it was the boys 💀
We'res bottom boy
Very good song choice! Solitude by M83 is a masterpiece
Stef better slide for Jamie
Steph about to go on that villain arc
Facts or undeniable facts?...it is actually season 5 not season 3 but its good that it is returning soon even if it is the season finale.
I said Netflix india
Damn good things coming back
Big G sully back😆
Top Boy: Season 3 looks strangely interesting. Seems like Netflix knows how to do their assignment well.
Only the real fans since Day 1 know this is season 5 not 3
Bruh I thought it was The Boys ahjshs didn’t even see it was Netflix channel 😭
Wow finally
The Society season 2 next please :)
Poor jamie man He‘s dead now
in a world Sully must get boped by Stephan
Best show , stfu, its good and I like it, It doesnt compete agaisnt black mirror or stranger things or outerbanks or You.
It's not season 3 it's season 5. Why did Netflix have to confuse everybody with that Top Boy (season 3 and 4) and Top Boy : Summerhouse (season 1 and 2) crap? Sort your shit out Netflix.
Sep 7 lol
When???
my high ass thought this was the Boys 💀
Yo 😀🔥
Best show on Netflix. Better than Snowfall or any other show in that genre.
Rahhh This is gonna be Fire 🔥🔥🔥
Nice just recently finished as well lol
Song?
This show has enough seasons to make anyone feel violent
Why did i read the boys season 3 💀
Hopefully this show can end on a satisfying note....been a long journey and they definitely delivered these past two seasons.
Bout time we get something good on Netflix 🔥
Let’s go
Why this gotta end though 😢😢😢😢😭😭
Looks shit
Can't be mad it's ending after three seasons on Netflix. Remember this was cancelled by Channel 4 and they revived it. It's beeen a long journey, but every show has to come to an end.
awesome 😎
Well let game begin 🔫
Yeeesssss I've been waiting for this one of the best Netflix crime shows of all time🙏🙏🙏
Whats the song in the background I hear it everywhere but I can never find it!
