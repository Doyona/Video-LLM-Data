What if they could use 343 to help
Ask 343
I heard of a time when dr bright dealt with the problem. He put a rocket booster on the moon IO and send it directly into the station. destroying it. but I think it just happend in one world
God
Guys turn on captions, then watch this all the way through again, thank me later
And to think that this will be te very same destroyer that would save humanity from scp-001 when days break
Poor Barrier Unit 45… didn’t have a clue 🥀
Scp 066 pls
Part two
This robot alien looks kind of cool
What about the scarlet king and the gate guardian and when day breaks?
Consider we stop trying to destroy the indestructable devices, but rather instead we just find as many of it's parts as possible and hide them away on earth to be reverse engineered then destroyed. Also if it took damage from impacting with IO then enough brute force is capable of damaging it, so lets hurl some asteroids at it.
How you got this information tell me
Did you know that was not green lighting strike because it will turn invisible very fast
Just mentioning a mistake that Jupiter isn't solid it is a gas giant same thing with Saturn and Uranus and Neptune are ice giants which has a same difference.
Why dont we use shy guy to get whoever’s looking at it (or if its a mech whcih gets destroyed) let it find the planet and destriy trh controls but if itd a mech then we guve shyguy a suit that makes him atleast fly on jupiter
Imagine if this is just an alien accidentally crashing it and they just want it to repair itself and come back otherwise they are paying for it xD
MINECRAFT SCP-2399? Yes ME: YES SCP-2399 MINECRAFT MOD YES
6:00 earth destroyed by own scp 001 j activated red button during xk class scenario
Can u take the damage part and try to use it against scp
Unless you consider the Daybreak branch of history.  If so, it's a malfunctioning saviour, sent to fix the daylight.
0:54  bs, theres no land in *gas* giants
My ass smells terrible
Use scps for power and use scp 001
it is simple, you know is not so indestructible if it recived such a far amouth of damage from a simple rock so called IO just it whit IO again, until is a buch of scrap and also hit it whit something else in case like europa, in case it learned
Doesn’t an EMP already exist? We can just make 2399 vulnerable by sending it one of those and then finally end it.
And it’s shrinking.. and shrinking….. and shrinking……
Jupiter is a gas giant no land
This is a goddamn gas giant
I summon Oppenheimer!!
Jupiter protected us from asteroids now its protecting the SCP foundations from 2399💪
The only reason it broke through collision was cause it was going so fast it hit io and hit in a devastating blow
you sound like the blue radio app
Does anyone notice how this “thing” looks like that one monster from voltron the animated series?
(I'm not a hater the SCP description has A LOT of loopholes I'm just pointing it out😅)  Why does it show that Jupiter has ground 😂😂😂 Jupiter is a GAS GIANT it ain't have no ground on it 😂😂😂😂😂  Btw if something is 3 mil ly away so and when they blocked a msg they noticed so the msg is faster than light and the storm on Jupiter is 200yrs old and 3billion years ago (what the aliens see) earth would look like hell earth would be covered on lava meteors and fire rain😂😂😂
Why don't we use meteors that could maybe destroy it because the moon is made of minerals and rocks so does meteors if we can get an meteor and accurately goes to scp-2366 with so much speed it could may do it
What if you just grab it's missing pieces? And if the drones follow spam them with emp's and nukes because it's too far away from 2399?
Illuminate from hd2
Uhhh....... Jupiter is a gas giant.... It has so surface or ground
I think the scp foundation could use a heat ray to destroy this thing
PART 2 PLEASE
I have an idea move to the moon or throw it into the sun
This must have been cooperated with U.H.D. (Basically Urbanshade Hadal Division)
I know how to kill scp-2399 use the monster that's behind the doorway or scp- 3999
jesus the comments are a kid fest, any video in this channel has conversations as smart as a cucumber
If you can’t get rid of the drones, get rid of the materials they collect
Still waiting
I appreciate you 😊
Apparently it was suppose to arrive on earth during the 1600’s? So many of us wouldn’t have even been born if it didn’t crash into IO
Why cant they jjst ask god scpto kill it?
Imagine those guys were just an advanced scp foundation??
How bout an EMP?
The scp 001 tale of scp2399 is actually sad yall should read it
I have idea why not take one of the missing pieces so it can't be repaired maybe just tke three or five piecee
bro u were my childhood,d scaring my and also giving me so much entertainment. Thank you!!
I’ll be34 when it comes
I know it is a long time after I should of said this, but why does jupiter have land 💀💀💀💀
Just show SCP-2399 a picture of SCP-096
scp-2399 100% completed ''insert subnautica cyclops voice'' welcome aboard captain all systems online
22 years left
what if.. and hear me out.. we just give dr. bright an objective "destroy scp-2399" and see what he can do
there's an easy way to destroy or remove scp 2399: if the scp foundation was able to understand the orders 2399 was receiving, that means they could figure out how to give orders to scp 2399 themselves, so they could for example make it self destruct/disassemble, return to it's creator or even take control of scp 2399 and use it as a weapon.
so you're telling me, that multiple nukes can't even scratch the thing, but a big space rock can
Launch hard to destroy reptile at it
Send 096 at it
Nuk😊
This is easy to destroy. You just yeet the infinite toilet paper thing at it and make it go critical. Then. B O O M
SCP Illustrated be like : the savior during when day break
it might have finished its construction....
sick new plot twist it fully repairs when our own world has ended from other SCPs and proceeds to wipe out the destroyed remains allowing us to pick up the pieces as it returns from whence it came.
Jupiter: gas giant  The rubber: nah it has a surface
Wait I still dont get why the barrier unit was destroyed. Can someone explain?
They could build spaceships to escape earth and move to mars or a exoplanet or go to a different solar system
The video with the Scientist talking that worked on this one was the Best SCP Video I have seen. It was better than most movies.
(●’◡’●)ﾉ
Scp 343 should do it
isnt jupiter a gas giant and has no solid surface...
I think the way to power the weapon is a dyson sphere even 1% completion of the mega structure would probably be more than enough to obliterate it and... jupiter
The reason I know this scp is fake is because it shows land on Jupiter in the video which is impossible because Jupiter actually doesn't have land under its gassy atmosphere, but it has a ginormous ocean, so scp 2399's sircutes would have been fried
That one kid crying behind the screen because they think this is real:
But their the foundation tho why not use other scp's to their advantage if its really that world ending
What happens if it hits a jupiter tornado?
I realied,, scp is literally men in black
If they can decipher and get the "repair command" ¿why not doing the reverse of that process but with a "NO repair command" ??
1+1=2                       1+1=2
Idea Use the onmat power Of the sun the power of EMP
What if the doomsday weapons are 1 use
Idea fast moving objects get destroyed what about slow moving objects
Why not use a reality bending or something that erases things from existing? Perhaps the lunatic.
BTW THER EART WILL destroyed too scp try so many time to stop eart destroye but after a year it will destroyed it self bc of global warning and lower ice make new entty than stuck in the ice escape
Unit 53 or 45?
0:30 i love how it only takes the rubber a few seconds to get us entertained
I think it should be done right SCP-2399 Damaged disruptor
what if they're just trying to perform a stellar maneuver around the sun but forgot about the big ass jupiter
Fun fact, it's far more likely that jupiter is made up mostly of liquid, not gas. Jupiter is so big that the pressure from its gravity and atmosphere compress most of the gas into liquid. In a way, you can think of jupiter as a giant propane tank, but instead of being held in by metal walls, it's held by gravity.
To this day I still wonder what exactly a concussion battery is.
SCPl999
I really it’s from another planet that it is targeting Earth.
What if you drop io on top of the thing
Expectation: can survive in the planet Reality: **gets third degree burns in the storm**
You didn’t mention the decoded message it’s been recently receiving, “stop repairs and resume mission.” Or something like that, I mean, it’s all just a hoax on the internet right? (O5leavemebeplease)
Fat scp
I miss this old animation style I'm not sure if it's Nostalgia, but I like this style a lot better
You know it makes you wonder if half this shit is real and someone is just exposing these
jupiter.. maybe it is the protector
The solution is to create a huge, armed and armored spaceship the size of the planet Earth in the shape of a Jürgengander snake, and launch a surprise attack towards them and prevent them from reaching
Destination Planet has three modifications
How about yours scp 🧐 to destroy scp2399
Guess what? This is a cover story. It was used to kill the broken machine, SCP 001. Look it up.
Wonder what would happen if they showed scp 2399 a picture of the SCP 96 Shy guy
so it got damaged by wacking into one of jupiters moons but cant get BLOWN UP?
stoks
fr.
Welll maybe the doomsday that it fired at Jupiter was a defense mechanism from it having just smashed into IO
I think I have a way to stop 2399 I think if they use a combination between magic and science which is able to take out the ship
Why not decode the language of the Extra terrestrial beings and command the Destroyer to Self destruct?
my idea: i think the sheild will sometimes open when large enough debrie is be taken towards it. or that the sheild is only for repairs. so that if that is true then when it is fully reparied it can be destroyed
wait Jupiter has scp!?
5514 vs 2399! Who’s gonna win?
Try water
Maybe we could use some help from scp 343?
Do some planet videos
And 3 penguins can destroy it
this is the shit youtube allows to happen when you go to sleep with autoplay on. wake up to some far side ass shit.
so we know 2399 and it's drones are protected from " attack/damage" via its weaponry and targeting system ; have they tried " stealing it's pieces" though? doesnt even have to be a " critically necessary piece"  , it could just be a piece of scrap-metal. it'd give the foundation time to analyze and reverse-engineer the components. added benefit , if the operation proves successful , the foundation can literally just keep stealing pieces to PREVENT the destroyer from rebuilding.  cant exactly reattach a communication tower if said tower is no longer on Jupiter to be reattached.
Plottwist: Jupiter is actually an SCP and it likes Earth so it protects it from threats.
*SCP foundation tries to not show this info to public*  *Meanwhile an employee/ person reveals info that should not be shown to public but still shows the info*
using lizard is nice
If SCP 2399 was real we would have 69.205 years left
Throw 682 at it, there, problem solved. Although, 682 might come back even more busted with revenge on his mind...
Type jupiter is looking wild.
Doesn’t help that actual sounds recorded from Jupiter are incredibly ominous and oppressive sounding
「D4C : LOVE TRAIN」or 「WONDER OF U」
First of all I don't remembering watching this video it's like on 6:50
if scp 2399 doesn't have eyes just send scp 173
Now¡!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!¡
Make an scp called the god of reality
What if you help it?
idk if i missed something but jupiter dosent have a solid surface anbd is made up mostly of gas and liquid which also should pull 2399 into the center and it should be stuck there. So did i miss something or is it that the creator of this had little knowledge on jupiter.
just somehow yeet IO to him if its enough to damage it its enough to destroy it
use russia nukes
if nothing can damage it then how did IO  damage it
Bruh this is better than school
Just made a emp and deploy it next scp 2399
when the scp foundation realizes that i know several scps
Could 682 destroy if lief to about it being stronger then him
That targetting system seems to be top notch. Whoever designed the Navi-computer however, belongs on the far side of the airlock
why can't you eat it i saw that short
have u considered using anomalous nukes and quick question are you an 05 site director researcher or what is your employment at the foundation
Is it real?
We need cute scps, plz
go to 294 and type this mouthful:  "liquid that when poured on the floor will create a portal that leads to scp 2399 and will create another liquid that will fall through the portal and destroy scp 2399"
Way to Terminate 2399:  Using Technology or Anomolies to assamble an Orbital craft powerful enough to send 2399 near a magnetar type pulsar star would be enough magnetic pull to dissassmble even completely destroy it
maybe this is why scp unlondon exist because it knows this is gonna ahppen
If one of Jupiter's moons where able to dmg it, you not use one of its moons, if we are able to get the power to destroy our civilisation 1000x over, puching a big rock at high speed at it should do the trick, if not it will push it closer to Jupiter's core with it own magnitude of power should atöeast severely dig it
SCP 2399 vs SCP 179
Wait wait Jupiter has no surface how is the hell is 2399 parts on the ground should it be in air ?
Imagine if the whole reason 2399 was sent to our galaxy in the first place was because the people who constructed it wanted something like 682 dead because they didn't want to risk Earth being destroyed and launching it to another occupied world? Or if they were aware of some other SCP(s) that posed a threat to them and they actually had no intention of threatening Earth's inhabitants?
Man you're just way too cute and cartoony for an scp channel
Hold up what? 1971 have literal Space Ship Message Canceller?
I simp for Jupiter.
Send 682 to it ether it dies or it kills it
I guess Jupiter is pissed off.
Bro when i was atleast 11 i thought scp 2399 was real and is on the great red spot.
Imagine it’s finally able to leave Jupiter, starts coming to earth and just hits one of mar’s moons and crashes there.
Why not ask for help from SCP-179?
Could you imagine if this scp is just a ship being sent to establish peace, but has weapons just in case we attack first (which we do)
idk if this is a way to destroy 2399 but why dont u use the tesla gun on it? if it is too dangerous then throw the minture black hole at it  2399 my try to attack it but it may release the black hole within and swallow it and Jupiter too idk if this may have the risk of disrupting the balance of the solar system but that would be a job for the astrophysicist to predict or just ask 343 for help...by the way he is not god... because he has a desire to experience what its like to be a human...and desire is weakness because god dont need desires or goals or achievements....he is all powerful and not some lesser being hoping to achieve something its an insult to the actual god to think that the 343 guy is him because he clearly said that he wants to experience something....
i fel...                   *nostalge*
So you’re telling me that Jupiter’s storm is an scp man they really are everywhere
Yeah but what about SCP-073? He's powerful enough to destroy the machine since whatever damage goes to him, the damage would reflect back into the attacker.
So what’s the connection between this SCP and SCP-4217?
literally just try to make the gravity try to pull a lot harder
Wait, let's copy their signal and tell it to destroy something else, like new coordinates, etc!!!
We need an SCP that has teleportation capabilities to deliver a small nuke underneath it's shields, anomalously of course!
For being so advanced, it's communications can easily be intercept and blocked.
Get a spike launch it at high speeds if will probably break the shield
Rubber your face is always  cute
2399 couldn't come to earth, it's impossible. how? If 2399 hits io randomly how else would it pass the asteroid belt
67.90869 years to completion.
Wait tell me how the hell guns take these scps in containment?
So glad scp foundation is fictional
I see humanity as a man/woman holding a rock against all of these creatures with the good scps behind it.
They said fake information for the big red spot scp are fake anyways
Thanks Jupiter! You're a pal!
I came up with ideas for SCPs that can get rid of the damn thing but the only problem is that while they can dish out lots of damage, they can't really withstand it but you guys could try using SCP 073 and just pray that he's immune to antimatter
One why do I get the feeling it would be much more easier to stop its progress if you're able to take away the parts that managed got shattered off and keep it away from the SCP and maybe be able to try and capture one of the drones when it's far away or on a different planet so that way the main ships we've been systems wouldn't be able to protect it then it can be studied and see if there are any weaknesses
Warhammer 40k: exterminatotis the ship
It's quite simple on how to destroy 2399: upload a virus to disable its shield and then nuke it.    Yeah I went there.
Correct me if I’m wrong but wouldn’t it be as simple as reactivating the ouroboros project and just deleting scp-2399 from existence?
Hear me out, this could very well backfire and make everything 100 times worse, but if it comes to it we could probably use SCP-079 to infiltrate SCP-2399's automatic repair systems or if nothing else corrupt a drone. We might be able to DDoS this thing or at least buy us some time.
I (Do )Have A Suggestion For The Next Video: SCP-1566, Train Eater.
Your plan to stop this thing is destroy a planet that will sent rocks to earth killing us anyway?
The real Mekhane (one of the older gods) helped us use this destroyer to destroy the Broken God (corrupt Mekhane). You can just tell how much technology beats even the most magical and powerful scp's (since Mekhane is almost as powerful as the Scarlett King).  The struggle of containing scp's on Earth would be a cake-walk for the aliens that sent scp 2399.
why isnt this apollyon
Do you know Jupiter doesn’t have a surface because it’s a gas giant
This sound scary but the more I think critically about it the more really obvious options for it's termination pop into my head. Why not just slingshot IO into it and crush it? Why not retrieve it's parts for study and break those parts down, stopping it from completing repairs while furthering foundation tech? It only fired when it or it's drones were fired upon. Why not trick it using the signals sent to it by it's creators? Decode the programming language and hack it. If it wasted it's payload on Jupiter, what're the chances it even has the capacity to destroy earth anymore? Yea, it's current weapons are super advanced but it's not really like a sudden burst fire of all those weapons at once indicated it was designed for a sustained attack.
Jupiter is a gas giant so it couldn't land on Jupiter
There’s ground on Jupiter?
no wonder its keter, it can literally create and destroy matter like tf
”Gosh dangit Peter I want pictures of 2399”
Wait if the shields are so powerful but it is damaged by jupiters moon there must be some way to destroy it
We don’t need legionnaire all we need is scp 682 to start attacking it then it evolves to let out a pulse so strong it destroys the whole thing
it's crazy to know that this is also what saved the world from the broken God in the second stage of the orboros cycle cause we assume the worst that it'll destroy us but instead it saved us
Imagine if it was 100% repaired and then crash into the moon or missed earth and plunged into the sun😂
scp 2399 is my favorite scp
Jupiter a real one fr
If is indestructible use it on 682
you know that Jupiter is a gas giant and does not have a solid surface so 2399 could not just sit on Jupiter
So what happens 25 years from now?
Has 2399 hit Neptune has well?
that is the coolest representation of scp 2399 ever
Did you know 2399 is the biggest scp
Can't you take scp 2399 in ot a black hole
4:52 why.
So its really just the Cold War all over again.
So it's at 59% repairs, and does so at 0.78% per year, that means the red spot is at least 700 years old, that is assuming its damage was total upon colliding with Io.
What about that vending machine scp use that make a fuel and you could try
Long live the planet Júpiter!
Nobody:  Literally no one:   Subtitles: *SCP FOUNDATION IS THE LAW ON TAX AND CITY TOURS*
SCP 2399: I AM INDESTRUCTIBLE !  IO : SURPRISE MOTHER FCKER
jan 27 is my bday
Question: would Jupiter's thick atmosphere cause the destroyer to burn up and also Jupiter's a gas giant so it has no surface
I don’t think mr rubber knows the actual strength of the red giant
Yah know, they could find the pieces and take them
Would this be a bad time to say the red spot has been getting smaller?
4:51 The Rubber was too sus and got ejected
Dr bob is better ;(
"Drones" not "2399-1"  This SCP is bad, the writing is bad, and the idea as whole is retarded Nice video, nevertheless
We should trace back the transmission and send them pictures of SCP096
Change the sended message and put it virus or put a thing on drones that cannot enter the shield
Command scp 001 the children to destroy it.
Please animate SCP-3854 "Belly of the Playwright"!
Yea right it's better the online class
Jupiter is a real one right now but they could use the lizard not to piggy back or even 106 and 096
This isn't the full story! I thought I was gonna talk about the last man on the moon
If io damaged it  can’t we use the materials from the project to push the moon into it
Wouldn’t scp 001 the gate guardian just obliterate it
Is this real
Welp they failed at Lieing about the red storm
Lolss
Jupiter help us to stop they scp Jupiter well stop they scp end gib us time...
Is this true
so you need to like summon a ton of anomalies to jupiter and let them defeat it (perhaps it can help terminate some anomalies too)
This thing really is just the Ancient ship from Homeworld hah
4:50 Rubber was not the imposter
Sounds like something you would see in FTL or ETB (Faster Than Light Entering The Breach)
I think thats a job for scp 4606
Hatful star aka a scp can be able to protect us again
This is cool and all but on the illustration jupiter has ground when its made of only gas 🤨
🕦🕧🕜🕝🕞🕟🕠🕡🕢🕣🕤🕥🕦🕧
Is this the same thing in the Bismarck's video?
Jupiter don't have ground it is made up of gas...
Among us reference
Fun fact: this is the biggest scp I have found
Just a theory regarding 2399s motives, it could be some sort of vessel sent by an alien race to wipe out other sentient life forms, take their stuff and return with resources. Maybe the 2399 makers suffered some resource shortages due to them having used so much over their existence for such a long time (possibly they are ancient given their level of tech) and therefore had to "harvest " other galaxies so they can survive as a civilization
This SCP reminds me of the "Hashmal" Mobile Armor from Mobile suit Gundam IBO. It and other giant mobile armors like it started something called the "Calamity War", where giant AI who have abilities very similar to this SCP were basically roaming around the solar system massacring entire populations of people. It was sick!
Send Cain
Imagine if everyone on the earth blinks then the peanut kills everyone
Plot twist It's just a space minivan trying to reach alian version of AAA roadside assistance cause they broke down on the way to a fancy space restraunt
Have they tried hitting it with another moon?
id say we use 123 and 914
Can you steal a fragments so there's no material?
Plot twist: a few minutes before it was fix and was going to earth the scarlet kings arrives and it fights the scarlet king and the scarlet king wins and the whole army of whatever alien build that robot fight the scarlet king while we watch with our popcorn
just one question what role are you in the scp organization
SCP Malfunctioning Destroyer 0:25
Earth: why do you have a big red spot on you? Jupiter: Well, it is because of storms. Reality: A literal space ship trying to repair itself.
We love you, Jupiter Senpai.
Just consistently stall there an extra 5 minutes to 500 years DONT SHOT ALL YOUR FIRE POWER AT THE SCP SHOT IT ALL AT JUST THE DRONES AHHHHHHHHH THEY ARE SO SMART IT MAKES THEM OVER LOOK THE OVIAS THINGS
I don’t know if 999 can help.
What about SCP 343? He can help, can't he?
Space SCP must be Keter!
I know how to stop scp 2399 have the barriers equipped with claws and take any pieces found back to earth and reverse engineer them
I wish the that scp is good and protect us all and protect our Galaxy  And i hope that scp,s home is our Galaxy we all hope and please it
i love the thought that if SCPs were real and the foundation was trying to hide them from us, these games and youtube channels would be their worst enemy xDDD
I'm waiting for the day that someone takes this stuff wayyy to literally and starts saying this stuff in class.

The name "The Rubber" has a LOT of common meanings. A unique choice for sure.
Here’s how to kill it that humanity can do magnetise two of the same particle and launch them towards each other once they collide it will create an explosion big enough to destroy this galaxy
The SCP Foundation has the tech and resources, why won’t they just you know…  Take humans to another planet?
You guys are dumb, you have the answer to your problem right in containment
i just heard something when i was playin roblox then i heard scp 096 screaming then he left
Theory elon musk knows
also why not just take 1 of its broken part and sent it far space
why not send 682 to it
What if you go inside the robot
SCP-2399: Imma end Earth....  Jupiter:...and Imma end your career

SCP2399
Mom
Thank Jupiter we alive how u calm in this situation
I have a hard time believing something so advanced could be damaged like this
Since we are technically prisoners in a bubble around a small fraction of our universe, doesn’t that mean they are to? Maybe they were trying to destroy something on earth, or maybe the reason they are on an exact course is to protect it from something, it never showed malice towards earth, it showed malice to being sucked into an off range orbit, trying to probably thrust itself back out of orbit and it fell anyways
there are two reasons i watched this. A. epic content. B. my fan art got in :D
Why not steal 2399 left body parts to keep it and test it what kind of material is it
i like this scp 2399
How does the SCP foundation make time distorting tech but can't make a powerful emp blast
It could be very risky but the only option I see is to put nukes through 914 on very fine
Couldnt a truce be made between the foundation and some XK class scp to destroy it
9:02 me annoying my friends
52 years until its finished damn I wish I could live long enough
If youre wonering its 59.52% currently
It’s not I.O. It’s not an initial. It’s Io.

Gusion : ehh (turning around ) Jupiter : COME HERE ( FRANCO VOICE MODE  ) STRONG BUILD  DESTROYER gusion : AAHHHHH  Jupiter : one shot one kill  Destroyer : malfunctioning destroyer now Io moon : hehehe ( eudoura voice ) Euduora and franco spamming emotes
I wonder if 2399 is the black knight satellite the satellite that appeared then disappeared out of no where
Why can’t they use this scp to destroy scp 682 ????
Didn't it come and destroy or deal with the broken, warped version of Mekhane?
send pictures of 096 to the crew operating that thing.
scp 2399 like a robor
Is this real?
noke
If you're wondering what that new  message the foundation managed to intercept was, it said (i am paraphrasing): Halt repairs. Proceed to third planet.
Just send em a letter saying plz leave
one way we might be able to inflict damage of 2399, is to get massive rocky objects like ceres, and launch those bodies at 2399, after all, the moon Io damaged 2399 in a collision.
The tesla universe reversing bomb can be used to power the emp
Scp 2399: activates and goes to Earth   Mars and the asteroids: helo
Scp-2399: I will Destroy you all Scp-682:Wanna team up
This scp is unrealistic, because Jupiter have no sutfice because It's a gas giant. One who made this have no astronomical skills. Also the great red spot is giant huricane. Astronomy noob! (I now that It's rubbers falt (Just for sure))
Him:no one should know about it Me and the people watching: O_O intresting
I don't know if it's intentional or not, but Jupiter has always saved Earth from big asteroids like the one that wiped out the Dinosaurs because it's gravitational pull is that large.
This is actually my favorite SCP and in my opinion, one of the scariest.
is someone going to tell Rubber that Jupiter has no "surface" (as illustrated by an orange, rocky surface) and is basically just clouds the size of mountains obscuring an endless ocean of liquid hydrogen.
what if we send the lizard at it
Is this real?
A nuke IS an EMP. And he should have left what destroyed it in the first place a mystery, or maybe hypothesize that another technologically advanced party may have intervened in some way. Edit: Just a "n" because my keyboard is fucking broken.
what if they just... take one of the parts of itself that it hasn't found yet?
Or we can try to thow it into the sun
Also how do we get the power is by making sun harvesting machine the only way we can power our weapons is by making a machine to harvest the sun
We can make a large explosion of electrical bons and try to deactivate this thing or we could use the praticals in the atmosphere of Jupiter to open up the barrier protecting this thing
SCP lore: haha SCP- 1548: haha funni barrier go brrrr  SCP-1548- omega(all of the monsters outside of the galaxy): nooooo you cant just put a barrier
One thing we know it that it is of value, it’s not a disposable thing that they have a lot of or it would have been abandoned long ago. So they probably really don’t like earth and humans
so wouldnt it be wiser to try to recover the pieces of scp 2399 and research the technology from those pieces or at least launch these pieces away from earth instead of bringing them back to earth as those repair drones would probably invade
Step 1: Find a broken part from IO Step 2: Destroy that part Step 3: Since there's a part missing and 2399 can not be further repaired, it will stay there searching for the missing part, forever.
Can't they just look for the parts and take it to earth
Wait a minute... how were we able to just casually very closely observe Jupiter's red spot in the 1960s?
Hey I'm on Saturn I'll go check em out!
7:20 its wrapons were so powerful it was able to blast a hole in a gas planet
According to the percentages it should be finished repairing itself in the year 2023.
The SCP foundation: *spends a whole lot of money sending weapons to (unsuccessfully) destroy SCP-2399*  The SCP fanbase: "Have they tried using the lizard yet?"
Why can’t they just use atomic bombs,or napalm bombs?or even antimatter bombs
S P A C E  E G G
And give that message to nasa
Build a bomb that is a 10 qu times more pewerful explosion then the atomic bomb And launch that to jupiter
宇宙GOC説
Wait i just realized that if he's called "the rubber" he is technically a eraser to the bri'tish
Very good question if SCP 2399 had his message blocked and also decoded how come we can't just send a message to scp-2399 to self-destruct
Oh I might know what could do damage to it its called a neutrino bomb
I am apparently in a another multiverse
I like the Among us you got kick out
I dont like the wierd preview thing before the intro. Makes the vid longer for no reason
Jupiter doesn't have a surface that something can just land on though, right?
2399 is indestrucable  Also 2399 broke after hit io,and io still in good condition
Lol why everything coming for earth,what we did to the universe ?
Just do it that will make it dead and I don’t really want it
I think I know a way how to destroy it launch 1000 of the most powerful nukesI want it
Scp-2399 when it completely repaired itself “You feel vibrations from deep below...”
How to destroy it Tell scp 343 to destroy it
hhfd
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
scp  2399
Jupiter doesnt have any surface
scp foundation : any monster we come across is labeled an SCP!
My comment is so late and dumb but send them a picture of shy guy and see what happens
4:51 AmongUs
i love how he is patting that kid on his head its so cute
Bu kanalın türkçesi var mı?
Maybe an weapon like BFG 1000 would Pierce the shild
Wait if the drones are part of 2399 isn't the drones supposed to be called 2399-1
Do on the strongest scp's you have to destroy it
I hate these adds
well. now i know there is a robot inside the largest planet/jupiter.
Drop a moon onto them, that'd would be impossible to block
Tho maybe impossible They should catch a drone on one of the moons and bring it back to earth to examine
The rubber* we do not have a big enough weapon to produce such a intensive EMP*  Russia* glances over at the tsar Bomba( 100 megaton version) well well well!!! Boy do we have a weapon for you guys!!!!!*   Dr bright* excited doctor bright noises*
Could the foundation not just throw a large rock with the composition of IO? Like if I couldn’t shield itself on impact with IO than maybe the composition and or the speed caused the damage.
2399: I'm going to destroy earth! IO: I'm going to end this man's whole career...
I wonder if you can send a pick of 096 and 096 will do the job🤔
Wait a minute… how can the destroyer land on Jupiter
*just think of how weird it would be if the family members of the scp's came to go save their family members*
The rubber : *Trying to destroy the ship* Me : Just destroy all the parts or the whole Jupiter
what all of us are doomed
They should use the glove that can crush the sun... I would think that might do the trick.
It obviously isn't indestructible, use a large enough satellite to slingshot asteroids into the damn thing
You can use the fusion Reaktor in france to Power the EMP.
There should be some effort to collect the pieces of the scp if even possible to stop it from functioning again
well, if it's looking for it's parts, LET'S STEAL THEM FIRST. Find as many pieces of 2399 as possible and bring them back to earth for containment and experimentation.
I love the video and all but if he knows so much about scp’s, he should know that Jupiter is 98% made of gas
Me when I first saw this: I had no idea other planets had moons Me now: Ok
Why not just rip off a huge chunk of io scene it was the only thing strong enough to damage it in the first place and  just throw those chunks at it or just throw the whole moon io itself at scp 2399
Why not just send Cain in a space space up there lol let him get shot xD
i mean if the sun is a sentient why not jupiter?
what is the scp that was "too big"? i recognized scp 173 and 001
my god how many times scientist is saying the truth and your saying its false its false no you are false the rubber your scp animation is allways saying bullshit shit and shit shut down your scp animations its not real
what about we use scp 2521?
what if we could make a gravity field so So Strong Non of the parts Could ever move
what if we controll it or prevent it from communacations to even work or Even attack itself
What if they grab samples of the scp before the scp dose
When rubber is sus
Why don't they just a send a probe to Jupiter's moon IO and search for parts that will be stopping it from  being fully completed then we would have alot more time
9:56 = Us, "accidentally" nuking Jupiter.
Easy way: the sliper
someone knows how the song is called?
Electromagnetic disrupter to destroy shield
Plot twist:they are martians who are Trying another invasion to earth  To make the second martian war After notice that they have be defeated in 1918
Damn Read More
Who can win?  a spacial destroyer that can destroy planets, almost indestructible with most advanced weapons in the universe or big rock
maybe other aliens want to protect us why didn't see aliens in a for years they haven't come  so thats why they come here for help or make allies
maybe they just want to see what's on are splar symtems or do rescearh and want to be friend i suppose and wan't to see what look like
Just get scp 2399 to kill John wicks dog.Thats all you need to do
Make q tiktok😁
wonder if the SCP foundation was able to collect a few pieces of IO (like 10 medium pieces) then made rockets (10) each with the tip as IO pieces and Fat Man the nuclear weapon of mass destruction as the body
And No human is able to go to jupiter only the voyager 1 and 2.AND THERE IS NO SATELITE IN JUPITER BRUHH OMG THE SCP FOUNDATION IS A LIE.
Exposed,Jupiter has no Land So How can it land in the red spot Bruh OMG THE SCP FOUNDATION GOT EXPOSED. Mann i am in a relief because now I know that the Scp foundation is lieing.
These fucking idiots. It's not a destroyer It's a fucking terraforming machine.  It looks like the one from 'Man of Steel'.
Why not use Scp-095-FR aka the demon core
Sounds more like it should be classed as Apollyon from the sound of it.
Well we will never know what SCP-2399 was intended for. Dr.Bright launched on of Jupiter's Moon on it
SCP Foundation's satellites in orbit around Jupiter are to maintain constant vigilance of 2399's reconstruction efforts The satellite: 👀
Moon Champion vs Destroyer
999
Jupiter was like   *Nah Fam*
If they can decode and translate the alien comms instructing 2399 and block them, they understand how the comms with 2399 work, which means they can generate their own fake transmissions, spoofing a command to leave the solar system or even self destruct. Or even better, the foundation can tell it to shut down its defenses, get into 2399 and do a little... renovation, whack a foundation logo on it and seek it on other external threats... combined with scp 179, it would make for an impenetrable defensive system.   2399's continued existence and lack of neutralization or assimilation into the foundation makes no sense when you factor that information in.
Pls make a part 2
So... this tech is armour to scp 4217-2
Imagine humanity finding out about 2399 and trying to declare war on the planet that was responsible for the attempt of destroying earth
Maayyyybebeee ... I ddduuuuuuuunnnoooooo THAT GOD DAMM MINI STAR?!?!?!?
Just have to say.. i am so glad the scp did not wipe that kids memory. What he seen that day most likely changed his life and launched him into a career of paranormal research for life.
Imagine scp 1233 fight this thing *FOR JUSTICE!*
why wouldnt foundation try to leverage the communication protocol is beyond me...
Scp 1000 could stop it
do a video about scp 3700
4:50 AMOGUS
Jupiter is just built differently
we can use other scps to take it down
What just about to shoot the nukes on the ground?
True
A note: Jupiter's moon is Io, not IO. It's not an abbreviation or anything, it's pronounced I-O, but not as separate letters, just Io. Like "eye-yo"
4:51 is where it references among us
LEGIONNAIRE IS SO OP IT CAN KILL SCP 2399
What if we throw Io into 2399? Make its orbit decay so that it ends up smashing into 2399.
This video was published on my birthday! :D
What if we let 2399 with 682
Who else going crazy watching this and just the fact of this is just terrifying
What if the SCP can make new drones if they have more power
There like ants
"I-O"...
Could not watch it because even for this kind of art i have to believe that humans poses instant extraplanetary messanging technology. Kind of shortsided :/
if its in jupiter why would we even care if its like millons kilomiters away?
it is real i analyzed! it is 78% complete!
jupiter is gas Giant witch means it has no solid ground I know this is an SCP animation but I just wanted to clear that up
i would really love to see a 30 to 40 minute video of all of site 13(my favorite scp) so much stuff happens in that story it could be a horror movie
just ask 343 or use another scp thats powerful to get rid of it/destroy it
jupiter is a gas gaint how did it crash in to jupiter
Note: Jupiter doesn't have a solid surface.
Just throw 682 at it and it will solve itself
Scp-2399:(Exist)   Scp-4217: *HE VIOLATED ME, HE WAS MY NEIGHBOR!!!*
Looks like Tony’s Hulk Buster Satellite, Veronica
This looks like some power rangers lost episode
I wish we got an extremely accurate picture of Scp-2399
Classic Jupiter protecting us from asterioids and apparently aliens
bruh just let it vibe
btw, If you didn’t know maybe Rubber will be in Friday Night Foundation
You cannot hide the among us reference from me
Don't sorry guys it's fake
man 2399 almost reminds me of xerath from league of legends
just take 1 piece of 2399 so he will never be complete
We must construct additional 2399s
We must construct additional 2399s
We can steal the parts to stop it
"In Jupiters Lower Area" Isnt Jupiter A Giant Fart Ball ? Isnt Jupiter Impossible To Land On Wouldnt This Thing Fly Into The Middle Of Space
Ight time to move to a another planet
This song may be played every video but it never gets annoying
The alien's want to destroy us because they don't know what we can do and so assume the worst and decide to eliminate us
If this is classified information why are you telling us this then
Bro. If I was one that's apart of the leadership of the SCP Foundation, why not just launch one the moons onto it?  Sure, fuel might not be able to do it.  Why not nuke it to push it, but the gravitational pull might keep it in place
So he's basically like ghidorah mix with an alien ship
Imagine if it was just a scavenger rip💀
Is that why the look out scp179,  is pointing to Jupiter?
Fun fact : the scp foundation isn’t real and it’s all fictional due to google saying “The SCP Foundation is a fictional organization documented by the web-based collaborative-fiction project of the same name. Within the website's fictional setting, the SCP Foundation is responsible for locating and containing individuals, entities, locations, and objects that violate natural law (referred to as SCPs)”
Idea: the EMP and nukes are successful, and shortly after it's destruction, the entire galaxy is destroyed by whatever it was holding back...
Imagine if 2399 is finally able to leave the influence of Jupiter and heads to Earth, but crashes into Phobos instead and has to be repaired on Mars again.
Scp 001 watches this and go's to jupiter and destroys 2399
Hm. Do nuke
why not send missiles that have pulse cannons in each. if you can get them all to hit the target at the same time it would make a pulse strong enough to knock out its force field. Send some powerful blast at it and you could really do some damage maybe even offline it. (yes i know this isn't real but if it was a film that is what I would do)
Can the SCP foundation ask SCP-1233 for help?💗🐱
Why don't they just nuke it?
Wait a minute, Jupiter is supposed to be a fully gas planet.
this vs The Moon Champion when
Just for the kind iformation dr bright somehow "yeeted" the moon IO on 2399 and hence neutralising it.
This is basically the origins of Scp 4217
The machine's gangsta till Bright decides to yeet a moon at it!
*me confused because Jupiter is a gas planet*
so, trying to destroy this thing is like trying to punch a man in knight's armor
Me be like: never go give you up never let you down  Scp: what the heck
make a part 2 video of scp-2399
If the SCP Foundation was real    *TheRubber would be a class d by now.*
Fun fact, this thing was powerful enough to destroy Mekhane, albeit not completed. But still!
IO go brrrrr
Ok...hear me out. You know that machine? Remember when they put a gun in and it came out as an energy weapon? .....put a nuke in.
here is the thing: Dr. bright found a way to send one of Jupiter's moons to scp 2399 and he destroyed it sooooo the class of this scp is now neutralized
jupiter is not a solid planet therfor it whould have sunk inside of jupiter LOL
Plot twist: hello I am a destroyer i just want ur moon
can they use spy's sapper to damage it?
lmao this is like a legendary pokemon 😂
I heard that Dr.Bright threw a moon at 2399 and destroyed it. Is this true?
Wait but Jupiter doesn't have ground?
Ways to kill it 1. Send a moon 2. Send their powerful allied scps 3. Try to hack to command it by human 4. Anything other than destructive weapons 5. Send a moon 6. Send a moon 7. Send a moon 8. Send a moon 9. SEND A MOON 10. S E N D  A  MOON
While the video is about an indestructible destroyer on jupiter The comments are just full of memes and references
I would love that scp to be a allied unit in a game, with its massive health with very high resistance/armor, defence system, drones, and unknown firepower, basically a heavy unit, expensive, slow, tough, poweful, and armed
looks like a yugioh monster
Can you explain scp 2367
Jupiter is more inspiring then naruto
Isnt this just mass effect?
how is there a surface on jupiter its a gas giant
Me : *sees jupiter’s surface*  Me: I thought it was a gas giant.  My world is a lie my life is forfeit!!
What If: the robot came down and started playing 'Rick Astley Never Gonna Give You Up'
Seems like StarCraft prottos
*We* *have* *been* *trying* *to* *reach* *you* *about* *your* *cars* *extended* *warranty*
Is the scp foundation real or fictional
We can used the scp 343 to stop the robot
get the lizard just get the lizard
they literally have a scale sun much powerful tha ours and they used it to charge a giant robot; ¿so why don't use it with the EMP?
SCP-2399 has already reached 100% Completion; I should know, I helped. I sent Interplanetary Omega's to reconstruct it, and it was successful. The end is near for you, your time is quickly running out. Tick tock, tick tock.
This is a pretty cool scp. I'm sure Bright would've just fired a chainsaw cannon on 2399. And a cannon full of chainsaws
Scp-2399: wants to kill earth and humans  Dr bright: ima bout to end this mans whole career
What of they just steal pieces of Scp-2399 that were undiscovered and just steal them and inspect them to see its technology
Use scp 001 ex to destroy it
They could just take part of broken alien ship and take it to earth aliens will search forever bit it wil never find because it is on earth
now we know why NASA wont send astronauts to Jupiter
I’m actually scared
Wait isnt jupiter is a gas giant
4:51*among us reference*
Send 096, 106 or the hard to destroy reptile. Gruss Kendoka2
Maybe it’s a gift not everything is bad
Ok so hear me out:   Wasnt there an scp that was a mini black hole?    Yeet it in the destroyer
If the thing is destroyed what if they send another thing
Is it real?
hhha amon gus
Honestly just send one of the God level SCPs up there after they are asked nicely to do so.
i thought SCPs weren't real?
It would be good plan to send pics of scp 096
so it cant be destroyed so prevent its repair clame all its broken debre and hide it somewhere preferably no on earth
4:50 TheRubber was the imposter
is it ok if its fanmade scps?
How about you use SCP 343 to create a bomb to destroy that SCP
How can we help?
Imagine we are ACTUALLY going to be attacked because we were the one who attacked it first, trying to destroy it
4:50 the rubber was not the impostor
Oh, what did Dr.Bright do again?
If they can decode the messages it was being sent, then why not try to make a message telling it to self destruct.
Imagine if it lands 1k away from scp 001
can the foundation just use scp-682 ,scp'343 or scp-001 to terminate that scp ?
Why not reverse analyse the messages  and send it our own message to stop the operation
4:50 sussy reference
Wait can't you get help from SCP 343 to destroy him or power that thing
Wait but Jupiter is only a gas ball HOW THE HECK CAN PIECES BE STANDING
It was broken in the battle with the nuther god when it was part of the machine god
Can they just take some lost pieces of the ship and plant bombs in it and when they reach the ship they bomb it since it can’t active the shield ?
rubber: it might be left vulnerable by a powerful enough emp pulse, unfortunately, this technology does not exist yet EMP puslers:AM I A JOKE TO YOU
4:51 AMONGUS
If SCP 2399 would of reach earth  it would cause a XK end of the wolrd class scenario
Why does the thumbnail look like undyne is attacking the scp-
20 Years Later: *Jupiters Great Red Spot is gone* SCP-2399: *oh shit-*
I find one of the few flaws in in the SCP universe is the lack of adaptation and learing curves. Mankind remains on the same lvl even if it would be possible to incorporate at least some SCPs into the technological advancment, yet they are isolated stories by nature so it won't happen.
Well everyone watching this in 2021 we know why there is aliens in the sky
69 THOUSAND LIKES LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO
scp-294 (the coffee machine) could technically extract parts of scp-2399 in liquid form cup by cup
They dont know how to power it. But they have SCP-037. Not to mention scp 5514. They have all these anomalies at their disposal yet they resort to bombs.
What if we send a command to it ._.
Loved it!
Well the rubber.In the 1600’s a man actually observed  the malfunctioning destroyer crash into Jupiter.That was before the scp foundation found it
If they intercept the message that means they found a frequency WHY THE HELL YOU WONT REENCODE A MSG AND ORDER A SELF DISTRUCT AFTER IT LEAVES OUR SOLLAR SYSTEM
Why is 4217 aware of it?
Or use the other scps to destroy it
How did it land to rest in Jupiter? There is no surface in Jupiter its just gas.
No one can go to the Jupiter dumb
Find The Parts And Destroy It Before The Repairers Find It So It Can Miss A Lil Bit Of Piece Of It's Completion And Slow Down It's Stuff  Use The Bit Of The Mini Sun And Grab A Lil Big Of It
I wonder if it has dawned on anyone that in 25yrs it'll be up and running again to destroy us, from when the order was given in 1196 fast forward 25yrs and well it's 2021! 😶
then if it got hurt by Jupiter’s moon IO would the materials on IO be able to hurt it ?
Do I hear the orborus kids 🤔
Why don't we used scp to terminate other scps,like if we literally have scp god,ask him how to defeat it
gosh even this plot sounds better than repetitive hollywood movies stopping a war machine that does nothing but repairing itself
0:40 does this belong to the ship who showed the same picture?
Maybe the Zara bamba
Maybe they should try a nuke
What if this was a test from the civilisation that sent it to see if we would attack or turst
Scp = 🧢
Yeet a moon AND the giant lizard at it!
OK, this thing sounds VERY Gamilan...floating continent anyone?
This is still, by far, the best video from The Rubber in my opinion. Great work!
They should collect the pieces before the drones can
8:30 you know it's powerful when even the creator doesn't know what it is made of XD
How do you know about all of this
Is it a sk class event ?
Boom
Bruh if it is real i sugested to attack it while it was 100% charged, as it was broken by a moon.
jupiter is made ouut of gas it doesnt have land noob
the teachers lied!!! 2399 is the great red spot!!
Make SCP 1507 story
Show the drones a pic of the big tall white guy can’t remember his number
Octo-Drone: *Exists*  BARRIER Unit 45: “I’m gonna end this thing’s while career”  SCP 2399: “Lemme Stop You Right There” BARRIER Unit 45: “guess I’ll die”
. . these are fake right? 👁👄👁
Just make rockets and move earth bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
I mean plenty of others scps could just (poof) also like.... just test emps on the smaller drones and size it up for it to destroy the thing
SCP-2399: *exists*  SCP-179: Not in my watch
Why the bismark SCP show 2399
SCP- 2399: Earth or Bust  Jupiter:  *_THICC_*
Thanks IO - very cash money of you
Wait, jupiter has no surface, so 2399 should be 100% dead rn.
Jupiter really said "NO YOU SHALL NOT HURT MAH FRIEND"
What if all scp vs scp 2399
So we need a power that can crack a planet. Anyone wanna strap engines to a giant asteroid or a smaller moon and YEET it into 2399?
I got this on Akinator  Rare Object     so i wanted to know about it😂😂
What do you think on how to destroy this scp? Reply to this comment so I can read them. I think that if the foundation can't destroy it. Well they can move it into the SCP 039 dimension
humans: lets send bombs SCP 2399: *dude*
4:52 among us reference
The aliens when they realize they forgot to send peace messeges before sending 2399: oh fu-
Me a intellectual: ask scp 343 for help
The fact that gun is useless
Its 4am why am I watching these
Its 4am why am I watching these
Wait until it starts launching because its shield will likely turn off and then send the emp
If only the Sun Sister warned us about it... wish her range extended beyond Pluto
Chucky Chucky game on media it was in the media and there was an artifact in the lava by divers that someone him the media
Jupiter is a gas giant tho
You can use scp-93 make a big glass wall and when scp-2399 come close to glass wall use scp- 93 then he will went to other world then our earth will saved
we can use the red sea object so it will never reach our earth it is already destroyed
How could you send there drones into a big planet fully made of gases when the first rockets were barely able to fly even to the moon around 1960???
Damn thing looks like a marker from dead space
The robot use the freaking close weapons do you store a knife like this she will only work out not inside the maybe you pick them up and then we want to find it stop it close wings wrestling like knife I think your sharpener who help
If a collision with IO could damage this thing then a few hundred nukes could stomp this xenos scum.
SCP-2399: Sorry we’re late. Now, where can we find this hentai we’ve heard so much about?
Waut how and why did this fought  the broken god...can it teleport? does it even really  care about earth?
The rubber patting/smacking the person's head, lol
9:44 lmao the bombs exploded but not on the red spot where 2399 is. subtle animation slip up there
"It's indestructable!" *2399: Breaks on collision with IO.*
How are they making videos even though this footage is like redacted
It could be a Protoss building
Idea: Bring de lizard! >:)
4:51 The rubber was not a inposter
AMONG US SUS
DUDE SCP 2399 HAS BEEN FULLY PREPARED BE REDY BOIS
I would to send an scp like the invincible beast on jupiter and hope he could destroy it
2050 Astronaut: Hey see that thing? Astronaut2: yeah its probably a weird russian thing.
Pls make scp 4666 pls
Plot twist: They just want to take all of the pizza
is this a real story or fiction.
people: 2021 is gonna be a better year! 2021:
This is the most beautiful speech ever 👏👏👏👏👏
You can tell it to scp 343 also known as “god”😁😁😁😁
put a M.U.T.O on jupiter while its in a space suit, 2399 would be done for
hmmm.. this "coincidentally" looks like a fortnite bot 🤔😂
It looks like Tony Stark’s lost weapon
and if that doesn't work try sabotage
try using nukes
5:36 that sounded like Zanes quotes in ninjago Protect those who cant protect themselves            -Zane
SCP foundation: *uses false Information to hide the truth about SCP-2399 from the public* Me who learned the truth from a YT video: *infinite iq*
Why is there so much information on nothing?... Some of this stuff has/had to be real
So school lied to me about the red storm in Jupiter.........-_-
But wats the connecrion with the bismarck?
ok so everything i know about the red spot is wrong
Hope earth is not destroyed
SCP-2399 It has colors of dry blood and biohazard poison. The ship and the workers are a colony in a mission, they focus on repairs and defenses for now. Copy the drones blueprint schemes and make a replica to be driven by robots. Until then we have to know the language they use. They also might try to search for our language. We need something combined of solar power + electricity + magnetism + symbols + dimensional stabilizing beam(we can shoot music at them, they look sensitive in some aspects).  Exorcist Angel ^3^
Surprise jupiter is also scp item made by who knows what to protect earth
Is no one going to talk about how it looks like those things from fortnite’s marvel season
🤔😐😑😔😕😟🙁☹
Uh I'm not sure how Dr bright did this but he somehow was able to throw Jupiter's moons IO into scp 2399 long story short scp 2399 has been neutralized
4:50 amogus
This video proves that scp is non-existent and fiction based for anyone still skeptical of its existence. The great red spot is just a large tornado and high speed winds, if 2399 uses its antimatter technology, the great red spot should've been deformed.
this vs peanut boi
Why don’t we just release a scp that’s capable of destroying scp 299 but is still cooperative with the foundation
Scp people can just find missing parts of that  scp and take it or terminate those parts to make it not recover
Sorry but then how does the whole broken god shenanigan fit into this?
fact SCP-2399 is a guardian how i know? in the red spot on jupiter in the middle  theres a scp has ability to control earths core witch means THE END OF THE WORLD
how is this a scp if its a alien
......  But could it fight the lizard ?
this is just a destroyer, image a cruiser ,or even battleship
I think that can beet and destroy scp 2399 it scp 3411  Aka super spays Godzilla that he nice to human
Plot twist: while 2399 is heading towards Earth after it has recovered, it intercepted Io's orbit and hit Io and fell to Jupiter again
:I scp 2399 are undefeatable , bomb not working , laser doesn't work too
scp 2399-1 the big version scp 2399-2 repair drone
scp 2399 cool man !!
There is a 0.000000000000001% chance that an anomalous object hitting Jupiter would go unnoticed so if it is EVEN real then it was discover much earlier than said😤 I rest my case  Edit:I have calmed down and we are creating Technology at rates that are doubleing every single second so there is little to worry about  Joke: just throw moon Ganymede close enough to catch scp 2399 to get pulled in then throw it out of the solar system btw your welcome
What if it’s made to help the foundation 🤔
throw the moon io at it again or 682 one of the biggest problems will be taken care of with 682 maybe both will be solved who knows
How did found it in the first place? 🤔
So we can argue that the anomaly turned jupiter into a gas giant?
Use "Gate Guardian" or "SCP 682" , maybe any other *Super powerful* SCPs , they have thousands of super powerful anomalies that can eliminate the universe , so they will be able to kill each other , right ?                        Or I guess contact the SCP writers .
what if they just blow the planet up and not the robot
You see the mesage its triyng to help us to kill all scp your wrong ruber
A it crashing into planet damaged it so I assume this one should be easy to deal with.
I wana know which scp besides gate guardian can destroy this?
I think the foundation should collect the parts  and make one weapon it might be effective against it I think
Imagine if it was real... Worldwide panic.
Foundation: What are we going to do to get rid of this thing?!?  SCP-914: If you need a laser cannon just put a regular cannon inside me, Turn it to very fine and you will get your weapon to destroy that thing! Edit: Seriously tho, how has the foundation not taught of this
TheRubber was not The Impostor
Just throw the dang moon io again!
Me: *looks over the situation* Me: *rings SCP-662* Me: “Mr. Deeds, bring me the Infinity Stones.” Mr. Deeds: *brings the infinity stones* Me: “Mr. Deeds, bring me Tony Stark’s Infinity Gauntlet.” Mr. Deeds: *brings Tony Stark’s Infinity Gauntlet* Me: “Bye bye, SCP-2399.” * SNAP *
We should try making a portal and make new civilization
I don't like The Rubber. He is too square.
Scp-2399 be like:oh shit I hit a moon near Jupiter and now I hit Jupiter and I'm only 59%done still have another 25years to go from now dammit
whats up rubber
Just send something to steal a broken part so it dose not fully recover
4:51 the rubber was not the impostor
This is my favorite scp, it just is so interesting
Plot Twist: scp 2399 was camping on mars and waiting for full HP
This guy is leaking too much secret information....but we can't find the security breach in our system to fix it!
FAN FICTION; YOUR UP
I hope it's not real :(
Wait can you talk about an scp that object class is appolyon
i know why not drop scp-409 on it
Plot twist: they come for scp-999
4:51 The rubber was not the impostor
I do have an idea to stop this thing. Okay so it smashed into IO and basically shattered right? Since alot of parts are scattered on IO and orbiting jupiter and its moons. We should send another sattelite, intended to identify, capture, and send these parts to earth for study. Should we gather enough of them, it may be possible to make a weapon powerful enough to destroy it. God knows how well this would work, perhaps its like fashioning a crude knife compared to to a minigun compared to their tech. Sure, technically lethal. But we gotta hope luck is on our side. -NOTE! this is just sharing my thoughts i dont actually believe in scp lol.
SCP-1548 would easily destroy SCP-2399  SCP-1548 is basically protecting the solar system and its really powerful.
Just grab the parts
Who would’ve thought the hulk buster armour was an SCP
star wars episode be like: i must copy cause why not?
DO THESE THINGS EXIST
Dr. Bright, Maniacs, & Few Others:  YEET THE MOON!!!! WOOOA!!! SLAM DUNK BABY!!! OH YEAH!!
Simple, make miniature black hole and fire it
SCP-2399 *Exists* Clockwork Machine: *LAUGHS IN MATTER DESTROYING GUN*
Its really the SCP all of them and those people protect them its real or no..
If it was real then where Dead meat
I’m glad that  Scp aren’t real right?
So that's what makes the red spot    Lofl
Make an episode about scp 5167 among us
Perhaps they could use one of the other SCPs to neutralise it? You know 'fight fire with fire?
Dumb question because I'm scared now is this real and where all going to die in 25 years or it just fake and I'm over reacking  Also what if it was just passing through and the messages to repair the damage was so It could leave but when they couldn't contact it so they got mad     And ordered it to kill us
ت︎Coolت︎
ت︎cool
We would definitely need deku who has the quirk one for all to destroy the scp
SCP Foundation logic:if someone tries to protect their should from an attack they are *EVIL*
Solid ground on Jupiter? Nooo
I suggest that they use the good scps help like send able in a contaiment that will be thrown on jupiter and destroy him aka scp 076
wait a minute you said IO damaged it right?
Scp jupiter is ham on dark and it is name is scp 2399
Ok idk if I missed something but it doesn’t take a day to get to Jupiter. Atleast 2 years or more depending on the type of space travel
Just wondering😅
Scp 001?
Have you tried remotely placing a small nuke on the inside of a part and make sure it is on then remotely detonating it??????
,
Just nuke it
Thank god scp isn’t real
Just steal 1 part
fucking faeck bitck
scp 999_CU
Iron man
that is cap not truuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue bruu
Big bro Jupiter saving out bacone yet again. Personally I think they should gather the remaining parts before the drones find them and while they're at it try to decipher the alien language. If they pull it off, maybe they would be able to send a command for the destroyer to self destruct
I could probably think of a way to engage the SCP but I'd take roughly 10 hours to finish it and I'm a lil lazy
JUPITER IS A GAS GIANT D:<
Wait...the bismarck I remember now that the bismarck say or show to the scp foundation the red spot in hes "memories",can be that the 2399 was send to destroy whatever thing is the bismarck
how to explode a part of scp 2399                      i think                                       GET CLOSER AND CLOSER LIKE 1 CM AND BRING A NUKE COZ THE SHIELD HAS A SIZE                                                                                              i think
Make a video on scp 1079
they could power there weapons with a neutron star
You know, there are so many SCPs that are essentially ticking time bombs counting down to doomsday, it kind of makes me suspicious. Lots of false-flag files in the record is part of the Foundation's MO, we know that from the 001 proposals. What if all these "the end is nigh" files are also false-flag data, trying to keep people so worried about one "inevitable" end or another that they fail to see what the Foundation itself is really up to.
You:oh yes among us noises is good nobody will notice Everyone: among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us among us!!!!!!!!!! Noise:Ejecting
wall
I Imagine scp 179 just looking at it lmao
Again! Why couldn’t 343 stop this?
then why not use gravity against it? gravity destroyed it once why not use again? and plus im pretty sure humans these days can even create blackholes even if its  just for buying some time you guys are making advance tech stuff while forgeting about laws of physics
What about a NUKE, would a nuke work sense it’s radioactive and send tons of heat
They kan use 2409-B
What if 2399 was actually trying to get to something on earth like what if it’s trying to get the 7deadly war criminals
They should just ask the bigfoots for help
Wow scare I want to meet them but only a safe scp
why does 2399 not just shoot the things that are trying to stop it from repairing its self
Haven't watched you in a while. Hope you're doing good, man.
Jupiter is gass
anser is nucks
"eliminate"
Wait isn’t Jupiter just a massive gas giant?
4 leged insect SCP: SCP-2086
I hate it when they add anime faces to robotd
im1128ribothethepares
Do you want to eliminate Jupiter
The rubber was NOT the imposter
Why can't we use the MEGATON bomb to kill it?
Use SCP-343/God just stop it or to power the EMP
I wonder if they could use SCP 343 to get rid of it
SCp 2399 is probably my favorite Keter...especially after listening to the SCP Foundation podcast
This is extinction threat level
What will we do from scp 2399
Just collect its parts before the drones can
They should send the indestructible lizard to fight it either it works or the lizard dies its a win win Or  If it can travel it earth try to redirect it to the gate keeper if it kills the gate keeper people can rush in their world or the alien will enter and the portal will close and tada killing 2 birds with 1 stone
No way it in jupiter's lower_amoshpere
Wait didn't scp_4217 the octopus battle ship say something about the red eye of Jupiter? It might have connection with this scp.
What if it was like the type 1 Goa’uld energy shield(from stargate) and slow moving object could pierce the shield? That would then allow an arrow tipped with a nuclear warhead to pass through in theory
I know my comments won't care t scp cannon, but reversing the decoding of intercepted messages would allow the scp to give orders to 2399
i get a A+ on my  science bc i tell about SCPs and dis one got me a big pass  :D
Send another SCP
Someone got this idea from titan AE lol
8:08 how is it a race if it takes 24 hundrend year to recover bruh ur wont even be alive then
Bro it kills me how many times y’all just don’t give info,like what was the second message
Why not use the hard to destroy reptile  to get rid of it just tell the reptile you will give it it's own personal planet Jupiter if he dose
rubbert you  are so cool
Is this real or just a joke
Plant rocket boosters on one of jupiter moon and direct it for impact on the destroyer.
3:27  SCP-2399: "dont touch my fucking son"
I thought jupiter is a gas giant or a failed star but if jupiter is a gas giant how would jupiter ever have a land gas is not ground
looks like a Fal'cie
Why not use 2117 to engage it if it threatens earth? It would be an epic spaceship battle.
They can destroy things
Instead of EMP they could use gamma rays
Wow anti matter
4:51 TheRubber was not the Impostor
4:51 *AMOGUS!!!*        WHY!?
Jupiter always save the day
SCP-2399: **activated**  "golden wind starts playing"
was there a fake freaking crack on the screen? cause i thought my screen was cracked ... thats so evil
Are all SEP‘s actually real in my reply say yes or no
Jupiters had enough of earth's shit like a pandemic and interstellar exploration
Ok I don't understand one thing... They have all sort or creatures... Gods included... Just send one and see what will happen
Terrible and lazy animation.
Why don't they go up to SCP-179 (Sauelsuesor) and ask her for guidance. She might be able to help? 179 is Thaumiel after all.
Jupiter doesn't have a solid surface how is the rubber even standing on there
*me realizing the time is passed and we are not dead* me: wait a minute
Fun fact in danish Europa ( May be spelt wrong) means Europe
You know what SCP 2099 may not be trying to kill us it could give us a gift.  These guys are moronic idiots
Bruh this dude says EMP bombs arent possible just make some high voltage and you're chillin...  EMP is very possible, you just need some high voltages
in fact that this is related to one of the scps too...
hey rubber theres one SCP you did not make video ScP  THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN BUT I DONT KNOW THE NUMBER
As entertaining as this is, it was written by a person that unfortunately lacks the knowledge of astrophysics or orbital mechanics, and the understanding of information technologies.  The elephant in the room is that SCP-2399 is extragalactic in origin and that it is communicating by means of electromagnetic waves (AKA radio) with it's point of origin - this would make extremely difficult if not impossible, due to the fact that radio waves travel at the speed of light. Any intergalactic radio transmission would take billions of years to reach our nearest neighboring galaxy, assuming that it doesn't dissipate, refract under gravitational influence, or become absorbed by various celestial bodies. This means of radio communication would require amounts of energy multiple orders of magnitude greater than it is necessary to destroy a planet, or even a star system for that matter. As SCP-2399 has been produced by an extraterrestrial intelligence, it is a statistical impossibility that they use the same architecture or even principles in computational technology, and factoring in the intergalactic communication capabilities, and immense technological and historical disparity between our civilizations, it would be impossible to comprehend or decipher the communique in question...  And I'm just scratching the surface here - SCP-2399 is made of a material that can withstand the pressure of Jovian lower atmosphere, but becomes damaged by crashing into IO? How exactly was the object observed in the 1st place, since lower atmospheric strata on Jupiter are completely obscured by it's upper atmosphere? What about Jovian gravity? If SCP-2399's drones can just nonchalantly break out of Jupiter's gravity well and just float around looking for parts to facilitate repairs, it would be quite probable that they would be capable of completely replicating SCP-2399 in the first place. How do the human satellites manage to shoot a projectile fast enough to deorbit it from high Jupiter orbit, and so accurately that they almost manage to hit the damn thing? What are the projectiles made of to withstand aerobraking in Jupiter's higher atmosphere? How come recoil from firing doesn't eject the satellite from the Solar system? Just how much energy do these human made satellites even have at their disposal? How'd you manage to send out so many in such a short amount of time, since it takes 7 years to reach Jupiter orbit? And how did you build and launch a rocket 5 times larger than Saturn-5 without anybody noticing and panicking into a nuclear war? And how do you plan to fire an EMP past the Jovian magnetosphere without it dissipating? Also, how do you plan to aerobrake the nukes without them disintegrating from physical stress?  Why don't you just use another one of God tier SCP's to destroy the damn thing? I mean, we got demonic girls, teleportation gates and continent sized invertebrates and whatnot back in the foundation, and you're telling me this thing is indestructible??  And the biggest question of all - if you have the technology to travel faster than light, why not just toss a giant meteor of tungsten at relativistic speeds and make a so-called Relativistic Kill Vehicle, AKA ecocidal weapon of mass destruction? No stress, no fuss, just chuck it really really fast and it'll ruin somebody's day with no discernable warning whatsoever.
What if they throw a place of scp 409 near a part then it would crystallize the part and the repair drones will pick it up take it to the  Ship then would crystallize the whole ship and the would turn the whole thing to a crystal and break a part maybe easy as that
....how is that high technology cannot dodge the Jupiter
did you just say I-O instead of Io?
Aaaa that looks like a space fighter ship
Jupiter's powerful magnetic field acts as a buffer against EMP weapons. It is highly unlikely that a device of sufficient strength could be developed on Earth. Suggest you look for solutions in Uranus.
This thing looks like it's something from a sci-fi game or movie
Anyone else think it looks like creestellia
:)
Lol rubber us
How did it get from Mars to Jupiter?
What happens if you put a bomb(or some kind of wepon) in scp 914 tho
You do realised, that jupiter is a lump of gas compiled by a force of gravitation, light years away from earth, outside of the asteroid belt. Right ?
It'd be funny if it was actually sent to protect us and to stop other SCPs like SCP-2317.
juptier has no surface
you cut the new message It reads basically "Stop repair functions, proceed to target, destroy"
Stealing it's missing parts
2399: im gonna destroy earth  682,343,096: *omai wa mou shinderu*
Plsss 1000B YEARS
my recommend to that guys is they must build a prison for that dude and do not let it find the lost parts
The aliens are aware of scp-001 but because of the distance they cant travel to our galaxy. They have sent 2399 as a defensive measure against the keter event.  It will to help us but should we fail it will destroy our solar system as a safety measure.
Is this real?
Pretty sure a hydrogen bomb could silence that thing.
If the SCP foundation tried to keep this a secret, well then they're doing a "great" job!
My advice, send the lizard on a pod 🤣
SCP 001
I HATE THAT!!!!!
Oh god
WHAT?!
Wait two scp lives on Jupiter one the big eye two robot that shoot laser wait wait wait on last second the robot fight the thing and the eye was go in earth and brainwash and remember now and want's revenge wow
This is my new favorite scp
Eraser man. Make SCP 2019
Nuke it.
Reject earth return to space
Scp illustrated did such a better job going into detail than this. This is way too dumbed down to respect it.
Why does this look like Xerath Requiem
Scp662
Just throw every SCP at it. Like killing 4000 birds with one stone.
*Just use the Camera SCP*
Am I the only questioning how this works because Jupiter is a gas giant? Am I just cringe?
Imagine if it's here to ship pikpik carrots and it needs repairs
Use codename "God" or other scps to destroy it
As markiplier said space is so coo oo oo oo ool
Well someone suggested sending fake messages but ı also have a idea. Why we just dont collecting red scraps with our own drones? İf its drones cant find all pieces then they cant fix it completely, just sabotage the repair progress as a backup plan, if after the object become less dangereous then you can give pieces back to it or even you can try to complete it!,
What if SCP-2399 is a Destroyer built by precursor alien race to destroy other or certain SCP's that would be a threat against them or any sentient living creatures in existencee.
lets hope you DIDN'T test nukes on it, because i don't want to know that an atom destroying bomb can't scratch it
Fake.
But what if jupiter is destroyed
Why don't we just throw scp-682 at it at least one of them will be destroyed.
*YEET THE MOON*
Why dont they just send a deadly SCP to Jupiter?
No wonder why sometimes Jupiter is mentioned as the protector of earth
Why didn't they asked nicely to 343 to do this job instead?
This video is sponsored by: God knows what
Please tell me this is fictional.
may the god scp could do something like that
Ask god
i mean we arent even sure its targeting us
This is alien.
This is real?
Watched this while my mic on
It would be funny if the aliens from another galaxy had their own scp problem and was trying to contact earth for help since we are the only intelligent beings nearby
Water might destroy it ...🤔
Do... do they know that jupiter doesn't have a surface for anything to land on. It's a gassy planet, litteraly a big ball of gas
This story seems to portray the Foundation as having literally no anomalous tech mastered at all lol
or what about an asteroid bennu or a planet to destroy scp 2399
dr bight is the next weapon
use scp 343
what if one planet hit jupiter and distroy scp 2399
Just throw 682 to 2399. One will destroy another.
4:51 We love the among us sounds
we could just let dr. bright send one of the moons of Jupiter in to 2399
love the among us reference
I don’t think the other SCPs would let 2399 just wipe out earth before they do.
4:51 TheRubber was not the imposter
Scp 2521 plzz
Scp is not real
Laser
do you know who can destroy that thing? Scp-343
I say we try our luck with SCP-2501 and a telescope, and hope we don’t squish Jupiter out of existence
nuke jupiter
One night during a meateor shower I saw a bunch of colored lights in the sky in the shape of a humongous hawk
Couldn't they use one of the many reality-altering or godlike peaceful SCPs to destroy it in a blink of an eye?
If it is a threat why not get another scp to confront it
y is now see that we are going to die soooo!
Why they don't use Tesla (the ray, not the car) tachnology? That contains enough energy to deactivate and destroy a car, even i know that that thing is too strong we'll have to try a bomb full of Tesla energy. That is my opinion though...
all we need to is to dig to the core of jupiter and maybe 2399 will burn
i think i have a way to destroy it
The trianglium galaxy actualy exists search it up
By the math the soonest that the machine would be capable of destroying earth at full capacity would be 2015 of repair given that they would use the machine when fully repaired
bruh i will be 46 at the time its repaired i dont wana die well at least it will be in a cool way right???
Why does S.C.P. 2399 look like it is something from Star Wars?
Wait they have reality warping scps don't they?
Plot twist: After, it went in the wrong way and hit Triton, and after that fixes, it will just use the sun's gravity to then just orbit around the sun eventually hitting Neptune
Is scp are real??
Has anyone thought about creating a fake drone or shooting a fast or light speed tiny bomb? Or at least find the prices and put mini bombs in it? No? Welp guess they tried
When
IO helped us now WE PUSH IO TO IT AND DESTROY IT HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
Welb we oof
I wish SCP was real... id gladly like to die to that destroyer than die to 2021
...what if they sent in.... The lizard  I'd like to know what would happen if they did. Would Scp-2399 kill it?
Just toss Dr. Bright at it
That was a bit scary
Me as planet lover  Whoa whoa whoa whoa solid rocks on jupiter     The rubber: yes
You can’t tell me that 4:51 is not funny. UwU
"THE RUBBER IS AN IMPOSTER" XD
Alien technology is like “Damn exploding bugs, I just wanna chill and repair and say hello to small flesh people”
Can you tell me pls
Wow 😮 how do you know about scp
ik this is fake but if it was real id just try to find the peices of him before his drones find them
Can’t they use other entities to destroy this thing? You know, the ones that can destroy the world with the blink of an eye?
why not use god to help them
4:51 Barrier Array unit 45 was not the impostor. 1 impostor remains.
Imagine if 2399 reaches earth and blasts Rick Astley's "Never gonna give you up". That would be the most dedicated rickroll to ever exist.
More Apollyon SCP please
If scp-2399 is real and fully functional... We are all gonna die
Try scp-343
Fun Fact: Scp 2399 is connected to the last man.
YOU what
IO damaged it once it probably can again, let’s just drop IO on the damn things head.
Rubber i knew you know all the scp stuff
I like how the scp looks like
I am Death! I Am Destruction!  Dr. Bright: Bold words for someone in moon crashing distance.
Shout out for my boy Jupiter from stopping all of us from dying for now
this is kind of like the ultra beast from pokemon
Guys I think that's the impostor
You have to destroy scp by scp
*A single keter scp breaks out* Give up humanity is dead
Use  bots size of a ant with mini nukes
Use uranium 238 as battery
Da world is gonna end WHAT THE HELL
In reality it's a race between Year 2022 and SCP-2399 of who will destroy earth first.
What if we throw 682 at it
4:51-The Rubber Was Not The Impostor
if scp 2399 can wipe out earth so it need to rerate at apollyon rank
They could push one of Jupiter’s moons into it
Why don’t they just ask 343 to terminate it, much like they did for 682?
3:08 ANCIENT DEBRIS?1? 1?
if scp 343 also known as god if he can summon stuff then why not make him create a indestructible border around jupiter or use him to make a emp strong enough to destroy the force field
but how did it land on jupiter without you know LAND on jupiter did it land on gas???
maybe just use scps maybe?
4:50    Of course he had to make a reference of Among Us
Pew pew drone be like:YOU CANT KILL ME WITH HIGH GROUND.wait they where among us eject noises
maybe is weakness  is a laser mega  or mega nuke
Probably a device used by aliens to monitor us
SCP-2399: *Threatens to destroy Earth*  Jupiter and Io: no ❤
I think that this SCP should have Apollyon class or Archon. For now due to its overwhelming firepower and great defence system and and place where it is foundation can’t even get close to it
Um rubber is this real or fake
This is not real right
I know how they connect, good Bluetooth, or Redtooth
I did the math. We canonically have only *_50 fucking years_*
WHEN THE ANOMALY IS SUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
you cannot disprove this
They just want some anime titties.
Hi
"Its currently indestructible" scp 387 im bout about to end this mans whole career.
Vid idea: SCP-000 The Project
Jai Shri Ram...
TheRubber: *2399 can be in public* Also TheRubber: *makes vid on youtube* Scp foundation: well f*ck       Oh yeah and dis my comment okok
Do anyone that don't khow, a dr name bright literally destroy the thing by hitting it with one of the Jupiter moons
sooo red spot is caused by scp but not in real life?
I bet you will not give me pin.
kinda contradicts itself is that nothing seems to be able to damage it but it got damaged by bad driving
I see your problem have you tried attaching a boom to whatever comes out of 2399 and let it explode when it goes back into 2399 to see what would happen?
Hmmm if we dont destroy it in time how about we reflect the laser thing at it?
When Warhammer tactics are acceptable, Point every modern weapon we have at it, begin testing trials . The overconfident super computer starts laughing at us. Fast forward to years Super computer is now sending out SOS signals to home world. Send reinforcements shields are getting low,  estimated time of Shields failing six years, two days ago humanity figure it out how to do damage to my shields The weapon that succeeded is now being built on a massive scale. I fear they will continue to upgrade their weapons until they..... Activating self-defense protocol. Multiple ships launch from earth detected. Requesting reinforcements.......
Finally, more *MEMES*
Try and the EMP or gamma or beta radiation based computer virus
70% completion you say?            69% sounds about right.
What if a super powerful SCP comes to destroy scp 2399 and the scp is nice
Can you do scp-001
scp:ima end this mans whole carrer   ME:n o  scp: y e s  Me:runs away
You know when he was reading out the part where he said, "The SCP Foundation helps people who can't help themselves," I thought he was talking about a translation of a code sent to the destroyer. How cool would it be if the destroyer is from an alien world's SCP Foundation who is sending it there to battle something that the Foundation doesn't know about?
if this is real i'd be shook
I'm going to Jupiter and go strait to the red spot
Scp - 2399   He looks like Eve from WALL-E but red and damaged.
jupiter is basically like a that great great grandfather that you dont even know giving earth (that is in depth)  a very needed 900k
Scp-1861( crew of the hms wintersheimer) object class Keter  uncontained scp scp-1861 is an anomalous meteorological phenomenon characterized by rain,blood,and human cerebrospinal fluid
SCP foundation: we need to find a way to power this emp Me: am I the only one that watches kurzgesagt
What if we put cain against this thing?
To me the little things that come out of it look like the flood from halo
You know how that one video explains how bigfoot are more intelligent than us I think that's when we must return to monke
burn thr jupiter
Reverse engineer infiniTP and generate power by converting mass into energy
The scp foundation hates you by throwing “hidden” scp facts out there also they could power the nuke with a safe metallic scp
Scp the rubber 😳
The drones are called 2399-1
it is better to fight Scp 2399 to Indestructible creature
9:11 just the rubber doing the Kira Yoshikage challenge                      (btw you are my favorite youtuber)
The best SCP ever!
I feel like I'm on Jupiter
This is better than school  This was posted by the not school gang
good thing scps dont exist
4:51 ah yes          *Therubber was not the impostor*
I always wondered what if scps were real
P
SCP are cool but damn I do not see this rip off lego figure all the time
they literally have gods locked up why not just yeet them at scp 2399
Why not try and find a way to catch one of the drone or maybe try something to catch a drone and try a device that allows the drone to release a powerful virus that will turn of all the defense system of it then use operation giga
I s would be useful A.I.
Do about scp 914 pls
Thanks Jupiter :D
Is that eva-02
Aliens: lemme destroy earth rn  Jupiter: No u
Wait if you can decod the messages from its master can't you just tell it to stop and it could come in peace well actually its been to earth before when it saved us from the broken God so it most likely comes in peace
Plot twist : scp 2399 was sent to destroy all 'indestructible' scp
That's a storm idiot
Do a face reavial
I know how the foundation could get all the money for that step 1: get several life insurances for Dr. bright step 2: then kill Dr. bright step 3: get the money from the life insurance company's to sum it up: just do life insurance scams
So...they couldn't translate the newer message?
Im getting scared for bieng in 25 years
How big is SCP-2399 and it should be object class appolyon if it would end the world
When i was whatching planeta while i was in my science class i saw SCP 2399 and somethink big idk how i saw that maybe i have some weird powers to see good cuz no one else saw it  so i was whatching SCP 2399 for 2 hours and this video helps me study SCP 2399
I kinda feel like this is true but it actually isn't
This video is wrong in so many ways
bruh there's way too much crap that could destroy the planet and deus ex machina wouldn't be able to take care of in the scp universe
Wouldn’t that make 2399 Apollyon?
.
25 years i could die in 25 years YESSD
Here is an idea to possibly neutralize 2399 is to purchase or borrow caste bravo a 25 megaton nuclear bomb and lauch it close enough to 2399 to create an emp effect that could possibly make it extremely vunrable to other weaponry if it fails  purchase or comeendeer a russian 100 megaton nuclear bomb (tsar bomba) and reapeat the same process with the first nuke (castle bravo)
fuirlshygierlkdfkhjsdhksjkhhkhjhgghlghpyioyggiuliulh
hold up if it repairs itself by 0.78 percent every time it releases its drone then that mean it would get to go to earth in 128.205128205 days... oh god
I'm much worried about earth man what if he recover so fast and just end us
You are super! RUBER
Next scp 676789
Hey make a video about scp-001
But I think is not real
What is your real name And is this real???
Ye
Better than science class
Hold up jupiter is a gas planet it has no surface
Instead of electromagnetic shit, what if the SCP foundation instead tried antimatter? That would destroy the shield and the antimatter itself
*When Jupiter gets angy:*
isn't it obvious? we have plenty of time! get a dyson swarm rolling! cmon people!
Jupiter is just a real bro
Have they tried the lizard yet?
I don't think there is anything in Area 51. I think that it is empty.
If there was anything like space ships from star wars in Area 51, why doesn't the SCP Foundation use them?
Wtf, this is somehow "real"?
Plss make an animated about scarlet king and broken god
whydotheylauchitatspce
I want to see The Malfuctioning Destroyer versus weaponary put trough The Clockworks on very fine
Scp 001
They have God in there right? Just ask him.
is this all real?
You have no idea how nukes work do you SCP foundation? THEY VAPORIZE ANYTHING AND I MEAN ANYTHING IN THE FIREBALL, wait... how would you get a nuke to jupiter? Wow I guess we are kind of stuck...
Are we going to die quite use scp 096 right see
Ok now i want to be a space man
Awesome SCP
And then led to scp 001
Stop hitting that kid on the head. The addendum is scary enough.
IVE BEEN LIED TO ABOUT JUPITER
isn't this the scp that ultimately got destroyed after dr. bright threw one of Jupiter's moons (i think) at it, or am i thinking of another?
Part 2 please??
Fun fact: If there was no Jupiter, a LOT of asteroids could have hit earth  throughout it's history.
Is scp 2399 still alive?
Use something to shock its shield to malfunction like...emp missile???
Time #6:06 pause and you will see a fireball
Easter egg ) rubber got ejected
Throw the lizard at it!
POV:your watching in 2021
Aren't we supposed to be afraid of SCP
So if protocol legionnaire doesn’t complete until 2046 we will be doomed?
Science they can translate and decode... couldn't they just fake a message and tell it to self destruct??? Seems like something they could do.
Everyone, say "thanks Jupiter!"
Rubber scp 2399 was damage by scp 001 the brokend god
What if it just wanted to make peace with us and deliver resources
Send them a bunch of pictures of SCP-096. Crisis resolved.
Your a life saver jupiter! Thanks!
The asteroid belt: helo
Why don't u just ask God and have him give u some direction?
Please make SCP-2399 Addon for Minecraft
S
Or the scp foundation could just use “God” the scp
But the God SCP likes humans he can alter reality too so he could help right?
Just question the “god” scp about it, as he has omnipotence and is knowledgeable of all things
This maybe the war criminal’s species the robot that they may have made
What if 2399 was sent here in order to protect us?
Due u work at the scp plas
They suk
It’s my parents
I love you but I can’t sup
Does scp 239 have any chances to win against scp 2399?
But Jupiter is a gas planet?
to be honest if any of this was real we would've have been dead a very very long time ago
The supreme cupboard prudently grip because trowel encouragingly compare under a wiry spain. terrible, accidental ukraine
Rocky moon I O. Really?
The rubber was the impostor.
'A Malfunctioning Destroyer'  Me: Soooooooooooo Error sans?
why not instead of one massive E.M.P we just get loads of the biggest ones we have to date and fire those at 2399?
Have they tried to lunch a atomic bomb the big nuke?
Is it fake lol?
if drones come out of scp 2399 then if we plug the hole to where drones come out it will stop fixing itself right? and if i hold tooo much droesmaybe because they are full of energy they can explode maybe if not try moving it to a star because stars explode so if you use the barrier thingy when the star explode it may be destroyes scp 2399
Is that scp playin minecraft he lookin ancient debris?
use a space nuke
4:51 the rubber was not the imposter 1 imposter remains
Can it beat goku tho?
*Any SCP exists That SCP: TIC TOC, FOTHERMUCKERS
dude how they crate so many detailed scps?
Welp 5 years...
Why don't they send a scp to jupiter
What if the people who sent it there was tryna protect us
Fun fact: Dr. Bright managed to destroy 2399 by launching Io into the thing
Why don't they disguise some Nukes as a large part of debris, wait for the drones to try and repair it to the ship... *_BOOM_*
im going to make a theory right now, this is what probably was covering the earth from @TheSunDisappeared
We can target with a bomb named nuke
Or plutonium
Uranium 238
SCP-2399 : I have technology  ! Humans: We have a SCP-682 !
Do you know about " the Rubber Viet Nam "
Isn't 2399 save earth against broken god?
We sent it there too learn to help others any kind of spices so help us help u
Leave my people alone they just want to learn our sun was destroyed
Ik some stuff about o5 command come find me boys 248638559386194838582 u will know
I'm so glad SCP isn't real I don't wanna die on a doomsday
Scp 2339- *Bout to destroy Earth  The rubber: we need to stop it from possibly coming to earth, by sweeping our mines and banks and such   Oblivious people: *Buys the ps5*
I have an idea. Why don’t the SCP foundation capture some drones, attach bombs to them, and then send them back with video tape and then when the drones reach the inside of the anomaly you blow the drones up causing more damage.
It's gonna have to hurry if it wants to beat pandemics, global warming, potential asteroids and every other anomalous, godlike entity that can/will destroy the world.
I can help you in this! Form a plasma ball! It can be made by the power of plasma energy that doesn't exists on earth but it exists somewhere where there is a super electromagnetic forge and therefore a black hole if we succed then we can destroy the SCP. Plasma is also made from electricity but it's a lot so we need to find a different planet where plasma is strong enough and that planet s 2billion planets away!
Plot Twist: We Aliens come in peace and send you this to defend yourselves from oncoming threats. Our prototype got messed up in Jupiter so it didn't make it in time. We are glad you tested out yall weaponry on our prototype to see if it's up to your standards. We hope you like it. Since giving this prototype we have made 10 superior models of this unit. May peace be to all.
Why not use the reactor found in the war criminal episode if it’s powerful enough to change the walls and power life pods it may be enough to create an emo that could shake the entire universe
Bro, If this thing exsists I don't ._.
04:51 when the imposter is sus! 😳
This is my favorite scp and I was waiting for it to be remade by you
Nice
When insects become civilised
why does mr rubber sus
can they use some help from other scps like god?
So just real quick Jupiter is made completely out of gas so how can it stay on Jupiter?
2:00 *yea sure*  This does not exist.
Crash Ganymede Callisto IO into 2399
JUPITER HAS NO SURFACE...!!!!
it's like the enemy of barbatos
Everyone gangsta until scp-2399 comes to earth
thank you jupiter for saving us lol
i think i can make an anime out of this all i need is the scp god 1729 and 001 also 5000 and other things
Plot twist: 2399 is here to track down and destroy the "Broken God ".
How do you crash land on a gas giant
Go the independence route and give it a cold
Why do I feel scps are real or just amazing strange stories of weird unexplainable creatures ? Are these even real please tell me xD.
there is no hard surface in jupiter
Jupiter is fully made up of gas
Just ask SCP 1000 for help, their technology level were much more advanced, and they could use their knowledge to ward off The Destroyer.
Is he friendly tho?
2:00 Scp foundation spreading false information The rubber: Here i come
8:49-Just put a baterry at scp 914 on "very fine".
Spoiler alert:  According to SCP Illustrated,Dr. Bright neutralized the scp by throwing the satelite Io at it.
What is that music in the background?
I love these videos on scps there back story’s and and abilities they are very cool entertaining and interesting   P.S. I’m dying to see a part two of scp 4000 / taboo
why not use a goddsm nuke
Hmm look like scp is real we better watch out for them they could kill us
Imagine they just want to live in earth with humas and transform like us and we skip from lvltype civilasation 0.56% and well be at lvl 6  And our union will dominate the galaxi and finnaly kill 682 and defeat scp 001 more known as the scarlet king  So we can have a nice tast of technology                                                      Or we die and they want to be enemy and kill us all piece is never an option                                                                They better return those stolen cows
You could just use the guy who is opposite from Scp Able
question, why wouldent you try to steal its remaining scraps that are visable and keep them away?
Easy, just use scp 2501
Usinf an EMP   For me, Sounds bad..
it looks like the robots in fornite galactus event
THANK YOU JUPITER
What if NASA has a union with the scp foundation? And that's why NASA has aliens, And if in fact qm works at nasa, be scps (My theory)
What if NASA has a union with the scp foundation? And that's why NASA has aliens, And if in fact qm works at nasa, be scps (My theory)
Maybe tell scp god to help us because hes god and hes cool
I feel like they could just throw a huge meteor at it.
Anyone else think that this scp looks like spare hulk buster parts
Poggers
Why not use it to our advantage? If it has a limitless power supply, we can use it to power the weapon to destroy it.
Everytime i watch ur videos i think the monsters or beings are real
Yo any 1 else been here since 100k
do a slender vid plz
Damn, Issei Hyoudou got a strange looking transformation.
I know this is cool and all, but, people realize that Jupiter doesn’t have land.
M JUST A CHILD I'M NOT READY TO DIE😢😢😢😢😢
to defeat it you got to get rid of the shield  "you need a device to get rid of the shield"
I know its a fiction but you really cant stay on a 'gas giant'.
I just saw SCP 2521, where the entity would go and seek information about itself. What about the message that is intercepted be include the information that we know of as text and proceed with delivering it to SCP-2399. This would let us see what SCP-2521 is capable of since it can go through matter, and for it to be destroyed is unknown, but it can go through matter so it might survive the shots from SCP-2399. When 2399 receive the message about 2521 maybe 2521 would take 2399 all-together. This is just my theory but i believe it could work
wait he has scp on his jacket. theory: the rubber is a safe class scp who is given acces to files to share with people the contents of those files
They could use another scp against it
Im sorry, *WHAT*
,,Scp-2399 is capable of deflecting bullets" SCP-682: But..... That's my thing
Damn, the Rubber really added an Among Us reference
They could just use its power to destroy it
jupiter doesn't have a surface wtf
Can I just ask what the music is you use in these stories? It's cool and mysterious and i like it.
Jupiter needs a poop..?????
Is that  real red scp? I don't know? i can't tell? You don't know my favorite is robots to?
Maybe other alien scps maybe has something to do with it or has some knowledge of it like scp 163 and scp 875.  The only one that can at least cooperate with us is scp 163. And maybe scp 163 maybe has some knowledge about the barrier, seeing how its self comes with one when it landed on earth.
What about 343
Hold up hold up, does the rubber have a freakin MUSTACHE?!
Ask the butler for a weapon that could pass their force field and destroy it.
This is Jupiter we’re talking bout right? And we see parts of the thing in the planet... but like... Jupiter... is a gas planet, it’s literally not solid.... like it consists of gases
This top secret highly classified information leaked into YouTube
So, proposal time.  I notice almost all proposals on this SCP have been to destroy it by any means necessary, along with figuring out how to, but there is one thing I notice no one has really considered, and that is taking it over.  Now hear me out on this one, so far they know how to decode the incoming signals, along with blocking said signals, but, what if the foundation sent their own message, designed to be almost a exact replica of the messages being sent by whoever sent it, with orders to either self destruct, disassemble, or, and this is the best one that could be potentially done, assign allegiance with the people of earth and ignore further orders from home galaxy. This is a very low chance of success, but considering that they have not even bothered considering using other KETER class entities to combat the Destroyer, it is safe to assume that the technology is advanced to such a degree that it surpasses the near magical properties of some of the most terrifying ones out there.
4:50 When TheRubber is sus! 😳
4:51 TheRubber was not the imposter  1 imposter remains
Why not just use scp 001 "the children" on it?
Didn't doctor light already destroy this thing?
2
SCP 2399 100 SCP PE
Let scp 1000 get smart and you will have a better chance
teachers: the red spot on Jupiter is a big storm. SCP-Foundation: *I can milk you.*
What's the SCP on the right at 5:58 ?
Hi Rubber, gotta say I love your content, and it's become very enjoyable to watch. So I was thinking you could do either SCP 169 (the Leviathan) or SCP 662 (Butlers hand bell) for your next video, what do ya'll think he should do next?
This this the new season of stars wars?
2399
So many SCPs that wanna destroy humanity or planet earth itself. 😂😂😂
at least it fiction :D
Can we let IO crash on 2399 again?
Can we let it fight SCP-682?
Why we dont throw a huge rock at it? since a moon could scrape the thing
please SCP-055
Good lord that X sound effect is so distracting with how often its played
4:00  SCP-2399: Execute order 66
the rubber was impostor
why not send 682 after it?
Is it even real?
4:15  Dr. Bright: are you sure about that *_throws one fo jupiter's moons at it_* Dr. Bright: Done, now it isn't a theat anymore
3:34 A WILD DRONE APPEARED
I recommend that they just use SCP 343, he is called God after all, if he created all life doesn’t that mean he could destroy it to
Can you make a video about SCP-5000??
Yes
Send it an image of the shy guy
Decode the messages, and swap them out for a self-destruct order.
you know, i wonder what would happen if we fired HECOR at it.
the god knows what part got me
Just throw IO at it.
TheRuuer scp 001
I want tobsee the Most powerful scp
TheRuuies
What if scp 2399 was actually helping earth in its own way just threatening to us
The malfunctioning destroyer looks like something out an anime.
Why dont they just get the help of Scp-343? AKA LITERALLY GOD!!!
Regimech
Solution: Throw 682, 4715 and 96 fighting eachother on top of that thing and let it rip
And then Dr. Bright threw the moon at it
did anybody think to use said nukes to push it deeper into jupiter? being the science buff that I am Juptier isn't exactly a hospitable place.get it shoved into the great blue spot on Jupiter and you'd have it hit a big fat flux tube. If you want an EMP that would knock the daylights out of it, you could use that.
We need a way to disrupt or destroy the barriers that scp 2399 emits and then try to assemble a plan of destruction *Big brain moment completed*
What if the repair drones give off a signal unique to the drones? Could someone potentially recreate that somehow, and plant a nuclear warhead or two inside the destroyer and detonate them to at least extend the time it'll take to repair the destroyer?
Pls make a part 2 we need to kbow more
I'm getting heavy Supreme Commander vibes here...
Rubber how u are smart
It’s actually quite simple to defeat this thing...God
Make a tsar bomba bigest bomb 1m of them
blackhole maybe can destroy scp 2399
Cant you just send god to stop it?
Great video man
If worse comes to worse you can try to send humans up to Mars and start a new civilization
Do the Scarlet King please just do it if you don't do it I'm going to unsubscribe and put a thumbs down on this video
Your the best
Name: █████ ████ Rubber  Operator's Tag: Research Manager Rubber,  Personal Nickname: Dr. Rubber  Security Clearance Level: 4  Current Assignment: Department Head: Storage, management, and exporter of information  Profile: The artistic and charismatic "Dr. Rubber" is one of the most knowledgable members of the Foundation. Doctor Rubber is in charge of sharing concise information to the lower members of the foundation, and is also in charge of making introductional videos for D-class and test subjects. Mr. Rubber uses his artistic talent to make short animated videos about different SCP entities, and puts them on display for D-class to understand the SCP thoroughly. His simplification of extremely dangerous SCP's has given him some scorning from the rest of the Foundation Heads, but it has in turn gained him respect from many D-class and other members of the Foundation.
so this is appollyon class. its uncontainable
Try bring builder bear near it
Just throw 682 on it!
Make a video on scp 714
Does it have a weak spot?
RUBBER!!!!! I made a TCG card game with your character! ITS SUPER CUTE!!!!!! But I can't sell to you. I am sorry. Hope one day I can give ALL the cards to you. ( Copy's of course) Here is one of the 109 Cards  Name: BOPPY  Rarity: SUPER-RARE Type: Support Effect: Heal all your Rubbers to full health, but they lose 1 attack power.
is this for real?
Why the frick are scps all so op??
But Jupiter is made out of gas, how in da world are there ground on Jup
Pls do Scp-169
SCP 666
When he said from 1971 to 1985 the rubber flying like an among us and the sound to lol XD
[We know the truth]
Just fire the nerf gun at it lmao
If u want earth save you need talk to God
You should do creepy pastas(even though the SCP foundation is technically a creepypasta) if you don't know creepypastas are mainly serial killers with sad backstory.
There is more than 99
Scp 169 pls
The fact that they never thought about an energy absorbing shield to solve the retribution of the alien machine makes it realistic
Hey rubber can you make a aml vid
Ok but what if it was sent to help protect us or to destroy an asteroid that is going to hit us
So...IS ALIENS EXISTS!?
Scp 020 plsssss
part 2 when?
Can you do scp 4885?
The solution's simple: Check your SCP inventory and figure out how to tactically unleash a concept-bending anomaly that can destroy it.  Well ... not so simple, but there are _probably_ SCPs capable of reality-warping it to oblivion.  Haven't they used SCPs against SCPs before?  There must be _something_ controllable/compliant enough to deal with it.
Send in whatever SCP Goku is
This was more better than the online class
I know this scp it's Scp 1120 know as Smg4 he's use he's leg to fight
Pls upload this vid to the rubber in spanish ;-;
Rubber:"It is indestructible" Me:then are we keep shooting at it.
Do a video about SCP 2761
0:19 I love the little dance! It’s precious XD  Also, in hindsight, it probably would have been smarter in hindsight not to directly fire at the drone and more at the remains of the communications array. That way you’d slow it down even more or even outright cripple it’s communications array even more than it already is, rather than just damage a drone that will repair itself anyway.  Or, just hide the pieces needed to repair it. If you can just give the thing the run-around, you can slow it down that way.
The red dot is a big turnado
Evongalion 2
What if it is like that Futurama episode and it goes to a diffrant planet not earth
I thought Dr Bright sent the moon Io at 2399 and killed it.
Nice to know that there’s tons of different things out to end us all :)
Do scp-2662 it’s cthutlu a god it was around the universe until it has found earth and it went to a deep sleep
4:50 nice among us sound effect
At least we have scp-343 for help
Pls do an episode on SCP-1657.
at this point just call in 343 to destroy that thing
*Hello* *Rubber!!*  I love your videos and I might have something you'd  Potentaly be interested in.          I created an SCP and I would like to know if you'd like to make a video on it? If so, where should I post this SCP document?
Are you able to do a video on SCP-336
You should do a piece on SCP-1516. This one I find interesting because of its anomalous properties that enable it to, essentially, turn words into physical objects that the word describes. (For instance, you write the word 'chair' and SCP-1516 will proceed to, well, make a chair out of the word 'chair') I hope you find this one just as interesting as I did :-)
Is this a real scp 😳
have we tried communicating with it tho?
Rubber can u please give apollyon scps too
Hmmmmmmmmm...   Why not send it a picture of 096?
Just steal vital parts, research ways to destroy them, then send them off deep into space or the sun
So theoretically if we could generate an emp powerful enough it could temporarily stop or completely stop 2399. And if I remember correctly 2399 has an endless power supply so there is a chance that 2399 could output enough energy to power an emp but if so what would the foundation do to somehow connect 2399's power supply to the emp. But does anyone else think that this could work
Do a scp 597
2399 just giving us feedback on what we should remove us: O_O ... o...k?
VIEWER ADVICE IS DISTRICTED *That Cant stop me Because I cant read*
Imma assume everyone has heard of 001 when day breaks.  The last order given to scp 2399? "Target is out of range, proceed to planet 3, cease repairs". What if the target was never us...  It was always Sol
Why won’t they hit him form the bottom like set bombs off of him like underground and then explode the bombs while 2399 is still under ground
So is this real or fake im cunfused
At that point in time would we real need jupiter?
Instead of destroying the robots, destroy the parts.
scp-472
SCPs I'd like to hear you talk about  SCP-162 SCP-166 (although censorship is advised, you'll see why) SCP-409 SCP-911 SCP-999
Wow months later after you replied to me,  you was 26k subs now over a mil!! Congrats
Your videos are very cool but I think that you could make a very good video about “SCP-001 The truth”, because for me this is the most mysterious and cool!
Part 3 scp 093
cool scp story...just STOP spoiling us from the start!
Why can't all scp be nice and leave us alone.
I think that 2399 was sent to earth by his galaxy because they were getting anomalous reading from theyre galaxy I mean they are our “neighbors” in this universe and they’re more technologically advanced what if they are just the scp in that galaxy probably not specifically named scp but a more advanced and they’re going to earth to either destroy all of the the scps because if they found a way out to the universe it would be doomsday for all not just earth
I think SCP-3449 would be a good one to do next. Also known as ‘The Things Left Unsaid’, its a cognitohazard that renders any and all form of communication by humans impossible. Any attempts to speak, write, etc are rendered irrelevant by 3449.
Do the gate keeper
Make a video about SCP-999
Where is bright when we need him to use one of Jupiter moons to take care of this scp
What if we just nuke it
Good thing the SCP-Earth will only be destroyed and not ours.
This is my most favorite SCP ever
I’m mad at myself I forgot the check this week for the rubbers video
Can you please react to superstitious foundation by cg5
Our own government has difficulty okaying a stimulus plan to help those affected by the Covid pandemic. Many of which don’t even trust that government, but there’s a fictional organization that is like the BPRD from Hellboy mixed with the Men in Black and the Ministry of Magic that we put a lot more stock and faith in to protect us from what we don’t know about.
Can you do scp 860-2 please?
4:51 to 4:53 among us moments
I want to see the Pan Dimensional Vending Machine
Wait isn't the planet Jupiter composed only of gas consisting of helium and Hydrogen and how can this 2399 scp land?
To all roblox youtubers and evry other fandom:in February 12 WE WILL STOP THE VEGAN TEACHER
Quick question in Among Us the Impostor Aka more like a alien is the imposter more like a SCP or a Alien?
I suggest if you could make a video from SCP 087, just let me know if you like the idea
Love it
Do scp 999
Hold on Wait just wait so first of all you’re saying that when This robot finishes completion of fixing itself and to come here and destroy us all, If that so you made a video about saying that the SCP foundation contain God so why don’t they just asked him to destroy it before it gets here it’s just simple.
Can you make a video SCP 457
The astroid: I’m coming to get you boy  The destroyer: Back the Frick off my boy
Don’t worry I think it will take too long, enough for Jesus will save us.
Wait how was SCP-2399 able to crash into a gas giant?! I mean i would understand if it crahsed into europa or io but JUPITER?! ITS LITERALLY A GAS GIANT!
If they can translate the message can't they send one to 2399 as well? Most likely something among the lines of ''when you are at 100% go 10 light years away and blow yourself up''
Suggestion scp- 594 or scp 5000
why cant they just take the parts away?
The rubber i need to contact you concerning SCP-001 please respond ASAP
I subbed to the rubber when had 100000 and like 2 seconds later he has like almost 2 mil.
Play scp secret lab
i got an ad for scp books on this video
What music do you use?
Hay you can make SCP-3700  the tides of war
I hate online school the only good thing about it is that you get out of school at 12
Rubber can you talk about scp ○○|○○○○○|○○|○ normally is called scp 2521- wait someone is knocking at my door just wait for a minute
Wait wasn’t it that giant worm thing that made the red spot according to scp? The one that could end the world you know the one
A black hole can destroy anything, even scp 2399.
Jupiter protected the earth from asteroids by using it gravitational pull and now it is protecting us from a doomsday event 😳
Please do SCP - 001 The Broken God
Why not use a dyson sphere
What if this SCP is good and its here to give us resources we dont have and neutralise some scps
Make video about SCP 026
I WANT SCP 111!!!!!!
Review scp 650 the black mannequin
Aaaaaaaa jupiter is a gas giant soooo it does not have a solid surfece and strong cravity and he will fall on and on and on and on  Tip.you say like you mest this Word up ye but i am not inglesh   Ye i am... Estonian🇪🇪🇪🇪🇪🇪🇪🇪🇪🇪  Thanks for reading♥️
good thing bright already smashed that thing by somehow yeeting Ioh towards it
Can you do a scp 1499 please
Have the scp foundation tried to destroy the scp from the inside?????
Who would win A unkillabe robot  That can destroy the human life and earth  that Can send messages to the triangle galaxy  Or              A  F**KING  LIZARD
İsnt this maksur class
TBH not everything you learn in school will be useful in the outside world
Scp 4975
And scp 4217 showed scp 2399 in its video feed before sinking SCPS nemed and killing captain wegner,in my theory,the unknown scp 4217 must be an alien detached and fell to earth and attached to bismarck because of scp 2399 being grabbed by the Jupiter's gravity.
Jupiter went through hell for millions of years and now this happens
This is ky method at destroying scp 2399,here how it is: first build a identical robot that repairs scp 2399,then the identical spy repair robot will go inside and destroy the force field device so it wont work so nukes and lasers can destroy it,and this is my reckless second method:have someone drive a ship that will drive scp 2399 from the traget(earth)and distract and lead it to the sun until its destroyed.and my last third method:have all safe,euclid and keter scps destroy it as possible as our last hope of humanity if my first or second method will not work.
I know the secrets of the Great Red Spot now  I am too powerful
How bout throwing the lizard at it tho
The machine gangsta until doctor bright decides to throw a fucking moon at it
TUA GAVE ME TRAMA
isnt Jupiter a gas planet?
Hey Rubber i want to make a video about "Long Horse"            Like this comment if you want to see a video about "Long Horse"
Signal some high class memes on it soo it will be too busy looking at and never get anything done such as repairing itself
Thanks jupiter!
Wait why not just use god to delete it?
👉🤔👈
Why don't they send it a faked signal that orders it to stop repairing itself
cant you just use scp 914 and upgrade a airplane to drive these nukes there?
You shouldnt have told the russians about this... Theory:Russians would go to space and i mean nuke the spot over and over if the nukes could make it to jupiter tho
if Jupiter's moon IO damaged it. it can certainly destroy it. all they have to do is send the planet hurtling towards SCP 2399 and wipe it out.
bruh if it chilling dont hurt it or attack it
Lol the armour in the thumbnail looks like the red dragon armour in highschool dxd
Hey, rubber, could you talk about the red pool
Rubber I have been your biggest fan because I have watched all your videos  in I love it 🤩🤩🤩
Hi rubber
Idk why he has a channel of espanyol
Me: -Searched- "Does jupiter has land?" Google: "It does not has land idiot" Me: THEN WHY DOES IT HAS LAND AT THAT?! Me: Very fake but cool hit the like button on therubber plz B))
is SCP foundation real? Please reply.
Next up should be SCP-1762 and SCP-1762-BOL-1.
Hey mr rubber can you make the scp 122 object class keter pleas
Bruh they could just turn the think into a power source if u think about it that weapon on jupiter could just be used as a power source. With the technology of the foundation that could just happen. What about the force field u ask well that is the socket we could just drain the energy from the shields itself. We could just turn it's greatest defense into a reliable energy source. What about the drones you ask well it's easy. use the same electro magnetic pulse like the one that the satellites produce. What about it's weaponry  Use the power from the shields to make a some kind of net that is not made of wire no no no energy that is my theory as stupid it might sound it's just a theory.
why not just throw a moon at it didnt u say it got damaged since it got hit by one then why not throw a barrage of moons
they should also be looking for other planets or ways to terra form them so humanity could live on on differnt planets
What of they make a replica drone with a warhead inside and just hitman disguise their way inside the shield and just detonate from inside
Is this real?
Scp-2399 when it got hit by nuke:tis but a scratch
This real?
I wish there is an Scp that can make your consciousness turn into a stand,
Is this fake or real it scars me a Little
Everybody be gangster until it repairs.
SCP-2399 = kerbal space program easter egg
SCP 001, please
Can i ask what will happend if scp-096 vs scp-2399?
Is this real is the world ganna BOOM!!
scp 026 pls in next vedio pls
I love that you put in an Among us meme on one of my favorite SCP's Bro.
So many keter class scps, so many innocent lives killed
the year sound is like the among us game that been voted out
SCP-354 The Red Pool. I think you should do this because there is so much to it. Its very amazing about what happens in it and their is so many stories and background to it.
Well that's dumb, why don't they just get off the planet? They already have the technology to disrupt that SCP's ability to communicate, and is currently orbiting Jupiter, mind you.
Instead of destroying how about something that deactivates it
And can't you part 2 pls I want to see it if destroy
Sooo where go on country I hope we did it to destroy
Did pangloss have something to do with io hitting scp 2399
4:22 The Rubber: 2399 is currently indestructible   Anime: ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT????
Keter class objects:  exists TheRubber: ł₮'₴ ₣ⱤɆɆ ⱤɆ₳Ⱡ Ɇ₴₮₳₮Ɇ
Can you do SCP 966 next?
Have it end up fixing itself n coming to earth and before it destroys us...it tells us it was comming to take all the dangerous scps to a inescapable containment area or something to save us, but cause we shot at it, it decides to eliminate us.
ok sooo my thing is why not use THE TABLET to reset the universe again?
They have to use 100M damage to order destroy is shield
fortnight destroyer looks the same maybe it came from a fortnight universe
I thought Jupiter was a gas planet.. NOT A SOLID PLANET!
therubber can you talk about SCP-169 The Leviathan
If the MTF or NTF just go in side in SCP-2399 and blow up the core of SCP-2399.
Imagine he got out and going to earth and hit moon and falling to water
Oh for god's sake, just throw the lizard at it. We obviously know who's gonna come out on top. And just in case we're wrong, then atl least we got rid of the lizard, so win-win!
"You must construct additional pylons"
how the did the destroyer get damaged by a moon io but our missiles cant even damage the destroyer i think the solution is not to nuke the destroyer but kill it by using mellele attacks because its sheald is i think only for the incoming projectiles but mellele i think its like only option right now its like a vest meant
Can you do scp999
I hope scp's dont exist
1:59 so our teacher LIED
"Due to its location, containment is impossible"  Me : "Dood that's some alien shit space ship,what the hell is wrong with government organization and their 'containment' shinanigans,let the ship alone will ya?"
Is this even real
SCP-001 VS SCP-2399  EPIC BATTLE
4:51 Among us reference. I was listening to the story while playing a game and had to pause the game to look back at the screen. That sound is ingrained in my brain.
Just try and hurl a nuke or an antimatter bomb at it. (Edit) ok NVM about nukes but maybe antimatter bombs.
SCP-1730 What Happened to Site-13? Interesting story unraveling in it.
Are you part of the 05 council
Get it to fight 106 or teleport it to a different dimension
You need to get a Mac cannon or the covenants glassing cannon for that thing
Wait when is part 3 of the Red Sea creature scp?
Just send a moon at it, thats what hurt it in the first place
Scp 2399 form chapter 2 season 4 form fortnite
I bet to my friend on my only 650 HRK (witch is close to 100 USD) that you will make SCP-2020 (who ever that is) pls do so i win 650 HRK not lose em
Everyone gunna ignore the among us reference?
And i have only 25 year left of my Life
I got an scp ad before this played.
Can you do scp 5000
Is all of the SCP real bc I’m a kid
I liked subbed and turned on notifications
SCP-2399: "Exists" Dr. Bright: Not for long.
The irritating coil lovely walk because pipe remarkably shave per a tough taxicab. diligent, unused instruction
New scp: *exists* scp foundation: shoot the fucking lizard at it
Is anything like a alien from Mars an scp
And it has an electro magnetic shield so it won’t be crushed
Wouldn’t Jupiter’s atmosphere crush the robot that are checking 2399 out
Does anyone know what software The rubber uses???
Jupiter's moon Io is pronounced "aiyo," so you know, not "IO."
Could some please link me to the ominous background music please
why dont u destroy some parts
This is porygon Z change my mind
Ummm maybe i Will go to space won day its going to take a long day
*And scp-999?*
Weight is 2399 friendly
What's so scary and fascinating is this might be real in another way, and we would never know..
SCP-2399: We are fu*ked
what are the lasers fron 2399 made out of tho? evry contry trying to destroy scp 2399 that one guy build railgun the shoot thean big boom
Hey don’t worry he just be campin k
Just fucking nuke Jupiter
It seems more like a gorger from marvel
Can you do SCP-999 please
4:51 *TheRubber was not the imposter*
Please make scp 040
Can u do scp 026
This is one of my favorite scps.
Do you think they could use the scp 001 perposal "the 9 children" to destroy this base? Dont they have unlimited range and do you think their immense power would be enough to destroy the base?
We can also take the help of SCP-343
IS THIS REAL!?
I love how u talk about lesser known scps
Do scp 017 please
Hold on, you're telling me that humans captured and decoded messages from another galaxy meant for that thing? Then why aren't we encode messages and send it to the thing? We can simply tell it to selfdestruct or to deactivate all functions until further notice. It would require far less effort than to fucking nuke it
This kind of brings me pain to look at do to Jupiter has no ground it’s entirely made of gas except for his core
I theorized change it to class thaumiel we need a scp powerful enough to eradicate or find the missing part of the scp and hide it here so the drones will fail at repair and be complete0
Lol why I am into this scp thing
Scp6789
What if the foundation destroy the drones that do the repair?
CIWS?
You can explain 3456?
The scp foundation is a fictional site and the scps are all fake!!!
Is Freddy from FNAF a SCP? Because he was killed by a purple man and got transferred in a soul to a animatronic named Freddy same goes for Bonnie Chica Foxy so they also malfunction at night and kill nightguards and atuff them into suits also the killer shove himself to a springtrap skin and died in it and malfunctioned and became evil after that there were toy version ghosts versions also known as phantoms and there are nightmare version also Fredbear and Springbonnie has also a story Fredbear ate a child accidently by the brother of the child who got eaten the guy also got bullied in the pizzaria so is Freddy a Killer Animatronic Child Malfunctioned Soul a SCP??
the rubber...that was you big name idea
Bro thats not what SCP-2399 actually looks like-
Didn't you have like 50k subs like a year ago?
so we have managed to catch and decrypt the messaged from the creator and we know that scp-2399 is following these messages as orders.  since we know the how to decrypt the messages , i wonder if we could encrypt a message. give it an order to destroy itself and then sit back and watch the fun begin.
Also me be like.  Build a guant star ship. On 25 years.  And fler in to space.  1 year in space. Target detected.  Target destroyed  Wait hummans still exist because they used our technology.
Me be like.  Place a bomb inside it after turns of its shield to be sure it ill work  Boom  Target still exists😱😱lol
me 24 years and 9 months later  *may i have a makarov?*
10 vids in, and the mispronunciations are starting to grind a bit.
They said it needs pulsar technology which is possible if a magnetic nuetron star shot at jupiter
SCP-2399 is indestructible  SCP-343 and SCP-001: allow us to introduce ourselves
i have  a way to slow it down... *staring at the moon*
Soooo did it work
Use mobile task force Tau - 5 and research more technology and more weapon technology and use a the upgrading scp machine to upgrade the nuke
Well this is fake but nice video
BREAKING NEWS: SCP Foundation Resarcher Dr.Bright has destroyed the construct known as SCP-2399 by somehow yeeting ANOTHER moon of Jupiter called Europa towards SCP-2399.   (Yes this canonically happened)
Someone copy yr content dude
Week 2 of asking for q and a
You know what to do. Send The Lizzard!!!!
Why don't scp 001 just destroy it

....................
World Engine from Man of Steel

2389 vs saitama 🤣👌
"it has an unlimited power supply" EMP pulse satelites: Allow me to introduce myself
scp-2399 looks like that one ultraman tiga kaiju from that one episode
what if they use a nuke since it can get through almost anything
The rubber Indonesia 🙏🙏🙏🙏
hire the chinese to eat it
Next scp 093 final part please
I like the idea of 2933 but how it ended up in jupiter is just bull. Srsly, i highly advanced intergalactic ship/planet buster collides with a moon and then get sucked by the gravity of puny jupiter? Someone or something stepped in and made it hit that moon.
I think thanos might hire this guy
I will wait 25 fucking years and if I dont see a fucking apocalypse when im 45 I will fucking kill myself
Doesn't the clockwork turn weapons to dark matter weapons ok well you can eliminate it now
Just use laser
It hit IO? The traveller?
It was damaged by hitting a planet, throw another planet at it, see if that works 😂
my brain says "is this secret?"   what if unknown 300,000,000 light years away "is"  ...  "matter"?  justsayn
and i wanna see "Scp-001" as the next vid
i get squirrely
if You Can't Destroy It With EMP Why won't you use A _NUKE_
This is.. far worse than I was expecting
Are all these SCP Foundations and these THINGS really true or are they just fiction based ??? I've been watching your Videos for about a year and a half and this question always bothers me a lot.... Please answer me... It will be a great help.
plot twist This is just a recon drone, and the actual war ships are locked in inter-galactic war with lovecraftian horrors.
who else wants part 2?
Holy shit, I searched "rubber chicken" and founded this
Is this real?
For some reason I both hate and like this video.   You earned a sub mate good job :)
the rubber should do scp 023
try to use the sun
Is that a mustache or are you just constantly doing an uwu
They must put a nuke there
Please next video is what really happened to site 13
Why not use another scp
Why can we not use God I mean literally go up a couple episodes in you're literally see God
From 1971 to 1985 we shall have among us sounds
a kid scp
i think I'm a scp
Too many ads , I'm going to watch this on NEW PIPE
C'mon bois we gonna discover this scp in Jupiter XD
Bold of you to assume Jupiter has a solid enough surface to be distinct from its sky.
chainsaws
You just referenced the "among us was not the imposter " line
And we all know how project legionnaire went
Dosent the scp foundation have a litteral god?
I saw that among us reference
SCP-2399: You cant defeat me. Dr. bright: I know, but he can *Io crashes*
Dang Jupiter is good to us, not only does it occasionally redirect asteroids away from us, but it also traps high-tech robotic destroyers :D
Subtle among us referance
Me at 8:07 use nuclear weapons
Wait so how big is this dude?
god is going to deffends pray
I'm just over here thinking, just send cthullu to attack it, bam
what if it just shoots a beam at us, but instead of obliterating us it just erases global warming and flys off
I am an indestructible reptile so SCP  2399 cannot destroy me
Why not just get scp-682 onto a rocket and launch it at cap 2399 you could kill two birds with one stone at the very least scp-682 would then be Jupiter's problem.
Didn’t doctor bright somehow destroy it?
283
What if Orcane from rivals of aether was an SCP? Will you make a video about it?
Me watch Scp My friend be like     Dude scp it's hoax Me: >:|
Uhhh why not try to overpowering it like create a device that will overload the scp to blow up
4317: red spot 2399: I made it Lizard in scp: be quiet my adopted girl is my life Abby: go go God: i made you Scp foundation and the rubber: shut up where investigating an ikea and coffee so quiet. All scp: ha ha ha ha Monarch: we have deadly dinos and apes!!!!! Us: stop bricking the 4th wall
4:50 *The rubber was not an impostor*
can you do scp 783
Transmit a digital picture of SCP-096 to it.
"2399 has been reclassified to neutral due to Dr Bright launching one of jupiters moon at 2399"
Isn't Jupiter a gas giant?
Why not just encrypt a message for it to destroy itself
So How Long Do We Have
If only they could get one of the reality bending SCPs to destroy 2399...
Do a video talking about the relation between scp 2399 and scp 4217
Do SCP-026 “Afterschool Re *something* “
Among SCP
thank god its not real right ? RIGHT?
Why didn’t you read out the new transmission “Stop repair. Go to third planet” or that it was first observed by Galileo.
There is 1 scp thats good its a tree im Not kiding
Yeah Dr Bright destroy that scp with one of jupiter moon
So once I heard a weird sound coming from my attic, it sounded like footsteps. Then I saw something peek trough my doorway with a big smile and a long neck, but I only saw it for a split second so I can’t be so sure that I saw it. But after a few minutes I heard a door open and then someone or something was humming and it sounded like it was saying *eeeeeeeeeee* and then it thankfully stoped after a few minutes. And after that experience, I never heard or saw that thing ever again. Also I call the creature “EEE” if you wanna know.
EPIC....
push it into the sun... somehow
You think 343 or the gate guardian would help us out?
I like the fact he says information of this should not be public as he posts a lot of information of it on a public site.
is SCP real? ithink no :P but i liked ur vid :D
Scp 343 can see the future or stuff like that right? (The scp god) he can help us against this scp , Or it might be him who made it
I searched pretty far down in the comments, searching for ANYONE who also picked up on the "Among Us" reference!? The scp videos are getting so much better with subtle references and better writing! Well done, Rubber!
Please check out scp 3213, it may be the funniest scp i’ve ever read
блять, где русский перевод\
Soon Jupiter will be destroyed
yo just do what bright did throw a moon at it
What if it just wanta samples from earth?
can u make a video on scp 000 or 001?
4:51        *THE RUBBER was an Impostor*
Who really think its real?
Imagine is 2399 were to arrive at the exact spot  where scp 001 is located
scp 3700-1 and scp 3700-2   please
You'd enjoy SCP-4242 ("Foundations"). It's a basement in a church that leads to churches, temples, and shrines of other places around the world in the past, all charged with protecting humanity and the world from anomalies. Some of the people from these historic times were brought into the present day to help with containment or to become agents today. For one such story, check out SCP-4750 ("The Little Tailor of Zanzibar") for a Viking that became a modern-day agent for the SCP Foundation.
What's the SCP in the middle at 5:55?
What about scp 250 the allosaurus
volly of nukes
Just take the pieces of the wreckage and study it back on earth it can’t be re-paired if it’s parts are gone
Imma firin mah lazah
Pls do SCP 999
It would be cool if you did SCP 001
Does this scp really exist?
Aliens: so we gonna kil you earthlings Jupiter: no i don't think you will
Mr rubble sir please please explain about scp-001:when day breaks please  🙏 thank you  Ps: Sorry if my English is bad sir
Ez put a nuke into clockwork machine set to very fine toss it into the red spot.
@#TheRubber can you add the connection with SCP001 Doctor Gear proposal , there is another theory on what it is. Can you see SCP 001 doctor gear proposal. there is part of about weapons that destroy (dismantle) the SCP.
if SCP 2399 ever starts to come to earth try to use the damping ship to ram into SCP 2399
What about scp 001
I’m still waiting for someone to do an animated video on SCP-2786. So far The Volgun has been the only YouTube channel to cover it. It would be cool to actually see The Rubber’s take of SCP-2786’s “hero complex” in action as it circumvents the plots of “The Shining” and other popular movies.
3:52 Damn I thought my screen cracked
If he could make a video of scp-001 (the gate guardian) I like scp-001.
Why did you depicted jupiter whit land when is a gasseous planet? That's just stupid
*of
make a video if SCP-002 The "living" room
FACT TIME : JUPITER DONT HAVE LAND!!!!!!
Would be interesting if 2399 was a Good SCP
783 there was A Crooked Man   pls this scp
SCP-2399 is a REAPER (mass effect series)
Pls make scp 079 in next video
Is this real
maybe it's coming to destroy 3805 before it destroys the universe
Oh no, Rias senpai! Your husband's acting up again!
Hmm 1 milion views in 2 days  I think your new record Rubber
This is what happens when you put everything in weapons and defenses, but cheapen out on navigation.
Kim jong un be like “we need a bunch of nuclear bombs to destroy civilization 1000 times over
Looks like a legendary pokemon
Eco 2761
Why dont the scp foundation use scp 343 to destroy it?
Eso es Xerath de League of Legends
The fact that a si-fi work can be actually real and protected by the thought that It's just a work of fictions makes things even scarryer tbh
if Kaboom does not work use Squish ... it's the "Keep It Simple, Stupid" method or KISS for short
Soon the end coming
hey TheRubber can you do an video about scp-000? when i search it i cant found what i wanted
Why don't you all destroy some of the missing parts of the malfunctioning robot before he could repair itself?;-;
To defeat that scp you need to crawl asshole and nuke it
Well its not secret anymore
What is mean of scp
I would love to see that thing
Hey rubber are u an scp cuze seem immortal and been in other timeline

One of One of my favourite SCP’s, glad you’ve covered it :)
Nah fam it's just a best boi
Imagine 25 years later nothing happens xd
Rubber is sus
Euclid
You said that they threw bombs at it. So where would the radiation be? It won't go away because there is no air
NUKKKEESSS
Why are these videos always not finished , i need more 😅
Why not pull a Thanos and throw a moon at it? Jupiter has plenty to spare.
Why scp foundation don't use the very powerful nuck  wepone?
Im quite hyped for scp-1875
is it Scp foundation real or fake
Don't worry everyone this is just story ok not real just asking you ok
Even this is fake but it's steel fun and cool
Everyone: Dr. Vright dropped a moon on this thing! Me: Have you proof of this claim? Everyone: No comment.
The fact that a scp can destroy a fucking world but can't even destroy a single jail
Why dont just they use scp 914
Use a massive laser powered by a DMR (Dark matter reactor) that would work
Is this fake because Jupiter is a gas giant
Make Video About SCP 001 When Day Breaks please
Thank god this isnt real
"Uranus has Awakened" "Keep out intruders!"
this makes me wonder why they don't just chuck certain SCPs onto other planets for containment lmao
Oooo I wanna see a video on scp 177 the chessboard
✝️ God loves you so much, Jesus is king!✝️
Just pull an independent day and upload a super virus
Yes I also wanted this
I'm pretty sure it's not magic proof
I'm currently wondering how many people actually believe this stuff
Here are the steps to get rid of it    Step 1: Get a master ball   Step 2: throw it at the thing   Step 3: *what do you mean its not a pokemon?*
Why they don't recover the SCP parts and hide them or destroy them?
Rubber can you animate about SCP -002
can we have a vid of scp-169? thast is one of my favorite scp's
Just get the gate guardian to reduce this thing to atoms.
Just find and take one of the peices
Can you talk about scp 2295 next plz
SCP_1875
im watching this vid while listening to a killer clown prank file
SCP-2399: These humans just wont stop attacking me, when I finally repair myself there gonna regret it!
Hey! Why not look for the parts and destroy it?
imagine you launch a nuke and 2399 is like "yooo, more repair material!"
Imagine the machine eventually repairs its self fully, fly to earth then unload a giant TV like structure and rick roll us  Scientists and scp foundation be like: 😀🔪
DO A LAST ONE OF 092 PLEASE
They could just ask the SCP known as God power the machine.
Upload next scp-001
?
How do you know this
I have a Theory.... The Rubber himself, is an SCP entity
IO and Europa? maybe the darkness aint bad after all
Scp 3299 vs 682,
yo this new halo graphics is so sick where can I buy this?
Relax its just here to murder The Broken God
Jupiter: I save Earth from doomsday  Earth: ok, we’re gonna launch a ton of nukes, and a powerful orb to you. *Breaking news: Jupiter is colliding with Earth*
if its actively searching for the parts it needs to repair and not creating them then, why not use the barrier units to steal the parts before it can get to them and hurl them into the sun.. if it cant repair it might just fuck off.
Ez just throw halo covenant at it it will be destroyed
I've been waiting for this
they never figure out i'm a scp
They should really add a TheRubber Skin in among us
Are scp real
Everybody:talk about dr.bright Me:Wait... Jupiter is a gas giants.
do video of dr jack brigth
Can you do SCP-3700
Imagine if they destroyed that thing and said *that was only a test run*     Edit: what if we send in a few SCP's that are strong? (But they might not understand and just kill us so :^)
💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💲💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Do scp 3999
Is this true?
I swear Jupiter is the most underrated thing in the universe... it saved our asses from comets, asteroids, and literally every dangerous thing you can think of in the universe, Jupiter has saved us from it...
Doubt it will destroy earth when fixed the other SPC there will care of it.
Why u dont tell other SCP name : Mr moon
only defeat can the md .the sun or ten blackhloe generator
Why among us
Chsree pealse
Do scp 001 the gate guardian!!!!
It'll be fine a certain protocol was activated twice already it won't be the first time the world ended. Not to mention this isn't the only dimension the SCP universe is in.
Bro Jupiter it’s a gas planet how is there solid
well why wouldnt they just hurl a moon at it seemed to work the first time
I got a SCP Artbooks ad at the start of this video, that is talking about a SCP, lol
What will happen if it is now completely repaired it self it will protect humanity or it will wipe out humanity from existence we don't no what will happen
Can you do SCP-3008?? It’s the unescapable
What if this SCP wants to give the human race a cure for cancer and the SCP foundation is stoping them
Aliens: I'm gonna destroy humanity lmao  Scp Foundation: looks like someone wants the lizard
Can you do scp 133
Please do a video on SCP-3998 also known as the wicker witch lives
Are scp’s real?
I don't now why this not man kind
Plot twist: *jupiter has been just clapping some alien cheeks*
Wait a minute deja vu
Just contain the scp in there
I still know that Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is not caused by a SCP but instead because of the belts in Jupiter’s atmosphere going in opposite directions and causing the clouds to spin which creates the Great Red Spot.
I made up my own character named Dr.Dalbert and he is a Scientist at an SCP foundation facility and he knows how to deal with any and all anonymous effects. He has once planned for a SCP foundation in Jupiter’s atmosphere. A station where 4 triple propeller’s and one giant underside propeller kept the station up and it would run on nuclear fusion so it can stay up and it would be used to study SCP-2399.
i have a plan 1st catch a drone out of site from the scp 2nd  program  it to drop a bomb in scp  2399 and leave. also with the program make it so i would come back to earth so we could resupply a bomb and send it back
And planet destroyer
Just build a ray of doom destroyer
Yo, this SCP is just a Halo Guardian. We're gonna need Master Chief to save our asses this time
IS,, ISS THAT AN AMOONGUS REFERENCE...
I'm confused... SCPs exist?
the rubber: "at present, false information  has thus far been able to completely suppress any knowlege pertaining to scp 2399"  ...  the people watching the video: *lafs in knolage*
It looks cool tho
"TheRubber was not the imposter" 4:50
i dont know but someone might
rubber might be apart of the scp foundation
This is cap 🧢
4:51 when the rubber is sus 😂🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😅😂😂🤣🤭🤭🤭😥🤭🤣🤣😂🤣🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
...the end is here
I watch all video of therubber
6666 comment
hmm I know how to make this successful to defeat this monster...  invent a powerful sniper that is unstoppable to get doge it by a really strong shield or use that worlds strongest railgun or invent a laser like a railgun  but i wonder what will happen if y'all clone the scp 🤔
The rubber: 2399 is invincible but the only thing it might consider dangerous is a high electric discharge me: isn’t the HID turret capable
I forgot the name but a company made their artifishal sun that is pretty small but over 500 times hotter thanks the suns core we might be able to somehow transport that into it and it will maybe burn it.
Cool. Planet Jupiter would say “Wow, I have my own SCP, well I have life now so get used to it but for now ... ... Polish Sausage”.
Wait this SCP can destroy earth?!?
Likely targeting a unknown or known SCP on Earth that would be a severe threat to it's point of origin as their tech may have found a unknown or known SCP that is far more dangerous then containment can assure prevention :3
It’ll be done in about 53 years
Can you do scp 513
Jupiter da mvp
2021 better not get any idea’s of this...
First Jupiter stopped a comet, a meteorite and now a destroyer. DANG BOI JUPITER THICC
Advanced, self-repairing, indestructible alien technology that can communicate between galaxies.   Crashes into moon immediately on arrival.   Pretty sure the 'outside help' humans get in not being constantly annihilated by SCPs is enormous plot holes.
Wow.Among Us logic right here 4:52
0:49 Hol up, I remember seeing a on a space information website a few years ago that Jupiter's great red spot was actually starting to calm down and dissolve, and that in about a few centuries, Jupiter might not have a Great Red Spot anymore.  Hurry!
Funny,They never specify WHAT ramifications Rubber What is the foundation hiding
A question that has wondered my mind if any scp is to kept hidden from the public so that no one knows how is the rubber getting this information and proceeding to tell us about it?
This can be easily solved just put the best emp you got that will fit the clock work mechanic or 914
Can you do a scp 008 video
..... I never realized how many times he says "video" towards the end but wow, I can't stop noticing it now as I go through the series = no more autoplay for me D:   GREAT *VIDEO* THOUGH!
Why does it look like one of the ARK towers in ARK: survival evolved
The old Hut is SCP 666 It is a super Powerful demon it is above keter class and it's sometimes lies and sometimes tell the truth And this hot is from when squanta was alive
Stupid Question: Could the children from the Oroboros cycle be used to power project Legionnaire, or maybe destroy the 'Destroyer'?
lunch all scps at wonce at it itl do the job
4:51 therubber was not the impostor
*HIVE, BRING A SWORD*
Thank God dr. Bright threw a moon at it
The scp is real
What's the name of the background music???
Know what I suggest? Just hurl the god danm Death Star onto it
Wait hear me out what if this is all real and the rubber works for them but they don't know he is doing this because they stay off the internet that we use to stay undiscovered
Maybe SCP-457 next time?
*bismark intensifys*
hi can you do scp 3998
Here's an unlikely solution for O5- let's show SCP-2399 the face of SCP-096
The Jupiter lol
I love when you added like um the little among us space thing it sounded just like the among us thing was  Funny
VERY creative ship design~. I like it.
how did humanity survive before the scp foundation was established?
,SCP-50000
Jupiter is the cause for a lot of SCPs, like the Bismarck.
what if its just an alien civilization that is just like "the fuck are these primitive things doing in orbit. lemme get my text messages"
why don't they look for it's pieces too so it can't rebuild itself
Still waiting for scp-999
I’d no one gonna talk about that amount us reference? 4:54
So scp 2399 is in jupiter!?
Why did you use the among us when you throw someone out?
Can you talk about SCP 748?
Do scp 1861
Glad that none of these SCP's are real....right?
"SCP-2399 can destory us." Eh just use SCP- 420 Superman, we'll be fine.
is this the fact aliens are real?
what if you were to ask scp-343 on how to destroy scp-2399
we want scp-999 pkease please explan about the cute orange slime
weeeeeeeeeeeee wantttttt scp-999
Why not ask SCP-343 about it or ask him to destroy it
NOOBS YOU CANT FREAKING CATH ME HECK YEA
maybe it want to destroy earth cause it has so many anomalies, and like the GOC, they want to terminate anomamlies
This scp kind of looks like a villain from voltron
Scp 1879 plssssssss plssss, the rubber pls
2:57 wait, the rubber survived after being targeted ??!!  *_always has been_*
Easter egg 4:51
The spot is disappearing......the destroyer is dying
Now I know why there was this strange feeling I got everytime I read or heard about the red spot I knew they were lying to us I knew it like in the books it was like it happened 'cause of a strong wind I never fell for that lie except when I felt like there was no other explanation I just went along with everything until I would find an explanation And... I guess I did but I prefer believing in the other one somehow
I've been waiting for this my whole life
Cant they send a portal or something to send it in another dimension? Or the toilet paper that can wipe out the civilisation.
Apparently the Foundation doesn't know how to use the sun to do things, but I can.
Where is the final part of scp 093 ?
So in theory, this scp is more destructive than the scarlet king. At least scarlet king can be contained, this one is impossible as the earth's technology isn't that far advance
Easy to kill it just need a rocket launcher that can shoot death hurricane bombs that thing will be destroyed and jupiter- possibly us too and the whole galaxy
If the great red spot is 2399's area and we have been lied to, wtf are you telling us this now.
You should do a video about SCP-2602 the one that used to be a library.
where do you get all this information from and how do we know that all of this is real?
Why not ask the Global Co Olitiin? (I probably said that wrong so I'm sorry)
How to beat 2399 get all the scps and yeet em on the planet to destroy the thing or a possible scp masacare
Can you talk about scp-4975
Suppose it was just attempting a slingshot maneuver around Jupiter, and, a glitch in its programming caused it to crash into Io, and, then, Jupiter!?  What if it was in it's way to Earth to protect us, and, our efforts to hinder it's self-repair, is giving time for SOMETHING truly hostile, like an Alien invasion, bent on wiping out Earth's human population, and, replacing it with theirs, to get here, first!  If there is, another intelligent species out in deep space, and, if it needs the same things Humans do, and, it's had a million years if technological advancements, but, still, for whatever reasons, has to leave it's planet, WHY wouldn't it take a nice planet like Earth!?   Who's to say they wouldn't be ruthless in It's bid for long-term survival?!  It might think, "It's inhabitants don't seem to care that MUCH about it, OR, each other!" They'd come in, forcibly evict/destroy us all, then, clean it up, and, live in their mammoth spaceships, as cities, recycling any waste products as building materials, and, ONLY coming out to enjoy/explore their new home planet for the billions of years Earth's sun has left to exist!  Who knows, an Alien species might think that painlessly, and, quickly, taking us out, might be doing us a favor in the long run?!
Well there is the hero scp that could destroy anything by shooting its opposite from a portal
0:36 but how
Damn im 11 years old and i watch this this is entertaining cause i watch monster stuff and stuff
Why don't you use other scps to counter this like the coapritve god one i bet he can do something about it
Destiny players know it’s IO not I.O.
Luckily these are fiction
You never said what class it was?
4:51 “TheRubber was not the imposter.”
Why don't they use the world's greatest toothbrush
Wait so lemme get this, in some of your videos you said that SCP-073 (Cain) is indestractuble by relfecting damage at its attack, so if you kindly please Cain as bait for SCP-2399, and he shoots him with missle barrage, he would eventually kill itself... Right? Big brain >:3
Why don't they let's SCP-999 become a angel and defeat all keter class scp :3
Can you make a video about scp 166?
It's on jupiter why bother
I fell like the scp gonna kill us
beam pictures of shyguy at it Kappa
4:51 is this from among us?
see there's a really depressing ending because there's a different scp,  the last surviving human after project legionnaire fails
Do animation of scp PL-9999 Trust me
Imagine if this was real
Contain jupiter
nothing is indestructible if you nuke it enough times
if it is real or.not first they should make a way to break the should and then destroy it or jam it for some time I think
Can you explain scp 113 please
what're you watching, step son
Just thrown the gate guardian at it or throw it to the gate guardian
''This technology doesn't exist yet to humans :c'' Didn't yall humans wipe out the bigfoots with some big brain technology
I was wondering if u could do SCP-2761 Bananazilla not many people explain it on what is does I want to know more about it like you do on all of your videos
you play roblox?
Only one problem, Jupiter dosnt have a solid surface to land apon. It’s a gas giant.
Its really real we are instant dead for 25 ears?
Use SCP 1000 BIO WEAPIONS
4:52 the rubber was ejected (with among us sounds XD)
mf has them advanced technology but cant avoid IO
Perhaps 2399 were a exploration unit as it didn't seem to be hostile unless it or the drones were threatened. I like these vids you make because it gives me time to ponder these things. and clear my head of certain Nuisances.
Why he look like the peanuts face tho
I mean, they could start throwing every dangerous scp at it to see if it works  Either 2399 would die, or the dangerous SCPs would  It's a win-win situation
Talk about chaos insurgency
I would trully love a video about scp 4005
3:03
nuke it
Dr. bright: just throw a moon at it  Now: scp 2399: neutralized
Hey Rubber. SCP videos are cool and stuff but can you do a video about other topic, after a long time? For example your take of a Slender Man,  Rake, Bridge Worm or Train Eater?
People from 2073: *Panik*
its so cool that he got 1 mil in just a year
The number means earth will end in 2399 year
fun fact: Jupiter in real life is being named as 'the protector of earth' as it suck most of the meteorite that heading for earth
He’s showing off transformers toys   Note: I did see the comment I just wanted to comment it cause I thought about it
Among us 4:52
I should I borrow is hit before the earth I have fighting with I crime scene
4:51 “TheRubber was the imposter”
Tell about scp 2146
How about using Class Safe Like "God" SCP?
videos i want: scp-999, scp-914, and scp-55
2:28 u look so cute
feak
Have they used tsar bombs
Have they used tsar bombs
"There is one rubber amongst us"
How bout they try giving it an order themselves? Using it as a weapon..
?!
way dosent thy faundation try tu atack thy machin when a dron is leveng or coming tu it bicos thy sheld nides tu bey off or atach a nuk tu thy machen
Among us sounds at 4:51
9:23 The Council and the His bois be planning to kill every scp lol
That among us reference when the years changed lol
Bruh just ask 343 to destroy it and then the job is done
why not use SCP 3108?
Scp 5005
I want scp040
Doe scp 040
Ask bright i think he has some ideas
Everyone who looks at a large star: look it’s Jupiter!  Me who know what the big red spot is: look it’s the impending doom of humanity!
He was 200k subs and now a million
If you want an effective emp pulse, you'd need to create one stronger than Jupiter's own magnetic field.   That, or go with the solution that does work: chuck a planet at it
The rubber, my name is [INFORMATION REDACTED]. I am from the REAL site 23. I am impressed with your ability to explain the most complex SCPs. The 05 council has noticed this. You shall expect a promotion in the next year. Remain opsec.
Pipi hands
why are you not my history teacher.
Isn't it simple? All you have to do is send a self-destruct command in the same coding language that its been receiving from its creator and your big bad robot is toast.
4:52 among sus reference 😳😳😳
2399 vs 682
How about guiding a large meteor towards the exact location of 2399?
wow another new scp :)
How do u know this all?
Its probably a machine that explore the universe, cause the universe is too large to explore if a person or alien (probably) does it and will take too long to do it.
Nice animation rubber
imagine this is under foundation's comtrol in the scp 5000 universe
Haha IO go BRRRRRRRRRRR
SCP's are fake
cool
When in doubt. Blow up Jupiter
Seriously where did you get the informations about the SCP?
You need to use scp god :)
The rubber: Among us ruin my life also The Rubber: use the ejection sound in Among Us.
AMONG US REFERENCE!!!!!
I was going to say so it’s in the hurricane on the red spot
alein tech
Literally this is much better than answering my homeworks and class modules
Scp foundation news:there is no scp in jupiter Also people who watch this video:Scp 2399 is in jupiter Scp foundation:Terminate them,no metter where they are...
Wait , are SCP real? Everybody tell me its not real
So, to summarize, these object can either be the Reapers from Mass Effect(except 10x more deadly, and not wanting to assimilate all life) or the Blorg from Stellaris. *AWESOME*
Kinda looks like the hulk buster satellite
The scp foundation can just use super power beam to weaken the shield on 2399 and gif it every singgle WARHEAD THEY HAVE and Scp foundation will get help by ##### army and well we all wish that 2399 will be STOP
The crimson phantom possibly?
This thing looks like that one yu-gi-oh card that can attack 5 times
Turns out Jupiter is a friendly SCP.
i like making wepon ideas so heres a bomb idea..... what if we could create a rocket that has many weapons in it this rocket will be the size of a space rckest and it has weapons such as 20 tsar bombas and 10 electro magnetic discharge bombs the rocket will first deploy or launch the electromagnetic discharge bombs to malfunction and possibly turn off the invisible sheild of the scp and its drones and then it will launch the 20 tsar bombs possibly destroying a big chunk of jupiter but also possibly destroying the scp. if that wasnt enough you could send mini rockets to distract the bot like 1000 sure its expensive but can you even say how more exepnsive rebuilding earth? so if the distraction isnt enough we could also put a super strong shell around the rocket so the rocket wont be destroyed and the rocket will also have electric mats surrounding its body to avoid malfunctioning when the dischargenof the electro missile has occured.... i like doing this i know that this isnt real but i just like making these kind of ideas.  edit: if that wasnt enough make it have a fight with the lizard and scp-001 aka the gate gaurdian edit: also this is better nthan the idea that was shown because it launches the 10 electro magnetic bombs before the explosion also if electricity wouldnt work i would make emp and electro magnetic bombs to surround the entire scp and make them all explode
I'm only 9 years old
This might destroy the earth without a single scratch lol
imagine if the scp foundation is just area 51 staff members trying to tell us the truth but we just think its made up stories
YEPPPPPP I WAS SO SUS ABOUT THE FUCKIN RED DOT ON JUPITER THAT I DIDNT FUCKIN BELIEVE WHAT MY SCIENCE TEACHER SAID
Is dis true
It might be on 2022 because the ghost paper challenge told me
Why jesus is a goddamn scp?
This is weird man Edit: you made it among us also!?!?!!?!!
The fifth planet jupiter
You said that it was damaged by a moon so can't we just launch it at that SCP launch the Moon not our moon the other Moon on Jupiter or something we just need to move it enough
Sometimes the SCP foundation community need to fix their SCP because of the obvious stuff
Easter egg among us eject sound
My teacher somehow love scps You know what he did? He gave us a homework about scps 🤣
I know is neke
I dont want to be that but jupeter dose net have a solit materail it is a gas gaint
How is it not apollyon?

its vilgax
evry new video this man upgrades his drawing skils or faster drawing and faster uploading this man is literary like living in game and going in skills to upgrade them
Is it true 25 years more im scared
God will help us
Why don't you put all the powerful scp's like shy guy,indestructable lizard and other powerful ones you have contained and call that "opperasion scp battle"
This is one of my favorites!
Can you do scp 5099?
Take the godamn parts of the scp away from jupiter
Me: *yeets giant lizard at jupiter*
Retrieve parts from Jupiter to keep it from fully becoming functional
It Might try to protect us or not
This rubber dude is giving us all the information of the SCP foundation and somehow hasn’t been fired yet.
Irony: SCP-2399 was sent to Earth as a defender against what they see in construction to obliterate Earth.
And no one else knows this so It means you work for them
If your telling us this
What about nuking it with EMP's
Schools need this kind of study about scps
come on foundation make something to blow up that scp 2399 add something inside the nuke then it does more damage and destroy scp 2399 I think
just think after it reaches earth just to say bro not cool heres a letter and i dont like your vibe
I am so glad this is not real
hypotethically speaking you could use scp 682 against 2399
Just throw a minecraft water bucket at it then anything is saved.
Plz make a video of scp-173-j olz
Anyone here just want a battle royal between every SCP and see who would win
Till we send in GODZILLA to mess this scp up
Is it real? There's must be something that can destroy
i like the among us reference :O
You, need, a, nook
cool awesome
What If SCP-2399 Came From The Triangulum Galaxy But Left It Because It Wanted To Move To The Milky Way In Jupiter Which Is In Our Solar System And The Triangulum Galaxy Is Sending Commands Just To Make SCP-2399 Remember It's Creator Galaxy  Triangulum.
Your lucky it's at Jupiter
420-J scp animation when
Correct me if I’m wrong, but wasn’t this thing also the thing that shot down SCP 4217-B as a space-faring creature causing it to enter Earth?
Hey rubber do you think that all of the scp's is real?
Have you try using emp nukes i mean the sheild is made of electricity so use emp or electirc bombs i mean atleast try to electrify the sheild to shoot throught
4:54 *therubber was not the imposter*

Maybe thats the jupiters hidding from somthing.
hey SCP-2399 like a blaze from minecraft

?
What about send God
SCP 2399: I am about to destroy the earth. Jupiter and its moons: Allow us to introduce ourselves.
Wasn't that an episode of Max Steel?
It probably detect danger because IO move so slow it cant be danger unless they create slow but powerfull weapon
scientist: its a storm the SCP: you thought the great red spot was a hurricane, but it was me, Dio!
Throw 634 to it.
0:11 looks like R.O.B's head (also know as Robotic oporating buddy)
scp-99999
SCP - 1067 RU
Please do scp-5000
please do SCP-811
Is this true or not?
shoot it into the sun.      i mean jupiter
Scp 2399 is looks like Minecraft blaze
Scp 354 it can
Is this even true im confused •~•         And if it is true ill just kill myself with a knife (metaphoricaly speaking)
thats overpowered
and in next video can you tell us everything about scp 1111
Give It A Piece Of Its Own Medicine Get A Piece Of Debris Of A Part Of 2399 Then Give It A Piece Of Its Own Medicine Or Get In The Damn Thing And Destroy It From The Inside Or Make 1 Of Jupiter's Moons To Land On It
The Rubber ... If this is the great red spot and isn't a storm then... the FBI/S.C.P. foundation may be looking for you since you're sharing this information...
Just chuck 682 at it, one of them has to die anyways
4:46 TheRubber was not the impostor 1 impostor remains
Rubber says to prevent spreading info to the public  Also him: Making a youtube video and showing the public   (Still this video was AMAZING)
so rubber you said that scp 2399 hit io and got damaged i know how to destroy it just use pluto to destroy scp 2399
EM communication from the Triangulum Galaxy, especially when in response to anything happening now, is nonsensical as such communications would take over 2.73 million years one way!  So either the communications aren't from/with the Triangulum Galaxy that's ~2.73 million light years away, or their EM based communications also use time travel.  (To those readers that don't know, visible light, xrays, microwaves, ultraviolet, infrared, etc are all just different frequencies of EM radiation) I'm not even going in the idea that the entire thing is a prank on the SCP foundation and humanity, but it's not like I can totally rule that out either...
Just throw a moon at it or smth
I thought it was halarious for some reason seeing a rubber eraser man throw a rock at a doomsday weapon  like he's without sin.
like  modern machine in 4000
The rubber: *Uploads a SCP video* Me after 000.1 seconds of the upload: Hi.
Oh hell           💥Karen!💥
Pls do SCP - 916 and SCP 796
Oh frick
Make a site 13 video
"malfunction destroyer" so a builder
Or just go to the universe there in and destroy there command and control center and there commander
If Scp foundaison needs a teacher to teach class-d personer you can attent maybe
How to power project LEGONARE   10000 nuclear reactors  Or 1 dyson sphere   Take a pick
Why not get the parts and hide it or it will creat parts
Can you make video about scp 2396❤ Reason:The Scp like to eat candy and then she can make some candy call SCP 2396A. If a girl eat the SCP 2396 there will give no efect.If boy eat the SCP it will automatic turn to SCP 2396B.
The Doomsday
So what about the juno space craft did this big robotty boi salvage and added it to its body
4:51 among us reference
where do get your facts?
SCP-963
5:57 what scp is that or is that just a drawing?
What happens if 2399 will destroy 682?
Can you do "scp-715 my face that i may be"
Can you make scp 999
You know that Jupiter has *NO SURFACE*
If they had entities that could possibly destroy earth y don’t they send one of them to the thing and see if it’ll be able to get destroyed but eh that’s my thinking and this was rlly interesting to listen to
plz do a face revil plzzzzzzzzzzz i like all your videssssssssssssss so plz it will get 100,000,000,000,000,000,00,00,000,000,000,000 likess
Why not ask 343 or 239 to destroy it lol
You just posted this,now we know it,we are scared.
Love the Among us reference
among us vote out sound?
Only thing will save us                       Peace
One way to destroy it it's by taking 10 huge asteroids and smash it together boom DIED
Why not ask SCP-343 to destroy it?
Use magnetic bombs or forces whatever works for you
I really wanna see you do some funny vine and memes.👁👄👁
This would be cool if it can interact with some other SCP's like "The Gate Guardian"
SCP 814
Why don't you ask God to just swipe him out
Why does this scp look like a mythical pokemon Edit: woah! I never got this much likes! Thanks!
What if the scarlet king vs the malfunctioning destroyer who will win?
Can you make scp 1403.i really appreciate that.
Dr. Bob and Detective void both sound like O5 members but the rubbers voice is so funny like hes just telling a story to his grandchildren while the earth is ending
Taking into account that most asteroids are mainly composed of heavy metallic elements, developing a super magnet that disrupts the orbit of an asteroid would be an even better solution.  By flinging asteroids towards the sun, with the right calculations, the celestial projectiles would be then accelerated by sun's gravity and flung back at Jupiter, thus achieving interplanetary artillery that far surpasses any of our current weaponry, a Glorified pebble tosser for instance
Pog
Please do scp 001 please
My favorite scp is scp 4975
We found the last Regi
THERE,S SOO MINY SCP RATE AND I REALY LIKE THE ONE OFF THEME SCP 087
Did anyone see among us
What if we take the other part without it they can't finish reparing scp-2399
destroyers are my favourite
Scp foundation: *Sends Warheads* Earth: is my gravitational pull a joke to you?
Dear ruber Thw next scp video is about 354 aka red pool its intresting we have a question i dont who is scp 354
But like where are these from? Are they made up?
hey theRubber make a face reveal if you have 30M SUBSCRIBE PLS pls pls pls ok ty
scp rubber, appears as rubber and seems to be associated with every scp,
I always can’t sleep just because watching SCP or something . - .
When you hear an explosion: kalm  Youre not watching anything:PANIK
Now I was thinking and I think I may have come up with a possible solution to the problem centering around destroying SCP-2399. The problem is that they can't destroy it from the outside with any weapons due to its defense systems. But I think that's the problem, the foundation has been trying to destroy it from the outside but what if they destroyed it from the inside.   Now I don't know if this has already been proposed or not but we know that the foundation can intercept and stop messages sent to SCP-2399 through a series of satellites around Jupiter. So what if instead they used the capabilities of these satellites to their advantage by sending their own transmissions and messages to 2399, but inside these messages would be that of none other than a virus.   Think about it, a piece of machinery this advanced has to run on some system to continuously run it and control the drones that exit 2399 as well as detect any projectiles meaning to try and destroy 2399. So what if the foundation could send a message to 2399 that contains a virus that could infiltrate the inside of whatever system is keeping 2399 running. Now you may be thinking that it may have some form of security towards that possibly but that's why I say that the foundation first does everything it can to weaken that security through a series of viruses sent and undeniably intercepted by 2399 like that of a trojan horse that it can't deny, so that way a virus could pass through the security and take down the system with this possibly being how the foundation can take out its defense systems (even if temporarily) and then destroy 2399.  So tell me what do you all think of my proposal
I still accept that Dr bright yeeted a moon into it and destroyed it as my headcanon
Wait hold up why not thinking ask scp 342 not being mean or anything ask him can he destroy Scp 2399
Wait why can't they just grab the parts 2399 needs and take them back to earth where it can be studied?
Is this one of the destroyers SCP 1050 speaks of?
Please cover Dr. Bright
Your forgetting when 2339 hit Mechkan head on
gate kepper
send it an email containing 096's face   he will find a way
ok use a $50 laptop run cyber punk 2077 and a 3 dollor power spully and luntch it at 2399
4:50 sound familiar?
H
Face reveal?
This should make a good science fiction novel
Are SCP's real?
Did you scp 999 the tickle monster is way powerfuler than you think you want to know why well you find out for your self
Its goals are beyond out understanding
Is this really fictional?!? Help I'm actually falling in...
What exactly are you made of? Is it like rubber or something else, like that one guy who is made of tofu
Plot twist:after 2399 repaired itself it crashed into mars two moons and 23 year from now it will be neawtralised
If I were an alien and was sending a message to another species, I would say, “sup this is another species please record a message on this hard drive, sorry we couldn’t afford an SSD”
Can you do a video on SCP 2662?
so let me get this straight.   The Foundation figures out that it hit IO and became damaged enough to fall into Jupiter's gravity, HOWEVER they *CANT* figure out to destroy it......................  You answered your problem!   *DROP A MOON ON IT!*
Just Ask Stalin To End This Robot ._.
Why.... does this give me nightmares of a mastery 7, ultra instinct, sniping master, Xerath one trick?
This sounds like one of the SCPs that exist within a vacuum, as in other SCPs are not taken into consideration when figuring how to destroy this one.
Oh no scp overseer is ruleing ark survival evolved
10:32 Look, Its mine! *:D* (Top Right)
You know what might destroy this scp? That nanites bomb from the g.i. joe movie. That shit is scary
What if the push a moon off Jupiter to 2399?😂😂😂
Like scp 682
Shoot scps at it
Scp 2399 is triggered
The Volgun's video on 2399 is much better imo
If SCP-2399 is really coming to earth, then just use SCP-729-J to scare it away. Problem solved!
what scp-5000
add a part two when you destroy it
If I wanted to have a super power to defeat The Malfunctioning destroyer, then I would say an Indestructible Force Field that protects the Earth very well.
This information has replaced something potentially important in my memory.
25 years!?!???!!??!??!??!?!? I-IAM PARNOID I HAVE A CONDITION OF THIS STUFF IM GOING TO DIE!!??!?!!?
Hmm no info on it is allowed on the internet HAVE FUN WITH YOUR KETER CLASS OBJECTS
Isn’t 2399 part of the broken god from the time it wrecked havoc across South America? I could have swore that was part of that ones lore.
It would be cool if scps were real
they should just send something to take some parts not yet found and then destroy it because then it will never be able to complete its self.
Please do life without man
Plot twist: the aliens are just friendly and blew up our ship out of self defense because we tried to blow up their drone, prolonging their peaceful arrival on earth.
We have to 131 years TIL it’s done
Heh heh I'm glad scps arent real Wait their not real right?
Taboo part 2?
Why is there ground on a gas planet?  I know it's just a small detail but such basic mistakes are really annoying.
I feel like some GoI might have some ways to help stop this, say the Church of the Broken god for example. Going based on what is said already, they already have the technology to fight another war of the flesh, and should have built their god by that time.
There is to land on Jupiter wierdo
Just send 343 up there
Send in the Lizard
bruv there is no surface on Jupiter its made up of gas
Aliens: *Were about to destroy the human race*  Jupiter: *Its free real estate*
Is it just me or does that timer indicate that 2399 will arrive on Earth in 2023
foundation: no  the rubber: **posts video of yes**  foundation: FUUUUU
If it can recognize faces can we throw 096 at it?
Try uranium nuke and atomic bombs to defeat 2399
Try to make an Apolloyon scp class video
Day 23 for SCP-001 "When Day Breaks"
Mt mom doesn't believe that scps are real 😔
what  a  bt a  nuke
Just use the worlds best tothbrush
Maybe scp 3082?
so the squid ship thing know this scp?
The last message sent by 2399's controller was to stop repairs and proceed to Earth to eliminate it...  Apparently, they're afraid we'll succeed in finding a way to kill it.
Do Siren head or mega horn
Jupiter doesn't have a surface, it's a gas giant
I'd just rocket propel IO onto Jupiter's surface where 2399 is located....
They should just use the sun like
Scp 999
jupiter has no ground level ffs
SCP 2399 : 100% repaired The other Jupiter moon : it's rewind time
We should get all scp fly it to it
Ita been like 1000 Yeats why anrt we dead that thing shuld bee here Wright now
the storm of jupiter theres not a  scp a battleship  of ww2 era ?
hello it's just something i don't understand : how have we intercepted a message from that far if the message codation wasn't already knowed? and how we can translate it? but for the energy supply why don't we have tryed yed to do an nuclear central made of something immortal like 682? and why do not try to launch some dimentional scp to put this one into it?
I wish I had a plush the rubber!
i would really like to know more about scp-001 daybreak
i really like those fanarts at the end.
In my opinion it makes no sense why they don’t use that weapon they used to destroy the kingdom of abandon with
Send the invincible lizard
the answer is simple so very simple,,,, multiple answer to deal with it which only prove that this is fiction or that those in charge are just stupid
do scp 4666 it is the yule man it comes at Christmas and to ending when it is over
SCP 7777

It is a old hut
SCP:666/THE DEMON TO BACK IN TIME
the destroyer reminds me of the gas harvesting station from Halo 2's: The Arbiter and, The Oracle
The Rubber; The Only Channel That *NEVER* Clickbaits
Hi guys I’m here I’m done with school 🏫
Do you think that the rubbers character could be classified as an scp?
What about SCP 001
Imagine if this was real
How about scp 2030
I think this is already Public even though you said to not to be put Public
Rubbers back to rub one out.   A video that is.
How did all of these SCPs begin? Was this BEFORE the SCP Foundation game? But nobody knew what the call them? Or After, but since they're so weird, people gave them random object classes?
So it's pretty much thanos
Can you do Scp-3567-J
Don't worry humanity won't die to a pice of metal. Because they have arrived.
Why not make a rocket powerful enough to just shove the moon 2399 crashed into into it. The moon damaged it the first time so it could probably work a second time around.
Why can’t you use the scp names god, or scp 001 or use some scp so powerful and is not a kind of thing that will kill use but will curoperate with use to destroy that thing
What do you actually look like
That among us reference
Dr. Bright: Im gonna do whats called a pro gamer move
ad: John Cenas: SKIP! Video: "weaponry."
This is trending too?
I thought dr.bright killed it he ran a moon into scp 2399
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🔻
This is the best one yet, If this was a book or story I would be extremely interested.  I really wanna know what happens lolll!!
Can you do scp 966
Just send chuck norris he break that shiled whit one hit
The only way to destroy it is to send in One Punch Man
SCP-2399 Planet Jupiter
Hey TheRubber you should make a video about scp-087
Just listen to dr bright for once. Throw that goddamn lizard at it. If it fails it will mostly likely die and of it kills it problem solved. And if neither one of them dies then just sedate 682 and boom
Yooo last place on trending 🥳🥳
Jüpiter is a gas giant :|
dude, you’ve GOTTA do a part two with the discovery notes and other addendums!
Out of everything they tried couldnt they have use the scp anonmolys to help? Like the machine that has the abity to upgrade something?
I just realised: Jupiter actually stops most meteors from hitting Earth with its gravitational field. Just like it sucked in 2399. Clever.
Idk why but it reminded me of Reapers
Io saved humanity once, it can do it again  put engines on Io and send it hurtling into jupiter   after it is destroyed,  hijack the probes on other moons and reverse engineer the tech
kaleramic destablizers caused other versions of scp 2399 to collapse itself with vibrations.
Can you do scp-5000
will we survive this thing. i dont want to die, im only 10
please scp 5333 plsss❤
Thanks Jupiter

If only scp 106 is nice to cooperate or scp 682
'2399 comes to earth' SCP 2000: Its rewind time
This is fun to watch
Strap a rocket to io AND FLY IO AT 2399
How to make SCP-2399 no longer a threat to out civilisation: 1. Use reverse sygnal translation to produce a message saying: "Abort mission, disable all systems permanently, including communications and weapons" and send it to 2399.  How to permanently destroy SCP-2399: 1. Input the strongest EMP device our technology can provide into SCP-914 (if it converted a regular pistol to a gun that completely disintegrated all matter in it's line of fire, imagine what it can do to to an EPM). 2. Set it to "Very fine" to get an anomalously powerful EMP as a result. 3. Install a lot of powerful rockets on one of the jupiter's bigger moons and wait until the moon is in a position near the destroyer. 4. Use the anomalously powerful EMP on the destoyer to disable it's shields and weapons. 5. Launch a heckton of nukes on it, then the rocket propelled jupiter's moon just to be sure. 6. Celebrate.
Do you know that your animation  videos was copied and translated by a channel? 😓
Dr. Bright just comin in by throwing a moon at it, single handedly saving the planet
Destroyer u say? Awake the beerus!
I hope that they do scp 413 next .
Random memes on random videos that i like: Chandler:never wins a challenge Charli/trash:never loses haters Albert/flamingo:never doesnt spit in a video
@TheRubber During the night at my house I see strange mist clouds That are shaped like humans, if you would like more info my discord is BenChewy#1482
Scp 2399 vs scp 682, anyone know what will happen
Is this real
You lie because we need a big enough makanikal devise
#50 on Trending! Good job!
Y'all are simply doing anything you can to avoid becoming slaves of Lucifer as you have forced us into within the environment of our world.
Y'all leave that SCP along. Not only would you be wasting time, money and research, but you'd also be haggling with something that is not only responsible for leashing the slaves of Lucifer, which, congratulations, but also something that has great healing abilities from a long distance. Your goal is as much bullshit as is your explaination
Anyone that knows things about scps... Why are there so many scp001's?
"How bad is their auto-pilot?"
"The Rubber is not The Impostor"
I have a idea you can make!
Hello Rubber!!! I love your Chanel!
This was made on my brithday
How is this true if Jupiter doesn’t have a surface
Not shure if it was an 2399-J or an official record. But Dr. Bright maniged to YEET one of Jupiters moons at SCP-2399 and successfully destroyed it. Again! I am not fully shure of it was official or SCP-2399-J. Plz comment if you know.
Why don't we use other scps like 682 (if we can even manage) or try using 343 to try and destroy it or do something about it
Destroyer just wants to launch a core nucleus.......(mindustry)
Why not send scp 343 God or have an scp send it to an pocket dimension?
Wait... Isn't Jupiter made from gas? I  feel like this isn't true...
Should i say it???   I think i should..            Jupiter isn't solid and has no surface  Its a giant pile of Gas with only solid chunks orbiting it or in its atmosphere
Ooooooh so that’s how 2020 started
Can u do siren  head
I been playing the scp role play game on Roblox  It includes scps  It includes guns It includes viruses I got vip I wasted money *it was worth it*
but we will have meteor shower insted of doomsday

Scp 9826, also known as "the rubber scientist" is a small creature with a rectangular head and fingerless hands. 9826 is aloud to freely roam the facility and has been labeled safe. 9826 has not made any attempt to escape, but seems to be fully capable of escape. 4839 currently works at the facility, and has full understanding of english. (Ngl the rubber do be lookin like an scp)
Now this is why pandora’s box is a thing. To throw barely controllable anomalous entities at even more powerful anomalies and hope it works.
so you are telling me you couldn't even ask scp 343 to teleport it away or something
Plot twist: it was going to the sun
I thought the big red spot was a big tornado because people sayed its a tornado
Tell them to use acid
1:25 WHERE ARE YOU
Yo imagine if this is on our planet
*M Y   F A V O R I T E   S C P.*
Easy fix why not use 343 to destroy it
Issei hyodo?????
4:52 the rubber was not an impostor
YOU are the one who rubs.
Is it possible to destroy it with another SCP.. because it seems fairly probable that they could do that.
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES MY FAVORITE SCP!
Image a researcher found a more efficient way to stop SCP-2399 just in time to develop it but he forgot to save the word file
what if COVD-19 is a keter class SCP?
The best part of this scp is that dr.Bright yeets a moon at the thing and basically destroys it. Don't know how, but he did. This is why the foundation keeps him around despite all his tomfuckery
So the thing is running off of orders from god knows where why don’t we just try hacking the thing ourselves
Is it just me, or does SCP-2399 look a bit like Celesteela?
No
I predicted this in my dream...
But you literally just. Told us.
SCP : what should we do to protect earth ? GOC : Destroy anomalies GRU-P : If you can't protect earth cononize space with clone
thank you jupiter
THE f#$@ HOW DID IT GET THERE
The rubber was not the imposter...
You should do SCP-049-J next. :D
Plot Twist: Hes showing off his spaceship to take over the world
It’s Io (Eye-yo). Jupiter might have a surface of sorts but the animation looked more like it was on a rocky moon than a gas giant.
4:50 he used a sound from among us
Everyone:will we die... Mr.Beast:Buying SCP-2399 to save the earth.
I got a add about some scp books so that sounds cool
Rubber Was not the Imposter 4:51
Hey man good job on getting on trending!
If the SCP foundation has god contain i think why dont they tell god the reason and let him help them
I love all those story's, :D
4:51 rubber was ejected
This is much better than online class i think?
Ammm... Shepard? Do a thing!
I think you shoud do long horse he is a infinint creature that protect`s people i would vary like if you made a video all about him
Are scp real
could this be related to the war criminals ?
If u guys watch he's vid on contain the bismarck I think this is what the octopus is talking about
I wanna know if you can retrieve one of the parts and disguise it with multiple bombs that can wipe out anything and I mean anything and once it's inside or near the thing it can detonate Would it do something
He teaches me more then my science teacher teaches me
10:00 Bruh, just tell DR. Bright not to touch it and leave him unsupervised. He will either succeed or cause instant apocalypse.
What SCP 2399 could be. ● S.W.A.T. Unit. ● Recon Scout.
This SCP is pretty close to reality. IRL that spot contains one of my Relay Beacons that allow me and many many other things to stay active in what otherwise is a complete and udder deadzone. Remember, earth is located well within the Galactic Dead Zone. An area of space wich is a fukton more dangerous than anything else. Many Civilizations have formed here, thanks to the abnormaly large ammount of "Origin" Tier Systems but just as many have Perished or left this space as soon as possible. It is pretty rich in otherwise rare materials though and there are a few pretty much regenerative sources of otherwise non-regenerative materials like Uranium ... making this place absofucking lutely ideal for a Interstellar civilization to exist, thrive and surpass anything that existed before.  (And Humanity has existed for a very long time in this area and is fully + well adapted to it (Plus protected thanks to the Oort field that also maintains the Oort cloud.)
I hate how he speaks like it would literally happen like it's all real... I'm scared
Why do I think Elon Musk is with the foundation? He trying to send us to mars
I love THE RUBBER because he always adds funny moments in his videos....  Love from INDIA
He dID ThE amONg uS meme
What tf I dont want to die :<
Me:Hold up what about the god from last episode just ask him to book destroy it
Next: SCP 169 The Leviathan
Same
2399: Unstoppable.  Me, as an Intellectual: *find and takes 2399's parts away somewhere else from Jupiter*
How does "TheRubber" know all this? I think he is a ESCAPED SCP!!!!
Barrier unit 53 looks like r.o.b from Nintendo well his head does
Can you think how it would be if SCP foundation was real?
Why don’t you just use the upgrade machine?
Hello mr rubber can u explain scp 999 (the tickle monster) object class:safe
wait its like a guardian like in BoTW
The rubber was not an impostor 2 impostors remain
Why SCP-343 doesn't help Foundation for this, like creating more energy for the plan?
I would honestly pay my teacher to just let me go home and watch these videos
send the damned reptile up there, eventually, it will evolve enough to take it out
Why don't they just take and contain peace of the scp
Is this real pls some tell me rubber is it real pls some tell I am so scared
But what happens if we send 343 there?
well now if it gets reapared it might kill us because the fucking scp foundation is a dumbass what if it was god damn frendly and the scp foundation has doomed us
Bro just take the materials before the droids can 🤷🏾‍♂️
So Jupiter has magnetic sorce
Pls make a video about site 13
*Meteorites, this thing and anything else which can destroy Earth* Exist  Jupiter: That’s not gonna happen my friend
but why haven't they tried using any scps?..
True
where is his or her angel
This scp can destroy the world 😱😱😱💀💀💀
I have a history of something paranormal I Call it as 23 of disember  2019 was coming. 27 of disember i go to sleep i had a good dream but when i woke up  there was something strange it was night time? And no one was in my house but i had 13 i was not scered of that i was gong to see the moon but i see something else a strange creature made of puré darkness looking at me with white ayes he extend 2 of his 8 arms and his had tíll my window but then a ligth hit it i cadent see what was it but was humanoid and my ayes close i dream something and woke up it was a biutifull day and i think it was just a bad dream i see my phone it was 24 of disember?  Then i ask my mom how she sleep and she told me she had a nigthmere that i was gong and all my family go out to search me.
I'm really into scp foundation and scp related stuff so I have big knowledge and maybe some solutions to their problems UwU
They could ask for 343 help, maybe he could somehow destroy scp 2399?
Please tell me this is not real
Why don't they ask 343?
If SCP-2399 comes to earth, wouldn't SCP-001 be powerful enough to destroy SCP-2399?
Bruh just throw the lizard
Scp 001 and scp 000
4:51 TheRubber was not the impostor.
"CONSTANT VIGILANCE"                                   -madeye moody
Maybe 2399 is a reconnisance station so aliens can keep an eye on humanity
The destroyer of the Broken God
Do you work at scp foundation and if this is real i will die young
If saitama is true maybe he can destroy it
Earth: wat is that? S.C.P-2399: come here you gonna die Earth: OH SHIT Jupiter: no worries i got you S.C.P-2399: OOF! Jupiter: COME HERE BOY S.C.P-2399: NNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Why not just use item 001?
This is what the last human talked about
Since when did the rubbe spoke English
Tbh illustrated’s version is spbetter
But isn't Jupiter a gas and has no true surface the parts of scp-2399 would fall through Jupiter so unless the parts are floating but it would fall through because of it gravity
I hope theres gonna be a poptart scp vid later on
are we really both saying I.O. as two separate letters instead of a word not only in the narration but the subtitles? Yeah? Alright, this'll not be a deep dive on the channel.
THE SCPS ARE REAL I GOT AN AD ABOUT THEM
Can I just remind y’all folks that Jupiter’s a gas giant, aka no rocks such as shown in the video...
SCP-2399: *exist* The foundation: the information about this SCP is secured The Rubber: RUSUREABOUTDAT?
I love Scp-079 I dont know why its just the first SCP i was introduced to when i first learned about the game
“But we must try. We must do something.” *SLURPS DOWN A CUP OF COFFEE*
Io be like: haha spaceship goes qwertyasdfgofvckurself
Looks like Thanos through another moon.
Myself:is this true Me:nahh....
No, this is a futuristic eva
This one Is Looks Like A Pokemon
when you put nintendo with jojo
Looks like a Ben 10 kind of character lmao
.
Why the dont use scp 343 to destroy it?
Boble the clown pls
this scp is cool
I hear Gas Gas Gas music the more video he post
Are we just going to ignore that Jupiter have Surface in this video?
Use the coffee machine and order a cup of 2399 enough times to where it can’t get past 75% completion
The thing is: if we destroy it, there’s good changes they’re just gonna send a  worse/bigger/better one or more
I cant believe that the rubber was the imposter
Why dont they ask scp 343 to destroy scp 2399
Gust hurl io at it again or a different moon
Why not beat it at its own game? Collect its debris first.
Here's an idea: Talk to the aliens. Just talk to them. It's that simple. If you launch bigger bombs, it'll just make the aliens more angry. I can think of two reasons the aliens would want to attack us. Either the aliens don't know much about us, and are worried we'll try to destroy them, or they think we're not advanced enough to be worth anything, and we might as well all die. TALKING TO THEM WILL SOLVE BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS. And if they still want to kill us, go ahead and use the bombs. Throwing bombs at them without communicating with them is like throwing toothbrushes to kill a dragon. It's never gonna work, and it's just gonna cost a lot. And then when you realize small toothbrushes don't work, YOU JUST THROW BIGGER ONES. BY THE TIME YOU CAN GET A TOOTHBRUSH BIG ENOUGH TO KILL THE DRAGON, IT'S ALREADY HAD TIME TO BURN DOWN THE VILLAGE. AND ESCAPE. NOW YOU'RE DEAD. If you lure the dragon out if the village then no one has to die. And if that doesn't work, THEN you start throwing toothbrushes. Bombs should be used if all else fails, not as a first attempt. I can't believe nobody has thought of this. And sure, the technology needed to contact the aliens is expensive, but so are the bombs, and if spending a few extra pennies on advanced technology could prevent the apocalypse, It's probably worth it.
Scp 999 . Because it the cutest scp
For all that dont know until no, ni scp is not real its all just great creativities of people of the world and thats amazing enough i feel
wait then what is scp 343 for ? just ask him
Plot twist: it’s the worlds greatest coffee machine
Good idea: dig inside jupiter and put explosive stuff
If the drones need the parts and debris to repair it, how about having the foundation track the parts themselves and steal them to prevent 2399 from fully repairing itself
Can we see the foundation or is it all fake
Lol among us
The SCP Foundation: telling false information about the great red spot for people not to be scared TheRubber: tells us that they are telling false information  Me:it isn't a secret now is it
I know this is the category, 'Fictional'.  *But...* Jupiter is just a big ball of gas, there is no land or ground on Jupiter.  (Cough'' Cough'',  0:02 - 8:07)
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤   Scp-2399
SCP-1875 Antique Chess Computer pls rubber
I wonder why the foundation doesnt use another scp to destroy it. Like .... God?
PROJECT KEEPAWAY is an effort to per-preemptively collect remnants of the Destroyer and to place them in a location where the Destroyer itself can't attack.  Once that is done, a killzone will be established to intercept incoming repair drones.   This may offer a way to extend the deadline to the Destroyer's reactivation.
YOU MUST NOT WATCH ANY VIDEO WITH THE NAME AS ROKO'S BASILISK (if you only take it seriously it will activate its a very real info hazzard...)
Have it pee on a spark plug that kill the engine 😐
Tsar bomba the bich
Its just a animation
I thought it was discovered when someone was looking in a telescope way before 1963?
How hasn’t the rubber been arrested by the government yet
Why not try to find the debris first and destroy them?
This is all fake but whatever take god scp idk and ask him to destroy this alien thing bye
I love the ruber
Congratulations Rubber your video is trending!! 🥳
is this actually true, or just pretty well made up stories...?
Why does it look like emerald weapon from FF7?
Pls.scp 999
Why not retrieve parts of 2399 to earth.
I do heard about this SCP
Scp 999
Color scheme reminds me of Samus
Why didn't they just use rovers or drones to steal scattered parts on Jupiter and its moons to delay/prevent its repairing?  I mean originally this scp is actually entirely else right? Something that's actually good.
If you wanna know if scp is real, grow up and go to the hole of jupiter
Why dont they just get as many scps and yeet them all at the thing. Like it will 1. Do nothing 2.Kill all the scps 3. kill the scp 2399. For instance launch the invincible aligator, and get popcorn and watch cuz one of them will die. Or nothing will hapend.

alie+n spcs are cool about scp 163 for the nexxt video? or scp 1342
Then Bright just freaking chucked a moon to that thing.
Can you make SCP-000-also known as error
why just not use scp 343 to stop him
Can you do SCP-745 a.k.a. The Headlights it's interesting because it can communicate by changing the light and it can not survive a week in captivity.
if Kim Jong Un gets them nukes....
Do think that who or what created SCP - 2399 would want their creation back ?
4:51 Nice Among Us Easter Egg here
Information about an scp is so real to make someone actually believe it
btw do apollyon scp 3999 also known as,"i am at the center of evrything that happens to me."
Why didn't they call scp-2399 drones as  2399 - 2
"Are to completely supress any knowledge pertaining to 2399"  701k people:OH SH-
Wait,is this video cause of my comment?
solution, through 682 into Jupiter's spot.
I like that he puted some among us stuff
Now that we know about it the false information does not work now
Cant you just find the parts and bring them to earth to see what you can do?
What if 2399 was actually going to Mars instead of earth because aliens live in Mars and was a threat to the galaxy, maybe 2399 thought who actually was attacking it was the aliens on Mars, it's still a possibility.
Explained SCP 001    PLEASEEEEE3EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
5:59 this reminds me of soemthing. Pls do research of scp 001 pls 🥺🥺🥺
Why are people disliking your videos
4:51 among us reference lol
Huhu
Why does 2399 looks kind of like overseer boss from Ark: Survival evolved?
I know how to defeat it use astriods to destroy it with gravity pull to but it at a far away galaxy and by putting it in another galaxy we could destroy it's builder/fixer to not complete the 100% form
1985 was the impostor
pls like my comment for idea: SCP1875
😶😶😶😶👍👍👍👍👍👌👍👌👍👌👍
Why don't you ask SCP god 2 kill kill the that SCP
Honestly they have world ending beings under there control just use one of those to wipe it from all of reality
4:51 getting voted out
Hey jupiter is gas giant right?
Scp 2399:I WILL DESTROY EARTH earth:AH NO THEY WILL DESTROY MY PEOPLE AND ME!! jupiter:I GOT U LIL SIS   Jupiter:*never Ending pain*
Thank god scps aren't real
HEI I WANT TO ASK DOSE THESE SCPS ARE REALLY REAL OR THEY JUST TALES I LOVE SCP I WATCH ALL SCP VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE BUT ON SOMEVIDEOS IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS JUST A JOKE  BECAUSE ANY OF US SEE THE SCP FOUNDATION ANY OF US LISTEN ABOUT THEN IF YS PLEASE TELL ME BUT DONT LIE
04:51  Among us
Dr: Bright: oh hey i been playing Orbit Simulation...remember that thing got dmg because it crash on the moon first place? How about  *Cobra Commander voice* We drop it.
For me It doesn't exist
Send scp 682 to kill it
Among jupiter
if the scp donest have the shild the scp foudtain will be able to destory the scp
Theruber was not the imposter 4:50
Scp 001 is a kill scp 2399
Yep
Dr. Bright: Yo homies i just fired the moon at 2399 and destroyed it
What if we were to send 682, it is indestructible and better yet, it could destroy both 2399 AND 682. If you can answer this please do.
SCP 3700 known as the tides of war pls.
2399 protecting its own kid is the nicest thing about it
Please scp 1503
Plot twist:it was sent to us so it could help us from an unknown danger(sorry for bad english tho)
Send scp-682
This will end a long time ago of they said  to scp 2399  self destruct ofanother lamguage
4:51 Good Referance
So we can interpret and block the signals they are sending as commands but we can't just rehash or understand the code enough to issue it a command ourself?
I just read about this one and I'm so glad you made this one!!!!!
2030 plss
can you do about the scp named "hatefull star"? (im not sure wether thats the name tho...) Also Love your videos :D keep up the work.
Love the animation ❤️.
if they sent one ship and that ship died why they no sent another one I think they r stupid enough to not add another ship to attack us lol
Foundation: 2399 is regaining its lost parts Dr. Bright: Chainsaw cannons.. Foundation: 2399  has recieved the signal to destroy earth Dr. Bright: More chainsaw cannons Foundation: CHAISAW CANNONS ARE NOT THE ANSWER!  Dr. Bright: But Chainsaw cannons paired with Io is..
In 25 years I will be 31 years old

red spot suss
Couldn’t you use an scp to fill the EMP for the destruction of 2399
what if you make a scp - 2099 drone  and go inside of the scp-2099  and make it self destruct if it doesnt kill it . It will atleast it will damage from the inside  (hopefully)
but Jupiter is a gas giant
my personality: *believing everything that is in the internet except ads  my brain: oh jeez, we need to find another planet me:we are all dead >_>
Just sayin. Why dont they collect the parts and move them towards the sun. I mean be a lot easier to take away a bandaid rather than to take one off someone else. And for it defending from us takeing the parts. They probably cant attack if it dosent have a way to see you. So if you look for parts away from the drones, it most likely cant denfend those part.
he used among us reference  surely he is the most respected entity in this entire multi-verse.
We had bombs, then found nuclear fusion, then made nuclear bombs, make a nuclear EMP
I think scp 4217 is once battling scp 2399 before
Good bye jupiter
Hold on I realized bright is good friend with manny powerful Scp.  Why don’t he ask a god Scp to eradicating this ship  But then! Why don’t the développe instead a way to communicate with 2399! We may be able to know it’s intentions and even better! Change its intentions or communicate with it
Dr.bright: indesctrucble. WE SHALL SEE. *legit asks god scp*
Imagine that this scp was here for popcorn or something
2399 been around since 1963...dam it even has repair drones
25 Years, im gonna die
Peanut boy. I don’t blink to destroy. I destroy if **you blink**
Why don’t they just ask the scp- GOD for earth’s fullest protection
bro Jupiter has thunderstorms and all that cracked up wind as a gas giant, there's just no way this would be happening
Necrons....
4:52 a among us therubber was   the imposter
Its sad that the 1st thing humans always go for, is the violent approach to anything they don't understand, Shoot 1st wonder why later, that is thy our own stupidity will end us as a species and the universe will be a better place for it,
Jupiter don't have solid surface!
Me: Watching all SCP videos just because of making Site 21 in Minecraft
Well it's been fun on earth
- when you get an SCP book ad on an SCP video -
They could just change the message and try ti send it to scp 2399 at the rigt frequency
Among Us
*moon bae*
Its look cool
Do Scp 1265 and Scp 250
Because if this is true, we all are gonna die.
Hold on, is this a myth or is this true?
The Rubber: Misinformation has so far prevented the general awareness of SCP-2399. Also The Rubber: * Makes a whole video on it *
is this real or not
Actually if the foundation is able to decode the message sent from 2399's HQ why don't they send a fake message including self destroy or just tell it to retreat anyways?
wait....remember SCP-4217? He showed images about his "memories", and from these images there was scp 2399, and it replaced itself with this scp.....what this could mean? Are they related?
Next god road of kill pls pls
What is Bismarck the SCP was what they were after the thing that can power a whole ship by itself no energy source
how about nukes or ICBM MISSLES
You should do the 3 moon syndicate next
Scp2521
Doom anyone?
Yo Rubber I got one for you  I'd like to  See SCP 343 God. Run into SCP 2845.The Dear. Don't even know if I want to see them fight. It would just be interesting to know  what God's talk about.
When people nuke   2399: hehehheh e Netheriter: are ur sure 2399: :o puts catus  Boooooooooom wait can we send scp 001
8:33 did you say god knows what?
What about we send all 10 000 atomic bombs from the U.S and Russia to SCP-2399.
Scp 343 can’t help?
They should just make scp animated series
well that thing looks harmless to me who knows maybe is here to help us with the other scps
Are these real?
The rubber could you do 2928 next  iwant to know about her☺️
That message is so motivational
“Just throw the lizard at it” - Dr Bright
Wait HOLD UP
Wait is this real? Tell me pls
Lol I made this scp
Can you make a video about SCP-4666? please...
Algorithms
Wait hold the phone sooooo are all of those scp real? If it is umm never going out!!!!! Don't wanna die!! I'm scared...  well can some one be my friend :( pls im lonely cuss CORONA 🙏 comment if u want to be my friend pls
I'll wait for 25 years until the part 2 will be release
Your animations just get better and better you might be lonely, but u have us ;)
The Problem is how did 4217 know anything about 2399, i feel like 2399 come to earth for 4217
the fact that jupiter has no rocks and just a gas destroys this whole scp
I bet that scp-2399 the repairing is now over right because it's been years now so it could be now done right
the rubber was not the impostor..
Not only in Scp universe Jupiter has always protected us from countless Civilizations destroying Asteroids IRL too
Scp 1875 is a game and a lot more than addictive game play
You guys should do scp 217, just an idea, it's the clockwork virus.
4:50 likes among us
Goofs 0- 1:11 Jupiter has no solid surface and io never collided and 2399 never created the red spot  Take note im not new ok
Got a problem?  *Nuke it*
Now i know what is in the great red spot
Is Scp real? A.Yes B.No C.Maybe but not sure  Edit:Also here some letters: D.God will be the answer Edit: I think black hole
This my most favourite SCP
This.... could be great movie.
2021 : *WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN!*
It is true that an emp will sort of shut it down, but isn’t the first step to shut down that antimatter field? I mean one clue to be able to pass through its field is to use parts that were scattered and somehow convince it to bring it into the field with a bomb capable of destroying it or rendering it incapable of function. And since it was easily damaged from its impact, they just need something powerful enough to damage it even further. It’s just technology, we can disassemble it and gather information so that we can either replicate it or use the tech to guard other the other scp, even try to fix some of them
Well scp foundation itself is more advanced than we ourselves
Not possible lol Jupiter has no solid surface lol
Steal the parts
What SCP means
Scp 2399 destroys Earth  Scp 682 finnaly a worthy apponent our battle Will be ledgendary
Uhhhhh isn't Jupiter a gaseous planet tho?
Scp cybrog girl
I'm ashamed of all the little idiot kids thinking they're cool blowing off school. Gonna be really dope when you find out you have no skills or anything else but hey you know what an SCP is!
*messages logged* ██/██/1971- Unit is damaged: Repair ██/██/1985- Updating Orders: Maintain Position: Repair ██/██/1985- Period of radio silence, BARRIER Array is established. ██/██/1996- Unit is out of range of target: Proceed to planet #3 in system [COORDINATES REDACTED]: Repair ██/██/2015- Unit is out of range of target: Proceed to planet #3 in system [COORDINATES REDACTED]: Priority is target: Cease repairs
I love science but listening to this makes me hate science cuz they be lying to us
In my guess ya'll should steal one piece which the drones have not found yet so it would never repair it self
If they come to earth, the first thing i will do is ask if the Earth is flat. If they say no, i laugh at thise believers and if they say yes, I will jump into a volcano.
What if it is just a container storing some garlic bread sent by alien Tom Scott
7:03
use gamma rays it is the most strongest energy in the world if thier is no energy pulsei try that
Me 1yers old me saying mulfacon
Is this all scp are real because I am scared when we listen scp stories
SCP-5001 pls
SCP-2399: You can't defeat me  Earth: I know but they can  Jupiter and IO
I wonder if that SCP is real or not though
The only way to destroy it is with scp 343
Why not just use another scp to kill it? Heh
Earth: HELP THERES A MACHINE THAT CAN WIPE MY PEOPLES  Jupiter: I got chu homie
next video isthe strongest scp in the universe tell in the next video
Mr rubber maby you can make a video over sirenhead
I wanna se scp-2521
First a second there i thought we were all going to die in the next 100 days but then I realized it's going to take a few years so its fine
Ugh, so many plot holes. If the communication is electromagnetic as stated, it must travel at the speed of light at the fastest. If the galaxy the communication comes from is so far away, how do they even know it is damaged yet? Galileo supposedly saw the collision and aftermath, so it was at latest in 1642. The signal should not have even reached 2/10^6th of the way back yet.
Send the God-Scp to it and it would do the trick :)
it sad because scp foundation and all scps are not real
I think I have found a way to destroy 2399. Simply use the anomalous coffee machine (which can dispense any liquid in the universe), and order a cup full of scp 2399. Repeat the process until 2399 is left vulnerable. Or just use a god to simply erase it from the universe ;-;
But scp doesn't need to contain it because it will be destroyed by Jupiter's high pressure and temperature in its lower atmosphere. Also there is no ground in jupiter its nearly 100% gas
Irony. The destroyer is repaired and continues on to it’s targets 682 and the Star that Hates
i got a new scp that u never heard off scp called scp 4975
I hope Therubber make a video about SCP-001 The Gate Guardian
Why not ask 343 to butt fuck it
do scp 2021
Please do SCP-4666, its so dang good.
I got an idea destroy the parts
The SCP has no rules. Anything can happen. With everything the scp has knowledge of, the laws of physics, reality,  and biology are basically humans way of saying it can’t happen because we can’t do it. I compare this to if god exists and he is all powerful, and created everything. Who created god? And could he create a being stronger than himself enough to kill him? This making him either not all powerful and or not god. Not understanding something or unable to achieve something doesn’t make it impossible and cannot ever happen.
How ablout just threw one of it's part into the blackhole :v
How about SCP 1788 :the adults. For the next animation?
I am an 11 years old kid and I'm watching this stuff because I really like SCP videos. I did read about many SCP'S (I even read the mask. the moment when it's picture changed scared me extremely but that was a year of two years ago)
Just grab a part
i will use this to destroy my school                                            -7 yr kiddo
This is 1000000000x better than online class 😴😴😴😴
Imagine, this is reverse psychology. The government creates a fictional organization on the goal to secure contain protect the world from Anomalies and supernatural events for us to know the information but in reality it’s all real information and we just don’t know. It’s fake but real and it’s right in our face.
try weaponizing some of the contained SCPs I assume 1 of them would be effective against it.
I was just thinking if scp 682 was fighting scp 2339 who will win
Is this a reference to darling in the franxx?
The orders intercepted mentions a target on planet 3 of the system (earth).  Considering everything within the SCP world, how can we be sure that Humanity is the target?  thinking logically, SCP 2399 is so overwhelmingly powerful to us that its either sent to just destroy all life it comes in contact with, or it's not humanity that its after.   it could be after 2845, 682, 2317, 610 or even whatever 001 is.  these anomalies could be dangerous enough to cause alien races to try to seek and destroy it
Make part 2
Scp 001
so you mean we have 25 years? wow i really would wanna try to help
Scp23999
I literally looked at this scp at random yesterday, and then it gets animated... What are the odds?
Since 1971, SCP-2399 has been the recipient of an unending stream of electromagnetic-based communications originating in the Triangulum Galaxy, roughly 3 million light years from Earth. The means of SCP-2399's travel to our solar system, and the means of its communications, are all unknown.
finally, scp 2399. I didn't understand s*** when I read it, and your illustrations made it so clear to me
These stories that dont include big amounts of blood/gore or any disturbing images are so good. Please do more of these, maybe SCP-457?
make a part 2 of this plss plsss
thanks for jupiter saving us
Maybe change the incoming  message to something else?
Fire 682 at it, one of them will die one less problem one way or another lol
rubber uploads one video in a week
Do scp 999?
Why can’t we try to use other scps, like use a bit of 001’s power if we can of course
I am glad scp content is getting treading
Hey rubber theres no way that thing will detroy us before the scarlet king will we he has 4 more years until  world ending
i have  suggestiions scp 999 / 131/ the clockwork
How this scp and the robot in jupiter jupiter is gas
Guys, you may have seen some Chinese channels similar to the rubber on yt or tik tok. In fact, he is not copying, he is for people who cannot understand English to watch the Chinese version of the rubber. So, if you see the Chinese version of the rubber, please don't say that they were copying; and the rubber is Malaysian, but his voice actor is American.
Let dr bright yeet 682 at it,only two things can happen 682 dies or 2399 gets destroyed
I want a video in 25 years
4:50 THERUBBER WAS THE IMPOSTOR
the actual hero was IO
Why not either attempt to send a moon towards it or launch nukes at it so the radioactivity will decay it through half life
Arent you dr.bob? Wth?
Is North Korea involved?
anyone see my red drone
I want to see a scp also known as crooked man
I have theory scp 2399 will not attack earth just going home to there galaxy
hi
Looks like the space ship from movie zim
scp 2295
It would kind of be cool if it came to our world and Horeible well all die but at least we know the scp Foundation is real if that happens
Scp-2399 Vs Nokia 3310
I love the vids and the knowledge
Is this true and if so just get it to self destruct by making your own massage
Dr Rubber You Can Use Scp-3000 Or Scp-682
What if that scp fight with scp 682 🤔
I want to hire this SCP. Also, those repair drones are so cute! I wonder if it is possible to communicate with it and say "hey, we come in peace, here's the wifi password"
a new rule should be added "Dr. Bright is not allowed to use any SCP's in an attempt to destroy SCP-2399 unless an order was given from the 05"
Thank you for telling the story of scp -2399
All I can say is, continue the animation. Reminds me a lot of what Chinese animators do with their square-like emojis.
That's doom right there
I have a idea.... why instead of using the normal ideas. Why not use the more powerful and *FRIENDLY* Scps to help? Like the reality warpers? God and...... uh....  that's all I got. We can try throwing 682 at it?
Ask scp 343 “god” to help with the destruction
Shout out to big bro Jupiter
Will scp 343 save us???
So detailed😂😂😂
This is my favorite SCP.
How do i join?
is this real?
...... Fun
And when the last part of scp 093 ?
How many parts of scp 610 will be?
This game is just a parody of itself nowadays isn't it?
Scp-363 next please 🙏🙏🙏
can we have more “Safe” class objects? they are just more engaging videos to watch.
That scp looks awesome as heck
The core
who can hear some few Among Us  SFX

After it comes to Earth: before we begin with the apocalypse, a word from our sponsor, Nord VPN, who made possible the communication to my home galaxy
I have a question rubber
We know that Jupiter doesn’t have land right? It’s just a gas planet
4:52.         .               •   .       .   •        ●        .        .     .       .    •        .     .     The Rubber was.not the Imposter .      • .   .   .   1 Imposter remains
Hide the pieces?
I think SCP 2399 want to help us with something coming from outside space, it comes to earth cuz he wants to help us, if not then We need to be ready, 'he is stronger every day We are making him mad'
bruh 2399 just vibing in Jupiter, we really just gotta leave it alone
Is this real
where the GOC when we need them
Cats: meow Dogs: woof 9-year-olds: *FIRST FIRST*
You are not first, You are not last, But most certainly Nobody asked
SCP-2399: I’M INDESTRUCTIBLE!!  Dr. Bright: I’m about to end this SCP’s career!
for the time being they should probably fire some of their worst scps that they were trying to terminate anyway at it, like the unkillable lizard... or if all else fails doctor bright? don't know what he would do, but that wouldn't be too smart, he'd himself stuck with no way of retrieving his amulet for eons... maybe he should be left out of that...
Plz say that this is fake...
2030:
Fire nuclear weapons at that thing
Wait, I actually want to see this SCP in its fixed form
Please make a part 2 of this. It's so very interesting.
Jupiter Is Our Big Papa He Protect Us From Meteors And Aliens And........ Scp
I rather watch this than listen to backpack kid
what if we let scp 515 move the day it comes and see if asteroids damage or even gives us time while it is destroying the asteroids?
Try magnet just theory
If this SCP were to be completed. It feels like it would be something that would make the foundation desperate enough to make a pact with the chaos insurgency
hey the rubber how do you become a like that
Continuation?
Unless the creators of 2399 have faster than light communication, the repair messages wouldn’t have stopped after the barrier array was established for another 6 million years; 3 for them to see we were blocking communication and another 3 for the new command to arrive
Thank you Jupiter
I wanna go to Jupiter now
I don't want die that early 😭
If an advanced civilization can control thier own native galaxy sources of energy  then why it target earth for?
Excuse is this real cus I don't want die at the  age of 35 😭😫
The sound effects used in this video are so annoying
Jupiter is a real one
Is there an ryuk scp
Is there an ryuk scp
what if we gather all the scp-001s and the other powerful scps the day it comes and watch them kill each other
(SCP + 990) 990 + 9 = SCP 999
Sorry the rubber ive unsubsrbie b/c of this sh8
Why don't we just : First, throw the Jupiter's moon, Io, to that thing, Second, search the remaining pieces of that thing first, and destroy it so they couldn't find it and won't finish the repairment of that thing
yay my fanart, is beautiful
I'm actually starting to believe this
Mira HQ is that you?? :>
why dont they just throw Jupiter's moon at it
I Guess 2399 is a XK Class "End of the World Senario" thing..?
I have online class but i turn of my mic and listen to this pls don't tell anyone.
Really need to do one on dr bright and scp 999
I know a way to destroy that scp call out 343 and tell him evreyting he might agree *343: FBI open up :/*
You do also know that jupiter protects earth from falling asteroids with it's humongous orbit
Alien scp drone: we finally arrived Earth.  Scientist: We better need plan b for sure.  Me: Time machine for the win.  Other guy: that's cheating  Me: and how?  Other guy: sacrifice your own present and your own time line. Likely yourself get snap out present self.  Me: I keep them alive and I will keep trying until our civilization won the fight.  Me : had no choice and this is how time changes and rules to pay.  Other guy: you be a great sacrifice to save human civilization.  Me: it's time to shared info in the past. if we lose the fight and we failed to protect earth.  Me: finally used time machine. And travel in the past with alots of information and best plan against this alien scp.  Me: gave to a scientist with a brief case of knowledge in the future and I little note of my own message in this info.  Scientist: why you started to dust? Looks like a thanos snap side effect. Me: I came in the future and I travel in the past to shared information.  Me: take this with you and go to your other friend scientist and try to convince them about this info. You my only one  chance to undo something and try save us all.hope you can change this world a better place. Me: completely dusted away in the past.  Scientist: I can do this  Scientist: I need few things to remember Scientist: in Hale Scientist: ex Hale Scientist: immediately go to his friends. Scientist: (told all information in the future.)  ( SCP foundation on high alert ) Thanks for likes in the comments.
4:51 nice among us reference.
I wanna know the 169
10 reasons we should move too mars
I tried to send my fan art but before I could do anything my master rice was destroyed after someone spilled rice at it
Tite ka
I'm really scared now BC of the scp destroying the world
"this technology does not yet exist" says the group that literally can send entire spaceships into alternate galaxys to discover the true nature of reality... really doesnt add up at all
When you are broken, but wanted to break other people
I wanna know how he knows all of this. what if he was one of the 05 council?
But they have scp-343 in the facility
Will there ever be a video where a person doesn’t fucken die
Please do SCP-999! You have mentioned and drawn it so many times it needs a video of its own!!! Please I beg of chu!!!!!
Among us ejection : 4:52 - 4:53
4:50 AMONG US
What if they just sent 682 at it?
Wait a minute. If the SPC scientist can decode the transmissions being sent to it, same why don’t they try to send a false transmission commanding it to shut down? Or self-destruct?
EMPs do exist though wdym? How big would the EMP have to be? Because a blast, no matter how tiny, affects technology within its blast radius
So your the thing my parents talk about when something broke
If they dont destroy that thing then they should send scp 001 or just all of them.
4:51 Therubber was not the impostor
And then a man threw a moon to it then it died
I’m happy this is fake! or is it...
Bruh just tell the witch child to destroy it cause she can do anything
Did rubber just make an among us reference? I think that it is just a reference of when someone gets ejected imposter or a crewmate
It's been 29 year since 1991 when this was based do you think they killed it with the god weapons and asking had himself?
Might as well eat chips Then wait for 25 years until we die
Therubber: *Uploads a new video  me: I am speed
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
this scp is every where on youtube  like volgun and others
Imagine this happened scp 2399: finished repairing *starts moving* *Hits another one of Jupiter's moon* *Falls again* Scp 2399: bruh
who caught the among us reference 4:52
Bro, put all canons and guns in the upgrading mashine thing ( i dont remember) if it fits
Heyyyy this was before and his a tiktok er I see his tiktoks
Imagine living at Jupiter..
Interesting how the first -- and most prominent -- idea to deal with the machine was to attack and attempt to destroy it, and then, when that failed, to delay it's repair. What I gather from this is that it's acting in self-defense...although, many things will switch from offense to defense after taking damage...I know I do, in games. In any case, I'd be more curious how the machine or one of it's drones would react to an unclaimed part being returned to them by a human...or, perhaps, used as bait to capture drones that stray too far from the machine.
Scp-2399: I'm gonna destroy the Earth Jupiter: No u
4:47 the rubber was not the impostor
I wanna c u guys make up ur own scp. that would be very interesting, to me atleast
Scp 2399 Looks like iron man's last suit
Reality ending SCPS: contained Alien thing on a rock: Holy fuck! what are we gonna do!?
Dr.Bright : am i a joke to you
“.. In 25 years,”  Me who would be 37: 😳
Ask god for help duh
What if u used 2845 in a way where it could only see 2399 would that work? Or if it wouldn’t why would it fail?
every time I watch rubbers videos I keep memorizing the words what he said in online class well I don't memorize anything
Scp 6789 known as sirenhead
Do SCP 001
4:51 record among us reference
What if they used a reality anchor
4.51 Rubber was not the impostor
Zhask
Astrologists: “we found the existence of Phosphene gas on Venus, finally a sign of alien life and this close to earth as well!”  SCP Foundation: *laughs in SCP-2399 existing*
I dare you guys to open caption! 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
What if when it gets to earth instead of destroying us all it instead gives every single human a lollipop
Looks like a pokemon to me
I knew it teachers were lying
4:51 was that among us?
Its january 28 2021 SCP 2399 didnt destroy the earth yet
Wow #34 on trending!
Love the among us reference
They should ask god to try or talk or destroy him
jupiter: experiences doomsday also jupiter: tis but a scratch
I suggest that they should take a piece of 2399s debris and study it
im scared
That looks like the gorger for galactus drones from Fortnite tbh
heh
The foundation can't destroy it but can they hack into its system and make it non-hostile like put a chip into it so they can like hack it i know thats very hard but they can try the foundation is not focusing on how it inside is we know that the Throne come out of it so why don't we make a Drone and put with chip into your system and try to hack into it the foundation might just have time to make a complex chip or hack into it some how right?
...
I think the rubber is an scp scientist
*NASA is typing...*
ayy trending now
DOES THAT MEANS ALIENS ARE REAL
US:O NO SCP-2399:I NEAR DONE SCP FOUNDATION:WE WILL USE GODLY POWERS TO DESTROY U
The scp universe has like a 100 scp's that can end the world LMAO.
whos scp 26?
Oh no just 25 years he will be repaired
Congratulations on trending!
Why dont they just sent a message to them to destroy other planet They just edit and translate so there is no sus
I am glad that the scp foundation and all scps are not real, cuz if they was real we will oof
4:53 TheRubber was not an imposter
Im glad this isnt real i hope
Lego has gone to far
OMG. Here we go The Rubber UPLOAD AGAIN BRO!
Could you use SCP 2700 to destroy it?
4:52 ayyy the among us ejection sound!  thislooks amazing!
Alright, does anyone here take Chemistry? If so what does Sulfur Dioxide do?
so that was the SCP that destroyed the whole Philippine's in 2037        don't ask me but the guy that has a future toy said this to me -_-
So something that is virtually indestructible somehow got damaged while... texting and driving I guess? Guess it affects everyone, even hyper advanced AI..
Alien confirmed
get in the line..  we already have devourer of the world, hateful stars, scarlet king, and many more eagerly want to destroy earth. We must be do something awful  that so many powerful being want us suffer, and have a lots of lots of luck it didnt happen yet.
Hmm...scp 999?..I'm really interested on it and i want to know more about it..plua there's so much interesting scp but I'm really interest on scp 999 OwO
Would be nice if you finally make a video for SCP 999. I want to see how you will narrate his lore.
We're just going to ignore how Rubber pronounces Io as I.O.?
Just please to nasa to keep the laser in 2399
Could you just send scp 173 to snap it?
we have 24 years left to be destroyed
Simple Solution: Just throw it to black hole and boom gone No problems
Love you 💟💟
ive always wondered why this one is considered an SCP, yes its aliens but not as strange as some of the other stuff they have. its more grounded in reality theoretically speaking
Among us sign: bjb was sub.
Rubber Was Not The Impostor
So, if it is about 59% built and operational, and it stays at the average of doing 0.78% a year, it would take roughly 52.60 years(or a little over 52 1/2 years) for it to be %100 complete.
Regipscyhe be like
ALIENS!!!!!
uhhhhhhhh
School: The Great Red Spot is caused by storms that lasts for millions of years Me: Just look at TheRubber.
Wonder what the second message says; I can't recall if it says in the original entry
Jupiter always protecting us from meteors and scps
Bro you're scaring the hell out of me when you said you only have 25 years left until it tries to kill us all I am truly horrified 😰
Ayyy number 35 on trending congrats
Bruh instead of attacking the scp 2399 can't you  just make a defence in the earth like the scp 2399 barrier
Maybe 2399 was sent to destroy numerous indestructible scps known to mankind
Ah, so this is where they got the inspiration for Samus’ armor.
Could the solution to destroying Scp-2399 be dropping one of Jupiter’s moons onto it
I just wanted to ask IS THE SCP FOUNDATION REAL
USE ＳＣＰ-343 OR 239
Imagine in the future there is a talking book that can tell us story we want
At least it's not real.       *or is it*
Incorrect link to 2399
I HEARD AMONG US
Have they tried throwing 682 at it yet?
5:56 is look like warden mob
if you can trandslate their messages, then just write them a offer of peace, for goodness sake
4:53 WHEN THE RUBBER IS SUS!
Omg an among us reference
gyutiyh6i7uyyu6 hr
2046? is the scp universe dooms day?
...why not use scp 001 the children against it
Can we all just appreciate how a writer was able to take a natural phenomenon that happens on Jupiter and turn into a probable explanation through an SCP?
Why can’t make clones of the little bots,so the spaceship can think it’s real,then in the forcefield,Destroy the ship
He is cool
ITS OK ITS JUST ORYX'S PACE MAKER
4:51 the rubber was ejected
scp-2399: "indestructible" scp-343: I dont think so
wow
That would be a cool fight
I just realized you know Scarlet King is a God well what if we. put him against the GateKeeper he's.a God
Basicamente jupiter é deus
How can the alien creators find an interception of their own radio LIGHT signals from 90 million LIGHT years away, in a few decades?
Why don't you just bomb it
Just throw a whole planet at it
4:50 DID I JUST HEAR AN AMONG US SOUND EFFECT
This foundation also searching monsters from another galaxy?
Who would win  Earth alliance vs 2399 tailed beast
Scp 2399: Follow me and i shall show you my secret plan *throws sand at eyes* HAHA SAND IN THE EYES
All of SCP Foundation: This is a ticking time bomb, so we have to act fast! So, our plan, Project LEGIONNAIRE, must be executed. We must create a powerful EMP powered by a yet unknown power source, along with a volley of nukes. Time is of the essence! Dr. Bright: *just, uh, (burp) throw a moon at it I guess*
Pls Explain Scp 001 The Gate Guardian PLS I BEG YOU
Jupiter has no surface, only an  iron core at the very center.
Isn’t it classed as higher then keter? Because it can destroy a planet?
We need part 2
Who just randomly saw in the recommended and watch him for fun and now you're into it
Huh scp-2317 look diffirence from scp-4217 show scp-2399
is this real?
lol i wonder what he looks like but im kiding about scp 001
Just draw IO into Jupiter's grav pull and have it collide on top of it ez life
try 001 to destroy scp 2399
What if SCP’s are real and they’re just covered by these stories
Everybody gangsta till SCP-2399 gets destroyed by Dr. Bright with one of Jupiters moon.
Is it just me or does SCP-2399 remind anyone of the Ultra Beast Celesteela from Pokemon?
If elon musk said "hmmm i have colonised mars i guess next is jupiter but first i need to nuke it" SCP foundation "ahh shit here we go again"
Question? If we can decode the messages couldn't we send our own self destruct messages
idea : make a tiny bot and let it sneakyly get in or make an  exact copy of it as a disguise
Can you pls make  a rubber spc just like u Plssss
Cool
Hello fellow scholar
SCP - 4000 PART 2 PLEASE
i think legionare was another scp named last man alive
We are now smarter then our parents and teachers
scp 2399 is not targeting earth its targeting the broken god
hypotethically speaking, if this was an automated thing, why dont just recreate the message from the creator that would say "Self Destruct" rather than try destroying it from earth, i mean the foundation already have a way to translate/decode the message from the creator. so they must be atleast can to make a reply message in same "Signal", but send it to the machine instead of the sender.
You look cute with that astornut suit
thanks jupiter
You don’t need a big enough bomb just somehow push Jupiter into the sun simple enough
Is it true if it is true we are gone
Phew good thing the scpf is fake-
Why does this thing have connection to SCP-4217?  I think it doesn't come to destroy Earth It seems like SCP-2399 was hunting SCP-4217 after all Like 4217 was a refugees
Me : just put a tazer in 914 and put it in very fine twice and it should be powerful enough to kill break even atoms not enough power? just  put a battery and do the same thing
Meanwhile scp-2399: We just want to visit human why wanna destroy us ;-;
do some research first, Jupiter has no ground
35 on trending!
SCP 3017 next please Mr Rubber!
Can you do a video on dr bright
I mean.. its 2021 Thats more then 25 years right?
Can  we appreciate that the SCP Foundation is sacrificing many Many lives for humanity? Like to doo so
I think the scp-2999 will occur world war 3
YES I've been waiting like a week for the next exp video
I always wondered if 2399 was actually sent to protect Earth from something bigger
What cind of scp is this it just like ass alien
Is the rubber technically an scp who works with the scp foundation? He's clearly not human by his appearance
If there was no scp foundation imagine all the scps would do they will end da world  World:KABLOOMMMMM!!!!!!!!
Rubber : killer robot on jupiter made by aliens conspiracy theorists : don't mind if I do
Basically Zygarde but in real life
I like this scp, but Jupiter is a gas giant, it has no solid surface
My favorite scp!
Show scp 095s foto and help him  go to it
Get all the nukes on the world and nuke Jupiter’s big red spot immediately
Why not use scp 914 to upgrade are arsenal to destroy it?
Jupiter: whos stupid now !?!
Jupiter and IO are the real MVP's here, IO knocking out 2399 then Jupiter pulling it to its atmosphere.
Can you do a Video on Scp 087 or scp 001 when Day Breaks please
Why not steal a chance of the debris that separated from the scp? It would slow down the repair process.
You just placed a surface on jupiter. The surface was supposed to be deep in the atmosphere of jupiter. And i also saw europa.
"You must construct additional pylon"
What if it doesn't want to kill us though? What if we're just making it want to kill us because we are hindering it from something else that doesn't involve us at all?
i like to listen to this while playing games that dont use sound
he finally made a vid about this one!
Halo irl
Imagine if this stuff was real (I saw it on the scp site it’s just a community of writers)
This was on my explore page and I’m interested but have no idea what i just stumbled upon
can you do SCP-6789 sirenhead
What about scp 4666? A past friend was trying to look up scp 466, and found that terrifying creature instead.
Why don't they just get the God scp to destroy it
Impossible to contain(only able to be kept under surveillance, it could destroy all the BARRIERS if it wanted to), can destroy Earth(and therefore all of humanity), the perfect Apollyon class SCP
Damn we r going to die
Dang
So 2399 is the reason why the Red Spot exists.
1806 angel number alignment synchronicity sign
0:52 something that withers do on the dirt
Is this true
Make an scp 239 video
Your right about that
Scp-001 please
How about a disruptive large lazer
Yoo #35 trending??
What would happen if they sent a dangerous scp to scp 2399
Throw an emp into super fine on the machine thing
Scp 23
He is swimming in space...
Send in SCP 682
Why dont they just weaponized the lighter .
why is no one talking about the among us reference
If these scps are classified then why are you talking about them? (Just saying,still I love them)
SCP 2399: [All System Repaired] SCP Foundation: oh no what we gonna do My trick be like: Use big driller that carry big nuke to drill jupiter from down to the base
Why dont they make scp 682 fight him?
Their have WhatsApp messenger? because maybe sometime their want make war alert
That is so amazing
Why dont SCP Foundation Use SCP-093 to send this thing a complete new world so it would not attack earth
Why not give scp ya know shy guy or the not can't die
Keter keter one keter
Didnt we use this thing to fuck up the Boken God?
*The Rubber Was not The Impostor*
2:25 ngl those satelittes look like the millenium falcon
Aight guy, hear me out. How about, a combine SCP?
The Foundation: how are we gonna beat it?  Dr. Bright: y’all ever play Majora’s Mask
I've subscribed when The Rubber was at 280K now he's at 1 .25 million
I wonder if they can use the light scp that eats up all light like a black hole, sent over by 343, could destroy it or vice versa
I forgot how dr.Bright "Somehow" lunched a moon to Jupiter and Destroyed it
Please the next scp is scp-999
Face reveal
I really dont mind how jupiter has solid surface
Something I've always wondered about possible XK-class-causing entities: The Children (I believe known as SCP-001) destroyed a cult of reality benders. Why not unbury them and use them to destroy things like SCP-682, the Destroyer of Worlds, and SCP-2399?
Find out scp 636 and make a video pleaee
well we can just call gordon freeman to take care of it just like how he defeated the entire xen invasion
scary
When your recommendations are faster than your bell notifications
We send "god"  to deal with it
It give us time before we are doom
Can't they use SCP-662 'butler's handbell'
Let's hope that MARS get in the way
Are you an scp trainee or something?
I still can't help laughing at the fact that this supposedly indestructible thing got incapacitated by a psychopath named Dr. Bright by launching one of Jupiter's moons at it like a damn mad lad.
8:30 8:35 for some reason I laughed at that part
Can i request? Can you talk about Scp-3700??
Any plans on animating the battle between this scp and the clockwork God?
Use another SCP to destroy it
Scp 2399: yea im gonna give you 25 year 25 year later (2021) Me after watching this : goodbye world i will not. Miss you
When day breaks?
I don't think "malfunctioning destroyer" isn't up to destruction, but something like reclaiming their sites since we are mostly not the original inhabitants of this planet
I wonder when the rubber will have condom merchandise 😂
Who watches TheRubber daily
This is almost exactly the same as one other vid he’s made
if that thing isdamage by jupiter's moon io.... why not gather materials from that moon and damage it more and more?
use nukes
Can you do Scp 3562
Lot of people saying that scp 2399  is watching us
Dr. Bright takes dodgeball to another level
4:50 among us reference
Hear that elon musk were waiting for you to get us to mars the time is ticking
Maybe the dark Knight in the space could be part of scp 2399's pieces of its body
I do have a plan to End this scp Instal big thrusters in the other side of the planeta and hurl It into the sun
4:51 it sounded like among us
Wjo else is listening tk this while online classing...noone? Only me ok
I know a civilization thay can help  They are the Biringans from the hidden city of Biringan. They are extradimensional beings that possess extraordinary technology. But the foundation have to tread cautiously because these beings are rumored to be obssessed with human abductions. They might want to have D class personnel as payment for their help.
Let’s see how that ship vs scp - 682
His arm looks like a dick
Scp foundation need help from other good scp's to help them
use S.C.P 001 To Destroy S.C.P-2399. I Think 🤔
You know how to destroy that thing?           Hire Truck-kun.
finally,it was created.
Why dont you just stick a bomb in the repair drone
Please do SCP-914 some time. It’s basically a machine that “refines” any object placed into it depending on the setting. This includes biological organisms although further testing is prohibited without permission from 05-command. Given the versatility of this scp there are multiple pages of experiments with it as well as a few tales. This would give you lots of freedom with what to cover about it with the potential for multiple episodes. It’s definitely one of my favorites, and this channel is my favorite scp animation channel so I’d love to see a video on it.
Who else got the among us reference
I know this is made up but dam if this is real and may happen idk man but we screwed
Welp, time to throw Jupiter either into outer space to buy more time or into the sun, or close star
Why not ask SCP 343?
Wait if in years ago
Is this real
Pls make scp 999 because he is so cute
Then Evacuation With Spacecraft Faster Than Light Was Used To Evacuate Earth To Proxima B Before 2399 Destroy The Planet
Is there part 2?
I have an idea to destroy it launch 10000
This year is going to be the year of SCP-2399's completion      *F U C K*
4:50 TheRubber was not an impostor
scp ppl: this is a secret scp this is not allowed in the public the rubber: *post on youtube* scp ppl: *i n h a l e*
Is it a space ship?
Wow u know a lot of SCP
Jupiter has no solid surface

Evil robot boi:let me out or I destroy you Jupiter who has been bullied by stronger meteor and asteriod:B E T
War of the Worlds, anyone?
NASA watching this video:"Intense weezeing"
Scp 23999 vs scp GOD
A
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
What SCP who created by human
so SCP is just mech battles now? mmmkay.
Just destroy the pieces
I love the art and animation
Call god
Hello I want to ask you this are scp true cuz I watch everytime in your channel about it if this is true I would be freaking out.
Are we gonna die!😨
u forgot the last part, a person in a spaceship sent a tungsten idont know wut missile and destroyed the scp, then humans asked who he is and he screamed at him and said, "u should have picked me up last week" he appeared to be from the future
Plss explain scp 008
"Thats why the scp foundation keep this knowladge a secret at all costs"  The Rubber: am i a joke to you?
Yo @TheRubber FYI Keter is pronounced like letter or wetter. At least that's how all the other SPC channels I've watched say it (such as TheVolgun).
The way that "EMP" for project legionnaire is a dyson swarm it takes about a decade to complete
why don't they send in 682
What happens if it does kill us all
Is there gonna be a part 2 ?
4:50 TheRubber was ejected.
MY FAV SCP IS INTERVIEWED!
ur animation is great too than the others plus ur narrating voice is best
What if they destroy Jupeter then he wont be abel to recover
Please make a video about scp 3700
throw scp 682 in there for termination to test if this thing can stop everything
I O is pronounced I O not I O. So next time you say I O u will be able to pronounce I O I O Not I O  the rite way . I Am utubes pronunciation monitor so no hard feelings, juuuusst doing mah job luv the vids
If we fire a neutron bomb with the payload of 1 cubic meters of neutron star matter, or 21,182,593,819,676,400 megatons of TNT at 2399 then it would turn Jupiter into a star for 14.5 hours. If 2399 destroys bomb the payload would prematurely detonated the bomb, causing it everything in 500,000 mile radius to be destroyed on the atomic level, and since neutrons have no magnetic field 2399's defenses would have no effect, and 2399 would be erased from existence.
I think it’s going to be more easier if the foundation ask help from SCP-343 to destroy this
Wait i thought this was real until I remembered this was fiction
WHY NOT JUST FIRE THE BFG 10000 INTO THE malfunctioning Destroyer
We may not have nearly the advanced weapons of this thing, but stick a nuke in scp 914 on “very fine” and suddenly we will. It can turn a pistol into a stupidly overpowered energy weapon, so something already a super weapon would probably do the trick.
There a lot of ways destroyed that thing little they know if they use 1 % of there brains they have strongest they have that lock up in in the scp foundation
“1963”  dude the world was still at war with germany dude
Imagine once it gets out of jupiter it accidentally hits another planet and breaks apart again
I say we get  one of the most powerful and Allie to the human race to destroy it or make contact
jupiter is a gas giant meaning there is no ground only gas but i don't wana be that guy
Wait why don't we use god SCP 343
PART 2 PLSSS
So basicly an angel?
Why wont they just let it fix its self AND LET IT GO SHEW AND AWAY FROM OUR GALAXY! Or just Move It to the other planet away from earth THESE SCP DICK HEADS ARE STUPID
Check the malo in internet its real unavalable
Doctor bright stares at the moon  Me: can’t you just use the moon as the weapon? just yeat it to them
Imagine for a moment if SCP-2399 was not a "destroyer" class or weapon, but was in fact, discovered to be a scouting unit.  Hoo boy!
Where is thanos when we need him the most
Imagine if we throw a water on it XD
i think this is the origin of uranus (a character in mobile legends)
Couldn’t they find some of the pieces of the SCP and keep it away eight from completion
The problem is that Jupiter has no solid surface so that SCB is floating on clouds in the dark
You idiots
You will destroy the Souler system!
call scp-343 to help to terminate the scp
Thank you for this But please do SCP 4000 part 2
Mr rubber can you do scp 2774, i still dont get why he's a keter
just launch 682 at it, that might work
I'm scared is this real I'm actually scared
Me realizing all the stuff I learned in school of Mars was fake: it was all fake? The rubber telling me: it always was
Hey I like the among us
I say throw 682 at it
i guess that how alien sighthings are made i think..
I WANT SCP-001
I feel like you should also do videos where you explain the member of the foundation. . . . For example: Dr, Gears Mtf Tau-5 Samsara Dr, Clef Researcher Talloran Dr. Gerald O5 Command Dossier Dr. Glassman Adrian Andrews Dr. Kondraki Barker Sullivan Dr. Bright Calvin Lucien Marion Wheeler Monica Pinkston Regina Alexis Watts Robert Bumaro
OMG
:)
Dr bright
im gonna comment  Smiley Face :) on every rubber'S  videos and every youtubers videos so find me :)
What about SCP 001 proposal the children What about almost a 1000 scp’s Good vid though
I want to join the channel but i cant use my money cause im saving >~<
maybe we need a magicannon/magic cannon or a Blazing meteor or star
What is your name oh my SC on SCP but I know one level of caulking search up search that up
I say lets make a deal with that devil I mean by make a deal with scp-682 if it kills scp-2399 and if it does well give it Free rain on Jupiter.
I love how you did that among us vote off inpostor XD
If only they had a literal god on their side
When you hear and argument in the kitchen then theres your name while you are in the middle of the game   :  2:51
scp 610 is more scaryer then scp 2399
I think SCP-2956, the living submarine, would make a good video; it's a little sad, it involves conspiracies, and has some (as far as I know) uncontained SCPs.
The destroyer of earths enemies maybe?
Elon musk after 20 years: Welp here it comes imma just take an uber to mars.
Jupiter "unknowingly" 09:19...highly unlikely...Jupiter and Saturn were very much placed in their positions for the protection their gravity fields affords us humans, just as SCP studies anomalies, how do we know that we are not an anomaly being studied, just as a scientist would study a virus in a petri dish, us humans are the virus in our very own solar Petri dish...the only difference being we are much more dangerous and volatile than most viruses...wow its fun to fantasize #lovethischannel
just drop a photo of 096, then yeet 096 to jupiter orbit  case closed, no need to thank me
The emp and nuke plan could actually work as the powerful emp can be powered by scp 938, which could possibly have enough voltage, then the nukes can possibly be upgraded by scp 914 which might just destroy this thing Edit:to answer some of your “what ifs”, scp 938 can possibly be convinced to cooperate, if he does not have enough voltage, he could also be put into scp 914 to become more powerful, if the nukes don’t fit, other bombs with the correct size can be used after being upgraded as the 914 upgrade is quite substantial, the emp will make it vulnerable as it is based on the malfunctioning of energy based tech, to launch the emp, again, 914 with the freaking blessings
Just push a moon in to it using the nukes you have
but that story was scary
"Therubber was not an impostor"
im on lass
Now the scp (idk what) god have better chance save us 😂
im using my moms computer and i serched what happed when scp 2399 was fond and i whent to the scp foundation
Theory: SCP-2399 is (was) actually just a trading post and the REAL big boys were sent in because hostiles attacked a peaceful tower.
Use SCP-001 The children - ouroboros cycle😂
Could you please do scp1903

THROW 682 AT IT!!!!!!!!
4:51 : TheRubber Was ejected    TheRubber was an Impostor Defeat for impostors
6:00 wait. DID THERUBBER BLINK AND JUST DESTROY THE EARTH!???????!!!!
Would like to see SCP-179.  I think she would save us from SCP-2399.
Please theres a part 2 in this video.
If y'all keep fire thing at scp-2399 and if y'all keep intercepting the messages y'all going to make it mad and I think we can encrypt the messages and I think I know where that's coming from
Is all of this true that the earth will be destroyed in 24 years
what if galactus crush 2399
Yo isn’t Jupiter made of entirely of gas
My dad is born in 1974
Name of intro song pls pls
Maybe 2399 was sent by aliens to earth to destroy it due to it's high amount of anomalous properties
Io = Ayoh Io ≠ Eye Oh
theory: this is the great barrier. this first alien civilization had made this thing to make themselves the one and only intelligent civilization. and they had sent this thing to other planets with civilizations, wiping them out by just being there. and we did just get super lucky. this would explain why we don't see any other advanced civilizations.
indestructible
Omg my wish came true Thnx rubber
We have give a chance to us
Matthew 5:2-48 [2]And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, [3]Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. [4]Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. [5]Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. [6]Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled. [7]Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. [8]Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. [9]Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. [10]Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. [11]Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. [12]Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. [13]Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. [14]Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. [15]Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. [16]Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. [17]Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. [18]For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. [19]Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. [20]For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. [21]Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: [22]But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. [23]Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; [24]Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. [25]Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. [26]Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. [27]Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: [28]But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. [29]And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. [30]And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. [31]It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: [32]But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. [33]Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: [34]But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: [35]Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. [36]Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. [37]But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. [38]Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: [39]But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. [40]And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. [41]And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. [42]Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. [43]Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. [44]But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; [45]That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. [46]For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? [47]And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? [48]Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.,,
did they considered blowing up jupiter? for me, there must be a way shutting off 2399's shield followed by a lots of nukes and a drill to jupiters core

Ah, yes, 2399 fell victim to the same unstoppable super-weapon as the dinosaurs, a big rock.  Seriously, for all the horrifying things in the SCP universe, it's worth remembering that all it took to wipe out life that had been dominant on Earth for *billions* of years was a fucking *rock* less than a *thousandth* its size. And it's only by sheer luck that humanity hasn't been wiped out in a similar manner.
Hooray!!! This is one of my top fave SCPs!! Such a great story that’s so easy to believe. Kudos for being the first animated series to cover this scp!
Scp 166 next
Can you do a video on 4666?
imagine someone made the rubber an scp, scp-6000 or something like that
My favorite SCP is scp-953
Could you talk about acp 1875
Didnt they also use SCP-2399 against the machine god when it was on a rampage?
dont you hate it when you رفنقصنينقمثمثتبقه
what about use some of the scps
9:52 you have angered the earthbound community by mispronouncing giygas its pronunce gieyge-ass
Why not steal the remaining parts of that machine, then? Without them, it won't repair itself, so crisis won't happen. Ta-daaa!
So that's what actually makes that red spot.  A Youtuber tells you more than the discovery channel.
"Dr. Bright just launched Jupiter's moon IO at Scp-2399 reclassified to neutralized"
This is much more better science
I wish Rubber is my teacher😀
:the rubber: this is to be kept a secret Also the rubber: make an vid about it and posts it on yt
imagine if water works they will have to waste a lot of resource

I was actually wanting you to talk about scp-2399
1:06 Potato!
...why is the scp foundation secret? but yotubers are telling about some scp's hahaha
I hope some SCPs can fix things Just so that you can fit my James  engine that I have with me
black holes:are you sure its indestructable
if scps were real i would be dead by now
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Rezznov: i will have my revenge
*"Indestructible"* Dr.Bright: *Holds Nokia 3310 and looks at Jupiter's moon... 🌚 🌝
Good Guy Jupiter! Protecting the Earth because he wants to mate with some human women.
You should look at SCP-times up
Europa!?
Just making a freaking big railgun that lunches nukes to space
"2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. (Matthew 3:2 King James Version)" It can't be much longer. After all we've seen and heard, the time must be near. Repent ye! For the kingdom of Heaven is at hand!
Scp 082
In reality Jupiter is actually believed to shield us from asteroids, at least to a degree. But in scp lore, knowing scp lore, that's probably because it wants to eat us itself.
Actually, the Jupiter is a gas planet.
SCP-999 PLS
its better than anything in the universe also im ur biggest fan can u also pls give me a shout out im also a youtuber
Aliens are real!!!
Scp 2399:FULLY FUNTIONAL Dr Bright: I have several objections
Been waiting for a 2399 video. Love this SCP
Me hoping that I will see a new video by the rubber... and then I saw it.
Its literally inly about the missels see how the drowns get if they lanced a missle that disguises itself it will able to get truoght the scps energy shield
They shouldve explored other moons to find the aliens scrap and steal it so that the aliens cant actual finish it
And that earth will be destroyed
That's good to know
True true but it tells us we are gonna die
Use the gate guardian
When you make a video of SCP 999
simpple. just launch a few dozen thermonuclear warheads at
SCP-999 PLS
Just Kill  The drones First and It cant Repair
I wonder if the gate keeper would destroy this
Part two
How long did the dooms day timer past Cuz it might be why everything is going to a disaster
SCP foundation: 2399 poses a threat to our civilization 2399: neutralizes scp-001 Apotheosis, effectively saving civilization  Me: So what's the truth?
What if this was real and as were speaking aliens are heading towards us
I’m sad the new commands to the destroyer wasn’t mentioned. Halt all repairs, continue to target.
Me:Uhhh ok  Also me: Jupiter is made of gas
Aw the repair drones look cute >w<
Scp -966 aka the creature that can only be seen using night vision
Is this real 😰😱😱

So, that's the thing the boat squid saw eh?  The one image it flashed to the destroyers around the area it's surfaced in??
Ugh those idiots I can't believe did it they launched their Dreadnought in their mistaken belief that destroying earth will prevent their doomsday prophecy in fact it'll only hasten the dissolution of this iteration even worse they've turned it into a Focal Nexus a literal fixed point in time not even Temporal or Dimensional weaponry can affect it not even Quantum Phase infiltration we've lost 3 demolition teams just don't look too closely at the hull in quadrant B-37 it's not pretty 😱

Hey
Yo wait is that the Among us Ejection noise?
This Why I Came To This Channel
I think we can destroy it by using powerful weapons and putting it in SCP 914 and upgrade it and use Very fine then  use the upgraded weapons to attack SCP 2399 :3
Who is SCP 990
the drones are 23399's kids. change my mind
why do remember this, I feel like i watched this before even tho it wasnt released. hmmmmmmm can i somehow look into the future
Wait I have a question if you transmit a similar message to scp2399 asking it to self destruct will it have a chance to work?
This already got so much views
8:08 is that the charging sound effect from Spyro the dragon?
4:49 how tf did it get to the milky way that fast unless it sent it 3 million years ago before humans were a thing
teacher: teaching the class      me: *watching rubber video*
That design look so cool
ffffffaaaaakkkkkeeeeee
4:51 rubber was not the impostor. 1 impostor remains.
POOP GHOST!
Bruh make this so fast im impressed
When is part 2 of taboo
attempt 1 on begging him for scp-457
this guys name is so gay
Love this scp
Wanted: scp-2769 j is a marshmallow with a small human body  with a square head. Any and all humans within 50 feet will become a marshmallow human but still have human properties. They r known as scp 2769 j-2.
scp aren't real
Do scp 4975
what would 2399 be at now in repair? also maybe we should try using an SCP on it? i mean there are passive scps that could improve our stuff
Wait jupiter is a gas giant why did i see rocks in jupiter jupiter is mæd out of gas
What if its not actually trying to get to earth but trying to get something thats on earth
i am now scared of 2050
2399 reminds me of a specific Pokemon
... Hit it with a friggin Planet. If Jupiter has given us a chance and a 'Planet' stopped it, I.E. Io or the Planet IO, then an attempt to hit it with a bigger planet might be more feasible... Which lead's me to ask is there an SCP with the power to move planet's or enough Telekinetic power to move one? Because I don't think something of that magnitude can survive taking a hit from a planet being FLUNG at it, like the CLAW.
Aka the huge bomb
SCP-2399 be like: Dr. Samuel Hayden: no, you can't just shot a hole into the great red spot Jupiter.  Doom Slayer: haha BFG 10k go brrr. *BFG Division intensifies* Tip: BFG 10k more powerful than Nuclear Warhead, it can only make a hole (but not very deep) if you shoot at the planet.
4:51 haha among us reference go brrrrrrrr
4:50 you gotta love the among us reference
Hey why we still can't go to Mars
as  the great tank fish said   Nothing is bullet proof              if you shoot enough                                    -TankFish
Rubber, I absolutely love your interpretation of the Malfunctioning Destroyer. You made it look so damn good!
What if it is nice and trying to come to earth as a piece offering
Im scared..25 years is going to feel like a second 😭😭
I thought Jupiter is a whole gas planet
How about just ask SCP-343 to destroy it
I think we found a new transformers
I think that use a scp to kill it or break it more
First destroy the little bots then take down the shield then we launch the attack
Why don't they take the pieces on the moon
Can you do scp 4975 plz thats my favorite scp.
Why don’t they just shoot the ground below it until it reaches near the center of Jupiter then berry it using the rubble. Put some cameras/motion sensors so monitor it and then it will have to dig through Jupiter to get its parts. And if it does reach full potential you’ll have more time before it reaches earth, even if it’s only a few minutes
Imagine if, when it does get fixed, it flies directly into the Sun Edit: Thank God for Jupiter
I love that we have entire channels dedicated to the SCP universe!
4:51 among us
*Dr Bright flies to Jupiter with a radio transmitter* *Dr Bright transmits 'Just self destruct lol' on the radio*
Yo, could we get the part 2 of SCP-093 ?
Tip:  Make the shield brittle with an Electro Friction Polarity Wave, then smack it with a high caliber weaponry/powerful warhead. EMP is too risky since it may have a chance to absorb it and increase its efficiency.
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
The rubber was not the imposter
My favorite scp
But the moon damaged it so make something stronger
teslas super weapon could power it
I'm sure this one is real to some extent, there are so many scps in this fictional universe that some have to be real to some extent even if just by chance....but something about this one i like so much i wish there really was something in the middle of the red spot...i hope it just not here to destroy us
What if the foundation uses another SCP to counter 2399 such as the indestructible reptile?
SCP-2399? more like celesteela
Finally you answered
Does this sound weird to you? So, Where I live (in Western Australia perth) There was a power outage for an unknown reason and there was no storm or thunder last night for it to happen in the morning
Take all pieces you find and take it as far away as possible and hope it will never reach 100%
For some reason I feel like u can use the 33 second man for some reason
ジョジョ
Why not use crystals and concentrate a power source through the crystal for an overload in power
Hm water? To this trou him
If in the SCP universe, we were able to translate and decode these messages, what's stopping the foundation from sending a self destruct command written in the language native to the alien world
One way to destroy SCP-2399 it would be by creating a machine with SCP-399 Atomic Manipulation Ring.
Can you do Scp 3922 next
What if our drones just find a piece of scp 2399 and bring it to earth and destroy that piece and its repair will not be complete
Just send 682 in there and make him fight him
Imagine foundation personnel in space be like: THIS IS MAYOR TOM TO SITE DIRECTOR!!!
why not recover a few parts to stop it from wiping the earth out
plsssssssss do scp 409
Can u make a time is up (scp4999 or something) I am ur biggest fan
looks like Celesteela
Please! SCP 001 :D
4:51  *TheRubber is Not The Imposter*
i would change what the signal message says for it would destroy it self
Haha among us reference
How can they go through different demissions but can’t go kill an space ship
Why not take broken pieces of 2399 and deliver them to earth cant fix something if the pieces are gone
is it a reaupload?
Anybody else badly wanna see SCP 999
05 : how do we destroy this thing!?   dr bright : send the reptile.
Is scp 4217 live with scp 2399?
Could you talk about SCP-TTKU-J please?
There is gonna be a part 2 of this right rubber
I was honestly waiting for this-
Is this Scp 2399 and SCP 1281 "the harbinger" connected?  Because they sound very similar
i realy realy realy hate your intros... why would i care for spoilers ?
Just throw a moon at it Dr.Bright did it why nor us?
Hm We like dis very good of no doomsday rn
What if this is a police cruiser that is trying to get the scp the war criminals but was damaged during the chase and is now repairing it self so that the police can get hin
Do a Long Horse urban legend please.
how did this thing didn't kill us all in 2020? i mean, its resting since 1997
the one i wanted yay
are you a part of scp foundation
Send a special ops team to find a way inside then detonate a nuclear bomb and blow it up from the inside out
how did you know all this stuff
We need to make announcement of space force is with NASA space force to cooperation with this case because soon we’re going to Mars
make scp 001 next time
Your videos are amazing! If i may ask will one of SCP-187 be made someday?
The Rubber: SCP-2399 is indestructible and nearly impossible to destroy...  Me: S E N D  T H E  L I Z A R D
If this was real, I would say that the scp foundation should just build a czar bomba to see if that would happen.
Me: I think I know this one "That is currently located in Jupiter" Me: KNEW IT
Lol that Among Us Reference 4:50 . Actually if they manage to use SCP - 001 (The Children), they will destroy it in a just a second
I love learning about Scps from the rubber.
An almighty destroyer that came to earth, that can't be destroyed in any ways possible, just got sucked in an by jupiter. Let that sink in.
good new episode
What is SCP-343 god against this thing?
Do scp 117
*im just going to ask how nothing down jupiter is being crushed*
Don't they have stronger scps
Pls do SCP 001
Do scp satan
Congrats on being the trending board !
So instead of doing homework we watch a video about a alien weapon on the jupiter?
Finally my favourite scp
Why not use SCPs to destroy it, like, maybe you could send the butler to go inside and learn about the internals of it  Also, I think it would be funny if we're not even it's target, like maybe it's trying to go fight mercury or it was just passing through our solar system to recharge at our sun
Grand Zeno will destroy it easily without breaking a sweat
Imagine trying to send a machine to Earth, and then have it suddenly crash into a massive gas ball.
so basically unus annus but longer and kills all human race and the earth         viginti quinque annis
Something you never ask A woman: Her age A man: His salary The Rubber: where he gets his info on the SCP Foundation
Lol the among us eject screen
Nope nope nope nope nope
are scps real:/
Why don't the just get a powerful SCP that would cooperate and destroy SCP-2399
I'm still waiting for SCP 999. I'm still depressed without it.
There was a Ad about scp books now I’m intrigued into there ads
Why wasn’t this on news???
Probably NO ONE will see this but if someone does... I have an idea to try and destroy this... thing... get one of the drones, they seem to have infinite power too, and there eye looks like it could fire something...
Oh my God rubber. I remember when you were at 65k subscribers. Now your on trending. Hope you'll remember me when you become even bigger than you are now!
This is great, can you do your next video on SCP-3812
We should take the earth and push it somewhere else
You should do the eco sells man
This is what happens when you forget to charge your phone
7 hours late Yet i didnt get a notfication and im subscribed
Ok why not let them finish there space ship maybe they want to go back home and they attacked us for not letting them finish there work
You cud just code a message to it saying come back XD
So SCP-2399 is kinda like the reapers from mass effect
A M O N G  U S reference spotted!!!
He knows that Jupiter is a gas giant so it doesn’t have ground to walk on
Is the Rubber a researcher and a SCP?
5:57 what’s that scp in the middle
Why not take a peise of the machinery so it cant fully repair
I saw in a log that they failed with all of their plan's with SCP-2399 and it was able to repair all of it's damage's and destroyed Earth and all life on it.
So we have till 2046 till dooms day
Can't we send droned to pick up pieces of the sip also can't we make crypods so we can move to another planet but nothing like AvP I'm not a scp foundation but am am smart enough to be one also it so called can't be destroyed right ok ok what about sneding the scp who hates all am I right guys?
i way i suggest to destroy it is to send a missle at it containing the quartz that turns everything into a quart and launch it at it if it destroys it its airborn particles woul fly around the storm and ventualy land on it and destroy it to the point where it can be deemed neutrilized
fake but still good
Can you continue SCP-093 red sea object please
...what if 2399 was on it‘s way to obliterate Earth to make room for a hyperspatial express rout?
Ya
"it is currently indestructible" Dr. Bright: Finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be *Moon*
TheRubber kind of sus
Can you make a video of scp 999??? :3
isnt this the current thing scp 179 is warning us about before her brother goes mad?
Bro I was in school when I got a notification still love your work keep it up please
thanks
Finally something interesting.
4:51 *The rubber was not the imposter*
The DEADLY red spot
4:51 "Itsnotmebro" was not, The SCP ...
Is this real
Can I stop getting 4 ads (each with 1-2 ads) for 10-15 min long videos. Love your videos btw
Just push Jupiter into the sun
I feel that SCP 2399 is here to kill the broken god
solutions: send the destroyer  to the gate guardian
Wednesday is my favorite day now
Nice. The messaging thing was an obvious trap. 37 million year old messages, good grief.
The scp foundation could ask scp 343 to erase the alien destroyer from existence.
Is the narration a robot or actually his voice
Idk what’s for interesting, the SCP or how detailed his animations are.
yo the next one can it be spc-001 or scp-666
Now this is what I call good contact👌 ALSO SCP-993 PLz
You've got to be kidding me, there isn't an scp that can destroy Scp-2399?
is the big red spot under a moon? cause when it goes up imma be like : the malfunctioning destroyer go e moon go no malfunctioning destroyer go AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
the jamming satellites look like the star trek ship and the millennium falcon
doesnt seem like an SCP, more likely just an extremely advanced tech but nothing super natural.
honestly, instead of containing it and bringing it onto earth, i would just leave it on jupiter
Jupiters not a planet it's made of stuff spinning around it I think
Wait isnt jupiter just a gasplanet ? Like how can he be there living
Why won’t we try make some sort of alliance  with  scp 2399
100000000000000000
DAILY UPLOADS PLEEEEASE
So you sayin we fucked then?
Ops not part3 part2
Nice trending Rubber! Live your content, it’s so cool seeing your animation evolve.
Make part 3
Well, it was damaged by a moon, perhaps we can, I dunno, push a moon into it! Push one of jupiters moons into 2399! If it doesnt work throw more moons lol.
Ye
oh..my god
Are they real
SCP-5031 next please! It's called "yet another murder monster" but is the exact opposite, it's a really wholesome and adorable entry and one of my personal favorites.
"The story of Jupiters moon" i saved earth from ending by getting hit by a Spaceship, the Spaceship "accidentally" hit me i am the main hero -The end- "Created by Jupiter's moon"
Just throw a moon at if a moon damaged it
i think weapons upgraded from scp-914 would do something to that destroyer
we could always send the black hole (SCP - 094) at it nothing is can stop a black hole
Just shoot 682 at it be done with it
Oh S that king VS zilla AD is soo cool
Scp 009
009
Scp drone: well ya know what he said it’s *time to die!*  SCP-2399: I don’t think so!
scp-####, or the Rubber, is an indestructible all knowing being, able to teleport any where at will. The Rubber is not able to be harmed or affected by any other scp, and  is usually friendly. The Rubber is used to scout out other scps, and helps document about them.
Here’s the list of things that MIGHT DESTROY this scp,  Use scp 343 on the thing   That child hive mind thing that disintegrates anything    MAYBE try throwing scp 682 at it, telling the thing that there’s living things inside it (I mean, it might only keep them distracted but it could buy us SOME time)  That was a very short and disappointing list but that’s about something
Hi!i love you sooi much! i hope you put a ❤ to these comment.🥺✌
When you're early but you don't know what to comment
Dum kid:ITS IRON MAN Me:it’s not iron man it’s scp 2399 Dum kid:NO ITS IRON MAN YOU SEE ITS IRON MAN LOOK IT HAS THE SAME COLOR Me:it doesn’t mean that’s it has the same color that means it’s  iron man Dum kid:YOU ARE A BIG MEANIE  Me:you are a dum boy Dum kid:
I LOVE LOVE LOVE YOUR SCP VIDS PLSLSLSLSLS POST MANY THEYRE SO ENTERTAINING LOVE YA MWAH <3
The fortnite Gorgers in a nutshell
just take the parts before they do. Then bring it to the sun or bring it to the scp foundation for testing and eliminating trough the gate guardian
Hey r u going to do a face reveal?
Why they won’t upgrade something like batteries to upgrade machine scp (forgot name), then scp fundation could use it to power emp thing
I always see Humans try this and it ends up failing, Why don't they just try to communicate with the damn thing instead of classifying ourselves as a threat by hurling bombs at it so we are For sure going to be wiped out? If they haven't tried that already
How bout shoot when its moving like because of the barrier will turn off when it flies
Ono
So there's some implications that 4217 is related to this scp. Does anyone know how?
All it would take would be one astronaut in jupiter orbit, a telescope, and those anomalous pliers/power claw thingie that were taken from Marshall Carter & Dark that can crush anything at a distance.
i like how the rubber made jupiter have solid ground when it doesnt
Why don’t they just use scp 343 to destroy it?
Those who had read books written by Cixin Liu are 1000000% sure that this thing was sent to kill us.
Bruh, Jupiter's solid form is smaller than moon... So umm yeah... Thats kinda... Uhh... Nevermind
Let’s not forget that 2399 was terminated by dr.bright, by shooting Io into the destroyer
Aight but can we see one of the almighty burning skeleton man, or maybe one of the quantum computer
Among us
Seems like scp-2399 is just a really big broken spaceship holding lots of life inside
The government is lied to us people rise!!!
Can u do next scp 4666? please I love u soo much
Soooo... 2399 has superior weaponry, superior means for travel and communication, seems to be indestructible... but somehow literally stumbled over a gas giants moon? If it is sentient it must feel sooo awkward :D
We should ask the old castaway if he knows about the tech being used 😂
WE HAVE TO USE THE MOST POWERFUL SORCES OF POWER 1: THOR USING MJNOIR AND STORMBREAKER AT FULL POWER  2: DENKI KAMINARIS QUIRK AT FULL BLAST IT MAY KILL HIM BUT HE'LL BECOME A HERO   3: AND THE ENTIRE PIKACHU POPULATION  by using all this power it should be a big enough burst to EMP that bastard
They try to cover it up then release it imagine if they where real XD
If you don’t know that much about it then why is it Keder and not Euchlid
Send the freaking earth destroyer that russia made
i say throw a toilet paper at it, an infinite toilet paper.
If you combine over 1000 rail guns you could destroy him
"the great red spot"  Ah yes, the floor is made out of floor
Why not just use 50 alpha warheads
Theory: put a nuke through the clockworks to destroy it
Alien spaceship is still real in Jupiter eye is still a scp
would the shy guy get mad if the robot looked at it?
why does it look like a pokemon
Looks likes a character from Metroid
Ah who wanna go to Jupiter to get it?
10:11  We don't care. And it's Io, not I-O you idiot.
That is crazy
We're dead as fck
Me playing with a little drone from dollar tree then SCp foundation flying rocket ships with controllers😂
Why do they dont use 682 i mean either 682 dies or 2399 gets destroyed
why does jupiter have a surface in this video??
If it can get hurt from crashing into a moon why don't we send a moon at it lmfao.
S.C.P-914 "The Clockworks"
Scp-2399 will be launched with an emp energized with the almighty power of God knows what!
Oh so this is where the us military funds are going xD
Aliens: Destroy planet Earth. Jupiter: I think not.
amoung us but there's infinite impostors
Why not just send a virus into the ship that stops it from being able to function properly. So then it has to fix that plus the damage it already has which will give us a longer time to get ready to destroy it?
Did you forget the battle ship part? 2399 is broken battle ship not a staff
why not just ask 343
Lol just get out of america??? XDDDDDDD
if it got damaged by hitting io [if it DID hit it], then hurl an asteroid or a relatively small celestial body at it!
this thing has super precise targeting systems but it couldn't avoid a moon?
ye that thing destroyed the earth
What if the SCP Foundation is real, and they're putting the real info out there for everyone to see because they want us to think it's some joke. When you see a name by who created the SCP, that's someone who's been payed to take credit for it. This would be an elaborate coverup.
Then Bright vibe checks it with a moon
Jupiter has saved earth many times, and now has saves us from an all powerful alien. Hands down the most CHAD planet
What if SCP 2399 is a machine to kill every other SCP in the world that would be able to destroy earth and the planet SCP 2399 came from 🤔
Another great video. But I have one question, why is SCP 2399 look humanoid and not like a space spaceship/station?
Are the Scp foundation even real dude
Scp 001 the gate guardian
Among us reference
Couldn't the SCP foundation just use a barrier unit to take a piece of SCP-2399 that 2399 hasn't found yet?
So when I'm 35 this thing is gonna reconstruct?
what if you tryed to hit it with a peace of SCP-409
Yes
Can't just scp God create a way to kill it?
If you see any pecies then destroy it then desroy more pecies
It's so advanced it plowed into a fucking moon. Great navigators.
crap, 1996? 25 years? 2021? hope lesionare was succesful!!
Scp-001 the gate Guardian I want to see that SCP it is so cool looking and dangerous at the same time
About the giant electrical thing, what if we would be able to send a slightly modified spinning nuke at the scp, but it would have a giant battery in the center which would discharge upon contact AND explode?
And the question is how they know was there ir we try to get a mars
Can't an SCP destroy that SCP?
What about sending a SCP to it and see if it works
Take the parts before they do
are scps real if they are bye ig im gone in 25 years
Wow perfeck video
The foundation has things that LITERALLY alter the fabric of reality. Science and technology shouldn't compare to something that ignores the laws of both.
I love how he's always chilling while talking about most terrifying things
Oh a world ending item Can I help
Song name in background??
Can you do a video of scp-001 "The gate guardian" next?
Maybe a stupid question  But what if you grab one of the drones ore the debris and weld a bom or nuke on to it and the drone goes back to SCP-2399 Or grab the debris away from Jupiter
Why don't thay sead a scp to destroy 2399 maybe 343
Trialled aluminum foil with a heat ray together and make a I think you'll make a very strong on the sheets or melts anything I think but scp-2399 is getting that energy from the Sun or from the robots who's building in finding and protecting scp-2399 lights 100% SCP 2399 will jump and go to the solar system and destroy the human liver even the race to build they don't know yet
Good night all💥
Rubber dude be my science teacher lets learn about SCPS PLS
"SCP 2399 is currently indistructible."  Dr. bright: *laughs in jupiter's moon*
I wish they had this scp in the roblox game
Just ask "God" to do something lol Im sure that SCP being "omnipotent" he could, at least, deactivate it, and maybe bring it to the foundation for study and technology development. The race who send that thing will not stop.
Everytime i see his username all i think is "the condom"
This might terminate scp 2399 use scp 409 on it
As if 2021 couldn't get any worse, apparently 2399 will destroy us this year if by 1996, we had 25 years of delays?
Why don't they make a giant mirror and use another specific SCP?
@therubber  might I suggest the use or the skeleton key or the old man to break through its sheild?
Mabye it will come to help us from further scp attack’s from like the world deavoar.
How about use a railgun or laser can to destroy the scp 2399
This the best one you ever done😸😸😸😸😸😸😸😸😸
Anyone else see celesteela? Lol
Terraria has a functioning mechanical Destroyer.
I can’t be the only one who thought of destiny 2 when he said io and Europa
Is this real?
Jupiter is only a giant ball of gas
some day ill make own scp but it has a scp logo on it
Its simple. Just convince SCP-343 (God) *to slap it out of existence*
How is 2399 able to be on Jupiter when it's a gas planet?
If the thing shoots to destroy the earth thats an attack that would reach the gate guardian right? So the gate guardian would yeet it and the entity that sent it out of existence, right?
What if we just take pieces that have not been found by the lil guys and throw them into space away from jupiter??😂😂
Trinston was here  ..
Dude I’ve Never been so interested in learning in my life
If it got damaged by IO, why not pull a thanos on it and have the moon come crashing down onto it
Make a video on SCP 001 when day breaks please
SCP-2399 sees Io getting closer  SCP-2399: Oh instead of floating around the planet, you approach me again. Io: I can't destroy you if I don't get close. SCP-2399: (laughs) Then by all means get as close as you want.  Io approaches SCP-2399 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ SCP foundation site REDACTED A researcher looking at Dr. Bright draw something similar to JoJo.   Researcher: What they hell are you doing Dr. Bright. Dr. Bright: I'm writing an explanation on how SCP-2399 was destroyed. Researcher: That's nic - Wait WHAT.
Mabe the alien machine was sent here to explore our planet,
SCP Illustrated and TheRubber both have inspired me to write my own SCP, fortunately it is after I've given myself at least 4 years of writing experience to work with.   I know that deep down if I had started early the files or SCP would not turn out very good
The Foundation should be using 914 to help create the weaponry needed to assist in the destruction of 2399.
And really this is getting annoying why does every SCP channel cover the same stuff that other channels have already done? Can you find anything new to do or is the SCP universe that boring?
why arent we using lazer guns on earth yet?
Indestructible? Really? Dr bright throw a moon at it, lunch 682 at it for the lolz, Ask 343 to get rid of it, Somehow get it to attack 001 gate  Guardian, Ask 294 for a substance that can damage it then weaponize result, Get a big mirror use 093 then get it to go into the mirror world, Get it to attack 2845 and watch it puff into Hydrogen, Just a few off top of my head
Oh so zircon was giving god ideas for 2020
Day 1 of asking the rubber to make a video about Scp001
Pop p
scp 096 perhaps
We have a 2399 among us
Jupiter’s moon I.O.? You mean just Io? Sometimes I don’t get your pronunciation of words
Y won't the try a scp to distroy it
How many years do we have left?
Why don’t they get help from other powerful/friendly scps?
Are scps real??
!!!!!!!!!!!😓😓😓
Do a herobrine video
Wait, isn't Jupiter a gas giant?
Yes it does have you heard of a nuke? 4:31
indeed
I have a theory.... I remember scp-4217 trying to communicate to the captain somethin about Jupiter red spot... Do you think that where it came from or trying to warn them of scp-2399
Wow this has cone very erly
just show it a giant picture of 096  and hes going to yeet himself there and destroy it
Poor jupiter The little bug is in Jupiter's red spot
If ya need power might as well just stick a bunch of batteries in that one scp that can upgrade stuff
好，好
start leting fake msg through to it telling it to kill its self and not to ever comeback online
The rubber should make a video about na appolyon class SCP
I did not know this was 4 hours ago
"Viewer dicretion is advised, may depict violence action" - TheRuber Me who's trying to see hard violence in this cartoony'ish style animation
so this wasnt a meteor this was this undefeatable beast.
9:05 your face says uwu
U should do next Scp 024
Did I just get a SCP Artbook ad while watching an SCP video?
so DR. bright never slammed a moon into it?
rubber was the impostor. 4:51
Um so i need protection? From this scp?

Funny the fact that Jupiter isn't even solid and people all over the world think you can land on there and do stuff
This scp should be apollyon lol
Amo estos videos
Ok all that is interesting but…WHAT ARE THE MESSAGES SAYING CAUSE IF I DON’T KNOW IM GINNA SPAZ OUT
Idea: start a cult to seal this thing
If 2399 received damage from IOS impact why don’t the throw IO or something similar at 2399
It looks like Battleship 2 scion battleship/sentry/specimen
The rubber: *introduces the fact there’s a barrier* me: why not go underground and bomb it
Among us Easter egg
How you find all of that information
What if u get 2399 to look at 096's picture and triger him
Rubber was ejected... *2 Impostors remain...*
Is anyone else question how he got this much information from a secret organization of the government?
I love the video rubber hey is this the like part part 2 of the Bismark cuase it shows some thing there
I mean, him crashing on IO damaged him, why not hit him with something like that? Weight and Speed seems to do the trick, while explosions, don't
Finally 2399!!!!
First out of earth scp! I expect content like this in the future. Keep up the good work!
the rubber got ejected
Me: clicks video Ad: so we have some scp books that we want you to read
Uhh almost all possible
among us beep from  being ejected
Is it real?
Scp doesent exist you tofu heads
IO proves that physical damage is possible. So i suggest to Just throw any SCP we can Launch into space at it.
Hey rubber if thats true then why not take the parts it lost and claim them then it can’t repair it self then bing bang 💥 it won’t be able to reconstruct it self
Umm just a idea try to send special rockets to break the shield first or find its source.
Goood job I am new
صح ولا لال
Next do scp 020
:D
اسمك هو لياس
Just wait until TheRubber figures out what Dr. Bright did...
Do a video on SCP-3812.
انا اعرف شو اسمك
The rubber only did 2399 because he wanted to draw Jupiter a bunch of times LOL
It looks like one of iron mans invention.
can you do about scp 4975? "Times up." please? thank you
does anyone know the scp he said was too big, i know SCP-173 and the Gate Guardian (i believe) but not the first one he mentioned
Hello condom man
The author's canon is that Scp 2399 was actually sent to protect us from Scp 001 the broken God
Why not use scp 343
I have a plan make call in speac sos
Sigh, hurl SCP 524, aka Walter the rabbit at the destroyer.
This is the best 1❤
It kinda looks like a celeststeela (a pokemon)
At last! My all-time favorite SCP has been given love by Rubber :D
didn't Dr. bright destroy that scp by using one of Jupiter moons
Just launch 682 into it, 2 problems solved
Just hear me out guys... how bout instead of throwing our nukes at it we just... now just listen ok? We yeet a giant asteroid at it
The Great Red Spot is shrinking in our reality... maybe 2399 is close to repairing itself?
When u realize this is the reason Elon trying to get us to Mars so fast
Is this all real pls respon 😁😁😁
This is basically saying we are going to die
Fun fact in our universe dr bright hit it with a moon
Yaaaay a new one \o/
Wonder if The  Rubber is an SCP himself?
At last
i think they can use something thats already extremly powerfull in the clockworks on great with some luck they might get something strong enough to destroy SCP-2399
Can you do scp 99 next time
Scp 2399 get stuck on Jupiter   Earth:thank you so much Jupiter   Jupiter:No problem👌
What if you use the camera that shows what you want to devise a means of destroying the thing?
can the next scp you do is scp 2521 keter than next scp 000
it literally looks like the lizard beast from voltron.
i dont know if this actually real or
Can you do scp-066 next? Or 999?
Why dont they use SCP-914 to upgrade EMPs and weapons to the point when they would become effective against 2399?
Looks like galactus drones
My question is if this SCP is trying to repair itself why hasn't the foundation use drones to grab the pieces that the scp or its drones have found. you can fully rebuilt if you don't have your part for said rebuilding
can you do the scp 035 story plisss
Just get a giant robot and put all  scp,s on the sun for them to burn burn intil they get covid
if you havent read the 001 proposals, one of them involves a sect of the church of broken god where they make a false versions that consumes everything around it, and its only stopped when 2399 comes down and blast the shit out of it, making a giant valley in baha
I would've built a fake drone and sent it INside dat thing
So thats where prototype 58 went
So basically were doomed
War Of The Worlds, but SCP
Throw gate guardian into it.
I would think if its advanced enough to get here and destroy us it could avoid a freaking moon.... so my theory is something pushed the moon into it...
What if we use the coffee machine scp and type in scp-2399? Would that be a way to damage it? Reverse it's healing? I wonder
maybe the Destroyer was  made  and send to Earth to stop the Scarlet King plan?
This machine was made to cure the Corona virus and save earth
who thinks scps are real?
Schools: Jupiter's red dot is just a mix of gasses   Me an intellectual: scp 2399
God please help
Lul it's not I.O., it's Io, named after the ancestral mother of Heracles.
SCP-2399 🌎🌍🌏
I love your vids and I found a video copying your video about scp847 and literally just used your video but added chinese subtitles
I love how great this scp sounds but how poorly written he is from up close. Nuclear arsenal is useless against it, the technology is to great for us to understand and it possess a nearly infinite speed and energy supply, so much so that when a really advanced drone from the scp foundation fired on it, it reacted at lightning speed and prevented any damage, but it can't avoid and is damaged by a big rock with a monotonous trajectory? Yeah, freezer came to destroy earth but he scratched his feet on a nail and died of infection. yeah bullets and heavy bombs are nothing to him, but the nail was like, real sharp.
It can end the world
please do scp 805
If so ruber if you can do scp 166 it’s a interesting scp and I bet your drawing skills you can do it good luck you will always be remembered for me 👌
Idea. All we have to do, is Majora’s Mask 2399. We drop IO on it and as we’ve seen before, it took damage from the impact. So if we drop IO on it again, this time while it’s stuck on Jupiter, it show be enough to cripple it further, or completely destroy it
This thing remainds me abaut sentients (warframe enemy type)
SCP-2399 is my favorite SCP!
Rubber is the first human to find what's inside the red spot
Scp 662
bruh just throw 682 at it
I have a idea: therubber makes short videos called Scp minis where he make Scp objekts who are Not so dangerous
Don't tell that crazy AI about this SCP, I suspect it's linked with that Bismark Battleship.
For anyone who is wondering, it wasn't stated in the video, but the message heading to SCP-2399 changed to read along the lines of "Cease repairs and head to earth immediately" which is why it's so so so so so important that all communications to it be blocked until it can be deactivated/destroyed
u seriously dont know how to power a giant emp...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             the answer is smack dab in the center of our solar system
I'm so curious to know Whats SCP-2399's relation to SCP-4217
why then are not let some of scp to kill him if are have control  on Scp that can help you out then use the
Just drop scp 173 down there or 096 would be surely worth it i say
If we are able to decide the mesege then let's send a message to 2399  telling it to deactivate its defense systems and well tell it help is coming but that will be a lie so while it has defense down we should use all nukes/missiles/bombs to attack at the same time to destroy 2399 but we need it to not destroy Jupiter
Thisss plsss scp 2256
4:51 among us reference
Intersting that nukes, emps and other manmade weapons of destruction cant even scratch it. But a moon was able to hit it, think about it
I know there's nothing special about it but can you make a video about SCP-999
Kinda reminds me of red alert
Eeeereeeeee
Nobody: Not even a soul: The Rubber: *walking on a gas giant* SCP-2399: *LITERALLY DESTROYED A PART OF A FUCKING GAS GIANT*
Among us
I liked this scp
Everyone: 2020 and 2021 can't get any worse! **SCP-2399 finishes repairing itself** Everyone: Okay, NOW it can't get any worse!
I'm waiting for 25 years after this scp was added so the way to prevent 2399 might present itself
the rubber: talks about "the end of the world" Also the rubber after saying that: *remember to check out my new channel therubber talks*
so what's the real scp 2399 image? there's so many different kinds that it's confusing now
Scp 3812 pls because it was said to be very very very powerful is that correct???
Why not just send a fake message to power down. You managed to decode their transmissions, just tell it to stop repairing and lower its shields. Better yet take control of the thing
Scp 026 pls
What if they  disguise an emp bomb of a part of 2399 and explodes when a drone or 2399 itself comes to check?
I wanna see SCP - 312
Couldn't they take the spare parts of SCP - 2399 so they drones won't be able to build it fully? O ris there something interfering?
1) Sfdebris reviewed a TNG episode called First Contact (not the movie of the same name, an episode). In an additional side video essay it explains the nature of extraterrestrial  theory for advanced civilizations pretty damn well. Be afraid   2) if this drone is hostile, this is pretty stupid behavior. One drone to earth? Radio waves? Could not see Jupiter coming yet nearly live communication with its point of origin? Superior tech, yet had to use our own weapons against us to punish a drone rather than the drone's point of origin?  This screams of a limited resource highly advanced civilization with no hostile intent. I would not even put a "they came to steal our water" excuse since that would require at least a pin hole matter transporter ability......which A) would keep it busy on Jupiter and its moons for centuries strip mining the thing for oxygen, phosphorus, or carbon. B ) completely make our radio wave interface a joke.  You need an evil alien probe Scp? Here. 1) you discover a probe was eating Pluto. That is why the constant reclassification. A strip mining portal drone is literally eating our planets one by one and there might be others on Mars and Mercury. Barren worlds that had their atmospheres and liquid resources drained out before our civilization began and our earth might have one such probe on it beginning to eat away at some vital resource and teleporting it to their home planet 2) if you want to destroy the earth, shoot it. Just have a rail run in another galaxy fire meteors at us. We get plenty of news reports of the years of asteroids coming close to the earth. Maybe have a barely more advanced than us species use us for target practice and they have only gotten closer and closer of centuries. Have SCP count how many such asteroids have been shot and are flying at us right now. Because of space being huge, we can see the bullets coming, but we can't dodge them. 3) if you need to land a probe among us........... why?
What if. And here me out. 2399 is actually just trying to get back home after the crash it hasn’t attacked unless provoked so it makes some sense
I would think a solar flare would be  the emp they would be looking for
Because it’s Cthulhu
A lot of diferent people revealing scp secrets ro us have ben acting odd...
Do 2996 next
Hi! I love your videos, and I am a big fan as well! Keep up the good work! ^^
" indestructible "   Dr Bright: wanna bet
Bruh Jupiter keeps saving us
Jupiter is a nice bus
Plot twist: Its actually a scout unit.
This gives me knowledge and is not boring
Can u do gate guardian
4:51. I saw that among us reference
Why dont we just change by the rna    To survive and make it to help destroy plauges and to be with the environment that make us dont breath air or even swim under water and get some wings if we needed all of this by the rna if someone smart enoght
If all this stuff is classified SCP foundation files then why are you sharing this info with us
TheRubber can you please move the small version of you away from the candle it might get burn by the candle flame  the small version of you in the intro
ITS THE PROTOSS
this is my fav keter scp
"this technology does not exist"    humanity has drones capable to reach to Jupiter containing live footage of SOMEHOW solid ground in the planet that is presumably GAS GIANT.            r/woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooosh momentum
Plot twist; it wasn't interested in Earth. It wanted to go past the milky way to go to the planet with the best pizza for pick up.
What is they used one of Jupiter's moons to destroy it, the same way it got damaged?
Yoo guys and O5, hear me out.....      W A D D E R
Let's send some of those redacted human chicken things there and make a false impression?
You can send scp 682 there to possibly kill scp 682
imagine travelling millions of light years just to be stopped by a rock youre the twice the size of and get stranded on a planet.
SCP-049
scp 001? pls  btw i saw a channel copy ur content
What if you throw SCP-682 or SCP-096 onto the great red spot?
just tell them to don't lmao
imagine those aliens just wanting to help us
You should do SCP-783 or SCP-914
Jupiter dosen't have a surface.
can you tell about scp-087?
What if they were aliens that want to help us just because they thought we were cute and then end up making us into their version of house cats? Dunno how I feel abt that tho:/
SCP foundation are dumb if they can decode the signals they can send a similar one to tell it to either stop repairing itself or to destroy itself
THANK U JUIPTER
We’re in a arms race with that thing but it probably Had a 10 thousand year head start 🤣
the saddest part of his videos is when they end :(
This is more important than my sleep
idek scp it just looked cool so i clicked it
What if we put our 45th powerful bomb against part of the sheild it put more power towards that side then we use those nukes you talk about and than destrot Jupiter
Oh yeaaaah, a space one !
Somehow passionate writers can make better fiction for free then prosffesional paid writers ( looking at you latest star wars movies and canon)
always looking forward to your videos, man, they make my day
Where’s nasa
Where part 2
Why not just put a bomb like c4 onto or into one of the drones and blow it up from the inside or use a more convincing yet powerful scp
So this is related to the bismarck.
@justdustin let's see you now
Why not send SCP 682 to SCP 2399??
Haha terraria destroyer goes bbrrrrr....
HOW do you make these so quickly? Weekly uploads is INSANE for an animation channel.
2399: *recovers and on its way to earth*  Also 2399: *gets hit by multiple asteroids and heads towards the sun*   Me: This Is agent wolf...scp 2399 is terminated...Yes I used my abilities to it's course. Who gave me permission? Dr. Bright.
If we can decrypt communications to the scp' we can write messages to it.  Has anyone considered giving it a return or self destruct command?
If it has weapons it did not come for peace
nuke em all make em suffer
*SCP 2399 vs SCP 682*     who would win?
what if you use 343 to help you with all the emp stuff and try to defeat 2399.
DO BURNING MAN IVE BEEN ASKING FOR SO LONG
Ooh w new video !
This isn't a joke but try 682 since it adapts to anything and 682 would be a problem if It didn't work
Why don’t they ask Scp 343 to destroy it
I wonder why people dislike the video?
Welp, you've convinced me. 2020 was far from the worst year ever...
The first video of Scp I’ve seen this year :D
Wait... Does Rubber stand for "gomme" in French or for "préservatif"???😅😅😅
So what you’re saying is we are screwed?
SCP 001
All hail the rubber the researcher of anomalies
This is one of my favorite scp because Of the impending doom
I think I just heard a among us ejection sound on the part where he said 1971 to 1981
Yo what if their mad at something scp 1000 might have done before we wiped them out. Or if maybe their the decendants of scp 1000 that colonized other worlds
(We can use thaumiel scps against it or find its fragments before it?)
How about send a signal to it in the same manner it was receiving it and tell it to stop repairs or to destroy it’s self or disassemble it’s self
simple solution: steal any pieces that you find and dispose of them. doing so would prevent this thing from completing its orders.
Bro I thought I was subbed, wth-
Wait if Jupiter is just a gas giant without surface how the hell can he stand on it, this is next level shit
0:59 *ah yes, it’s all coming together now*
As the devour coming in 30 years isn't bad enough  Ofcourse lets get this dangerous scp with 25 years left  I know right thats great.
Jupiter is a gas planet, wouldn’t the SCP just fall to the centre of Jupiter to never escape from its powerful gravitational pull
me remembering that jupiter has a red spot: "oh no."
"Currently indestructible" IO and Jupiter: Allow us to intoduce ourselves
im just asking is Scps real? bc im really scared dying at age 35
Will there ever be a part 3 to “the flesh that hates”?
Looks like a FRANXX, But worse Or a Klaxosaur, but from Jupiter
*Ahem... inhales* "DR. BRIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!"
4:50 Among Us Rubber
How about ask "SCP-343 THE GOD"To like dismantle, destroy or vanish "SCP-2399"
Wait... if they set of that nuke on Jupiter. They would blow it into pieces. That's probably more dangerous than the Maunfunctining destroyer
If learning about scps was a class I would be more than happy to attend to it
Well they calculated that scp 2399 needs 25 years to complete itself in the time 1996 that means next year it will complete its maintenace
uh oh UH OH UH OH
maaan imagen this comeing today we are doomed
is it just me or after 1-2 years of watching the rubber i just realized that the little rubber character is adorable and of the way his mouth moves xD
Nice vid bro
Is this the rubber a scp he can survive on jupiter and can go near anything.
next do a another god like scp plsssssssssssss
Wow I love ur videos, can u do one about scp 212 or maybe scp 914? It could be interesting
ok guys we only got 25 years left ,,we need a plan ..i say we send james charles there
bruh why cant they just use scps they have contained to destroy it, some of them can destroy it with a blink of an eye.
Thanks Jupiter
I wonder if scp 682 could take on the destroyer if it can rapidly increase its size as ive seen warning videos of why not to launch 682 into space because it could theoretically grow big enough to litterally eat a planet so if you did this it would be a last resort end of humanity event where we just send 682 up there as a final f#!k you to 2399 or maybe the reptile would work with us because of the situation as he would likely be destroyed maybe if it ever came to earth but its unlikey that would happen as he hates everything that breathes or moves and wants nothing more than to ril the fabric of existence apart so i think it would be really cool to see a full size match up of those two an unlikey meeting but a very cool senerio
sonic movie emp
SCP-2399 : KETER CLASS INDESTRUCTABLE  Dr.Bright   : YEET
Pls do SCP 5000 NEXT ALSO KNOWN AS WHY???
Force the moon io at the destroyer and let's see it try to survive that.
The Broken God: "Why do I hear boss music?"
Wait isn't there a timeline where dr bright destoys it with the moon
y not just put an EMP into 914 and set it to very fine and repete it like 7 times
Is it just me or is Jupiter your favorite planet now? (It always was for me)
Part 2 plsss
4:51 - The Rubber was Not the Impostor.
Another Zoom Call Another Rubber video
can't believe that i've never heard of this scp
I just have one thing to ask, what was the second type of message, after they stoped the intercepting messages, was it war or not?
Does anyone know what was the second message that was blocked by THE SCP FOUNDATION from getting to SCP 2399??
What if 2399 is chilling while waiting in the robots to fix it up so 2399 can fight something bigger?
Chuck a moon at it
Some things strange
if it got damaged while it was moving?.... It means that the shield is not working while 2399 is moving..... So when that thing is completed and heads towards the earth foundation can fire some nuclear bombs or something even powerful at it to destroy it...(does this make sense?)
Hi brother sone thing to me on new year
Send scp2599 for the work
There is actually quite a simple way to destroy scp-2399 Just broadcast the new grubhub ad
"It is currently indestructible"  Dr. Bright after looking at a moon: Yo hear me out....
Nah there are much dangerous creature aroun here to focus on such thing and anyway instead of an arm race why not vollect the fragment if the bots cant find themissing part then theres no chance to repair it
POV: You're part of the 05 council, and are tasked in making a crucial decission to decide humanities fat  Option 1.) Surrender Option 2.) Fight back and probobly fail Option 3.) Esstablish communication Option 4.) Accept the empending doom brought before us  ...Please choose wisely...
Im just waiting for the scp 4000 pt 2 cause it seem interesting asf
。       •　 　ﾟ　　。     • 　 .   。　 . •  。 　　。.　　　.　　　•  .   　　 .   　 . •
What if its after the deer,he was from the space after all
Ngl that looks cool
why not send an scp at it
in the minute 5:58 that was the gate guardian? :o
Before the vid an ad of scp books that have info about scps were played
2399 they should try moving 2399 sence we cant destroy it meybe we could drag it in to the black hole? And leave it there stuck?
Rubber is such a good boy
I love the among us refrence
Can’t we like ask the SCP <God> if he know any information on it?
Hi
I mean, this thing is most likely able to be damaged by itself. It would only make sense: If our technology is not effective, its own would most likely would be. So I have an idea: Using nanobots, you could attach them to the drones and have 2399 either fire on its own drones or if they get back inside the main body; it could potentially damage itself further.
"It is currently indestructible"  It WAS until Dr Bright launched Io (Jupiter's moon) at it. The video Dr Bright Loses His Spark brings this up.
Just sent it  a radio signal  saying we need your help and make it go back to its planet.
and keep the good scps on earth
I still can't believe that the great red spot is actually an Advanced Alien tech
we just need to take scps off earth and put them on pluto or some planet
They need to use a super e.m.p to be capable of destroying its force field.
Protocol LEGIONNAIRE: *fails* SCP Foundation: We must create a technology for destroy it! The SCPs which can destroy everything: We are waiting
Please,made animation about facility 13,2 champion scp,the gate guardian(scp 001) and the dear(scp 2845) vs leech boy(scp 1730) fight for all life in the world!
You should do scp 179
Okay wrinkle brain time show it a picture of shy guy and just use scps to kill it
and if we use scp 914 we put an emp in it and improve it so that it can destroy it?
Part 2? 😳👌
Good thing Dr. Bright destroyed it
Looming armageddon in the form of a giant indestructible death machine.
do scp 4666 the yule lad B)
I love the rubber! God I feel dirty saying that.
is it just me or do ppl pronounce keter differently, one group says k-ee-tur. the other says k-eh-tur. which one is correct?
My favorite scp
just call saitama
My favorite SCP :)
nice scp ad im lookinng forword to buying there books
what is they placed a bomb of some sort on one of the drones, and when the drone went back into 2399 then detonated the bomb. that probably wouldnt work though.
Just throw a moon at it, it worked the first time
Well it was damaged by a moon why not drop one on it or use the claw scp to crush it
zezs
If only we can throw an SCP at it and see what happens
SCP 2399: [ALL SYSTEMS FUNCTIONAL]  [REPAIRS 100% COMPLETED]  Dr. Bright: Oh no, what are we gonna do? *Proceeds to vibe check it with a moon*
2021 its at 104% OH NO!!! I mean we have an army of SCP what will we do!
Still the missing parts and destroy it
I think that thing is more like a "World Creator" or "World Dominater"...I bet you know what I am saying, don't you....    Exactly.....
Obey dr bright could defeat it UwU
Earth:This is Our end...  IO:*Smacks scp 2399*  Jupiter:*Pulls 2399 IN like a Fish On a Fishing rod.*
so scp 2399 is basically a world destroying mecha *nice*
This is only a recommendation but you should do a video of doctor Wondertainment or any of his creations like the Little Mister Collection.
Mimic the signal telling it to stay put and have the jamming array broadcast that into jupiter.
The scp foundation must have a lot of BUDGET
What if we blow up Jupiter?  Destroying a planet's core should knock out its magnetic field and disable SCP-2399's. If not, than a blast that big should enough damage to give us more time to think of a way to contain or get rid of it.
The Rubber was not the impostor.
Besides the lizard, isn't there an scp that can take this out?
Scp 184
Dr. Bright be like: Imma just chuck a moon on that damn thing
If the world ends it the scp
Scp 2399: I have eyes on earth  the moon: YEET! Scp 2399: OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!
do another scp-387 i want more lego zombies
My dear humans and mortals, if a moon was able to damage it just by a grazing hit, imagine what would happen if the whole thing slammed down on it. Food for thought...
foundation: we can't destroy them and we need someone that knows how to break the shield  me at age 29: why didn't you say so **enables litteral plasma cannon with 100000000 amounts of power**
Yes!
Waiting for next scp.they😶
Just tell scp 343 to destroy it
There's so many inevitable SCPs which are gonna destroy all of everything in like a couple dozen years, it's scary
Totally the coolest scp i ever seen
throw a moon at it! it damaged it once so it might work again! i joke of course
What about a laser? Light can pass through its shield, so.
Also if you could explain the relation between 2399 and 4217 that would be great!

Why is it that this scp is the one that I know can't be real but not because of the scp itself, but because of the technology of the foundation and the math on the repair. Great animation as awlways
Maybe ask them if they can remove SBMM in COD and just make a ranked playlist.
Next thing you know, we’ll be getting messages saying “Hello, puny planet, this is de Incursean Empiah, and you shall all bow down tah me, Emperah Milleous”
Can you cover scp 339?
throw one of jupiters many moons at it
You didn’t mentioned that after radio silence 2399 started receiving different orders, more worrying orders....
That's not good
I haven’t had power for 2 days, this makes me happy. I’ve heard of this story already and it’s quite sad.
When the mini rubber gets flown of the screen it plays the among us music. Now we know, Rubber is the imposter.
4:50 therubber was not an imposter
Some jerk named Kevin Nguyen stole the Siren Head video from you and reuploaded it on his channel!!!!!
Maybe we could send a message to the universe it came from
can you make a video about SCP-1487, SCP-166 or SCP-354
New SCP is discovered.   SCP 628: cmon, we know it's not gonna kill me. Can you stop PLEEEAAAASSSSEEEE.
Yo 093 part 3...just saying
Yes my favorite scp of all time
4:51 There it is, a Among Us reference, what else could we expect in 2021
This is beter than my sh*t profile man👌
use a nuclear war head?
Imagine if if when it finally comes to earth, a message plays that says "Hello, humans, we of the galaxy zircon have noticed you haven't quite figured out pollution and warp matter yet. As such, we formally introduce ourselves as the embassy of the intergalactic union, and send this Mk-1 terraformer as a sign of peace and effort to establish contact. It is able to self repair, so you are able to partially disassemble it to gather components for your first true space-faring craft, while it neutralizes any effects of global warming on your planet. Apologies for not sending a more advanced model, budget cuts. We hope to see you soon at (COORDINATES)"
Even if we can destroy it there will just be more
Still want the rubber to do scp 4335
Dr. Bright go brrrrr
Same
I propose we install some Scranton Reality Anchors around the thing, use some reality warpers or dimension-opening SCP's to put it in a space and time outside of our own, and then activate the SRA's in an effort to 'lock' it away. If we have a recall procedure, or a method of creating a doorway too small for it to enter, that would give us the chance to test and learn about it. Locking it away will also prevent the reception of future messages.   If it wasn't for the anti-matter field, we might be able to make use of a Mercury amalgam to create a large mirror near the base of 2399, in order to utilize SCP 093 and a D-Class subject for containment.  Since we were able to decipher the intercepted messages, perhaps we could create our own false signal, provided the transmissions didn't have an embedded verification code.  We might also be able to make use of 055's properties, if we can manage to keep a photo of it in constant observation of 2399 and/or its drones, and observe what effect that might have on its programming.
I wonder if they could send a command to destroy the SCP.
Scp 134 pls 😡
Wait. What about that green alien SCP, the one that sees UV light? What if its the same race? Unlikely but if it knew one of this race was on earth maybe it would act differently?
what scp is this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How do they find anything inside the dence atmosphere of jupiter? It's surface is unreacheable becouse of  the huge pressure
the foundation can try to attack thr ground below it so it sinks down and down and reaches the core and gets melted if that can happen?
There must be an SCP that can be used/convinced to assist. After all, they reside on this planet....
Why can't the SCP Foundation use an ARC reactor to power the MEGA EMP? Why don't the fight fire with fire, you know, Alien tech with alien tech?
It this there cus I am scared  The rubber
Did anyone today think “it’s been awhile since rubbers posted”
Plz do 783 next aka crooked man
Can anyone send me the join link?
Is this true are we gonna die
Make scp 001
Me when the rubber doesn't upload: keter  Me when he uploads: safe
Rubber was not the impostor.
Just throw the goddamn lizard at it and it will somehow works.
The little octopus robots looks like the robots from '' The war of The worlds''
Can you do one of scp-001 please?
Didnt bright yeeted a moon towards that thing and destroy it?
Hmm SCP on Jupiter Let's snowboard towards it
On the version of SCP 001 (the broken god), SCP 001 was stopped by SCP 2399 shooting a laser from jupiter into the body of SCP 001 during its wake.  Doesn't sound like it wants our destruction for sure.
You forgot to mention how dr. Bright destroyed it
I would like to hear scp 3001 red reality cuz its diffrent then other scp its reality not an entity
"suppress any knowledge pertaining to 2399." Ah yes, that is why the information can be found on a public website.
Coudnt they try measuring the force that scp 2399 hit the planet that hurt it too see how much force they need
Cool among us refrens

If the machine is indestrucdible why not use juputers moon against it like a peace of it to test out
Well, I guess that blocks us from going to Jupiter. That sucks.
Honestly The rubber is the best scp channel he has good narration good animation and a cool looking  character
Nice video!
Online school is boring
Let's hope SCP-2399 can't watch YouTube, or else we might be in trouble...
We dont have the power to make an EMP that strong? Wrong. The Tesla Bomb that is constanly generating energy and is gonna blow at some time (dont remeber scp number)
_SEND IT INTO A BLACK HOLE-_
why not stand on the other side of 2399 and look at a photo of 096? then hook up some nukes and emps to 096 and send it through the barrier.
Are scp's real
can you stop puting the w shape on your face please its ugly
Alien SCPs are by far the best.
Why don't we just steal parts before it finds them?-
Actually, in our timeline, the destroyer was destroyed : Dr Bright sent a moon on it
4:51 𝚁𝚞𝚋𝚋𝚎𝚛 𝚠𝚊𝚜 𝚎𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝𝚎𝚍 ...
Now we know what 4217 was referring to
d
So if all the scp there are were all real there would have been no body on earth and no body will be able to survive on earth
Gotta love how they make most of these scp stories seem possible.
make one about the door knob and fuck off, libtard rubble
Why not deploy 100 warheads or nukes?
TheRubber was not the imposter
Rubber is the best
4:51 among us text sound
I hope this is not real
Me : on class  Subscriptions:*NOTIFICATIONS*  Me:screw class
_News Alert: Xenon Mounting Defense Platform In Sol._
Bro he's so much into among us he had to put in a reference lol
Okay can someone explain why SCP-4217 knows about SCP-2399
They should just use scps
Wait, but isn't jupiter made out of g a s ?
When scp-2399 approches Earth: i can kill everyone! Nuke: have i launched tsar bomba?.... no i will try it now
Are these real?
why don't just use the second most powerful SCP in the world something that can destroy almost instantly but it is a safe class object
You should do scp-3812 next. I am obsessed  with that one
I love this scp seems powerful
thanks Jupiter your a real one I new you would save earth one day
Well.. Io did the trick the first time, so it is vulnerable to 'big rock'.  We have plenty of those laying around....
imagine if the rubber was our teacher and teached us about scps yeaaaaah
Can you do SCP 548 please
i wonder what SCP would win in an SCP battle royale
use 914 :/ even the d-bois use it correct but the people KEEPING AND OWNING IT cant even use it correct
Will there be KOOLLAID SCP
You should give SCP-1230 a look ! I think you'll love it !
Why not use scp 343 to destroy it
its fake or real???
Wait so how is this SCP related to Scp-4217?
You should make one about SCP 5000
YAY
How do you know this
WE ARE ALL DEAD
have they tried 682 ?
Lol I’ve been watching u ever since a ad came up like at 30-33k subscribers I was watching ur videos and really it’s so good
It looks like an ultra beast from pokemon
This Spaceship is probably Stronger than the DeathStar.
First is that robotic thing real? Second if it’s real im done Third if it’s not real phew it’s not the end of us Lastly I don’t think scp’s exist
I'm pretty sure one of the 05's is a Class 5 Reality - Bender, or Class 6, so why not just cancel its existince...
Ok but did nobody think to just take the debris so the little robots cant take it to repair the thing-
This shit so good you can make someone belive it
just get item 001 and delet it
HOW MANY SCP'S are there? ?????
Rubber thank u uv answerd my comment thank u somuch
MTF means mobile task force
Don't nukes create a emp wave when they blow? Or send it a pic of SCP-096 face? Or ask the butler to destroy it? Or build a lego strike force? I think that would be the best option.
Damn, jupiter is such a bro
Jupiter is a gas planet  Rubber: *gives it landmass*
Hers a solution BAG
What if you show 099s face to that scp or bring 682 to rip it up from a ship or use the computer to hack it. Or the mechanical surgeon, who operates on machines. Perhaps the little girl could will it destroyed or small. Or use a reality bending scp and get rid of it.
How can they forget? They never use our most powerful weapon, the combined power of mothers chancla
Main objective is to pass throught the shield and derstruct ir jupiter has given us time that we stand for.
Do a vid on scp 001
Dr.Bright after getting hight on 420-j: just throw Europa at it
No no no no no no noooooooo aaaaaaa
Plot twist 2399 was sent to destroy 169
Just find parts before drones,  place on parts deactivated nanites programmed to buid nuke.  Explosion inside ship destoy it completely by chain reaction of elements.
Dr. Bright: Wanna blow Jups?
Aaaaaaa ono
Baguttes
No one:  TheRubber: I. O.
"TheRubber was not the Imposter..."
Why don't they knock out SCP-682 and just launch him at it in a rocket because wouldn't one of two things happen either 2399 is destroyed by 682 or 2399 destroys 682 either way one would be terminated by the other
Next video we wana scp 4975
From what I remember, it was actually aimed at the Church of The Broken God and not Earth
Jupiter has a solid surface?
I got a great idea, the object won't continue unless it is 100% complete right, steal a important piece from it so it will never prosper
Scientist: dear god, we're all going to die... TheRubber: :3 9:01
Bruh in twenty five years I'm gonna be 37
can you make an animation of scp 191
2:55 no! Why did you make it look like the guardians from breath of the wild?! This is the scariest part of this video and nobody can say otherwise
Alien invasions I glad we are not evaded by SCP-2399 thank goodness cuz if we are been debated by scp-2399 world would end
Who else is watching this during live class?
I have been learning about space and mosly planets and dwarf planets, this scp 2399 is not true, no such materials can survive in jupiter if you get deeper inside jupiters gas you will experience hotter temperature than our own earths core  And in that red spot there is a large storm that has been going for more than 400 years and if the storm cannot destroy that material the large meterorites will   The material that scp 2399 use is most likely from our neighboring galaxy,adromeda galaxy or its from the dark energy
Well they could use scp 914
Did I just see a amougus refrence
how much does the Scp The Rubber even know about Jupiter?
Why not use a powerful reality bender/s to destroy it or hurt it?
Why does the scp foundation look for the other parts and flee
Good thing Bright crashed Io on the red spot, and successfully destroyed 2399
4:51 #amongus
Make nest part
Spoiler alert,it eventually finishes its repairs and comes to kill everyone.
Just throw some astroids to it and it gone
The among us  refrence
I wonder if they can throw a whole moon to destroy 2399 maybe it will work
Why is this SCP not thaumiel, seeing as technically it could incapacitate some dangerous SCPs e.g 096
Don't Worry, Bright Somehow Launched a Moon At It
Bruh just tell a reality-bender that it’s a playground and let it go wild.
Why not just destroy the debrie so that it can’t put itself back together
Csfp  3110 three 110 is a planet comprised of carbon with lifeforms comprised of water on it lifeforms appear to be hostile as they have shown to send out objects trying to destroy watchtower
I like to think the destroyer came from the often speculated destroyed fifth planet in our solar systems which scientists believed might have existed at some point in time
I heard a little about this SCP before, and it is a great storyline. Will there be part 2? Also pls can you do SCP-999?
Do scp-5000
I have a suggestion for the foundation, they could try to use a reality warping scp to make them non hostile or destroy  them.
Please do scp-321, 590, or dr bright mabye?
7:09 There is an inaccuracy. The astronomer Cassini saw 2399 first, not the foundation.
SCP 166
i love the among us reference!
so we have 25 yrs? before we die
I have a question....it's seem like near scp 2399 is there land?   Because jupiter don't have a solid surface
I always knew Jupiter have life there
by Jove what an advanced weapon
the drones look like something out of Ratchet and Clank: all 4 one
Mal function
what if 2399 is just a small message bot trying to tell humans to wear masks.
Dr. Bright: Toss a planet or something at it, see what happens.
put  The Peanut  inside the ship.
I would like to try sending the shy guy to 2399. Who would win?
The first message received from the SCP-2399  *Rudimentary creatures of blood and flesh, you touch my mind, fumbling in ignorance, incapable of understanding.*
Doesn’t this one also link up with the battleship SCP? I remember it displaying images of Jupiter, specifically the red spot. So what if the reason it’s been sent to earth is for it’s pilot. Or perhaps a rescue mission.
Do 582 next.
Just send a picture of scp 096 to 2399 since it wont stop unless its 682 lol or send 682
Jupiter is a gas giant , its total chaos inside its atmosphere , not a good place to repair . Also , an super advanced alien device capable of stoping any kind of weaponry we have now cant dodge a big ass moon? Cmon 😂
Is this like the last man alive but the story is different and actually happening?
Wooooooooo
Fucking destroy it.
SCP-2399: Exist Gendo Ikari: Shinji...
SCP 2399 is like the protos pilon.
That SCP is connected to The Bismark, he appears to come from it
Just send 2399 a picture of SCP 096 face and we’ll be fine.
Isn't the rubber a wanted man because  he is showing  a lot  scp
Literaly looked 1,5 hours earlier if there was any new wideo
Bruh this is pissing me off great red spot is ther scp mega gay
SCP-079 would like to have a word with you
So its an alien so call master chef in he well take care of it lol
Foundation: yay we destroyed this thing! Scp 2317: I’ll be with you in just a moment.
just make a death star lazer you idiots
SCP 2399 vs SCP 682 One of them has to die right?
Put the best electromagnetic device you have into scp-914 And then repeat till you have one powerful enough.
I hope this is just a story not really
I love your video keep the good effort 💞💞💞
Couldn't someone just put an advanced electromagnetic pulse device in that SCP that improves items and just keep on doing that until we have the necessary firepower to take out said threat?
4:51    rubber was not an impostor
3:10 jupiter: *doesnt have a solid surface*                                                              Repair drones: *scavenges parts from the surface of jupiter*
Lol how many SCP's are involved in the Red Spot!?
Pls do scp 166
Wait i realised we have frickin 343 why not just say to him like hey if that thing is fully repaired we are all dead
"Project Gigas" Is that an Earthbound reference?
Why don’t they just use the kids to Turn it into dust
What if all the SCP authors make one collaborative story to further their SCP's story or maybe make a gigantic breach or world ending scenario, but well I understand that it breaks the theme of SCP being "fake real" type of thing, but still would be cool to get that type of thing.
Who else wishes he could do a face reveal
I DONT WANNA DIE :C
Out of every one of them this is the only I like
didn't they throw io at it?
Fun fact: the last command scp 2399 received (on it's official page) is to stop repairs and head to target. When you click on the word "target" it leads you to a 001 proposal: the broken god (orusborous)
Remember when 4217 gave a clue that is is connect ed in some way to this
Why don’t we ask god lol
Sometimes I wonder why his videos are still here and not deleted?
Throw a moon at it - Dr.Bright
To be fair scp foundation have severals scp that can blow up Jupiter or erase it whole, the problem is they will probably blow or damage more than just Jupiter  :D
They should just strap the shy guy and 682 to a rocket and send them both to jupiter.
Just throw a moon at it
Is this Final Fantasy Weapon?
Oh gosh, it looks like the Reapers from Mass Effect! That can't be good! Although, those little drones look super cute. I would gladly pet and cuddle one.
Many agree in cannon that SCP-2399 is destroyed at some point before it is done repairing by Dr. Bright chucking one of jupiter's moons at it.
Can’t they send 343 as a termination attempt
" hello, I'm the rubber" just makes my day complete
Imagine being capable of destroying planets and then you are incapacitated because you hit the moon
Anything *exists* SCP foundation: Time to bring out our boi the lizard
couldn't they just ask scp 343 to destroy it?
are scp real
SCP Scientist: *smoking weed* Hmm what if we found a way to hurl that fucker into the sun?  Second SCP scientist: *also high* Man who knows maybe that could work but rn I’m trying to relax
Why didn't they ask scp 343 for help¿
Is it even real bc if it was real i would be rrly scared!
2399 is connected to the Bismarck SCP ... So who else is connected to this set?
Can you do 2000 next please (just a suggestion).
I commented this on a Dr. Bob video, but I would love to see a collab between The Rubber, Dr. Bob, and Tales from the Foundation. Maybe get Dre Mation and SCP Exposed, and SCP Explained in there. Some kinda of massive crossover, even an SCP that jumps between realities (given the number out there, I'm sure one of them does that) and each reality is tackled by a different channel. I dunno, just some massive Avengers style crossover between the big SCP channels. And then we can send our SCP Avengers to go destroy the SCP 2399 Thanos that threatens to destroy us.
Foundation you need something more powerful people break through Shield I know what are the little man that lives with power of a power you can able to make the biggest laugh in your life and with that black blonde you can able to Boise shield for a couple of minutes when he sees a Bonneville for any attack missiles are the best options
maybe they should try sending scp 999 up there to make it not mad
I found this channel on my Amazon Tablet! now i love it! i will make a goal for ya Goal:100k
Can you do mold ester moon pls
4:51 Rubber was the impostor (Data expunged) remain
Have u done a video of SCP-4XXX (the smile room)? Cuz I wanna see that
Scp 999
Ye
If they want to stop scp-2399 just put a nuke in the clockwork machine on very fine
I love your SCP animations!
Just imagine one day the Destoryer actually completes its repairing and comes to destroy the earth just imahinhow much has it would be
Nice video, Rubber! 👍 BTW, I have a request for the next SCP animation and maybe u like it...  It's about SCP-1765, Sisters They did some "experiment" with all Foundation personel as their subject, and they even transformed the Foundation site into their "experimental site".
Seems like a lot of effort just to survive for 5 additional years. SCP-2317 is supposed to awaken in 30 years, and is considered unavoidable doomsday. Why bother wasting all the resources that could be used to try escape this planet, that apparently is made of target marks for the rest of the universe?
scp 2399: i am indestructible. bronken god: are sure about that scp 682: meh ????: 7 9v r:9g!!79(asterisk) this last one is a code
Jupiter actually has no land, that’s why it’s a “gas giant” it’s gust pure gas in a ball
Among us reference at 4:50
If they want to keep that thing from being fully repaired, why not steal some of the pieces before those drones find them? Drag those pieces to earth and experiment on those while those drones are stuck on Jupiter.
The rubber: *Uses among us sound for his video*  Me: *Still addicted to that game Rubber?*  Edit: Like seriously are you still addicted to that game Rubber?
Precise tracking system Guardian music plays
Io is one word bubba. Eyeoh.
I remember when TheRubber made a video on SCP-4217 which has memories of Jupiter so could SCP-2399 be related to The Bismark?
It looks like a secret super boss in a JRPG
Aha one of those SCPs whom foundation can't throw D Class until it stops 😅
I want to know what would happen if we use Scp 2501 on it
Launch 682 at it
Imagine you in Sp 2399 Fusion has one you become a God and rule the universe
If I were you I wouldn't let it be hard wait build it all the way to if you have it will be such a good man versus Superman nine-year-old call destroy that every where did the Romans destroy my uniform not cool you want to go happens to SCP Foundation they all die every single cuz they is smart enough and know that is what true my lover's we found it early SeaWorld Van Morrison wild a more Universal supercharger charge and ask God help with it a blast off into a different dimension of a diamond Channel traveler inside a pack thank you Charlie parents 8Ball sorry sorry guys Universe 1 or should I say Earth One
Aunnully is monthly right
so youre telling me you can have nice talks with LITEAL GOD but you cant make a strong enough thing to kill a robot ok nice talk
Can you make a video about SCP-330
Why not shove 682 into a misslle and fire it at 2399?
I think that 2399 was built by the architects from subnautica
Keter Now Apollyon Soon
Who else is a *"Among Us"* gamer? 4:51
4:51  *TheRubber was not an impostor*
My god just send let Dr bright at it I'm sure he'll use one of Jupiter's moon's to kill it he neutralized 096 for God's sake
Part of the broken God
SCP-2399's file contains false information because 2399 actually saved humanity from an SCP-001 proposal
Scp 2399 you are going to kill us all in 25 years *sigh* maybe people that they are already dead are safe or maybe we can survive some how idk but i have an idea for a scp so the robber can do it i think "scp 001" because is like that distructive
I've been waiting for this for a long time!
Part 2 ?
I hope my scp animation channel gets as good as your man!
Low rank scientist: “what if we just yoink a piece of it and make it out of reach so that it can’t rebuild Everyone: “oh... that would actually work... someone get this man a promotion”
4:50 A M O N G   U S
You don't know dr Bright already launched a moon on it got neutrialised?
This one sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory lol
that’s that nigga from fortnite
Indestructible ? Dr. Bright have different opinion
this one makes me wonder it would be like super easyto use nukes to drop one of the jupiter moons on it to break it or at least suspend it for more times
Your animation is too cool for me...!!!
Love your vids
SCP-783 PLEASE
Dr. Bright: How about we-  Foundation: SHUT
Any rain for Creations on the living Universe something to help you guys with something going to happen there's a future whatever you was just going to tell that means you when you start blocking his Messenger to the building what is the biggest state sorry sorry I fell pregnant iPhone mute over 8 9 10 or save for 12
Imagine if they finally destroy it and the aliens just send A CRAP TON OF THEM
Cool
Can't you just use either a teleportation SCP or god-like SCP to simply blink it out of existence?
Why don’t they use SCP-343?
Yo wazzup
They should have thrown some class d's in it smh
why not just reengineer the repair signal to command it to stop
Just try giving it a different order instead of fix yourself like the other one make it destroy it's self if it can be translated then we could easily wright in it and send the message to the scp right (Sorry if this makes no sense might have explained this badly )
Humanity: Well ded _Memes_ *It's time to shine*
Are these myths made by people or are u making these up cause I'm confused
Pls make vedio on SCP 4666
I'd just thinking that scp foundation is a lot of stupid people same as public humanity that afraid from other races or maybe human is a racist. because why don't they just let them arrives on earth, make friends with them and they'll share us their technology, scp foundation not cares about morals, and about peace. They're only care to destroy.. and they don't even learn about symbiosys
Couldn’t they just use reality benders?
are these real?
Can u do one on scp-1861?
Use the children thing and tell them that ship making it go away lol
Can't they just collect the parts it's needed to repair? Why attack it, just take away the source to repair itself.
One of my dreams that dont make me uneasy.
Good job When are you going to do the peanut (scp173)        This is the earliest I’ve been
Just tell the other scp’s they may help us beat it.               Ik it will not work
why not make a robot to fight this one like transformers
SCP-999 animation please
There a tale where Dr Bright destroyed SCP 2399 by somehow throwing one of Jupiter’s moons IO I think at it
*Thats a great red spot* 👁👄👁
Lol
Didn't dr bright throw a moon at it and destroyed it
Good vid
Didn't scp-4217 (bismarck) mention or reference an object that was in the eye of Jupiter?
This is one of my favorite scps ever
Rubber : shows land in Jupiter.   Any scientist: "that's illegal "
Send the doom slayer
"Awe... When I first saw it, I felt awe."
4:50 Rubber was not an scp
Can I drive it?
Or you could just shove some stuff into that machine that upgrades everything a few times over
what about scp 4001? that's probably one of my favorites
PROJECT GIYGAS?
Can you animate scp 2935? Please xD
Is there a friendly SCP that could combat or deter 2399?
I love your channel omg ❤️
Just say no 2399 can't legally destroy us with out consent
"One giant EMP, powered by God-knows-what"   YES.
can the foundation attempt to talk with it?
If this is true iam 10 so it will happen when im 35
Nuclear bomb, just saying
Is it that SCP- 2399, which was shown at SCP- 4217 'The Bisma4ck'? Wowww, Cool mr. Rubber
Heared a Version once where Dr, Brigth yeeted Titan, one of Jupiters Moons on 2399 and destroyed it that way...
Scp-2399 is a alien from Jupiter, well that's interesting. Common thing that aliens come from Mars 👀😅
pls make the rubber face reveal video !
The foundation must use the Nokia 3310 on 2399
My favourite scp along with Bismarck and day break
Project legionnarie is a jock, Some anomaly in the fundation probably could make kick work of the Destroyer
Dr.Bright after smoking SCP 420J: Let’s just throw a moon at it.
You should do scp-1875! It involves a picture thing is that picture scared the living F R I C K out of me
Storm atronach
A Warframe Sentient
why does this video have so many among us sounds
“SCP-2399 is currently indestructible”...that is until Dr.bright becomes project head and decides to throw a whole moon at it
I wonder why the drones aren't classified as instances of Scp-2399-A since the drones are independent.
Here’s an idea:      Why not ask 343 to take care of it?
blow up other pieces found so it can't repair
Just for you know, in alternate universe 2399 successfully destroy Earth, but in "OUR" Universe, somehow.... Dr. Bright throw the jupiter moon at SCP-2399 and..... successfully terminated it
Welp time to go live on Mars and watch the destruction of earth
Dr Bright be like: Lets trow a moon at it
Bet 1000 dollars the next video won’t be SCP 999
What if this Scp was sent to help
i knew theres life on juipter
im going to JUPITER BOISSSSSSSS
GJ
Jupiter does not have a solid surface so why is there land?
Jupiter is not terrestrial it's a gas giant... therefore there wouldn't be any ground... why is there clearly ground here?
I just realized his hand look like peni3s
You should do a video on 4217 if you haven't, since it elaborates a little on 2399.
*Any New SCP discovered*  SCP Foundation: Send in the lizard
Just send SCP-682 to it!
I getting earlier each time and bro make a video on man's best friend
The idea why don't the foundation make a rocket that can teleport or dash through  the force shield
therubber: makes new vid  me:hehe boi
is this scp somehow connected to harbinger and bismarck scp"s???
YES ANOTHER VIDEO POG
Me:Aaaaaaah we are gonna die! 2399 : translation plz? Me : boop beep bop boop boop!
Every time he uploads, I’ve been in online class       And every time he uploads, I mute and turn off my camera.
IM EARLY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
did he just draw jupiter with ground?
I'm just amazed how you guys can make so well made backgrounds, animation and storytelling in such a small amount of time. I'm impressed but also worried, hope you guys won't work yourselfs to death, take breaks !! Love y'all and yo channel !
....what if SCP-2399 is Reaper?....  Anybody who played mass effect know what I mean
make a video about the connection between SCP-2399 and SCP-4217
So if we can translate the messages then couldn't we just tell it to shut down?
KAMUI
But jupiter is gas Idk...
Why not just ask SCP-343 for help
This might be rubbers last video as he revealed secret info from china government...
Really with a that among us meme
I wanna hear SCP-457
4:51 Among Us reference?
This has always been one of my favorite SCPs. Very well done!
Video Suggestion: SCP-3108 Let's load it up and turn our D-Bois into monke.
This has always been one of my favorite SCPs. Very well done!
Did he seriously just pronounce Io as I-O?
Well done
It has infinite power and shields that can survive nukes but doesn't have them up while flying blind into the solar system?
4:51 Rubber was not the impostor  LOL 😂 😂
We need a part two sometime.
So um, doesn't the SCP foundation have acces to multiple gods?
*when you find a primitive planet in stellaris*
Alright so 2399 can cause an xk class if it decides to attack
Plss do scp 999
I mean couldn't you just...throw a moon on it? It worked the first time why not doing it again?  Oh yeah in one time line Dr. Bright did it, the hero we need I'm telling you
Imagine if this was true and no one believes the rubber...
Scp 1981. Mostly because this is the only one that kinda scares me. It's a old television that depicts Ronald Reagan at one of his speeches getting mutilated repeatedly.  It's a Safe class object.
You always choose the best ones. Love it!
Rubber should start a history channel ...😅
hey rubber can you do scp 001 when day break?
O_o🤔👍👍👍👍
I love that among us reference at 4:51 a lot good job!
Fun fact Dr.Bright some how launched a moon into SCP-2399 neutralizing it after the request to launch SCP-682 was denied by the O5 Council
Jupiter unknowingly stop SCP 2399 My guess is SCP : 2399 just malfunction and trapped it self in Jupiter, such a advance indestructible drone just could have easily avoided Jupiter or any of its moon
Didn't Dr. Bright destroy this thing by sending Io crashing into it? Is that canon?
Why don't God (the scp) just wipes it out of existence?
I love this so much-
Lol this is so much easier to understand than the original text
scp 131
Fun fact: 2399 was used by the GOC to destroy the broken god from the Ourouborous SCP-001 proposal, and is suspected to be a part of it
Destroyer: can make drones Deetroyer: cant make new parts
Welp guess we will all die :D
Scp 4000 part 2?
Why do they let the UNGOC destroy it... they hate SCPS and do a good job sometimes
Just ask another power full scp to destroy it like god or manipulate the lizard to go there like if that thing comes to earth everyone will die and he will also die or something like that
E
I have a idea just say in your heart dear allah stop the aliens from coming to earth
Doesn't Doctor Bright chuck a rock at it???
nice its 2223 comments
Anyone else notice the Among us reference?
Get a part of it strap an empire to it and let the drone take it away and booom
I love this channel very much! 😆😆
Dr. Bright: yeah, but what if we threw a moon at it?
2:57 when my mom is about to slap me:         Besides that is my reaction               4:51 among us sound lul
Rubber talk about of scp 250 please
there are a lot of things that can destroy us in like 30 years lol
Ah, my favorite scp.
I should really sleep. Ah who cares story time
Day 2 of asking the rubber to do scp 2006
I'm hearing this during class and it's way better.
Is SCP real??
I wonder if 2519 would have any effect on it. Might be difficult to transport and set up a speaker system to play it but it could work.
4:51 Is this me or are those among us sounds??  TheRubber was not the impostor.
Why not use SCP-343 God as a defense on Earth if SCP-2399 were to attack? I wonder if SCP-682 is able to adapt/regen against this
Dr Bright, already eliminated the scp using jupiter's moon io - the things dr bright is not allowed to do at the foundation
Can you do SCP-4000? I would like to hear it 😀
No one SCPs and Trump: How much chaos can i make in one day?
This is one of those SCPs that are so dangerous that termination is an option given.
Would maybe the nerfing gun work on it?
U didnt answer me I ask u to make vedio of 001 when the day breaks and 2395 cave  o death
is this freacking real cause im kinda scared now?!
Imagine he flys by accident to THE KEEPER ANGEL
Russia:it's finally time that we have to fight for this planet  China:indeed 👿
The thing I hate about these videos is his lifeless inconsistent weird way of speech like he's using google text to speech
This SCP bears huge resemblances to Gah-Lak-Tus from the Marvel universe; They both tried to devour Earth (and have the ability to),and they are both complex mechanisms. I like it, but I wanted to point it out that they have a lot of similarities. Good job though! :)
Explain scp 999 pls
use new bad scp to distroy that can kill  all of  we
I love 2399 thank you so much for animating it!
So happy new vid I hope I will get pinned and liked HAHAHA
Jupiter: pulls scp 2399 Scp 2399: tis but a scratch
Till Dr.bright sends a moon at the thing
imagine it went like this alien: noooooooo we get kill by fly humans: haha biological gas, nuclear EMP go brrrrrrrrrrrr
Do scp 2774
Next episode what about 001 and scarlet king
EEEEEE I SEE THE SCP -098
nice.
Including emp devices
I think this is my favourite SCP!🤤
I've been here since the beginning and will be here until the end. Keep it up Rubber.
An indestructible, world-ending SCP? *SCP-682 intensifies*
We have access to antimatter and so do they, but why don't we use it?
This one is the best one yet they just keep getting better and better
One of things Dr.Bright did is(words of O5): Dr.Bright launched moon into scp 2399 and destroyed it, we arenot shure how he did it.
Ok, this might be fake because Jupiter does have an intense weather pattern. The nearest glassy to earth is the Andromeda galaxy. It is 2.5 million light years away. There are no other galaxy’s even close to that range. So that proves there’s a good chance this video could be fake. Oh and also back then we didn’t have that kind of technology to launch a freaking space torpedo. Point proven.      Edit: I’m not too worried about it destroying Earth because every year humanity is developing like 2-3x faster so we might be able to survive if it is real. Another thing is that Jupiter is a gas planet so it can’t crash there.
Face reveal at 10,0000
Wow
I’m writing a story on Mal.0.  After reading back I realized that I heavily based it on your video. I made some changes, but I still don’t want to be plagiarizing your work. I can send you an email when it’s finished for you to read if you wish. It’s far from completion.
If it backfires and how
You know I want to know more SCPs like Sisters, Iris, or  Neverland  lost boys, and girls.
IVE BEEN ASKING FOR SO LONG PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!! DO SCP- 420
Why is there solid ground at Jupiter for this animation? Jupiter is a gas giant, there is no surface
I say we follow dr Brights lead and build a massive chainsaw launcher.  There's simply no defense
if it will be fully repaired it will be no longer keter
I want to present my opinion to the SCP foundation that make a cloaking device,get invisible, get into the ship and destroy the ship's Intel's and software from inside or ((optional-if possible) engage the ship into self-destruct).I want this info to get into the hands of SCP foundation.
And then shoot it at it
lol im pretty sure the person who made this scp thought scps are real and the big red spot was a scp.
Gh
Plot twist: SCP 2399 was created by the creators of The Harbinger.
This entry is truely terrifying. I wouldn't be surprised if it was reclassed to appolyon.
What if you just make a super bomb by combining one of every type of bomb ever made?
Finally!! 👏
At least there was a among us reference
But know ik about this
Sooo does anyone have a tripod to destroy this thing
Who else is here because most other SCP content is too scary?
bruh that is so uncool. can you like, not shoot a laser at earth?
Can we use other SCPs, like SCP-662, to kill it?
This thing looks like the giant robot from HALO5:GUARDIANS
wait dont they have god on there side so god can just wipe it out of excistence
Why dont we send other scps to destroy it? Tell me what scps you guys would send weither its a joke or serious. i think scp 343,239 or hear me out we use the scp 093 we put the coin thing on top of it we get a giant mirror and put it in the pocket dimension. I know that would be alot of work, but its relatively cheap compared to they already tried to do to get rid of it.
Among us reference
I like the different artistic interpretations of this scp. I've seen a steampunk theme and now this one.
LOOKS LIKE SCP IS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
If they can intercept and decode their messages, maybe they could fabricate message to permanently deactivate weapons system or reprogram itself to guard earth from jupiter.
Jupiter has no orbit
man who is the creator of scp
Can you make a part 2 to this?  This was amazing!!
SCP 2399: You can’t defeat me Earth: I know, but he can Jupiter: *GET OVER HERE*
Why not ask god in a discrete way for the amp. Like "What is the strongest emo that can be made on earth. And what is it made from." He most likely not say but it's worth a shot.
If I was the leader of SCP Foundation I will buy each SCP I can a one ticket ride into the sun
Didnt Dr. Bright throw a moon at it?
but isn't Jupiter a gas giant and scp 2399 was the cause of the Great Red Spot ?? wow interesting
I got an idea on how to stop it Start gathering the pieces of 2399 to prevent it from finishing its repair and then move them away from it. Possibly throwing it into the sun
TheRubber: *talks about scps that can destroy the world*  TheRubber:                                        O O                                w
maybe try launch the nuke?

Pardon me but jupiters gravitational pull is stonger than the moon io itself and it rains diamonds on jupiter and jupiter wouldve melted it anyway at the core so...
Rubber: Scp 2399 is cannot be seen or heard of by the public.  Me: I’m Watching a video about 2399 how is that secret?
'We must prevent this thing from repairing itself." Then search for the missing parts yourself.
So..... aliens exsist 🤔🤔🤔
:p
Several things in Star Wars may have the ability to destroy it. The Electro Proton bomb could be a powerful enough EMP, Centerpoint Station’s gravity well generator could throw a planet at it or just keep it there with the power, and of course, planet killers like Starkiller base the Death Stars or a Xyston Class star destroyer cannon could likely destroy it. The likelihood of obtaining it is unlikely and even then there is uncertainty of effectiveness
*ju s t  t h r o w  o n e  o f  t h e  m o o n s  i n t o  i t*
Your a Malfunctioning Destroyer, Mr Rubber
thats sus
*Listens to this thing* Me: did ya ask SCP-343 to blink it out of existence? cause that guy is basically god
I love all the facial expressions XD
Europe Is Where I LIVe
haha early
Just get dr bright and he can throw another moon at Jupiter
Scp 343 is god put him up against it
What bout a thaumiel or apyllon class scp??
but therubber cant you just use that scp god because he is a god so cant you just tell him that we are in danger and need help from him?
Nobody’s saying anything about the among us reference?
This scp is just like Godzilla. Indestructible, overpowered, can destroy humanity, and has to wait A SH*T LOAD OF TIME to regenerate itself. But Godzilla needs radiation, and this sh*t just needs his drones.
How do you sleep at night?
Isn’t this one related to the Contain the Bismarck SCP? Isn’t it trying to destroy the creature controlling the Bismarck for some reason?
"It is currently indestructible"  Fundation deeper thoughts: *Yo just throw that lizard boi in*
Dr Bright: joke on you, I just send some giant rock orbiting jupiter to destroy 2399
Is scp 2399 real? If it's real im gonna be so scared what if he destroys earth?!?!
Just create beams made from crstalys or that have nuclear power if you have toxic waste it could just cover the barriier for about 1 to 2 years and just use something that is liquid then becomes hard the toxic waste for the barriwr can be destroyed yes the barrier is strong but nothing is possible everthing has a time imit so just figure out its time limit then just use powewful gun with beams it will take about 12 years to figute out and the mines will help you but. It wont do you much help.
Rubber was not the imposter         1imposter remaining
If it has a force that block any projectiles does the force field block short weapon like a knife?
hey wait... Jupiter has no surface..so did he just create a giant floating island?
Oh god, let me guess, next we hear that Uranus is actually inhabited by a universal destroying eldritch god from the likes of psychology.
What if scp 682 was bringed to 2399?
send 343 to jupit6er because this creature could literally go wherever it wants TO IN AN INSTANT.
Wasting resources is a means to destroy the undestroyable Destroyer it's better to just go ahead and make preparations for the inevitable destruction instead of fighting it a contingency of removing a large enough population of humans plants animals and other needed materials reconstitute the planet would be more advisable
c a i n
this is cash money
PLS DO SCP 007
The solution is simple. Just offer Dr. Bright a trade. If he deals with SCP 2399 the foundation either lets him remove one rule from his list or they cant make any new rules for 3 weeks.   In actuality why not test weapons refined by SCP 914 against the destroyer? I believe they created a firearms that disintegrated things with a beam. Seems a lot more feasible way to get weapons while wait for tech to catch up
Oh this one must be very intense. Pls do 131 next
bruh you have scp 001 and 343 just those two alone could wipe that thing easily
Why when I seen the thumbnail it reminded me of Iron Man?
Again, the only thing that would cause these SCP's to inflict damage to us are the very things God finds detestable. The very things I struggle with are the very things we all struggle with most. Ego Pride Boastfullness(especially that) Insecurity Unrightous regret(the regret of hating the things of others that should be hated, including what was listed)
“2399 could destroy the world by itself!” 2317: Am I a joke to you?
If i were one of the O-5 Council members i would do this:Yeet abunch of moons at it until its dead
You always know it’s going to be a good day when rubber makes a new upload.
Why don't we send in the Floridaman. Floridaman can do anything.
btw that so cool that scp-2399 look like in a game somewhere ;-;
What if they were to try to get inside find out what the power sources possibly take some since it’s infinite and use it to create an EMP
4:50 TheRubber was the Imposter.
i know what to do call the god scp
There’s another giant squid/ship SCP that has origins from the red spot in Jupiter
Jupiter: *NO ONE HARMS EARTH CHAN!*
What if there is a sheld activation so that happens mabye tyr going to the back of it and turning that off if there is one
This scp is in scp animated so is it only malfunctioning destroyer or is it also the last man
lmao history class sucks this is better
Too violent
I DARE YOU GO TO SCP BASE RN :()
ooo
3:36 pokemon battle
Samus if she was an scp. Well the colors are similar.
I don’t want it to kill us and destroy earth
Or build a relly big rocket ship and put all of the dangerous scp in the rocket
This is my favourite SCP thank you so much!
Better than roblox
Its possible they would be able to neutralize 2399 with another SCP, tho the chances of such a thing working are minimum. The Deer as an example would potentially be able to fully destroy 2399, but who cant say the next target after 2399 would be humanity
What about Scp 179 ? Could she stop it ?
Theoretically couldn't we just try and send a signal to it to destroy itself?
I dont know whos better ruber or Dr.Bob let me know in the chat🙃🤔
The rubber protects us.....
Idea that the foundation couldve done: make a message and use there language to send it to the scp and tell it to go to the longest place away from its home galaxy so it cant get messages and then if it hopefully complies we win
I am scared i dont wanna die zD
3:06 what are you doing their step metal
4:51 [TheRubber was not the imposter]
Soooooo Its Located in the Red Storm.
more safe classes please
yay!!!!!
Oooh new scp
4:50 there is an among us noise
Thank you for doing this SCP!
I mean if it got damaged from an impact against the moon of Jupiter, couldn't a nuke wipe it out? As a nuke, at the start, is a ball of plasma hotter than the sun, pretty sure it'd clear it out. Dunno much about their attempts though, maybe they tried it out? Just correct me if I said anything wrong.
Imagine if that scp was sent by an Alien foundation, trying to contain us before we become a Keter threat to them. 😂
I wish this my phone or tablet because it can repair itself has drones and unlimited power!
guess we'll find out if all scp things are real or not  in 25 years..
at this point...rubber is an scp in itself(scp-6000 the cameraman\narrator)
we should give it our best . better overkill rather than underkill.
Even if the SCP foundation is real, we would've been dead already...
i hope there is a part 2 of this
Why don’t the foundation search for the pieces to prevent them getting found by the drones the more pieces located by foundation the better
I am absolutely loving this series. Makes learning SCPs so much easier and cool. I'd highly suggest looking into SCP-919 also known as, "the needy mirror". I find this SCP to be very interesting because of the incidents it caused. Making people starve or dehydrate to death in front of it. And another where a security personnel was about to kill other personnel just to stay in front of SCP-919
I just love the fact that certain SCPs took inspiration from real life, like this for example. This SCP is based on the real-life fact that Jupiter constantly shields us from asteroids that could have potentially landed here on Earth.
What if SCP 2399 finished repairing itself and ask the SCP people to go away
White Steven of Minecraft xd
"One gigantic EMP powered by God-knows-what" I mean the answer is there, just talk to SCP God.
Please do a video on scp 3001
Hey The Rubber, I've got an scp suggestion, do the scp 783, the crooked man, a Keter class scp... It dislocates someone's bones very weirdly, crooked or idk, but yeah this scp is disturbing. For me
Throw that lizard to it. Maybe, just maybe, it will break through those shield by playing dead or something, and wreck it from inside.
"Destroyer #7538-21 has malfunctioned. Deploying repair drones to the Jovian Mass in the 4th homosapien Solar System. Electromagnetic barrier destroyed. Communication lost approximately ██ days ago."
You are in dream wake or iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii just wanna deleeete you channel
Might I mention that it looks different to what it looked like in your SCP-4217 video. Although I do think it's an improvement.
It's 9 pm here
I heard a doctor name jack bright has launched Jupiter's moon IO right at it.  I don't know how he did it.   SCP- 2399 has been reclassified as neutralized.  To jack bright. You rockstar
Can  you to take the parts away from scp-2399?
Y'all need to leave these SCP's alone and learn how to reconfigure your so called SCP 5000 that is the structure of many foundations we live in to help us restore emotional, psychological, and emotional balance. I. Know for a fact of God given understanding that SCP Foundations intention was to contain us within that larger crescent moon of the geometry I came to understand as satans hypnosis.  Again, y'all have got to get sheets of craZart wild lilac on the walls of SCP 401(living tree) I'm tired of it raping me, making me feel like cutting off my fingers
Could you do scp 2499
among us?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
SCP 156
“Is this one of Stark’s toys?”
Aliens are real... I guess cause this thing came from outer space
just capture a drone, put in c4 or something stronger, send it back to jupiter, explode and the job is done
*SCP-2399* Should be classified as *Apollyon* , Thats what i think. If it gets to earth, then its probably the end. that is the reason Imagine it completes before the *25 years* , it would be horrible for *EVERYBODY.* , So it needs to get classified as *Apollyon*
Tis scp ill go Brasil
Better no fall into that gas giant
Part 2 please!!!!!!!
You're😳
Nice
Tbh if i was the foundation i would just take the pieces and YEET them as far as possible
Why do we have to fear scp 2399 and try to kill it?! Why not figure out more about it if we can only talk to it?! (And by that I mean communicate to it)
Scp-2399: Exists SCP Foundation: How can we destroy it? Reality Benders: What are we? Chopped liver? *Turns into chopped liver.* NOT WHAT WE MEANT!
Scp 2399 looks like a Pokemon lol but what about scp 343 I bet he can help maybe
So glad Scp is not real
Doctor Bright somehow Just launch a júpiter moon in 2399
Plz make part 3 of scp 093 Red Sea creature
do scp 4158
I wonder how scary it would feel for the scp foundation like they know that the world could end at any moment atleast 5000 different times and we normal civilians don't even have a clue
4:32. "But unfortunately, this technology does not exist yet." Ahem, there's a little something called a E.M.P. After 7:45. Oh, well we failed.
It’s kinda hard to take this serious when there’s a little Marshmello guy poppin up every once in a while.
Just grab a imperial star destroyer, Boom problem solved :^)
Nothing can break it nor scratch it Water: I'm about to end this guy's whole carreer
You know what I’m down getting destroyed by red spacey ship sounds ✨SEXY✨
Ive been waiting for this my entire life....
Kann I please see scp 001
Cool scp love scp
Rubber was not an imposter I said RUBBER WAS AN IMPOSTER 4:18
Finally.... Someone make an animated video about this SCP... Love it 👍👍👍
When human see scp 2399 scp 2399 HOLA SOY DOAR
I thought Dr bright destroyed this thing by throwing IO at it
Just use scp-343 on SCP-2399
Well now we know that there are alians.
These scps are actually making me disgusted
SCP foundation are full with magnigicent creatures and objects
This has to be the coolest depiction of the Destroyer
*4:50*  The Rubber was the imposter

This is pog
Can u jost get one peace of 2399 and put it too a safe pleace
I suggest SCP-3844 for a future video its a very underated skip
Qe cpuld use conetic bombartment rods
I'd say throw 682 at it, but apparently the Foundation isn't fond of that idea for most things.
Can you make a video about 179? It’s one of my favorites SCPs. Please...
Could the death star destroy it? It might but that's a waste of energy on just one thing
Why not put a F-ton of WMD's in scp-914 on the very fine setting and throw what ever comes out at it.
TheRubber was ejected
25 years you say? yea, from what i see, we will be dead before that
Can you make a video on SCP-000 and SPC-230
Just do SCP-1176 (Mellified Man) from SCP Unity, please!
hop on amog us
When the imposter sus 4:50
It looks like Samus if it forgot to transform into a ball
Send lasers at 2399 and send lasers at his drones at the same time either his drones will die cuz when he did the shield thing he can’t shoot or either he will die while trying to protect  his drones.
An Indian scp please
Dr Bright: So you know how SCP 2399 was damaged by a moon 05-council: yeah? Dr Bright: What if we chuck another moon at it? 05-Council: ...... that might work
fun fact: This is not real, dont be scared. scp foundation does not exist.
It's so dumb that they even didn't use the power of SCP like the children who can delete object's out of existance and a God who can teleport very dumb
Operation gigas was even worse of a failure as it didn't need a message now it knew it was compromised
What if 682 went to it and tryed to destroy it
U should do a face revel
Nice animation! I was expecting something about "The last man" but it's great anyways!
Can you do SCP 4975. It's an interesting specimen...if you call it one.
are you the same narrator from IFLAD?
Don't worry guys, Dr. Bright threw a moon at it so we're alright
It's was amazing rubber good job.
when the scp foundation forgets about god...
How do they have a drone there? Jupiter is 43 light minutes away from Earth...
Whar if you send the hard to kill reptile to destroy that behemoth of a ship but then again it might cause a worse enemy that could end the whole galaxy and no one wants that
The whole foundation is like doing all this work and this rubber guy is telling us encounters and stories about these scps... Like bruhhhh
Quick check if the scp is there with a telescope if it is there All the other scps are also true
looks like some Yugioh card
Can you please do scp-001
This is my favourite SCP
Lowkey want that scp to wipe out that dimensions human race
Vid
Rubber please make SC p not good enough please please please
Wait... If 343 is God... And he is perfectly content with helping us... Why don't they ask him to help?
Um you can actually make an emp out of basic things like T.Vs, Phones, computers, tablets anything that has electricity in general you can use to make an EMP.
hi
*throw the lizard at it*
Hi
i belive you need a big stupid gun from FTD
how about siren head/scp-6789
I still dont know which log is canon but nonetheless a good coverage
I love how fast these videos are coming out. Great job!
Hi plz explain the monk scp
makes scp 001 "when the days break"
*yee*
What if it was designed to protect the earth and are actually unknowingly destroying the object designed to actually protect?
They should use that little sun that they have contained, and somehow launch it to this thing.
I have a weird question not about the video. Since yesterday I haven't been able to see all of the videos in a playlist and can't add videos to some playlists. Is anyone else having a similar problem?
Is this real im really scared
I don't mind having friend . Because it's impossible for us to learn their language there more likely100 language in earth . How many there at the galaxy
Why don't we send drones to find the pieces first?😂 I know it's not real but would us taking the parts make it no longer a threat! LOL!
I was waiting for this and im impressed with it
I'm surprised how quickly he has gained in subs and view counts, I've watched him from day 1 because of an ad he put on and I'm glad I found this in the beginning and hope you strive more
part 2 plz also they could used different scps because it sheild can block long range projectiles but what if you put 173 or the large corocdile that can adapt there because it is invulurable to dasmage too
I imagine what is really out there that we have no idea about. I’d love to see it. And work for the places that deal with them.
Good job on this scp the rubber
I guess I won't live over 78
The best scp
the SCP are amoung us
4:51 TheRubber is not imposter
Here before an hour
Do 1396 its a nice continuation to this scp
The world must Know about the scp! NOW! if you still keep secrets and use amnestics! it will lead to a civil war and the scps and chaos will destroy all!!! WE NEED THE TRUTH!!! SO WE can work together and end this WAR!!!!
Could you make an SCP-2006 Video please
That kind of attack would blow up jupitar probably not destroy the scp and kill earth from the flying giant jupitar rocks
I HAVE A HYPOHESIS!!! That hypothesis is that the Creators of SCP-2399 want to destroy any life that is not themselves, and that is why we have not contacted any aliens! Humanity just had just enough luck that 2399 collided with Io, but that only postpones our demise...
SCP-2427-3 pleas is a robot thet kill s people and make intresthing sounds i whant to know more obout it, is varry agresive.
Nukes maybe?
Part 2 !?!?!?!?!?
Please do a video about scp-001(the broken god) and its relation with scp-2399
Elon musk space station in a nutshell
SCP-2399 kinda give regi vibes
REEEEEEE
Bruh
Scp: *exist* The foundation: I can arrest you?
Can u do scp 024-The Game Show of Death sometime soon... maybe. ( If the scps number is wrong I'm sorry.)
I rlly like the rubber why he Explain all of SCPS. Like;)
What about getting help from SCP's?
Hey rubber can you do a part 2 of scp 173 because it looks different
Earth: OOF
Can you make video about SCP 1903
Just realized that TheRubber has hit 1 million sub congratulations (ik im very late)
Part Teo 2
FINALLY AN SCP EXPLAINED THAT THAT HAS NOT BEEN EXPLAINED 5 TIMES ON YOUTUBE
ikr lmao
is this fake right?
Scp 2521
Imagine if SCP was real, we only know about it because a few agents decided to spill it
You'd think they can just fill the exit that let's the drones exit through with sand or concrete cuz they dont seem too strong and they cant really burn through concrete
Relly like the rubber just kick out the space ship like Among us XD
Can you do the broken machine god 001
The last man
Eh just throw a class D at it.
It seems like every time I wake up and you upload each time
Face revel
They couldve used the claw
Maybe they can make a barrier so strong that 2399 can't escape it.
Sounds like they need a reality bender to deal with it. Whats God doing?
I want to see scp 6789
So this is why Kim Jun un is testing nukes
Can't we send scp 682 with 343 and 001
Wait Jupiter has a solid surface?
While watching this, I can across (in my Youtube wall) the saying by Gandalf "All we have to do is decide what to do with the time that is given to us".   COSMIC !!!
He says that there is false information to suppress the information about the SCP but here we are getting knowledge about it
EEEIII 2399
Ur uncle at the dinner table be like:
It's times like these that make me wonder why they don't just use one of the reality benders.
The only way to defeat an anomaly like this is with a greater anomaly. Putting nukes, EMPs, and deadly scps through 914 on very fine, and then launching it all at this scp may do the trick. If necessary, put the EMPs through very fine multiple times, and take the entirety of these and combine them into one attack. If this too fails, there is a further solution that could work. Rather than a bomb, it would be a probe with 2966 on board. It would be designed to pull as much paper from 2966 as possible while close to the target. If successful, it could drain all energy from the target or at least from their shields, and then nuclear weapons could be used to finish off the rest. If this also fails, we put the entirety of 914 in space, shove 682 into it on very fine, and then shoot him at the object somehow. That’d be a last resort, but if we were going to die anyway, may as well go out with a bang.
Ive heard that a reptile has been somehow launched into it
4:51  "Rubber was The Imposter"
That's bull when have emps emp grenades and I'm pretty sure we have laser rifles that can penetrate even the strongest of tanks on this earth
The rubber: this object its hidden to the public so no one sees it. Also the rubber: so he lives here he dose this and he is made of this
TheRubber Official Discord when???
Welp, good luck coming gen 👍😁
in less than a hour lets go
I still believe all it took to destroy that thing was letting Dr Bright yeet a fucking moon at it, like how did he even achieve that, and why are we still pretending it's there
Just use scp 2501 the safe scp called the claw to hold it in place long enough for scp 001 proposal - the children to completely erase it with their annihilation capabilities. The advance aliens 👾 in triangulum galaxy would think twice about sending more. Get a powerful reality bender  either scp 343 or the little girl to create an emp machine with say free energy ⚡.
I would shoot 096 at it
Instead of calling it that destroyer I would call it the mass on Jupiter
What are some scp’s they can safely transport to Jupiter to destroy it
Hey ngl, it would be cool to be a part of an XK-Class End of the world scenario.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Ok so lemme get this straight. SCP 2399 has some kind of shield that flawlessly protects it from any launched projectiles or electromagnetic pulse, but it collided with Jupiter's moon and took damage..? So does it mean it doesn't view planets/asteroids that have drifted into its path as a potential threat?  Time to yeet the moon towards 2399 I guess
“That’s the thing from fortnite” —Some Random Fortnite kid 2021
25 years until destruction wooooooo
Why dont they just take the parts so it cant repair? Or better yet study these parts
damn it it was real it would have already been repaired 5 years ago

If smacking a moon can damage it couldn't the foundation use gravity fields to slap it over and over with jupiters moons?
hi
Amazing content keep it up!! But, I thought this was apollyon, not Keter Also can we get an apollyon SCP plz, there's a serious lack of apollyon SCP videos
I like your vids but I think The Volgun delivered this particular SCP better. His delivery made you feel tense and scared about this SCP as you reach the moment when you slowly realise this SCP will destroy Earth sooner or later and there is nothing you can do.
Better idea is to push one of the moons to the scp but engry use for that is ALOT
Yay my fan art got picked im lumbardhi
E
5:34 imagine being pat on the head by the rubber
Hello everybody .. I’m the wubber   Sad dab*
Scp Foundation sees planet killer: Sleep It might be able to destroy 682: Woke 682 not dead: *confused screaming*
Can u talk about scp 2006 plz?
I actually got an ad for book set of SCP files. Coincidence? I think not. My phone must be an SCP if its trying to sell its own merch.
Can you do SCP-805, its a very interesting creature and I love horses
Earth: Exist       Random Anomalies: *So Anyway imma try and destroy em*
This one is quite sad because everything seems so futile & hopeless.
The only thing i hate about your videos is that they end in a very exciting moment for no reason
this mans job is to dox all the scp
I love that they used an among us sound
In the future all people in earth will go to mars
Please do SCP 956
and there is dr.bright  launching a  jupiter moon into scp-2399 destroying that scp
What if scp 682 and scp 2399 had a battle?
4:50 Ruben was not an Imposter            2 Imposters Remain
wow im early
70's we have a real star wars here in space
Wow
was that a among us refernce
New Subscriber  Love Ur Content Love From India ❤️

Wasnt a ultra beast based off of this
Io, with a small o. It is pronounced together ok.
What SCP was the bell that brings entities from CB? I’d like to see that one.
Epic
1996 was it?   25 years later and the earth will be an apocalips    WAT 1996 + 25 = 2021
my Mind : why not make a Gigantic Earth  made out of anything and just control a space ship like its going back to Earth to think its real  me : but that would be impossible Because we don't have space on land to launch the mini Earth to space, plus we would run out of Resource before half way of the mini earth   i guess my story of explaining nonsense
didn't dr bright somehow lunch one of jupiters moon at it?
My guess on who was the one sending 2399 to possibly simply kill us, is Scp 1000, the Big foot  Imagine this, Some of the 1000 escaped from the human killing spree and left into space, they might have the technology to space travel after all, after some travel, they settled on a planet and planned to revenge against human, by sending SCP 2399 to us, 2399 seems like something 1000 would build so why not, i noticed I was almost the only one who thought of this, I can’t found this idea in fan fiction, no fan art, nothing, so imma do it here, honestly, putting 1000 and 2399 together really feels interesting thinking about it, anyone agree?
Means it's not keter it's thurmil
Didn't it get murked by dr. Bright?
Indestructible? But it’s broken rn
it looks like a pitcher plant :/
is this tying in with that weird octopus ship.
I have a theory that 2399 and 4217 have a connection.
Knew Something with the red spot was sus.Red's always sus
2:00 well we got em
Who do u think is the strongest scp and can u make a vid bout it
I just wonder, wouldn't the gate guardian evaporate any projectiles 2399 fires and 2399 itself anyways?
Why not toss a planet or moon at it
I want to see scp 3182
Do SCP-5999!!!
Why dont call SCP 343 ?
Lets all just thank dr bright for destroying scp-2399
It looks like a ship
how about SCP-686? go on i dare you
*I dont have anything to say OOF*
I don't think jupiter has land on it
I heard this TheRubber TheRubber TheRubber and I get pinned ???
Oh so THATS what happened to my phone.
TheRubber was ejected. 0 impostors remaining. 4:50
Here's a stupid thought, why not use SCP-063 on it? Since SCP-2399 has never actually engaged in direct combat, only acting in retaliation of attacks, SCP-063 might do the trick since it looks non-lethal.
Im scared :'( God help us were sorry please  help us #God#saveus#scared#goodbyelife#humanityisgoingtodie#shaking#SENDNOW
Didn't doctor bright throw a moon at scp2399
for all we know this object could be real
No need to worry. Dr Bright is half way through space.
Ok i died.
SCP-000
The fact that I have online classes now
Bruh. You are telling me, there is an SCP Foundation outpost in the jovian system ?
This can't be real because if wete it's said that any explosion at Jupiter will make it a second star
Hey rubber next SCP could you do SCP 001 when day breaks
Keep up the good work
The destroyer is gone  Dr bright threw a moon at it
Coved 19
So They roughly have 44 yeare left, damn.
Do SCP 140 pls
I enjoy how you used the Among Us text beep.
Ok, but can we yeet the big lizard at it
SCP Fundation : The SCP fundation wont give any public messages about the SCP Rubber : Gives all information to the public
Everbody gangsta untill a Nazi squid starts shooting boats in the name of Scp 2399
Doesn't scp-2399 looks like 'celesteela' from pokemon sun & moon 🤨
4:52 TheRubber was not the Impostor
It's always interesting to see how everyone draw or see this particular scp
wait...if there is scp info that should not be seen...have we been watching scp info that can get us terminated and therubber arrested under the foundations custody?
1 hour, i was sleeping
My knowledge on SCP: Big brain My knowledge on Algebra: Smort
ياخي ممكن تسوي ترجمة عربية
SCP 2399:You cant defeat me. SCP FOUNDATION:I know but he can. *SCP 096 screams.
Looks like something from wall E
Imagine being the rubber cringe
When I look at 2399's look I was like " WHOA "
I think you should make a video on scp 0001 because it is related to the Bible and i think it’s quite interesting 🧐
The gate guardian plz next
just yeet scp at it
one solution is to locate and steal the parts especially the important parts   and move them elsewhere
...
Hers the list  Detective void is serpent hand  Dr.bob is foundation  The rubber is foundation  SCP exposed is ex-foundation  Scp overload is foundation???
Finally  The seventh regi
Things aren't that bad. We still have good scps' like 990 and 343 to help us out.
If it could get hurt then we can destroy it
Jupiter
do the scarlet king (one of the scp's people think should be scp-001)
rubber u know that the scp foundation doesnt exist
Can you make a siren video? (Ik he isn’t an scp)
"to fast" Nut
HMMMMMMMMM. INTERESTING
I seen that you can use that red spot to destroy earth.
Maybe it was sent by scp-1332-A when they got the information of earth's location
Why does the photo look like the avatar version 2
Circus of the disquieting please 🤞😘
This is one of my favorites.
Okie
SCP-2399 **exist**   Dr. Bright: ...and i tooked that personally
So will that scp 2399 hit earth or not
Make a giant lazer beam maybe that will destroy scp-2399
Dude I know that the great red spot is a storm now u tell that its a Godman alien robot!?!?! I mean I believe in scp cause iv'e seen one when I was 6. But still..... BBBBBRRRUUUHHH....
just tell it to (stop)
This man making an among us reference made my day.
Push it further into jupiter so that Jupiter's gravity rippes it apart
If a moon can heavily damage it to the point where it takes decades to repair itself, then an emp and nukes should destroy it. I mean a moon could wipe out civilization but they have enough nukes to wipe out civilization a thousand times over so it certainly should destroy it. A moon does a lot of damage but that many nukes does a lot more.
What
This is like the most dangerous scp just like the scarlet king
*when spc are going to make books about the spcs*
I knew the great red spot was sus
Plot twist: this was part two of SCP 4217.
Scp 2399 - u can't destroy me scp foundation  Scp foundation- we know but they can.  Points at Jupiter n io
Didn't Dr.Bright YEET a moon into it?
why dont the slam it with a moon
Hi people, I have a SCP idea but don't know how to submit it. Is it possible to submit in phone?
Wlooooooowwwksei
I was doing homework but this was more important
also how long that thing needed reaparing and whou built it :o
Just saying, let's throw 682 at it  Just cuz
Launch 682 at it. Even if he can't destroy it. He could do us a favor and toss it into another star system. With any luck we will have developed weapons powerful enough to destroy it by the time it comes back. 😛
Wow
Day by day SCP became more hard to believe they are just theories.
Humanity will end 😯😯😢😭
SCP - 2399 What??
Throw a Moon on it   Just ask Dr. Bright
Weight does it kind of looks like Ben 10 alien 👽😂
Wait so the scp foundation can go to the earth in sevral other universes but they cant go to jupiter
What if the foundation take the part of scp 2399 and use against it and it would contain it using the parts of its own boom humanity is now in the future
Ever tried recovering the pieces of it first before the drones do
the yt generated cc are all outta wack ("worth it in your pretty worth enough is it your pretty..." "halloween candy snowden please use her with advanced anti..." etc.)
I can’t stop thinking about War Robots. This looks like an Arthur creepypasta
Please do SCP-3700 next
4:51 That reference
cant they use the scp GOD to find out what to do?
How Jupiter gravity not bring the barrier into the  planet red spot
If this were real.. we would be dead. Becouse that note was made in 1996 so they said that in 25 years the earth would be inhialated soooo yeah..
2339- *Reaches 100%*  Also 2339- AuTo BOtS RoLl oUT!
My hopes of having a 999 video is deminishing. I don't mind.
Didn't tesla invent a weapon that could destroy the entire planet. Or was that weapon the one that could destroy the universe, I can't keep track of so many reality warping scp's
Scp foundation: "Finds new anomalous object" Also Scp: "Test it on that lizard and see if it dies"
i know what ia her weakness  weakmess: out of energy, no one will repair  weapons gigantic laser like star wars im not lying my deam tell that in 2009
I can learn more fr a vid than in an online class
The rubber: "Today we bring you a keter class scp..." Also the rubber: * Dancing happily*
:D thank you rubber
lmfao the thing can travel galaxies super fast but cant escape the gravity of a gas giant that is not possible if it has the power to travel galaxies then it can definitely escape the gravitational pull of a gas giant o wait i forgot it hit IO
4:52 why does rubber keep on getting voted out
Didn't SCP-343 say he created everything? Well ask him for help.
That thumbnail gives me Warframe vibes.        Probably because the creature looks like a Sentient.
SCP-2399: exists Dr Bright: YeET thE MoOn
first comment in 42 minutes
When is scp 999 is going to show up in this channel?
What a scary appolyon level scp
Is this really
Pls make a video about scp 1875 pls pls i subscribed you
So it can't be destroyed by our most powerful bombs yet a collision with a piece of space rock incapacitated it? Doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
Can u do scp 4975 "times up"
Jupiter thank you
THE DESTROYER!!!
Just put an emp type weapon inside scp 914 and we're good to go!
I hate distant school as we call it in finland so it is pretty fun to learn from you rubber!
now im thinking of an scp tahat contains and does what you do to it so that this would have another test
Do scp 354
What scps could destroy it? Besides the God like ones.
what if the foundation made a 1,000,000 gig watt laser on SCP-2399 it could damage to it.
It looks like the Ultra beast Celisteila (I hope I wrote that right) from Pokémon
Plot twist: This SCP is true and present on Jupiter and it would lead to and inevitable XK-Class Scenario
Day 1 of asking the Rubber to review SCP 1867
is it real ?  :(
i love uuu
Scp-1000  Cause i have been wonder about that thing for long time
I can wait to destroy it if I had infinite power to destroy that and we can live happily and after
I never understood what that scp is or what it do. Know I can understand this. Thanks <3
Can you do 002
Just send it to the Sun!
💥Good job on this one, Rubber!👍
You should do scp 191 cause I think it's interesting and I think you can point out some interesting facts on it
*All Autobots*       We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy  I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching, but You're too shy to say it Inside, we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it  And if you ask me how I'm feeling Don't tell me you're too blind to see  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  (Ooh, give you up) (Ooh, give you up) Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up) Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)  We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching, but You're too shy to say it Inside, we both know what's been going on We know the game and we're gonna play it  I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
“Oh no nothing we have can destroy or damage the robot” The multiple gods, reality benders, and other things that could remove it from existence the foundation has locked in a box somewhere don’t count I guess
This is actually an xk class end of the world scenario
Interesting
Woah epic robotic Scp :0
Is it connected to 4217?
"ok but can goky beat him"
Take his parts
Send it to another dimension I tell you what
Just drop IO on it
I watch your videos on the treadmill
I GOT an idea...use SCP-1000's bio wepons....if you got that, Then we can kill SCP-2399
Use scp 914 to upgrade your ships and weapons easy
Solution: Independence day. The drones seem capable of passing through the shield no problem. Capture a drone and if able rig it with nukes then when it passes through the shield, detonate
If only we have D4 Ray, it would have actually disable the shields and destroy the blasted thing at the same time
well you can ask scp god to protect you or scp  001 the gardyen will destroy scp 2399 becues he is proticting a portal sooo scp 2399 cant destroy the earth :)))))))))))))))))))
Who else listens to this instead of school?
SCP-2399 be lookin like evil celesteela
Do Eric's toy next
Are scp real
Why scp fundation didn't stole remaining parts of this scp?
am i the only one that thinks that 2399 looks as something  straight out of destiny 2?
You Should Do Scp 113!
Well still waiting for the *SCARLET KING* which is ofcourse a scp god/king
Looks my broken toy
War machine
scp foundation: omg we gonna die dr.bright: watch this *throws a full on planet on the thing*
Woohoo yay another video, I hate waiting but it's all worth it for these videos
epic
SOO COOOOL
hey rubber! your probably not going to see this (much less heart or respond to it) But i’m Mr Squirrel! your my favourite creator! thanks so much for featuring me in the end card
Throw the lizard at it
Finally, something I never saw
AWW, 5:34 Rubber pating a child in the right corner
Guy's calm down, If this thing reactivates Optimus prime will come save us
Didn't Dr. Bright destroy it by launching a moon into it?
Why fundation dont use explodes inside of this SCP. They can use drones that looking for parts of this SCP, when drone enter the inside of 2399 or just barrier they can just destroy.
Scp videos are making my quarantine better
is this even real
Leaving a comment under rubbers video until he responds: day 44
Just send 173, 096, and 682 up there. free wins
When i was 4 i lived with my family in a small apartment on the 4 floor, when my parents were speaking with  our Neighbor i decided i would join the argument... Sudenly i feel into na elevator shaft And fell to the very bottom... No one knew how i survived that... But when i was in Hospital nobody exept for me was in the room... I woke up in the middle of the night because i heard wierd cracking noises... Sudenly the door opend... There was na some kind of an old man wearing a Fedora And a rain coat... I taught Its an doctor heading home checking on me before He goes home, And because i was a stupid child i pretended that i was sleeping... Then He said somethin i Will never forget "Felix please come back"... The He dissapierd... When i was older like 12 i recalled the incident, turns out the Hospital was build by some Guy named Ron Holler And He had a Son named Felix... That really gives me the creeps
In theory, wouldn't the SCP known as "Clockworks" be able to create a wepon that is powerful enough to destroy 2399. Though that could end up being a bad idea as it could be more dangerous than SCP 2399.
Love that part at 4.51 when there is the among us eject animation
Any ideas on what that last command was?
Pogchamp
I always forget about you until you upload a video, good job anyway.
Make a movie about factory porn scp
i mean it could also just be some scared aliens passing by and crashing by accident
İsnt jupiter is a super big gas Ball? How there is land in jupiter if its a big gas Ball?
If you don't mind destroying Jupiter, just use that SCP that is the sound that explodes molecules and play it on Jupiter.
Seek counseling with God(The SCP). He may know.
34 minutes past and 40k views already wow
Imagine if they know how to watch youtube
Does he respond tho?
in the end you find out that the ship is a guardian and wanted to protect earth but because of all the attacks from earth it decides that it will not help us and attacks us. jus another story of how we shoot first and ask questions later
in early again!
Whats the backround music any 1 know?
Do scp 9
2399: YES THERE IS EARTH! ALL I GOT TO DO IS GET THERE AN-  (slams into IO)  2399: Augh... what the heck?..  Jupiter: COME OVER HERE!!!!!!!!  2399: HOLY SH-AAAAAAA!!!!!
To the few that see this. May your dreams come true and may your life be successful. I shall keep you in my prayers.
Hi
SCP 008
why dont they try to kill it with i dont know god the girl that can change images heck even idk 079
Glad it's Nót real 😁
Do part 2
Finally! One of the most interesting SCP's of all time!
The SCP is like Bill Cipher
Im not sure if you already know this... But... Jupiter is a gas planet without solid surface to stand on...
Why don't they use another SCP to destroy this one? With so many anomalies, at least one should be able to get rid of this.
SCP 169 The Leviathan please..
Didn't the man himself Dr.Bright destroy it by crashing a moon into it?
The classification of this scp is wrong it should be classified as Euclid
Perfect
Congrats on 1.24 million  subs!
all those messages: Alien: hey where r u?✅✅ alien: dude u there?✅✅ alien: bro u literally gonna left me in seen?✅✅ alien: bro u mad because I didn't wanna buy u the new gears 17.0✅✅ (Edit: 121 LIKES IN 35 MINUTES THAT'S CRAZY, THANKS Y'ALL)
A reaper lol
Make the part 2 of tabboo
Jupiter is always saving our asses.  Thank you jupiter^^ <3
We need apollyon classes rubber
Why not try shooting it with the nerfing gun?
Mabey if we could make more tech and robots and cyborgs we will win
Could you not try and send a message to 2399 in the language decoded from the intercepted messages telling it to self destruct or something similar? Or is there something explained about that that would not work, presumably I'd guess the risk it would not believe the message to be genuine and not be tricked?
SCP 2399 will never be complete as long as we keep SCP 4217 in very high containment since the destroyer  won't launch its attack until 100 percent completion
Just yeet the lizard up there
I <3 ur vids The rubber
hm
Just yeet the old man over to Jupiter. That is 2 problems solved.
Oh this is about to be another ride of a lifetime
0:29 that picture remind me that meme about a boner rising smashing the guy's face while he is on the computer.
earth:lalala scp-2399:HAHA I AN GONNA KI- IO and jupiter:we are gonna stop you right there sir
When comes scp 093 part 3
Haven't they tried hacking into scp-2399?
I LOVE ALIENS. :DDD
nice
I’m a simple creature: I see the rubber, I click
I want to see a video tittled "if i were an scp" where you pick your numbers and Powers and looks
Its just shardy boi that stuck on there forever
Thx God this is not real
So death star in jupiter... wow...
*Theory:* I’m not the best when it comes to theory’s but if scp 2399 has a shield, why not put a bomb on one of those smaller ones, wait till it goes back into scp - 2399 and then blow it up from the inside..?
Rubber won’t pin this L
Looks like samus
Woah
Wait hold up, Jupiter don’t got a rocky surface dude. So the scp would sink into the planet and get crushed by the intense pressure. Basically Jupiter is a gas giant.
I'm trying to figure out why scp-4217 knows scp-2399? (Edit) I got the numbers wrong.
Didn’t dr. Bright destroy Scp 2399 by powering a cannon with one of Jupiter’s moons?
2399 got damaged by io, why not use io to terminate it
You have done soo much work
meow
If SCPs were real, we would definitely get more attention from aliens
40000 in thirty minutes?!?! Dang
SCP 2399: *Heads to earth* Jupiter, The SCP foundation and god: *so you have chosen death*
My physical  school started 5 weeks ago
Couldn't they launch scp 096 at it or send them a image of scp 096
its easy just shove the lizard scp into a rocket and send him to Jupiter  killing two birds with one stone , mission accomplished your welcome
You can watch it yourself
:(((
Why the class is keter the right class is napolion and why just not removed by scp idk what scp is but it's scp like earth but it's just like copy of earth
EYYYY EARLY
Do not show in youtube
SCP-093 Part 3
Ok we have a dangurous SCP here that could scared the entire planet what should we do?" "But it on a highly accecable website for all to see?" "PERFECT"
I bet, they wanted to destroy earth, because of the amount of scp's there.
You have to watch indertale
we are the public that know this info
I’m the next video, can we learn about the Scarlet king, Please?
Keter ? More like apollyon
awesome video
I like robots
Pls make part two!
me reading the captions at the beginning WHAAA CANADIAN DRUG RESTURANT
Plz do the gate guardian
Imagine if it gets fixed, and starts moving towards Earth, and then hits Mars by accident.
I go to this video and see an ad of scp foundation books. I have truly ascended.
1:31 When you know Jupiter does Not have solid surface but rather denser and denser atmosphere turned into liquid but don't want to be attacked by community, who doesn't know it or doesn't care about it.
I mean, it could just be coming to earth to give us a pretty cool laser show
4:50 "Therubber was not an imposter"
SCP-2399 drones can roam and get close to it freely. Maybe "abducting" one and studying it will tell us about how it gets through the barrier surrounding SCP-2399. Perhaps it emits a signal or even uses pheromones to know each other, I don't know this is the SCP universe. But what I know is that we shall *Secure, Contain and Protect.*
Assuming it has some sort of video equipment , couldn't you show it a picture of 096. Scp-096 would then attack possible creators of the destroyer if they are viewing the footage the destroyer is sending
I wish people believed this and not that vaccines cause autism and the earth is flat
Nani can you make scp zombie I forget the Name oof lol
Dude I thought vilgax died why is his shit still laying around
Scp 001
Whats more scary is that this could be real Not The same excectly but simular
Dude this is looks so different like iron man!
Fun fact : this scp has been neutralized by dr.bright by firing Jupiter's moon IO to scp 2399

"2399 is currently indestructible." The foundation: send in the lizard
The EMP may be able to be powered by some SCP.
MUTO doesn't exist in scp tho If it does,the male's emp blasts can just deactivate the thing in seconds (Well it showed only 1% of it's power in the movie)
i love ur channel, i como from the spanish comunity
Stick the lizard in a rocket and shot it at it.
Talk about the red sea object, you still have to do part 3
I love these scp vids
Send it to another dimension via a scp.

SCP files:are a secret that shouldn't be known by normal people.  Rubber:Oh no! Anyway
Can't they use other Scp?
Uploaded 25minutes ago
My profile felt like I'm a SCP Super Ball
Sorry late I was notified randomly when I logged in on yt it didn't notify while I was scrolling through dream fan arts why youtube?! Y?!
Hi rubber can you make 999 he one te cute in SCP Foundation
Me 13: ye next 25 years I will watch part 3 Probably you: I'm old to do that  Me: remember u said there will be part 2? You: fine, this last episode for yall that love me T u T
the new among us map be lookin kind cool
Why does this man have to always upload when I’m doing my homework, like come on man I have a future to think about
Why not just keep throwing bombs and nukes cause I think it can't move with shield on
Since ramming into a moon damaged it, how about pushing one of jupiters moon into jupiters orbit to try to crush that thing
If the asteroid doesn’t hit earth in 2029 that means it hit 2399
Why don't the foundation collect it's parts themselves? So it can't fully repair itself... That would make sense.
I love SCP Foundation Every scp is interesting and creatively written
Its so nice seeing hpw the scp foundation wants to protect us
why do i love astronaut rubber
Could they use the quartz crystal? It might transform Jupiter but it’d destroy the thing. (Before idiots go *oH, YoU* IdIOt, _iTS NoT ReaLL_ I know it’s not, I’m just saying, they could defeat it in the canonic scp universe)
4:51 TheRubber was not an Impostor.
I think SCP 3499 is the solution
I love the original article, but even more I like the use of that object in SCP-001 about the Broken God.
Nevermind i am stupid it was a Jupiter moon
i wwas waiting for a new vid thx man
I love your vids
Hey Rubber, Please make a video the connection between SCP 2399 and SCP 4217, because in SCP 4217's video shows that SCP 4217 knows SCP 2399
Rubber can you Do scp 4975 and scp 4666
bro its so easy to defeat like why not just throw that one crystal scp at it and turn it into a crystal
We're gonna die after 25 years waaaaaaaaaaaaa😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Also do you know some scp from site 13?
More content on your other channel pleeeaase
This early in the morning your lucky I have a bad sleep scheduale
What if scp 2399 hit Cain? Cain : Ima  use my uno  reverse card
That 1 person : Well f
Not even 30 minutes and there are already 4.4 thousand likes, amazing!
Scp professor:*smokes cigar* "Let's send that fucking lizard up there"
If you know, you know.  *The Rubber was Not The Imposter*
how about scp-686 im more interested in its origin of where it came from.
The design of SCP 2399 is different from the the SCP 4217 video
FINALLY YOU MADE MY FAVOURITE SCP TYSM
NEW VID LETS GOOOOO
I don't they use some scps for the destruction like using the red sea object like make a huge mirror connected to the red reality that consumes Jupiter
SCP-2399: I was only on vacation when I had this accident, why are you so mad at me?
How about scp 589
please do 966
If you really want to destroy it then why don’t you shoot at it as it’s powering down at shields to fire at you
Whats the middle scp at 5:55 i know the rest
FINALLY YOU MADE MY FAVOURITE SCP TYSM
Do SCP-008 next please
Nice!
Just send me there
so they discovered starcraft
What if you power the emp with an scp that is known for infinite power
You cant*
What's the different order that was being transmitted since 1996?
If youcnat Hurt it.. And its damged heavily...... What managed to Hurt it so badly???
That scp looks fascinating and it’s cool🤔
Here is my idea foundation keeps SCP''s in its containment from SAFE to EUCLID to KETER: if the foundation could finde a SCP that could help them for a instance SCP-2848 or SCP-001 or SCP-343 then one of them or all or ect. Could defeat or weaken SCP-2399 or use a reality bending SCP to bend the time around SCP-2399 thats how it would work maybe...😐😁
Early squad
Why not just throw another scp at it and get it over with
*Destiny 2 theme intensifies*
Scp 2399 look like a being from subnautica
If i can remember the contain the bismarck video it was talking about this
Dr.Bright's solution : throwing 682 at 2399
30 mins more than 1k
This is guy is better explaining then my math teacher
So is the information that we know about the scps leak from the foundation?
Yup
I am the 1,044th comment.
Jupiter's my man
Now we have weapons to destroy the thing but if you press the nuke by accident maybe we'll all. Stupids
How about you make a video about SCP-001 The Broken God. It's kinda related to SCP-2399
can u pls poste p2 of that dimension of some dr and a rabbit  who swithed personalty i relly like the scp and whant to wath the next part
Another cool SCP
Throw the lizard at it
I bet if that thing call 2399 are done repaired, let's just say we're doomed.
Eating breakfast and watching TheRubber is what I call a perfect morning.
What happens if someone goes inside the force field with a bomb and then put it inside it’s hole
Lost transformer in Jupiter's lower atmosphere: *exist* The Foundation: *And I contained that and putted that in my shelves full of toys*
5:34, it's like an introduction to SCP
SheepCP foundation you idiots Just track down one piece of 2399 and hold it captive then you can study the minibots that 2399 launches (since they're probably made with the same material) and destroy them if 2399 could step in it woulda blown up earth already soooooooooooooooo bye bye 2399
Fun fact based on the fact that it repairs 0.78% annually and that it's already at 59% it would reach 75% after 32 years
OH FUCK WE ALL ARE GONNA DIE FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
oh come on what about they just land on the other side of the mars that will be good and then get the drone 1 by 1 or just ask for help on the other scp site,military,nasa
If its defences are so good then how was it damaged by hitting a moon.
If this is true and everybody find it out you will be a so popular YT Rubber
SCP-2399: I fear no man But that thing....  Dr. Bright  ....It scares me.
Early yes ahahaah 22 minutes ago yes
Can i have a shout out in the next video please . Btw love your contant and yoir hard work keep it up.
please do the burning man it whould be very interesting :D
SCP-2399: Tries to destroy Earth Jupiter: "And I took that personally"
How to kill this? Elementary Throw  682 at it. Problem solved XD
If we could copy this thing *the scp* we would probably become super powerful
Does anyone realise that the red spot isn’t the scp but a tornado
Do with scp-007
1:42 How my connection downloads per 5 minutes.
5:58 I only don't know the middle one. Neck breaker/Peanut, and 001, the Angel that caused the Fountain's creation.
love the among us reference!
Fun fact: the rubber can be watched on a school chromes youtube
Properly some alien
people that disliked this video... why?
SCP-2399: hahaha, no one will breach my shield TUSK Act 4: bonjur
And I think it's that protector of jupiter
I would rather have TheRubber give me my business lectures
rubber: BARRIER ships  me: Minnellium Falcon!
To be fair, this is one of those stories that make SCP Cosmic horror-ish
The scp dead star
Just tell the goc
Wait do you mean we will die
Yesssss the next scp sovamaing love it and do you think you can find. A Greek god scp
I wonder if there is a way to syphen the devices power in order to fuel it's destruction or maby to shoot it's energy blasts back at it instead? Using redirection instead of direct action?
oh i emember this one.... honestly not really a fan of 2399. out of all SCP's it is the one that just makes me... sad. it has a sense of total hopelessness as nothing we've done has been able to stop it. how it is repairing itself. and hell we even have a short story of just what is going to happen to us when it does.
What was the too powerful one?
Hi rubbo
E
So you sain that the SCP is receiving messages from another galaxy so does that mean aliens do exist??
aliens: *is from me?*
Send scp343
"VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED"
Pls make an video over scp 001 pls
Is that the first being in Jupiter what
Rubber can you make the scp 023 ??
Im confused why a transformer toy would be in Jupiter's lower atmosphere.
I was waiting fo this SCP since you made the living Bismark. And I am thankfull for your your videos about SCPs. It is really enjoyable.
Love it, This made my day better
if they dont atack scp 2399 scp 2399 have no idea of humanity

Júpiter doesn’t have a surface, it’s a gas giant
One of the 1000 comments in 16 minutes.
Please do SCP-202
EARLY
Welp if we have only 25  years  it is good for we are already in a doom world
Welp jupiter is good & even better
2399 looks like some magical crystal from an RPG game 😂
😊
Yes
Do scp 941
4:58. Who noticed among us sources
jupiter is a gas giant, its made of gas there's no surface why does it look like ground
I just searched Scp 2399 and got the notification
A threat against humanity ? Launch the lizard !
Is beautiful
Plot twist the rubber is an scp himself
Been waiting for this Video for a long time, because I think this is one the most interesting SCP's.
can we appreciate how cute the rubber is whit all this outfits?
I believe that is a scp weapon that was want to destroy all of the monster in the SCP Foundation and save us all
Im always early to rubber 😎
Can you take an SCP from the Apollyon class next?
Scary noises!
I can't watch educational Vids when I'm bored I always check your channel and waiting for new one
well best method would be a trojan horse, either using dabree or a drone directly
bruh just send the shy guy at them. if that fails, deploy 999.
just beg scp 343 for help. hes a god isnt it? since he created the universe then he has the power to detroy it :P
A whole lot more things that Dr.Bright is not allowed to do at the Foundation:  289.Dr Bright is not allowed to tell anyone that Scp 096 just wants a hug.  290.Dr Bright can not make any jokes about Scp 076.Seriously,saying that Scp 076 has been “dis-able-d” will not end very well for you.  291.Dr Bright should not be allowed to say,”We are the Society of Creepy Perverts!!Fear us!!”While watching Scp 049 walk away.  292.Dr Bright should not be allowed to dance on tables.  293.Dr Bright can not use Scp 963 to take control of Scp 173.  294.Dr Bright should not be allowed to arrange a wedding and make Scp 076 and Scp 073 get married at the wedding.It was funny the first time,but Scp 076 decided to kill everyone who attended the wedding.  295.Dr Bright can not say yeet while Dr Clef is around.  296.Dr Bright is not allowed to sit in a corner and drink apple juice.  297.Dr Bright is not allowed to wear a dress and say,”I love apple juice!!!I will kill everyone who hates apple juice!!”On Wednesdays.  298:Dr Bright should not worship apple juice.Again.  299:Dr Bright should not say that Scp 682 is perfectly safe and should have belly rubs.  300.Dr Bright can not tell Mr.Deeds to dress up in a furry costume and scare the living daylights out of the O5 council.Again.  301.Dr Bright should not do fortine dances in front of Scp 682. 302.Dr Bright is not allowed to request “A cup of apple juice”From Scp 294.  303.The Foundation should not give Dr Bright: A dollhouse D class personnel to play ball with Scps that can dance A toddler Corpses
Hi
AYO MY FANART GOT IN
Can you please do scp 4666 next.
if you try scp 5000 "why" that would be so cool
This is awsome!
Destroy it with scp 2501
Hi rudder can you do my favorite SCP it is scp-1903 it is a female SCP monster that when you read the information your face will start to peel off and your hands will become black and sharp and your teeth will become black big and sharp and your face will become ugly and smart and you have to wear headband with fack animal ears and your feet with become big black and sharp
how about all the goc missions
HeyRubber i come from Indonesia and see how nice is your video i always waiting for your video event of that need 2 weeks or month i hope you can get 2milion subscribers 👍😀
15 minute squad?
Are these real someone tell me pleasssss
If it lives on jupiter far away from people why not just keep it there lol
"25 years" Me wait hang on it was heard in 1996 meaning it would come for us in the year 2021.......  WAI-
Oh wow I’m actually early
The funniest part of this SCP is the fact that has been completely neutralized by Dr.Bright when he yeeted (somehow) Io against it.
cube face lol!!!!1!11
YESSS SPACE SCP
face reveal?
Everybody gangsta till Jupiter starts getting to Earth
Your pronunciations are so weird. English not your first language, Rubber?
I can’t tell if it’s just the art design, or creative liberty or what not, maybe it’s the original article’s fault, but Jupiter has no solid ground, aside from maybe it’s core. It’s all gas.   Just a small nitpick I felt like making.
Why don't they use a reality warper to destroy it or something that can destroy things instantly
TheRubber Is A Fan Of Scp And Also Explainer of it    And No I don't live with him I live from Philippines
Hi Rubbo!
I'm early
14 minutes ago
I love that The Rubber and many other SCP youtubers know "Top Secret" Information
When the death machine is sus
"4:51" rubber was not the impostor
So, we're fucked.
mad props to ur animations ur work is awesome I hope one day these episodes get released on Netflix
not to be a downer but were all dead
among us rerence
love TheRubber videos
Yay only 12 minutes late!
Make an  arc program to Mars with human colneing SCP and wait if
Do scp811 next
My suggestion is SCP 4935. A twisted look into the far future after death no longer exists.
A genius way to explained the red dot on jupiter
Can you do SCP-832. I believe it's an abandoned amusement park that was responsible for an unusually large number of deaths
Yes new video
Cool
glad you dont strike channels like detective void
In 10 mins there are this many comments wow btw it was 791 for late people
late again that thing looks like a space ship!
What if you were to find a way to attach a bomb or emp to a drone and then when it gos back you emp or blow it from the inside.
Anamolous stuff: **exists** The foundation: and I took that personally
Teacher: The Red spot is a storm in Jupiter  Me who saw rubber's video: *I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you*
We gonna talk about gas?
if these things are real that will be so bad
Me as a astronaut at NASA: sees scp 2399 on the Juno spacecraft :scp 2399 drone KABOOM? :scp 2399 yes drone kaboom
Yeah
i guess that were all the nukes were
Maybe they could use scps to help us like Able and Cain
I only like this channel not other scp channels they explain worse not this one
Use scp 093
Hi
It will take 52.56 years to fully repair itself
yeheyy 15mins ago, but please the part 3, its been 3 months
Plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz I asked in the last 3 or4 vids plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz do a vid on scp 4666
Please make video on scp 001
Next scp 001
Yep, call in Bright
I'm early
You should do scp 513 also known as the cowbell
In 10 mins there are this many comments wow btw it was 791 for late people
Dr bright destroy it tho
Hey , I have a request if possible , can you make SCP 001 The gate guardian" ? anyway Great Video!
E
For anyone remotely curious, the actual plan is to launch the moon that it damaged itself on into it
I wish the rubber was my techer
Why does the ship look like Hoard primes ship from She-ra?
wait Jupiter is a gas giant made of gas so how do people destroy it the ship they are on have to have a rocket launcher eventually the ship will run out of fuel so the ship will fall in the deep space nowhere to be seen
Therubber is not the imposter 4:51
Dont worry lets just detonate a tsar bomba in its position                                                      - A really stupid foundation member
So SCP Foundation had in 1970's super lasers? God knows what do they have now....
Day 1: of telling the rubber to do a Dr wondertainment scp
Isn't this that one Bamboo pokemon?
This This has taken too long
early some way
Imagine going to online class (This is basically what peaple say on every video they watch)
Thanks Jupiter 🙏
I wonder if there's SCP with number 10 000 or 100 000 or 1 000 000? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Hmmm why does GOC is not doing their thing when it needed
big lego haha yes
What about  SCP-4975 SCP-2317 SCP-3970 SCP-2137

I love your channel
What Is Your Favorite SCP??? Text Below. Mine Is The Statue That Snaps Necks
Power it with 343, or some other electrical scp.
1.  2399 dosen't really sound.    Hostile to humans   2.  Shouldn't it be Euclid class
Could scp 343 not just stop it, seeing as he is god
pog
This is better than going to online classes
Pogggg
How about sending the shy guy there he is real powerful
Piz  niced part 2

so you are saying we will all die from 2399 ???
I think Earth will be fine,if the Destroyer doesn't move at light speed.
cam you make scp 999
Is this stuff really true??
How are scp writers so creative in writing an scp
Maybe you can just send scp-682 to a termination test or just fall him a rock on top of it because you say EMP, bombs, missile, is useless
Haha! I’m first!
U got 2 thousand likes in 8 fricking minutes, damn
Woohoo new video
Get. This. Comment. 5k. Likes.
Apollyon is a class for when SCPS are impossible to contain Thaumiel is a class for when you need to use another SCP to contain an SCP you should add these next time it’s possible =)
The command the SCP Foundation decoded from the aliens: /kill <earth>
Its red for sure
Do scp 052 plz
This man put an among meme on this- *give the man an award*
It looks like the INTERSTELLAR STOMPER......    U KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
Well, what about an orbital defense grid? Having large mass driver cannons in orbit?
SCP-2399: *Whatcha got there?*  Dr. Bright: *a moon*
Wish my teacher was  SCP 999
Malfunctioning sounds like my life goals
Hi
8 mminutes ago POG
Make video on scp-001

I’m just impressed on how TheRubber can stand on Jupiter when it’s made of gas
Next scp 2006
One of my fav scp

wooo 7min!1
Meanwhile in our reality Dr Bright: i'll yeet Jupiter's moon at 2399 SCP Foundation: wait wha- SCP 2399 has been terminated
what is the name of the music he uses?????
I like the Among us reference here🤣🤣
7 minutes = 650 comments
Scps want to destroy the world, but they still have a fandom
Do clef's proposal
This is what I am going to tell my dad the red spot is (he watches all the alien programmes)
The rubber present is like old default texture of minecraft in latest versions
Soo if they all got breached the end of the world would happen?
4:50 *TheRubber was not the imposter*
rubbers are smart
SCP-2399 would be good in a sci-fi drama
1:13 Me:is these things your babies? 2399:no actually  Me:SCP-2399 IS A FEMALE  2399:oh my god I’am gonno rip off your mouth
Wait, why jupiter has floor?
HOLY SH*T!! THANKS A LOT MR. RUBBER!! This SCP is one of the best in terms of terror and ignorance of outer space.
The Great Red Spot is an scp me with allergy to be sting and got stung  Wow finally a worthy opponent
Hello
Would love to see SCP-966!
That thing giving me nightmares
4:51 AMONG US  The rubber was not the imposter
Hold up , scp can attack by using our own made intelligence
*"How tf does the rubber get to space/that close AND act like it's all okay."*

Hello skedadudlers.

Bruh this thing hasent even been out for a day and already has over 5k views
Yey more scp tales :D
The rubber was not an imposter  (2 imposters remain)
This is the weirdest transformer I've Ever Seen
The rubber Indonesia
Im not first Nor will I be last But when I see TheRubber I click fast!  TheRubber talks of strange things Is TheRubber himself now an SCP?
So it isnt a giant mechanical worm...
I have a theory what if the scp foundation is real and these videos are them leaking information to prepare us in case of one of the SCPs escaping or being encountered in public and are also made to discourage the existence of these anomalies as a joke or fake and also have several fake scps to disregard it further as a joke or funny such as meme SCPs
I feel like SCP-2399 is gonna be mad after this video
waited countless days for this im so happy
Yes
Im kind of suprised the people who come here right before the video is made don't say first, i love you all
I just watched this video THEN GOT A AD ABOUT SOME GUY MAKING THE BEST SCP BOOK WTF

Just do SCP-1176 (Mellified Man) from SCP Unity, please!
Rubber: "false info is provided to prevent public exposure." Also Rubber: exposed almost all of the true info about 2399 to public.
