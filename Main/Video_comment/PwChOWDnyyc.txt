Got me like damn
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
Yall better peep this man one of the most intelligent youngings out rn
Peezy neva disappoints factz
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved. Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

https://youtu.be/Q9R.-yXXXwC8 Wisdom Follow Jesus Christ, he rose from the dead! Obey him before its too late. He is the only way to get to the Father John 14:6 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Hebrews 5:9 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts 2:38 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: Hebrews 12:14 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Proverbs 28:13.

Finally I been listening to the unreleased versions for to long‼️
This would be a good ft with jackboy
Today is a new day, a new start. 2021 is here and YOU are here for such a time as this. Please don't forget it.. If you don't  already know God has a plan for you and if you are open to it, this can dramatically change your life and circumstances. (Matthew 16:25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. ) I speak from experience that God can make all things new. It doesn't matter what we have done  or that we think we don't measure up, He will meet us where we are even in our lowest low. All that you have been through is not for nothing. YOU have a purpose , YOU have worth, YOU are a masterpiece created by God himself. For those going  through a difficult time please know trials produce strength, perseverance, wisdom, compassion for others, and experience. You are so much stronger than you know.  I am praying for each and everyone of you that God will send His angels to comfort you, surround you with His love and peace, help you through all that you are going through, and give you strength to endure this harsh world.  God sees all and one day all that is lost will be restored for His children  *(1 Corinthians 2:9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.)*  Please hang on and take things one day at a time) If you don't already know God in heaven sent His only begotten Son Jesus Christ  who died for you. To have a relationship with Jesus Christ it is as simple as praying and asking Him to forgive you of your wrongs and ask Him into your heart believing with sincerity. Then you can start a relationship ( please see the book The Holy Bible for more information ) To give your life to Jesus Christ here is a sample prayer: Dear Lord Father in Heaven I admit I am a sinner. I have done many things that don't please you. I have lived my life for myself only. I am sorry and I repent. I ask you to forgive me.  I believe that you died for me to save me. You did what I could not do for myself. I come to you now and ask you to take control of my life; I give it to you. From this day forward, help me to live every day for you in a way that pleases you. I love you Lord, and I thank you that I will spend eternity with you, In Jesus name I pray, amen........

Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen!!! Repent and turn from sin!

Ayyyyy you tha 🐐 goat
🙏❤ hey fam if u reading this, I want to remind you that God loves you and he has a wonderful plan for your life! 😁  God forbid If you died suddenly today, where do you think you would spend eternity??... If you are not sure, God wants to let you know that he loves you very much and that this is REAL LOVE — not that you loved God, but that he loved you FIRST by sending his Son Jesus to die for you to take away all of your sins that you would not perish but have everlasting LIFE!   Gods love for you cannot be measured, it has no boundaries and will look past all your faults. God saved me and set me free from a lifestyle of sin and addiction back a few years ago and my life has never been the same since. God can do the same for you if you allow him. "Behold, I’m standing at the door, knocking. If your heart is open to hear my voice and you open the door within, I will come in to you and feast with you, and you will feast with me." (Rev. 3:20) God wants a RELATIONSHIP with you! Its not too late! He loves you!  The bible says in Romans 6:23 that the  wages of Sin is DEATH! But the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour!! Romans 10:9 & 13 says that WHO EVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF JESUS AND BELIEVES IN THEIR HEART AND CONFESSES WITH THEIR MOUTH THAT HE IS LORD SHALL BE SAVED!!  Im going to say a prayer for you! Lord bless my friend and their family with a long and healthy life. Lord I pray you make yourself real to them like you did for me in Jesus name. Friend, If you would like to receive Jesus in your heart or rededicate your life to him, then right where you are say this with me with your heart and lips outloud...  Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart, forgive me of all my sins, wash me and cleanse me, set me free. I believe that Jesus died for me and that he is coming back again for me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit. Jesus make yourself real to me. I accept you today as my Lord and Saviour. I'm born again, all my sins are forgiven, I'm on my way to heaven because Jesus is in my heart!  Friend if you've said that prayer, I pray that from this day forward your life will never be the same. I tell you today that all your sins are forgiven, and always remeber dont run from God but run to him because God Loves You and has a plan for your life!  If you prayed with me, plz type amen! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=900241527115892&id=100013901589755  God bless!😁     Don't believe in God??  Proof in the links!...👇  From crackhouse/drug dealer in Wash DC to Pastor! Depressed to the point of having a 40 cal to the head, TO  COMPLETELY SET FREE AND DELIVERED BY THE POWER OF GOD! Listen to this POWERFUL salvation testimony! https://youtu.be/XjTvi_wjZ9U People being filled with the Power of the Holy Spirit At Outreach Event: https://youtu.be/MKWzHeDNpqI In the streets: https://youtu.be/GWqbf7Qv7Kg  Life After Death https://youtu.be/JYuY7Cm4KuQ https://youtu.be/GMAKSByShGU
