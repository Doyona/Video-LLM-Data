Who is here to check on sequan barkley before the super bowl 😅
The nfl is rigged for black QBs
Best Nose Tackle #97 Vs Best Center (guard) #52
Man i wonder what all these haters feel like now
Y’all want Toney back?!?! We’ll fill your vending machines for a year…
Hola
Jones better put work in this season he just got paid for 4 years
It’s just not necessary? The CHIEFS PLAYER started driving into dude when the play was over already. What terrible refing and terrible announcers who don’t sounds like they’re even watching. That’s embarrassing to have happen if you’re the NFL. Just the wrong and bad call
What a horrible game by the refs
11:15 was the worst taunting penalty I’ve ever seen
Giants are better than chiefs confirmed
McDaniels really hired Giants Defensive coordinator (who allows this kind of sloppy ass defense) because he credits him for us being held to 20 and not the slump we were in while still winning these games. I'm so glad the Raiders hired him lol
Did Blue see Red in Week 8 of the 2021 NFL season and was it between the New York Giants and the Kansas City Chiefs?
GO CHIEFS
The giants could’ve easily won this

Damn, wish I was there! 🏈💨
The more I see Daniel Jones play the more im seeing Eli Manning, and if this team develops around him, smoothly through the next few years I can see Superbowl runs soon. The giants have alot to  clean up. But theres alot of potential on this team if they can stay healthy, and make better decisions.
This game had to be painful to watch for both fanbases.
I'm from detroit but kc is my favorite team they can't stop seed
For Real KC are Cursed this year. The Truth Get Ready for Next Year.
There were 2 number 10
Как же опустился Канзас что еле-еле с трудом обыграли Нью йорк!))
KC is trash. Mahomes sucks. what a crap franchise
giants fail to succeed and chiefs are the joke of the league. can't protect the ball. won't make the playoffs. pathetic.
Saquon may turn out to be too fragile for the NFL, consistently....
A great win for the Referees against New York.
I'm a giants fan and i was shocked 😲 at this game.
Giants should have won
Is that frank gore senior?
Giants should've never been in that game jst shows how how bad the cheifs are
This team made it to the super bowl last year?
https://youtu.be/hAQVP3yrl7s
I live in the UK (England) I know the basic rules of NFL and like watching Kansas City. I've watched their highlights from week 3 and I've noticed that at some point in all the games that it's a 1score game. Is this the rough patch that Mahomes has to overcome to get back to form?
It's a rigged anyway just like the election our country is so fake
If you took football players today 40 years ago they would be a bunch of powder Puffs afraid to get hit . They are afraid they're going to break a f****** toenail why you play football and make millions upon millions of dollars go work for a f****** Whataburger
Chiefs won't be in the playoffs this year.
Refs are 🗑 and these taunting calls are 🗑
Seeing the Chiefs struggle like this make me feel like I’m living in an alternate universe
Barely scraping by a win versus the Giants? Playoffs ain’t looking so good
Kansas city barely beat the giants. They ainr beating green bay
That first interception by Mahomes look like Carson Wentz of Colts.  ThenDanny Dimes outdid him just looking like a rookie , despite being a 3 yr guy.  They have Gore,father time of running backs? You know it’s bad when Refs in highlights. .??
C’mon Chiefs just too blasé with the football, we need a complete training session on ball security
Barely beating the Giants cant be considered a win lol
Mahomes with an inflated contract makes him the be-all-end-all QB. Hunt is the X factor.  Lesson learned. Never invest too much into a QB, or ESPECIALLY a RB.  Incoming bandwagon fans excluded, KC lost its offensive line. And that's the major reason why they will continue to lose.
Refs seem to like the chefs hahaha
ridiculous penalty on Rashad penny!!!!
Refs gave the game to KC..,sick, sick, sick...,two horrible calls. The face mask call was crucial.
Man the Chiefs suck
Mahomes overrated
About that time to replace Giants offensive playbook
Just my thoughts as a chiefs fans  1 in offense they had three turnovers but I saw a lot of Mahomes staying in the pocket and delivering short to intermediate passes. That deep curl is developing they are figuring it out.  2 gore to me may be a little more versatile than Clyde. Maybe.  3 defense just won a game for this team.  4 chiefs are figuring it out. They tuning it up. Could be a possible playoff run.  5 gotta stop the turnovers.
The Chiefs have lose their MOGO this year.
Thanks Travis for the loss this week
The nfl is unfucking watchable 😂 1/3 of the highlights are penalties lmao
almost every game with chiefs is full of blatent and ignorant flags.. wonder why??
Great game Giants. Wish you could have pulled it out.
The int by mahomes was a bad throw. Gordon was wide open
LOOOK IT'S THE REAL FNF WEEK 8
Tf was that noise at 7:23
Giants suck
👍👍👍
Lucky win
Wait til they get their confidence back
A friend of mine from Costa Rica is at the Twin Tower site in NYC.  She says it the saddest place in NY.  I disagree.  The saddest place is where the Giants play!
Any day the Giants lose is a good day.
역시 캔자스🇰🇷🏈
12:15 I almost closed the damn video. Let the guys play, ffs. Makes me wanna puke
Patrick mahomes has no value for the football at all. His game is wayyyy off and he is costing his team games.
So it’s ok for the Chiefs to do the tomahawk chop but the Braves get drug through the mud? Double standard?
Ad's promoting alcoholism n gambling addiction!.. NFL doesn't care if a minor's watching this and drinks a bottle of wild turkey n dies!.. yeah yeah Ur response is U got parental control's on or some 💩 yeah Like that'd 🤬 work!.. NFL are filthy Sellout's for the Greenbacks!!!..💸💸💸
Call me crazy but I feel like its going to end up being the chiefs fighting the Bengals for the last seed
Remember when Tim Tebow had a weird throwing arm? They said he was bad now this guy jump throws , and side arm and they say that’s incredible
That series by Derrick Gore was something 😳
Just got to admit the other team's figured them out!!
12:14 how is that unsportsmanlike? You every player in the league celebrates a first down I don’t get that, what he do different?
Damn #1 pulled an AJ Green special move on the first drive
Gmen vs The Refs
That ref should be fired.
That ref is blind. And. 🙈🙈🙈🙈
6:19 - 6:52 was a waste of "highlights"
Chiefs need to protect & run the ball.
12:00 I’m a chiefs fan but that’s so bs 🤦‍♂️
More information... if you confess Jesus is Lord, believe in your heart God raised Him from the dead you will be saved (fromhell) Romans10:9  Please repent of your sin and believe today. Dont be left behind. Love Y'all
KC needs to get their act together if they want to make the playoffs
More Gore!! Why is this so complicated”!!
The taunting penalty is Bullshit its the NFL these mfers get paid at some point you gotta celebrate
That facemask called. Wow.
What happened to kc :(
Dang everybody hating on the Chiefs  rn yall I'm sure the fans feel bad enough dont need to rub their season on their face
He throws this ball from his shoe strings. hee must wear his shoe stings on his waist.
That's what happens to the giant when your qb is scared to get out the pocket
How can professional refs be so bad? Is there a personal foul quota these clowns need to fill?
RUN! THE! BALL!
with the refs on KC's side they barely won at home with the bogus calls against the giants who are a terrible team. the greatest QB in the history of the world mc homes cant pass more then ten yds fumbles and throws pics every game and without the running game even with all the bogus penalties against NY the chiefs lose
Patricks only nemesis is bouncing the ball off peoples heads.
This is the worst commentary group ever for MNF. Get some new commentators!!
Queefs looking worse than Donkeys😂😂😂😂
Nobody talking about Tyreek snubbing Mahomes at 1:44
The damb penalties the refs got this game rigged the calls were bullshit
Karma for all the Bronco hate😂😂😂
Josh Gordon anyone?!?! Anyone?!?!
I'm starting to think Murray is better than Mahomes.
Taunting? Fourth quarter 1st down Adrenalin is not taunting this isnt supposed to be soccer.
the giants would've won if not for the large amount of penalty calls on them. And that taunting call on the giants was the weakest call I've ever seen in my life.
Patrick Mahomes is a fraud
@1:45 Mahommes: "YEAAH. LESSGO! LESS...oh okay Tyreek..."
How bout Gore!?! Maybe they could just let him run every other play? 3:37 3:44 3:50 3:55 4:01 8:13
So weird.   I was looking for highlights as the title suggested but there wasn't any.
Your childish full grown men lost that game because of their stupid spoiled ways you deserve to lose New York
WE got robbed@Giants.. was not a facemask penalty.
If I was a coach I would find each player that played stupid at least $10,000 per game that would stop this stupid this and childish behavior with these personal fouls
I blame Jackson and his wife
Rigged NFL 😂. State Farm insurance giving Americans clues about who’s going to the NFC championship already 😂
Cripple Fight!!
Ross has been a bright spot. He should be used more.
Daniel Jones needs to stop looking at his first read so long. The more people you look at the more likely you will find the open one
Stop tryna pass the hill pass to somebody else
ENTERTAINMENT
Interception was on accident, Jones threw 1 because Chiefs were suppose to score ,Which did eventually happen. #NFLRIGGED
LOL, these teams were basically EQUAL...  And that says alot about KC.
Wow..if there was as many points as penalties this would have been one of the highest scoring games ever.
.....Patty Mahomes' inability to execute a play - every play is burdened with indecision and hesitancy, has this Chiefs team now quite mediocre, and leads to more injuries.....
Bad call on the facemask at the end. The Giants should have won this game... but that's the difference between these teams. Somehow the more durable teams get over the line.
After paying mahomes they STILL have enough cash left over to pay the refs too. Thats some good accounting work in KC
Booker just gets that ball and explodes after it touches his hands.  His breakaway speed is insane
NY is the most unentertaining nfl club to watch
0:06 he is clearly out of bounds right here.
All I saw this game was flags after flags...
Chiefs helped by a bad referee call
Maholmes need more Jheri curl juice…. He need his activator man! I need my activator!
Taunt call did it.
KC looking like a shell of their previous self
Kc cmon

They need to get rid of 49 PLZZZZZZZZZZ he is always giving up big plays Dang
Giants all day, and they're starting to finally find their rhythm, but Tyreek Hill is an assassin.
