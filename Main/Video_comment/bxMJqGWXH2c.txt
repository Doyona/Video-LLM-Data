#999FOREVER
😴 On Hit. 💚
I see alot of comments saying Ye helped Pierre make this beat, which he did. but be real fr, Kanye wouldn’t let him tag the beat if he didn’t create a majority. Bourne is like that fr. One of the best of our generation
This baseline is so incredibly tough😭
Man Juice on a Kanye beat
Did y'all know that not only does pierre produced but kanye also produced this beat. That's really crazy.
Prod By Kanye West and Pierre Bourne

The beat is immaculate
2:00 when someone asks you for gum in class

This is sick. It samples the clip of Ye    - Kanye West Amistad, I'm a God, the freestyle he did on at TMZ.  "Hopped off the Amistad and made "I'm a God" It's always a lituation when I'm involved It's always a lituation when I'm involved See, I say what they say when the mic is off"
Its always a Lituation when im involved🤯
Not just Pierre Bourne! Kanye ft. Pierre

Ever since he died I've been sad
Juice is the best rapper
😏🔥🔥🔥
What is young thug trying to say about Mexicans?
“Chicken BOCK-BOCK!! Like a nest king”
Can’t stop coming back to this heat. Pierre gotta be using 100% of his brain to come up with these beats. Thug sounds amazing on this beat and that juice feature 🔥🔥
This beat sounds like when Scooby doo and shaggy were messing around with that device in the real life movie.
💰💰💰💰💰💰
juice doing thugs adlibs is perfect
thug and juice collabs always go dummbbb
"Having sex with ur old lady I lost calories " That's a Legendary bar
Juice was the best rapper
For anyone who is struggling to find this because they cant type it in, type "Rich shat Juice WRLD"  your welcome
on the clean version of this song they censored "lesbians"
Igh this shii go 🔥🚒
They should have made a Collab album
What in the fuck is yung thug doing

Always nice hearing unheard Juice
Is it me I don't play the radio on that grid chicken brought ball like a missile
I was wondering why this so hard and seen it was a Pierre and Kanye beat. It was destined for greatness
Thank you thug.. much love for this right here.. I supported bibby since they FIRST came out on SoundCloud Nd jus the fact that Jarad wouldn’t have wanted bibby to pull this bullshit is sickening . Jarad is probably extremely upset with how your treating HIS fans.. not your fuccin fans.. JARADS FAN .. JUICE WRLD FANS .. HIS 999 FAMILY.. it’s sad .. Jarads probably the most loved human being on this planet with such a pure soul Nd your dragging his fans.. us thru the mud filling us wit false hope? Nd then ur gunna get all butt hurt that the documentary is gunna get leaked at a film fest? THEN FUCCING RELEASE WHAT WE WANT SO WE CAN STAY SANE.. I can’t imagine that I’m the ONLY person who feels this way..
Fuckin pierre man he too good
ملك
I swear everything ppl born on 8/16 do is top tier. I’m noticing a pattern.😁

Pi’erre and Kanye on the beat is unfair
Thuggy out here making music w/ them dead niqqas
Brrrrrr🔥🔥🔥🔥
juice wrld God rest his soul ! 🙏🏻
Pierre on a different level with these beats
So not talented, LMFAO
It’s goddamn shame we lost Juice WRLD so soon !!! 😞
Thank good for juice 🥤
I only loved this song for juice. The rest of the song sucked. But I’m still here for juice, as he has taught me everything that I needed to know to put myself out there without walking out. If he was never around after x, I would not have taken what I really wanted to do in life seriously. Now that juice is gone, I want to be the next version of him. Me and juice both go through anxiety and depression and I feel want to express my feelings through music to open peoples minds and to have them open up and respect others who go through disabilities that nobody sees. I want people to give other people that go through anxiety a chance because they are still capable of doing many good things. Like what juice wrld did. All of us miss juice especially me because he has taught me so much in my life that I’m holding on to. I miss you juice. 999. 💙💙
Hopped off the amistad and made im a god
When Pierre used the Nudy intro. I knew this shit was gonna slap

What the hell is he talking about
have you realised every track young thug and juice made together is just too good...from " on god" to  " manequin challenge"  to "bad Boy" and now this... Im going to cry now. SLIME WRLD FOREVER.
tbh I feel like juice sounded too melodic on the beat I feel he should of sounded something like what he sounded in Nuketown or Syphlis.
This been in my head since last night lol 😆..That beat 🔥 and I like Juice WRLd verse
once again juice carried with the feature
Petition for thugger to drop think twice
How you make a song with a dead guy?

Uh, shit, I made the devil dance-- JUICE WRLD 🕊🕊🕊999
juice & thug an underrated duo fr
Imma juice wrld fan but it lowkey sounded like A.I. Juice on some parts
YO! YO PIERRE YOU WANNA COME OUT?
This sounds like this was recorded during the “DRFL” or “Outsiders” era in either late 2018 or sometime in 2019, as you can hear it in Juice’s voice. (EDIT: I could be wrong though. They did have a collab tape in the works after “DRFL” dropped.) #999Forever
Jwrld 4 ever‼️

2:14 this part stuck in ma mind
2:12 they mixed this part weird and it makes it sound like hes an ai
Pierre & Kanye went stupid on the beat
I can’t believe three still songs about Juice Wrld? I guess he recorded a lot of songs but still that’s impressive.
Nope
This reminds me off the "on God" vibz.🔥🔥🔥🔥
The beat is fuego 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
juice wrld verse
21 gang 4L forever
Goated
It’s monotone rubbish. My ears are bleeding 🩸
This is the ultimate song. Juice and thugga my inspiration
Thank you thug for dropping and not being Like Bibby   999
Hopped off the Amistad, and made “i’m a God” 🤫 don’t be mistaken given all cred to pierre.
You clowns would scream your heads off   If a white man used some of your words
Shout out to Pierre and kanye for making this type beats. Theyre goat frfr
Still making money on a dead kid lol

Your verse ruined this song
Hopped off the Amistad and made "I'm a God" It's always a lituation when I'm involved It's always a lituation when I'm involved See, I say what they say when the mic is off -ye
The mixing on Juice vocals sounded a lil to loud and the echo kinda eats the song too much. Is it suppose to sound like his voice is coming from somewhere else?
Did Thug and Juice to the vocals togethers before he died?
Everybody agrees “Wrld On Drugs” should’ve been “Thug Wrld” or something like that. Young thug and juice together>future. and there’s ski, yachty, trippie, and everyone that probably has 10+songs with him.
what was with that chicken shit lmfao
Yo Pi'erre wanna come out here 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥firee
Ngl bro this album is soo good
look how juice was so amazing
Descanse em paz Juice WRLD, você era tão talentoso 🥺

Stay away from drugs
thought poke out by carti was about start playing 0:01
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Tanks  Pierre  for the rage beat, thanks  juice and thug  for going  wild
Life eternal at the King 🕊🕊

Good morning my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ, let us be grateful for what we have and thank the Lord for it, because someone in the world would do anything to be in your position or get what you have, so let's thank our God for what we have and be faithful with it by helping others, almsgiving is very important for it is written Give and it shall be Given to you (pls don't expect the person to give back to you but your reward will come from your Heavenly Father). Have a wonderful and blessed day 🙏🏽
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Kinda sad to see juices music slowly fade away. L Bibby absolutely ruined the whole thing. I miss Juice's music, it got me through some hard shit. Now I gotta wait till a braindead f$ck decides he is gonna stop lying about the album release date. Good to hear Thugger and Juice back onna track tho.
Got me jamming at 6 in the morning ayee 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌪🌪🌪🌪🌪
Young Thug > Bibby   (Joke)

Juice x Thug album produced by Pierre I know it’s real 😭😭🔥🔥🔥
He released this but not waves WTF that song such a vibe but thankful 4 this too 🙏 didn’t even know it’s existed always happy 2 hear new stuff from Juice *999* 🤟
Instrumental is crazy on this one. Pierre snapped
Juice is always 🔥
Pierre x Juice x Thug is a mood 🔥
These 2 are so different yet they compliment each other so well, they were supposed to have a collab album together.  Sadly, at this point I don’t think it’ll ever drop, they have enough songs for it I’m pretty sure but I doubt it’ll ever drop now.  For those who wanna see how good these 2 really are together look up their leaks of “I will follow” “blue cash” and “waves”.  This song is good, but those two are way better in my opinion.
GOAT Duo. Give us the album. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Shout out to Thugger for updating us with a new Juice, instead of Bibby himself... 🙄
999shit4L

listen to the slowed reverb version of the song https://youtu.be/2FptYsWKoZw
Fuck bibby atleast we got this new bit from Juice Wrld
Carti woulda went krazy on dis beat
This sounds like this was recorded during the “DRFL” or “Outsiders” era in either late 2018 or sometime in 2019, as you can hear it in Juice’s voice. (EDIT: I could be wrong though. They did have a collab tape in the works after “DRFL” dropped.) #999Forever
🐐🐐🔥🔥
