Blocka ❤
another collab  bro been a year 🙏
It’s not nak ray it’s nakhre
Beat is good but please keep the lyrics clean and less divisive bro. We need unity in our Muslim communities
Loved it bro, but Who is harami 😉
there are no brown girl in turkey, they consider themselves as whites, and they don't respect Pakistani people, so i think it is time to stop showing everyone love who consider you as animal, have some self respect, that's why even arabs don't like Pakistani people. because our own people don't have some self respect. 😅
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is still fire no matter when

Blocka comes in raami style
Boys 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The youth have totally lost their way, they are now boasting about shaytan and gloryfying him without anyone making them give up Islam they do it willingly. Good job there is a surge of reverts coming to Islam as the pagans are leaving. May Allah SWT forgive us all and keep us steadfast on our deen.
00:21 Great stuff! Peace
#Background music India 🇮🇳 Song is legend
Blocka the only reason I'm listening to this
fire
Pure trash
Bro i’m Pakistani, and the Uk rap remixes are good but this one comes too cringe overall it’s a good song but the first few seconds is just way too cringe for my ears
Blocka is to cold with it
These visuals were so shit, you need to improve the production of these vids
Blocka the type of guy to rap about hard life and trapping while having a well educated well off family
I don’t think frenzo is trying 😂
Blocka colddd

Three rats in one video
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
