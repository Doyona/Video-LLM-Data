What was your fight of the night?
5:52 aged like milk
Jesus fcking christ these reaction videos of izzy keep popping up and it's islam vs volk fight day I keep thinking oh it's already happened. Im too excited man
Brits 🇬🇧 Love Izzy 💪 always show support brother
“ he’s not won inna minute, let him enjoy it “ 😂
Hope you do the next UFC London card predictions and reactions, big Tom is that dude.
Any chance you can tell us the end music?
“I make Hollandaise from scratch” is literally the most American thing I’ve ever heard. Yeah mate, you’re just cooking a basic sauce
Hows paddy pimblett 1 and 2 fucking clown
Izzys nails are stinking looking
Listen i know it might seem like Darren is celebrating un deservingly but he was asked by Tom Aspinal his LONG TIME team mate to do so. He was asked to, other than that he wouldn't have done it
we need more of these
Cut ur nails man
Izzy is cool but his boys are mad haters
Paddy’s hometown is liverpool not london🤣
Izzy you got to get a bigger TV bro,  😅
Fighting ENGLISH 💯❤️
4:11 Dan🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 heartbreaking me
I can tell you know Paddy looks like Jay of the Inbetweeners
This guy is cool
Izzy I've been a huge fan for years. There ain't nobody that does it like you. Your skill and striking are unmatched. Personally I think your are the best fighter out there right now. Question for Izzy. Do you think there is anyone in the fight game that would be a tough fight for you?
Tom wants to work his way up the rankings would be a big jump to fight Cyril gane next
cut your fingernails champ .
"Some people get fed to the wolves?" Was that it?😆 Beause I was thinking the same thing.
Make apolugaize to us to ukraine people if you hear he sarcasm about ukine people! Its dad and for your chanel! Make apoligize or you bannd!!
Dan is done at the highest level. Acting like that's not the case isn't helping him it's only going to give him more brain damage. You can see it in his eyes. After the last couple fights he's been in it's like the lights are on but no one's home.  Dan didn't see everything and he most definitely wasn't fine. I'm not a hater I'm just worried for Dan. His fight style has a cost that will rear it's ugly head soon enough. I just hope he gets out before it's too late. Fuck to be honest I just hope it already isn't too late for him.
that food was laughable
Isreal adesanya u need to walk out to fight to MC hammers can’t touch this
He hasn't won in a while  , Let him enjoy that 🤣🤣🤣🤣who ever said that thumbs up bro
Izzy jelly of paddy for a sec there
Tai vs. Tom is more reasonable to make then Tai vs. Stipe... I think they gonna go with Jones vs. Stipe for the interim title
Sorry what? Dan's as tough as they come but he was not fine, he got destroyed by Allen and was not gonna last
he was "fine" xD
5:55 mans laughing like he’s gargling with syrup what the fuck lmao 😂😂😂
hes so cringe he really thinks hes some real life anime the fuck
wtf are them nails
He’s not won in a while let him enjoy it ??? Pretty Cringe, when your friends biggest achievement in his life, is too hold your camera lmao let that sink in....
where is the ilia topuria fight?
Must’ve been tough for izzy seeing Dan get battered like that
https://youtube.com/shorts/7hQt-im_Y48?feature=share # Wakanda Savage ✊🏿💯
Bro everyone talking about the fight while I’m trying to get that recipe for that eggs benedict
5:46 i agree, sit the fck down Darren. 🤣
The hell is going on with Izzy's fingernails🤔
Damn izzy you a super entertaining person beyond fighting...thx for keeping the fans happy👍👍
"Let me talk" 😂😂
Hooker looked like a sloth in this weight class.  He needs knew ppl picking his fights for him, ridiculous match ups the last few, him taking th3 short notice Islam fight was a horrible choice, now this fight.   Fire your team dan
I love how you guys are making fun of Darin till but your boy Hooker is a washed up journeymen
Didn’t Izzy take the moment away from Jan by being interviewed first at UFC 259? 🤔
Why mans have French tips
"He see everything" ... I don't think so homie 🤣🤣
When you telling Dan hooker to shoot
This dude got his nails done like wtf
izzy got those french pressed nails to go with his pearls. fa
Izzy I get dans your man and shit but my man was not fine I get it’s Dan and he get tek a welly in but he was getting battered
I never see stylebender hanging out with any women.
So hard being a Dan Hooker fan 😪
Bruh izzys nails be hella long
That hollandaise looked phenomenal
Ei da uma moral pro seu pai,ele lutou no vegas, assista a luta dele.
Watching Dan in the slow Mo he was completely covering with no signs of fighting back. Perfect stoppage really.
Shoutout to ilia topuria🔥
The people coming at Dan are obviously people with no friends who nobody fw lmao. I mean of course he’s gonna cheer for his boy. It’s what friends do lmao
Careful  israel !! paddy is on his way up to you lol .. the mans on a mission
Shamanic saga continués 1.618
3:49 He is done bro.
Where is the topuria reaction you hispanphobic🤬🤬
Boma mutu style 😂😂
Till hasn't won in awhile as Hooker eats his 4th loss LOL
Everson's is delusional when it comes to something
Izzy taking shots at a 2-0 fighter….. is that jealousy 🤷🏻‍♂️🤔🤔
Izzy with the Inbetweeners quote "bus wankers" Go on Izzy
Hope dan hooker gets back up again, the Darren till joke was hilarious 😂 yeah the kid should have sat back down and let him enjoy his win.  Good content Would like to see more details instead of you Izzy on your bloody phone all the time. Lol 😂
No reaction to Ilia Topuria's KO?
The George Bush comment really took me out 💀 surprised I don’t see more comments mentioning that part. Great video as usual Champ
Was a good stoppage, Arnold would have kept swinging till dan dropped. But dan will be back on top again soon  hes a great fighter and a great guy that the people want to watch fight.
Ayo I love the team but Dan hooker needs to take notes from Izzy because he was getting lit up😪
Fight of the night was definitely your boy against that eggs benedict!
Izzy's nails look like he's been dancing on a pole in Vegas
Feel so fu*king bad for Hookers fight, he’s such a great fighter
David looking lean can’t wait to see his debut at Featherweight!
Those nails freak me out. He just has to admit he’s bi, no shame bro
Dan sees everything… lol cmon man he was getting lit up
Paddy gonna be a megastar.
Making a joke about Ukraine like wtf . Privileged dick heads fucking hate this guy
Saying the fight was early and calling on the ref such a bellend
Dan needs one year out of the cage, relax his mind, all the damage isnt good
Locks don't work lol 🤣 Tom hold my beer
"He also shares his thoughts on victors Tom Aspinal, Paddy Pimblett & Darren Till."  How you going to disrespect Arnold Allen like that? After what he just done in the co-main. Just to try and take a jab at Till? Petty AF to see that.
Fed tomato cans😂😂😂
2:35 Izzy got French tip nails? Lmao
Paddy didnt fight in his home town, hes a northerner fighting in the south , there were alot of Northern fans there for paddy molly and Tom, they travelled to the south.
Izzy’s lookin pretty thick ngl
lmao first "burn the boat" now "refferee" i really can not wait the moment Chimaev will fight you, i would really like to watch he ragdoll you and gnp/submit you, no use training wrestling and grappling now all those Russian Chechen and Dagestan are different breed, good luck until that moment Izzy...
dan needs to be dropped, hes done for
In the Uk its never the fighters night. Its the nations Izzy
Izzy better stfu cause paddy might get em lol
David's response to the Ukraine part was mine too😂😂 I appreciate him for that 🙌🏾
Dan needs to take a long break. 1 or 2 years. And come back and take easy fights.
Бля, делай субтитры на русском, нихуя не понятно
Izzy tripping. Dan was getting fu@ked up.  reff saved his life
Thelastshitbender
Izzy I'm waiting for one of those spinning head kick knockout lessgo champ
Yeah me too, disappointed with the stoppage. Make it 5 rounds, Dan definitely can take those shots. As long as light still on, man still stand, fight on! Would love to see Izzy while he's watching Dan crushed and battered. Actually it has potential to be as good as Dan vs Dustin.
Izzy getting that yourtube money, views and subs goin up
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Jay once famously call folk at a bus stop bus wankers
Till thinking this chill as fuck shit is coke behavior. What a stretch.
Ahahahahahahahahaha he was fine my a$$
Whoever puts these videos together deserves a raise. The way the fight clips and reactions are shown is perfect
Bash those brains baby.
Dan is the new Cody Garbrandt, dude needs to retire. It is just sad seeing him fight at this point.
Aspinall asked Till to celebrate with him on the ropes. No problem with that. Allen demolished your boy and it was a good stoppage imo

Great to see Izzy having Dan’s back 🙌❤️
Am from England I love dan keep your chin up you turn up and fight anyone big respect
pady the baddy
Maaaaan I wanted to see you react to Ilia Topuria, next time :P
fake humble
Dan need to move and give some distance
you a hater bruv
Look into the camera izzy!
post more content than just reactions, I would watch stylebender and his crew over any youtuber.
Y'all have me dying making fun of Till's win on Saturday.  When I win , you win.
Respect to you my man. As a Brit glad Allen  got the W but hard to see that happen to Dan.
Do you have anything nice to say about Arnold whooping your boys ass 😂 shoot shoot 😂 eat your eggs try not to choke and not giving any credit to Arnold real classy champ.
You look big asf bro!! Pause
If that was anyone else he’d say he was covering up ref stop the fight but because it’s his boi he complains stop early he didn’t shoot and was taking shots for a while sorry
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
“The guys 1-2 it’s not a world title”😂😂😂
Devastated for Dan, but he will come again.  Also, banging breakfast.
You gained a fan after I seen how you really are on your channel. Sorry I ever doubted you before.
Dan Hooker, REKT. Remember when he talked shit about Islam for a full year. You're done.
You a great champ Izzy
1:33 idiot sandwich 😂😂😂
4:52 lmfao that do look good though
topuiria?
You can tell Izzy is cautious of Till 👀
Israel erection
love the rawness and seriousness.
hahaha
hahahaha  *Hooker doing his best impression of a punching bag*  Izzy: let them bang bro XD
Man I love Darren Till but that was funny af
I love Israel adesanya
Did he missTopurias' bout? best knock out of the night...
No reaction for topuria KO?
Izzy on his phone when the women fight 😂
looked all hunched over and punchs and knees were really slow.
Early stoppage, Dan wasn't going down he should be able to go out on his own sword.
Can't believe u missed that Meatball KO bro
Izzy is right though Till is trying to steal the limelight from Tom Aspinall sit the fuck down😂😂😂👇🏾
DAN IS SO TRASH LOL
LOL BRO DAN WAS DONE IN THE FIGHT AND IS DONE BEING A CONTENDER IN HIS CAREER LOL
Auntie izzy nice nails 💅🏼
#izzyidiot
I just think till was tryna make the fans more hype.. because during the introductions and all that the crowd was dead.. after that win he tried to hype the crowd up and his boy!!
Did Till dirty lmao
Dan's fought four times in a little over a year. 2 of those being in the top 5, Allen will be pretty soon at this rate and one dub. Plus the Poirier fight before that. Needs a proper break and too move back up or even try 170, he looked so sluggish and off at 145.. Rematch with Burns at 170 if the 🐺 does his thing.
Aspinall is a problem
Izzy looking thick! Fighting the winner of Glover Jiri?
Hey Izzy I’m a big fan but I lost a lot of respect for you when I herd you are running from Colby…jk
you should avenge Jorge
"He sees everything"🤡 Dan the hook eater should be able to see he needs to retire then. No place in LW, bullied out of FW immediately. Poirier and Barboza have each half of this mans soul. Get the NZ trash outta here. I'm tryna see Pereira send this fruitcake the shadow realm again.
Izzy... Don't you ever say "who the f are you" to your brother! Don't be so arrogant.
Subtítulos plis español im your fan 1
How do you somehow even become more unlikeable?
Till tried to take that moment and that was corny.
I’m really glad darren till got the win in his home town, good for him!
champ is looking posh woo, you sure don’t look like no MMA fighter. 😂😉
Hooker was just going to take more damage. Even a friend of his would care for his health
That shit witb Hangman is hard to watch yo. Hope the man could find a path back to victory.
Tell me Gordon Ramsey didn't do that🤦  C'mon, G!  I can't be a fan of that type of shit.  Don't get me wrong it's funny but c'mon...you know you're wrong for that Gordon.
This is why I love Izzy keeps it real wears his heart on his sleeve and gives you his true feeling about the situation no cap
Dan needs to take a easier fight there’s no shame in that it’s smart. Get some recovery build yourself back up mentally physically and your confidence and get a nice pay check and go home with a win do that once maybe twice and then go back for a contender fight
Deja de pintarte las uñas como una niña. Eres una niña
Ooooo shit the Ellie statue that’s my favorite game!!!
They got Darren Till fucked up 😂
Grande el cámara!! 🤣
Dont hate till
Me gustaria un traductor para los que no hablamos ingles 🇲🇽
Hey! U miss Tipuria's fight. I think Till was celebrating like that because English also love him.
david laughs like babidi from dbz
Why you so arsed about Darren celebrating with his team mate? Weird behaviour
Izzy's nails tho feel cringe af
Imagine questioning that Ref stoppage c’mon have some integrity
He sees everything
The silence for Dan “ okay guys let’s  go eat”🤣😂
Dude yeah he should've called out Ciryl Gane
Fantastic night for English MMA :) GLORIOUS.
So biased lol "HE SEE'S EVERYTHING"  He catches everything too lol.
Saying stuff about Darren till while your sat at home not supporting your boy getting spanked then calling out someone who flown to see his mate win embarrassing
Always liked Izzy but don’t see why he’s throwing shade at other fighters, him and till have always been cool I don’t see the need should show some more respect. And the little dig at paddy too then to go on and say “if youv got nothing nice to say don’t say it” when youv blatantly just thrown shade then later in the video do the same to till 😂😂 great fighter but turning less and less humble
Total bias for his team member getting absolutely smoked! Whats next for Hooker bantam weight 🤣
Where is topuria?
Man was drunk saying Dan was ok
“One bite challenge” 🤣🤣🤣 brilliant! ….I’ll be using that 🙌🏻
Big fan of Izzy but this was definitely the worst reaction/commentary video I’ve seen from his channel.
The eggs benedict got my thumbs up for sure.
245k 22-3-2022
Hooker was not fine. You could hear the ref telling him to fight back twice. Was a good fight. But 145 is too much of a cut for Dan. He needs time off and go back to 155
Much love for Dan from the uk. He’s proper. Obviously happy for AAA though.
Still can't get over them nails..🤣
FUCK THAT STOPPAGE. These refs are ruining life’s nowadays. Also don’t know how this is still up 😂. Love you cuz
izzy takin a big loss to AAA
IZZY'S BRO IS TO FUNNY!
Thought Izzy was saying "Bus wankers" at 1:40  Thought he might have been an inbetweeners fan as Paddy looks like Jay
Bro does he have french tips tho!!🤣he's a savage is guess when u bad ass u can do that.
Dan got smoked
Dan stoppage was a good one my g. He wasn’t rebounding from that.   Hate to see it! Love the bloke
No.1 channel all the mocks hahahah
2:38 is Izzy a drag queen Izzylea at night? Those nails man...
Izzy he was not fine.
These guys are pure jokes man, you can tell they got good vibes especially at the end 😆
Why dont react ILIA TOPURIA KO???
I feel less bad now that i experienced that Hangman loss with Izzy too…
Hooker never fails to dissappoint.Very undisciplined and always brawling.
''come on ref wtf'' copium
Izzy's fingernails tho
Bus wankers 😂  I can see Gane next tbh! I think that's what's Dana will be eyeing
He will back stronger
no Ilia reaction? that KO was crazyyyy
love the RIP to Dan @ 4:15 - 4:25 then the cut to what they are eating.
I can't be the only one thinking.... What is up with those fingernails!?!?!?!?!?
trim those nails g
Izzi a trip.....mah man....
Come on Adesanya! I know he is your friend but don’t blame the ref.
Anybody knows what's the last track? It's dope as hell
Borz 2 yrs from now will take your belt Izzy fans mark my words. Respect  tho u r a great champion and man, may your future be blessed
Izzy is fuking hilarious....He has straight up star potential.
Yeah Izzy some people get easy fights like Arnold got that p**** Dan hooker walked straight through him.
That's a true friendship you have with dan. All the best on your journey  .
Not a straight arm bar. that is a Kimura 😂
izzy nails
Chimaev is coming for u 😈
David is brutal 🤣🤣🤣
Why they all hating in the background 🤦‍♂️😂 that’s too funny you gotta laugh at yourself if your hating on someone else journey and to say that about till aswell come on Izzy you cried when your boy was at the weigh in and you seen molly and paddy celebrate together it’s a liveroool thing we have More passion than anyone in the world #fact.  your a ufc title holder  we get it your 💩 still stink tho .  but your hearts golden 👍🏻 stay humble champ inspire it’s what your good at
Dan got fucked up
1:35 - Good Laugh 😂  Idiot sandwich - Gordon Ramsey reference.
David Adesanya, the undisputed eggs benedict champion of the world.
Terrific performance from Hooker should be on the short list to the title of cut soon
darren till picked up a win tonight hahahaha
Dan Hooker is pathetic. Wants to be like Izzy so bad that he goes to 145 so he can have the same lanky length advantage but just gets starched anyway. Needs to be the 170 he is. Might be better off.
Dan looked horrible…🤦🏽‍♂️
Owen Hart coming out Bushwhackers style haha. He's very athletic but way too arrogant and I can't wait to see him get humbled. It'll be better for him and shut up his annoying fans. Also, fuck MM for bringing in a fake belt.
Where is Topuria?
Is Israel English?
The fact he knows who the "Bush Wackers" are makes him a totally legend van totally tell he's a fan of WWE if he talking bout the Wackers!
Hooker reminds me of Rory McDonald after his war with lawler he was never the same again.
Aint no style just a bender....!
He’s in his hometown? 😅
Dan Hooker was not fine, he got raped
Think UK might have the best fans out there 🔥
Dan need to go to 170 or sum he couldn’t take a punch
Great content... See how easy it is..  just be yourself.. keep it up Izzy and team!
Reacty Bruno Blindado vs Alex Pereira ?
Yh Dan lost fair and square man he needs to learn some defence
I believe we seen the future champs of the featherweight and heavyweight division on that main event card
Izzy love ye man but saying paddy is in his home town city whilst he is fighting in london is disrespectful, paddy is a scouser, scousers are from Liverpool, believe it or not but other places exist in the uk other then london
Plimbet is a clown
Dan was getting touched up, ref did the right thing
keep bagging on fighters losses when your teammate has been a punching bag his last 5 fights... till and khamzat gonna crush you
2:12 - keep paddy metaphoric down
Starting t’by talking digital art..... i mean no one cares about real one and now because it’s a cash grab they on it
Y’all violating darren at the end 💀
So, when Darren is happy for his friend who won, it's a problem, but when Israel was hyping up "Blood Diamond", who got raped in the ring, that's okay. Also, I like how Israel says Paddy gets tomato cans, and then his own teammate gets destroyed in the first round. Just shut the fuck up. Fight Colby.
That was pretty classless of Izzy to call Till out like that.  Tom Aspinall actually nudged Till to get on the fence with him.
Paddys chin is suspect i think… still like the guy
why is izzzy only friend with chefs
The Bushwhackers I remember them holy frack that's old skool. Good.memery Izzy.
Dan looked like he was in slow motion
Roasted the fuck out of poor Darren
Lol naw that stoppage was bullshit idc
Till likes attention!
Oof thats hard to watch but i know he's going to come back stronger, those CKB boys don't mess around!  I think Dan has got to stay at 155, he looked a bit compromised and slower than usual I'm assuming from the weight cut. His two last losses at 155 are from Dustin, Chandler, & Islam, you cant down yourself too much for those losses cause those guys are the elite of the division. I'd like to see him fight Tony or RDA, both would be a banger of a fight.
Yooo, what is that Alabama Fuel Services hat in the beginning on the table, and where'd it come from?
Izzy's brother's laugh looooool
nun dis food shit ness. keep to the fights. dope
Lmao keep crying us english support our own till is aloud to celebrate as well lmao 🤣
"He sees everything"  Had me dead😂😂
Izzys brother saying about till ‘let him enjoy it he’s not won in awhile’ killed me😂😂😂😂😂
Hangman is probably on the brink of getting cut. What's that like 4 straight losses?
I hate seeing Dan lose man such a big fan the guy takes no easy fights he's a savage I just hope he goes back to 155 and puts in work
Izzy saying paddy is getting fed easy dudes…shouldn’t be throwing stones in a glass house! I remember saying the same about izzy when he first arrived & they hyped him up like that.
Maybe Dan should go up in weight instead of down, maybe the cut had a little something to do with it
"what about the Ukraine"- did I hear that right?
Damn Izzy didn't know you was a The Last Of Us fan
Heartbroken for Dan. These city kickboxing guys are awesome, you can tell they are all good people. Man! If I felt bad for Dan I could only imagine how Izzy must be feeling
Dan hooker Is way to big to be fighting at 145, looked deflated and got beat way to easy. Time to go to 170 where he belongs
was tough to see dan lose love that guy! cant wait to see him come back stronger keep you head up dan!
Molly McCann with a spinning back elbow KO   Izzy: I'M A SUSHI ROLL
Lol tills come back was wack, saying izzy ain't looked good in a while, lol atleast izzy still winning 😂
Izzy's Brother Is The Funniest Dude I Literally Cried LoL!!! 🤣😂😭
Not his home town, this was london he's from liverpool
Paddy will never be champ at 155
Saw my name in that comment section 😭
Adesanya is right Aspinal should a call out ciryl gane
I think Dans fight was a good stoppage, he was getting mauled and didn’t recover will! Maybe it was the weight cut, but it was so bad for him in there
This fight night was one of the best and the reactions were nothing like they should’ve been. Allen mullered Hooker and stoppage was more than justified.
Till will send you into retirement
Tough to see Dan go out like that.
David violated Darren lol
Damn good show guys! And I love to watch Samurai Dan Hooker Fighting even when he looses! Just keep going Dan and the tide will change in your favor again mate, trust it!
Dan looked weirdly slow. I love Dan it was hard to see. Id like to see him at 155 or 170
Izzy acting as though Dan was all good after being completely out on his feet 😂😂
Bruh didn't have to go after Till like that LOL!! But seriously great channel, we need longer episodes tho for fight reactions (please). Big Shout to Style Bender and his Fam for making this page!! Always great pre fight, mid fight, and post fight content!
Dan got fucking battered by a much better fighter on the night.
Alex is coming for you Izzy. Make it 3-0
Izzy scared of light heavyweight devision. He a pussy
Dan hooker lost 😂😂😂😂take the L
What's with all the Darren till insults? All he did was celebrate with his friend and training partner? izzy is a cocky twat and big jan put him in his place
Did Hooker not have any cornermen ? He was sitting alone after the loss 🤔
Poor Dan, I'm genuinely sad when see he sit after the fight 😢
Ouchhh they killed darren
I love the moment where you put a lot of emotion into Dan's loss. Much love and respect champ
coming at darren for ‘not winning in a while’ yet he’s sucking upto dan…
The description 😂
Hookers looked finished even on the build up...he knows it is over himself...
The referee for the hooker vs Allen fight smelled like cigarettes and alcohol
Heavy heart for Dan loss.
Savage
Tom or Tai? That fight is gonna be crazy. I want to see.
Francis is the whiners champ.
Dan needs to take some time away from The sport heal up nicely he’s obviously been paid well for stepping in on some fights and quick turnarounds go home heal spend time with the crew and family and come back.. he needs a full year off
Tom Aspinall should have called out Ciryl Gane for sure! Especially because Ciryl was at the event in London watching live
He sees everything he sees everything, OK. Izzy is the dumbest gay man alive.
Izzy dat ni**a mane!!
What about Topuria vs Herbert?
I think the referee acted at the right time with Dan.. he was taking a real beating
Had hooker because I just felt he beat more high level opponents and more experience but my bet suffered for it sadly
Till hasn’t won in awhile 😂🤣
I gotta say you're correct...certain people get fed...
05:46 Haha
Izzy wishes he had a girl like Darren Till cheer leading with him after fights.
love watching dan fight, it's never boring. but it was probably a solid stoppage . it felt like he was going to hit the deck and just get pounded more.
Never a good sign when someone wheres sunglasses on the scales. Hooker's physique looked amazing, but you couldn't see whether his eyes were haunted to get down to it.   Allen is so natural at that weight. Has legit power to go with his amazing speed and footwork.
Izzy and his team are a National Treasure 💪🏿
I can feel the pain for Dan as well, I'm not well 💔
Arnold Allen's shoulders are about 2 divisions bigger than Hooker's. Why do you think he has to be so short for the weight.
You only have to see how Hooker didn't fight the decision and went to his stool to know he knew Allen won.   Allen and Hooker are two of the nicest guys in the sport. Was massively supporting Allen as an Englishman, but Hooker is so classy; wish him all the best.
These reaction vids are always fair dope. Always slick with the footage & editing. Got that emotion in for the Hangman. You have to feel for the guy. Really hope he can get back on the horse. Great Job with the vid.
Cooking during the gunnar fight was a smart move 😅
Let’s go Allen smoked dan easy
Dude I can’t believe you missed Topuria’s KO, I wanted to see his reaction 😂
„He should have called out Gane“, exactly my thought.
Lol he sees everything 😂 biased blind cunt
Dan hooker was nice fine Izzy
No Topuria reaction?
Had me in tears doing till like that 😂😂 Feel he would have even enjoyed that one!
Izzy's bro is fucking hilarious HE'S NOT HAD A WIN IN A WHILE LET HIM ENJOY IT.  HAVE A HEART.  hahahaha
Izzy eating after Hooker's loss. Do we call that celebration? Is he celebrating his loss?
how does Izzy get away with having nails that long?  i thought they'd have to have them cut short edit:  its gotta hurt seeing your friend lose like that and sitting so dejected.  its a brutal lifestyle
Cut your damn nails bruh. 💅 they look clean tho
That fucking Eggs Benedict looked ridiculous
Dan should have shot for a TD n buy a lotta time
"He hasn't won in a while"😭💀
Your boy is done.
Excited for this one - I love Dan and I hope he finds his rhythm again but it was pretty ridiculous decision making to try and pounce & press on an opponent who was just throwing like Arnold Allen was. Dan's got so much range and style, he could've tried to break away a little more after surviving the initial onslaught because you can bet on Allen gassing later in the fight if he explodes like that in round 1 (even though I do have a lot of respect for Allen, dude can fight - he was EMPTYING his gas tank).
Since the fight with Dustin, Dan is not the same anymore
When khamzat gets your really ganna be sushi roll bro 😂
Dan looked like he was moving underwater. 145 was not the move.
One of the great things about all the Brits is the way they all they support each other. Molly and Paddy were so supportive and genuinely happy for each other, just like Till was so hyped for Aspinall.  And that crowd, Bloody hell !!! 🤣
hooker wasnt fine.....
Nice nails and pearls, what does this make you as a man?
The "it's not your moment" about Till, what about UFC 253 when you beat Costa, Kai-Kara was on the card and he lost but when you won he's dancing in the back with you. ??? Surely that's not his moment especially after losing himself. But no people understand you purely celebrating your win as a team. Why's it work or allowed for you guys. But when Tills hyped for Tom it's "not his moment" hypocritical asf.
" What about the Ukraine and Russian Wa.." SHUT UP !! XD
Ma dude got the manicure on point 😂😂  Izzy if u gay tell us bro, we don’t judge!
You fight here with our Nigerian community I promise youlll love it bro. I was there Saturday.
I feel the same dan could recover there and arnold wouldv gass not the best stoppage
Yo Izzy, how could you not react to Paul Craig's sensational comeback finish? That was the first banger of this card!
Allen smashing your boy U.K. all day real fighters
Big W for Till 🤣
Come on Izzy man... ref screams top of his voice FIGHT BACK FIGHT BACK and Dan shells up. I know he's your friend and fckk we all like Dan, but he didn't want it. Also what's the constant digging out Paddy's opponents? He's 2 fights in... You fought Rob who tf are you Wilkinson and then had a split decision win over a young 12-2,  2-1 in UFC Marvin Vettori. That isn't the Marvin of today. At that time hardly "killers" as you put it.
boys did darren till dirty there
What they saying about paddy stop hating guys haha
Darren Till, the Tony Bellew of MMA, but with 1/16th the success...
Good to see Izzy's reaction to Dan's fight.  Reminds us that we as people can never really be truly neutral or unbiased.  and also to why maybe corners let the fights go on too long
honestly i said the same thing, i didnt think dan was done at all. but good fight
I was the same the useless ref stopped it to early give the man time he wasn't on the ground
Tough one for Dan but he was getting pinged 🤷🏻‍♂️
Wym he's fine, he was covered up for too long. Body language displayed didn't want to continue at all
George Bush doesn't like black people 😂😂😂😂😂Kanye classic
Izzy these are 🔥
Dude is too busy staring at social media to see one of the greatest female finishes of all time, also, Izzy, cut them nails mate
congrats to darren on his big win
Dan hooker hasnt been the same since Dustin Put that Work on em.
I hope Dan takes like a year off and really works on his defense
Feel for dan hooker sucks but hey thats the fight game 🎮
Dan still hasnt worked on defense since chandler violated, DP violated him as well. He is becoming a gatekeeper
look at izzy lying and trying to  hold his laugh in watching dan loose 🤭🤭🤭
Watched your boy get his ass whooped 🤣
Release ur re action to ufc 267
Love Izzy’s commentary, honest and on point.
Bro Ilia koed the dude so cold his eyes were open. Where’s that ko ?
Dan was not okay,it hurts to watch but it’s a part of the fight game
Izzy. You’re my guy.
4:45
I think Dan should consider hanging it up unfortunately. Not a hater at all, always cheered for him. Just my opinion
For the algo
izzy whats best for hooker. bellator or one fc is your opinion?
i don't think dan was fine tbh.
Izzy what's up with your nails? No disrespect I just wanna know? 😜
Feel as if Dan needs to step away for a little than have a couple tune up fights he’s fought 6 times in the past 2 1/2 years nothing but savages too definitely hasn’t taken the easy route
5:52   lol.. Blakamoto. darren till will come for you oo😂
Jan’s son
TOPURIA FIGHT REACTION?🥺🥺
"it's his hometown" lol London isn't Pimblett's hometown come on now Israel, you're more worldly than that
Fook off mate khamzat ragdolls you tittysanya! Oh btw Dan hooker is washed maybe he needs to cut to 135 lbs next time lmaooo 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
This channel, the Adesanya bros specifically, have me cracking up every video lmao
wtf and the best fight in the night ???
Bro, u need to address those long as nails 💅 lol 😂
5:47 😂😂😂😂
standard kiwi shi: “oh gommon ref”
The chick got clocked by a spinning elbow but she's fine though. 🙂
Dan no power hooker
Nobody: Izzy: “I’m a sushi roll”
“C’mon Ref!” When in Rome… I mean London.
Till saying you where salty but his post says otherwise he all mad 😂
Glad Izzy showed his reaction to Dan.... Mad respect for letting us see that side
If you win I win, cause Till know that he can't win... 😆
Dan should fight someone that he can defeat,  he can't defeat people in the top 5, first Islam dominated and now got owned by allen
Tom Aspinal nickname should be TA-TA
No way he genuinely thought Dan Hooker would win lol
Lmfao when he told Darren till to sit down
Dan was done.
Dan is washed now. i say he has one more fight left. if he wins, resign him. if he loses, cut him fast.
Why a champion jealous of a fighter on a loosing streak
Dan needs to keep that damn right hand up. He has a bad tendency to have it so low, it’s how he was caught and how Chandler dropped him in their fight.. Dan had trouble controlling distance and dealing with that speed
3:39 "shoot shoot" 😂
It was an early stoppage but Arnold was probably gonna win either way. I don't understand why Dan went down, if anything he should have gone up to 170.
hey Izzy my names Trevor if im being honest you probably wont see this but just the thought of talking to you or you seeing this helps in this time in my life right now im battling depression and suicidal thoughts my life has fallen apart with everyone around me to stability to even food at times if you do see this if it doesnt take away from you being champ and everything id appreciate it if you posted more yt content it really does put a smile on my face and i feel better when watching your content probably wont see this so it doesnt matter .................
We want 2C U Fight soon!!  When?
Thanks for the reaction Stylebender.
Disrespecting Darren till ur boy got fucking ruined. Dan wasn’t fighting back it was a great stoppage
Gunnar
Damn it kinda got dark/depressing when Dan lost lol
3:45 that was alil bias and love for his guy and believed in him but he was getting smashed Izzy definitely knew it but couldn’t say it man’s 3-4 I believe now that’s a bad lost
Bro shoulda never went down yo 45 he should go to 70..dude has 75inch reach an 6'1..
Arnold Allen the fucking goat
“Dan getting rocked”  Izzy: He sees everything! 😂
Homemade Eggs Benedict...What a fancy fight night food! 🥰
You guys clowning Darren till was hilarious 😂 🤣
Pretty bad decision by Dan to take this fight for his debut return to 145lbs, like I get he has name value and popularity etc but taking on the 7th ranked 145er in your return fight down a weight class? Just wasn't the move. I had Arnold Allen winning by definitive ud and I'm literally born and raised in nz, wasn't a good fight for Dan he should of fought a Shane burgois or a 12-17th ranked 145er IMO.
Just MOP.. Not everybody's gonna make it.. Dan put himself in a lot of wars too. Paul Felder,  Dustin Poirier most notable.. I remember when Izzy first came on the scene.. He introduced all his boys and said they were all gonna go to the top.. Looks like it's just Izzy and Alex.. I don't see anybody else from that era making it.. It's been a minute too.. They all seem like good people though.. Wish them all the best.. 🍻
Them Darren Till jokes though🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣funny as hell 😂
Dan did look pretty terrible though, he definitely did not seem like he was gonna win that fight at all.
He wanted Dan to die 🤣🤣🤣 I thought that was his boy? He was not fine
Dan Hooker hasn't been the same since the Poirier fight.
Fuck Izzy that Benedict looks good
Aahhhh  some free thinkers over there eh boys. Good stuff eh
Sorry izzy ur boy Dan has no chin anymore he needs to call it a career
all izzys team do is lose LMAO!!!!
bro dan was not fine at all, that was a good stoppage. if anything, that's better for dan, after the punishment he took since the dustin fight...
Wasn’t paddy’s home town either was in a complete different city at the other end of the country
The Adesanya bros gonna package all this footage of Izzy and snatch a $30 million bag from Netflix, jeen-yuhs style.

I feel for Dan I also wish they showed their reaction to ilia’s win
karmic justice for playing down the epidemic in NZ and supporting right-wing nuts keen on mass death and distress rather than seeing the big picture. Realise that sport NZ did ya'll wrong but all that outburst and shit taking about NZ was pretty crap to see. We saved heaps of peoples lives here, unlike US and UK, from the collective community-wide approach we took. Ya'll just played that off for your selfish reason in the international media. Not saying you didn't have a legitimate gripe but man CONTEXT.
Can Dan go down to 135? 😅
Word
It was so good to see dan the fake nice guy lose. So so happy.
Not an early stoppage that mf was giving dan the hands
Can someone explain the Izzy/till am I missing something ?
Dan should retire.
Man, we all felt for Dan the same way. Pin drop silence.
Feel for hooker, he down bad right now
0:01 moments taken right before disaster 💔
Izzy is such an egotistical guy
That weight cut killed him. Kia Kaha Hangman. Where ever and whatever you choose to do New Zealand will be with you fully 💯  Stay hearty Hangman
Thought the Dan stopage was really bad, especially considering what we know what he did against Poirier round 2 after getting beaten hard round 1. Hope he can get through this early stoppage loss and come back.
As a big fan of Dan hooker… please take a break
wanted dan to win :( is it me or he looked a little slow ?
Dan Hooker wasnt fine in that fight. As the wise Uncle Chael have said; People dont get smaller as they age. Get him to 170 like Conor beating up the main event shy Donald Cerrone. Stephen A Smith was right all along.
Aspinall is shockingly good. I have no idea what his limit might be.
where was Topuria knockout reaction you fuckers? It was on the maincard too, jesus.
Since I've started watching UFC, all Dan hooker has done is lose. Now I don't care too much for Dan but I so care for Izzy and I hate to see him sad like this.
Was waiting for this, letsgoooooo
Dan will be fine guys!! he has ONLY faught class and will continue to do so, he will sit at that 7 and be a gatekeeper until NZ stops fucking about. gotta be hard fighting out of there with covid crap
"When I  win you win". LoL...😂😂😂 Sssssavage! 😎
Ref saved Dan from an absolute beating. I'm glad he stopped it when he did.  Feel like Dan needs a good break back home, recharge, reset.  Allen is a beast.  Aspinal is the real deal for sure.
Dans been fighting straight killers, and instead of backing off or shooting he almost got himself a counter KO, sucks to see it happen, but the Hangman is one of my favorite fighters I know he'll be back!
If he keeps reacting to hooker fights its gonna kill him haha
Dan was very disappointing. He looked flat with no head movement. Does the hangman continue fighting ?
TLOU2, one of my fav games of all time.
What the fuks up with your stupid nails
He didn't see shit wym 😂😂😂 145 is not his weight class Dan looked slow or unconfident or something
Izzy has a big ego
Darren till talkin 💩 on IG
adesanya paiting nais wtf, what a hooker xD
no idea why dan didnt get more distance. he had such a reach advantage on him yet he came in.
Imo alot fighters hit the decline after big wars.. the poirer fight took alot of him I think. Dan's chin is slowly going out the window
My reaction was the same as Izzy’s to the Dan fight. 😕
Hooker needs fix his zen.
The way you reacted to Till stepping in with Aspinall... but not when Molly stepped in on Paddy's win?
Lol Dan was not fine
David's laugh bruh 🤣🤣🤣
I felt same way bought Till,, takin Toms moment, bllsht
Dope editing
Darren Till 😂😂😂 Dana gave him a main card vs Wonderboy in the UK which was boring af. Gave him another main event in UK vs Masvidal and gets ko'd. I'd pretend I won that night as well if I were him
5:53 that's fucking illegal 🤣 your bro is funny af🤣
When are you going to react to Alex Pereira, pussy?
Bro, that was an epic card dude. Just the finishes of main card was enough. No decisions.
It’s hard watching your buddy go down.. but dans a fckn killer.. dudes takes the fights that everyone turns down. Dan Hooker RESPECT!!
Too real and too funny 😂😂😂
Tlou II statue there
Izzy needs to stop blaming refs for saving their teammates from getting Seriously Hurt💯#nocap. Those are not early Stoppages
Why does Izzy look 23
Is Dan okay? He's not been looking quick in his last few fights
Chechen Till 4.0 will Kill Everybody Aaaarrghhhhh
Im sorry izzy. Dan was getting wrecked 🤷🏻
Darren Till 😂😂😂
Would love to see a mma live podcast of Israel and his friends
Heartbroken for Dan man he didn't look good at 145 honestly he was alot better at 155
Low key y’all slept on molly , her knockout was absolutely insane. That was probably the best women’s knockout I’ve seen.
Yall so petty🤣🤣
Don't blame the reff izzy, that was a good stoppage
cut your nails buddy
Alll this money and ya nails still nasty jeeez ..whys it always like that
No way Izzy missed the meatball ko🤣🤣🤣
In my opinion, Dan was not fine in that night. I thought that he should come back to LW or move up to WW. He was too slow to throw a bunch of pucnh. His head didn't move and he got hit too much @@.
4:08 I felt that moment too...the rage in silence...Izzy sure will be fine!
Dan needs some homie right now to get through this crisis of him.
Tough one for Dan. Rather see him go to 170 than suffer at 145.
I honestly feel like Dan would do better at WW, he’s older and he’s a little too slow for the FW’s
How about mr finlands fight
IZZY:  Straight up question homie.    I am a fan. When you beat, Anderson and then carried yourself with honor. ..I have paid for every fight ever since...and will continue to do so.    BUT.  ......Straight up man.....why are you NEVER  around the ladies...or have one as a Satellite in your home vidz...or ANY VIDZ....for that matter.   EVERY other male...does....at some point in their vidz.   I HEARD you ..when you said you are walking your own path..and have been in no rush to get married and have kids...I heard that. But...after all this time ...I just want to know ...what's REALLY GOING ON.   ARE YOU  ___ ?   OR NOT. I am 100% positive..I am NOT alone with this question.  If you think that...someone who is ____ and came out....if you think that would alter their career path,dramatically...you are correct.   With all due respect, This Savage wants to know.    Cheers from N SEATTLE..to you and yours.
Where was the dick punch highlight wtf izzy
Dan has a world class gym that has world class athletes to train with. So what's the problem? I'm genuinely curious to know the answers.
Tai Vs Stipe? Was this a leak?
🍷🍷🍷🕺🕺😋😋😋
not showing the part of the illia fight???
They did Till dirty lmao
“Look at the camera when you talk.” “ Who the FUCK are you!”
Till is a bum and even Izzy knows that
#FREESTYLEBENDER  Now that was true grief on your face when hooker lost , 1) Tell hooker stop telepathing his moves . 2 he has cardio more grappling and wrestling in the cage everyone knows he's going to stand up , 3 ) to square hooks to wide , 4 ) less punches if you leave it out to long that's a  freebie , punch  guard slip . Man I felt bad too hope you see this and share its the truth
Aspinal would destroy Gane with his wrestling. Gane can't even defend Francis's wrestling
I called this fight on the prediction vidoe
Give credit where it's due bro
My reaction to the ref in Dan's fight was the same, like he's been in massive brawls give the man 10 seconds to defend at least he had his guard up even
Yes him and Gane would be a great fight
Poor Dan
Its so sad that Izzy has all these MMA friends but none of them are as good as him so he has to watch them lose
If anything Dan needs to move to 170 ..his not taking punch's well..he was very skinny yesterday
Dan hooker lol
Izzy is a casual
Izzy
You think Hooker was an early stoppage? He was getting beats
Paddy's not in his hometown pal
5:54 that laugh 💀💀
That house deserves a home cinema  projector set up!
Till suck xd
Ref made the right call, Hooker was hurt.
Darren was asked to jump up with tom
Idk how I feel about the French manicure bro.
Your boys are done none of them good fighters 🙄
I don't think Izzy has taken too kindly to Darren saying that Khamzat will destroy him.
Darren just hyping up his boy lol.
My exact reaction with the stoppage on the Hooker fight
Did Izzy watch the prelims card? The whole card was insane!
I hated the ref stopping the Dan fight but like when you said “shoot shot” I was so glad I wasn’t the only one that thought that. I don’t understand why he just sat in the pocket then got backed into the fence and made no move to try and progress the fight. I mean I ain’t the one In the cage so I can’t say that much but damn
Keep  your chin up Hangman, we love you bro. Youll be back champ
Islam broke your boy hooker look at him now 🙄😪
What a great night with great fights💪🏼 Dan got smashed man broke my heart but he'll learn and be back. Like Jose Aldo on a resurgence of sorts, Dan will be back
Dan should not have moved down, his body type is either 155 or 170 for optimum performance. Also probably need to take 6 - 9 months off to heal.
Poor Dan he didn't see anything apparently 🤦🏾‍♂️ man why did t he shoot in for the take down instead of  throwing and hoping
catch weight darren vs hooker >?>?
“He’s fine” 🤣🤣🤣🤣 that shit gotta get memed bruh he was not fine in any way, shape or form🤦‍♂️😂
It's so hard to pick just one favorite fight, so I'll give my top 3. Meatball Molly,  the first fight of the prelims, was lit 🔥 and Tom Aspinal that man is for real. Heavy weight best get that work in Tom is coming
Yo Izzy i’m loving the content bro, keep it up! You’re making us fans proud. Love from Wellywood
The crazy thing is London is not even the REAL ENGLAND LOL that's Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester, Nottingham where you see the REAL fight fans. That was a good crowd last night but not the best England delivers.
Why does Izzy got French tips
Help Dan use his range and implement some sorta defense
Lol, camera bouncing around when David is watching the Hooker fight
I realize card's on mad early for NZ time but man if you guys started watching at the Molly fight you missed a TON of good fights this whole event was 🔥🔥🔥
“Who the fuck are you” exactly. Blakamoto needs to check himself. All he is is a friend of a successful person
Can't wait for the headlines in other channels, "Adesanya rips Darren Till".
I really want Dan to win but much rather have him be healthy for the rest of his life. He fought like he had a bit of brain damage, and I mean that literally -- synapses seemed to be firing much slower. Ain't my place, but if he was my boi, I would triple check his health.
Watching Dan lose was really heartbreaking. That. Fucking. Sucked.
Hooker is done. Needs to call it quits before the Ali shakes set in.
He need to move up... 😥
Izzy did you not see this coming for Dan? I mean your other team mate did this to Garbrandt when he dropped down.. and when you look to both their real reasons for dropping.. this was almost garuanteed to happen. Thinking that being bigger is the solution instead of working your skills. You knew this deep inside.. Eugene for sure, he did not like this drop at all.
UFC? Completed mate.
Izzy is great on the marketing because he sees the way to get to the belt in the heavy weight.
"George Bush doesn't like black people" 😂😭😂 # Classic!!  I love Izzy show mane you gentlemen keep up the GREAT work!!!
Your boy got smeshed
“Some get fed….if you don’t have anything nice to say”. 🤣🔥💵
Thought I’d see a react to that crazy Topuria fight!
Maybe welterweight is the weight class for Dan...
Appreciate Izzy’s loyalty to Dan.  Dan deffo wasn’t fine though la.
dan looked slow before he was clipped, he looked off, maybe im wrong and i dont know shit, but based on other fights thats how it looked to me
Arnold Allen got arrested for hitting a bunch of people in a bar including a few women. He’s a bum
5:52 *Aye yo why LEGO head had to do Darren like that.* 🤣
Dans been doin it since 2014 - he just need a break from competition, but who knows if that’s even an option. It’s like you get to the top and if you slow down you get swallowed by the next gen
*Hooker NEEDS to go to 170lbs!* He already looked depleted at 155, but he was way to frail and physically looked slower and weak at 145.
The despair that shot through the entire Kiwi CKB, UFC fight fans at the same time. Back to the drawing board for Dan, perhaps that fight of the year damaged him more than anybody realises, he had a few fights in a row that were Smesh fests, and he performed admirably, or in his case, Captainly. We Love you Dan, we dont give a toss about the results, we Love you for the great man and Kiwi that we have come to know thru watching you, most of us will never meet you but the Love is there for you cuzz, and ALL you CKB family, you all have done the flag proud, and we are all sorry for the treatment the foo in charge did to you guys, and the country.   Lets Go Lucinda. The election aint too far away and we will no longer see he Dumbo ears and Mr Ed gnashers. Someone keeps lying to her when they tell her she looks fine with her hair behind those YUGE lugs. Shout out to the irrepressible Tavita Blakamoto esq, the glue of team Izzy.     https://youtu.be/X2PP7et-DHg
People on here with the weight cut excuse for dan losing lol Give allen his props he pieced him up
Izzy so cringe with his nasty French tips. So weird
Oh Dan Hooker🤦‍♂️
it’s so awesome watching them! they’re just buddies hanging out like all of us
"I'm a sushi roll☺"  *Woman dies
I thought the same thing that it was stopped a little to early but at the same time maybe he was to out of it frim that shot I couldn’t see his eyes but also having a reason to stop it first thing for the home team may be a thing too
Dave's laugh is gold. 🤣
Izzy don't hate on till cause we all know khamzat is his boy and we all know he would smesh you bro
Izzy: "He was fed....you know what if you don't have anything nice to say..."  Me: Yes, we all know that Paddy was fed a bum. LOL
Izzy attempting an English accent, sounds exactly like us English folk attempting an Indian accent!! 🇬🇧🇮🇳
Funny when i saw till climb the cage i felt the same way as izzy “get the fuck down, it’s not your moment” 😂
common.... Dan was anything but fine !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Their humor is fucking hilarious😂😂
What is the rule in MMA. I'm coming from boxing and you have to stop a fight when the fighter does not protect himself or he gets punished for multiple rounds.  Hooker had his hands up and it was the first round i don't understand why the fight was stopped  Hooker took more punishment against Poirier. He was hurt against Allen but nothing to stop a fight  Bad stoppage but the world becomes softer and these early stoppages will not get critized
He was fine ref... Dan's face literally melting off
Whats with the finger nails???
That line about Darren was good, but hooker is even more of a clown but you won’t mock your boy
Obviously IZZY didn't watch Ilia tapuria's fight he was busy sandwiching his mate 😜. That fight was crazy
Dan is such an amazing fighter, it’s such a shame to see a great person and fighter lose and having his head hang low
Izzy tell your boy to retire
What's Dan gonna do now?maybe see if izzy can use his influence and get him a few cans so doesn't get cut as dana won't like him going down a weight and still losing
Dan looked super drained after the weight cut,
Did u really not watched Ilia? Cmon bro, he is a young promise and always goes for the finish
Hooker is like 1-4. He’s washed bro, talk to your boy
Pain for Dan hooker
Hey man I'm from UK and didn't want Dan or Aronld to lose but that's the fight game
Bro the ROAST on Darren Till was fkn hilarious 😂 cmtfu 💀💯 I was fkn shattered yesterday man but today's a new day Dan Hooker all the way.
Food look good as hell
That Mokaev submission was MENTAL & SUPER quick !!!  What a fight to start off the Night with !!! 🤯
Dan's literally been fighting straght killers , and i know that's what he'd prefer but they need to feed him some unranked fighters
Thanks for another great video izzy Uzumaki 🙏🏽🙌🏾
If I win you win....right...😂🤣😂🤣👏😂....good fight Till
“What the fuck ref” “He was fine” Dan was not fine lmao
BIG UP TO THE GUY WHO ASKED THE UKRAINE STUFF! SLAVA UKRAINE!
What a card man. Great showcase for the Brits! 🇬🇧
Salty
0:47 ayyy I made it in a an Izzy video lol
Blackamoto got bars
Hooker is a savage, if he can male 170 it might be time for that. I hope he gets another fight
Why blackamoto was your cameraman? Am I wrong? He's the star!
Gyno gyno gyno shaking in the air
4:18 that hurt 🤕 everyone forsure.
sucks to see the fall of hooker man :( this has to be the end, he cant keep walking forward getting staunched
I hope Dan takes 1 year off & trains with Izzy to bulk up & grow a titty ...., he needs it 💪😉.
this was funny
that type of armbar Ass Tompinal pulled off was insane, I've never seen anything like it.
StyleBender got them sweet battimon nails.
You can tell izzy knows Dan could absorb shots like that which is sad
Have you seen Jujutsu Kaisen 0 yet??
Dave is not regular 🤣
"distance, distance" it's crazy how Adesanya and Volkanovski have such great defense in their striking but Dan has zero defense, he's blocked everything with his chin for so long that he doesn't even know what to do when he's getting touched, you can only teach someone what they're willing to learn.
4:07 my exact reaction g
The Poitier fight ruined him
Damn man the butt page 😂😂😂😂😂
I felt awful when Dan got murdered !!!   Not as much as Dan himself I am sure ...   🙏🙏🙏
De way una dey chop egg plenty we for award una wit Ghana citizenship make you all get access to beta jollof 🌚
💡🙏😳 Yea that Dan Hooker fight hurt me inside 😞 But he will be Ok he is a True Warrior 👊🏻
Paddy is cool haven’t seen his fight yet
It's sad to see Dan lose. I always pray for Dan to welcome back Conor win or lose he deserves that fight at 170.
Dan should probably focus more on wrestling/grappling going forward.
' some people get fed ... 🍑🍑🍑 ' !!!   🤣🤣🤣
We gonna get a vid on your time overseas from UFC273 to now?
Trolled Darren lovely 😂😂😂
Blackamoto with the disrespect on darren still a loser 😂😂but the truth hahahahahahahahaha
Izzy man I respect that your love for Dan is much greater than my own but watch that fight back… that wasn’t the Hangman in there. He was off. What about Welterweight hooker?
Such a stupid move to suck himself dry and move down to featherweight to fight smaller guys.. Hooker should of moved up to welterweight hes already a big guy.
David lowkey stealing the show hahahah
“Some people get fed” _cuts to brunch_ 😂
I get you like hooker Izzy but bro it got stopped good and idk wym by he sees everything he saw it but wasn’t moving his head as usual and was gettin bopped around because of how fast they are down there hooker should’ve went up
Izzy you see the riot at Glory?
Paddy wasn't in his home town was in his home country
I'm still crying about dan 😢
@izzy get Dan to take some time off 9 months .
Happy to say this is the first event I ever attended, unreal night! UK fans are the best, we need more UK fight cards
Yea man I was really disappointed after the Hooker fight. That's a really tough loss for a really great guy. Fuck this sport is tough, and I don't just mean physically.
5:52 that was savage lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣 That darren diss by your brother was hilarious
i love izzy but what you talkin bout "come on ref" lmao
Hooker sucks time to retire
I understand not wanting to get into politics, but the Russian/Ukraine situation is a touchy one.  Should’ve cut that bit out; laughing about it isn’t a good look.
that was a mayweather sr. rundown of the fights.. greatness
When is Dan actually gonna win a fight? We may never know
"ref he was fine" Dan getting pummeled
I know Dan is Izzys’ boy, but he definitely wasn’t fine. Personally, I thought it was a really good stoppage. It’s hard to see Dan fall like this. Such a top geezer. He’s been fed to the lions in a way. Literally takes no easy fights. Hopefully it’s not too late to build him back up.
Crying at them mocking Till lmaooo
Izzy really said "c'mon ref" as if it was an early stoppage couple seconds more and he would've been out
Poor hooker 1-4
You wanted to see your boy Dan die didn’t you lmao
I love Izzy and Dan but that was no early stoppage in my opinion. Much respect to Dan for always stepping up and giving the people a show.
7:07 caught me off of guard xD
Izzy blaming the ref🤣🤣 i agree izzy. He should have let hooker take more of a beating.
I guess we all were waiting for dan to shoot a bloody takedown and recover, but he looked drained and kind of lost
The nails🤔
Let's talk about that Hollandaise man, thicc
❤️ from the emerald Isle 🇮🇪
Lol "urkanie and russia....."
Would have liked to see the reaction to Paul Craig's fight.  That triangle was a thing of beauty.
Aspinall has me excited to actually watch HW
I’m sure Izzy was sad yesterday.  I feel so bad for Dan.. That stuff was kind of garbage, all he was doing is punching his gloves. Years back this would’ve never been stopped like that.
Bro that laugh after “he’s not won in a while” was a violation 💀😂
Izzy always hyping up the darren fight. I love it
Israel, what’s going on with that hooker? What a mess!
Hollandaise.... Yummy.
The best part for me, is seeing a bunch of dudes hanging out together, having a gourmet style meal and laughter all around. Hip hip for Masculinity!
I’m surprised Izzy knows about the bus wankers😂😂😂love that
feel so bad for hooker
Izzy Khamzat is going to have a word with you about roasting Darren 🤪
where is Jeff????????
Sorry Dan lost my man I was really pulling for him too and I have been for a while my heart breaks for him but he's strong he will come back and do something big he's a pro in this game, respect! Nice vid and reaction!
" He hasn't won in a while, let him enjoy it" 🤣😂🤣 That shit got me rolling
Man I feel so bad for Hangman. He hasn’t been Dan in a while now
Where is topuria fight?
you didnt react to ilia topuria fight and he was the best on the card xD
David is Buu.
Nice
“Cmon ref he was fine” 💀 ik it’s in the moment thing but I just found that funny
Great it was
Just liked before i watched cause i know its gonna be fire boii
They missed the most roller coaster fight, the Topuria-Herbert was the real FOTN.
CKB has done Dan wrong. I wanted the 145 cut to work, but it seems to have affected him more than anyone realised and that points to a problem in the camp preparation. He also needs to take time off, his schedule has been ridiculous. Chandler, Poirier, Islam... He's made crazy good money, why not sit tight and regroup.. maybe make himself into a stronger/bulkier 155er.
Did nobody catch the "Bush doesn't like black people" in the background? Kanye reference lol. 7:18
Respectfully ref Dan was not fine you did the right call
GEORGE BUSH DOESN'T LIKE BLACK PEOPLE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 YOU GUYS ARE CLASS
Dan just wasn't himself even in the backroom warming up you could tell his mind was somewhere else.
No idea why hooker went down. He was average at fw. He was a top 10 in lw , the most stacked division in the ufc which carries more prestige than other divisions. Like literally, why mummify yourself to go down to fw? Because he got destroyed by Islam? So does everyone.
Colby coming 4U
Darren Till was trying to rewrite that Jorge Masvidal ending 😂
Nasheee
The LADS
The Kiwis and Aussies love their own just like the British. Touches the heart seeing one of their own lose. Dan is a legend though the British love his style and heart. God bless the man
So many people saying Dans weigh cut affected him but in reality he just sucks
Come on dude I like Hooker but he got smoked
You're rich enough for a wall mount playboy!
Dan has To go back to lightweight
When Aspinall won my first thought was I want to see him fight Gane. The Tai callout was kind of weak, not becuase Tais trying to fight stipe, but he wants the clout of fighting him.  Tai vs Tom is a boring fight to me. I'd like to see him take on someone with a move diverse skillset like a Gane.
145 seems like too much to cut for Dan, probably affected his chin
Big Dan fan but man since that Dustin fight he just hasn’t been the same. Reminds me of Ferguson vs gaethje. I was telling my friends Arnold Allen is going to steamroll Dan and that’s what happened. Hopefully he takes a lot of time off
HE SEES EVERYTHING!
Sorry izzy but dan was not fine
I love him but Dan wasn't stopped early. Wobbled several times and ended up, back to the cage, not moving,  completely covered up, eating strikes. Ref more then justified to pull him out
And tbf on paddy London is not hid home town you get paddy in Liverpool you will see a crowd like never before stylebender
darren got bullied lol
5:53 David man😂😂😂😂
Hate to say it but your boy was getting smoked and he was not fine.
The ultimate trajectory of a fighter can come down to one moment. For Dan, rounds 3-5 versus Poirier unfortunately seems to be that moment. At his best, he can hang with the best, but isn’t the best.
Darren was just tryna hype the crowd and enjoy the moment with his boy cmonnnn
BAKE BACON !!!! thank me later
Me and Izzy wanna see that fight with GANE bad. Yall can sit back and call it boring while we sit back and enjoy the art.
I was at the event, every fighter fighting a British person got boo'd walking out except Dan Hooker
The editing is elite
A hate seeing your reaction to when your teamates loose and I hope Dan is okay🥺
Damn, I was rooting for Dan so hard.
The Meatball laid the marinara on super thick with that spinning elbow.🙊
Sorry Izzy, but Dan got fucked up. I wanted him to win too, but Allen looked good
I didn't know you were watching with Kanye haha. As usual Dave blackamoto asking them controversial questions, trying to get a fight with Darren till
Dan hooker hasn't been the same since taking all that damage from Dustin he looked very slow abaird to Allen. Dan is still a very good fighter he's had war after war and taken the hard fights he needs to stop taking the hard fights and get a few wins again then go have another go at top guys.
Fyi paddy was not fighting in his hometown, Liverpool (north west) is at the other end of the country than London (south east) .
I was heartbroken
The U.K. ran house last night, huh?!? Damn...Molly, Paddy, Arnold, and Tom.
The music after Dan lost was a nice touch. Very somber
Don't worry guys, I've been an Allen fanboy since 2017 and I can tell you that he is going to fight for the title if UFC lets him fight higher ranked opponents. That loss ain't gonna look bad at all at the end of the day for Dan Hooker.
I think Dan took the fight abit too early.
Glad to see Till walk away with that W
Bro cut ur nails
Hooker was getting smoked you’re deluded
We live in a world were you can beat the breaks off a 145 pound Hooker in front of millions of people and get paid for it. The Pimps won that night. #openyoureyes
It's a good stoppage for Dan's fight, sad but not early stoppage. Don't really want Dan to take that much damage, still it's sad to see Hooker losed
Izzy is literally the GOAT, my favourite fighter by far
Man David is the funniest muhphucka on the planet! Lol he said have a heart lol!!!
I cringed myself inside-out when Till bombed Aspinall's moment.
Dan got fucked up Izzy simple as that
Keep the content coming IZZY we love this my brotha!! 👊🏽🙌🏽
I feel that grunt when Izzy saw Dan lost... more like dude not again
nah they violated darren lmao
It's almost weird seeing someone from New Zealand referencing The Inbetweeners, it's so British I can't imagine it being watched anywere else.
Izzy move to Dagestan plz
bruh u just skip most beautiful fight in this card topuria vs herbert !
Stop mocking Darren 😂
Dan gets hit too much. With training with Izzy why is his defence not better?
I felt like the Dan stoppage was a bit early but still he got dominated.
i was there in attendance for the event and the crowd was going fucking crazy whenever the smallest thing happened, but it was still incredible to be there, seeing it live. When someone wins in there it's just incredible hearing the audience light up.
Why not sent Dan to 170? He's got the frame!
I don’t care if he doesn’t deserve it, this ah the reason we need to see Israel adesanya vs Darren till in the UK. The atmosphere would bang
Na i wouldnt saying Till stole the limelight from Tom. All the photos online are just Aspinall and Till let Tom soak it in for a bit then jumped on top with Tom after Tom got down and got the crowd to cheer louder for Aspinall. I don't blame him cause a) they are good friends and it is a fair response, and b) It was a MASSIVE W for UK MMA so having the two biggest UK fighters above the crowd made it all the night more symbolic.
Izzy rock a iced out Naruto headband would be fiiiiire
Where was Ilia Topuria’s fight reaction? That knockout was the best!!
Maybe Dan can couch full time?
been waiting all day for this!!
“He’s not won inna while, let him enjoy it” killed me!😂😂💀
Darren "Social Leech" Till
💯
Who else clicked on this just to see izzy's reaction to dan hooker...
dan was the only fight i got wrong on my 7 fight parley I was pissed I kinda had a feeling he was going to lose to I don't think it was the weight cut I just think his time has come and gone as one of the top guys
Adesanya cursed Dan by talking shit about paddy
It’s nice to finally have non-PPV’s with fans again.
Izzy I feel like you would love Acronym Clothing, check them out.
Had a feeling this video was going to gloss over an extremely disappointing performance from Dan. Guy was blankly staring into the distance at the start and then frozen on his feet during the fight. Frustrating night to be a Hooker fan.
Dan gonna comeback he is going through god's toughest exam...but this guy doesn't give up he is going to be back🤫
It sucks to say but hooker is just a stepping stone for upcoming and promising prospects that need a name on their resume
“He’s not won in a while let him enjoy it” Lol savage
How the mood changes at yours is exactly the same as my house and many others. Done with the rest of the card. Leave me alone I’m going back to bed 😭 Dan ain’t done tho.
Appreciate Dan for always putting on a show. He'll come back stronger and I already feel pity for his next opponent
Come on Izzy I know it’s your boy but man Dan didn’t look good in there. I wonder whether it’s been a good idea to drop down in weight. He looked fragile to me. He should have gone up in weight instead of gone done.
Dan hooker a a beast kind of fast finish but is what it is hope hooker keeps fighting he will turn it around
Dan is super talented he’ll come back stronger after this one. Did you see Connor mcgregor wants to fight kamaru?!?! What ya think about that?
Dan being wobbled so much is crazy
Dan better stay in lightweight or move up to welterweight. Your body does not like to be cut weight like that
Damn Izzy Dan got destroyed that was sad respect man
D Till with the W
honestly didn’t think we were gonna see this video because the hangman lost
😎🤙🏾
He wasn’t fine...
The hangman will rise again (probably not but wish him the best)
Hooker looked terrible
Aspinall had the best performance but molly was definately a fight to watch!
Dan Hooker !!
I RESPECT YOU IZZY YOU NEED TO RESPECT THE MEATBALL!!!!  SORRY ABOUT UR BOY HOOKER I WAS ROOTING FOR HIM TOO
No Topuria reaction?
Big fan of hooker izzy, but saturday belonged to the brits 🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Time for Dan Hooker to retire, man's hasn't been the same since Dustin Poirier put him in hospital
That Illia Topuria ko was insane. 😰
Dan Hooker is finished in the UFC its 100% confirmed now he's a gatekeeper and now everybody knows it too
hangman might be getting cut soon
Gutted for Dan 😢 I hope he goes up to 170
Izzy, your nails look SUS 🤣🤣🤣
Izzy I love you and all of CKB. I wish Dan would have moved up to 170 or Eugene put his foot down and forbade him to go to 145. 1000% saying this out of concern for his health. Hasn’t made the cut in 6 years … 26 to 32 will change a man’s body. All my love to CKB and I wish Dan a proper recovery.
He’s from Liverpool not London
Heartbreaking seeing Dan lose but Arnold's all class, and one hell of a fighter. Tom looks like the future of the HWs and Paddy is incredibly fun to watch.
Watching that CEO Video interview now. Quick break to watch another great reaction episode.
Man it sucks being a Dan supporter. Would love to see him make a comeback but I think it’s very likely the beginning of the end.
Freestylebendrr getting koed by Robert THE Reaper
Felt so sad seeing Dan lose like that. Made me tear up a little lol
It was a fight where I wanted the best man to win but at the same time I wanted Dan Hooker to win.
I think Dan should take some time off,  chill with his family for a while and really work on his defense both striking and grappling. Hard to see him so sluggish
Why you do my boy Till like that
These are dope
This card was better than most PPVs.   Actually the best card of the year so far imo
Did Till dirty 😭😭
Man....those poached eggs on muffins with avocado, bacon and hollandaise are to die for....
It was heartbreaking to see Dan sitting on that stool like that, the weight cut really affected him
Hard luck Dan
Tommy Aspinall is a future champion mark my words.  He will go down as the greatest heavyweight of all time.  This man is ELITE everywhere.  He had absolutely zero holes.  Any of these muppets can get it.  I love everything about him, his vibe is so hot.  👊🇬🇧
Ya Dan got obliterated
I was actually hoping the ref would stop the fight, never seen Dan so wobbled so many times in such a short span like that.
THIS IS REALLY CRAZY
Buzzing for the UK lot but commiserations to the Hangman he’s the real deal! Class bloke, would love to buy him a pint 🍻
Great showcase card can’t wait for APRIL 9th
IZZYYYYYY, lets dominate this camp and see if any new weapons come out to play in the next fight.... superman punch ;)... do it for anime brotha
Poor Dan.. maybe welterweight?!
PADDYS A MACHINE

Totally the best fight night Card ever!!! Even more than many PPV.  Head up for Dan Hooker, he's the true BMF. Greetings from Spain!!!!
Wannanow
What’s next for the champ then?
Was at the event. Felt so sorry for Dan to see him lose like this and especially seeing him walking away with a towel covering his face
What was your fight of the night?
Keep grinding Izzy big fan man!
Damn i feel so bad for hooker
Feel for my boy Dan😭
