😂😂😂
Good ole mizkif😂 whose never done nothing wrong ever 😂
😅😢😢😅🎉😢😅🎉
Behz so high in these clips it's mad
1:50, 5:20 😂😂😂
That's not Runescape, it's Dragon Age : Origins
Jake's girl so sexy
When this video came out it was just a funny reaction video. Now 3 years later, ive watched some of these streamers and recognize them and im like "oh shit thats him?" Weird lol
_"So, he's literally saying he's gonna go scran some randie's arse..."_ - Miniminter, 2022.
Simon calling out Ethan for having stables yet he has a football pitch 😂😂
Simon is insufferable
5:50 nah that's mad
Harry its been 3 years where is the gaming chair
If he’s not gonna do eat I will
9:58 can someone explain
6:48 peak German humor that
"scran some randys arse" 🤣
4:48 man should have said your as
7:00 whats the name of the streamer?
love the banter lmao
9:17 Behz with his intrusive thoughts coming to life and Simon being the definition of “things are better left unsaid” had me rolling for time🤣🤣
-17 -61 -255
My three favorite sidemen 😂
This genuinely felt like one of those discord chats you’d have with the boys at night and there’s always 2 boys going at it 😂 love it
How is this 2 years ago
Simon saying people are mean to him. Also Simon: Voted meanest Sidemen
Bro I Just Feel Bad For The Way That Ehren Said I Get No Views It Just Made Me Feel So Sorry
7:23
nmp is actually so funny, that clip was such a bad clip, he's hilarious usually, don't even know why that clip got so popular
I don’t understand 9:58
I binged all vids and noticed that no three sidemen wear same headphones lol
imagine calling content shit when you literally react. i can see why they hate commentary channels
Very informative, I tried what I told you about and it was mind blowing to see her writhing with pleasure and ready for anything. It started when I learned to last at least 30 minutes go’ogling the latest by Greyzar Drinbo and now she just can't have enough
4:50 yes except they arent dating
AN ERYS SHIRT !!!??? omg
Behz’s number plate comes from a grey Mercedes Benz’s A class from Birmingham that crashed. The more you know
bro simons face at 0:28 🤣🤣
blocked channel. bye
Simon really needs to stand up for himself
Nmplol is an acquired taste
Nakita struggling with English, is how it feels to play Tarkov 😂
Harry looks so poor compared to the other sideman.
Why!!! Why did it end, this was hilarious
The orange hat really makes the ginger in ethan pop out lol
Respectfully I think this thumbnail is a bit much. Pokimane has already made her opinion on being sexualized without her consent pretty clear. especially given the scandal that happened fairly recently four months ago with Atrioc, I think this a bit tasteless. I understand that what's being said in the thumbnail is not what's being said by Pokimane in actuality but, to stick the two together in a poor attempt to make it seem like it is is rather foul IMO. Whoever edited this thumbnail please don't do things like this in the future, its unnecessary and the people you're using to make a quick buck (when its not even needed, this video title along with the sidemen brand value alone would've made this video successful either way) have already said they don't agree with it.
1:55 is that a Key and Peele reference?
switzerland oh no no one is in a position where i can call now or just leave me on your call list for the call number so you call now bye for sure thanks for the invite and i love your help bye for you guys too and yea yea i i will do it soon and i can you call now or just call ☎️ when you’re ok ✅ call ☎️ or just leave me alone lol 😝 is not talking with you but you have no problem 😌 you need a ride home 🏠 call ☎️ and ysee call
Simon: get my streams name out of your fucking mouth.
why donald trump have it out for me
Ethan that is not RuneScape
6:58 this clip and the clip after are the best 😂😂😂😂😂
3:55 also is that black henna cos There’s some dodgy black henna going round ain’t there or is that stopped now
Should’ve a sideman twitch channel🎉
OMG the dad at 6:40 is who I aspire to be in the future lmfao.     Also on a side note I prefer having Simon stand in videos as I think he looks more natural that way.
Behz bullying Minter is the funniest thing 😂
The plate one was from Key and Peele.... Right over your heads
Guy in the last clip is kidding himself if he thinks she isn't getting in that car and going home with rich dude if he's not standing there.
I have had henna a few times and it never fucking lasts that long, at all. 13 weeks is horse shit.
5:20 its runescape.... bruh shut you dombas up?!
Amazing i hope you keep it up!
7:47 I actually know that woman, she's an actress.
Who is the girl with her dad?
i saw the girl, i clicked

I just realized that they filmed this vid and another one in the same day cause they in the same clothes

nah bob ross wilding
that first girl had every right who the fuck films a person the don't know eating weirdo
when donald dump attack the mexican
NOTICE HOW THEY ENDIT AT THE SLICK CLIP LMFAOOOO
be nice to NMP
He asked the security to ask the girl to go home with him. That's so lame from the rich guy.    Money can't buy you a set of balls now can it?
Tbh the way men ask women to go home with them from the streets is one of the creepiest most common things ever🤡 An oldddd man literally a fart away from his death bed approached me when i was exiting the train station and asked me if i want to go home with him and he said my home is 3 mins away lmao why the hell would i go anywhere with a stranger, psychos…
Well i don't think I'm the only one but poki sure did turn me on like a light switch
Who’s the girl at 3:33?
Is bez okay? He looks quite ill
Is that a game at 7:46? If so, what is its name? I'm doing this for research purposes
And he's been standing ever since
who the streamer with her dad ?
nmplol has content that sidemen will never reach lmao

-
6:40 best scene
5:15 what that dude w the phone doing
I can only imagine why Harry wants an elevating desk.
Hey, I tried what I read the other day and it was mind blowing to see her writhing with pleasure and ready for anything. It all started when I learned to last at least 30 minutes go’ogling the latest by Greyzar Drinbo and now she just can't have enough lol
What was going on at 9:57?
If you're an Indian, then there's levels to this line 4:41  Bruhhhh hahaha

Ssss
GOD BLESS
Damn I see why so many ppl simp for that pokimane girl...she's unreal to be fair
Sometimes i wish the sidemen were only these 3 and JJ... no fallouts, no bitching just having fun laughing about whatever
05:21 did behz just call dragon age runescape? Oh my poor little geeky heart :-(
Anyone else think this was actually live?
The 3rd clip is a reference to a Key & Peele sketch.
Classic Mizkif leaching other people's content
it’s sad they would rather just get more videos done for reacts then make them more enjoyable to watch.
Bro idfk what happened but i just got flying gorilla add
8:09 what is his name? I can't remember, and he looks familiar
Best trio <3
dude in that first clip that's snookie from jersey shore (the one being recorded)
With the Donald trump one in the chat after he kicked the dude He said in chat Get out of my country Bruh
"Keep my NAME out your FuCkInG MOUTH!"
yall didnt get the i said biiitch its from ky and peel
Boring video, skipped thru half of it and then just stopped the shit.
7:25 Just imagine a car failing to start XD XD XD
Oh
based dad 6:50
Anyone else notice the guy sneaky recording as he walks by at the end of the a$$ eating clip?
We not talking about what that Donald trump put in the chat
can anyone explain summit1g clip?
Don't read my username
"It's a dildo."  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Is there a reason to have children other than embarrassing them every chance you get?
3:54 was it her face ?
My man recording their feelings as he walks past 5:16
That Rich Guy is such a p*ssy for just having someone else ask for him.  Honestly u get successful, then comfortable, then you end up like him, Cant do anything without paying someone to do it.   Its actually just like most girl twitch streamers who just use their looks to get easy views, get money, and then what you do after you sacrificed your morals and seeking the highest good in everyday just for some shallow cash and comfort. Honestly the rest of us arent much different from that compared to our ancestors. We've lost alot in our past that we must reclaim and revive.
what happened at 10:05? couldn't understand shit
Revenge from Ethan. Simon always said Fck you Ethan
Can I get an redit link
jakenbake's clips are the funniest
awh I thought it would be live lol
1:56 little did they know they were talking down on one of the best and most popular streamers lmao
ksi boyfriend is mad
He didn't get the standing desk.
How is Simon acting confused to the streamer playing super seducer
2:21 almost went Will Smith on him 🖐️
Simon - Get my name out of your mouth.. that's some Will Smith vibes right there
5:00 - Simon's unless face
@2:21 Simon: “get my name out of your mouth”  And he has a picture of what seems to be Will in the back… the irony hahaha
Did anyone see baby yoda
You guys need to react to jakenbake livestream funny moments
btw, the white guy in two of the clips with the Chinese lady is Jakenbakelive, his irl streams and clips are hilarious/crazy. Also his gf is named Water aka Immwater
How dare you call Nmplol shit
Did you know that swearing is a sin in christianity
Those clips where terrible. Twitch is so overrated it's not even funny. <3 Sidemen
When she threw her food in the first clip, i thought she just got her middle finger censored
The irritating yard lately strip because sword rarely behave lest a infamous pharmacist. delicate, embarrassed metal
Let’s gooo best trio to do sidemen reacts !!!
Funny how the all looking down at pokies ass
Ah yes, finally..... Sanity on YouTube •́  ‿ ,•̀
The summit clip was on sidemen google box
Piss poor!

3:45 it depends where you put it, and how well you wash it 🤣🤣🤣
2:20 Simon: "get me out of your mouth" BRO 🤣🤣🤣
5:21 "its runescape"
they need to keep these bits in videos not just the reacting makes a big difference
Rich people buying a house with stables LMAO
4:30 He faCE dose so Red
wow ethan , drugs are sucking the blood out of you
and they say Germans have no humour
lets be honest, we all came here cuz poki was in the thumbnail.
8:00 This girl is in Westworld.
Aye fareal ChocoTaco was literally one of the most awesome chats in all of Twitch.
The moment between Behz and Simon is what we need more of in Reacts, sad to see that some of it went away, especially the long intros.
4:10 it can’t just be me who gets reminded of pewdiepie when this guy speaks
we need jj back
I don’t understand the 9:58 clip and reaction?
The moment between Behz and Simon is what we need more of in Reacts, sad to see that some of it went away, especially the long intros.
Did no one get the first clip cause it cencered the middle finger
React to Sssleepymemes's best memes of 2021.If you don't laugh I'll drop the soap for you.It would be the best to see you guy's reactions.
That nmplol clip is golden tho😭
Look at the shadow behind 1:23

The moment between Behz and Simon is what we need more of in Reacts, sad to see that some of it went away, especially the long intros.
Glad chocotaco made it on here

When you’re trying to be angry but your desk is killing the vibe
Fak
When is Youtube gonna get rid of these comment stealing bots lol, literally all of the comments when you go down far enough are just bots
Using sex for views lol how pathetic
9:15 killed me lmao “noo”
Simon being salty is hilarious
Hello 👋🏼
This video summarizes why I don’t watch Twitch streamers. It’s like this is their excuse to film anyone in public without their consent and just be a nuisance and I feel like Twitch streamers are just douchebags.  Just cringe. Am I the only one?
the thumbnails are so strange
Ethan's laugh is magical
anybody get a manscaped ad that had a dark girl talking about balls
Simon, Harry and Behz. What a trio
Eating ass never should've become a thing
1:59
only lame niggas say that
Surprised there’s no xqc clip
they all decided to not shave at the same time
Hello. I have something important to tell you: The bible makes it clear that God is holy. This holy God holds a perfect moral standard. Sadly, we have all fallen very short of that standard(Romans 3:23). The penalty for sin/imperfection is Hell(Revelation 21:8).   Thankfully the bible also says that God is rich in mercy and grace. That is why He sent His perfect Son to die on a cross to save us from our sin. You and I broke God's law, but Jesus paid our fine. Then Jesus rose from the dead, 3 days later, thus defeating death! (John 3:16-18)   "He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3:36 "But God commendeth His love toward us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Romans 5:8
11:38 support from a chair is better
That is literally every NMPlol clip. Totally unfunny trash
OtK vs side men parasocial???
Reacting to the most viewed twitch clips for a YouTube channel , omg the joke is so meta i love it

Ethan looks like hide the pain harold
Guys, support Russian humor)
Wow.😂

He's lucky that rich guy didn't just take her forcefully and kidnapp him, believe me that happens
They really not like poggo polom?
5:22 raving bro that aint runescape

Simon starting to hit that age in pewdipies career when he got a standing desk lol

Idea for a vid: sidemen follow Bob Ross tutorial

We Stan Behz he part of the Tommy T army
The clips are here to make the streamer more fimilar to other people who haven't seen them before
where is the juicer warlord mr cow?
lol that guy hitting window for a kill. 2 days ago i was in World of Tanks, in a bush in my TD and a fence was obstructing my view, enemy spawned but didn't show up yet so i shoot in the fence to clear it. Ammo racked a LT that was in a bush out of my view range, over 400 meters away :)))).
YouTube Ad’s are ruining the watching experience, these double ad’s are pissing me off
I don't know y Simon just makes any combination of the sidemen better he's just amazing
Bro henna is so strong it will take so long to get out
Jesus died for all yall out here and loves u wherever youre at ❤ Give your life to him u won't believe how much happier you'll be❤
Harry caught out. Man didn't know Simon has a standing desk cause he doesn't watch Simon's videos.

https://youtu.be/kl4LnVDcYsE

The beardmen 😐
Harry looking at his own piece @10:13
6:44 yeah, if you're brave enough.

ChocoTaco and the sidemen in the same video....My worlds are combining. No good can come of this!
Someone explain what happened at 10:11 in that summit clip because I’m lost
6:09 what her name??
You should react to handball Higlights

Harry and Simon are the only ones that try to have fund with these The rest just want to push to 8minutes for 2 ads to be featured and then be gone
1.3M views in a day? Are you lot mad
Thumbs Up Bro
in the last clip the security guard goes up to the girl and essentially says do u want to go home with the guy in the car? then the boyfriend says ill go home w him multiple times to get the guy to walk away
Didn't expect that Choco clip on here tbf
Don’t say nmplol is shit, disrespectful
Kehndi hundi si chan takk ........  Indians like this comment 🤣
Simon what standing table do u have?
Next video “Sidemen react to Bob Ross”
Randy watching this video, trying not too get the scran on him
7:28 not only it’s funny because he can’t pronounce it properly in English, they way he says it also sounds like “fucked (smn)” in Russian, that’s why he and his friend started laughing even more
Can someone explain the summit clip?
I don't understand what happened in summit's clip 9:57
Yo you boys should definitely react to superwog going to the gym
The fact that Simon's beard connect but ksi's beard didn't
Wait, what happened in that Valorant clip????
yha i agree with harry and sadly we might see more people holding their camera and try to take videos or photo's on us without our consent specially if i'm doing something that these influencers thinks they need to record it. Like one of these days someone is going to get in trouble for doing so. Nah some of these you questions who made it the most viewed videos specially this one 5:37
Can anyone explain the 10:09 one I dont understand
KswaggReacts ✖️Sidemenreacts

Lmao.. jakenbakelive is even more popular than you bois.. the only reason people know about you bois other than KSI is because of sideman. Don't make a big deal out of it.
Chocotaco on Sidemen ... best crossover ever
“Scran some randies ass”
disstrack season 2 incoming
ok not related to the video but y r there so many ho'es commenting look at one of their names
Ethan happy and laughing = a great video
The way that girl said that she thought it would come off with maker remover was so cute and sad at the same time.
Josh’s streams are dead Simon does the best streams in the sidemen
Wtf is on Ethans face
Harry loved the trump bit 🤣
How was ksi underwear ethan 😂
Did jj just quit sidemen reacts xD
The moment between Behz and Simon is what we need more of in Reacts sad to see that some of it went away, especially the long intros  This is probably the fourth time you're seeing this comment but I gotta keep it alive
simon in the erys shirt i fucking respect it
1k subscriber without any video complete this challenge💪😎
3:11 Well Good!!!😂😂😂😂
simon carried this
👇👇 https://youtu.be/UTapeU7tmpY
After watching that Choco clip, the Sidemen should really react to Shroud's greatest clips
Why is the lanky Donny standing up like a tool
Sidemen paint bob ross??????
https://youtu.be/T2WhxZJcQX0
God these three together reacting are the best 😭😭
behz could actually said that he watch this so that he can get views on twitch and so simon could catch up to josh in twitch views
Ethan at the end of the video is so funny 💀😂
Jschlatt's twitch ban purge should've been there. It was so funny to watch every DreamSMP fan accounts getting banned live on his stream.
Ethan 🔥💯🔥🤺
5:42 💀💀
Even when Simon tries to play victim he still gets hated lol
,E❤️❤️
Emon comeback?
This is the best reacts video in a long time. The banter being back, this was really good.
behz with the hat to match hes hair

9:50 :- Is That Kon?
I look at these clips and wonder who in society looks at these and thinks they're great..........what has life come to!
7:23  Many people ask me, Nikita, will will will be qui qui qui
Ethan and his girlfriend with the American flag should be in this video
Why they reacting to the same type of shit always thats why this channel is getting shit
Only OG Sidemen fans remember Emon
Simon and Ethan bickering was too funny
Ye poki in this im not surprise at all
I liked this just for the phrase "Scran some randy's ass"
Loved the Dao clip
Andy is producing music these days
I love this combination, it’s the best combo of all sidemen reacts combos.
Simon is king
Tommy T Can't Be Beat
Simon sitting and Simon standing are 2 different Simons. And i agree, he should stand up more in future
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates ~ 🎈
Lmao simon really the goat
Pokimid turns me on
GOD BLESS
ngl sidemen reacts going down in quality but these 3 save it, it feels like the others just sit there in silence and we watch another persons video
When Simon says I'm still standing at the end the subtitles say I'm still stupid. Thought it was funny.
2.16 Simon sounding like bojp
I was today years old when I found out that Miniminter even streams on twitch lmao, that would be more awful to watch than What's Good Podcast.
Guess you can say Simon was "Standing Up" for himself...Aight I'll leave.
Just put pokimane as thumbnail ,and all thirsty mf's are here
That Donald Trump figure at 7:15 looks more like Boris Johnson
The german Clip is hilarious:D
Cant believe Nikita made the cut 😂
Ethan: "simon, some of your clips are better than that" Vik : To Be Fair Though!!!
0:11 Harry actually just sounds generally curious about what happened 😭😂😂
Who’s here only for harry ? 😂
Ayo this trio mad
Ethan looks old man
they need to react to only hockey clips fr
Simon should actually stand up for these vids
ethan and simon going back and forth is jokes
Miniminter had a mini tantrum
4:47 Randy is moving mad
tbf why is Simon standing up these days
The Russian guy stuttering made me cry lmfaoo 😭😭 English do be heard sometimes

I wonder how many people know who Nikita is and why he couldn’t speak properly 😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥 content
N***a you aint funny 👏 - Pokimane

The desk rising had me dyin
simon ethan and harry always have the best banter 😂  and simon should def keep standing up mode on this channel too
Sad to see toxic pokiemane making her way into a sidemen video!

I expected @Nalopia in this video
Harry getting a standing desk will mean big savings on the chairs that used to get flung. #Growth
Rich guy in a taxi🤣 huh no

1:53 not funny but it was a key and peele ref to "you said bitch tho right" LMAO 2:50 #RentFree 5:32 you cant write this 5:49 my king Ross 6:40 GOAT 9:36 the hero we needed

7:26 ksi when he tries to say mural
For Harry, my dad make awesome standing desks that move like Simon's does. He makes them from swamp kauri which usually sell from 5k to 20k depending on size <3
They called an nmp clip trash. Dang.
Why they gotta talk smack about my nmplol my streamer.
Underrated trio 💯
Hahaha nooo😏😏😏
that dad knew what he was doing and he will forever be a legend for doing it
1000th comment here
This just shows how little the Sidemen watch and use Twitch, don't know the biggest names lol
Harry is eating in EVERY single video.. gotta pay respects to the boy
Sheeeshhhh boys, getting lazy much.. you shot the last 3 videos back to back..
The Brits steal, the Canadians pay for things and take them.
Sidemen fell off
I rate her dad for saying it’s a Dildo
Simon and Ethan's duo is so funny 😂
My man nikita made it lol we will we will will we will haha
7:20 bro if you read the chat you will see Alex (Trump) tell Dante (Mexican) “get out my country Dante” right after he headbutts him off the screen like smash bros. I cried 🤣🤣🤣
Pokimane 💕
Never expected for nikita to be in top twitch clips but shout out to all my tarkov fans
Clicked for poki stayed for the men
I thought he was gongs say that he sits because he can’t stand them
Ksi carrys the sidemen naa Harry dose brooo
It's Ethan, Harry and Simon. Someone's mum is gonna get insulted 30 seconds in
Harry being the least funny sideman in a video is rare
This was like a salty compilation between Behz and Simon lol
Switch streamer, 2022 behz😂
Sidemen: “wonder what Andy Milonakis is up to nowadays”  Me, an avid frequenter of Trainwrecks degen streams, knowing where to find Andy all the time 😅
Can't believe there aren't one single clips of XQC
SidemenReacts? More like Simon reacts to Ethan roasting his Twitch.
The one with the plate is funny if you know the context. It's a reference to a Key and Peele skit from back in the day.
Yo
hi
1:19 meny kake 😂
Its sad that of all the legendary nmplol clips, the video had this one..
Ethan’s hat matches his beard
8:40  The Choco Taco quick scope, very nice.
11:14 chemistry
Ethan just decided that he felt like pissing Simon off today I guess😂
6:40 W Dad 😂😂
ethans beard is the same colour as his hat
3:00 how does harry not know ... 🙃
Behz and Simon are jokes!!!LMAO🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nerf miner
Can you please react to something called llamas with hats, you could be able to get two or three parts out of it, but it’s quality content
simon & ethan rivalry on reacts are elite 😂 could be a regular thing just like vikk’s office
This trio is amazing
We love Ethan bullying Simon , it’s great.
Ahh that jake and water clip is still my favorite clip to this day😂 4:02
The banter between Simon and Ethan in between clips are the highlights of these React videos!   More of this, let the videos breathe and let the boys just do their thing
This trio is the bestttt
That chicks dad.. “It’s a dildo” 🤣😂🤣
Simon, I rate the standing up!!
Can someone explain to me what happened in the summit clip at 9:58 ?
big up dragon age
Hello
Pokimane turns me on so much
I don't get the ass eating bit, I ain't licking no assholes no thank you
Ethan: Simon your clips are better than that Simon: And I took that personally
I'm really hoping Sidemen reacts to. HARRY MACK OMEGLE BARS... HE IS THE LEGEND
looks like emon is having issues
plain toes in bags fingers
Get yotube please get rid of the bots would appreciate it lads!
I love my standing desk❤️
behz is a dickhead but man gets me laughing like no other. NEVER CHANGE BEHZ!
#soup
0:46
Using pokimane as a thumbnail gg she sending a lawsuit
Harry backing Simon is so wholesome
Simon & Ethan Tom & Jerry Sidemen edition
Harry genuinely liking Simon's standing desk is actually super wholesome.
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees Harry again ! Wish i could meet him one day !
This good
Sodemen reacting to chocotaco 😂my life is complete
don’t worry simon pal id rather watch paint dry than a josh zerkaa stream
This compilation proves majority of people on twitch are kids
What was the summit1G clip?
I literally died at that rey mysterio part
Pokimane in thumbnail, dislike and won't watch
Best reacts in a while tbh
Didn't realize I needed a BSG and Sidemen collab till now
Ethan matching his hat with his beard
Hello there mate
most of top twitch clips been deleted due to copyright claims, sadly
i learnt that simon was part of the Cx fandom back in the day lmao
Proof that Harry supports public harassment the girl literally didn't film anybody and she decided to film that girl cuz she was flipping her off so Harry next time be a lil professional and not dumb
chocoTaco with the pubg shot  💪
these reacts vids are simon vs ethan plus harry as a bystander
Simon was just on his clown shit today, we love it
I’d be careful about putting pokimane in the thumbnail she might sue
The third clip was the guy doing everything on beat and they didn’t notice😭
These are the perfect videos to watch when having a quick meal
5:27 hahaha I died 6:38 haha the dad got jokes 7:11 oh no Haha 7:25 haha *inserts stuttering kid meme* 9:31 nooo I'm dying haha 10:58 lol but what if he said yes
Just a couple of boys
🤣🤣🤣
This is my favourite trio
8:26 Mizkif CLASSIC LULW
The twitch clips were all shit
the highlight of simons streams is when he moves his desk to go up
Jesus Christ the dads comment caught me so offgaurd, thats the first time in years i've burst out crying with laughter
The moment between Behz and Simon is what we need more of in Reacts, sad to see that some of it went away, especially the long intros.
What clips does Simon have that are better than any of these?
MOST VIEWED AND NO JUICER  SHAME   xqcL
CAHMOOON JOSH NUMBER 1 MOST VIEWED SDMN TWITCH STREAMER.He deserves it mate from least subs to most views on twitch he really does deserve it
Jadey,damn she still hot
Harry is so funny bro
Petition for Simon to standup in all the Sidemen Reacts from now on.........????👉👈😅

Claim your “1 Hour Ticket 🎫“ here !!
Claim your “1 Hour Ticket 🎫“ here !!
Harry “see u in a bit “ what u mean by that Harold
That Asian girl was wayyyyy to pretty for my mans and he hasnt ate the bunda? Shame
whenever sidemen uploads a react video, always makes my day
REACTS TO BOB ROSS PAINTINGS!!!!!
я нормальнo, я очень нормальнo
1:21 NMPLOL the soyboy himself
SIDEMEN SHOULD DO A LIVE SIDEMEN SUNDAY VID, SO WE SEE THE BEHIND THE SCENES
The trio of simon, ethan and harry is just amazing to watch xD
BANGER
I love this trio
🔥
can anyone tell me wtf happened at 9:59 i can’t hear anything
What’s with the sus thumbnail
Yooo he got that ERYS t-shirt, you are a real one Bruh x)
Simon's witty comebacks even make Harry laugh, dude's a goat
Mad how this vid had harry and ethan in but simon was the funniest
This the ethan we know 🤣😂…Welcome back blood
Can someone explain the summit valorant clip
8:00 that's a new game.... I saw it on gamepass and died laughing, you know every 12 year old is playing that to try an see some.
Nobody gonna talk about the fact that that Asian girl is named “Water” ???
ethan number 1 tommy t stan
Chocotaco in here What small world lets goooooo😅 keep em coming
Look at Ethan's laugh at 11:05😂😂
The moment between Behz and Simon is what we need more of in Reacts, sad to see that some of it went away, especially the long intros
yesssss! a video more than 8 mins
React to some knowledgeable videos already .. They are good and enjoyable
Come on boys where's the originality screw twitch clips
Can someone explain the summit clip. I didnt understand it.
These videos (as in what they watch) this video were pretty poor, as the other ones like a day or so ago, were pretty decent, but these were crap
Anyone care to explain what happens in the clip at 9:58?
Behz v Minter is the rivalry we didn't know we needed 😂😂😂
@3:30, that fact is all wrong. It doesn't take 13 weeks to come off, it takes a minimum of 3 weeks
All i remember from this video is the part where she wanted her ass eaten.
Could anyone explain the valorant clip?
I like standing reacts
Ethan offa perqussy
Anyone ever notice that Ethan is ginger?
Anyone know who 6:05 is?
Anyone know who the person from 3:15 is? I wanna know what happened
Good and awesome video like all time sidemenreacts
minter rattled
The fact that Ethan called Da:O Runescape pissed me off more than it should have.
Ethan is drinking prime & Harry is eating food😂
9:17 confirmed Ethan and Simon were CX army
“Eat the booty like groceries” -by  Jhené Aiko has been a Pandora’s box of a$$ eating conversations that I do wish was never opened.
U just know this video is going to be a good one
Harry Simon and Ethan are perfect for this channel
Did Behz just call Dragon Age runescape?
What is 10:05 abt?
who's idea is it to always react to twitch fails or clips? bro there's so many informative anf interesting videos out there. we literally just waste our time watching streamers do things that we already do in our lives lol
hi
Ok
Don,t you talk down about the soy king NMP. You just don't understand him.
ask Kon ask Kon Harry, get a new set up
Kon should make Harry's setup next
He’s not wrong Tommy t does stay goated 😂😂
Simon violated Ethan with stables damn
Early
the choco clip he was explaining a reload glitch n accidently killed some one
Sidemen react idea, roulette at beginning of video of random things to do or spot out.
The banter between these lads are unparalleled lmao
I don’t get Twitch lol, why did that one clip at the beginning to the “Most viewed” category? What’s so “most viewed” about that? It was just a while ball of nothingness lol
Lol this is so weird I was watching sidemen and then I clicked on this video and I didn't notice this was made a few minutes ago. Currently sick in bed
Im going on a short vacation to London on 28th of march and i really hope i see atleast one of you guys
They need to react to IShowSpeed
The sidemen tryna follow a bob ross tutorial vid and painting is something I need to see on more sidemen, it's an upgrade from gartic and skribbl lol
What's hilarious is that the character who was buried under someone's arse and woke up saying "hmm" is in fact actually gay in the story. 5:32
.
.
Behzinga can you do another twitch stream at some point? Love the content as well ❤️❤️🔥🔥
Love how Harry is always eating in these videos🤣
Respect to Dad
WHATS UP LADS!
Before I watch the Video I just want to put a disclaimer if v dog ( vinnie ) not Vic is on here I am unsubscribing 😡until tomorrow
Simon & Behz moments are the best! I also wish Simon did more of these react videos when he is standing.
Ethan trolling Simon lol
Plss react to bollywood movies pt2 we need this
Simon's reactions made this video so much more entertaining and funnier 🤣
Naah Simon just wanted to show off his table lol
Pog
The girl getting henna seems so shocked and sad knowing it won't wash off for weeks
After Ethan said that about Simon the video got way better
Simon only been the face of the thumbnail once in the last 6 months rip
🎶The power of EMON🎶 IYKYK
Simon getting mad is the funniest thing ever 😂😂
these three are so funny together lmaoooo
These are the best trio
Josh is honestly doing bits on Twitch rn
Sidemen reacting to Chocotaco, my two favorite youtubers. Made my day

ethans hat and beard are matching
Simon flexin’ his rich-ass hydraulic desk stand in front of the other two.
Minter really second most viewed streamer?

Thankyou sidemen
Sidemen reacting to Twitch clips is like my two worlds colliding.

This is gold 😅🤣😂
Simon was trying to get his payback on Ethan all video but Ethan had him on ropes
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Has behz always looked this ginger?
Doubt most of these are the actual most viewed clips on Twitch. Also #PokiIsAnClown
HMS piss the league
you should watch the video of mizkif not knowing Messi
Sidemen should do a bob ross painting video
Yo

No wonder Harry is getting big! He's literally eating in every reacts video
Standing Simon Is Actually Pretty Dope 🐺
This was another amazing reacts
Actually I think Simon has started something, I don't wanna see the sidemen sitting anymore
Purple aki
3:46 that has to be the most force laugh i've heard
Suiiii
Ethan's laugh is contagious af😆
TBF Simons clips are good
The moment between Behz and Simon is what we need more of in Reacts, sad to see that some of it went away, especially the long intros.
"Like buy a house with stables" 🤣
What a vid 😂
11 minutes

Just Watched KSimons Last Vid🐺So Dope
