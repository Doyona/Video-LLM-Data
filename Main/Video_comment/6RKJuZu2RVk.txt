I’m fuming!!! 😡😡
But the Glazers have spent a billion
I feel u, saeed. You are fucking right, the present manutd team is just not good enough. Ima liverpool fan. Against liverpool at old trafford, the whole manu team didnt even turn up for both halves.
These days not one player from United could make it in the starting 11 for city or Liverpool most of them couldn’t get a start for arsenal hahaha it’s falling further and further for United. It’s great to watch I never imagined it could get so bad but now it is I can only see it getting worse. Toxic club from the owners to the fans. Finished United fc.
When they used to say wan bissaka was the best rb in the world and called us bitter for laughing hahaha
Ur lips look like u got thrush bro stop eating out nittys
Saeed spitting facts
Hahha love a man utd fan coming to terms with how far they have fallen
It's amazing, whenever there is a talk about Man City stars, Mahrez is rarely mentioned.......It's a sort of segregation against Mahrez.  After the game, Gary Nevile said that Mahrez is currenty the best in the word in his position as a right wing. Get off it and admit that Mahrez is one of the best players in the word.
It could've been 7-1
Z Zidane should be the favourite to get the United Job.  Because of his winning mentality as a player for Juve France and R Madrid. He has won every important Trophy as a Player and Manager and he is respected as a legend of the game.   Ten Haag has not managed big players and he is not proven in top leagues so he is a risk.   Pochettino is good with young players but he doesn’t have the winning mentality like Ole he will eventually get Sacked.
At one point it was 92% 8% ball possession
This is just beautiful....
This guy is the realist man u fan out word big up saeed all day
Saeed bruv, its not just the players, a lot are NOT good enough and like you say 'they need ripping out of the team', but we've seen the likes of Bruno, Pogba, Sancho, Ronaldo etc. play well There is a HUGE mentality issue at this club and there are major issues with the coaching. Constantly bouncing around between interim managers and interim coaches is just NOT gonna work If the club dont invest belief and time into the RIGHT manager and coaches and players too, then this will carry on for years.
you deserve all this for saying wan bissaka is better then trent alexander arnold JOKE
They never turn up
I feel so low watching United I won't be going Saturday the pain and anxiety before the game is worse than after imagine kane and son against our defence players not out there verane Ronaldo cavsni Shaw all dodgy if you ask me ans as fir Rashford go leave mate your ego has landed
Hate is a kin to love 💕
Come too the city what is up with you united are over walk now and put your energy in to winners you just said for get united you are a city fan big hug x
United midfield is mid I would recruit from The premiership get Fred an mctom out bring in tielsman and basouma
Every time i see Saeed lately, I think of Biggie!
I'm sorry but this is comical 😂😂😂😂😂😂😁👍😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Say what ever you all like about Ronaldo, but he has seen it from long ago and does not want to be apart of this s*** anymore and people think he is selfish and what not, NO, he clearly sees what we as amateurs can guess, but he sees it 100% as a top professional…
Ralf play academy players .....this is a disaster
You and the United fans have deserve this
What's the point in even getting mad? City are miles better than you. What outcome were you expecting? The problem with Utd fans is that they still think they're a top club who can compete with the best. They're not even close to competing.
Man u had ferguson but now u got nothing take 10 more years till u find right direction right Manager all teams go through this look liverpool 90s came crushing down took 30 years win league
What job can you put half a shift in shame no one gets bollocked swamp donkey 🐴 kings i bet they have a donkey on Blackpool beach called CR7 or Ronaldo
Wtf you would drop Ronaldo Cavani tf is wrong with management??
The United players at the moment don't give a stuff about pride or the results.  All they care about is the dosh they're getting paid. Don't couldn't care less about the fans or the club.
hahahahahahahahahaha ARSENAL IS BETTER THAN YOU HAHAHAHAHA
In South Africa we call them Kaale Kak!!!
If the club isn't bothered about the out dated stadium with a leaking roof, then why would they care about how poor we are performing and the bad results.
Mourinho wasn't the problem
Ralf should've subbed off Rashford after 10 minutes...I can handle losing...but the lack of effort is unforgivable...he can't play again if he won't work off the ball
Glazers out keep Sancho elanga and David
Absolutely correct Ralf is not the problem players have no desire no passion no hunger
i was getting a trim yesterday n remember telling my barber city was gonna win but he didnt listen
2023 - 2013 (Man Utd's last winning EPL title) = 10 years. I feel your pain, Saeed. :')
Same title every week
We are too intimidating for you now, that's all.  #NoisyNeighbours
I've mentioned this on another channel, but what's the point of it anymore?? There are simply better things in life than putting up with this sh*t, and good luck to anyone who honestly thinks Utd will win PL in the next 5 years! What a waste of time.
City looking good
Any manager coming in has a 5 year project on his hands .Can Utd fans even give him the time , I doubt it
Loving it  YNWA
These cowardly players have been cowards for years. Chickens have simply come home to roost! Get the lot out now!!!
I thought Ole was the problem mate?? What happened?
Honestly i don’t think its glazers fault. They put out the money that managers/sportdirector wants to buy. They have been spoiling u lots with money. At this moment if i where a united fan i would blame the players. 2-3 managers with same players? Who’s to blame😅
What do u expect Bruno to do as a striker put any CAM or CM striker and we will see how well they play
TRAINING GROUND 😄 🤣 😂
We played well for the first 45 minutes and dominated possession, It was the second half were we collapsed
Pogba and Sancho aren’t average.
WHAT HAPPENED? THIS IS NOT MAN UTD HOW DOES THIS CLUB NOT WIN ANY TROPHIES IN DAMN NEAR 5 YEARS?
Saeed sounding like Arsenal past couple seasons, lmao Banter Utd
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 cmon you GUNNERS 🔥🔥🔥
unfollow this team & their players in social media stop attending their matches till they stop disrespecting us
what did u expect b??????  where a baseball club/prawn sandwich,  stadium of one of the biggest clubs in the world and we got no tv screens in the stadium,HAHA, LMAO,
It was not anymore 😂😂😂
As a Toon fan I turned to my boy and said " the Man U players body language stinks ". Fans - all fans - will accept a lot, but not effort. I hate it when Toon players don try. I feel your pain guys, shamefull attitude from your players.
Accept your fate, bring in a young manager, build through your academy and sign players that fit the profile you want. It’ll take about 4 years to rebuild but it’s the only way.
United will fight against relegation next season if they qualify for the Europa League or CL. It's a divided dressing room of players with egos with no depth. I would bet my money on it.
Listen I have NO love for Manchester United but I'm generally feeling for your fans now and I don't no about getting technical players in mate just get some players in that look interested because I watched that game and I couldn't believe what I was seeing absolutely shocking no passion no desire they just threw in the towel they were disgraceful and the fans pay all that money to watch that I seriously could not believe what I was watching and I grew up with united win everything I would be shouting at my 10 year old if he gave up that easy at anything not just football them players bow your heads in Shame
Save the £40m u spent on Ronaldo and Cavani and get the roof fixed 😂😂
I LOVE THIS GAME : -  Patrice Evra, former Manchester United Captain
I fckin love this gameeee 😂😂😂😂
Big Sae 😂😂😂😂😂
its time remove the emotional attachment from this club man. entire team needs rebuilding
We've been telling you for years that your players are shite. We told you from day one that Ole was a joke. But you don't want to hear it. You need to hear this; the glory days are over and they're not coming back in this generation or the next, so either support your team and accept them for what they are or find another sport.
Let's not forget manchester united stadium isn't even in Manchester so they've got a cheek to have that name.
The new arsenal  banter tv🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂😂,CTID.
🤣🤣🤣 man u in the mud
The whole team are lazy I can't swear united need to get rid of these overrated shite players
HEAD OF THE BOARD AND BOARD MEMBERS MUST RESIGN IMMEDIATELY! FAILURES!
Rashford can only run stright! Ronaldo no leg’s, bisakka shak’y spider,Harry the fridge  can Go on if you lot want that!!
Hahaha,Mandem?! Keep it Up! we Arsenal fan’s Love This can talk for everybody🤣
It's united fault for being social media fc all mediocre players🤣
The fact is these youtube channels earn their grub by criticizing or appreciating Manchester United. If This club sues these channels, it will tone down their aggression 😂
Average players making elite salary . Rangnick should have played the youth , these players are not hungry to win. They're just here for a participation medal and collecting huge pay checks
We "gas out" in the 1st half against lesser teams than City. What did we think was gnna happen playing City away?
Saeed, you are correct when you stated that United players are ‘average’ but that is only when you compare them to the players at City, Liverpool or Chelsea. Manchester United WERE one of the best teams in the world but that state of affairs ended a decade ago, so actually United are over-performing by being in fifth position in the league. Honestly, United supporters need to lower their expectations because it will clearly be a number of years before you regain any semblance of success.
Lindelöf - 10, Bruno - 10, Maguire - 10. Lindelöf for motm. 😏🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Unfortunatel the united board will listen to the likes of garry nevile who is some kind of a booty licker instead of honest and passionate united  fan like saeed
“When is it gonna end Robbie?” 🤣
Jose said this players are not good enough and everyone said he is toxic look at spurs same thing man u fans and spurs are deluded shame on u lot
I don't see us in the top 4, we are not good enough for the top 4
MAN UTD FANS IN UK ARE A FAILURE….DO SOMETHING!!!!!!!!UNLESS YOU HIT THE GLAZERS IN THEIR POCKET YOU WILL MAKE NOISE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE #GLAZERS OUT#BANKERS OUT
I have walked away . I'm done lol
You were never good enough
What is this club doing to my man Saeed!?
how do you expect united to play football when the roof is leaking???
Taking Pogba off when he was the only united player that had accurate passes, one which led to our only goal
Miskeen wallahi
Call me a fake fan or not. I find it hard to watch and pay attention watching these lot play. So distant with the game BC of this squad😭 find myself watching rivals more 😭
You get battered by Liverpool 5-0 at your own ground and City beat you up 4-1 pipe down Saeed
The Thing is, we saw those players actually perform, Wan bissaka was indeed a very good defensive Player, Bruno was POTY Material, what the hell happened
imagine being a Liverpool fan and winning the game during the weekend and you decide to watch the city game and hope for a upset but after watching this United team even im Depressed.
Do non of today’s Uniteds fans not recall United pre SAF??? It’s not *Always* been “We are United”! 🤦‍♀️
HEAD OF THE BOARD AND BOARD MEMBERS MUST RESIGN IMMEDIATELY.
This match was so unbalanced, fans saw it as a training session for Man City. MU can't even make Man City a little difficult. What is clear, this match shows that there are still so many things that United must improve if they want to return to competing at the top level.
Utd players have had their own way for far too long they are a disgrace 😡
What your club needs to do is simply get the best players for your system once you develop one(which is the 1st thing to do), love for the badge or club can come once you start winning
Let’s be honest, Yank owners are not going anywhere, so calling for their heads is pointless. The problem is, and has always been two fold since Fergie left. Poor managerial appointments and player recruitment. As a Gooner, even though football is cyclical, I never thought I’d see Utd go 10 years without a title, or become a banter club.
I said it before get player's that want to win trophys not just to parade around I see better players in street leagues
Defo
I think they felt sorry for you at some point in that game
Hit nail on the head! “They used to be little man city at main road, now Manchester utd little club in Manchester “
Untill u lot come together to sort out your owners nowt will change and am lfc fan and even I hope yours kp going like this coz man u are banter fc 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As  UNITED fans can we all go to our individual Sunday league's and scout for a defender. Cause there has to be a better defender than Maguire, 80mil it's heartbreaking....
You need to see what happened at Lfc. You get coached that has philosophy. Once you get the coach…let him coach/manager  3 years. Just spend the money wisely…. Just remember Poch has not won anything !!!
Told you lot you had a bunch of overrated players but your deluded fanbase don't want to hear it.
Question: What about the summer?   Pogba out of contract Cavani gone CR7 (maybe gone) Lingard Martial Players need to leave :  McTomminay Fred Rashford Lingard Maguire Wan Bissaka
with these players a new coach must come in and start teaching "what is football"
Even a shitty city  side pre Arabs.   .put in a better display then the current utd side in a Derby...we are fukin shite
Is there any fan in the world that overhype players and managers more than saeed?? I remember him jumping and singing Ole at the wheel. He hyped up Pogba, Rashford, Bruno, Maguire, Bissaka, Ronaldo etc. I accept that we can all change our minds over time but he does the hyping every time.
*RONALDO IS THE PROBLEM*  “Man Utd will play like Prime Barca and score 3–4 goals without the problem Ronaldo. They will press from the front, counter-attack & dominate!”
ManU fans must accept Maguire and stop complaining about the 80 million🤣🤣
Jose the dinasour! Jose the outdated one! Jose the expired one! Lol! Stupid fans
I’m fucking fuming sitting here paying to watch this absolute bunch of criminals earning that wedge for walking around the pitch and giving up, it’s making me want to give up man.
Mumufmufc ok 🇾🇪,
lol united are nothing but the faint off the past
Agree incompetent board
Agree get rid of these shit players
Game over ..rotten club from top to bottom...
Shameful players....they threw man united players under the bus
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Spitting facts as always Saeed. Like you said so many hyped up players & you’ve brought it up in past interviews time & time again that players are good enough & most of them are still here, just a shambles. Keep up the class content bro 👊👊
A new manager can't fix this.
Saeed I agree with everything you said, and I feel your pain
Skull Thuggery, we got em'
Weve got a roof thats leaking 😂🤣😂🤣😂😂 wow
It’s not about playing hard or not mate, those man aren’t good enough…
As defeated arsenal fan, i surrender. U guys win...you're officially the best, worst club eva. Enjoy the spoils!!! 😂🤣😂😂.
Saeed Brother. You then said Maguire is better than Van Dijk👀👀👀👀
But remember Ronaldo is the problem, to old, doesn't press, selfish, moans to much, players can't talk to him etc. Etc.etc..😂🤣😂🤣😂😎🥂👏
U cant fix the roof cos u got shite on big wages 🤣
Somebody please tell me besides De Gea, Pogba, Ronaldo (almost 40) and Cavani what world class player does ManU have? It's a total delusional thing that ManU has a team to compete for trophies. Another thing, ManU doesn't invest in a decent coach, Ole and Rangnick are miles away from being any great coach. Don't expect miracles.
U lot 😎😆😆  are in the mud u need to get rid of the whole back 4 and get yourself a proper dm first and for most
OLE OUT!!!😂😂
Man said set 8 kids I’m finished😂
Saeed for me done with those players
Easy to blame the owners but they've spent over a billion pound on players in the last decade piss poor recruitment bad management and just the players themselves are to blame the facts are we've spent so much money but we easily need to spend another 3-4 hundred million on the right players there's literally about 5-6 players in the whole squad that are good enough to start for Manchester united
I can't get angry anymore. I think I've felt out of love with United.
Schooled 👕😉😂😂😂
They say Mctominay is the next Roy Keane, Mctominay is shit. He is hiding and jogging around like high school marathon runner. Man U, owner board, fans and players are shambles.
Make sure Steve is part of Big 6ix drag him online. Dont let the trolls win.
Big six will be lit....suuuiiiiiii
Low IQ is what I thought aswell
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Skull thugerry ik is sniffing
its supposed to be a derby, how can you be tired in the second half in a derby man, btw only Bruno and Sancho clapped the fans at the end aswell
They always put blame on ronaldo,they have forgotten that this guy is a treats to all team he played against
Hi mate hope u ok im steve leicester fan been subscribed long time now .ur top bloke love ur streams and ur honesty mate .keep up the great content
You calling to stop overrating the players while used to call Maguire beckenbauer...
Everytime I see Saeed, he looks depress and more depress. C'Mon Saeed! Take Utd off your mind for this week and treat yourself to something nice.  ViVa Saeed!
Would love a Saeed and H4JJ show
These United fans were spoiled by Ferguson, time for some cold hard reality for the next 10 years at least...😱🤭
Big up Saeed, it breaks my heart see you suffer like that. I love your passion for football but I really hope better time may come for you.  But to be fair, most of the ManU Fans witnessed the SAF-era and probably have to high expectations. Welcome to the life of most of other club fans, who will never see their team winning a trophy.
Set 8 kids learning set 1 work 😂😂😂
i’m a liverpool fan  you let me down more than you let down your bloody fans
You can actually feel the pain in his voice/eyes. Feel for you Saeed man❤️
It ain’t easy😭😭
Maguire,Shaw, Mf Fred wan bissaka, rashford lingard not good enough
Shit players our club
Problem with Man Utd they live in the past they think they are this big team still money wise yes they are but not a big team Neville got asked to do the arsenal strategy and get the really talented young players and suffer for a few years and young manger and he was like no we are Man Utd 😂😂
The comparison between Mctominay and Fred v. Bernardo and De Bryne and Rodri is a joke. This is levels. #GlazersOut
Ole come back lol
Leeds fan , not taking the piss but it's sad seeing a great club in this state. Can't see a change for at least 5 yrs. Can't believe the deflation in the vibe of the players today. Looks grim.
I take it you weren't happy with the performance?
Remember when you said Maguire > Van dijk 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yeah Man Utd new arsenal. Only difference is Man Utd spend the same as city. Rip it apart lol £400 million squad
just askin u thing greenwood would have don anythin here?
“We’re not that club anymore”. Finally the penny has dropped!!!
It's peak fam
Bruno was absolutely pathetic today  try Pogba at 10 and drop him
Saeed you already know deep down City will turn us over especially in second half records this season. this club is just full of shit top to bottom. Save your energy mate
How is Maguire playing ahead of Eric Bailey???????? Maguire side stepping towards his goal and opened up space in front of him for De Bruyne to run into and shot through his legs and it was the first goal for man city, the second goal, it looked like Maguire was literally walking back towards his goal and keeping a man city player on- side, the third goal from the corner, he didn't bother blocking the shoot from Mahrez, so how the fuck is he the club captain and on the pitch as well????????? this guy has got no football brains and compass, he can't read the game. Coaches will only have themselves to blame for playing him.
And no ain’t good enough but people like you would you say Fred is good ? Hahaha mctominay is twice player then fake rats 🐀
Your clown if you watched full match
This man is crying for Spurs so go to Spurs mctominay is better then Fred you clown
Dw things will get better have hope am Arsenal been
Whoever that comes in..need to get rid all the "english based players" in that team..
Proper plastic this guy ....jumped on the fergie bandwagon lol
Poor Saeed! Wouldn't want to be in your home tonight with all those City fans!
What's new saeed man i feel you 😧 fuck this lot.. joke im ashamed ffs! Must be hard stuck in Manchester.. head up dont strees over a shit show that dont give one damn about us owners board players the lot im done!
Unlucky Saeed my bro.
I don’t know why you are angry you didn’t have a chance Against Man City sorry
I’m convinced I’m better than Maguire… I’m convinced
Hi Saeed, United are lucky to have you as a fan. Hopefully someone at the club can listen.
It’s clearly easy to see that the players are not good enough and everyone was blaming Ronaldo , what joke of a team , Losers mentality simple as that
Don't you ever chat about Bruno being on KDB level again. One turns up for most big games, the other (a.k.a. the bucktooth diver) turns into Houdini in 9/10 big games.
Pogboom. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I ain't a Liverpool  or City   Fan..... This is Priceless  Viewing..
ur team needs sacking
OLE has a lot to blame for this he created over 3 year's a mentality of if you play crap don't worry about you will play again next week... Fletcher needs to gone aswell
United spend £1.2 BILLION since Fergie left. 😂 Another £2 Billion won’t help you.
harry beckenbeur
Great match reaction saeed 👍
Content is pure gold. Also have to mention how amazing you are when it comes to analysing your team with genuine passion
But Saeed, didn't you say Bruno is the best player in the world and Pogba is the best midfielder in the premier league? Oh, and I almost forgot Ronaldo and Sancho. Are they all bad players??
To be honest I never thought I would see United going 10 years without winning the Prem…
4:35 - "Stop thinking McTominay is the Second Coming Roy Keane... HE'S NOT, HE'S NOT!!! He's not the Second Coming Roy Keane, he simply is NOT! STOP BELIEVING HIS HYPE... he's not, there's nothing! He's not better than Darron Gibson, and that's probably a disrespect to Darron Gibson." I'm weak 😂😭😂😭😂😭
Where's Juan Mata in all this?
The coin flipped a long time ago saeed
I'm sorry man. I'm also heartbroken 💔
LOOOOOOOL
Don't understand ralph. Has he not learned anything about manu? Pogba off jesse on .?
Saeed be making notes and reading them now 😅 On another note big up for the good work my man
Saeed be making notes and reading them now 😅 On another note big up for the good work my man
U lot are has beens  just like arsenal but with arsenal we are rebuilding with arteta
Yes mate most of the ownership just care about da money
There will never be an other roy Keane mate
The roof thing had me, Saeed you are a Legend ❤️
worse to come yet. Liverpool at anfield.
U lot got  cr 🤣
Your manager disrespect rashford by not starting him an giving an inexperience striker a start in a big derby game
But I thought ronaldo was the problem
Not even surprised. Until Utd understand that the likes of Maguire, McTominay and Bruno are not even Utd squad level, this team are f**ked. Standards are on the floor at this point.
I'm an arsenal fan and I'm loving it keep losing lads I encourage u guys 😂😂...this team yeah it reminded  2019/20 , arsenal were shit that year u pricks were laughing at us .... But now karma is back on u "how does it feel🎤"
Was there any doubt that city would beat u lot seriously common man
It's clear out and start again.
You have to remember a lot of clubs break down in the second half against city. It's hard to continue press a side where they are keeping the ball and as they lose it they win it back then keep it again, it's frustrating 💯
Why are we one of the biggest football clubs in the world? We need to stop that thinking
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I always said Mc tominay was shite. Absolute awful player. 👎🏻
Can’t see much changing until something more serious happens at the top of the club. If you don’t change the structure, you don’t get success. Many many years behind the rest.
You blame the Glaziers but ...... haven't they given you millions of pounds to spend on players? You've just bought bad ones - Harry Maguire, Ronaldo (Wages), Bailly,  Pogba, Fred, Lindeloff, Wan Bissaka, Cavani (Wages) etc etc etc.
Walllahi saeeddy your legend fam keeps it up classs 🥇🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Arsenoo FC We are far....................gre..........................
MAN IS  STRESSSSED
Utd are staying up
Love seeing Saeed stressed😂😂😂😂 Gunners for d UCL spot
It doesnt even hurt
United have fallen, been covering shit with glitter for a long time
it ain't easy Saeed
Another game where United got battered!!! If not for De Gea, United would have lost 9-1!!! 🤢🤢🤢
The players are washed up man! 😂
Old Trafford gonna be one hell of a stadium for the Championship.
I swear everytime we lose all saeed does is blame the glazers.how about a proper breakdown of what ralf did wrong in the game.
Don't forget to tell your boyz to bring the same hype to Anfield
Seriously Guys give Roy Keane the United Managers' Position, he is the only person the Players would give one hundred per cent. Roy would not allow the team to play crap he would demand the very best.  United's first team needs discipline. Keano for United No.1 spot.
Well said mate, the players are tbe problem
If we win the next game Beth and co can we build on this 😂😂😂😂 I’d love to be positive but top 4 was gone months ago we won games we should have lost
Im done, picks the same players for same results, rashford lingard sell out
Well said bro👏👏
Left hand man, standing with u on everything  uv just said. vexed bless bro
Watching Saeed wearing a city shirt next season will be funny 😆
The sad thing is we all saw this coming. Based on form. Performance shocking. Defending abysmal. Didn't turn up. CANT BE ASKED. 😒😞
I think we should riot guys
Maguire nutmeg performance was godly 👍👍
Next time you pay £100 for a United t-shirt, ask yourself if half the players deserve to play for the badge.. the more United fans spend on merchandise and support the team, the more you tell the Glazers that you accept the situation. There’s a saying… the fishes from the head down. United are not a team, they’re just an assembly of expensive players… no consistency in philosophy or standards, no heart or emotion, poor recruiting… you lot have gone from Ferdinand and Vidic to Maguire and Lindeloff… with a full back like AWB … really? Rashford was meant to be your big hope… now all you do is talk about 19 yo Elaga… really? Fred and McTominay up against Rodri, KDB, and Bernardo Silva… really? Bruno Fernades is a shadow of the player who rescued you a season ago… spends more time moaning than tracking back… really?   From a Liverpool fan who’s lovin’ it!
Told you months ago ole wasn't the problem the players don't care,pogba went off wasn't even disappointed players coming on sulking because they were on the bench been going on for time I don't even get angry anymore😂😂
I can't stand this group of players saeed i never thought I'd say that about utd players tbh
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruno Harry need to go
The way you folded in the 2nd half was CRAAAAAAZZZYYY!!!!!
Your being sponsored by band aid next year as it’s keeping your stadium from falling down it’s a rust bucket training ground is grass roots level oh and your team is shit 😂 and if u win one game you all say what good players you got etc etc 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wan Bissaka can’t control the ball. I said that 2 years ago and people attacked me.
I said at the start of the season… Ronaldo ain’t gonna solve your problems,  then Ragnick came in and I said he isn’t world class, just a decent manager forget the Gergen press … you have a team of individuals but they are not a team… your two strikers combined age is 71… let that sink in 💁🏽‍♂️🤣🤣  Your neighbors fighting got the league year in year our must be tough to watch… 5-0 against Liverpool this season, 2 nil city and now 4-1 city… shame 🤣🤣🤣
Yanited are finished fr
4-1 In a derby you know 🤣🤣
Half the team if not more doesn’t have the ability or the quality to compete at the very top. They probably mid table type players if not lower
Man utd are finished as a football Club. It's time we all faced it. #GlazersOut is the only way out of this
They gave up after 65 minutes… That is something that cannot be forgiven! Absolutely shocking. They should be ashamed of themselves!
this time is ragnick mistake by playing again mcdonaldguire and nomorespidermanawbsaka and also poor formation by him..hope better next season by buying new defenders
Better clone a young Ferguson to be Manager of Man United
Don't have a heart attack bro it's a risk investing emotions in #manutd
Just shows that don’t make no difference without ronaldo , who was left out deliberately
What happened to viva ronaldo? you lot was laughing at man city when he went to you.
I’m done with Manchester United. Good luck saeed
Another dejavu for saeed 😆 🤣 #coyg
The moment Pogba went off I knew we were done with goals. Wan Bissaka, Fred,  let me just stop there....
Why is Dalot getting benched all of a sudden? I don’t get Rangnick at all, what’s the point putting Hannibal on the bench and not use him
Ole handing over the Wheel to Ralf
Yes United they are not good enough and lazy no heart duds, anybody who has ever played midfield at any level would have never unmarked KDB or Silver, any body with half a football brain would have had a little smash at these players, run the studs down a calf or 2 to slow them down and let them know you are there, not McFred they were posted missing persons, there is now a major man hunt on as the must have sneaked away from the Ethiad at half time.. lol
Man u in the mud ayee...📉
I hate all these players that playing for my club..
I am very happy as a Manchester City fan from Australia. I am sorry for you Saeed.
Crazy to think Utd are one third of the way to being Liverpool in terms of 30 years with no title
I'm so done with football man, manutd has made me hate football.  Can't remember the last time I watched a full 90min game, football is so dead. I'm gonna go kill myself.
When Tim Sherwood was talking sense, you were trashing him. Ralf ain't good enough
Painful to watch that’s all I can say.
At the end of the deal football people have got to be making football decisions not bankers, that's the root of the problem
Dishwater FC mate
It ain’t easy😭😭😭
Baby elanga is the only bright spark
Big six is gonna be fun!
Utd turned champions leaugue varane into europa league varane😂😂😂
Lol Thanks Manchester United for doing arsenal a favour  From an arsenal fan
This is the Saeed we love.
Oh dear, talk about self-entitled....enjoy your evening
This is sure fire PROOF that Abdullah The Butcher had kids!!!
COYG now an Everton win tomorrow will be an icing on the cake !
Alot of United’s players realistically should be playing at Crystal palace and Burnley. It genuinely brings me so much joy to see the state of United. #ILoveDisGame
Keano himself would be ashamed that anyone would say Mctominay is the 2nd coming of Roy Keane
Your right saeed some of your players are a joke man no heart no passion no running at times discrace.
Even if ManU get 4th,  summer sales more important than summer buys

Glazercuntnomics is not part of the solution, advertising companies calling out players to promote  product sholud also stop at this transition period, respect the club yea
Big up Saeed
Your like EastEnders
Manchester united football club are so bad and it's so sad 😭 but bring me so much Joy and happiness , we love you Liverpool we do .
The whole situation has been so predictable. Bring in a guy who hasn’t been a successful manager, ask him to get a dysfunctional bunch of players to play in a coherent system, find out that it’s near impossible to do because they’re either not good enough or willing to do it, persist with said players again and again hoping something will change, players know he’s only here for six months and then it’s yet another regime in the summer,  be surprised that it all turns to shit very quickly. Could only happen at United because that’s how crap we’ve become.
Really feel bad for Saeed, for his sake atleast I hope united get some form and show improvement
If Ralf see Maguire as a reliable defender and to make things worse as a captain material then we are in serious trouble.
Ya when football bais poltics ,here we go,not about players it's about me fuck Nuto,us,uk more pain coming men sorry too say bro,bitter true from 🇪🇷
It ain't eazzyyy!!
Since Alex Ferguson left Bant-chester Yanited have spent £1.2bn. While Citeh have spent £1.25bn. Anyone suggesting the Glazers aren't spending needs their head examined. The real problem is turning on David moyes, just because you were getting bantered. He would have turned your club around. Look at him now, with less resources.
Just shameful thats it for me
1945-2013 rest in power man u
Coyg 🔴⚪️🔴⚪️
Giving the glazers ur money every week. Only an empty stadium will remove the tumour that’s killing our club
#oleout
Is all this still oles fault saed?
We should vote with our feet and protest outside on match days
Atleast u agreed that u overhyped these clown players. Appreciate it 👍🏻
McFred once again showed why they are not good enough for Manchester United. Scratch that, the entire players are not good enough for Manchester United. We are miles behind City and Liverpool. Saeed, we are shit. Simple as that.
viva saaed ,lmao
Got my popcorn out
Spurs will be 5th  United will play Conference League next year.
You say all that yet spend money to watch every game wk in wk out.   If I were the players I'll not give a shit since the supporters are turning up anyway and I earn millions no matter how I play.
WHAT U TELLING ME SAEEEEEE , YE , TELL BROJBA TO COME OUTSIDE !!! ALL THAT TALK ABOUT KDB , HOOOOOLD THAT
You should support your team through thick and thin but. I'm not supporting a lack of erffort
No shots in the second half , I seen Emerson doing the Poznan. We can't put 8 passes together. The 2 defender goal kick is shocking, I watched mctominay all game he can't run never tracks back. Can't pass useless.
Man utd players are lazy and tired
They were comparing wan bisaka and trent - what a joke!
Man utd are lazy
Realist sh!t Saeed's said all season, BigUp
I can say it right now, don't count on winning the Europa League to qualify for CL in 2023-24.
Lol big Steve’s jokes bout the roof leaking has hit home hardddd! 😂😂😂😂💀💀💀
And i thought City didn't matter 😅
United only dominated when Ferguson had all the refs in his pocket. We all know how they got helped, extra extra time, decisions and the list goes on. Man city had a really nice preseason game vs Manchesters boys club
Was not to long ago on the big six that Saeed was calling pogba one of the greats pogba is a lazy shite bag
Asc,Manchester city were the better team today.
“RONALDO WAS THE PROBLEM” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Joke fans
I’m a blue lad and thought Mctommany was one of your better players. He threw his body in and made some good blocks.!.
Conference league incoming
We need to sell the following:           AWB  Maguire Lindelof Bailly? Shaw  Telles? Mctom  Matic Fred Bruno Lingard Mata Jones Ronaldo Cavani Rashford Elanga (loan) This may be harsh for some people but just think about who are good enough to play for Manchester United. God bless.
I think we're finished
I personally think top six with this squad is absolutely brilliant.
Okay okay holy smokes saeed calm down jeez
man United are no longer a big club
Europa league varane
Hahaha. Salford still be always red!
Man Utd.  Spice Boys 2022 hahaha
I don't come here to rub it in and I was genuinely nervous before the game and after Sancho's goal. I try harder when taking dumps than United in the second half.
I'm sick and tired of this club! I don't care if we get top 4 or not, cuz at the end of the day, it's not something to be proud of. Forget champions league, we ain't winning that. Maguire, get the fuck out of this club ASAP and let someone else be the captain, who honestly, the only player who should be captain is De Gea, who has saved our asses time and time again this season. AWB absolutely shocking today, obviously I don't expect him to be good on attack, but at least defend well and control the fucking ball, and he can't even do that. Fred shocking mctominay and bruno nonexistent. Honestly Ralf got it wrong taking off Pogba and Elanga who were the bright spots in our team for who, Lingard and Rashford, who have been absolutely shit. We have to get rid of many players, get owners  that care about this club, and buy players who play for the badge. We have long ways to go!!!!
Aaron Wan Bissaka went from an attacking wing back at Palace to a defensive coward at United. Maguire went from a ball playing CB at Leicester to a bambi on ice at United. Every so-called "elite" player Manchester United buy are 10 times worse than their fans hype them as!
Saeed in 2019 once said “sell the whole lot of them mate”
United are a first half team anything after that it’s pooor poooooor . That second half was way too embarrassing brother man . 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ ‘twas Man vs Boys all over again . And ohh fuxk Bruno 😡
Watch this video in 1.5 speed and thank me later 😂
Love ur passion bro and am arsenal fan I feel ur pain damn!
you was gassed & optimistic in the big 6 oii 😂
😂😂😂😂 MU stupid
I haven't watched match off the day for weeks now cuz off the wankers how cudnt buy a win. Dreadful all year.
Shut this football club for a season or two ..had enough of this club
😂😂😂😂😂😂 love the rant mate COYG 😁
Shitclub💩
worst time for big steve to leave big 6ix. Saeed won't get cooked on Monday 😭😭😭
We needed technical footballers today saeed. We need Donny more than Bruno, we need martial more than Rashford.
Why are you angry at the owners, they spend a lot of money. Utd fans protested, they spent big. Utd fans wanted Ole gone they fired him, what more must the owners do
Darren Gibson 🕸😂😂😂😂😂😂💙💙💙💙
Love you still saeed 😂
Well said boss 🤟🤟
We got a roof that's leaking 🤣
These players don't deserve our support
Ngl as a citeh fan those first few minutes yall had us locked. But gg Cmon Citeh!
Please put respect on Gibson's name 🙏🏾
Hahahah gold 😅
All Jose inners deserve an apology. All Martial F.C. people deserve an apology. All people who never believed in Dalot deserve a slap. Sad to say it, but some of these oblivious fans deserve it. Any and all English players get free run at the first team. An article was written a few days ago saying "Elanga could be the saviour we need". Really? Martial had won the Golden Boy and was the most expensive teenager by 19. We have ourselves to blame. We abuse players like Dan James and Martial until they get out, and then cry about having Lingard and Sir Rashy coming on.  Edit: Saeed, you said "they allowed Martial to leave, incompetent board". Are you seriously trying to re-write history? Nearly half or more of our entire fan base took the absolute piss out of him. Said unbelievable things about his personal life. Did you not see that video after him getting booed? He was nearly crying coming off the pitch. Karen had to go and give him a pat on the back. You could see his reaction. YEARS on the bench behind a less talented, less intelligent, selfish player who constantly loses the ball and only presses whem he feels like it. He was the ULTIMATE team player and he was portrayed as a villain. He took a PAY CUT. Some of these fan channels and influential members of the fanbase who are responsible won't say ANYTHING about Rashford vs. Martial now. WATCH. why? Because Marcus has been found out. We deserve it. We need to build from the ground up and get these toxic so called fans out.
We are going to have to sell and rebuild AGAIN at the end of the Season because there will be a mass exodus at the end of the Season when we don't get in the top 4 and that is what probably needs to happen. Most of these players aren't good enough for this club, most of these players don't put the effort in for the this club. Most of these players don't care about this club! I'm not accepting any of this appologising on Twitter and Instagram and promising to put it right. I'm not interested. We have heard it so many times and it's just words nothing else. We need a clear out from top to bottom with the Glazers, the board, and the players because this club has been corrupt. This club is an absolute wreck. We are a million miles behind Liverpool, City, Chelsea, and even Arsenal are ahead of us now. It's embarasssing. The club is a whole mess!
Can't wait for United to post' Winning Team'💀😭
Quadruple?🥲
In the second half, united stopped playing and took the white flag out
zero hard pressing and urgency in a manchester derby, man united are in trouble
SAddest part of this.  Donny Van De Beek bossed this same side last week.  Like he totally owned City.. They didn't score v Everton til Donny exited late with injury.  Maguire McFraud Bruno = Ole's spine of Dread 📉
I feel bad for finding this funny but I understand what your going through we used to be ass you just have to go through the pain United will be back someday get rid of that shite harry wanker
Oh and Bruno can't pass water go back to basics matey
Sell everyone not gonna change anything because we'll buy the same crap again
Sancho should have came to Liverpool 💀😭
I'm a Chelsea fan but I really wanted man utd to atleast draw. Man utd was terrible in the 2nd half. I couldn't believe what I was watching
Lingard needs to go   pogba needs to go   Fred needs to go  mata needs to go matic needs to go maguire needs to go we have to clear out deadwood to give a new manager chance
Ronaldo and Varane going to be in the EUROPEA LEAUGE 😭💀
Same players, different coaches and same results. The problem is obvious
painfully poor, feel so helpless watching as our players just refuse to give an ounce of a shit
Same old shit saeed we are watching this team fall off a cliff these players are probably one the worst mixed bunch we have ever had no passion no understanding of how to pass a ball don't no how to defend and can't finish when we do have chances mixed bunch of wannabes losing so much interest in this team for the first time in a long time
That ‘set 8 learning set 1 work’ line was cold icl 🤣🤣
BIG C!!!!! Where you at?😂😂
The Blues have taken over the Red. It's the headlines all over. United lack behind QUALITY & PASSION . We are not good to compete against City and Liverpool. Ralf is not to blame. We need a huge Summer Clearance. Paul Scholes was fuming at these clowns. We should not be in top 4. Sorry to see and say this. We as a fan are destroyed and shattered.  " CLEAR THESE CLOWNS "  Season's over for us now.  Cheer's Saeed
You had ONE job💀🤦🏾‍♀️😭
Good evening Saeed and to everyone whose team collected 3 POINTS TODAY…. 🔴
What are you going on about. They tried to turn up don't you see the difference in quality?
I'm gonna be harsh, our players are overrated. These players don't care, at least fight till the last minute!
ARSENAL! ARSENAL! ARSENAL! BYE BYE TOP 4!
What Result do you Expect while playing 4 midfielders at the same time.We could have atleast benched one of pogba or fernandes and play rashford uptop.!!!
Let's be honest with this players......I was on pause mood till the end of the game. Ralf should just get Academy players to play till the end of the Season because I don't see a reason why those players Keeps playing every week and earning every week and yet no good results. Top 4 gone for good. I'm so much in pains now.
Let's be honest, we all knew this result was coming. 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Manchester is blue
Did we expect anything different.
Bruno AWB Fred Mctominay Rashford  Lingard Shaw Maguire  Lindelof  Jones Ronaldo  Elanga Henderson   None of these players are good enough and they all need selling ASAP
End this season now because I can't take this anymore 😡😡😡
We’ve got a bunch of losers playing for our club. Time to start all over again. Embarrassing the fans yet again with another shambolic performance.
Bro, y'all got rid of Ole, but he was  the only Manu manager who beat us..
Big up my guy
As i said after the match we drew with watford.We are out of the top 4 and this result confirms it! Arsenal have 48points a point ahead of us and have 3 games in hand on us.. We still have to play Liverpool and tottenham 🤣🤣🤣🤣  #GGMU
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Another training session
😭😭😭😭😭😭🙆🙆🙆🙆🇪🇹
first. poor and terrible performance. would love to collab mate?
Rangnick got it all wrong Imo, you don’t go to the Etihad with Pogba and Bruno up top, Mcdred in Midfield and Maguire at the back and press city it’s suicidal. The blue print is there from Tuchel Ole Conte Nuno etc to sit back and counter attack
Bloody hell our team is bloody shite.  Awb, Slabby, Mcfred so bloody shite
Know your place bro Manchester is blue
Ole back 🔜
Man City had a training session, they weren’t even trying that hard 🤣💀
I’m fuming!!! 😡😡
