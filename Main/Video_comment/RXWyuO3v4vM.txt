Genuinely loved this one. 🥰 Those brothers are so precious, and you guys are so cool for just trying all of that. 😎 And I just thought this was one of the best I've seen. 🤩 Thank you. 🙏 #brothers #coolness #best #gratitude
The editing is brilliant! The little detail when Eric dived in the ocean for the cold plunge 😂😂😂 the little sound of a drop in contrast with everyone else broke me! So, so perfect! 4:08
Laughing All through the video 😂😂😂
Sucks that Luke fucked up his career by cheating on his pregnant wife. He still competes but I think many people lost a lot of respect for him.
there's testosterone in the air son's 'uh'bichs
Basically the weakest man they bought was the strongest one got that😂❤
6:24 that zoom up😂
Absolutely loved this episode! Couldn’t stop laughing, what great gents they are, Like and Tom!!!
As a new subscriber and in my 60's, I so enjoy all the adventures you go on and the people you meet! Brings a smile to my face everyday!
Just found this absolute Jem! I follow Eddie, Brian, ect and these clowns with nothing but love. This is amazing!!!
Brotherly love 😍 These guys are awesome!!!
What great fun! Thank you for this video!
Hands down my favorite episode 💜
The even sound like Giants 😅
Móði and Magni THOR SON !
The Base in their Voice 😲🔥
This Is The Best Short Movie Ever!!!❤  We need more if this!  Why isn't a Series of The Brothers Yet! Why!!!!!!!!!🙏🏻🤗
How do you make money? How much does your food cost per month? Have you used steroids? If you continue, can you expect to keep the strength until your 80s?
I enjoyed this episode very much😊
I come back and watch this episode now and then.   These brothers are the best dudes in the world
I’m not surprised Eric is the strongest of the three. He grew up in Russia. One has to be strong there.
the way luke introduced his brother to sport to help him with his mental challenges and that he got so far is great
They're not giants 😂.  Polynesian are 😂
That voice out of a dark alley is nightmare fuel 😂
No way that guy lifted the 200kg wooden frame, that is insane and then he just carried 160kg?!?! WTF
This looks like the most fun day lol
Quick question, the scene at 2:11 with the text glasgow, is it not in Oban?
What a beautiful story. New to this channel and enjoying it so much
I think you can charge your phone only  By recording his voice
i have seriously overestimated the strength required to carry a case of beer.
I don't often find caucasian men personally attractive but the older brother? seems as gentle and considerate as he is big... now that's masculinity
Just love how sweet and gentle they are ❤
<3
❤
I love the sea ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤I'm over obsessed with the ocean❤❤❤❤❤❤i guess I got the right name❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
best channel on youtube no doubt
14:00 i was legit moving my feet every time that stone dropped lool 😂
Certian they stay in invergordon
Looks like one of the boys is also strong ❤❤❤
Awesome! cheers guys!
17:13 ❤
has Eric stopped mentioning this? lol
Lol this was the best and funniest episode
😮😮😮😮😮😮
please come back to Glasgow
I think i smiled the hole video :) <3
These guys are absolute beasts! Seeing their strength up close must have been insane. I can’t believe the things they can lift like it’s nothing!
That skin dude who thought he was huge
Bring these types of videos back!! Why am I crying !? 😅 👏🏼👏🏼✨✨
4:36 kratos 🤯🤯
Got weight lifters giving poppers lolol
I liked how fun this video was =)
If you listen to this video on almost silent (unpurposly) while also not warching it, they aort of all sound like a knock-off version of Thor 😂😂😂
Fat 10’000 calorie americans just look obese this is what 10’000 calories of Scottish looks like why do we Americans make things look so sad 😂
Cute not the Scotland Highlands, The Scottish Highlands
Neither of these men's names are Hafthor Bjornson and I cannot accept the title of this video. Will i still watch it? Of course.
youve met strongest men and sumo and warrior and giants from around the world... trip to party crash a larping event and learn about the culture with some of your real fighter friends like these boys defending their royal YES family ;) open invite to all the people youve met like a reunion meet up and see if youve travelled enough to raise an army  to defend your cause against the invaders ;)
Great vid, in swedish stoltman literally translates in to Proudman,👍
I loved these guys!  Amazing❤
Thank you love this
Where does they get money to support them and training, and costs of everything else
Swear I'm seeing some back to the future.. why does the younger bro look like Eddie Halls son when he's older 😂 some time travelling going on  Ace video tho, these lads are wild
Just amazing people and the support they give each other is amazing ❤
Tom is soooo stinking cute bro, and not just on a handsome level but you can see his genuine personality through the screen, and it's so adorable. Knowing he has Autism is just the nail in the coffin. ❤❤
I've always thought you guys had nice physiques, but sitting next to those big boulders you look like little boys! It's so funny! 😅
Genus Bigus :D
I can’t tell the difference between Eric and that other dude. Are they twins?
Anatoly: I clean here?
bet im part scotish
This is a lime 😂😂😂
I am proud to be Scottish ❤
I have been following you guys and iam inspired by your lifestyle I would like to train,eat and experience a day in the life of a strongman  and would like to compete in one competition.
It was so cute :) Tom's smiling is the best smile I've seen :)
Love this, men being men.  They are not women, not DEI, not Woke, but being who they are good honest masculine men. Thank you for this video.
Strongmen
a day of working out with them would cure my depression and destroy my body.
❤
Psh...Brian Shaw is bigger!
love how much he fell in love weigh lifting ! :D brilliant! if that ain't motivation then idk what is, worlds strongest man cheering you on... popega!
Wow!❤
Omg scottland is so beautiful
Thomas is so tiny lol
4:34  “Aww man fuck you, fuck you for coming”   Kinda rude
That is more than i can eat in a week!
😊 another small tidbit. In Connecticut USA we have a town called Scotland.. and normally they have Highland Games❤❤ big, burly Scottish people throwing around very heavy objects🎉🎉🎉🎉 ladies and men included, and you can get meat pies and fish and chips and buy your family's tartan 😁 I saw it on the news the day I lost my job and went and had a blast!
I just have to reiterate that the Giants are the offspring of the fallen Angels.
The actual first Episode from you Guys to make me cry. Really with no lie. It is amazing to see, where Humans can get If they just believe in themselves
Visit gutespelen at Gotland!
I love the funny moments but I also like the genuine moments too. I'm flt and 40 and I thought the gym would be full of people who would judge me for being smaller. and I'm glad to say my experiences was so far from reality. It's not a strongman style place so nobody was that big. But they were so kind and friendly Like if I was curving my back doing a lat pulldown. They'd just come and help. Not to show they were superior or anything, just to make sure I didn't hurt myself. There are some BIG guys (in the fat way) at my gym too and they're all super supportive of them. One of them explained it to me one day. He said. and I wont forget it. "If you come here and want to improve yourself, we are all brothers"
These 2 are like big cuddly grizzly bears.
i have autism, hearing he did to acually made me feel good i dont know how to explain it, the funny thing is i also love working out!
100kg stone and 80 kg farmers for a first timer is fucking ridiculous!
love your videos :))
These guys are gentle and friendly as much as they are strong very cool video
Big and muscular and autistic yes this is my ideal man ❤ I’m not even kidding match made in heaven
after today it feels good to laugh out LOUD. i skipped past this video and i have no idea why. loved it.
Oh my gorch  that seems to bee very coold indieed 😮
that ain’t holy
Frickin' love the way you found the human angle about men who pursue a physical discipline. Great work- as usual.
Best video ever!!! 😊
Respectfully, that ain't no disability. you are very able TOM STOLTMAN
There are many things I loved about this but k think my favorite is how the actually strongest men on earth, guys who’s dedicated their lives to being physically strong, seem like chill, friendly, warm and just generally loving people. No toxicity or macho.
Hey I love your content! Thanks for showing me the world! side note: You guys might need to fix your mics
WEAKEST MAN WE COULD THINK OF lollllllllll that was great. This visit is 🔥
did his arm break during the arm wrestle? you can hear a crack as soon as it happened
Those 2 boys are gentle giants. One my favorite videos from YesTheory. Would love to visit Scotland one day. What a beautiful country.
Loved this video, thank you!
legendary 😄
loved it
I wanna hang out w the stoltman Bros when I go to Scotland.....
In Viking myth, Giants are also magical.
Where did you get those jackets that you wore to the beach? They look super comfy and warm
Bar none one of the best videos I’ve watched! Thanks for creating and sharing
Great vid 😂 xx

Scottish Highlands
these strongmen are natural at playing hide and seek... i couldnt find them even after hitting pause  amazing people and such warm vibes
The Stoltman brothers seem like such a pleasant pair to be around.
I loved this one !!!
Brian Shaw will use those two "giant" for his biceps warmups..
I hope luke is as proud of himself as we r of him to be that rock for Tom and to watch Tom become the man he is today 3 time worlds strongest man we all need a big brother like luke in r lives the world would be a much happier and safer place
05:54 , thats an image for eternity.
lol awe... the picture of you all eating w the Giants!! That was awesome!!
13:40 i'm sitting here going "AHH HEALTH AND SAFETY!!!"
Eric...good on you! I hope you didn't die afterwards,  but great strength!!
Could Luke read me a bedtime story? Great voice. Great guys!
love it.❤  Such friendly giants... ok they might break your wrist by accident, but they would carry you to the doctor afterwards.
Not me nursing a huge crush on Luke...
The gay cameraman must have been in heaven
I need one of those fr
This is truly one of the most humble, funniest things ever! You guys are awesome 😎 @StoltmanBrothers you truly are amazing, makes me proud to be a Highlander 💪🏼 we all love you! Xx
Incredibly cool guys, the Stoltman brothers, wow!! Hella inspiring, too! ♥️
I know this was a while ago so hope you get this message guys... I just wanted to say it made me smile to know that the 2 strongest men in the world seem to also be 2 of the nicest 😅
This was so funny!! ❤️🤣
This brother is awesome  I like there attitudes.
also cheered wen you guys lifted that stone ...😄👏👏
They looked so comfortable to be slept on top off idky lol
Hi, love your videos but did anyone else spot an aerial shot of Oban with Glasgow written over it? (miles away from Glasgow)
As the saying goes "the north winds made the vikings"
Thanks
can anyone tell me what the name of this beautiful Scottish music 14:14 please
So funny! Loved the vid!❤
The lamp at the end is a killer 😂😂😂
Ok, that was cool. Ty
Meu amigo treinava treinava calestenia era magro tinha 1,75 e 65 kg mas tinha muito força em comparação com caras mais altos e pesados do que ele, na queda de braço era 6 meninas com os 2 braços e ele nem tremia
11:30 essa foi a melhor parte kskskks
Haaa hahahah
they're not giants, they're buccaneers.
Can we talk about Eric lifting over 200 Kilograms?!?!?!
Such cool dudes. Such a funny, good natured episode.
It is awesome that you guys did a video with the Stoltman Brothers! Tom & Luke are wonderful people. Beautiful stuff.
Tom just won his 3rd World's strongest man. On his way to become one of the GOATs
One of the presenters really looks like Ryan Gosling facially. It’s almost distracting.
Man id love to have friends like them
❤
Why is this tilted ""I" spent the day...."?
Still ones of the best you have done. Unreal
I am in love I think I need to go to Scotland, yeah I think I'm moving to Scotland...Defiantly moving to Scotland
These dudes voices matches their massive size 😂
They're like giant teddy bears
Listen who’s strongest man Alexander nope Mitchell hooper nope Joseph greenstone nope Tom stoltman nope Eddie hall nope imam Ali close PROPHET MUHAMMED (SAW) CORRECT
Maan...the guys are sooo sooooo.... humble
They are both such good dudes
Big men with big harts
All that sugar 🤦🏻‍♂️
They looked like they had great sex lol
The loveliest, the most down to earth, all put together 🙏 💓🤗 Love and respect to all of you guys 🙏💓
Gentle giants
This video kept me smiling all the way long! Love the Stoltman brothers!
I've never been thirsty... I just need Luke to cuddle and sing me to sleep... just once
As a huge Stoltman fan I absolutely loved this video ... I haven't watched any strongman stuff since Christmas 2022 because my husband died in January 2023 & we watched all things strongman together, so this video was emotional but cathartic ... I'm a bit of an emotional wreck at the moment, but thoroughly loved this, & I know my hubby would've loved it too ❤💪🏁  As the Stoltman Brothers say ... Stay Strong & Stay Spicy 🌶
imagine being in a braveheart type battle and coming across these mf's on the battlefield....
Get rid of all the other guys except the blonde guy.  All the other guys are a bunch of fucking nerds and a distraction.  You don't need them .
Genuinely this is your best video ever I lived these guys so much!!
Amazingly funny ! Love it
what is the name of the music at 14:15 ?
I just don’t think they can be healthy
I spent good time watching this 😊
I love how their story went through. I love this video..
this was the most frat bro non frat bro video i have ever watched and im here for it
Isn’t the one friend Eric from a law & order Svu episode ? I swear he looks just like the guy from the episode
Definitely visiting that country.
dont use Gods name in vain !!!!
I love these guys
Imagine the size of their turds?
omg this is hilarious with u and these gentle giants:)
most powerful brothers in the world ♥ Stoltman Brothers
i think if the Vikings ever reached the Highlands, History would have been very different
i love the breakfast scene 😁😁😁😁 u guys look so tiny 🤣🤣
Man they should be voice actors too! holy shite!!!
These are the people who can dodge bullets
18:20 was basically Fezzik and Westley in The Princess Bride 😂
I believe in him? How are you so strong? Don’t judge a book any it’s cover.
Eric looks like Sam Loudermilk
if i could learn something from this video is even after an age you still can grow taller and stronger comparably to what science said
Great vid thanks, but they’re the “Scottish Highlands”, or the “Highlands of Scotland”. Nobody ever called them the “Scotland Highlands” til now….
Put shirts on ffs.
All that unnecessary bare chested hugging and bonding and eating bare chested looks really gay. Don't know if that was intentional or not.
Hehehehe I love these guys! You look like you had the best time with them 😅💪🫶 #gdayfromaustralia
that ain’t holy
that ain’t holy
hahahah you really had fun on that on
05:51 Looks like Tom´s head is almost two times the size of your head. And 05:53 Tom looks like he is going to kill and eat the food with his look hahah i can´t. Great videos you guys and yeah, really incredible what those two giants are capable of. Can´t believe how strong they are! Keep it up!
So funny, loved it 😂
i just love this video
Do part 2
Most wholesale testosterone boosting video I have ever seen
They are very strong fat men
I don’t get it, start speaking of the Scottish lifting games and use a picture of people lifting stones in the Basque Country (Spain) where is, by the way, one the most popular competitions too
You guys are definitely changing the world!!! 👍👏👏👏👏👏👏
you cool!!!! from Russia!)
Cool guys
One looks paunchy.
Very nice video 👏
You look bit shrink between two strong men. Please put on your shirt  ..😊
Must be something in the Polish water. First Pudzianowski, now the Stoltman brothers whose grandfather was a Polish refugee.
Как кулачки не сжимай, но ты не мужик, пока юбку не снимешь с себя
Now that's a Yes.... theory 😜
WoW 😮 ... for real 💯💯💯
Why do they look like overgrown toddlers
I love the Stoltman's such pleasant guys. Real life heroes
To fad guys
Thor and Baldur
This was the greatest Video!!!!! Thanks guys!!!! 🤣🤝👍🫶
They are humble and really kind strongman i ever seen
I'm a new subscriber who used to do strongman. Love to see this crossover!
I can't believe you guys are strong
This is the most wholesome video I've ever seen
These guys defy all the stereotype big brother is smart  Younger one is sweet  And both are huge and strong af true giants
You guys are truly wonderful! You truly fit the term of gentle giants!
When the Scottish music starts playing at 14:17 I lost it 🤣🤣🤍never stop making these videos they are the best things on YouTube
The one guy’s face looks like a perfect combination of Chris evans and Ryan gosling
Fantastic video. Had a smile on my face the whole time watching this especially seeing their reaction to you guys lifting the atlas stone
I want to cuddle them 🤗
Funniest episode ever. Loved it
Thank you from Germany
Thank you so much😂😅❤..I enjoyed this greatly and deeply beeing a potential strong man myself..I stopped..growing too fast..too many influencials then did not like..good genes from my so beloved grandfather died to early😥❤️ with who I always watched strongmen competions on tv and all stars wrestling show with Hulk Hogan😅..thanks guys..made my day🎉😂😅❤
That was amazing! Thanks
This is fckn gold!!👏🏽🙌🏽
What a video ! Loved it  !
I am smiling and laughing the entire time i was watching this! You guys are awesome! And the @stoltmanbrothers too!
Great video!
Fantastic story! Well done.
Prolly wont watch in full, so i’ll just ask now; are STEROIDS on board these two giants?   My feeling—AB SO LUTELY
tom now 2 time worlds strongest man! and 2nd place in 2023! amazing
Do strong men eat all the meals with no shirts?
this video made me smile so much. much love for them!
i would love to fight both of them at once.. my god that would be fun.
Thank you so much for this video. Love from India to the world’s strongest men. Love to be their friends.
Start to finish I was smiling and having almost as much fun as you guys!! The stoltman brothers have done Scotland proud and both show how fun, welcoming and dedicated our country can be! Well done lads !! Alba gu brath 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I don’t know why, but as soon as it cut to all 5 of you sitting at the table shirtless, I started DYING laughing 😂
@thestoltmanbrothers are such gentle souls.
this is the best sport device ! We need that in each geriatry or revalidation hospitals !
Great story of two brothers
imagine being the sister or daughter of these 2 giants. i'd feel so safe.
When you talk about world famous sporting heroes from scotland  people seem to forget about these two but what they’ve achieved is outstanding! I live not too  far from invergordon and it’s good to hear a local accent , proper inverness/ highland twang on  tv on the worlds strongest man each year….refreshing change from weegie or just central belt which is what most people think all Scot’s sound like!
I am so envious that you decide on a place you want to go and you just get on a plane and go. No fear no discomfort just go I love watching your videos because I feel like I’ve gone with you. Thank you very much and please continue to do what you do by the way I’m 66 years old and I loved every one of your videos. Thank you.
Truth be told, you could work both of them if you wanted to. Just don't let them get ahold of you.
15:17 my man even got that giant roar😮
this was so- manly? a very fun and inspiring watch tho. love it.
"I'm 70 kilos..." "-That's cute innit?" lmao
Who else is thinking about  armwrestling with them when your hand is smaller then their ..... 😂
Only real men work out insanely hard, and then just to be cool as hell, thumb wrestle. 😎
On your Nordic Trak commercial before I get back to the video: are there any fit ladies that naturally  have a bit more chunk in their dunk, to keep me to make me feel like I'm not staring at some kind of unattainable goal and give up? (No Jorginho please)
Anyone know the bagpipe song playing at 3:05 - 3:24 ? Absolutely mesmerizing and haunting at the same time.
I keep thinking about "The Princess Bride" when I hear their voices!. Straight Andre the Giant vibes. And they're just as lovely as him. I met a giant like him once. His roundhouse could've sent me to heaven. He allowed me to kick him hard enough during sparring, so I knew how to fight someone his size, to the point he was bruised. I imagine that it didn't hurt him too much but it seemed like we helped each other. However, this person would give Batman a run for his money. I don't suggest looking for him 😅
these guys seem sooooo nice omg i wanna meet them
14:26 even More Impressive!!!!!!
14:05 Very impressive!!
Love everything about this video! Thanks for sharing!
oh man  I LOVE maltesers
Love the 2 giants!!
This was a great episode! As a father of a son with autism, I appreciated that level of sharing. Much appreciated  💪🏽🙂 #newsubscriber
Gentle giants <3
Send to Japan and sumo wrestling 😮
Nice giants.....  Real rough warrior viking men  Not these days feminine wannabe fashion clowns busy with clothes and hair.....gays these days
It is so great how you jsut can´t stop smiling while watching the video! It hypes you up so much watching them go at it!
come to kenya next
aw man these guys are absolute gentle giants haha
The bigger they look, the more they r like child inside 😅
It said glasgow but showed a pic of oban😅
I am really enjoy this video, It was so funny, love all you guys!
This is just great!So very cool.
I really feel like young men could benefit a great deal from these strongmen, especially at this fragile time. Masculine while still being supportive of each other and down to earth.
A great video and warm people.
Soooooo hilarious they so small compared to the other guys
you guys look so tiny sitting next to them. (no offense just facts. lol)
How many times do you eat in a day  Reply : Sex
the thumbnail looks like a porn cover (:
I just watched it realizing the city seen in the shot written Glasgow over it, is actually the city of Oban. I would be curious how that happened. Apart from that, nice video. :D
I watched Tom compete last night and was so impressed and inspired. I found this today and appreciate these strong men at a whole nother level. They're so adorable and kind.
Please help me to build my house ❤ for my family ❤
5:40 the look he gives is like hi u might be the next meal
I have autism and this was truly inspiring to be honest
Incredible!!!
#GentleGiants
gayest video I’ve seen today
weird comment at 1:45. little bit flexing. just because you are pulling things, or lifting them up? i dont think so.
Did you have to sit between them 🤣🤣🤣.
Those guys are awesome!
Tgis video made me a subscriber. Those massive men are so inspiring and so humble. I hope to see them more, hopefully, in movies.
Come to Pakistan
I heard thomas hand crackinggggggg😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
No disrespect to them but a lot of guys look up to bodybuilders like Schwarzenegger, Ferrigno, and Coleman....but these strongmen are who I look up to. They seem so cool, and really down to earth
This video is priceless
those brothers are awesome
I love that homie surprised everyone... myself included!
I smiled every single second  of this video
Lots of dudes with their shirts off hugging in this video. Dont they call this bears and twinks?
I love how the guy they were all making fun of turned out to be so strong!
Proud to be scottish throughout history weve always been known to be strong and resilient these two brothers prove thats true till this day👌🏼
2:11 That is a photo of Oban! Not Glasgow!
You made this extremely fun, all of you, thank you.
I want offer them to be sumo wrestlers
thy should do that slap thing at ufc
This has to be your funniest video ever 😂👍
Are they the kindest lifters in the world as well ? My god, they seem so freaking friendly and awesome ! This must have been a blast to film :)
Why don’t the strong men that are huge Drive bigger cars and be a little more convenient for them and they’re size lol
Real strong men are kind. what a pure of joy video. I love gym and it gave me strength, stoicism and more positivity. Thank you for the video!
Boys will be boys 🤣
The hulk man.. thier so big and macho😊❤
I'm glad they are not pillaging villages anymore.
would love to be hugged by them !!
Been watching WSM man for my whole life and these brothers are the best thing to come put pf the UK. So down to earth
one of the best YT videos yet
LITERALLY the greatest thing ever! Thank you so much for sharing this.
9:54 that’s concerning
I'm crying because I'm laughing so hard. What a great bunch of guys.
Go to Sudan or Egypt, these guys have nothing on Them.
Way to go Eric!! Awesome job to all of you guys for going out there and being so willing to try everything the brothers do on a daily. ❤
When that guy was swinging that ball on a chain around his head, I swore he was going to hit his head and that ball  was going to drive that chain around his neck. I wonder how many times someone has died from those sports.
this makes me proud to be Scottish
i love how the guy they said was the weakest is out showing them i love it, totally gives me inspiration to work out
their voices my god
wow! so fun! what hot sweet guys!
This video is just awesome
so giants and cuties at the same time😍😍
This is the cutest video ever.
Those two gentle giants are so likeable.
Tom you’re a legend, my son is also autistic. ❤
👍👍👍👍makes me wonder about their cholesterol levels though eating that many eggs!
Bro got some weak ass friends. Shout outs to him for being the only one to man up!
5:47 Just look at this part omg 😂
These guys would be VERY expensive to feed at the moment
He has autism??Wowww, what he does is even more amazing.
15:11 Something out of God of War
What a show!!! I really enjoyed it! And these Scots are real benevolent giants!!! Beautiful!👏👏👏💪
TROPPO SIMPATICI :)
Hey @SeekDiscomfort! Come hang out with us in Kenya. We are an incredible community!
we need more content like that
that whas so wholesome
What a lovely, beautiful and humble Giants this video makes me alive God bless you guys ❤
so wholesome !
It’s so awesome to see these men showing such brotherly love and affection is a healthy wholesome way
I’m absolutely smitten with these two! They have the most lovely, infectious dispositions of kindness and positivity - I am struck by the notion that I want to be their friend. 😊
See my man looking so small in their midst 😂😭
Anatoly wants to come visit and cleaning that place 😆
Way to start the day, the swim Handsome gentle giants ❤❤❤
I think it’s funny that you all tried to take the weakest man with y’all and he was the strongest haha
Thomas look just like jespher from klaus when sit next to big guy
Tom’s smile at 5:50 when his weight is mentioned lol soooo good! 👏👏❤❤
Being strong starts inside
The Stoltman Brothers are awesome. To learn that Tom has Autism makes him even more incredible
What is the bagpipe song at 03:20 ish ?
I want to meet these blokes!!
So Scotland huh... are all the men there this beefy and adorable? I mean dang! I'm living on the wrong continent
Great job, guys. very awesome 👌 💯
Their voices are so deep that it almost sounds fake!!!
Very nice job gents. I had a smile on my face from start till end. Keep up the great content.
These guys are awesome! I love the video
damn they cant find tom lol
I love the deep laugh 😂
You need to hang out with Brian shaw, Eddie Hall, Nick
As an autistic weightlifter: You're my hero for sure, Tom!
I herniated my L5/S1 in landscaping lifting tree root balls. The rounded backs lifting the stone balls just hurt me deeply just watching :(. But the guys were so awesome and polite that it looked worth it.
Stoltman Bro's should be cast on the next Viking series
These two are my favorite strongmen. They are 2 of the most genuine dudes on the planet. I wish I could meet them for an hour, let alone a few days haha. I did get to see Luke in the London airport once. He walked by and I said Hi, but i was so shocked to see him, it barely came out and my friends even said they couldn't hear it haha.
This is the most inspirational thing I've seen in a very long time.  Thanks guys for this great program.  How much love does Luke have in his heart to have shown the way for his younger brother like this.  It's wonderful.  They remind me of two bears.  A polar bear and a grizzly bear.
So hot
You need simple guy Anatoliy
....when you climb up the beanstalk to fight the giants, but end up hanging out with the chill dudes 🤣
insane deep voice oO wtf!
You guys got along so well. Thats amazing
That's awesome!!!! ❤❤❤❤ roza bedad here
Brill😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😂😂😂❤
Eric had better technique. That's why he could lift stuff.
what about Big Z??? Zydrunas Savickas WORLD STRONGEST MEN
imagine you're in the Vikings times and you've just an average human height and your going to duel at one of this guys with a large axe ready to chop you down but you don't have a choice cuz it's a warrior tradition💀💀
It's funny they eat 10,000 cal a day its exactly the same as the sumo wrestler video, just work out different, I'd love to see strong man vs sumo haha
Love those brother’s!!
Love those brother’s!!
Call anatoly, he needs to just clean there
Come to Brazil guys... thanks
My testosterone level went over the roof watching this video🤭
True sons of Behemat
choo choo
You guys are awsome at making your dokumentations!   I nearly peed laughing from the "hide and seek" bits🤣
9:50 "That's cute, innit?"😂😂😂
this was like watching a cartoon. They're strong but they're way too cute
and at the and I cried. what a wholesome video
Absolutely brilliant!!  Thanks so much.
Tell them to pay the  tax for the ford blue pls
You started out by calling Eric the weakest, and then he just smokes the both of you :D haha... GO ERIC!
I honestly wish strongmen these days would be natural, and even since these guys aren't I really wish they shared their childhood photos and also taken maybe yearly photos of their progress through teenage years to adulthood so you can truly see when their transformations happen.
1:31 how the fuck do you not mention Brian Shaw (10 podium finishes WSM)
It's crazy that two brothers both agreed to take steroids for so many years
This was such a wholesome video. I loved it 💗💗
Strongmen drive on the wrong side of the road??
I was diagnosed with autism in November of 2022 and it’s so cool to find out that the worlds STRONGEST man has autism when many people view us as weak and incapable
3:05 starts a bagpipe song, does anybody knows the name of the song?
This was great
日本の相撲やってみれば？
god they are all so sweet!! awwww love you all!
Beautiful story! Thank you for sharing your experiences!
Totally rad dudes! Mad respect to these pair of giants! Seem like really great lads to have a point with..
Dudes are freaking awesome there spirit for life is contagious
yeah, sugars, the important food group!
Dam those deep voices! oh im loving that!
This was so uplifting and an absolute joy to watch. Blown away by how genuinely kind and friendly the Stoltman bros are. You all hit it off like you'd been mates forever. Loved it!
Sauces party with giants sounds like an exciting and unique event!  😆
"completed it mate"
Such a shame you missed the part of their "training" where they take steroids ^^
damn that small guy is strong!
Wow, you guys remind me of my youth...For the record, I ended up having back surgery,  wear a lifting belt...Great video,  was very entertaining.
Thomas looked like such a little skinny marink sitting between those two giant strongmen at breakfast. Eric and Tommy are such good sports.
So Entertaining Man. Fun, Laughter, Friends.
How innocent and cute these Giant from inside. ❤❤❤😊
Wow how kind and genuine they are... Just look at them... Such a lovely soul.. ❤
Damn they have such a deep voice :DD Thats fcking insane
oh god they are so cutee!!!!
I loved that giant man❤
Don't forget lots of PED's lmao
Am i the only one to be able to tell the guy in the video has an artificially deep voice? This is from androgenic steroids use. The damage to the vocal cords are irreversible and permanent. Why are these ppl allowed to compete in anything?
Jesus is the strongest man
I absolutely love these guys, they're 2 of the kindest souls on this planet
send the curly haired one to westmnimster abbey today.
ya not actually giants.
I work with children with autism. I am going to show them this. Really inspiring. Well done guys ✨
Please, someone tell me the bagpipe music that starts at 3:10, it sounds so good.
That one kid is pretty Strong!
I would love to see their performance against Turkish oil wrestlers.
Can’t believe you guys were in Scotland, wish I knew at the time
Im thinking about t fate of a thief..who broke in to thier house..😅
It's wonderful to see these guys get some light. They're absolutely wonderful men that are pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible.
Giants arent re.... WELL NEVER FUCKING MIND
great giants! great video!
These dudes are basically Thor from god of war
They look like they are ready to hunt a dragon
Pregnant ?
Really like the energy behind this. :)
Dude they’re like stereotypical Scottish giants, would be dope lord of the rings characters lol
These guys are the best example of being strong!!!! Relaxed , sensitive , integral and hardworking !!!! I love this video !!!!
Great video!
whether he is ready to donate his sperms
I think it's awesome that there are these 2 cool guys who seem down to earth and non judgmental. I can't imagine standing next to them. I'm 5'4 lol. I would not like the polar plunge but I would like the group half naked hug haha. Eric’s strength is unreal. I think the brothers story about overcoming obstacles in life and just their general message on how they came to be who they are today is very uplifting (no pun intended) and wonderful. They are remarkable folks. I wish all the best for them.
YOOOOOOO THIS IS AWESOME
Anybody knows the song at 14:20 ?
Beautiful !
image what is to be a large beast today, the only option for you is to be a kind of "сircus freak", train to entertain
They don’t really look giant , just giant muscle and giant stomach , a giant appetite.
Awesome guys all of you! =)
I'm a huge Strongman fan and the Stoltmans are two of my favorites. Clearly just the nicest guys ever. Honestly the sport of Strongman just wouldn't be the same without them. It's cool you guys did this video because I also happen to enjoy the Seek Discomfort channel. 2 for the price of 1! 💪
Why do they think they need all this. Just being a big guy doesn’t mean you have to have a buffet everyday…lol that’s ridiculous and gross. Forceful eating. Ew they even look un proportioned. Build wise. Not healthy.
Heart warming & absolute happiness
Woahh
Man these guys are so awesome, being the strongest man and so humble and fun.
song used at 3:04 is  as loch awe weeps by deskant thank me later
big Z🎉
Great stuff, love the stoltman bros!
The idea of living in the Scottish highlands and lifting rocks for a living sounds lovely honestly lol.  All those endorphins from all that exercise probably feel amazing! They seem like such great people.
I love the giants so sweet ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I don’t even understand how they have the time to eat 10,000 without drinking or intravenously consuming most of it. That’s so much chewing!!! The breakfast scene did remind me of the scene in the Hobbit at Bilbo’s with all the dwarves tossing food around which was very cute.
You have huge muscles and you're also amazingly humble * --*
imagine dating a girl and she wants you to visit her at home and than her father appears which is a giant like those.. id runned for my life
Scol giants
5:26 “it’s to kinda get the sugars going” 😂😂😂
I love men but are these even the same species 🌹🌹🌹👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🦾🦾🦾
We continue this tradition till this day I won my primary schools Highland games for my school I’m trans FtM but my caber toss beat both the females and males I came in first … benefits of a six foot on his hind legs and 200lbs German shepherd in my youth 😂
Love this videos very much ,you guys are so humble ,down to earth and very kind , I think i wanna be just like you guys and be the strongest woman on earth .  🇨🇦
This was very cute and entertaining 😄
"My thumbs are way bigger than yours" 😭
Rooting for Tom to win wsm 2023
Giant and strongest is the separate side of same coin..some giant aren't strong Nor the strongest is the giant....😮and our strongest man isnt a giant of 8\9 feets..
18:27 I SPAT OUT MY COFFEE THE WAY HE JUST STANDS THERE LIKE A LAMP I CAN'T
Tommy's a beast...
that was so funny😂
You guys are awesome, just laughing the whole time.
haha I love how wholesome this video is. takes me back to my childhood and having fun.
They were family as soon as they met.
Those guys are massive... I bet the ladies love them... 😂
the softest yet biggest teddy bears out there😂❤
Bro, Kushi tatooo, im tattoooooed
HULKS SMASH!!
I wish Tom the best of luck. I’m sure he’d be a different person had it not been for weight lifting ✌🏾
Men sees rock, men grab rock, men lift rock, men happy:)
I totally enjoyed this, laughed out my axxx,  guys come to Nigeria
I clinched my buttcheeks when the brothers picked up all tommy, Eric, Thomas plus the Scottish bench lol. Easily top 10 videos. Thank you yes theory for taking them up on the offer. The stoltman brothers story and their bond made it that much special ❤
Wait till I tell my 7 year old autistic son about Tom being autistic and being world strongest man too! He is going to be in awe!
good humble people...long life :)
I didn't see the part where the loading their ass cheeks up with steroids
That was funny! And inspiring
I smiled the whole time I was watching this! They seem so cool and down to earth.
Eric was actually doing really good, maybe there is potential in that? Since he wasnt trained for it but yet managed to do 3 exercises. And the stoltman brothers actually being shocked
Recently subscribed with #StoltmanBrothers 😎
These brothers are so great!!!
IM AUTISTIC, SHY AND ANXIOUS 😨
OH MY GOD IM AUTISTIC AS WELL THIS IS SO MOTIVATING BROO
Love it so awesome  they seem like wonderful kind men just wouldn't want to make them mad
This made me smile and laugh the whole time. So much fun to watch
has anyone ever told you that you that you look like Ryan Gosling
I'm thankfull most of this is shirtless, thank you. thank you.
damn.
„Thats the manliest thing ive ever heard „😂
You can tell a man is a man when he wears a kilt.
So with Tommy aka "TD", I thought for months you guys were calling him "Tiddy" lmao
man what a video who would have thought that these giants would have such a innocent heart and they would be so soft inside (in a good way abviously) so wholesome video smiled and liked it thorough out and just wanna say keep working hard
I would give anything to go meet and train with the brothers love them to bits true inspiration UK produces some fine strongmen
Eheheh ... I love u alls Boys TX 💜💜🧞🧙🤠🏴‍☠️🏄🙏
This is so wholesome 😁 that's why i love the fittness community
This video has an abnormally high amount of views/likes/comments, even for this channel's standards :D.
Roids and eating enough food to reverse climate change.  Urrrggggggggggggggggggg.
Leaving a comment for part 2 please
I live near Inverness  it's nice there
Holy cow! He was arming wrestling 3 men, and still won. Incredible
OMG.  I cant believe that eat like that ever single day.
Thank you. Great story.
i couldn't stop smiling this was such a wholesome video
When these giants smile....Seems like the whole world is instantly ✨✨charmed ! ✨✨
Imagine if you’re a police officer and you have to arrest one of these guys for causing trouble. 😂
Love Eric 🤩 that's what the rest deserved for calling you weak 😉
The editing at 11:15 was hilarious!
To cute 😘😂🤣 l enjoy watching thanks guys.
The smaller bro doing stuff that guys 3x his size can do is mighty impressive. Built pretty solid.
5:44 He's like the shark in Nemo. I'm nice but if something changed that I could eat you in a few bites.
Love this best video on the internet...
That was a fun watch
God damn those are giants those are behemoths 💀
I'm really glad the strongest guys on earth are such genuinely friendly people. I'd be pretty scared if those two were trying to use their strength to become super villains lmao
Down to earth person...
deepest voice in the business
This was great to see haha really entertaining I was waiting for one to fart off lifting 🤣
I'm sure they're naturally great at picking up chicks
this video put a huge smile on my face and i couldn’t stop laughing these guys r awesome and the yes crew spending time with them was great❤
Literally caught myself smiling through the entire episode. You guys are contagious and doing great things Giants and no giants. Love it!
How is he so stong? One of your crew members 🤗😅
I'm TORN! This is really fun and heart warming to watch. but put some clothes on, for Christ's sake! This is SO GAY!!
At 1st thought wtf then watched 5 mins was crying with laughter 😃
Even their voice is giant-like :D great videos guys ! Keep it up
Totally loved watching this video! Thank you ❤ So well put together and so entertaining. Really made my day.
Sweet guys. Those workouts look like so much fun (and wonderful misery). Can’t help thinking about road trips with my brothers, laughing at dumb jokes and having farting contests. Very wholesome.
16:58 Some facts about Tom from his wiki page:    > Height - 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)    > Weight - 397 lb (180 kg  Strongman stats:    > Deadlift – 430 kg (950 lb)    > Squat – 391 kg (862 lb)    > 18-Inch Deadlift – 478 kg (1,054 lb)    > Axle Press – 190 kg (420 lb)    > Keg Toss – 7.50 m (24.6 ft)     > Flinstone Barbell – 240 kg (530 lb)
When he dived in the water why did it go plop like that 😂😂😂😂
I think any of us could lift mountains if we had that deep scottish voice telling us to "squeeze et in theere!"
Bro i thought this was straight genetics, i assumed they were bulky kids..very motivating
Nice work I'm really excited to this video and it's very important to me and thank you for getting videos like this keep it up
Eric omgggg 🤣🙌🙌
These men know how to eat omg 😂🙌
If the autism wasn't mentioned I wouldn't even know
This was so wholesome..and what a wonderful and inspirational story! Glad that this appeared in my feed. Hilarious part towards the end. Luke, you are the best brother one can have and Tom, indeed you are going to change some kids' lives! And to the Yes Team, keep doing what you are doing!
The fact you can see the muscle on the gut is insane
I can sympathize with Eric, some people are just built DENSE. We don't get big bulky muscles, but throw us at something heavy and we'll move it.
The GD comment around 13 minutes… why?
I haven't laughed this hard in a long time! Love you all!
wow,didnt think it would be interesting video ofr me personaly,but wow,im smileing all over the place :D Thank you all for this!! Bless!
Tom, what a legend.
I’m so happy i watched this Video!!!
What an absolutely inspirational video!! Thank you as a father with an autistic child, anything is possible!!! These guys prove it!!
they look like hhobbits hahah
Lol I watched this with my kids and we all cheered when you lifted the 100KGs. 🎉
the most nice guys ever seen in strongman world ✔️✌️ down to earth and full of life
I have to say, I'm autistic and I just started going to the gym this year because of Tom Stoltman and it has already helped me massively. Thank you for your example Tom
I love how you put the skinniest guy between the two big guys at breakfast.
The big guy was talking with bold fonts bro🤣
Thank you for not pronouncing Glasgow as "GlassCow" 🥲
That was a beautiful video
Gynoooooooo
First thing came to my mind when i saw those is Thor From God of War Ragnarok .  anyone else ?
Sometimes I watch these videos and feel like I was born in the wrong region and live in the wrong culture.  I feel as if I should have been raised more or less around Scottland or Scandinavia.  I am definitely a decendant of those cultures and the old Norse Era has fascinated me since I was a child.  These days my culture is more interested in the latest consumer fads and gender politics.  It all makes me sick, I was born for more than this, I want to reconnect with my roots.
Really enjoyed the gentle giants playing with you guys like rag dolls. They were down to earth and very likable
this was awesome!
really loved watching the three stoltman brothers workout
what a time does this gaint need to be train 🤣🤣🤣
So much fun! 🎉🎉
Very cool!
They can be in movies
Man, you three are awesome and the two giants are awesome. Y'all had fun and I had fun watching.
trt and roids not included today
poor Thomas 😅
9:50 That's cute ineee 😂🤣
One of the most genuinely humorous & humblest videos I have ever watched. Another fan here for sure as it was so  refreshing to see how down to earth these guys are as professional sportsmen. They have both gone through all the ups & downs in life, and they have never forgotten  where they came from in order to be who they are now.🙂👍
Absolutely BRILLIANT
So I’m in love with Scottish giants…? Why did I have to print in America?
bro the My thumbs are way bigger than yours part was kinda scary ngl :0 :)
Note the difference in how a real strong man looks and how a body builder looks. If you watch Olympic weight lifting and strong man competitions the body composition has more body fat than a body builder, the male body looks like that not shredded.
Just amazing video, people and lessons!
This is one of the coolest videos I have seen in a while

this is a lime 😂😂😂
This is the most man on man hugs I've ever seen in YouTube. Pretty cool they were all having such a great time!
If seen so many strongmen video where Eddie, Brian, Luke etc are next to each other and they look normal human size   But when you put actual normal humans besides them .... Holy shit the difference is wild
12:28 Eff it, I'm a Stoltman! 🤣🤑
This was fun to watch. Good job on the video guys! I'll be checking for more like this!
Lifting the ball was impressive! Great job!
giants are funny but real giants in life are those persons who do good things and not those who can carry weight like a donkey.
I love how they said that they brought the weakest man on this trip, but I do believe he threw that  sandbag way higher than either of you 2 did over that 6-meter bar! He's going to be talking about this for the rest of his life. I think that is a good thing. I agree you cannot judge a book by it's cover! This video was great. There's nothing like the Scottish accent. Makes me want to go and watch Braveheart now. Thanks for this wonderful video and taking a peek into the worlds strongest men's lives. Thoroughly entertaining
Take away their steroids and they are nothing. Why would anyone want to shorten their life and die from heart disease at a young age in order to be muscled up? Be happy with the muscles God gave you and don't mess with that crap. You don't need muscles like that today, we can carry guns for self defense.
Their voices sound like they've been pitched down 🤣
Those brothers are absolutely wonderful human beings. What a joy to get to know them!
aye ye make me proud of scotland
This was really well put together, these guys seem like two of the most genuinely good dudes you could meet. I had a bloody good laugh watching this, and almost feel like getting off my arse and getting into shape... almost 🤣
God bless you both. Gentle giants. Inspirational to lot of kids and youngster. By the way your hometown is so beautiful. With love and wishes from Tamilnadu (South India)
This is so inspiring, I really enjoyed this. What lovely giants they are! :)
You look so small beside them.
I'm with everyone else here, I smiled all the way through this video.
Love seeing the interview with a neurodivergent/autistic strongman. That's amazing and such a huge inspiration for others with neurodivergence to see we can truly do anything we set our minds to...even being the strongest person. I think it's important because neurotypical people will often put limitations on people with these conditions. I have adhd myself and despite the stuff I go through mentally it helps me massively as a creative person.
10k calories holycrap..
That man forever has a place in voice acting + narrating, WOW
This so wholesome :)
Luke's voice can deadlift 100kg
Inspiring. Good content. Good luck with your sport. You guys are great
Hide and seek genuinely made me burst out laughing 😂❤
Fkn awesome yo.. Realtalk 💯🤑💰🤑💰 504 fa life..N.O.L.A.
Man that experience was amazing, congrats to your team and those big guys!
This was so wholesome 😊
😅So wholesome!!!!
the big brother have a voice to narrative a movie with morgan freeman some shit like that love those two giants btw wish i could be friends with them
amazing! 2:49
Strong man makes weakman strong
The title is misleading. I don't see me there anywhere
400 years ago they would have been conquering the world
Really enjoyed this episode. So happy to have discovered this channel.
I can't be the only one who watched this and kept thinking 'hobbitses' as the halflings gambolled around the Big People.
I came back to watch this video for the third time just for the 5:50.
This is so great! I love this video!  I'm sorry i dont know your names. I love how the big guy stares down at the little guy (normal human) after saying I eat 10,000 calories.
I loved this so much!
That is a great heartwarming video.
Regular person: -I ’m 70 kilos  Big guy: -that’s cute innit  Everyone: he he 👀
These guys definitely work hard to be this powerful, but when you look at their sheer size, they are definitely also naturals, like many men from those countries are. Pure Viking blood.
Finally I saw real giant😆and the cutest 😊
Holy shit lifting literally cured his autism lmao
American dude: “I’m 70 kilograms” Scottish dude: ”… that’s cute”
Scotland is absolutely beautiful !
epic!!! So eating is work, too😚😂
The scene at breakfast with everyone shirtless had me rolling. Quite the contrast.
these fellas are great genuine good lads
So strong men love to hug ? yeh i'm cool with that they look like great huggers
If they are so big why are you standing behind them in the thumbnail. Fk this kind if crap
Race realism is science, West Africans are the fastest , East Africans are the Kings of long distance and Europeans are the best Swimmers and the strongest men in the world, prove this comment wrong or make excuses that I'm wrong.
Now this is the beauty of being a giant and intelligent in equal measure.
Are these guys have pure muscle through training and food or they also use PED ?
This channel makes my inner child very happy somehow
You werent lying when you said giants lol
3:05 does someone know the name of this song?
WOW !!
4:12 That drop sound lmfao and that scream. It went from Braveheart to "Holy Shit that's Cold" in 2 seconds.  Aww man these guys are awesome. Totally relaxed. People lovers and that is just their way of life like it's breathing air. I can imagine it wasn't easy growing up having Autism. But don't ever believe there is something like normal people or those that aren't. Only because they don't think or move like everyone else. I only call something a disability when you allow it to drag you down.  As this video shows all you need is some mutual respect and just have a good time.
Really good guys, so friendly, such nice natures.  Thanks for this!!
Take away the STEROIDS and watch as the FAKE STEROID muscles WITHER away!  ROIDERS are FAKES!  Stay natural buddy!
This is so wholesome 😂❤
Wholesome Content Alert! So fun!
Okay this was fun
I am so inspired by these guys! I just wanted to say that I don't think autism is a disability, it's just a different way of thinking. I think we could all learn so much from people with different ideas and ways of thinking. Just because you're not neurotypical, it doesn't mean your worth is less or you dont have amazing, creative or really insightful ideas. My hope for people with autism is that they don't feel like they don't fit into society because society is made so much richer for having different perspectives and ways of thinking. I think we could all learn from each other a lot more if we gave people more of a chance.
THEIR VOICE IS SO DEEP WTF
Nordictrac would probably not have been pleased if you had these guys run on one for the ad lol.
great video dudes
see society, this is peak physique
Lovely Giants
No steroids at all , this is amazing.
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
A six-fingered Amorite like Goliath (9 1/2' approx.) could easily have pulled the limbs off these men like a spider.  Very easily indeed.  These men are not giants, they are very strong men indeed but certainly not giants.  Giants could kill adult lions with their bare hands.  RE  "Fritz Zimmerman" for PROOF of very real giants.
truly friendly giant hahahahaha
I get why you do this arghhh 😂😂
world strongest men is Pudzianowski
Well this was a lot of wholesome fun! I am so happy I was recommended this!
Love the breakfast picture!! Frame it!!
I'm not even exaggerating when I say this is honestly some of the most adorable, wholesome content on the internet. I LOVED the energy, the positivity and just the team hype. I have such a respect for what they have to go through to achieve greatness. Loved this so much!!!
What a beautiful relationship the brothers have.  It is very fulfilling to see.
If you know the history of Northern Scotland you'd know that these boys almost certainly have significant Viking DNA.
those dudes are nice! <3 cant stop laughing and smiling! great!
Dude this is just the most inspiring shit i've ever seen
That's cute in'nit
Jesus...that deep cave voice....is something...
These guys look like so much fun. 😁
Stolt man in Swedish means Proud man in English :-)
I get the feeling all these guys would just walk around naked if they could, they all seem so comfortable with each other 🤣🤣 great video
It's always the people with the biggest hurdles in life that become the biggest conquers in history. Those people usually train the hardest and never take no for an answer. I love underdog stories. It gives me hope for humanity. I love when people have humble beginnings, those are the people that get the most respect, those are the people who inspire me.
I would booger hook these two. One with each hand, and bonk their heads together.
Imagine that man coming off a boat roaring at you ... 😳  descendents of vikings for sure
Alternate Title: *I Spent a Day in Iceland*
I really hope the CIA hasn't "taken care" of you yet
For the amount of eggs they eat they kinda butchered that mountain of scrambled would-be fowl
I am starting a plumbing business with my best friend and we've been open for less than 6 months(This has been scary) but this video has showed us both that threw hard work and dedication you will accomplish your dreams. Thank you so much to YES theory for giving us the opportunity to watch and learn what these two people's message's are to the world !!!!@Stoltman Brothers All the best for 2023!!!!
Gute Männer.
I was born in Inverness. Up the Jocks.
Guys when you flashed up Glasgow, you showed an aerial shot of Oban, 100 miles away.
whoa someone help me out here. why is the small guy so strong? i'm impressed
You guys are genuinely nice blokes. Cheers lads and food luck with your future competitions!
@06:05 while they become Strongest MEN, i might become DIABETIC DUDE from eating just 5000 Calorie.
they look so nice
Never seen any of your vids before, this was awesome.
I need a big boy, give me a big boy, i want a big boy
That is nothing,a woman can do that using woman power.
2 times strongest man in the world now
Children of Thor
I adore the fact that you can basically watch ANY video with a strongman in it. And they are all sooooo supportive towards each other and the people that try there routines.
What lovely people.
Put those brothers to play the War of God's
This video was inspirational. I have a daughter with autism and people are always questioning her abilities and I'm not proud of it but sometimes even I may let her give up or take a short cut because of  her disability. To know that the strongest man in the world could overcome similar hurdles will never allow me to doubt my daughters abilities (with in reason) man those guys are monsters! Great video.
Without all the gear they're on, they'd look absolutely different
wow.  beautiful video and trip.  ive just seen this one and your mad honey adventure and im really impressed and pleased by your work.  great job guys.
Title should be "Getting manhandled by Giants".
Really enjoyed that ...Legends 😍😍😎😎
just gone back to back world strongest man. amazing
I knew it was going be Scotland or iceland😂
i would really love to meet these brothers
Damn! Eating that much I bet they REALLY REALLY blow the toilet up! Logs the size of trees! Lol
Jotun
HIS VOICE IS SO DEEP AND THICK! THEY ARE SO FRIENDLY AND FUN TO BE AROUND THEM.
Wow how did he overcome autism that's amazing he seems completely normal
Eh, why are you guys sitting shirtless eating? Come on... Lame
I love them🥰
Nice 😃
i cannot lie, i was all teeth and cheering with you guys. its 11:36 pm in Guyana rn 😂
No one's gonna talk about how Eric fucking nailed it dor someone his size??? Pretty impressive!
You guys look like little kids next to these big bros!  😂
i have power lifter but seeing theses guys i did wet my panties flipinng ekk
these two are legends
whos kushi
maybe dont take a photo of Oban and put ''Glasgow'' on it 🥲
🤣🤣I was laughing hard when he search them in drawer 😂😂. That was fun bro. The day with ❤ beautiful memories
at 2:12 there is the name Glasgow attached to the aerial view of the Oban. So please do not look for the tower structure in Glasgow.
I didn't know he had autism im glad I watched this I already respected them with very high regards but now it is 100% higher amount of respect to do what he does and struggle with what he does is just magical iam so happy to have watched this video
Yup... This are MEN. 🤣🤣🤣
Of course strongmen are nice they've probably never experienced someone being mean to them irl friendliness is all you know when you can pick up someone and throw them 2.7 miles
I dont see eddie hall here? You said strongest nor thor either
I spent the day with giants who look 7 months pregnant
This made me smile ear to ear. Good hearted fun and inspiration.
I want to gu the brothers, SO MUCH! Beautiful humans.
What an experience. Honestly amazing to watch
Yo this shit was mad wholesome!!
The bros getting excited  over him completely  1 atlas stone was  class
4:36 kushi
That was awesome!😂😂😂😂
Thank you guys for this this will inspire so many people even myself thank you so much
They musst shit like Elephants!! Poor Anus
I can't stop giggling watching this video. Such great guys 😊This gave me such good vibes.
homo one and two, and the lady-boy.
These guys seem awesome!!!
Tom just has the best cheeky schoolboy grin
Gentle Giants!  Awesome video and story.
This was so freaking wholesome. Thank you
With over 7 trillion people on this planet I find it laughable that these two men are the strongest or biggest but nice try man. lol Sure is amazing tho that you picked Scottish Brothers =)
This genuinely left a smile on my face such a great video!
wow, eric .. did amazing.. wow
Brian shaw is the strongest man in world
These dudes are the legit real descendants of the Nephilim.
strength!
World's strongest men are such gentlemen? Would have been hard to believe if not for this video. Great job folks.
Enjoyed this
this video was truly beautiful
Follow the 10 commandments Christians and ask for forgiveness and repent from your sins so you go to heaven!!
Lol I feel like this ep could be turned into a compilation of just these guys screaming and it would be like 10 minutes long 😂
Such awesome men and awesome story!  Amazing brothers!
OK kids, can you say hernia? 😂
Both seem like really nice humans respect earned
I never weighted under 220 lbs since  day of  my 13th birthday   looool
👀 what's next
Thumbnail is so deceptive.  Sure they are bigger than you but stand in line with them instead of 3 yards behind them.
My People!!!!!!!
What an absolutely awesome video!!!! Been a follower of strongman for more than 20 years and the Stoltman brothers are just the nicest guys!!!
watching you guys make me feel like I was there literally ...anytime I fell like taking a trip to Scotland I will just watch this video
What an awesome video, I laughed lots, made my day. Thanks
their voices are deeper than a V8 engine
I genuinely love this video
the most underrated comeback arc
The best and beautiful BROTHERHOOD FUN I have ever seen.
Women are jus as strong as men you guys
him vs a leapord who do u think wins
Welp they inspired me to start going to the gym Tom is an inspiration in himself the both of them need to be seen more worldwide so wholesome
the weakest man they brought destroyed them in seconds. lol🤣
A truly touching journey, from autism to the world's strongest man. God bless you
Real life Steroid users
Boys will be boys🤣
So intimidating looking and then you realise there big softies 😂😂
They could use the skinny guy as a back scratcher
I wonder if they wear thongs with them kilts 😊
Soke viking genetics going on there
I would love to try this. I was training with Olympians and junior Olympics... 675 dead lift at 17.  But I didn't care about eastern ero stuff. This is what I wants.. I want an atlas stone and car walk with these guys...
Really shows not to judge a book by its cover. They are the world's strongest men and the nicest.
Mate, I absolutely love your videos  It's always something negative on tv your videos shows how kind people are no matter where you go around the world
Eric is surprisingly strong....!
This was a super fun watch.
The “Scottish” highlands not the “‘Scotland” highlands
Being the strongest men in the world they are so sweet and like huggable lol. Of course I mean that in a good way, just wholesome men :).
4:33 fuck you, fuck you for coming man
The deepness of the voices
I remember my first trip to Scotland, I’ve been living in the UK for almost 3 years, but I’ve never came across someone as sweet and humble as Scottish people. Hope to visit again soon! Such a wholesome video!!
Awesome video! Loved this. Thanks for being such an inspiration to all of us.
I have Asperger’s syndrome, this was very inspiring for me.. thanks
You spent a day with two guys that competed in the world strongman competition
i can do 10K calories a day STANDING ON MY HEAD... why am I not a strong man?
Boys will be boys
I was watching this video think about how Vikings were. They were pretty much the same as him but an army.
Vikings root
👍👍👍🤝
Just ordinary gym .... I like that . but the food though... wow .. thats an investment
Watching this makes me so happy to live in Scotland.
They need to add twister to the actual WSM
It was so funny to watch.... Looks like you had all a great and fun time
Hodor
That was soo much fun. Thanks guys.
I don't think these huge guys would of made great viking warriors as they would be slow on the battlefield...a much more agile fighter could of chopped him up and got out the way before these giants could even swing an axe...
I need to see Goggins with these dudes
Amazing I love watching these I love laughing your videos and your friends are the best thank you. It's the first time I laughed all day.
You look like different species
The "Scotland" Highlands? 🤣🤣  It's "Scottish." It's not difficult. Ask any Scot and they'll have told you the correct terminology.
Man what a lifetime experience, great guys this was awesome.
That was hilarious, fantastic video!
Tlustej znamená dobrej :D Honzo, přestaň koukat na tyhle videa a bez si radši zaběhat, bagoune :D
surely I need that STEP 1 to wakeup everyday
Such a high purpose, lifting shit. I'm in awe
They look like such gentle giants! I love this!😆❤️ 6:20
Ambiguously gay… not that there is anything wrong with that. Actually this was very entertaining. Lol
Best episode ever
tf is this guys Voice? :O
I want these guys to make a throat singing album Dude's necks have a freaking subwooffer built in.
not sure why i was smiling the whole time but i liked this and i dont know why...

Big guys with even bigger hearts. Cool people
My Mum 79 years old with COPD was loving this, she was laughing her head off at the challenges, and couldn't get her head round your breakfast, thank you
wonderful video, smiled the whole time
String bean if you're using it to exorcise no way a real man would use it powder puff!  Its not working
they fit the song "I need a big boy, give me a big boy..." lol
Wonderfull!! I really enjoyed the video!👍
Its the ruski blood
17:31  my thumbs are way bigger than yours😂

I love big strong giant gentle men 🥰🥰🥰 5:48 he's the cutest
Giant but gentle
They call 70kg cute isn’t it
This video brought me pure joy such kind human beings
They sound like very nice people more like them are needed
They have to be the nicest human beings ever. Gentle giants
80kg per hand He can carry two of the guys there
Seeing how pumped Luke and Tom got for the boys lifting the stones was amazing
This show was a BLAST! Great to see men like this be humble and so friction funny!!!!
Yes Theory and Stoltman brothers are amazing!!!! hope they can join you on another episode!!!
Never judge a book by its cover <3
So good. These lads are class. Scotland!!! <3
2:13 - it says "Glasgow" on the screen - but that's actually Oban, Argyll
Best one so far!!!!
EPIC! Great video and new fan of the StoltmanBrothers! Love the positivity and encouragement!
I really admire tall and strong people
Haven been laughing this much for a long time!
🔥💪🔥
Stoltman? That name has to date back to norse times. In norwegian it's straight out "proud man"
Amazing video
cant stop smiling. Those giants are so gentle,  I spent good time watching this. Thank you guys
This was really fun to watch. All the boys were having a wonderful time. Thank you for sharing.
REALLY GREAT VIDEO !!! THE BROTHERS WERE AMAZING  !!!
Great dudes
Amazing. Really surprising the big guys are at the end of the day just humans who want to have fun and enjoy like everyone else.  Must have been fun day for them 🔥
These guys got thighs as arms bruhhh
Such an amazing guys! Quite litterally - Gentle Giants, very positive, although dedicated and very commited to their life style! Much respect for the real Vikings of our days!
my thumbs are way bigger than yours hehehe
they sound like stoick the vast
World Nicest Brothers!!
as an trans autistic guy, i’m so inspired by these guys. i’ve always wanted to be strong, and this pushed me to sign up for my local gym. thank you.
The brothers are so cool they’re very entertaining, even more so than just their feats of strength
I love both of these giants
White people are amazin
Well that's two big Scottish men right there it's a good job they're friednly giants and not you know angry giants.
Have to admit, I am so glad these guys are the nicest people and the strongest at the same time lol
Can i be with you guys in one of your videos ❤yes theory?
I just love ERIC!
It was great watching you guys work out with the strongest men.
so they're the strongest men and they have the biggest hearts haha omg
I think they have NORSEMAN dna
Tom has the sweetest smile ❤
11:37 homie in the back was shocked he could even do that.
oh yeah Scary, if you are running a restaurant with a buffet or public restroom! ouch!  lol
HAHA the scene at the table shirtless is the best. Good job boyz
I am sending this to my son that is autistic. Thank you
Imagine The Mountain Join Them 😂
Haven't found a single video on this channel that didn't move me in some way
I love videos with strongmen! So far every stongman I have seen on youtube have be so wonderful!
Stoltman brothers r very sexy. Couldn't keep my eyes off them. Had me smiling and laughing all through the video.
Love to meet you guys one day
These guys a so god damn genuine! You can just tell by how they interact with the Yes Theory team. Great vid!
You need to spend the night as well
Motivated!
👏👏🇧🇷
the stoltman brothers are such teddy bears i love it
Way cool 😎 these dudes should start a show lol
I’d watch a reality that just fallowed these two strong men around doing literally anything 😊
My face the entire time 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😁😁
Not sure why it took me a year to watch this but I'm so glad I finally got around to it. These two guys are some of the most genuine souls I think I've seen. Just awesome!
Fun episode 😁👏👏
You guys are awesome. Positive video's like this I feel have contributed greatly to me beating the odds from stage 4 heart failure to full recovery.
whats the music at 14:14 ?
STOP THE EDITING WHEN THEYRE CALLING ERIC WEAK LMFAO
Eric is spicy..!!!!
This episode is sooo funny...I smile all the time while watching...
This was by far the best video you've made. I really enjoy your videos but to show how a man who was born with Autism can overcome a disability, become the strongest in the world and to want to be a hero to other people was just amazing. My son has Autism and this struck a cord. Thank You, I am a subscriber because of this video.
Are they single?...asking for a friend... joking but a little serious 😅 anyone...? No? Okay🙂  Edit: Just subscribed 💕
Bathing on a icy cold water is good for the body. Especially for athletes who wants to have a fast recovery.
This is beautiful. I laughed, cheered, and even teared up. I have a sister with Autism as well, and she loves drawing and watching anime...and so I draw and watch anime with her. Thank you for this video 🤍
More than anything, they are so cuddly😄
wtf eric how the hell
bros really look like odinsons
Those 2 dudes are extremely strong and also extremely nice guys
In case you didn't know, "Stoltman" is "Proud man" in Norwegian.
Wow… I’m autistic and and I have severe OCD which I may be going to an intensive outpatient therapy place in Denver for soon. And it is honestly so shocking and inspiring to me to see this autistic man overcome the odds and become so strong and successful even though he was like a twig like me. Haha. Great video guys.
This was so enjoyable to watch. The three guys were fantastic.
Gluttonous and self serving lifestyle.
Would like them to come to New York would love to meet theses friendly and sweet people my doors are open!
I love all of this…so much 🥰🥰🖤🖤🖤🖤
Can You imagine this two Big guys with another voice,a very tiny voice like a thinny guy.
Gigantes generosos,buenas persona.
yes bring the weakest guy he can think of anddd.... :))
Grown *ss man messing about like kids… most wholesome thing i’ve seen a while.   Kids these days are missing out on messing around like this.
V nice video 👏👏👏
This is genuine humor!  good stuff!
Amazing brothers, so genuine.
A gentlemen giant's very funny moments guys 💪😁
Michael Philips also eats 12,000 calories a day , but why he ain't big like them. Edit: this was so wholesome
Breakfast was so fun!  You looked so small!
Eric is so handsome!
sweet scootish men :) like sweet cats :)
Youtube know how to show very random video to me and still make me happy.
the voice...
I found myself smiling on the whole video…. Glad I watched
this channel just makes you feel so good and inspires me every video i watch, you guys are incredible!
At the 6 minute mark of this video I pissed  my pants laughing so hard
big respect from Saudi Arabia to you guys.
SO  SHWEEEETTT...much  love  Tee with  LIONS  NAMED LEO.[the music  worldwide}  AND  OOO WEEE  COOL.!!!
This was so entertaining and heartwarming at the same time
Where the heck could I find the 2 color long sleeve Seek Discomfort shirt?  I know I'm late to the party here but I just saw it.  I checked the web site and didn't find it there so I guess it's loo late?
♥♥♥
2 giants with a big big heart! ...
How do you declare them worlds strongest when they havnt even competed with strongest from 80% of the world. Wait till they compete with men from Asia, central Asia, India, Afghanistan.
Steroids is a hell of a drug. And yes, they are all on steroids.
so currently both the world's strongest man and world's richest man have autism. also having it myself, that's pretty fucking cool
Somehow these boys have a boys night as a career. I am so jealous
magni and modi?
What an incredibly wholesome video
headlamp
Two brothers who enjoy each others company, anything else is just topping on the cake stay strong guys!
Guys you'd wanna make freinds with.
So the Thor in god of war is accurate…these Vikings built different boy I tell ya
This isn't what I normally watch but you had me laughing out loud nearly the entire video. This is awesome!
I can easly say big guys generally very nice and polite
Fantastic video!
,
I love these guys so much and wish them the best
I need me one of them 😂
OMG!!! I'm in love whit them!!! 😍🤩🥰🤗❤️❤️❤️🇧🇷😘🇧🇷😘🇧🇷
This is quality content! very positive and fun.
As always it's the people who talk shit about others that end up being the real losers.
it's funny guys haha I like u
literally CHILLING WITH THE BIG BOYS, you want to Bambam🤩
Two of the coolest giants in the world. Massive respect for what they have achieved regardless of anything in the past. Well done lads...Keep on inspiring the future.
70 kilograms is cute
I love these guys, so nice and friendly and STRONG!
the most hilarious moment was the giant hide n seek.
I came to see hot Scottish strong men and I stayed for the wholesome interactions, well done!
That invitation would give me the rush of all rushes. Damn...
i really like those brothers great keep finding people likethat loved the human side with the disabilty great
Gotta love boys being boys 😂  such a fun episode
ngl sus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcuxjjUlhEI
So many reasons to call this one of the best videos on youtube.
Did he just have them snort cocaine
who can afford to eat like that??? JEBUS!
@2:13 It certainly says Glasgow, but the image is definitely beautiful Oban! So for any of you wondering where that nice looking part of Glasgow is, it's actually a wee town called Oban on the West Coast that you should most certainly visit!
Where did you meet Magni and Modi
Aren't they both on HGH? I feel like i can hear that. Thats not really something one should promote :(
GLASGOW - shows picture of Oban. 😆
Truly gentle giants: very nice to see!
I'm 181 cm, 112 kg, slightly pudgy but also kinda muscular, so like.. not tall, kinda heavy, most guys are smaller than me.. but when I saw that giant jump in the bed in the beginning of the video I legit wanted to feel what it's like to be hugged or spooned by a 2 meter 185 kg man..! xD   No homo I swear (although there's nothing wrong with that.)
I call this fat mostly....
I don't think it is just mythology. Giants lived all over the earth. Look at the archaeological evidence.
actually built like Ogryns holy shit lol
Any time folks ask why Thor is "fat" in GOW Ragnarok I'll make sure to point them to this video. This man is literally built like a half-giant Aesir
And that's how a Gym rat is born
This vid inspires
how did you guys manage to fly drone in Scotland ? there's no fly zone up there!!!!
So much respect for this guys...
as a young one with autism and is quite overweight, I’m seeing something rn lol
That's scary 🙀🙀🙀 cold 🥶❄️🥶.
Giants did exist.
Ok, the competition at the end had my peeing pants laughing :P Great vid!
so funny to see some skinny guy between 2 huge guys
New God Of War looks fire
Both of em are truly amazing !
Tempor aliquip deserunt officia enim est do voluptate ullamco.
They need to go on a diet and lose that beer belly
Basically spend a day with Magni and Modi 💀
I heard a bone snap during the arm wrestling
There is a saying that goes, short and weak people are evil. I think they were true.
Love every sec of this😁❤❤💯
No clue why this showed up but two thumbs up 👍🏻👍🏻 Amazing guys, great show
I love you guys :) You are spreading so much love <3 Fancy coming to Chichester and visiting The Barn Little London, where we honour local businesses and local food? xxx
i want to be a strong man 😂
i am 49. i did martial arts and lot of ski when i was younger now i  train fitness swimming yoga but still lots of old injuries coming up all the time. i am the slim and fit kind of guy but far away too even imagine this kind of strengthen even exist in human being. amazing.
The main thing is not to be around when the food runs out. Cheers
Dudeee those are gentle giants OMG I love their vibe
Sweet Giant lov it ❤❤
I smiled the whole time watching this. It was so wholesome and good hearted, watching everyone being so enthusiastic and supportive of each other. Also Luke speaking in that deep voice…I’m smitten 😍
This was so funny!
Why do you go to the gym "To be me and let all my expressions out?" Absolutely adorable sir. Great lad. The gym is somewhere you can go to just be you.
God, these guys look like three children next to these two men.  At that breakfast table, I half expected them to start feeding the three boys like they were toddlers in high chairs.
Lies i dint spent time with any of them
Legendary
I want Luke to narrate my life.
Tom kinda reminds me of GoW Thor especially when he is topless xD
Omg, i love how low their voice are
My dad and I went through Minnesota one time to see my older brother. We were in line at the gas station and my dad asked the man in front of us where we were in the state. The guy scoffed like,  “Auggh! INVERNESS , MINNESOTA!” Exactly like a guy from Braveheart. Thick accent and pissed we didn’t know. It’s awesome that these huge strongmen are so cool.
When did Thor from GOW venture into this realm?
Loved this!  Such sweet giants.  And Tommy (?) lifting the ball and the other thing...very impressive!  I entered the World Arm Wrestling Tournament in Las Vegas in 1989.  I literally had an inch to beat my opponent.  I shifted my weight...and had a compound fracture.  I am still very proud of myself for entering this competition.  I hadn't competed all that much before.  And was thin and shy.  I could have won easily if I hadn't exhausted my own muscles.   I am now 100% convinced it doesn't matter what the title of your videos are.  I still seriously cry every single time.  And laugh.  Keep up the awesome content!!!!!!!  I hope to meet you all someday.   Actually, I have an idea...I would love a way to bring a family member back together.  Long story.
what lovely gentle giants 💖
I would love to see you guys just plainly strolling here in asia. Bet you guys would feel like real giants. lol
This was the coolest , most inspiring thing i have ever seen. Please do more videos with the Stoltman brothers!
This was fun... Love those Big Scottish guys..
Just dudes being dudes. You love to see it.
THIS WAS A WHOLE COMEDY SHOW I WAS LAUGHING AND GIGGLING ALL THE TIME.😭😭😭😭
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ thank you
Thank you for the Laughs !!! 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕🤗🤗🤗
You guys have the best jobs in the world . The food ,the ppl , you meet such awesome people. Makes me wanna get outta my country even more .
They're more calm than anyone I know
Just a couple of cracking big Loons loving life and lifting heavy shit!  Brilliant!!!
I think you have no information about Levan Saginashvili and Konstantine Janashia. You should meet them.
"The weakest guy", Bahahaha!
This was amazing
They are like literal beasts because even when they speak i hear growling. But they're like the most softest people you'll meet. Thank you for the wholesome content Yes Theory & Stoltman Brothers
What an amazing opportunity to spend time with these mountains, they are incredibly strong fit men and the scottish accent is amazing , my Grandmother was a McClure and she was an amazing woman. If the brothers ever want to come to Australia it would be amazing to meet them..
What a great video! Loved it
Parabéns ao magrinho,ele e forte por natureza.
The boys were like hobbits next to those Scottish lads.
everything about this video makes me laugh XD thank you for making my day
i cannot stop laughing hahahahaha-
You can hear their testosterone
That can’t be good for your digestive system to make it run eating 6 times a day.
Man I want to hang out with those Giants and workout with them !!!!!!! They seem super chill and awesome guys to have a beer with.
Gachi culture is wonderful
Dude almost takes up the entire front seat of the car! Awesome!😆
Modi and magni
Inspiring
love this! so much fun and positivity!
When a 6 foot 3 inch, 350lb professional strongman asks, "How are you so strong?"... that must be a very nice ego boost! lol
17:26 is just my favorite moment. 🕊️
Im going to say it they are really cute
Ipsum id pariatur labore tempor culpa non incididunt anim mollit cupidatat laborum pariatur nulla.
Omfg this so freakin cuteeeeee😍😍
'Im 70 kilos' 💀 'That's cute innit'🤣😭😭
Now this is how you live life.  I could not get enough of this. People would live a lot longer and be in better health especially when they become elderly.  Amazing!!
Best content on the net EVER!
Beautiful guys. They are so massive they look like two proud dads, playing with their three toddlers 😆
Hey guys, come train with us in Sydney, Australia! We do mountain unicycling and unicycle hockey. We have a national league for hockey and have national and international competitions for all sorts of unicycling disciplines. We would love to teach you guys how to ride.
I hope he wins again this year ,still remember geoff capes ,no doubt iceland and norway will bring a few monsters
what crazy is volcanos are open wombs and magma/lava is ancient blood. body fluids crystalize such as tears, sweat, mucus etc., which is y volcanos create gems/diamonds/ crystals
There voice suits there huge body
I loved visiting the Scottish Highlands years ago. I felt at home.  I live in the Colorado Highlands and my ancestral lineage is Scottish and Nordic.  I had an uncle who was 6'5" and over 300lbs.  Here they're called rednecks.  I really enjoyed the video.  It felt like watching a family home movie.  Maybe it was?
That was  the best laugh of the day! The lads, especially Tom, show that it's mental strength that gets transformed into physical strength there.
So this strong man thing is where I can find a big manly husband for my almost 6ft tall girly self? Lol make me feel like a woman please. I can't stand these tiny city dudes. 😤  🥺
Okay, this was beautifully embarrassingly fun🤍❤🤍❤🤍
According to the video picture, it is poorly over exaggerated for being 'giants', strong but not giants... OH GOSH, I've seen people way taller and broader than these guys... But if you mean giant by strong, I think a re-contextual and grammatical check is in order for the title! 'Some of the strongest people in the world'? Or "Strongest brothers in the world?" That's better and your welcome! ;D
These scottish madlads are the definition of humble giants. Such large kind hearted men now they're my idols i want to grow up and be just like them big, strong and kind hearted
Have you seen them tree log rolling down a hill??
" Am 70 kg. that's cute"😂
This so cool and heart worming
🤦‍♀️ Come on now Giants there big but I wouldn’t consider them as being Giants
new to the channel & I LOVED EVERY BIT OF IT!!!!
it makes me so happy to see other autistic people like me doing such amazing things :]
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Omg they are adorable. I’m in love.
haha,  i did exactly this with some enormous people....   every single one of the cried like a baby when it was bicycle time.    F_ing babies
À
Awesome job my brothers, so much fun to watch and laugh. I love the spirit amongst you.
Just gonna skip over brain Shaw….
Gentle Giants
I laugh a lot!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Super!!
All these strong men are just giant teddy bears.
Awesome video !
loved it!!
As a weak dude with autism, I understand that drive to do better. You're an inspiring man Tom! I hope to one day feel as strong as you look.
I like any of these 2 strongest men to be my boyfriend…. ❤️. I will meet you in Scotland !
Those voices!💕
Haha that’s what I look like standing next to my bf
They look like the brothers from BFG
Just a bunch of half-naked men lawn wrestling and playing twister together. Are this the male thots?
Strong man are inspiring 🙏
BIG GIANT  BIG HEART
WOW!!!  I am in complete awe!!!  The Stoltman Brothers are not only record setters, but most definitely down to earth Great Men!!!  For them to be so outstanding, yet so very humble and fun loving guys - I'm completely blown away.  May God Bless them always!!!!!
This was SO much FUN!! 😄😂
Yeah definitely a cool video guys
Only 3mins in & I already love it! But of course I do, as a MacKenzie I'd be daft not to!!! Scotland, highland games, kilts & strong tradition most of my favorite things!!!!!!!👍🇺🇸🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
This is one of those videos where you just smile the entire time. So much fun!
-*Aaron Donald has left the chat*
I've always loved Tom & Luke Stoltman. Two of the hardest working guys in Strongman.
Lovely giants
It is amazing how some people would let autism to conquer them however, you have conquered autism
omfg... to sit between those two gentle giants... I would melt...
Had the pleasure of going to Scotland CT for their Highland Games. It was delightful. This makes me miss my big Celt. 🤦‍♀️
I laughed so hard watching this.. so funny. This was a great video.
this is really pathetic.
This is a call for all of us to exercise more.
The breakfast scene was hilarious, but the,  that's cute innit response to the I'm 70kilos comment had me on the floor...
Large strong people are the nicest and most thoughtful people. They know they are big and intimidating but don't want to be seen in a negative perspective.
I feel like I would hug them and just never let go.
This was fantastic! I smiled through the whole darn thing 😀All of it - every last one of you all. Loved it!
Is that the Campbell tartan?
This is the most wholesome thing I have ever seen!
Great video!  Great guys!!!
You dont get such deep voices from just muscle mass or calories. You get it from taking hormone drugs.
Big guys with big hearts
Oh my, when I see them in kilts I pray to you oh Lord.  Let the wind blow!
Wonderful family all goof vibes here
We humans, always like gentle giants
why are you talking about scandinavian mythologylogy while you're in Scotland with Scottish people
Eating 6 times per day -- when you eat such titanic breakfasts that include tons of dessert!??  😱 I shudder to think what the brothers' health will look like by age 60... or age 50, for that matter.
Holy shit, the vikings definitely did a little mixing with their ancestors in ancient times.
This was great! Thanx guys you all did a great job!👍👍👍
4:10🤣🤣🤣
GUYS ARE HUMANE D 9 BULLDOZERS.. WOW.. .. BUY THEM GUYS A BEER ANY TIME !!!!
can i just say, this guys are pretty attractive
Just watched these Viking giants - down to Earth , humble , friendly and not an ounce of jealousy or hatred ...wonderful brothers , wish them the very best in health wealth success and happiness and thanks to the team of 3 friends who also gave up their time and effort to bring this great true life tale of positive attributes !
LET'S GO nope  💀💀💀
Made me laugh, and made me cry. Seriously: thanks, lads! Awesome.
I have to say that is probably two of the best people on the planet to be friends with!
5:45 That look LOL
That little guy is strong
these 2 men are probably form goliaths lineage for sure
Twister with giant's...🤣😂
Awesome
They aren't  body-builder types with  6-pack abs and perfect symmetry of their muscles but rather they have  lots of "beef"  and are burly and even pot bellied like sumo wrestlers.
My son is 15 yo and has autism, has seizures and 6 feet. He’s recently fallen in love with volleyball. It has boosted his self confidence.These men are inspiring to see my son can have a future
6:24 LOL
Great video !!!! 🤩😍🥰
The younger one is ten years younger but five inches taller and eventually outdid the older one !!!!  🥳 The next best thing to being the strongest man is getting to be the proud older brother of the strongest man !!!!  🎉
❤❤❤❤❤
"GLASGOW" lmao bro thats literally oban (2:12)
Where can I get one of those ponchos??  Looks awsome!
The "Fish and a Ricecake" guy needs to watch this video to learn how eating for training should be done
Brilliant vlog from Yes....
These guys should come to Samoa. They'll fit right in
Maybe they should get in a little better shape n they would get more respect
SUPERMANS 😄👊💪
Never judge a book by it's cover. Strong men can also be smart men... And that little man lifted more then his ratio, eh? By weight ratio he might be a record holder. lol.  You wouldn't believe it unless you saw it.  =)  Very cool.
amazing human beings! loved this video from start to finish
yep-you guys had a BLAST!
@2:45 The log-lift was playing on ESPN as I said to my ex "the hard part is reciting Shakespeare as you get it up."  Which prompted Bruce Willis and his brother to laugh, and that made me glad, b/c  he'd told Demi when they walked into the empty-ish bar we shared at the Mirage (circa 1997). Poor Bruce had dropped $8000 at the craps table that day he said and between the World's Strongest Man & yours truly, I'd like to think I took the sting out of losing three times my monthly E-4 pay.
Cool video. Love the Stoltman brothers! Not sure why the creators of the video chose drone footage of Oban (small town on the west coast) for the city of Glasgow though 🤷‍♂️😂
I slipped a disc watching this
“What is that?”  “This is a lime?”  🫠
Oh boy this fun fact may cause digestive issues Rolaids recommended ----- the 2 strongest men in world wear skirts! 🤓
6:00 a life of empty calories. They would bench even more, on actual food. Fun though
The new god of war looks crazy
That shirtless breakfast scene reminded me of Prophet Rolex of Nigeria.... 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I wonder if he would give the brothers a run for their money and demolish the entire table....
🥰🥰🥰🥰💯
these guys are soo humble and cute love to these strong man
freaking click baint picture, if this was real their fingers would be 5-6 finches long, making their hands 1-2 feet apart giving them a height of  9 feet and a width of  5 feet with weight of 400-600 pounds. FAKE. wont watch. click bait
Tom is my superhero
Until your back snaps!
This viedo was sooo awesome to watch..
Why are a Russian and a swede complaining of the cold water?! That was kinda ironic but at the same time cute
Their brotherly love is 10x stronger than their strength combined.
as a man who is tougher than these blokes, i just want to say i enjoyed the video...
You guys are all awesome
Fun show . I love the Strongman Competitions. At 12 years old I saw Paul Anderson (World’s Strongest Man” lift 12 Football Linemen who were sitting on a table he squatted under. I wish they had had these competitions then as he was the Father of using  everything from engine blocks to irrigation wheels ,he would have been unbeaten. These two guys are awesome I love how they enjoy doing it
a giants with a smile in the face.. thanks for inspiring us.
With their size and body , one of them could be Thor from god of war in a real life movie
Giant hide and seek 😂
why are you glamorizing these taf people they just eat alot
Two heart attacks waiting to happen.
The best you tube video I've watched in a long time!
This might be the best YT video I have ever seen.
The strongest yet the most humble humans I ever saw .. I like them
Duuuddde!!!! The video could have ended after you guys got lifted. The video just kept getting better, we got to hear there story and same right they'll be hero's but not just to kids. The cheesy comedy. I loved it.
Big guys that are so gentle and Scottish. My goodness. That's a perfect man in my book
Gentle giants 💖
Goddamn that voice pitch
such a fantastic video laughed and smiled the whole time. I wanna hang with these giants too lmao
With the way they eat they officially left human status and became bears 🐻 🐻‍❄.
I fucking love the energy on this video
Love the fun :)
Never upset a strong man who is also a giant.
fun fact - if thor from norse mythology existed, he’d look a lot more like these 2 people, than chris hemsworth did in avengers infinity war!
Foin is an understatement  That is all
The energy is this video is like nothing else.  You can’t help but feel happy and laugh along with these guys.   Keep spreading joy !
These are definitely two giant human beings. So kind, so friendly, so driven. My Heroes!!
Big brother sounds like Ned Stark from GOT.
These guys must be amazing cuddlers.
weight pitt baby  where a man can be a man away from the deadlift haters. Kens and Karen's smh.i swear this era or gen  has fucked everything up best wightpitt ..  prison   with out a doubt
This made me smile from ear to ear!
Cracking vid. 😁😁
I too have autism i hope i can overcome my obstacles as well
Great video of my fellow kinsmen but way to many adverts guys 🤦🏼‍♂️
It seemed like all of you really had fun while filming this.
6:00 - It looks like they are there to eat you guys
I would rather clothe than feed them. It would be cheaper.
Pfffft...easssyyyy. I am a 5 ft Asian woman, 64 kg atm. And can do what the Stoltman brothers do, like eat 10 000 calories in a day...the rest never mind...lol
This has to be one of my favorite videos. Of all time ! Great job guys 👏👏👏👏
Great guys to hang with. They're super chill but could rip your head off your neck without much effort. Two solid Scottsmen.
I had the absolute BEST TIME experiencing this adventure with the amazing Stoltman brothers...Two beautiful souls!! Thank you for telling their amazing story! Much love guys! ❤❤❤
Such a wholesome video, laughing throughout the end. The big guys are sweet and wholesome. It was fun to watch.
gentle giants.

This video has amazing vibes! The Stoltman bros. Seem like good people too!
One of the funniest episodes ever!!!!
That looked like such a good time hanging out. Much love
Wow! Eric is impressive
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Imagine a squad of these guys meeting the roman platoon.
you guys are amazing! the defenition of gentle giants <3 best wishes!
I was just in the midst of a horrible panic attack and tried to divert my attention else where. I found this video and it took me right out of the dark hole I almost fell into. So grateful! Can’t thank you enough!!
Sorry guys 2.12 minutes, this is not Glasgow this is Oban, no where near Glasgow.
Ok how much HGH do they take?
I travel all around the world and do nothing but film it. Oh but the strong men's lives are super easy.... I like your content but you are privileged as fuck!
Ah but muh injuries! I've been injured literally hundreds of times but I've never taken a day of. You keep going. No matter what! And that's just my job so I can survive day to day.
Be careful guys you're more fragile.. you got to work up to it.. that would be so fun to do that kind of stuff glad for you.
That would be so cool guys I'm glad you're having fun with life.. and go Brothers you've worked hard you deserve.
This was amazing
This is so incredible that the world's strongest man is autistic. I'm going to have to show this video to my autistic son.
Deep voices to match!
Those guys are frikken hyuuuuudge!
This was really intriguing to watch...hoooly shit <3
I love how the "weakest" of the three is the only one lifting this stuff
Twister with giants... "Why you gay"?
Nah its still Eddie hall
Hahaha!  this is so funny :D
That's incredible!
Yes Theory - you guys inspire me to do more, be more courageous and believe I can do more than I already do!!!
eggzercise :) cute!   That's very cool that you can do the virtual walk.   Can't believe they eat 10 000 calories!!!
😆 i love the hide and seek...
Giant fauna, giant mushrooms, giant fruit, giant evergreen trees that reached into the clouds, and humanoid giants up to a km in height. existed on Earth before the Moon was positioned in its; @22,000 km. from Earth.  The ever green trees reaching beyond 12 km into the air.  The small mezas in the deserts of New Mexico, neighbouring states are actual tree stumps; one of these unique formations 8km in diameter over  1km in diameter across; others are larger and somewhat smaller.  At one site; you can see where the tree was fallen and the branchs were cut off; now fossilized in the clay mud of ancient world wide floods.  Why the stumps stick out so much; ancient machines removed the surface soils, sub soils, and surface rock; which ended up covering the crystaline metal outer skin of the Moon; which got damaged before the Moon was locked into its orbit.  The rocks the Apollo Missions brought back to Earth; have the same DNA.  The Moon was built to be an Ark; with 120 plus floors, damaged giant machines sit within the Moon.  There is a reinforced surface structure; with anchor, cables, and a huge derlict Space Tug parked near bye. hall ways and doors are 85 feet high, with doors the same height, on e of the near empty  rooms has a huge chair that only a giant could sit in.  Their is a central quantum computer; with many cities of the 22 Genetic Farmer Races live in; these cities are well defined kept separate.  These people are very territorial.  We have a hidden History of Earth; slowly the skelitons of Giant are being dug up.  One skull is larger than the backhoe machine parked beside it for comparison.  many of these giants have six figures, six toes, and double row of teeth.  Any where from 8' to 14' have been found in North America, the nephilim, the Annunaki were closer to 14' or higher.  In Sberia 14' human skelitons have been found; with five fingers and toes.  children have been born with six fingers, six toes, and growing to 7' or more. The basketball players are an example of human physiology that are not the result of giagantism; with deformed skulls associated with gigantism.  the people found in Antarctica at these ancient cities under the Ice Sheet, trapped in the forozen ice are 14 feet tall, slender, with slightly potruding stomachs, elongated skulls dressed like the priest class, the ellite class of Ancient Egypt.  These people were the founders of Atlantis, a civiliaztion that expanded the planet.  This would be the high tech. center, with three mother ships near bye the megalithic city made of stone.  There is also an Acient Builder Race City; with pyramids and grand buildings. Earth must have experienced a Pole Reversal, with catastophic Sunamies, with the oceans slushing back an forth, generated by an immense Solar Flash; which created a hole in the Atmosphere, exposed Antarctica to cold temperatures to Space too freeze the Giant Sunamie Wave in place; creating a very thick Continental Ice Sheet 3 miles high.  Their are dinasaures, tropic animals, plam trees, lush subtropical vegatation suspended in the sunomie wave when it became forzen in place ice; this continent had experience crustal diplacement; which pushed the continent to the South Pole where it resides now.  This would have been one of the Great Floods. With higher levels of Solar Radiation and background radiation since the early 1950's; gravitation waves, radio waves, and other light waves across the light spectrum carrying light codes with gene coding to activate the Sun and Solar System pushing into the 4th Density from the 3rd Dendity; that also activates our own ascension, expanding our consciouness carrying us into our Golden Age, the Age of Acquious, activating dorment genes giving teenagers with much bigger and longer feet, longer necks, with longer limbs, taller bodies, much larger bodies especially Indigenous Peoples from Africa and Nordic Countries.  65% of proffesional athletes come from Indigenous Peoples from African Continent.  Only winter sports, peoples from the British Ises, Nordic Countries dominate Winter Sports.  With the popularite of Winter Sports in Canada; hockey, lacrose, curling they are moving beyond into other Ethnic Populations.  Winter is so long in Canada; you have get out their an participate in winter sports.  beyond the physical traites is ascension which is more important; the slave dummy down technologies placed by the negative Draco, the negative Annunaki, and negative Tall Greys who have been feeding of us; the lush we create from negative experiences, poor living conditions, poor salaries that do not raise a family, closing down factories and wiping out high paying blue collar jobs thta support families; while Ceo's are paid more in one day that what lower management staff are paid in a year which is deplorable.  The psychologists have added another trait for CEO, Presidents, Vice Presidents, CFO, Directors, etc is being Psychopaths, Sociopaths, firing staff thousnads of staff, forcing them to work extra hous for no more pay, and stealing them away from supportive, nurturing Family Life.  They have ignored holistic management, social responsibilities, communtiy support, gutting manufacturing not connected to Space, flight, and Military Spending.  We have scene the gutting of programs that uplift society spiritualy, physically, and driving safety; with thousnads of unsafe bridges, deteriorating castiron pipes bringing natural gas into 19th and early 20th Century Buildings; which leak natural gas into the building spaces; especially basements and up. Ignition is triggered and the building blows up into a fireball blowing the building completely apart; ticking time bombs waiting to go off as the Deep State waist money and time ignoring infrastructure up keep, the Military and the MIC grossly consuming tax revenue; which the Deep State hasn't stolen through the Central Banks and stolen Foreign Aid; which the Ukraine is a prime example.  The top 1% pay little in Taxes and they ware out infrastructure with their lage truck fleets. Transportation is very inefficent and the trains are under utilized.  The rest of the 99% pay for the top 1%.  Population collapse is real, not enough children being born to prevent population collapse; how does the 1% come up with over population and human led climate change which is not being supported by peer review science models; both are fake concerns just like the News Media's fake reporting.  The best thing people can do for their health is stop paying for Cable TV; actualy shot the idieot box off that would end the brain washing, read a book and lower their stress, put away the Cell Phones which is another weapon besides the TV, and which they pay for.  Communication skills, math skills, reading skills are deteiorating across the US.  Public Education has become Third World and is attacking the family, sexualizing children, confusing children at the same time they are being assaulted by the criculum and Drag Queens in kindergarden classs and elementary school are sexualising children making them an easier target for the predation by pedophiles and pedophile rings shown in "Pizzagate"  The life span of children will be lower than their parents and grandparents.  Classes that improve creativity, improve expression, our needed to improve social, communication, and life skills of children.  Teaching Life skills is most important and our baddly needed for students to be successful in school and after school.
I would kill to do this, what an awesome video!
a family of 3 doesn’t eat 10000 calories a day.
I'm so loving this two big brothers. Hoping to see them in the next upcoming videos. Lots of love from India..
Imagine the hernias.
Mate what shall I do is awesome you'll get to see the world it's so beautiful man you've always wanted to see them in the world and you know the trouble you know the tropical islands and you know island is beautiful You know help so many people and you put you know people's stories you know people stories that normally wouldn't be hurt out there for people to hear I'll definitely appeal to him which is also awesome I'll recommend this show to everybody it is awesome maybe one day I'll get to travel 1 day and wish I was somewhere and it'd be pretty cool but I'm poor right now trying to start up show you dollar business with nothing I'm not supposed to work anymore it's my heart only works 45% and I don't get the medicine I'm supposed to be taking cause I don't have the money for it but I'm learning how to do coding and just got my blocked chain certification from trying to create a crypto currency that uses cling energy We'll people come on it and everything you've got my text ID number and pull it down don't have is my LLC I'm just sitting in the hospital I'm almost done and thinking I'm mean not leaving anything from my kids behind and they have nothing no I'm trying to change that Keep up the good work guys you're awesome
That shot of "Glasgow" is Oban you confused tools.
Giant dudes voice is like he IS the witness protection program...
Having breakfast and watching you guys awesome i had lots of happy good laughs. A good way to start my day. The 2 strong guys are beyond my imaginations. I was thinking how you would pick me up with just one hand with my 55 kg.
Fun to watch fellow classmates at play!
Elon Musk is autistic. My granddaughter is also. Difficult socially, but brilliant.
Just a couple’uh guys bein dudes
Hearing them say they eat 10k calories a day made my stomach hurt
They sound exactly like I thought they would
“I’m 70 kilos.” “That’s cute, innit.” 😂😂😂
I'm still smiling! My Grandmothers name was O'Cain, and my Great Grandmothers name was McFarland...
That looks like Captain America Trying to lift Thor's hammer
They were denied weapons at one point in histdy and developed this rigorous competition
Good vibes
Wish I could've done that w them, I coulda done all of that😭
I love this 2 giants..they are so adorable...
What an awesome vid! Those giants where amazing.
These are not any giants! Those are pigs using roids and have nothing in their heads! Those unhealthy looks and expressions on their faces tell me that they will be dead in a few years. What difference does it make if I lift less than they do? The Reall power is your knowledge, not your very temporary strength which is enhanced by junk food and drugs. Absolutely human garbage. They look ugly and they are stupid. Their facial expressions show me that they are primates.
FYI - when the word Glasgow comes up it's Oban in the backdrop. And the Stoltman's stay in Invergorden not Inverness. #justsaying
These guys are so awsome
Pretty awesome people  !!
Autism is Not a disability imo.  Different doesn't mean deficient.  I have never met a cruel hateful person who is Autistic. And that is an evolution our world needs.
That has to be the best video I have ever watched on YouTube!  Amazing all the way around.  Those two seems like such amazing down to earth fun people.   Thanks for doing this (and maybe a new one with them in the future)??????
Not 1 dislike!! You gentlemen are doing the internet correctly!!!
Some of the strongest people in the world have the softest, sweetest hearts
Yes!!!!!!!
Genuine love is beautiful. I saw it in this video
best part of the video is at 6:00
Are you sure you’re in Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 because I understand everything they said.
These 2 I absolutely love, especially Tom. They are 2 of the nicest, most humble guys I have ever seen. They deserve all the success in the world!
what an awesome and entertaining video, thanks guys.
😯👍
When I think of giants, I think of them as their huge height in addition to their bulky size, fictional or not! I’m 6’1” and if these bulky-muscled people were my height, I would not count them as giants
Propper lovely lads !!! Wicked 👊🏼🏆
they sound so Scottish it's amazing. I love it
When he was able to successfully pick that 100kg atlas stone up and place it on tbe plymph, that was one of the hypest things I have ever seen! 😄💪🏻💥
Everyone was so happy for him when he lifted the stone. That was a sweet gym broment.
Started body building before, all the shitting got a bit much for me in the end though haha
'we brought the weakest one" boys got some leg strenth on him for sure haha
The wholesomeness levels. They remind me of three heroes (три богатыря) so much.
13:40 If it had landed on his leg, it would have crushed his knee. dudeee... He was lucky
I love how big boys are so easy going and really trying to workout with you guys even if you guys are not close to their level. You can tell that those two strongest guy in the world are good people 😊👏
Surprised yes theory didn’t seriously injure themselves lol
This had me smiling and laughing the whole video! I love those strongman brothers ❤
What a pair of really lovely guys, Nice to know they also big Rangers men.
this is the best thing i've watched all year bar none.
The most likeable video on YT. Loved it, the gentle & humble giants.
5:53 the way they all sit down for humongous breakfast in one seating, shoulder to shoulder, BARECHESTED is somewhat so comedic lol
That was awesome & the kids loved watching the 3 skinny blokes being lifted lol
WOW VIDEO AND AND BROTHERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I gained 10 p[ounds watching them eat breakfast and I am over 230 pounds.
Most people use gym equipment to lift weights...these guys lift the gym equipment with the people on it 😳 amazing...I need to move to Scotland 😏
I loved when the bigger one tried to lift all three of them and failed and then the smaller brother lifted them the bigger one immediately was like nah and lifted them and walked a few steps to be better.
What an AWESOME VIDEO
Strong in body. Strong in heart.
5:45 their freaking goku
This was an amazing video and big ups to the Stoltman Brothers y'all are amazing
So happy to have the privilege of seeing this!
Most entertaining!  Thanks guys
this was awesome.
These guys need “Space”😂
You love to believe bullshits about UK
Great fun guys!
Would love to be in the company of those giant men ☺️☺️☺️😊😊🤪💯😆😆
Scotland has a reputation as a cold place, but I see there are palm trees there. Must be the Gulf Stream warming it up.
Wow, you two guys seem so cool! I love that your brothers and so down to earth and nice. I lost my twin brother just before Christmas 2021 and I am still struggling to deal with that. Seeing you guys together having fun with all the rest of these guys was very cool and I know my brother would have enjoyed it too. Be well, and stay safe! Great Video and I will cheer for you guys at every strong man I see. 😎👍🏼
The Stoltman Brother are so nice its just Wholesome
eric is my fav
I wanna eat with these guys .lol
Is the red Seek Discomfort hoodie going to be sold anytime soon? o.O
that guys cholesterol 🔝
I like them💜💜💜I subscribed to their channel @Stoltman Brothers
This is just amazing!
this is Gold I'm laughing so much, such a wholesome vid!
they sound like vikings lol
Thomas: "I'm 70 kilos" Tom: "That's cute"  Hilarious moment 😂
It's just their voice makes me feel they're real giants and also love it
👍
So Thomas you lifting it yet
11:35 *No one expected Eric to lift that 😂*
This was an absolute joy to watch, from beginning to end. Subbed.
niceness guys, thanks for the laughs, welcome in Rwanda bro's
Commendable dedication best regards and wishes
I laughed so hard during this vid. Thanks guys 😂
Just dudes being bros.
💙💙❤️❤️❤️😅🏋️💪 gentle Giants ☺️
This is just so wholesome and beautiful
I really admire them both. Tom is probably most UNautism person I ve ever seen. Just watch how he enters the self introduction and how he described everything. Sport creates character for real. Brings only good stuff in persons life.They both are real men.
They eat MALTESERS for breakfast!?!
this is healthy masculinity. we missed it so much, thank you 🤝
1:08 Bill kazmeir
My favrioute strongmen and my favrioute youtuber!
Toms face when luke said hes 400+ lbs haha Also how tall is Thomas? cus damn tom is 6ft 8
Imagine them swinging a battle axe, you'd be thrown into the air with so much force
This video is so wholesome
Do come Visit to India in The North east India ..... Meghalaya Shillong in a Remote Village Where People are Names With Melody or Rhyming or even by Whistling ❤️
Amazing story!
Those guys are not Giants, they're just big muscular men. Giants are men even bigger than Goliath and usually cross bred from fallen angelic beings. The Gods of Olympus and the Norse Gods were the actual clean up destroyers of the giants that remained after the Great Deluge of Noah.
Great episode of theory
https://youtu.be/pUmT-Cg3sYs
That was so fun to watch!
Honestly them having so much fun throughout the video reminds me of me and my group of friends. Guys would know what i mean, just hanging out where ever doing dumb stuff like trying to lift heavy things or throwing rocks into the water. Oh and i can't forget the "If you do it I'll do it" mood that's in the video xD
I hope you do another video with these guys !!
Hey man don’t forget to pray and remember jesus loves you he died on the cross for you repent  if you don’t know how to search it up like this how can I repent how can I be save by God. Make sure to have faith in him and trust him and have a relationship with him
This is great!  But, that isn't a picture of Glasgow!  That is Oban!  Oban is a small town 90 miles from Glasgow!  Why did you show that?  It isn't Inverness either, Inverness is a big town. It's very misleading tbh.  Great film, otherwise.
The training was great. The weakest man, huh? Haha, karma. Loved it.
This was a huge smile 😊
Omg I can't believe I missed watching this episode! I was smiling the whole time! I love the big boys! And how is Eric sooo strong????!!!! Amazing!!!!! I love this
Thought his voice was fake hella deep
2:22 love how you wound back but his arm still didn't move at all
world’s strongest men and world’s closest resemblance to living subwoofers, their voices are DEEP
Love it!
Mariusz pudzianowski is the strongest Man you fool
i half a bottle all to in a studied wtf i practice half a bottle of booze to 2 day
and gargamels not lazey cat
@17:57 HOLY MOLY he did put his hand right up the smaller guy
Love the Stoltman Brothers..you guys are the real gentle giants♥️..Love from the 🇵🇭😊
Wow a morning swim and hugs, really beautiful.  A full time job.  Exceptional. Yea tough little man Eric,  You pulled it off, yea! Lol that was fun
I love how you guys put a little ploop when he jumped in the water🤣🤣
These are Super Beta males...
I freaking loved this episode
Even their voice is the voice of a giant..
it's odd they used the crime victim voice changer on the guys, are they under a witness protection program?
Unbelievable! the strongest men brothers are so chilled and friendly, not the slightest hint of arrogance to be seen. ❤❤❤
Love those guys! Hearts of gold they have. Mind boggling the power they have.
Does the voice come with the training also? I feel like the bulkier they get, the deeper the voices get 😆
Sooo funny. I have a friend I worked with and I was always the one sitting next to him if we could fit in the booth. Littlerally I'm 5'10 180 and I felt like a kiddo sitting next to him.
Stolman brothers  respect. Wonderful amazing Gents.
I don’t think I stopped smiling throughout this video. Such wholesome, down to earth people, you could tell everyone was having a great time.
this guys is a real beast...
What an Amazing Fun video ❤
They were called the Nephalim. Their history is in the Bible.
An nursing home resident said to always enjoy ur strength while u can because it doesn't last forever
Yahki Awakened is a vegetarian, he said; gorillas are strong but they don't eat meat. That young giant has a puffy tummy, looks like food allergy. Love this video!!
False advertisement falls thumbnail why not just show the normal and the real thing why you got to exaggerate because of that you're getting blocked because of that nobody wants to watch your videos because you do false advertisement false videos false thumbnails where's the Giants they're normal people just like you and me where are the Giants tell me I don't your thumbnail really is this fake news
Absolutely amazing video.
I love this video
strongman seems to be really fun... but it is also very expensive just on the nutritional maintenance alone...
Happy to be here in your channel
I feel like I'm listening to leprechauns speak!
Do you think they'll go along with the W E Forum's plan  that all h u m ans will eat bugs? Maybe they will be an exception since they are giants especially if they are of a special bloodline.
I’ve enjoyed watching a few of your videos.  Very interesting and entertaining.  However, just a couple of things.  It’s not the ‘Scotland Highlands’, it’s the ‘Scottish Highlands’.  Your drone shot of ‘Glasgow’, at the beginning, was 98 miles away in ‘Oban’.   Amazing feats of strength from the Stoltman brothers (my son also has Autism).  That was fun to watch.
Argue with me all you want but this is peak autism right here, This is what the power of autism can hold to those who use it well. God bless that man.
I LOVED THIS VIDEO !!!
Subbed to stoltman bros!!
Lol, this is by far my favorite episode. Seeing the YES theory team try these work outs and even succeed at a few was so cool to see, idk why. I generally was excited when they got the rock on the top of the thing, so cool to see.
so much dbols
La mama de las hadid viéndolos comer 👁👄👁
thoes guys are 100% testosterone
This is like a fun hangout with the bros holy fuck. I miss hanging out with my bros.
Yo Eric is my favorite, he funny
Autistic lifters are of top quality
FYI The town in the background behind the big "GLASGOW" letters at 2:12 is the town of Oban. Nowhere near Glasgow. But a lovely city none the less. Look up McCaig’s Tower for a bit of history on the Colosseum looking structure on the hill. Oban distillery is visible also. Lovely town.
I've been watching a lot of your videos. Truly moved by you're adventures. I noticed Ammar had said to hit him up in the video in Guatemala, about being a tour guide for the pyramids. Or anywhere for that matter. I know I probably won't be looked at but if I could have just a few words, my life would be changed forever. Thank you guys, we love you.
https://youtu.be/uPgEClCM3jw
You guys have got to invite the two giants on one of your adventures! I’ve got a real feeling that it will be an amazing experience for all of you and all of us! And,,, I think it might be a huge heartwarming episode! Love your channel guys! Thank you!
Thomas 😂😂😂 Look so tiny between the giant brothers 😆😆😆  Oohh i love this video
Hes look like a stick betwen ball when they have breakfast 🤣
I’m not familiar with this channel much (clicked because of the Stoltmans) but the guy who lifted that 100kg stone as well as the yoke is way stronger than he looks and says about his strength.
https://youtu.be/VNZdW-bPLcQ
9:53 "I'm 70 kilos" "That's cute, innit" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love how you wake up and immediately bear cuddles, hell of a way to wake up indeed.
This video is so wholesome <3
This is awesome. Great video.
They're so friendly
Eric proving the haters wrong 👏😂
this is the definition of THE BOYS
I've never been so happy to see a bunch of men grunting into another man's belly
The tattoo on his body called Kushi  That means happiness in hindi
This is the best kind of "boys being boys". Loved the vid!!
Hahhaha the gentle giant is so cuteeee OMG..
Not only are you the world's strongest men but you guys have such nice personalities, this was really fun to watch! Keep up the good work and keep inspiring others! Wish you guys all the best!
they both seem like such nice guys, i wish the best for them in the rest of their journey
truly gentle giants <3
♥️
https://youtu.be/nt-GO5501Uc The most important thing for your kids
It  seems that who's made this video has never heard anything about the basque harrijasotzaileak (stone lifters), aizkolariak (woodcutters) and many other traditional basque sports
This was one of my favorite episodes. The Stoltman brothers are lovable human beings and all together you guys were completely hilarious. I am envious of the fun you guys have.
They all die at like 35 dont they from overeating, too much stress from the excessive lifting, inability to stay what I call fit, which is not what the majority if not all of these guys are is unfit.  They think fitness is how big you are, who you can beat up or how much you can lift, that may be a little stereotypical by most people of huge size tend to be bullies, big heads and think they are owed something, I know someone just like that, hes 22 thinks he knows everything, thinks he is so wise, but all he is, is a bell end who knows F all about life, but because he competes and hes large, he thinks hes Gods gift to man, lol, bell end and unfortunately it seems most of this size are bell ends in general, think they are owed something and have a superiority disorder.    Na, if you look at how many of these people die early and the compare with a properly fit individual who is not out to intimidate someone or look hard or lift 5 car wheels above your head or something.  You people in these videos may think you are fit, but your not, your putting huge strain on your heart, hence why most of them end up dead in their mid 30's and early 40's.
I can only imagine the grocery bill.....
Hats off to you guys, truly real-life mythical heroes. When you guys picked up the entire frame with the other 3 guys on it, I was in utter disbelief. You guys are strong AF saga worthy strength.
The Stoltmans are Gems of human beings. I was going through a very hard time in my life and they took the time to answer me and give me a message of encouragement in their comments. Stay spicy 🌶️
This was one of the best things I’ve watched in a long time. Thank you 😂
most positive example of boys being boys
Love how Eric actually could e things
Liked,Subed,Belled,Commented.
I am very confident that I can correctly assume the gender of these hulks.
I love how the worlds strongest men have the most generic names
Giant Savages , Badass by Environment ,  Genetic Large Bone and Muscle.  Only Gravity and the Gods can Challenge Them .  YouTube affirms this .
My Son has autism & to see this is inspiring. He just turned 5, but has no ability to communicate
dam eric u made history n now ur the strongman!!
i wanted to do videos like u guys n other ppl do except i never had any ideas for videos n im disabled with epilepsy n couldn't drive anywhere so getting a gopro cam is impossible for me!!
These unusually large men are going to get cancer with that diet
There’s no way this is healthy dude lol 10,000 calories? Look at their stomachs… like what dude
they are so wholesome! love it!
Big babies voices sound so cute
Just found this channel and I love it.
I really feel left aside hearing and seeing several testimonies from people on profits they make from Bitcoin/Forex Investment. Can someone recommend a good expert that trade on my behalf and generate profit for me..
Brilliant. Smile on my face the whole time, thank you all!
These guys are awesome. Great video.
He seems to like to be called autist or that he has or had autism, makes him feel special. I bet that his condition was due to bullying, bad friends, bad environment for a child. Anyway, even with autism, if he could heal then anyone could so why are still discussing autism like we do in society?
Ask them about the hormones they take and how that affects their health. Seriously, now! It is not normal to eat like that. That is called obsessing with your body to the point of destrioing it.
#75 off for a $3,500 training thing that you don't actually need. Go outside, it's cheaper and healthier!
You know how to talk on sense and basically fool young people to buy the stuff that you advertise. Is this a good way of doing business?!
How stupid is that really? The whole idea is not normal, to promote the idea that you have to live like them. Sorry but this channel seems to be full of info that does not help anyone and it's confusing.
The difference between strength and show muscle.
theyre so cute lmao
This is going to sound really weird but if I ever get to meet these brothers, I want them to throw/push me, kindof like how Hulk (suddenly) punched Thor in the first Avengers.
The nicest giants Ive seen!!!
alright 5:55 is like one of the best shots I've ever seen on ytb
Lost all credibility you mention Thor and Eddie hall don't get me wrong I love Eddie hall. But if your talking strongman it's Brian Shaw, sevickas, kazmir and magnesson. I'm missing quite afew but those are iconic strongmen not Thor 😂
9:11 this moment here makes you realise why these guys are able to make such a connection in a short span of time.
Loved how the gym helped them go through their hardships, lets just keep working kings
U gotta love these guys
it went from cool to cringe pretty quick 😅
https://youtu.be/h-qzfHHlzLE
awesomeness 🌻🌻🌻🌻
and they f**k u???
Thumbnail shows the middle man standing 10 steps back to show the image that IRISH men are HUGE  .  .  What a DAMN lie of a photo  .  .  . . .. thats clickbait and showbiz for you   .   .   .
The camera is shaking so much...i literally have a headache right now. :-(
The cameraman begging to get a single bite in the background while watching them eat a full course meal
This whole episode, made me grin
Wow wow 😯
The bloop at 4:12 hahahahhahahah nooooo
bro wtf 4000 dolars fuck tht
Tom Stoltman is my new hero. autism is a bitch, it helpful to see one of us doing so well at life.
this is so wholesome i wanna die
What a great video!
That’s Oban at 2:13 not Glasgow!  They’re 100 miles apart.
World strongest man is Mariusz Pudzianowski !!!!!!!
Hide and seek made me laugh so hard.  This is a very cool video guys.  I really like your style.
Mmmm....Minute 2:13, that isn't Glasgow. It's Oban.
They sounds like anonymous hacker in the movie lol
these guys make me want o go out and get a viking tattoo lmao
Girlfriend* “he’s probably out cheating”  Boyfriend* “ yo you wanna play twister shirtless with the worlds strongest man”?
superb....!
My cat watches this, he is now a lion
they hold the title only because the mountain didn't compete
this was great
That was the gayest intro ever
“You guys know how it is.” - Game Recognising Game
Great story and good job! I've always said that we are All neighbors, some of us just live farther away than others. Now...I get to add...and some of us are just Giants. So funny. I love you strong Irish brothers and I love our neighbors that bring us your story. Every second worth watching. Well done indeed. Thank you.
Mad respect to these wonderful lovely gentle giants with the most dreamy voices....🥰🥰🥰😍
Why the fuck does this make me so happy to see that kid put the stone up !   LETS GO !!!!!
I have to say I love his voice
I like how the strongest man body type isn’t shredded six pack but instead a dad bod lol
Did I just see a picture of Thomas as a black belt? No f'n way
Wow! Great stuff!
I bet when they help their  grandma move her couch ,they take it out one handed like a box of pizza lmao.
mark henry laughing in the corner
Wowww you guys just found kind giant friends 😮❤
Its good to see men being men. We need more of this.
I love that land up north and it’s people. You rock, Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
this was the most wholesome well put together youtube video i've seen in a long long time.
Great story
And to think that the real life Hercules dwarfed this guys...
their voices fit their gigantic bodies so well lol
Soon they and any blond with blue eyes will be bred out of existence.
That’s gotta be one of the funniest videos I’ve seen in ages …. Great that you can laugh at yourselves & each other. Totally killed it lifting that stone! 👍
This was such a great video, I loved it. Super funny too. These guys are amazing
They are really gentle giants 😀
These two brothers are such good dudes.
The only boys will be boys I’ll accept 😂
Awesome and inspirational.  Thanks.
of course the smallest guy was the strongest
Here’s a fact ,, all the giant bones are in the Smithsonian institution’s
this guys are amazing!!! youtube needs more videos like this one!
Looks like a hobbit 😅
Gentle Giants. Love these guys. Best wishes to them:)
He won a foot race. YAH🤣
The real truth of giants has been hidden by science ,the genetics are still around,the old testament gives clues
Love the IRISH pipe music dubbed onto the video about your trip to visit SCOTTISH strongmen. Nice touch.
Late comment but holy shit, the Stoltman brothers seem like some of the nicest, most welcoming, and big mf'ers that exist. For as big as they are, they seem like they could make anyone comfortable around them
this is who liver king wants to be when he roids
I'd like to see an arm wrestling match with Schoolboy 😅
Great story great guys great vid.  Thank you 🙏
JoJo characters irl
In my early 20s I did steroids and worked out a lot now I'm 30 with a broken back...
These guys are absolute BRUTES ! These guys had fun !
https://youtu.be/igB2C38nTgY
these giants are such a sweet guys man.
I guess you guys got showed up by, "the weakest guy you could think of."
Their voices match their size!!  These guys are awesome!
This content is amazing  I like your dilevery  and editing  one of your fan and support #shiftyshoe
#HelpBillyCowartLiveAgain
18:26 - I heard a crack...call medic! xD
cute
Those are the biggest gay guys I have ever met. Who’s on top
Well done to the Stoltman brothers for a brilliant bit of Highland hospitality.
thor and eddie hall? what about Brian?
They are FAT not strong.
Really impressed with the 1 non-giant guy. He could do some of the things without having done any of the Penance the Giants have done.
Looks like so much fun to be with those guys and learn there stories
Tom and Luke are the type of people to be gentle giants.
Tom has Asperger’s not autism. He’s not that bad from what I can see.
These guys are big goofy teddy bears.
This is such a good story, so glad you all got to do this and then bring their story to us
These two giants are great people. Great video
Proved... Bigger guys are the kindest!!!
0:26 bruh ginats were just a bit taller than humans. Not huge like that
You have got to be kidding me! Too good to be true but yet here we are. These guys seem like the two most amazing people you can ever come across. From the minute you met them just smiles and genuine kindness. So inspired!!! Thank you so much for telling their stories if even briefly. It will no doubt change lives! Haha I  want to be friends with them!
And this sport has been ravaged by steroids. Anybody can be strong when they have the types of roids at their disposal like these cunts do
This guy makes good shit.
How do you think get so big eat eat n repeat . I used to watch Brian shaws channel and man he’s a monster but lost some weight cause they made the newer competitors are faster n lighter
I remember I read a story about a strong man for like the late 70’s -80’s and he was like 6’8” 340 monster and he was working as a bodyguard and got shot like 7 times and he kept coming and saved his dude and he lived and they said if he wasn’t that big n strong he would be dead crazy
more like no theory
I found this to be one of the MOST delightful vids you've published! All that manly flesh and muscles, oh my! And I have a fetish for Scotsmen/Vikings ❣ SO enjoying your channel!!
they honestly seem like the most wholesome people you know
"we brought the weakest" ... goes on to do pretty well
LO MEJOR DE LO MEJOR ,  EXCELENTE !!!!!!! Espero algún día conocer a esos dos hermanos gigantes , tengo cinco hijos y me agradaría que se conocieran para motivarlos en su vida atreves de ustedes. Los felicito por hacer este tipo de videos , DIOS PADRE los bendiga siempre. Un fuerte saludo y un abrazo grande desde Cuernavaca, Morelos.
strong? I see only fat.
Where you been guys?
Love these brothers!
I think there's something about the "gentle giant" stereotype. These guys seem like humble dudes. And I honestly haven't met a big guy who wouldn't take a couple minutes out of their workout to help with an exercise or spot you with no judgement of the weight level or anything of the sorts...
Their voice sound like the same because there are so big
just an awesome video.   2 Giants in life with hearts of gold.   respect to all of you.
this was cringy, wholesome and quite enjoyable at the same time haha :D you guys rly enjoyed yourselves like you were small kids again, tbh thats a beautiful thing
Bruv at 2.11 that is Oban not Glasgow lol
Cutest group of guys!!
Lmao way to go Eric!!!!! Represent!!!!! How is he doing this they ask, lol he’s Russian!!!
They seem like the nicest guys
omg they are so so sweet and such humble mens :3
How does people change from twig to literally Viking and how do they fix their eyesight, laser surgery or contact?
Yo Eric is strong af!
5:53 got me choking hah funniest image ever!
4:17-4:20
I kept waiting for one of the guys to say they accidentally pooped their pants.
Emmmm
I just wanna be a part of Yes Theory
The hell. That relatively skinny guy just lifted 160kg and walked with it. WOW
Is this channel dying :(
'The Scotland Highlands' lol. Scottish.
Listen. Yes Theory. I need to tell you guys. As someone that has come back from 2 attempted suicides, losing both parents in my twenties, severe mental downfalls including homelessness, with ZERO professional help. Someone that left the state of Florida on a whim and a gut feeling ON FOOT and traveled across 9 states of the US over the course of 4 months. One of those months in jail for stealing food. To eventually moving BACK to the last place on the that same trip from Florida 2 years prior, in that very last stop small town in Pennsylvania having my childhood dream come true of getting to creat a metal album on a professional level and film two music videos. I would LOVE to sit and share stories, and even adventure with you guys one day. I am. Down for anything.
LOVED THIS ONE , SO FUNNY AND LOVABLE!!!!
Ive never been into the strongman thing at all and this popped up randomly on my feed. I actually found myself grinning like a 5 yr old and laughing out loud! These guys seem like truly cool guys and the Yes team knows how to make an entertaining video! Scots wha hae!
lit
You are very different thought But you are great you tuber
They sound just the way I imagined them to
What a great video!
you pronounced my city right most people i see cant AMAZING !!
I feel better than I've felt in days after watching this. Great video. Great guys.
So where were they hiding? Did you end up finding them? Who woulda thought giants can be so good at hide and seek?
Peace and love from 🇩🇴❤
I really Love u guys ♥️♥️♥️  l love watching all of yr videos,as if i hv been there with your.. live life simple, happy n of course with much Loves for all ppls around the World is the happiest thing i want to hv in life.

Strong man watches puny man lift 80kg girders and asks : "How are you so strong?"  Hahahaha
Beautiful story!
I had nothing but a big smile and happiness throughout this entire video. thank you. Here's to the Strong Men
dude they are HILLARIOUS too like actual clowns just jocing the whole time that smile when he said 400 lbs and when he was staring at the food LMAO
On Basque Country also they do lift big stones and that kind os competition
Eric eastern european genes strenght hitting in
https://youtube.com/channel/UC9YwUsbyq6EkzBNQwSrFPkA
So jealous. Love the Stoltmans. Hope to meet them. This is like a dream day for me.
Eric fucking killing it

i love them both even thou they are giants you know that there personality is real nice.  i wish i could be friends with them. this video really makes me happy especially when one of the guys was able to lift the 100kg stone.
You mean strongest man lol.. Only 1, the older brother is strong sure but he is not the second.
strongest man in the world is on the spectrum. #superHero
awesome. spend the day with Jeff Gray. ...at Honor Your Oath Investigations.    God Bless the Homeless Vets  Tiocfaidh ár lá
why does it show the town of Oban labeled Glasgow haha
Why did you guys edit out the most important part of being a strongman competitor? The part where they inject buckets and buckets of exogenous testosterone, growth hormone and god knows what else?
Eric is too OP
Ey
WOULD THEY BE INSULTED TO BR CALLED "fASOLT & fAFNER"?
This might be the best yes theory video I have seen yet!
Watched this video with a big smile on my face the entire time
they are so fine
ask them next time to scratch there back and get it on film
kaber toss man lets go highland games in vermont
if you can get from Glasgow to Inverness in three hours I don't like your driving
I shed a tear hearing Tom speak about his autism and overcoming it, now thriving and at the top of his sport what an inspiration.
This is the most heartwarming video, you really see that they take pride on what they do, even sharing their life as well.
How many times you eat ?  Guy went '' Sex''.  What a legend.
That was fun! Thanks!
BRO THE NORDIC TRACK LOOKS LIT
okay 👍🏽
Eric💙
when i see videos like this i think to myself that i have wrong image of the world they all r like me like us we r us no matter where u from
that's one of the most gaylike video I've ever watched
@ 6:41 - 6:43 look how big the dang plates are, LOL...
I am your fan. I am very poor. I have a hope in my life. I will use an iPhone in my life. I don't know if it will be fulfilled. Please please please 🙏🙏🙏
I loved it man
never seen a homosexual couple this big
I would never say that Tom is autistic
That was sooo funny, thanks guys!
I've not watched this video in a long time. I genuinely smiled the whole time re-watching it. Thank you, Yes Theory. You are all amazing <3
💪🏼❤️
I am 5 foot, 110 lbs and I have wanted a giant to overhead-press me for decades.  <3
What are gorgeous couple they are.
Even their voice sounds heavy
Wow, I just came across your channel and watched 7 days in Syria and now I see this. I worked offshore with Luke, he's a huge mountain of a man. He said his brother was bigger, which I saw when he won the title, was it end of last year, or start of this year? I can't remember.
My baby Eric strong af 💪😤
Was not expecting those voices of fucking timber
How cute were they on day 1 of waking them up by jumping into bed with them with their huge sweet smiles!!! 🧡🧡🧡🧡
As a larger framed person, I just want them to hug me and pick me up and carry me 😍🥰 It’s hard to find guys bigger than me lol
I really enjoyed this story, this needs to be shared far and wide
Eric is so strong.
From Canada...Scots rule!  You guys are awesome!
Nice
Except their not giants. Just average height weight lifters mate. Infact midgets if put next to a boxers, a basketball/rugby team..  Calling them giant only make their egos giant. nothing more..
As a lifter with autism, I'm crying.
I LOVE Scotland and The Scottish People! From Mauritius!
Woke up feeling so down.... watching this jst lift my spirit💛✊
Hulk would be really happy to meet you guys. Amazing Giants. Respect.
The yes theory crew should go on a trip to visit the least visited countries in the world ( that are not closed to visitors)
I’m from Scotland
This was so wholesome.  Since a wonderful story. These guys all seem like good guys.
Bro… why wasn’t this coming up on my feed before, this channel is awesome! Yes awesome! Inspiring  awe
So much testosterone in this video 😄
how to get a hernia in scotland :)
Those dudes are supercool ✨
How much Testosterone?  : yes
Would’ve been awesome to fight along side these beasts in the olden days.
The next Eddie Hall - 7 years old https://youtu.be/Bb5YGHb5kv0
Legit living TITANS! Mad respect !
I wonder if they've ever eaten Chankonabe. The food sumo wrestlers eat.
Well if the weight lifting doesn't work out for them they can just become a moving company
Beautiful brothers, so humble and down to earth! Fantastick persons and truly super athletes, enjoyed every second of this video, Thank you for sharing this!
your image of Glasgow at the beginning is Oban :)
Dude... even their voice is bigger than you guys.🤣🤣 like their voice would beat your voice up in school.
Hi watching from Philippines 🇵🇭
Thomas in between on breakfast table is lit!
I can understand thick accents but their voices are so deep I don’t understand what their saying
Guys how about your sex life 😅 I’m just wondering your future girlfriend will crushed lol
I'm a lot jealous. If this was about women all the comments would be about how obese they are instead of the nice comments this video has.
Oh my god they seem SO FUN!!
Tom I'm single if you're available. My grandad was a glaswegian. Nicest sweetest funniest guys I've ever seen
“Gentle giant” is such a cliché but whaddya know… they really are!
they are so cute I might pass out
This was so awesome!! I feel like I made 2 new friends also! The Stolman Brothers==GREAT, HUMBLE, SUPER NICE. U guys are so lucky to have spent time with them! Thanks ❤🇺🇲  P.S im definitely a new fan!
I live in Scotland and didn't know the strongest Man was from Inverness. What a great vibe from them, and great synergy with you lot. Welcome to Scotland.
These men seem almost unreal in stature, yet so personable and wise in person.   God just seeing them put hairs on my chest
They even sound like Norse gods 🏆
really fucking wholesome video those lads are jokers
Giants are not a myth!!!!!!!!!
I'm Scottish and these too make me proud to call myself Scottish. Slàinte!  I'm rooting for all of you  ^_^
It would take me like 1 hour to eat breakfast holy moly!
I felt pure joy watching this video. Thanks to all of you!
"I'm 70 kg" "That's cute init?" Hahaha
My 18 year old son is Autistic and he now goes to the gym 6days a week he never interacts with anyone in the gym. He just listens to his utube channels and is insanely strong lifting heavy weight is the only thing he seems to focus on I'm going to share this video with him 💛💪
thomas :" im 70 kilos" big titan " thats cute "
you know Big Z?
As an Engishman, i do love the scots. Shame they hate us... the bastards :D
Interesting that they are so fat
oh my god i want to go to scotland
The Stoltman Brothers just seem like two of the coolest down to Earth guys ever, despite being world class athletes with fantastic work ethics!
Scandinavians are evolutionary bigger in average
You know working outs not that hard I started working out with my own workout and I’ve lost about 20lbs and I’ve gained a lot of muscle and I have abs to now and my daily routine is about 1 hour long
Genuinely gentle giants
These dudes our best specimens of Scotland ; one guy needs to hit the gym a bit!
What a beautiful country.
It looks like I’m becoming your biggest fan. I never thought I’d say this, but I wish I was a guy (64 y/o American lady) so that I could have experienced the Stoltman Brothers event. I laughed so hard at all the silliness, and felt the heartwarming love that was spread all around. You guys bring me genuine joy when you interact with people from around the world. I love the channel and appreciate you sharing all your experiences with the world; especially me. I am now going to share this video with some longtime friends who I know will love it as much as I ❤️
„This is a Lime.“ I‘m dead😂
Lmao that one friend out of the boys was smoking them on the workouts he had to lift before as a youngin his form was better too
He looks TINYYY WTFG
this honestly seems like a blast to be around them
This is probably the most awesome video I have seen in a long time. We need a hole lot more gentle giants in our world. They are not ego driven, they give everything they have from their hearts. Great time watching this. Phenomenal gentlemen.
My youngest son has Autism and is very strong for his age and tall. I will definitely show him this video to boost his confidence and get him to take part in a sport where he can hopefully shine one day. Thx so much for this awesome vid.
Those are some burly boys.
The strong brothers are so strong and big but so cute like teddy bears lol☺️🧸
Them mf are huge
The trip from the grocery store to their house must be light work for them. An amazing documentary, well done 🎊
These fellas might be huge but their hearts are just as enormous. Truly a wholesome and heartwarming video :)
That poor toilet 😢
No offense to them, but they sound like you were creating a sims character and dragged the voice pitch all the way down 😄
Stoltman in swedish means proud man. Stolt man, The proud men.
I found this video uplifting. The Stoltman Brothers seems like very nice people.  Wondering how tall they were
Elbaf Arc?🧐🧐
boys day with men.
It's not easy to be the strongest man
here is a discomfort location for u guys  Hellhole is a large and deep pit cave in Germany Valley, eastern West Virginia. i don't think u can do this
Tom is now 2x World’s Strongest Man
So much respect. What genuine fun.
THEIR VOICE !!!
I love how they said they brought the weakest man for this yet when they were working out he was the strongest😭😭
“Im 70 kilos” “That’s cute innit”😹😹 they are hilarious great video❤️❤️
@05:48 😆😆
Love this. Awesome  ,down to earth  guys. The breakfast  scared me.
these smelling salts turned eric into hercules.. like WTF the smallest of the 3 lifting the most.. NEVER judge a book by its cover
Love these two.
These brother are just two awesome guys. Extremely down to earth and humble. Just genuinely good human beings
So he wasn’t the weakest 😂🤣. Good for you
He is a Psychopath Looks small but has a Beast Strength.  Just Like me.   Whenever I show great strength with small body People freak out and shout at me: Psychopath!
great couple of men.
Are they twins?
Nephilims
as a very scrawny guy thats on the spectrum, Toms amazing to me.
I wonder where their wives or girlfriends are?
The guy (Eric?) who was screaming so fiercely  and then that small plop when he dove under water was so funny 😂
Was yes theory a editor for a school education system
I do like how they make fun of theirselves in front of the strongmans hahah
Am i the only one imagining the brothers saying "Boy" like kratos
Gracias por compartirlo un saludo 👍
Thank you
These guys are in a league total of their own...
even their voice is stronk.. 😳
When they were all eating breakfast half naked... 😝 so funny.
The whole vibe of this video was awesome! Also I can't even imagine how expensive their diet must be. Not only is healthy food more expensive but they are buy a lot more than an average person would buy.
They are not the two strongest men in the world but an African man.
What is the music at 3:05 ?
Of course they’re Scotsmen!   - Scotsman
my toxic trait is thinking i'd be able to do all this
It is not a myth  IN the HOLY BIBLE GIANTS WERE REAL AND VERY WICKED THAT'S  WHY GOD SENT THE FLOOD  TO DESTROY THE GIANTS  AND DAVID  KILLED THE GIANT GOLIATH! I BELIEVE THE BIBLE GOD'S  WORD OF TRUTH O.T. STORY SAYS THE GIANTS CAME ABOUT BY ANGELS HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN DEMONS FROM THE DEVIL FYI:  HYBRIDS IN AFRICA SOME MEN ARE 7FT AND TALLER I BELIEVE THE TRUTH LIVING GOD OF SPIRIT TRUTH AND JESUS GOD'S  SON WAS GOD HIMSELF A  MAN IN FLESH THE DEVIL IS A LIAR AND NO TRUTH IN HIM!!! JESUS IS THE LORD!!!! AMEN GLORY TO OF HEAVEN AND EARTH MY CREATOR GOD MOST HIGH
Bloody brilliant! They stay not far from me, awesome guys!! 💪🏻💪🏻
Being a 15 year gym goer, I noticed the bigger, the kinder you get. Most well built   strong men are some of the kindest and helpful people.
That skinny guy is strong AF!!!!! The big guys can't believe it
Oh my lord this was awesome awesome awesome!!! 🤣 Thank you SO MUCH
02:57 Outlanders activated 💪
THE REAL.       BoUNCER
This is one of the best YouTube videos I’ve seen in a long time
It always seems the world strongest men guys are always the most laid back nicest guys
This was an awesome one! These guys seem like great people.
You guys are so cute!!!! So fun to watch over and over❤❤❤
You guys are so cute!!!! So fun to watch over and over❤❤❤
https://youtu.be/k8HFV5uqWNk
Very Nice
Am I tripping balls or did you guys go up a million subscribers s in the last 36 hours?
The biggest guys also have the biggest hearts
Cool vid! Cheers!
🙄😳😲
how
I would lift that stone and stay in that position for rest of my life.
Here's my THEORY: Eric is the scapegoat of Yes Theory because everyone is insecure that he is actually the SMARTEST, STRONGEST, FUNNIEST, MOST CAPABLE, and HOTTEST of them all! xo
strong yes very much YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
The real person who needs a shout out is their mom!  It couldn't have been easy to give birth to two dinosaurs.   Lol...  Awesome video!
This made me so happy lol
Wow I loved this
I'm sure i heard something crack in that arm wrestle 🤨🤣
very cool guys even after there celebrity
You guys should go check out Cerro Gordo and Brent who owns the youtube channel Ghost Town Living. Brent is an awesome guy and Cerro Gordo is an incredible adventurous place.
Nothing puts a smile on my face like achieving heavy lifts bro. Got so hyped when you guys were lifting boulders
5.55 when there all sat at the table with ther tops off,the guy in the middle looks like the child at the adult table 🤣🤣🤣
Nordic Sky Brothers Spacecraft sighting https://youtu.be/4KXdwMlJhxI
There's just something about the manic scream at 4:08 and the itty bitty *plop* as he dives. Dying.
This is such a good example of masculinity. They exemplify the masculine ideals while being good respectful people who love what they do. A lot of people go on about Masculinity being inherently toxic but that isn’t the case at all.
These two brothers were so much fun!! What big hearted, humble Giants.
Enough to make a grown man cry...but not this man! GET BACK IN THERE TEAR!!!
You just need some turbulant juice!
These guys are world treasures
They make hexafluoride in their lungs instead of CO2
How many times you they shit a day
Amazing story
Those 2 strongmen seem like the coolest guys on earth. The way they got excited when that guy got that atlas stone up was awesome was cool.
Stoltman brother are really cool and genuine guys I'm really impressed and inspired. Knowing about their lives was a fun ride.👍
Lovely guys you all
Humility.
The weakest man was actually the strongest man 😂
Yes theory is SUPER WHOLESOME🥺💗💗love it so much!!!
Nordic track just changed the game.
great content
10k calories a day, and they burn every bit of it. I would just turn into couch cushion.  Not just really great guys, but an awesome story.
That poor toilet.  🤣🤣🤣
This video was honestly wholesome I couldn't stop smiling 😂💗

My favorite video 🤘🏼❤️they just earned my subscription, not that it matters right lol
It's like take your little person to work they for them
Definitely one of the coolest things I've seen on YouTube
That "Very nice!" Is worth every second of the video
They seem like the two coolest guys ever… For them to invite into their world for a brief moment in time and treat you like family is just AWESOME!!!!  👊🏼💯🏆💙
11:21 😂😂
And they look natural no crazy steroids useless muscles
They are just like big cuddly teddy Bears 🥰
Love these guys. They seem very genuine. Would love to meet them to see if they're taller than me.
The Stoltman Brothers look fierce and intimidating but they just have this aura of gentleness and love.
The 2 brothers are so cool ,, this was fun video,,I wish them all the best ..

That two guys so amazing 🤩
Looking at what strongmen have to eat I’m convinced all hobbits were secretly giant muscle packed dudes
A Christian is someone who has Believe the gospel and repented and the Lord lives in them. Believe the gospel, repent and call upon the Lord , do it now.
Israel fought against giants and won with the help of God. Believe the gospel,  repent by asking the Lord to forgive you and invite the Lord into your heart. The Lord loves you !!
Do these guys take steroids as well Or it’s all natural?
everything is about life
I really really enjoyed this. Thanks heaps and kind regards from a nana in Australia. 🤗
The weak man ends up being the strongest out the group. Put some respect on that man's name for now on! Lol
10k calories a day is just greedy
18:26 that c r a c k
@yestheory I'm a Kenyan,would you be interested in climbing Mt. Kenya and doing a docu on Gorillas and Chimps in East Africa;(Rwanda,Uganda and the Mt.Elgon area, then exploring Mombasa for that delicious sea food?
Gentle giants,awesome and fun🙏
The intro started off  epic and legendary with the history about giants and Vikings but the video ended up two giants being childish and playful.lol
This is so fun to watched!!! 💯💯💕
i have a passion for the sport
I enjoyed this video so much. They are gigant by size but even more by their souls and charm. This is real life power 💪
4:10 did him dirty there xD
Oh I love this video! I really enjoyed watching it.
Giant's hide & seek the best one🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They’re super wholesome lol
What a beautifull video!!
So the saying is true, the strongest man have the softest heart
Hahaha! These guys are Awesome! Only another male would appreciate the Thrill of lifting a concrete Ball!
This is my favorite I think… 🤔 I laughed so much!
I've watch 4 and a half mins and I can't see it getting any funnier than 4:10 LMAO! Goes underwater like a bull in a chain shop; comes up like a fresh born calf ='D.
So endearing !
Great video ! I hope they have chickens with all the eggs they eat! I would love to have them over for just one day to lift alll the things I can’t!
I don’t know when. But at some point this got sus AF. This is comfortable masculinity.
"That's how many eggs i eat in a week" *HA HA HA*
That’s Oban not Glasgow 😆
So inspiring! I was watching and enjoying the video as soon as Tom said he was diagnosed with autism I had goosebumps! As we recently got an autism diagnosis in the family a 4yr old and now we have big hopes seeing this! Much respect ✊
He sounds like kratos and he is a very nice person ❤️
It's so fun watching you guys having fun with them. They are such generous and humble human beings..
Traveling from Nepal to Scotland all in one morning sitting at my desk. Glad to run into your channel! Been to a native American sweat lodge yet?
you should meet the great khali (dilip singh)former wwe wrestler. he eats like 30 eggs ,2 pack of bread and meat that normal human is unable to eat in regular morning breakfast.
I haven't laughed so hard for a while. Loved it
Easily my Favorite Strongmen ever. The brothers are Inspiring, True Hero's. Brotherly love and support is unequaled. It's what brothers do.
Kind Giants!
Dude this is awesome it's like a real shows series on here this is a above average legit YT channel. 🤯🤳🙏💪😤💨
I made a video answering why they’re so strong. I also talked about African, Asian and Native American genetics. https://youtu.be/d_R2cQWKO3Y
Gentle giants for real 😍
I almost never leave comments, but these guys are too awesome!   I was watching all by myself and actually laughed out loud..  These brothers and hosts are just great  Huzzah!
My younger brother is autistic and sports already help him so much, he seems to be calm and in control whenever he's doing them, especially things that require some focus and balance. I'll show him this video, sometimes he struggles a bit with anxiety and knowing that his autism will not prevent him from doing things that he enjoys. Thank you to both of these brothers for being inspiring and compassionate, it was lovely to see how proud Tom is.
Man it's a crazy *ss fun! Worth the time!
I died with that sound effect @ 4:12 😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
I have met thor
As a straight male I wanna a big hug from those 2 giants ….
Most of the times the more someone feels powerful/in charge, the more he tends to be annoying, theese to are literally the strongest people in the world and the kindest humans, Tom is probably the kindest person in the world.
"I'm 76kilos" "yeah that's cute innit"
lol the biscuit eating and arm wrestle... gold...
They are so sweet and friendly! ❤ Giants outside and inside, for sure ❤
dude the stoltman bros were so nice lol
They're very down to earth.
Fat stomachs on those men.  Not all muscle.
Bad sports, you can enjoy picking on him, but when he punked you both, you coudnt let him have that total in your face victory. LOL Bitches.
Anyone would be pretty intimated just by looking at them, but they are just super gentle and so sweet and cute tbh. Hats off to you, Stoltman Brothers 🙌 ❤ and a big thank you to Yes Theory for sharing a small part of their amazing lives ❤🙌
What a bunch of rad guys! The Stoltman brothers seem like such good, down to earth men! Definitely gained a new fan today 🤜🤛
What kind people!
They’re now my favorite strong men lol they’re so chill
I don't think it's a healthy lifestyle.
The older brother look like Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye)
18:25 that pop didnt sound good
I think they should go on one of your adventures lol
Hey guys amazed by how reasonable and down to earth lifestyle these two are living....hoping to meet them in the future
us scots can never be beaten
https://youtube.com/c/BlueiceYogi Blueice #blueice
These dudes were great!
Oh man, the most wholesome, hilarious workouts ever! I'm struggling to breath with all the belly laughs. Luke and Tom are an absolute blessing! Like having two kids, times are tough. They move after school to go work. Times improve and three younger sibs in the house. They come home and these whipper snappers bugging their big brothers and the two older lads have fun with them. Im the oldest of six so happy families right there! Loved every minute. More please?!
"I'm 70 Kilos" "Thats cute"  LMAO
Their brotherhood is amazing :)
I eat 10 000 calories a day so I'm half way there!
The biggest men always have the biggest hearts
I would cry if one of those men were to yell, their voices could rumble the world 😂😭
Such amazing people, so much respect and love to them 🙂
What a heartfelt message throughout this whole video and the way the Stoltmen brothers are so grounded. Thank you for sharing the inspiring back-story!
“we brought the weakest man we could think of on this” - dude literally smokes them on the weight challenges, happy for that dude
You took the names of Thor and Eddie but forgot my boy Brian.
My granpa is strongest man in the world, but no one knows about him. He's 94 and living in the woods alone, and he chops down trees with his bare hands. Those "strong men" are a joke, real man doen't flaunt their strenght and compete in some silly shows like a trained monkey lol. They can't even use their ki smh.
Unos genios estos "hermanitos". Se los ve con re buena onda!!!. Los felicito y sigan asi de humildes!!!
This is so great on so many levels
what good dudes
awesome video!
5:55 I think i downloaded the wrong last supper documentary.
These guys don't work out in a gym...they move their gym from place to place.
They're... so inspiring, they literally broke the code and figured it out, training that much is good for moral, and you get to eat 10 000 calories worth of any good stuff with it staying healthy thanks to their intense training. They're so nice too !
This video was a dope video man I loved it🤘🏽
i wonder what would happen if these guys did a massive cut
their voices are so DEEP
I just watched a bunch of shirtless men try and show how big and strong they were, and honestly I had so much fun watching it
so heartwarming
These men are REAL superheroes. If they are not in movies, I hope they are soon.
They seem like some genuinely humble lads to me . Sgoinneil .
Great video :)
Cool
they handle them like they're their toddler sons and its strangely cute
Just incredible. Wow.
very fun i really enjoyed this video :-)
@stoltman brothers  I suffer from autism and with the gym, I've improved a lot, I loved the video and I want to visit you guys and train for a week with you, I'm currently playing rugby and doing some CrossFit but shortly I want to move into strongman challenge, let me know if I can visit
Dude these guys are so funny they remind me of my brothers except way way bigger they could kill you by sitting on you but they are so humble and down to earth man i love these guys lol feel like i was really there this is amazing man
Love to see real superheroes, these guys are so cool!
I expected this to be a testosterone laden. "fuck yeah"  video that would have me clicking past in no time, but the humanity of it was amazing, the brothers are the nicest blokes, and I was even elated when the Yes Theory guy got that stone up on the ledge. Nice production guys.
I’m an American who was born by Scottish and transplanted to new Jersey USA . I love my home country and these guys make me even prouder than I was to be Scottish !
so can yo be the strongest man in the world if you dont have belly. like the the lean figure of the terminator
Back in medieval times :   Englishmen : "Oh, we're going to fight some dirty bunch of scotsmen peasants. It will be done in a minute." Scotsmen :
I don't fully support this. So much food, animal products, effort, and risk all for the sake of really high levels of strength that serves no practical purpose isn't such a good thing IMO.
all I can think about is how good their hugs must be
Hey yes Theory I’m Kurdish I love your videos I have Been 3 Years of been watching you guys
I love men in kilts!!!
I'm not sure which would be harder trying to work a full-time job and doing that or eating all that food
Blessed to be what they are today. My name goes back to King Rhothgar.
The beginning when you see two big guys walking bare footed fist's clenched, wearing nothing but dresses. (I know they are kilts.)
Ok then all sitting at the table with their shorts off and tons of food is hilarious!
Ok, I’ll say it, I bet their parents couldn’t wait to get them out of the house, could you imagine feeding these brutes?!?!
Quintessential brotherhood,great guys
This. Was. Brilliant.
Wow I didn't see a moment in this video where there just wasn't pure love. Shout out to the yes theory cast and these great fellow strongman with hearts of gold.
5:47 the funniest smile in youtube history lol. That slow smile hahahhaha
Boy, the cholesterol was off the chart!
Great video
I think this was one of the best Videos I've ever watched and trust me I've watched thousond upon thousands of videos. This was great to watch fr🙏
Loved the video, so awesome you guys came to Scotland. Anyone else think the image at 2:11 is Oban and not Glasgow though?
Oh man I have just fallen in love with thesse guys.What loveable characters (Well, they are Scottish). I would have loved to join in going swimming in that ice cold water, Something I have been meaning to do for a long time now. But these guys jusst make you smile. A pair of guys who could turn even me (and im also not a small guy at 354 pounds) into mushy Pea soup without much ado, are basically a pair of big friendly and very loveable giants. May they live long and prosper !   Greetings from Germany
What such awesome brothers like no bs soooofn inspired
interesting observation - the world's strongest men are white, naturally.
This video is amazing. This was super entertaining and the great moments like Eric lifting an Atlas stone, it all felt like I was there with them in that moment of celebration lol the Stoltman Bros are definitely amazing human beings
19:05 the fact that you can see abs considering how large this man is says a lot
Gentle giants …. I wish I was friends with them. Nobody would mess with me :)
Why is Oban at the beginning with “Glasgow” written on it? 😂
real life paunch
My voice is deeper than either of these guys, but their necks are so thick and chests so large they have a lot of wet-sounding resonance in there.  They literally sound like giants.  If they have a sister, I think we could make babies that produce sounds lower than the range of human hearing (before puberty).
Tom just won his second strongest man in the world title.
My son said that he doesn't struggle with Autism. He dominates with Autism. Lol To bad I live in America. The Stoltman brothers are hot.  Thank you for the videos.
You guys are beautiful, HEROES and inspiration to humanity. I'm in awe. It is so encouraging to see you pushing the boundaries lads. Peace love and hope for the world from NZ. 11:35 Hmmm laughter and doubt, Go, get em!
Loved watching .
Hi.
I'm Scottish, Irish and English on my mother's side. It's so awesome to see how cool and lovely the people there can be. They're like puppies with the body of a great Dane
Those are MASSIVE plates!!
2:11 “Competing in Glasgow” shows Oban 😂
They are saying that they are giants because they haven't met Our great Khali the wrestler
The lamp! This is the best! In love with your channel! Hahahaha
wish they were more toned. they could look like marduk from tekken.
this is really fun
They’re so wholesome! I fuckin love it!!
Big muscular giant ginger Scottish men get me hooootttttt! 😍😍😍
Tom looks like Jake Paul if he was buff
😂😂😂😂
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 love this country and people so much
this was a pretty good, entertaining and wholesome video guys
Jätte, not gigant
Damn! I gotta move to Iceland right away! Plenty of hot and tall sexy vikings over there 😍😍
😃😃
Owww monster voice
🥰 ❤️ This! The genuine friendship is palpable! 👍❣️
I live in Inverness to
Ah! I’m commenting AGAIN. I should have just waited and watched the entire video before commenting but here I am. The ending challenges had me laughing so hard my face started hurting but I kept rewinding it so I couldn’t stop laughing 😂.
I smiled the ENTIRE time watching this video. I love you guy’s energy and I’m so glad you met up!!! 🤩 I felt like I was right there in the room with you guys. There were a few times I got nervous and stopped breathing. 😂👏👏👏👏👏👏
I feel my spine just from looking at wjat these guys can do xD
13:40 I was holding my breath the entire time
Omg if he barked at me even just a little bit I’d piss myself. Never mind. I have “mental disorders” myself. I don’t know how to explain without offending anyone. This made me rethink my entire life when he said he had autism. If you ever see this…I’m so proud of you!
That first guy’s voice is so deep I could feel it in my chest when he spoke. Weird.
Dude even their laughs are like those of Giants  thats so cool
I just watched y'all live out so many of our dreams. Fair play to the boys for having you out. I really enjoyed this. You should reach out to Brian Shaw and Eddie Hall. They, just as the Stoltman brothers, are truly genuine and great men.
stoltman means porud man in norwegian and they should be proud of all they're achievments
In one fell swoop, I re-fell in love with strongman competitions again.
I was laughing a lot when I saw them having breakfast together. The size difference was/is amazing!!!!!
Oh man the breakfast together was just too cute ! Wow that workout was intense and fun to see ! Youguys are gonna need a rematch I think!
The hugs warmed my heart
the testosterone in this video is way too high for me to handle
This video made me feel great.
Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, which geologists claim is from volcanic eruption, is actually the hair
Why are their voices bass boosted? Do they bench with their larynx?
Honestly very unexpectedly heartwarming 😳🥺
This was one of the most entertaining videos I have ever watched!!
If they got a custom halo spartan suit (that's actually steel)  they could be like the closest thing to a spartan
Plz visit Gilgit Baltistan the land of peace
Toms face when he said he weighed 400 lbs 😂 it cracked me up
Omg... This is the video that got me to The Stoltman brothers' channel 3 months ago! I just watched it again after being a full on Stoltman supporter and fan!! I love these guys so much and now Luke's wife, Kushi posts videos on her channel. It's so addictive! The most humble loving brothers. Actually all top strongmen are so nice and very enjoyable to watch. 🌶️🥰
the only way to describe this video is fuckin MANLY
This was so much fun to watch! The Stoltman brothers are awesome, so down to earth and humble. You guys must have laughed so hard, truly brilliant episode. Thanks yes theory, you guys rock!
Gentle Giants r Kool ppl. Humbled and Respectful. They make a better world.. Unfortunately, theirs not enough of them on earth. Thanks to all and respect to all.
Credit where credit is due. Great video. Positive energy all the way through. Nice one yes theory
Come to luxembourg, I SAY YES BRO!!!! Send you, all the love❤️❤️❤️
Great
I'll never judge people based on how they look anymore! I was just mind blown when Eric lifted the 200 kilos.
These guys all ended up in Rhabdomyolysis the next day for sure LMBO!!!!!
They're a big fluffy bears inside ಥ‿ಥ
Loved the connection between everyone. You need to do another collaboration soon!
FYI, last week Tom placed #1 strongest man in the world again for 2022 and Luke placed #7!
Wow, the Stoltman Brothers are such awesome fellows! Also, Eric seemed wicked strong for his size. Great video, wish I could have tagged along with you. I also have autism, and have enjoyed strength training, would have been quite the holiday.
That was such a cool video.  So much fun and laughs
love it, I heard Thomas' bone crack! my my
tom just won again
watched this again so funny x
Ok, after this I have definitely crush on Eric 🔥👀😅💗
As someone who has asperger and loves strength training i see tom as my hero
Loved watching this video, put a giant smile on my face ❤
4:34 fuck you for coming I thought him say
Tom has jut won his second worlds strongest man title. Absolute legend
They are so cute omg
That was cool 💪🏾those Guys deserve way more recognition 👏🏾I love watching history of Vikings one of my favorite documentary’s
Erick is a RUSSAN so he is very strong!! Others are such weak weasterners
wow eric!!!! really how you are that strong!!!!! well, i know where this is leading..... you soon gonna go shinny bald and will wear yellow costume with red cape on it!!!! lol
i am 165cm and if i see these guys i wont be terrified but will be very terrified in amazement! lol... i have once seen local national basketball players here in the Philippines and when i saw them i even forgot to take a picture! i was so amazed of how tall they are..... these guys would be just the top of my amazement!!!!!
For a mere second I couldn't hear anything only having to feel fear for a few seconds
My dad's Scottish Scottish Times? If u can read this hope u remember me and if u don't then I'll be sad guess having a dark personality isn't so bad it's hard to smile in a world so big with billions of ways to die
The darkness will consume
In the ancient time were Vikings lived there was told to be Giants they  fight to the dead only thing u will find when ur up against one is death and darkness
i dont get why strongest men always have huge tummys, i want to look good not have a huge tummy, if i wanted a huge tummy id eat nice food ad drink too much, i wouldnt be working my ass off in the gym
They’re so cute🥺🥰❤️
If you’re interested in meeting them my brother and his team does something kinda cool like this they are huge guys like that but what’s cool is they fight in armor
Best moment in this video 14:00
Imagine a Guy that size and no tattoos. Future youtubers would be searching for him like crazy
they are just tall fat and, strong nohing special abaut them.
What a great characters these two, I enjoyed watching it !
love this vid so much
Tom fanclub
Even their voices 💀💀💀 mad
Hi, so I know you probably won’t read this, but I’ll try my luck anyway. Recently I really started to think about working out, because I’m pretty tall (197cm) and not that skinny. I think I have some potential for having a nice body. But I have no idea how to actually stick to the everyday routine of working out. If you could share some tips on how to motivate yourself it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Ferdinand (Great Video by the way, made my day in a way).
This feels like an only fans video that didn’t get to the end 💁🏾‍♂️💯
almost every video you guys make makes me cry haha
Not just the two strongest men in the world, but literally 2 of the nicest human beings you could ever meet. The love and joy I felt from watching this video was honestly beautiful and inspiring, especially in this world where fear, hatred and division  is being pushed more-so than ever. Really amazing video guys!
love these gentle giants, great guys. like always, great video!
Wow!!!!!
Their meal is what I eat in a week
I just can’t stop grinning all through. 😁😁 Wholesome content.
i loved it
what's really cool is those guys are actually huge but functionally huge. it's not like someone that's just lifting weights and taking steroids it's actually a massive man that's super strong . it's actually amazing to see the difference between a bodybuilder and an actual strongman.
Man the story towards the end of the video really hit me hard. It makes me think of how I could have turned out if I had been lucky enough to have a supportive family member, even just one. I am autistic as well, and as a kid I was very strong, much much stronger than almost all my classmates, but as time went on my family didn't support me at all, in fact they abused me in every way imaginable even my own brother would go out of his way to make fun of me for my disability. So instead of continuing to work out, play football, and enjoy life in general, I fell deep into depression, became an alcoholic for a while and now days I am barely functional and have to be taken care of by my grandmother. My brother and father still to this day, at 31 years old, still insult me and put me down, knowing full well I am mentally disabled. I am very happy your lives went in a different direction than mine, I just wish I could've had a supportive brother too, who knows how I would have turned out.
This gave me so much joy
laught the hole time 😊♥️
Was anyone else but me rooting for Eric!!!!
This is such an inspiring video that I can relate to, since I too have autism.
The giant hide and seekXDDDDD
Two lovely big guys
Lots of fun watching this. Going to subscribe.
Try Dr. Sebi’s diet for 90 days and document the results??!?!??!! Please
Okay but ya’ll should Try Dr. Sebi’s diet for 90 days and document the results!!!!!!!!!!!!!
wow
Even his voice is strong omg
10/10 video. One of my favorites because of the vibes. Something I loved to see today
One of the best videos on your channel! For the people, the story, how you presented it, amazing job
Looks like y'all had a lot of fun. It was fun watching the video.
Guys, cardio causes you to produce more estrogen which makes you more feminine and smaller. Weight lifting produces testosterone, which will make you bigger and more masculine.
Dang these guys are epic 🙌🏽
Mighty, good hearted men. And a manly showing by you lads. Mad respect .
I love when i see Scotland in types of things like this and I seen where I live in Oban
Those men seem like the absolute most humble, and awsome guys to hang around,  and I can't imagine pissing them off, that's just crazy. Very cool 😎 👌
Decent videos but you are so full of 'Sales Bullshit'
The little plop sound when he went into the water almost took me out 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Enjoyed ever bit.. Good one..!  Good luck to you strong men..!
Love their accents man
So much positivity mannn. This was beautiful to watch.
i spent a day with half naked scotish men
Did not know I was going to fall in love with a giant today :)
Best Show Ever!
absolutely amazing videos and amazing humans
my thumbs are way bigger than yours - Tom Stoltman 2021
they seem so kind and nice and funny and humble and decent
Where pudzian
Why show a picture of Oban at the 2:11 mark when saying its Glasgow?
I don't support this because it's a waste of food IMO.
You should do an episode about pehlwans in India. It's a strength training and wrestling tradition with no toxic masculinity.
That plop noise when he dived in killed me off 🤣🤣🤣
Leave it to the scottish to make me feel like less of a man
Can you imagine the size of their s***
I love their accent so much my god.
luke is literally jake paul on 300 pound of steroids.
These are the nicest guys I love that they are so friendly
They had so much fun 😊😊😊🙃!
I really enjoyed this videos in particular cause, these rock guys inspire to overcome ourselves. Last part was really funny!! Greettins!
Loved this so much!
I love those strong guys dialect so much.
Such humble guys.
Best video I've seen this year
amazing people! wish them all the best!
5:54 I've seen this thumbnail before 🟧⬛
I busted out laughing when they picjed them up like dolls.
Goddamn dude... They're the most humble and indeed the STRONGEST!! Love them.
Yeah! These are the fellows I'd like to take to the, "Heart Attack Grill" in Los Vegas! Hoo wee! Ya just don't mess with someone who can throw a telephone pole 30 feet and more.
obviously they were hiding in the second drawer down. duh
12:30 oooo watch your toes...eek
This was wholesomely fun
❤️
Hey guys, This summer I'll dive with Blue sharks in Azores. Maybe there is an opportunity for you to dive with them and understand why they are so important for the environment.
I accidentally came across this video and now I'd give almost anything to meet and make friends with everyone in this video. Taking nothing away from anyone else, but I wish I could hug Tom. That guy... holy shit... just watch the first hug he gives when they meet. He's genuine, he's happy, he humble... and f'n 'ell... he's legitimately a super hero.
This is without no doubt one of the best videos, including two of the most outstanding brothers on this planet, I‘ve ever seen so far on YT. Impressive personalities, mega funny video! Greetings from Switzerland 🇨🇭😎🇨🇭
Never laught so much on YouTube. Awesome dudes! Much respect for u all❤️
I am so jealous.  That looked like it was so much fun.  Those two brothers are awesome.
These two guys are my new model in life. Not strongwise, but in how they approach life
That's Scottish people for you. Humble, funny, warm. Miss Scotland.
Literally the best video I’ve ever watched! Genuinely impressed by the brothers and by you guys doing this segment! Good on ya boys…
Please. Come here in NB, Canada in St. Andrews. To put some joy in this town cause its like a very silent town. But people are very polite and easy to be with ❤
Two fantastic lads. Seen Tom on the pitch at Ibrox, inspiring fella. Great video
This was really fun to watch! It made my day after a tuff day at uni.
Playing hide and seek with Tom! 😄
I simply love scotland, it's such a beautiful country♥️
I felt so LITTLE watching this 🥸😬
Those guys a real life gods
there is only one God and his name is Jesus
The one in the middle of the giant brothers looks like a toddler 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This has been my favorite episode so far.
This is the best thing I've seen in my live ))))
I cant tell you how much I enjoyed this one thanks guys
True brothers
I'm only 6 ft 290 lbs  130Kgs  and I struggle to get clothes to fit, I take a size 12 shoe usually stores are out, where do you get your clothes?
Those guys seem so cool and just down to earth. Would love to workout with them!
Where are the Barbarians?
Oh... shit... this video ends.
I loved this video <3 made me cry out of happyness <3 thank you guys
These guys are true inspirations! Thank you guys so much for your channel!  You're all AWESOME ❣
clicked for the sexy strongmen's fit butts. stayed for the kind hearts and laughters. those brothers are really nice guys! what a chance to hang out with them! parties must be awsome in the Stoltman clan
very nice
If I were yes theory 15:19 is a moment I would frame in a photo!
great story .... good fun
This is the best video ever xxxxx
this is like john seed from far cry 5 all over again lol
They r sweet gentle giants ❤️
No one will mess with a giants
Haha this video had me in stitches - fair play lads! 😂👍
Fun, educational and INSPIRING!!!!!
OMG. What are they sniffing?! Poppers?!?!?! 😵😅
I love how they are all shirtless 😂😅
Wait do they compete with other people or is it just them? I’m confused cause I only saw them,At the stadium?🏟
This video is amazing!!! Love the Stoltman Brothers....
Sorry, but at the beginning where it says glasgow you have a photo of a town called Oban.
WOW, having watched Tom and Luke compete in strong man over the years, you could not have picked two greater guys to do this with, was great to see their personality’s shine, and to just take a little glance into their lives and preparations for competitions, they maybe strong men, but they have huge hearts and great look out on life, they are not just true Flowers of Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿, but the pride of the UK 🇬🇧.
I gotta nortic track 👍
I said " holy shit", Gob Bless, then he said the same thing but I said it first, man I love those moments 🤣🤣🤣🤣
inspiring 💖 and entertaining!
This was fun 🙌🏼
Loved the wolves video, but the Scottish music/ scenery hits me different in this one. Love it. :)
The NBA..lol giants.
you are the best! jajajajaj
Such an amazingly wholesome and funny video !! Loved every moment of it !  Eric is so fucking strong, holy cow !! I wasn’t expecting him to do all this lifts like that !
these guys are big but they're short compared to the vikings
this is awesome!
His voice is so… DEEP!
This was such a joy to watch.  Love the close bond between the brothers.
"I'm 70 kilos." "That's cute UwU"
That was an absolute pleasure to watch. An inspirational demonstration of strength, in all senses. Thank you.
Man,  I'd give anything to train with these brothers!
Man the super deep voices with Scottish accents killed me lmao I love these guys
man, this video made my day happy
How did Eric lift all that LMAO
The most bro-dude trip ever. Chillin with the strongest men in Europe, constantly shirtless, being dumbasses, lifting heavy weights, eating like kings. Brings out the caveman sense of happiness in me.
Such a funny and genuine moment 🤣🤣 5:47-5:52
The manliest and healthiest environment i ever seen.
ok is Tom single? i'm tryna climb that man like a tree
DAMN!!!!! they went all strength bro!!!!
Endomorphs are built diff
Now we know why romans built a wall between them and the Scotts. Imagine a full army of giants like these rushing towards you with shields and arrows.
Dude how much fun do these guys seem to be to hang out with lol
Just wonderful... always inspiring when siblings look out for each other
A shot of Oban with the word Glasgow over it 😮‍💨
5:00 this reminds me so much of ronnie coleman yeah buddy
I wish they were my brothers all of them
This is just the coolest vid ever!
They seem like such nice blokes. : >
big guys are always so cute and humble
4:11 I am crying😭😂😭 why y’all do him like that
They are so chill and humble too😂🤍
Best vid I saw ngl
Welcome to the "One of the best videos on the platform." Club.
Eric being that strong is very 👌
why the thumbnail remind me a disney movie brave
Nandu brand lungi
Loved every second of the vid. From start to the end.
These giants actually look terrifyingly big in real life, good to see they are just oversized normal people
i want one of them to say "finish him!"

*Clash of Clans Giants be like*
...to have Europe's Strongest man ask "How are you so strong"... He is living a dream hahaha
Its great being a scot
fat morons + steroids, creatine etc = ''heroes'' for the masses , VIKINGS , yes ?? HAHA  ( ''Piste Malibe au Gabone!2REP 3cie 2004-2005'' : video on YouTube )
They Are Modern Vikings 💡
We think ,they souldn't be taking weights from a full squat but a semi squat. It would build faster muscles and save some health problems, Best Regards !
Jesus, DAT VOICE!
6:00 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
It reminds me "Grand blue" anime, where were 2 muscled students, and few skinny newbies.
These two are the living embodiment of the Scotsman clan in Samurai Jack!!! And as a person, who's dabbled in power lifting, i am deeply humbled and motivated to restart.
You guys made Inverness look nice even though it’s just a regular not great looking city
I got a hernia just watching this
It's amusing that norse religion is the same in practically every way to greek religion, just with the names swapped.
lol 400 pounds plus guy just smiling at you like that... fuck me man don't eat me. ran through my mind. Damn! respect though for doing what you did though makes me want to try some weights
This made me so happy for some reason, good content as always <3
ohhhh Giant Men TAKE ME I'm yours!
this was way funnier then I thought at the beginning... great video and edditing
10000kcal a day... and I gain weight on my 1500kcal diet... o.O
Even his voice is strong. This video is awesome!
Definitely one of the best positive on youtube.
I really appreciate your videos because y'all are affectionate with each other!
Their voices man fuck I can’t even come up with anything to say
Great video! So fun to watch.
what i am loosing??? :D so good...!!! i start to see your videos today, and im enjoying so much!!! Thank you for your work @Yes Theory... And Thank you StoltmanBrothers... its so good to see this...! ;)
I love the one with the curly hair and beard he's so effortlessly funny
13:30 my back broke just from watching
those 80 kg farmer walk I beams look like serious toclippers if you are not crefull putting them down...
❤️Jesus can change yr life
Brilliant!!!!  I've never laughed so much 😂😂😂😂
Gorillas eat six times a day too........seems like it pays off.
I really hate placement image clickbait’s.
Fantastic video. Funny, interesting and enjoyable. How did the skiiny guy lift so much? That was crazy lol.
Woah strong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They both sound like Scottish Andre the giant
I had the best laugh in a while watching this video..Love the Stoltman's they are Great fun
theyre such gentle giants i love them ♥
They are so outgoing
getting big have to eat all day and most jobs don't pay that much
This was so wholesome 🥺❤️
What wonderfully wholesome content. <3
Nevertheless, a Ukrainian Oleksii Novikov is stronger than both of these men!! Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦
Probably they are related to the basque people, the indigenous people of Europe.
Aw they’re such sweet people
I am stronger than them lol
and men who are really wearing skirts.
How do they afford all that food?
Love it these boys look like true humble legends
The guys are so wholesome and kind, the encouragement they give is pure. I'd love to buy these men a shot of beer.
Inspiring stuff & Hide n Seek Dude got me good :D
I hurt my back watching them pick up those 100 kilo stones.
Anyone know the weight of the atlas stone the presenter lifted?
they seem soo cool! that’s so awesome
"...get the sugars going..." best nutritional advice I've ever heard!
I thought they ate more. I use to eat 10k a day in my teens .
He laughs like a beast.
two sweet, gentle giants. loved the video.
I would love to hangout with these guys
What a fantastic post.
Hodor Hodor..!!😱
Bring me to Korea please 😭😭😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Totally inspiring video. I shed a manly tear, over just the shear down-to-earthness, honest fun, great life story, and the wholesomeness of it all. I can totally tell that those Stoltman brothers are so genuine & fun to be around.
i love tom i have autism as well keep up the good work tom
they seem like the coolest people
Maaaaaaaaan, him pretending to be a lamp got me a lot! Jesus Christ LOL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Awesome video to show another side of these giants. Thank you so much for this.
Nahhh, this was too cool!
Crazy how they called him the weakest but when they were sitting at the table , he was the most cut from the 3 of them and then he was the only one who could lift the 200 kilos …
FAVORITE VIDEO!
They became yujiro hanma
Come to kenya and hung out with the world's most amazing people
the Stoltman Brothers are genuinely some of my favorite strongmen, theyre just such fun goof balls.
“Big strong hairy men” ~Jschlatt
idk but when you play the scotland music i think scotland for everr
The Scotland Highlands? Don’t you mean the Scottish Highlands.
I love how you guys treated them like brothers... Hella fun! God bless you Giants!
Me: Cant do 2 pushups Also me: they got me to keep trying to do more yes ik im very weak
That was immensely enjoyable. This stuff is way more fun without all the "alpha" posturing bullshit.
You didn't meet The Great Khali!?
When Luke pointed out that toms 185kgs tom had the biggest “I’m a boss and can eat you” expression on his face 😂😂😂
Thanks to a NEGATIVE REPLY to my comment, I removed it and now think that ALL youtube channels have BULLIES on them. Leaving a wonderful (and WAS) helpful channel. Good luck.
This was by far the best youtube video I've watched
That seatbelt is not going to be holding him
In Islamic ways.,....There lived Jinns in this world before Humans were created and Jinns were too much powerful...Once the Almighty Allah got anger on his creation named jinns cause they started doing wars in each other and bad other stuffs as well and also were disobeying the prophets of Almighty ....So then He sent an army force of the angels to destroy those evil jinns ! ....and then the chapter of Jinns ends up
what do they do to get those traps?
Strong men are the best humble giants 😇💪
I did not expect this to hit me so hard in the feels but this is gold.  I never comment on videos but I went from jumping around screaming when he lifted that stone, to crying from my soul.  What a random experience on YouTube, wow LOL
These gentelman eat per day what i eat roughly per week damm. Their metabolism must be on turbo mode to process that amount of calories.
the voices are so deep. Does this mean the stronger you are the deeper your voice is? or the bigger you are the deeper your voice is? not sure about that because i know big and strong people who have cute voices.
Ah bless the Scottish... the only fellow English speaking humans I have to turn subtitles on for.
Good morning team….! xD
Not a single once of toxic masculinity in this vid. Clap it up for them lmao
love it
18:49 highlight
Some of the worlds least agile men * those muscles won’t last long when they realize that that ugly diet needs to change if they want to live long
4:26 That made me smile
4:11 lol. Great stuff.
What a couple of thoroughly top blokes!!
very very good .amazing
Literally the manliest/wholesome thing I’ve ever seen
love all the way from cape town south africa keep up the great content
Wow 😍
Those giants are sooo fuckn cool and seems like it's really awesome to hangout with them .
Bunch of legends, all of you.
How is Eric the weakest he has the best genes out of all of them besides the giants
Celtic and Viking dna. That's what wins at strongman contests.
Viking genes
Honestly this is an example of a gay male relationship. Like no shit at all. Only thing this lacks in homosexual males is the sex. It’s exactly how it really is. Wow. If gay men where only represented like we actually are. This is it. The way those 2 big dudes acted and showed their relationship reminded me of my life and relationships. Anyone ever want to know how gay men really are here it is.
Great video- work on the handshakes though lol
Now, add in the juice and you see how it's done. Boom!
Wholesome and based.
Yes!, Amazing!
hey yestheory I like to invite you visit Srilanka and spend one night in the gotagogama
i totally enjoyed your vlog bro...hopefully soon i can excel on my video's with the help of our God...so inspiring to see this kind of vlog..Glory to Gld🙏
They both seem like really great guys and the things they can do are superhuman
Disgusting and ridiculous .
OMG, I’m cracking up!
his accent kinda sounds like hagrid from harry potter
The brothers increíbles 👍👍💪💪💪🙂🙂🙂👍👍👍
I'm not crying you're crying
I'm not even six minutes in and I already think the Stoltman Bros are two of the coolest people on the planet. Ngl, I feel bad for their toilets. A single serving of Taco Bell is usually enough to blow up any bathroom. That breakfast alone would likely put me in a Caloric Coma, but it's just the _first of six_ meals this Beasts power down daily. Thank Fuck there's such incredibly kind guys, bc they could make quite the mess if they had a mind to.
6:49 The Last Buffer
This is such a sweet video to watch
Gentle giants :) this video was very wholesome. They seem like really great guys, who have the best personalities I've ever seen someone have.
they look scary and innocent at the same time
I feel like the Scottish accent just gives them a 10% energy bonus.
Im proud to be Scottish 💪🏼
congratulations to you both .worlds strongest man and Europes strongest man .great to see a celt reigning again in world strength competitions
man you just KNOW these two give the best hugs
I just went to a Highland games event here in Vegas. Pretty fun
“We brought the weakest guy we could think of” and Eric said “Bet” 😂
Giants hide and seek ???? :)))
It’s always the big, burley could kill you in a second men that are just the nicest people
There is only one God and his saint Angels. Out the matrix
I love how the 'weakest man in the group' was able to lift those things haha W
It's fun watching demigods having fun with us humans.
i have never seen more supportive people
ok did any of you dudes suffer a hernia? LOL i hope NOT
11:00 casually doing a bit of drugs with some giants before working out. lol
Love your channel 💜 come to Vegas!!
they actually called Oban Glasgow
I smiled so much in this video 😃
great video, awesome two gentle giants..!
Translation : I spent a day in Skyrim xD
His voice is so deep and heavy 🥰😏
what a hoot lol
I love the stoltman brothers! So happy you guys made a collab with them
absolutely loved them.. and inspired by them
I smiled the whole time^^ gosh they're so strong! I used to carry super heavy things all the time for my job and for a 50kg girl I was quite good at it, but then my chiropractor preached at me for 30min, because I had lost 2 cm of heigh after a collapsed vertebrae. ^^ He told me that I'm not the "strongest man in the world and that I should stop doing this 'cause I don't have the build for it"....Now that I've seen the real strongest men in the world, I get what he was talking about XD  Nowadays, I ask for help to carry heavy things . I stopped trying to do everything by myself :D
Intro screen to Glasgow shows Oban...really?
these brothers are solid 💪 genuine, cool and humble people
That dudes voice sounds like the distorted voice they use for privacy censorship!
omg great video
Damnn, they sure do look and sound like giants.
R THEY NATTY?
these guys are awesome wow
Giants IT gives under US . Not many. Look in the Past There are Photos with Giants .
Man!! They even sound like true giants!! Reminds me of jack and the beanstalk when I was young. Fee fye foe fum,  I smell the blood of an English man!!!
Great video just sent it to my sister in Chicago , my nephew Ian has Autism aspergess. This will be a great video to watch yeah baby 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💪
Gentle giants.
This is HANDS-DOWN one of the most entertaining videos I've ever seen on YouTube! The Stoltman brothers are such amazing guys! Much respect! 18:26 I swear I heard something crack
@        Bloggers, help, support, please, go to rallies, do not be silent, Russia is killing Ukrainians
I absolutely love how the brothers can be this happy and stoked for newcomers! Inspiring! I wish I had a brother like Tom & Luke
I throughly enjoy your strongman brothers vid. Story telling was fantastic and found it genuine and amazing. You guys have great chemistry. Keep the content coming. 💪🏼 thank you.
ive watched  this video about a dozen times since it wss posted, and it STILL puts a huge smiles on my face... love you guys SO MUCH <3
They seem like such lovely guys!
Come visit fiji n explore here
3:20 That's song i heard it from TV show Called Oulander One of my favorite
Infantile.
Hands down the best and most inspiring channel on YouTube.
5:45 the smile on his face 😅
This is one of the best videos in your collection. Watching you guys with real life giants is just priceless!  I smiled from the beginning to the end.
I love these guys attitude.
This is Fantastic!
I love this video, many laughs had with you and thank you for showing autism can’t hold you back if you don’t let it ❤️
Dear Yes Theory, I am a student from India. I've been received an offer from Florida Southern College, Lakeland. But, unfortunately, I am unable to afford the cost of attending it. Can you please help me financially to pay the tuition fee? Thank you.
that sucks....when i eat 10,000 calories a day i just get diabetes...
i can't believe i saw in this video the colossal titan and the armor titan from attack on titans anime
These brothers are just amazing! Great video.!
I really enjoyed watching this video . . . Peace love laugh and happiness ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So, hear me out. I've seen guys who are not even half the size of these blokes, and showing off all those toxic masculinity. I've seen movie stars who are famous but not nice when they interact with people. I genuinely thought strong men would be worse. Then I got introduced into strongmen culture and I'm literally speechless. Not just these two, Eddie, Mr Beast and other strong men, they are impossibly strong, and also some of the coolest men on the earth. HOW!!!
:)
Man, I still remember being here when u only has 2k followers and literally felt like over night you had 500k. I haven’t been on this channel in forever and I can’t believe u guys have 7m… idk u guys but, proud of u. You guys did great things.
Or may Allah bless me with lots of happiness in my life, keep him happy forever and grant me a visit and grant him the life of his father. Amen. ♥ ️ ♥ ️
“That’s cute innit” 🤧
Wow those are the most awesome guys!
Wow how big and tall are these dudes.
These guys are so down to earth I mean they are the friendly giants that we read bout.
👀
When they were all sitting at the table with their    shirts off i laughed so hard 😂😂😂😂
That Nordictrack with the video exploration was a fantastic idea.
the "weakest person you could have brought" SHOWED YALL UP big time! LOL
That was entertaining and enjoyable.  They seem like such nice men.  Nicely done!
Not only a big body, but also a big heart, you guys are amazing!
saying he is the weakest, meanwhile he is doing mad things xD
These guys are awesome. They made me smile the whole time.
Why are they shirtless the whole episode. I mean I’m not compaining
I just found this channel. I have a smile plastered on my face right now. What a pair of genuine, kind and impressive men. God bless you Both.
Tom and Luke are both superheroes already and they're only going to get better! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💪
This was a wonderful video. Heartwarming and inspiring and funny. Great job all of you!  Shout out to the Stoltman Bro's for being both an inspiration and just all around great people!
Eric inspired me so much this episode
WHATS NAME OF THE MUSIC IN THE BEGINNING??
They're 🔥🔥🔥
I am scared of them
Giants with sweet hearts
Strongest eaters
Is it just me or dose everybody feel stronger when you not trying to be strong. Like just now I fixed my seatbelt when I wasn't even consciously thinking about it but earlier It was impossible
What a fun video! Icing on the cake was learning that Tom has Autism. As a special education teacher, most of my students have Autism, and this was very encouraging to see:)))
This was genuinely hilarious and inspiring. Love the Stoltman’s 👍
The Stoltman brothers are so sweet.  I love them
They have a deep voice for a giant holy fu-
goblins when?
I cant stop laughing at 4:09 to 4:15 I had to rewatch that so many times 💀🤺
So much fun to watch your vids
This was so cute (despite the manly builders vibe hahahaha) Loved it
This was so lovely to watch
These guys are so strong, yet controlled and gentle people.. Strength is controlled power... Respect to these people
The brothers voices are identical. Its uncanny. I thought that one brother must have been dubbing the other for a bit. Insane.
brooo they are soo kind
The hide and seek had me crying laughing
I'd like to live in Scotland someday. Wonder if they're ok with Africans lol
Some genuinely good Scottish lads. Respect.
This is why Iceland doesn't need an army
OMG loved this video you guys were all so cute and funny ☝️
He’s prolly out cheating  Him n the bois:
Cutest video
Daily shower in ocean is the best thing...
I LOVED THIS! So so wholesome ❤️
It was a really good lesson for me, as I’m struggling with some issues in life. No matter how many problems you’ve got, you can be the best you want.
Iceland🎉
I would love to be their own brother. Its just those two will be the peak of brothers you would want to have
Never stop smiling this whole video , these guys were amazing.
I was laughing the whole way through! Well done guys, what a great show!
I was diagnosed with autism at 16.
I love Yes Theory! Seek Discomfort.
Punny human !
no way he can with 3 man's and a machine with 200Lbs
Does anyone want to go with me to South padre tx for three days in April?
They are really looking dangerous but if you know them better they are so lovely guys
Brilliant video- brilliant athletes and people
They ain't giants, only on steroids
seem like top lads them and you can tell hes really proud of his younger brother, love it :)
Honestly did not expect this to be so wholesome gosh these guys are awesome!!
I got a hernia just watching.
You guys are so adorable I love watching your videos
Honestly paulers on stereroids
I’m sorry to say this but I think the were supposed to be the paulers dopplegangers but because of the STRONG they look like giants instead
This video deserves more likes and views
Woaaa amazing people like this really exists!!
Wish I could train with these guys!
9:58 bro didnt even break a sweat

I genuinely love these two brothers. Always brings a smile to my face when I see  Luke's cheesy laugh
Very interesting video, thanks. So those guys don't believe saturated fat and rapid sugars are bad, uh?

the excitement after lifting the boulder got me.
faith in humaity restored :)
You guys are awesome!! loved watching it
They would be beast in rugby
why I am smiling at everytime during this video? :)
How is that little man so strong?
Incredibly inspiring human beings. Would love to have people like those two guys around me.
Its like watching a family vlog 😭❤️
Didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I did, looks like you guys had a blast!!  Love that the two brothers are so down to earth too, how effing strong are they though!!?? Really shocking to see humans with that kind of strength.
Big guys voice sounds like they distorted the voice of someone else to make it unrecognizable
Attack on titan is history
Brother read my comment! One day, one skinny guy have problem with his motorcycle on the road, and that guy take the motorcycle up to his back and go by walk to his michanic! Do you know what they say for some peoples like this? They have little bid tail on their back, up from their ass! These people are not to many! They have too much power! And what motorcycle that was??? 1100 cc Gsxr
Tom your an absolute legend and an inspiration to so many. Alba go brath brothers
What’s up with their voices
Love seeing people bond !! 💯
15:15 broooo waitttt the screeeeaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmm!!!!
Two of the strongest men in the world maybe but not the two strongest men
The way Thomas prenounced excericse during the add made me mad. Lmao he says "exerzie".
Better not run into one of these dudes in the woods! Playing dead will not help either!
awesome video the brothers are just so genuine and friendly really puts a smile on my face keep it up :D
What's his name,eric?. Why does he look so familiar? YouTube videos or films🤔
Pls do same with georgian hulk and georgian bull
So much men love in one video💪❤
Mariusz Pudzianowski aka Polska GUROM
2 genuinely decent and humble guys. A rare thing in sport nowadays.
thx very good work 👍
Title should be  " I spent a day feet behind other men to make them appear larger than they are for a click bait picture"  Dislike hopefully this crap won't be recommended again, im sure it will
polynesians are more stronger
Its call strongman not  like today stronggay
Legends
I think this is one of the few videos I have never stopped smiling in. I LOVE THIS VIDEO SO MUCH OLS MORE VIDS WITH THESE TWO FRIENDLY GIANTS :)
Did anybody notice the water drop sound at 4:11?! lmaooo, the editor is petty,,,
Eric is a little beast👍👍
Heartwarming, funny and inspirational. Just what my hungover ass needed this morning.
Чудовий випуск. Хлопці схожі на дорослих дітей 😄
That was fun
where is MARK FELIX??
This was the most unexpectedly wholesome thing I've seen in a long time, great stuff! Keep it up!
giants before god? lmao
What i would give to stay with them for a couple of months and getting strong.
Why is their voices so deep?
Proper blokes, love these lot to bits.
just a bunch of topless men at the dining table LMAOOO
They look like they on a bulk for their whole life
what I wanna know is, how much the food bill a day is 🤣🙈
Why do both of them have so much cake?
For me the most funny thing is when they drive and at every humpback the big boys just dont jump up but the others just like fly
Absolutely love these guys, what a great video!
Didn't expect to shed a manly tear here man. Their story is really inspiring.
awesome video
Dam it looks lile you guys had so mutch fun
they sound like grizzly bears my god its so good
what brand is that fluffy hoodie? its so dope
I'm so proud of Tom
180 kg😶😶😶
I wonder how much elixir they cost
whats that song at 14:15 ?
The Literal Giant(No Offense that had black-ish brown hair and beard was the most Viking-ish!
Such a lovely video. They are both inspirational.
This is the funniest video on YouTube for me! I've never laughed so hard watching a YouTube video! 🤣
20:16 Any kid/ child would love to be on a picture with their strongest man of the world. And like to see his face. He is honored to be on that picture.
best video iv'e ever watched very inspiring i love how you guy's made everything in this video fun i really loved it and hope to see more
I care not for the size of a man, only the size of his heart.. And sometimes the body must be capable of carrying that immensity.
How mUch shit this guys gonna take🙄🤦🏼‍♂️😂
The Outlanders in us have awakened this episode 😂
A day with the boys. This was wholesome.
Man that was good stuff
You guys should come down to so cal and learn more about Scotland culture and come to a Highland games with me! I’ve been playing the bagpipes for years and would love to show you guys!
I cant imagine living a life where the first thing you do in the morning is go for a swim… in super cold water
I just love the wholesomeness and humor in all of this narghhhhhhhhh the thumb war !!
You ain’t see big ramy yet lol
Luke Stoltman looks like Nick Frost.
so nice
God is coming back soon pls all repent
I love how the Big guys are so excited for him! awesome
Baby medical kidnap by hospital. USA is a video. see now. 2022.  Yesterday Idaho Lt. Governor Janice McGeachin appeared on the Stew Peters show and said that she had reached out to Governor Brad Little to intervene in the Baby Cyrus medical kidnapping case, but that he refused. Due to parents not taking the clotshot they took him away from his breastfeeding mother and are trying to give baby to a foster family. Baby healthy and trying to give it away. The hospital in Boise, Idaho doing this. Child trafficking ring. Think for safety of own children.
They look so little omg HAHAHA (edit: yes theory boys look little)
Absolutely love the Stoltman bros. Great vid!!
ATZEN
Sweet fellas 🤗😁🤗
Such generous & fun souls, the Stoltman brothers! What a wholesome video!
There cool
Spending a day with two hot daddy bears 😍
This has some serious Hobbit Vibes :D
Wow they are gentle Giants ☺️ nice content man
Man happiness … lifting a 100kg rock to the table !!!
This was so good to see! lol!
2 big man with big hearts
Idk how i can live up to Tommy🥲
"im 70 kilos" "that's cute innit"
one of the brothers looking like a jacked Jake Paul 😂
i wish i was a kid so i can tell them to put me on their shoulder
As Max said in Get Smart, "Big people need love too"
These guys are awesome!
They are literally 5x bigger than Thomas.  That's insane!
Those guys seem amazing
They are actual Giants it's surreal to watch this, their voice is full of pure titan.
By far the funniest video of the week 😂 Love it
what a nice guys! true champions!
Oh my god! I just love this, what nice guys! I'll definitely remember the name Stoltman!
bro the sound when you have headphones on is fucking godly
Two guys that make me even more proud tae be Scottish
This video was adorable haha. I want to come play.
I cant imagine the gloating that must have came from your weak friend hahahaha
These guys looked like the absolute sweetest!
That audio edit at 4:12 was very uncalled for 😂😂😂😂😂😂
What God's, there is only One God! Allah (swt)
Damn these guys are really nice
I love the Stoltman brothers! I've watched them perform in so many strongman competitions, and they're always a class act. I loved seeing their personalities coming out in this video!
These handsome brothers are so so down to friggen earth and so humble I LOVE IT loved watching every bit of them!! Absolutely lovely❤❤
Dad? How’d you get a hernia? 😂😂
18:57 got a good laugh out of me
Stoltman brothers are the coolest.  That was great big fan now!!!!
@ 4:10 Hilarious😁😁😁😁😁 not fair at all
I can never quite get over just how bloody massive these dudes really are. Bloody Titans would be more accurate I mean Jesus.
I am from Syria I need money Help me 😭💔
I somehow stumbled upon this but so glad i did because it was so enjoyable and the Stoltman brothers were just fantastic. Well done to all of you, great watch...
My only critique, it is not the north of Great Britain, it is SCOTLAND and we are a free nation. Stoltmans are one of the best things to come out of us other than irn-bru! Great documentary otherwise 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
by giants i thought u meant fat people 😹
These brothers are awesome
This guys are just all life is about
they look tiny next to Shaquille O'Neal
These guys are awesome! Eat big to get big! Training is important but there are no real gains without proper diet. Thats where their strength comes from. I realized that after I started following my first meal plan. I found it online on site Next Level Diet. At first it was tough to eat an excessive amount of calories, but eventually I got used to it. Good diet is a game changer!
They look so sweet!
Man i loved the clip of them all sitting shirtless at the table
The cut to sitting at the breakfast table shirtless… classic 🤣
That is beautiful to watch🥺❤️
Bro when Thomas shook the big guys had for the first time at the beginning of the video the big dude just grabbed Thomas’s wrist lmao
Why does this video make me so happy
Every video entertain me 👏🏼💪
I just came off my nordic track treadmill right before watching this! I-Fit is amazing with a greta community i definitely recommend it! (I-Fit is the program used on the treadmill)
I love that every strongman is such a teddy bear at heart
This video had me grinning the whole time
I thought Brian Shaw was the strongest man?
Imagine if they have shrimp meat😂
These guys are truly awesome and excellent host. Thank you for sharing your experience.
Hlo bro welcom to nepal
they even sound like their inner organs are made of rocks
greatest misclick 💯
they sounded exactly how i expected , love these guys, god im proud to be a half scott
That deep voice though.. now i believe Thanos  is real.. 15:15 is sick!!!!
those sock prints are funny :-))
It's like the three looks like a biskits hehehe GOD BLESS GUYS YOU MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY
My GOD YOU GUYS ARE LOVELY GIANT♥️♥️♥️ YOURE VISITORS LOOK LIKE A STICK PLS DON'T GET MAD THEY LOOK LIKE GIANT FOR US
all I can hear is bass from those 2
MARCOS AND DUTERTE IS the stongest according to Clown’s I
Those 2 big strong teddy bears are kind and funny! This trip was fun!
They are so pure, thank you so much for this experience
Picture a fight in that house
This was beyond wholesome. To see these 2 giant men that most people would think would be angry, bitter and violent....Just being the most friendly, welcoming and loving brothers was such a powerful statement. We are all capable of enormous amounts of love that transcends, body issues, mental issues, size, weight, finanaces....ONCE AGAIN : anything is possible with love and family.
Seeing them all get so happy when they were lifting them heavy rock spheres was so so wholesome I had to rewind it back hahahaha  Edit: this whole video is so wholesomeee
the wim hof experience kicked in when going swimming
actually they are not healthy they suffer from obesity
Ohh god have mercy on their wives souls
Only strong men wear skirts

**Scottish Highlands or the Highlands of Scotland. Definitely not the Scotland Highlands.
this is something :)
The waist in end was optional😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Being small myself only standing at 153 cm, I would be so scared to stand next to them at first but then look at them. Their personality are so cute. They're like big labradors or golden retrievers with their bubbly, down to earth personality and strong physique. Wishing them more success and hopefully I could meet them somewhere in life if faith would let me 🧡
#FaithInHumanity

"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life." John 3:16 God loves you so much and showed that by sending His Son to die for us so that we may inherit eternal life. We deserve hell but He gave us heaven through faith in Jesus. He took the punishment we deserved and by putting our faith in Him we can be saved. The Key To Eternal Life: https://youtu.be/uZdv-TtiMkg God bless y’all!

Worlds most bulkiest men
Legends yet Humble
When lifting weights literally cures autism, fucking amazing, if only America and others would adopt the concept congrats Tom on overcoming all challenges in your life
They look like the most gentile, kind and frankly adorable giants ever. I imagine if they came charging me I would curl up and die, and I am by no means a small guy., but as soon as they smile .. come on who could be scared of them?  I wish them great success and more importantly, a LONG LIFE. Sad part is these type of guys never make it too long before their bodies give out.
Yes.. yess thiory... Thumbs up always for.you. shout out from Philippines full support
if anyone wants to gift me one of those treadmills... i'd really appreciate it lol
Yess
Being around them would make me look like a straight line from a pencil ________
Shingeki no kyojin
Gaint Hobbits! I adore these man haha meee with sweets... dang sweets that i love! Also their height ahhh I hate being short 5'3 sooo tall!!!
i feel like a treadmill sponsor isn't fit for a strongman video
Ay that was such a positive vibe

So funny
Love how many hugs they give 😂🤗
i love all your videos..hoping you will try to visit and feature PHILIPPINES
I always hear that eating is the worst thing for Strongmen and I'm wondering why there arent some "replacement" foods, aka liquids/powders with a higher calorie and nutrient density than "conventional" food?  This would save these people so much time daily and I can't really wrap my head around why there isn't some. (Of course it would be more expensive than conventional food, but I don't think it's more expensive than the lost time)
Is this what boys do at sleepovers?
First time i am not scared of giants
They seem like the most lovely guys
big fellas. good people. like 🙂👍
Definition of vikings
I love how these big boys are kind and supportive 😍
Idk how but this is the most masculine thing I’ve ever seen except its not toxic…like negative toxicity…truly amazing
When they were eating breakfast thomas looked like piper perri next to them 😂
heaven
This video is hilarious, yet beautiful
i got goosebumps specially with tom dang
Strongest man training  https://youtu.be/78JwCPd3uuQ
Dude imagine how scary they’d be if they did those slapping tournaments
What does the steroid abuse physically and mentally and how it effects the health and life of this strong man pros?
- "I'm 70 kilos" - "That's cute"
was für nice dudes :D
I love this video so much, they seem like such kind people !! keep up the amazing content
That 👍 war was hilarious 😂
What a great video. Made my day.
14:12 The way Stoltman brothers got so excited over him lifting that, so amazing haha. Two humble giants, hope they achieve a lot as professional strongmen. 💪
GREAT GUYS
Why they wearing skirts
Damn that guy is bloody strong for someone who hasn't trained

You guys remind me of me and my older brother. Expect for the size lol. You both seem so down to earth and genuinely all round great guys! Awesome video awesome brotherhood. Lots of love. Thanks to yes theory for doing this video!!

This was so much fun to watch! Loved the shirtless breakfast! 😂🙈 Genuinely nice guys doing “guy” things! Loved it! … also accents were terrific to listen to.
Don’t feel bad buddy you are big where it counts
I watched this video and an add of how to lift things came in the middle of the video

You're looking like a goblin among those giants 😂 #coc
omg great work
Where can I get one of these men 😉
Such an amazing video.  Extremely inspiring.  I haven't watched too many videos here on YT that have had me genuinely smiling the whole time.  The Stoltman brothers are awesome.
The final part were you do competitions is halarious especially the Hide and seek 🤣😂🤣🤣
The strongest men in the world wear 'skirts'  If that aint some badass shit idk what is
Sometimes you click on a random video on your for-you-page and find yourself wondering if you've seen that one guy before. The effects of buzzfeed are everlasting (hi eric)
I love this! So inspiring 😇
This video about strong men, is the sweetest video I’ve watched in a while. Thank you and well done!!!
Honey and haroon kids toys c
Loved every second of this video. ❤️
It’s 8 minutes before 12midnight where I’m at and I’m here watching this video like what? 10kcal a day?  I’m limited to eating 800cal a day 😭
This video was absolutely breathtaking! It was hype, exciting and emotional. I don't think I've ever seen a video that had me this captivated and involved, you could feel the energy in literally every scene and it was a powerful and loving one!  Yes Theory - This was an incredible video! Stoltman Brothers - You're my heroes!
I love the way they say breakfast
wholesome af
This was fun to watch.
thoughts aren't men. thoughts are GIANT BEARS!!!!!!
Why do I feel like I was expecting baki hanma type stuff
these guys are amazing
Why aren't they speaking in third person? We know they are from planet hulk!!
the humble giants. man, I wish more people can be like them.
the music at 3:05 took me millions miles away to the beautiful places in the world!
https://youtu.be/GZTf4Zsifcs
Guys you said nice never would be the biggest month of uploads in years but you never posted after this ?
It's always the biggest, strongest dudes that are the most genuinely kind. Every video I've seen of strongmen, they're just laid back, soft spoken and have kind words for everybody.
3:22 to 3:31 Well that's a friendly lad way to wake up and I wouldn't even mind being woke up at five by Luke he seems like such a chill guy with the way he says "mornin team" and everything
i was totally with ya guys when he lifted that stone. cool video
I had to pause at the Breakfast table scene " Last supper "  style. lmao . dude in the middle of the giants, I am dead with laughter. well done.
Would you do van life for a week?
Giant mythology is all over the Americas as well. British Caribbean giants are called moon gazers. Basically as tall as fully grown  coconut palm trees, slim lean and fast. According to myth they can rapidly close their legs to crush people and can't be outrun.
Im From Just north of alness where the stoltman brothers and i am so happy that they got this far and am happy that you came here!
gentle giants these dudes
i always wished to have a big bro to work out with or just hang out with in general
I become stronger by just watching this video! Thank you, great channel!!!
Teddy bear personalities
Have you tought about spending a day in a mine, as workers
I genuinly could not stop smiling the whole video what beautiful human beings wish them the the best of successes ❤
i cannot help but wonder, is this enjoyable for straight females in a special way?
No one ever picked up a big stone before scotland :) eygept made them pyramids hiring scottish people xD
This was such a heartwarming yet very sexy video 😍
That was an amazing video with you all!! ♥️  Much fun! Those brothers are real giants and their support for one another is truly heartwarming! I have been at a Strongman contest when it was held here in Stockholm and Magnus Samuelson was the strongest man in the world! I have seen all of the last years strongman competitions (on video) and I always cheer you on, I didn’t know about Toms disability and since I have the same disability I will cheer you on even harder from now on!!! 🇸🇪 Do you know what Stoltman means in Swedish? /Pernilla
this video was soo good
Glasgow has just moved to Oban people 😀👍
Just amazing fellas. So friendly and welcoming
I laughed soooo hard. This was amazing
I love the stoltman brothers! They are an inspiration. I followed Tom Stoltman's journey at the competition!
The strong men are great. Constanly making it clear how you are different is not needed. It became annoying to me, as it was obvious. If you would like to "Champion" the giants do it. If you pride yourself over your guests do it. The middle ground puppy play is weak.
So wholesome!
Seeing this just made me happy
this is so coool! the giants are enormously gentle and accommodating 🔥
Thank You guys for bringing pure happy smile on my face!
Real life giga-chads what the hell
Lifting a 100kg Stone Is really impressive guys, congratulations
this is so wholesome <3
they voice are like Optimus Prime, sound so deep. That was amazing, Storngman!
Amazing👏🏾
❤❤❤❤
yes theory forgot to upload vids
i love this video
The giants of old were the children of the Watchers and daughters of men.
Weakest man spends hours with two cro magnons
Not in size but in strength
They are literally giants
They are amazing ❤️
Come back to Scotland and spend the summer with me and my family as we celebrate the people that kept the english away from our towns and villages, we recreate what they did by riding horses round our towns borders
Mariusz Pudzianowski? To nawet nie jest on xd
imagine these guys on a medival battlefield in full armor, id just ran away lmao
The pronunciation of this video is very beautiful.
5 min in the video andI love those big dudes. Seems like a loving atmosphere
Their voice are more Giant than any 😁
no offense, i knew he was a little strange but autism, it just goes to show that something like that doesn’t put a label on you and can’t stop you from being “normal” he who he is and it’s fuking awesome
One of the best video(episode) I've watched. Hope you can visit davao. Philippines. God bless guys!
These two giants have thoroughly changed my perspective to look onto people's appearence. Its such an inspiration to see how the two of 'em are humble and extremely friendly. This is a great video. And fun one too.
Holy fuck i wish i had those genes, need that rna Gene manipulation to get more advanced Quick!
You guys are so humble and worm hearted .... Jesus
I love them both ..wish i can meet them in real life someday
Within 3 minutes of the introduction,, I had a beeming smile on my face, the brothers are so happy and warm hearted and the strength they have is amazing. Been watching their progress for a few years. !!
a lot of fun. thanks !
Where is the new video guys?it feels like something is missing from my life…please upload
This was so wholesome, I haven't smiled this much in a while. I stumbled upon the video by accident, and it has made my day :)
Anyone else hear his elbow crack in 18:26
Damn! Some cool ass dudes. So Rad. Great show!
Been a strongman fan my entire life, I've always said the strongmen are some of the greatest people in the world <3 You guys are awesome, thank you for sharing your life with the rest of us! I couldn't stop laughing you guys are too funny and I was screaming in my chair when he got the stone up on the table :D I'm a Stoltman Brothers fan for life!!!
18:30 sausage party begins, bunch of naked guys,
I have oughtism, I ought to exercise more often but.....
The one they didn't believe in was the strongest of them 😂🤣.
That 70kg guy is unreal, how can someone so skinny and with zero training do that?.. WTF.. if he dedicated his life to being a strongman he might amount to something really big..
Clash of clans
You should hang out with kyriakos grizzly
Great video but that's Oban, not Glasgow at 2:11, just saying...
17:32
Strongest, manliest men in the entire world: *recognize mental health and its disorders*  My dad: Stop crying and be a man
damnnn, it's so cool mann!!
They are so funny. And huge, dam.
As a Scotsman myself I am SO god damn proud of you two @StoltmanBrothers. Not on,y are you both beasts at your chosen sport, but they way you both are with people! You look like so much fun to hang out with, I wish I had friends like you Botha, Your hearts are as big as your muscles! Well done guys!
6:00 nearly killed me hahaha. what an experience
This was an awesome video. Thank you!
the yes team talking about they brought the weakest member over, and he (the weakest member) destroys them, HAAHAHAHHAHHA!!
I can't help but wonder if they lost weight with their voices get higher and why do they have to eat so much in order to lift things I can imagine the padding would help though
Can you have good genetics to be strong without much training? The guy seemed shocked at how much he could actually lift?
thanks for this vid !!! from germany i send love to all of you, very warming and sensitiv content. stay healthy and best wishes for the future 💪
Wow! What a video! So likeable :) Great job guys <3
bC naya video kab aayega?!
I had so much fun watching this. I couldn't stop laughing. The brothers seem like gentlemen.
What is it with the Nords and their consistent hold on the market of the strongest men in the world?
"That's cute innit?" had me weak🤣
how much do they eat?
Wholesome AF
his voice is deeper than a black hole
found my favourite youtube video
So giants really are friendly? Why did I fall in love multiple times watching this?
Gentle giant cutie ♥️
strongest man with the strongest voice
It’s is beautiful to see how these men who could crush your head with their bare hands are the most loving And genuine People out there
i feel like they could crush my skull like a grape with one hand 🤣
“The weakest man they could think of” proceeds to be weaker 😂
at least there was not an eating contest, loser gets eaten.
Oh the anger in feminist for all this “toxic masculinity”
whats this scottish song? @ 14:14
When Tom smiled at the dude after his bro said he was 400lbs
Allah is the best.
I love how they are so cuddly haha
Nice. But see when the word 'Glasgow' appears on-screen at 2:11? The town pictured is actually Oban, 90 miles north-west of Glasgow. There's a clue in the words painted on the side of the building below the 'S' in Glasgow.
Haha great video :D The voices of the brothers seems like the frequencies are tuned down :D
hide n seek was the best.
we need to make put them in a squid game challenge lol
love from pakistan strong brothers
Hey Yes Theory! I'm obese and I want to seek discomfort. So...I signed up for the Memphis half Ironman! Are you willing to join me and feel some discomfort while overcoming an incredible obstacle??!
The shirt off at the table shot is amazing.
I want to have the accent.
I will go in bed with them anytime!!!
Class, humble men

Hey... I show this and some of your video we found on Youtube to my friend, she has 1 son with autism.  She said thank you to keep chalenging yourself everyday because it's not an easy feat. Thanks for being such an inspiration.
These two in a bar fight would just be midget tossing.

Now, I want meself a strongman🫂
That looks like a ton of fun, I wish I was there! 😂
Love it! 😂
These guys are extremely likable
These guys are total sweethearts
A long time ago scotlans king died then asked edward the king of england who to pick he said john bailliol because he was a easily persuaded person and was not ready then led to the scottish wars of independance whic the scottish fought for their freedom and if this happened again it would way different just seeing two giants running at you with a sword and shield
ive also eaten 10,000 calories a day before lol, im 120lbs
Not disabled, but very strongly abled Man!
You have no idea how much 10k Calories is, I tried 5k for a while to grow in size and it was horrible.
Imagine a group of people with over seven million followers only putting out one video a month . Sounds crazy doesn’t it , but ladies and gents , I give you (Yes Theory).
thanks for uploading video , plz upload some more videos related giants
There’s too much manliness in this video
At  2:11 a picture of Oban is shown, with Glasgow up in big letters...
This video put one of the biggest, dumbest grins on my face I have ever had from a video. Great job representing Scotland and showing the incredible dedication and hard work you bring to the sport! If I ever get over to Scotland, I'd love to hoist a pint or a dram with you two!
Wowwww
STOLTMAN means proudman in swedish :)
they really are..the worlds strongest and friendliest person too
This is so wholesome, I love it!
*smiling* What a wonderful story.
Genuinely so entertaining
Their voices fit them so well
This was awesome. These guys are great beings of shining positivity.
Hey, you guys just got called out. 10 day train ride! Why not! Your lives are so busy scheduled and under the regimen lately. Can you boys just go back to being boys for a bit. Bring Darren along. Just do it because it’s so god Awfully uncomfortable. Use it like a jumpstart. That video will kill. Much love
I can imagine the early age artrites,  heart failure, cancer, etc.... oir body is not made to eat like that..
Damnnn, How r u guys not getting hemorrhoids ?
Did you guys check for hernia after this? 🤣🤣 Thats incredible!
I literally love this video so so much!!
When they lifted the stone I yelled and celebrated soooo loud bro 😭 I almost got an ass whoopin
The little drop sound broke me 🤣  4:11
Am just here for their voices🥰😍😍
Loved this video! Lmao
So cute
honestly they're not even that big. lol. why is this video a thing? question mark?
well its safe to say nikocado avocado is skinny
Awesome video and eric is strong
Man those two big guys are soo humble and soo genuine❤
Good dudes
Big motivation and inspiration. Lil man was strong 💪
Yes, do not put the bible background for giants, and just skip the absolute most iconic ideology that backs giants. Good video! Bozo🤡
Love those guys! Such great people and ambassadors of strength and fitness.
9:13 You know you've made it when you can tell someone who is world class at something "I am proud of you"
I really enjoyed this episode. I haven't laughed like this in a long time.
lol this was more entertaining than I thought
You can really see Tom's autism coming through in this doc, he is rather quiet and then he comes to the gym and bam he is alive. That is his passion. My brother is on the spectrum and this is exactly how he is but with car mechanics, it really gives them a special focus to succeed in their area of born passion that neurotypical people rarely have
even his voice is gigantic  🤣😭😭
God bless Tom with a healthy long life! 100 years of amazing health and happiness is what I wish upon you :)
God Bless the Stoltman Brothers with a long and healthy life! May they live for 100 years in amazing health and may they live a happy healthy long life. God bless.
Made me smile
💜💜💜
💜💜💜
This videos is just wholesome. Oh my god i'm loving this so much ❤️
Love from india for giant brothers  You are real superheros
I love the humour and mateship of all of you. I remember 50 years ago playing twister with females. It was thrilling to my brain chemicals.
That’s it I’m moving to Scotland 😂 no all jokes aside y’all are really cool 🤩
Gentle and inspiring. Coolest brother duo.
Damn those guys had a glow up
Those two should dress up as sasquatch and scare people in the forest
ZADDY THICCCCCC
Great video lads, I really enjoyed that. These two guys are proper role models. There is no end of high profile sports stars out there but to be able to do it and remain grounded and humble is what makes these brothers special. Some times I look at todays sports men and women and they just look completely miserable despite having achieved their goals in life. Thankfully these fellas have mastered the art of being a consummate professional whilst also not taking life to seriously 💪💪💪
If these guys hire movers to move their furniture, it would be like mozart taking music lessons.
They’ren’t Giants. They’ren’t Men. They’re Magni and Modi. Sons of TH0R! Though, Kratos is beyond them, lol.
oh my goodness, scottish people are amazing
PMSL at "The Scotland Highlands". It is "The Scottish Highlands". This video was great but not edited by someone from Scotland. The picture behind the word "Glasgow" is actually "Oban". Come on guys have a bit of care about your production's accuracy and for the Scottish people watching this. The boys live in Invergordon and not Inverness. I am just going to leave it there ...
What a fun video!  I really enjoyed it - the guys were just wonderful!  And you were a really good sport to participate
You guys are too cool, genuinely you radiate joy.  Happy people good times, thanks you made my day.
these guys look so fun to hang with
Wow love to see them and there very handsome
Luke needs to do voiceacting.
I spent a day with doomguy
so incredible...
A bullet from a 9mm. Makes any man the same size.  - Nicky Barns
Thank you for all the inspiration you guys give! since i found your channel a year ago ive changed the way i view life. Putting the Yes Theory way into perspective ive gotten a big promotion at work and will finally be able to travel the world! Im going to Rome in April this year and planning a trip to Nepal next year! Wouldnt be possible without you all!
You talk about giants being gods, or gods being giants. Well Tom and Luke are both giants, and gods. As silly as it may seem, I feel proud to be from the same planet, and extra lucky to be from the same extended country as these two iron men. This video was simply beautiful and I lived your experience vicariously, meeting such legends. You've immediately earned my subscription, just as Luke and Tom earned my devotion from the first time I saw them compete.
that was pretty hilarious and you know, when you watch the strongman competitions all of the competitors seem to be the nicest, most chill and humble dudes.  real inspirational heroes for sure
Did he say ten thousand calories a day ??
I laughed so much 😂😂
Like they are playing  with nephews around the yard 🤗🙏😅 super cool
My back hurts watching this
@Yes Theory do a video about Pan Am Flight 914
Who is here after Tom won the world strongest man competition and Luke Europe strongest man ??
I wish I could’ve gotten to workout and live with a strong man for a day I love lifting eating and being big
Eric has Russian genes, its in him!
One of the biggest smiles I had in my life was when I saw this video! Just Amazing
Could only afford a portion of sponsor WTF
I LOVE THE VIBES … i mean the vibe is just this whole video! Damn!
The Scottish name are the Mcglassan stanes, guid video lads.
Whose due first?
When you’re that huge, you HAVE to be kind or everyone will be terrified of you!🤣
This was such a great video... Thank you presenters
To me, thats the most beautiful shape a man could have.. its kind of sexy as it looks very masculine
This is so good!! Wish could spend some time with these brothers!! True inspiring.
this was just a cute, wholesome, lovely looking time and i love it.
Haha they even sound like giants!
okay but is tom single?
To much work
5:54 had me finished
aint no hand 2 hand combat with these jokers ... thats why i got my G34
I’m an adult with autism too, I had no idea someone like me was at Tom’s level. He’s inspiring
Good vibes, good content! loved it! all yall are awesome! had to subscribe after this one!
I think it’s such a great thing that these guys are so supportive to others and just generally kind men.
Damn they got big compared to them teen pics
🥚🥚erz👀 … whomever gets this gets a kiss 😘 I’m stoned
These guys are insane 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Anyone know the bagpipe music name??
They motivate one to go back into the gym
Looks like when your little cousins come over to play
Now this is a brotherhood.
Their voices they sound like giants lol
We need a strongman tour. I need this experience in my life.
Oh, just love this video ❤️❤️ Best from Linda in the North of Norway
i live in Invergordon, which is where their warehouse is, im so annoyed i didnt see them drive so close to where i live, i saw the stoltman brothers before when they were at my school, but i always wanted to meet Yes Theory!
Their voice OOOOOOO😆🔥
The thing I like about these kind of videos especially with people who compete in strongman competitions is hearing their life stories and and why they started doing their thing, but for some reason I can't explain, I find it really inspiring and motivating
This just made my day ♡♡♡♡
Idk how true it is, but i heard that people with autism have a better ability to reduce their "limiter" giving them godly strength. If that tracks, Tom will be unstoppable :O
not to be that person but the shot at 2:12 isn’t Glasgow… it’s Oban on the west coast… just saying
I would kill to have one brother like this let alone 2 =(
I’m going through a crazy time and idk why but this video made me feel tons better ♥️thank you for sharing 🙏🏾
I love this video there such amazing guys
I eat the much in a day too but not healthy and im not strong 🤣🤣🤣
These guys are fucking lovely. :D
Pretty sure that's not inverness 😂nae invergordon?
18:55 😂😂🙉
The voice tho 🤯🤯
such a beautiful video ♥️
The most bromance shit I’ve seen in my entire life 😂
Stoltman brothers are so likeable
I honestly wish I could like this video multiple times. Love the Stoltman brothers.
no offense, as a non-native English speaker.  Their voice is so deep and sexy that I cannot hear clearly
Nah guys, dont worry, the 40 yo fat ddue that used to play football outlifted them during highschool
They just ate their vegetables when mom wanted them to 🥰
I can't believe I just watched this. I needed this humor and humility. ha. Keep doing what you're doing. Those gents are super strong, but also seem like such great human beings!
I can't believe I missed you guys here in my home in Glasgow, Scotland. Though, it seems like you had tons of fun😄!
Stupid story how they can live before god? So who created this entire universe
this is what makes humans great.
When i saw the title i wanted to get salty and comment about the damage we produce to our planet with such a crazy meal style. But seeing these very nice human beings changed my mind and i ll better plant even more trees instead of saying or thinking anything negative about them. Thanks for this vid.
Love what you guys are Doing please can you guy do More in international countries residents
"you work out here? " that's probably the manliest thing I've... U jus work out where they build boats! "

Y'all look tiny next to those guys lol
14:25 seeing them hype is the best
white amazing men

15:08-15:21 Reminds me of Broly there
They literally sound like hulk
I'm giving them new nicknames: the HIGHLAND HERCULES, and the SCOTTISH SAMSON.  They can fight over which is which.
You gentlemen are awesome!
Talk about a feel good and inspiring story.
What's the name of the song at 3:10
you should go to nazare and visit the biggest waves in the world
5:48 hahah! Thanks for content
3:23 "Good morning, team." Even if these are gentle words, they could be absolutely terrifying when spoken by a giant
what genuine guys!
Lmfaooo @ him shivering to death like yeah there lives are super easy 🤣😭😭😭
these guys seem like such unpretentious and humble individuals. It's very inspiring to know men with such incredible assets are so humble and friendly.
Bro this video really puts it into perspective of how huge the Stoltman Brothers are! They are real giants 💪🏻
I enjoyed this video so much. Just pure happiness. Thankyou
Well done to Tom, the new world champ🏆

Bringing your autistic brother with you on a journey to become the strongest men in the world, that is some true heroism.
I would love to spend a day with giants.

Who ever said bara men don't exist in real life?

Imagine they both wearing Viking costume, would be soooo wholesome.
Great guys with a VERY humble interior. That can accomplish incredibly difficult exterior things.

Imagine these 2 brothers training for an MMA fight. They'd literally crush their opponents if they get a hold of them.
What do you think of that, Mr. Pajama-Wearing, Basket-Face, Slipper-Wielding, Clype-Dreep-Bachle, Gether-Uping-Blate-Maw, Bleathering, Gomeril, Jessie, Oaf-Looking, Stauner, Nyaff, Plookie, Shan, Milk-Drinking, Soy-Faced Shilpit, Mim-Moothed, Sniveling, Worm-Eyed, Hotten-Blaugh, Vile-Stoochie, Cally-Breek-Tattie?
I met them at a event
Один из титанов на видео недавно выбросился из окна
They arent the worlds strongest men. They just compete in WSM
this is awesome.
Big guys are always the nicest people i swear.
The more man live on the North and more big he is the more good and kind ♥
This is amazing 😂😂
my spine is crying watching this
Both seem like good blokes. Best wishes for your future competitions and training.
Dont you mean Invergordon not Inverness ?
Met them both. Great guys and yes fucking massive
like their awesome people but imagine back in the day of cold weapons, you're fucken 5ft tall (the average back then cause of malnutrition in england) you got a metal stick and these two come charging at you with battle axes as big as you lol... fuck that
Nice-!! Xd
This guy could probably fight asiatic black bear and win
These brothers are Da Bomb!! Love me some Strong Yes Men.
His voice is so deep 😳
Love the thumbnail. If you stood back another mile you could of made them look even bigger lol
I just love how they are so nice even though they are complete GIANTS. Loved the video. <3

Insane, they really are like real life vikings.
I am smiling so much my 29 and a half teeth showing..... Well done guys.
18:38 - That genuinely made me laugh out loud. 😂😂🤣🤣😂😂 This whole vid was so warmheartead and wholesome. As a man I feel like I grew another pair of balls after watching so much masculinity. It felt like afte playing Cratos game (God of War) game for 8 hours at least but this vid was better - coz it was real. I am proud of this big men, and I am soo happy for the guys who filmed it. Kudos and all the best in the new comming year. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

“Come here I'm going to eat you. I'm bigger than you I'm higher on the food chain. Get in MAH belly!”

Elsewhere, homeless people are starving.
Very accelerating, funny, n sweet n touching! Thanks everybody 😉👍👊

Great brothers. Brilliant for the sport. Nice people. Love to meet them one day.

Trully Amazing!
Nice vid 👌🏼

Caught myself smiling with this big wide grin on my face multiple times throughout this video which I don't do often, absolutely loved it!

MONSTERS! with hearts o' gold! GREAT VID! To the brothers, thanks for sharing! and all the best to you both!!   Merry Xmas!!
This was so wholesome😢😭
I hardly eat 2000 cal a day and I’m still gaining weight 😢.But they are eating 10,000 cal a day with all this delicious food that I  deprive  myself from not eating 😭
This is the manliest thing i've ever seen.      And i loved it.
Good content!
The voices give Kratos vibes for sure 😭

Nice video, Guys!
You never except the unexpected ending.. This is what a bunch of guys hanging out for a day should look like.. just pure stupid fun. And even the two strongest guys on the planet are doing it that makes it more fun to watch.
I love watching this! So fun to watch men be men for a while.
just boys being boys
recently became familiar with the stoltman brothers and have no idea who the other guys are but watching that skinny guy lift the atlas stone was inspiring lol
I feel bad for their wives legs.
How this man getting so strong
That voice is too deep
These guys are gentle giants.
Wtf their voice
Wow
Their voice is so deep that you can hear Adele rolling.
Great video guys 👍
Their arteries must be shot
Man, this took me back to high school. I didn't have much for friends. I kept mostly to myself and still do, but I used to have fun like this.  How do you find an income to support the things you love doing? I'd love to get back into martial arts, soccer, and downhill skiing in the winter. I was in Karate for a martial art, that combined with soccer put me in the best shape I had ever been in. Especially since I loved playing the midfield position, being able to cover the full field. I could help my team wherever I was needed. Soccer gave me endurance, Karate gave me everything else about being in shape (strength, flexibility, balance, agility). Karate actually made me a better soccer player, allowing me to be faster and more precise with even the smallest movements. Now I'm stuck with video games.  I don't know how anyone is supposed to make it to the full time position of 40 hours of work in a week. I only made it to 33 and... I just couldn't push any harder. I started to fall apart.  I don't know how anyone works two jobs, or even three. I don't know how people do college and university while working a job.  I feel like I am trapped in this apartment with my video games for the rest of my life.
You guys are so amazing every video I have seen which has been from the very beginning of your YouTube channel yes Theory you guys are amazing and you inspire me every single time I watch a video and makes me want to get up and go out and do whatever the hell I have to do! Thank you for what you do you are amazing I love you guys so much I will consider you guys my friend if you consider me yours
18:27 I heard a crack
The HIGHLANDS! Clan MacDonald's
Did you hear these voices?
the humbleness, the hospitality. What Legends.
It would be an honor and amazing experience to meet these two Brothers.  Kind, humble and just great men. Best wishes and good luck in your careers and life.
I'm a fan of  the Stoltman brothers competing. This was an awesome look behind the scenes. Thanks!
Those brothers impress me as two of the most wonderful chaps ever.  So good natured.  That breakfast would give me an other heart attack.
NOOOO YOU GUYS WERE IN GLASGOW WHILE I WAS THERE FOR COP26!!! I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED MY CHANCE TO RUN INTO YOU GUYS!! I love what you do and am aspiring to be a journalist that produces work and content that is similar to you. It's okay though, I know our paths will cross again! Maybe we'll meet in Egypt at COP27! 💙
man all these Scotland content hypes me after just watching the first two seasons of Outlander
i could take him
I fuckin love these two what a pair of legends... toms my favourite though sorry Luke haha
those guys showld be in movies
you know whats a bigger challange than eating that much? Understanding these 2 guys as an non-nativ speaker
They are going to die by the food, not the steroids. Their liver and kidneys are maxed out with that much food. Not good.
How amazing was that!! Brilliant
Hey everyone, I just wanted to say that Jesus loves you all so much, he gave his life up for you. He rose again from the dead on the third day. Turn to Jesus and trust him. Romans 10:9-11 says "9 If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. 11 As the Scriptures tell us, “Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.”"
Lovely chaps :)
For a good reason, a synonym of giant is 'ettin' (cognate with ON Jötunn), the one who eats a lot, basically.   Also, sick redemption arc for Eric.
"I'm not ready for the Wim Hof experience". *Has to go into icecold water.*  "Aw shit here we go again".
I don't know where you got the info on that intro, but it's absolute horseshit.
just 4 minutes in and it brings back memories of child hood martial arts training camp good run butt naked and then jumping into cold winter river
Beautiful human beings!
Bro I swear their voices are lower than my car engine rumble.
Que ganitas de que me peguen una ñapi
i feel so hyped for eric thats epic dude! f*cking good job!
Luke speaks like his voice comes from deep within some ancient cave or something.

Japan would like you to think that dudes like this are unappealing to women.  For some reason.  I don't know.  They're weird over there.
a golden time.. must be so much fun!
Jesus looks tiny, seating next to Judah and Peter.

Why at 2:11 do you have an overhead shot of Oban with Glasgow in big yellow letters over it? Couldn't you find a shot of the biggest city in Scotland? 😂
6:00 it's like a trio of Imperial Guardsmen having a meal with two Astartes Warriors XD
This is hands down my all time fave video from this channel! Tom's story is just so pure and inspirational!
Bro you spent a day with Magni and Modi HOLY SHIT
Exercise and pushing your body to the limits it’s the ultimate medicine
Can something be more scottish than this ?
Such a beautiful experience, guys. I almost cry at the end. YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE.
This is how marvel’s kingpin should look like.
Un dia cualquiera para un albañil mexicano, solo que sobrio
This was so wholesome
Loved it
Интересное видео  from Russia with love
These brothers are awesome! So wholesome!
Galatians 6:3  For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. Your just a man and nothing more! Now, use your talents to serve God and not yourselves.
Truly inspiring and wholesome video!
Why aren’t they with Robert, Brian, Nick, and Eddie?
It's amazing what testosterone can do to a man, what's fascinating is that if the more guys there are in a group the more testosterone you produce. Steroids isn't a thing you need, a month with the boys, working out and just being yourself will get you jacked. . . . Cause bromode.
Here in the Basque Country we have stone lifters called Harrijasotzaile who are quite famous and earn a lot of money in competitions similar to the Scotch ones ☺️
This was super enjoyable and funny.
5:46😂
Somehow, this video moved me. The affection and care that the older brother always had with the youngest, and let's not ignore the fact that he gave up some things in his life so he could give all the support. They are kind, sensitive, and know the meaning of the word brotherhood.
Actual giants from clash of clans
would be more interesting for me what girls are into these guys and live with them (if there are any but saw one in the background) cause you would think either a very small woman who needs protection or a very stocky and more fat and rough woman but the woman in the background looked surprisingly average - maybe their sister?
Dawwwwwdinnnndaaaaaaaaadooooooooi
The strongman community is honestly one of the most wholesome strength communities. Hangin out with Martins would be a fun time too
I felt like I was appart of this omg love it
I'll see you in my dreams Luke! Wow! What a man! <3
Great video
This is going to sound weird, but this video, was amazing and hit me hard. Seeing two big lads just being so happy and chilled and living life, like jumping in the bed to wake ya up..and his face when he talks about how big he is... Like big kids.. Dont think I could convey how important this was to me. Bloody brilliant.
This video cures my anxiety. Thank you all guys
Red Caucasian people  Vs Thin long-nose Wite DNA people
Sei que nao entenderam o que escrevi, mas, achei muito legal essa reportagem sobre o cotidiano desses gigantes. Mesmo sendo tal grandes são simples e nada arrogantes. Parabéns. Pela história de vocês.👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
It got deep at the end , love the Stoltman brothers and there relationship
i was smiling throughout the whole video.  these two beast guys are so really amazing and welcoming. but im confused how eric really did all the tasks?
When you see strongman next to each other, u tend to forget what monsters they are compared to normal humans
Scotland is the dream ❤️🔥
Это просто шикарное видео, заряженное тестостероном и позитивом
They did him so dirty with that sound effect 4:10
The stoltman brothers are awesome! My Celtic brothers. cracking content butty!
Gg man
as a scot- its the scottish highlands not scotland highlands
THESE VIBES GOT ME SMILING THROUGH THE WHOLE VIDEO
their voice is like 96% bass.
does anyone know why their voices change like that? Is it because they actually lift so much fkn weight?
Eric going GOD mood
Imagine being a  medieval peasant, conscripted to the army without proper armour,  Goes to battle and meet this giants.. 😭😭😭
This is so amazing, I totally love every second of it!
Do they know that the town they put the title card for Glasgow over is Oban?
1 of the best videos I've seen in a long time, 2 of the nicest guys you could ever want to meet. :)
Him: I'm 70 kilos Stoltman Bro: "That's cute ain't it" They seem fun to hang out 😄😆
They have a nice sixpack!
such a wholesome video.. nicest people ever seen 👌
That was real fun
they look like sticks compared to the Stoltman brothers
Respect..................
0:05 ... and yet the sock marks have power over world's strongest men. :D
What a  great hospitality you all got from these gentle giants. What a great personality these giants have. I need to visit Scotland now.
so um, are they single?
they really like going to the gam
Thumbnail reminding me of so pornos I’d rather forget.
Giants will destoy man, when the nephilim return
Just guys being dudes, ya love to see it
Reminds me of the One Piece episode when the crew goes to that island with the two giants
I loved how their first hugs was so awkward but then towards the end their hugs were so wholesome 🤗
The brothers seem to be really nice guys.
wheres eddie?
thomas: "eggercise"
Damn. Freaking giants. Why can no one do what Pual Anderson did?
So the NordicTrack is provided to the strongman so they can carry it up a mountain?
I live just up from that beach !!!!
So crazy that there from my home village
OMG toxic masculinity! It makes my mangina hurt!
This is awesome...#purehearts
My guy I don't need that much history 😭They just eat and exercise and be healthy that's how they big
Those guys are cool
Kinda amazing really. Due to several problems I've had since birth I never got into... 'being strong'. I was a shrimp, always have been. Got bullied a lot, diagnosed quite late (2018) with autism, and im still a shrimp. Due to corona times my already quite sedentary lifestyle got even more sedentary... But Im biding my time till I can go work out again. It somehow always seems to help clear the mind some and not worry too much. Doubt Ill ever get to be like the Stoltman Brothers though xD
The first strongmen competition is NOT the higland games wtf?^.-...its the Olympic games. It changed into something bigger NOW. BUt it was initially EXACTLY what think of a strong men competition . Only MORE...BETTER..and BIGGER. Then it became a battleground for nations before ww2 and the cold war...so obviously it was changed by that. But in the end it still remains THE ONE initial strong man competition. Period. In old greek times wrestling and bolder pushing and and and where some of the main events of the competition  this all inclusive all sportive events thing it is now that's not the Olympic games really...
i cant even go in the water when its summer because its too cold.....
Girlfriend: He must be cheating on me... Boys: 100kg.. u can do it... CMON! CMON! YEAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!
never thougt I was going to cry seen two strong big dudes. this is a beautiful video. saved on my fav list ..
I loved how genuinely excited they were for Eric successfully lifting the 100kg stone
Not just a uplifting story: a weightlifting story.
bro i know that i eat 4 french toasts for breakfast but thats insane
Nigga lamp if you know you know.
Lol t urns out he wasnt the weakest but by far the steongest
Lol they also sounds like giamts
This is the most wholesome video I've ever watched. I love it soo much! <3 Stay friends
These dudes need to be hired to play Spartans in the Halo TV show lol
I loved this video and its amazing what humans can achieve However                    I would have farted trying to lift that 220lbs ball. 😩😩
Dude’s voice sounds like a filter haha
I didnt see any warmup
when a strong man asks "how are you so strong?"  that has to be a good feeling. proud of you mate, mind over matter!
This is by far my favorite Yes Theory video. What wonderful people
is that Ryan Gosling?
5.57 ahaha
dude your a shrimp lol
THEIR VOICES IS BADDLY MODIFFIED
Man, they feel so friendly, cool and humble!
why is this so wholesome ?
thanks so much for this video, it really made my day. Or better say more than just a day 💜
Seem like genuinely good guys loved watching the bunch have just so much fun together
so giants are always gentle.
I would love to meet these giants😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This brothers are so Positive and so enthusiastic 😁👍 love them and love the crew as well

just guys being dudes
lmao i love these guys
I immediatelly saw who's the vegan there
Man Tom I feel you man I feel you. From now on you're my hero.
omg tom is so beautiful and lovely i wish i could hug him just once uwu
I am a short man and my cousin brother is sort of a giant man for me, they way they were hugging each other in the beach and on the jumping on bed i know how great it felt to hug a giant it reminded me of my brother  And i am feeling way warm Thanks yes Theory
There far from being the strongest man lol
Oh I loved this video. Absolutely brilliant. I smiled all the way through it. I love these guys, they are part of my fellow Celtic family. Well done guys. 👍🏼💖😊
This is so inspiring! I wish I could meet these brothers! They look so massive yet they seemed sweet. <3 More power and more strengths to both of you! Hello from Philippines!
Their reactions are legit ass hell lol
i love this video so much
17:45 kind of gay
so wholesom :D
I wonder what they would look like if they had liposuction
😂😂😂 As a first time viewer because it popped onto my home page, clicking on on it was worth it! This was so awesome and wholesome to watch❤
https://youtube.com/channel/UCMnyQiRgeGtncdvonzNrdgQ
They're so nice. It's amazing to see men who appear intimidating actually be very kind
This was a amazing video, im huge a fan of the stoltman brothers and has been a honor to watch their journey 😊😊♥️♥️
Awesome video 😅
Wow, I’m really impressed.... it really feels as these guys and their seizes come from another planet...  thanks God he gave them a strong mind and heart, too 💪
Truely blessed by the Gods
giants, strong and... fat (???)
The loveliest giants in the world.
Omfg this is amazing
When your voice actually match to your size.
LMAO!!🤣
At 2:12 you show a drone video of Oban but you put Glasgow as the title. I immediate recognised it from the small colosseum like building in the back. 56°24'53.0"N 5°28'22.3"W these are the coordinates of the drone view in google maps.
😂
Tuning space marines
Hahaha love these men
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life3
Inspiring
遺伝子が凄すぎるw
He has Russian blood. Of course he can lift.
These dudes are more masculine  then an entire country with those heavy voices .
the greatest compliment of strenght ever must be a strongman looking at you going "How are you so strong?"
Great craic 👍👍
Skeletons army will destroy them
Thank you for this video! It gave me such a big smile! The Stoltman Brothers look like genuine humble guys :D
jake paul  and logan paul if they were actually strong
11:20 welp. After this, not the weakest anymore and then they'll eat their heart out lol
5:01 that's a hellot of protein for breakfast!
JEEEEZZZZZAAZZZZZ......OMFFGG!!!! HE HAD AUTISM!!????? WTFFF!!!!.......WHATS GOIN ON!!!!!??????
Men being men bringing me to tears
the end was so dorky  but for some reason i was LMAOING
They look like just pop out from the myth.
A round for Eric!!!
It actually feel really good after. Cold as fuck for the first few seconds
True definition of Friendly Giants
Thumbnail needs a Brazzers logo.
I find the correlation between strong men & kindness to be one of humanities hopeful attributes.
but now seriously, i'm a very skinny 14 year old who never really liked to do exercises, but I'm really inspired by those two now and I want to be strong like them, I'm a fan now
me and the boys hangin' out:
Was that Olives 🫒 for breakfast?!? Gotta know.
This guys are inspiring💪🥺
oh my god its the philistines
Can I join please? I am a skinny guy for 25 yo
they sound like transformers lol
Hey man, I have autism too and thank you for being such an inspiration.
THEY EVEN SOUND HOW THE GIANTS WOULD 😭😭
The Brothers eat 6 times a day? Second AND third breakfast. Biggest hobbits EVER!
Mans talkin bout autism like its mental retardation
Anyone who injects tons of steroids could be like them, they are not giants
These guys are impractical to keep. Taking too much space and eating a ton.
Youtube gotta pay yall more - these ADs [i have the PRM plan] are ridiculous
Excelente video.... Excelente energía desde Medellin, Colombia...
we are fucking shooting
Respect !!!! they are so kind and cool
they are really amazing partners to train I guess!
Strongest Men in the World & Nicest Men in the World.
new, history, inspiration, fun, genuine ; Stoltman Brothers
Every time they sit in a car, the fuel economy loses 10mpg.
they need to make a "ROWER" with the built-in video tech like the nordic track!
You hurt yourself? Hope you gett well soon.
that man sounds like a straight pipe diesel v8 and probably has the torque of one too
Di$$cömFnöRD is chaö ling ice äh phvnn v  v  skötti nrj spöck vidjäh ? ? ?
WAIT NO WAY I LIVE IN INVERNESS
you guys just earned yourself a sub :o thanks for the heartwarming content
😆
Pudzian jest silniejszy
This is the best video I’ve watched for a long time. This is how you should live your life, with happiness and pure love and enjoyment
i.. i feel weird watching this
Don't forget that they use a lot of steroids to be like this. It's not the same steroids than bodybuilders (they are more fat) but they use a looooooot of roids too.   They are not born like this. They are not "natural giants" even if they are cool or nice. Don't forget it guys.
Those giants were over 60feet tall. But still WSM is a tough thing to do. They work hard achieving remarkable sports. I liked this video yes!!!!👍🎄
Luke and Tom seem great!
ok just checking, you are the dude in the middle ?
they seem like the nicest guys ever
this thing won my heart "respect weight" 9:53 lol
Amazing just amazing..!!!
My mans are straight up adeptus astartes
best and funniest thing i have seen in a while <3
Imagine them being bouncers
SSSQQUUUIIIIZZZ IT RRRRR YOUR HEEEPZZ
Loved to see logan and jake paul. keep up the good work
''we brought the weakest man we could think of ugh'' *beats them both*

How am I supposed to watch this if I'm gay?
Plot twist: the smelling salts was just meth
You guys seems like two big burger and three sweet stick. 😂😂😂
I clicked on the video to fastforward through it and get some impressions.   But no. I've watched the whole thing and smiled all the way! :)
their vocal chords have gotten a workout too now thats a strongman
Buddy you have to visit a Poland to see a real strongman
You little pixies are so cute next to real men
Those beast are just massive humans.
Great guys,God bless You!
Humankind: Terminators doesn't exists Those guys: ahem...
Those Giants were actually nation or a clan name " Quom-e-Haad ". They were known for their size and brute strength. They could smash mountains and pick up giant trees like we pick up weed from the garden. But their "Pride" was their downfall. Pride Hath a fall... Eventually it annihilated them complete from the face of the earth. Allah sent an angel , the angel screamed and blew their ears and brains. The whole clan was no more. Just imagine if they were still alive. We would've had giants among us. And "war"
Real life Vikings
Wow! Awesome brothers!
OMG !! Thets So amaizing - God Blees you guys Thats so nice The Strongest mans and they show you they life witchone is not the esy how ppl is thinking !!  Enjoind watching this laft and wos so Hapy there is moments like this !! You meak my Day so mor better !! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Arroz y pollo

The ultimate karma for thining that friend was the weakest and turned out to be the strongest. May he live out his days more confident and find even more strength. What a lad.
💙
zz top la granje
This made me cry. My son has autism, we have Scottish heritage too. Thank you.
Real life Men !
14:13 ive never screamed so loud in celebration watching a video at 05:14 in the morning!!!
Genuinely Two of the nicest guy in the sport..love these guys..
Worse still, they gat no kids..
Born the last few centuries, these guys would be the most fearsome warrior and the trump cards of Kings and rulers. Amazing athletes
Great stuff, man! It feels like their heart is as big as they are!
Eric's redemption arc was the highlight of the vid
they remind me of the giants in Clash Royale...I mean, wtf...just look at the size of their arms...
Where is the tug of war??? Great video
Lots of hugs and fist bump...I really need now to travel to Scotland and plunge in the frigid ocean water with my friends...
my testosterone levels after watching this video have gone through the roof. love y'all
Thats not Glasgow at 2:14, thats Oban
4:01 Your welcome ;)
U got me smiling all along :) awesome ppl and awesome vid
massive respect to the strongmen in the movie years of dedication to achieve these bodies job well done bravo
jeeez that guy sounds like testosterone himself haha. the scottish accent only adds to it
Never understood why they say eating is the hardest thing? Im 6’4” and 19 stone (lean not fat) i train 3/4 times a week and dont even really consider my diet, i just eat whatever when im hungry. I could easily increase it 20% and walk around at 23 stone. I dont eat until 10am and its oats and raisins every day. Lunch is a sandwich and dinner varies. Maybe they should take less emphasis of the diet thing??
Ya need to visit eddie hall
One of the gayest videos I've watched recently
Real brotherhood. Salute
Clash of clans giant dude
Plot twist - Eric is as strong as the Giant brothers, But his brain never lets him use his 100%👍
The Giant Brothers knows the real meaning of power...
Beautiful video :-) Thank you!
Gentle giant ssss😃
Tom you are an international hero. Both you brothers are a shinning example of what is possible for humanity. I’m talking the humanitarian aspects over above the supreme athletic achievements.
Beautiful men
Haha bloody good show. I have thoroughly enjoyed this!  I am a strongman fan and a HUGE fan of these two brothers. Just awesome guys.     I’m new to your channel and will now keep watching. I have varied interests so we might be a good fit.
I wanna see these guys in movies! they're great!
Was I the only one with weird Fanta ads 😂…
I like me a big boy!
i think this is my absolute favourite episode tghe entire episode i had a huge smile on my face this is just awsome <3
These guys seriously seem like the nicest guys on the planet!
It's very motivating being a scrawny motherfucker struggling to eat a lot in my bulking regime hear these guys say that eating is the hardest part, though wtf are 10k calories thats crazy.
Their biggest muscle is the heart
I want to see them crush a baseball or pitch 150 mph
Friendly giants! Love them
Giants in figure and also giants at heart
they are kind though
It is so nice when you see supporting parents :)
Im in love 😍
Awesome video, their daily training routine is insane but cool. They seem so sweet and funny and I’m so happy for all they have accomplished. On another note I’d literally look like a toothpick next to these guys lol.
I wonder how many absolute warrior gods of old had autism and just trained like madmen.  I don't think they were seen as disabled in those times for being typically reserved and occasionally going a bit nutty.
how can i get their body's
When he said "I'm hungry," I got nervous. Like... is he planning to eat the whole car full?
Now I wanna go to gym…
I wish I could see Kyriakos Grizzly lift and then feast with these guys
I invite the Stoltman brothers to Guatemala. We invite you to live side by side with our sugar cane cutters - for 40 days, you shall eat what the local people eat, and work as the local people do. We just want to see how strong your will power is! Bienvenidos!
Does anyone know where i can get the sweater at 09:57 ?
This thumbnail is hardcore clickbait
Scotland was not conquered by the Romans. I wonder why? Lol
Huah!
How much money did LINUS SPEND ON THIS AD
Hey man great video! I don't want to be too negative but the GLASGOW title at the beginning has the town of Oban behind it. Just FYI.
Giants and lovely
Астартес провели день с имперской гвардией получается.
Those brothers seem genuinely cool.  You got a sub.
you kinda have to be rich to be the strongest man as well, i'm already struggling to buy food a month just for my slow  calorie intake and these guys have so much food its insane
Strongest men and the nicest of all, God bless u
These guys are amazing!!!!! That's how all brothers should be....Love from India
what's better than this? guys being dudes
good thing you guys didnt try to fight him thinking he was weak lmao. one hit sleep yall.
When they celebrated his stone lift that was the most wholesome thing Ive seen all day. The Stoltman brothers come across as some of the most down to earth strongmen out there, much love to the brothers
Damn how much elixer did they cost
Kul Tirans are real. xd
18:25 you hear the CRACK? xD
good video
World's strongest men? They've obviously never seen Lasha Talakhadze, Levan Saginashvili & Konstantine Janashia.
lol what a joke ! sea always hot in the morning :D any way nice acting
Where is the Pudzianowski
such wholesome fellows
Brilliant people, very nice video!
you should hang with eddie hall and brian shaw next
lasha talakhadze is strongest men in the world
Glesga...
So this is how would Kingpin look like in real life.

Damn they r HUMAN😂
4:50 he exudes confidence, nice and gentle giant
His voice is terrifying
6:00 "Enjoy"
I never had so much fun watching a video in a long time man! every single one of you guys are so sympathetic holy moly :D
Women: "Harry Styles is the perfect man" Men: "Look at those damn vikings hnnnggg"
Those guys are so wicked, such chill dudes.
Damn was great video!!!
Even the manliest and strongest of men wear skirts
Wait.... Why would God bless them with good physique and voice at the same time... Stunned 😱 Stay great👍
Come and hang out with us in Canada❤
This so wholesome ❤️
love it
they are humble, frendly, and gentle strong man,,  🙌🙌
Shouldve did a scratch your back challenge...Awesome video amazing strength 🏅
had a smile the whole time watching. Beautiful story.
I didn't think I'd enjoy this but that montage was SO fun
Did they just give these guys poppers?! The fuck?!
All I can hear when they talk is the Scottish Swordsman from Samurai Jack.
Imagine having fight in school with bully and these guys are your brothers
5:16 "smoked sommun" "sosegez" "ponkaeks" "stroburies" "blooburies" cookies "and donats"
I’m the planets strongest man. That is when I walk into planet fitness of course
quick question, where do i get a sample of their sperm juice. It is for my wife.
They need to lose weight
I'm so happy this brought me tears and im not a man that cries easily cant let you the last time I cried.
How many chinups can they do? How fast can they run?  We all have our attributes. Bless them for being such nice guys!
Hahah, his face when he got the stone up on the platform, HAHA!!
This is great. Thanks for the video!
U now whats better than a pc for 5 thousand dollars?? A pc that 5000 dollars that cost 0 money
Love these goofy sequences
Hmm, so they like to have both high fat and muscle mass.
The best sausagefest I've ever seen!
I like how they have their names tattooed on their chests like work name tags.
They would be amazing Vikings.
They’re such great guys, love tom
The last 4 minutes were golden. Wow
I looooove it
The Stoltman Brothers are just the most genuinely nicest people I've ever seen. Great sense of humor and very welcoming despite their appearance. Gentle giants for sure.
Eric is a BEAST !!! 👍👍👍
their voice is also strong
The stoltmam bros inspired me so much to get to the gym
This aged extremely well 👍
This two strong men created by allah don’t say gains were excited before god arrived .allah is one who created this world and what is on it .....
My cat's name is Kushi and he has it as a tattoo on his chest! I need a poster :-)
So much positive energy from all the guys! Cool to see!
Well what a good video
very good videooo!!  Support from Italy!
epic
They are so nice... Cause there is no need in the world for them to be rude... No one is stupid enough to disagreee with them...
The funnest video I've ever seen on you tube
One day from ancient Greece
I could beat them. With an ak 47 and a fragmentation granade
Humble giants.
you should do a colab with livingbobby
They’re adorable 🥰🥰
This is the wholesome sh*t I've ever seen! Made my whole week! 🖤🖤🖤
I wonder who could win in a fight the world's strongest man or worlds best fighter
There is only one the strongest man alive and his name is Mariusz Pudzianowski
smiled thru all of this, great dudes
yes theory i love you guys so much you genuinly make life so so much better. you guys make me so happy and have compleetly changed my outlook on life
These super Humans are really super cool.
*juices*
This is a new school of Scotish Gachimuchi
gentle giant !!
Stotlman brothers are true definition of gentle giants.
Class gents
Why are huge people so gentle?
This is such a lovely heartwarming videos, genuine chemistry between you all x
glad to see twa fella scotsmen holding the titles for strongest men , and taking the titles back to where it all started. These two men are a reminder of how strong we can be and we should look to them for strength and inspiriation.
where Pudzian?
do you like mushrooms ? lool
In wrestle this two giant will lose
The real definition of gentle giants💪🏼👏
I'm so small. Bet that when I stand beside them I look like a freakin toothpick compared to them.
DONT TAKE THE JAB!!!!
Giants outside and beautiful souls inside🙏
So wholesome ^^
Bros being bros and working out.  Awesome video
they talk so much like optimum prime from transformers!! 🤣😅
Two fantastic humans. Two brothers who really love each other. Fantastic video
"The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones"
the best two brothers
Man, I'm rollin - this was hilarious and just awesome. Thanks for producing this.
So much bro energy in this video.
his voice is deeper than the marina trench
Weird. Dont see a biological woman competing.
What a great video!  Although I am currently in the US, a part of my heart remains in Scotland.  I loved watching the day to day activities with these amazing men! 💙🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🤍
that look when he says," Tom's 400 + pounds" was priceless
Now imagine them as zombies chasing you  and they catch hold of you
girls like: i swear his cheating on me
18:26. That sound was terrifying!
Eric Tabach left Youtube to be on Youtube.
i like how they are very chill
Now I want to watch a fantasy movie with Vikings after watching this video for some reason
Just a small thing, its either "the Scottish Highlands" or "the Highlands of Scotland", not the "Scotland Highlands". I'm from the north of Sutherland, in the Scottish Highlands. Good video.
This nearly made me cry damn 🥺
That was a really really cool and fun video to watch! Thanks to all of you :)
Man just drop a inferno tower duh 🙄
nowadays we have guns...the end
lampshade at the end got me dying
Anyone can become them you just got to have alot of money for food, a strong a sense of determination and patience. My problem is money welp
They are like the Ant n Dec of the strongman world
First time watching. Great video.
Oh, Inverness. I've been there, such an amazing place.
These guys are way stronger that The Rock! That’s perspective.
5:36 this guy looks so thiney between thos skyscrapers 😂😂
What a lovely film. A great, sweet, unpretentious human story full of likable people. Well done lads.
So proud of these brothers ♥️
18:26 I thought I heard a crack. Love this episode, you all were amazing.
Now you have to get the Stoltman Brothers to come and see what it takes to be YesTheory for 24hours
i think Scottish people and Finnish people have alot in common =D
why have strong mens always so deep voices
10:46 wahts that? `smelling salts`
they cost 12 elixir
We are very proud of the stoltman brothers in the UK thanks for sharing and good luck for the future for the Stoltmans.
omh he thick 🥰

My family's House there Has been Destroyed by the typhoon also . please help extend your blessing , Even Donating used Clothes was A Very big help .
10,000 CALORIES A DAY, WHAT THE FUCK
Really inspiring stuff; not only strong, but clearly kind and down to earth. Wish the brothers and you guys the best in your future endeavours
That was great! Eating 10000 caories a day must indeed be a challenge, for keeping it interesting, if nothing else. Sidenote to that, is that the American explorers Lewis and Clark apparantly needed 9000 calories a day, though I reckon that didn't happen very consistantly, as they couldn't carry that much food along. These big boys are so cool, I'd love to see one of these competitions.
this is Bro-mantic.
Man you guys are cool!  That was a fun video!
Love and respect from India
Wow. 🤩
Gotta love these two!
Gotta love these two!
What the heck dude, they just look like miniature Hulks.
Those two guys are an inspiration, not just for working out, but on how to decide, and then go after something in life. That's fulfillment.
Brilliant video
I had a good chuckle watching this.
Regular exercise really pays off, and you can find it in the most unlikely places, tho mine was mostly work related, between 8 and 20 i did a paperround each morning, essentially biking for an hour each day with a loaded heavy bike, which meant that 16yo 54kg me could legpress 168kg, now i work in a window factory, routinely hauling around carts that weigh close to 3 tons, still bike to work every day and can lift about twice my bodyweight ^^
Eating breakfast looks like the crew are desert. Like 3 pieces of spaghetti at the table.
never thought jake paul and logan paul would end up like this.
fuck, that hide and seek got me laughing so hard!!
what a amazing group of gentleman! Awesome vid! the clip of you guys eating breakfast bare chested is priceless lol
Deca
what lovely video and an awesome bunch of brothers. I wish them all the best
they thought they picked the weakest
Morning in the chill water? I literally felt that. We use to do it in Army training but under compulsion. Lots of Love to those tow gaints from Bhutan.
No words. Just press F. 💐
the best <3
love this but when you put the words on screen at the start saying glasgow that's actually oban about 3 to 4 hour drive north
Just the amount of bass in their voices should tell you how powerful these guys are
World's strongest Men don't live to pension age, A bit sad
Shirts off, for eating must be an American thing.
They are Scottish American?
what a wholesome video <3
These dude are awesome.
imagine if they were to become bodybuilders. The cut would be amazing 🤯
There’s so much testosterone in this video that my phone got pregnant.
They remind me Amon Amarth
gayyy🤣
Strong voices. Strong huge bodies. Strong men. 💪🏻 💪🏻
How was that string bean lifting some of those things ??!!??!?!???!??!!!!!!!!!
You guys make the greatest videos
Damn even their voices sound strong. Wouldn’t wanna get in a fight with those 2
Shingeki no Kyojin huh!
Anyone else hear the loud pop during the arm wrestle? Lol I was worried he snapped his arm
How big are their poops?
I am from Turkey and I liked your video. so cute giant I ever met :)
literally Gentle Giants!
They are so muscular that even their vocal cords have biceps.
Very interesting and funny video!!!!
The guy on the left missed the toast 6:02
They're so nice tho
This video is just so wholesome. Pure love to the thing they do, and just good good vibes. Made my week, if not a whole month!
AMAZING video. So much fun and happiness and brotherhood in one video. Today was a no-bones day for me, but this video makes it so much better, sub'd for sure.
Gob bless you all ❤️❤️ love from India 🇮🇳
imagine if they fight
it's against this kind of person that we invented the 9mm I'm really not kidding 😂😂
The stoltman brothers bring so much to the sport of strongman!
Did they just lift freaking 475kg wtf?
5:47 “I’m the top all the time”
Sons of fallin angel
such great guys! inspiration to us all
This looks like y'all just had a great time with some great people. This whole thing put a huge smile on my face :D
That's Oban, though, not Glasgow
Salute
Well yup Thorkell true!
Honestly wouldn't be a Scottish experience without someone with a lampshade on their head.
Pure wholesomeness
Eric is lowkey a strongman in training. That atlas stone form was pretty solid
Ололо, подумал, что это Сарычев
Imagine both of them being announcers
Very inspiring, Thankyou so much.
2:37 dude on left eyes are going different ways
Me like!
GIANT LIKE DUDES! :D I loved this! You are great!
Some of the best content on youtube
Russian power
"I hope I'm the real superhero, y'know?" You are man, you are. That is the best quote ever.
gentle giants
Basta de habladurías. Vamonos a lo que venimos  chingao.
I WOULD DREAM TO EAT WITH THEM!! FOR GAINSSSSSSSSSSSSS
20:27 damn that shot is like GODs from God of War game. Those 2 brothers are them.
God loves you 🌍 We’ve all broken the Ten Commandments, which is called sin. Sin is the disobedience to God, and sin leads to death and hell. Romans 6:23 “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”. There’s good news, friend! God, in His rich mercy❤️sent His Son Jesus Christ down to the earth. Jesus lived a perfect and sinless life. Jesus died on the cross for our sin so we could be forgiven! Death couldn’t hold Jesus, because three days after He died, He rose again! Friend, put your faith in Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you will have everlasting life in heaven your after life on earth is over! God commands us to turn away from our sinful ways (repent) and to trust in Him😁Jesus says in John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”🌎Trust in Jesus, and repent! May God open your heart to Him, and may He bless you richly❤️
Maybe the best video I’ve seen this year. Just awesome.
such a good vid
First video I’ve seen of you guys and really loved it! Thanks for the effort.
I’m Indian and think euros need to explore and respect their culture, highly under appreciated.
I have to say that your product placement/paid advertising is seamless. Love the content...new sub...check
The silly part at the end was the best
these guys take a lot of shits.
They left their balls there 😅
6:01 BESTpart of the video haha omg
So the Highlander from "For Honor" really exists, haha! I'm ready to see some caber tosses from those giants in the future! :D
SCOTLAND
2:11 ..Oban!
Luke's voice and accent is so rich. He could do voice acting after strongman
I would be afraid arm wrestling one of those guys would result in my arm just snapping like those gruesome videos of accidents on the web here. lol
that strongman in blackshirts is kratos
That was tremendous!
Well, this was wholesome 😊
Wholesome💕
good guys
NFL
ROIDS
ROIDS why no mention of any testing for cheating.
ROIDS why no mention of testing for cheating.
Who is going to be the winner of a heart failure at 54 years olds ?
They're literally Magni and Modi
love how happy they are!!
Inspiring!
first time i see a guy have so much pride showing  how he spent day with two, grown, big men
The man picked up a tree with all you on it.. then walked … and you thought somewhere in your mind you can beat him at tug of war… bro I bet he could spin you around so fast he’d throw you into space
Such sweet humble guys!
Great Video - Hope you enjoyed Scotland.
is there voices not deep  or i that just me
My ideal type of men❤️ Large and intimidating looking but actually sweet and wholesome.

Nice use of Forced Perspective for your thumbnail.  (Look it up)
You will never do a week in Orlando
I love the fact that:  they ate breakfast, shirtless.  Squad goals
SO WHY WERE THEY NOT IN THE OLYMPICS?
Thanks
That’s a lot of man!!! Everything has to be special ordered, I feel, the furniture, the bed. Not to mention a lot of food. The clothes. And since they’re from GB where everything seems so small…homes are small…bathrooms are small…it’s small for me and I’m small. I’ve dated a big and tall men before and they seem to be far more graceful and light on their feet which is surprising.  Physically big men tend to be truly gentle giants and kind hearted. It’s just all so interesting. That is awesome that he was/is there for his brother. It seems not many family members would be there for their family.
They even sound like giants.
didnt expect to be this wholesome
I was going to say something nasty about their health but everybody else is saying how nice they are.
Cool guys
Very inspiring content.. God bless yaa 🤜🤛
I’m swedish viking :-)
Actually great part of cold countries producing giant men is the cold water/clima. 20 seconds close to zero water baths are known to produce norepinephrine. Which induces muscle growth/hipertrophy.
The most wholesome laughs I've had wow
Awww 🥰
That was awesome and so much positivity. I am glad guys like you exist!
Those strong dudes are SO COOL!!!
Hell Yeah!
Can I marry a guy like this? Thanks.
This was a killer video extremely fun to watch!
I'm a big fan of them for a long time, truly inspiring! Absolutely love these two giant gentlemen
btw that is Oban in Scotland @2:12 not Glasgow lol
yo eric is actually strong as fuck lol hes got some good genes , should start working out everyday eric youd be a beast
They look like the nice 2 people. I would love to spend a weekend with them.
Wonderful brothers
It is unbelievable at this time that i got surprised by the fact that they feel cold water, its funny for a inhabitant of the Caribbean region.
YOU HAVE TO WEAR A SHIRT WHEN EATING
If you look on Eddie Hall's YouTube channel there's a video where Tom Stoltman broke a brick wall during a workout
Really great video. Full credit to these lads.
5:58 Three tooth picks between two giants... use them after breakfast...
Are you sure they're human ? More like a Titan.🤔
The strongest guys in the world are the sweetest guys in the world. Life is like a movie sometimes.
Lets all ignore that a 80kg (max) lift up 200kg. dam.
Well, they are not strongest mens in the world...
when I hear the term “gentle giants”, these two men are what pop up in my head.
On one hand I realise these guys are the top .01%, I still can’t help but feel gripped about the gene pool I inherited.
That laugh at 14:20 is just amazing, love it
They’re literally pigs. They won’t make it to 80
Giants in irl my clash dream 😍
they are soo nice
Thankyou YES THEORY and the STOLTZMAN BROTHERS in these trying times we need these stories
THE perfect theme song for these guys is that old song that has the famous line HE AINT HEAVY HE'S MY BROTHER by the Hollies based on exactly that. One brother carrying he's disabled brother in a 3rd world country he's was asked by a priest about it and that was his answer
how the heck do Yes Theory produce such quality with zero notice and zero money and its always so entertaining If i was the CEO of Netflix i would be freaking because it cost 10 million need 100 people and take a year to make a similar video and after all that its doubtful it would be better than what Yes Theory made Even the B team made one of the best videos on youtube in 2021 "Living with the Amish" it was a masterpiece and they needed no controversy no skeletons in closest none of the usual controversy which we see when big media companies make these type videos for TV and its so entertaining and easy to watch
45second mark  guy look very familiar
6:28 Interesting that they are both left-handed.
the other two couldnt do a single bit of the workout "we brought the weakest one we could think of.... hes the only one of the yesmen that does the whole ass workout lol
Best video I’ve watched in a while🤙🏿
Wow
Stopped watching you guys around 2019, why did I stop again? One thing I've always admired is how you guys make such wholesome videos.
Hey, Yes Theory!  My name is Johannes. I live in Norway and watch your videos almost every day! - I would have loved to see you take a trip here!   Norway also has a nice history and really nice people! We are actually one of the happiest countries in the world!  Here you can see the famous fjords and beautiful Oslo! - Hope you take my wish into consideration!  Have a great day ahead! - A great supporter of you!
What a brilliant episode! 💪😁
❤️❤️❤️
the breakfast scene looks like 3 boys eating breakfast with their uncles
Can giants be this loveable and just welcoming to be around. The best video I have seen in a while😎
That was not Glasgow that you showed at the start😂, it was Oban
wholesomeness world champions for sure these two. mad respect
These guys speak in 20Hz
World deepest voice, man sounds like an Ogre.
i have some wholsome water in my eyes for some reason...
This warmed my heart! Such amazing and beautiful people!
Great lads! Nice video, well done!
3 of those 5 people were named Tom
I want to know how tall the giants are.  Anyone know?
They're both so incredibly wholesome. What a couple of wonderful human beings.
Good thing it was just regular tug-of-war instead of the Squid Game version ;)
« I’m 70 kg » « That’s cute ain’t it? » 😂😭
Any time I hear Glasgow I immediately think of "they say Glasgow full of specky bams let's find oot"
His low voice is like, can beat even lion in  growling.
how is this simultaneously the cutest most manliest upload?
easy for me. i have skeletons
They eat more for breakfast then i do in a entire week, lmao
I'd like to be friend of those guys
Really lovely to hear the brothers back story!! What a pair of legends
Eric did it!!! 11:23
Love to watch this video <3 greetings form poland
Awesome.
How do can you prove the existence of GOD  Introduction You have probably hear this line before; but how do you know that God is real; nobody can know that for certain! But wait is that true? Can nobody really prove the existence of God or is there more to the story than that,Actually a lot more.Let me explain let's say one day you we're riding your mounbike though the forest and you sumble on abbondon bulldozer now is it's it reasonable to believe bulldezer does not have a creator I said that to say this we can look at things in nature to show the existence of GOD such as one of the great lights he created the sun to know that he is real because the sun rises and sets everyday in 2 exact  12 hour periods day and night why is it not random meaning why is it always 12 why isn't it 5 or 3 of 7 or 10 or 50 or 500 or never if God does not exist the how is there any confidence that thee sun wil rise tomorrow so you see intelligent design points to a Creator.Be blessed in the name of the name of the Lord Jesus amen.
If like was a game, you guys would be winning.
Imagine how much food 🥘 they eat
I bet you those giants crap a mountain
Loved it
If they are autistic, we need more autistic people instead normal people. .  strong people dont put other down they lift them up. .  and strong doesnt mean muscle.
I was littlebit scared becouse guys trying all heavy eqip was not so much professional.. . they coud hurt themself.. i understand point all fine but some things were dangerous. . and they coud have just smaller weight to try it :) this is how injury can take place overloading
very manly with thoose skirts
Daddies. 😍😍😍
one thing i want to know... do they voice goes that deep when they become stronger....
Bjorn Ironside
You are like one chest to them, OMG!!!
🔥🔥🔥Ⓜ️
"How are you so strong?" - such a compliment
Awesome personalities, wishing these brothers from Scotland, UK all the Very, Very Best !!!
very nice
Well that was wholesome af
All I can say about this video, is this feels like home.
Are they single dear lord
They are amazing
The Stoltman Bros are the best
“Why so many sweets?”   “To get the sugars flowing”😂tf
I was smiling throughout the video
props to that one smaller guy lifting this much is sheer will right there.
They left out the steroids.
Scottish are a different kind of nice people 👏✌️❤️
this vid was amazing omg <3
Gental Giants 🤩
Men will be men
I really think it would be an interesting experience to go spend time with the harlequins rugby player Joe Marler
Oh my god, the little dude so strong is crazy ! thats what i was impressed by. he got the stone up !!!!
Great video!!! 👍👍👍
This is so wholesome, they look like good friends
The Gentle Giants...Real Epic stuff. Respect and regards from miles across the oceans - Sri Lanka
Their voice mate
Those giants should go film a video with joel Beukers
Bigger the guy, the nicer he is
when fuking scutland hits you in vains for fuk sake

They literally got big hearts
The strongest man in the world is Pudzian
Omg this was so heartwarming ❤️
I love seeing strong big guy doing some ridiculous and funny thing, its very lovely to see humble people like them

Wheezing belly laugh is the best kind of laugh!

Two amazing guys and amazing brothers setting the benchmark for others to follow

Is it just me or the guy with smaller beared looks like jakepaul for real
The best thumbnail fs
These guys are great!   So welcoming!    Also,  he has a Sunflower tattoo!
14:14 to 14:43 Wasn't it the song "Phoole Phoole Dole Dole "
I want to be friends with them 😂
Я смотрю Сарычев подтянул английский и брата подкачал
4:48 deep voiced stong man: I'm hangreee... neeed to get sum brekfast.  😆   That's exactly how I imagined stong men would sound in real life haha!
Autism effects muscle fiber, alot of the skinniest guys you see in the gym lifting massive weights are autistic.
This was so wholesome.
They both seem like such genuine and lovely lads :,)
Scotland
18:25 Did I hear a crack?
I'd rather be lightweight, spry on my feet, and live to an old healthy age. Strongman destroys the body
ALLAH IS ONLY GOD ALWAYS BEEN, ALWAYS IS, ALWAYS WILL BE.
How tall are they?
so weird to see hitler in kawaii girl school outfit
Giant can b friendly....but dont mess around🤣😂😂😂
I hope they stay connect and in contact.
2:20 died of cringe
At the start 2:11 that picture shown isn't Glasgow, its Oban
Yujiro that you?
Giant dwarven blacksmith at 13:55: Sqüüize at at yer heps.
How many time you eat a day? Sex.
i think we just found Modi and Magni from God of War 2018
This must be so great for the brothers seeing smaller guys doing achieving the stones.
5:49 the smile
Thoroughly enjoyed that lads. Well made and edited. First time viewer. Subscribed
There's some RUSSIAN COMRADE GENES right there!!! LET'S GOOOOO
Omylord!!! My kind of men big, burly,  like a gentle giant polar bear!!!💟🥰 ,,,aaaaaaand Scotish!!!! Can't get any better!😅 cheers🍻
Luke is a legend. He helped his brother with autism achieve his highest dreams and never abandoned his bro. That's real shit
im now proud to be from glasgow lmao
Such an amazing video, happy I found your channel
Those mini sausages are awesome for breakfast. Bacon, sausages, eggs, game over.
I wish me and my brothers were this close
it's nice to see they have good table etiquette
😭 the amount of saturated fat they eat
I'm so happy I watch YesTheory. :)
cute big men <3
Fucking Legends !!
holy fuck their voice sounds like the guy who kidnaps your loved one and ask ing for money or else... but their actual personalities are the exact opposite
Eric: "We're going to go to the championship!" haha, was so happy when he finally lifted it!
what a wholesome video, they both seem like such nice guys ❤️
I want to hear them shout odin is with us
Giants with nice harts
These giants are very funny and interesting.
@ 19:07 LOVE IS LOVE
They seem like the nicest people, big men, with big hearts
They was trying to play my boi, but he was the only one able to throw up that weight🤌. What a legend 🔥🏋️‍♀️
14:30 that was amazing man he lifted easily more than he weighs right
Imagine they cared about saving the world lol
14:19 was the best part awweee !!!!
🤣🤣
by looking at the thumbnail I thought the video was "I spent a day with the biggest pot belly in Scotland" or something
I can't remember the last time I laughed that hard, even comedy movies can't do it 😄😄😄😄 especially this one 9:55
you guys are awesome, cheers to the brothers!
that made me laugh so hard XD
imma rein act a scenario: girlfriend thinks were cheating on her "me and the boys" (5:55 time stamp)
Omg !!!!
They're so humble As well 😌
These guys seem so genuine and Tom has great comedic timing.
All that strong facade aside, if a man has swollen ankles, there's inherently something wrong.
Even their voices are strong lol
Very well made video, made me like and subscribe in a second! Keep up the fun adventures!
Man I’ve trained for 20 years and this inspires the hell out of me.
even with the fat they have covering them, you can still see the glorious traps and delts
Great use of the pipes.  Good job.
Do these guys actually bathe in salt water, and that guy has neck muscle the same size As my bisept
give them some great sword, get them shouting. Damn maybe a guy in horseback would think twice approaching.
I love how they are shirtless the sholr time hahaha and respect to the dude with the black hair!!! He was so strong too!😂
Some of you guys have to be pretty tall already... I mean, you hold up well against Luke, who is 1.91m tall...
imagine beeing able to lift HALF A TON wtf
they look so fat but are fu*king huge and jacked
It's pretty wholesome to see everyone having fun
I found my new favorite video on youtube! 😍
The fact Tom has autism too is incredible. Shows how it can be a blessing in disguise as it probably forces him into his routine
I am smiling sooooo much watching this. It's clear you lads strength comes mostly from the heart ❤️💪
The Scots are among the nicest people that I've ever met. Wonderful people.
The way he dived into the water🤣🤣 As if it was just a dot of 💧💧
I now know they were the Proclaimers when they were young geeks.
as expected for some giants, they're very good at hide and seek eh 😄 look like fun people
Gratitude 🙏
17:50 18:58 I was laughing so hard I dropped from the chair :-DDD
their voice is just as I expected tbh
This dude literally picked up my car
So funny. Eric is quickly becoming my new fave!!
Thor Son
Loved everything about this video ❤️
This video is beautiful,
Imagine playing Mario Kart split screen with these dudes 💀 I'll make sure to be dead last
Just his voice would scare the s*** out of me
Imagine people's been swimming in them cold waters for hundreds of years keeping the tradition alive
I love the irish and Scottish people
I'm loving all this .....
For an "Outlander" fan this video is 👁👄👁 LOV U
To say they look anything like giants of old is reaching. They are just a little taller and more muscular then an average guy. They aren’t that extraordinary.
Its funny how thomas looked overly skinny beside two towers 😂😂😂 cooool
Just discovered you guys! Bloody Brilliant! I laughed and cried with laughter at this video!
These brothers definitely passed the vibes check
Emotional bringing video ❤️❤️❤️ I love this a lot
tom is my favorite human :)
Quick use skeleton army!
These huge guys are hugely kind.
"Eggsersize" lol
During the hide and seek 🤣🤣
All strong man I've seen or had the chance to meet are very humble and gentle giant. Apart from Eddie, he's a fucking nutcase.
3M views and 0 Dislikes ... that speaks for itself
This was so funny and heart warming. You all are so silly
women: "men want one thing and its disgusting" what men want: 14:05
Gentle Giants! They show so much personality and kindness behind the muscle. AMAZING!!
This is amazing, these guys are awesome!
Seeing you with the shirt on doesnt really prove you are into exercising too much.
Please do another video with these guys in the future!!!!
Aye that water drop sound @4:11 had me crackin up!
idk I was kinda hoping they'd have like super high pitched voices.  I loved this so much tho
Guy: I'm 70 kilos Tom: aww that's cute!!  LMAO!!!
scat-land lol its scotland
Stoltman Brother you are so awesome , strong & your nature ❤️  Also like for Eric
the accent they have is epic
I loved this.
Like they say don’t judge a book by it’s covers. The most outgoing people. Loved the video
That got my sub! Man that looked fun!
Guys, you're so awesome, so inspiring, so brave, so... strong 😄Especially the part when you talk about your childhood and the brotherhood. I've got two brothers and I thank God every day for they're healthy and happy. I love them so much. Also your story gives me a strength to believe it's never too late to do great thinks. Thank you so much and thank you, Yes Theory, for creating such videos. Seek discomfort!
18:23 Something popped.
This video was full of testosterone lol
14:39
They seem like the sweetest guys! I remember driving up to Inverness and the snow was so bad we had to go back to Glasgow 😅 I love the shot of them in their kilts too! Great reps for Scotland ♥️
when they were lifting the stones all i could think about was when i lift all the groceries up the stairs in one trip bc i hate second trips lol
Awesome video, great group of guys
It's termed the "Scottish Highlands", not the "Scotland Highlands". (Sigh!)
It’s my first time watching you guys and I love you all 💖💖💖
I'd love to see these guys wrestle a Japanese sumo wrestler!
I think these people, and their predecessors are the reason why myths about giants existed.
it sounds like they have permanent sulfur hexafluoride in their lungs
They're really hot
i kinda wana quit my diet now XD
the stone lift was sooo amazing! i am so proud and happy for this dude also for lifting 200kg!
"I just farted!" F*ckin hilarious
This video made my day!!! Thank you.
Russian genes seem to be strong ;)
Vikings
these guys are so genuine, truly inspiring
Really wanna hear the big dude with the deep voice sing wonderful world by Louis Armstrong
Irl TF2 heavies.
Well it's not hard to subscribe guys
These guys really making it... Not fake Instagram or some bullshit influencer crap. This is living life to the fullest. Big respect.
i realy look up on tom right now because of his story and i know how he felt becuase i have the same thing as him i hoop i can meet him one day
Probably one of my favourite videos ever. Just left you with a smile on your face.
Such nice guys!
One of the best; funniest and humbling clips I've seen!!!
I loved everything about this video! The sense of humour, seeing their lifestyle and how encouraging they were to you guys, and the deeper message. Well doneeeee🙂
"Im just buzzin, really"
I'm just curious, do they have hemmorhoids?
Highland boy(s) just trying to make it, put my (their) vests on yeah (no).
yeah buddy
I got way too pumped watching this
It's great to see that man are doing their manly works....
I’d love to be friends with these guys
This is mad funny😂😂
The hype just by watching this video 👍
Somebody should make a Girls vs Boys w/ autism out of this
Absolutely class, what great guys the Stoltman Bro’s are 👍🏽👏🏼🍻
This was so enjoyable and inspiring. #watchingYesTheoryAfterLongTime MISSED YOU GUYS!!! ❤❤❤😘😘😘
SENDING LOVE FROM A FELLOW AUTISTIC! Glad you guys had fun!

Love this!!!
Yall make the best videos. truly
First of all.. I don’t remember the name of the friend who spent time growing up in Russia but y’all should’ve known he’s not as weak as he looks given where he grew up.
5:50 that smile was ADORABLE <3 I want to experience a grouphug with those two
Do an episode in St Kitts :D!
👍👍
Why am I discovering this channel only now? Love the energy, you guys seem so fun!
Stoltman brothers you are truly inspiring!
A hug from these guys would make me feel warm and happy ^^
Yo we it you not we
Eric - Studly. Never judge a book by its cover.  Fun video guys.
These are just avg sized Scottish people
Eric is strong hahahah
My back hurts watching this
they are the gentle giants. Great video guys.
Their grocery bill must be out of the roof!
They're like big gentle bears
5:48 his smile is funny because of how big he’s next to him
They are big guys but feel gentleness just watching them. This video is heart warming and makes my eyes watery.
thank you for this really funny and "family" video
Awesome video guys!! And great to see the Yes Theory crew in the promised land 🙌🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I still don’t know how they hide so well, liek ghosts!!!
18:26 That snap!
This was a great video I truly enjoyed it
Great guys and great video!
I hope u guys don't get hemorrhage lifting that heavy weights
This was one of the most awesome, positive energy video I've seen. Loved every minute of it, also it was really funny too!
aye
this is so wholesome :))
4:10 was the funniest part...that sound the water makes when he gets into the water...
Damn, the 'eating part' is definitely the hardest..They spend half a day eating.
2:11 uhh pretty sure thats oban but whatever ig
They have such deep voices
The one brother Looks like a big version of MC Bones (famous german Rapper)
I would like to buy a t-shirt from Yes Theory but the currency rate is too heavy for my country so I can't :/ hopefully in the future. If anybody who earns in dollars or euros could give me this christmas gift I would really appreciate it lol the cheapest item on the website would be great already and you could actually do something out of your comfort zone (buying a tee for a stranger in Brazil just to be nice)
this was awesome
The brotherly love, you could feel it throughout the video. Keep grinding Iceland brothers, much love.
It always amazes me how kind and gentle most Giants are; I guess when you have no one to fear you don't have to put up walls and be hard like the rest of us.
Great Video…
5:00   Plottwist: it was actually a water Melon
Man, I suddenly want two giants friends. It looks so fun!
damn the audio quality on this is dope!
This was generally the best video i watched all week hands down. I was so happy watching this.
Thanks for the video - Such friendly giants :)
I Couldn't even afford to eat that much 🤣
Inverness ? I feel the sudden urge of re-watching outlander for the third time 🥲
Eric's the worlds second strongest man
Those guys are so cool!!!  Wish them the best.
Bjorn ironside first pic
as John 3:16, reads: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
What boys do when they play VS What girls do when they play
#340 never judge a book by it's cover
Just replaying to see eric again and again you go buddy 🤍
gay
2 Goliaths
this was awesome thanks
At 14:15, I was so pumped, I screamed and jumped up, knocking my chair over and waking up my wife. I was vicariously stoked for his achievement.
"Haha, four eyes!"  **rings these guys**
I had so much good emotions and laughed so much while watching this video. You are so cool guys. Whenever you are in Canada come visit me for a day with a home builder :)
what a funny video
THEY ARE SO FUCKING SWEET! I'm in love 🥰
The lampshade killed me 😂😂😂
I think they would play Thor god of thunder way better
He's about 400lbs, then he smiles like ya, I could eat you. 🤣 I'm 70 kilos, "that's cute" 🤣
i knew a guy in my old town, he was on a 20,000 calorie a day diet for his strongman regime, all i remember is his fists were the size of footballs  edit: if my mind isnt playing tricks on me, he was about 7 foot tall and smelled like cigarettes and vodka
18:33  omg.
Bara irl
I have a big smile on my face from watching this , it was funny, wholesome and heart warming. I loved it thank you for sharing this experience :)
eggercise
I so want to get down to my performance weight 165 lbs. I used to leg press 600 lbs. oh I’m Scottish heritage 😉
That was so cool!  Great vid .. I know what gym workouts can do for a young person (endorphins are awesome) and they tell the truth about it
with the 5 of them sitting at the table looks like 1 stacked club sandwich with 3 skinny pieces of bread lol
Such class,  true gentlemen. 👍
10,000 calories??? Shit I think I do that in 5-6 days.
I hate to be annoying but at 2:13 when you used they were in Glasgow the drone shot is actually in a place called Oban.
I love this vidoe so much!!!
World strongest human is Mariusz Pudzianowski
Nice to have a test theory video in my country
Normal people: gym Giantss: JAM
They literally look like CGI people standing next to them...  Awesome vid.
Giants indeed.... and at heart as well 👍👊
Such a good vibes Nice Giants and Very funny Love It
come to my country bolivia witrh the same amount of money you went there with.
some west African men are even stronger
When you meet people like this you learn that the kindest people are the strongest ones, and the ones who would want to harm you are the ones that have some power and want to show it on weaker.
Two bears vs three men.
those are some big bois
I thought i was a big food eater until i met these giants.
Top Lad, keep it up
5:40 eating six times a day, and 6000 cal in one day, sounds good to me man. 😂
They have the manltiest names I´ve heard. In swedish, Stolt man would translate to proud man. Very nice.
They should get a Great Dane feel like the dog would match their energy
First time here and it was a great video.
Extremely proud of Eric…nicest and the strongest brothers ever!!!
This is one of my ultimate favourite videos OF ALL TIME!!! Great job guys! and they were so nice!!!🥺💕💕💕
NICE
15:08 Kratos
How is it possible to fund that kind of caloric intake? INSANE.
I’m 6’2 170 pounds and could put a nice dent into that food and not gain an a gram. Help. 😂
"I'm 70kg" "That's cute isn't it"   Laughing my ass off xD I'm 60kg my self so... :D
Wow - Gentle Giants. What amazing, friendly, kind men.  Also - Eric needs to start training now! That was ridiculous
I wish i was a part of this..
Holy shit they are so awesome and cool!
Dont know why, but this video made me smile so much thanks to you all ! Lovely guys . so good energi.
Nice, love the energy<3
those 2 are amazing. really nice guys :)
Voice so deep
2:11 that's not Glasgow, its a small town called Oban on the west coast of Scotland.
I have no idea how I ended up here but I really enjoyed seeing that
respekt
Thank you giants straight from da BRONX NYC, what a motovation.  You guys are real giants, gentle giants which makes me a negative feather. Thank You Brothers.
Imagine an army of these guys two thousand years back rushing you. I would legimitalely find and loose religion at the same time.
I love your videos. Thanks for bringing the best stuff and I appreciate your efforts. A lot of respect from Planet Ayurveda.
This was so refreshing to watch - 2 giants and yet so humble.
I have the utmost respect for these brothers, you guys are awesome!!!
this is the most wholesome and entertaining video ive ever seen
Their strongest man voices suits them perfectly!  The brothers are crazy strong! But they're also down-to-earth, funny, and positive. This will sound weird but they also seem gentle. The guys scored big when they chose to spend time with the Stoltman brothers!
10,000 calories??? Hope their toilets are industrial grade
I wonder if these dudes realize how much money their loads are worth
inspiring`n positive
Why don't they ever show the drugs they use
please they are sooo cute!!! 🥺
You guys are all amazing!!
The hide and seek....im literally crying laughing
They have such deep voices
I love how they look nothing like marvels version of strong men. No chiseled comic book muscles,  it's all solid mass.
Man... I weigh 45 kilos, to me these guys are like monster trucks!!

Even the voice of these brothers can shake the rocks off of mountains.
🤣🤣the hide and seek part
"eggsercise" noice
Bro their voices alone could give you the adrenaline boost to lift 1000 pounds. Those men sound like if normal vikings hit puberty. And man, talk about a glow up bro.
What do they do to become soo big?
happy to live in scotland
These men look like guys in the anime vinland saga
I really like these guys...
Honestly I feel for them when they said the hardest part is the food intake... I'd love to lift and start building up muscle but I just can't afford the amount of food it'd take to have a caloric surplus, I can just barely get enough food to get by, and can't imagine having to cook and eat so much all day every day to build to their level and size 🤯
iron biby is the strongest man in the world
U workout and use weights or resistance training after every injury. It is part of physical therapy. So when people say they were injured and it prevented them from working out, that is the biggest lie and load of BS. Just say uve been lazy ur entire life and never wanted to exercise. If you're skinny and don't over eat it's OK to never exercise. It is only if you're over weight when zero exercise becomes a problem.
18:24 that pop tho
They're so handsome and kind
I feel this way on the daily, I’m 5’2
They are soo humble and polite I just love ❤ them 😉
I absolutely love the Stoltman Brothers. You just got yourself a new subscriber.
They must spend alot on food. That breakfast looks like a buffet.
1:43 whats the point of saying europes after u have said worlds strongest?
Despite their tough looks, they are very nice and funny guys.
The way you snuck that ad in there beautiful seamless relevant and engaging damn good job
these guys voices sound like  thunder, and stones breaking..  its  crazy
How can you afford to eat that much.  You have to take out a loan to go grocery shopping!
I'm currently working with a neurologist on my theory of what many people in my time called  "Tard Strength "  I have autism,  at 12 years old weighing only 75 lbs and 5'2 I used to lift and carry a 35 gallon tote of action figures weighing around 50 lbs everywhere I went. I used to move furniture for my grandmother once carrying a 35" crt tv up two flights of steps with only a bit of sweat.  I truly believe autistic people are capable of more physical strength and am trying to discover why.
One of the nicest people I ever met was Mark Henry.   I now have a best friend who is a strongman.  He's helping me with my weight gaining and exercising.
The most manliest video ive even seen 😂
Amazing
Big people die sooner than normal height people. A saw few cases of people i know.
Loved it guys lol
This was brilliant. Two lads seem like such gents!
There was a lack of women in this video
I will be done by lifting 40 Kg with both hand not to mention 80 kg with single hand
even when you guys talk make me nervous brooo
As someone with a younger brother with autism I have huge respect for Luke and are a big fan of both men
10 out of 10 best video everrrrrr 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 Truly made me laugh out loud so fucking happy watching this thank you guys so much  Made my day
who ever edited the splash at 4:11 need a raise
You should let everyone write a city in the world here in the comments and then make a roulette out of them, and then go to the random city it lands on!!
I have a grandson who was diagnosed on the spectrum just a few months ago. This shows they CAN overcome! From a descendant of a McGregor…  Slàinte Mhath!
Mega cool from Lithuania, Zydrunas Savickas fan here, well you all know who he  is
Alberto Canosa Joined the chat
Why don't you try going to the seafood capital of the Philippines (Roxas City). 😁
best video i love it
bro im sorta built like them broad shoulders and big bodied
yea? where is BIG Z ?
Awesome video totally loved it all time favourites Stoltman brothers 💜
They the real life viking bos..haha
I smiled throughout this entire episode. Timeless entertainment.
smiling the whole time watchin this lol <3
but iceland is mask and vaxx crazy
11:22 😅😂🤣🤣🤣
Those big dudes are awesome.
Gentle giants. Seem like liget good dudes. Question, did he say that dude is 400 lbs. 😯
Picks up a heavy rock AAHAHAHAHHAAAAAAAA! It's the little things.
"we brought the weakest man we could think of for this" *10 minutes later* *lifting things both of the others couldn't*
dudes voice is so low the camera mic can barely handle it lol
Mentioning Thor and Eddie as international recognized names in strong man when each of them only won it once and you forget to mention Brian Shaw, four time winner and regular competitor for nearly a decade? Damn man, you really did him dirty there.
awesome video, great guys!!!
great story ... thanks for sharing it... !
This was so wholesome, those brothers are the greatest.
I don't knows, guys, but it felt really really dangerous for your spines when you tried to move this rock. Would've been nice if you'd left any precautions here, so people won't try to throw boulders at home.
4:11😂
Some people joking why we can't see their abs. As it was said: Abs are not sign of power, abs are sign of not eating enough :D  Seriously, compare them in strength with any  6 pack Hollywood actor. They not even stand a chance.  Abs more about visual, you have to fast and drink miniscule amount of water to look that good on camera.
You guys always have the best videos!
They must be diabetic and have heart disease with that diet!
Damn I'm stupid 😂 I thoughts they'd be really tall,but yeah they're still like giants. they're the ones we will have to turn to-to fight actual 23ft tall giants
This was great to watch, honestly. Not often you watch a video and you smile the whole way through.
such cool guys ...thats awsome
Tom has the cutest smile >.<
inspired.
I'm extremely proud of these guys, fantastic people and achievements
I wanna see one of these guys beat up a silver back gorilla
the running race actually scares me 18:15 we'd all die
how do they afford to eat!?
I'm relocating to Scottland
❤️🙏
two strongest men in skirts
they are so wholesome and awesome
His voice is so deep, absolutely jealous of that thundering voice of the gods.
Not seen a woman love a man
wholesome
They sound like dwarves xD
Nice 👍#staysafe
One of the best episodes I’ve seen.  Awesome!
who the fuck is disliking this video man
I had to much fun!!! make me remind my child time! thanks!
I came to the comment section and it wasn’t what I thought it would be 😅
I enjoyed this amazing video sooooo much thanks guys
The Stoltman Brothers don't need a Microphone, instead the Microphone need the STOLTMAN BROTHERS 😎😎
Hope, confidence and a lot of positive thinking is about to let not only muscles grow but the personality of each one! Thank you for this video.
What a strong.. they surpass human being
Their poop fills entire toilet
18:26 Did something just crack?
why do they sound like what you'd expet a god or mythical being to soing like
lose the adds fuck nordic track
This is the kind of gym buddy that I'd say yes all day every day. To him be the glory, boys
Wow this was actually so unexpectedly heart warming!!! Very impressed
I cried
I've been following the Stoltman Brothers and strongman for years now. About time these guys get the recognition they deserve.
12:36 btw, he's originally from Russia:)
man my face hurts from having a huge smile on my face for 20 minutes, man what a good video those guy are awesome!
Very nice to watch!!
Cool
This has to be my absolute favorite video. These men are probably the most kind and beautiful souls I’ve ever had the pleasure of watching it’s just awesome!
Do they own shirts?
these men are amazing......one question are you married????
this is so fricken wholesome !
It's like watching Brian shaw but two and alot younger
their voice...  deeper than the ocean
Great story and great brothers.
I’d play twister with them any day
Loved this video, not to mention the handsome Scotts😳, but seeing the training and results are amazing!! I'd get my training done if I were able to eat and eat! I want a big brother to help me out here! Shoot! I want to have at least a quarter of their strength, I'd die a happy woman!😁💛
12:06 my moms grocery bags.
Wow, the Stoltman brothers are truly awesome men- welcoming, friendly, funny and fantastically strong.
Those dudes are thrice the size of your body.
"in the world" you know, I could get a skinny black guy from the country side that could lift more than they lift...come on
Great video! Just wanted to point out that the Aerial shot in the opening with the Title "Glasgow" is actually a shot of the Town of Oban which is in Argyll and Bute, a fair little whack away from Glasgow haha.
This video was so awesome. Inspiring and funny. That's the way to bring a good message.
Very entertaining video!  The big thing here is that a person really took care of his quite different behaving brother, did the right (and quite difficult) thing, and took it ALL the way. I mean.. my dayjob is at an organization that specializes in helping people with autism spectrum disorders, and seeing this.. this is the one thing, professionals often can't do! There's various reasons they can't do it: it's a job, so when they get off they do their thing, their convenient life  - or maybe they just do it for the money, and deep down just don't care. But here.. that's just pure compassion! That's thing next level stuff we need in out kind of buissiness! :-)
Loved the video but it needs a spoiler alert :-(
hahahaha, loves the game that u guys played!!!
how much do they weigh...?
Dislike because of inbetween Promotion
love the happiness that you guys show with each other!!!!
I’m built big for a girl. Nearly 6ft tall and 275. I’d love to find me a guy like this. Most men are intimidated by me. I wanna guy that makes me feel safe and protected. Someone that could literally sweep me off my feet. It’s nearly impossible to find. AND THERES TWO OF THEM IN SCOTLAND?!!! I’m on my way.
Best s*** I've seen in a long time!! Was smiling the whole time
Comment for the algo
Just stupid !!!
man these brothers need to be marketed they seem like amazing people.
off topic but i have the NordicTrack bike and I love it
That autism story was incredible, so awesome!
So… how much elixr?
I love these two and their story! ❤️ Great video!
For anyone wondering, smelling salts release ammonia gas. If you breathe in this gas, it irritates the insides of your nose and lungs to such an extent that it stimulates your sympathetic ("fight-or-flight") nervous system. This is an autonomous part of your nervous system that, when activated, has all sorts of arousing effects on your body, releasing adrenaline, increasing your heart rate, opening up your lungs, increasing blood flow to your skeletal muscles (while decreasing it to your digestive system), and generally preparing your body for action. For athletes, these effects may be desirable and performance-enhancing, although perhaps especially so for athletic feats that require quick bursts of action. Smelling salts have also been used to revive athletes that have been rendered unconscious (e.g. boxers), because their arousing effects counteract the fainting response.
correction , two of the worlds strongest men , they are not the only two
4:11 that's a violation bro 🤣
Such a nice human beings
These guys are really cool. I’m 5’5 and 100 pounds so they are definitely giant. How do you afford to eat 6 times a day? I have trouble affording to eat once a day lol. Hey if i could though I’d eat 6 times a day. I love food!
S C O T L A N D!❤️
love the bromance! love the inspiring autism back ground! you men all rock! KEEEP UP THE FIRE! From a friend fellow redhead giant in northern Vermont! If you vist, please swim lake Willoughby!

This is awesome! @14:24 "I get why you do this!" is such an epic moment!
These guys are so chill
Seems gay. These dubiously looking small" white " guys( that actually looking a bit asian caucasian, one even indian), all over these big white dudes .
Ps I would find it a privilege And honor to hang out with such people
U guys are so cool   Great humer   And no Attitude   The Absolute best

im so happy i clicked this :) :)
10:57 😂😂😂😂😂it's the sound effect for me
04:09😂😂😂😂 the sound of the water when he dipped in
This is so bad..but I love a giant of a man. They don’t make many like this. Awesome!  🤗
These guys look like they would be great to hang with
how beautiful :)
Fun and dope content 💯🔥 I adore their humility 🔥🔥    Plus, I do love their deep voice, I wish I could sound like one 🔥💯♥️  But that will put me into a collision course with my dad 🤣🤣🤣
Every time I see the Stoltman bros they always come across as the nicest, most humble guys. My respect or them goes up with every encounter.
Super Heroes
Yeah....Being shirtless was important
At 2:12 when it says GLASGOW. The picture is actually of Oban which is about a ferry journey and a four hour drive north in Argyll.
The hide and seek part made me lol, great video, excellent people!!!
This was so much fun, literally just a bunch of guys being dudes
Excellent piece on my people, thank you.
What totally cool guys!!
hahahaha this part made me sub lol 11:19
Bruh wtf is happening here lol
eric worlds smallest strongest man
they. Are  biig
This is a mad video lads. Absolutely love it 😅🤩
this was the most wholesome video i have ever watched!!
oh man these guys are so cool!!!
The point is: They are soo humble and friendly
I can only imagine the experience their mother went through to give birth.
How do I get in touch?
Worlds strongest men? So where is Eddie Hall or Brian Shaw?
How big are the women?
I truly loved this video. I laughed and I cried and it was amazing!!!
You guys should do a video with brian shaw next 4x WSM.
Wow...I mean, okay that's great and all, but...nothing historically mentioned of Black  or Brown people, as Giants?! ONLY White people can be the slightest bit genetically pre-disposed to  becoming "Giants"...? Please let me know if I missed something....
very niiiice
3:14 song? bro this shit slaps
That was great, guys, had me in stitches :)
His voice, deamon 🙂👍
Good on Eric, good effort through the video, and the comedic bit before he beasted up was also cool, lol .. Good video guys, thanks
they seem like rly fun people ngl
Im on a strong man diet sans the weightlifting.
With a grain of salt.
come to brazil!!!! id love to welcome you guys
Absolutely AWESOME!!!
I love how cool these two guys are.
This is the cutest thing ive ever seen in my entire life. 🥺 New fave episode from you guyysss 💞
"Try to understand how they became the giants they are today".....that is easy to understand. It is called Genetics.
They look like hulk driving a car
in what competion have they have first place ? How they are strongest ? What about arnold  competiotion ?
Nobody is messing with you if you are hanging with these dudes. They are very humble too.
Bro erik right?  He is strong man!!!
Do you make good money doing this?
I really enjoyed it. Thanks. And the fact were "Dora the explorer" in last was epic
They skip crunches though
All love man.  Awesome to see guy's just being guy's and friends without worrying about being judged.
Imagine an army of people there size running at you with axes.  That's the Vikings. No wonder they where feared.
I'd rather be able to see my own penis honestly.
10:03 looks like a chubbier Jake Paul
Wow all you guys seem like such great people. Both Stoltman brothers are literally the best example of friendly giants ❤️❤️
This was fantastic to watch
4:10😂😂😂that sound fx.
Your intro is not very accurate to the mythos. but i did enjoy it
- How many times do you eat? - Sucks
Little known secret, Luke and Tom are actually Bane's friendly Scottish cousin's
EPIC
Your best video ever. Big appreciation for what you all do for our world and global community, Thank you from England.
That hide and seek is hilarious 😂😂
those guy's voices are deeper than the giants buriel sites
they're gentle giants💕
These Guys are soooooo godamn friendly. Like, very introvert wants to be like them. Even though they are some of the strongest men they have no ego and are humble. Mad respect.
*In Hindi language (indian language) Kushi means happiness and I hope brother you are  happy* ❤️ *Love from india ✅*
great video!
This video is so fun and wel made. Made me really happy, thank you.
Yes theory... Cmon that was a shot of Oban not Glasgow. They're nowhere near eachother 🙄
Beautiful Story. 🥰
Great guys! One of the greatest videos I’ve seen on YouTube in a long time. Very inspirational brothers.
You spent the day with giant fat steroid bellies 😂
These Guys had so much fun. God bless each of you.
yep, another AMAZING VIDEO MAN! keep it up
Awesome video! The enda realy cracked me up :D Please make more strongman videos!
18:32 Drax vibes
Alright lads, that's Oban and no Glasgow, very different gaff
ehh the World's Strongest Men is Mariusz Pudzianowski from Poland ;) wisit him, he is realy nice person, and he would eat that two Guys for breakfast xD :D
That bread toss was hella smooth!
This was truly an inspirational video to watch. My day has started off better than ever because of it. Thank you all!
"What's the hardest part about being a strongman?" "This. The food."  Well, what my guy really meant was all the ceaseless shitting that comes from that, but he didn't wanna be nasty on camera... and while they ate breakfast, of course.
I see Blake Griffin living his life hahaha!
What a great adventure, I loved this!
Here me out. Take a stranger to Rhode Island and stay a night in the conjuring house.
luke is an awesome big bro tom is just an oversized puppy hahaha
man that deep voice
The disrespect using the drip sound effect 😂😂
The Stoltmans are so cool, and so are you guys. Amazing video guys.
When I'm trying to get interview from my dad....
They’re voices are pure testosterone lol
I know you shouldn't generalise... However, it does seem that all the major strongmen are just really nice blokes. Regardless of where in the world they are from, they all seem decent blokes you'd be happy to call your mate.
This is what masculinity is about to me. I only wished that others would see it the same. :)
When he dropped it, he was OH SHIT YOU ALR???
Just a bunch of shirtless men having a great time
FOR FREEDO......................................PRETZELS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not to lessen Toms achievements, but I wouldn't consider him disabled. Being introverted is a personality trait. True autistics are not able to organize their lives themselves and need to be looked after.
Brian Shaw is def one of the strongest people that has ever walked this planet
that guys remind me a giant from BFG movie
This video was so much FUN!! Thank you guys! Love to the big brothers :)
Would have been really cool had we not seen their sock lines at the beginning
I have a nortic track
One of these guys should be the motion body capture for Thor in god of war
How many calories do they eat
5:36 for a sec there i thought tom was about to eat the little man :D
Such cool guys
Giant hide and seek. That’s great🤣
Guy picks up massive rock ball. Gets super stoked. "I'm so happy for you guys" says the giant man. Then probably picked it up with his one giant hand like a basketball lol
The poor women who bore them!
Modern Day Brave Hearts, great video 👍
the way these guys kept working through their problems its inspiring
Its nice to see there are still honest to God good people out there the brothers were the definition of good ole boys as we call them in alabama just nice guys that could literally break you if they wanted to but they seem to be fun loving guys Stoltman bros you have a new fan I will be keeping up with yall good luck with all your endeavors and God bless
On the Atlas stones, the aura of Gym Bros shone brightly.
This cracked me up.
At 7:00 - that's hilarious. A normal guy looks like a hobbit between two giants.
TOms the man. YOure a real hero dude.
Big respect and thanks from Sydney, Aust! That was a blast and very inspiring. What a great story and told in a very personal way. Loved it - Dave
1:16 (Highland Games) - "...and men who really are men". How things have changed. Today a "real man" wears makeup, spends more time grooming than exercising, gets easily offended, can identify as a woman as he sees fit, is fixated on his rights rather than his responsibilities, refuses to say anything that might offend anyone etc.. To do otherwise would be classed as toxic masculinitiy. We've come a long way! Lord help us...
This is the manliest video I have ever seen.  :-D
Well this was one of the most adorable and inspirational things I've seen. Those two are incredibly lovely and humble brothers.
0:34 wait, thats my wallpaper
The giant hide and seek made me laugh out loud!
the giant hide and seek was hilarious
I guess strong man competitions don’t pay that well judging by dudes lil kitchen and dining area lol … he needs a VPN sponser lol
2:12 'Glasgow' over a picture of Oban, a completely different town.
Wholesome this. Yall are legends
I used to lift amazing weights. Never a giant, but extremely strong. These guys are incredible
Man love you Stoltman brothers!! Please be an advocate for Autism!!
Man what awesomeness!!
Super fun video!!!!
This is what kids should aspire to be be!!
aww that's super sweet. loved this episode
wholesome, just the title, is good enough! May scotland and the rest of europe always be well!
oh wow... eye candy
Can you send me one of those nordictracks?
No way! how did that skinny guy pick all of that up! Where is all that strength coming from!? haha you go my man! You go!
I really look up to them, as a gym goer with autism this really inspires me 💪❤️
what about greek mythologi? i mean its older than them all
lmao!! this was awesome good shit fam
18:28 Legend has it they are still looking for the Giants!
World's Strongest and the sweetest men !!
truely an awesome video and you people too lots of successes to you all and stoltman bros too
had a little tear build up in my eye then lol, fair play
That was awesome!
This is what true masculinity looks like
Luke is a brother everyone needs
they both are fookin amazing
Two legends 👏🏽👏🏽
This was a great video! Made me smile:)
beautiful video
So inspiring and beautiful... And funny. Gives me some clarity on my useless ongoing lifestyle.
last true men in the world
I Loved it!!! Thanks for sharing this experience!! Really made my day!
Going to shoot a Yes Theory style docy on me flying back to South Africa from Italy to surprise my family friends and show them my current BBC interview. Excited to see how it turns
Gigantic men, nano dicks!!!
Gentle giants.....good genuine hardworking people..
The Stoltman Brothers are not just strong, they seem fun and kind as well.
"smelling salts that give you a boost" sounds like cocaine to me
The first ever friendly giant 🤩
9:50 I thought Eric was just wearing an oversized jacket turns out it was Luke’s 15:46 the whole time 😭😭😭😭
Ronnie Coleman reference "yea buddy!" at 5:00  :D
I cant imagine how it feels to be punched by one of these guys
10,000 calories a day? This is no different from models starving themselves for beauty pageants
these strong men are super down to earth.seem like top gents
Eric is cute asf
4:40 laughs in giant
serendipitous timing indeed friend
we need a part 2
❤️❤️❤️ ~ You don't have a disability, you have "A GIFT" ~ ❤️❤️❤️
Loved it... "then let's go out and play"
5:43 this part reminds me of how to train your Dragon for some reason. Such a beautiful episode. ❤❤
YEAH, DONT MESS UP WITH THESE GUYS AND DROP A LIKE AND A COMMENT BEFORE THEY CALL THE GIANTS. great content
These guys are such gentle giants ❤️❤️❤️
They have the dna of a Viking but souls of an angel. Gentle giants.
Wait, what portion of the video is sponsored by NordicTrack?
"Eggsersize"?
This was so much fun! These lads are so amazing, the bond they have is amazing. Love the story from when they were young, big brother did what he can to make his little brothers life better :)
Eric is yoked
Lovely fella's although I cant help but think the heart attack is only a heat beat away. No mention of the steroid routine?
Boys.... You never disappoint...!   Awesome
Man their beards weighed more than you..lol
Is nobody else gonna talk abt Tommy just tearin up those lifts
yay, wholesome people! :D
This is why the Stoltman Brothers are so cool! That was the funniest heavyweight shit i've seen so far! Thank you for this!
🤭
I LOVE their voices. SO STRONG!!!
Gentleman... this was F'n GREAT ! ! !  This is the first of your videos that I've seen, it might also be the first video I've ever wished I could've been part of. lol  It seriously looks like yous had a blast!
two props for the Scottish Rugby team
Big , humble lads and their three hobbit friends! Loved this.
For someone who has Autism, this made me feel so emotional knowing that the worlds strongest man has it too. I've always felt so out of place with myself because of it but he's shown me that I can do what I want in life no matter what I am. Thank you for inspiring me to really reach my goals more. Xx
The world is full of great people, thanks for sharing.
These are two really great men... Great personalities and really seem like two really nice guys.  I really enjoyed the video! Very well done! I would have loved to hang out- This is the next best thing.  These two should do some film work.  I would love to see them on the Silver Screen.
This was so much fun to watch 😁😁
They both have reached the deepest possible voice for humans so they sound the same
4:36 the guy reminds me way too much of Drax the Destroyer, especially when he laughs
These are strongmen, but they definitely aren’t the worlds strongest men.
WTF a 5 minute ad in the middle of the vid?
You guys have to make a trip to Canada soon , absolutely love the positivity you bring to the world , my boyfriend is obsessed with your channel and has been struggling with mental health issues and I can seriously say that watching you guys has helped us both , we live vicariously through YES theory . Thanks so much .
Beautiful storytelling and inspiring people!
Those guy's had an incredibly deep voice
What an edit..!⭐️
what is matter with word gods the is no gods just humains on this earth  the only lord that your going to see is after you die that's it
Best 20 minutes I've spent in a long time...super!
This was so heartwarming, more so than any mainstream sporting video I've seen.
Don't you mean "the Scottish Highlands" not the "Scotland Highlands" lol
Tom''s face at 5:45 hahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaahah Imagine him hungry and angry 😂😂😂
👏👏👏👏👏
This goes back to when i heard joe rogan talk about weight ratios when it comes to big guys vs typically average low weight guys, "he can just sit you" and its pretty much over haha
If you ever visit Novosibirsk please let me know )
How many women's pelvises have these guys destroyed....
I need more enjoyable content like this. This was so entertaining to watch and felt so relatable that I wanted to become a strongman and compete, and I'm a wheelchair bound woman!  I felt like I knew them all.  Thanks guys!
Breakfast was by far my favorite part. All shirtless
Just their voice is already have Chad vibe lol hahahhaa
I still can't believe that that skinny dude got some above average strength.
wow.. this is one of the best videos i've ever seen.
Lol
18:26 i thought his bone cracked 😅
5:50 his smile  lol
3:21- When the parent wake u up for kindergarden
Really loved this video and couldn't stop laughing at how you guys totally underestimated Eric 🤣🤣. Plus I've always had a thing for the Scottish accent since Sean Connery in James Bond  so I'm totally in love with the brothers, especially Luke, what a hottie 😍 ❤ 😘😘
Literally laughing out loud. How cool was that . Say hello to your new giant friend, I’m jealous 😉🤗
Based masculinity.
As the 2 great brothers have taught everyone, dedication, time, and courage, you too can be like them... Congrats guys, you are both wonderful human beings..
“smelling salts”
Great video lads..knew your family well when we lived in Invergordon (for 43 years).All the very best to you
This is amazing! Thank you so much for this wonderful content! Really heartwarming!
they seem so down to earth and sweet i can't  xx
What's the point of smelling salts when you can just smoke a little bit of crack before your workout?  Never be afraid to ask questions Tai Lopez out, keep learning guys. 🧠
They must save a lot on shirts, and laundry.
I enjoyed your video! very edutaining!
These guys are so inspiring it’s not even funny 😂
The breakfast sandwich was nice. Some really big meat patties between the buns and a drip of mayo!
I’m jealous that men can eat like this and get strong. If I ate like this, you’d have to roll me out of the kitchen.
I struggle to understand him
Holy shit. They are beasts
1:17  narrator: “and men who really are men” While dude is wearing a skirt and swinging around a rope. Perfect timing😂
These guys are awesome
I wouldn't know that the lil bro had autism. He speaks very well to be honest.
Even after achieving so much, the humbleness of these brothers is mind-blowing!
This was really beautiful. I don't go for the mythology, but these guys have a lot of love emanating from them.
You need to come and see Legend of strongmans Mariusz Pudzianowski. He is now MMA fighter.
No representation of Jesus the Christ? What a waist of life!
I've walked over guys bigger than that just to watch a fight.
Tom does not come across someone who has Autism.  Such cool dudes and incredibly humble.
omg i wanna do this
My psyches atlas has officially been pinned with your youtube channel; my entire future is currently remapping itself thanks to your inspiration, vision and f@$king brilliant execution. I now know what I want to be and do, create and share. Thank you times treezillion! Yas yes yep I’m in.
This made my day 🙏❤ God bless you all.
I don't think I have ever seen two more humble, happy people. These guys would be a blast to be around, except for that ice cold morning swim. Two brothers, strongest men in the world and really great, nice human beings, these guys deserve the success they achieve.
5:52 the absolute size difference of these lads is incredible omg
You calling two fat man giants ???. The real giants you will find in South Pacific islands .
Thank you.
eggsercise
Clicked on this for the thumbnail. Was not disappointed. Droooool.
ive always watched shaw and hall but after this i am definitely watching all the brothers videos
OMG you hear that 18:25
11:25 lol
I noticed a distinct lack of SOY... Just saying.
Just wanted to say how awesome your channel is its fun and adventurous and most informing KEEP GOING -seek discomfort love that motto
they would never beat Arnold S
this was an insanely and immensely positive video!
it annoys me knowing you were in glasgow and thats me just finding out :/
When tyem made voice changer they used these two guys doing the thing
The stoltmans have looked stronger...
so fun to watch :D
So does anyone ever wear a shirt there?
Tom and Luke are gentlemen and fine representatives for Scotland.  They're also massive fans of Rangers FC , Scotland's premier soccer side.
Stoltman brothers + The Rock would be a great episode !!
These guys look like a great laugh! :D
those guys are like space marine.
18:55 LMAOOO THATS THE FUNNIEST SHIT IVE SEEN ALL MONTH
14:15 FREEEEDOOOOMMMMMMM!!!!!!!
Yeah i would deff hangout with them
The older brother can voice act any troll, giant or dwarf in any movie or video game that will ever exist.
10k calories is like about 2 weeks worth for me!
It is kinda humbling to know that one of these blokes can probably throw me high enough so that I die from the fall.
Their accents are heavier then their body…lol 😹Erik was unbelievable 😅
I think that the video will be better without music 👍
Awesome video. I wish I was there to enjoy all those moments. Hang out with a couple of big lugs. Gentle giants. Amazing fun.
One of the most wholesome vids I've ever seen! Thanks a lot, that was a fun experience in and of itself just watching the video of your exploits.
Brilliant !  from start to finish.
Omg I’m in love with them, so genuinely beautiful inside and out
These 2 guys were super normal and seem very enjoyable to be around. Definitely not the typical hardcore gym type lol
Friendly giant “never judge a book by it’s cover”
5:55 sitting on the middle seat in a plane. for 8 hours
I smiled for the start, geez this was awesome!
This video made me grow a beard🙏🙌
Normal humans do 10,000 calories a day:giants should do 100,000 calories a day....hmmm??posible vid ideas
That dude screamin' in the cold waves?  Sub.
This was great! If I ever marry I want a Scottish giant. 😜😎 And those interviewers we're hilarious!  Well done to all.
This was wholesome
They look like they give great hugs
2:11 is Oban, not Glasgow
This was awesome!
could not stop smiling and laugh
That was amazing, Tom's story is inspiring!
i loved this video.
saw this as a YT suggestion and while I like to be fit I loathe "gym bro" stuff but watched just to see the Gaelic giants and have to say "That was an awesomely good show! Looks like a lot of fun was had! Thanks for all the smiles."
what about brian shaw
All I want to sing right now is SUPERHEROS by THE SCRIPT❤
Stoltman brothers are so awesome man
I feel this was bordering on suddenlygay anytime they were naked and touching
i really hope these guys do some cardio. if you increase the hearts working load without strengthening the heart itself youre just asking for heart disease
AWESOME
I can‘t really tell whether it‘s because of their accent or because of how insanely deep their voice is but I can barely understand what they are saying hahahahha, anyone else feel that way?
y u all r naked most of the time ??
i just love the ultra good vibes in this video it makes me so happy
Wow! I'm glad I'm not their mamma that needs to feed those boys
🥰🥰🥰🇮🇳
OK TIME TO EAT LIKE STRONG MAN TO GET BIG AND STRONG
The fact you got to witness some of my beautiful country is amazing.
Oban is not Glasgow
They must really (Not on Purpose of course) intimidate the Auto Dealerships.
I want to be in between those hugs  in 4:27
Hail to the man who edited the "plop" 😂😂
They literally have the cutest smiles I can’t
Have you guys gone to Harmandir Sahib? In Amritsar?
Who ever has them as their boyfriend is a lucky person.
these huge men are sooo fine I just can't like i'm over here crying because I can't have one as my husband like suicidal thoughts type things im done im done
These guys are the coolest, you got to love the stoltman brothers
what great bunch of lads   truly made me feel wonderful to see you guys having a blast together
Jesus even their voices are strong
The Brothers are real super hero 2021 All love my friend Good JOb -that one dude that lift the stone ball
That diet can’t be good for your heart
Why couldn't I get to spend a day with them....and Graham McTavish....sigh......so handsome.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
What an awesome video thanks 👌🏼
This was so much fun to watch! Thank you!
"Put it down, Hans, it doesn't need to be there" I heard a comedian say this once about strong man competitions, these guys are off the charts🐾;)...
definitely the best episode ever
Only nice people in this video!
Was one of THE MOST inspiring videos I have seen in a looooong time. The dude who you guys shit on showing what a BEAST looks like was EPIC !
5:52 that was a very jarring shot to cut to
Love this episode.... 👍💕🎞👍
"Muh thumbs argh wey bigger than yors hehehehe"
They seem like the nicest guys ever <3
Just want everyone to understand that if they stayed there and ate 10,000 calories a day and trained every day, that they would all get gigantic like that as well, not as tall of course- but big. They would be a big band of vikings.
You guys ligit look like little boys sitting next to them
BULL FCKN SHI THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD IS N SOME VILLAGE R TOWN N SOME AFRICAN COUNTY FOH
can you imagine the 4 flush crap... you would take after a 10 thousand calorie day? you would have to...break it up with a stick... you would have to have 2 shitters, one to start and one to finish. You would have to have your house plumbed with 6 inch pipe...not 3 inch. You could hire a group to pick out all the corn and peanuts and sell them again....... I could go on.
This made my day!
Those Stoltman brothers are adorable.
Great vid..no need to say more..💪👍👍
Gentle giants, I loved this episode!
kind of ironic because in the beginning of the video it’s the world strongest men wearing skirts (i know that’s what people from scotland wear)
And this proves what?
For sure one of the funniest videos on the channel!!! Loved EVERY minute. All of you are such great and funny guys
It's crazy to think I probably weigh as much as one of their arms
Watching this video was genuinely a pleasure. The Stoltman Brothers are a pride of Scotland, and of general humanity. So humble, thoughtful, and hilarious!
they literally are the definition of gentle giants
Love the shout out to Halfthor and Eddie of course. Love their YouTube channels!
Best brother Masallah
Tom was inspiring
Wonderful video guys! Actually brought tears to my eyes. I grew up with bodybuilders and other athletes sooo ya great stuff! And I want that Nordictrack! Lol! Thanks 🙏🏼
I know  everything isn't about Covid these days, but WOW!!!  Nice to see a competition in a country that has less restrictions on masks, and gatherings!!!  When was this event?  November 2021???  How's the cases in Scotland???
this was such a funny video !!! what a good vibe and energy ! much love for you all
Love it guys
I Love these Big Boys!! lol at 62 and emphysema they motivate me, (I need walking and light weight) but I wish I could be just a towel gal for them to watch them work, GO BOYS!! Loved this Sooo Much!
Watching him put that stone on the blue tower was so inspiring! The strongest men in the world were weak compare to that.
Luke is what every big brother should be. Lifting up instead of putting down. Kudos to him.
She says: I'm g I going to get my brothers  Tiny and Bones. Me: go get your brothers b@#ch They come walking down the street  Me:  I'm out !!✈✈✈✈
What an amazing story.  Loved every second of it!!!! Amazing!!!
Your back probably hates you after trying to lift that big ball
Cool guys, great video.
COME TO INDIA I STAY IN NORTH EAST INDIA  WHERE PLAINS AND MOUNTAIN MEET EACH OTHER #SEEKDISCOMFORT
Strong men are alpha protectors, no perverts, no abusers. Just good men.
Those two guys could push a truck if they wanted to, considering both of them lift 400kg like it is nothing.
this is so incredibly cute <3
If you're still in Glasgow guys I'd love to invite you for a dinner 😍
Is it just me or was this very sussy
Damn i think i found my inspiration the guys are awesome
*Definitely absolutely nothing gay about this at all.*
What a fantastic video!
They finally came to scotland
Do the Chadar Trek in Leh Ladakh India. It’s a Trek on frozen Zanskar River where temperature drops to -30 degrees.
Honestly. 100kg is fucking impressive.
5:33 the man at the right looks so huge compered to the midle guy.
Dude I could never. My anorexic a*s watching this 💀 I eat 1-2 small meals a day
3:26 so they sleep in the same bed naked... this is so yass and slay
I think the name suits them. In norwegian stoltman means proud man..  they got so mutch too be proud of. That strength is really impressive 👏 💪🏽
Great video, I love the Gentle Giants ‼️❤️
this was unexpected but very entertaining xD
10,000 calories a day! That's what sumo wrestlers eat each day too.  I guess if you eat like that you are going to be big no mater what.
Yes, that's about as Scotish as you can get. Or does it?
this is so fucking clickbait, we know those guys
Fucking advertisements make this way less palatable...  Otherwise, this is a truly fascinating watch!
they got the THOR energy inside them
😂😂😂
whahaha 5:45 that look on his face like a little boy that has a proud father
I loved this!!
I absolutely loved this video, it was hilarious. Shoutout to those two gentle giants.
Eric is a lowkey beast
My sister is 15 and has autism she has her ups and downs like everyone else I wish me and her was strong like these guys so she can beat up the bully's I'm 10 and I take up for my sister bcuz I love her
Cuteist worlds strongist man hands down and just grenrly two realy sweet and nice dudes
https://youtube.com/shorts/z5H5Q_T0xd8?feature=share
#seratoninboost
I'm 70kgs THAT'S CUTE INIT !! 🤣🤣🤣
they’re such gentle giants🥺🥺
ngl wasn't expecting their voices to be that deep.Also they're wholesome dudes
These guys are the coolest, and now you have literally the strongest men on earth as defense if anyone messes with you guys XD
Could you fucking imagine knowing Tom as a kid and then seeing him now?
litteraly the funniest thing ever seeing him lift those things after they called him weak
2:11 thats not glasgow, thats oban
Dang, giants eat a LOT.
At 6:00 watching them eat breakfast is like watching the dwarves eat at Bilbo’s house in the first hobbit 😂 the food just never ends
Such an uplifting video. I sat grinning the whole time!
Someone introduce these guys to American football
The arm wrestling scene 🤣
This is the loveliest video I saw in a while. The brothers are so wholesome.
They made me a bit more nice to humans ❣️❤️ in love with their optimistic approach to life ❤️
I love them. So kind giant teddy bears, just like me :)❤️❤️🤝
best thing is when they said they brought the weakest man they could think of and he turns out to be the strongest out of all of em (3 guests).
Luke doesn't have vocal cords. He has elevator cables.
I nominate these 2 guys as being the coolest guys on Youtube 2021!
ultimate bro trip
I wish I was taller, I wish I was baller..
If William Wallace marched with these Lads, history would have been rewritten.. The Strength of the Scott's unmatched. Loved watching this. Amazing giants - Awesome gents.. 💪
At 2:13 when you flash up Glasgow, pretty sure that's Oban. about 2 hours away from Glasgow. :D minor detail.
Because one was not enough.   We got a second one, for good measure.
Bruh theyre so nice lol unexpected
That NordicTrack seems awesome but the thought of how much that would cost frightens me 😳
steroids way of life
WHITE HISTORY, ME, I, .... THE FIRST 1000 YEARS AGO AT THE BEGINNING OF EVERythigG :D
What a heart attack coming... eating like shit.  I appreciate your kindness, fuck abuse go vegan.
Eat big, Lift big.
soft heart in the strongest body
they are some of the most genuine and kind people i've ever seen, they're so awesome
Bunch of strong wet men 🥰🥰🥰 what a beautiful sight to wake up!!!
اللهم اهدهم للإسلام
this is so great to see them achieve what they struggle for loads of love and respect for these two champs
Gentle giant
The world's largest teddy bears.
That video made me feel so inadequate as man and inspired to be better.
This is the best video I’ve seen in a long time! Awesome! Great Job! You made another huge fan
Amazing  watching these Men just waooooooooo.
Doesn't know alot of giants, but Stoltman Brothers are definitely one(two) of the chillest giants out there.
14:18 i don't know this channel but i felt pride for that dude. Atlas stones are rough
ABSOLUTE KINGS
Was that you doing judo!??? That’s awesome !
Why lionize steroid abusers?
video amazing. you guys are crazy. big guys are fantastic sample of healthy human character
Giant hide n seek lmao
strongest? they look fat not buff
Love you guys ❤️
Why, if these guys do what they do, can't they maintain a  decent body fat ratio?  In the 80's when I was an employee of the fitness industry, guts like that would not have been acceptable.  Healthy diet, anyone?  Bring on the fat-shaming reeeeee tirade!!
I think they're called the Scottish Highlands, not the Scotland Highlands. Somebody probably already mentioned it but I can't trawl 6000+ comments in the time I have left on earth. But an interesting and entertaining video since I assumed (incorrectly) that Iceland was home to the world's giants.
The sheer size of these brothers is fucking terrifying. Then you see them and they're chill dudes having a laugh like any other. Epic video, enjoyed it
These two giants are gentle as kittens but strong as mountains!
I definitely heard a crack  at 18:25
For heaven's sake, will somebody PLEASE give these two guys space marine armour!
These guys are the sweetest people i have ever seen
Absolutely brilliant video 🤜🤛
Jeezus they look like they could forge swords, hammers, and all kinds of weapons in a day!
Not only strong but such a beautiful low voice too
This was really wonderful
You Exercise?? Really?? Damn..maybe start lifting? Like pullups? Or curls? Or deadlifts? Bench press...something!
these guys are built like doomslayer
I am happy for eric 😊
"I weigh 70 kilos" "That's cute"
if these guys just scram at me i'd collapse
i feel ive seen this before
That vid was way cool! You all had a lot of genuine fun , Thanks for sharing.
I love that these guys just found a tyre place and turned it into a gym XD
I love how informative, yet entertaining this video was. I didn’t expect to see the world’s strongest men when I opened YouTube today but it was definitely worth clicking on the video.
what about covid 19 come on guys wtf
lmaoo eric beat all those other 2 that were trolling him. lmaooo get emmm
As a guy who struggles to have a proper way of training life, getting to live a day in the life of these guys would be my biggest dream come true.  Keep making great content, guys. You're the best!
I absolutely loved this!! I laughed so hard! and even teared up a little! Having Aspbergers i understand what it feels like to feel out of place and awkward around "normal" people (now recognise as neuro-typical people). Love seeing that people can still have a good life no matter what life throws at them. God bless and Jesus loves you! Amen.
He sounds like a normal guy but with a Darth Vader mod over his voice.... with -2 pitch... Throw on that iconic Glasgow accent and you really do have a voice of a legend. He could look like a 90 lbs nerd with a sponge-bob T-shirt, rocking crocs and I STILL would not fuck with that guy FROM HIS VOICE ALONE. (I wouldnt fuck with anyone anyways, I hate bullies) but you get the idea.
🌹
omg they’re literally how I imagined the Vicario twins to look like
All I can think of is you're going to get a hernia .  Apart from their size, what strikes me is what clean living people they are, so nice.
This has been my favorite vid of Yes Theory! I was smiling the whole time 😃😂
Take an adventure to where the famous general Byrd claims to exist..  Go to  Agartha .. it would make the ultimate adventure
love these guys, great story, very motivating
So are you like 6'7" and they're 7'5"?  I'm new here as a little manlet 5'6"
0:53 Should say the Scottish Highlands 2:13 That's Oban it's literally 100 miles away from Glasgow Thats all
❤️❤️❤️❤️
eggserize ;)
*Race Unlocked: Giants*
Imagine being picked up like your nothing.... I did that to a stripper once... Her face was priceless
All you fellas seem like good guys.  Lots of fun watching this.  Well done, fellas.   To the Stoltman Brothers.    You've earned your success.  Be sure to enjoy it, and to pay it forward.  Cheers.
Hey
4:50 need to get some breakfast 😌
Great to see the Stoltman brothers getting the exposure they deserve, they are people who should be celebrated
Best than Netflix. Thats quality content!
I CHUFFIN' PUNCHED THE AIR when he hit that atlas stone lift! GET IN!
Random question but does anyone remember what the video was where Matt (?) was talking to some of his idol on some event and they were pretty much ignoring him?
As iron sharpens iron man also sharpens man
It's like the fellowship of the ring
i loved this so much <3 so wholesome. the hide and seek skit was hilarious LOL
@5:54  The faces of the 2 dudes on the right, lol
It's so sweet how affectionate they all are with one another. 🥰
I think this was amazing to watch. But I can't get over how silly Luke was at 3:27. That just shows how much of a nice, but silly goofball he is. Such an amazing experience too. : D
so funny
Lol the slomo had me 😂😂😂😂
Can't find my words...!
i dont wanna be slapped by them
This was an awesome video!
DUDE THAT PICTURE WITH THE LITTLE GIRL IS THE WHOLESOMEST THING IVE SEEN IN MY LIFE
I'm do also have autism #strongest,man #autism 💯😄😯😢
I think this is my favorite video this season! So much joy & laughter❤ thank you!
What great siblings!
Two real-life teddybears. Absolutely lovely!
The title should be: "I spent a day with 2 hydraulic press"
both of them are amazing
They seem like such nice people :)
I have autism and Tom gives me hope. Thank you for being so awesome and showing the world we're not useless just because we're autistic. <3
Just found out even Biscuit Oliva eats 10k calories a day....Must be a 'worlds strongest man' thing
As a skinny 150 cm tall woman I am just thinking how tiny I would look compared hahaha
Awesome this looked like so much fun!
This why Europe is afraid of Vikings. Look at that! They're monsters. AHHHH! REAL MONSTERS!
Real life magni and modi
Favourite video I've ever watched hands down
I am from Puerto Rico, but I love the Scotland Instruments and Music. It has a deep feeling when I listen to it.
Lads, great video, well done..... I've followed these guy's for years and they're everything they appear to be, absolute gentlemen.... Great role models for everyone, young and old......!  Ya got yourself a new subscriber on the back of this video, Irish Viewer...!
Fucking epic
My god! This video was pure wholesomeness all way thru! Loved it ❤️❤️
tbh I thought Vikings were myths lol😁😁
5:57 should’ve been the thumbnail 🤣🤣
As a middle-aged man, doing some casual kayak race training, I needed 3500 calories a day just to maintain my weight.  So 10 000 for these giant guys is absolutely believable.   Terrific video, great to see some big scottish guys in the news.
4:33 man even his voice is heavy...
I really hope men like these visit every sperm back in Europe.
Amazing production, story and dynamic! Congratulations. You guys are great!
Not gonna lie, they look like the nicest guy on the planet.
Max Verstappen cameo at 0:40
Im here for Eric WOOOHOOOOO 🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
This is GOLD! Loved everything about it! ❤️
so nice
Their speedo's are the real MVP
These guys are so sweet even though they could crash them with fingers =) =) =)  Show that the real human is inside :-)
Man those guys were the coolest dudes
Those brothers...💘💖💗
Yaaasss, makes me want to get up off my arse and start throwing the bells around again.  Lets get massive!    I never seen Glasgow look so much like Oban before, must be the weather.
I don’t know how this video passed me by but I’m only just now watching it and I’m from Scotland and haven’t been home in two years (thanks covid) and I’m not kidding hearing their accents I started to cry 😭
I’m Scottish and these guys make us so proud man
they both may be the strongest men in the world but they both are one of the most wholesome and kind hearted people in the world.
Awesome video!  These brothers are like the most nicest people in the world. You boys though are awesome! Fun watching the video and seeing you puny boys baaahahahahaha.
Love from Kerala , India 💕
Never judge a book by its cover, well said! The "weakest" indeed.
We really truly enjoyed watching you guys enjoying🥳🥳💚
truly strong men. HATS OFF STOLTMAN BROTHERS!!
*applause plays* Captions: “Music to my ears” *music plays* Captions: “Applause to my ears”
They are legends
Thanks for showing a softer and more human side to these huge humans. The playing at the end was funny
the whole video was wholesome
this is so cool
That strong boys just *KILLING IT* and so sincere. Genuinely humble lads! It supposed to be fun video innit? But I'm actually touched!
I hope all the strongmen could come together to try and pull the US Ferdinand Magellan Armored Rail Car to see if they could pull the 120 ton vehicle. Sounds like a great event, hope this could happen
This video warmed my soul and I just love those 2 !! 💞
Dude on the right in the thumbnail just looks like my dad lol
It's because Eric is Russian haha. Every Russian I've met is super strong despite looking skinny. It's genetics.
This is so wholesome
You know, I rarely subscribe to anything. It’s a huge turn off when somebody says to like and subscribe and hit that button this button and all that. But for some reason, the way you do it doesn’t bother me. You have a great content. It seems very genuine, unlike many out there. Not going to name names, but Mr…B.. yeah. He’s a narcissistic person that pretends to care to make money.  Anyways, I’m subscribed. Love your adventures and attitudes. God speed on to the next one. I’ll be watching. Thank you.
what no synthol?
I had a a hard day and just watched this video and I can’t stop smiling 🙂 Thank you 🙏 so much 🙏
Thank you, thank you, thank you for keeping masculinity strong and alive in this age when being a man is almost a sin.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for keeping masculinity strong and alive in this age when being a man is almost a sin.
It was sooooo funny to spend time looking at this video... I had as much fun as you did!  Cheer from Quebec
Gentle giants are real indeed ^^
Just some shirtless men eating breafest
This video of dope! Never had so much fun watching a video like this before on this level. Great Job!
Says “ in Iceland.” And a few other countries.   Shows Paul Bunyan and John Henry
Fun to watch and a positive message too. Nice!
They are literal giants this is so cool
It's "The Scottish Highlands", not "Scotland Highlands". Can this be corrected?
Nice To Know my AR-15 Can kill a Giant & a God . i fill  very safe  being a small guy in 2022 pop pop big man down
nice friendly gaints
I think this is one of the best vids I've ever seen on Youtube. Beautiful people.
5:54 😅
I love this video
you think them big boys get food stamps
So funnie man class I'd love to go I'm tiny lol but have musle lol. 😉
Awesome fun guys!
5:53 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
❤️❤️
Throw back, who remembers when Bishop ribbed Luke when Tom beat them both?! “ at least I’m the strongest in my family” Brilliant
eddie hall watching this:...
Favorite part of the video is watching the little guy do all of the work outs 💪 awesome
18:25 that crack in Thomas arm sounds like he was about to break your arm off 😂
the brothers are such humbled people despite being the strongest being in the world. I love to see it <3
i love the stoltman brothers
imagine getting railed by those two guys
We also enjoy to see this video thank you team
Anything is possible with Steroids, just sayin.
THE MAN'S VOICE!!! That's how I'd imagine the giants sounding like. My goodness
Can there voices be anny deeper ?
Well, It's just boys hanging out, people.
i want the stoltmen as friends they seem like such down to earth chill dudes
I thought you stopped making videos! Im glad you didn't!
These guys really are big friendly giants
The humor in this is great as well
These guys are awesome. Thanks for giving us a look into their lives.
Scarry Voice :o
These guys pee testosterone
This was soo wholesome to watch. The a Stoltman Brothers are literally humble and friendly guys add to the fact they are THE strongest men. I really enjoyed watching this and the production was topnotch!! Thank you all for giving us a snippet into who you live, your culture and stories.
bros beat autism lifting heavy ass shit wow
Thor and Eddie Hall!? How about Brian fuckin' Shaw!? Who won it multiple times.
Absolutely awesome video, I smiled from beginning till end. You guys are all too cool.
What a great video! The two brothers look so sympathetic and fun to hangout with!
Please come to meghalaya India
Not only they're phisically big, they have a big heart too
GREAT VIDEO,ENJOYED WATCHING IT :) WELL DONE :) GOPS from London :)
Scottish Islands bro not Scotland Islands
11.38 mins. Loooool.
This made my day, wow this video is so positive it just makes me happy
Watching you sitting in the middle of the Big Brothers eating breakfast, I was thinking, " Don't eat him!" 😮😂
why are your dislikes gone
This is legit.
Its crazy how some of the strongest men in the world are also some of the nicest and coolest people ever
brutal mogging
You guys are so good at editing. I didn’t think I’d be interested in this episode at all but it turned out to be quite funny
Where’s gigachad
I absolutely loved this…
Wholesome af
is it sad that i just want a hug from them
they looked like dolls beside these 2 men, omg no way will you diss these 2 guys, then can pinch you out of existence lol
Goliath would have been terrifying!
The Bros even have giant voices lol.
I got a belly like the feller on his left...does that make me a giant too?
Damn! I wanna hang out with those giants too! Where do I sign up? Take my money!
giants were and ARE real...not mythology...but a complete white washing and cover up
awesome... 5:58 or so, all sitting topless on the breakfast table.  that is some funny shit.
That’s how vikings looked no cap
this guys sound like they swallowed a subwoofer xD
their voice dude, that's some low tone eh... wow! 10k kcal everyday hahahhaah
Awesome! I dont know them, never met them, probably wont meet them in the future, yet I really like them. Wish you gentle giants the best, a happy and healthy life!
The bit at the start where it says Glasgow but shows an aerial view of what I think is Oban which is a different Scottish town further north.
Loved it
They seem super nice and fun.  Good guys.
They like to eat a lot and lift weights… that’s cool but why do they all never have a shirt on? Even when eating???
Those dudes seem like two of the realest down to earth guys in all of sports not just strongman.  Awesome Vid
Great video👌
Most people I know from school that are huge now started off big. Like they were always pretty big kids in terms of muscle mass and bone size. So to see literal giants come from skinny kids is absolutely insane and more motivating than most of these fitness influencers.
Great Stuff!
6:53 :)
Come and spend a day with me so I can tell you and how you how I survived 2 tumors, and lost 75 KG! (165.345) pounds, I'm in Central Europe :) and I would love to share my story with you to motivate everyone around me to become a better versions of who they are... P.S.: Also became a solo skydiver.
As a guy with mild dyslexia when the younger strongmen with autism said about beating “24 other normal guys even though i was autistic i had a disability” that just made my heart sank in warmth and comfort:,)❤️ as because of my disability i was always the odd one in one way or another,downplaying my own self esteem below the “normal peoples”. You both are superheroes.😇 for me atleast!
Cool video. I think I know why the "weakest" guy out of the 3 is the strongest but there's not much evidence in this video. It looks like he might have the highest degree of fascial tension which can be spotted in the anterior tibial tendon where the foot meets the shin when you were at the beach. Also the tendons in his hands. It's a different thing than muscle based strength. Check out the work of Chong Xie you will be amazed. *Edit I found his instagram and in one picture you can see his feet and yes it looks like he might have it. It's called fascially morphed feet or hyperarch mechanism.
big respect to all you boys amazing content!!
Holy!!! I´ve witnessed the best voice ever :O
Meanwhile im sitting here waiting for  my back to stop hurting so i can walk
Increible... mmuy bueno!!
That part of trolling Eric is 🤣
🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪..
where rule 34
Come to Kenya...
EZEEEEESIZE
Obviously the Eric guy is working out.
These 2 Brothers are awesome! would love to spend at least a Month with them and just challenge myself physically and mentally 🤙🏽
mannn this way so heart warming to watch!
I've been smilling through out the whole video, they are and gentle too, I think they should build up their own adventure park
"Ay nade tah get som bdeckfast" accent is sick!
these guys are like gentle giants! id love to hang out with these guys ive watch their competitions my god! its intense
amazing video, inspiring!
give me smellng salts
Damn you guy's Tom's story made me ball❤💪
Love that the smallest dude showed everyone out....us lil dudes pack a punch ❤💪🦇
And now imagine 1000 years before u have to fight these two warriors sword against sword.
So much appreciation and connection and joy coming through! Such a pleasure. Thank you!
That water drop effect when he jumped in * chefs Kiss* to the editor.
This was the most joyful 20mins video I've seen. I was smiling and laughing the whole time.
Just amaizing Stoltman brothers. Amaizing guys doing amaizing things. Love your content
You guys had so much fun 😁. Such gentle giants 🤭
this is brilliant 🤣🤣🤣
dude sounded like kratos
This energy is so powerfull to watch!!
Shit literally Started Like A movie Hahhh
The sounds effects though 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jjjjeeeezzzzzz! tf
3:33 ... salute from Wim Hof's fan.
i love this. but that treadmill just reminds me of that one episode of black mirror
4:10 are you kidding me with that sound effect lmao
18:33 gave me a good chuckle because at one point that was sorta relatable for me. In high-school I did mma and worked out a shit ton. Also might be notable I'm considered tall where I live and was definitely tall for my age, i got pretty "swol" and most of my freinds were older so I'd get drunk with them at parties. If cops showed up I'd try to "act natural" but nothing looked natural about the massive baby faced emo kid.   Also remember kids don't drink underage, it's bad.
I love this episode! It's fun to watch and funny too! 🤯😁
Come to Bangladesh
This is why i love Thor's design in GOW people have wrong conception what a strong man should look like.
I loved all of this
Bro they’re so nice like huge teddy bears
These gentle giants are adorable.
these guys are so chill and cool! I want to hang out with them!!!!
Scottish accent is one of the sexiest accent in the world.
5:15am UK time, 20 minutes ago I came back from gym, I was having my meal while watching this video. You guy made my day. Ta xxx
Great video. Great people.
Pls take them for marvell his voice like thorrrrr 🤩
If you ever want to come out to La Digue in Seychelles let me know I'll have a blast.
one guys voice is insanely deep... villain type deep... he should record audios
These dudes are great haha.
I never thought that giants can be so cuddly and friendly! AND CUTIES!
I mean no disrespect but with the shirtless clip of you all at the table the 3 of you guys look like you've literally never used a muscle before. lol
Hm
i'm in love with the sheer production quality of your content. the content is just great and everything is just awsmm.
These guys were awesome
Bro wtf they eat whole cows
As a big man with autism, Tom gives me inspiration to go big or go home. These guys are so wholesome, God bless ‘em.
This was awesome. Guys rock!
sick
Worldest strongest men hugged each other for everything. That means something! ❤️
So have guys ever been to the yukon in canada
19:06 WHOA THERE.....PAUSE
Stoltman brothers are awesome. Such great hospitality and respect from the brothers. What a blessing to be able to see that country and hang with those guys. A dream come true, I’m sure. God bless y’all stoltman brothers! May God give you strength and health.
12:11 when you bring in all the groceries in one trip
Props to eric
our corp vpn is down and this is the best thing ever.
straongman's voice is naturally 15 octaves lower than the little guy's.
OMG this was so adorable to watch.................. <3 so freaking cute!
Giant in Clash of Clan in real life. Awesome
The thing is The giants in the viking saga were probably 5 meters or less. Because humans were way smaller
They're not giants. They're young mountains..
Used to throw tree logs as far as we could for fun
Good times, I got the giant highlander genes from my dad. Relateable, used to be on a 6000 calorie daily diet just to maintain my weight.
Come to world smallest and largest river islands. In India 🌈
Eric wtf? Why havent you posted on your own channel mannnnn i miss your videos
this was awesome thanks for the experience
Best doco ever.
well.. the russian guy did it
I truly feel sorry for what this channel has become
Straight up snorted coke before the without and nobody is batting an eye
I also need two friendly kindhearted giants in my life! :)
I was watching this for fun, but was taken in by how sweet the brothers are. And then I learned about Tom's autism. I am also autistic. This really warmed my heart. Thank you.
I love Scottish accent
The brothers are inspirational 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Have a newfound respect for all of ya💪🏻
3:06 that was 🔥
I wonder if you’ve ever done something like this with mma?
What amazing positive video 🔥🔥
Eric being the strongest made the video
I think after mma I’m gonna become a strongman.. heavyweights have always been my first love
of course he`s scottish... 😒
God I love them saying “how are you so strong” I don’t know why but it actually made me happy lol.
are these guys typically on steroids?
They're the true GIGA CHAD !!
being strong is pretty cool!
son meme pas forts juste gros plein de suif lolll
12:37 he is Russian.
exhausted after watching this🤣😅
this was so freaking wholesome they're two huge dudes who are basically just teddy bears. Awesome job. This is awesome male bonding too btw, thank you for showing us this.
Thor from  God of War  Ragnarok
Eric and Tommy seems for me like the same person 😅
18:26 I his hand ok? That crack :))
Hope you had a great time in my country 🇬🇧❤️
I know its meant to be "oh they work out so hard to be this big" but like damn you need to be born built to look like that.
Fantastic video and a couple of really decent blokes
This is great video love it 😍😍Great job guys!
Hilarious and super interesting to see how these giants live. Can't wait to see what else you have in store for us in November!!
This video was enough to raise my testosterone
Oh boy, the amount of things that could've gone wrong in this madness experience...
Having the batman voice as your real voice is freakin badass
This was so much fun to watch 😄😄😄
this was the most wholesome video :D
it's the voice for me! These bros are bros thru and thru!!! sheeeesh! iono about eating all of that breakfast food but they must be doing some right cuz they are winning!
Nice video, it felt sus until 18:35 seems familiar lol
Amazing
Eric just got a stone more sexy after lifting that tower of manliness
best ever post.  could not stop laughing.
Holy shit their voices match their frames!
It's too bad you're annoying fratboyesue dbags cause you talk to some interesting people.
my backs hurting from watching this video 😂😭🥲
I’ve been crying for 2 months. Thank You so much for this video. I Love These Guys!!!!
step 1: be born massive
I just cant get right with the left hand drive in various countries.  even though ive done it.  love the functional lifting tho
3:24 when stepbro sees you still sleeping 5:50 stepbro vibes
Man these boys are awesome
The best video ❤️❤️❤️
Most awesome video Guys!! Loved It!!
They are not strong, they are just big enough to lift those weights. I only believe in Extraordinary people with real superhuman gift featured in Stanley superhuman.
Spend thanksgiving/Christmas with a subscriber :))
is eric related to giants?
Has to be one of my favorite videos from you guys!!!!!! SERIOUSLY! <3 Followed you for so many years.
Eric LITERALLY became a fucking legend after this video!!!!!!!! OMGGGG
He's under the lamp!🤣🤣
What was in those smelling salts?! LMAO! Whatever it was it made the weakest man the strongest. So fun to watch!
Best. Video. Ever. These guys are amazing.
Awesome video 👍👍
This was a lovely video
this looked like the most fun ever. genuine humans. imagine how much fun it would be drinking with those big lads.
Hard not to be charmed by these two gentle giants. Curious as to why the question of performance enhancing drugs never came up in the program. Is that a taboo subject among professional strongmen? is it considered impolite to inquire about? or insulting? Or does everyone in the community simply assume the obvious?
Great video, do you know that Stoltman, is allmost the same as Stolt Mand in Danish, which means Proud Man ;-D
Luke is totally my type... Lord, give me the strength, I'm sooo attracted rn.
Love your channel guys!! so inspirational. Keep doing what you do!!
I think I love Scotland men now !!!💖💖💖
The best, most uplifting video i've ever watched. Such amazing Brothers that can compete at that level and still be themselfes! Big up to the Stoltman Brothers!  They kind of gave me a confidence boost! 🥳🤘
That was the funniest episode I watch 🤣🤣🤣 so funny!! Love it guys ! ❤️❤️
you were in glasgow and we didnt know about it! please let us know next time and come along to my tech lab
cool
Dude this was hilarious, thoz dudes r massive. Jus stand by me when we out at da club
Imagine if you were a soldier during medieval war and u were supposed to fight them.
ok but why r u naked 😂
Nice to see two friendly men.
I'm jealous of that brotherhood, I wish I had such a motivation and a rival next to me when I grew up
Seem like genuinely nice guys
3:06 shivers
Haha soo funny
"this is what happens when you bring Eric, have fun doing the dumbest shit"  "very nice" 😁👍
Oh, wow!  This was awesome!
they are so big but also so cute lol
The only disability is ones refusal to adapt.
18:26 did you hear the crack 💀
These brothers are awesome with an amazing personality. Thanks for sharing (Hide and seek with the giants was the best 😂)
man this is so cool!! this life is supposed to be about! I love it!
I think when they were conceived the sperm was the size of tadpoles.
And the man who can lift heaviest weight is Lasha Talakhadze from Georgia
Such a great thing to see. They seem to be awesome people.
"What is this, a feather?" hahahaha
Come to Sri Lanka ♥️🇱🇰
Gotta say guys, you make some awesome videos and I came into this one not expecting anything too crazy but this was absolutely one of your coolest and funniest. I love these strong men, such good dudes and loved learning about their lives and about their passion
holy shit this is the best video on youtube
Man this was amazing to watch. I've seen the Stoltman Brothers compete on TV and online, but this was amazing to watch. I love videos like this.
Looked through the whole thing with an unshakeable grin from ear to ear !
This seemed like a great wholesome experience and those strongman Brothers are humble gentle giants. Wish the best and never change who they are
Nicest guys ever confirmed 🍺💪
this gives me more motivation then i already had
This video had me smiling from the start to the end, it was wholesome, i loved how humble this guys were and how cute, they seemed to me like mastiff puppies hahaha. I really enjoyed it, now my cheeks hurt because of how big my smile was <3
wtf!! i have so much respect to both of them more than ever listening to their story
Best video so far! Being from Scotland, really inspired! Keep it up!
🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
They deserve the best consistent athletes ❤️
I’m not jumping into cold waves at sunrise but this made my morning
I would just want to sleep after that much food 😆🤣🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
I guess i've lived in the wrong country  all my life. i'm 100 kg girl and single since i was born... and because of some injuries i cant go back to gym and boom my weight just skyrocketed...im gonna try again and i'm not giving up yet on losing weight because no one would love me if i looked like this, esp in my country. Wish i could meet my first love...men in my country only love thin and light skin girls, its the beauty  standard in my country. I hate that i tried to be something i don't. Thank you so much for this video #pardonmyenglish
That hide and seek 🤣
Tom and Luke are just so precious, especially after hearing Tom's story and how Luke was just the big brother. My big brothers are still like Tom, even though I am bigger and stronger and earn more money than them. I would not trade my big brothers and sisters for the world. No matter how successful I become, I will forever be their baby brother and that's the greatest gift I could ever have asked for.
this is the manliest scream i have heard of
The Stoltman Brothers are so humble. It just makes you love them, without even knowing them.
This is a lime 😂
Holy shit, that was wholesome.
The blooper 😅
This video is like SO cool
You Stoltman boys are so sweet, loving and inspiring! <3<3<3 Those bear hugs! <3<3<3
This is the kind of production quality that should explain why conventional TV is being outclassed and outsmarted.   *_Great quality! The Stoltman Brothers and Yes Theory are galactic treasures and should be cherished dearly!_*
Might want to look into Polynesia men as well. Most notably Samoans and Tongans
oh i loved this . i enjoyed so much .can't stop laughing
Inspirational! As a fellow Scot I couldn't be prouder of them!
I wonder how often they have to poop 💩 a lot I bet 😂
It’s not Gay if you just touch tips
eric is Hercules incarnate
enjoyed this video a lot more than I thought I would
Dexterity build vs strength build
Great episode Yes Theory, thankyou S Bro's for sharing!
Hahaha this video made me laugh so hard! Good job guys!
Tell a skinny guy he’s weak 😂 he will for sure out lift you… if there’s a will there’s a wayyyy
The editing on this had me in tears!  Both with laughter and emotion. Excellent job, guys!
Your video is good
I love these brothers so much! They have the best attitude ever! I would totally try all the “being strong stuff’’ with them - even being the most ridiculously weak person you can find - just for the company!  Don’t you guys want to adopt me as a sister? ❤️❤️❤️
this video was filled with so much testosterone i grew half my beard in this 20 min
Brian Shaw still bigger than both dudes easily lol
my favorite thing is when the "weakest" guy outdid those silly expectations. YEAHHHHH
I smiled the whole video!
This is wholesome!
Another yes theory vid in rock climbing, Fighting a fear of heights from climbing rocks?
What happens if you eat 10000 calories a day?  Believe it or not, your body's stomach can actually expand quite far. So if you start to train your stomach to allow it to eat more, than you can eat 10000 calories in a day no problem. Here is the problem though, if you start to eat this amount of food, you will 100% get fat , there is no doubt about that. -Google
This is the place where my girl friend live... Siobain Kelly.  The great teacher
Im just so glad the "weakest guy" showed them all up underdogs for life.
Nah havent seen good content in a long time
80 kgs a hand!?.... I weigh 45 kilos  These dudes could throw me farther than I can see😭🤚
this might be my favorite one yet, pure joy the whole time! love it!
Been watching strongman competitions and the stoltman brothers are a beast. Also the nicest guys
Sooo much respect for the Stoltmans. Kindness goes a long way, and they have it by the kilos-even though they can toss a normal human!! keep up the great work. Stay safe. Stay healthy. Stay Blessed!😁
Seeing you guys at the breakfast table made me laugh so hard 😅
💪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
This one is by far my favorite video content because I laughed 😂 so hard that I Farted.🥴 👊🤣👍
Video about boys being boys
WOW...I am so loving you guys!  The fun you have together is infectious!
omg, you look so tiny next to them lol
Best video I have seen from you guys!
14:36 😂
4:45 Anyone notice that word Khushi is note on his chest By the way it is and Hindi word means happiness
That's weird, I don't see Brian Shaw
cringe
they look like children around them lol
Glasgow - the European city with the lowest life expectance. - by far... - more than 2 year lower than the second town, Belfast...
What is the bagpipe music   called at 3.07 in video?
What a waste of food. They feed exclusively on animal products.
Thomas is a judo black belt?!?!?
omg ive a crush on a giant.. they look so tough but these guys are such softies       *_*
5:47 i love it
This is the most wholesome video I have ever seen
I love this channel. Please keep it up 🤗
The most adorable giants !
This is why the Stoltman brothers are some the best strongmen on the planet and great oversized human beings as well. God bless you
5:54 this is gonna look weird if my dad walks in
Just up the road from me I live in Dundee nice one lads
Awesome!
I guess the weakest man brought on the trip was the one who called out Eric for being weak, karma is fast 😂.
Holy shit their voices are amazing
Such an enjoyable video, thank you for producing this ✌🏻
Man loved this episode/ video. I would like it so much if another episode with the stoltman brothers is coming. Like a hike video in scotland or something where you race each other to an end mark. Loed it that much, that it would be great to see another episode with them :D
Man these dudes are so damm likeable!!
So these are the giga chads amongst giga chads.
This was the serotonin I needed in my life today. Thank you guys!
This video was sus am I the only one??
One of the few videos on youtube that actually had me laughing
I really enjoy the interaction and the bond between the brothers. Luke has been a great big bro.
That was so much fun!
Eric better fits Yes theory than Buzzfeed 💓🥰
this is the most wholesome thing ive watched in a while
definition of with the boys
Levi is somewhere sharpening his blade scoffing at this video and laughing at their extinction he caused
18:25 lmao heard a crack
Can't wait till humans can lift mountains
The Nordictrack plug made me want to thumbs down and search for other content. ….and I really really like Yes theory
I just love how all these strongmen (except for maybe Eddie Hall at times) are the nicest most humble people you could ever meet!
Boom boom chao
Wow, nuff  said
Amazing video, thanks for all, i laught soo much after 10:51 by smasching this bags :D
This was honestly one of their funniest videos I’ve ever watched. I DIED at the Giant Hide and Seek part😭 and my love for Eric quadrupled after this😂
i wanna hear him say "BOY"
Brought a smile to my face throughout the video 🙂, way to go guys! Love from India ❤️🙏
I love these brothers! They have so much good in them, can feel the love they have for each other and kindness to everything around them.
3:36 what is the name of the song? Plz
imagine these brothers' mom, being the mother of not just 1 but 2 of the strongest people to have ever lived on this planet
I think if I try to lift any of that up, I'd probably fart my haemorrhoids out......
Don’t know about strongest.. definitely nicest 😂
Amazing video. Amazing sport. Mens sana in corpore sano .
I like men with big bodies.... They're the sexiest guys ever. More meat to love..... 😍😍😍😍
so wholesome :)
Try to live with David Goggins for a week, I'm pretty sure you're going to change to ''FUCK NO Theory'' after that...
Such a great story! 👏
sympathetic, these guys
What is that game called the last one with spin
Watching this both makes me want to train as I've always dreamed of competing in a form of the worlds strongest man. But also makes me want to visit the brothers just to hang out and enjoy them hahah
this is incredible...this brothers are gem
These guys can literally have some dumb shit with Kim Jong Un and befriend him😂
These are the type of people I depict when I think of Vikings
Yes Theory... doing their thing.. inspiring us
That’s not human godam
I'm a small time Strongman competitor, here in the USA, the luxury of these pro athletes just hoping in the car, to go down to the beach to swim in ice cold water... Meanwhile I had to let my gas utilities go so I can afford entry in local circuits, and I take at least 2 ice cold showers everyday in the cold of winter, in a house without heat, in the Midwestern US. This is nothing! 🙄
why this video is so wholesome?????? greetings from Indonesia!
Stoltman brother win world nicest men
Was that boost at 10:50 Popper? 😂
come in the poorest country in the world to have some experiences
5:48 this is the moment I was like I really like these two they are humble.
Blessings From Texas🤠
Please what is the music that starts playing at 3:03  I've been looking everywhere for it.
Not watched anything to do with worlds strongest man for ages, watching this brought a lump to my throat. Thank you for sharing
The way Tom said "That's cute innit?". 🤣😂
eric has elite genetics
Are they natural?
even the voice sounds strong
This is awesome.
We see you read comments, are you Interested in hosting a Rock Paper Scissors Tournament for your Subscribers. It would be the World's Largest Tournament. We can help. Please let us know.
I don't think a voice has been more fitting for a big man.
Hey please visit Pakistan 🇵🇰
My background is Scottish and Im 6ft6 290lbs so I guess this makes sense lol
Okay, is the license plate on the blue car on purpose?  lmao
The breakfast scene was spectacular
Awesome
I want my own friendly giant
can i travel with u guys please :)
This is BEYOND DELIGHTFUL. Strongest men in the world, also the kindest and most chill. Inspiring!
Smiled and laughed at the pure joy of comradery and competition. Thanks for the uplifting story.
Those guys are absolutely awesome.So intimidating,yet so nice.
This is the craziest video I've seen in weeks, and on the internet that's saying a lot. Truth is I cried because of their kindness. Lovely show.
They're awesome people.. the world needs more people like them
Just like the Bible talks about “nephalem”
This what you call true brothers love.
Day 26. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
why am I crying... wtf are you guys doing here..    thank you :)
I pulled a Semi-Truck once... theyre not that heavy to pull actually
5:20 in you two look similar , he has a few inches on you height wise but I can barely tell you apart.
WOOW BESAR SEKALI
What nice guys. Great personality’s. Best of luck to everyone 👊 I subscribed 👊
best video you guys have made
Their voices are so deep that some parts I had to activate subtitles. So awesome, imagine how strong their vocal cords are. OMG
These guys, that strong but also looks so gentle and nice to me. 👍👍👍
Dislike
The best thing I've laid my eyes on in a long time ❤️
5:44 Tom’s slow smile and laugh made me so happy
I look these dudes right...and I feel like body builders doing olympia are bigger?  These guys should be bigger than Olympia guys, but I feel like if you took all the fat off them in this picture they wouldn't look nearly as big as the top Olympia guys.  And I get it, cause as I write this I'm thinking about functional strength, and what muscles are used the most for these guys, etc...but I always assumed that even though these guys are fatter they are a lot stronger than the biggest body builders, but looking at their physiques I'm just not seeing it.    If you put Phil Health at the table, his biceps DWARF these 2 dudes biceps imo.  Again though, as someone who had huge biceps and rest of my genetics sucked ass, I totally get how biceps don't mean much in most circumstances.  I could be way off on this btw, just my opinion on what I'm looking at.
Sulzer ned  guys Sulzer ned !
Bro i look at them and am like Those are true men
2:11 GLASGOW <shows picture of Oban>
I am imagining theses guy would lift me  only by using their pointer 🤣🤣
That voice,  real giants
Their voices are so deep that they sound like the distorted voice used to avoid voice recognition 😂
I'm a simple guy. I see strongman and I click
this mustve been 1 of the most fun vids ive seen in a long time the challenge at the end had me in tears
Please go to the zone of silence in Mexico. I want to find out what goes on their
Luke sounds like a bear
great vid, thanks for sharing!
3 tiny dudes eating with 2 muscley Scottish dudes while all shirtless is just the most entertaining thing I've seen all week
0:42 I'm just saying to anyone who is interested, On the picture it's a Greek giant named "Goliat" Also a great story about the fight.
when the weakest guy turns out to be the strongest. I would have loved to see omar doing these stuffs
The absolute best sibling duo on the planet
This is not an aesthetic presentation.Not impressed. There is a tenuous link between strength and outright belligerent aggression. There are many amongst us who have been on the end of toxic masculinity. No more.
This was so much wholesome really enjoyed it
This video was amazing! So inspiring and funny at the same time, loved it!
They seem like the perfect type of people to be friends with. This video will have me smiling all day. Thank you
Two amazing man!❤️
These are great guys to hang out with! Friendly giants and gentlemen, Greetings from Greece
They should go to wwe
!!!!! https://youtu.be/UpVPZkRykEE
Their so pink!.
“What is this?” …. “This is a lime”  I’M DEAD💀💀💀
Nice life story of this two brothers and I love Scotland. The advertising was a but to much this time.
this makes me so proud to be scottish! you cannot help but love our 2 famous gentle giants! 🤍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
You guys should come to Unst in Shetland, and see where the UK’s first space centre will be launching satellites from (it’s also the most northernly isle in the UK and has a very unique dialect / culture)
The strongest, most amazing and humble brothers in the world. Hit them up with a sub. They deserve it more than most.
a video of oban saying glasgow 😭😂
And yet there are some people that dislike these World is a bad place man 😰
Did anyone crap their pants in the making of this video?
Auntie liz would whoop everyone in a thumb war tourney
gentle giantsss<3
Honestly, between the accent and the low grumble I can't understand a single thing this man says XD
Badass video and much respect to these guys! I’ve been a Strongman fan for years and this gave me an insight to there lives! I’m a huge fan because of this video! Shaw man, still at the top of my list but a huge second for these brothers! SeMpEr Fi
I'm always glad to see Eric~
I want my children to have one of these mans genes if you catch my drift.
well I didnt see Mark Henrey, the self proclaimed worlds strongest men
I'm so happy Eric tabach join yall. Its was sad to see a talent like him not making it in YouTube great videos but algorithm weren't in his favour
The Stoltman brothers look huge compared to them.  But what if they met 4x World's Strongest Man,  3x Arnold Strongman Champion  Brian Shaw who was 440 lb and is who is 6'8.  Or The Mountain  3x Arnold Strongman Competitions 3 years in a row. Hafthor Biornson who was 450 lb and is 6'9.  And 335 kg / 738.5 lb Bench Kirill Sarychev 320 lb and 6'9
Proper lovable guys It's always the ones that you don't expect.
Real life naruto and sasuke
They shared a bed 🤔
id love to see these guys punch those boxing bag things in the pubs
Absolute Strength
That was awesome! They seem like great guys.
Jajajaja! Beautiful..
I suppose there is a "no shirt rule" when you are around these guys. Chill dudes definitely. I really enjoyed this video.
The voice... The voice ....
They are literally embodiment of the phrase gentle giant
you guys are BRILLIANT at editing videos.....i was genuinely laughing my ass off
Awesome ❤
Pretty enjoyable video!
Hello please come to Glastonbury in the UK and be on my podcast...pretty pretty please ☺️💜
Dudes surprisingly strong af
When did Oban become Glasgow?
He has such a beautiful deep voice
this vid was epic
THE ONLY THING BIGGER THAN THESE GUYS... ARE THEIR HEARTS!!!
Powerful story! Thank you 🙏
Someone please tell me the song at 3:07. It sounds so familiar
Day 25. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
anyone else automatically think of outlander??
this was an amazing video had me laughing, inspired me and motivated me all at the same time appreciate it. Much ALOHA from hawaii.
i’m a lesbian but i think i’m in love with eric???????
What a waste of what could have been an interesting day. 3 guys with the strength of chicks and not ashamed of themselves slap and giggle their way through a day of stupid questions with world champion strongmen.
These guys are so inspirational
18:58 best moment!!
they dont breathe oxygen like we humans do, they breathe argon
Totally a different type of respect after seeing this.  So cool to see regular guys trying out these workouts.
11:33 haha
👍👍
Man I'm much more stronger than the Stoltman brothers, in my dreams.
You should make a video about lucid dreams
The most wholesome content from some of the biggest guys in the world
Yeah this will get the kinda… *sugars going*
That picture is Oban not Glasgow
9:04 These people made Ford raptors look like minis 😂😂😂😂
Eric is a great addition to this group, so happy to see his face. Hopefully he joins for more videos!
Meeting in Glasgow, shows drone footage of Oban ahah!! Great video though!
fucking awesome
Great video.  Thanks for  sharing.  The Stoltman brothers are truly an inspiration... not only as athletes, but as human beings.  They help make the world a better place.
I love this video so much! You guys are so awesome and funny! ♥♥♥ laughing with you from zero to finish! Thank you so much! 😍
I feel like Eric has that Russian power and endurance 😂😂😂
They are so strong but yet so humble….❤️
These brothers are such lovely chaps
My Grandpa passed away 3 days ago and you're videos help me in this hard time. Thank you for what you are doing.  To anyone reading this: Hope you are feeling good and happy. Stay safe. Best wishes from Germany :)
This video and bgm is too good to sound like a movie .
Modern jaluts
This is the best contents ever!! I’m so glad I’m watching this and I’m writing this midway of the video😄!! Gentle of all Gentle Giants!! I love the Stoltman Brothers!! 🤙🏾🤙🏾
they sure look intimidating but the sweatest :))
Is it me or do the Stoltmans seem like two guys you wanna really hang out with?
Gentle Giants! Loved it🔥❤
It warms my heart watching this video and restored my faith in humanity.
These guys are amazing ! Great video
13:42 goosebumps
i am a 16 year old highschool graduate i would love to be in one of your videos

my name is james. james bond.  this guy sounds like sean connery
Y’all did him dirty with that water drop at 4:10 😂
It's crazy how their voices sound strong...
Where does that fluffy sweat shirt is coming?? 😍
Honestly I would be the size of their torso and I’m 5 foot
Such great and genuinely nice blokes.
Let’s go Brandon
i know that beach lol
The edits man 😆

I think it's universel that young brother is much taller than the elder brother.........
You were in my hometown! I wish I knew I would have loved to meet up
i even don't speak english, only i wana say you are so fucking amazing guys, i love you boys.
Don't measure a man by his strength, measure him by his eyes.
My Grandfather could lift the back end of out 77 Ford LTD when he was 70.
Great video with two of the nicest strongmen in the world.  I’ve met the boys at a couple of events and they have always been so gracious to the audience and their fans.
Or some of the people in the stonewall riots and ask them how they feel about what they have accomplished for generations to come.
Can you get in touch with one of the uruguayan 571 flight survivors?
I have the Nordic treadmill with IFit, it is a game changer for treadmills really interactive w terrain and listening to the trainer makes time pass easy plus has fire music choices
4:59 I am like what a life 😀 cheers to life 👍
They seem like amazing people to hang with
You guys have to do a video with Brian Shaw! Hes a 4 times winner of WSM and is the nicest person.
See guys, having a beer belly doesn't make you weak but instead makes you a real strongman like these guys, right?  Right...?  right...? :'(
just dudes being bros
Pleaseeeeeee upload more yall are my favorite channel on YouTube
God bless these Scots for the goodness that comes off of them. Much respect from the USA.
His chuckle laugh at 5:15 is amazing lol
Ive saw ur vid, in few min i subs, if u ever want to visit most beautiful island here in borneo... Love from Malaysia dude
Scotch Irish accent is great. The land, energy and nature of these  megabros had me laughing and changed my mood in a good way. I'm 37 and I'm fully ready to start looking at Scotland as a place to move with me and my wife. We always wanted land of our own to raise animals and kids on a farm. I'm pretty sure I have Irish in my blood. I'm a pretty big chill guy and could generally always hold my liquor when I used to drink alcohol. The icewater and clean air is almost palpable in this video. Thank you and keep up the great uploads! Best of luck to all you guys!
i've heard the song that's playing when they introduce they are in inverness, but can't name it. can anyone help me? the bagpipe one.
Lovely video 👍
Are there any other small channels out there that inspire to have a level of storytelling like Yes theory? Let's build a small community!
so much food how do u even digest that and have it come out without tearing up your intestince
Awesome video!
there are men stronger living around us and go to our local gyms they just dont train
15:34 I mean I was impressed AFFFF before but uh....
waluya rom Kenya should compete in these challenges
😭THE MAN SAID THAT CUTE ISN’T IT 💀 at 9:55
Day 24. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
so he could throw me across the room
The best line...  You guys have this much sweets? Yeah, you know, to get the sugar going... Hahaha, I love it. The Stoltman brothers are the best.
that's adorable !
Strongmen seem like the dopest people to chill with. I'd kill to hang out with Brian Shaw and Eddie Hall, now the Stoltmans
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQYLu5QsPTI&list=LL&index=1 (Interesting idea!)
Should have spent a day with Brian shaw
Wholesome as fuck, literally smiling ear to ear, fucking bunch of L E G E N D S
I want your voice. Such a lovely tone.
The fact that you were in Scotland that’s sick I’m from Aberdeen
Nordic Track.. What an Expensive Wank.. Just open your front door and go for a walk.. It's amazing how many people drive to the gym, pay money to exercise and then drive home.. Um just go for a walk in your neighbourhood, find hills to walk up and down.. and? It's free,  you would have to be a real sucker to pay for this crap..
These dudes are beasts, and they’re super chill. Awesome video guys
Stoltman Brothers are my and my sons super heroes
I’m kind surprise that i am taller ou than both off thème wtf
Ah legos incoming
Eric - WOW! Big time kudos to him. That's nothing to scoff at. Real strength right there.
I never anticipated this with these giants they are good at everything not only having strongest body , more i saw them more i loved them i can bestow in one word that they are such irreplaceable human on the earth, thank you once again to yes theory team brought these wonderful human being on their channel.😍😍😍
You said you are dealing with chronic muscle pain? if so respond…
I loved this video so much! These brothers seem very humble and sweet.
So much Fun! I really enjoyed... You are all so wonderful people... You are loved!❤❣🔥😄
3:36 wait where have I seen him before
If anything I think having an Autistic brain would be a plus in this lifestyle - the ability to hyperfixate and thrive on consistency and routine are just some of the "superpowers" that makes him a real life hero. 💚🖤🔥
There laugh is freaking mental😂, I love it
3:23 good morning to you. 😊😊😊😊
The illustrations were some of the best I've ever seen in a YouTube video.... The artist truly delivered
That's a whole lot of Man Love
Man, the Stoltmans are amazing! :D
These two giants are perfect to become ur besfren
Lovely video 💜💜💜

I love them guys!
Wow, wow, wow.  What a video... i got goosbumps like every time this was a video that i need i go to the gym 2 times per week, and its refresing, and then to see this is so  motivating.  I realy appreciate, the video's it makes me smile everytime, and i love it.   Thnx you <3
I enjoyed the fun they had, even though I'm just watching...
These guys are so strong and yet so nice and friendly!
Hey, God loves you. You see, we are sinners in need of God’s grace, and we have broken God’s law, the Ten Commandments… But there is good news friend, God sent His Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross so we could be saved from hell and live in heaven with Him after our life here on earth is over! Jesus says in John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Jesus loves you so much that He was willing to give His life on the cross for you! God wants a relationship with you! So put your faith in Jesus Christ today, and you will  be saved, and you will go to heaven when you die! Repent of your sins, ask God for forgiveness, and may the Lord richly bless you! 2 Corinthians 6:2 “Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.”❤️😊
When the warrior king calls out his champion fighters to the front of the line, these 2 are the ones who walk out of the army at his back.
Verry cool video!
The part where the yes theory where gona bench press the strongman, reminded me of the time I did EHBO class and I needed to lift some one that weights around a 140k, tbh couldn't get him of the floor was funny as hell though
you guys should visit el salvador
14:15 the best part of this video💪💪💪🔥
Why does this look like  Forza 4
This video is pure testestrone
This is absolutely hands down one of the funnest videos I have ever watched.
9:12 such a genuine thank you! This sport is still seriously disrespected…
This is literally one of the best Yes Theory videos ive seen in a while. Looked so much fun!!! xx
These short 20 minutes has made my day a bit brighter and happier.  Thank You!

Girls with autism: making their entire personality about autism  Guys with autism: 15:12

Erich Tabach is on Yes Theory!
This is so wholesome, love this stuff
I. Would. Explode.  If i had to eat breakfast like that with these ...Gods
Dude sounds like he’s about to conquer a country
Can’t hear a word. The sound is real bad 🥵
5000th and first comment💪😂
hmm interesting position 19:07
I thought that they are already built different from the start. Seeing their old pic changes my mind. Now I believe in progress.
This was hilarious, and inspiring!
Bro They look like absolute gentle mountains. If Ive ever pissed them off even  a single finger for some reason, my soul would straight up voluntarily evict itself from my body. But damn spending a day with them looks fun asf.
These guys reminds me of my father. He is nowhere near as strong as these guys, but the vibes are the same :^D
OK Breakfast table is a riot! In tears.
My god🥺❤️ How you guys are coming up like these contents💯 I love you guys!
those two men are amazing. They seem as they most honest and funniest guys i have seen. Props to them.
17:32 got me laughing so hard
Can't believe that one guy was completing the strength tasks. What a baller. Must have felt so good.
I'd love to meet the stoltman brothers one day they seem so awesome 😎
imagine getting completely MOGGED by "the weakest guy you could find" lmaooooooooooo absolutely rekd! Also when the Worlds Strongest Man asks you "how are you so strong?!" that's one of the best compliments a human being could ever get holy moly
The absolute epitome of friendly giants.  Love their vibes
There voices were do deep, wonder how deep they could go!
Wow, what a BIG day! We're glad we can be a part of it.
I met these guys at strongman competition that I worked at as an EMT. Them and all the other competitors were so nice and courteous. I didn't really know much about the sport but after that event I have huge props to them and all they do. They seriously were so nice and such gentle giants.
And I thought strength came from muscle mass not fat
Y’all are so friendly I wish I could hang out for a day!!! Many blessings, watched the entire vid with a smile
just shows you don't need abs to be strong
This video put such a big smile on my face. Those guys look so nice! :)
5:50 lolllll
This is my second time watching this channel after watching you spending time with the Guru and I'm like, "why do I like this channel's videos so much?" lol. I'm finally subscribing

Kushi tattoo on chest  means happiness

Dude you comparing mythical giants to strong guys. I use to love watching but this is a little much

😁😁
Cant believe you guys were in Scotland and so close to me! Please come back so I can eventually meet you all!
wow this is the nicest and sweetest strongman ive ever seen
That laugh at 4:41 just warms my heart from the inside
DAMN! That felt good to watch <3
Incredible vid
LOL that sound effect 4:09
Do they join olympics too?
These guy's are eating like  goku from dragon ball 🤔 is that the secret to ultimate strength.
They should lose some weight
Crazy how so many guys are convinced being "manly" is being a macho d-bag when literally the strongest men in the world are chilled, nice dudes
God dammmn!! So good ❤️❤️
Eric has those russian genes.
When the zombie apocalypse arrives, I’m going to Scotland to recruit these two into my army 😂😂
he labels it as Glasgow but shows a picture of Oban lmaooo
That smile from 5:46 is kinda like what you see on cartoons BWAHAHAHA
you guys should come to australia becuase people over exagerate what it is like here
That 2 strong brothers are funny too 😆
This is such a cool video to watch
They seem so lovely, what an amazing team ! This video was beyond wholesome and fun :3
This is awesome haha  massive teddy bears that could eat those dudes

Never seen the sweetest siblings in my entire life other than this one.
Those guys are HUGGEEEEE!!!!!!
4:35 holy shit this dude needs to voice act thor on an animated movie or series
When the older brother is actually strong
i think they depicted the giants wrong in myths. i think gods were the ones who was looking for a fight >;C
Good vid
Ha! 7M people have just discovered hearing Luke speak will indeed increase your testosterone count.
This is video left me very bitter sweet. Sweet because you got to visit my country and got learn an aspect of culture. But bitter cause you were so closed to where I live and I never ran into you.
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Stoltman Brothers are genuinely two of the greatest people on the planet period .. they are amazing and my heroes ❤
Hey do you know when the Seeker hoodie will be back on the website? Those 2 colors on the website 😍
My brother in laws trainers name is Brian Carol he was the first to lift 1306 pounds visit him next?
If they were my friends i would ask them to throw me in the water   Instant catapult
Going to be so cool to see these humble giants up against Martins the equally humble giant. Boy is back in foooorm. An exciting time for Strongman. This new generation are fantastic athletes AND entertainers.
Travel to Kazakhstan, one of the most beautiful countries in the world and one of the least none about. Home of deep root culture and amazing people!!
the smiling giants
Omg this episode makes me want to go watch a bunch of strong man contests....these two guy's are absolutely amazing ,personable and absolutely handsome!!!   I love there personalities....thank you so much for sharing this video....next to will smith this is my most favorite video to date
Wanna come to Utah and go to all 5 national parks?  I live there and know a ton of hidden gems too
what a beautiful video man,
Feast in Asgard.
Gentle giants for the win!
Who wants to go university , reply if your from Gloucestershire or birmingham
Guys Eric is a Russian. Its Vot Ve do
Does any one know what the song is when they are introing Inverness
his probably out cheating with the boys  the bois :
This was so freakin awesome. I’m new to you guys but this was just a banger. Laughed out loud so many times.
new supporter from boundless jay
we have the same diet except i dont exercise
lol the small guy keeps up with them and they are like wtf how?>¿
I love how kind of quiet and humble these two big lads are despite being literally the strongest men on Earth. Not to be pure twee, but as a Scottish person myself it's something I really miss when I go abroad to countries like America or Australia where there's a lot more of a "loud and proud" culture. All the genuine best to these two absolute giants <3
Its sad living in sac seeing the competition being held here this year it got no pub i didnt even know about it being held hear
12:40 alot of those work outs up to this point are leg exercise more then upper body  that small guys calfs most be huge under those sweats
Eggzersize
pretty dodgy those smelling salts
Could u guys come to Paisley in Scotland and make a vid on it
Hernia surgrey sucks
2 girls 1 cup?  5 guys 1 breakfast.
Love the stoltmans!! 🌶🔥🌶🔥🌶🔥
Such awesomeness  and wholesome content to watch... guys. Love from india. Visit india and so we can film northeast india.
Big up Oban
Those who disliked this video i think are ZOMBIES...🥲🥲
5:52 you wanna hug him, 5:53 you wanna run away
I'd like to retire with an investment Worth at least $4MILLION and I'm ready to work towards this goal, I've come across investors making as much as $75,000 on a monthly basics and I'd like to know what step and guidelines I need to make better profit..
For some reason I kinda expected their voices to be higher pitched, but they actually matched their appearance perfectly 😆
Great video. You may have misnamed Oban for Glasgow though, in the beginning.
Day 22. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
BIG bois. Gotta love 'em. Such charismatic and really nice guys!!
Love their hardwork ❤️🙄🇮🇳
Thems some BIG BOYZ pappy!
So wholesome!
I wish I could someday enjoy my life like you.
This was awesome!
that was an awesome video,  laughed for a good portion of it :D .  Its awesome to see someone with what some call a "disability" competing at that level, he really is a super hero and an inspiration to so many.  both of them are
ive never met a Giant man before..i imagine i d ask a million questions..''do u play rugby''?
absolutely useless as Warriors tho
You could have travelled back in time, too since you went to Inverness🤷🏼‍♀️
They're each hot, too. I'd freakin' move to Scotland for the either brother.
YUSSS
Only Masculinity can bestow masculinity. This was a joy to behold.
This whole thing made me so happy.
That was an amazing video us usual  But you should meet KHAN BABA the Biggest Man on Earth 🌎
I think Tom beat autism. Like seriously I didn’t he had autism and I’ve been tuned into strongman
I don't know but this made me happy
I love it!! Thanks 4 sharing and those 2 giants are great lads 🙂
Where is ammar
That was fun. You guys are awesome!
Eric should do CrossFit or gain weight for strongman. He’s a natural!
This is just awesome
bro holy shit eric is strong as fuck for what his physique lol! im extremely impressed, these brothers are so kinda also
Cool
Great vid
the ecocide diet
They are so wholesome and Gentle Giants !
These guys are awesome!!👏👏😄
Plot twist: it isnt smelling salts, its cocaine
18:25 this cracking noise and the scream afterwards. are you okay buddy ?!
One of their thighs is like that blonde dudes torso lmao
This video was awesome guys. Well shown ! Cheers to the brothers on their success........y'all are big af hahahahahaha cheers lads !!!
I love how they are all big and burly but they have the sweetest smiles known to man
Brilliant content guys !!
5:56 is the funniest thing ever😂😂😂
much respect from someone with autism.
Thank you for making these great videos and spreading positivity every week!
Such genuinely nice giants 👏💙
inspiring story!!!! Hands down
Brilliant video
sigh...  _unzips_
Was absolutely hilarious
2 great guys !!!!!
I love the Scotsmen. Every time i see them they look like gentle giants roaming around the earth 😇😁🙏🙌
good vid
It's crazy how Giant's used to roam the world believe it or not.. They been created by Male Angels that came down on earth and found that the worldy Woman are beautiful and had sex with them which then they gave birth to these massive giant's
THANKYOU STOLTMAN BROTHERS & YES THEORY!
4:09 that right there was a violation
Loved these guys from the start!!
Nice job on the thumbnail standing 6 feet behind the brothers to make them look gigantic
Fitness industry: Cut out fats,sugars, carbs, pusbups, pullups, calf raises, bench press,etc(Jeff Cavilier fans understand) Absolutely nobody else.  Strongmen, I eat a shit ton of sweets to get the sugar going
I waited a few days to watch this...was so worth it, the videography, the story, the emotion, the humanity and the editing. Yes Theory never ceases to amaze and inspire
The fact they hug so much and are so nice and affectionate it’s pretty cool
Literally the friendly giants
Such an amazing, touching, and genuine episode. You guys have earned a loyal subscriber! 💪🏻😌👍🏻
Thomas: I’m 70kg Tom: that’s cute  😂😂😂 love this video!!
One chock is all it takes
This video is wholesome. I really loved it and I love these guys!
lots of injuries could happen in this gym. why is it so far from the city? hospitals should be close by to such gyms.
how are they so nice, this is so sick
Thank you very much. I enjoyed your vid.
omg these two strongest brothers are the best to be honest ,the way they are friendly humble  and welcoming. i really like them so much , wishing the best for  them in the future they deserve everything ❤️
Lol eric may be a softie but dude is super strong
Awesome and wholesome 💪👊
This is so wholesome. I love the dynamics between all of you ♥
I loved it.
Stolt = Pround in Swedish. Tom Stoltman = Tom Proudman
WTF, the nicest humans
im so excited for more uploads this november 🥰
9min 16s - that is how you deliver a compliment. Earnest and with eye contact.
Their voice alone generates pure raging testosterone
When Luke Stoltman retires, he should get a job recording audio-books and doing some voice acting. That smooth bass with the Scottish accent is a delight :-D
The hide-and-seek was hilarious :-D awesome video as always. Thanks :-)
Guys this was one of the best videos you've ever produced. Simply brilliant,these giant brothers of ours is such great gentlemen.loved it
They're reaction after smelling should be a meme 🤣
That is the deepest voice I've ever heard, unreal!
As a Scot, noticing the amount of mistakes Yes theory have made in this video, makes me wonder how many mistakes they’ve made in other videos. Have I just been accepting mistakes as fact when watching videos of the Middle East, the Caribbean etc etc.  For instance they show a video of Oban (a small town in the highlands) and say it is Glasgow (a city of 600k people)   It’s just a bit cringe how obvious it is
Am I the only one that noticed that those two men where in the same bed 😐
Amazing!!!!!
So the Commercial X32i is 3.999 dollar and discount we get from your link is 75 dollar? That means that the discount is less than 2%...
i loved this video!
I feel bad for that tiny car 😭
These 2 giants is have a pure heart and hospitable to them
I bet these two dudes can wreck a toilet big time in the morning 🚽💨💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
That laugh after saying "my thumbs are bigger than your's" 😂
This is so much fun
wow such genuine loving brothers ...
They could win both strongest and nicest men in the world.
Eggsercise
It was amazing video...loved it
Hide and seek 😂😂
stoltman  brothers: big macho tough guys  also stoltman brothers: jumps in bed to wake yes theory up
By far my fav video yet
i have to be honest i forgot about this channel but i am glad i found good content again
Bless you guys, showmanship, Scottish camaraderie, and a surprise achiever
Gentle giants indeed.Gonna sub to these guys.
This was amazing to watch.
Swim in the Croatian U boat tunnels from WW2. It would be EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Enjoyed watching that and the positive energy. Thanks 🍻
You guys should go to the ghost town if cerro gordo, there's a dude who bought his own ghost town and is currently living there, restoring old buildings and exploring hundreds of year old mines
Fn love the guy doin it
Why are these guys so fat?  Wouldn't they even be stronger if they wouldn't have to carry less of their own weight?
Really a good video from yes theory after a long time, Great work guys. Much love to u all😍
This was awesome !!!
Love this channel! :)
Ask a stranger to go skydiving from Mt everest. #yestheory
great video
So often that buff guys look down on scrawny people, but these brothers were legit awesome the whole f*cking time!!
Briiliant, they look like great people
lmao imagine if they had daughters
Eric is going to go back home and start pumping iron now 😆 watch this space 💪👊
This is probably one of the coolest videos ai have ever seen in my life.
Enjoyed so much watching this. 😂❤️🇵🇭 More power to you guys!
This episode was fantastic, the Stoltmans are awesome
Scotland what a beautiful country
I'm just a new born baby in strength compared  to them😅
What make them STRONGEST is love they both brothers have for each other.
Eggzersizing
Can’t stop smiling
Thi collab was awesome, great idea
Amazing what focus and drive can do.
Giant hide and seek bit was halarious! I laughed so hard at him hiding up the lamp shade! Like literally laughed out loud😂
What an amazing people... They are so much different from other strongmen! They are just so humble, down to earth, and loving people, I wish I had such friends... Good luck to you guys.
At certain points, this looked like a really elaborate adult video
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Tom with the lamp on his head just priceless. That looked so absurd. Video shows autism can be just a condition if it's handled superior with love.

gachiBASS
I like this original Scottish dialect of Luke. In which town in Scotland they live?
Nephilim giants are real and have known to exist more than a thousand years ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Fp2fVz6VA
I hope this sport blows up huge and these gentle giants finally get some much deserved recognition.
Who ever dislikes this video have no humanity
Every Hulk has Bruce banner story...
My goodness they are so cute hahahahaha. Of course I would be really intimidated but I would also love to have friends like them! They seem like such lovely souls!  Edit: Im crying because the lumberjack shirt Luke had in this video is sold out and I fell in love with that fucking shirt! Those are my favorite type of shirts and they are so goddamn rare to find and expensive in my country, and that one looked so fucking awesome! (*cries into a half eaten cookie*)
That was amazing, what down to earth and welcoming brothers. In a world where athletes, performers and stars seldom have the time for anyone except themselves these guys are as kind and inviting as if you knew them for years..
Awesome guys, I've seen othethings with these giants. Best thing for kids with a disorder. Only to have a big, errrrrrrg giant. Brother line that
Big tommys got the gyno happenin
This is the best thing that I watched today :)
These two guys seem so genuine
I envy you guys 🤩
also insane how they got the 'weakest' guy to come along, only to find out he's the strongest of the three haha.
Also, the question that remains in my head: How hard can you guys punch and kick? lol don't go breaking planets
man...i genuinely enjoyed this. Super Inspiring, especially the autism part. Because I'm diabetic and i definitely need to hit the gym often. Now, to get a gym membership lol
The weakest guy, yet the strongest guy!! Awesome!!!
Excellent
Just guys being dudes
absolute UNITS
I'm not crying, you're crying.
That was simply entertaining and great fun to watch.  I'm sure even more to make.  😀
giant softies, which is awesome. lol
So I stop watching yous for a while and yous come to my home town wtf
They are so humble and encouraging, I love it!
U should go country of Phillipine
Awesome video!
4:42 Stoic the Vast
They look like two different species.
Theirs alott of strong people in this world 🌎
Very nice video, thank you YES THEORY for this wonderful video. More power to you Channel. Love here from Philippines!
Absolutely epic! Loved it, beginning to re-think my physical disabilities and 'push the envelope' a bit. A great vid and two genuine decent guys. From afar, my heart and my hand. Pax vobis.
this...was the SWEETEST vid awww! my heart!!  Loving the brotherhood that came out of this experience <3
This was great!
made a vid abt strongman and doesnt mention the goat brian shaw bruh
NordicTrack!
I wonder their women look like.
This video is full of bromence and bicuriosity , and I'm down with that
You guys are the best
Dear God, keep the V away from them! So many athletes dying. This was so sweet really, a very hilarious bromance... love you guys <3
There is no other strength that is stronger than the power of the HOLY SPIRIT. The LORD who is GOD can give you the true strength and confidence you truly desire. Give your life to the FATHER who is GOD and HE will give you all you truly desire. HE loves you and is waiting for you. I bless you in the name of JESUS. I cast out all your demons in the name of JESUS
dude speaks like darth vader
Tq
Pfff Pudzianowski is the stringer man in da world
We need a whole album of them just talking like they do at 14:06 it’d be so mad for the gym
Editing team has been top notch lately
Tom is an inspiration and he has an awesome brother
That man’s voice is a literal 808🤣 incredible video🤎
I think the best thing about the NordicTrack is that they finally give you leaderboards to compete with other people.
Gawd, I would let them dominate me- I mean… okay. Come on. BEARS! They are too damn hot 🥵
Where the heck do I get that seek discomfort shirt?? I love it
havent laughed so much from a yes theory video before! thank youuuuu, love you Strong Men
I cannot put into words how happy this made me! Thank you Yes Theory!
They probably care a refrigerator like a laptop
Neither of those guys are the worlds strongest man
That dude looks like a beefed up Tom hardy 😳
They literally grab a rock and turn it into water
These dudes are beast💪💪
yung mga kargador samen kaya yan hahahaha
Its not just the hard work ethic and the calories, its also the PEDs they inject. Strongmen/PL use a shit ton of drugs...
this was a great video and shows off some history about scotland and the highland roots and hopefully shows everyone in scotland doesn’t speak in a glaswegian accent
I just took off my shirt.
Is that a young jake paul?
Its crazy how they look way less strong than like body builders... but they are much stronger
One of the very best posts I have EVER seen.  Thank you for taking us along with you!
Really awesomely beautiful video!! Loved the vibes and loved everyone’s energy. Soooo wholesome ❤️❤️
This video made me so happy ☺️ I was smiling the whole time!!!
poor knees
Kushi the tatoo the guy has means happy in hindi
This video made me smile the whole time 💖💖💖💖
Lol looks like you guys had a blast with a couple of friendly giants!
The Stoltman Bros are INCREDIBLE!! Looks like so much fun hanging out with them!
What a great video 🙏💪🏽
17:11 - That was really endearing, you have no idea. Interestingly, I am trying to lose weight, but seeing that you can have a gut as well as strength, I’m left a lot better. Also being on the spectrum seeing others who are autistic was nice.
I love this. Great video guys!! Theres so much brotherhood in this episode!!! too bad those stoltman checkered shirts are sold out :/
If no one mentioned that Tom had autism, I wouldn’t have ever guessed it.
wowwwww how amazing!!!! loved it❤️❤️❤️❤️
I woulda trash-talked TF outta those guys... like when I would be the third arm in the arm wrestle -match, *"NOWW* _you fucked up!_ *Now you have fucked up!* _You have fucked up now!"_  I'm sure they'd still have beat us... ("strongest men *in the WORLDD??"* ) — but the trash-talk woulda been entertaining for your viewers... — YOU SHOULD HIRE ME OM, THOMAS!  I could be a *HUGEEE* benefit 2 u...
I know who I want on my squid game team
these guys are rad
Imagine if their car broke they don't need tow to bring it to the car shop. 🤯
I really admire the older brother for looking out that much.
HAHAHAHA 😂😍
When my friends and I travelled to Scotland and visited Loch Ness we saw these guys up in those highlands! We were too afraid to say hi! :P
These guys can literally lift me with one hand like wtf
Both a them support rangers aswell so even better 🇬🇧
Never enjoyed watching 5 shirtless men hug each other this much before
Such a great VideooooO.🦍😍
So proud of my fellow Scots! I can honestly say I would never have the push to do what the Stoltman Brothers have done. 🤘🤘
Beautiful story, i kinda relate w Tom cuz i also used to be that tall twig kid with autism now i still am but atleast less of a twig :)
Glasgow Scotland and shows a picture of Oban 😂😂
Theres only one God and hes name is Jesus Christ, the lord of all and everything that are around us!!!
Proper humble guys 💪💪💪
thank you for making my day guys! i needed this
Pure joy and kindness!
this is one of my new favourite yes theory videos <3
"Im 70 kilos"  ....... "thats cute innit" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why have you all tried to try those heavy weight things? You know this might had very sad end... please, never don't try it if you don't have any special trainings or skills for those things...
I garente that water sucked at first an u wanted 2 get out. Then u got used to it. An when u got out u was the most awake an refreshed.
this is so awesome
Day 21. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
"I'm 70 kilos" 👁👄👁 "That's cute, isnt it?" 😂😂😂
I have been following strong man ever since I seen it on tv late at night as a kid.  These two brothers have always been one of my favs and always did really well in every comp. But I didn't know he had autism....and that makes me respect him even more!  Not only does he have to be physically strong, but also has to b over come his social anxiety to compete.
6:00 Looks like the Last Supper painting  But it’s really the first of many suppers
This man has the batman's voice
Definitely not the world’s most cut men
Stolt-Man in Norwegian means "proud man" and these men are something to be proud of! Tom in many ways is iconic!
This is one of the coolest and most wholesome videos I've seen.
This was so wholesome
just tried to subscribe again for the hundreth time
Really enjoyed this one! The bros seems like great people🤗🤗
I´m so happy that this channel exists
Can’t believe you were only a train journey away from me 😫
Eric is my HERO
they are so lovely and friendly, omg hahaha
before you get a nordic track better go out..
I’m Scottish and I’m so proud of my landscape
Sweet humble giants...love it
The giant hide and seek! hahaha.
Dudeee! Hands down The best video everrr! Enjoyed it! Loved it. Keep them coming! Yes to Life! Cheers 🍻
Both of these guys are so inspirational to me Especially Tom, I have a disability myself so to see him channel that S***T is amazing with all due respect ✊🏾 😢🙏🏾 ❤️
Their voices are so deep and guttural. Wow. Amazing.
The stoltmens are such great guys totally deserved everything they have and more ❤️👍
The water drop sound when Eric plopped in the water 😂😂😂🤣🤣😂
You cant ever judge a book by its cover those guys are just nice. What a great video.
I had the biggest grin on my face throughout the whole video. Thank you guys so much! They don't just lift weights, they lift spirits!
Who said they are the strongest
These guys out here living my dreams. What a cool way to spend a day.
HOLY shttttt.. how is Eric so strong!!!!!!?!?!   and omg.. the  Stoltman brothers are super chill and nice friendly giants!!!!
You guys live close to another World’s Strongest Man, Martins Licis! You should go work out at his Wreck It gym for like a month or two, then go back to visit Tom and Luke (take Martins w you)!
I was just thinking how homoerotic this is, and then you brought out the Twister.
Smiled for the entirety of this video
A class act the two brotheres.
Come on lads, let’s get the boys’ channel up to 200K subs. They truly deserve it!
This is my new favourite video on YouTube
Amazing story 🙏
This is the difference with  Scandinavian Steongmens / Body builder and the other strongmens in the rest of the world (India, US,UK, Aussie, Sri Lanka, France, Russia, Mexican, Congolese, Senegalese, Vietnamese….)…the Scandinavians are calm, all natural, also uses whey, créatine, but as a complementary source, real good food and know their shit, they are calm, they can keep they are  cool, educated, joyful…while the rest of the world and specially the country I just quote  would knock your teeth out for the shittiest of reasons or can’t keep their shit together cause of the steroids!!
They are very strong
Why is it that the toughest looking guy is always the sweetest of all??🥺❤
When they lifted the light stone that was epic!! 🤣😂🤣😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Woah they are the nicest ever
Seeing Eric not give up was actually kind of inspirational. I was so happy for him when he got the stone.
Cool brothers so funny, awesome💪😎
The brothers are so supportive, nice and sweet !! Lovely giants 😊
These brothers are so cool😍😍😂
Why are the world’s strongest men always white? I thought black people were the ones who are athletic and intimidating 😂
Some very cool people
2.12 That is Oban, not Glasgow
I loved this so much, the goofball part like hide and seek was great comedy.
Love the Stoltman Bros, Legends of the game, but more importantly really nice guys that are an inspiration to the world
These are the most cutest giants 🌸❤️ i have seen...really want to meet them. ...please come to india ❤️🙏🏻
inspiring story
These giants are the sweetest guys I have seen
Two of my fav strongman
They're awesome!
Are they gonna show us their cycle of PEDs?
The shot where it says Glasgow that’s actually Oban
This is the most wholesome thing I have seen in a while. I absolutely love this
I'm a new subscriber because of the stoltman brothers. I'll check the rest of your work.  Keep it up!
Spicy
Strongman basics; 50% training. 30% FOOOOD 20% Recovery and MAYBE push in 10% sleep.   Yes I know thats 110% and thats strongman.
1:09 Basque!!, probably from Spain. Look for Iñaki Perunena, a spanish national hero
These two Guys are the embodiment of inspiration
@yestheory Here is a challange. All of you run in a official marathon without no training. Everyone but the winner with best time has to do something discomfort. Love you guys!
They're kinda slow
This is so wholesome
Hmmm.  I don't think most people realize how much strength you need to do this stuff.  I would have bet a million bucks any of yes theory could not put the stones up on the podium.  Especially the first time ever doing it.ive never seen that happen.  This kid needs to start training.  It takes immense strength, coordination, balance, endurance.  I have still not been able to lift a stone and set it.  That's crazy.
This is turbo wholesome.
This video was a really fun for watch. This guys are amazing
Fucking awesome
i mean i'm only 154lbs and 6', and i eat roughly 5-6k calories a day... Apparently those are rookie numbers lol, better add another 4k calories i guess.
Wow!  I had no idea Tom was autistic.  I've always been big fans of both brothers,  but this made me even an even bigger fan.
God, I miss Scotland! Thanks for this video, it was amazing! :D
You should chech out the Stone forest in Madagascar. Keep up the awesome videos!
cool
This is wholesome as hell. Makes me want to find a place that has stones.
I love how personalble sweet and genuine the Stoltman brothers are! I enjoyed every second of this video! Im a Stoltman fan for life now!
Thanos
this was gosh darn amazing to watch lets go hahaha
ScottISH Highlands
"Wait you have the record (286 kilos) for hold? "Yea so I can lift it over this." "I'm 70 kilos." *"That's cute."* 😁😂
I’m so happy you guys got to experience my country and hope you guys come back soon 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Alba Gu Brath, mon eh Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
EXELENTE
This is one of my favorite videos you all have done. So good and wholesome. <3
Such awesome and down to earth guys
So wholesome.
THIS WAS SO WHOLESOME I LOVE IT
We need this in the states
The best content, on the Internet!
The brothers are the true definition of GIGA CHAD
2:11 that's not Glasgow, it's Oban...
I want to spend time with them too 🤤
The bass in my headphones are not good enough to hear the giants speak...
Raging would have loved to have meet you guys! Keep up the great work! From Edinburgh!x
18:26 That cracking sound from Thomas elbow. Rip..
strong Eric
Bully! You fellas did a fantastic job with this video!
even their voices are mad deep hhhh
Paul brothers after retirement from boxing
They're massive in size, stupidly strong, voices deep enough to make your balls tremble. Yet still soft and touchy/cudly with friends and just friendly lads overall. True rolemodels...
Tom is adorable 🥰
Tom is super quiet and reserved for being the strongest man in the world. Very humble
Have been following these boyeees for 2 years now. Such hard working men.  Inspirational and uplifting! Gentle Giants with a good attitude.
I've never watched Yes Theory before but I loved every second of that! Instant Sub!
Omg. These guys are adorable
Damn! I’m having a hard time believing how much fun this was to watch, absolutely incredible. Thank you!
Probably eat their duck and pancakes from marks and spencers
Such a good video!
2:13 Is Oban NOT Glasgow FFS!
Yes theory I challenge you to do marines or fbi training for 48 hours
This is such a feel good video 👏🏻.
The skinny guy outlifting the other two is a perfect example of good form. Those lifts he was doing he was just gripping the weight then using his legs to bring it off the ground rather than trying to pull them off the ground with his upper body.
Look at him in the middle of those two giants. He looks so vulnerable. 😆
Look at him in the middle. He looks so vulnerable.
Glad you enjoyed Scotland 😁
Was there schmaltz? Yes. Did you look like a bunch of hobbits capering with ents? Yes. Did I enjoy this video? Yes. You got me in the feels!
Scotland.. The Land of Warriors.  The rumors that spread before the war. "He is seven feet tall! Kills men by the hundreds. HE will consume the English with fireballs from his eyes, and bolts of lightning from his arse". Even that absolutely not the truth for his physique but still they was right about his heart. - William Wallace -
The King of masks!!!!!!

This was such a fun and cute video!! Absolutely loved every bit of it :-)
The dumbbell was bigger than me them😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was very emotional for me.
Hey, so I know this is off topic but I'm sure you've probably heard of the initiative taken by Mr beast and mark Roberr and many many other creators across this platform to remove plastic waste from oceans and rivers and I was hoping that perhaps reaching out to you, my favorite channel on here to help with the initiative to remove the waste. Hope you see this and I hope you can maybe get this community to band together to help with the clean up effort so that we may have waste free oceans, rivers, and beaches.  Thank you.
This is so pure and uplifting, thank you!
Stolt man in norwegian means proud man
Where do you get your music from
14:31 eric was like.. CARRY MEEEE hahahaha
30% BF and still visible abs. These guys are freaks of nature
This is now my favourite video of all time. ❤️
Nahhhh they did him dirty 4:10
aha this was great, very uplifting to watch
Thank you yes theory. I am from the highlands and have not been home since 2018. The accents, the humour, the views, it was all on point. You’ve made my day. ‘Mon the highlanders!!!!
Come to Pakistan
Man those were some whom u can all brother from another mother ... stoltmann brothers .... love u all ... once they r bak home , i couldnt stop smiling seeing them.. thank you ...
I'm sure there are comments advising already, but the picture you have at 2:12 is not Glasgow, but Oban a small coastal town which is 97 miles north of Glasgow
Cutest brothers ever,that grin when he says his weight is 185 kgs
This was a lot more wholesome than I expected 😂
Haha the ending when you guys played games had me cracking up! Loved it xD
14:11 best moment, lads could lift much heavier than that but was happy for him
This is actually a very funny video!
The power of Scotland the stolman brothers ☮💯👊👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤🤍💙💪
Nice content 👍😊

💪💪💪
Most Humble humans on earth ❤....litreally loved the entire video good vibes all around
your content is lit! those are very nice giants.
I enjoyed this...
Loved this video man, I died laughing during giant hide and seek lol I'd say come spend some time with maui from Moana but thats all I got lol Aloha from Hawaii. Love your video, what you stand for and the love you all have for every thinghope to meet 1 day 🤙🏽🤙🏽
plot twist: it's the origins of one punch man :also before he went bald lol
Luke, to me, seems like what I'd picture as a Scottish Laird... 😃
What an inspiration!
Best watch on YouTube in a long time!  thank you for sharing 😃👍🏻
Superb video guys! How about a Seek Discomfort with a long distance runner? Or how about a full blown Seek Discomfort - Sports Special series! 😀
look at thanos man...
The plop at 4:09 🤣🤣🤣🤣
If you're around the Stoltman's, and don't laugh, or see their heart. You're dead I think. Both are such kind Giants. Tom was so funny in this.
Love these 2 guys!
Hey guys, I am currently the weakest man in Europe, and two time weakest man in the world. Come and hang out with me. We can spend the day not lifting things up.
This is amazing
I love these guys !! Such Great Giants 🦶🏽
17:30 - They look like kids with their dad who comes home once a month.
😃 I really enjoy this video.... 🇬🇭🇬🇭
Such nice guys! I would love to meet them. Such an inspiration.
One of the best yes theory videos❤
Friendly giants ☺️
So I know this is really out there but you have to get out there comfort zone and the worst that could happen is nothing. I had emailed and sent a message before to yes theory about this idea. Ever since I saw your guys  videos of you guys skydiving I've had this urge just to go. Originally it was supposed to be something I did with my ex but she broke up with me just before my birthday and we never went. Ever since that happened I wanted nothing more but to go even if it was by myself on my birthday. I tried and tried but they kept getting canceled or postponed and I really just want to be able to do something adventurous. Ever since my ex broke my heart I've been on a mission to experience life like never before and yes theory has inspired me it's really get out of my comfort zone and do things I might never have been able to.  Like I said I don't know if this will ever reach you guys but at least I could do is try right.
Holly shit I got 5 months of videos to catch up on😂
You guys are the best I've watched you both sence the start of your channel. One day I too would love to have a chance to be one of the strongest men in the world once I get my life figured out. Best of luck from Ohio.
Come here to the philippines will tour you around boracay and my province Aklan😊
Am gone to meet these guys- ah not now
That's cute innit?
Loved seeing a different side of the brothers great episode boys 👍😀👏
This was one of your best videos!! Love this
I loved watching this video🤍
This maybe bias because I'm a fan of the Stoltman Brothers, but this was the best episode ever!
The Stoltman Brothers are just the sweetest giants ever! I just want to hug them both 🤩🤩🤩
Brooo I wish I had the genetics to be that huge
My mom just got a new Ford f something 4x4 and it’s really big but I we put our new truck next to one of the ego ants they will make it look normal
Eric....PROUD OF YA!
Come to India for A big fat Indian Wedding 😍😍!!!
This is so wholesome....wow
Its12:14 at night and hype he picked up the ball
If anyone was wondering how much it would cost to have your very own “Nordictrack X32i”, you can have one for the low low price of $3999. Nice.
One of them weighs 400lbs 🤯
no back problems ?
❤️❤️👍👍
Damn bro this video made me miss the bros
4:27 that’s kind of gay 🤨
I knew you guys for your toughness, you hang out with Wim Hof and now with the strongest men, but their is someone I want you to hang out and how I wish your answer is YES! That someone is David Goggins.
Real life giants
such as thor and eddie hall WHAT ABOUT MY BIG BOI BRAIN SHAW
yo those voices are so deep wth LMAO
This video was so much fun!  I laughed a lot throughout the video.
This is the most wholesome video ever <3
hilarious !
The brothers are so nice :)
THOR!
🤣👍
i dare you all to get The Rock to workout with them
Anyone who is a master at their craft immediately earns my respect.  The amount of dedication these guys and all strong men put into what they do is nothing short of outstanding. Also, it's just cool to see dudes who can crush your head like a grape be the nicest guys ever.
i loved this video it made me laugh so much and i really wanna get into working out but im not confident enough im also 14 so im not sure.
These guys would make a fat chick look normal in bed.
Those men are giant, compressed bundles of testosterone.
this was a very wholesome video i feel like you guys made there day
Awesome video 👏🏼
This is awesome ❤️
When I first heard them I thought darth Vader had entered the room
Everyone was shirtless for the vast majority of the video 😂😂
Some of the deepest voices I’ve ever heard
I love Luke and Tom man, they're just the most wholesome people you could meet
I loved everything about this <3
i was literally on amazon looking for a treadmill when I got the noticed this video on my 2nd screen
LOVED THIS SOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH.
?: We have Hulk!  Thomas: We have Stoltman Bros
These guys seem awesome!
This was such a cool video!! Had me smiling from ear to ear the entire time. I loved seeing just a glimpse into these guys lives. Awesome story. Thanks for sharing!!
i dont believe it Thomas is a black belt whats weirder is he never mentioned it not once, even when Matt bragged how he's so fit and an iron man
Voice so deep it sounds like you put a filter on it. A lot of strength.
i love how Thomas is so used to cold water challenge that he just stands casually in the water lol
The Stoltman Brothers: big, bough giants literally 4x my weight Me: omg they’re so cuuuute 🥺😭
That hide and seek portion had me dead, super wholesome stuff
5:54 what a wonderful sight
Seriously, so wholesome. I just subbed because of this video
The fact you's came to Scotland, and not just to scotland but yous came to my hometown and i had no chance to meet you all just actually rips a hole in my heart :(
Beautiful! Happy tears throughout (ok, sometimes just straight laughing at you boys) - but being of Scottish heritage, I loved it even more. You know men are truly badass when they wear skirts (kilts) and can kick ass! Excited for your new vids too!!! Thank you for this! Big love
You can just tell that the Stoltman brothers are just proper fucking lads ♥
These guys are so down to earth and they are truly inspiring! Amazing video as always.
Makes me proud to be scottish got so much respect for the stoltman brothers ❤ Bless up
I'm 167CM 60KG. They can use me as dumbbell.
That's impressive but I wonder how flexible they are. Also, it's kind of funny to see them sit on furniture, they truly are giants. Gentle giants :)
Please try to visit here in the Philippines and do the challenge living on the streets with no money.
The Stoltman Brothers are sooo chill and hype asf, these are the guys you need as your gym buddy’s
Such a positive video.
This was so wholesome to watch, they are the definition of friendly giants. For some reason I was not expecting for them to have such great and charming personalities.
NO WAY YOU GUYS WERE HERE AND I DIDNT EVEN KNOW :(
That one guy's voice sounds like he's under water hahaha how cool
A genuinely good video
Thomas is so beautiful!  🥰🥰🥰
Tom used to have abs LOL
18:58 lol
Jesus man, ubisoft should of used them for their assassin's creed valhalla game!
I don't see Brian Shaw anywhere?
Two strongest men in the world? Eddie Hall vs. Hafþór Björnsson sure do look different from what I recall :P
When they started *speaking* …
Why do the guys sound like they in slow motion
Oh fuck off. I wanted to see the tug of war.
It says THE two strongest men in the earth. I think the second place title belongs to Brian shaw this year
I lmao you guys next 2 them 😂😂😂
I loved their accents
I'm not crying, you're crying.
Seeing 3 tree twigs sitting next to 2 tree trunks while eating looked funny
ahahahahahahaahahahah
Those wonderful men are straight from lord of the rings and hobbit!
Definitely gentle giants
Their shits are massive. Lord help us...
When you see strongman in a video, you know that the wholesome levels will hit all time high levels.
nice to see a vid, where I ive. Trust me we arent all this big :)
It feels natural to see the highlanders sit without a shirt but the midgets😉😅😅, not so much
Biggest man hug ive seen 😅😅
I bet u let them hit
that's what I sad WEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
14:25 that second lift was so clean
His voice is deeper than Thanos
these dudes are cool i wish i could hang with them
You should visit any of the Antarctic research stations
These guys also have dislodged bullets stuck in their sphincter muscles. That's why they wear skirts.
Tom has the same chest as a gorilla .. proper machine 💪
Why do you guys always have your shirts off?
awh man this was the most uplifting and wholesome video ive watched in a while. real superheroes!
tell me why this made me cry
just WOW!!
They sounds like giants too
Hes russian what do you think
I love these brothers, so genuine and wholesome. Great video
I loved this.
Tom is a behemoth of a man
Pierdu pierdu kurwa, jak dla was to są siłacze to wy chyba pudziana nie widzieliście. On by zabił ich kurwa jednym spojrzeniem, po tych frajerach została by plama krwi na podłodze.
Obesity doesn't = gigantism
awesome video!
They are both some big strong hansom men I'm half Scottish half welsh I knew straight away as soon I seen the kilts
Calling the Scotland Britain is sad man
So wholesome, I luv it
You guys picked the right strongman to visit. These guys are absolute gems. Really good souls and strong mfers
why are they fat
Great video guys 🤙🏼
imagine a robber break into this home and what they find out are just two giants
By far my favorite story/video . You brought to light the gentle giant's heart and soul and their love, support and brotherhood. They seem like amazing people and I am happy that people had a chance to get to know them as person's not only strong man. I wish the boy's all the best in life ❤ and thanks for a great video.
the stoltmans are the beeeeest 🤣
What's the song at 3:07? :)
2/2 videos of yours I've watched were amazing. First the one with Wim Hoff and then this one.
STRONGMAN WITH THE BEST VIBES HANDSDOWN<3
Such a beautiful story of success achieved by hard honest steady work. And it was very funny to watch.
Such a great video!
"Stoltman" means "Proud man" in Swedish... cool
My favorite part was how Thomas said eggercise after eating eggs.  I know it’s his accent but it was amazing.
amazing
looved this episode 😹♥️✨…   soo much fun.. and Great  guys ☺️☺️!!
take some methandienone on top of some decent genetics and there you have giants.Of course hit the gym and eat like an animal.
This was awesome. Really enjoyed watching this.
2:11 Thats Oban in Argyll, not Glasgow 😂
That was amazing God bless them
Oh noes he said Thor and Eddy in the same sentence!
Massive stoltman fans, our own Scottish strongmen. So incredibly proud of them both. A credit to Scotland. Loved the vlog too ❤
Eric is my favorite of the group he brings his A game no matter what. so glad he is on the YTSD team
best video youve made in my opinion :) brilliant job
5 shirtless men (2 huge giants) play children’s games in the middle of the night
This was so inspiring and wholesome!
is it just me or is the quality of sound in this video insane
Stoltman is such a fitting name as it means proud man in Swedish (might mean the same thing in other languages)
2:10 that's not Glasgow, that's Oban lol
Day 20. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
absolutely loved watching this, great video !
these guys has such deep voices it sounds like the inhaled sulfur hexafluoride
Loved this one
strongest yet the nicest
Good video and lovely energy all around.
If these guys inhaled helium, they would speak with normal man's voice.
Had the worst week going but this unbelievable colab has really put a smile on my face god bless! ❤️
Fucking nicest people ever!!!!!!!!!
You can tell you guys had a great time with them!
This is such an inspiring, wholesome video! As always a great video with great depth, humor and storytelling. Thank you for doing what you do 💚
MEN!!!!!!
They seem like super sweet fun guys. So manly in those kilts and Scottish accent! Scottish landscape is gorgeous! Love it!
i don't know whether its gonna work but it will be pretty cool to ask a owner of a private plane to let you fly with him/her
Amazinggly wholesome! Loved it!
I need a giant 😍💕
Being a proud Southerner from Louisiana I must say there is something about Iverness I find incredible. I know I have British ancestry but I need to do more digging as I feel a real connection to Scotland. Such beauty and history! And the Stoltman brothers are excellent ambassadors! Great vid guys! Cheers P[><]F
These strongman would crush sidemen on their 10.000cal challenge
What a blast, pure awesomeness!
They have such a DEEP voice 🔥
Loved that❤👍
This is brilliant.  Big fan of the stoltman brothers . What's theve achieved is incredible 👊
I have a challenge Go to România in Constanța is more good but if u want a bad one go to jupiter
OHH THATS A FAMILY I DONT WANNA MESS WITH
Did you spoil the result of The World's Strongest Man in the intro? I probably shouldn't have watched this.
🐐🐐
This is awsome
5:47 He looked at him like he was a tasty hamburger xD
this is what true working class scots are like.. salt of the earth and would give their last.. still a smile no matter
Imagine what it would be like if Olympians all lived together in the off season.... Rather than competing against each other we took a leaf out of these guys books and train together.
how are they both voiced by the same demon?
I had no idea the worlds strongest and Europe's strongest men come from Scotland! I miss the highland games!
well done yes theory .. get scotland back on the map
i love a firm sausage between my buns
These dudes are soy boys
Smiles all around! I love it.
What a beautiful video!
Why are these guys so W I D E?
They look like the brothers from god or war.
cant stop laughing :D
Awsome video. Laughing so much watching this. I follow luke and Tom. Will now follow you guys. We'll done.
I didn't know you guys came to scotland 😢 Im devastated i didn't meet you's! 💔 Brilliant video!! 👌❤️
They even sound like giants when they speak.
Come to kashmir the world's most militarised zone and yes the most beautiful as well
damn this made me emotional towards the end, cuz i can relate.
Only mention Thor and Eddie? How about 4th times winner Brian Shaw?
the hide and seek killed me haah
This video really motivate me to do a dirty bulk and lift like it's last day 👍
:(
Random channel I've never heard about is hanging out with my favourite strongmen. Sounds very much worth watching. Also, Luke's voice is so deep he talks in Richter scale.
I love the cute little "you like mushrooms?" At breakfast lmao
5:41
3 mins in, had to like the video already.
They are like bears in human form. Wow
The Stoltman Brothers are probably the sweetest brothers out there. They're funny and kind, they seem like nice people to be friends with. I loved their story and how they became who they are today. I never expected Tom to be autistic but it's so good to see how far he has come and how inspiring he must be to other autistic people, especially children. What a wholesome video! I hope to see them on the channel very soon.
Where men really are men
How cool was that! I've followed these guys on IG and they are amazing and fascinating. The Stotlmans are in my home state as we speak in Austin.  Spreading their own special brand of positivity.
Such a heartwarming video ! These giants with giant hearts made my day !
as cliche as this line may sound, it will always be true. "Never judge a book by its cover" 👏👏
Funny part 5:52😄💪
oh my gosh the Stoltman brothers are so cool! I was very sad I could not make it to the last competition in Sacramento CA. Congrats Tom!!!
we brought the weakest man we could think on this...  whose laughing now, weaklings... 🤣😂
Yooooo Lil D
Lol
So fucking wholesome!
this men maybe the strongest but they are the sweetest! i love how genuine and pure they are.
Bro he is like 4 of me...
Save kerala mullaperiyar dam🙏
Hi guys ! but what are you doing, I am waiting for you at my place !
It's cool to see men fully immerse themselves into what you might consider typical "manly shit" and not be toxic about it.
damn, had a great laugh!
5:52 :D
This is such an epic channel
Inspirational...
i dare you guys to make eric stay a little bit longer with them , let see how much they will transformation eric body , wich is eric already had the strange as we can see , i know you guys see this🔥
Always wanted to see what a normal human will perform 👍👍👍in those weight
For Luke to ask you how the hell you are so strong is quite the compliment
To get the sugars going 🤣
MATT IS BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
I really enjoy this video. This is so inspiring. Thank you for sharing this to us.
so heart warming, the family of planet earth is proud of you guys!
#TeamSeas
4:26 the definition of hanging out with the boys
*DUNNMAGLASS!!*
Coolest sponsor. I want one. Great video guys.
As if the whole video wasn't already 10/10, you reveal the Autism diamond! I am the mother of a son with Autism. This will bring him so much joy!!! Thank you!!!
Eric is stronger than I thought
#TeamSeas yall got get on that movement
times will change. so much of a big strong body image is ego. it's likely as we enhance our perception we will focus on longevity and sustainability. The effort and over consumption to be big wont last long and is virtually pointless. i've been 120kgs of muscle and now at 85kgs i feel healthier, mobile,  nimble and far less wear on my joins and body.

The one guy look like Jake Paul
he doesnt even seem like he has autism, i had no clue and its amazing to see the way he had over come it
Great video
Can’t believe you were in Scotland!!!! Hope you enjoyed being there ✨

Anything with the Stoltmans in it gets a massive thumbs up from me!
3:27 what a disgusting thing 2 men In the bed. Hell is happy
It's Fantastic❤
Imagine an army of these men charging at you with axes and ready to rage your village
Pls that sound edit at 4:11when he dived in the water and it was just a little plop 😭🤣🤣
The vibes in this video are amazing 🤩 I also literally laughed out loud throughout this entire video 😂
Just got a massive TRT-like testosterone boost just from watching this/
This is the most pure and beautiful friendship to see develope ❤️
Why does it sound like he's saying "eggcersice" lol
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 for ever
the ice pack on his arm at 1:50 then the pop sound when he was arm wrestling got me
This video really made my Sunday. I think I was smiling through the whole video.
💎
Hahah that blop
Beautiful ppl, beautiful country.
someone summon Phillion!
I went to the highlands for the first time last weekend and I fucking loved it so much.
Hilarious..Love the end..You'll look like you had an amazing time
God I miss the Scottish accent, I'm Australian but have been to Glasgow and Islay twice, and the one thing that really hooked me about Scotland was the generosity, and their accents!
This video gave me so much joy
He'll know ,finin do not shit like this you guys are the best l love, you guys
holy shit that little dude was actually strong as hell
https://youtu.be/TF39G7RIEKM
18:25 I heard Cracking 🦴🖐️💀
Just so gentle gaints. Wow. So much humility in them. ❤️
I’ve been a huge admirer of yes theory since the inception of the channel. But sorry to say this is the worst video I’ve ever watched across the whole YouTube platform 😔
Giants
The hide and seek was epic 😂
Stoltman  voice is like warrior-ish xD
I LITERALLY had genuine fun watching you guys have fun!😆 Anybody would have fun playing with Giants! Especially with those 2 brothers.Serously this video was great fun to watch for a change...👌
That water splash sound when he jumps. Hahahahahaha
It'll be interesting to see them play rugby.
I'm Caribbean so I thought unil I did my dna and I Nordik and Scottish and jewish. Also I live in the uk Holla me
So inspiring i want to be like them
BRO I JUST LOVE THIS VIDEOS 😇🙂💪
I just wanna live your life tho...
Absolutely captivating.   Love this stuff
These guys are gentle giants. So kind to their guests. Respect.
4:26 just a few extra random strangers to spice to up haha
They sound like giants. Hahaha
5:53 Eric on the right or whatever his name sulking like a man
Eric should get into strong man or weightlifting.. seems to have an affinity for it.
i havent laughed this many times during a yes theory video and its great. great stuff!!!
Wow
hahahahahhaahh the water drop sound effect at 4:11 👌
The naked scene at breakfast was intimate!
the hide and seek is so funny hahahahahaha 🤣
you should watch baki
These are amazing!! So cool and chill I used to think that big people are too serious kind of people and get angry faster 😅 But this pair is amazing 😍
Iam challenge for u capsule hotel in peru your spend in 24 hours their
- im 70 kg - that's cute
That was really awesome
Love these two guys and always amazing to see them smash the competition!
I like them they are a little goofy , really fun guy !  When i see them in TV i can't realise how big they are , but in your video it's incredible , i giant is a good therm for them !  I like them , they are super cool guy !
LETS GOOOOOOO
This is like looking at 2 fathers playing with 5 children and having a Blast! This is so wholesome, I love it!
Keep making these videos guys they always make me smile and warm my heart :)
great content
Giant's, where are they? they are 1,9M tall hardly a giant, average size in holland. Ever seen the Dutch Giant, he would eat these tiny haggis boy's up.
First time on your channel and this was amazing! The Stoltman Brothers were absolutely fantastic. Such wonder guys all of you
The "weakest man" had me punching my fist in the air when he finally got that stone up!
Thomas, please, it's "EXercise" not "Eggsercise"
The one guys voice is similar to old Andre's the most famous giant of these times. Why don't these guys try sumo? They would probably do well
Brilliant video with my favourite strongmen. Tom and Luke got me through lockdown. Very inspirational men.
One of my favorite videos thus far!  Was a lot of fun to watch!
Working out improves 100% mental health
I like those guys
Eric is fking STRONG
There voices prolly benches 120
This was awesome guys.
Boy o boy, such a crazy amount of steroids
6mins in and I notice being the world's strongest men looks a bit gay
Great video, can see that Luke and Tom are completely down to earth guys. They have worked so hard for there success in the world of strong man and this video just goes to show how grounded they are, love the Stoltman brothers, individually, very competitive, collectively a unstoppable force. The support they give each other is inspiring and i remember watching shortly after they lost there mom and they were competing a few years ago, and Luke had won a stones event i think it was and just held his arms up in the air and said, this is for you mom, brought tears to my eyes and i don`t even know them but there passion is so strong, you feel it, even from your own settee.
there not the strongest men in the world
Are you guys going to post a season 3 for the podcast!?
That was...um...a lot of man touching.  And that diet is how one gets the world's raunchiest gas emissions.
this nordic track thing looks so bad. you gonna get a damn rounded back from looking down at that screen for hours every week.
seeing them shirtless together it looks like they could swallow him whole
I really just want to know what their testosterone levels are of these giants!
I relate to Tom. I too was born with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. I'm on the "High Functioning" end which means that I am blessed with having more understanding of social situations, however, subtle social cues are still a problem for me because I am also visually impaired and cannot pick up on facial expressions properly. I didn't let that stop me though. I have just passed my BA Honours in Electronic Music Production and have had a somewhat successful start to my career. Just need to find a stable 9 to 5 now and I'm happy. Autism is a buzzword at the moment that people just don't understand. We work slightly differently. That's it. We aren't incompetent. We just need black and white instructions and coping mechanisms that help us grow. That is what I was given and I feel like I'm learning from it, along with my mistakes. Peace from the UK.
What nice men !! Must have wonderful family! Shows the humanity in the world ! GOD BLESS YOU!
bro i saw you in Paris you were running.
What a classy couple of giants
That guy from Yes Theory should really be a shoo-in for the part in a biopic of Tim Curry.  The resemblance is uncanny.
when the grid goes down and the collapse happens, these guys will starve to death
Minted video aw the wae fae Scotland🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I want me some Elbaf male 😍
A very wholesome and down-to-earth video. Loved it!
there voices even sound giant wtf?
Strongmen > bodybuilders
As a Yes Theory fan and strongman fanatic, this was the crossover I didn’t know I needed. Spicy! 🌶 🌶
Incredible strength and body but their character is what makes them special
Aka world's slowest men
That voice
When they're lifting 80kg a hand and you don't even weigh 40😅😅
Looks very similar to Ireland
dude this is an awesome video!!!!! Super fun, super motivating!!!!
It's crazy that natural strength isn't synonymous with a sculpted body.
What nice guys
7:30 do Americans say ekzer-cize?? cause we say it as ekser-cise.. so that completely sounded weird to me
I love the Stoltman brothers! Tom has autism and honestly he is one of the most beautiful people in the world. His brother Luke kinda gets left behind in his shadow, but Luke can do voice over work anywhere.
I've never seen these levels of testosterone that ended in laughter, pure joy and hugs. Epic video!
Day 19. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
This is so awesome, I feel a weird connection to this. I have lost 80 pounds since covid hit, but I have also lost contact with almost 80% of my friends. To fill that hole, I replaced it with working out and school. I go off to college in a year, and I am thrilled to see where Yes Theory goes, and where I will go.
That was one of the most uplifting videos I've seen. It's so nice to see the world's strongest men be the friendliest giants on earth. The strongest people lift others up, not put them down. 💪
The only difference he has with everyone else is that he’s Russian! That’s why he can do it! Inner Russian strength!!
As a descent of Spartans I tip my hat to them
ok im like 90% sure the greek gods were modelled after these guys
Loved it!
That picture with the 'GLASGOW' title isny Glasgow, it's Oban lol
Kinda gutted yes theory where in Scotland and none of us Scots knew..
this was beautiful. you’ve earned a like my friends.
This video had me cheesing the entire video. They are the sweetest giants! and you guys are so genuinely fun & secure in yourself. Such a fun video! ❤️‍🔥
💯
They are different type of humans. Like their genetics are superb they're built to be better humans than the rest of us. Does not make sense that people should be that big lol
Those bros are awesome
Magni and modi.
Lmao why they are hugging each other so often and why are these giants so kind :) Man thats just too wholesome ☺️
4:12 C’mon 🤞🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥 You didn’t have to...
its good to see giants so friendly, unlike the ones in my bible
This was incredibly wholesome, loved the video. The brothers look like genuinely awesome people.
"MY THUMBS ARE WAY BIGGER THAN YOURS, MWUAHAHAHA"
Legends! Very inspiring!
Alright!!! Skinny boy did it duct tape and all👍🤪
i love how freakin encouraging they are. Its simple an mondane for them, but they see it as a massive victory for you
Very good video! :)
Video Editor is having some major fun with the water drop sound. I see you and I enjoy it, Thank you.
I always love your videos, but this was really something else today! Great work by ALL! Stoltman a real inspiration
strong men sound so strong and you guys did a fentastic job as well
Think strongest man in history was fred dibnah human chimpanzee
Nah this guys are so humble and seeing yest theory team playing with them like with puppies or something it was amazing 🤣
Awesome People and their Awesome Experience, Here! On Yes Theory.
This is what I imagined what true Vikings looked like.
❤️❤️❤️
I wanna go and wee i really want to go back to Scotland i was brought up in edinbrugh i wish i could just go back i have lived away from scotlScotland for so long but there is something about Scotland and Scottish people that hits me take me backkk😭😭😭
The montage at the end had me dead
I was smiling through the whole video. This was amazing.
14:24 , that's how villains are borm
These are my 2 new favorite strongmen!! I love my Scottish heritage  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
would love to see you guys go to Yakutia apparently its getting to temperatures of about -71 degrees celcius
They even sound enormous
Did they tell you to breathe, my pasty friend, breathe? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRtDRoAsBqM
what a mannnn !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! absolute legend!!!!!!!!!!
Worlds fattest men
They seem like such cool dudes. And Tom's story is super inspiring about how the gym and being part of a good community helped him through having Autism.
That is awesome
Thanks for this video, very cool all of you.
Kind people
Seem like nice grounded boys thumbs up
This is insanely hilarious 😂😂😂
One of the Stoltman brothers has a tattoo named Khushi on left side of his chest which means Happy in Indian languages...
2 Heart attacks waiting to happen.
Wow that’s awesome the two brothers are real giant’s
you boys need a lady in your videos
I'm a Ulster Scot myself but I'm telling ya omg the voices are so deep too love these too bros omg love love love ya lads 😁😁⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐✌
Big lovable giants!
This video made me laugh like a maniac ,,,and OMG Eric you are freaking STRONG.
Considering the fact that a Scottish longhorn cow weighs in at around 500 kgs, and a bull at around 800 kg, it's no surprise that these guys are so effing strong...  And now I can hear someone ask -"what the hell does that have to do with anything, why are you pointing that out, what's wrong with you, and did you forget your medication again?", allow me, dear fellow viewer, to point out that the observant and aware will have noticed that the bovine elements of this video, clearly visible at the 3:13 minute mark, obviously are missing their legs, which as a result, if one applies logical deduction, only can mean that the Stoltman brothers have to move them around by hand.  My logic is flawless, this is not up for debate.
Big friendly Giants
This definitely makes me proud to call myself Scottish!
I have an idea, play an IRL hide and seek  with the sidemen and win
😔☔
i am 50 kilo....and i felt like a right till the end of this video...
♥️🌹❤️ what joy it would be to be cuddled by one of these gentle giants. ♥️🌹 He can put me in his pocket. 😀 I'm 5 ft.
wow
These are not giants..... Giants are of the old history that the establishment hides whenever their giant bones are discovered to keep the truth hidden inventing dinosaurs to keep you in the dark.....Sure creatures that where huge lived but not millions of years ago.. they where here when man was here as there are many cave paintings of them.....Now why would man paint one of these creatures if they died out so long ago..... bull shit people waaaaake uuuup
Very well done vid
I love the reaction their reaction on 14:14 . So beautiful
Ahhh wish I knew you guys were in Glasgow!! We have a beautiful place here, love to see you produce some content in our home!
You better have asked them to say "purple burglar alarm"
could you upgrade to 60fps ??
Man, dude in “spicy” shirt. how did he do that!!!!! Amazing would ever ever have imagined!!!! 👀
Hodor
Gentle Giants
Very nice brothers seems like a fun , kind people.
goddamn that small scrawny guy is strong
5:53 me and the boys the morning after the sleepover when mom made pancake
I miss you!!!
I want to see these guys and sumo wrestlers meet up and show each other their daily workout regimen because they are both pretty labor intensive
You guys should visit Tristan da cunha
I loved this ! It's funny and was super cool to see. As always loved the video guys !
Eric surprised me he really enjoyed doing this
i will be with you guys.... one day... for sure
Everyone, Jesus died for you, he loves you, and he want you to come to him. Repent from your sins and be baptized in his name, no unclean thing will enter the kingdom of God.  Hell is real nd the devil is trying to make sure many people follow him there, but Heaven is also real nd the lord is calling out to the people to repent from their sins, to flee from Worldliness nd follow him. The lord is calling but who will here his call. He has come near to u and he's calling u today to repent, believe and accept Jesus. There is no other way to eternal life, no good deeds or religion will take you to heaven, only through Jesus, he is the only way, the only truth nd the only life. All others re nothing. God is offering u his love, he's offering u everlasting life in his kingdom. The time is near, nd the coming of the Lord is at hand. Run to Jesus and seek him now, only he can save u from the destruction that is to come. Repent Jesus is coming soon.
used to call myself a man. after watching this video, i now call myself a girl
I fuckin love how happy they get for the lads lifting 100kg, even though they can do so much more. What absolute awesome and supportive guys
18:54 LOL this definitely has meme potential 😂😂
This is exactly how I would guess a giant speaks
A Great giant's saying- "Never judge a man by his biceps"
Pudzianowski was stronger
This is so wholesome hahaha love it
This is some Baki Hanma shit💪🏼😄💯
Most hearthwarming video I have seen in ages. Lovely guys.
Those guys seems to be such awesome people! This video made me Really happy! :) Thank you!
Truly awesome gentleman! Wished them continued success! 💜
I’m a Mom of several kids living in toxic mold/ causing sickness/ doctors want us to get out/ I can’t afford to/ go fund me page/ get out of mold infested mobile home Ann R. Thanks
They are literally gentle gaints
This brought me so much joy!! I love you guys. But I also am weirdly obsessed with strongmen competitions. This made me sooooo happy!
thanks for deleting a comment, Yes Theory = No Theory
Their voices, they fit them perfectly
Loved this! Great stuff 👌🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
I wanna spend a day with them too, how can i do that ?
Giant guts!
5:45 this guy is 400lb? Jesus Chris Amberlyn Reid is more massive then him
Omgoodness ❤️ I love this video. Amazing people ☺️
Help me too with my mental health 😭
Love the ethics and courtesy with each everyone interacts in the fitness industry, just love it.
Proud Nova Scotian (New Scotland), Canada but, family originated from Scotland, now I know where the brute strength comes from lol
Imagine if this experience ignited something in Eric and he starts training for strongman competitions.
Even their voice bruhh
Eric sure come out of nowhere with that show of strength. Love how he proved everyone wrong. 😆💯
im sorry but that excercise machine is just way to expensive for normal people to buy.
Best one yet...
This was awesome, I love how sweet and kind they both are. They definitely seem like some great dudes to hang out with. I wanna be friends with them too
You should check out   Tough Mudder UK
Their voices are so deep. Like cartoon character levels of super low voice. I love cuz if fits them perfectly.
Wow, one of the best episodes you guys have produced. The love and humility these two giants have, and shared, moved me with joy into tears of happiness. Wish we had world leaders as humble as these two men.
Veryy niceeee😅
I remember when I were about 8yr old in Scotland, my dad said jump in the sea, I did and nearly drown lol, couldnt breath it was so cold..
This was so cute
AHHH! I loved this video so much!!!!
this was a great episode. They were so happy to share this with you it was really clear!
Best one yet in my humble opinion
As a teen with autism who has recently started going to the gym, this guy is a huge inspiration!!
Looked like everyone had so so so much fun in Scotland! Very cool guys!!!! Talking about appetites!! Wonder how big the mom & dad are, were? Ty for great show!!
Damnnnn but I can’t help wonder how they would fling me up spin me around and toss me like a pizza😎 mi likey
wow this is wholesome, how the brothers are lovely huggers :D <3
If anyone messes with you in the future, call Eric first
I work with adults living with Autism. I am absolutely going to show them this video in our advocacy class.
Guys, I love your vids so much but gotta say this one had a smile on my face the whole way through. Are you coming down to the south of England?
This is hilarious
I'm guessing they don't own Smart cars!
i am austrian 🇦🇹 and i really needed some time to undestand the scotish accent(sorry for mistakes) but loved the video as always
Always wanted yes theory to go to Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 to see my home and how beautiful it is
That’s cute innit
Missing you Scotland! <3
this video was so much fun to watch :) scotland is beautiful!
Awesome
Stay spicy 🌶
Since you enjoy starting your day diving into the cold water, you should definitely start 2022 with the Dutch tradition of the new year’s dive, when thousands of Dutch people dive into the North Sea!
Love how the weakest dude ends up being the strongest in the group aside from the Giants
Nordic track treadmill looks very expensive, and they got good sponsor ship.
World's richest man and strongest man both have autism. Autism is a superpower🤘
Hello from Moldova , guys you are the best  ..
I dont see brian shaw in here
Not the strongest****
After watching the first 8 min of the video, I got so inspired I went to the gym! Thank you for this amazing heartwarming story!
The biggest, the strongest, yet the sweetest ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
*_The ending: Didn't you learn anything from Squid Games, you wimps!_*
Crazy editing HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA that arm wrestle while taking a bite HAHHAHAHAHAHHAA. damn...... these bros are HUGE @_ @........
this is such an important viedo, not just because it is highly entertaining but also because it shows not to judge a bpk by its cover!!!!
This is literally my dream to workout with WSM. They're my motivation for going to the gym, I want to be strong.
Big dudes don't need to put on the "tough act" they know they can stump you at any point
Dudes are jacckkeedd ass ffkkk
Glasgow sure does look a lot like Oban these days haha
That Borat’s Iconic Very Nice was so awesome
when are you guys going to come yo Iceland???
The sweetest part was how many hugs they would give
ERIC IS IN YES THEORY NOW ?? YEEEAAASSSHH
cool!
How tall are they?
🤣 they look so funny next them without shirts 😂 omg. Made my morning
Yous were in Glasgow😭😭😭 OMGGGG
Thank god their that big… could you imagine them with that voice and a small normal body? Lol I could listen to them talk all day. But damn they have some deeeeepppppp voices
Where is Brian Shaw??
This was outstanding! I loved it.  My wildest dream...to meet them personally and be carried by one of them!!!
Man, never been more proud of my heritage. Epic Episde!!!
Truly inspirational brothers, I wish them every happiness and success in life

Stoltman brothers, Scotland’s giants with gentle hearts !
I feel so small now :0

I really enjoyed that really well put together 👍
This was so much fun to watch, thanks! :D

This was inspiring.
Amazing episode, loved these 2 big guys!
Two fierce giants turn out to be adorable teddy bears!
stronk
LOOOOOOOL THIS IS HILARIOUS
Man.... Scotland is such a beautiful country. The history alone is enough to leave me flabbergasted. Then you add the gorgeous scenery and the culture.... Truly, the most beautiful place on Earth.
10k kcal... thats 4x what a average male needs
The *blop* edit at 4:11 killed me😂😂👍
Not what I expected at all, wonderful men! It’s so clear Luke has a heart of gold and cares so much. This video made me smile so much! Thank you guys
So cool..Im actually from a town outside of Scotland that holds the longest running highland games in the world and I actually met Eddie Hall and Brian Shawn a few years back. They were filling a show for the discovery Channel..It was a pretty wicked experience
My favourite video of all time
these men could literally carry me like i'm their bride.
they are amazing
4:10 The dropplet sound 😂
“GLASGOW” …shows Oban…
Super Awesome
I’ve lived in Scotland my whole life and I’ve never ever seen the Scottish highlands referred to as “The Scotland Highlands”… just seems… wrong
Aaaand now I need a tall drink of water 🤣
Are they... Single.... 👀 Asking for a friend
That one dude in the group is strong asf!
Aaawh they are soo cutee 🥺. Such a sweethearts!!
The drone shots are exceptional with the Scottish music as bgm
Arghhh you’re in England… 🥳🥳🥳🥳. If you travel to Europe I hope you catch one of the flights I work. Arghhhh
loved this!
I love how this channel portrays human beings ❤️ Thank you for another inspiring and funny story!
These are the most Scottish men I’ve ever seen
the Serotonin I got at 14:20 !!!!!
Awesome video
I live for the outro
2:13 it's not Glasgow it's Oban that is 3h away 😅 recently CNN reported Glasgow event from Edinburgh, you guys okay there  😜?
You guys should come and check out New Zealand
Scotland is the most beautiful part of the UK, the Scots are really nice/ sweetest ppl i have ever met. hope you guys had fun “cheers mate!!”
This is one of the best videos I've seen, great job Yes Theory. The warmth, the friendship, the jokes, everything was amazing in this video. Thanks a lot big Stoltman brothers for making this happen.
This was absolutely epic! I love with even how much these 2 have accomplished they are still so super down to earth and humble and just plain friendly. What an awesome video <3
I just love how both of them lifted up Eric when he completed the stone challenge.
I’m fae Edinburgh Scotland and use to go to Helmsdale to watch the games in August x
I lost it at the hide n seek 😂😂
They are so wholesome
I am ready
Very niceeee
Your quality especially in the last 3 videos is incredible,keep going !
Love how Glasgow wasn’t scenic enough so Oban was used as a stand in 😂. Great video though folks, loved it.
Thank you for this! I'm smiling while watching the whole video. Thank you!
Lucky this isn't squid game.......
The strongest men in the world wears a skirt a.k.a Kilt. Let that sink in!
You have been struggling with chronic muscle injuries since the age of 18?...what happened?
18:44 yup that's shaggy from Scooby-Doo 😆😅
Idk why, the strongest people always seem the nicest, contrary to belief
Great story, greetings from Lima
eggzercise
Such a Fantastic episode!!! These giants have even more giant hearts!
I love hope genuinely happy the Stoltman brothers were when you guys lifted the stones. Huge respect for those two.
"in viking mythology" made me lose my shit laughing
This is soo motivating 😭😭 I'm crying rn. Going from autism to world's strongest 🤯
This was an amazing episode!! Love yes theory and their adventures!! Stoltman brothers are elite!
This was fun to watch tysm I enjoy'ed

19:51 Borat Reference
Two softhearted person with giant bodies
Imagine leaving bad comment here and then seeing 20:24 outside your house :D :D
They seem like fun , humble cool guys ! Great video !
Yikes! When they started to pick up the stones I was so afraid they were going to drop it on their toes!
Their voice have more testosterone than my whole body 😂
Eric !!!!🔥🔥🔥
ok but I'm genuinely shocked at how strong Eric is wow!! He did amazingly, even though I feel like on the surface one would think Tommy's stronger!! He truly was blessed by the grandma from Transnistria, but idk why Thomas wasn't too xD
Remembers me of the meme with 3 muscular men at the PC help a insecure boy by answer his questions.
Its cute and weird watching giants jump like teenagers
I’ve never been more hyped or proud of men lifting a stone. This was awesome!
i love this
The bass from their voices is insane lol
More people need to see this video. This is the stuff that wholesome is made of.
Strongmen wearing dresses🥴
This was a really good video that showed a different perspective and their humor made the video just as amazing as their strength. I truly enjoyed watching this.
Hello Yes Theory, would you help me to build my own gym in my small city called Malang in Indonesia, please  ? if you do that, i make my gym open to public and it's free :)
For some reason I keep feeling like this channel is more and more a boys space.
Looks like  a new Gachi Muchi video 🖤
Great guys. Good luck on your future endeavor.
They have the world's strongest voice as well 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
From the moment one of you fellas picking up the 200kg stone ball to the other guy farting under the weight of the big fella, I was cheering and laughing the whole time. This is one of the best piece of journalism I've seen in a long time on YouTube. Special kudos to the editing that made this video a masterpiece!
Hello such a big fan of your channel I was wishing if one day you guys can go visit  El Salvador it's a small country in Central America its a country that has been through alot also it has such a beautiful culture I'll just leave it to you guys Love your channel ❤ 💙 💜
Best video so far! These giants are beautiful human beings.
Spicy video
Unfair, it's because he's Russian! 😂😂😂 but for real though awesome video guys. 👍
His voice is even deeper than the deepest hole in the world
A bit frustrated for excluded their eating regime apart from breakfast...
Really enjoyed this one!
So much fun to watch, good job 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
You guys are great - don’t sell out with advertisements. Just take sponsorship.
WoW, just WoW.
Amazing :)
the bit at the end was soooo funny please do that more often at the end of an adventure!!!!
I think this must be the funniest video ever
Brooo I randomly came across this video and I’m so happy I didn’t I truly enjoyed this and never thought a video like this would bring me so much joy.. god bless you all💯🙏🤟
I was literally smiling the whole time just by watching this video.  Your content is always awe-inspiring.  Love from  🇵🇭
You guys should visit Brunei Darussalam and see whats it like here :) after covid of course.
These guys might be the strongest man on the planets but they're also the most strongest hearts in the world! so big yet so gentle!
If I met them I would have such a strong urge to constantly ask for them to pick me up and hold me like a baby LOL
best video ive seen in awhile.  ty!!
The Stoltman brothers are awesome!! Great video!
i honestly thought he was using voice changer.    Now i realized he is the voice behind "that" voice changer. wtf
That drop sound at 4:09 is hilarious 😂😂😂
Brian shaw
One of yes theory's best post to date.  Inspirational, funny asf, uplifting and Eric wow.  I could give them a run for their money eating their breakfast though lol
Super cool video! Surely got me motivated to go out and hit the gym 💪🏻  💡 Video idea:: train like superheroes, lets see who can get that top top shape, Thomas or Ammar 😁
I knew i could be skinny and strong. This proves it all
Great video I am here to Seek Discomfort always
Day in the life of a Baki character
Eric is Russian No surprise haha Great video fellas Keep up the great work 🤙🏼
Im crying!! the brotherhood  is amazing..wow.!
The shot at breakfast with their shirts off was brilliant. Holy cannoli they’re giants! 🙋🏻‍♀️♥️
One of my favourite videos 🙂🙂✨
This is one of my top favorite videos in YouTube
That love and dedication to his brother brought tears to my eye's. I love and respect people who show their humanity to each other. Best wishes and good luck to them both.
12:10 Grocery carrying training... One trip!!!
Loved this SO much!
Been fans of Tom and luke for a while. I predicated Tom was gonna be wsm back when they were doing a lot of training with Eddie hall. He’s truly massive and has the potential to be an all time great strongman. Just for reference, Tom has the world record for lifting the largest atlas stone. Just under 300 kg. To put that into perspective, that’s a little over 600 pounds that he has to bend over, pick up, and launch over a beam. 99% of  people could never even deadlift that amount of weight much less throw it over a bar. It’s incredible strength. They seem to be really good guys too. I’m glad they’re getting the attention they deserve.
Because Eric is Russian, duh.
Hi Guys, I met you all in Glasgow in the Arena - we are the Giants Live team aka Official Strongman. Got to say this was great video ! You may well remember me as I was the stressed guy around the back who feared you may stitch us up somehow. Au contraire - how wrong I could be - your work speaks volumes as to the kind of men you are. You've definitely captured the spirit of the Stoltman Brothers!  Great men. I must admit I chuckled outloud at your gags! A nice take on Scotland and strength history too. We'll have to get you to make our opening videos for the big screen!  lol..If you ever want to come back and watch some more strongman you are all very welcome and you certainly have more fans  and a subscriber from Giants Live/Official Strongman channel too. Bravo!
I imagine how small I would be if I stand next to the Stoltman Brothers😂 And Eric, you’re awesomeeee!!
This is awesome, so wholesome such great vibes. This video made my night!
I don’t know how they are the strongest they look obese
Taking your shirts off for the breakfast scene, got me good! I died..
What awesome guys! This is a great video!
These guys have beautiful souls
They're just so big that they don't even have to try to be funny. They just are ahahah
These guys actually seem like incredible human beings, not because there strength but there hearts
Wow powerful video guys. Amazing story on Tom Stoltman and autism. What an inspiration he will be
Humble giants
19:31 my boy getting teabagged
This is such a great video! 🔥🔥🔥
God I wanna go lift heavy shit now
how is eric so strong hahahha
......and they bro out on the ball lifting.......
U guys are soooo funny
I wanna hear him say “anybody wanna peanut”
No way. I love these guys. All the strongmen seem like really nice people
What’s up Broski 🦋✨🦋
18:33 that scene looks familiar...😅
eric kinda looks like connor murphy
I loved every minute of this video.
YES NAMBAWAN!
My first time seeing this channel in my feed and I love this video! Very informative!!
Very fun😃🥰
So many great shots in here showing the contrast of the bois and the BOIS
To go on a Viking is a terrible act of violence, not a people. They are nordic.
ID So love to try tihs in a group setting like you guys did im 6 '3 and 280 lbs lol i think i could do a few of thies altho the sand bag would be the hardest i think
Yes.. Were up to the challenge sir
This was the Bro-est thing have watched on YouTube.
Iron bibi from Burkina Faso is currently the world's strongest man
You should go to south sudan to see min 2m tall and more
At 10:04 - that's where the big boys come out and play Thats literally the best thing he could have said😆
The only thing I didn't like about this video is that it wasn't longer!
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍.
this video was awesome
That feeling when you first lift a stone.

Inverness is such a beautiful place to visit. Love Scotland🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
If i was healthy i could of been as strong as thoses guys ;)
5:57 LOLLL
Ay yo, these two titans show more emotion to their small counterparts than how the gods showed to the giants.
20:25 look at the size difference between their left and right arm
nah that's wholesome
Them hiding had me dead😂😂
This video has so much Joy   than ever love it <3
This just goes to show that, it doesnt matter how big you look, what matters most is the strength of your character & how you treat others. 💪
W
Their voices sound like there's a microphone stuck to their throats 😂
Never had a dad in my life and I sure wish these guys are my dads! So cute and strong! Wohooo
YOU GUYS SHOULD DONATE TO TEAM SEAS IF YOU HAVEN’T ALREADY!!!!
This is the funniest episode
Love the content and you guys are great as always. The Stoltman brothers are incredible in strength and as people. It was nice learning about them 💪🏻💪🏻
would be cool to see more strongmen episodes. A lot of them are like this. Brian shaw is one of the most humble men on the planet. If you ever watch backstage videos of a show, they're always rooting for everyone to do well.
I train and practice mma and do lots of spar. I can’t let myself be this big. Slow movement and the restraint from being flexible is out the window
Imagine they are your brothers
I like seeing men play  lift weights, with machinery, and fix thing.  All I wanted was a husband to mow my lawn and change my tire..  I would have cooked what ever food he wanted
i remember when this channel had 10k subs.
I like my men thick in the thighs  Juicy  in the booth Broad in the arms
70 kilos that is cute lmao
Something about a thick says the flustered blushing Haitian Girl..
I just watched the Highland Games part of Brave and whaddya know this video is trending lol
These white guys  are so hot   Scottish  Irish  and Russian  men to me are soooooooo sexy
Love you guys
I have learned from this video and previous videos, you don't have to focus on burning body excess fat to be strong.
good thing their voice fits their physiques
....I wanted to buy your apparel because im obsessed with the shirt you wore in this video....but of course it's not available to the public...guess I'm not cool enough:(
Glasgow is cool.
PDP ice age baby dies-https://youtu.be/CRCU9889lLg
I had the absolute biggest smile on my face watching this video.. Start through to the end
Me:What would you say if you were with the boys and there was a interview on national TV about a kid that shot up a school and sang a song that went yeah I pulled an  ak-47 from my backpack im finna get ready to start  subtracting yeah im racking more bodies than a cod pro thats how you know that I'm the goat I shot the school so violently I ended up on national TV yeah I set all those kids soul free they in heaven with they fathers now life is a never ending story and im the author?  Wendy's employee:Sir this is a Wendy's.
Those guys seem really cool! Amazing video fellas ✌️❤️
They sound like they've inhaled SF6 (The opposite of helium)
Now I know why ma porridge keeps going missing
How is Eric that strong hahaha
It's amazing how much they are kind and funny, I want to meet them, and it's amazing what you are building in this channel, thank you a lot guys
this is amazing <3
4:10 💀😂
I live next door to Tom. Technically on the same row but I don’t know the number of houses. So next door will suffice 🤣 assuming he hasn’t moved. Haven’t seen him in a while honestly. Don’t think he has tho!
loved the video
This two giants are so chill
You guys are huge but can tell big Teddy bears. Enjoyed watching yall regularly day life. Thank you
When a strongman genuinely asks you "how are you so strong"...I'd definitely never forget that
Maybe you guys should go Latvia and go wild camping.
Imagine Shaq as a bodybuilder. Let that thought settle in....
I'm planning on throwing a two day New Years party in my home town of San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, it could be cool if you help plan and join. Ya'll could say in a the shipping container home rented out with me and my friends.  San Miguel de Allende is a beautiful town centered around the arts and numerous natural hot springs, I grew up there as a mixed Afro-Mexican & Cuban kid and am totally in love with home. I am currently a student at the University of Denver and after I graduate I plan to return to my home town and open an arts school. Little snip bit about me. Hope all is good!
I just love hearing them talk
there is no "struggling with autism". no one is "with autism" you are autistic. you are born with it and you die with it. this is one of my biggest pet peeves about neurotypical people. they act like we are struggling when we are fine. a lot of us have depression which is something we struggle with but please stop painting us in this way.
What a wholesome video :)
Wow wow wooowwwwwww how awesome!!!! Autism? Where? These men are absolutely awesome! Love this!
0.625% off a NordicTrack nice
just listening to their voice makes you think theyre strong
A little bit homoerotic at times....
Great video , those bros are awesome
Being British this collab hasn’t made me happier it is a great video I love it❤️
what lovely giants
The best part about this video is that these 2 guys are just a couple of local lads. Yes they may be extraordinary in strength but their personalities are just pure Scotland. These guys are perfect ambassadors for our country. If I ever catch either of them on the street their next beer or 12 pack of eggs are on me.
You have to respect and admire their work ethic. It's incredible.
This was very good and inspiring. Thank you.
19:26 - No one is gonna comment on these dude playing nekked Twister? 🤣  Nicest guys all kidding aside… true ambassadors of the sport!

This video is just jokes love it 🤣
Your videos are always so entertaining lol. Great cinematography.

The sound effects in this are golden 😂

Best video I've seen in ages. Give the Stoltman Brothers their own show!  Can't believe how much I rooted for you lifting the Stones..... outstanding. Inspirational.
Evil Yes Theory be like: No Theory
This is literally the "me and the boys" episode.
14:42 Luke is proud while Tom is wondering how to take out this new competition 😂
Y’all killing it
Thomas is 2 years older than Tom

How tf is eric so strong
They are local to me and absolutely legends
cold waves weren't the only thing pounding tomas that weekend, these twin bodybuilders ran a train on him the entire time 🤣 👀😂 & Stop being so mean to Eric "the new guy" he's the best thing to happen on this channel in ages
Day 18. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
This video was really fun to watch, great work guys!
I really wanted to see Tom vs all three in a tug of war
I literally went to the gym for the first time today and then i come home and see this video.. this was the motivation I needed. To see that dude go from super skinny to that… like If I can even reach a fraction of that i will consider it a success
I wonder if they’re big “everywhere” ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
those bellies scream "on the juice"
Never been more proud to be Scottish
As a Scotsman I wish a could go to Inverness as IV only as far as Aberdeen and as low as York I love Scotland as it's the best
yes theory should start a fitness channel <3
Oh my, I cried and laughed so much! :D Thank you for this <3
Seeing the strongest men on earth doing funny, careless things like the hide and seak parody is something else. The attitude and smile, dude, the brothers are absolutely amazing people. Keep inspiring! Thank you for making this video! 🙌
18:18 the nfl is shitting themselves with this one, how’s he moving like that at 400 fucking pounds!!!!!
Owesome
Damn, this video will be great promotion for the sport of strongman!
🌶🌶🌶
man sounds like thanos
Omg! I love them. They are the most adorable teddy bears I've ever seen.   The look intimidating at first, but after a few minutes in the video they just exude this joy that is so contagious.  Also, ERIC, I love you. :)
i love how excited the brothers were when he lifted a stone Tom could probably palm
They would be awesome in a medieval movie pounding bad guys 😆 lol
18:05 When you weigh 132 lbs and go to the absolute division to fight a ultra heavyweight guy and your coach yells "hip escape! HIP ESCAPE!"
Shiet episode
Thank you for amazing episode.
thw bits after 17:27 had me crying of laughter the entire time, Love it!
Built like hulk, soft like a 🧸
strong in body, fun at heart!
God I love Youtube
Such great content
Best outro yet! Keep up the good work fellas!
Eric is the real star of Yes Theory and Seek Discomfort. 🔥
Those guys remind me of those strong enemies/ thugs in Batman Arkham Knight
Tom Stoltman is a living hero and Luke Stoltman is quite literally one of the greatest men to ever walk on earth   Best Brothers in History
That's cute @ 9:55   That got me laughing.
Luke Stoltmans voice is incredible, he should be doing movies with a voice like that.
Lmao great video as always but I choose not to believe that anyone is willing to order a $2000+ treadmill with a $75 off promo 🤣.
That guy is over 180kg and I’m 45kg. That’s crazy he would be able to lift me up with one hand

No way. That’s mad to think you guys were Just a few hours away from me.  Great video 👍
Bros have vocal boxes deeper than Mariana Trench
Loved the video, great strongman content💯
Most wholesome thing i've seen this year, awesome!
'The Scotland Highland' is a bit jarring to a Brit, but still amazing video as always!
What an amazing film,
Tom has quickly become one of my favorite WSM winners of all time and the love from Luke is always heartwarming to hear, not to mention his own achievements as Europe's strongest man. Thanks for the video guys, actually the first one I'm watching on this channel so a great introduction to you as a strongman fan
Great video!  I'm gonna have to check out some of the other videos now.
They are so friendly 😂😂
i love this
How many calories do you eat a day? Stoltman Brothers: yes! xD
It is my dream to hike the 7 summits and I want you to come along! @Yestheory, r u in???
You guys should convince a stranger to come to Aruba
These guys got that houston screwed up voice naturally lol
easily one of my favourite videos epic  gentle giants  true gentlemen
This is the most homo-erotic YouTube video ever, Topless dudes running around hugging each other in the Scottish Highlands
Damn this video was so inspiring and lots of fun! Now i want to go back to gym from where i just came and go heavy on deadlift
sometimes I look in the mirror and flex thinking im big but these videos give me a reality check.
This is a fun episode imo...love every bit of it 😊
They seem super calm and friendly.
Luke and Tom are some genuine dudes. That was a sweet video.
These guys are literally the sweetest, most kind! Truly shines never judge a book by its cover..
By far one of my favorite videos yet! Love this so much!
My absolute favourite yes theory episode
Eating all that - everyday - is a job.
The video i didn't know ineed
I bet Tom's slap can make you have out of body experiences.
They also sound strong 😅

That cute smile at 5:50 oh man.. these guys are just awesome.
This is so epic... Masterpiece ❤️ The Brothers are sooo strong and sweet and humble. Such a joy you bring us 😍 Eriiiiiiic woooow

As a bagpiper ive always watched the heavy events at highland games and enjoyed them. this was a cool excerpt to a different part of the games.

Thomas: I'm 70 kg Strongman: that's cute innit?
I never comment on YouTube videos and have been a long time subscriber but I just had to say how amazing this episode was. Really one of my all time favs!! Well done guys and thanks for introducing us to the fantastic Stoltman Brothers!
I thought I was just having some drunken hallucination when I saw Thomas in Glasgow city centre a few weeks ago when waiting in a nightclub queue. Turns out I wasn’t seeing things, it was definitely him in that leather jacket. Hope you had fun
Americans seeing kilos:😅
The guys are so nice and cool totally awesome
Eric is russian, that should say alot
SO cool!
Omg! I haven't laughed and smiled so much at one short video!! Thanks so much for that! Those guys look like a blast to be around!!
The most beautiful gentle giants with the biggest hearts, I just know they would make me feel so comfortable just being around them. This has to be by far one of my favourite videos.
Ohhh that is sooo awesome he has a sunflower tattoo 💛.. Thats a man👍🇨🇦❤🤗
You guys should go to Cerro Gordo mining ghost town and go into the mines with brent!
Amazing people, keep up the good work!
Watching this whilst eating my mcdonalds...
Best video ❤️
Love the stoltman brothers , kind and humble peple  Huge Respect for you guys🙏
🥰✌️
This is what I love about this whole idea. Every single episode brings new hope and love to us all. Thanks guys. 👍👍👍
Blind date with a giant how its go.? A good topic.😁
squid game tug of war would be scary with them on the other end
Great video, as always! Only comment is that at 2:12 you mention Glasgow but that footage is of Oban
Gonna go lift some rocks brb
Sean Cody is typing...
This is honestly the best video I've watched this year! It just radiates wholesome
Nobody:   Thomas: "eggsercise"
I really enjoyed this video you guys killed it!

the last supper but two people are eating on behalf of everyone
That was epic! Since you are in Europe you have to come visit Athens!
Eric was really good at lifting them weights. something sus going on there 😂
This was one of my faves!
Tom is an amazing inspiration for any with autism, 2 of the genuine guys anyone could ever meet, respect.
One of my favorite Yes Theory videos all year 👏🏼😂
This is one of the best videos i enjoyed it. Lots of love to our giants ❤️
This was so nice. SO wholesome :)
Spend a day with Taliban.. Let's see if you can do that, Because I heard no Americans want to do that .
he voice like anonymous
You got a thumbs down for hiding the Nordic machines ads in your videos.
Such a dope video.
damn this was a really good video
So emotional I love these guys
This was fun. Saw you guys for the first time just because of the Stoltman brothers.
I can hear the testosterone coming from the elder brother...
This was the first time watching the strongest man in the world...never knew they would be so friendly they are cool man...lot and lots of love and thanks to yes theory for this video...awesome video guys
Loved the music in this!
Brilliant.
That man sounds like everyone’s voice if you adjusted it on ps3 to make it deeper
They had way too much fun making this video...
The most important question hasn‘t been asked thoo how much can they bench
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Great content as always!
Down to earth gentle giants God bless.
👇👇 https://youtu.be/UTapeU7tmpY
this was an absolute blast of a watch!
What a episode love it
That guy's voice is so deep, it sounds anonymous.
the only one I see the strongest is Gojo Satoru
You guys should educate yourself more on disability studies, using phrases like “odds stacked against you” in a video that’s showcasing and celebrating someone who identifies with autism is placing autism in a bad light as something to be “overcome”. This simply isn’t true and can be really harmful to promote. As a really progressive and cool channel with a huge following and therefore a big impact you should really make sure your familiar with disability studies ways of talking about disability before addressing it within content!
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!
18:52 Gold!!
How can someone dislike this video?!
"We took the weakest man with us" WE TOOK THE WEAKEST MAN WITH US? Yeah you did ;)
Both giants brothers are super kind & lovely person! ❤️ much love from Tibet!
Oslo and Helsinki 😂
The voice of luke and tom.. Especially luke...is real manly like a big monster ...galactus,hulk??? U knw what i mean
Wow, they are so nice🥺😃. What a cute video🧡
This ain’t the world strongest men these are the worlds gentlest giants.
These brothers are so wholesome ❤️ All the hardships they had to go through and still be good men, yes they really are superheroes !
Gentle giants you gotta love this. ❤
"that's cute innit"
the giant men definitely my type :)
I didn't notice the man in the middle
when 70 kilograms is just cute! one of the most hilarious videos ive seen here!
This has got to be one of the best episodes. Humble giants. Champions. All the best on your strong man journey
they have the deepest voice ever feels very cool
“Tom’s 186kg,like 400+ lbs I guess” *big tommy just looks over with a big cheeky grin 🤣🤣
Their voices are so deep lmao
They seem like the nicest guys ever
This may be the most wholesome video in history
They are fkn huge
ahhhh i love this so much!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
They seem like the nicest people going
I hope you tour them around the world try to imagine 2 giants traveling and trying new stuff
When Glasgow flashed up infront of a picture of Oban I was a bit confused, then I remembered that the US is far bigger so travelling from Oban to Glasgow is nothing
So proud of Tom and his brother. Inspirational stories. Great video from Yes Theory again!
This video was simply amazing!
Terrific episode! Love it!
Wow lovely & very informative video,looking forward to see more. Its me (Bro Arman tv) my youtube channel.
Youse came to Scotland! Hope you all had a wonderful time!! I stay near near Aberdeen!
Gentle Giants exists mannn!
I feel like I'm watching an episode of *Fun-Size Boys*  I love it
Anyone else hear Thomas' elbow pop while arm wrestling?
I saw you at the paris masters tournament
LOL
Yall at the Paris 1000
Ladies and gentleman, the Gentle Giants.
And now, try living with a crackhead for 3 to 4 days and how they survive their day hustlin' and grinding for money. And convince them to stop using drugs.
this is how bros hangout cheering for every manly things we do
YES THEORY's Videos are so good that I don't even feel like skipping sponsored part.
Really enjoyed this episode!
Best video ever 🖤
Wow, so inspiring!!!! The Stoltman brothers are beasts! And Tom is definitely life changing. I got goosebumps just watching this - even threw out a happy laugh after seeing the Stoltman brothers reaction when you guys lifted the 100 kg ROCK. What a great video.
Yes! I’m so happy to see yes theory do a video with strongmen (world’s strongest brothers). Tom is the future.
Awesome to see Scotland in this episode you should come back and see more would love to show you around The place that keeps the world flying ✈️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
They look so big and mean with their tattoos but they are so nice and happy lol I love it
Ain’t that the dude from buzz feed
Fast forward to 2023... Eric has been working out this whole time and is now a strongman in his own right.
I think this is the best thing you could do with the boys....
i lob this channel ..i will meet u as soon as i come to states sometime in future
This guys are so coool
I love the positivity in this video. Big smile.
You say you're spending a day with giants but I don't see Nikocado Avocado.  CLICKBAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Beautiful episode. There's so many people that become victims of unchangeable circumstances in the world. It's heartwarming to see how our differences make us unique and (no pun intended) stronger.
Love their dynamic together, so fun
just imagining eating 10k calories A DAY makes me almost vomit
Friendly giants, great video
I now have a sudden urge to go to the gym To be strong
One of the best videos
This was so fun to watch and I really enjoyed the parts where they told their stories and they played games
Eric proving all of them wrong by being the strongest out of the three, YES ERIC GO OFF!
This video seemed so genuine, fun and what an experience! I felt a little jealous that I wasn't there with you guys and the brothers seem super nice as well! Great job, guys!
Who is stronger, the Worlds strongest man, or his brother, Europes (2nd?) strongest? (And both it seems thoroughly nice chaps!)
Forget about their strength, I want to live in their hometown, what a beautiful place..
Just imagine if they ever join the UFC
Wow this video was amazing. One of your best ones ever!
2:12 Thats Oban
Is like 2 big brothers with there little brothers
Dude is the personification of the girls with autism vs boys with autism meme
Incredible video, guys!
This was so sweet. I love that everywhere you guys go, you befriend everyone and it seems like you've been friend for years.
Brilliant video!!!
I think it's your funniest and craziest video so far😂😂
If I had one day left to live I want to spend it with those guys doing what they do for a day because I see more people live in their lives to the fullest
Cool, thanks, but where can I get that fluffy hoodie you're wearing during your NordicTrack advert? Thanks!
💚💛❤️loved it
"very nice" that borrat impersonation was golden
18:26 your welcome
That's Oban @ 2:12 not Glasgow.
and look who is the narrowest one of all...
Strongman/woman should be an Olympic sport.
The look scary, but they are the kindest ppl
They are like the coolest nicest guys ever those giants
They are the best definition of friendly giants 😊
That droplet sound at 4:11 ... :D
185 kilo...woooowww...I can see the spoon on their hands just like they eat with a toothpick....massive...
He is carrying them like hobbits😂😅 really cool story
Spend the day with me bro

Me as 160cm watching this 😀 anyways i love this

Eric’s Russian childhood really brings out the gladiator in him hahaha
Imagine their mum having to feed those boys, must’ve been $$$ lol
You throw in a drawing of Bjorn Ironside for one second, you get my like. Plain and simple
Who else picked because the Yes Theory guy was shirtless and you wanted to see that s***?
Eric being the biggest plot twist of this video is immaculate
thats not a life
god I wish I could meat these guys they are like you said giants I'm in to training and gym and stuff I'd love to open up my own gym someday on that tripp "adventure" I really hope I can meet guys like these two monsters with a golden heart lol you are awesome as well for training with them :D
Lmao this is the best episode ever 🤣😂 i laughed and cried lol
these guys voices are also ripped
Are you still in Scotland? Would be ace to meet yall!
having met these boys I can tell you they are the most genuine human beings you could ever meet.  No one deserves the success more than them.
"Yeah Buddy!" ~ Ronnie Coleman and now the Stoltman Brothers
Great fun to watch !! ☺
The reason why Eric was able to lift all those weights, is because he's got the Russian blood flowing through him. Russians are built different. 😂
Bro the strength of eric is off the chart
Once you lift an Atlas Stone for the first time, the idea of using Nordic Track slips into oblivion. A strongman is born!
Awesome video and awesome people
This was one of the most awesome, funny and most genuine videos about two gentle giants who just happen to also be the strongest men in Europe and the World. Amazing work to all involved 🤝🏾
Girlfriend m: hes probably cheating on me -.-  Me and the bois:

I love seeing a big manly man with flower 🌼 tattoos :) its so cute, no holmo lol
These brothers are sooooo unbelievably cool!

Easily one of the best videos yet from yes theories, what a great trip you guys have went on. What a story these two brothers hold, true human giants.
Stoltman's are a class act!
This made me wanna lift up my 40kg dog. I got his two front legs up, I'm a beast.

Who else tensed their abs when they say Tom lifting the stone ball the first time?? haha
Wow! True gentle giants🙏🏻💜🇨🇦
Sorry guys, As a homegrown Scot I would be remiss if I didn't correct the Oban, Glasgow mistake. Great vid guys.

Mariusz Pudzianowski is actually the strongest. He has the most titles of the world strongest men.
5:58 i thought i clicked youtube

Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.
Was hoping to see BIG Z in this video 👀

Good job!
"hes probably cheating" me and the boys: 14:29

This is the best video on the internet.
These guys are the definition of a gentle giant! They seem so genuinely nice and sweet!
Thomas is the weakest lol
They would be the best huggers hands down
Wheres the tug of war
I found this both humouistic and strangely homoerotic
these voices....are not edited????
4:12 you did him wrong 🤣💧
3:30 that was adorable 😂
im gonna hit the gym ASAP
They wasted a lot of food.
eric just has that russian raw power
By time I finished the clip had a smile on my face😊😊😊
Cool 👍🏽👏🏽
I really enjoyed this :)
These guys are beasts
I’ve been following these guys as well as Brian Shaw, Eddie Hall and Robert Oberst for a few years now and they’re all such awesome, down to earth, inspirational guys. Work hard but have fun.The sport has a real brotherhood around it. People should defiantly check out all these guy’s channels, but Brian at least, such good guys.
Eric is my crush 😂
I was thrilled to hear you pronounce Glasgow correctly after Biden kept saying Glass cow for cop26 lol.  But then you used a picture of Oban for Glasgow at 2:11 :(
Has to be so great for the lower back
Is it just me? kinda feels like Thomas hangout with the Asgardian
a video for team seas guys
Mjolnir would just come to them after seeing this.
This was epic in a chill way. Love the energy! The brothers seem super cool and down to earth. I know they appreciated the down time. Great content.
They're really a strong man this is video is epic glad you guys had fun
I have 2 special needs kids and therefor get no time to work out anymore.Would be so cool to have a nordictrack, I hear they are incredible. Seeing Tom's accomplishments is encouraging for my daughters lives
Yes yes yes in the Uk 🇬🇧
Picking up that ball is all back. Can’t be good
4:36 look at the sun raising between his traps and delts lol
Man! I smiled during the whole video, your positivity is contagious!
Before the gods arrive?  Bro hush cause as soon as I mention Jesus Christ who has more historical evidence than any other historical person yall count it as myth.  LOL
This video made my day.Thank you for making me laugh so hard!!!
Thomas sitting between Luke an Tom shirtless is the best thing I’ve seen
I follow the Stoltmans a lot, and this was one of the very best videos featuring them. So funny and entertaining. Great job 👏
Do you read every comment ?

The only thing that might hurt them is a heart attack.
I wanna give those giants a massage 💆‍♂️ 😏
Stoltman literally means "Proud man"  in Swedish. Pretty fitting these humble strong men. Very wholesome video, thank you!
So inspiring - LOVE IT
eric could lift it cuz hes russian, i think we all know that
Our daughter is 9 years old and is autistic. Thank you guys for this story. They need to know they can do or be anything, as do we all. ❤ y'all!!

Finally strongman getting the recognition they deserve.Thank you Luke and Tom✊
eric is the strongest in yes theory cuz hes russian :DDDD
Legends luke and tom
The internet just broke my happy levels. I never thought I'd see this happen

Oh myyy fffggg it was a ford truck I thought it was Ford Focus goddamnnn. Also ‘that’s cute innit’
they just seem to be such nice humans ahhhhh
Thank for sharing your experience. You both are the coolest giants on the planet.
Buddy I invite u to come and participate in campaign of bar election of allahabad high court.
This is so interesting. The part that made my rib ache is at 4:06 when Tobac dived and sound track goes like "tubwi" the editer really did Tobac bad😂😂😂
Giants are like little kids.. they were so happy 😂🥰
This is beautiful man they make me feel safe 🥲
Make a video on, " Surviving in India for 24 hrs without money"
These guys sound like criminals giving interview and don't want to reveal their identity
This was inspiring❤️❤️
At 19:32 son had his beef on his head I’m dead 😭
im so pumped to eat 10k calories worth of food, then sleep. love the content!
It's hard to not like the Stoltman brothers.
The montage videos of you guys enjoying was so fun!! Hope to see the Stoltman brothers in future yes theory videos too! Thay are absolute gentlemen!
The Stoltman brothers are just awesome and a real credit to Scotland and the UK  keep it up guys 👍👍❤
Again we learned: resistance training can change your life so much for the better.
And thats why skinny guys are millionaires.
stoltman brothers are sooo cool, loved the funny bits xD.
I re-watched the moment 5:48 so many times 😂
They look completely different from when they were kids
hell yes, the Stoltman brothers. Those guys are awesome
and that's why the folklore version of Thor's body looks like these strongest man, pure bulk muscle.
What a fantastic fun video.
I enjoyed this video so much!
Fuckin hot hairy muscle men. 😛
packed upload schedule for november? hell yea! #YEStoNOvember :P
I wanna see how many beers these guys can destroy in an evening
i was so happy throughout the video such grateful guys and i am thankful there are these kind of mood lighting videos around social media
I've watched their channel a few times, I didn't realise Tom had autism. I just thought Luke was more of the talker and ideas man and Tom wasn't a morning person. Good to see them stick together and work towards their goals.
They have golden hearts they are amazing ;))))
Mark Henry not included in the example:  Am I a joke to you
Truly gentle giants!
The Strongest remains who were in numbers after any battle, the weakest are left as stories and legends in bravery.
this video is so good, thank u
Having a huge body is amazing but having a big heart is inspiring  And these guys did the almost impossible task and have both
Holy shit, are these two the fucking NICEST guys ever?
Your videos are always good, and these guys are brilliant but WimHof is another level of unique (crazy)
World’s Deepest Voice
the vibe the emotions that feeling when eric conquered that ball is off the charts.............love you guys........from INDIA
I loved this episode, the two most Gentle Giants. I am soo impressed with their work ethic & playfulness
0:28 Petar Meseldžija fantasy art! ❤
False. Strong man competitions are done in Tamil Nadu, South India for thousands of years.  It's lifting a giant round rock and Bull taming. ILAVATTAKAL , JALLIKATTU Vikings are not the one who concerned about strength. We too Tamils. One who win sport can only Marry a girl.
one of the best videos y'all done
14:00 minutes, my heart was betting so fast is he can😮
Thor and Eddie Hall.. BUT HOW DARE YOU NOT SPEAK ABOUT BRIAN SHAW. 🤣🤣
this reminded me of me and my brothers i was the tall skinny one my older brothers was the giant strong ones
He freaking sound like Thor ! Omg 😱
I felt a hernia even thinking of lifting those things
Same man I have had chronic muscle injuries since 14. First both my shoulders which remains till now 3 yrs later and then my back then my bicep now my right wrist. So shit coz used to be so strong for my age. What have you done to get better?
Damn, absolutely love the Stoltman brothers, they were so damn cheerful.
Take the skinny dude for leverage, he has potentials... 😁👍
ugh i wish i can be strongest man! hahaha
5:33 how many times in a day do u eat?  sex
The stoltman brothers are my idols, when tom won worlds i literally cryed for him, makes me so proud to have scottish blood.
Amazing video! 💪💪💪
Am I the only one hear their voices seems not natural 🙄
Love watching your videos.. Have you ever visited Jamaica? That's where I am from.
Epic
Greetings from Scotland, long time fan of the channel.. Ur content is netflix worthy.
Nobody says something about their voice? They are so lowwww😂😂
What a top bunch = absolute legends - great stuff guys !
Being the strongest is a long shot from being the healthiest and even further from longevity.
The mic doesn't capture giant's voice ahah
The real definition of gentle giants
I love the last part 🥺 very inspiring.
This is such a fun episode hahahaha
that was a truly inspirational story by the end
They are giants but they are child from their heart......
1 bullet tho
This was such a funny, entertaining & heart-warming video! The Stoltman Brothers are really friendly giants prior to being strong, loved the video you filmed with the Stoltman Brothers!
”I’m 70 kgs” ”thats cute innit”  Now I feel better about my weight thank you giants!!
They look so strong if they nutted the floor they could save us from global warming 😂❤️
Big up the vitalite
This video is crazy.
Eric is so strong
halfthor
When you reach the top and become the best, there won't be a point in bragging anymore. Eventually, you become humble.  But if you humble yourself now, you'll become the best eventually.
That hide and seek was so funny i was laughing so hard i started to cry, thats the best humor ever 😂
Thank you guys and thanks youtube algorithm 👍 just earned my subscription and am bingeing on the rest of the vids on the chanel
The Scotland Highlands??? It's Scottish Highlands 🤪
Now I’m glad I went to gym today so I don’t feel guilty 😂. Incredible humans, both in their abilities and kindness, not to mention those Scottish belly laughs. Much respect, good work boys!💪🏽
Two inspirational giants for a skinny guy

My girlfriend : “ why are you eating all those sweets”  Me: “ uuuhh ..to get the sugars going”.    Stayspicyyyy
Don't forget the Growth Hormone and Anabolic Steroids
Such a cool piece of content! I love that you guys aren't afraid to try ideas that go outside your channel's main themes. Props!
https://youtu.be/tPVWGwO9kCk       (Hilarious Career choices English)
The most talented people are the one who is special like autistic people

Lol the hide and seek 🤣 this is awesome
this made me genuinely laugh for the first time in weeks. thank you!  the stoltman brothers are the world's best friends now.
I never comment on videos, but holy shit this was great
super inspiring and great content
IMPORTANT MESSAGE :D  the only way to Heaven 1) ADMIT THAT YOU’RE A SINNER: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23) No one is good enough to go to Heaven on his own merit. No matter how much good we do, we still come short.  2) REALIZE THE PENALTY FOR SIN: "For the wages of sin is death..." (Romans 3:23) The penalty for our sin is eternal death in a place called Hell. But there is good news, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to die on the cross for our sins, that whoever believes in Jesus should not perish but have everlasting life. ( see John 3:16) 3) BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD: 4) CALL UPON THE NAME OF JESUS: Trust in Jesus alone as your Savior. Jesus loves you and He's waiting for you with his arms wide open. Accept Jesus and repent (which means to confess and forsake your sins)
You guys we're welcomed in the most beloved family in the world of strongman. Take a moment to realize it and remember it for the rest of your lifes
The 3:05 bit gave me chills. Your work is so well done.
Thank you for another beautiful video
Gachi
I remember Eddie Hall training with them, absolutely wholesome people whose hearts are as big as them 😂
Amazing video guys One of the best! Much love 👊
Proper blokes these two, genuine people.
Eric's Russian genes coming in clutch
I laugh way much than other video I saw in YouTube
Ahaha that breakfast scene got me giggling so hard 😂
After hitting the gym this is the best thing I could’ve ever watched. This will keep me going proud of you guys!
This was such fun to watch guys 🌸 The Stoltman brothers are amazing and so humble! Would love to see more videos with them in the future 🌈
Nice! One of the best episodes ever! ❤️💪
Please come visit Romania some day
I really love the energy Eric brings to these videos!! I have been loving the content a lot more recently not sure why.
Yeaaaaah buddy 😂😂😂
As a single father to an amazing autistic daughter, you both are an inspiration. An inspiration not only to show my kiddo that autism doesn’t slow you down, only the lack of your own aspirations do. And to show me that I can always do more to assist my kiddo in realising her dreams. Thanks guys.
Absolutely loved this! Looking forward to what Yes Theory has planned for this month!!
This is my new favourite yes theory video
such an amazing video! what a cool guys
The hide and seek is hilarious and stupid at the same time😂😂

7:50 the treadmill is great as well! I bought it for my grandmother and she loved it
Its like playing in the backyard with your older brothers😊
Amazing!!!

It genuinely seemed like they were having a good time
فاث ذثسف
this video was soooo cool
Dbol is one helluva a drug!  Makes you strong AF. Would love to see how much gear these guys average a month.
Come to Nepal and meet kumari living goddess
<3
Those guys are cutest
The human body is a beautiful thing. Lift heavy things repeatedly and eat truckloads of food. Everything else will fall into place.
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
I'd climb them all day.
Great video was awesome to watch
As someone with Autism, Tom is incredible to look up to and I’m so glad this video was made.
This is brilliant. Of course I’ve just had a couple of sparking wines on a Friday night here in New Zealand, so seeing a group of men lined up for a big breakfast with no tops on is even more hilarious! What a wonderful invitation. Thank you to the Brothers Stoltman. What lovely guys and loving brothers. So glad you guys took it up …and sought out your own discomfort!! 🐑🐑🇳🇿🇳🇿👏🏼👏🏼 Wow, Eric?!?!
The arm wrestling was funny as !
Get this #1 trending
I've been watching yes theory for a few years now and have come across Eric's channel before too. Im so happy with how far you guys have come with being your real quirky selves :) You guys fit so well together and I cant wait to see more content !!!

They are the true definition of gentle giants.
Tom is so funny!
Thank you for sharing the story of these two amazing brothers, they truly are real life superheroes for me. Also, you are more than welcome to visit Estonia and the Baltics biggest science centre. We might have something special for you if you ever decide to visit us!

11:13 lmao erics lookin confident
This biggest dudes always end up being the most chill & humble homies
this video gave me the biggest smile
Guys, Giants are real!!!!! 🤓 They are everything I want them to be as well!!! Strong, good-looking, the perfect accent, great sense of humor, have a cottage in the shire, barely fit in a car, bench press average guys, work out at shipyards, competitive, genuine, huge hearts, and have a dedicated episode on the Yes Theory YouTube channel!
Never felt so big in my entire life
GIANT HIDE N SEEK!! LAMO! OH WHERE CAN THEY BE?
I didn’t want this to end!
Tom, thank you. I have a 14 year old autistic daughter, I will be showing her this when she gets home. I would love to see her as confident as you
Goshhh!!! this video is soo wholesomee. loved it, wanna see more from these guys, not the joking kind where they are used for pranks but with respect, more heartwarming stuff like surprising a fan or relating with overcoming society views on autism.
The man said "that's cute ain't it" 🤣
Their voices are so low it's nuts hahaha.
The hide and seek makes me laugh so hard!! 🤣
Love you boys❤️
What an wholesome video
Jesus christ those dudes are MONSTERS! I cant even imagine being so huge, they probably eat as much as I do in a week, in a day.
Even the voice alone will let you know they're Giants💯🔥
I was wondering, did you guys find Nessie on your trip up there??
Don’t diss Yes Theory. The giants will come for ya!
deep voice
Their voices really are crazy cool
One of my favorite videos from you guys! The vibe of this video was incredible, I truly felt like I was watching life-long friends having a good time
Oh my god, your poor stomach, liver and kidneys! … and toilet … I need a cleanse just looking at that breakfast.
Thomas is like little version of Tom. :D
The second half of the video is so funny
Checked the dictionary for Gentle Giant, these two popped up!
This is the gayest video I have ever seen 🤭😂
He’s sounds like Thor
This is amazing 🥺
GREAT VIDEO!!!!!….. laughed so much 😂😂😂  Eric needs to compete in some strongman type competition…..😁 Just like Matt did the iron man. That would be epic!!!!..
Damn what if they fight somebody 😂
THE BFG IS REAL! OMG!!! WOW! hahahahahaha kidding
Tom and Luke are great guys, awesome video.
Yes! It is great to see they have such a big presence in the sport Also, looks like bringing your weakest member backfired lol
I kinda wonder if these strongest men live long at all, I mean I’ve seen so many skinny looking old men BUT never really old massive men, just saying.
Nobody talking about how insanely deep his voice is?
As an asian. If i stand near them. I will look like a hobbit.
great video.  i gotta say tho: it's the Scottish Highlands or the Highlands of Scotland, not the Scotland Highlands.
Those guys look like super fun guys to hangout with. They could literally break me in half.
👾🙌🌬
I think the smelling salt was coke 😂
These guys are strong and humble that's great thing to have . Respect for them 👏
Every fucking video I'm about to cry at the end, how do you guys do it?
The Stoltman brothers are so great.
Osrs I'm small but I know I can pick up almost 80% of that stuff there. If y'all go next time Invite me lmfao. I'll be down to place a 2000$ bet that I could go against Eric lol
Awe I love them! 🥺

Bro the guy grunts like a bloody tiger holy moly
Strongest guys in the world,yet very HUMBLE people...
That was wholesome hahahah
Man, that made me smile pretty hard
The boys don’t live in Inverness. They stay in the same town as me, it’s called INVERGORDON! Inverness is 25 miles from us and, for some reason, people seem to make this mistake a lot, even in competition announcements.
Very inspiring as always ❤
Such a big  laugh!!! Need to hit the gym tomorrow man!!!
Bring them to LA and have a food adventure!
Eric seems like a cool guys!! Would love to meet you guys some day
Funny you think I can afford a nordic track Thomas😂

They are not the 2 strongest lmfao not even in wsm
😲🔥🔥🔥💚🙏
Listened to the Rogan episode with the first openly gay strong man the other day, watched some strong man highlights this morning, and now this drops! The universe is sending me a message lol
Strongest man in the world just told Eric “how are you so strong?!” Thats an accomplishment in itself!
This video is pure adrenaline!!!😂😂
I loved this video so much. So much good stuff packed into one video. It’s both inspiring and a good laugh. Keep it up guys!❤️
Holy balls Eric!!! Soon as you lifted 200 kilos my jaw dropped!!! Good shit!!!!
This is easily one of my favorite videos you guys have done. My face hurts from smiling and laughing so much.
Support #teamseas
ERICC
eric is partly russian.. so yeah.. hahaha
Bro I wanna hear these two men sing. Their voices are unbelievable low
You guys should come with me back to some Native American Reservations. I’ll show you a different side of America no one sees. It would be an amazing experience for you guys
the truth is, you can't be a strongman without the gene :"
You should go to colorado and spend a day with Brian shaw
Best video yet. Keep it up, boys.
Their voice is so deep that yes theory boys sounds like they're on Helium
"SQUEEZE ET" I felt stronger after he said that lol
Literal Vikings
The bulk is crazy 💪
this the funniest video ever
You should look up r/travelpartners and go on a trip with them. I think it would make a great video
They are gentle giants ❤️😂
Just opposite about of what I thought about them.So humble
Beautiful, just beautiful.
These dudes are awesome!
Their voice just like straight out of a video game!
this was such a great video, definitely visit these amazing guys again!!
17:10 i bet they snap these logs everyday before breakfast
I liked how everyone calls them "Mythology" but our guy walking on water seems to me pretty normal, c'mon man those stories are beautiful and insaneeee and thanks to making such interesting videos it's like you're living the dream for us.
I love you guys so much. Thank you for consistently putting out funny, interesting and uplifting content I can end my day with. The world needs more heroes like you. Love and light ✨
This is so cute bro!
I really like the way yes theory brings a literature review on every video.
I want to see one stoltman vs the 3 guys
The scottish in me is proud
Best video ever guys!!!!!!
Their voice is in better shape than me lmao
The “that’s cute innit” 😂

"you're out of your mind" hahaha
The Stoltman bros seem super chill and easy to be around.
Best month in years !!!! Yessssssssss 🤗🤗
Hey Yes Theory! I'm an MIT computer science student who's done work in chemistry/biology too, and wanted to comment on Thomas's chronic muscle pain -- I've had similar problems with tendonitis, carpal tunnel, and ulnar nerve issues. After years of PT, talking to the best doctors, and a ton of my own research + studying, I came across the director of NYU's top rehab program for 25 years (Dr. Sarno) that resolved my problems for me by explaining psychological causes (sounds strange, but has a surprising amount of merit). Now, me and similar friends are nearly completely fine. I'm not affiliated in any way, and it's totally possible Thomas doesn't fall under this, but I would be happy to speak more about it/hear more details if Thomas is interested!
i imagine this at the games tug of war in squid games. them MF's is going literally single handedly win the game
I NEEEEED that fluffy green seek discomfort hoodie. take my money Thomas!!!
Giant hide and seek…ROFL…
Luke's voice is so DEEP… good grief! I love listening to him speak… these two guys I would love to sit and have a pint or two with…
love this so much!!! lot of fun
These dudes nearly lifted 1,000 freaking pounds!!
Frame 6:55 and hang it on your wall. It's better than The Last Supper.
I like the overall presentation of this video, u guys are improving, i want u to improve more :)
Best video yet!!!
I'm 70 kgs THAT'S CUTE INNIT
They look really genuine
I saw the add to buy the Nordic track treadmill and saw it was 3K 😳💀🥲
Yea this video was awesome 😂😂👌🏼
Yea this video was awesome 😂😂👌🏼
Sucks that tall, big people don't live that long. Oh well. They still look awesome :)
Lol Freakign Erick is a beast.
big friendly giants
Eric did me proud.
That made me smile from ear to ear :)
4:03 look at the silhouette. The mass of the strong men is incredible.
I'd take Tom home with me 😛
Anyone else need to have a kg to lb converter up this entire video or just me? 😂
Awesome video like always!
This has been by far my favorite video 😂❤️ I laughed so hard!
LOL the sound effects at 4:11
Netflix really needs a Drive to Survive equivalent for Strongman to get more people into the sport
Eric, are you sure you’re Russian? 😂
I loved this
Now where are the dragons?
The strongest men. You both have such sweet energy!!!
Hey Yes Theory, I am a loser who lost everything I cared about. Suicidal, depressed and going no where in life. I am a complete failure and hate this life. Watching your videos makes me feel like I had so much to offer and I failed in every way possible. Im broken and unwanted. Come hang out with me, Im not special. Never have been and never will be!
5:54 (BEST GROUP PIC EVER) 😂😂
Now think back 500y when 5ft was tall.
They really saved money on the wardrobe this episode.
One of the most enjoyable videos I ever saw. Was hilarious for real!! Very good people, very good content, very real smiles. From Uruguay, thanks!!! 🙏🏻
Man, this is so amazing 👏.  Love the brothers
Awesome Video! Scottish 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Proud!
yooo the little man eric is for REAL strong! good core buddy! did some strongman back in College. Bunch of great guys! LOVE THIS VIDEO!
Beast innit
dope video
Nice chaps!
Love this video so much. But i say that to all videos
How these guys afford all this?
I get annoyed when I see Erick ever since his clout chasing videos on buzzfeed…
This video is by far the funniest and also the most inspiring to me. I just started working out and this video tells me that I need to trust the process and the progress will follow.
its that russian blood in eric lol
I love it thanks i want to eat like them and train hardet
lmao love it :)
THE best videos
I enjoyed every moment of this video.
Mmmm roid stomachs
What a joy to watch this, hilarious but with so much heart! I loved every minute.
12:15 = what I feel like when I’m bringing in the groceries
Gentle Giants
i wanna hear them sing the wellerman Sea Shanty song.. voice is deep
I love the Stoltman's!!! They are genuine people, and fantastic athletes. I was a care taker for autistic children, and I can tell everyone his story amazes me. He should be an inspiration to people around the world. Love yinz guys! ❤
Hell yeah this was epic!💪🏼I needed a Yes video today! This was incredibly inspiring. Thanks guys ❤️
looking like a titan and also sounding like one, genetic god mode.
man, id love to spend a day with Luke and Tom, im so jealous! :(
Excellent video guys!  One of your best!
I somehow have the sudden urge to bench press.
They're all like instant best friends lol
EPIC ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
These guys are just big strong teddy bears, I love them
When gentlemen weild the power, weakling feel save
I literally didn’t stop smiling this entire video. One of my favorites ever
The boys have mastered film making 👌🏾
I hope they find good women, and have 10 children each!!!
"I'm 76kg"   "That's cute ain't it?"
1 stoltman should be considered a measurement of some kind in the strongman circuit. Great stuff guys   Side note, build boats and lift heavy things, dam manly I think as well
Love how they are friendly, gentle giants.
I love how it went from "we're going to live their life for a day to understand what they go through" to "we're gonna fuck around with our new buddies for a little bit."
If you have the time could you make a video on Close Encounters of the Third Kind it is a documentary about alien encounters using meditation.
Best country in the world! Mon the Scotland lol
The wholesome bro energy is off the charts it's great
I've been a silent subscriber for some time now, but I just have to say this is definitely one of your best videos yet. Really enjoyed seeing you guys hanging out with those two literally gentle giants👏
You guys were walking testosterones!!!
I just loved this video...so fun.
Christianity is the truth, God sent Jesus his only begotten son he was crucified (which means hung on a cross) for 6 hours all of our sin were taken upon him and through Jesus’ suffering we have eternal life in heaven if we accept  him as lord and savior, ask forgiveness from your sins to God through Jesus , and stop all sins, a repentance prayer can be, Dear God I believe that your only begotten son Jesus Christ suffered and died for our sins, through Jesus may you forgive and have mercy on me a sinner. God changed my heart I no longer love sin but feel guilty when I sin, I now love righteousness. You must repent and live an obedient life for Jesus and then you will go to heaven, Jesus died for our sins so that we can have life everlasting in heaven that’s because Jesus loves us so much.you can build up your faith by  reading the Bible and praying and you need strong faith to survive spiritually God is real because he changed my heart I no longer love sin but love righteousness and I feel guilty when I sin, and God helps me out of struggles
Tom’s smile is so contagious
Literally had such a big smile watching this thank you for sharing their story and for making my day much love to the brothers and to the Yes Theory team.
You guys never cease to amaze and inspire.
The first clip where it said “Glasgow” is oban? Lol
Mon eh hoops 🍀🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
So basically just the boys hanging and messing around 🤣🤣
The strongest man being Autistic is the metaphoric inspiration I've needed recently, thank you!
REPENT! Time is running out! The penalty for sin is death. Jesus willingly took your sins and penalty onto Himself. He took your sins, as innocent as He was, and died for you anyway. Jesus LOVES you! ❤‍🔥
These guys are not only the strongest men in the world, but seem like the nicest too.
Someone can tell me the name of the song that stars at 19:55 ??? Pleaseee
Their voices is so deep it sounds like they’re in slow motion
Brian shaw man
Finally a man my hugs can't break. I wouldn't mind being the heavy thing these guys like to lift, but I'm only a 95 kg kettlebell, now I feel little. I love men I can't break with my weight. Thick and cute.
cool video
😅 nice drone shot of Oban not Glasgow 🤣
The Strongest Men in the world is MARIUSZ PUDZIANOWSKI!! NUMBER ONE!!!
18:26 did you hear his arm pop, dear Lord
Rip girlfriends.
Yes Theory does a video on my favorite brothers ever? CLICKING ON THAT!
love the chill vibe of this video
2:11 that is oban, not glasgow
#6 on trending gooo babbbyyy

Absolutely the best.
*Haha I literally said to myself as soon as I saw the screenshot, if it was the Scottish highlands 😂*
my birthday is on the 14th come to boston and meet some cool people
How is Eric that strong!? ha the Stoltman Bros seem like they'd be great friends.
Their voices are the stereotypical giant voice. Really fits them.
18:16 that guy is surprisingly fast. If he was fast and strong that would be crazy
I don't know what the future holds for the Stoltmans. However, they might be the greatest representatives the sport could have ever hoped for.
one wrong move with one of those stones and youll be missing 5 toes. Ever heard of steel toe??
Such nice guys! I think my favourite part out of all this is that Eric is the strongest of the Yes Theory team  after they said he was the weakest 😂
Amazing Video!!!!! However, at the beginning you showed Oban, Scotland and said it was Glasgow :(
I really enjoyed the energy and vibe of this piece.... great story with great people....
Sooooo wholesome!!!! They are all just so stinkin precious protect all of them at all costs 🥺🥺
the tall brother looks like jake paul but the stronge one
Okay, be real, did you guys pitch their voices down as well? omg
Tu get the shoegurs goin' 💪🍬
Stoltman brothers are so humble, how can you not love them!
The giants of ancient myth were not necessarily massive people, though some were, but instead were vicious, tyrannical, monstrous men who dominated their surroundings. The ancient Jewish stories about the giants in Scripture actually say they engaged in sexual idolatry, being possessed by spirits to continued their special bloodline as half deities.  These lovely giants are the opposite as they are compassionate and virtuous men
Did not expect to watch this whole vid, super entertaining the whole time I loved this!
Yay
How do these guys make money? How is it all paid for??
Their attitude and personalities are awesome, the fact they are happy for you when you lift the concrete ball despite being so much stronger than you is so humbling and mature.  Wish them every success for sure! Viva La Scotland, from a neighbor in England ;) Great content as always guys!
Woah low voices
Ooch! This is great! So many highlights . . .   Brotherly love! (Yea!) Redemption from then victory over adversity. The fruits of discipline. Epic fun, laughter, and pay! (No' to mention: That moment when you lost the argument over whether or not wearing a budgie smuggler is manly. 😂)
I love how positive, encouraging, and genuine the Stoltman brothers are! Sharing these positive vibes is what makes people believe in themselves!
hahaha loved this episode! And the stoltman brothers are gentle giants and I love it!
ask them to say ' I'll be back !
Damn they strong asf
Lol I have autism *begins training*  no for real I begin in 2 weeks once my friend comes back from maternity leave he had a baby girl if you were wondering
Everyone needs to understand that this is how 99% of strong men are. They are all lovable giants.
Commenting for the 2nd time. BUT DUDE ERICK IS STRONG AF! lol
Can we talk about how precious it is when both of them smiled at one another 5:50. That made my entire day
🌶🌶🌶🌶
Looks like these two men have the giant-gene from old times.
Mi likey di thicc white cocky cocky
The start of minute 10:45 is my favorite part out of all of this. No cap! lmfao
Love these gigant guys))
This is one of my favourite videos by @YES Theory ..... we ALL definitely need to SEEK DISCOMFORT..... We live our lives in our safe places never to venture beyond that due to the 'fear of the unknown'.   Now I ask myself as a British Citizen in Taiwan .... what can I do to 'seek discomfort' ? any suggestions?  I herby send an open invitation to the guys at YES THEORY to visit Taiwan and experience what the beautiful country has to offer,  Love you guys .. keep up the  fantastic work .... especially giving inspiration to MILLIONS of us worldwide.  To the @Stoltman Brothers ....... You  both are amazing and hope and pray you continue to REIGN right there at the top like GODS.  ps. What's with the 119 haters?
you should try and get them to lift something like cloud's buster sword because i saw allen poe get a strong guy to do it and it was still difficult.
@0:12  woof!
Well hot damn, I never thought I'd see a Stoltman Brothers/Yes Theory crossover... This is... Bizarre, and incredible, ahahahah.  6:02 Well, at least they used the vegan spread I guess...
this is you funniest video yet! love it. gentle sweet giants. manly not just bruteness
YES... lets promote these insane athletes and brothers. Love to all you guys <3
Ohhh gosh I smiled so much in this video 😆
They are the epitome of Scottish people! I'm so glad I moved to Scotland because most people are this down to earth and just kind!
Coming from an older brother who's only sibling is a younger brother with autism... thank you for this video. I needed this... I can't stop crying. I need to be stronger for my brother.
strong men... but stronger brothers...
Click bait ...they are standing closer to the cam
I've been waiting for this since giants live in Glasgow! (I was talking to you guys at breakfast)
Even there vocal cords are muscular. real respect.
The two wholesome brothers with some of my favourite creators. Best video ever. Tom and Luke are absolute legends.
Yayayaya Tommy
their so nice and sweet this was amazing thank you for sharing .
Thanks, Yes Theory for making this. Really lifted my mood.
Top vid
Sounds like Sean Connery looks like the Big Show
ok according to my country's teenagers (SIngapore) these people doesn't have any six pack, considered  weak . Don't even argue with me thats straight fact!!
yes theory never misses
Ah you guys. Love you. Keep creating❤❤❤
This is like watching the Hobbits all over again
Strength aside, these guys are some of the most genuine people I've seen! Thanks Yes Theory for a great episode.
10,000 calories a day?!? I can do over 12,000 and I'm as skinny as Thomas. I'm impressed at how surprised the guys are by the number, but I'm not impressed at all by the number.
Love this 😀
The breakfast part gave me "The Hobbit" flashbacks. Anyone else?
Wow, this is mind blowing.
Biggest lamp ever !!
Positive masculinity
I will always love this channel you guys are so amazing at putting videos together man, I wish I could live free like this I dream of it everyday just travel the world freely.
Find the hidden giant was epic! Thanks for that.
i'm not even a mom, but like every 5 seconds i was screaming at the screen DON'T TRY THAT IT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS

I was concerned for your safety in that game of twister if one of them fell you could’ve been crushed lol
5:43 has to be the cutest, friendliest giant ive ever seen. That might aswell have been taken right out of a movie lmao, adorable
Come to Ireland
Can we have a update with Matt
Im convinced Eric's Russian blood came through for this
Never heard of these guys before, but after this will definitely be following here and there. Such genuine guys!
Fantastic, that’s all I have to say
i love how yall edit the videos lol. sometimes I find myself laughing out loud then crying by the end of the video hahah
My ancestry is 100 % certified Scottish, right down to the fiddling, Gaelic, Celtic music, and a long line of too much drink, lol. Guess we never had the genes of gigantic and massive muscular size and strength though. Unbelievable!
My university mascot is the Radford Highlander and this past Sep. we have Highlander Games every year!
this video is so cute. smiling til the end
I love being Scottish :)
Hahaha fucking brilliant lads. Welcome to Scotland any time  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Fantastic.  Great people.
bruh that lil "thoink" 💧 when he dove in 🤣🤣 4:09
These guys must have a really powerful toilet.
one of my fav videos yet!!
First time watching your content😁, new subscriber!
How are these guys this nice?
What an awesome crossover!!!
The fact that these men don't wear wieght belts, at least not visible, is scary and respectful.  They kinow safety, they know how to lift and not hurt themselves.  That is practice and dedication.
I live not far from these guys yous should do something else in Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 cracking video!
Song name 03:05 anyone?❤️
Really enjoyed this video! 😂
Best video in a while I reckon, not because your other videos aren’t incredible, I just really like these guys!
The god of war fandom disagrees, I mean to them thor isn't fat lol
Absolutely brilliant upload, funny , feel good, inspiring 💪🏾 You guys are amazing xxx
This was so good haha
Spicy!
I absolutely love these brothers....but HOW ON EARTH is that kid doing the sh*t they're doing?!?!?  🤯😂
that breakfast setup is hilarious
Definitely heard something pop in Thomas' arm when he was arm wresting Luke 😅
@4:20 My older brother had a cellmate in jail whose nickname was ColdWaves, he got the nickname because he would surf in Alaska, so its funny that he said "its nice to wake up in the morning and get pounded by cold waves" lololol
I just watched this twice in one day. I am dying 😂♥️♥️♥️
The co op is goated btw
Beautiful place
I love these guys. Such a random video though
imagine having a beer gut but that gut is also a brick wall
This makes me happy I am from England
is it weird that the shorter one reminds me of a tubby jake paul but is hotter?
Great video! They are cool people!
I sorta feel good knowing that the worlds strongest man..... drives a ford ranger
As someone who is also 6'8" and autistic, I appreciate the absolute hell out of all y'all. This gives me some encouragement that, even if I'm not buff, I can actually do something worthwhile in life. Much love and cheers from Canada.
Awesome videos sorry I’m soo late
I’m so glad you guys came and visited us here in Scotland that’s awesome smiling the whole way through this
$75 off $3,999.00 lol
love you guys! ready for all the uploads!!!!
Makes me feel so proud to be Scottish!
any more scotland videos?
Awesome video 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻😻
Love these guys, this was freakin’ hilarious!!
https://youtube.com/shorts/TAXjJrwEnaQ?feature=share
not everything is about history 💀
Of course they sound like Kratos
Damn man you like a stick next to tom man
As somebody with a 4-years-old niece who has level 2 autism, and can't fully form sentences, I wanted to say thank you for showing others that no matter what people with disabilities can beat the odds! She might not become the next strongest person in the world but, one day, I can show her or her siblings this video and let them know anything is possible! I can't wait too see what you guys have in store for November!
for such big men there hearts of gold are even bigger <3
My guy sounds like these interviews where they don't show there faces
<<< Scary Family Hauntings
I was at that event in glazgow it was amazing
The bond we go through with other friends or strangers always like no other and we learn many things as MEN
how do you super-like a video
Love me some Stoltmans brothers!!!! Greatest strong men out there!!!
i love thisssssssssssss
Been wanting/invtint you to Scotland for ages! So gutted to have missed you!
This was amazing!  I enjoyed thank you so much
Damnnnnnnn
these dudes are amazing !!  wish them much more success!!
4:27 its wholesome and cute but idk why this made me laugh😂😭
Awesome video! So I'll forgive your pronouncation of Glasgow 🤣
petition for one of these guys to play stoick in a how to train your dragon live action movie
U guys are  so awesome very polite and down to earth where ever you go, life is beautiful thanks for showing us

i enjoyed this video so much they are such down to earth people
I Love these guys!
This was beautiful guys !
i was really impressed guys!
class set of brothers 🤟🏻 support the best team in the world too 😎 💙🤟🏻
I feel like Thomas is carrying a semi dead channel now...
Great genes I'm Scottish and Irish and I'm from a very strong fam!
That voice tho, it sounds like a villain. 😂😂
God to see our fellow Scotsmen getting recognition! 💪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!!
These two aren't just heroes to kids their heroes to men across the world. The best part about alot of strongman is their just normal people with great abilities. Some aren't friendly but I see more and more today how nice alot of them are. Their like big kids when they all get together. These competitions have grown so much in my life time and it's great to see. These two are definitely my favorite to watch together. Congratulations to them both and thanks for sharing this video
they should have been in squid game no capppp
No one mentioned Brian Shaw!? Wow
Can't get enough of the one sitting between the two Giants 😅😅😅
*ACTUAL GIANTS OF ANTIQUITY* Though most people regard giants to be fiction...created for children's storybooks and such...in truth, they have been well documented throughout ancient history from all parts of the world. Scholars have conjectured that the Greco-Roman and Norse Gods were not made up fiction, but rather they were from the lineage of these actual, flesh and blood giants. Serious students of the Bible are well aware that these giants, or Nephilim, and the account of their development is recorded in the Bible, as well as parabiblical texts which were studied by Jewish scholars dating back thousands of years ago...such as *the books of Enoch,* which are quoted in the New Testament books of Jude and 2nd Peter. If you are curious about the Nephilim then I recommend looking up one of the leading scholars on the topic, *Dr. Michael Heiser.*   Here is a link to an interview with him in which he discusses them... https://youtu.be/-VS_9NxBD5c
Best video in a while!!!!! Sooooo good :-D
my favorite video you guys have ever made!!!
wtf is eggsercise ?
might start seeking discomfort:)
They are the ultimate hypemen
5:59 im really sorry but i am so tired. Like i completely forgot i had this video on and came back to seeing a bunch of topless men, 2 HUGE guys and 3 normal sized guys. This looks questionable
So epic to see this video!! Really enjoy watching these videos you guys do! So glad to see them invite you guys to come spend the day with them 😭😭
4:33  naaaa fuck you, fuck you for comming
How is that possible, even the weakest man in words can lift 200 kilos, now Im gonna say Eric is now a member of Stoltman..
Respect
Luke and Tom with yes theory, the collab we never even knew we needed. ❤️
Eric being stronger than what everybody thought makes me so happy
Amazing video 💪🏽
damn i wanna see those guys, they are the strongest yet sweetest person
i already got a back problem and i can feel it aching just by watching them lift heavy
THOSE BIG MEN ARE THE CUTEST OMG SUCH GLOWING ENERGY
Brilliant!
Hope u guys enjoyed my homeland!  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿😊 Never even realised the world's strongest man was from here!! 😳 Eric killed it!   💪💪 Well done!
The biggest guys have the biggest hearts!
HA great video guys
how come you came to the town i live in, and i didnt see you? kinda upset wouldve loved seeing you
This was the best video I've watched in a long time. Smashed it. Well done everyone involved. Big smile the entire time.
That is pure love<3
They look like they're having so much fun😂
The stoltman’s are the best! Love this for you and them!
Chris Redfield would love this video
chlls down my spine mannn from the intro
Yes theory Never fail to make me happy ❤️😊
love this video! was so funny and had a "strong" point LOL get it?
Great video
Awesome video guys the brother's are some great guys.
Massive meat sandwich with those hulks
What a great upload! The Stoltman brothers are absolute legends! Thanks for another feel good video 😁
Love the video. But that scene with Thomas in between everyone just got me.
Epic! Nobody is talking about the risk of serious permanent health damage that Eric exposed himself to though. The Stolman Brothers have reinforced every single joint through training but untrained subjects may incur in a serious injury anywhere from muscle trauma to paralysis
Strongmen should be a bigger sport. Thanks for doing this
This is up there with one of my favourite videos ever
Yes I am from Scotland
so inspiring
can’t believe people made Thor because of these guys
Ya'll provide some feel good content. What a life 🙌
Breaking Bread 🍞 with the Giants Brothers 👍
Best video ever. Loved it
They seem so nice
I absolutely love how much support you guys were getting from each other and the strong men! Awesome to see
I loved the video.  You guys are awesome.
I think the yes men are gay like actually they have a lot of gay things theve done
bro imagine they went on a cut
I feel sorry for their "significant others"!
13:42 so cute how he rushed there to check whether he was ok, not only the strongest men on earth, but also some of the nicest <3
As a Dad who has 2 children with Autism. This is amazing. Will watch this again with my kids when they get home from school 🥰
That nordictrack thing actually looks sick
Loved them! They are lovely and inspired me
That was very inspiring. Thanks to all of you!
This was epic!
Great video, felt like I was smiling most of it :)
17:33 such an Epic Voice 😅
I’ve never heard anyone in my entire life call it ‘The Scotland Highlands’- it’s either ‘The Scottish Highlands’ or ‘The Highlands of Scotland’ :P just sayin’
Next yes theory!  Be a marine for a day (Join Marine Basic Training, Day 1)
This video is beautiful 😅 i Love it. Inspiring for real 😂
Big like for the brothers
03:37 so.....the Wim Hof experience has to happen now, right?
Great video....
some of the coolest dudes ever 10/10
Great video!
This was such an unexpected, yet incredible video. great work once again!
their adorable
LOVED THIS SO MUCH OMG!!!! As always !!! 💓💓 THANK U FOR THIS! So proud of all of you
The celebration when he got the stone up gave me life. That was wonderful.   Edit: and the last few minutes remind me that they're just dudes. They're not a different species, they're goofy and playful like everyone else, just gigantic. They seem like the best people.
They are really what they call GENTLE GIANTS. Really love their heart winning humbleness and overall vibe these guys have. Nothing but respect.
Autism gang! Actually gonna go for it. U gonna see me in a while
Absolute beasts
I genuinely just love Luke and Tom. They are fantastic guys and deserve all of the success they've achieved
Eric wtf, at some point in this video Eric wasn't part of Yes Theory anymore, he became one of the giant guys, hahaha.
3:30 imagine starting your day with one of the world strongest men jumping on you at 5:30am
ERIC IS SO STRONG WTFFFF??!
I think Eric's Russian blood is what got him through the workout I'm so proud of him hahaha
holy shit those low voices
Amazing story 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Epic! :)
I think you should visit the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland and Svalbard as each of them are quite unique small countries/autonomous territories(one of which I'm an inhabitant of) that have some special historical heritage in different ways.
Day 17. Waiting for YES THEORY to fulfill my wish. From the Philippines.🇵🇭
Wow they are soo lovely people! The hugs are sweet
thats oban, not glasgow
How can I get the Hoody worn in the video?The really fluffy one??
it's funny watching this because as soon as i saw the food my mind instantly went "yeah look at their body mass and how much training they have to do to maintain it" and the skinny guy's eyes went wide XD (keep in mind i'm fat and lazy lmfao)
far out you guys can tell a story, thanks for sharing
epic video!
I am taking this two guys to Armageddon with me 😂 😆
19:03 you three guys would’ve probably won if the big guy didn’t cheat with his left hand
THAT WATER DROP 💧 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Enjoy your videos 🙌 BUT wish you posted more consistently and on the same days like you used to👌🏼
Anyone else see Bjorn Ironside 00:20
This is literally the real girls with autism vs boys with autism meme
<3
i love them
this was awesome , loved it! something about big dudes there usually super nice because they have nothing to prove
Come hang out with us, we live in Mexico and we provide safety courses where we use a Helicopter simulator and make exercises where people need to learn how to escape underwater, you will have fun here. God bless you Yes Theory
❤
Boys will be boys
Whoa! I LOVED this episode! What positive masculinity from everyone involved! It's AMAZING to see that for a change! Love it!
What a masterpiece
Yes Theory visited my hometown, unbelievable! Hope you enjoyed the trip! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
So glad to see fellow Scottish yes fam out and about
What an incredible video. Such beautiful souls. This is EXCACTLY why I signed up to this channel. ❤❤
The big men also have the biggest hearts, they are so welcoming!!
David : siiiiiip
coolest video i have seen in a long time, thank u.
17:18 has the most awkward hug to do to another man
Please come to Fiji 😊❤
5:54 Important detail
isn’t brian shaw world’s strongest man?
Go Scotland!!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Man I love the Stoltmans
Funny, "Stoltman" in norwegian means "Proud man"
These guys are true BFGs
Damn, wasn't expecting such a wholesome video!
This is such a good example for men on how to keep healthy levels of testosterone and how to channel that energy into something so incredible. Men need these close bonds with their boys, and avenues like this one where there is some competition and support for one another. There’s a lot more going on here in terms of what a lot of men are missing nowadays to enjoy a healthier life, and that shows in the success these two amazing brothers have achieved 🏅
This was just sooooo fun!   I laughed right out loud so many times!!!   👍🏼 Great show!!  🤗🛸🎶
did you ever notice, that actual strong people are not mean and toxic people. its always the weak people who pretend to be strong who are toxic people
These guys are the definition of gentle giants 🥰
This video is fantastic, excellent job guys, great to see the Stoltmans get the recognition they deserve!
Cant believe yes theory were swimming in Inverness
loved this
Easy the best video u guys posted so far, the brothers are such great guys.
Hey guys ! Have you met Mike Horn? I think you'd love this guy and his incredible life ! He's the definition of seeking discomfort !
Even their laughs sound strong!  Great video as always
Yeah, I definitely smiled through most of that.
YOU WERE IN INVERNESS THATS 45MIN AWAY FROM MEEEEE!!!!!!!!
The cut to breakfast was so funny
I don't why i can't stop smiling .. <3
so freaking cool
those giants totally had their way with that dude
What a collaborative love strong man , and yes theory 😅🤪
This video is SO FUCKIN HYPE
ive never smiled so wide watching a vid, excellent job fellas
Any Yes Theory and Strongman fans?
And their voices, somehow, manage to be deeper than you might think.
You gotta do more vids with the Stoltman Bros they're legendary
You guys need to go and play rugby while you’re in Great Britain - good luck!
Love this episode!! ❤️❤️❤️I support autism awareness 💙 💙 💙
great video.   0:53 as a scot I would like to say that they are usually called the Scottish Highlands or the Highlands of Scotland
Incrível!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ummm Brian Shaw…….
Irish uillean pipe music sounds good but has nothing to do with Scotland.
What camera do you guys use ??
Awesome to know Yes Theory was in my homeland, albeit I’m from the other side of the country. ❤️❤️❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Come to Cape Town South Africa and say yes to all the adventures we have installed for you!!!
You guys should travel more in the U.K., fantastic opportunities to make content. Drop me a line if you’re ever in the North East of England!
What these guys do (strongmen) is just unbelievable, the weights they move, the amount of food they eat and what they put their bodies through is truly unreal, some of the hardest athletes on the planet and the most underpaid, it's time they got the recognition they deserve....Class video, thanks Yes Theory for always delivering amazing content!
I would never have thought this dude has autism, big up for his effort to get out of his shell and accomplish so much!
7 Mill!!!
18:18 bro imagine running in the same direction as him and colliding. It's like hitting a train
3 things. 1) They’re like gentle giants 2) The younger one doesn’t look like he has autism 3) Would love to see them play in the NFL 🤣🤣💪💪
I couldn't stop laughing. Great work guys.
BUAAAHHHHH!!! Your videos guys are the best energy ever!!!! THX FOR THE AMAZING WORK & SHARING IT!!!! <3
Great men
The best one so far! And I have been watching you for three years already.💪😀
I'm not crying... actually I am
Today is my birthday and I’m glad I got to see a new video thank you yes theory for all the hardships and lesson you taught
HELLO and welcome to Scotland!!! Hope you guys enjoyed your visit as well as got to taste and experience our culture! Also, of course, I am glad you went to the capital of the Highlands!
hell yes, I KNEW  it was this bro, i just knew you guys were gonna collab with the Stoltman bro's, I've watched them before they were considered "popular" in the strongman scene, they are two lovely lads and down to earth. so excited y'all did this.
Her: he's probably cheating on me...  Meanwhile him and da boys : 5:53
They’re so supportive and quiet-mannered. 😍
Me not knowing there in Scotland🥲
They are human sunshine 😍😍😍
Ahh those interviews I love them!   I don’t the brothers got 4 new friends they got some couple million new friends who are truly inspired by them!
I am absolutely gutted you guys were in Scotland and i never met you all, but to be fair, you guys chose two of the best scottish reps there is
You guys really know how to put together an entertaining and informative video. Absofuckinglutely love it.
Amazing video guys! 😄👌🏻
now i feel sad :D i want to meet you dude one day :D you are in scotland and i missed chance? :D  let me know once you come again we have small yes fam here in Edinburgh
this is the best video on this app
loved this video, really cool guys w a great story to tell and that whole bit with the hide and seek was so fun lol. u guys always kill it when u come back after filming, dont be afraid to put more funny moments like that in future videos n i hope to see the brothers again
Damn that was inspiring..
Awesome video guys.  Very entertaining, enlightening, and you looked like you were having so much fun.  The stoltman brothers are bloody ace!!
Awesome video guys! Such a great collab! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
The Scotland Highlands 😂. Guys it’s the Scottish Highlands. Also that drone shot of ‘Glasgow’ is actually Oban, which is nearly 3 hours away and on the west coast…sorry to be a nit-picking Scotsman.
Awesome video !
This was too amazing 🤣
Thank you for this video. The way you guys connect with everyone is amazing it inspires me to be kind. Right now I have been struggling with keeping a smile face for the past few days due to some family problems that have been going on. But watching your guys video really brought joy to my morning in here in Townsville,  Australia. So thank you and keep up this amazing energy. Thank you again!!!
Now I know one: that Russian guy is the strongest out of the whole “Yes Theory” ✊
Stoltman Clan 👍👍👍
Hopefully I will meet someday and join you guys for a trip
-STRONG MAN... "HOW ARE YOU SO STRONG?..." LOLZ
HE GOT YOU!!! AWSOME!
I enjoy Erik I’m the videos lol
What beautiful souls. They truly are real superheroes. Love and respect to the highest degree.
We need to see the two friendly giants one more time
Yes theory collab with the stoltman Brothers is the best thing ever
Giant teddy bears, love the Stoltman Brothers
MONNE SCOTLAND
Eric rocks👑
What an amazing beautiful story!!! Thank you thank you thank you!!! Two true gentle Giants, telling the story of Brotherly love, a bond for a life time!!!
I always cry watching every yes theory video😂
Why the fuck is Eric so strong ?!
I love how humorous these guys are, great video. 😃
Holy cow they can eat!
Yes theory, I watch all your video's and this is by far the best and funniest. I felt as if I was there with y'all. When you come to Ghana, West Africa 🌍... Please let me join in.
Galio and malphite xd
12:11 me lifting the shopping bags be like
This is the funniest video I've seen in a while
Awesome guys!
Best video I've seen for years. 😁😁😁
I think they were high in the last living room scene hahaha
This might be my favorite Yes Theory video yet. Awesome work y'all.
you guys were in glasgow???!!! ahhhh!!!
They look like almost normal tall guys growing up, my question is, how is their voice soooo deep?
bruh his voice alone could lift a car
Yes Theory is truly my favorite group of people ever.
They made u look like an ant
up the stoltman brothers! sick vid
I genuinely laughed so hard in this video, and also such great inspirational people you guys introduced us to this time, thank you for exploring the world for us.
These guys are literally "Big Friendly Giants"
Ever since the back-flip video.. their theory has been tested
Eric has the russian power in him,if you gave him vodka he would be stronger then those stoltman guys😂
The Stoltman Brothers are like the friendliest 2 grizzly bears with the voice of God. Or Morgan Freeman.  I just love everything about this video 😄 Thank you for sharing your experiences with us. 🙏
What an incredible story, incredibly told!
Yes, an adequate amount of shirtless attractive men in this video. Well done!
Man I want another video from you and the amazing "giants".
Thank you for such a heart pleasing video....  14:15 moment felt like we lifted it .
Hi yes theory my name is Adrian Vazquez i live in New Jersey right across from NY my dad recently has been going through some mental issues caused by his job/pandemic & has confessed to our family on having suicidal thoughts anything from you guys would help out ! i have showed him & we have watched some of your videos together ! would be amazing to hear back from you guys  prayers up to anyone going through mental health issues.  You Are Loved...
They are so kind, I love it.
If i eat 10,000 calories a day, will I get a deep voice too? :>
This video filled my heart with warmth. Have you ever seen 2 groups of strangers so quickly act like best friends? The "definitely not gay" bare chest hugs, frollicking in the ocean. Wholesome af. Thanks yes theory for giving my 2 favorite strongmen a platform for their sport and themselves! Well deserved! <3 SPICYYY
Best episode yet
Amazing video, amazing guys! Great, great stuff. Keep it up y'all!!!
Wish I knew you guys were in Glasgow - would have been amazing to meet you all. Visit Scotland again soon - we're the best wee country in the world!
This is the most wholesome video on the internet
Is it just me or that @19:57 "feeling" sounded very Scottish?
❤️❤️❤️❤️
LOVED THIS one of the best videos it was awesome great guys !
5:56 god forgive me.
you cool, but Big Z is stronger :D (zydrunas savickas)
Best video I’ve seen on youtube in a while
Id would love to spend a day with the giants i watch they're YouTube seem like super great people
hahaha couldn't stop laughing when you guys played some the games in the end
5:55 looks like a scene from another website ive seen before 🤔🤔
As a Scottish person dealing with Autism I think this is one of the best Youtube videos I've ever seen, thx for shining a light on Scotland and autism, hope you come back soon 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
The moment in hide and seek where the camera shows luke hiding as a lamp sitting on chair killed me. That was just pure comedic genius
Giant teddy bears wholesome kings
they should do a video with Kyriakos Grizzly, the real greek god
Awesome stuff guys. Goes to show that with enough love and support, you can overcome anything.   At the end I thought you guys would lean back and alternate sides to win the tug of war.
I suffered two hernias from watching this video
Scottish hulk twins
Im glad use guys had a good time in our beautiful country and the boys were really great hosts 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 so much more to explore, I hope to see use back soon 👍🏻

Eric got serial killer strength, deceptive. The man would be hard to kill.

You guys MUST visit son doong cave!
They just seem so nice ! Epic video
World's friendliest giants / teddy bears
Yes theory should start going to gym !
I smiled for the whole video lol they look so strong however they also have the kindest hearts! They were so lovely to everyone 🥰
Everybody thinks that autism is a disadvantage, but its the new step of evolution. The perfect human.
This is amazing. I just found out im like 40 percent scottish.
I could not stop smiling and laughing all the way though. MY THUMBS ARE BIGGER THAN YOURS! 😂😂
🌬Idk if it was smart to do that without steel toes on just sayin i like my feet🐸
This is one of my favorite videos yes theory has done. Amazing!!
can I get an Amen in this chat!  this is proof that all people are worth living and getting a chance at life! #stop #aborting #children  NO MATTER THE CIRCUMSTANCE.  I support, absence, birth control, motherhood, or adoption!
real cool hulk
This is so cute it looks like you had so much fun together!🥺❤️❤️❤️
My son has Autism and this video gives me hope. Thank you!!!
Poor toilet hahah

Awww man; this was super great to see! I really wish you had met the Mother; she must be EXTRA SUPERHUMAN to have produced such strong men!  #momsfirst
The Strongest Men Have The Softest Hearts ❤️
Great video but fuck your sponsorship
Love it
Tom is so cutie ☺️
I've got a four year old son born premature, who we're waiting for an exam to see if he's on the spectrum. I'm gonna love him forever no matter what, but if he becomes a 400lb strong man, that would be so cool, lol.
AMAZING!
Lol they are like big teddy bears full of love lol wouldnt have excepted them to be so..nice? Lol
I thought eric was the weakest link 🤣
I haven't had so much fun watching a video for a long time. I got goose bumps of happiness. Thank you and the brothers. So wholesome.
This was so sweet!!
5:44 The look he gave.. 💀💀💀
It’s lovely to see you in my home country! Hope you had the best time 😊
Gentle giants
I’m so happy that Eric is part of Yes Theory now
Absolutely loved the video guys well done! Stoltman brothers look like super fun guys to hang around with!
They're absolutely cracking blokes. Hope this video gives them some more deserved publicity.
cant wait Eric to become strongman :D
A collaboration i never knew i needed! Laughed so much in this video and getting all excited when i seen Inverness on a YesTheory video. 😊
This video is going to be spicy 🌶️🌶️
I love the Stoltman brothers! Great video!
Now take those guy to meet Wym Hof and they will become gods
Of course you go to Scotland and Cyprus without me knowing aha
amazing video , genuine and wholesome people
Watched you guys for years! Can't believe you came to my hometown Inversneck! Hope you enjoyed yourselves here
Stoltman... stolt man means proud man in Swedish
$75 discount is pretty decent; but aren't those incline trainers like 3 grand? 0.00233% discount is pretty measly to be honest.
i just fell in love with these brothers
18:55 Literally the funniest part😂
"Do you like mushrooms"?
This is so funny 🤣❤
nothing will ever beat yestheory’s content for me (,: obsessed from the start.
Great video
Really inspiring stuff, another amazing vid
I'm guessing Brian Shaw was unavailable
these brothers are too nice.
Great video, thank you for sharing your experience!
Love it. Loved Stoltman Brothers already and Yes Theory. So no surprise there. 💪🏻🤗🥰
SPICEY
these guys 100% put the chairs up in 4th grade
I knew Eric was strong Af , when I met him hahahah , great video
they seem like such great people, love their energy:D
Still in tears from that tug of war bit 😂
please come to Northern Ireland and talk about our troubled past
best  episode !!
Get you some friends to gass you up like this
Thomas, your storytelling is so compelling!  Kudos!
I was smiling the whole video
The gentle Giants...
The part where you all sit at the table looks so funny 😄
Noble giants at its finest
i dont know why but i want to be sandwich between them
See not to be mean but why are u ppl not with #teamSEAS
If you own a warehouse to workout, you probably now how it’s done.
Dang this is life
this made my day ya'll have no idea
These two HUGE guys seem so nice!!        I LOVE THEM!!!
Extraordinary people, extraordinary content.   Extraordinary YT channel!
hilarious episode guys!
As a Scotsman and long time yes theory watcher this is amazing haha!
this video made me laugh so much and i really needed it so badly so thank you so much,
❤️❤️❤️🇵🇭
Thomas looks like an ant next to them LMFAOO
12:38 is my favorite part of this video
You know it's strong when you hear bagpipes 😂
Love your creative competition!! So fun!!! 💪🏻
im getting nostalgic memory of vikings what what history was like back in the old world
I LOVE how they are so strong without being dry and ripped 😍😍😍😍 THIS is how a REAL MANS body should be 😉😍😍😍
What a fantastic video- content, vibe, editing...... Thanks so much, needed the laughs and the fun!
I really love them. The relationship between them is just something incredible.❤
"I'm 70 kilos".. "-that's cute,innit"  I laughed way too hard at this 😂😂😂😂
what that song at 3:30?
Folks, tell me your carried on even further North to do the NC500? It’s magical…
Voices deeper than Baikal!
Great Video! They are such cool guys
The bigger the friendlier!
😍
HOW IS ERIC -
right at the start when "Glasgow" comes on screen, the backdrop is Oban... about 100 miles north of Glasgow
Omg that thumbnail is so funny. I just had to click on the video. I'm an ugly hairy ogar.
What Thomas and Thomas failed to understand is that Eric's got some Russian spirit in him. Those Russians...
Looks like a herpes outbreak is seeking discomfort
I love how they joked with Eric being the weakest, and suddenly he just blows everyone's mind with the 200 kilo lift. Honestly impressive for all the things everyone did, what a good friendship you guys have.  Edit: the final workout was even more beautiful to see him achieve! Good work to Eric!
Content creators are amazing cause they meet eachother for the first time and it’s like they’ve been brothers their whole lives. Wholesome af.
The lamp shade literally had me in stitches 😂
they said he was the weakest but proved he was far from it lol
Eric showed some Slavic power...
WOW great story those two men deserve it all. GREAT JOB GUYS YOU ARE AMAZING HUMANS. as someone who also struggles with autism you made me cry alot. its amazing to see others like us succeed so much when we have alot stacked against us. love you guys and TY
Luke and tom are just the best , great athletes, wonderful human beings, and really giant❤️❤️
" I wanna do a drug test after this" hahahahahhahaha
When you guys coming to South Africa ?🙋‍♂️
Alternate title: I spent a day with big men
you guys should try CrossFit with a competitive CF games athlete
Nice video guyssa
Love this video! it was inspiring, funny, meaningful and educational! Thank you so much! :)
The fact that Eric was underestimated by everyone 🤣 he’s got some bragging rights now
When you put all the strength bars on max level on your custom character
I’m stronger
Not me crying 😭
Yesss my boys! Always love watching them on world’s strongest, such wholesome guys
Amazing video guys! Have been following the Stoltman Bros since they first came on the scene, being 6' 9 myself I get the "twig" thing!! I wish I knew you were in Glasgow! Could have taken you out on the water - hopefully next time.
so basically the wim hof method  paid off
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
These are not the 2 strongest guys in strongman. Tom won World's Strongest Man 2021, but there's probably 4 guys at the top right now between Tom, Martins Licis, Oleksii Novikov, and Mateusz Kieliszkowski (healthy anyway).
Gentle giants
Bro I want a NordicTrack and I don’t even like working out but I love hiking my mind is blown right now I WANT ONE
Little Garden
Literal vikings.
That was an awesome episode.. the stoltman brothers look like there a blast to hangout with.. you guys are blessed to experience the things you do..
No word just WOW
Eric has some strength genetics
0:22 Bijorn ironside viking fans where u at
Just goes to show you that the “big guys” at the gym could be some of the nicest people there haha
5:54 just made my day 🤣🤣🤣
This may be the best video so far! Watch until the end haha yessssss!
What a video 👏🏻
Glad to see Eric on the channel, he is pure yes theory vibes
The hide and seek game got me crying 😂
NAIS.. SUPPORT FROM ECUADOR
ErRIC Eric Erci eric!!! aweome bruv
LOL I like the fact they comment “we are the strongest men in the world” and you show up to their competition and they place 1st and 2nd just to prove it hahaha. 3 mins in and ive already left two comment jesus christ. I need friends Lol.
jesus Christ 1:40 in and i legit forgot this was a yes theory video
So glad that you guys are putting so many people on to the world of strongman! (And lifting in general)
Nobody :      Thomas: Eggs are size
Thanks so much for sharing, really enjoyed watching, you guys are amazing.
I can’t believe you guys were in Scotland and never said 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲crying
they are so damn sweet and kind  These videos never fail to make me smile
I'm pretty sure they are just the vikings
I was smiling the whole video.
Duuuude the fact you have muscle issues gave me chills I injured my neck muscles and now the “knuckle” that my head sits on is completely fucked I had to step out of the gym for life i went from being fit to a skinny fuck again and its depressing but seeing someone i look up to facing something similar just gave me power. Love ya’ll
I always look forward to watching your videos ❤️ They make my life better
Could not of chosen two better reps for introducing you audience to strongman. So happy to see Luke and Tom on your channel
great vid! the stoltman brothers are dope!
After watching this my testosterone ↗️↗️↗️↗️
Great video!
The two strongest men , more like the strongest and most wholesome guys in the world.
Strongmen on the outside: 👹👹😠😤💪💪😤 Strongmen on the inside: ☺️🌸😄👍💪💪
11:30 he may be small, but he's also russian
Dude what the hell,  as someone that follows the World's Strongest Man scene, I didn't expect to see the Stoltman brothers on this channel, that's awesome !!
These strong men are so COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Loved the games at the end.

ERIC “THE RUSSIAN BEAR” T
The best thing about this is everyone seems to be having a great time and we have a great time watching all of you.
The stoltman bros :D
I loved this video! It was absolutely inspiring and I was smiling the ENTIRE time!! I love to see different paths people take in life, and I feel like they have one that people only dream of achieving. Even though they're only human like us, I love how this video brings to light the struggles everyone goes through to get where they are today. Thanks for this awesome upload! ❤❤ I love you guys!
This has to be one of the best vid’s I’ve seen in a wile. LOL the size of the 3 of you next to them haha
The thumbnail tho 😂😂
I like
Such great content
I thought I was tripping when I saw Tommy in a clip of Giants live. Thankfully I am still sane :)
I was literally smiling the whole time! You guys are so funny and I just love y’all’s videos!
Today I feel very sick but watching this Video makes me feel much better! <3
All right Eric!
Twister with Giants Hahahahahahaha
Finally the STOLTMEN BROTHERS get some well deserved recognition
For such freakishly strong beasts they both seems like the sweetest and cutest men in Scotland
Loved this one, guys! The brothers seem like such fun, down-to-earth dudes.
This is truly amazing...
This is awesome
Loved this! Inspiring, funny and adventurous. And of course... Scotland!
omfg again my nans side is from iverness
Wow! What a great story, editing and perfect combo of serious and funny. I laughed, I cried, I will watch this one again! (I've watched most of them more than once)
I am screaming in my office when they completed the Atlas Stone Challenge
Superb these guys have done so well.  I had a job to film them years ago and just missed out I so wish I'd met them and also wish I'd seen you the Yes Theory gang when you were 30 mins from my house!  I would have come to film for you:)
Wow I've smiling the whole video, the positive vibe that Luke and Tom are radiating so joyful... I'm so happy you guys did this video absolutely loved it, we are actually celebrating Diwali here in Mauritius so happy Diwali to everyone, Cheers and lots of love 💕
This is so inspiring! For me they’re gentle giants 💖
as someone who ethnicity is from the highlands, I LOVE THIS VID OMFG
I'm only 5'7 but would love to eat and workout with these guy's... lmk I have no job rn haha
you forgot Brian Shaw
Awesome! I love strongman. And the stoltmans are awesome!
YouTube is Hell...    But Yes Theory....    This is HEAVEN
This is the epitome of an entertaining video! What a video 👏🏻 Love from India. Also Happy Diwali guys! ❤️✨
If the giant give Eric some training for a month he will be something :- AKA Eric the saitama👊!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡¡!!!!!!!!¡¡¡!!!!
SCOTLAND LESSS GOO  Me knowing that they're naked under the kilts 😂
My home town heroes! Awesome to see them on the channel!
Blessed with the opportunity to watch these guys in Sacramento for Worlds Strongest this summer. Tom was killer!!! Worlds Strongest is coming back to Sacramento next summer!!!! I’d love to see Yes Theory come out to Sacramento  for it. I’d love to be the special guest!!! 😅
Hello everyone was great video I have  lived in England since 1971 I come from a village outside Inverness  called Muir-of - Ord I was only up there a monthago  and had a few DRAMS in Inverness I will be back for Christmas and Hogmanay 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 much love to you all from MoMo in UK Stay safe and well xx 💞xx
Love how the all had to be topless for breakfast haha 😂
Freakin amazing episode. The stoltman brothers are genuinely nice guys, and their younger brother too, I met them when I recently did the NC500. They actually took the time to talk to me and show me around their place, seriously respect and admiration for them 💪
they are so sweet!
Eric is going to have ladies calling after this…
what a pair of legends love their personalities
This is amazing content. Thank you so much!
best video ever
such great men
Wait is that one guy from  buzzfeed?
I was not expecting the ending skit (twister, hide and seek, etc). that was hilarious that they played along with it
wen #TeamSeas
Great video guys! Good lads them brothers 🤙🏼
imagine these dudes as your school bullies. wyd?
So good to see you here in Scotland! 🥰❤❤
I call the Stoltman Brothers "The Super Mario Brothers of Strongman"
12:37 holy crap if the world's strongest man says "How are you so strong" coming from him that's got to feel so good I would cherish that
i really enjoyed this video. Thanks Yes Theory!
What a great video 💯
Only some versions of Norse mythology will you find that giants were already here. (Other versions, like the bible, and the Indian history, etc. says the giants came from the gods mating with humans, who they created.
Your strongest and most wholesome video ever
Those guys are awesome 🤣
the energy at 14:05 makes me so happy omg
Absolutely love the Stoltmans, will follow them forever. 1st time ive watched a Yes Theory vid and loved it. 80kg farmers walk is no joke, well done that lad
5:53 LMAO
I absolutely love this!!!
18:25 this is giant hide & seek aha
4:12 lmaoooo
Thomas looked like he was going to pass out during breakfast 🤣
Wonderful thanks ♥️🇨🇦🌏
Great video, the Strongman community has always been so positive (sans the last 2 years) and its great to see more people see this great sport. Tom is such an inspirational dude.
Please post more bts on the other channel, these two brothers seem like the sweetest, gentlest giants I've ever seen. I could watch an hour of them just goofing around with you guys!!!!
Wow is that true geordie?
Thanks guys for this amazing video 💪🏼💪🏼
This is back suicíde 😀
Brilliant to see tom and luke are getting the recognition the deserve!
Great video. Love their story. Way to go Luke&Tom 👊
While you're in Europe come visit Malta, it would make for an incredible video!
Where is amar missing Him badly
Such a cool video!!!!!
Don't worry guys they are just giant teddy bears
eric have russian blood so he can enter the "russian bear mode" This is how he is so strong :) :)
I wish the vid was longer lol
Moral of the story: Never judge a book by its cover 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🥇
it feels weird my home, inverness, a town with 82,000 people be said in a vid like this 😅
17:24   Lamo look at the size difference like are they even the same species at this point 😆
those boys are tough, surprised ye could understand them though !
I loved this video, they seem like  awesome human beings
You should spend time in the Scottish highlands yourselves, it’s pretty special
Loved this video ahah!!
Conclusion: Thomas isn’t as strong as we thought 😂😂
Eric is truly built different
I think I need to hire them when I move out of my apartment😂
eric is good addition to yes theory
Dont know anything about these guys but they seem like the kindest giants ever. Awesome video 👏🏼
They’re like gentle giants. I def love this episode!
Eric’s strength caught me off guard 👌👌
Incredibly entertaining video! You guys should do more things like this, exploring the unique lifestyles of members of the Yes Fam!
Thank you for highlighting the Stoltman Brothers, they are such great genuine guys!
They seem strangely gentle
Great video, love to see you coming to the north
one of my favourite youtube channels in my home city of Inverness and with the stoltman brothers unreal!
The shot of all you men shirtless at breakfast is soo fantastic. Great video, and much love for the spiciest boys in Scotland
This was such a cool video! Even in the Bible David defeated a giant named Goliath! 😊
🔥🔥 video fellas!! The editor is a genius!! 😂😂
Eric was strongest in yestheory after making jokes lmao
This was such a fun video! And inspiring as always! Cant believe you guys were in Scotland!? Come over to the town of Ayr and I'll get you in the local skate park haha
Giants are really friendly.
I love how fricking wholesome this is xD
Mariusz Pudzianowski POLSKA GUROM
This guys always leaves a smile on my face.
I'm going to the gym right after watching this.
i really should go lifting .. im even taller than these guys and got the perfect physique to do this crap .. welp .. *rollsbigfatspliff* 😙💨 .. what was i saying? 🤔
That was a wholesome video! Strongman bros are super cool!
Wowww
Disabilities are no excuses to achieve less.
They seem like the nicest blokes to boot.  I'm so envious of you!
those stone balls looks like they were made from casted concrete.
The Giants or Scotland
I am the girliest girl out there and I thoroughly enjoyed this laughing in the train all the way home.Only Yes theory could have me entertained by big brut men love it😂😂
loved the hide and seek 🔥
what natural conditions helps create strong people?
Your best video yet. Excited what’s more to come!
how tf is eric so strong :D
Proof that us men are simple.. stone on ground... Man lift stone... Stone on shelf... Men happy...
Thomas looked like Ronal the barbarian when he sat in between the giants for breakfast🤣
Come to Manchester!
I abaolutelt hate the idea of having a fucking TV screen in front of your face whilst on a tread mill. Go take a run outside
these guys speak in bass language
they are such a nice guys ♥
Great video!  They seem like 2 of the coolest guys to hang with for sure.  I wonder if they could help me move maybe.
So much energy in this Video! Made my day😀
I can't be the only one who is thinking about Vinland Saga..
B  I  G
If only I know you guys were in Scotland. Hope you enjoyed your stay
Ahhh yes theory are in the UK. Drop me a message if you need Central London Accommodation : )
The Hide & Seek part killed me hahaha
One of your best videos, i died 🤣🤣🤣🤣 so funny.
their voices are literally like giants in the movie😭
i really just can't pass the deep voice Dammm and then you see them lifting oh boy!!!! That just man!!!! they can take down castles...
Friendly giants!!!
makes me proud to be scottish, unbelievable video
hearing scottish ppl say breakfast makes me laugh everytime
Nice people, nice video, nice channel, nice vibe, nice everything damn..   Cheers from Mexico
"I'm 70 kilos" "that's cute" 😂😂😂
I haven't laughed this hard in a while, thank you. This is now my next best video you guys have done.
eh wow no Brian Shaw!
Great clip..content...Gentle Giants...!
Thomas - “Eggsercise”
Their deep laughs are so comforting
Eddie Hall and Hafthor Bjornsson for a reason....
What a wholesome video
This was heartwarming  Also you now finally know what a lime is
They even sound like giants
4:12 Lmfaoooooooo the raindrop
uhhm.. maaan, whats with this giants. They seem so gentle and they’re like kids trap in a giant body. Same as Brian Shaw, Eddie Hall, The Mountain. And now this 2 brothers. just wow. I bet you feel safe when you’re around with these giants 😂
great video
10,000 calories a day. Imagine having to eat 5x what you eat every single day all year long... no wonder they're sick of eating.
Eric is a BEAST!!! I’m shook
that animation history thing was insanely good
Im so happy you guys got to spend time with the nicest, strongest, and most genuine brothers in the world. I love Toms story and Lukes love and admiration for his brother. I love this beyond words and am so happy you all got to meet them. I hope to be so lucky some day!! Thanks again for a journey we couldn't tag along on but could thoroughly enjoy vicariously!
Fun video. Would love to see more of those two giants on You Tube. 💕
beautiful culture
I'm 70kg! That's cute 😂😂
I absolutely hate that I haven't even watched the content but, the first thing I do when I see " YES " is hit that like button, wish there was a love button. Peace
this was great content ! made me smile :)
One of your best videos yet!   The Stoltman Brothers are amazing. Best of luck to them in the future!
I think the Grandma from Transnistria may have blessed Eric with superhuman strength
Never thought yes theory would be in Scotland, especially not as close as glasgow! :o
Yes theory is made of dwarf members.
Wow what a great video--looks like an awesome time had by everyone
Gentle Giants. What a great story. 👍🏼
Really nice guys. Good job Eric!
"im eighty kilos" "thats cute"
Video was great BUT do not show OBAN and say its Glasgow there is a difference of 100 miles
The Yes Theory Team should come to Vancouver, Canada for a day
One of the best Best episode of yes theory, both the brothers r so amazing. Tom is such an inspiration to people who face autism. Love these guys.
Loved the video, guys. Seeing you so close to where I live was a very strange feeling as well. Would love to say hi next time you guys come to the UK
i dont see pudzian there 🤔
Tom's cheeky little grin at 5:43 is just too damn precious
It was great to see these 2 as the best hype men ever during the stone segment!
Is uh vary nice
"don't judge a book by its cover" the so called weak killed it. Seeking discomfort made the giant transform his life and not dwell on his disability. Touching story ...💪🏿🇲🇼
It's like those two guys are already in the yes family for years and years 💓 really loved the video fullest and liked from there bottom the heart
I loved this! I am a huge fan  Outlander show which takes place in Inverness, Scotland. Thanks guys!
Note how the strong men do not have toxic macho personalities, shows how sensitivity does not take away from your masculinity
Such genuine and humble guys!
Wow you guys are so amazing ! Everywhere you go is just filled with wonderful interactions. Truly inspiring
Yaaas i saw their comment under your vid, so cool you went through with it! :D also: ERIC IS A FUCKING CHAMP, WOW!
I had a smile on my face this entire video
ERIC! 😳 11:35 WTFFFFFF
I love how they aren't like muscle builder types, who everyone thinks looks the strongest.
I just loved every second of this! Thank you for sharing with us 🙌🏼😘🙌🏼
What's the weirdest way you've woken up? "Ah well, a giant jumped on top of me at 5:30"
The bromance is real. Epic collab. Hopefully more in future!
WOOOO YES THEORY YES
You guys should visit Ghost Town Living
The little ploop sound is my new addiction
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Build as mountains ,humble as feather. Just wao.
YES YES YES YES, YES THEORY FINALLY CAME TO SCOTLAND! I AM SO HAPPY TO SEE THINGS ABOUT MY HOME LAND FINALLY FEATURED ON MY FAVOURITE CHANNEL! ❤🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
this just like a lil nas x video
This was sick!  The vibes were so good in this!  First video of scene from you guys but won't be the last.  Great content, structure, editing, etc.  Great video guys.
Amazing Story, Truly ❤️
Such a genuine, wholesome, and feel good video. They have such great personalities and very humble giants. Loved the video, it kept me smiling the whole time.
these guys are actual human heros
Great idea doing a video with them, I find them both incredibly inspiring.
Great to see my favourite sport being acknowledged!
Prettttayyyy prettayyyyy pretttay goood
Loved how Eric proved you all wrong with how strong he is!
Notice how you were smilling the whole time.....  Yes you Me too... Btw Happy Diwali to everyone
The editing is epic... video is epic.
Luke and Tom are living embodiment of an alpha male, a truly remarkable species indeed
Great video , love seeing all the new places yes theory vist and the friends they make along the way!
That dude literally lifted nearly half a ton when he lifted this thing with the three of you
Top lads. Stay spicy!
Spicy 🌶🌶  Collab
I love them both so much they are so amazing
Go to the Kodokan! Also, spend 48 hours with David Goggins
Scotland is one of the most stunning places in the world
People want to say ill get fat, Ha Look at These Dudes! MuscleMan! Continue Seeking Greatness! By The Way Sounds Dangerous what if y'all stay on Ilha da Queimada Grande (Snake Island) For few a hours
That was a pretty spicy video.
Hate to break it to you guys but when it flashed up "glasgow" on screen the actual city in the background is Oban not Glasgow
Loved it !! what great guys !!!!🤣
So humble ..humble beginnings. Amazing guys.
I loved everything about this video. Wish I could experience this.
Nice
Just add Eric permanently to the team
ur the giant here, yes theory
Wow. Just came back from gym. And couldn't imagine how fun this video was.
Scotland's so pretty and the people are amazing too. Great to watch ❤️❤️
14:00 and the skinniest strongman ever reward goes to... !
Worlds Strongest Men 2022: Thomas, Tommy and Eric!!
Vikings are highly overrated with their strength and size, I am sure a Viking would be easily defeated in a combat by an African
If you ever want to help someone find family he never met hmu my father came over from Italy in the early 40s but when I was born I never got to meet anyone from his side grandparents gone already and he didn't talk to anyone
Wait, these guys live in my city. What the hell?
I really enjoyed this video🤍
What’s with all the bagpipes I live in Scotland and I barely ever hear them
The world should discover the strongman community. I've never seen athletes that are so supportive of each other win or lose. Let's hope the money parasites wont infiltrate this world and corrupt everything like they did with every other sport that is popular.
This is one of the most fun videos you guys have ever made, these giants are hilarious and so down to earth :D
That was the fastest 20 minutes of my life. So good!
5:55 I couldn't stop laughing
"the weakest guy ever"  turns out to have the best genetics for strength!
Breakfast table scene is best 🤣🤣🤣
brilliant! loved this video
Such a fun episode!
You guys should come to grenada a small Caribbean island it's very very beautiful you won't regret it at all and the people are really nice
Awesome video. I laughed so much. Wow.
This... Was amazing. The Stoltman Brothers are incredible, humble, beautiful, lovely, gems of people. I've been following them for a couple of years now and I feel you guys did them justice. They are amazing, and you are amazing. Love over fear!
Now y’all gotta meet Martins & Evan singleton two epic North American strongman!
3:23 is just too wholesome and badass. I can't stop smiling 😭
Tom - when i first got to the gym thats the most uncomfortable ive ever been in my life
Thank you for this! By far, this was my favorite episode in at least 6 months! Would love to see more of the Stoltmans with Yes Theory
i laughed so much watching this my stomach pains, wonderful guys, thank you for spreading the positivity ... Please do consider visiting Pune City in India its one of the best cities in India and I can show you around the culture the vibe and so much that world needs to know ....
Proper good lads them two.
Absolute beautiful ❤️
Wow the editor is surprisingly strong haha
This might be your best video ever. Smiled through the entire thing!
Thomas: we brought the weakest guy on this trip!  Eric: hold my beer
Bruhs a massive human Being
Ayo some of these dudes kinda sound like vikings
You guys should do a story spending a day with Sarah Talbi. She is a mom that was born with no arms and does everything with her feet and legs. She has videos on YT and it's just amazing what she has overcome to be able to function. She lives in Brussels - It would be a very interesting video and inspirational. She does her dishes, cooks, takes showers, changes daughters clothing .... everything. It's really impressive and extremely uplifting. I also think she has done some modeling?
They look like they had a second puberty.
Amazing video as always!LOVE FROM SRI LANKA!
giant legends are in every culture and there is actually plenty of historical evidence for them. The most reliable source being the Bible. Skeletons have been found. Just thought I'd put that out there.
This was one of my favourite videos of yours. Partly because I've heard of the Stoltman brothers before, but also because I love drawing inspiration from people who are completely different for me. Thanks for sharing, as ever.
❤️
This was so wholesome. Great video
Been waiting for this for so long!! Two of my favourite people in the world, with my favorite group!
This was so amazing! I’m still smiling! Thank you so much Yes Theory for this video. The accomplishments and the beautiful personalities of these two young men will live long in my memory.
Amazing to see you guys do these impossible things day in day out! This video blew my mind... INSANE Keep it going i love you guys <3
"smelling salts" yep that's cocaine
Yay, Luke and Tom! I love them and all the strongmen. The sport is really taking off. Everyone should check out Big Loz's channel, too. Thanks for this great video!
I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!
I also love that these dudes dont do steroids/synthetics
They lifted the weight because they are yes theory.  🙌.  No giving up.  Just wow
insightful, unique, emotional, challenging and funny, all in 20 minutes 🙌 epic video
Why do I want to go lift weights with these dudes now?!
I genuinely can’t believe yous where in my city never mind my country. I hope yous enjoyed your time in Scotland and hope you will be back one day
They should change their channel's name to Gentle Giants
Mans voice alone could split mountains
Very wholesome im proud of Eric for pushing himself
Great video guys. Looking forward to these November videos coming
That was great. So fun to watch. Would love to meet those guy, they seem to be amazing.
This dudes voice alone could lift a car
These tiny guys are so lucky. Getting hugged by strong strong, but gentle, giants. Are the Stoltmans single? Asking for a friend!
Eric is strong!
2:12 isnt this oban?
Us Scots are a different breed.  Alba gu Bragh 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Man, really did'nt expect Eric to perform so well
Please have these two on future episodes. Could you imagine having these two men ask you leave the country, get blind folded to an excursion, or asking to have a party on their boats?  Very different than the Yes team asking. 😁
why these tapes when they lift the stones?
He said “that’s cute innit” I m dead😂it was this moment that Carl knew, that we had to gain weight lmao
You should hang out with Eddie Hall "The Beast" next lol
his voice alone haha. awesome stuff
you all look so adorable next to them 😂😂😂 cuties
Yes Theory never clickbaits us and I really appreciate that. Those were literal giants.
those voices...
Okay i have to say, Luke and Tom are probably my favourite lads in the strongman world. Getting to see you guys with them is pure gold for me. Listening to their glorious bass voices and watching them pick up heavy shit is awesome. Seeing that + you guys being very out of your element is just gravy on top.
Its weird seeing giants celebrate xD
Comment
This episode was so good I have to comment twice but the way they bullied Eric was hilarious HAHAHA
Anyone who wants to watch more Strongman, Definitely check out The Stoltman Brother’s YouTube but also Martins Licis Brian Shaw Eddie Hall Robert Obert Big Loz Official
Even their voices are strong, damn
WOW! What a well edited video. So many different emotions in just 20 min and such a great message at the end. Fantastic job.
This whole video kept me smiling through out.
I CANT WAIT FOR MOREEE MAN I LOVE U ALL SO MUCH
This was such a feel good video!!
these brothers are so cool
Eric needs to become a strongman now
The Stoltman Brothers are such an inspiration, thanks for getting together with them and making this great video happen. Truly amazing, i appreciate all your effort. Love how much fun you all had together.
I love how they underestimate Eric and at the end he turns out to be the strongest of the group! 💯
They were so comforting and encouraging.
Hahaha! Seeing the boys stick their noses _right_ into that ammonia capsule was so fucking funny
You guys without fail put out one of the most wholesome videos on YouTube, Kudos!
Thumbs up for the Yes Theory Team meeting up with Ross Edgley!!! 👍🏼
this was so wholesome. it made me smile today, which hasnt happen in a while
Erick screaming in the water  was everything.  I had to watch that 5 times 😅😅😆 And he's the strongest in weight lifting 😄. How ??
love this
Amazing video, as always
how do they SOUND like strongmen?
Bruh when they all had there shirts off I started dying😂😂😂😂
The memes😂😂 weakest man
Loved the video and the vibe in it! So cool that you share not only positivity in seeking discomfort but also stories that change lives. 😊
those guys are insane! I genuinely thought you'd put a deep voice changer on them
"We brought the weakest man we could think of on this."   Me a few minutes later watching the 'weakest man' lift 200 kilos: 😲
Lovely Video
This man has so much testosterone, his voice sounds like rocks grinding.!   But such genuine and down to earth lads! 💪🏻
They look like Thor from the new God of War 😂
This looked like so much fun.
Crazy amount of work put in these guys are amazing, its not just a sport but a whole lifestyle effecting every moment until they stop competing.  Would hate to have the food bill!
At 3:37 when the music comes in they are uilleann pipes which are an Irish instrument and not bag pipes.
My husband did 2 Tough Mudders on the same day, and took part in the very 1st World's Toughest Mudder. He's always pushing himself to achieve more!
Damn.. Eric's really really strong guy💪 And TD too..
Of course when you guys visit Glasgow I'm abroad :( maybe next time
A hernia
I’m from Scotland amazing video guys !!! Hope yous had a wonderful time in my country I always loved going to the Highland games as a kid and witnessing feats of strength that were really inspiring to me as a kid here in scotland we look at strongmen as legends
Eric is dope
Love this story man! These kind of video's are just so interesting to watch!
So happy you guys came to my wee country 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Laughs in strong
Great power and control are all there... I mean their voice tone
I'm so glad you guys took the opportunity to learn about World's Strongest Man. It definitely deserves more publicity because the people that train for it deserve all the fame.
Something interesting, _anyone_ can claim to be “the worlds strongest man” It’s simply so vague and unprovable literally _anyone_ who wants to can claim it.
My thumbs are way bigger that yours hehehe ( I loves this video)
My back hurts just from watching this ;D
Being the strongest man doesn't only mean physical strength, but also what it takes mentally to prepare yourself and seek discomfort. Love these 2 gentle giants for showing how gentle they are despite their appearance. Love Yes Theory for featuring them too, you guys will always be the best! <3
Amazing :)
Id like to see another episode with this 2 Little Guys 💓
What a crossover 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
They are so strong that even their voice became strong
I’am 70 kilos. ”That’s cute innit” 😂
❤️❤️❤️
This made my whole week,these 2 guys are amazing!!
As a Scotsman I approve
I know that they’re absolutely massive men, but is it odd that I think they’re adorable?? They’re so sweet & their faces are adorable
Thanks so much for coming to spend time with us and experience our strongman life! We loved it ❤️❤️❤️
Great to see you made it to my hometown of Glasgow and to top it off with The Stoltman Brothers 💪
Such a fun video!
I had no idea Tom is autistic. What an amazing man to accomplish as much as he has. As someone who has an autistic son and multiple autistic friends and contemplate if I'm autistic myself, it's easy for me to say that he really is a real superhero. What an inspiration!
Hello guys! Wassup? Great video again. Keep going. Have a great day everyone ;)
In that breakfast cinematic scene they look like the definition of gentle giants 😄
Amazing content 👍🏻
This was a cool video !!!
I wish I could give this video a billion views. The passion these two have for what they do really comes out. It's truly the story of two normal dudes just finding something they love, sticking to it, and becoming legends. There's more motivation in this than anything I've watched all year, even if it isn't specifically meant as a motivational video.
The russian blood in Eric show's it's true power
Wow that's so great, You guys should find sometime and come to Africa 🌍 Love yes theory
Eric is like a lowkey strong man, he killin' every workout like he's done it before damn 🔥
Best video ever 😍🥰
Haven’t you guys watched squid games yet 🤣 lock your feet on either side of the rope before the game starts and lean back 😂😆 as if it would have a made a difference :p
This was so amazing!!!
Let's go Eric!
Please don't stop using the water drop sound effect
Great video! very friendly and kind males that are like five times bigger than me :D
Do they just live in the woods?
These two brothers seem like the nicest people in the world. They got a new follower here
I still can't believe I'm the strongest member of Yes Theory. Don't ever underestimate the Tabach power. Thank you Stoltman Brothers for an incredible experience!
Imagine helping the Stolman brother overcome their fears. Thanks for that fun ending sketch! 💪🏻
Next to those guys shirtless, Thomas looks like that scene in Captain America where they put Chris Evans' face on the skinny body lol
Watching this from Scotland is so fun to watch great video guys
Lol the ending where you guys played hide and seek and twister and stuff was hilarious
Their voices are deeper than I thought possible
Wow! Getting to travel there and meet men like them. What an amazing opportunity!
You’re in the uk? You better do a road trip from Scotland through Manchester and then Cardiff down the bottom coast and over to London, trust me you’ll love it uk is the best place for a sick road trip you can see so much in so little time
Luke has the biggest heart in strongman no doubt
Omg I can't believe you got to meet the Stoltman brothers!!! Tom is SO my ideal man 😍😘 I'm gonna watch this a couple of times 😁 This was such a fun video guys 👍🏆
4:36 his tattoo reads "kushi" it means happyness in Hindi , a common girls name in India.
Thomas is the skinnest man their.
Every man's dream play ground 9:59
SCOTLAND!!!!
This was an awesome video man Felt like I was with y'all, I've watched for a while but honestly it's only time to time it's not every day, Keep up the good content Though
Fact :-  They don't have a bad vedio , not a single one ♥️
His voice is soo deep...i can feel it through my screen
Was just watching Outlander😌
YOU GUYS WERE AT GIANTS LIVE?!?
The Viking energy is over 9000 in this one.
Tom giggling at Thomas in the kitchen is literally my fav 2 secs of video ever hahahaha
i wonder how big their toilet is or if they even use the same size one.
This was the most fun I have felt in quite a while 😆✨
Spicy 🌶
Stay Spicy 🌶 🌶🌶🌶🌶
The last 3mins of this video is so funny, I love it! Also, it must be awsome being the sister to the these brothers.
So much fun! Good laughs! Cheers.
Welcome to Scotland & Hello from the Scottish Borders.🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🥂💖  Bit late now but hope you had an amazing time. Maybe I should have watched the whole video first but I couldn't help myself.  It's not very often we see such big YouTubers come to Scotland,  & pay such an in our culture ect.  You should come tour Scotland at some point
OMG THE STOLTMANS PLUS YES THEORY?! I literally watch these guys all the time! Love strongman 😭😭😭
I need a scientific reason as to how Eric was able to lift the heavy weights even though all three of them look the same size.
You guys were in my hometown and I didn’t know about it 😩😩😩💔
instant like, before i saw the video.. Strongman is a very cool sport... but here in austria it is not that big.. :(
Two absolute gents
Life is Beautiful complicated by humans.
So your telling me you guys were only a short while away from me and I didn't have a clue?! 🤣  Absolutely incredible video this time round and definitely the funniest!
two.
Their voice is so deep like the Mariana trench
Soo fun
So excited for a November riveting with yes theory 🤞🏼
The VIBEZ in YesTheory videos are always immaculate
Demn I’m here *early.*
I love Tom and Luke, fellow Scotsmen and Gers fans. However ultimately Tom is my 7 year old son’s hero, he is autistic too and finds it amazing someone like him can be a superhero
I don’t see Eddie hall
This video is crazy!!
I wanna hang out with Tom and Luke 🥺 Theyre so kind. And I love how it was just a bunch of shirtless grown men essentially cuddling at any given opportunity 😂
not bad.
This is one of the most perfect moments I've ever seen in a video  https://youtu.be/RXWyuO3v4vM?t=355
I’m so excited for this month
seru banget!
Go and SUBSCRIBE they deserve it.
Y'all wondering why Eric Tabach is so strong - after all he has Russian blood running through his veins
THE ENDING BIT OF THE FILM GOT ME ON THE FLOOR HAHAHAH
enjoyed every min of this! that looked fun, those guys are awesome
The term “friendly giant” is held true in these two gentlemen. Very respectful and caring individuals.
One of the best  video from yes theory who agrees with me 👍🏽❤️❤️
The price of the norditrack thing is insane
the stoltmans are so cute
Wauw what lovely!
This is awesome
Love the video! Love the stoltmans!
The deepness of their voice shows the sheer testosterone produced in their bodies. Absolutely insane
Those big guys also have big warm hearts!
We need to hear the story about them on your podcast 😍😍 invite them please
Funniest video ever ! <3
I wanna fight them 😤  Looks like easy competition
Teacher: I need some strong kids to pick up the chairs Me and the boys:
it's refreshing to see these wholesome giants breaks the stereotype among them 🔥
The hide and seek part was so cuteee. I want my uncle to be like them lol.
4:10
Too bad u didnt reach out to Mariusz Pudzianowski (Poland) which had the most wins ( 5 ) of the World's Strongest Man competition in 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2008.
"We got the weakest man we could think of on this!!!" Eric: Hold my BEER!!!! 🤣🤣
Blup
Blup
Sick video Tom & yes gang
nice
The photo you use for Glasgow at 2:12 is of Oban, Scotland not Glasgow.  Oban has a population of less than 10 thousand 🤣
The breakfast scene is something I never knew I needed to see, made my day! Eric has a hidden talent. Maybe he should compete in the next strongman competition! :)
Mr Incredibles siblings be like:
10:45 Lmao did they all just take poppers?
Great. Loved it
Your videos have lot of voice overs and its not good at all. I think u should hire a prof. Voice artist , this long voice overs are fucking annoying
Heyy
this was funny and heartwarming all at the same time, great video
I was dissapointed when brian didnt win yet another title but after learning more about the stoltman brothers i dont think i could be happier then seeing a man with autism win worlds strongest. Knowing that he will be an icon for people on the spectrum to look up to. He will truly be a hero for many, and his brother could not be prouder. Wonderful family bond right there.
When they talk I can't help to think of Kratos
Wow, this had to be one of the best and most enjoyable videos Ive ever seen
Definitely one of the best videos out there. It's wholesome, funny, entertaining and inspiring.🔥
Do they need wives? I’m in.
Great episode. You could tell the Yes Theory crew actually felt comfortable and were able to let loose
OH my gosh you guys this was soo great!  Talk about gentle giants... what amazing young men ALL of you are!
yes theory  pls buy me the fit machine so i can workout :) <3
ERIC! what the hell man lmaooo how he can lift those up
This is probably one of the most funny videos ever and still inspirational
epic video guys! Luke and tom are 2 of the best athletes in the world. Not just physically, but they're true gentlemen. Hope to see more from you all in the future!
Now come spend a day with this boi :)
Keep it up. Your videos give me genuine hope
I'm 25% Scottish and love Bagpipes!!!!   Edit: Unfortunately can't play them though...
loved your videos, when i heard you were in europe i thought it be amazing if you came to scotland. Did not expect you to come to my home city! great video
Great video! Congrats guys!!!
I'm just speechless... what can i say
Nice big men 🥵🥵
You can tell they really had fun with this one
These videos never fail to make me smile
love those gentle giant
Spicy Boys!! 🌶🌶
The Nordic track actually looks like it'd be an amazing investment I like the idea that it basically makes you feel like you're going along on a hike especially with the change in terrain
One of my favourite videos so far
GOOD FKN CONTENT BOIS
I f**King love you guys! Amazing videos with exceptional editing and narrating. Just always excited to see the adventures you go on and they are always incredible 🙏❤🙏
So that’s where Jay from the Zac and Jay show went 🤔 What a look-alike, it’s unbelievable!
2:12 I swear that's Oban and not Glasgow 😂
14:50 So this is all your meathats are doing? Do I it vegan and you might pull of more. See Patrik Baboumian pull over 500 kg.
This Video is screaming: "SCOTLAND FOREVER!" and i absolutely love it !
who pays them?
These brother are such good guys. Gentle giants who could snap you in half.
Eric has that Russian strength
Brought the weakest person and that person ends up completing everything what an underdog story
How is Eric THAT?!?! Just THAT?!? Cannot believe my eyes that I witnessed that
worlds "strongest" men
I laughed a lot during this awesome video
Oy I can barely do a set of curls with 20lb weights 🤦🏼‍♀️😂😂
They look like genuinely nice lads to hang out with, would love to spend a day with these boys.
The stolten brothers are so cool greetings from Germany
please bring these boys on one of your other random adventures in the future!! their vibes are off the charts and you guys have such great energy together :) also love tom so much he actually is a super hero.  hope they have a channel
How can a human have such a deep voice?! He sounds like pure testosterone
i’m SO excited for this month!!! this is so cool
Brian Shaw enters the chat...
Dude lifts almost half a ton... Jesus... These dudes are beast.
I love you guys so much! You never run out of new ideas of things to do and that is inspirational in itself. Thank you so much for pushing my ideas to the edge.
i love that we can travel the world with you through your lenses☺️💕
this one was a banger, good work guys. those guys look like so much fun to be around. giant yet so kind
I want a poster of the 5 of you sitting at the breakfast table. This just made my day
funny ass vid
*Thus us a lime* 😟
Was great to meet you boys at the competition! Love seeing strongman get this exposure too
STOLTMAN brother's let's goooooo!
WHOOOOOAAAA!!! What an experience! These guys got a great attitude too! You can easily see that in their smiles.
Well thats hell of an episode full of testosterone😂
The sound effect when Eric drove for the polar plunge. *blup* hahahahhahaha
wow wow wow... so great!!!
imagine what they can "eat in a day"
This on the most legit joyful videos I have ever seen 😂
Such a good trip, such good vibes! Anyone in the comments trying to become the next strongman or woman?! 💪
4:10 there's tea all over my computer screen now haha
I have seen so many videos on your channel but your storytelling and cinematography never fail to amaze me.
The whole mood in that video is just amazing
never thought i’d see yes theory in scotland! hope you guys enjoyed this beautiful country
Well done, i love u guys and with this video i love u guys more!
I knew I knew it just by the thumb nail you're talking about my ancestors from Scotland 🔥 an the highland games!!! So in love with this episode 😍 💕
Their voice is so deep that for a second I thought it was some kind of voice filter lol
I need to move to Scotland!  I just cannot get over the sheer size of those fellows!
Keep rocking dude as always ❤️💪
Amazing video, genuinely heartwarming. Excited to see what yes theory does next 💯💯
Yes theory consistently coming out with some of the best content on the platform
This vid makes me realize that the world strongest man is also the world nicest man
Lol, I am stronger than them.
I have followed these Strong men for a few years. But this was on a whole nother level. Absolutely amazing video. I love what you all stand for. 🙏🏼
OK this is the collab I never imagined but I love it.
Are you doing anything with team seas
16 advertising breaks makes this unwatchable
Cool people
legitimately one of your best vids ever. great job
You missed the Brazzers logo
Amazing, Yes theory is growing, Soon to be one of the best channels on the planet
what in the Oliva biscuit(baki) 10k calories
Ohhhh my god I love this sooo much!!!!!!Those 2 giant are gentle giants
There has to be a movie based on there story
Not at all the crossover I was expecting
they are one of the best guests in your show
That was amazing 👏
Awesome video, made me smile a ton
Awesome!
This is just awesome
Luke and Tom are my heros! Tom is such an inspiration to all the kids with autism and parents of kids with autism. He is proof that autism is a super power not a disability! Love them so much! Keep it spicy boys! 🌶
They are not Vikings they are mostly Scandinavian but probably a mix. Viking is really a verb describing a raid.
Eric is a fuckn beast
Eric is Russian and Jew so i'm not impressed by this i wanted to see more
I've literally been binging your videos now I am accidentally early for this one. I've cried, felt chills down my spine, a sense of longing for adventures  and a newfound inspiration to take my dreams to the highest. Your videos truly transcend languages and send a message that I think everyone needs to hear. You guys are so inspiring and I hope you guys continue this passion of yours for a long time. Thank you Yes Theory for teaching me to seek discomfort.
These guys are both wholesome and terrifying 🥴👌🏻💕 this was so fucking cute… they are just giant teddy bears
Eric with the innate Russian bear strength coursing through his veins
Simply the best.
Eric is fucking strong dude 😂
Imagine that's your girlfriends dad 💀😭
Omg, so much fuuunnn!!!! love it so much
Great
This is one of my favorites yes theory's videos. I just LOVED those big boys.
Stoltman in any scandinavian language translates to "Proud Man", and these giant have something to be proud of! Amazing display of the capabilities of the human body when infused with dedication and hard work!
Can we all just take a second to acknowledge that Eric was carrying 132 pounds in each hand! 🤯The dude weighs like 160…. maybe
Why is no one talking about how Eric killed it??? He was amazing
Aww I LOVED this video!! It was so good!
i wonder how bad on your body it is to be that big it cant be healthy
Did Thomas Elbow just crack a little? 18:26 D:
Absolutely inspiring stories. They're incredibly strong and great people; also, funny, funny video guys. What an amazing experience.
I'm a Scot, knowing the north sea, I don't envy you that morning swim
Never thought I’d see Yes Theory in Inverness !
This video was so wholesome...just a couple of dudes hanging out and having video...so heartfelt 🥰
“I’m 70 kilos” “That’s cute innit”
Nowadays i am going through phase where i rewatch old yes theory episodes and just start bursting with laughter and happiness. I just keep smiling throughout the video. IDk why but i don't enjoy the newer videos as much but you guys are just awesome and keep making videos that you guys enjoy. Your channel has grown over time and the stories you guys tell have also changed but i really really miss that old energy you guys had( it might be because as you guys got more matured your content changed up a bit and i am only 17 so i resonate with the older videos more). But you guys are just awesome with out your videos i would've remained the shy, introvert kid I was, so all I have to say is thank you thank you thank you
Sounds like someone put a vocal fx on their voices haha
I think this is probably their best video yet. Seems like everyone had a genuinely great time
The weakest member casually lifting stuffs hahaha
Let's good  The video was very entertaining
Wow I was just listening to Joe Rogan talking about them with Rob Kearney a couple of days ago, this is really fun to see!
Wow, I’m kinda early
As a video editor you got me with the intro. Awesome guys!!
I want to see these guys try to do pullups
brb, rationing, scrimping, selling my kidney, and saving so i can buy one of those nordic tracker work out things! how cool.
Wonderful collab! Can’t get more humble than the stoltman brothers!
This is pure love
We lift heavy shit because it’s cold as shit here, and it warms us up ;) love to see Scotland on this guys, nice one!
I've only started watching you guys over the last couple months but you've definitely gained a new fan and subscriber 👍🙏
Epic
HAPPY DIWALI YES THEORY.  LOVE FROM INDIA!
The Stoltmen brothers are two amazing guys! What a beautiful story, they will be hero’s for the younger generation!
This is one of the best feel good videos on YT right now. Love from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Noiceeee
Wow they even sound like giants
Omgg!!!! Eric just killed it on here !!!!!
Real life thor
Leave it to Eric to be the one to out do the boys in the strong man workout 💪🏼 👀
Prank calling with his voice must be so fun
Haahaaaahhhahah = with deep voice
🙌🏻🤍
"I'm 70 kilos" "That's cute ennet"
so Eric is the strongest YES THEORY member . This video was awesome
Why is nobody talking about Eric picking up the 200 kilos thingy??!!! Did he even pick it up???
Also, hi Eric
What is the string music in the beginning of the video?
2 grown men... naked... in the same bed.....seems pretty gay to me
Their personalities don't match their body builds, especially Tom, such a lovely guy.
This video was way more wholesome than I expected. Also, fkn TOMMY & ERIC. Beast mode!
5:00 When he said "yeah buddy" i lost it hahahha
More videos with them!!!!!  My favorite video !
Another good video and story
Thomas looks so cute sitting between them 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Glasgow screen was Oban and  not actually in glasgow
Yeay Eric! 😆 Luke is such a good brother! This video is amazing, thanks yes fam!
Love these guys!
That was awesome
What a video, great job guys, as always the inspiration is out of this world 🌎 👏 🙌 ❤
I read the video title and thought you spent a day with the Bloatlord.
"i think you guys lost" at the end was hilarious
Goshh..Their voice is enough to tell me they are strong.. single punch from them can send me to one year coma..
My thumbs are way bigger than yours 😂😂😂😂😂
This video was so great! I love the way you guys story tell!
Their voices can lift more than me
i want to be bestfriends with tom!!!! he seems like the sweetest human being to ever exist 🥺❤
As a 5’ 2” female this is my new aspiration.
Easily one of the best videos you guys have made so far. You really put a big smile on my face. Thank you!
jeez do they lift weights with their vocal cords too?
And I love luke ❣️
Eric is so strong! Pretty impressive strength you got there,I'm in awe right now!
و هما بياكلوا في 6:10 افتركت التجربة الدنماركية جدا عادل امام  هو وعياله 😁
First world problem, "we must eat so much..."
their voices suite for a supervillain character 🔥
Hi yeses my aim in life is to join yes theory official 😇Thank u
I needed the laughs!  Great video.  Love the Stoltman brothers!
The brothers are just so sweet
Brilliant video 👏🏻
the hide and seek is hilarious 😂
What a collab
These guys sound just like I was expecting lol
what a beautiful brotherly bond. love all of you guys. blessings.
"The Scotland Highlands"? - The Scottish Highlands
DID I HEAR THAT CORRECT?!? 20:33
His story made me tear up and then I watched the final portion of the video where you guys competed with the biggest grin on my face. It was a rollercoaster. Thanks.
This is how historically accurate Thor would look like.
This is the most under-subscribe channel I could think of.
Really nice to see this amazing sport gain more traction
This was freaking great
Did Thomas just say egg-ercise
Niceeeeee
It's weird how the two strongest men can be the kindest people in the people in the world and others can't be like them
Me: just watched worlds worst diet yes theory vid.  This vid:. “10,000 calories a day” shoulda got Ammar up in this bitch
This is sooooo fun .  Laugh so hard when Eric says he farted 🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂 Thumbnail pic is hilarious
The thumbnail looks like Zack and Jay on steroids
Nice
This is one of the best wholesome episode of yes theory I have seen in a long time. 😭😭
That's a totally enjoyable well made video!  How amazing are these 2 guys and what an accomplishments they made! They are true inspirations!  They are true Gentle Giants!
love the content, keep it up
"PLOPP" 😂😂 when he was diving 😂😂
"Giga chad" does not begin to encompass their power
Let's bring those benches boys 🤣
I'm a poor man I made this channel to help my family👨‍👨‍👧‍👦🙏🌹💓❤
Disclaimer: This Channel is Extremely Addictive bcoz their Sense of humor is on next level ♥️
they are so kind and lovely! you wouldn't think that when you first see them
yup he definitely kratos cousin or smth
Love how kindhearted the brothers are!!!
Amazing video, hope you had a great time in Scotland!!
WHO Never miss even a single vlog of YES THEORY.  YOU GUYS make so many smiles on face . May God bless you guys always 🙏❤
20:43 We know how that would end in Squid Game  O_O
It’s always the biggest men who are the nicest :)
9:54 "That's cute, innit?"  MADE ME BURST OUT OF LAUGHTER
Talking about giants you guys should come over to Northern Ireland to see the giants causeway and our other giant landscapes
This was an awesome watch as usual. absolutely loved it. Thanks for brightening my day.
I started watching YES THEORY couple of months ago and now I love it and it’s my favourite channel on YouTube. I wish that you should keep doing this and may all your wishes be fulfilled. All the best !!!  Yes theory if you read this, please do reply
Am I the only one who found the Stoltman brothers adorable AF
Which one stronger, them or Olympics athletes?
These brothers are so genuinely wholesome.
Always loved these dudes. Glad to see them end up on Yes Theory!
18:32 IM ROLLIN’ 😂🤣😭
The little plop sound effect when Eric dove underwater killed me 😂😂😂
🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭babbbbbyyy I got goosebumps 🌈❤️🌈❤️🌈❤️🌈❤️
Good video
The Stoltman Brothers are such a beautiful kind of people! I wish them all the best in life!
The water drop sound was a true comedy genius addition.
Yes theory lost the squid games
please spend a day with Eddie Hall
Damn. What a good video

Eric got those russian muscles
Anyone else kept thinking that they might drop the weights on their foot anytime
What a great story! Truly inspiring!
anyone else screamed FOR TOMMY on his second try?! 🤣
Imaging eating 12 eggs every morning
They're also the Happiest Man on Earth. ❤
I wonder if the"other parts" of their bodies are equally big. Like, omg
Yes Theory were in Scotland and I didn't know??! Fuck, I'm from Edinburgh 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
NO WAY. Your videos are always so unique and cool. If I had unlimited guesses on what video you might do next and get a million dollars if was right I would’ve left with nothing. Love you, Yes Theory♥️
The guys: i can't lift this stuff Eric: fine I'll do it myself
Me: *doing my lesson plan*  Yes theory: *new video after 3 weeks*  Me: alright bye I will finish my lesson plan tomorrow 🤣🤣
Can anyone see that “brazzers” logo on the bottom left?

Here are my 10 extra tips to INCREASE your daily manifestations that I’ve learned over the years..👇🏾   1. Practice gratitude every morning. When you wake up, list everything that you are grateful for and feel that gratitude in your core. Feel free to write things down in a journal so it is easy for you to remember. 2. Replace your negative thoughts with positive ones. Every time you feel a negative thought coming on, make a positive spin on it right away. 3. Take ownership for things that happen in your life. It's easy to blame others however you will feel much better when you realize that most issues stem from us. 4. ALWAYS believe that good things are about to happen. By being open to new possibilities you are inviting abundance into your life. 5. Remember that like attracts like so you get back whatever you put out, whether it is good or bad. So do good AND received good. 6. Meditate for five minutes a day. During this time focus on how you want your life to be; but place your focus on how you feel AND feel that feeling as if you have already accomplished those goals. 7. Step outside of your comfort zone. Stop playing it safe and make that decision to finally go for your dreams. 8. Focus on activities that make you feel truly happy. When you are truly happy you have the best vibrational frequency to manifest your desires. 9. Avoid the naysayers and surround yourself with people who only lift you higher. Downers will be downers, don't let them drag you into their misery. 10. Don't be afraid to dream and know that you are always supported by the universe.   Hope this helps!  - Your Friendly Neighborhood Coach ❤
Buzzfeedguy is now Yes-theory guy :0
Not gonna lie the nordic track seems hella cool but maybe in another life when I become rich.
The advertising in-between is genius
Thomas... Hear me out, you should offer a random stranger a job with YES Theory... that stranger is me...
I am so glad this collab is a thing
me being 5.1
SCOTLAND my dream country !  can you invite me to there ????? i am ethiopian...please?
Imagine they slap you😥😳
I thought you meant a real giant like OLIVIER RICHTERS, maybe it's nice to meet up with him, he's a real friendly (old) neighbour. He's starting to get famous also in Hollywood:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIWH7Ilbxfo
That intro is fire, your storytelling is beyond YouTube, this should be in theaters.
Their presence alone could crush my skull
Please go to mount Athos))
BTW: Bagpipes are one of the coolest instruments ever!
Awesome vid :D
never thought id see a video like this from yes theory, amazing. you should spend time with bodybuilders too
Thomas just looks like he's sat in a small corridor between those 2 giants at the dinner table. 🤣
Why is this amazing

Just 5 bros having breakfast. How wholesome

Nephilim hybrids.
It's always a GREAT day when Yes Theory posts a new video!
6:50 It looks soooo hilarious. They Look soooo BIG AND HUGE compared to Thomas and the Team haha. Great Video.

The Stoltmen brothers are incredible, absolutely love them.  What a brilliant video!
Even the laugh is a laugh of a giant!
I saw the Stoltmans invitation comment and I'm so glad you took them up on it!

Their voices are also "strong" lmao
💪💪💪💪💪
You guys should go to Alaska
they're not giants, you're only small🙃 JK✌️ anyways, their voice is so😍
Hey Yes Theory gang! Since y'all are in Europe, y'all should cycle across the Netherlands! 🚲🇳🇱  It's not too difficult with the wonderful bike infrastructure and flat terrain, plus it'd be a super rewarding, unexpected, and personable adventure. Not to mention that "We Cycled Across a Country 😱" thumbnail would be dope! Much love from an American student in the Netherlands ❤
Yessir
Stoltman genetics are special man
Today and everyday is day 1!  ❤😊❤

One is caught up playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self🎈
