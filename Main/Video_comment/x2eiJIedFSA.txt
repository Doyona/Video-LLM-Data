The formulas speak for themselves but if you haven’t tried them I will give you a hint OK. This will slay your entire look, you don’t even have to try babe, these lay down and stay down perfectly on the lips all night long, including a long boring day in the office babe. You NEED THEM
The perfect thing about every single one of these lips is that you can transform ANY shade into the perfect shade using his greys and blue lips, but not only that they are exquisite on their own, and I am SO IN LOVE. Shocking not to see so many more artists transforming their lips into the perfect juicy shade using these, EVERY PRO KIT NEEDS THIS ENTIRE COLLECTION. These are not only good for every artist but the  every day girlie will be transformed into the perfect Barbie lip using these (from nudes all the way to BLACK honey). This is better than Mac. Sorry not sorry. THANK YOU JEFFREE. You know what the people want and you SERVE
🪻🪻🪻🪻🪻💜❤️🌹
Please bring these back in stock!! 😭😭 Especially these shades: Diet Mannequin, Celebrity Skin OG, Nudist Colony, Naked Body, Funeral Parlour, Malibu Beach House 💖🩷🥺🙏🏼
this is the most Scorpio thing I’ve ever seen
These are beautiful! I didn't know they are magnetic. I got away from makeup for a while but I'm back and I can't believe he has these for $2 in the current sale! I got two and some four of every shade in stock! I'm grieving that RedRum was sold out when I found out about the sale but I will get her eventually. 🩷
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Holy fashion and jawbreaker are really them girls 😅❤ love themmm!!! And the periwinkle f proof mascara omfg love it!!!❤
I love that Jeffree star cosmetics uses male and female models. There is still quite a few companies that are only marketing to women
Jeffre look at all your haters, I hope, the millions upon millions of dollars in your bank is the same shade of green as these envious losers 😂
LOVE
Love
I have one color, entrapment … and I can literally smell it as I lie in bed watching this vid for the first time in jan 23. Omg! The packaging is everything.
Velvet Trap is fab. Yum.

FATAL ERROR!…AS YOU SAY INSANE!… Definition: in a state of mind which prevents normal perception, behavior, or social interaction; seriously mentally ill. "he had gone insane" Jeffree being the YOUTUBER of the century, I think asking for a gun can hurt your popularity.  And this even if it is the most beautiful Beretta. It can inspire teens and your fans to do more… Here in Canada, firearms are prohibited. I sincerely believe that there is a certain limit that should not be exceeded.  Yes, I understand that this luxury item may be for your safety but it is not a toy.  Having a bodyguard would be nice, but showing your gun, in my opinion, is beyond comprehension.  I hope your fans don't think like me...Not a good move for your image!…  ERREUR FATALE!… Come tu le for si bien INSANE definition@(dans un état d'esprit qui empêche une perception, un comportement ou une interaction sociale normaux ;  gravement malade mentalement.  "il était devenu fou" Jeffree étant le YOUTUBER du siècle, je crois que le fait d’exiger un pistolet peut nuire à y’a popularité. Et ce même si c’est le plus beau des Beretta.  Ceci peut influencer les adolescents et tes fans à en faire de suite…  Ici au Canada les armes à feu sont prohibées.  Je crois qu’il y a une certaine limite qu’il ne faut pas dépasser. Oui je comprends que cet objet de luxe puisse être pour ta sécurité mais ça n’est pas un jouet. Que tu aie un bodyguard serait convenable mais afficher ton arme à feu selon mon avis ça dépasse l’entendement. Souhaitons que tes fans ne pensent pas comme moi…
@Landen Wiggins jds?
What I love most about this brand is that Jeffree is a connoisseur and his experience  helps and guides our choices in the cosmetic field thanks Jeffree kiss beautiful love❤
Minute of nudisti colony?
Those nails r amazing ahhh
How do you think jeffree decides which lipstick from with collection he should wear when going out?
I love the purple one
Hi jeffree star
Wonderful
Great video 🎀🎉🎊🎁💌
Since my work let go of the mask mandate for vaccinated people 🦕🧚‍♀️ ima jus start wearing my lipsticks again
These lipsticks are the best I've used, hands down.
I am in love with the red
Can we get androgyny- my go to color!
I love my mystery box I was so excited with everything I got
can confirm - this formula is shit
THE MODELS, AND ALSO JEFFREE IS SO FREAKING BEAUTIFUL
Am I the only one who is turned off by how far the camera is away? It's very unpleasing to watch...
Love love love💖💖💖💖
How stunning is Jeffree 🥰
Oh my god that pink lip color is to die for.
No burgundy/berry?! What??!
Im surprised the Vegans never flooded this comment section .. with all your makeup being vegan friendly and animal cruelty free and here ya are, using bear traps .. mouse traps..cheese... hahaha the Veggies and Vegans missed opportunity!
How many times she said “Woohh”
And in New South Wales, Australia, we are all out at work etc. We still need and very much appreciate Jefree's LIPSTICKS
I bought Nudist Colony....PERFECTION. Love the formula, love the magnetic closure. Love it. Thanks so much Jeffree
Money wont buy u happiness honey and nor does u will find happines in deleting negative comments to make it positive it just wont work negativity is gonna come cuz as i said money cant buy happiness hunny
Can anyone help plz .. at the end of the shoot video where it shows their heads in boxes the very last model is a guy and his lipstick is smudged around his mouth - would you say that’s ‘fire starter’ he’s wearing ? Looks to bright for perfect red and too orange for the watermelon but I’m not 100% sure agh!  Thanks in advance to whoever knows the answer 😘
Oh my God, his nails. In love. Such a pretty color!
The trap moment design it's really reminds me BLACKPINK kill this love it's really cute❤
*8:57** I'm a red lipstick fan but I want that Lipstick*
Omg your awesome!!! 👏👏👏❤️👍🏼
Makeup SCARED me until I watched his video "how I did my makeup in highschool"....I realized that it's not that scary and has come a LONG way since 1999!!! I have taken chances with elf products and WOW! I  get "WOW's" now 😜🌹
Can we use it on surgical masks too, otherwise it's just a waste of money.
https://youtu.be/s_zID2OP8z4
these lipsticks feel like tape on ur lips, like a weird lip balm. Nudist Colony is the better one but theyre overpriced for how poorly pigmented they are and apply lighter than what they look like on the tube. Good thing is the color lasts, bad thing is it takes 10 swipes to build it up on the lips
imagine only hating Jeffree only cause of what the " media " says , little snowflakes 🥺👉👈
Hmm idk how I feel about the packaging. I think I would've preferred a rose gold metal, chrome, whatever bullet with (maybe) a matte J☆ logo.  P.S: To each their own, this is just my preference.
Anyone seeing the resemblance to Lisa Eldridge’s Velvet Lipsticks?
I'm so confused his new pallets like every new one and the videos he did in his new house I confused where this is in his house or is he just somewhere like I'm so confused to someone help
My friend aunt works for you
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up dear ones. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of Fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏 .
I’m always so tempted to buy Jeffree’s make up omg and I rarely even wear make up
red hair suits you
That's a real quality packaging right there bish
Can we get a  moisturizing bullet formula im so over matte and liquid. Bullet lipstick, anything but matte, is what screams luxurious to me imho.  I still love these, just want a moisturizing option TOO
Ummm the first shade is my shadeeeeeeeee!! I been needing to replace my grey hippie but haven't found anything that I liked. I can't wait to try this one 😭😭😭😭💖
Why were the sounds of opening it so satisfying?! 😂❤️
wow
Pleaseeee review rare beauty makeup!!
Tati doesnt upload Shane doesnt upload jeffre: so lets just ignore the backlash say sorry and move on.
Sixnine ? 🙄🤔
hey love ur stuff but have u ever thought of maybe having eco friendly alternatives to some things?
jeffree bitch i love your content you are super funny, however recently you are turning into kylie keep your youtube page mostly fun content not commercials. we all know you are gonna create dope shit but i do not personally wear makeup man. you cannot sell it to me.
why do you look like a w*man? bruh
Thank you for being you! I have been in such a dark place I lost my job due to Covid lockdowns and binge watching your videos has been such a light for me! I can’t wait to one day be able to afford your makeup since becoming a mom I can’t remember the last time I was able to splurge on good makeup! It’s been probably 9 years! Your incredible tho thank you for getting me through this difficult time! 💗
Love you J.S ⭐💄⭐
I love the magnet idea, the lids are always coming off most lippies
I just ordered hot commodity can’t wait I love you jeffree😘😘😘
https://youtu.be/IdGWdWE7-k8
https://youtu.be/IdGWdWE7-k8
Amazing, excellent
I hate your intro! 🙄🙄
BRING BACK LIP AMMUNITION PACKAGING, PLEASE.
Hi good morning!!! How are you?   I’ve been trying to catch your attention for the longest time. I am in need of some help at this very moment. I am so behind on my bills & I have not bought any Christmas presents for my loved ones. I cant afford anything right now. This is has been hard for all of us but definitely harder for me. My husband had tested positive and didn’t go to work for 2 weeks which he did not get paid for. We are super behind. Anything helps please🥺✨🙏🏻🎄❤️ love you! Have a blessed day
mood
Boy
Comments are so hateful😑 I love him♥
This is SICKKKKK
There’s like no lipstick in that compared to other lipsticks
Why is a grown man, who knows his audience is mostly young girls, naming his products after sex and drugs, and calling everyone "baby"? Am I in the twilight zone?
I like how honest they are for using the real product unlike the other cosmetics there they do not use their brand on photoshoot
Hey Cool videos 💕💕 on my channel
0:28 the echo is killing me 😂😂😂 haunted house vibes
I would love to learn how to apply liner and lipsticks to accentuate my lips. I feel like I don’t look right wearing colors! How do you know what tones look good on you? I am obsessed with you amd  all of  your lip  colors and products!!! Thank you 😊
You really should not sit on your knees for these horrible thumbnails. Your legs are so short and skinny they look like they’ve atrophied and you don’t look like you’re even capable of standing up. It’s gross and confusing just like your horrible personality.
I love that everything is well thought, well concepted, like JS always go extra ✨
The REAL Jefree Star ! Watch this vid below  https://youtu.be/52LaP5_B6IQ WAKE UP PEOPLE JS is EVIL
Niiicce💋👄
Why does chocolate fondue look like shit on his hand?? I bet it looks prettier on the lips but like on his hand it looks like straight poop!
Jeffrey's  star totally  sister snatched rupaul
OMG love your makeup I use it everyday and I absolutely love the lipstick ❤️
ooommmgggg that red 😍😍
Those pics are gorgeous tho
Its not one swipe dfq pricey and the formula is not that great.
jeffree´s eyebrows %0
´´bitch theyre are not jeffree star´´ that killed me
Jeffree's team of technical please fix the echo in the videos. Sounds buffering is important for a nice soft sound of Jeffree's voice. Thanks. Love
UNFAZED IS TO DIE FOR 🥵👄😍😍😍😍
so... this basically bit off lisa eldridge's velvet collections, except tackier?
Hot commodity,fast persuader jamirokwayy. Fuck me I'm famous university 2008
If only I had 300 dollars hehe
OKAY! I'm buying some lipsticks!
Velvet reminds me of Lisa.
We want to open a store in Pakistan jefferee
Ordered two
Man I wish I could afford his blood money palette! Thats gotta be the best green palette out. Fingers crossed it goes on sale!
Lmfao he’s in a trap that’s funny
The echo in the background is like, such a metaphor
So he copied Lisa Eldrige’s texture of the lipstick in the tube?
killing it with those dark lips!! ❤ ❤ ❤ LOVE ya jeffree can't wait to see whats next
No
This is so glamorous we love it !
Theif
He has basically copied Lisa Eldridges formula. #disgusting
FLOP
Sorry  this is completely off subject however I would love to see a make-up / cooking video with Kaleb from Wyse Guide. https://www.facebook.com/WyseGuide/ Perhaps after covid 🤷🏾‍♂️ I think you two are great & it would be a very fun video, lol America needs it 🤣
NO THANK YOU.  KEEP IT FOR YOUR SELF TOGETHER WITH THE BLOOD MONEY PALLET.
Didn't realise i'd subscribed to QVC
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzWZvo42VhocWA79QENkogg?view_as=subscriber
thank  you  for  making this!! esp in the  colours : D
Yassssssss QUEEENN 👑
I love my lip ammunition, can’t wait to try the new formula. Congrats Jeffree!
U weirdo
I never received my halloween mystery box along with ANOTHER package even though USPS stated it was delivered along with JSC. I hate having to be so negative because I love this company but its hard to remain unbiased when the company refuses to refund me as is stated in JSC company policies. I need help! Im out $350 and I am a broke college student! I need help! Please!!
Aren’t these exactly the same as doll beauty lipsticks?
Drill sergeant should have been named prison ink.
Also curious why do many nobodies in here give a fuck about how he lives his life. Like he’s doing better than everyone that is talking shit just living his life while y’all sitting here spending all your time and effort digging dirt on someone that doesn’t even know you exist outside of being a number in his followers. People are stupid stupid. He doesn’t feed fuck or finance any of y’all so stay out of his business. It’s so sad that some people are so miserable instead of living their own life they spend the time worrying about someone else’s life. It’s beyond sad. Be entertained and follow and like him for videos and if that’s not why your on his page why not jus leave. Why is there such a need to dig into peoples lives when did it become cool to stalk someone to find out all the bad shit about them. Go be a PI and get paid to do it instead of being petty and living your life to try to hurt someone else. Y’all wouldn’t want all this negativity and shade thrown y’all’s way but here you are making judgements on a person you have never and probably will never meet its gross
Can you make a house update video?
Someday I'll be able to purchase jsc product🙏🙏🙏
ok im confused in to invested with james charles so what did jefrree do to make people hate him???
Say whatever you want about jeffree, but he's changed make up and will always continue to change makeup for the better
Late but here
1 word Jeffree! WOW 💄❤️🌹🐕🤩
Wth that huge a@@ trap is cracking me up... hmm does it work? Could use one of those on my front lawn. 😂 it’s a joke fbi/cia whoever it is that cyber stalks social media sites. LOL 😂 it’s a joke. Well kinda ...no it is really...sort of. 😂 I want that trap! Lol
it would be cool to see not just the ideal body type, but more plus size models :)
Disgustingly dumb
I wish you would make a cannabis infused lipstick or lipgloss I’d so buy it ❤️❤️❤️
1:25 So funny
1:25 So funny
Happy birthday Jeffree 🥳🎂
Happy birthday

So daring to show off his private part. https://youtu.be/1IqN4kdoTCo
Those nails ✨💅✨

I dare you to and today is my brothers birthday
Love your nails!! I'm obsessed with them!!!!
Sorry
Your nails are life!
Jefffreeeeeeee please i wanna buy the blue freezeeee scrubbbbbbb please please please restock ittttt please
He can sit like that for so long because he doesn't have a pulse.      That's all.
I really aren't a fan of Jeffree anymore, but his products are AMAZING!
Jefree love your new line and love u..Wish one day I can meet u
🙏✝️🕉✡️🥰
Omg I soooo want the watermelon soda, honey suck me, the perfect red, and the nudist colony for Christmas
I don’t know of another person who would be so successful and so noble. No matter how good you are, you don’t forget to help other people. You are amazing Jeffree 💜  I try to help too. My goal is to help preterm birth babies and their families. If there are people willing to contribute: https://gogetfunding.com/help-for-preterm-birth-babies/  Thank you very much for everyone who contribute💜
These days I feel you only post videos to promote your makeup lines. I used to enjoy watching your videos when you would test out other makeup brands, videos about general things. Don’t forget it’s your fans/supporters who have got you where you are today xx
I am fully prepared for Naked Body to be sold out everytime I try to purchase. It's SICK.
Black pink in your areaaaaa
This was so not personal and far a way and manufactured ! I miss the old jeffeee reveal videos I used to be so excitex
Ummmm didn’t lisa Eldridge make these? This is an exact copy of her idea. Why are you acting like you did something no ones ever done before?
anyone know who that one male model is @ the 5:51 mark, with the chest tattoo? he's fine!
Jeffree have you ever thought about using chunky girls in your ads?? Reaching out and showing chunky girls wearing your makeup and how beautiful they are to. You could totally reach another whole set of ladies and gentlemen.
You look so so beautiful today.
This set is so fucking sexy
We’re can I buy that red nail polish? It’s so different?
why tf does it look like they are made out of connect sand? lol
I didnt know i needed a new lipstick but i have to get one to try the velvet formula
If his products make me look stunning the i don't give a f who he is I just want the cosmetic
Jeffreee plzzzz adopt me!!!!💝🐍
I got my mine yesterday and honestly I can't wait to try and do review!
My name is Jannat i am from Pakistan i love look and u are very beautiful
Js:You only need to swipe it once *proceeds to swipe it five times*  🤔🤔🤔😳😳😳🙄🙄🙄
Omg did you borrow this from blackpink? 😂 I love it
Y do u have to scream after every 3 words 😂
Jeffree...read the room sweetie. We’re all wearing masks.
Love you hunny! xoxo
watch out... its a trap
Bullet? It looks like a tampon.
we ain’t forget😒
Eh, I'll buy another NYX velvet lipstick
https://youtu.be/BuAzj7mcwTI
I just now noticed that you don't have eyebrows
how relatable, not!!! nor gagging
So this channel is now only for promotion.
I really wish the liquid lip Sagittarius would come back!! That was one of my favs!!
I need the lippy holders 😭😭
Ohh noo!!!!!! I need every shade 😭😭
We wont be able to purchase lip amo on a sale price? Lol
To far back I need close and personal
Ok but Unicorn Blood... as an eyeshadow shade. 👀👀
I don’t understand lip products coming out when we’re all wearing masks
I'm so bored with the debuts. Something is missing. Feels forced.
This man still gotta make money...but what is special about it and him
I'm getting major KKW vibes from this but edgier(not a bad thing!) I love the set and the packaging for the product as well. As a photography student I am SO HAPPY that there were little snippets from the photoshoot so I could observe what equipment they used. Cuuuute
Well this is lowkey transphobic
Why Jess Glynne is there? LOL. 6:40
He's such a horrible person -- dont buy anything he sells!!
hello hate comments, comment on drama channnel/video we still support him!, I get it we all have different opinions but if your just gonna come here and laugh and wonder why their is no hate comment please stop so of us is still enjoying his vids its just that some of you call him with names true or not we came here to enjoy this video no hate just people that support him opinions
Late to the party what I miss
People saying “omg he’s putting out lipsticks during covid when we should be wearing masks.” I literally NEVER wear makeup in public unless it’s a special occasion because I just don’t feel like it. I really only ever do makeup in my house to take pictures and post on Instagram, as are most people right now. You do realize a lot of people make their living by doing makeup and posting it on the internet right? They aren’t going out in it 😂
Why not keep both formulas? That way whoever wants and loves the original formula can get it still and whoever loves the velvet gets that one.. everyone loves different things and has different preferences
I don't think "velvet trap" means what he says it means.
who just saw miss lynn updated his profile pic!!! work
You only post to sell things😢 I miss when you used to post videos of trying makeup brands and products feels like I’m just watching commercials at this point 😢
hunny why are u acting like nothing happened....
jeffreestar review nikitaXmorphe in ur next vid   lik3 this if u want js to review nikitaXmorphe
The setting looked just like blackpink “let’s kill this love” mv
Sorry. Haven’t bought one lipstick since 😷 Covid and the masks. It’s all about eyes now.
These are trash! also have to say that once again, he only drops a video right before he launches. You let the money go to your head hon! hate to say it. Just be real dude! say that you're just out for money and you don't care about review makeup
I KNOW jeffree is the king of DRAMA, BUT you cannot knock him for how hard he works.....just sayin!   *ALL DRAMA/TEA/SCANDALS ASIDE, KUDOS ON UR NEW CAMPAIGN JEFFREE!*
Oh that sound quality :(
Why is the no new video before the makeup brand video product thing
Tbh who the F gonna buy it ? 😏
When are u coming back to youtube jeffree? I cant trust anyone elses opinion cuz theyre fake n full of bullshit selfish drama... right now its literally just you and shane and manny and only 1 is putting out content. We need you 😭💜
lmao time to unsubscribe
Plz upload frequently
I just want a tiny bit of his money during this PLANdemic 😔  could you imagine he's fucking awesome
I usually love JSC! I was a little sad about this releases' formula 🥺
One make up launch and y'all are ready to pretend like he isn't problematic 😬 y'all really can't do better, huh?
When are we getting another tattoo diaries?? I’m dying for a new episode!!!!
Honestly I miss the old Jeffrey Star videos and the old Jeffrey to
He only comes on here when he wants to sell something
Whats is this   IT???   Hahhahaha. This IT is UGLY..hahaha
I need all of them.
So the only time he posts a video it’s either to sell us something or to flex! So glad I’m not subscribed anymore! I just don’t get why this is still coming up in my recommended list! YouTube algorithm SUUUCKS!
To those people who destroy their jefree star make up because of what he did, I’m not bitch that shit was expensive and it’s still good
aren’t you like... cancelled?
I made a review video on my channel of one of his pallets! Please go check it out and subscribe 💓✨

Hey hun I’m doing door dash and car just messed up.. I have three kids and trying to make ends work with taking care of my mother as well. Could really use your help thank you $sarasisler
Just saying.. when you were at your desk instead of picking rando spots in the mansion, you were more relatable. I have been looking everywhere for a velvet trap to sit in to watch your video.. but you have the only one.  I cant relate.
You can say what you want about Jeffree but his brand is always quality and has always been inclusive since the beginning. All the models of color he’s used in his campaigns and even his brand being vegan are all in an effort to be inclusive. We can’t change the past and shouldn’t condemn someone for doing something wrong that they’ve addressed and apologized for multiple times and have taken steps to become a better person. Jeffree Star now is a million times different from where he started on MySpace and in those Sharolaid videos.
Jeffree, you probably won’t see this lmao. But please make a video on Friday 13th Nov, it’s my 21st birthday and I’ll be spending it alone now because of lockdown (I’m in the uk)/covid :( would make my whole year x
This is who y’all stan??? Yikes...
Rocky Horror Picture Show in Pink
BOOOOOO!! JAMES CHARLES IS BETTER!!!
Oh, I’m so traumatized....It makes me want to cry...YOU DUMB B!TCH I LOVED YOU I LOVED YOU I LOVED YOU it’s true....I wanted to be you and do what you do..! I lived here, I loved here.... I BOUGHT IT, IT’S True.. I’m so embarrassed... I feel abused...
https://youtu.be/5Xsn0LE4TBM
Hi Jeffree, I’m sure you probably won’t see my message but I am at my wits end. My father, my best friend passed away. He was only 39 and didn’t have life insurance. I’m currently 19 years old in nursing school working at a bar. His funeral was around $12,000 and now I’m in a lot of debt. I’m not sure if you would even care to help out. But I’m really struggling here
I literally thought the boxes were some kind of glory holes. Classy.
I'm gonna throw up rn.
hello how are ya
Your canceled
I came here to read the tea....where it at? 😬 Yall switch up FASTTT. I ain't NEVA forgot
@jeffreestar I am BIG fan! ❤️ Please make a special make up line for Brides! I would love to use some of your products on my special day in July 2022. Keep up the good work Queen!
Call my mom has stuffy old Jeffree Star kittens I just wanted to tell you myself I don't think she was ready to tell you and she's your biggest fan all times okay got it all your videos everyday when they come out that you make
How have I always watched but was not subbed!!! Now I am! And made. a new Twitter so following there too.
Whats good about an animal trap that causes pain, torture and a long cruel death to promote a product?
I love the many colours 😍😍
Over the top ... not only make up but decoration dress hair ... looks like a cartoon..
When is emo jeffree coming back ):
You should do a video where u cover up all your tattoos with a foundation or something. Called *REMOVING ALL MY TATTOOS?!*
jeffree: *gets cancelled* ok time to release a new makeup line no offense
love the makeup and room
So anyway did you hear James got on vouge
Hello Jeffrey Star. I just watched a documentary of Mica. Where do you get your mica from? I just saw children going in caves to dig for Mica and get paid .25 a day in India. India is the biggest distributor of Mica.  I love your makeup and with how blinding it is you use Mica.
Whoa 😲 these comments show you that echo chambers are a real thing.
Is he in a bear trap?!
Jeffree star showing pink tampons for 16 minutes straight.
The trap looks like black pink kill this luv mv trap
Beautiful
Still nothing I’m unsubscribed go
who is here just to see if he is  still posts.....
Jeffree: releases lipstick  Pandemic: masks bitch
And I won’t be buying anymore of you makeup I think I’ll go with James
I hate your for what you did to James you are in your 30’s he was 19years old he handle the situation and was so mature about it and you was so rude and mean to him not knowing you were lieing i am so disappointed ☹️ in you I know I’m watch the videos a year later but  that still is not cool I think you should say sorry to James I can’t believe you lied on him a then tried to talk to him again I’m so disappointed ☹️ in you
:)
placed my order because of this video. looking forward to the package
sorry but the trap reminds me of Kill this love (bp)
You are such a gross person, nathan probably left because he realized how nasty you really are.
i came here for the hate comments but there are literally none
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
ok mis horseface
Iloveyou jeffrey
Omg I'm loving your background
maybe he will actually leave forever this time
Is he gay?
Why do you keep trying to sell stuff whenever you get canceled you can’t expect for people to buy your stuff when you’ve been canceled for bad things

No one deserves to be this rich and not give back.  Stay humble people...you can't take none of this shit with you when you're dead.
The whole shoot was so lit! edit: loveee the lipstick shades.
WHAT you have a giant bear trap you are gonna die
Are u a girl
Hi, you should make nail polish too! 😁
hi Jeffree!!! Would you review Beauty Glazed make ups? it is kinda popular here in our country, and I want to know if I could get high quality make ups with cheaper price or not, sending lots of love, stay safe~
I closed YouTube off to do something and I got back to be called a bitch 1:16
jeffree been real quiet since larray made that cancelled song
Hmmmmmm let's address that I  have the same birthday as jeffrey star!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't know when I found out I was so shocked 😂😬
can we forget about what he did.... we need to forgive others!!! like we need to other creators
Jesus came to seek and save the lost. "By grace are ye saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast." Just wanna share some good news, I once was lost, seeking many worldly pleasures, constantly wondering if there was something greater, constantly wondering why I couldn't measure up to others or to God's standards, but the good news of the Gospel is that we can't measure up and we are all guilty of sin, but Jesus Christ came to this world as God manifest in the flesh, He came to His own (the Jews) but the Jews didn't receive their Creator, they rejected Him and had him crucified even though He was innocent, but it was prophesied that the Christ would have to suffer and be rejected for the sins of the world, He took our sin upon Himself so that if we are in Him, there is a great exchange: our sin for His Righteousness. He died on the cross and was buried in a tomb, on the third day He rose again and was seen of many witnesses, and is now at the right hand of the Father. Just simply want to share the good news by which I was saved, I'm not sharing this because I hate anyone, but because I was once lost, and now I care for the lost and want the lost to come to the saving faith that I also did.
Creepy ass handsome squidward looking dude
Your perfect prelude to eternity,,, it’s all you wanted it to be
Eres el mejor
The prop reminds me of Blackpinks Kill this love
Wow! BLOWN AWAY. Velvet trap looks in-sane😳😳😳💕💕
I’m so in love with these. Still tying to bond with unphased though lol. When are we gonna hear about the new collection? Been seeing some hints on Instagram
Anyone else feel like the mystery boxes sucked this year? Like a black lip balm who is even going to be able to wear that? It looks like trash on any color and on its own
Your next video should be you playing among us trust me it is so fun
Just got my DELUXE MYSTERY BOX. And it only has 4 fuckin items in it. 🤨WTF
Jesus loves you
No respect since no show of support for Shane
You should play among us
Jeff u look stunning ❤️
I wish I could wear makeup. My parents would kill me
Is this makeup site messing up for anyone else? It keeps saying “ A problem repeatedly occurred” every time I click on a color lipstick😔
You love brazil??
The deap red for my sister and your jawbreaker mirror for me with my bday money
I'm getting it
Yassssss
U SUCK
So, you posted a video two weeks ago to say you were coming back with more content and not just on here to sell stuff...just to post a day later your new collection and then now two weeks later....no new video still.  Do you realize how much of a hypocrite that makes you seem like?  I know my comment doesn't mean shit to you and holds no relevance, but I actually gave a shit about you as a youtuber and to see that you just posted to sell stuff (your velvet trap collection and halloween mystery boxes) and clearly don't care about posting content for your loyal subscribers, is a little disheartening.  Especially with all the trash talk that is going around about you....and seeing people declutter your palettes because they no longer want to support you....yet there's still people who continue to support you and you honestly give them no reason to support you.  Maybe that makes me a cu&% for saying it, but I honestly thought we'd have seen a video or two by now after your velvet trap release showing us that you actually give a crap about your subscribers.  Oh well.
Lol hes so annoying
lmao hi hisokaaaaaaaaa
*afghan hound*
I’m spidy man

Holy shit....is your career really dying? I didn't think it actually would but it seems like it really is crashing and burning day by day
I love it!! He is so fun and I can’t have enough! 😻😻🤩
Who did u vote for Jeff?
Do ur thing jeff but this is so useless now.
Imagine launching something and it has less views than a simple James Charles collab video 💀
I gained respect for Jef knowing he turned down 200$ thousand dollar Almost quarter million for a promotional video for sugar bear hair to support tati
His views really did drop. I can’t lie these lipsticks look good but kinda bad timing on the launch bc of COVID.
I need this for my music festivals
can you do a review about the new chiara ferragni x lancomé palette?
I love how he’s acting as if he ain’t it like 49 scandals   Edit; omg thanks for all the likes
I love all your makeup you do beautiful makeup you are makeup artist
Hey Jeffrey I don't know if you see this message or comment whatever you called LOL I was just going to tell you that you should make eyeshadow brushes with eyeshadow already on inside the brushes that ways eyeshadow will be on the eyes would be a good idea
I just came here to put a DISLIKE tehee.
The era of jeffree star is ending
Not ya supporting him in the commetns
Any body in Pa NOT get their box yet?? 😔
Lipsticks are out of business bcz of Masks
WoOoOf
I would give a left kidney to meet you...I adore you and I'm so happy for all your success...I look at you and think so many times I wanted to give up... (I'm in a horrible marriage)...feeling stuck and hopeless ..and I watch you and feel happy.... ty xoxoxox
Yooo this Halloween costume is lit
It’s could be fake about what I said sorry
So I do like jeffry star but he said n and Larry and James is way better bye ✌️ ❤️❤️ sorry if I made u angry or sad
-gay-
mmm I dont see you mentioning chrissy anymore!! she got smart and opened her own business after you all used her.. I used to love the products you have but money is changing you more and more. Go buy something from her https://retail.totallifechanges.com/chrissyglamm
I'm not into lipsticks, more of a matte liquid lip gal, but I'm going to try this formula, it looks really nice and silky! ❤ Beautiful colors, good job yet again Jeffree! ❤
Ok so I ordered 2 shades and I’m sad to say, Velvet Trap is not it! The coverage isn’t great and I personally don’t like the finish. VLL forever!
I’m waiting for your next video 🧐
Jeffree will you make a lipstick for men that we can wear every day to work?  I would buy it.
wtf??!! you are being FAKE..... Just be real. just be you...no apologies!!!! . I absolutely loved you when you were the real you!!!! I do not like the persona you are  portraying!!!
Jeffrey hope all is well!
How does he still have a channel? 😂
Hi Jeffree I Love Your New lipstick  Collection They Are Just Beautiful And I Will Be Buying That Very soon 😘❤️
Saving my money for some of these n the holiday set....can't wait to see what it is
Imagine coming out with makeup while some of your fans make have lost their jobs and and their home and have no money due to covid and we are wearing mask and you think it’s a good idea to come out with a bunch of makeup that some can’t afford -
The bear trap reminds me of blackpinks kill this love bear trap scene
I cannot believe....I cannot believe that I looked up to Jeffree Star, Shane Dawson. Cryaotic, Trish, Tati, Onision, Leafy....like these were all youtubers I've wasted so much time on.  I haven't spent a dime on any of his products, even though I wanted to, but I wasted my entire childhood looking up to you and the only thing you guys prioritize is money. Despite how you've inflicted pain on people of color, those in your own community, and women. You hang around people who've had allegations against them. I beg you to do better, the child that used to look up to you begs you to do better, people who used to adore you want to be able to love you again, but all we see is someone who's money ridden. Goodbye Jeffrey.
My bank account is shrinking with every swatch.
Shut the Trap on Him ☺
I miss the old Jeffree before Dramageddon 2.0 :-(
Ok.. I really don’t like jeffree but I’m actually super tempted to buy one
Jeffree, there are people dying
Lisa did it first, lisa did it better, lisa did it classier.
No
so how do you feel about your makeup being found at tj max😝
we ain’t forget
Come on jeffree I wish you would come back to YouTube !!! I’ve been a fan from nearly day one ☝️ I was hoping it was just a thing but it’s been months and months
Retired???!!!! Nooooooooo
When your so rich you can casually sit on a large bear trap and talk about lipstick.
Not you uploading again like nothing even happened 💀
I just received my order, of The Shades "Watermelon Soda" and "Funeral Parlor", I LOVE THEM, Both The Formula and the Colors.  I can hardly wait to order "Honey Suck Me" and "Fire Starter"!  I also ordered The Deluxe Mystery Box, and in it I got, The "Red Rum" Velour Lip Liner, I LOVE IT TOO!  I am ordering the shade "Christmas Cookie" Next!  LOVE YOU!  Thank You, for The Perfection, of what you do!
Hmm Jefree.. can you do the one dip challenge?🥺😊
Those nails are hottttttttt!!!!!.......big up.....💕
WE know that you are busy. But we miss you!!! Jeffree, CONTENT please. We know you are busy but we NEED them videos!!!!  Again, WE DAMN MISS YOU!!
✨Just posted a video unboxing the  two larger mystery boxes!!!✨definitely worth the money 🥳
giiirl just make a full green collection and ill sell my soul
If I remember you got 19M subscribers but now you have 17M? Haha you’re going down
When James Charles got a 10Million views in one day 😂
What is that red nail color?
Cant believe people still subscribe and watch this monster
Video update?
How many people looking forward to hearing all the big ‘tubers talk about #saveeuginia ????
Copying Lisa Eldridge
I would like to PROUDLY declare that i have NEVER been a fan of this person. *yee yee*
I don’t care what anybody says, I love his products, amazing quality at an amazing price. Compare his beautiful makeup to all the other wack brands out there , there’s no comparison.
what happen to shane
He's paying a fortune for his PR team to clean up his mess
What makes this dude think a mask wearing society needs LIPSTICK right now??? Eye shadow would have been an obvious launch but whatever
https://youtu.be/222SK-kzAzk
Go away don't care
I will never understand how people STILL support him
i dressed up as jeffree today 😁❤️ a lot of kids screamed in my face :/ idk why
Quiero decirle que tengo un gran admiración por usted su collection es hermosa bella espero un di poder comparar le envío micos besos y abrazo
You collection is beautiful you are gorgeous Love you
The velvet lipsticks idea was first the celebrity makeup artist Lisa Eldridge’s to my knowledge. Unless it was done by someone before.  Are we now stealing ideas miss Jeffree ??? She was also smart enough to release them when we weren’t all wearing masks 24/7 😷  But for anyone that still wears lipstick and is into velvet looking lipsticks you can buy some from Lisa instead of this man !
Wheres the Rare beauty review video?
the packaging of the lipstick looks like a small vibrator that is also a tampon.
I hope that trap closes on you
Why do you still have a platform we don’t like you stop posting and descend back into the shadows where you belong 😐
Tik tok made him10 times more toxic
Jeffree star is my Icon! I love his work and whatever drama posted in social media wont change how he loves to make products that brings out creativity! @jeffreestar I support you forever!
Moscow Russia,loves u
Trap remind me let's kill this love blackpink 😄
WTF? I don't understand how you are famous. Your mere presence makes my face hurt. Please stop with the make up. It's too much.
jeffre star says THE N WORD
wtf?? why do people still support him??
Isn't that the one which blackpink used for there mv?
This man is disturbing...
adopt me plz i will send you details me and my friends are abused  can you plz adopt us plzzz i want to run from slavery ur will be the best parent.
*stahp pls.. Nobody wants ya nasty, crusty lipsticks* >:[

Lovely as always Ms. Starr. Medieval was my favorite
"Jeffree Stars says Ni-"
if only that bear trap worked😔
https://youtu.be/x2eiJIedFSA
Legit just saw knock off Jeffree Star Velour Liquid Lipstick on Amazon. Not "Dragon Star" actually. It actually says "Jeffree Star" and one Liquid Lipstick is being sold for $26.98 and another for like $30 I hope you know this.
Do you think you could take any random person and make them Famous in 24 hours?
Just bought mine at TJ Maxx with some other discount j.star make up
Hmm the formula and concept is a direct rip off of Lisa Eldridge velvet lipsticks brought out 2 years ago
Omg! This will look so beautiful below my face mask that I have to wear everyday.......
Packaging: cheap as hell We: didn't ask for this He: should just stop
Well I went ahead and bought two lipsticks from this collection. Used one tonight and it broke in half needless to say I am a very unhappy person. Yes I have bought his products for my daughter before and this is the first time I got one for myself because I loved the color. Now the tube is a complete mess.
remember that time u said the n word lol
You are so ...
I Dont like the packaging tbh, it looks very juvenile
I for one would never buy anything from you
Hi I’m ready for a new Jeffrey Star YouTube video from you please
I dont think there's such a thing as perfe to red because different undertones work different for different skin tones
The old bullet looked better idk why your got rid of the chrome top
I unsubscribed from you after watching Larrays dis track and finding out you said the n word. I’m black and that’s nasty to say to someone.I’m disappointed in you 😞
Trump 2020 🇺🇸
first, i lov you jeffree. however, the image of the giant bear/animal trap really gives bad bad vibes to us animal lovers. i realize you would nev mean to offend and you are an animal lover. but this giant trap, it's an awful thought to me. all i can think of is poor wolves,bears, etc. whom chew their own foot off to try and get out!!!! sorry, hate it!
Omg jeffree you should make a nude pallete and name it “the pomeranians” and like put all the nude colors cuz that would be so iconic i heard nikkie said it in her cremate pallete review so im just commenting this and hoping jeffree replied or atleast notice this it would be so iconic to have a pallete about your dogs
So basically you recreated Lisa's velvet lipstick with some fancy theatrics....?

looks gorgeous xx
am i the only one here after listening to larrys song 👀
I want to see another vlog for updates for your fur babies 🥰🥰🥰❤️😍
Oh my God. I m scared to see this ....I don't conform that whats the are men or women 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
OMG SO BEAUTIFUL 😍😍😍😍😍 i see at least 10 that i would wear
One thing about Jeffree is he sure do know how to advertise his products I don’t care what anyone says he really know how to catch my attention I don’t even wear lipsticks or makeup like that but his knowledge and the way he talks and explaining things u have to give him credit for being up front not like other “makeup brands” they don’t sit and talk about shit they just post when they make or release new shit. I feel like I’m in school everytime he talks about things and I love it!!!❤️
http://www.youtube.com/shorts/Kw1H2V-5-6s JEFREE WATCH THIS OMG HE SOUNDS SO MUCH LIKE U 😂😂😂 CAN U REACT TO IT
Rate that moment /10 on the cringe scale: 14:49 😂
Its so pretty 😍
omg go away 🙄🙄
Packaging looks like a plastic playtex tampon.. most women hide those inside the inner pocket of their purse.. but I understand you wouldn’t know that.
You should review Walmart's Hard Candy makeup line!!! They have marilyn monroe themed makeup, $10-$12 KILLER eyeshadows and glitter lip sticks.
Okay I love Jefree Star but 18 dollars per lipstick I wish he would put them at a more reasonable price for people that don't have a lot of money. Like I spent my whole 5 months of allowance on his lip glosses and I am now broke and I only got like 5 lipglosses
I love this but what's what's the point i mean no one can even see it he can just come out with a makeup palette and some pretty masks because people can see it and you will know it's there 🤗
So y’all are just going to forget 😐
I miss shane 🥺
The dislikes in his videos lately is starting to get very obvious. Good luck, Jaafar.
18m views to 2.5m
can we not let Jeffree return to youtube completely ok again
love you <3
No one likes you
Love them , I ll try them
Hey Jefffrrreee. Why did you make the lipstick case look like a tampon?
I'm sad that lip ammo is being retired. My dream lip ammo is alien tears but I could never manage to get one. Love the new lippies though!
Have a hit and stay there, beeeatch
Might buy conspiracy in tk macks 😂😂😂😁😁

Shortly after her mother’s death, Kathy’s sister, Debbie was at their mother,Ruth Greene's house making last minute arrangements before her funeral on Tuesday. Deborah(61) and her son were both brutally stabbed by an unknown intruder. Their deaths are under police investigation and their murderer remains at large. Attached are articles with all known information concerning their untimely deaths.    https://www.wbtv.com/2020/10/26/mother-son-found-stabbed-death-inside-salisbury-home/ https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/crime/double-homicide-investigation-salisbury-north-carolina/275-c4b2d286-bc37-4eff-b1c2-29985ab23113 https://www.fox46.com/news/u-s/north-carolina/rowan-county/salisbury/2-dead-in-salisbury-double-homicide-police-say/   Kathy is their last surviving relative and bears the financial and emotional burden of arranging the funerals for both her mother and her sister Debbie. Kathy suffered unmeasurable tragedy in the past month, but shows admirable courage and strength.    Regardless, this has been an incredibly stressful, shocking, and overwhelming situation for her. Please keep her in your prayers and if you can, please donate to the funeral expenses of Debbie. Every contribution is greatly appreciated and will be directly sent to Kathy McCubbins.   Please share this Gofundme with anyone you know. With Kathy’s permission, I will post updates on their situation.   https://www.gofundme.com/manage/debra-and-jonathan-greene-brumley-funeral-expenses
Can we get more mistery boxes thooo?😭 I can never get my hands on one😭
The fact that this video has only 2.5 million views compared to the rest of his collections really show that people are kind of getting over him
OMG THIS PERSON IS SOOOO UGLY!! THIS PERSON IS A MAKE UP ARTIST, BUT MAKES NO MAKE UP VIDEOS!!
https://youtu.be/_-_UF7zEoq0 g
He can be whatever but his formula and quality are really top ones need me few lipsticks 😍😍😍
Any plans to add skin care to your cosmetics?
if the world just has so many important things other than makeup like BLM, why not push your launch to next year? (like u said in ur doing whats right video) or at least until black ppl get justice- do "whats right". or wait was it another orchestration to use black ppl as props and reduce them to distractions from the fact that you RUINED james charles and tatis mental health and the latters career?
You are a horrible YouTube
This is a guy?
Your were so classy by not exposing Tati. Now we know the truth! https://youtu.be/6ummjTgKmuA
The behind the scenes, is awesome, thanks for showing us. 😘
So good 😍😍😍
yo jamás te dejaría sola
You a boy pretending to be a girl
Too pricy for me. Cool line though.
@jeffreestar Would you please come out with bulletproof, non-smudge liquid lippies and also smudgeproof foundation (please!!!)? We need a quarantine line STAT.
IT LOOKS LIKE A VIBRATOR
The weird zoomy camera guy has retired it seems. Good.
No
Why the hell is this on my recommend
I thought he was in front of a green screen and then realized it really was a giant bear trap!!
You make me happy watching your videos when I'm stressed out. Love ya!!!!
The fact that people are still supporting him after what he did to James Charles 🥴
Jeffree star your make up your product it’s all good a lot of people don’t have money to buy it it’s 2020 we don’t all have jobs please make your prices go down for the ones that can’t afford it thank you
Okay he did a lot of nasty stuff.He was in a dark place etc. etc.I dont think coming here to spread more negativity will cure anything.If you dont wanna support him,then don't watch hım.It's not that hard.
The people who never hated her 🥰🥺❤️💋
Sorry for what happened to you with the recent ex. Just found out on fb
Are these all Matte?
OMg I need it
Jeffree: One swipe coverage.   Also jeffree: swipes the lipstick 3-4 times
who asked?          nobody did
What are you a girl or boy????
meh. cheap. made in china
https://youtu.be/Gc7Wl4i9yhE youtubes first video ever

C'mon Jeffrey don't be shy post some more :))
Me when I saw that red lipstick: That's so bright, i would be too scared to wear that :|| Jeffrey: Can't relate😌✨🌼
Ugly
I am subscribed and have the notification bell activated but not seeing your new video uploads
how do u guys still like this guy
I really love the color of his finger nails.
Did you help the poor peoples and homeleses?
Hi jeffree you should say sorry to james for all the mess.
So basically he stole Uoma beauty lipstick design. Also Mac cosmetics had the same velvet lipstick with stars in the holiday 2019 collection.
Idk how gay people get so much fame..i am surprised
Is it just me or is Jeffrey getting boring ? Who knows, I’m just not as into it anymore
Is it just me or is Jeffrey becoming boring ? I dunno I feel like I don’t care as much as I used to lmao
Is jeffree is girl?
jeffree star is the definition of tacky
Lotta hype for lipwax...
Your makeup line is amazing I would love to help you in any way possible. I live in north Carolina in a small town would be super affordable for you to have a makeup/ fashion store here. If you would be interested in opening a store that sells old merchandise I would also love to help you out with that I'm also so interested in being a makeup model if possible please contact me.
Please review the new Chiara Ferragni pallet. Love from Chile!
your models are sooo gorgeous! love the shoot
Your new line of lipsticks is bomb 💣 I just got 3 colors in the mail and I’m mind blown! 🥰 ❤️💋 the smell the formula the colors! 😍
That packaging though!
No one:  The lips:  Naughty America
Love your lips sticks
“One swipe”
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how awesome Jeffree's hands are?
You could totally do a fragrance line velvet (male) trap (female) I'd be here for both!
why does he kinda scare me- like.. I just feel like he would chase me with pink high heels
Saw that coming oop
All I see in this video is a person pretending to be happy 🤣
I respected you until I found out you said the n word
The thumbnail screams “graphic design is my passion”
Reminds me of a crayon! Both in the application and shape.. it goes on so buttery smooth #crayolaonthelips
Just want to say I love you Jeffrey and keep your head up...take no 1s shit..and if you are ever in Denver..you can come over and we can smoke some dank and I'll make Chile rellenos!!! Stay fabulous!!!
Yeah sure were in a pandemic where everyone is wearing masks and your selling lipsticks, the only trap I see is you!
You siad the n word no no byeee girl
"Jeffree star says nig" -Larray
You are shameless! To steal Lisa Eldridge original idea after you're crossed against brands that exploit influencers. What a hypocrite you are!

Lindos woow 😍
honestly wish  that trap was real. and he would just get stuck
It looks phallic....
This is the first time I’ve watched you’re channel since Prom Night music video; so like 11-10 years ago.... You’ve changed so much; not sure in a good way or bad way yet.
Loved that nails
Jeffree done made my magic Bullet into a lipstick fuck im sold !
Was the beanie the exclusive item for the premium box?
Are you a boy
https://youtu.be/xFs9EyRTJsU
It has been years now and I still don't know who that lipstick model is 👄
Jeffree Star. I just started watching you and I really like your video
Why's ur video is a ad for me?
Lol funny how we give support but she.he.hes just Jeffery but he doesn't even reply to comments
He’s still making videos ? Lmao
ohhhh, Congratulations! another hot fiiiiiire lippies!🔥🔥🔥 get those 💰💰💰 sweetie!
I thought you were cancelled
Do a video of you playing among us
Jeffree I wish you would do asmr, it's so relaxing watching you apply makeup, rearrange your glass bottle makeups and lipsticks, and your hands are slender and have such calming movements. It'd help with insomnia I bet
I got the premium mystery box. Was surprised how quick i got it. Love everything inside. My friend order the velvet lipsticks. We both got our package the same day. So i got to see the velvet lipsticks. I loved them and will be ordering me some here soon
Bruh I forgot people still watched him
Hi I love your videos they are my favorite in the night I put haed phones on so my mom dose not know I am up I rush to the stairs like a crazy person lol I love your videos  👌

Horrible

He is really beautiful boi!
Just got my mystery box after a lot of problems with the mailman and my package missing. I already get every mystery box he comes out with even the Halloween one from last year, honestly I’m so disappointed in this box it hurts me to say it. And I was really looking forward to it after all the stress I was put through. :/ still love your products though !
I want Unfazed and Drill Sargent!!!

Deuteronomy:22:5 Just thought I should drop this here Harden not your hearts and accept what is good for your soul Remember if u miss heaven you are not missing hell so think about it
These are the best colours I've ever seen
Jeffree: If you look really close, you can see the texture on the lipstick.  Jaclyn: Hold my hairy lipstick
Good afternoon. I am collecting money for my son on a computer. I appeal to many YouTubers. If there is a possibility, please help with any amount as much as possible. My Payeer P1028270221. Thanks in advance. We believe that the world is not without good people.
If could afford these lipstick I would buy in every shade!!!
OMG!!! I LOVE THOSE NAILS🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Seriously, how does this idiot have 17 million viewers.
The models are so beautiful omg
Are the boxes going to restock ??????
OMG！ I really really wanna those cute babies！ however， it's difficult to buy them in China！ It‘s so so so sad！！ My heart is breaking！
You guys need to stop shading Jeffree for the situation with James Charles. It's done,leave it to rest. The comments section is so full of negativity these days.  You trollers are doing to Jeffree what you did to James,untill he was proven innocent. James did say one to think what they are posting on social media,coz it effects someone mentally. You guys posting so many negative comments in all the videos is basically online bullying and you think you are some high and mighty, and personification of justice.
I don’t even wear makeup but the way he designs the products makes you wanna buy them like yesss gawwwwd
Does anyone try this lipstick , because I m poor and can't buy it
I'll take it for free. Thank you☝️😌
Jeffree Please! I miss the make up review video and house tour/renewal project or any dog updates. I need more Jeffree ! I don't care about WHATEVER drama/rumors out there.

HI  DO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A  JEFREE STAR  IN PHILIPPINES  WITH EYE TATTOO BALL
Can someone tell me where did new video go? Why he deleted it?
People always ask why I buy your makeup and ask why it’s expensive I always snap back like😂 (“he makes really good pigments for everything he makes he doesn’t slack off and half ass everything he makes”) (ps this is my opinion) but I love you babes keep doing what u do!!❤️
*Saw if James Wan was gay:*
Jeffree Lynn where the fuck is our GREEN EYESHADOW PALETTES?????!@
I wonder if he’s gonna make a response to larrayes dis track
Jeffree should make a mint/teal/turquoise palette
smart marketing!
bro..this man is literally cancelled..
as soon as covid is over, i would buy.
I think KKW is the best
Talking about Kylie cosmetics Jeffee cosmetics is not the best either
I used to like Jeffee but i don't anymore how can you go after a ten year old well i guess it's 2020
Nobody gonna talk about how he said the n word
I support you because you made a difference in the world and you have all my support ❤️

Hi Jeffrey!I got your palette!
Loved the video!
Apparently you have no shame. You stay out of youtube for 2 months after your famous explonation of the drammagedon situation. You just do that and 2 months later you come in and just put a video about your house reconstructing like nothing ever happened. I’m not saying to start bringing the drama back, but at least explain what you did all this time, why were you off youtube? And you shamelessely say: “I’ve heard some people saying that I only come on youtube to sell a product” and literally do that. Like...Bye sis! Have some respect for the subscribers that you are left with ‘couse you almost got cancelled.
قرف
ااااااععععععع
Is anyone else still waiting for their mystery boxes to ship? I order 2 mins before official launch time (they were realised early on the site) and still dont have anything. :( I should have def been within the first 100 orders meaning it should have shipped DAYS ago... really confused and sad. 😭
I wish I could take that velvet lipstick but I think it's costly...
Jeffree why do you only post videos when u want sell some new products I want to watch videos  not reveals
Jeffree must be desperate to make this kind of old style boring bla bla promotion. Somehow, not convincing when you talk about your own product. Beach, you are going down!
Wow!!! Love you!! ❤️❤️
#cancelled
I just got mine and its sooooo luxurious and pretty! I feel like wanting to buy more in different shades! I always love her products whenever i buy it i don't regret it at all
Will you release foundations in the future?
Let’s start out with Bryce hall yeah he got some smelly balls I only know his name bc addison gave him fame now moving on a sister forehead getting bitter oh Jeffrey star says ####
How can I get in touch with you or your team? I tried on snapchat about a week ago. Thank you !
Not down with the cruel bear trap. Out of so many ideas why promote the idea of that horrific way to trap a bear.
I love this beautiful collection..... in love❤❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰
Can you react on larray canceled?
If you guys see this comment! Is it possible if you can slide by my channel and hit the red button? I am currently trying to build a channel to save money for college!
I wish the the tip of the bullet was clear to break up the monotony of baby pink but to also reveal the color inside. No one enjoys having to read the bottom of every lipstick until you find the color you want.
My heart is broken. I’m pretty sure someone stole my JFC premium mystery box a long with my pure hell lip stick. My box was delivered and it said it was left at my front porch and it wasn’t there. And USPS said their system was down to even check. And it pissed me off. And they screwed up and it apparently got delivered at 11:23 a.m and I didn’t get notified till 1 p.m... and someone went through our tall wooden gates to steal it:... and I’m very sad and hurt cuz I can’t afford expensive things I’m just a caregiver for the elderly and don’t make much and wow someone did that🥺💔. The next day we caught someone on our property and must have been the person looking for more packages. When she saw us she immediately ran off our property when we caught her looking around at our stuff we had out and  we just moved in our home... Just wow.... 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔 and yeah I missed out.. and usps can’t answer if the person actually put in on the porch inside the gate or if they left it out  cuz apparently their system was down when I called asking where it got delivered exactly and if they could ask the driver delivering mail on my route that day. So ive been trying to call usps if they left my package outside the gates cuz it has happened before with amazon cuz at our house it is at an angle so when packages get delivered you can’t see so yeah:... just have bad luck I guess 😭😭😭😭😭 it’s not JFC fault but I don’t think I will purchase again on fear stuff will get stolen and just buy stuff at the store. I love jeffree though he’s awesome💕✌🏼
Bro meatcanyon made you super realistic on one of his videos
Can u help what it name her bf
okey but why did this make me think of sodom and gomorra though🥺
Your not getting away with what you did this fast we need a better more sincere apology also dont make your wealth the senter of attention for the next apolagy if you even do another one
Ok, no lie , I swore off buying your products years ago. But I just watched Swoops video about Glam &Glore and it legit made me look at you and James Charles and Kenneth so differently. I think I’m about to actually buy something from this. A white women hating on you not for things you said/did and apologized for but for your sexuality and financial growth🤦🏽‍♀️..??
Omg I love 😍
I love Jeffree Star and own a huge collection spent over $1,500 on them, but thats not nice an animal Trap!? Really? Im surprised as an animal advocate and all animal lovers would agree WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!?? humm they been smoking too much marijuana. I will still be purchasing but of all the things to choose from that was NOT a good idea at all.
Just received my Jeffree Star Halloween premium Mystery Box could not have gotten the best variation box there was! Can't wait and only hope that you do your Christmas mystery boxes.💚
Omg🌟✨🥳💋💝
Oh my gosh this formula!!!! I just got in the mail. Holy shit balls! It’s the best lipstick I think I ever worn. I don’t care nobody will see it under my mask lol I got pure hell and I ordered the perfect red for my sister for Xmas but I’m so excited I may give it to her sooner. The packaging feels so nice and omfg I’m dead I love it. By far the best black lipstick!
Jeffrey watch larrays new song
Is no-one gonna talk about how he's in a GIANT FUCKING BEAR TRAP?!
Jeffree let's go on a date it would make my year!! We're both single and ready to mingle so why not bae!! You are so sexy and I think you need to try some South Jersey Woman loving!! Call me 😘😘😘😘
I love how he just drops the lid of the lipstick and after he explains it he poses Ly jeffree
“Thank you for all the love on the shade” That sounds weird but going to amazon and adding it to my cart right now 10:08
Jeffree is so creative
I mean the setting is cute and all but this location is not good for filming boo. Echoey as fuck, and all that pink velvet makes it hard to see what's going on in front of it.
isnt he canceled but i still love him
Okay but larray came for you😬
PERIOD SIS
This almost make me want to  Wear make up....lol  Jeffrey  Star were just so beautiful.
i am sorry who came  just to see how many comments are saying that he should watch larray diss track
My exclusive item in my premium box was a beanie....
Jeffrey star is not a pitch laides
Jefree no baby those edges aren’t for you!
Is he deleting comments or something?!
Omggggg love the setttt ❤️❤️❤️

It hasn't caught up to you just yet but it will. Believe that.
I'm so in love with Jeffree Star🌟 ,his a wonderful person and sweet❤️‼️

I'm wondering if the shades that existed will be put in this formula also. I have a bunch of the liquid lip minis but I don't like liquid lips that much, they tend to flake on me, even Jeffree's and I so much prefer an actual lip stick instead. So are there only going to be a select few shades coming to this new line of lip product and we will have to find the shades that we love in the liquid lip or will they all eventually come out in this new formula. I personally would live for a Redrum bullet because I love the color but hate the flake
This launch is a trap guys 😍
“and you are going to GAG seeing this new formula.”  ima gag while watching this
https://youtu.be/fH1BlcJEHP0
He reminds me of Amber Heard.
Love to have one
https://youtu.be/n9Y-lS1trhw
yess i missed him
I absolutely hate this male/female I don’t even know what it is
😍😍😍
He doesn't sell out of products anymore ...
I Love Jefree soo much 💓  I just love how jeffee is so honest and just how jefree is not scared to be " HI , HOW ARE YA,? IM ME BITCH LOVE ME OR HATE ME I DONT GIVE A FUCK BITCH "  Jefree has worked to get to the top and is slaying the beauty industry as well as self made industry in every aspect! While I unfortunately only own 1 pallette from jefrees eyeshadow collection that being cremated- I cherish it,  I use it only when I get to " go out" with my girlfriends bc im a mom of 2 and just simply can't afford to go out or have the luxury of having someone watch my kids so I can get out but me and my 7 year old daughter love to play dress up and pretend we are " going out " and it's so much fun for us to do "mock ups" of makeup while watching previous videos of Jefree doing make-up!!  Thank you Jefree ❤️ 😊 💓 also I watch the video before my daughter does and I do use the * mute * 🔇  button if I feel necessary before anyone tries to come for me! But my daughter loves Jefree 💕
I have my problematic favs. Jeffree is just.... problematic
just doing my daily tasks hating on jeffre
I have never ever seen someone anthropomorphasis a lipstick before 😂. I live a quiet life lol!  I watched due an non verbal analysis of his 'apology' no clue what he's done 🤷🏻‍♀️. Good sales man but nearly threw up in my mouth watching him pose 🤷🏻‍♀️ and how he loved to watch himself... sorry Jeffery. Lipsticks look cool but don't wear the stuff (don't get me wrong i like make up bare minerals, benefit, etc )  and yours looks expensive if you're promoting it so extensively, again not a business woman lol why does it need to look so amazing?  I get having a luxury product but I  choose to buy different things and spend money on things that last... each to their own. Im 43 perhaps a different generation thing.  Right ive seen enough of Jeffery can't be bother looking into why he was 'apologising'  anyway I love beautypie 😉 none of the 🎉zazzmatazz 🎉  no offence Jeremy 😉. Be safe
Paris Hilton wannabe
I'm gay
me scrolling through the comments to see who supports him-
Hoje faz uma semana que conheci esse canal. Tô amando,sou fã agora
You can not hate him for not being boring and being relevant and better than you🧚🏻‍♀️
You should do a favorite 2020
This my first time watching Jeffer stare he or she sound like a girl or men
XD

Unicorn blood ❤
whos here after this video Palette Swap ft. Jeffree Star
i had ur blue pallete, i burnt it✨
Vegan > child labor Yes, your make up contains child labor ingredients instead, but who cares, right?
You are a man, what tragedy led you to this?
notice how he is sending the make up to unknown Youtubers, they are probably on his payroll
💓🤗
it's funny when people so gullible, when someone talks against him people would believe w 0 evidence, like why people get so much into someone's private life, he's not hurting this toxic haters but, they get so angry more than the person who relates to, like why dont you mind your own business? mistakes don't define nobody, remember people make mistakes in life and learn!
Did he really get cancelled?
I would love to stay with you for a day I would be all in your stuff
Such a great set❤  Im so excited for this collection 💄💄💄 Im definitely getting the mystery box. Can't wait to get my order 🛍 Stunning video💋👄💋
Omg I love you so much!! I’m in the first trimester of my pregnancy and feel like absolute garbage and your videos are the only thing keeping me going!! You are a rockstar diva! You keep on doing you! Love ya!!!
I think its funny that he says he can't relate if you don't like bright color lips but I can't remember the last time he wore a bright colored lip.
This man scares me
ur not kylie jenner u cant just pop up like this expecting us to buy ur shit loool copycat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2kxjsrYIig&t=41s
I love u Jeffree Star finally learned how to comment  on videos yay!!!!!!!!!!!! I’m 46 thts y lol
Everyone triggered
I got one of the boxes I ordered im so excited I ended up getting the Androgyny pallet a beanie and 3 lip products
So, he took off all liquid lipsticks from his website (except of the boxes) so that we are forced to buy his lipsticks
The African American woman in the photo shoot sold those Lipsticks, so much attitude and made me want to buy one.... give that woman a raise.
Hi Jeffree Star what days do u do your YouTube videos I know u been doing a lot and that's ok but we love seeing u do make up reviews on peoples brands and I am a huge fan of u truly ❤ 💞
I litterally had the most funniest time in my life reading all these comments about "how Jeffre copy the Lisa Elderidge velvet lipsticks" as if she invented the velvet in the world, lol. So many other brands has made velvet lipsticks before yall, idk why are you being so shady. + None of those velvet lipsticks are like JEFFREE STAR COSMETICS VELVET TRAP LIPSTICK OK. PERIODT. Jeffree is such an icon and such an inspiration in my life; him, as a person who have that much succeed in his life even tho he had really hard times before with his economy is such an inspiration in my life. Keep doing what you doing and even better Jeffree. Love you so much, your brand, all of your producst (even tho i don't have one bc i'm in Venezuela and we have communist lol), i love EVERYTHING about you, your career and your succeed. Blessings to you, Dear Jeffree. ❤️❤️❤️
I ran so fast to the comments when I saw him posts
Why is he not cancelled yet? This man is a sick liar..
Jeffree only trisha gets to decide when shes cancelled, hun your cancelled.
Does he still have true friends?

React to cancelled by Larray
can jeffree stop releasing new things every 10 seconds
I listen to the beauty killer album everyday! When are we getting another album 🥺👑
Why weren't you wearing your earrings? Lol!
Well, I was actually hoping for some new shades of liquid lipsticks with a new formula... I mean, who needs  lipsticks anymore? They never stay on really long.
The terrible truth about Jeffree Star https://youtu.be/1EffEQEj09E
POV:your scrolling looking for hate comments f
you should react to larray music video ....... one more thing......" oh wait jeffree star said n****"
I don't know, does he seem sad to you too?
I think Jeffers thinks that just because he says something and acknowledges the criticism, that it suddenly isn’t true?? “I am not making an update video just because I have a launch” 3 days later.. “BUY THIRST TRAP” I understand he has to promote his brand, but that isn’t the issue here lmao
Waste of money.
Black color for the packaging would look better. This pink looks cheap.
XOXO <3
Bruhh(♥ω♥*) He's the problematic Willy Wonka of the beauty community  I stan ಥ⌣ಥ
Hi Jeffree can you please react to Larry's new distrack 'Cancelled'
do you you call this a Beauty guru lol if any one agrees please like
You butted in the james drama with TATI for what reason? You're a cold-hearted cruel person. I used to love watching you, but not any longer. You also did the same shit with Manny and many other influencers.

We ain't forgetting

Jeffrey seems tired
No one likes you Jeffrey
Hola jeffree mi nombre es azucena Herrera , ya llevo bastante tiempo mirando tus vídeos y me agradan bastante , vivo en una localidad llamada leona vicario y es un pueblo muy pequeño pero con gente amigable , espero poder algún día conocerte y charlar un rato , esperaré con ansias tú respuesta , cuídate 💙
That was baddddd right there baby
uh... i know im like a week late but i just found out that me and jeffree are like 7 or 8 days appart  my b day is on 7 nov
A little too far😵still beautiful😍
I just adore him. He is just iconic. Forever your fan 😘
Hey I'm one of your super fan here in the Philippines I love you hope I can have one of your lippie I love you so much 😘😘😘😘 keep safe always more power
Los labiales están hermosos 😍
That's what being brain washed mea. Already forgotten about his miserable behaviour
😭😭😭 JEFFREE PLEASE RESTOCK I NEED ONE
✨no masks?✨no thank you✨
Grill Sargent and that pure red....:)......All mine!!!!  Thank you!!!!
I really love the mystery box – it’s so cool! Thank you Jeffree 😘❤️ I’ve also filmed a video opening it and seeing what’s inside 😳
I really miss him doing actual make up
I came here to comment, sorry off topic of video. But your Brittany video of " leave Brittany alone" these assess doesn't even realize you moved on and became something from your own self. I have been literally arguing with ra tards ( think hangover) that Jeffrey Star is Chris. Like seriously. If they were any type of fan they would know this.
Very creamy!
"Gag"?? Mhmm ok black king
why do people still watch this jealous wanna be. Hes a liar and and a snake to his friends, boyy jeffree I will never be buying your stuff again #bye
Why hello there Jeff
People wouldn't care if he was a serial killer as long as his products were good.
I hope no one forgets that Jefree star has been accused of being a predator with proof from his MySpace days. That’s the only reason he is releasing this right now. He wants everyone to forget about the media hit pieces that came out about him recently. It’s honestly sad
Just asking did you say N- ? 🤔
Bretman Rock's Swab Test https://youtu.be/Ia41pnntrlE
Imagine a Halloween house tour 🥴🥴🥴🥴❤️❤️❤️🖤🖤
You're still canceled. Gagggggggggg bye sister!
Feels like a rip off of Lisa Eldridge's velvet lipstick. And the packaging looks like a giant cl*t. The packaging for Lisa Eldridge's version is beautiful and classic. You all should check out a product worth buying: https://www.lisaeldridge.com/products/velvet-ribbon-true-velvet-lipstick-colour
I feel like he only uploads to promote his products :(  he really has changed
How is your friend Ian Watkins
Okay, so the shape of the lipstick is classic, but the plain powder pink looks exactly like Kyle's brand. It's pretty but underwhelming. I'm sure the formula will be great though.
this drop looks so boujee and still manages to be cheaper than Kylie's
Weey son hermosos
post a vid with just the photoshoot footage , it looks amazing
Ummmmm sis... no ❤️🤡
Just bought a bunch of these lipsticks! 😍 so in love!
Looking like a fenty product
who hates him or her 👎i can't believe there is someone love or even want to see this idiot
If this giant is real, so why presentation was made on green screen? o____O
nobody moved
The old looks like bullet, but the new is like tampon
I've only just noticed that James has 6 million more subs than Jeffree. Let's just take a second to visualise what 6 million people looks like. Bullying doesn't pay, kids!!
Does it vibrate?
Must be all pink packaging ew give us something new jeez
It's the high quality products for me...not a target market but damn - HARD WORK QUALITY HERE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF
this is so extra I couldn't even watch it, I never comment on nothing tbh, but boy ur a clown
what are you doing, why is he sitting like that? can u be gay and sit normally? and why is he around that a rat trap around him?
Eww
You're marketing campaign has a woman of color in a mouse trap?? Really racists how more obvious can it be
I find it hilarious how he was silent for a minute - but now he’s posting for his launch.  BRUHHH YOU ARE SELFISH.
Legend
I will be ordering most of the shades. Gorgeous!!!
Senddd me thee pinkk one jeffreeee *_*
I AM LEGEND wasn't that scary after all
larray came for you sis
Not even surprised he did this after posting about his dramatic little breakup.  It’s all he ever does .  Was all a stunt in the end trying to get some mf attention .  Losing interest in him so heavily
Jesus loves you
It seems he made video just to sale his product 😏  I came to listen ""welcome back to my channel"" But this is annoying
Jeffstar your cancelled so stop makeing videos
The beautiful ebony girl  6:26 is was the only good in this video
the second color looks so good
Who's here after the laryee video🥺
“...sitting on a velvet ottoman on my giant bear trap like an Afghan hound....nyaaaaaaae”
ew
I wish I had money to buy everything but sadly I don’t!  I have been a stay home mom for over 16 years and I’m happy for it but broke ! 😅
When i saw the lipstick thingy close up i just wanted to bite it i know im weird
Don’t mind checking out the distract we’re all waiting for you :)
Jeffree Star said Ni- Oop 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
idk but the new packaging of the lipstick is kinda like kylie skin product?
LMFAO WHOS HERE FROM LARRAYS DISS TRACK😭
Drill Sergeant the lipstick oh my God no you didn't.lol love him
YASSSS ... this is what I like to see!!!! You keep it moving baby!   Love ya! Xoxoxo   Brooke <3
Love your videos
Definitely looks more luxe 🙂 but can someone tell me if I’m being crazy, the new packaging kinda looks like a mini vibrator to me...just me?
trash
To all the people who make fun of gay people. You disgust me. How could you possibly judge someone on how they want to live life that’s like if people told you to hurt yourself for wanting to eat waffles everyday. I don’t care if people hate me for this I just wanted to make sure that people stop being disgusting idiots.
God, y'all are going to call out everything. You're all such miserable people. I feel sorry for your mother's.
I bet everyone watching this is just waiting for that bear trap to go off 💀💀💀💀
This is super gay.
You are so amazing! My daughter and I love your products! Thank you for making such wonderful makeup. 💕
Hey everyone! I'm just back with your daily reminder that I'm richer than you.
I swear I want him to react to the canceled music video by Larray
I would love if Jeffree made either an Amazonian rainforest or Venus themed palette with greens, yellows and oranges as the color scheme.  Something that gives off a poison Ivy vibe :)
Jeffrey you just got CANCELLED by LARRAY SO LEAVE
I thought he got canceled 🙄🤔
i thought he quit yt
Hi there
Please please please do a restock 😭😭 I’ve never been fast enough to get my hands on a mystery box ever!!!!
Don’t say the n word
It wouldn’t be a JS product if you didn’t go big!!! I live for it. I love the nude packaging. Love the magnetic top. I think the bullet would have been cute if it were silver.
You say what
Is this kill this love bear trap wow jeffree star really can afford buying that 🤣🤣🤣😍
Ok Jefree controversy aside I LOVE the diversity he continues to bring to the table. From the beginning to now. This Queen has taken every step and effort to make sure diversity is part of his brand and I'm in love with the effort he is putting in to show off the BEAUTIFUL COLORED COMMUNITY
You really need Jesus in your Life! Jesus Saves !!!
cool
whos here after the disstrack?
you give me old grandpa vibe
HI PERSON THAT CAME FROM LARRAYYSSSS DISS TRACK
Jeffree could you review the colour pop hocus pocus collection or pallete?
oh look more nudes...yaaaaay (gag)
When he pulled the lipstick out it looked gray-
Larry got you hehe 😈
Jeffree we need like daily vlogs to connect more with your fans not just coming to sell us stuff
So he came back ‘cause of another products to show 🤦🏻‍♀️.
He got like 17.6M subscribers on July 9. 17.2M on September 6. And 17.1M now. Is it because of the pandemic? 😌 📉📉📉📉📉
Celebrity skin and Medieval kiss I am super excited about <3 I know a lot has been going on but thanks for continuing to put so much effort and love into what you bring us! Thank you and as always , much love to you and your incredible team!
He/she r u that person from meatcayon make up episode
In the last video you said you weren't becoming the new Jaclyn Shill (only making videos to sell us stuff)... then you make a video to sell us stuff... then crickets. #disappointed
He looks so silly with his mouth always hanging open like a stroke victim. He has one look like Derek Zoolander.
I loveee your nails!!!
Sociopath
WE DONT LIKE YOU
I love 💋💄the perfect red!!! Want this for Christmas! 😍🥰😍
Jeffree's always so sexy 😍
Hey girl I love watching your videos.  I had never actually subscribed until today but I’ve been a watcher for a while.  But me and my 2 sons are in need of help.  I’ve been in a horrible relationship for the past 13 years.  I’ve been miss treated and cheated on and every time I left he came and found me and brought me back.  Made unkept promises.  But I found a house for $48000 that needs a lot of work and I would need about $60000 total to buy and fix it.  Please if you yourself or anyone you know could help me please contact me.  Me and my sons can’t keep living like this.  I hate asking this.  I can provide any proof of my situation you need.  This isn’t a lie or a ploy for money I’m serious.  Btw I would love to one day meet you and share some taco bell nacho fries :).  Please email me soon.
the amount of juvaderm lip filler in this video makes me inspired hahah
Bro can you just like not?
oooooooof course it's all sold out & won't be back for months. Bruuuhhhhhhhh. Stop playing with my emotions.
larrays distrack is mwah amazing
So larray told us you been saying n****
putting models in the box was reckless will NEVER let me repeat NEVER work for jefree star that's for sure
oh... he still post...
Am I the only one here from TikTok seeing what he saying about getting canceled
Who actually watches this trash?
Stop ppl still actually watch him
0:32 also rip to Jeffery
LARRAY is the queen 👑
All I can do is laugh...
There ain’t no rest for the wicked.

One more reason so many people have stopped buying from you
Great idea to use a bear trap nothing says I love animals like a the horrifying torture of bear traps nice going idiot
Well i really really like your formula but i just cant support this behavior any more and I've been a fan forever and i mean forever since 2008 forever..I've told myself people make mistakes people change but girl its been 12 years and I've seen little change... Your campaign this time was just the last straw..ill still use the eyeshadow i have due to not wanting to waste anything but your never getting a dime from me again and im unsubscribing this is the last time you will make money off of me! 12 YEARS! i just learned from a toxic ex that i was in a  on and off with for 10 years that if someone doesn't really change in that amount of time they never will and its sad
#jeffreestarisover
I ordered malibu beach house andddd jawbreaker annnnd funeral parlorrr
ur not kylie jenner u cant just pop up like this expecting us to buy ur shit loool copycat
I thought you actually were back to be here with your supporters, but u keep letting us down....shame on you. U guys realize? he only post when he wants to lanch a new product..

The shoot is beautiful 😍
Thank you for being such an example to help translate for inter peace potentials even from other groups the didnt expect any inter- pro-salvational potential or fair results of that matter.  On a general level of interest I want to say thank you for helping women feel easyier in life supports with make up and any other related subject matters unaccredited for or of too, angles maxyed?
360 dollars for some stuff to put on your lips to make yourself feel good? buy some play doh and smudge it on your lips
Я одна здесь русская ?🙂 . Ну а видео прикольное👍
why does the claws remind me of blackpinks kill this love scene LOL just me?
the first minute felt like 10 i swear to god idk how 9 year old girls love this
Guys... he can promote his stuff because he owns his company and brand..  Why does everyone always have to come at people for things theyve done in the past, weve all made mistakes, weve all thought of terrible things. Not one person here is perfect, and in my opinion,,, hes making alot more money than all his haters combined lol ... so your just wasting your own time while hes sitting in his bear trap drinking a red bull, Okur? Okur.  Love you jeffree ❤ fuck what anyone thinks, fuck what you've done or said in the past, you are a much better person than people believe and I applaud you for being so strong and taking the bullshit over the years
miss woman really turning into jacklyn hill. only coming back for product launches
Omg Jeffree Star how did u know to release on my bday ☺️
How many times you gonna swipe that. It'll be gone before you know it.
He got the third gender
i hate jeffree so much but, his makeup is so good and interesting to watch..
here from the diss track 😭💀
U got dissed jeffree also James, and Shane on voids channel
I hate him for a lot of things,but never for his make up. It looks pretty  and the colours are beautiful
Not yall supporting him. He literally owns a NAZI company. LIKE BRUH. Its that not enough? Or saying the N word will work? Ugh ew
Wonderful work! 😍 Great 40's taste in looks and campaign 👏🏻 You are improving day after day 👏🏻
But those nails!!!
All this for a crayon 😂😂 that you put on and then wipe off. My art class is more exciting than this and you’re actually making money off this lame ass crap
anyone notice how much further and further away jeffree is getting away from the camera in these recent videos? soon he’ll just be a pixel far off in the sunset yelling at us 😂
I want jeffree to do a gothic makeup tutorial plz🖤🖤🖤🖤
amazing
Lol these views are awful. LOL He's OVER. rest in piss
I honestly can't wait for my Mystery Box!
Who else came to see who hates him
Have you seen this video btw?  🤔 you may wanna watch it Jeffree  https://youtu.be/MiNn1cxT77g
Jeffree where is your toyota supra
I can't wait till he finishes the Beauty Barn on the property I bet it'll be stunning for sure!!
Why his eyeshadow, hair, clothes, shoes, mirror and background are six different shades of pink... *they're not matching hunnn* its lowkey annoying
Blackpink *KILL THIS LOVE* set said hiiii
Crying for help 😢 😔 😔 😢  please everyone even if I get 1k sub I Will really appreciate it
Please help a poor boy to grow  😢  help my page fans.  I'm not asking for money Tho I'm hungry
Love Jeffree 💛💛💛💛 he’s the best
Is there a reason why you haven't posted since this video? Was this just to advertise your new launch?? Where's the makeup tutorial videos???
The echo triggers me LMAO i got problems
I used to love watching him, ive lost all my enjoyment for watching him now..
Jeffree, can you do a live? That would be so awesome
Time is short very short...  Our Lord Jesus Christ is coming back really soon... Accept him, with him comes eternal life securing that is extremely important... ..  For those who want to know Jesus Christ, my precious saviour say this salvation prayer out loud " Dear God I come to you a sinner I repent from the bottom of my heart please forgive me. Jesus, I believe that GOD raised you from death I make you Lord in my life baptize me with the fire of the Holy Spirit burn the chains that hold me captive to obeying you. I believe Jesus Christ you are the son of the living God please write my name in the book of life from today Jesus I make you LORD and saviour in my life guide and protect and teach me your word AMEN"  That's all next read the book of John,  Romans & Hebrew..listen to teachings on youtube Evangelist David Diga, Apostle Joshua Selman, Andres Bisonni, Myles Monroe, Tony Evans u will know how precious Jesus Christ is he is amazing and waiting on you....
SMH, ya'll really gonna forget what he did.
the look of the texture is like a shimmery gritty mold, looks cool, its very similar to the Juvia's Place new lipsticks.
And u can't deny he has perfect posture and perfect body for a dude. Im a massage therpist and very few people have posture like that.
Exhausted after a few minutes of the video. Why are you shouting man? 😂 my ears hurt and I just couldn’t watch the whole thing. Too annoying.
Clown
Whats with the pouty face pulling in between swatches??
I am definitely going to buy these in a year or so! But right now, nobody is wearing lipstick under their covid masks 😷
You are a shameful waste of groceries.
Will y'all be restocking the mystery boxes?
فوق المشاكل اللي سواها لسى صامد 💀💀💀💀

Imagine how expensive that was and good thing it never closed on him
You look beautiful!!! I love your new lipsticks 💖💓💕💞💖💓💕💞💖💓💕💞💖💓💕💞💓
I suspected my husband always texting a lady on his phone , We’ve been married for 18 years, we’ve both been happy together until recently when he switched side  and I found out he has been cheating .I explained my story to a colleague at work then she introduced me to this genuine hacker, Darkwebprohacker who gave me access to his phone , I had complete access to his phone right on my own device and I could see all  his activities for the past 2years and also have access to new notifications, his text messages, Facebook messages,location, call logs, and I found out my husband was also flirting on dating sites..I love my husband a lot and I still don’t understand why he betrayed me, I have been a good hardworking wife and never for once cheated on him. I tracked him down and found out he was always going to sleep in another woman’s house with me thinking my husband is always at work for night shift. You can contact this great hacker who helped me found out the truth about my husband at darkwebprohack(at)gmail com or Whats app +17076225057 or text and call them directly on the same number.They helped me get access into his phone without even touching his phone.I have enough evidence against my husband and I am thinking of Filing for divorce.I want advice if I should give him another chance or let go ?We have 2 kids together.  it's a painful feeling but I believe things happen in life it comes as it goes, as it says what doesn't kills makes you stronger
I love how he’s sitting in an animal trap but his brand is vegan........make it make sense!

Trash.
I would wear the shade that you're wearing in this video, all day long Jeffrey! ❤💄👄

pretty but idgaf
Loving the cheek fillers stunning
it looks like chapstick. this packaging is not it sis
I still stan jeffree. I love his products   people make mistakes, but I will still support him in his makeup journey. 100%
Am I the only one that wants to hear Jeffree Star do more ASMR hate comments?
Is it messed up that I wish that bear trap was real.
Hi

danggggg this is like a whole chanel-paris-style knock out....i'm totally blown away....Paris never did this!
omg omg omg !!!!!!!!! ***love you J.S.***
You have hiv???
Больше всего мне понравился образ Джеффри Стар. В серебристом платье с кучерявыми длинными тициановыми волосами, Просто восхитительно: как будто ожившая современная красавца Средневековья, когда итальянки осветляли волосы, чтобы быть похожими на королеву-блондинкуhttps://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OGC.1c0b64199a75bf8939dceffb475dfba9&pid=Api&rurl=https%3a%2f%2fmedia.tenor.co%2fimages%2f1c0b64199a75bf8939dceffb475dfba9%2fraw&ehk=pIegUedNhBQncLZChDtQP6yBGghcM%2fWNJjs1cw3dU20%3d
Can somebody explain to beauty gurus that is not necessary launching lipsticks this year because the sellings on lipsticks has dropped drastically due to wearing the mask cover! We need another types of makeup or maybe we need to change the character, beeing more us without covering in so many layers of makeup!
I never get to the mystery boxes in time :( I wish I could get just one :(
I want that mouse trap as my bed lol love it
Omg beautiful
WE STILL LOVE YOU JEFFREE❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I saw this video on the side and came here just to say NO ONE CARES, bye! Hope it was worth selling your soul for two years of fame.
Jeffree Star is the best by far...only puts out quality.. unique and beautiful products...time after time I'm blown away🔥💯👏💙💜

Product launch? Quelle surprise!
So if they want the whole pack including the stand thing it’s about 380 dollars 😂
This time its hard to make replica of those..hehehe 😂😂😂

Your editor played you on this video :(

Okay but JEFFREE SHOULD MAKE A STONER PALETTE THAT LOOKS LIKE A MARIJUANA LEAF AND HAVE A GREEN / NUDE COLOR STORY
I’ve not seen every video of yours yet, so if you have not done one yet,  I would love to see one on deep sea cosmetics...I love the lotion... would like to know what you think of the rest of the line. Thank you
I still see through you

If I would have put that in my purse amd my friends or family saw it on my purse they would have think that I might be carrying a s*x toys, just using itvon public is embarrassing. Just saying.

You should do Willy wonka style golden tickets with the boxes!!!
Have you guys voted yet? Please do ! Thanks! 😀
I'm so pissed I always miss the mystery boxes!!! Every damn time ones release I'm always working and by the time I log on which wasn't long after they released they were all sold out😭😭😭 I just really wanted the deluxe one. Guess I'll just spend the money on another collection I've had my eye on but I REALLY wanted this box😭😭😭
pleeeeeeaze make a foundation❤ and brow products

I am seriously in loveee with the look of this! I am a whore for packaging and this hits it once again👏👏 I cant even handle how beautiful your products are. On top of the consistently A1 quality. Been a fan for years, love seeing you grow❤️❤️❤️
So PRETTY! Love you! 💋
cant wait for something terrible to happen
Thank goodness I get paid soon! Probably going to buy a bunch of lip products!

JACKLYN HILL JR.
It looks cheap and gimmicky. A pure attempt to come back. The moment for this brand has passed.
Hey youtube.... Bored of it. Don't we have a brand mondo video to he watching
He just got a slap on the wrist huh 😂
Lisa Eldridge, True Velvet Lipsticks...anyone?
Wow...can't believe I missed this!! All of the mystery boxes are GONE!
I need a screen shot of your nails lol
Set up is ✨ICONIC✨
Managed to snatch a big Halloween surprise box :) Just waiting for its arrival - have hopes on getting a nice eye-makeup palette, maybe "Cremated" and a frost highlighter !! Everything else will be a bonus !! I love Jeffree's liquid lipsticks and glosses !!
Did y'all get tested for Covid before the shoot? I saw the Muas wearing them. Just wondering no hate!! All love for you Jefree!!😘😘😘
I wish he would talk about that time he was an audience member during an ANTM runway.. lmao.
I'm so glad I was able to get a mystery box!! My goal was to get one of the smaller ones but when I saw everything was sold out EXCEPT the small I almost had a heart attack... for once my size was not sold out!?!?! I've never been so excited 🎊🎊
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VUYRMQBuuw&t=36s JUICEYYYYY
Oooo, gurrrl..those lipsticks down to the photo shoot..you kill it every time!!😍💄💋🔥💥🧨  Everything is GORGEOUS!!
why are the make up artists wearing chin masks. Just take it off, it doesnt do anything for your chin
Adopt me 😭😂
I'm here for the lol's! hahahah!!
Stop trying so hard to stay relevant. Your days are long gone..
Will there possibly be a green-themed eyeshadow palette in the future?? I would definitely pay for that!
He uses a bear trap for himself but rat trap for the model. This is what we mean when we say he could have advertised this so differently.
I'm gonna use this platform to say. CHECK OUT ATEEZ.  STAN ATEEZ.  thank you.
👍👍🌹🌹✔✔✌✌✌✌✌✌
Is nobody pausing on the lip swatches? This formula is so nasty looking 😂 And I love his lipsticks. Especially the blue. Super patchy and crusty
too be honest jeffree is amazing
Jeffree </3 Venmo or CashApp me pleeeaassee so I can get all of this )': I'm seriously SO proud of you...and love you and wish I could get all of your stuff but I am insanely broke 💔 😢 I support you 100% though...mentally lol 🙃
You should of choose a handsome white man as the primary male model...

Cheap
Masks destroy the brain and nervous system. Covid 19 is a solvent made by your own body as a result of 5G radiation. Masks do not prevent radiation, other tools do however. Do not wear masks. Do not kill yourself.
The beat trap reminds me of the beat trap in ktl who else a blink
When will the mystory box be reviled
...uhmmm... Velvet cheese? I’m concerned. 🧐   Also, 28 Swipes Later...    But seriously...I adore his products. Amazing formulas that are actually worth the cost. I’m totally in. 🥰🥰🥰
Those SHOES 🤩😍‼️
No one got time to buy lipsticks right now... While it smudges behind the PANDEMIC MASKS.. couldn't u release smth else ??? Yikes
How he’s sitting looks so uncomfortable
JS just pulled a Jaclyn Hill... 😂 sad.
These lipsticks will look great under your masks!!!
omg I can’t even he is so rich 🤑
Jeffree is no longer funny or watchable..
It's just me...  made me think of kill this love from Blackpink?😅
His makeup may be good but he's a  ✨terrible✨ person
Ugh, he’s a sad strange little man and he has my pity
This formula sounds great.
So unique. Love! 🥰 I don’t own any of your makeup yet, but I gotta get one of the lipsticks💄💋
Jeffree posts one video and the next is a promo for his new makeup. Kinda disappointed.
why do people still support him
He is Iconic his makeup is a million dollar company but also he makes so much $ from YouTube Bruh look at how many views in 3 days lol go my Guy get that bag BITCH❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ooh like a few of those lipstick colours yum. I wish we could get the mystery boxes in our country it’d be the deluxe everytime lol. Thanks Jeffree awesome as per norm dude.
This is disgusting 😂😂
How do you sit like that for 16 legit minutes
Thank God you’re back, I missed this energy!!!
Can’t believe people still buy his makeup, follow him and shit...
Hi, can u please do a review on RCLO MAKEUP COLLECTION
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that even breaking just one of these commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..  So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved .   The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ
Wowww🥰🥰🥰
Gorgeous lipsticks!
I was waiting for Jeffree to show a velvet mirror 😩😍
Jefree stars products are legit good quality.. I love it. This new lipsticks are so pretty...
Jeffree please make more videos of your day to day. I only bought your products bc they were so personal and bad bitchy. I feel like you’re losing your vibe... ily.
*Take a shot every time Jeffree says "beautiful".*
Thank God he has lipsticks again, because I've been struggling to find his Lip Ammo's❤🙌🏼
0:48 I can finally enjoy life with the help of, *e z g o o d p  a  y .c o m*
Really just around now to post product launch and then people are going to post the horrible shipments they get from his company that are all broken and nasty.  Happens Every Single  Time  Find a better makeup brand to support! There’s literally hundreds upon thousands with just as good if not better formulas and prices and don’t have the horrible behavior Jeffree has!
If we weren’t in a pandemic where I wear my mask everywhere I go I’d buy 2 of them.. I just don’t see the need right now. But don’t get me wrong these are STUNNING 💄 maybe later hunny!! 💖😘
All the tackiness i ever wanted! i looove it
I really really really really wanna try themmmmm❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😁😁😁😁
Okay but like if jeffree star and James charles worked together come on just imagine it it.would.be.a.dream
Jeffree is not the one and only owner of the brand, he shares it with one Jeff Cohen. And it seems Cohen holds the larger portion of it so, hypothetically, can kick Star on the street. They have redone the main website and you can hardly find photos of Jeffree there so... rebranding? Phasing Jeffree out? I guess we'll find out in the future.
I can't believe how many followers he's lost. Just glad James has so many more. Karma's a cun*. Wait for yours JS.
Copying kill this love good for u jeffree
Lisa. Eldridge.
You‘re losing views. People lost interest in you.
Do you have alopecia? I have it and I do not know how to proceed with i.
More than one brand has ever done a velvet formula lmao it’s not trademarked for anyone to “copy”
Me the whole time: “Is this green screen, or is this just what he’s really like?  https://www.rosewe.com/Christmas-vc-1084-1.html?lkid=71107
Jeffree u always complaining about people copying your concept. And what did u do? U copied BlackPink! I will never support j again
He legit is gonna go broke and his dogs I-
Hmmm maybe I’m confused... Isn’t that what brands do? Create and Launch product? I realize he just said the other day that people were coming for him, saying “he only gets on YouTube when he wants to launch some thing”, he never said he didn’t have a launch, I think he said it wasn’t the only reason he uploads. The sad part is is that these creators have been made to feel so bad  for  living their best life (after years of hard work) creating a channel, building up a fan base, building a brand and then using their platform to promote their brand and products, which is crazy because that’s exactly what they should be doing !!! If you don’t like it, don’t watch don’t buy. Imagine working so hard on a dream and it coming to fruition and instead of people being supportive, you get hate and people trying to cancel and tear you down!! Imagine being made to feel bad about your success and your hard work, for your innovation, and all the bst you put in!! Truly shameful.  All the people that spew hate and try to cancel careers, (like what’s done to Jaclyn and Jeffrey for example) without a second thought are just jealous, and want to be where these creators are, but don’t want to put in the work. If you feel like you can do it better, get out there and create your channel, get out there and create your brand, developed product, stop being a hater.
Beautiful lipstick
You can't deny that it's an excellent formula      That will get covered and smudged by my mask due to perspiration.
Y’all think the models have to give the finger nails back after the shoot?
Lol your gay
What day does it launch again I can’t remember
Seriously... No Calabasas?
✨✨✨
Please review the new Hipdot x Tapatio collab!! I wanna know if its good 😭
rip-off of Lisa Eldridge Velvet Lipstick
This is trash
ordered one last year until today havent received it still waiting money waited on nothing
I love your red nails thwy look cute  i wish hadcthosw nails
I got mine!!
Omg I am so happy that the collection came out on my birthday I’m happy I share a day with your new collection I love you so very much @jeffree Star I hope you are doing good and I wish you so very much luck into the new year
fenty: exists 😭
shades of the lipsticks look like what i would find in a discount clothing store that happens to sell reject makeup💗
Wowww the red got meeeee
It was Nike???
Ok, but why are y'all here if y'all are just hating or don't like him?
So he copied Lisa Eldridge?
I'm not wearing any make up, but your products are always amazing! If only that you have a store in my country, that would be amazing!
Ohhwowww
My legs are going numb watching him sit like that.
apology couch 2.0?
Jeffree: sitting on a trap Me looking at it waiting for it to go off: 👀
Your always sold out i can never buy a thing
You can totally tell he was getting so nervous to show it off!! He started cupping his kneee.
Im a clout chaser and im here to laugh at the jeffree supporters. Bye
This concept was stillborn and your pinks clash unattractively.
UN SUB SCRIBED this is all advertisement no longer enjoyable content.
I swear there better be a palette on the deluxe one 😭😭😭
After you’ve seen MeatCanyon’s video about Jeffree Star, you will laugh every time you see him sit in that awkward pose.
That Pink Velvet dress it had kinda of a wrap around look that dress looked stunning seriously & Am Diggin this jump suit you have on in this And I don’t give a f%ck What Anyone has to say about you best makeup on the planet 🌎🌟✨
Create a foundation ❤️❤️❤️
Jefree stars team is awesome trully
He creates beautiful makeup but I feel sad for him. His eyes look sad and like he's about to cry. This year has really come for him
Okay love the set but I wish you were closer to the camera so we could see the swatches close up
Can’t wait to try the new formula!!
Bought all three boxes and two Hoodies. Can’t wait for them to arrive
Honestly, Jeffree its so amazing. The most beautiful lipstick ever I see. Well, its funny that we were stay up a whole night to wait this babies to be sell. I think its gonna be so much worthy! Cant wait to get them in my hand
Jefree we don't need new packaging we need sustainable packaging or something to recicle, or not packaging at all!
I want themmmm all ❤️❤️❤️
Benefit of the doubt everyone is healthy but either let people believe everyone was tested before working together or they just  don't notice but the mask on the chin is just bad and unprofessional. Those working in public with strangers who wear the mask on their chin as if that's going to keep any of us safe this is a habit that needs to die now.
Definitely not cheap. They're so beautiful ❤️
It looks AMAZING ! Beautiful colors!
Well I just went and purchased the deluxe mystery box first time doing this. So excited cant wait.
So many colors for men. This is a terrible collection. No thanks.
His her him hi ho huck
Did she get a new camra
At 10:25 where honey, suck me is introduced, there was a shade already swatched called watermelon soda that we did not see being swatched hahaha. I actually wanted to see the footage haha
Was watermelon soda swatched? I think the footage got edited out or something
If u did a green palette I would literally cease to exist
A true artist 🤯
Total copy of Lisa Eldridge’s lipsticks. Please go to her website and get lipsticks from a true makeup artist.
its the offensive "fox eye" trend at 6:53 for me
How ‘bout all u haters stfu? U come here and Jeffrey bash when u know u love him and all his shit.  Jealousy is an ugly emotion.  Have a good day. 😉
🤢🤢
say what you want but Jeffree really perfects make up like no other
This just makes me mad because i want to fucking buy it but goddammit Jeffrey my conscience won’t let me. I’m still uncomfortable with all the things that have happened this year. 😣
Omg I loveddddd the behind the scenes look of the photo shoot! I loveeeee stuff like that! I’m not even a big lipstick person but I’m feeling these! lol
Ahhhh got them....can’t wait to get em.
Living and dying for those nails🔥❤️
he's lost his spark
Oh yummy 😍👏
Inspired by blackpink music video.
why are u still here?
Love it .. love watching ur videos and seeing how amazing ur personality is .. we love u and hope ur staying safe 💗
So honored that you used our Song <3
Gorgeous As Hell💜💛
Cancel this idiot. To be honest he is not a good person to follow.
Where he was sitting at the start though!!!
No im sorry i just cqnt support you
A pink lipstick ,in a bullet proof shell case🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗for the lippy lips💋💋💋💋💋💋💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕.
Basically this is the same velvet concept that Lisa Eldridge has done?   No shade honestly, but just want people to know this has been done by a makeup artist that has worked very hard to make this kind of product already.
Why they look like fingers, though?
Bought naked body and diet maniquin!! I was going to give my sister one but I think I'ma keep both hahaha
Cute! 🤩
Holy HOLY GOD I LOVE THESE PRODUCTS, wow these colours are stunning 😍💕
Can you say Lisa Eldridge? She did the velvet texture lip sticks last year.
Ewwwwewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
❤The pitch black one is to die for!!
I remember his videos getting like 10 Million + views once he uploaded... This video been up 3 days and has only gotten 2 million views... Lord the tables have turned...
My heart when he launched this... 📉📉📈📈📉📈📈📈📈📉📈💝💓
Working as a “professional” (I’m rolling my own eyes) it’s hard for me to rock all of Jeffree’s colors to work BUT I love to play at home. I can’t wait to continue playing around at home for my hubby!
For all of the 13k people who disliked this video.....  Your lips are dry and crusty musty 👀👄👀📉
I need.
So Ether I can spend all of my money on stuff to put on my lips?!?!?!? Orrrr I can spend it on my health and education..? I choose num.1
My lips before... 👁👄👁 My lips after... 💋💄👁👅👁
He looks like my Aunt Janet and sounds like her too
Looks like a bear trap not a mouse trap Jeffrey yassss
Just bought mini and middle sized mystery boxes so excited !!!
Wow this is over the top weird. You are so unrelatatable now 🙄🙄🙄
I thought he was cancelled?
I can't WAIT FOR MINE I got the orgy pallet too I've watched you for so long and finally decided to try make up so you know I have a start with velvet trap and the mystery box
Jeffree is out here with every pallet on the market meanwhile I have the same Naked pallet from 2017
❣️❣️❣️❣️
Somebody tell Jamie French about Firestarter omg
His legs must be asleep
no ❤️
I'm speechless the only thing I have to say is that I LOVE YOU SO MUCH JEFFRESTAR  I'm honored to be a subscriber
Nooo the lip ammo was not a good formula. Mine was grainy. I’m not the only one, it wasn’t just one bad batch. My mom also bought multiple lip ammos  and they were all grainy too. Hoping this one is better 😬
I truly... TRULY do not understand how anyone can support this travesty.
why is he still not cancelled?
Does anyone know what lip colour is at 6:53? It looks too dark to be jawbreaker? But I love it
Cant wait to try it out. Hopefully soon. Loved my Orgy palette 💜
I would love to see Jeffree star but from small buisness In tiktok and comment on their products and give his advice as a professional
no one cares
JS is just another WILLY WONKER !! Selling fake dreams playing MIND GAMES
come to CLUJ NAPOCA, ROMANIA, I LAV YOU
How quickly everyone forgets all the EVIL crap JS has done! Keep buying his crap so he laughs at you while he makes $$$$ millions
hello, te iubesc
What a shocking set what a waste of money
Byee charisma...
Yeah, I'm going to need more "Halloween" from you. This is more Easter. 😂
He's using bots to compliment his products! Same phrases repeated over and over again or small variations of the same thing. "you can't deny that his products are good". What a 🤡!
Who else came back to see if anyone commented about getting the box? 4 hours later and boxes are still available this shows people are not as willing to get his merchandise anymore.
How many passes will Jeffre Star get until yall finally stop fucking with him? The world may never know 🤔🍭
I thought  the lip stix were suppose to be one swipe type. Lol as he swatches back and forth 3 times. Just saying!
I need so jaded in my life 😍😍😍😍😍 love love love it
Ah forgot to unsubscribe thanks
How are you thinking that you can come back as if nothing?! 🔫
Beautiful colours
Wow, just like Lisa Elderidge velvet lipsticks.
Ouma beauty did the velvet lipstick first but these are pretty as well
I love you!!!!never commented before but such a fan!I love your attitude you have so much class and grace! I have truly missed your videos I know you have been busy and was sick(so glad your better now) I've learned so much watching you do make up and just love your style and attitude so much!!!I hope you get more free time to upload soon!!!lot of love all the way from KY!
Feels like you keep updating more makeup products every MONTH lol
hi my best friend Jeffree Star I love your Makeup video and I love you all ways and for every
Why wasn’t lip liners released with each lipstick 😩😩😩😩
Jeffery I am older I love clear colors, but fell in lined with glosses that moisturize deeply without bleeding but I look a lot younger than I am. I don't mind buying high quality lipstick and gloss and a simple moisturize powder instead of having to do full make. Up.
Soon jeffree will be creating designer masks when he realizes that he's not making as much sales because we're in a pandemic 👀
Me the whole time: “Is this green screen, or is this just what he’s really like.”
You can’t run forever.
Im so happy was able to get nudist colony and celebrity skin. Sitting at mailbox waiting for them to arrive.
has anyone else had trouble with there mystery boxes??? whatever lipstick or liquid lipstick I end up getting out of them never has the same quality compared to just getting one off the site. I don’t know if that’s just me, but I know I won’t be buying a mystery box.
Wow!! I love the pink!! I love your lipsticks! Thankyou for creating those awesome products!! 💗💗💗🥳🤩👍
I'm just trying to take a closer look at the models hairstyles. I'm loving the vibe of the campaign!
no one cares.
Jeffree I hate you but you can have all my money
Wait what type of room is he in? 😭
When will you apologize to James?
Purchased !!!! Done!!!! Can’t wait to put it on my mouth lmaoooooo
Id take all of them...even after she wiped them all over the hand....honeyyyyyyy these are beautiful def need to try them!!!💋💋💄💄💄 pandemic sucks with money but best believe ill get!
Very cool, but who is wearing lipstick under the mask?
I need those boots rn!
I just ordered my jumbo mystery box :)
They look like they guide like a gel crayon on a high quality coloring book.
Why does this girl talk like a boy
Beautiful lipsticks 🖤🥰
Jeffery you are like 😦
ok i’m not the biggest fan of jeffree, but i love the diversity he has when he does his shoots and the diversity of the models
Am I the only one who noticed that they skipped the watermelon shade, it's on the hand but they never showed the swatch
Well l came back for the launch but apparently that's for the collectors or something? Bad launch in my opinion and since l don't know when to come back for the 3 lipsticks l wanted l guess l wont be back. 👍 lm not going to check your site every day & every hour? Smh
Jeffree❤️ a bear hug to you
Gosh he still has learned hes not walking in it this time  .hes just gonna sit in it Smart Jeffree wow !
3 items... i rememeber when there was 5 for the small :(
They look so nice.  I wish you would go back to reviewing makeup!
🎉🎉❤️❤️1st time JSC customer! ❤️❤️🎉🎉So excited!  I have been following his YouTube for years but never had the guts to order anything! Got the premium mystery box!
i am shookt with the stamps on the lipstick
the echo tho... gotta find a way to sound proof that room they're in :P
These look rly cool!
I understand that we all are wearing mask and some of us are struggling financially, plus i know that Jeffree is kinda problematic, but can we just stop hating on him just because he's launching new makeup product and keep making money? Like he is a businessman, he's accountable for all of his employees whether it's on JS Cosmetic or his whole damn team. Don't blame him for making thousands or maybe million dollars, that's his job as a business man, and it's not his fault if some of ya are spending ur money on his makeup products. Like no hates to anyone okay.
Set planning would have been on point of the teeth of the trap has been the shape of the actual lipstick.  💄
Is it called trap bc we’ll probs buy it in full hypocritical fashion even tho we hate such a toxic trash human? RIP to my comment too when they probs delete it later
A lipstick. When everyone needs to wear a mask when out in public for the foreseeable future? 🤷 Okay...
Omg styling 😍
Omg I got my order in it been  a shit  week I'm  so excited too get it
Imagine buying lipsticks to put on your face mask over it
But ok, Chocolate Fondue.... looks like the color of dog shit....
I'm not a fan of Jeffree myself but I do like his makeup and I cant deny it's an amazing collection. I did buy the Deluxe box, jawbreaker palette and black liquid lipstick. The first time I've been able to afford it myself so I'm very excited to get it. Also he has a lot of drama but that doesn't mean his brand is bad.
Is it me or did this video feel rushed... like Jeffreee wanted to get it over with
Too many pointless nude shades
Is it just me or he actually copied this velvet texture “like fabric” from the Lisa Eldridge lipsticks??
Just ordered my mystery box
Okay but hurry with the mini orgy restock please!
Can’t wait to see what I get in my mystery boxes! Been wanting some Jeffree Star makeup for a while now and usually I’m too late to buy! But this time I finally got it. So excited!
Quick poll for everyone scrolling through the comments: Do you wear lipsticks very often anymore? Like, under your mask?
Imagine being that rich😅😜😍💖💖
Looking super gorgeous Jeffree!! 😍
we really supporting the Harvey Weinstein of makeup?
AMOOOOOO EL EMPAQUEEEEEE
can’t get on the baby poop lip shade train
He reminds of magic Johnson for some reason.
You have now become Jaclyn Hill...only making videos when you have a new product you're trying to sell.
Okay but this makeup look gurllllll ITS BEAUTIFUL
JAMES HAS MORE FOLLOWERS THEN U SUCKS HAHA
EW
NO ONE LIKES U
6:57 They spend a lot of money for a mediocre shoot
I wish Jeffree would come out with a mascara. He has everything you need except for mascara.. agreed!
Black Pink called: they want their bear trap back
✨✨💄💄💄
So all the comments are mostly bots and overwhelmingly positive?!
Using the word 'trap' is overtly sexual. It means "a male crossdresser whose cross-dressing so convincing that he's often mistaken for a real girl." That is not kid appropriate, yet most of Jeffree's videos are seen by confused kids whom are looking for a purpose. Now they're gonna think their purpose is to be a trap. Trying to turn people into over sexuallized sluts before they're adults.

Shame on you acting as of you don't remember what you did. Disgraceful person. Plus left your friend Shane to take the heat
I bet the product is good but the lipstick case looks like an uncircumcised grower not a show..er....  It looks great with the cap off which is how everyone is showing it. But ugly cap yo. I don't want that.
Jeffrees team  MASKS WE DONT KNOW HERRR
Jeffree your prettier then most women i know ..lol
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that breaking even just one of these commandments makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..  So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved .  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117750/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_KttEFbESFBVEC.

Trash man with to talent

What size deluxe box should I get if I'm 5foot and 115-130 lbs. ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS? OR HAVE BOUGHT ANY CLOTHING ITEMS FROM HIM?
What was that song
I love how they look like vibrators 😅
Unfazed reminds me of the color of my babies poop....but I love all the other colors
sorry to say this but im hoping nothing sells out so once i have money to spend like on makeup instead of my child,lmao, then i have the opportunity to do so
Okay but i still hate him he acting like nothing happend
did lipstick nick not do the campaign makeup?!?! i literally cant tell if its her hand
Where are the purples?? Waaaaaaa
i love that he casually has no brows.. What a power move
People here like “don’t support Jeffrey” but look at ya still giving him views💀 don’t like it go elsewhere
These look so stunning 😍
If I don't like someone I choose not to follow or watch their videos. People have too much time on their hands.
I never realised how loud Jeffree was
So I found out it’s 10 a.m in Houston Texas but it’s 8 a.m in California I’m over here scared asf I just got to wait until 12 p.m in Houston Texas
What’s going on I waited until 10 and I love Houston what is going on
Pat magraph dupe I bet

The texture looks like Sunnies Face Fluffmatte lipsticks
رجال جيس حب كبر لفك
الله ياخذك🤲🤲🤲
Wait, he's not gonna say what to expect in the mystery boxes? I think in previous years he explained what items would be in them... I'm wrong?
Missing this intro✨
Did he launch early?! It’s all sold out before the launch was even suppose to happen.
jeffree can you please do a video of you being willy wonka for the day
Jeffree wearing the apology couch
PLEASE DO A VIDEO WITH NOAH BECK AND BLAKE GRAY (Tik tok stars) like you did with the Dolan twins, just a day in your life. I gag for them🤤😍
That set looks way too similar to Blackpink Kill this love music video, They did it better I said what I said💗🖤💗🖤anyways Stan Blackpink
Incredible, always surprising, it excites me. Who also likes?
Jeffree thank you, everything looks perfect but make yellows and greens!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When you waited too long to watch the video and the entire collection is sold out 🤦‍♀️
Jeffery: just simply says the lipstick names Me: F**k, now I wanna read hentai..
Yassss Queen I've been around since the VERY beginning BEFORE the company launched!! I've had the original lip ammo's in multiple colors that I lovedddd BUT I must say that the new bullet is gorgeous!! Ive lived for those as well as the velvet liquid lippies. I'm obsessed the the brand & you bishhhh entirely!! So PROUD of you & how far YOU'VE COME!! 💋💚🔥💄💜💅💎💯🤘🏼🖤👑👠
Unfazed - YUCK. That colour is horrendous— like baby shit on the lips. All the other colours are vibes though.
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?? YOU WILL NEVER BE BEAUTIFUL.
Ok, but LOLing at Jeffree making a video to say how he doesn’t make videos just to sell product right just to put a buffer between his last selling product video and the next one
JS: I know there are a million lipstick formula on the market. Me to me: True JS: but bitch they're not Jeffree Star *Death by laughter*
https://youtu.be/qfSljVwOsFo
I’m not even calling him out for anything... I just want to know how he sat like that for so long cuz my poor circulation could never.
Who actually uses the lip stick directly on the lips i always use a lip brush
that lipsticks looks tasty 😂😍😋
Jeffrey: I’ve been hearing rumours I only upload when I have something to launch and that’s RIDICULOUS   Also Jeffree: Welcome to my new launch!!!
secret ingredient is ✨raycysm ✨
Congrats with the new lipsticks! They look amazing!!! 💙💙 I have been trying to reach you on Instagram for almost 6 months now.  Can you please check your Instagram private messages?
Is no one going to talk about the chair or whatever he’s sitting on

My dad won’t let me get my favorite one of the collection, honey,suck me, because of the name. Maybe you could consider having more appropriate names your next launch?
Literally only gets on to sell some bullshit
New packaging giving me pretty pretty princess vibes 🥰 👑
A one swipe wheely.
you are a shame to humanity !
You never disappoint with the amazing quality and beautiful presentation of your babies 💄👀
At least there's no pubes in it yet
For the quality and brand alone, these are really decent prices. Well done Jeffree for not being greedy...I bet your financial advisors were not pleased.
I want one of each
You know your broke when his cosmetics are really really good, price lower than kylies, and you cant afford either 👁👄👁                   So me...
Ok when are you gonna give ffeebes out
Me: * brings hammer * My mom: what are you doing with that hammer  Me: I’m gunna smash that like button

Jeffree’s next video should be: A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JEFFEE STAR’S DOGS
I must say pink looks great on you not: Multi-purpose lipstick lipstick by day and a tiny little weenie by night lol
🤔😬🙄😒😏😶😑😑😑😶😶😐😐😑😑😑😶😶😏😏😒😒🙄🙄🙄😬😬🤥🤥🤥🤔🤔🤔😕😕😟😟🙁🙁☹️😮😎👿🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙏🙏🙏🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Please make Granddaddy purp in the new formula 😭
Pretty. I'm reminded of the Lisa Eldridge Lipsticks, honestly. When I heard the name, I thought "gosh I hope it's not like Lisa's." And it is. Almost. The glossy embossed JS logo on the "velvet" bullet  IS unique. I'm NOT saying copy-cat. I'm not. Just, I felt a lil bad for Lisa. Regardless, I will order a couple of these I'm sure the formula will be lovely. Congrats JSC!
Hey you are boy a girl 😁😂
ش
Size 15 high heels 🤣😂
How can some people still buy his makeup? Why would you support someone like him? Guess I'll never get this shit
Jeffree should do a collab with THE QUEEN OF RAP.......NICKI MINAJ!!!!
I HOPE  there's  a products of YOURS  here  in the  Philippines.  I want to try the lipsticks  . Take CARE ALWAYS  miss BEAUTIFUL  JEFFREE  GOD BLESS YOU.
Check out Land Cruiser Midwest ..
Why was this filmed like one of them psychic call shows that come on in the middle of your nap on the couch at 2am.  Also, these lipsticks are beautiful 😍😍
🤮🤮🤮
I have never worn lipstick...I may start <3
Just watching this now and it’s all already sold out. Now I can’t waste my money buying lipsticks nobody will ever see me wear because noones seen my mouth in six months.
KLb 😂😂😂🤚
Relate👽❣️

Ball
what's 😈 up 😁 everybody 😇 welcome 👅 back 🤰 to 💢 my 👩🏿‍🦲 channel 👩‍🦽
Wowwwwww
esta mujer siempre se lo curra mazo
Why do I feel like he only comes to his channel to sell his products
Is he only selling them on his website he didn’t mention it this time 🤔 I want to know whether beautybay is going to sell the lipsticks
So rich yet has a terrible fashion sense 🤢
Jeffrey you are such an inspiration for us lgbt community... I look up to you and hope my channel be like yours one day ...
I wouldn't want to use it they look so pretty. I do hate lipsticks with patterns on because I hate ruin them, 😂
Just wait for a month or 2 and something stupid and fake will be made in a video to get him more fame...     GROW UPP
More close ups on the swatch’s and lipsticks pls cameraman !
We kfkkrdld
where the hell is androgyny? thats the best nude shade
IF you dont like jeffree, than why the hell you watching? You have so little in your life? Must be jealousy cause you aint that succesful. Just that easy for you to watch loser!
To the person that’s reading this:   You’re a very beautiful and adorable human! Stay healthy during quarantine ☔️  Our dream is to hit 1k, We’ve been struggling to get there 💛
Why is he not cancelled??
kill this love trap?are you a blink jeff?
Will the scent be rootbeer too ?
He's the single owner, main representative, and name of JSC brand, you really can't separate them even if you tried. Just like with Kylie Jenner.  He chose to ruin his brand's reputation on his own, there's literally no one else to blame. That's why many companies avoid these kind of release videos.
I just came here to dislike 😉
Hope there is will be christmas lipsticks. ❤️
thats not a 'bullet' thats a butt plug
I am living for these lipsticks!! 😍
They are VERY similar to the INCREDIBLE, CLASSY Lisa Eldridge velvet lipsticks.
Okay Jeff ...jus printing out the obvious here but you're literally sitting in the middle of a giant trap that represents a trap that is extremely painful to animals when they get caught in it and they lay and bleed and suffer until a human comes along check his trap or hers and kills it off the rest of the way for its skin or me at but usually just for it's skin!!!where and how did your PR team think this was okay would be appropriate to represent a lipstick I mean like seriously where do you b****** come up with this and they said that you should pack up online just because you were getting ready to launch something new I guess they were right cuz here you are trying to be all cute in your crushed velvet ummm looks like painters suit lol .guuurl it's not good look !! It reminds me of the 1970s like what was his name Don Knox or Mr furley that's what your jumper suits remind me of and now you're wearing a Mr furley crush velvet pink jumper suit lmao.. that should be Jeff's new name Mr furley because wasn't Mr Farley Low key in love with Jack Tripper?? I think the name of the show was three's company but I'm not for sure! So Mr furley the wigs are cute much better than the older ones you used to wear that looked  fake as hell but the Mr furley painter/jumper has to go bitch.. lol
It Don t looks luxurious at all it looks so cheap...
هنيال مامي لمن جابتك
db m
im from malaysia , sadly , i can’t buy any of your products 😭 but i want to so badly
No one likes you❤️
Why is this tacky, toxic mess in my recommended 🙄
You said the 16th!! Why are the sold out already?
I pray that whoever reads this becomes successful
I'm so upset I missed this mystery box launch. I've had such a rough past couple of days and I come to find out that I missed this boxes again this year. It's so heart wrenching. One day I'll be able to get these amazing products. I just really wish they didn't sell out so fast.  I just want to cry. :(
Maybe it's just me but the color of his packaging reminds me of Kylie's 🤷
Wtf is wrong with this trash world
love you jeffrey star great job
Coming out w a brand new lipstick when no ones mouths are seen and won’t be seen for at least another yr. what a waste
This is going to be my first mystery box I've ever bought. I'm so nervous and I hope it's everything he's hyping it up to be!!! 💚🧡🖤
Jeffree looks like he's from the capitol that's so cool
q“For YHWH so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 	Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:  I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 	For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one  jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,  and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of  heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be  called great in the kingdom of heaven. Matthew Chap 5  no matter what you've already done the messiah's sacrifice makes you totally clean when you accept the messiah as your lord you gain total access to heaven there is a specific plan for you prepared by God if you have any questions about it do a simple test ask God to show you that He exists and loves you
Hey @JeffreeStar can you do FREE shopping to norway ❤️😂
*Hey.. to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
How pretty are those models 😯
Jeffree....  Those Shoes.... Damn!!!!!!! Where What Who...HOW do I get a pair?   Thank you Angel
I am living for every bit of this 😩😩 soo stunning and luxurious 👏👏
Do you sleep in you're wigs or hair extentions? New to you , I live in Alaska and we don't have tv
Is anyone gonna talk about what he did?
All ready sold out 😔 i always miss the launch because I'm in Canada and never think about time differences 😖 love  Jeffrey ⭐ products and hope I can get a misery box one day 🤗
Doesn't look like jeffree
What happen to Jeffrees camera man he’s gotten really shit
This looks like hell
That gigantic trap reminds me of BlackPink's Kill This Love MV 😍
wtf
GO AWAY!
Gross
اين العرب
I love him but I’m just weak in his last Video he said “people say i only make videos when I’m releasing stuff that is not true” *next video is release* 🤣🤣
We have a jacklyn hill jr!!! Only uploads videos because he wants to sell us something LMAO
FEEL THE URGENCY... PLEASE CHOOSE JESUS WHILE HE CAN STILL BE FOUND, YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOUR LAST BREATH WILL BE OR WHEN HE WILL JUDGE THE WORLD... He LONGS for you to return HOME!!  #repent #acceptJesus #believe he died for your sins!! Invite the Holy Spirit into your life! Ask Jesus to be your Lord and Savior!! Amen and amen, start having a relationship with him and pray often, start reading God's Bible daily. KJV is a good place to start. I love you all and God loves you more!! 💝💐🙏😄
He’s getting boring.
💖💝💝💝If you are reading this comment:  BE BLESSED!!!   x1,000,000!!! 💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
K buying
babe, protect yourself and i love you
Definitely getting the DELUXE dox of course!
If Jeffree actually liked or commented hi on this comment I’d be diseased 😩🙏🏼
lipstick in the time of covid masks. Like why.
Like someone said he is only gonna come back when he wants to sell something
Looks amazing!
When will there be more mystery boxes available? I was really looking forward to buying my first one but when I looked they were all sold out.
Omg jeffree.. "Floor mat bear trap" is a gamming maneuver that doubles w. Philosophy aspects.. Its not supposed to be taken literal. I love you for this though!!!
Love Love Love the look
I hope jefree REALLY LEARN to stay away from drama. He is amazing, talented and original. I want to support him again like 100%
Is he realy sitting in a trap or is it CG?
I feel like because of recent tea jeffree isn't gonna do volg type videos and I'm gonna miss seeing the real jeffree.
There are many velvet lipstick brands already
HOLD UPPPP ALL OF THESE ARE 18  BUCKS!??!!?!?!!?!?!??!!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Jeffree is there any way you could possibly consider using recycled materials for you products packaging? Or even the lipstick holders, or boxes for your mystery boxes? I would love to see that
Do you save the james charles? Jeffrey?
Sees this in trending  Let’s see how angry people are in the comments🥱
Omggggg 🥰🥰🥰🥰
What time is the launch???? I didn't hear a time
1:13 Did he just call you bitch to sell you something? Interesting technique to break you down so you buy his shit to build him up.
Love love your back to work
Plz make more videos plz
this guy is goddamn creepy
*views are really going down*
Can someone tell me what time is the mystery boxes launching
I’m sad they didn’t name it the trapstick :(
Loved the behind the scenes clip!
It's not even the 16th yet and they're all sold out..... T^T
Jeffree really took his brand up a notch with these!!! 😍😍
Can you please try the neogen pore mousse please?! I’ve seen it all over Instagram and TikTok and want to see if the hype is true or not
That looks like an adult toy, not a bullet.
Just saying, #Richlux called that jeffree was going to drop a new product right after that last vid about the boyfriend
divine
Gay
Yall need to stop hating on him  U cannot change the past  (Give him a chance) 🙏🏼
I hate him, he is a bad person. But he is so very pretty, and I’m a. Lesbian
Does it vibrate? Asking for a friend
Obsessed with so many shades. Hope that there will be some available on Tuesday when I get paid 😭
They look like tampons ; Which is why the name velvet trap makes so much sense.....
He said they would be out the 16th and it's the 15th today and they are already all sold out? Why is that?
So off product topic, but I actually admire how he proudly cross dresses & wears anything feminine while still being stern with his male gender. I like that about him. He’s like “I’m a boy and I like girl things and that’s it” 👏🏼
Why does everything say sold out
I’m sooo confused I goto your website and everything already says sold out but Friday is tmr and that’s suppose to be the launchhhh?
Can't ever get my hands on the new products they sell out in like 3 seconds for weeks 💔😭😭
The only trap I would fall for. Btw looking for a sugar daddy so jeffree hit me up lol 😆
I never bought his Products but I've been following for a long time and this released is really an upgrade. 🙃👍
$100 dollars is a Giveaway. So fairly priced. 💋💋
Jawbreaker is so so so  GORGEOUS 🥰
Scream louder, good practice for prison. 💅🏽
Are the earrings new or
The shooting scenes were INSANE 💕
Make lip gloss like the 21 colors you launch now♥️👍
Say what the Crypt keeper is selling over price shitty make up
Oh my god you’re free can you please put your Halloween boxes back in stock I love you so much I really hope you see this because I was so excited to get it but now I can’t because it’s sold out please put more in stock I’m your biggest fan
Wow! This looks amazing
Yes i love that formula when are you honna make a lipstain ?????????????
Ur a grown man brother
Among us:
Blindfolded challenge https://youtu.be/gjH4WPpPnek
Those are so pretty!
OMG the dark purple
So I'm quite sad, the boxes weren't supposed to launch till tomorrow and they are already sold out on his site. How is that possible if they don't launch till the 16th.
You do you SO well. & I really love the new Velvet Trap Collection. Every color is perfect!
Do these people actually still support him
Will they be on beauty bay? 💕
Did I miss where we talked about the inspiration of the wording with “trap”? Because trap is a derogatory term conservatives and incels use to justify violence against trans women. Obviously not accusing, but since Jeffree often presents very femme and dates men who are otherwise into women, it begs the question.
Why do people still support him.
(This is my testimony of how I joined the illiminati brotherhood )Thanks to the great light I follow, and thanks to illuminati agent! Mr Mike for helping me join the Illuminati, I hope to see the downfall of tyrants and judgement that will be on predators. I will always be in a look out for signs of the hidden hand of guidance that is always watching out for me, after all the humiliation and suffering I have been through, I still got a helping hand by the Illuminati, most especially Mr mike for making me who I am today, I and my family are very happy and grateful for all the help Illuminati have rendered to us, both physically, materially and Financially, we really appreciate, I'll forever be grateful to the Illuminati, may the Illuminati guide and lighten up my path, and that of my family's .This why I'm sharing my testimony openly so that other people who are in need of help in different ways can also get help, I want y'all to know that a day is coming when all your problems will be solved, have faith and always believe in yourself. So If you are interested to be rich, powerful, influenced kindly reach out to Mr Mike on WhatsApp +1(682)302-4690. Email illuminatifortheworld223@gmail.com My loyalty remain forever..
Are they Vegan? Cruelty free 🐰?
Not only do you look stunning but the new velvet trap bullets....BEAUTIFUL!!! so excited!!!!
Is it just me or does it look like a lady’s best friend?
I'd like to announce my full and unconditional support of Jeffree Star.
I'm super excited I have tried every launch to get mystery box of any size box and yet to get a single one hopefully this is my launch. And I'm super excited to try to get my hands on a lipstick ur amazing queen don't let any of this let you down ur suck a huge inspiration for me in this makeup world
Okay who tf is his new camera man/editor??? Tf is going on
1 swatch shades that are swatched 7 times to show it's colour
remember babes, hold your favs accountable, just because you like them doesn’t give them a free pass to make mistakes and not have any consequences <3
can u at least address the rumors and, *with evidence,* talk about it?
Enough already. People are human, some of us are worse than others, some MUCH worse, and yet some of us are better.  The tea has been spilled and everyone knows the business by now. Either give him your money or don't, but move on.  p.s. Don't "Becky" me, I'm Native.
is he just uncancelled AGAIN-
Jeffree always has a surprise
I love the name of this line LMFAO. Velvet trap also happens to be slang for female parts too lol
Looks beautiful!! Nice lipsticks and range of colors!! 💄💋💄💋💄💋💄 Always nailing it Jeffree!! ❤
So like am i the only one who just wants more content not products.
Did anyone else think the camera and the way the video was filmed was kinda shaky and unstable. Or is it just me
No one cares......canceled sweetie. Thats what happens when you have a dark 🖤
I don’t understand he says October 16 and I went to the website and the mystery box and everything is sold out
Loved the colors, but when they were being put on...lots of drag on the lip. Not a fan of that
Damn all that money and can’t work on fixing the echo
Trap is often used as a transphobic slur so using it in a makeup line is suspicious at best.
It would be nice if you posted pictures of a POC wearing the shades so we can know what it will look like on multiple skin tones.  When your showing your light skin model also have a dark skinned model so everyone can feel included and see what color would suit them best.
Kill me this should not have trending
Isn't this formula something Lisa Eldridge already did?
Anyone remember that time he was like “people say I only post a new video whenever I have something new coming, that is not true”.....then the very next day he’s like, new velvet lipsticks yes hunty!
Who thinks jeffree should do this to his hair permanently
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Please reach MKBHD for video and sound quality maybe a collab also would be nice as well
Noooooooo why are we discontinuing the ammunition I only have 1 😭😭
Jefree please talk to the CEO of Taco Bell they have removed so many things from the menu heavily overhauling 3 times already just this year. And today they removed the Baja Blast. Just saying.
Sooooooo E X T R A 💎💗🤣lol this is great
Boy bye
Getting bhad bhabe vibes with the red high pony wig 🔥🔥
hey! You! yes you. stop scrolling through the comments they'll only stress you out more <3
All of you disliking the video need to stop being so petty, Ya’ll know his makeup is top notch so stop playing 😂
Nooo I need my alien tears!!! Can you please make it in the new formula
Ha ha ha. Every time
Hope you're ok Jeffree! Such a beautiful campaign ,You're so stunning!
YASS
They look like little vibrators.
Funny, he’s sitting in a bear trap..... careful
Man I wish I could afford your products I love watching you through
he sounds like willy wonka in the beginning lol
Am I the only who loves the way the teeth look in the close up?
Jeffree strait up made venta black as a lipstick!
Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.
Jeffree:  "Unicorn blood is a beautiful burgundy deep red."   Me:  "Looks  like diarrhea."
💄🤍💕🤩🌟🌟🌟
I love how he acts like nothing ever happened.
did he change his youtube name? looks different
Fuck yes! It's like 60's Batman!
People on here bashing others for supporting an "evil person" Y'all still voted Trump, buy from Amazon, and use Microsoft products etc.  🤣  Don't let your hate be biased.  Better hate them all 🤷‍♀️
Me confused why people are ignoring how toxic he is   Jeffree stans..attack me I could care less booboo my skin is thick😌
8:48 it reminds me of Red Velvet’s album
Confirmed, he’s back to sell us stuff.
They look abs beautiful. Every. Single. Detail. Whether you like jeffree or not (i do) his makeup is the best!!!
I never got my mystery box last time. Post office didn't help me out nor jeffree cosmetics. I'm thinking if I should try getting another one this time.
Beautiful products 🤩🥳
jeffree if you don't remedy this got damn reverb issue i'm gonna apply to be your audio engineer and take you down from within
Perfect timing. I just got my lips done again! 💋💋
When you don't realize your career is over
This looks like such a great product! I hope that it would be available in Bulgaria soon. :)
I can't believe we are being sold cosmetics by a mustache twirling villain minus the mustache
This video is so extra. I LOVE IT
Such a testicle
God I wish so much so so so much someone loved me enough to buy me just one time once one time his line I want his cremation line so bad but no one loves me
MOST ICONIC SET-UP EVER!!!!!!!
Missed you Jeffree ❤️ So excited!!! 😃
Jeffree is looking mighty fine here.  Loving the look of the new bullets too 💋
y'all switch up too fast
The lipsticks are all sold out 😅 Hope I can get some when they restock
wow i'm impressed that is a beautiful ❤️
I don't wear makeup but this video made me want to buy one of them, probably the perfect red. I would never wear it lol of course but it looks so good...
No time to watch entire video. Please tell me the trap snatches Jeffree.
Are we using the phrase ‘ not for the faint of heart’ as a replacement for ugly as fuck now
Yikes
A 16 minute 10 second infomercial.
You look stunning.
So wonderland!!!!
Okay is it just me or did they totally skip over WATERMELON SODA!!!! The shade I want!!!!! 😫😫😫
Coming for Lisa Eldridge, oh dang. She ain't shook, I'm sure 🤯 Lisa is Queen👸 on velvet lipsticks and invented the magnetic lid, but I see you Jeffree. Long-time stan of both divas.
I wanna make a funny comment but..... That’s not my TYPE!! 😂😂
This is why the aliens are going to melt our brains when they finally show themselves
who painted the mona lisa
Showing out and I’m here for it. 🖤🤍
Who’s getting the mystery boxes??
I clicked because I was wondering what was that awful thumbnail lol. I thought it was completely photoshopped and I when the video started I thought Jeffree Star had filmed in a green screen.. then I realized how real and great it was, wow.  That thumbnail is very bad though.
https://youtu.be/DGYJMm6uFSU
Cool. But you can make this packaging recyclable? ♻️  🌍
I'm getting all the dark colors 😍
The first glimpse of drill seargent and i was in love. I was like what is that beautiful metalic grey?? So beautiful. And i always die on the shade names, theyre always so fitting
I love when Jeffree wears pink!
I just wish the mini would have something special in it too 🤷🏻‍♀️
It looks cheaper
The only time he posts on youtube is to launch a product...
Why is he in a bear trap
Honestly i think we should all try our best to try to not hate anyone. If anyone has a problem with someone they should ignore them instead of obsessing over the persons actions. Listen, you wanna waste your time on someone who 1) dont care 2) has more things to pay attention to and do than look at your comments? Please im not saying this to say anything anyone does in the past shouldnt be accounted for, im saying that you should be the bigger person and use your time somewhere else where you could be doing something awesome and amazing! Bob ross painted awesome landscapes in 30 minutes. Im sure you could too with all that time you spent the past year reading all the comments on jeffreys channel.
How are his legs not numb and asleep
I can’t tell if he/she is a boy or just really shit a being gay
One of the best make up brand, Jeffre really now how to give us a glam, diva, and fabolous products
This is a copy of Lisa Eldridge True Velvet Lipsticks down to the magnetic case
Love the new velvet trap collection,  beautiful. ❤
Sorry u dropped this 👑 :3 <3
Jeffree while showing off each swatch: 👁👄👁
Jeffree drops new makeup. My bank account screaming for mercy
Hey with all that going on in the world with the masks....it has changed wearing makeup. Would you plz do a video on makeup and wearing masks and keeping make up from coming off on the mask. Thanks hun! Love you, your products, your reviews videos and watches your babies grow!
Tati says hello!
i regret every single thing good i said about you at some time. i’m here just to say that
You are male
Omg all this amazing stuff release on my birthday ❤️❤️
I love your hair and all the PINK
Jefreee only post a video when he’s promoting his new lipstick 🙄🙄🙄🙄
That set looks more cheesy then classy.
My birthday is on the launch day! Really hope I can get my hands on a mystery box as a birthday present to myself! 🧡🖤
y’all we just gonna forget- or-
🤴🏿🤴🏿🤡
Yazzzz
@Jeffreestar - You've said that sales starts on friday. Now is middle of thursday and everything is sold out. Not cool dude
I'm just surprised he sat like that for so long. Like I cant even sit still for less than a minute.   (And you better believe me and my mom are getting some of these.)
I thought this was a long trailer for the next Saw movie 🤦🏻
i want to wear all these colours but then i also dont want my masks to be wearing them and wasting product :((( the struggle!!!!
Gahd Dammet you're just fabulous Jeffreeeee 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀
beautiful bullet are those matte I still wear a mask in NY.
So I would love if you did a campaign that included all random beautiful subscribers. I know that would be an epic experience for your fans 💖💖 love ya keep up the awesome job.
12:23 "okay this is a really unique shade."  *looking at my eight lipsticks in that exact same deep berry burgundy shade*
He popped up on my recommendations just checked in to see if people still actually buy his crap. 😂😂 & yup we still got a couple dummy’s see ya next year with his next scandal.
Not even a single hate comment in sight y’all deleted everything mr use me as your punching bag🙄
Look at this fool still trying to make profit
Literally nobody is going to buy them 🙉
You should secretly grow your eyebrows  It will be as shocking as Kylie’s pregnancy
Damn that packaging actually looks great
Wow I need to get them woohoo I love it Jeffrey you always put do yourself
Im LIVING for the last 5 shade colors. That Chartreuse color though....yes
omg
His set up looks photoshopped
.
no joke already bought 2 lol-
2018/2019 jeffree would already had 4/5 million views after a day for a collection drop video. U are falling off sis, enjoy your last minutes of fame
LOL
Jeffree using his star mirror as a cup coaster 😂😂🤣🤣
I’m going to try and get all three but I think it’s a very bad idea to do the mystery boxes on the same day as the launch of the New velvet formula. The website always has problems on mystery box day. Or at least change the time so they’re both not available at 10 AM
He looks ridiculous in that pink jumper. Get a new look, Jeffree!!
We fell in love during COVID  https://youtu.be/QM4-3zCTEW0
This is one of the reasons why God will destroy this earth with fire and brimstone.
So are they dropping right at midnight ? Or whaaaa ? This will be my first box I’ll be able to purchase 😅
To the person that's reading this:   You're very intelligent and adorable human! Stay healthy during quarantine😀❤  My Dream is to hit 1k! Unfortunately I've been struggling recently😣 can y'all help me
Where are all the hate comments?
I really want all the lipsticks but I can't afford it
Oddly enough, masks have actually made me more adventurous when wearing lipstick
using a slur for trans women to name your products? as a gay man? great, love the support for the community from you
Get this man from the internet please
Ah nooo they all sold out I want red one
Honey suck me is my fav for sure!
Me the whole time: Okay Babe but are the Nails gonna be for sale?
Your hair color is my christmas colors this season-pink and silver
Comes out with more lipstick but how we gonna see them when we all wearing masks now a days 😂😂😂
I love your tracksuit 💗where it’s from ?
Where are the Asian models in ur campaigns
Love love love love must get it can’t pick just one help!
Jeffery i still miss your old videos... I'm from India but still I'm big fan of you.. my wish is to meet you once in life 😍😍😍💝💞💝💞💝💞💝💞💝💞💝💞💝💞 love you
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😛
I don’t even wear makeup but I really enjoy watching your channel.
All that lipstick 💄 is so Beautiful just like the Host...
I’m still shook to this day he’s still a badass CEO 😈
https://youtu.be/AWJ2UfcI8OY check his music out!
I'm just waiting for the disgruntled reviews of the mystery boxes (cough) *stickers*
BLACKPINK did it first.
but- why wont you make them anymore...damn, I never had the chance to own or even use one of them, I was waiting till I had money...
Huh. Really searching for the outrage with this one, aren't ya? "Trap"? Really?
Can we have a video covering your hair and wigs collection? Cuz damn
Is Velvet Trap a nickname for p*ssy?
Just looked on website and says everything is sold out !?! No joke
Jeffrey just uses YouTube for promoting his launch now days and doesn't give shit to creating content 😑😒I just smell making money 🌚
Rip lip ammo... damn 😭
So ....you did come back to sell something.
I paused the video just to look through the comments
IM SO EXCITED
i know yall aren’t supporting him still
I’m in love with the red lipstick!!!!
OMG JEFFERY REALLY AMAZING RELEASING THIS HIGH END LIPSTICK ❤️
Love monogram
ʳᵒᵃᶜʰ ˡᵒᵒᵏᶦⁿᵍ ᵃˢˢ

says in the last video he's not trying to make money. That's literally the only time you post anything when you selling something.
Really? Really.
The Wario Apparition But Its Really Different https://youtu.be/4DEIicQwMBI
is it just me or do the velvet lipsticks look like small bullet dildos??? 😂😂 can't get the image out of my head
Wait wait wait ..... DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A RETIREMENT CENTER??? like a special "retired jeffree star item room" 🤩🤩

how i wish i can buy just only one lipstick,.when you became a mommy literally yourself is gone😔 for your child to have the best future.❤️
"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." John 17:17 The Word of the God is the truth theres a lot of deception trying to cover it up, thats why preachers are getting arrested for speaking the Word. We are getting closer to the end days and if you knew the truth and get into the word there is nothing to be afraid of because you know the Lord will protect you because God doesn't make a promise that he cannot keep. It talks about exactly whats going on today with the virus, famines, rumors of war, and God tells you that it will not come near you and that not one hair of your head shall perish.  PSALM 91 1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.    2 I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.    3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.    4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.    5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;    6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.    7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.    8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.    9 Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;    10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.    11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.    12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.    13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.    14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.    15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.    16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
I’m a new subscriber
Do ASMRs
I’m so confused where he’s sitting right now 🤔
DIET MANNEQUIN YESSSSSS
My 2 favorites are the lavender and the dark green shades. Hey that's my birthday I turn 46.
#endSARS #endpolicebrutality #endSWAT #endyouthprofiling
Just saw a review of Makeup By Mario Collection and then seeing Jeffree detail the packaging of the lipstick made me realize the difference between a professional MUAs preferences when making makeup and the preferences of a person like Jeffree
someone quick throw a peanut in the trap so it shuts <3
Please send it to @rosymcmichael
Not even real colors i have a few thereshit
Sis I just want a dark fucking blue. Like sapphire pleaseee
Me excited about lipstick  Masks: 😳🤣😌🤭
Open the video, he is sitting in a bear trap. WTF?

I wii miss lip ammo but am excited to try Velvet trap
I love hot commodity !
ok
he's so irritating to watch someone bleach my eyes
OmG wHaT aBoUt HiS pAsT mIsTaKeS?!  Don't worry yall, you're all 100% perfect and have never done anything in your past that you wish you didn't.  You're all safe up there on your high horse.
Except for a few why has he released such odd colours, like who wants their lips to look like poop n vomit?!?!
Kind of upset this was posted a day ago on the same week as the mystery box launch...confirming my chances are 0% of getting one this year 😔
When is the skin care and foundation coming 😂
This is where I wish I wasn’t a single parent living paycheck to paycheck 😭😭😭  can’t wait til my child is out of diapers and I’ll have that extra $50-$60 a month to spend 😂😂
If everything was suppose to launch October 16th why is everything already on his website the 15th , and sold out 😭😭😭😭 I’m devastated
I’ve been told to shut my trap so many times LOL
when you're a little sad inside because you never bought any of the lip ammo you wanted and now its gone...
Jeffree is an extremely strong person. I’m motivated by his hard work and the fact that he keeps getting back up after being kicked a million times.
Skeletor isn’t looking great these days.
Love the trap look😚👏
With millions and millions of people out of work, no food electric, rent etc. you want the last few dollars from that family. Cause they got kids who want it and with no money food comes first. And the kids get very upset. But I guess you need the money more!! Hope from this moment on you have bad luck!  I call you to my kids you are a he she person make your mind up girl or boy!!!!! That’s why we are getting more gays parents don’t watch or see what there pre teens watch. Cover girl and others have the same but it doesn’t cost almost a hundred, just cause of the name!!! Hope your life and love life make you miserable.
how do they get the trap out of the room though
I thought he  was canceled 😐 really thought yall were better 🤢
Man his views are like nonexistent compared to his old views. But he doesnt need YouTube anyways but this is clearly backlash. Plus he doesnt get on unless hes promoting one of his products
I got AIDS by accidentally clicking on this vid 😔
How he sit like that for so long?
I love your videos as a gay girl
I just really want to close that jaw on him sooo fricken baddddd
Would live to see you in a Harley Quinn outfit for Halloween 🎃 she da bomb char 💘
Hi Jefree! I lov video
5:53 anyone else get Lady Gaga vibes from that shot of Jeffree?
Go back to blood on the dance floor
The lipstick looks so amazing. The colors. Everything. Gorgeous.
Not a fan of the names rly... they seem nice quality but dont seem big in size if that makes sense.. looks like a mini lipstick
The half melted suppository is back, brace yourselves everyone!
Wow when they were applying the lipstick it was o pigmented!!! It was so satisfying!!
Tf is this thing?
“im not coming back just to release products” *comes back to release product*
wait.... the audio doesnt match Jeffrey's lip movements tho. Anyone else noticed this?????
You can say what about Jeffree, but one thing is he KNOWS makeup and sells qaulity 💄👌🏾
Y’all hate on him for past mistakes yet praise when LITERAL nazis get their old tattoos removed/covered up. “Nazis can change” but jeffree can’t? y’all be picking n choosing who gets what
the trap reminds me of blackpinks ktl
All devilish
All devilish
When is the trap gonna snap?
I love this!!  My only request would be can you have more plus size models? These models are gorgeous don’t get me wrong; I just want more inclusive body sizes and representation.💖
Those nails are everything!!!
I'm just thinking about how its unhygienic for them to be putting the lipsticks directly on the models lips
FaceTiming and we are looking at photos of Jeffree star and her kid says is that a skeleton? Awww omg
iconic jeffree topping himself once again
HE LOOKS LIKE LADY GAGA
https://youtu.be/kOIZpH_M2r8
KING
If this is the jazz for halloween i cant wait for his holiday collection. Default stocking stuffers!
Ugh I want the black one sooo badddd
Looks like any negative comments are being deleted lolllll.
Like him or hate him, you have to admit that his team is so good. Those props are next level.
Jeffrees' new Makeup Line will include such SHADES as 'Extortion Black', 'Orangatang Orange', 'Anorexic Red', 'Sypholis Pink', 'Revenge Porn Yellow', 'BJ Blue', 'Marijhuana Green', 'Lil Lies White', 'Floating in a Pool of Brown' and more!  The Mini-Palette will include 'T.M.I. Teal', 'Touch Yourself Turquois', 'Rrrimjob Rosa', 'Repurcussion Purple' and 'Can't Relate Ruby'!!
What I want from you above all else is like...Star Dust in a Vial. You got any of that? I want to sprinkle some of that confidence on me on the way out the house. Also, that So Jaded color is a killer, love it  the most. <3 Success!
BIIIITTTTTCCCCCHHHHHHHHHH YAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSS BUT VAN I BARROW THAT RED WIG FRFR I NEED IT FOR HALLOWEEN
Holy carp where is he  Jeeze people must love modeling for his brand, its so fun and interesting to look at
🥵🥵🥵🥵
A bunch of moms are going to think their children are buying vibrators. Oof.
YESSSS IM SO EXCITED...😍😍😍i love his mystery boxes
Kinda love how he is still so confident and looks amazing! He’s been thru a lot and the biggest lesson I learned as a viewer is not to jump on the cancel culture. I’m all for judging JS for how he performs going forward. Letting bygones be bygones.
Anyone else find the echo super annoying?
DAMN Jeffree!!!!!  That campaign is DY NO MITE!!!!  Keep blowin it up Jeffree!!!!
He poses like he’s Melania Trump,
Love naked body..😍😍😍
will the logo on the lipstick affect appliance?
Hey i would love to buy those stickers you made back then for that mystery box!!
Jeffery Star ADDRESS THE BLOOD MICA CHILD SLAVERY SOURCES IN YOUR PRODUCTS
My friend bought your lipsticks and we agree they are poor quality. She won’t even wear them now.
Omg need need néed
You are the ONLY ONE TRISHA IS AFRAID OF.      Good?  Bad?    I hate what she did to H3.   Gonna do to his brother in law.    She didn’t quit because he called her crazy....as he thinks.....she was shocked when he let her see people are laughing, talking how weird at her doing porn with sister and mom.....wrestling in jello.     She hates she doesn’t know what’s A or D-List.      You can’t buy class.
Lisa Elridge's version is much more elegant and came out first: https://youtu.be/DwSAOqoQh24
Jeffrey is so interesting and such a good speaker! His products are bomb  i wish i could afford them all!
This feels like a rip off of the Lisa Eldridge lipsticks.
Yeah, knew thats why hed be back
????????
I need all the shades wowwwww!
Girl we need an updated UPDATED house tour😂😭💀
All these haters here. You would think the comment section would be empty since everyone hates him but here we are 🐸☕️ i’m glad yall arent supporting him by buying his stuff anymore. Just by watching his videos with his adds 😂 maybe now i’ll be able to get a mystery box before they sell out.
The perfect red ... 😍
He's loosing a lot of views.
I like the swatching videos but can stand to hear him say the word stunning. It drives me nuts
Waittttt his products are launching tomorrow and his website says its sold out? How?
Redistribute your wealth
Jeffree: yall say i only upload to sell something  Also Jeffree: uploads to sell something
My feet and legs are falling asleep watching this... How can you sit like that for so long?!?!  Love you, Jeffree!!!!
okay but his products are so beautiful
Not purchasing any more of his launches just here for the comments  #noshade
It's the day before the launch date and everything is sold out?  What did I miss? x[
Your so pretty and beautiful your presence is my happiness and I love your hair everytime it gets me so I say your hair is beautiful it's beautiful okay
Jeffree... come on... there are so many people including myself who supported you from your music career days & we want you to genuinely address all that's going on... :/
I love how he shouts out his team & models he respects hard work!
Who ever reading this hope u have an amazing day check out my music to brighten ur day 💘😇
the packaging look like "tampons". idk why!
we all had feeling.
AYO did we just forget about the whole rona thing or
Omg so many gorgeous colors!!
Not gonna lie I hate his vids he like too much pink I LOVE BLACK WHEN O DAY I LOVE BLACK I LOVE IT WELL MABEY HES A LITTLE KOOCKIE when I was little my fav toy was a hammer if I hit him with it HE WILL BE A MAN
hi sizter
God I wish I could buy more of your products
BLACKPINK influence 😍😍😍😍  Only Blinks will understand
Always stunning packaging, stunning makeup and looking stunning!!
The packaging looks like a tampon applicator js
Wow, I thought the comment section would be full of people holding him accountable for his past and now drama but I guess not.
I love your creativity!! Blessed beeeeeee💗💗💗💗
This velvet design was original from Lisa Eldridge. I am happy that her talent is reaching the interest of other huge companies such as JS!
n
Why is no one talking about the actual product in the comments 🤔
Hey 😊 you should come out with a cute clear mask line so people can actually show off your beautiful lip products! ✨
I thought he was cancelled? Tf?
Is that setup really necessary lmao
Can anyone help me with what time this launch will be aus time Melbourne
It's already SOLD OUT !!!
Am i the only one who noticed he skipped watermelon soda?
I need this lipsticks! Such a gorgeous matte finish! In nude! Hopefully , will be soon available here, on douglas!
I don’t really care about makeup. I’m lady gay. But I have to say I super heart Jeffree.
Nobody cares haha
PLEASEEEE SELL THESE IN ASIA. LOVE FROM INDIA.
Was in a drama a few weeks before, posts heart-warming video, few days before, posts new product video. This is his cycle
I’ve been a fan since the beginning! Just to be a model would be cool af. I would love to be apart of an experience like that. Not for the money, but to be IN the surreal vision!! 😍
https://youtu.be/KlNNrcNbHwc
Defently will be getting some of these 🥰😍
This dude scares the shit outta me I will never contribute to this person
A less sophisticated version of Lisa Eldridge....
This y’all queen? He only Posts when he wants your money
Yeah, we’re not gonna talk about or even ACKNOWLEDGE all the disgusting things he’s done. Just.... It doesn’t even make sense??? Remember how many subs James lost in ONE day, despite their being absolutely no evidence of what Tati accused him of? I sure do. And yet, there’s multiple videos that provide clear evidence and proof that shows what a shitty person Jeffery actually is. How can people still watch this dude after knowing what he’s done? I literally don’t understand.
Omg they r so great Jeffreeee!!!! I want the perfect red god m in love with jt
Already sold out, always order more then you need😒
You really couldn't be more tacky if you tried, but whatever youe never getting a penny from me
So hes posting again, eh?
people gonna give him a pass on the name ??
is every thing really sold out??  i hoped for the delux one... :(((
06:47 divina de campo
How convenient that he hasn’t posted in 2 months and a few days after he finally posts, it’s a promotional video for his products....
3:39 green? 3:49 HOW IS IT PINK am i tripping
😳 That wasn’t long, The drama is still unfolding.  I hope that man AND Nate ruin you! Disgusting how you act, i used to like you and feel bad for you. Shame on you for guilting people!
Why, just, why would you? Mm! Just get the gun
So sad your views are fallen
I thought “Trap” was a derogatory term to refer to someone like him.
Hope Jeffreestar colud send me and my sis. All her old lips stick to play with!!💜💜💜💜
Yah gag on that d’’k Jeff
That eye make up is FIRE 🔥
Wait so what time does it go live to buy? I didn’t hear a time lol
its a one swipe, WEALLY velvety luxurious highly pigmented formula lolol 1:19
I love it can i have one pls🥰
Watching from India but I am American
I hate that color lol 😂 https://youtu.be/2Jo0nrM-Fik
IDK if it's a good sign if the majority of people only click on a video to fly straight to the comments for the tea. Oof.
Yay!!
me looking for hate comments 👁👄👁
I love how much Jeffree invests into his videos not just his business with guests, giveaways, stage set ups, products to try. I've got to respect the time, effort and craft that goes into them. A true art form! On top of that he's incredibly honest so we can connect as well as be entertained and inspired.
I need u to launch mascaara plzzzzzzzzz
Where is it originally from?🤔
Perition for jeffree to make mystery boxes not limited edition
I wonder will afterpay be available for the mystery boxes? 🧐
No androgyny? :(
Mistery box wow 🤩
A few things: in his last video posted literally 4 days before this one he called out people saying “Jeffree will post again when he’s about to launch something” and said he doesn’t play that game...then 4 days later launches. 2.) Launching lipsticks while you should be encouraging people to wear facemasks which will prevent most people from seeing the lipstick? Groundbreaking.... 3.) in the behind the scenes of the shoot, I did not see a single person wearing a mask correctly. It was either under their nose (incorrect), around their chin (not a chinguard and literally does nothing) or they wore one of those plastic ones over their mouth with a vent coming up which is not protecting anyone from anything...you’re in California bro...do better.
Omg
why are your makeup artists not wearing their masks properly?
Perfectly Splendid
So everyone is cool now with jeffree? Ok cool 🤓
😭😭😭 i i want a mystery box but he always Has them out legit a day before i get paid 😢
where’s the boyfriend at🙂
I was expected a Jeffree Halloween Palette 💔☹️
hey jeffree star stans 👋🙄, imagine being blind to your idols awful actions 👩‍🦯
I wanna be this kinda rich
Coppying Lisa Eldridge smh.
This queen I stan!!!!!!!!
They all look amazing!!
Omg I’m in love I started a YouTube channel I hope your pround and go check it out
He was canceled so long ago, why is he still going
I can't wait to wear these under my face masks.
Hey everyone, me and my friend are having a competition to see who can get the most subs. It would mean a lot to me if u subbed.
ew
You need to STAN love island USA
His brand is really worth paying for 🥰🥰
Anyone else wonder who’s lips he always uses for modelling the lipsticks lol!
i need a mascara and foundation from him because i need everything
Omg! I want, I WANT! That blue & the purple lipstick is to die for 💜💙 I love the unique beautiful colors!
Do you remember when you were a POS with SHAROLAID???
Love how he released the last video starting with "i know everyone is always saying that jeffree is only back to sell you something" and only days later he is here to sell us something 🤣
The velvet lipstick was invented by Lisa Eldridge
Garbage person
This looks so tacky. Jeffree looks uncomfortable, background ('Velvet' leg trap used in the fur industry) and whats up with the echo on the audio. I wish you  luck but it comes off cheap, contrived and amateurish....in my opion of course
Who else thought about Blackpink's  Kill this love when they saw the big trap? 😆💖🖤
👌
🖕
Why launch all these on the same day, the website is going to crash & it’s going to be a disaster just like the Conspiracy pallet!!!  I’ll wait a week before trying the website.
i went straight to the comments to see if jeffree was forgived by everyone, everyone is thinking and commenting this don't lie
one swipe formula !!!!! **swipes 8 times**
this video was nice :D, you're colors what you use for you're make-up are so beautiful :D.
These new Velvet Trap Lipsticks are GORGEOUS. LOVING THE CAMPAIGN PHOTOS AS WELL.
I think life is fine not depressing just cool until I see this this is the equivalent of devils butthole this makes me want to take a toaster and have a romantic bath with it
At the risk of ensuing tears with my wallet, will there be lip liners launching to match these shades?
Male or female ?
yes the owner sucks but you cant deny that his company formula was bomb!!
We didn’t forget🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
Can’t wait to try the new make up 🤩🥰
You will be the coals of hell if you dont change your ways
Jeffree might be an asshole but damnnn he has VISION!!! I've never seen magnetic cap in lipstick before!
anyone has Lisa Eldridge texture vibes from the 'velvet'?
He looks so beautiful
Ugh really need some of these 🖤🤍
Anyone here disturbed that's a boy
how did they get they get the trap in their house
Is that the trap from BLACKPINK’s video?
Ko barby izgledate 👍🤗💕
You have no respect for anyone, even your fans that pay your bills and help cover up your shitty past. Really sad.
All of these b!t©h#s saying they won't support J* anymore but yet here they are giving views 😂 Can't relate
WAIT WTF YOU SAID ON OCTOBER 16th AND THEY ARE ALREADY SOLD OUT
You look expensive princess  and her about lovely closed space!
Looks so yummy! Wish I can get my hands on one of those! Too bad I live in another side of the planet where the currency for $$$ is sky rocketing 😢
Unfortunately, I give it a year before everyone stops caring about what he did anymore.
jeffree in a how you like that mv
TRANSGENDER😂
Did he really get away with it? He really got away with it oh my god.
Your campaign shots were gorgeous! 🤯
WOW!!! I’d actually buy this TBH. Looks so pretty and expensive. Would live to have it. If I see it somewhere when I have money to waste...maybe. Love it
Sitting like that would kill my knees😂
You can't deny that Jeffree creates his makeup with high idealistic designs and perfect formulas.
I swear to god if blue blood are in these two imma freak ouuuuut
Is that the kill this love set?
*A boy asked a girl in a library, "Do you mind if I sit beside you"?* *The girl Answered with a loud angry voice; "I don't want to spend the night with you!!* *All the people in the library started staring at the boy and he was embarrassed* *After minutes the girl walked quietly to the guy's table and said to him I study psychology and I know what man is thinking, I guess you felt embarrassed,right?* *The guy responded with a loud voice :$300 for one night That's too much!! and all the people in the library looked at the girl in shock and the guy whispered in her ears,*  *"I study law and I know how to make someone guilty.🤭*   *If you enjoy the comment plz do “sabscribe”to my channel....,* *I know I had written wrong spelling and grammar 🤗* *But YouTube don't allow promotion...* *Please guys help me gain subscribers 😞😞*
*I'm not asking for mush in this christmas, just that the person reading this never lacks health and Happiness Life❤️* *My dream get 10K. I ben struggling to get it for long time, any help is appreciated thank you for your support, and generosity ❤️*
Looks like blackpink
gae
I swear someone deleting comments cus i just saw someone comment we should still make him accountable for his actions lmao.
So like y’all still supporting him?
Those shades are beautiful and I would love to get my hands on them BUT I'm broke. Like really broke I can't afford anything at the moment. I wish I had extra money to buy these but I don't
Diet manniquin 😍
Eoo beeh
I miss the Jeffree Star approved videos.
2 things  I’ve been looking at the comments the whole time like the 99% of the rest of the viewers and I just looked at the vid I I fully went wtf jaw dropped over a makeup ruvival. Why does it look like he green screened into the set.
I pray for you.
One slight movement and he dies lol🥺🤣💀
I think I’m wearing the velour liquid lip wrong.  The colours are amazing but they become so dry and noticeable when wearing them and they don’t last that long and leave an awful “rim” around my lips (like a liner)... it’s the only brand I have the issue with. I’m gutted the ammunition is going! Loved that
I love this human so much idc what people say about him.💜💜💜
Love U😗
Nooooooo one cares but that bbc u left for Nathan tea
Everyone talking shit about my scorpio sis Jeffree but he got y’all watching the Hole 16min Video
All I can think about is girl group Red Velvet
Human dumpster in the flesh
Jeffree looks like cardi b
it's the pure hell shade for me 😱😱😱🔥🔥🔥
How is Jeffree still releasing products and acting oblivious? Does he expect us to forget what he did
I was waiting for the bear trap to close shut
Has the mystery boxes sold out? I thought they were coming out on the 16 October.
Y’all support this monster? can’t relate
Well well we’ll I knew you been slithering around in darkness like a snake you are , and show up making everyone uncomfortable and creeping everyone out you know I can’t believe a creep like you got money and fame , you should be hated by everyone even your parents and family members hate you
Looks like a playtex tampon applicator.
You lit only post when releasing Suttin
I will be buying all of these 😭😂
I have been watching your channel for a few years now. I just wanted to say thank you for being unapologetically yourself. You inspire me to also be myself. Love the colors.
Just like any other *HUMAN BEAN* would... _yuh~_
sis weren’t you getting cancelled like a second ago? what happened here 😳
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣what the f*ck
WHY LIPSTICKS?? We wear masks like everyday but love the new formula
This person is literally mad 😂 all the drama and all the victims that came forward to tell us how manipulative he is!! he's still trying to sell us his 'luxury' shit. I think not. It's so..desperate, goodbye Jeffree lynn. RIP⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️
You're still cancelled.
Scrolling to see if people still love being self righteous and canceling because their mistakes weren't recorded.
He got strong ass legs
I need the perfect red shade. Yesterday.
Jefree Star Always Kills It In  The Make-Up Industry  He Is My Favorite Love Him♥️💄💋
Hello. I have found the internet.

It Is All Sold Out
He really vibin in a big ass bear trap
Love JS💋
you are NOT off the hook sir
THEY WILL BE SOLD OUT. THEY ALWAYS ARE. HATERS KEEP HATING JEFFREE IS DOING WELL AND SO IS HIS LAUNCHES.
Can we talk about how he has the lipgloss also called Funeral Parlour and it’s an entirely different shade?
are his videos getting more boring or is it just me?
I just wish Jeffrey Star cosmetics were stocked in Australia.
Jeffree I love u but I need to wear a mask 🥺
The new package is genius! Can't wait to grab a new lipstick 😍😍😍 whatever they say Jeffrey is way ahead in cosmetic industry
Not my dig cosmetic content but you got game. Caught me watching a couple minutes regardless. Do your thing my dude, your groove is strong :)
No doubt she’s the queen of lipstick 👑
Is nobody gonna talk about the fact that he stole the name so jaded from Kathleen lights palette lol
i’m gagged 🙌🏼😻
Ick. Some look like fresh dog poo. And, the packaging looks like cheap Barbie makeup circa 1985.
Literally nobody cares
Love it. Cannot afford it😭
Still waiting on a foundation...! 💯
Beautiful launch. Miss him doing make up reviews. Don’t love him as a person but he’s really good at what he does. He should get back to that instead of all the drama. Would love to see him review the new Pat McGrath
Explains the drama
When he’s launching new products but I’m STILL here waiting for them to ship my Orgy pallet. Cries in Australian!
All this hate but couldn't reach jeffree 👁👄👁
Remember that JESUS CHRIST died on the cross for every person’s sins on this earth and resurrected on the 3rd day in Glory to give us a way to salvation for eternity to be with Him. ““ Yes, GOD loved the world so much that HE gave HIS only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him would not perish but have eternal life”” John @-17.JESUS The MESSIAH our Savior is coming soon for those who believe in Him, repent of all sin and to sin no more, accept JESUS in their life, and live a life of righteousness as HE commands us to. Jesus loves each and every one of us. Repent and turn your life to JESUS, read the bible, live well in JESUS ChRIST’S name as HE is the ONLY way to salvation. Please do not time away from Jesus christ. Tell JESUS that you admit you are a sinner as we all are, You admit that you need Him, Tell Him you accept HIm into your heart and life as your ONLY LORD and SAVIOR and KING because HE is Lord,tell Him to wash your garments clean and wash away all uncleanness, worldliness, and sin from your heart including the things that only He can see to purify everything of you and your spiritual heart, Tell Him to write your name in the book of life, to command All of you, your soul, and spirit to never leave his righteousness path that leads to Him. AMEN.
Wasnt there a recent vid that starr said he would NOT get involved with "fake" drama to become revelant right before a release 🤔
Very similar to Lisa Eldridge’s lipstick
Happy for you I love the magnet and logo in the lip product itself seems like your loving your business 😉
I love the reds.  Wish I could afford them...
If, therefore, you confess with your mouth Jesus Christ as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
"Hello poor people today, ill be showing you my lipstick Yeaaa"
3 words.......lavalier... and.....acoustic foam......
Black pink in your area - kill this love mv 🤩
**yawns**
I want them :) they look pretty
Ily
You all keep canceling the wrong people. Jeffree should’ve been canceled a long ass time ago.
yasss
😂😂😂
12:48 what the fuck!!!! He beep f word😱😱😱😱
Okay. Ppl don’t buy the mystery boxes so it gives me a chance to get it. It’s always sold out by the time I get on. Pleaseeeeeeee. I’m buying the deluxe!!!!
These lipsticks will look great smeared on the inside of our masks.
What are you doing with the pink velvet curtains?? <(asking for a friend)>
This formula looks amazing. I’m setting my alarm to get my first mystery box! 🥳❤️
Intento número 3. Quiero que me apoyes en mi trabajo de maquillaje, no tengo los recursos para adquirir tus productos y quiero que me apadrines. Un abrazo desde Chile con amor🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺
Bro honestly. With this posting schedule I’m expecting to hear;   “Hello you guys, Jacklyn Star here and welcome back to my channel!”  Lol
his face is orange asf lmao
*LORD JESUS DIED & ROSE AGAIN TO FREE U FROM SIN ACCEPT HIS GIFT* ✝️✝️✝️
Only post when your about to sell something 😂
I love you Jeffree this is going to be soooo iconic much love♥️♥️
https://youtu.be/pA-l-r748AU
They look beautiful. Excited about the mystery boxes too. The video shoot looked amazing and fun. You looked stunning. Have a great day.
I might get one which one shall I get
Hi there,  scrolling through the comments,   have a nice day tho, life is hard sometimes.
He’s a Master !!! He’s good at what he does !! He knows how to sell .
Those aren’t swatches honey you LATHERED those lipsticks on
Oooo
Jeffree is literally a genius for coming up with all this new looks for makeup products. Hate when Kylie comes out with something and the only difference is the color
I love the backdrop and it all looks amazing beautiful, and stunning but I miss when jeffree filmed in his home 🏡 🙈 Ps I need the black shade 🕷
UGH HOW DO I ALWAYS MISS THE HALLOWEEN MYSTERY BOXES
So I see JS got hi's "inspiration" from Lisa Eldrige.... Nice one Jeffree, but the House of Eldrige came out with it way before you.
The campaign is literally everything!! All out !! Yaass !!
Still racists
Romans 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. JESUS SAVES, JESUS IS GOD MANIFEST IN THE FLESH WHO TOOK OUR PUNISHMENT OF SIN AND DIED IN OUR PLACE, THAT IN HIM WE ARE RIGHTEOUS NOT BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DO, BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID, HE ROSE AGAIN FROM THE DEAD, AND LIVES FOREVERMORE, AND HE WILL COME AGAIN SOON!!! PUT YOUR FAITH AND TRUST IN JESUS TODAY, AND ILL SEE YOU IN HEAVEN, LOVE YOU GUYS!!!♥️♥️✝️✝️🇮🇱🇮🇱
all the haters: OMG look she only came back to relece this shit  me/all non haters :OMG yass new lipstick lets buy 200
I can’t believe people still support him. He’s a bully and a narcissist.
The trap makes me remember the ( KILL THIS LOVE ) mv. STAN BLACKPINKS COMEBACK!!❤️
Cops coming to my house trying to get me to stop sharing this https://youtu.be/i8iUweS4xfg
Omg those last 5 shades😍😍😍
that greenscreen is bad 💀
ok but are we going to talk about how his content lately is: drama. release, drama, drama, release ???
OMG I neeeeeed the Perfect Red!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My heart! There are some GORGEOUS nudes too. So excited!
Ok so this is a compliment the perfect red looks like a shade of red lipstick from ww1 and ww2 it was called victory red hitler hated it when people wore red so the woman as a way to rebel against him they would ware victory red lipstick just some history and a very pretty color
Jeffery says it was not going to be launching until Friday but online everything is already sold out!! The ache in my heart 😖😭😭 LOL
Till now pewdipie and jeffrestar is the only youtuber who really understands the value of money where Mr Beast and ZHC doesn’t really cares
My legs are falling asleep watching him sit like that lol 💕
One bad bitch
This is how you power through people
God almighty just stop.
We get it Jeremiah Starbucks you’re rich asf, but instead of flaunting some expensive ass Gucci shit, how about flaunting your accountability? Until then I ain’t buying your shit. Oh wait I never did.
cool xo
2:02 why are his hands so  ✨ w r i n k l y ✨
Really wish Calabasas was recreated ☹️🥺☹️☹️

Jesus is coming back soon, check out Clevelandstreetpreachers.
Still broke
But........masks?!
apologize to choerry from loona i dont like kpop but u should say sorry
Why did he start beeping out the curse words? He never cared about it before
If Jeffree is considered "cancelled" I might actually have a chance at buying one of these mystery boxes now before they sell out 😂 idgaf, I've always wanted to try his stuff. LMAO
I think we really should just forget what happened and just enjoy this video
The stage reminds me of Kill This Love
Jesus loves u & he is coming soon & he died for you, come to him he will heal you 🙂❤️
Okay but it the packaging looks like 90s Mary Kay :(
My comment got deleted. It was just about the shape of the packaging and what it looks like *coughcough* male parts *coughcough* I mean its a perfect duo for the Orgy palette
Jeffree please restock the $50 highliighters!
Lmfao at all these comments talking shit when Jeffree will be the last one laughing when all this is sold out this weekend 🤣 unbothered
Are you going to review RCL beauty 101’s make up line
When jeffree only makes an apology video to sell something....
Ugly nails
I LOVE how you can say RIP to lip ammunition but not RIP to Breanon Taylor and the other fallen. 🤗
Me last video: that background is a little over done Jeffree: iM In a GiAnT vELveT TRAAP
LOL THIS HIV POSITIVE QUEEN STOLE GAGA SET
“The Rat in the trap” Exactly!!
I’ll be so glad when we can wear lipstick like normal again.  These masks hide the glory that is my lips!
lisa eldridge did it first
sadly we have to wear masks and can't stunt these new lipstick
Ima say this cause fuck it, jeferee is hella attractive and the trans community has some attractive people idgaf Lmao another thing on the list of shit to not tell anyone
How do ppl still support him tf
wait... people still give af about him???? Can’t relate
Jeffery can you make hair brushes like how your mirror are. That be sooo cool 👽⭐️🖤🧡
I feel like I couldn’t focus on the beautiful lipsticks, because every time the models mouth came up... I got so shook at her lip piercing being off center!? 🥴🙈
@Jeffreestar I tried to just order a mystery box and your velvet trap lipsticks but there sold out omggg
No one:  Jeffree: Woof
Your sets & product are AMAZING, but is there any way your designers can make the sets less “echoey”? It sounds like you’re in a warehouse. Not trying to be rude, cuz I love you to pieces!!!💗
I missed you!!! <3
Love all of them
The mystery boxes are already sold out FML 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Is it just me or is he sounding a lot like trump? Like mannerisms and energy... 😬 like really really
Jeffree only comes on YouTube to sell stuff
Only an idiot cosmetic company would launch a 20 shade lipstick line with Covid-19 a pandemic, and everyone wearing masks! GTFO
no one:  jeffree: you only need one swipe also jeffree: *goes over the swatch 3 times*
can i plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz get a free sample
Jeffree Star take a moment to reevaluate your life. Be a better person. Hold yourself accountable because we are!
Why are these comments so positive lmao
The dislikes are from the people who won't forget your little scheme, mhm I disliked 🖕
Im so excited!!
Came here for a high quality make up with a decent price to match.  Not to dig his past and act like a saint duh!
Jeffree using his mirror as a coaster for his red bull with his reusable metal straw-- iconic
They look beautiful! Congrats, Miss Star 💫
That's kinda gay                           *lgbt warriors have spawned*
Why are you willingly sitting in a bear trap
He didn’t say what time 😭
WHAT DID I JUST CLICK ON
we didn’t forget what you did honey 💝✨
Que trolazo😂. Podría haberse operado completo al menos.
Dude you copied Lisa Eldredge lipsticks. This is her concept from last year, if your going to copy someone's homework alleast change it up a little. Disgrace
Ugh, I need money
Can't wait for restock ... there's three I'm dying for!
I love to wear lipstick but these damn masks are killing my vibe 😔
Take my money 💰

Wow 🤩 I would love this whole collection !!!!!
He has another channel now! https://youtu.be/hf0sJvW3BnE
Your videos and props are so dramatic 🤣 I love it!
JESURON   Isaiah 44:1 Because the hand of GOD was heavy on Israel for their transgressions, He had to comfort them in the midst of their pain. Several times in Isaiah 43 and 44 GOD soothingly says, “Fear not”. Jacob and Israel are used interchangeably here, a play on grace, maybe? This reminds me of a parent scolding a child ‘This is going to hurt me more than you.’ So says JESUS who made you, created you from the womb, who will help you; ‘Fear not [O Jacob] my servant, and you [Jesuron] (upright one) whom I have chosen. How can we be “upright” and still sinning? That’s grace, JESUS’ sacrifice washes us clean – clean.
Them talking about one swipe, but me over here watching the makeup artists dig IN on the models when they were applying...🤔
Beautiful
Loving that nail😍😍💅

Unicorn blood is my go too lip color. Honestly it’s the only color I’ve stuck to over the years.
Halo semuanya, saya Emil, manajer pemasaran Grey Company. Kami mencari sejumlah besar karyawan dan manajer paruh waktu. Apakah Anda sedang mencari peluang kerja? Silakan hubungi saya jika perlu
This, I declare unto you all, that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. He who was from the very beginning is the light of the world. In him was life and that life was the light of men that lighteth every man that cometh into the world. That life was manifest in the flesh and men beheld the Word of Life.   I know you profess to live, yet ye are dead. I know you trust in your hearts but the heart is deceitful above all things and is desperately wicked. If ye have not obeyed the gospel of Jesus Christ and you profess to see, how will I convince you that you are blind? I cannot convince you of the truth unless you are willing to step out in faith and receive the truth. Thus saith the Lord God of heaven, The Lord Jesus will return in flaming fire to take vengeance on all they that know not God and obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ. Jesus is the light of the world, and the light we have are the words he and his holy apostles spoke by the Holy Ghost and the doctrine they taught. And they taught men everywhere to REPENT and be BAPTIZED in the name of JESUS CHRIST for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.   Many of you have not obeyed the gospel and many of you will refuse to come to the true light and you will hold on to that false light, wresting the scripture to accommodate your doctrine unto your own destruction. For the true sheep of Jesus Christ who hear his voice, come and receive the grace of God and come off of that broad path that leadeth to destruction that the mainstream is on. The mainstream are the ones who say unto the seers “See not” and say to the prophets “Prophesy not unto us right things, prophecy smooth things.” The mainstream turn their ears from the truth and are turned unto fables. But the called, the chosen and the faithful will endure forever in the everlasting kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ.  The arm of the Lord is extended to you this day friends and neighbors. The question is, Unto whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

https://youtu.be/H3JrdCtB7Rk
Not a single mask worn properly 😬
I only liked the video to upset the people who disliked it
Ew
Yall still support him?
If they only need one swipe why is he going back and forth??
Oh Jeffree I need all 20 shades....... wish I could afford them. They look awesome.
He’s a hypocrite because he says that when he tries to post he doesn’t just post about a new item from his cosmetic company and he does that like......
hmm. lipstick in a pandemic.
I love how you showed behind the scenes, during and the final shots 💖
funny how he hadn’t posted in 2 months and then he finally posts and within the same week he’s promoting his new product
im crying what is this setup 😭😭😭
finally a packaging where the design wont rub off in my makeup bag
THE ECHO 😭😭😭
The other day, my wife asked me to pass her lipstick but I accidentally passed her a glue stick. She still isn't talking to me.
It's the Trap from the Kill This Love from BLACKPINK MV.
Gorgeous setup😍
Wow this will look great under my mask.. read the room girl 🤦‍♀️
I miss his make-up review videos. Now it’s all $$$ ....
any body else find it funny how he has the track record of posting a video "saying the truth" and being open about his mistakes when his name is in hot water right before a launch....... oh just me, interesting.
What I’d give to be a model for one of his shoots! 😩
pigment the house
So after being gone for a couple of months, Jeffree comes back a few days ago and BAM! Trying to sell his new product.... There seems to be a pattern here. Sad!
Jeffree's makeup is jus on point regardless of everything his makeup is just good. Plain and simple  💜💜🌈🌈😈😈❤️❤️💰💰🤑🤑😍😍😍🖤🖤🖤♟💍💣💣💣
Damn 20 shadesss!!
This guy still getting front page despite everything he done?
I need those heels 🤤
Love how they look like vibraters
Jeffree you should host a beauty competition. Like America's next top business mogul extraordinaire!
Lisa Eldridge anyone? Only velvet lipstick that anyone should be buying.
Anyone else getting Lisa Eldridge's lipstick vibes? No shade, just saying!
Love it 😍
You should do a makeup advent calendar for Christmas

Where your back bf at
This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that breaking even just one of these commandments makes us guilty of breaking them all.   The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved.  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ .  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism..
This is what happens when you try to put on makeup after your face has been ran over by a truck! 🤔😒😖🙅
I am a lipstick slut so i was amazed at every color lol
This whole video has awkward infomercial vibes
We don’t care
Fantastic  Amazing  Gorgeous  Godly Outstanding Triumphant  Look for my hidden messages

Sir you think you're really off the hook?
Also why would you invest in marketing a new lip line when the whole world is wearing masks right now lol
All the setup for this room and you couldn't spring for some better acoustics? It sounds like you filmed this in an empty Costco
So are yall still gonna cancel him or are yall gonna wait till after yall buy his shit like usual?? Yall be switching up faster than a Nintendo 🙄
You should use these lipsticks to smear everything you've done in a "dark place" 😊💘✨🌹
Can you do a full face of Kaja Beauty products
chess!!!
I heard somewhere that face recognition starts with the eyebrows Jeffree really had me thinking.
When jeffree star tries to copy @lisaeldridge iconic lipsticks and doesn't even come close 😒🙄
You guys are going to *GAG* at these new lipsticks ( ՞ਊ ՞）
Heyyyyyyy

JESUS IS COMING  & HE LOVES  YOU  Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin   THIS WORLD IS FULL OF SIN JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY !!! JESUS is COMING BELIEVE AND AND ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR TRUST IN HIM TODAY GOD LOVES YOU SO MUCH JUST COME BACK HOME AND LOVE HIM BACK  DENY YOURSELF DAILY AND TURN FROM SIN DAILY         #christian #jesus #faith #love #god #bible  #christ #church #christianity #fairtrade #gospel #hope #blessed #jesuschrist #truth #handmade #prayer #pray #scripture #life #holyspirit #worship #peace #godisgood #inspiration #religion #bibleverse #encouragement #motivation #goodnews
Has anyone else fogoten how his boyfriend robed him 🤣🤣🤣
Omg on my birthday  😍this will be a great  gift for me
Boy I don't want to hear about your new lipstick.  I wanna hear about your ex black boy boyfriend. Did you pay him? Did he really steal from you or were you bitter that he left with some gifts? Is black D bigger and better? Or was it small? Did you go to any of his games??  Enquiring minds want to know🥴👀
Jeffree really do be lookin' like Burdine from Bratz
king of ignoring problems
Interesting
I'm so glad jeffree is still doing his thing, cancel culture is killing youtube.
My dog threw up when the video started.
Of course America would make a man dressed as a Barbie famous
AH WHAT TIME!? Did I miss it
I feel you I’m tod to shut my trap
thats an amazing idea for the box. I love to keep the packaging of your products so this is amazing for the new lipstick 💄 😘
OMG, THAT LIPSTICK IS BEYOND EXTRAORDINAIRE 😍💄
I dare you to use hemp plastic for a future product I love Hemp xoxoxoxoxo
I am more adventurous with eyeshadow but I just don't think colors but a muted brown looks good on me. I need help in what colors look good on me and what doesn't.
y’all hated on jaclyn saying “she only uploads when she wants to sell something” but y’all can’t see he’s doing literally the same thing 💀💀💀
okay nazi
I love you Queen ❤️
Omg I love you and your cosmetics. I’m a makeup artist and your the best in cosmetics.
Who is still allowing him on the trending page?
Can I get some makeup😇🤔😘😊🤗😮😚😃😄
Congratulations 🍾🎊🎉! Beautiful lipstick’s 💄 Blessings!
I love your videos and will love to get some of  the  makeup
I would love perfume sometime in 2021 but these shades are killer
I don't think I've ever seen you with a blue lipstick Jeffree. We can't be brave if we don't see you being brave my friend lol.
stop taking down my comment thanks
The signs of Jesus soon return are so strong now and the evidence is so clear that any person willing to accept the truth can see that the end of the world, as we know it, is near. 	 	-John3:16 "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. 	-Romans3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 	-Romans5:8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 	-Romans6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. 	-Romans10:9 that if you confess with your mouth Jesus [as] Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;  Jesus paid the price for sinners. He has provided a way to spend eternity with Him and the Father. All you need to do is: 	 	-Acts16:31 …Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved...  God has already done all the work. 	 	-Ephesians2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, [it is] the gift of God; 	-Ephesians2:9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.  Fully trust in Jesus alone as the payment for your sins. God is offering you salvation as a gift. All that you must do is accept it. Jesus is the only way of salvation 	 	-John14:6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.  That being said, we must repent of our sins. While repentance is not a work that earns salvation, repentance unto salvation does result in works. It is impossible to change your mind truly and fully without that causing a change in action. In the Bible, repentance results in a change in behavior. Repentance, when properly defined, is necessary for salvation. Biblical repentance is changing your mind about Jesus Christ and turning to God in faith for salvation. 	 	-Acts3:19 "Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord;  Turning away from sin is a sign of true repentance and a result of genuine, faith-based repentance towards the Lord Jesus Christ.
Who is the music!
Terrible
You should get a chinchilla
And it's launching on this Friday!! Omg I'm so excited
Can you please go back to a smaller set up when revealing new products? Yes the props are great but the camera needs to be too far back to fit it in and you can’t see the product.
Nothing like slagging off your old product to promote your new product 🤪😂🤣
Everyones wearing masks sooooo bad timing  🙄
I still don’t like him.
Trash!
Tiny bikinis
Wow, *you still have the audacity to come back and post shit like no big? What about everyone else?* 😬
who the hell wants green lips?  what the f
Jeffree, honey, I thought we weren’t coming back to YouTube just to sell something?
I'm so excited for velvet trap lipstick
His make up he comes out with is supreme
Bruh music video for just a lipstick that’s ridiculous
Holy fuck a melted lipstick tube gained sentience and is trying to hawk cheap crap.
Oh shit it drops on my birthday ❤️🤍
Don't waste your time  scrolling people aren't holding him accountable anymore
I hope one day you see this but I would really love to model for you
Youtube pushing a drag queen? At this point I ain't even surprised.
why even bother giving your staff masks if none of them are gonna use it?? wasteful and dangerous
Guys I think he’s gay
Am I the only one who thinks the lipstick look like a butt plug
Wenn man ein Video über das Universum und dessen unendliche Weiten sieht und danach in den Trends so etwas... Nein, die Menschen werden es definitiv nicht schaffen...
Jeffree uploading after two months: “yall say I only upload when theres a new collection, false” 4 days later: “Introducing the New Jeffree Star Velvet Lipstiks!”
STOP SUPPORTING BAD PEOPLE! yes his makeup might be good but you are supporting a horrible person, and there are soooooooo many brands with amazing products and for cheaper!
How do I get 1 million views though 🙂😤🥵
Just here for the comments section.
If I didn’t know that was a trap I could’ve sworn I saw that in a dream.
Literally to the 1% who’s reading this,God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day.💛(my dream is to become a famous YouTuber) thanks .
You're about to own Wv Jeffree, because you're straighter than all of them
sire jeffreys a bad person...but his makeup is amazing
jeffery you being a cosmetic expert so who better to as to do this review. i was wondering if you could do a review on the SELENA MAC COLLECTION. ive herd its good. but better have opion of an expert. selena was an awsome singer and to have you review it would be awsome.
I would loooove to work for his company .....I'd take a job from him anyday ....it would help allot
Oh.. You dont just come back when you wanna sell something, huh.
Y’all really forgot everything this dude did🤦🏾‍♂️
I’ll take your whole stock.
no
I just decided to read the comments....
Hate him or love him he always has a top notch presentation
Do what my name says
Ommmmmmmmgggg Jefreee you are a f##king genius. I want 😫
So it was all for a new launch ?? 🤔
Get girl !!! Those lips Shades are sexy.  J⭐ when you gonna make face masks so we all can look cute AF ???
Okay, why is no one holding him accountable for what he’s done??? It’s like everyone is brainwashed and just forgot what he’s done
How dumb must someone be to buy that overprices clown makeup owned by a lunatic?!!
Those lipsticks actually look seriously pigmented and the colours are unique and beautiful.
Hi!   Don't mind me, just waiting for the day youtube FINALLY deplatforns you 😙
So, removing all negative comments now ?
You can hate Jeffree but u can’t deny his products are the best
So you made an incredibly unsustainable non recyclable packaging but it’s cute so ITS OK
Reminder: *DON'T STOP COMMENTING*
She's in hell?
mrbeast has thought me to do this lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAmh_Zsw2k&t=2s watch it
Love the new lipstick
Jeffrey I absolutely love the red hair look u are so gorgeous
I need a shade called gun metal
That tracksuit though 😍
This has nothing to do with the video but I always wondered why I found milli Bobby brown to look so familiar  and who she reminded me of. It's jeffree star 🤔
Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people hope in absolute perfection !!! No more dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. Visual Bible movies on YouTube ❤️👑✝️📖🙏
The boxes are on the website now but say they are sold out ?
Lisa Eldridge did it better.
Is it just me or is Jeffrey's views going down?
Really sad about the basic colouring of the packaging
What happened to the liquid frost???
Jeffree is approving comments or something because every time I refresh I can't find my comments, I think he has black listed certain words. Jeff, your views are down, that makes me happy, at least people are finally waking up ahah
why does it say its on the website today?
Big suprise!
Yeah but whats the point of make up if you look ugly after too? Save your money
Congrats Jeffrey!!! Beautiful🌺🌺🌺🌺
I love Jeffree but I'm afraid. He drinks too much energy drinks. Please baby, switch to water from time to time.
I’m shook. I can’t wait to buy ❤️
Gay
I refuse to believe the wording "velvet TRAP" was a coincidence
Remember when he just sat in front of a camera and revealed these collections... good times...
Can we talk about the editing of the video ?
Wash rinse repeat..🙄 UGH
Iiiii
Is it just me or do these look an awful lot like Lisa Eldridge's velvet lipsticks :I
Nails are fierce girl....💅
YOUR 💅NAILS 💅
He really started some more drama just to promote something
Hey guys Look at SWOOP’s video about the drama between her and Mykie from glam&gore  The 🍵 is hot  James Charles and Jeffree Star are involved a bit too
So everyone is just gonna ignore what happened a couple weeks ago-
I have a question do you think in the spring time you will launch more mystery boxes? Because for my birthday I would love one if you could make my wish come true 😍😍
That whole set up and he couldn't find a pink nail..
I loved the old lipstick packaging more 💄💔
Clearly someone is a fan of Lisa Eldridge. She came out with this two years ago. She even came up with the velvet textured bullet. Lisa is a well known makeup artist, but her makeup brand is smaller. Right now it just has the lipsticks. Shame that Jeffrey had to copy the idea.
"You really only need one swipe"...... Swipes 10 times for every shade.
Who need a new lipstick , when you use a facemask ?? 😷 it's not logic
We might be gagging for the lipstick. But ur gagging for self respect. Never buying anything from u.
OMG to funny,  a KVD vegan beauty ad played during this BAHAHAHA
Ruby woo did not see that coming
You are awesome, Jeffree!   Gorgeous campaign!
notice how hes sitting inside the the thing where Blackpink performed How u like that mv
XD'NT
i'm honestly wondering why this is a thing. all of it.
And here I'm one more time watching this launch knowing I'll never put my hands and any of his products no matter how much I want them ;( still living for it.
Hey gay
we ain’t forget 😐
I still would like to see the swatch models with different skin tones tbh... not just the same girl with the same skin tone 🙃
Just give me one jewel from that dress and I can run away and start a new life in Canada instead of dying of doing this job forcefully
Wtf? When gaga do this alternate cover art for stupid love?
I’m blaming YouTube for creating this person
No one:  Me: I'd pay extra if it vibrated.
The actual lipstick looks very Pat McGrath to me... the texture. 🤔
IM SO EXCITED!!!
He’s made no effort to change time and time and time and time again and you still forgive him. At this point nothing will make you hold him accountable. I hope 75k of you don’t consider yourselves allies, cus you’re not.  It’s just makeup, it shouldn’t be so hard to let it go
Facebook doesnt want you to see this video https://youtu.be/EB0gVgxTQOs
I Love JEFFREE STAR’S makeup it is the best
The way he uses his lavender shade like a crayon 11:15
I have to have the pure hell shade. As soon as I get some extra money ill be buying jeffree star makeup. And the drill seargent shade!
NO ONE IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE CALLS BLACK WOMEN RATS AND HAS ONE IN A TRAP FOR THIS LAUNCH?
Love love love the hair. 💋💋💋💋💋
damn, I wish I knew lip ammunition was going to get discontinued before
😩😩😩 ugh I really want a mystery box 😪😪 I’ll wait until Christmas mystery box’s
Love the nails 🤩😍😍💝
Notice how he only posts a video right before his launches now what happened to being a YouTuber
Blackpink has join to the chat!!!
I like that Jeffree's lainching regular lipstick instead of lip gloss or liquid lipstick. I like a bullet the best.
Cant wait for the blood money palette!!!
QUEEN IS BACK
Can't wait to buy this collection at TJ Max
Wow
Eggs... bacon... grit............
https://youtu.be/eNhxalLY33U
https://youtu.be/eNhxalLY33U
https://youtu.be/eNhxalLY33U
Anyone else thought the print looked like a vainy you know what? 😂 gonna have to try and snag one!
Just here to downvote this toxic hellspawns post.
I love how he went from posed perfectly to chillin like a kid with his Christmas gifts (the muster boxes)
I’m hurt that he didn’t include Doll Parts😔
All I can think is it's a Hank And Henry copy -
Y’all who are still supporting him are part of the problem. He has barely apologized for his actions and it’s unacceptable. We need an apology!!
Did you know on app call joom is sell your product
Confused... i love the product but cruelty free and they’re using a bear trap for the campaign.   That and masks are worn a majority of the time now
Is the "retirement Center" TJ MAXX and Marshalls?  I lost my job recently and I could use the discount. LOL Look at your cheeks and face, and skin, how healthy and gorgeous your face looks. So beautiful. Bulletproof mama! Oh... that red though! Red is becoming one of the most rare colors in nature. That pigment? Gorgeous. I haven't seen a red like that. Beautiful. And look at the product itself. The little monograms. Holy moly. Beauty.  Nobody in the business does this like you Jeffree. No one.
lowkey just here to dislike the video lmao
is this kind of like how you used to "trap" men in your home by drugging them when they were unwilling to sleep with you? no? just lipstick? OK just checking.
WOW!! Love the new Lipsticks!! The Dark purple and the perfect Red are stunning, betta be ready 'cause those are going to fly out in seconds!! You can't deny it, Jeffree Star Cosmetics it's Dope AF!!  Imma snatch my Deluxe Mistery  box too!
Nooooo I needed time to save up money
Shane’s gone yet you’re still here. Bring shane and jenna back. Sick of y’all.
I know your a guy
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7jYEGj5QJDaK69tep_0neA
😭Jeffree why do you do this to me! Now I'm gonna need these too. I'm gonna need to file bankrupt because of my addiction for your products.
😍😍😍😍
I’m debating hating him or hating him for drama but still watching his videos
This set reminds me of Blackpinks music video Kill This Love where they have a heart shape trap that they dance on.
It looks cheap
The new velvet trap packaging looks like a bullet vibrator 👀 not sure if that was on purpose but I stan
The mouse trap reminds me of "kill this love" set from blackpink mv. Nothing new. Am i right blinks ?
I can't wait to Get some of these! They look amazing 🤩💄💋
I wanna coat my body In this formula
Jeffree: “ you can see all the pigment in ONE SWIPE “  ( also jeffree : does 4 swipes for each lipstick ) 😂
https://youtu.be/NI3fp98bntw
His trap thing looks like blackpinks kills this love music video trap
Ish did that
Why did u always have to do the mystery boxes when I am broke lol
No good
Are you a male ?
The echo is is a true representation of his Channel. No one is watching *echo* *crickets*
OH HELL NAW
Wow good job sister i like  https://www.youtube.com/c/Gyangunkakuraharu
When you still can't afford any of it 😂😂 they're nice tho!! Congrats on new lip stick launch
More luxurious " plastic"  is still plastic. I love Jeffrey, would've loved to see him do eco-friendly products.
This is epic!!
Talk about "Trap" lmfao
This black is insane 🖤🖤🖤🖤  Definitely i buy that...
Very nice
CANCEL
I can't feel my left foot
Jeffree : posts one vid after months of nothing  Also Jeffree: immediately posts another one trying to sell something.    Typical 🙄 He getting so fake  Disappointing
Ewww you guys are really out here pretending he shouldn't be held accountable huh...so disappointed, I dont like cancel culture but keep letting shit like what he's done slide and we'll just keep going downhill
You can hate on him all you want but we can all agree that Jeffree is an amazing businessman.
These lipsticks are more pigmented than paints I'll start painting with them
I love them queen, keep up the amazing work
Wow... Whats the name of that black girl? Jesus she is PERFECT. Im really impress how stunning she looks
Long story short I love his nails !!<3
Also, waiting for the skin care line.
I need them all!!! Lol even tho my lips are small I’d wear every single one lol
Lol jeffree has the army green and lipstick called drill sgt and me being in the army I think it’s so hilarious to see but I love it😂
How mean of them to have told you to, shut your trap, when everyone knows it's your legs you have to keep closed -
Mad echo in this velvet trap set
Everyone saying “omg he isn’t one swiping any of them!” He is clearly swatching brand new ass lipsticks that have some sort of texture on the outside. You have to warm the lipstick up first and get that outer layer off for it to swipe flawlessly.
I had an apocalyptic nightmare the other night. The streets were on fire and the sky was opening sucking people up and everyones question was 'where is Jefree star' next thing i know i see him in my dream alone shooting through the sky in a space ship. He bought his own planet and was leaving earth to occupy his own planet lmfao. We were all mad and confused that he didn't take anyone. Lmfao wild but probably will be a reality one day.
October 16'th,my Birthday!
Jeffreestar: Posts  Everyone: Lets scroll down through the comments
Okay there was a lot of things going around and i realized Shane Dawson's last video was 3 months ago and before the last 2 videos of Jeffree Starr's was 2 months ago. I honestly think the 2 people mentioned are still talking and i kinda feel like something's happening and they both have been planning it but Jeffree knew people would start getting suspicious so he thought to post before everyone finds out. I don't really like Jeffree as his mistakes made in the past and I know everyone makes mistakes but Jeffree's were all too much to handle and he was even being rude to his fans and was being quite selfish. Anyway hope you guys have a good day, like who you wanna like and that's all I'm saying.
I’m soooooooo excited! I want everything as always 😍
shut up and TAKE my money
Just as we suspected he made a release after drama 👊🏻🙄🙄🙄
So we're really gonna let him get away with all this?
jeffree stop. go. we don’t want you here,
😂😂😂Yall can never cancel this man. He survived being cancelled for so many years he’s so used to it. Keep trying tho.
It was the hair for me
I love your products 💕💕💕
Jeffree: talking about his impressive makeup Me: impressed and amazed he sat like that for so long
Your a magician jeffree my alchemist
hI HoW ARe YAaAaAaAaAAAaa
What time are they launching Friday????
❤❤❤
I've never tried any of JS make up line,are they any good???
Can’t wait to see people open every. My broke self will live through y’all! (Thanks COVID 🙄)
Is this guy-girl- whatever it is going to ever face the music?
Where are everyone’s masks?
Looks like those lipstick vibrators
Jeffree star, you and your models 100% killed the photo shoot.  Slay queen 👑👑👑
Wasn't this guy cancelled
https://youtu.be/k-_FYp56XpA
Will these be on beauty bay pleeeeaseee? X
I know 99% of you aren’t going to see this but I hope you have a good day and come closer to accomplishing your goals.
Classist rat
Guess he did that other video because he was going to sell something. Is this Jaclyn Hill?
The audacity smh
The magnet on the cap is SUCH a good idea
Ripping off Lisa Eldridge much?
What’s the name of the song you used
😍😍😍
WHAT is this terrifying creature???like how have we let this happen. Its Him from powerpuff girls. It's the cryptkeeper, the devil himself. And he is just casually on YouTube?? what the hell! Call the police
Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.    God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.
Jeffree.... how can you say your making the boxes affordable for people in a pandemic? The only affordable one would be the $20 one like 80% of your buyers are kids the parents won't be able to  afford 60 and 100 bucks just for boxes not to mention the greedy people out there who buy all 3 boxes
Hello and all the best from Europe, Romania, So cool to see you back & positive, I hope  you and your dear ones stay healthy. For your products congratulations, it is such a pitty that we can not wear globally makeup anymore, specially lipstick, being responsible and wearing the mask at work, on the street, actually all day long. Let's hope that treatment will be discovered soon and the globe will start to get better in time. Take care of you 🌈
Oh my God!! I'm so gonna buy those JS Velvet Trap Lipsticks on your website on Friday!! I love that Huge Velvet Trap and the Sparkly Pink curtain in the background 💖. PLEASE FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER, Jeffree Star and Please see my comment 🙏. I can Relate to the photoshoot for the new Velvet Trap shades 📸 and can't wait to buy them on your website, Queen 👑
He does realize with people wearing masks they aren't gonna wear lipsticks as much.
Jeffree Star needs to hire a stylist... his whole brand is tacky af
So everyone all of a sudden forgot how much of a terrible person he is?🤨 Chileeeee ....
OMG I can't wait to try this ney formula! The details are amazing and the shooting is insane. Love Jeffree and Jeffree Star Cosmetics!
People going off about drama. I literally give no shits. I'm here for the make-up.
How many times he said “of course”?
She is so cute 😍
I don't even like jeffree anymore but I always believe in separate the art from the artist
Not gonna lie, the packaging looks really good
Okay but is it mask proof?
🤢🤮
imagine building a whole giant bear trap for a single video
Yesss-finally a cool-toned pinky nude! I have been waiting on you to do this!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Your  gay
Gay
So new concept is a symbol of animal cruelty... 🙄
Trixie probably already bought every hot commodity available
Hello hi how are ya jefree !!! Please spend some time to explain yourself ...IT IS MUCH NEEDED
I have a question for you who believe that there’s no God and that nothing made the universe. If this is true. Then if God is no-thing and therefore is nothing. Then can’t the universe come from him?  Also if you believe that the universe is infinite; then how is it that our bodies are part of the universe whilst our consciousness is also part of our bodies whilst our consciousness came into existence via our birth? This means that our consciousness is finite because it began, there for our bodies are finite and finally the universe MUST be finite...
jeffree: you only need one swipe also jeffree: does 10 swipes per swatch
Kill this love vibes🤔 (the trap)
Lovesss these! Scrolling the comments lookn for the name of the song
Black pink vibes
Jeffree: *is rich* Also Jeffree: *terrible echo-ie audio*
Beautiful! Thank you for NOT participating in cancel culture. Only way to stop the craziness is to ignore the crazies.
I was just watching your vids last night &+ you posted this new vid yay 😍
I love the pink
Chicos y chicas llequeeee
Best keep that magnet away from your credit cards....
OMG OMG OMG !!!!! I LOOOVE IT
He might be in a lot of issues... but you can’t lie, his products are top tier
Weirdo
You can say what  you wanna say about him but his products are great and don’t cost a fortune. I mean what’s stopping other cosmetic companies from making high end products with a good price point? Oh I forgot profit!!!!
Crazy how y'all know hes a bigot, but still support him, even blast his videos to the trending page. But the moment there is some drama, everyone is on Jeffree and he should be cancelled. Lol the hypocrisy of the internet just makes me laugh.
What are the model with tatto? It’s for research
Watching him sit like that is making my knees hurt.
why jafar always sitting like that
A reason why I hate Jeffree star because he takes Real animal fur which is wrong animal abuse Jeffree star please stop you’re hurting good animals please stop
jeff im in confution are you a boy or a girl  by the way i named you bogril🤓
jeffree is basically trump in the beauty industry.
Honestly I don’t use makeup but that lipstick is hands down the coolest thing I’ve seen today.
No puedo esperar a que Rosy McMichael los compre y se los pruebe todos! 🤭🤩
Jeffree feat Pabblo Vittar
No thanks, I'd rather not buy makeup from a r4-pist.
Wait....Jeffree bear bait ? That poor Bear ! Lol 😆
Jeffree: you only need one swipe  Everyone: nah ah  that was three swipes  lol  Jefferey: psych, you only need one
You are a boy?!
Literally the only reason I went to work today was to be able to hopefully afford these GORGEOUS fkn products. I would die for those mystery boxes 😭
Thought it was a scene from jaws...lol
I get paid this Friday but jeeeeeesus I gotta catch up on bills finally 😩😩😩 sometime in the future I’ll definitely purchase these babies 😍😍😍
Trash
Wait Jeffree are you going to be shipping to Canada?

https://youtu.be/yzsSAawFWfA
ew lol
OMGawd I’m Obsessed with your ruby slipper nails, Jeffree!! ❤️💅🏻❤️💅🏻❤️💅🏻❤️  I also like the new Velvet Trap reds, browns, and cool toned nudes. 💄 I may need to get the Like Hell shade for my Cremated palette. I’m low on funds, but I’ll be collecting those! Is that a new mirror shade next to your right leg?
Jeffree Star literally just had a bunch of drama then 2 weeks later a product launch. Werk!
I love you Jeffree! I hope to buy these some day just with my budgeting its been hard but I hope to purchase your products again!!
What the
If you’re bored, check out my tiktok compilations!!!
BRO THIS MAN IS COMPLETE TRASH
He is shady/mean/drama queen but he truly knows how to run a brand
ITS SO BEAUTIFUL
Who’s not going to buy it ✨🤗❤️
Last video he says we all thought he was back to sell something so he gives a tour of his house again and get pierced then posts a video selling something....
Honey suck me shade .... yup. Can’t wait for my niece to ask her mom for that shade
Red lips with my hair color? Hmmm
Sassy
How people can support this offensive, ignorant narcissistic is beyond me. Gross.
The retirement centre, aka: Marshall’s 🤣
Okayyy Jaclyn Hill🙄
I really Hope i can get my hands in one of the mystery boxes! They are my favorite! 📦 🎃🦇🖤
Hey Mr. Owl, how many videos do people need to watch to understand this man is as fake as they come?
Jeffree selling lipsticks when everybody wears face masks, okay :D
It's launching on my birthday 🎂
The girl in this video uses Jeffrey products📷https://youtu.be/I7gn3l2NsV4
May God Bless you for knowledge and truth, In Jesus name. Amen😊😊
the new lipstick design remind me of kylie’s skincare
My birthday is 10/16 :)
wait hold on people still support him?
I’m waiting for Jeffree to create liquid foundation. THEN! And only THEN will I call Jeffree Star Star Goddess if the product is Truly ORGASMIC
the way this is gonna sell out in minutes... he’s unstoppable
Wait... didn’t you slam Huda for copying Beauty Bakerie a few years ago? Because these lipsticks, from the magnetic component to the velvet texture to some of the colors is identical to Lisa Eldridge’s Velvet lipsticks. Maybe a bit of a double standard 😬
All of them are sooo beautiful omg!
Omg that red hair on you>>>>>
Mr.Star ⭐️ came thruuuuu hunnie🤎
I so badly want that trap to go off.
Is it just me who wants literally all of these 😍 im cryingggg 😭♥️
When the MUAS wear CHIN DIAPERS!
Low-key getting shopping channel vibes
Not y’all still supporting him
She's like the 5th richest YouTuber 🔥👌btw the likes an dislikes mean nothing
To all the haters, thanks for taking your time here. I know you love him as much as i do lol..if not, why even show up?
Should I quit youtube
Wtf i just opened YouTube
ah can’t wait to see all of these comments disappear mysteriously. a bigger mystery than the mystery boxes.
Looks like greenscreen 😂
Love your products and im a guy hahaha !! intresting Bawse !
https://youtu.be/PsIkfUv3ZDo
As someone with shaky hands due to a neurological disorder, the magnet is actually a blessing. I have ruined so many lipsticks from sticking the lid in the product itself. I can't wait. :)
When you legitimately are on the brink of the Hunger Games.
Please bring back thick as theives it was my perfect nude lipstick 😭 i can’t get any quality like jeffrey
Sounds stuffy.  Too much face surgery, or a cold?
Yooo why does JS look like Justina valentine with that red color wig!!!!!!!
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈Non-Duality
When his cosmetics are top tier yet still manage to price lower than kylie's.
Jeffreestar: Posts  Everyone: Lets scroll down through the comments
Mystery boxes?
Amazing pallet.
Jeffree is the new Jaclyn.
yeah another drama comes, cruelty free comsetics and "trap" lipsticks with gigant animal trap in video
He really did address some shit just to sell some shit lol
Midevil kiss ,wow!
Help I'm scared what's happened to his face
Can we talk about how BEAUTIFUL earrings look on Jeffree Lynn!!!
I- so did y'all forget all the horrible things Jeffree has done?
That coral is fabulous
Davina De Campo...who’s wearing a red wig and a silver dress now!
All the lipsticks are beautiful!
i bet the money doesn't go to charity
From which country all are???write in comments    I am from India anyone else from India too
Love that light pink.so pretty.naked body,omg.
ok am i the only one who doesn't really care about the drama
Love the makeup and obsessed with the song.  Who is that?
lordy he doesn't sound like he is in a good mood at the start wtf!!!!!!!!
As a vegan brand it’s a bit weird that the theme of this involves a bear trap .. or is that just me ?
Guess which one I want
OMG! Thank you for using our song AFTERLIFE, Jeffree! This is so cool! XOXO- EMM and Besomorph
He's becoming the new Jaclyn and only coming back to sell something. Everyone, plz think about where your money is going and not buy it. And before the assistant deletes my comment, let me just get a final: Hi, how are ya?
Oh my god...... That's just perfect I'm shaking
Wouldn’t never support this fake trash 🗑 🤢
Ugh the people here are so stupid. This asshole is gonna trend everything time he makes a video. I’m not for cancel culture but seriously, Jeffree should’ve been canceled a long time ago. This is so disappointing
I was just wondering are 'the perfect red' and 'redrum' shades the same or the perfect red is an entirely different and new shade?
Looks like a Lady Gaga stage. 🤷🏼‍♂️
Oh.. he is alive..
https://album.link/i/1534824985
He posted this a day before my birthday 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺💗💗💗💗
What’s on his lips😫 I need !
Who else came to see the ad 👀💖 Lolol
wait yall are still supporting him?! yikes. big yikes.
So I guess he is not cancelled??? What te fuck are we doing
https://youtu.be/HP9zfhlHsnA Biswas hi nhi hota itna sundar jagah ho v skta❤️
The way people still watch jeffree oof
Love not seeing anyone expect one person with a mask on. Atleast if you aren’t going to do a shoot with masks on atleast has the crew have then on so they can be safe. We are in a pandemic
Just an opinion. Low key bored of the over the top sets. Kinda miss Jeffree filming himself in a little studio
Garbage
Be Muslim  you can success
Love the new lineup, I will definitely be picking up the black and that gorgeous grey color. I really think you should do a eye liner lineup, would be cool to see how creative you get with the colors and packaging.
“If you scared color: can’t relate “
I hate that I want these
Ekkkk can’t wait for these!
BMW i8 Review https://youtu.be/wpZibZr3liE
I dieeedddd with this collection omg so pretty u all haters can go to hell, i love his products they work on me unlike any others.
A teenaged girl called me out at a restaurant for wearing my jawbreaker hoodie. Lol I was like I ain’t buying anything new from him but I’ll be damned if I’m not gonna wear my expensive ass merch and makeup
OOF. I wish I had a den like that. 😭😭
Amazing!! So excited. Have you ever thought of doing some kind of compostable packaging for your lipsticks?
Girl I ain't living for this ECHO
Please stop supporting racists and putting money in their pocket
You're a multimillionaire. Fix the echoing sound. Buy some $1 sound cushions or something. How embarrassing
I love the fact that he's showing the makeup on different shades of dark skin as well. I was wondering how it'd look on me <33
queen
Your marketing campaign are always stunning omg
I want to be a JEFFREE STAR model 😿😿😿
Jefree star really said ✨GLOWUP✨
I wish they were all wearable colors, only a few are nice and the rest I'd never wear because.. why and where
I am not sure how,but through everything ppl put you, you always are absolutely stunning.  Thank you for being you. Much Love 😁😁😁😁
I’m loving the nails. I could go for another nail vid
Renault Megane Sport Rs Review https://youtu.be/WDthYzRrGFE
Trust me, save your money! You can go to the drugstore and get a better lipstick!
i am loving the hot pink track suit and the jeweled red nails. And the baby pink harness looked phenomenal on the model's deep skin tone.
Bruh i tried sitting like jeffree with that pose on my bed, bitch how tf u do it?
Only one swipe. The swipe: 👈 👉 👈 👉 👈
Was it just me or is the audio not in sync with the video.
Wonderful.
Jeffree: talking about the lipstick  Me: looking at his nails the whole time
Love every single color!! Go offfffffff Jeffree 💗💗
https://youtu.be/HBdrDRAPC94
The worst timing for launching lipsticks. Everybody wearing facemasks!!! This was not your year Jeffree!!
Damn....that hot pink.....I need that in my life ASAP. That’s the mood I’m trying to emulate for 2021.
Patriarchy working as it should.
Imma try to get a mystery box, I’ve always wanted one! And since Halloween is my favorite holiday, I’m going to try to get one lol
Oh God, I really do want to buy a mystery box! They are calling my name 😭😭😭
They are so beautiful, congrats! xx
https://youtu.be/RLnnriyNjyg انا لا احب اسمي واحب ما انا به
Can I be one of your models please and thank you 😍
Holy shit is he extra. Lmfao. Love him.
Jafar, who are you fooling?We knew the relationship was fake.Man was just looking for a bag.
Hmm is he using the same method as apple phone boxes?🤔 If so, brilliant!
Ok I'm gonna get the perfect red and mid evil
I just know his legs MUST hurt
GIRL! Your hair like this is perfection 🤯🤩🔥🔥
🤮
Kis kis for allat kis vidoe plaece subscrib
Thank you for swatching these together and describing each shade!  It really helps to choose shades.
Who else just came straight to the comments? 👀
A M A Z I N G !!!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻♥️😍
Me wearing these under my mask at work: 👁👄👁
IM SOOOO CRAZY TO SEE YOU ABT YOUR PRODUCT  LOVE U OXOX
Diarrhea
So it’s true. You do only post when you’re selling something. I watched your last video and thought it was better then your product videos. Money won’t last forever. Memories will. I would vlog more like you did in the last video and not only when you’re coming out with a new product. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Miss your lip swatches ....plz make one vid for lips swatches 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jeffrey star is the willy Wonka of makeup
Lisa Eldridge has something exactly like this with the velvet textured lipstick. Interested to compare
Is this just me but this reminds me of black pink “kill the love” MV
Quality is always on point and so affordable.. 😍😍😍
i rly wanna get the "celebrity skin" shade of lip gloss omggggg
When you copy Lisa Eldridge....
💋 HELLO  HOW ARE YA💄
Kinda feel guilty that I want those lipsticks....
Why is this recommended to me
Imagine if that trap closed on him😂 that would be great lmao
Just for my birthday!!
Yessssss Jeffrey Star knows how to discount and knows his formulas she killled that shit
So beautiful
What’s the point of lipstick right now when we have to wear a mask everywhere we go🤷🏼‍♀️ I love your stuff Jeffrey but you should’ve came out with some more eyeshadows or something we can see outside of the masks 🤷🏼‍♀️
It’s been tough and rough.
The new one looks cheaper than the old one
HE ALMOST MADE MY FRIEND JAMES CHARLES KILL HIMSELF AND HE LAUGHEDDDDDDDDD AND DID NOT APOLOGIZE
YOU ARE GIVING THIS HORRIBLE MAN ENCOURAGEMENT TO CONTINUE SLAUGHTERING PEOPLE’S INNOCENT HEARTS
Oh his bg is cute
Pure hell reminds me of hell beach in 🇰🇾 Caymon Islands. The sand is a luscious black.
HE ENDING JAMES FOR NO REASONNN AND IS GETTING AWAY WITH ITTTTTT
WHY DO PEOPLE LIKE THIS MAN IT MAKES ME SICK
Holy fuck he has millions of subs
I love the makeup hate him xoxo
Did he get that bear trap from the set of Kill This Love
Demon lord oml
WATCH “NO MORE LIES”
WATCH “NO MORE LIES”
WATCH “NO MORE LIES”
Brown lipstick is gross.
Need more everyday colors
I love how he is just casually sitting in a giant bear trap like that's a normal thing to do
I love these lipsticks however wearing face masks everywhere we go kind of makes it useless to even wear since we can’t even show it off.
Oh my god, I would say the iPhone 12 Pro price is available on the link to the video announced in the video! https://ay.link/pYp6
Daddys trending again! Love ya mama
I would love to try the bleu color, even as an “old” woman 🥳😅...JEFFREE!    U should also use women or men above a certain age in your advertisement!!!! There are a lot of colorful older lady’s and gents these days.  Would love to see a 85 year old wearing your makeup 🥰🥰🖤❤️🧡💛💚💙🤎🤍
https://youtu.be/q9irasZr7-g
I thought i was called velvet TRAP cause...you know.........lol i think you know...
the fact that I cant order anything from America because customs in Germany are crazy...
The lipstick cases kind of look like little d*cks. I'm totally OK with that
Seeing all of these beautiful shades breaks my heart cause I’m not wearing lipsticks with having to wear masks all the time 😭
YOU SHOULD BE WEARING MASKS. NO NEED FOR LIPSTICK. Instead help us in the fight links below😂😂👌🏽      https://youtu.be/0NphaDU2KE8
This set looks absolutely ridiculous 😂 just no not it
It's funny how people on Twitter were saying "he only uploads when he wants to sell something"... and in his last video he debunked that claim..... and after months of not uploading, he makes this video 💀💀(idk pink seems sus ,vote him out)
I love the AMunition packaging, I don’t feel the same with the new line 😬
I thought he was cancelled?
Um that photography and imaging was flawless
LITERALLY CAME BACK TO SELL SOMETHING. LMAO STUPID
Still love you. I know youre not an evil person. Just misunderstood. Thanks for the great makeup.
😍😍😍😍😘
So excited for the mystery boxes!!
In his last video he's so offended that people are saying he only comes on YouTube to sell new products and here he is doing that exact thing 😂
💝💜💗Love you jeffree ❗️💜💗💝
Everyone wearing their masks on their chins....goddammit people
https://youtu.be/0Whw54bZuew
I love it but Lisa Eldridge did this velvet lip technology 2 years ago.... kinder feels like an imitation of her work to me. Even down to references velvet fabric. Embossed logos look fire though.
What kind of clownery is this HELP 😭😭😭😭
Haters keep him motivated
I am gagging😍😍😍
blody hell I love velvet everything now this has got to be amazing
My birthday is on the 16th and i love the lipstick
Stfu
I'm not hating... BUT why are people so surprised and amazed over those colors, there not new you can get those colors at your local drug store or high end.
Why tf do you sit like that
So pretty!
Is this going to be on beauty bay in the UK?
Like.. noone cares anymore
My new Hendrix cover https://youtu.be/illcNVdIhM0
Finally a release I’m exciting about 👏🏻 someone to look forward to this period 😊
Why do u come out with new stuff every time there’s a scandal involving you??? 🤣🤣🤣
No One: ... Jeffree:  👁👄👁 STUnning
So the bf and the drama was just for this? What a fraud
https://youtu.be/dKcTQohpIeM
Can’t wait to pick up Firestarter!! 🤩😍
Claim your "here before he turns off the comments" ticket here
Claim your "here before the new controversy" ticket bere
Omfg I want that hot pink one!!!!!
Only people who didn’t come from tiktok are worthy of liking this comment
The product looks great. I just wish the model shoot had size inclusivity.
he didnt say what time everything launches on friday?!
the bullet looks like bullet vibrator
Wow I just realised I've been a fan since I was 5 O-O
What time is the release on Friday?
They look like the colourpop lipsticks 🧐
Jeffree please save me two delux mystery boxes for my girls!!!!!  Thank you!!! We love youa
Jeffrey: And it's called Drill Sergeant   Me remembering my Drill Sergeants at basic: *I got PTSDdDdDdDdDdD* 🎶
"you're gonna gag for this formula"........
Omg I need all of them 😭
Sisters
Jeffree was my fav but his make up is the same and boring now plus he left YouTube for a while bc of the scandal soo yeah let me sip my tea .. I ain’t a fan no more but I just wanted to see what he has to say
I like jeffree im sure he would love to be as perfect as all of you criticizing Him.
Nobody wants to buy your junk Jeffree. People aren't even wearing lipsticks anymore- let alone full face makeup at all. Get with the times, old man.
Blackpink kill this love?
Jeffery should make some face masks
I love lipsticks like this, but they never last longer than 10 seconds on me :(
I feel like she's been hanging with miss laganja
Check out my book on my channel
what's the music in time 5:00 ?
I love the fucking red!!! So beautiful
Jesus is coming   It isn’t too late to go back to him
so happy the mystery box time of the year is here!!!!
People get over to brand new tube and watch the doctors speaking out against the Corona virus hoax and search Dr Vernon Coleman.com and research agenda 21 😉
Jeffery.. the new bullet lipstick design looks bomb 🥺 your makeup looks the best every time.
and just like that y'all forgot smh..
ICONIC❤❤❤❤
STUNNING!
Lipsticks are beautiful but the launch is happening when we have to wear face masks 🤷🏻‍♀️
We love Jeffree ❤️😍
Drama or no drama Jeffrey Star continues! He is focused on his business and I get him! Developing these products doesnt take weeks... it must have taken him years, honestly. He is proud of his work and so am I! He works really hard and we have to give him credit for that aside from all the drama which I dont even follow tbh.
So I have to be honest I've only ever had  1 Jeffrey Star product..  But I want every one of these lipsticks they looked amazing!!
Jesus Christ is coming soon
1 Corinthians 15:1-4  King James Version  15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
A pile of skulls in a corner with the bullet lipstick surrounding them like empty shell casings would have been cool.
He looks sad than before. His eyes are sad.
Creepy
kylie skin
Didn’t he pay off minors that he fooled around with ?
why he keep doing more than ONE swipe? momma.world
Im excited but sad cuz I love the lip ammo
I’m excited about the mystery boxes!!!!
Jeffrey, how come you never use Hispanics and Asians as your models in any of your campaigns? You once said you want your makeup to work for every race and every color in this world so that everyone can enjoy them but your campaign doesn’t go hand in hand with what you’re saying.
Right after drama ofc
beautiful!
*Jeffree I fuckin cried for u when u came to the mall*
Every time I see Jeffrey star I imidetly think that he is a snake and it makes me want to punch him
Jeffree really tryin to pull a Jaclyn Hill on all of us
I miss his previous shooting format
Would love to see more product reviews! Skincare and makeup. 🧖🏻‍♀️💄
Stunning!!! Love the background production footage.  To be on his PR List... 😘❤️ I wish on his star!!! I’d LOVE to show his lip products! Omgoodness... “honey, suck me” YES!!!! ❤️❤️❤️ I love this shade! They’re all awesome! LIVING!!!! ❤️❤️❤️ I hope he comes out with more lip scrubs 🥺😌❤️⭐️🙌 wow his mystery boxes.... giiiirl I need a Red Bull 🤩🤩🤩
so happi for jefferee m a huge a fan much luv from canada saskaaatoon sask
This comment section is gross.
I am ao broke but I AM DYING TO HAVE THESE!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm so excited for this launch but I really wish he'd give us more of a heads up so we could budget/save accordingly. I'll still be able to get some stuff but had I of had time to plan and save I could have gotten a lot more.
Jeffree you should do an advent calendar for holidays 👍🏻🗓️🎄
I love how she used one of the mirrors as a drink coaster hahhah LOVE THE NEW SHADES BTW 🔥🔥🔥 especially the browns ☺️😍
Hey ❤️I hope you’re having a great day.  Hopefully this comment gives you hope. The state of the world is alarming. Many people feel uneasy about everything that’s going on. The root of every single problem is evil aka sin. Any of us could die any second but where would we go after? Well, because of our sin and evil ways, we deserve to go to hell. The Bible states in Romans 6:23 “For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” BUT WAIT! I have some good news for you. God has offered us a chance to go to heaven and have everlasting life by sending his only Son Jesus Christ into the world to die on the cross for our sins. John 3:16 says “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” That was a true display of love. Repent and Surrender your life to Christ today before it’s too late.
Gorgeous!!!! Being released on my 22nd birthday....Gutted i cant afford anything though x
It launches on my birthday
Mia Maples should be ready on friday! I will definitely expect another Jeffree Star Cosmetics unboxing on her channel. 😍
Ngl the lipstick looks like a straight up vibrator 👀👀
lovey
I WANT IT
Jefree makes Barbie's pink color look like the most luxurious thing I'll ever own
🖤🖤🖤🍂🍁✨🎃🌙
I bet u are not in full screen
Is this content even relevant to real life issues ? 🤔
Just remember Jesus is coming back soon. Ps I was hoping that rat trap would shut.
The end is no longer near; the end is now HERE!  Tomorrow may be too late for you; no one is guaranteed tomorrow. We are all sinners and the wages of sin is eternal death in hell! REPENT and ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST as your saviour today in 3 simple steps:  A - Accept that you are a sinner in need of a saviour B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, died and shed his blood for our sins, buried, resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God C - Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is lord of your life.
Anyone else confused by how the set looks? I presume hes really sitting in that trap but maybe its something in the lighting it looks like he's superimposed on the background
I really have no respect for him...
That greige is gonna sell fast.
💯 Can someone pull the clip so the massive bear trap actually closes???? Jk... but FR thooooo 💯💯💯💯🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨❤️😂
I am not going to pay it
💯😂🚨 Here before 1 million views used to be within 30 seconds now, it’s taking him days just to hit 1 million views. I love karma
It drops on my 21st birthday somebody send me some 🤣
So we just gunna forget this person is a pos 😂
This is such a rip off of Lida Eldridge lipsticks. She came up with the velvet texture idea. At least her products actually feel luxurious rather than tacky.
Even though I know of all the shit everyone’s been saying about him, mostly lies too, his passion and drive for makeup is inspiring and the products he creates are always beautiful. Everyone has stuff they’re not proud of from the past but what counts is the present moment and what you do to redeem yourself. Go Jeffree for not being phased by all the childish drama.
QUEEN OF BEAUTY PRODUCTSS!!! I wish one day I could buy JS cosmetics. 😩😩😩. There’s no any in my province.
I JUST FOUND JEFFREE STAR 2 MONTHS AGO. I AM LOVING EVERY BIT OF HIM. HOW CAN I GET ONE OF THESE OR AT LEAST A LIP COLOR!! FROM WHAT I HEAR THEY SELL OUT QUICK!
Girl can I have all that pink fabric when you're done with it????
This editing is so bad. Why is he being filmed from so far away especially during the swatches
Even if you don't like Jeffree Star, you have to admit  his products are Claire's quality but 10 times the price
I feel like JS has turned into one big advertisement
All the makeup artists wearing their masks around their chin like a chin strap SMH what's the point
Launching on my birthday! 🎉🎂 that’ll be my gift to myself 😋
WORK!!!!!!!
I really don't know if bringing out a lipstick collection at a time where we all have to wear masks in public is reasonable BUT they look so asthetically pleasing... i'll probably will purchase one of them 💄
your irrelevant snake 🐍
Tiny pink vibrator has entered the chat.
It would be really cool if the lipstick holder’s design is the same as the trap!  Cool design that will go perfectly with the lipsticks!
Thinking about reviewing this for my youtube channel 🤣🤣🤯😜
Is this the Weimar Republic?
why is it trending tho..
Anyone catch that watermelon soda swatch and reveal was probably accidentally edited out. I was trying to go back to see it swatched and can't find it. Damn
not yall supporting him🧍🏼‍♀️
What u gonna do apologize...
I know that there was a lot of diversity in the big photo shoots. But notice how there was absolutely NO diversity in the closeup pictures for the lipsticks. Uhm Chile anyways so...
Can anyone please tell me the song??
Blue Velvet by Lana Del Rey playing in the background.
can’t wait.
Who else noticed he *probably* only had one shoe on in the very beginning bc of the way he was sitting 👀
the first think that came to my mind when i saw do thumbnail was “ OMG KILL THIS LOVE BY BLACKPINK”
Its gonna be a no from me
Plz make me a deep burgundy marron.
Love the red bling nails💄👄🎈🍎🌹💗💋
Janet Jackson, Charlie Sheen, the Backstreet Boys, Jessica Biel, Smosh and Sean Connery. I take a great peace of mind knowing one day no one will care what this person says or does. Ha ha ha.
Lisa Eldridge did it first.... Next
Funny how his subscribers went from 17.2 to 17.1. How he tried to accuse James Charles... And use the drama for promoting his makeup collection with Shane.
You shouldn't sit like that, it's bad for your hips. And at your age... 😬
Magnet, unit carton, and embossing on the lipstick itself are similar to what Hermès did with their lipsticks that came out a couple months back.
You guys have to give it to Jeffree, though. He’s a marketing GENIUS, gorgeous look, great colors and an even better formula. He knows how to SELL things. His money and riches are well earned and no one can tell me otherwise. He claws his way to the top and I can’t hate on that.
Did I ask
https://youtu.be/Rjv_L3Zujpk
Is this Blackpink Kill This Love referenced 🤣
I wish I had money 🤪🤪😭😭😭😭
The models 😰😰😰😰🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I love makeup but it's just lipstick at the end of day and I have loads that I haven't used yet so I'll pass  Anyways its corona time people  are getting unemployed , underplayed wouldn't consider to buy useless luxury yall who still wondering should also not waste money can just literally donate it someone in need maybe they could buy food for one time rather than to someone who had big ass multimillion dollar empire and 3 lambo on the side
Covid...
y'all switch up so quick.
Jeffree your makeup is everything🥰
Hey Jeffree hopefully you are reading my comment ☺️ I am your big fan. I love all your new lipsticks 😍 I have seen all your videos. Your gorgeous my dear
this set tho!!
Jeffree Im seriously gonna need to see you play with Colorpop’s Hocus Pocus collection soon 👀
jeffree is a terrible person, but you can not say his makeup sucks.
Can someone  tell me more about the shooting's SONG .. it was so good 😍😍
Trending 🗑
I told you if you just got back to the makeup you'd be back. Million views. Good for you.
JS make up is amazing i wish he would just focus on making make up and stop all the drama , he is really one of the powerful influenceur and beaty guru in the world , i really want to give his make up another chance but i'm scared other drama will pop
There are a million lipstick formulas but bitch they’re not jeffree star🤘🏻
BTS ( BEHIND THE SCENES ) https://youtu.be/1Uxcmw-ee_U
What a waste of life
When’s that glam and gore video getting removed after all that shit she talked I’m surprised her homophobic ass is still on your page
uh sis dont forget ur still canceled
Ok, i only watched 3mins so far, absolutely no hate to Jeffrey, but i kinda think if ppl saw it in your bag, they might think it is a vibrator..... And i hope the new formula will be more hydrated, i have both the bullet one or the liquid but both are still too dry for me 😕 ok, get back to the video 🤣😂
YEEEESSS BITCH!! I can not wait
It baffles me how he still has supporters ❤️
“Even if you don’t like him his makeup is bomb 😝😝😩😩❤️❤️” Yes you can admit his makeup is bomb, but buying your makeup from somebody like him? Think about that for a min
Okey but isnt this just a ripoff off BLACKPINK...
ye
How can you even dislike Jeffree? He’s a true artist.
forget the rest, but them red nails:O:P:P
I’d kill to to be a Jeffery Star lipstick model or even just to have Jeffery do my make cause like QUEEN
Delicious Jeffree 👏 👏 👏 those lips are perfect...ordering !!!!!
i’m in love with the mideval kiss. omg so pretty
Weird shit!
😁😁😁😁😁
What is the mystery box going to be?!! Let’s speculate
the shade unfazed is definitely giving baby shit vibes
Wow @lisaeldridge formula is stolen
An animal trap? Really?  SMDH
Jeffree : I don’t make drama for the new launch  Next day :  Also Jeffree : I’m not here to selling anything just to talk Next video:
Yeah cause there’s not enough lipsticks out there 💄
i can't wait to try them 😍😍😍😍😍🙌🏻🖤
Amazing
the numbers of masks on set😻😹
DO THE ONE DIP CHALLENGE
Je
I love ua vdos so much
Meatcanyon
The set is great⭐
Love these colours and I don’t wear lipsticks, but would so get the lot 💄💋
Honey suck me is my favorite colored one🥰🥰😍
Jeffree, maybe drama and relationships aren't for you but businesswoman and makeup is definitely your thing. Just focus on that and your life will run smoother.
We’re really not going to call him out for ripping off Lisa Eldeidges velvet lipsticks? Down to the textured lipstick? OK.
Jeffree’s energy seems off in this vid❤️hope everything’s ok
for sure,his makeup is so luxurious and cute but bitch my house has enough makeup for now...
I don't even wear makeup, butthis makes me want to buy it
Is this a green screen?
It’s the new formula for me
Jeffree! I would really need to finical help right about now. I always enter your giveaways but unfortunately I havent won. God knows I really need this. And I hope you can see this and help me out. Would be a dream and so much needed. Love you 💖 oh and love the new collection 😍
Is it just me or are we missing a swatch for Watermelon Soda?? 🤔😂 so stoked for this line!
Omg! I’m definitely buying my mom one of these for Christmas! 🤍🤍🤍
Colors are stunning
Let’s kill this love🎵
Hate him!!! But he is fcking kill it ¡ ¡
I can’t concentrate with the set and background 😂
Oh my God I am so shook I love IT
We cant wear lipstick nowadays because of masks 😷
congrats jeffree star. sending love from indonesia <3
Those nails though !!!
October 16th! I’ll be there mama!
Damn, the creativity is amazing!
I CANT WAIT AGHHH
I don't have money lololol Iltsm tho <333
I hate that people are putting him down for taking the small business help offered during the pandemic (cough cough Adam McIntyre cough cough) Jeffree gave so much of his OWN money out to people who needed it during this difficult time and from what I understand,  took care of his employees.   Jeffree might get involved in drama but he has a good heart. Not to mention one helluva business man.
Love the packaging
James Charles: wait aren’t you cancelled   Jeffree star: hold my mirror
Can't wait to buy them that's SCREAMS  AMAZINGGGGG
The fact that Jeffrey stole the bear trap from Blackpink Kill This Love hahahaha no kidding it looks a bit different we stan him and his sets!
Definitely getting a lipstick the just not budgeted for the mystery boxes. Thought it would be a little less but that’s okay.
damn baby these are so beautiful and amazing. The models are freaking gorgeous too. 😍😍😍 love you so much!
Still waiting for blush, bronzer, contour, foundation, mascara, eyeliner, etc...
You ' re cringy and your bear trap is too big.
Please. Please release an eyeliner set. I'm allergic to most makeups and I've noticed that your makeup doesn't cause any reactions! I've used all of your pallettes and both of your lipsticks with no problems.
this formula looks incredible! i'm disappointed that there weren't more nudes - all the nudes included in the collection currently are too light for my skin tone. i can sometimes get away with celebrity skin in the winter when i'm a little more pale, but for the most part it's too light. hopefully we'll have some more options within the next couple of months because i'm dying to get my hands on these!
Even if you don’t like him, his makeup is quality. You gotta use the separate art from artist thing in this case.
Me thinking this is lovely.... but also how are we suppose to wear lipstick with a mask...
Why is audio quality mic so low?!
Fully in love with Jeffree's new security system. Put that outside JCHeadquaters and then watch someone try and rob you again, love it
OMG thats curly red wig in the photoshoot looked SO DAMN GOOD Jeffree! <3
Medieval kiss looks like a black cherry. Mmmm I'm going to be getting that.
Im dying for these lipsticks but I'm sad cause I can't wear it  Yes you can see it if you go out and eat and drink but like, who in the hell would wear lipstick now when 99% of the time it's underneath a sweaty mask?
Naked body shade is the most beautiful nude I’ve ever seen! 💛
I love this because honestly the old formula was a bit drying for me so this looks much more creamy! Always got such captivating makeup 💄
The thing jefree is sitting on looking like kill this love from blackpink
I think he needs to change his camera man
I want that stoner one
Me: That wasn't one swipe...? Jeffree: I know the first one was three don't clock me... Also Jeffree: Swipes again with amazing payoff!! 😍
Jeffree should come out with a foundation!
I'm loving the hair colors❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hitting the like button just bc of the trap prop
I can’t wait to wear lipstick again! When the pandemic is over I’m buying all the lipsticks!
Girrrrl hoping to get a mystery box this year 🤞🏽
Why are all his intros so iconic with the setting of it
"Unfazed" ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  Wow!
I love everything you do honestly
Jesus <3 yaaas!
Girl!!!! Love'n the new lipsticks👄 Buttttt sis can we get a video of Miss Lynn just sitting down & playing in makeup!!??🙏🏽❤
Jeffree: “hey everyone here’s a new video updating you on my life”  *24 hours later*  “OMG GO BUY MY NEW COLLECTION ✨✨✨”
I noticed that his subscribers are decreasing......
Why am i lowkey obsessed with the background song @6:00
Love you Jeffree 😘😘
why does this feel like an infomercial
Will the boxes all have different things or will there be repeats of some stuff in each box?
You come here in the Philippines... I want to see you Jeffree 🌟 😆😆🥺
Now i think if his “boyfriend” drama was just a setup to gain more attention to comeback and sell his brand
To The Fans Reading This: sending Virtual hugs to everyone who needs it. Always stay safe, Wanna get to 2k💕❤️💕PLZ:(HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY):❤️;'
Wen are the boxes being released????
Mann jeffrees packaging is always ++++ amazing
You STOLE this whole formula and idea from Lisa Eldridge. Unfortunately you’ll probably never be sued though because she’s too classy and above it all.
My legs fell asleep in the first 30 seconds
First thought on seeing this video: KILL THIS LOVE
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuxAp7iYh5VGFnmcjHxtu9g
i wonder if he's still deleting negative comments... kind of shocked he disabled comments on his recent vids
Yass
Will after pay be available on Friday??
His make up has always been the best formula i have ever tried.
I see jeffree like my sister I trust everything he came out. Everything is so stunning 💕💕💕💕💕💕 LOVE YOUUUUU JEFFREE CAN’T WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON IT😭
LOOOOL your own man robbed you. GTFO🤣🤣🤣🤣
CAN WE TALK ABOUT @ASLAYY shes so gorgeous and ive been a fan her so long... shes so unique and definitely deserves the recognition... like WOW that women is beautiful... jeffree and his team SNAPPED with adding her ot this campaign im deceased
The lipsticks look gorgeous! I love how saturated and vibrant the colours are! Can't wait to try them out XOX
Last video: u know ppl been sayin i only come back to sell something Next video: selling something
Here we go with another video with the zoom in and zoom out 🙄 miss the old make up room
0:20 my heart fucking jumped bc i thought he’s about to say „I’m retiring” lmao
NOW SIT DOWN AND PLAY WITH MAKE-UP!
I can’t wait for Friday, I’m a pretty picky lipstick wearer but I saw quite a few I’m living for 😍😍❤️❤️
thank you for thinking about the people who don’t like the normal shades and coming out with colors for everyone ❤️
Hmmmmmm Lisa Eldridge copy cat??🤔🤔🤔 she was the first to come out with that velvet finish on the outside....
*EWWWWWW*
One swipe actually equals 5 😆
I don’t understand how he’s not cancelled, but shane Dawson is?
He only showed us 19 lipsticks😢 One is missing!! Did anyone else notice it?
I WANT!!!!! I have a lip ammo and I love it! But this new formula: YES GAWD!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Omg😍
OOOoooOOOooo  it's DRILL SERGENT for me.  The only thing I would find confusing is remembering where all the shades are in the new case by the new design.
How did your legs not fall asleep tho??
Noooooooooooooooooo not Lip Ammunition ;;  I was hoping for a restock of Sinister one day ;_;
Jeffree:"people said that I'll only come back to yt to sell something..."  Me:"ok"  Jeffree:*Sells something in the second video*  Me:"wait something is sus"
Is anyone else curious or maybe you know, what do they do with all these huge elaborate props they make. Like what do you do with a big ass bear trap after a photo shoot?
The set reminds me of black pink
Love you jeffree, love the new packaging
Congratulations Ms.Star!!! So much Amazing New lipsticks line💋❤❤❤ those dark reddish brownish pieces!🤩
Banging pink eyes first of all!! Beautiful lipstick!! Congratulations! The video is also beautifully designed!!💐💯👄💖 nude is my favorite..and that's saying something because I usually don't choose..
I've missed you sooo much!!!! Excited to see you back on Youtube!!!!! Love love love the new lipstick!!!!!!
I don’t like you, JS but.... gotta give credit where credit is due.... you killed this! This looks amazing
The set❤
Yall remember the real life cat in the hat movie. Why does this remind me of when the cat was trying to sell us a cupcakinator and had the cooking show?
Yes! YES! Y E S.
Anyone else getting a Jaclyn Hill vibe here? Not posting on YouTube until there's something to sell?
Talk about extra I live
Are the lipsticks eye safe like the liquid lips?
I hate liquid lipsticks This is everything I want 😍😍
James Charles is better
Not jeffree star related but that place jeffree sits in shouts "LETS KILL THIS LOVE" come through Blackpink!
These lipsticks look like sex toys. 🤣
Unphased looks like baby food but the rest are amazing
I was ooh-ing and ahh-ing through the whole video! and by the way best birthday gift ever!
The packaging and just the lipsticks themselves are bomb! Can’t wait to get one or 20😬😂
Bye sir where wearing mask
Who tf is he looking at?
They look really cool, but exactly how different is the formula from the lip ammunition? It looks pretty identical to me.
Wow you are off the hook ❤️❤️
Why is this dude still on YouTube, he’s practically been accused of everything. GO AWAY
NOICE
I can tell jeffree is honest kind of person. And so jeffree can do it as well on its product. She inspired me on her originality. And hoping jeffree will stay safe and healhty so she can inspire more people. Thank you jeffree star 💜
oh how i wish i had enough money to at least buy one lipstickkkkkkkk they look so prettyyyyyyyy i swear Jeffery makes the most attractive looking make upppp
Hello Jeffree. Are they eye safe ? Will there be a white and maybe gold comming out later ?
So you really came back just to sell make up 🤣
I gotta buy them!! And it will release on my birthday
Omg love the lipsticks I want 3 of them so bad you killed it Jeffree❤ and this will be my first Mystery box I cant wait!
you could hate Jeffree, but you could never hate his products. FACTS
Jeffree really did that.
Such a fucking PHENOMENALLY iconic
Damn how are u sitting like that hahaha lol. By the way i know you give back a lot, I hope you help out my friend with her gofundme for tuition bc she is in her last year and if she cant pay she needs to drop out. If there is anyway you can help.. gf.me/u/y4t9hp
That’s an upgrade?! The packaging looks cheap AF!! Looks a lot like Kylies packaging
Omgg
Old lipstick: Looks like a bullet like the name suggests New lipstick: Looks like something you put up your ass
Jeffree last video: people say I only upload when I want to sell something and that's not the case  Jeffree Star in this video: look at my new lipsticks
I love it all 😍
He seems like the boss from a videogame
I just wish he actually showed the swatches as one-swipe like advertised....
That trap tho
a red wig and a silver dress I could not believe it
Jeffree there's just too much echoing in the video. Somi presume that you taped the video in your home which explains the echo?
I love this packaging it is so luxurious! Thank you so much for putting in that extra little touch
I’m really not trying to hate; I’ve been a fan, supporter, and customer for years but you said you only need one swipe but you didn’t show a single swatch only swiping once. I’m not saying they don’t perform well, I just wish I could’ve seen that 1 swipe coverage you spoke of
Will the boxes only be available on jefreestarcosmetics.com
I love this 😭🖤
Are these inspired by Lisa Eldridge?
Y’all eatin this up!
Woahhhhhhhhhh🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍
Rat in a trap that he is ngl
Lip ammunition already retired, I didn’t even get my hands on them! 😩🥺🥺🥺
Hey Jeffrey! Love that your posting more. Also I’m poor send me free makeup lol
I was waiting for a blush...😩😩😩
No purple I’m disappointed
A good gift for your friends and family also for make up lover! I wish I could buy them all whaahhaha. Great job Ms. Star! What a gorgeous video. More like this please! More vlogs to come! More make up vlogs to come!
Sooooo do we get a sneak peak in those mystery boxes..?👀
5 seconds in... Where tf is he sitting. Ahahahah came back to edit after a minute, how bizarre just casually filming a YT video. I wonder if this set is in his house too 😂
Wtf Marcelo???! I went to school with that guy in hs!!!! Wtfff that’s awesome!
I want these sooo badly 🔥
what about the Velvet Tracks?
I'm still waiting for the lip glosses from the ORGY collection, even ordered them first thing when they were released....
I won't be able to get any mystery boxes I'm working all day at a place that has no signal whatsoever 😭.
I love jeffree but I wish he posted more casual videos and not just for new makeup 😍😍
He literally posts videos right before launches but thats exactly what he said he will create. He wants to focus on his own and end drama factors cause he can live without them.
What shade is Jeffree wearing in the video??
Your absolutely can lift my spirits. Absolutely love watching your videos. ❤️❤️
Omg on my birthday!!!!
i love jeffree so.much i sas here from the beginning , he is just misunderstood thats all .you tey fighting your whole life just to be accepted for who you are ! i love you jeffree🍬. happy halloween !
your earrings xxxxxxx
Love Jeffree’s nails!!♥️♥️❤️❤️♥️♥️
Wait. Didn't he just make a video trashing people that said he was waiting to announce a new product? Like not even a week ago? Confused?
No
I'm getting induced when he releases this, and the mystery boxes. 🤣🤣🤣 I got one last valentines day and loved it
My broke ass watching this as if I'm gonna buy lmao
What a time to come out with new lipsticks. We all have to wear masks! He should have made velvet masks with monograms In all these shades!
Lolol!!! I fucking called it! Clock my 1 like comment on the last video...I was giving 4-6 weeks before a launch though 😬😆
I feel very nostalgic seeing that big ass bear trap, because it reminded me of that blackpink MV Kill this love.   Oh God, the memory.   Also, I wish the COVID to stop already so I can order one myself, It's very strict here
💕how exciting one day i will own a piece of JSC
Glad to see you back...
Jeffree last video, 3 days ago: I don’t come on here just to sell products Next video: Say hello to velvet lipstick formula
Hey Jeffree, Your wigs are looking Really good lately, im surprised. Good job 👏
I wish Jeffree would come out with a mascara.  He has everything you need except for mascara ..

I’m on the fence when it comes to supporting Jeffree as a person, but I have been so excited for his brand since the very beginning. It’s just so creative and different from other brands.
Lovessss 💕💕
Put some echo boards in ur studio please! Driving me insane over here hearing the echo!  Should be a cheap fix for higher video quality.  Otherwise can’t WAIT to try new lip!!!
Yay for makeup videos again !!
congrats on the stunning new launch and greetings from ireland! <3 im totally 'trapped' into being addicted to watching your vids!
Lipsticks look beautiful I’m ready to order
Those are the prettiest lipsticks 💄 💋
Im so gonna get the naked body shade😍😍..cant wait😍😍
🤮🤮🤮
Jeff... i can't wear lipstick 😢😢😢😢 face mask
Females taking beauty advice from a man shows just how close to the End Times.
Who also thinks about lisa eldridges lipsticks?
I want that perfect red😭😭
All of this looks absolutely amazing! 🥰💖
here is copy of power bullets 😂
Jeffree: Goes on with only one swipe! Also Jeffree:
Ugh do people really still care what you’re selling?
YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I always thought the lip ammunition were overpriced
All the shades  are beautiful
All of the lipstick shades look soo pretty and stunning!
this would've sold out, but he ruined his career, will never admit he did something wrong, he won't talk about it.. kinda big yikes. and you can see he is canceled, cause his views are so low, his launches didn't sell out.. he buys instagram likes and comments..
I want naked body now! I’ve been looking for a shade like it for soooooo long.
I thought it was agreen screen
watching it snap into place when you close it is sooo satisfying LOL i'm so fucking excited to try these!
Jeffrey can you also make adventscalenders?♥️🤗
lol gay
blood unicorn my fave <3
I couldn't help but notice that all the models in the shoot had almost the same STUNNING lashes? What are they? I wish Jeffree would come out with his own iconic/neon/shiny lashes. That would be amazing!
U have to stop what ur doing. U look like an old grandmother....its cringe bro
Bishhhhhhh, I don’t even wear lipstick &’ I’m thinking what text am I gonna send my brother at 6:26am (New York) time to BUY ME THIS!!!
I hardly ever wear make-up and with the way the world is now, I do so even less, but you can bet I'm going to be buying some of those lipsticks. Jeffree's cosmetics are top notch
Ngl out off al the beauty gurus makeup and beauty brands his attracts me the most and if I had the money to afford it I'd def buy Jeffree Star only! He has everything I like and want: shimmery, matt, purple, stunning packaging, long lasting, a shimmery perfection indeed! I get attracted to everything shiny and shimmery. JS never disappoints with his new makeup launches!
Trying to copy Lisa Eldridge's inimitable Velvet lipsticks' bullet texture
I can already tell how amazing that formula is
OMG thank you soooo much for Malibu Beach House!!!
Im curious...how does YT trending work? Coz i have seen videos with less than 200k virews within 12 hrs  on there but some 1mil views within 12 hrs not on there.
and other my fave shadde is the dark black purple
Anyone else getting Cardi b WAP vibes?
love them all but the perfect red is my fave'
That black 🖤 is BEAUTIFUL! and lovvve the hot pink and the blue omg - stunning. They r all fabulous colours! 😊
hope diva is okay :)
congratulation. i wish your products there exist in greece
Lol the editing for a giant trap is wack. Cant afford a real giant trap ?! Huh!
Looks like a bullet vibrator lol
I’m readyyyyy to give this guy my money 🥺
I would love to purchase the box but there is the clo T.T it would cost 2x more
Wish i can soon get my hands on all the products of JS
#6 number  on trending 💯
They look magnificent -
This launch looks really fun and I cant wait to grab a couple of them. Honestly though it kinda reminds me of lisa Eldridge's lipstick line. You should give her makeup a try Jeffree, i think you'll love it. ^_^
How is this man not arrested yet 🤢
I wished I had the money =( But Congrats to you Jeffree!
SURELY he borrowed that bear trap from BlackPinks 'Kill This Love' scene
Everyone looks like Barbie dolls that I should of had when I was a kid. Lovin the blue <3
I’m sitting here 12+ hours after watching the video. And I want the nude vault in the lipsticks already. Jeffree, please.
Literally all I want to know is how to do that pink eye look.
ok BUT 10:25 whats the colour on the hand? it was not swatched because few seconds later there was different colours.
Apology video > makes everyone feel sorry for him with a sob story about dogs > launch video   Sickening.
For a moment i thought it was a green screen background 😂... anyways.. can't wait for new velvet lipsticks 🤩
Velvet Trap is actually my name on Grindr
I love the new lipstick! Cant wait to try it! ❤️❤️❤️
He is STILL posting?
Nah mate  you aint getting no likes from me. Vile human being
"Hulloo how are you" lmfaao🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Not even a million views and it’s posted 13h ago! What the hell
Jstar the new jaclyn hill. Comes online when he wants to sell
This is super amazing!!
So much reminds me of too faced cosmetics but that's not a bad thing, Too faced is one of the most innovative brands out there in terms of product range, custom packages, materials
Here at 960k views
Who chose to record like that? And the echo, can't stand it
Loveeee the shadesss
Some were asking about the song in BG. Its " Afterlife" by Besomorph & EMM.
Nobody:  Jeffreestar: *Making everyones quarantines better*
Jeffreestar: *Posts*  Everyone: *Lets scroll down through the comments*
💋💋💋LUSH💋💋💋
Your lipstick looks so good as a product is it available in the UK ?
Soo.. all of the recent drama for this new products?
Retiring the lip ammutination??!?? 😭
Who didn't see this coming?
what is this i-
Omg im obsessed with him sat in an actual velvet trap Its like a glamorous saw trap😂
are the mystery boxes only on the jsc website or can you buy them off other places he works with like black swallow because i know theyre getting the lipsticks but i wanna know if they will have the mystery boxes aswell
Queen Back Again❤
Jeffery is literally so extra😂 I love it
I want thisssss 💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
Some people have never been able to afford or try his makeup but always watch his campaign videos. It's me. I'm people.
I wish I could own one tho ㅠ.ㅠ
THE BEST EVER!! Can’t wait to get them!!
I wish I could own one tho ㅠ.ㅠ
Hopefully the mystery box aren't old products you couldn't get rid of like the other ones.
How does it peform, last & feel compared to the earlier bullets?
Jefree new lipstick product is totally insane which I think thr market will be able to love
I need!!!!
I don't know how you can ever top Redrum as that is the PERFECT red...but I'm willing to find out!!!! Love his products!
I think he is a god of makeup products mann
I'm pretty sure Jeffree missed one lipstick
I love all your lip products 💄
Why does these remind me of the hank and Henry ones 🧐
Just when I thought Jeffery couldn't  He did! Lol
Nice Video Thanks bro  https://youtu.be/KyGdKXPums4
Retirement rack? More like clearance rack at tj maxx🥴🤧
❤️❤️❤️
These photoshoots are in another level. Perioood https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVoKlfqYI10
I love how the lipsticks are made now. But the texture gives me that Hank & Henry vibes.
Love or hate Jeffrey (I love him)  his makeup is always amazing and top quality
‘Funny how Jeffree was so quiet then suddenly there’s a new product’.   WELL DUH. HE WAS WORKING ON SAID PRODUCT. YALL HEARING URSELVES?!
I want two lipsticks!!! It’s not yet for sale 🥺
Honestly you can hate him all you want but it's no denial his products are not only pigmented but also cruelty-free. Even big make-up companies cannot pull off a formula like his without selling it for such a high price.
6:14 also reminds me of saw
I love you Jeffree!! Fuck what people say, I still stand:)
who else thinks of saw when you see it?
That’s October 17th in Australia! That’s my birthday!!! Whoooo
I'm gonna have to wait a year or two to get these. I'd look crazy with these all smeared on me from my mask lol
Is this available in Malaysia?
Not a fan of the animal traps, but I am here for those newly pierced ears!   Now....when you are known for your liquid, no budge, lipstick, and the world is wearing masks....why would you release transfer lipsticks!! 🤦🏻‍♀️ Missed opportunity, doll! 😷💋💋  With that said, am I the only one who loves to match up previous colors with the ones about to be released? Funeral Parlor -> Oh My God Naked Body -> Mannequin? Birthday Suit?  The Perfect Red -> Red Rum Diet Mannequin -> Butt Naked Chocolate Fondue-> Pumpkin Pie? Hot Commodity -> Jeffree WTF Honey Suck Me -> ?? 818?? Ex supermodel?? Fire Starter -> Anna Nicole   Malibu Beach House -> Virginity? Nudist Colony -> Christmas Cookie Pure Hell -> Weirdo  So Jaded -> ?? Medieval Kiss -> ?? Unphazed -> ??  Drill Sergeant -> Dirty Money  It’s the only time I really play with my JS collection (and I have them all mwhaha) 🙋🏻‍♀️💰💰👩🏻‍🎤⭐️💋
10:15 "honey, suck me" ...his lipstick name game is as strong as ever LMAO
When i see those beautiful lipsticks i really want to purchase and sadly they aren't avaliable in india
his pose the whole time🥴👁👄👁
In a pandemic?? 🥺 I don’t get it
Yall can talk tf yall want to. BUT Jeffree is another LEVEL !!!!
Congratulations 😁❤️
Hope he release a foundation
earrings look amazing on Jeffree.. the piercing really came through!!
Here before million views
How does he sit like that the whole video without changing position
Uhm want at leaaast half of it 😅
Bitch that curly red wig is EVERYTHING! You always kill it Jeffree much love 💕
I want every shade! 😭
I can't get enough. I literally have no money with no job right now and being a single mom of 2 and having to homeschool my 2 sons(which btw jeffree star both my son's know who you are and my 11yo came out last year and it's ppl like you that make it possible for my boy to feel brave enough to come out and I couldn't be prouder of my babies strength and self love) anyways...even though I cant afford any of the products I'll be asking everyone for anything from your collection.
The same as the Lisa eldridge true velvet lipsticks!
Can you do a full face with only velvet Trap lipsticks ❤️
I want to talk about the hair....i am obsessed with the brown an teal bang. Am obsessed with the pink one today. Work it
If you think that his makeup is good that is your opinion. However, buying things from his brand is putting money into his pocket and is you indirectly supporting the problematic things he does and stands for.
I have always been a fan of jeffree and his makeup. But as him being a youtubers he is starting to remind me of Jaclyn Hill only comes on to make videos when there is a scandal or a launch. Not cool in my opinion. Just saying.... I knew when he did a video last week I thought ugh don't tell me he is making a video just to come out a week later with new product and sure enough here is.....
I’m seriously in love 😍😭😭
Interesting lippys one day I would love to try one.
Gladly jeffree is not a saint for sure she wont sell any if she was... KUDOS jeffree iam sure i can buy one of those for my kids and wife soon MORE PRODUCTS for you!!!! Keep slaying
Yes the brands makeup is amazing but, the video content ugh. It sounds scripted and super fake. "so saddle up mama". The transitions are bad and that echo makes me want to gag.  The overall video quality is just getting bad, it's distracting. I only came to watch this video for the halloween mystery box and even that was disappointing.
Hi Jefree, Love your products!! I am a water sign like you but A Pisces, Your A Awesome Scorpio!!
Unstoppable Queen 👑! He is just the best in make up industry, can’t argue!
Jeffree!!! Yall SNAPPED on this launch! So proud of the whole JSC team. Love all the thought that goes into the details, and this is exactly why you can have my money! 💕
Hey, this Friday I'm going to get my robot dog so......my robot dog is going to have to come with me to by the  lipstick.
Products are always magnificent. I LOVE unicorn blood!!!! If I could only wear one shade for the rest of my life it would be that. I need it in every formula
Interesting, so this is his new youtube video formula - make a new "life update" video and then a week later BOOM new product video. Clever girl...
The trap is the same from blackpink's kill this love lmao
Fuck girl...those nails...that eye makeup, those lip sticks, that set....im dead. Loving it all.   What a great sexy original shoot.
Wow the shades are so beautiful,I wish I could afford them,I am literally drooling over that red one
Yess!! Can’t wait!! I’m just waiting for foundation now!! 😊😊😊
Didn’t he claim in his previous video that he wasn’t going to promote his products and shit?
i gotta get up at 3am to order some mystery boxes
I feel enjoy everytime watching your video but not this one. So boring
Your makeup is very beautiful you are really an artist.💜💜💜
Every single time the mystery boxs come out, a bitch is broke! Come on!! 😭😭😭
i cant wait for the mystery boxes yay i never get the big one fast enough but the other 2 know i'm coming for ya.
Greetings from me, beginners
awesome as always  #jeffreestar  why is it that everytime there's a launch I cannot afford it, then when I can everything is sold out !!
Went offfff! Those are beautiful lipsticks
I’m high as shit and I believe this is your most amazing work. Every Inch of the new product was well thought out.
Jeffrey is so awesome, hard working and so loyal to his fans, I really admire and appreciate that about him. Yaaaas bitch 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
All so beautiful! Can’t wait 😍🥰💖💋
I am just waiting for anna to invite jeffree star for met Gala
Shocker LOL
I hate you but I love your makeup brand, your make up skills, your nails, your face, your style, your shoes!!!!😭😭😭 Have mixed feelings about you 🤣🤣🤣 💔❤️
Is it just me.... or is 2 days for a new collection and mystery boxes that everyone wants, a tad short notice...
Hi Jeffe i am a fan from Chicago come and do my makeup i am not a youtuber. Do something differant a long time fan!!
Hello idol jeffry
Do I need a battery or is it rechargeable? J/K these are cute
He may have a lot of scandals but you can’t deny the fact that Jeffree’s makeup brand is on point. Also, the shade “the perfect red” is sickening 💯💯💯
sis is TRYINGGG so hard to be blackpink with the bear trap but no ❤️ you’re cancelled x
AGAIN W THE ZOOMING IN N OUT 😂😂😂😂😱😒
THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO SEE IN THE MAKEUP INDUSTRY! 😍😍😍 details, details, details I LOVE IT! ⭐
Some may dislike him but we all have to agree that hes on top of his shyt and has AMAZING MAKEUP!!! Very TALENTED all around! ♡❤🖤♡❤🖤♡❤🖤♡
With the lighting we are unable to see the products, the old way you had to showcase ur products was better. More details were easily see. More production is not always better.
I’m sorry Jeffrey but what is new? The Japanese and Korean make up companies have been making this style of lippy for decades.  Honestly come up with something orignal or is that asking too much.
Jeffrey star Ft. BLACK PINK
Everyone knows what Dolce Gabbana stand for and they have done way more damage than just back talking and still millions of us follow them and buy their stuff ...sometimes talent is talent and if you cant acknowledged it grow up darling.  P.S. everyone hating jeff for using dirty politics just take a look at your president before you talk.
Might be a bad person but is leading the game when it comes to quality control for his brand
Is this formula a long lasting wear? If it last a couple hours I'd be happy with that. Just curious but I might try anyways
Very hot . Just as I would expect from j.s.
Yyaaassssss
Trash 🗑
not you saying in your last video that you don't come back from a break only when you're releasing new products and then posting this right after 😭😭😭 jeffree, honey...........
Does anyone else always watch his collection reveal videos but never buys anything because you’re too broke? 😂
the comments sus when all you see is “you can’t deny that Jeffree creates his makeup with high idealistic designs and perfect formula” like what stfu 😒
Tf with all these bots in the comments 😂
I LOVE HIS PRODUCTS SO MUCH! You can love or hate him but ypu can not deny quality and this is the most important for some brand! Bravo Jeff
The new lipstick formula looks so yummy! That “Chocolate Fondue” shade is calling my name! Congrats on the new launch. Love you, Jeffree. ❤️❤️❤️
I wish Jeffree could help me find the perfect color. They're all beautiful but I definitely can not pull off the blues or greens however I'm all about the nudes!
I miss seeing you review makeup!!!
Anyone know what song that was during the photoshoot?
Ew, I was still subscribed to him
The bear trap from BLACKPINKS music vid?
Oh yessss loved all the Colors its a must buy me one or two..
Why you so far away from the camera who the hell though this was good filming
He looks so cute in that giant trap😂
I have yet to try his formulas 😩🤣
I'm amazed that everyone brushed over the recent sexual allegations and still willing to buy his products.. ABSOLUTELY AMAZED.
Kylie would never appreciate her workers ..nd always takes the credit to herself
Love you to pieces please let us get some amazing tutorials because they are very much missed. Love the collection
Why does it look like vibrator 😂😂😂
I'm so happy this launch isn't MASSIVE AF! I feel like I'll actually be able to get almost everything! 😍
the word trap hmmmmmm
I love that velvet trapppppp
Nothings better than a JSC launch!
They’re deleting comments, how are ya?
Unicorn blood and celebrity skin are made for my skin tone, can't wait to get them
Would love to be part of your PR team I'm 50 retired salon owner and makeup artist who likes to inspire women of all ages on my Instagram @vamparella1212 @Jeffreestar
Jeffree was also very modelesque! She was blending in!😃
People don’t like jeffree? .... Can’t relate 🤷🏻‍♀️
I had to replay that like 3 times cuz I thought I was hallucinating him saying my name...😳😳 Jasmina 🤪🤭👀 7:30
Jeffree, you boosted my motivation for makeup again I cannot wait to get my hands on these I’ve only ever owned the blue blood and I love it I cannot wait to grab all the lippies😍😍
I wonder if these are inspired by the Lisa Eldridge “true velvet” lipsticks...
I need THE PERFECT RED what the actual fck
Yes baby !! This is everything
I am super shook!! This will be my first mystery box!! I had a car accident a few weeks back and am having a hard time with some of the injuries! This lifted my spirits! It is so good to have you back on here! I missed you! 💗💄👄👩🏻‍🎤⭐️
JS products are always so royalty looking, I love it.💕
Beautiful and Jeffrey is hilarious
💜💜
Wish we could get the mystery boxes in the UK 😭😭
Beautiful!!!
I think a better setup would be giant velvet lips that are hinged open with metal spikes for teeth.
I'd were all of them 😍
When you really love all of his products, but doesn't have the money to buy one  So sad.
So excited 💕
🙌🏼 WOOP WOOP! Love JFC!! Hot release 🔥 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wish I could afford one of you boxes
Dying to try them they are just fuckinh perfect
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omg i love you Jeffree!! 🥺 i feel so proud of you... kisses from Guatemala🇬🇹
Omg the monogrammed lipstick looks so cool
I wonder if this giant set is built in that barn?
No body is perfect but Jeffery is perfect in sooooo many ways than many of us....he is rich.. famous hard-working individual ...taking care of so much stuff  yet balancing his life n stuff .
forever my idol
Isn’t this just a rip off of Lisa Eldridge’s velvet lipsticks (that she invented) and have been selling for three years now? Wow
while watching the video i cant take my eyes of her nails omg! love it!
You cant deny that all of Jeffree product is stuh-ninggggggggg and extremely pigmented..eventhough i never try it but when i saw people responds i know it was worth buying jeffree product..i love youuuuu jeffree 😘
It's my dream to be on his PR list
This trap look like the trap in Blackpink "Kill This Love" M/V (No hate, i just wanna say it)
WHY DO THE MYSTERY BOXES ALWAYS LAUNCH BEFORE PAY DAY😰😭 I've always wanted one! Just a $20 one would be nice😫
Thank you Jeffree. Videos of your makeup and your home life with your babies are my favorite. Happy Halloween 🎃
Really beautifully
I just wish I can have all of your MAKEUP !! 🥺💔😭
I have a feeling the premium and deluxe boxes won’t have palettes in them. I think some people got the blue blood in the last box? I want the blood lust, because it’s the only one I’m missing lol.
Wait what!?!! u said that in ur last video u where not back just to promote a lanch... 🤔
This looks cool Halloween is my all time favorite i wish i had the money or credit card to by some thing frome you and shan im looking for a job iv been through so stuff this year its ruff my family and i going through to much im so happy to watch you your my favorite and we have same meddle name im erin lynn wilcox i so wish i could have one your Star mirror or a big bag i love your black stuff and makeup but my family can't afford it with going to court fighting for my nephew to live with his dad cuz his mom is in jail and i cant find a job kuz iv bern threw ruff stuff im sad im your big fan and my bday is November 7th 1989 i really wish i could have something from you for my birthday but know it want happen keep up the good work all 20 look so good purple is my favorite coloer love you have a happy Halloween sorry text a lot. 👻🎃😈👽
Congratulations 🎉🍾 Love all of the shades!
Here we go!! So glad it’s after payday.
Insane nails! I want it too!
Bottom line everyone’s human- despite the drama I think the fact that Jeffree produces amazing make up *for every tone* and has high expectations says a lot about his true colors. That alone is why I’ll continue to support him
Jeffree Star :  JSC is cruelty FREE !!! also Jeffree star : *gets a huge fukin trap and rat trap for photoshoot campaign* XD (just pointing out the irony, no hate)
this better than Apple event
He literally does just come back to sell products
$100.00 for 8 items? how that affordable?
??? New packaging it’s exactly the same tf wow u changed the color and weight ur soo good I love u thank u for designing this wonderful replica of your product u deserve an award
the setttt
love Jeffrey's energy ♥️💯
omg i love his makeup
I stan a person who will not grab someones money with their low quality products.
Wow eavryone was right one video up then wow a new product
Im a guy who doesn't wear makeup..but i've watch every single video of jeffree star
I don't even wear makeup and I still want this!
I’ve never worn makeup, but I swear...I want to ! A mystery box would be so amazing to start playing with makeup to see if I like it!
Hahahaha you are a joke
Seriously so fucking proud of you!!! Especially  when you showed the bts of the shoot! Hust gorgeous!!
Glad your putting out makeup again.  I don't really like you as a person but I love your make up😍😍😍
Hi Jeffree, can't get anything this week, but hopefully, a few shades will be available next week!! Love your products, they are the best!!
Luxury lipsticks in a time of mandated mask wearing lol
I find it funny how he launched this new product before he addresses the problems with his old product (lack of pigmentation in the Mini O*rgy Pallet)
I wish I had money 💰😭😭😭
I feel like you come back to sell your products a lot. If life is mentally draining I can understand, but you should just post a review or something instead of selling your products after being gone for a long time. 😞
I don't understand why this wasn't top of my news feed
Wait, did I just wake up from a short coma? Is Watermelon Soda a color in this line or not? Cause it kinda jumped over that switching and was already on his hand....
Hi Jeffree! I was wondering if you could give me some advice on what shades of lipstick and eyeshadow would suit me. I am a blonde with hazel colored eyes and I am relatively pale. I am also fairly new to makeup so I was just curious. I love your videos!
Cool
Girl next time use some sound dampeners. I get what you’re doing here but the echo is legit painful!
this collection is very dark skin inclusive.. love that
I absolutely LOVE Jeffree Star Cosmetics and can't wait to get some of these lipsticks and the mystery boxes. His makeup is amazing!
Jeffree: "I love to shoot." Me: "Yeah me too, Jeffrey, me too." 💦
This would make an amazing strip club name... Very high-end!
Blackpink’s ‘let’s kill this love’ vibes???
Love the new look! The colors are awesome!
Omfggg they’re STUNNING
"But bitch, they're not Jeffree Star." PERIOOOODDDDD ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Lol it is funny that jeffree is launching a "lipstick" line during a pandemic where everyone is wearing masks everytime they go out 😂. Would be kinda pointless to buy these when you wouldn't even be able to show them off when you go out. I haven't touched my lipsticks during this pandemic at all. I guess you can wear them around the house lol 😂😂. Yeah I'll wait until later to get these.
jeffee looks soooo good in this video I cant
who is the model  in the suit  mmmmmm
This is like an infomercial quality video.
I need all of them.
💜💜💜💜
Love to see it 💞💞
Just because his makeup is good, doesn’t mean he is a good person , or has redeemed himself from what happened sorry. If you say “ i just buy his makeup but don’t support him” you still are supporting him in a way. Man canceled himself more times then i can count, yet people still support his brand by buying his makeup and end up filling his bank account even without giving it much thought
That type of opening of the packaging is literally genius for people with long nails like me, thank you for that!!!
LOVE you makeup but now I see why people say u only upload when ur launching something lmao I'm sure u don't give a fuck 😂😂 plus pandemic has hit me so bummed I won't be buying lol
King Jefree ❤️❤️❤️ I love all the shades they are all beautiful 😍
I was like: god yes I need those, then I realised that I have to wear masks basically everywhere I go and immediately sadness struck me 😭😭😭
😍🥰😍
What a surprise... a new launch a week after a fake drama story about andre. I miss the old jeffree that actually cared about creating content. All of the videos on his channel lately are drama or new launches. I am tired!!
The new lipstick bullet looks like a butt plug  I'm into it
Blackpink  let's kill this love?😚
I want a mystery box so bad, but have to save for baby due in February 😭
Jeffree needs to launch some JeffreeStar Masks of each shade of lipstick
I'm so ready for this launch..
Unicorn blood 😍😍
Jeffrey, let’s have a talk.  1 - Your set design is always amazing, you have a great team and it looks incredible. But the crazy echo in this video totally kills the vibe. It ruins the fantasy. I would say perhaps you are limited by COVID but I’ve heard this in previous videos you’ve made. You need to go full blown and enclose the box or partially enclose it for better acoustics. I just hate to see that big beautiful set and fab models ruined by that awful echo. It cheapens it.  2 - Your website is absolutely atrocious. You are successful. You’re company has done well. You need to seriously hire someone to give that monster a facelift, it looks amateur at this point. It’s 2020 there is just no excuse for a website that janky.   Easily solved problems! But whatever, still great products!
Here before 1 million
I want one ☝🏻😍
Yes yes love it omg slay
Even if you don't like Jeffree you have to agree his makeup is sooooo good
Love you
♥️
You may not like jeffree but you gotta admit that his makeup is bomb
Loved the photo shoot! So creative! Would love to be a model for you one day 💕
why does the trap look like its from Blackpink's kill this love MV just me lol
No masks. Way to protect the models, ridiculous.
Here 😊
He is sitting in a trap talking about trap .... Only he can pull out this 🙃🙃
I cant afford much with 6 kids single mom but i love u so much MissDiva...
Lmao nobody cares about the scandals anymore😂🤦🏼‍♀️
I love you kelly forever and always 🙁
I like the shades but the packaging looks plain, not too excited
Serveeeee 🤩 everything is amazing!
I don't wear make up but even now in my darkest moments when even my family has left my side. I'm watching his new video to help me forget the life I live and live in his world. If it's the last thing i say i love you!!! I also love everyone who wears your make up and is allowed to be themselves!!! I wish I knew that power! 😁😁😭😢
There should be more dislikes than likes
**I HOPE THERE'S MERCH IN THE MYSTERY BOXES!**
i want to send this to my Boyfriend aw!! love i love u jeffrreeeeeeee
Which shade is at 5:49 ? It is GORGEOUS.
6:59 "I love shoots"😂
THATS A LITERAL VELVET TRAP
This whole video was amazing shit the guys looked hot 🔥
It’s the same fucking shape but one color 😂😂
his nails are gorgeous
I want them all! 😍 the packaging is stunning! I love it 😍
What’s the name of the song that’s playing during the photo shoot?
even tho hes problematic, i enjoy his makeup videos idk why
Omg that print on the lipstick is everything 😍😍😍😍
Take a shot every time he says beautiful.
I would LOVE a mystery box for my birthday. We will see
I'm really excited for these but I've stopped wearing a lot of lipstick since the masks we gotta wear covers it up while I'm out...
love me some BTS footage 😴
Cant wait to try velvet trap
Omggggggggg jefreeeee!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVEEEEE THE COLOURS🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 BUT ALL I CAN DO IS JUST WATCH PEOPLE WEAR THESE LIPSTICKS BCZ I'M INDIAN  I'M NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO BUY THESE🥺🥺🥺
Best lip formulas ever!
Jeffree is such an iconic visionary!! So so so sickening and amazing!!! 😍💋💄❤👠💅👌
I swear jeffree Star always got the quality and his drama is just so out of the topic when it comes to his quality products
Jeffrees launch going after apple over here
why did i think it was a dick lipstick lmfao
😁 yay
Hi jeffree star💖🤗 love from the Philippines 🇵🇭 I'm a fan and this October 25 will be my bday,I hope you'll noticed me😌
Seriously heartbroken that I'm flat broke and won't be able to get anything. Halloween mystery boxes are what I wait for all year, and I'm literally in tears that I won't be able to get one. 😔
How do his knees not hurt sitting that way
Love your makeup but its so expensive i couldnt buy it sorry...
okay.. but that bear trap thing is a MOMENT.
omg that chocolate fondue!!! i'd BATHE in it!!
I hope I get lucky and get a mystery box I finally have money to buy it !!!🥺😭
I feel really weird about the fact that this seems like it's a Jeffree Star version of the Lisa Eldridge True Velvets. The texture on the bullet, the name, the packaging and some of the colours I mean.
BUYING THE BLACK LIPSTICK ONE FOR SURE
Naked body is Gorgeous!!
I m going to get all the three mystery boxes you,all. ... Jeffree makeup line is the best and the quality is always top notch ❤️
Iconic
I need an intro for this channel to more beautiful and fabulous!
I have never owned JS cosmetics (can't afford it) but I can say that he makes them look so awesome!
Quarantine has been financially ruinous for me so I definitely can't afford any of this. I'm having major FOMO right now.
I really want a mini one lol
So you really were posting an update before a launch:( sas
Reminds me of one of those pocket vibrators haha love that
WOW each and every lipstick has the most beautiful color payoff I’m impressed.
i'm enjoying this a lot. those colors are so pretty!
Omg id love these 😍😍😍😍
Why do you always launch when i don’t have money 😢😭
😂😂 says in his last video that people are saying he’ll be back when he wants to sell something and swears he’s not gunna do that  Next video selling new products
Lisa Eldridge Velvet lipsticks, magnetic closure, same bullet mold texture (velvet), also a matte, debuted in 2019.  I guess imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
I miss being able to wear lipstick more than I ever thought possible
Love them but nun of them are one swipe...
✌️🥳🤩🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️😘
Ok I watched 3 times and I know what colors I hope to get !!! Jeffree if you see this, there was a color called Pinky Boo back in the early 90s that was yhe perfect baby pink with a silver pearl metallic it was a tiny bullet from what I remember but you should look into bringing that color back 100s of ladies would buy it and looking for it..
Last video he was like "I don't only upload for new releases." Next video: new release
Damn wished he released wifey in this formula .
Oh wow jeffree here I come can’t wait until Friday babe 😀😄❤️🙏🏾👍🏾👍🏾God bless you looking good as always. Xoxolynette 3232
May I just say that each and every one of these lipsticks are FUCKING STUNNIIIINNGG!!!
That olive drab green and the grey ❤️ WANT
I have yet to buy any product by Jeffrey Star. I do keep up on what’s new in his cosmetic line. Although I haven’t purchase any product yet, I can honestly say this is beautiful, unique, and seriously the most amazing thing(s) I’ve ever seen with any cosmetic. 🤘🏽 Then the fact the mystery boxes launches on my birthday is even better 🎃
What does a bear trap got to do with this lipstick? Why r all his idea so saddistic n cruel
The song in the campaign was so good I loved it ❤🧡💛🤎🖤🤍 What song was it called and by who ?
jeffree really be deleting negative comments hey ....
When you live in a third world country in South America and 1 dollar = 145 pesos so I can't get anything 😭  I wish I could get some of Jeffree's make up. I loved all this lipsticks specially I want to get first of all; "nudist colony"! "honey suck me", "celebrity skin", "diet mannequin" and I would be a bit scared to use "perfect red" since my skin is very pale and I dont know if it would fit me 🤔 (with my blonde hair speacially xD) but perfect red looks amazing and I'd love to give it a try... all my lipsticks that I used to have are pastel pinks and light red like salmon. I still have some make up but I'm running out of it >o<
I actually LOVE seeing the behind the scenes shots!!!
Those lipsticks are so gorgeous I wish I could afford one 😀
Imma beat ya'll to celeb skin & nudist colony. I hope lmao.
Its ashame no one will be able to fully enjoy these lip products because everyones mouth is covered up these days😷
Jeffree, please sell your makeup in Malaysia....
Like him or not... he slays w/formula, packing, presentation, quality and is generous with mystery boxes!!! 😏
We jus gonna forget then?
ive always wanted a jeffree star product and cant ever afford it. i saved up my money and got one eyeshadow brush. ive always wanted to try his lipsticks and this is the best lipsticks i have ever seen.
I think Jeffrey is a bit nervous in this video because he never fidgets or is really a lot with his movements so the way he was rubbing his knee and playing with his clothes I think he’s nervous
To all the comments on the other cosmetic designer who did magnets in her launch, do remember that jeffree has his ideas waaaay before the actual launch date as stated before because he likes to make sure everything being put out is top notch. No need to hate on him for taking the time and not rushing things before someone else does it. 🤦🏽‍♀️
The magnetic lid is perfect I am always losing my lipstick lids
Hello from Ukraine.😍😍😍😍😍Love you.💖💖💖💖💖
I have been waiting for a shade like Medieval Kiss from the JSC line forever! Berries on ice wasn’t quite it for me but this shade is what I was hoping he would make! 🥵 does anyone know if this would be available on other sites?
I’m not gonna compromise my look just because people wanna cancel him. Like if I look good in his products, why would I give that up? Cause it’s cool to cancel ppl on YouTube? Nah sis
That trap gives me anxiety... So many animals are cruelly tortured by those things and here he is posing all cute in the middle of it. I understand it’s just a PR thing and meant to sell his cosmetics which are great but it’s just making me very uneasy
Dude you can afford this crazy trap thing and your house but you can’t keep my favorite glitter formula?!? So mad!   Edit I seen the glitter one! So I’m happy! Can’t wait to buy!!
The shades are really beautiful 😍
Not very many, med tone lipsticks. I wish he would make more shades that would look good on brown girls. Not too excited for this launch. Good luck! Congratulations for the new launch.
Dying for that hot commodity damnnn love it. But im also feeling the drill Sargent and army green heart 💚 ❤
Honestly I love a good lipstick but have no interest in spending money on them when I have no where to wear any.
The nudes are all extremely light.
Here before a milloin views.
Mob boss
Please unsubscribe
I already want like $150 worth of items before this launch...if only. Sending the item list to Santa this year for sure ;)
BEAUTIFUL PRODUCT JEFFREE CONDRAGULATIONS . AND THIS VELVET LIPTICK TEXTURE REMINDS ME OF LISA ELDRIDGE VELVET LIPTICKS WHICH SHE LAUNCHED 1 0R 2 YEARS BACK.
why do i gotta be so damn broke this month
Yaaaasss coming for that jawbreaker!  💙💙💙💙
i genuinely thought this was a blackpink kill this love reference
I'm going to get at least 5 of those lipsticks!! 💋💋💋💋💯💯💯
can u review harry potter x ulta beauty plsplsplsplspls
I have a QUESTION! Will the mystery boxes contain concealers? Because I wouldn't want to get a random concealer shade that I can't use... Every other product seems good for all skin tones except the concealers!

His nails 😍 they’re all I can focus on lol
I wanted to get my mother one of your lipsticks no wonder I couldn’t find them on the website
LIVING for the red wig on you 😍
Ok legit stopped this after "if you're afraid of red lipstick. . ." Do not be afraid of red lipstick, no matter how light or deep your skin tone is. Red is an amazing empowering shade to wear. I will even wear it to church (if I'm wearing red or have red in my dress.) I'm fair skin with pink undertones, freckles and blue eyes. Can't wait for this.
These are gorgeous!! Cannot wait!!!!! Xoxo 😘
It's too KKW beauty. The component it too plain for JSC.
I NEEEEED funeral parlor!!!!!!😍😍😍
disappears for months then comes back with a launch, jaclyn hill who? gross.
There are comments which shows that they are here to promote themselves
Jeffree‘ packaging are excellent
It looked like a suppository when he pulled it out 😂 the curse of being a nurse lol. I do love the update tho!
I LOVE YOU JEFFREY !
You can hate Jeffree Star all you want BUT when it comes to his makeup YOU BUYING IT. Everything this man creates is pretty and well packaged. DAMN. I’m man and I don’t wear makeup but I still to buy it.
The way the behind the scenes was filmed 👌🏼 very nice!
I knew it he only came back to social media only because he has a collection release
I start work Monday and I'm a trans man but gawd I cannot wait to blow my paycheck
I cant with this camera man anymore 😪
While I'm not purchasing this I am anxiously awaiting the November holiday launch!!
Its the tampon looking packaging for me..
Love the hair!!!
I’m gonna go broke :(   But it’s so darn worth it ;)
Who else is obsessed with her makeup’s!?🤔💗
Awwwwsome...new formula
He's going for that Kylie vibe hardcore huh all his recent stuff been looking like Kylie cosmetics in terms of packaging
Amazing
❤️❤️❤️❤️👀
The lipsticks look so creamy 🎀
Is Velvet Trap a euphemism for... Vagina?!
Where them all inclusiveness at? Where them plus size models? Where them not average body models?  Nothing against the makeup. Its amazing.
Jeffree give me some make up please🥺
BEAUTY BARN REVEAL !!!!!!
I'm a bit new to your makeup line but I am so excited! Are the mystery boxes limited time or can you get them whenever?
I think one of the shades, the first one in the “second hand” is missing, the vibrant coral... I don’t know maybe I’m confused but the second hand stArted with the pinky coral up to the shade I said (Maybe called watermelon?)
I love the colors, I love the tube and the print on the lipstick
I can’t wait to hide these beautiful lipsticks behind my face mask! 😩😭🤣
Launching lipsticks in a time when our mouths are covered by masks :))))))) 😂 🤦🏻‍♂️ my lipsticks are just sitting there, collecting dust on my shelf, the most used lip product i used was a transparent nivea stick :(
ew
*When I saw the thumbnail:* what is that?? *First second of the video:* oh damnnn, bitch wasn't playing when she said issa Trap
I literally feel emotional seeing how far you've come. I remember listening to your music back when I was still in school, and it's so amazing to see that the jeffree from now is what jeffree from the past wanted to be 10+ years ago. I'm a big fan of your art
Looks like a Mini vibrator
Why is literally no one wearing a mask? I get the model’s makeup would be ruined... but everyone else? Even if you feel it’s obvious how you felt with your viewers, it should be addressed so the public knows you’re taking the pandemic seriously.
U come back to sell and go..
Lost touch.
Beautiful😍😍!!this is How Jeffrey works....passionate to the deepest ...whole-heartedly...every detail...every piece...😍😍
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS EDIT!!! LOVING THE TRAP VIDRO SHOOT OF THE ACTUALSHPPT. MY GOD SHE SHADES GLIDE ON THE LIP AND HAVE SO MUCH COLOUR IN ONE SWIPE! BUYING !!!!
When you 💘 the bad guy
I sure hope its set to only so many per customer I have not ever been able to get a mystery box for any holiday and wasn't ever able to get lip ammo so it makes me sad they are being discontinued. Yeah ppl sell them but for crazy prices. Would love love love to be on JS pr list
Me crying because I know I’m broke 😭
Per usual, your newest/latest make-up  collection as a collective whole - STUNNING.  The embossed micro print JS Star  logo grid on the actual cream stick.   It's such a chic touch.  Honey Suckme. Nudist Colony. Drill Sergeant. Pure Hell.🖤  It's all so perfectly executed.
I am from India..and I have watched his every single video..i love him.. of course i have not used any of the products as to buy them i have to pay customs and it will be expensive as hell..looking forward to use some one day as i just love how he does beautiful launches..such an original person..lots of love to you Jeffrey..
Jeffree sees one BlackPink Video.
Back on the screens to sell something
omg I want/need everything!!!
Nah
This giant velvet trap set is fuckin fire 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥 Jeffree is absolutely killin it.. the hair, the outfit, the set , the makeup... FUCKKKK EM UP!!! 💋
Wait so you’ll get 55% off of the $100 mystery box?
that red is TOP TIER RED😍😍😍 BROOOO
I just wanna know what the song is when they’re doing the shoot clips
this collection is EVERYTHING
What time on the 16th!!!
Omg yessssss
I don’t understand why some people get angry over swatches and how they show pigmentation. The bullet is new, it has a different outer finish from the actual product so you’d have to break through that first (which is why 2 swatches are where it’s at), and hand texture isn’t lip texture.
Over here wishing I could afford some of this ! The colors look pretty
the coverage tho...          *mind blowing*
Lovely my #QUUEN #JEFFREESTAR
Looks like a tampon, but still love you Jeffree
Mystery Boxes!!!!
Omfg I cant wait, did he say a time when the launch was?!?!?! Did I miss it??? I want the deluce mystery box and I need to be there to n get it.
Beautiful! I love the nudes! Very pigmented....im interested!
Wait did JS come back just to launch? Oh honey-
😜🤗Eeeee fuck YAAASSSSS ✨💃🏻✨‼️
Comments: I know he’s a bad person but I care more about him and makeup than morals......unless something isn’t vegan or cruelty-free, only then I’ll give a damn about my morals. 🙄🙄🙄  You’re part of the problem and enable him to get away with shit *by supporting him and buying his products* . Truth hurts but it’s the truth. What’s more important makeup or morals?
I’m soooooo happy!!!! I’ll be there to grab some for my bday which is October 17th!!!! #soexcited #happybirthdaytome 😂
U film this too far I cant see very clear but damnnnn that formula rocks
Omfg.....that Fuckin RED HAIR YOU SLAYED IT!! 🥰
Jeffree need a eyeliner and a mascara ASAP! Can’t deny he has one of the best formulas out there
Jeffree needs to come out with a skincare!
Anyone else seeing a pattern here? Jeffree gets in drama, doesn’t post for months/weeks, posts an apology, then drops new makeup and repeat
I’m commenting too much. 🙄🤦🏽‍♀️
Okaaaaay Jeffree!!! He’s always putting so money and effort into his launches✨
Putting it on high volume so my husband sitting in the tv lounge knows what i want for my birthday 😹❤️
Oh shiiiiit those colors
Who else was hoping adrongyny was going to be a lipstick..no? Just me?
I mean he is constantly losing Subscriber 🙂 why is he concerned about is??!?!?!?!
The only thing is I won’t be able to show off the lipstick in a mask 😷 😒
Love u girl !!!!!!
OMG That dripping chained dress is so F'n fabulous!!!!!! Meow!
Anyone else literally his biggest fan but cant afford his collections and it makes you so depressed because you just want to support him and be able to show off how much you love him but just cant buy them :( love this life.
take a shot every time he says stunning
Sadly lots of people here won’t know about Lisa Eldridge and that she created velvet lipsticks like these way before
I 100% agree with most of the comments on here, even if you don’t like Jeffree his makeup is AMAZING 😍 I have never used or found a liquid lipstick formula that can beat it and the eyeshadow palettes are beautiful and top notch! I will always defend Jeffree when people decide to smash his makeup or whatever because like his makeup is bomb af! Congratulations on your new launch! 🎉💕 And you bet imma snag a mystery box!
Can I use the lipsticks as an eyeliner?
I was only staring at the nails 😍😍😍💗 BITCH 🤤🤤🤤
"He only comes back when he has a new product" and he did lol
he shows up only to collect some coins 💀💀💀
I am 59 years old and live in South Africa. I have 5 items in my make up stash and is always amazed at what you can do with make up. Love your videos. Love Karin
Time to spend my money 🥲🥲🥲
He literally just said in his last video posted then less then 24hrs ago that he wasnt posting the previous video because a launch was coming or anything 🤔😶
Didn’t he just make a video saying denouncing the claims that he only makes videos when he has a product launch and wants to sell stuff...or am I tripping
Would anyone know if it is possible to get mystery boxes shipped to Australia? Because I've always wanted one so bad 😅
Jeffree is like willy wonka but with a makeup factory and i love it
Holy shit. I thought that background was green screen 😳
6:37 - oh putain c’est Larusso!!!
My mom use to wear red lips everyday to work.
these look sooooo cheap the colours ew
Honestly Jeffree always looks so amazing.
I want the burgundy lipstick!!! 🤤
😍😍😍
POP OFF QUEEN 😌💖✨
Love you but who edited this video? Wasn’t that great
Naked body is my slight sunburn.
8 hours 751,000 views. Go Jeffree.
Girl come on. You could’ve displayed the lipstick shades on models of all colours too. Foundation shades you preached about, but these lipstick shades mostly accommodate for white people. Do better :/
Jeffree sits comfortably in a position I could not maintain for 1 second.
Omg I cant wait to try all of them!!! That army green one though...mindblown!!!💯💯💯💯🤍🤍🤍🤍
Istg is makeup is a new level! It’s sooo good!
looks like a tampon...
I don’t like the video format now. Seems like he isn’t talking to us just doing an advertisement. He’s too far away and more focused on the scene instead of connecting to his viewers that have missed his real content over the last few months
I wish you did an indigenous day video with indigenous makeup owned companies. 💙 💙💙 💙
Those photos look amazing
Wow so the last upload was just to flog his new products..... Mehhh Not today. I’m getting over how fake jeffree has become or he has just been an amazing actor.... love to Mehhh in this vid..
😍😍😍⚰⚰⚰💄💄💄
My favorite
I’m just confused why You’re being filmed so far away lol
Every lunch the past two years everything is sold pit before I get it in my cart. I will scream if I don't get that $100 mystery box this year! Halloween is my favorite holiday and my birthday just so happens to be the day before. Can't wait for friday!!
Ok, Jaclyn Hill uploading when you have products out
I wasn’t in love with the lip ammo formula, it was like a crayon, not smooth application it was hard
Those pink boots. 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Jeffree be keeping set designers employed during covid  😂
Glad you're back!
I've missed Jeffree! Love you queen!
❤️💕❤️💕 oh I need one!
No hate okay but seriously we have seen most of these shades from other brands. Some of them are even close to the ones from NYX or Colourpop. I think it just makes more impact because it's "Jeffree Star". What you all think?
This honestly makes me feel a little sick.   In his last video: I didn’t come back just to promote new products to you guys.   A few day later: What’s up everybody welcome back to my channel, so here’s my new makeup line.
Jigsaw from Saw: "I bet you're wondering why you're in this bear trap Jeffree?" Jeffree: Uh to take pics of my new lipstick Velvet Trap? Duhh.   P.S. all of those lip colors are gorgeous btw! Hope to get a Halloween mystery box this year. 🎃💚💜🖤
Can we talk about Jefree stars wig it's EVERYYYYYYYYTHING!!!!!!🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
Song?
lovely jeffree. ❤
Willy Wonka makeup factory ass set  Dope
The trap is metal tho...
Wow I never have bought any js cosmetics but these look stunning wow
Biiiittchhh💅👄
I always miss the Halloween mystery boxes! Literally don’t get paid until end of the month 😭😭
am i only curious that is he wearing one heels or both?!
Wonderful
WHY NO ANDROGYNY❓😧... You always keep us looking so "Money baby" & gorgeous!💖😍 Thank you for the most beautiful collection yet! I'm soooo 🤤🤤🤤, I had to watch it again!😍💖👑🌟
Kylie, you should take notes and learn from the King! She's always with the same boring sh*t. But my Jeffree is top notch! Always thinking out of the box and giving us these exquisite make up. I love Jeffree! He is everything the make up industry needs 😍 look at how perfect those products are! I'm having an eyegasm!!! Love from Argentina 🇦🇷
Miranda sings is shaking for that red lipstick😂
I have been searching for perfect red and here we are 😍😍😍 and the black one.... Thank you Jeffree
Omggg the lipsticks swatch like butter! Its soooooo satisfying to watch!
Love it!
Very creative! Love it
i love the blue love you jeffree
Jeffrey's like that friend that only calls you when he needs something.
YOUR KILLING ME ZAADDDYYY❗😱😍 I've never seen a collection where i could possibly pull off every color❗🤤💖SO FREAKING BEAUTIFUL❗ I wanted the nude vault so bad, no baby, I want THESE❗ OK, I want both sets. Anybody wanna purchase an extra anyone and make me a twin!😁💖🤗😜(so wish the world could get back to a more normal situation)
CALABASSES!?!?
You straight up RIPPED OFF Lisa Eldridge’s velvet lipstick formula. Shame! Shame! Shame!
Jeffree is the willy Wonka of makeup
Wow love those little star logos on lipsticks!
Hey, Jeffree it's pretty cool to see  behind the scenes and I like all the lip sticks but my favorite two out of the many favorites is "Naked Body" and "Celebrity Skin" lip stick.
Who else can't buy any of these but still watch him cause u like watching his videos (and because u are a boy)
Damn masks 😷 😭 can't rock these beautiful new velvets anywhere i go right now 😭
Thank you
The gigantic trap reminds me of Blackpink Kill this love video 💗🖤
More lovelies to add to my JStar collection! 💜⭐💜
Do you all remember Charlotte Tilbury's velvet lipstick.... and I fell in LOVE with them... the fact that Jeffree now has MADE THEM... OMFG RIP my bank account I am buying every damn color 😂😂
I get paid on Thursday they release on Friday sounds like it’s meant to be!
why can’t sis have her own tv show wtfff ❤️
Dreamy 😍
Jaclyn is shaking
I want a mystery box so bad ive never been able to get one!!! 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
j姐终于更新啦
People swear he's canceled, yet he stays SOLD OUT! 😍💕😘
I wont be participating this year but i hope he is gettin rid of those pop sockets
whoa the african american model just transformed with makeup into a supermodel! the nude lipstick on her was just...WOW!
Claim your “Here before a majority of dislikes” ticket right here
Yo why do all of these comments sound bought
Don't you dare to leave YouTube, Jeffree!!! I love all your videos!!! They're gold! 😍💕🇦🇷
Can you please post a photo of your eyeshadow omg I wanna recreate it!!!
It's looks so delicious 🤤
Took me 4m to realize he was in a bear trap 🙃
I wonder how these compare to the Lisa Eldridge ones, I love those and hope these are just as amazing!
I like his hair..and the pretty setup :3
Love these 😍
Anyone ever think about the trash cosmetics builds up at the dump?
take a shot everytime jeffree says stunning
I hope I can have one ☺☺☺
When I saw the video, my first thought was 'please let there be a unicorn blood shade in this' and when he said unicorn blood, I kid you not, I started crying. Will forever stan Jeffree Star
Rich people confuse me
love ur brown eyes with that hot pink.  stunningly beautiful.
Your makeup is stunning
Lmao. He literally just mocked someone in his last video saying “Jeffree only comes back when he wants to sell something” and here we are 🤣
The one MUA who wasn’t wearing her mask properly 💀
I’m thinking of purchasing... I hope  not disappointed like I was when I purchased the Shane Dawson collection!!!! I was so excited just to be let down 😔
Love 😍
He really only came back to sell proudct 🌝
The packaging reminds me of my first makeup kit as a toddler, it had lipsticks but they were only plastic meant to pretend play .... I was so disappointed when I realized the products did not work... in a smaller scale but the looked very similar to these new lipsticks
is it just me or does the new lipstick kinda look like a vibrator...
Sooooo glad to see you back on you tube. Beautiful lipsticks 💕
The echo is killing me
The guy at 5:55 tho 😳😳
Red isvperfect.. Want it 😍
if you're ever in danger just wip that thing out and throw it, that lip stick will knock em' out for sure.
Your products are becoming too pricey for me. 💔
Where’s Lipstick Nick!?? Nicole.... where are you!?!?
I like this!!! So pretty
I want!!!
Lisa eldridge did it first
Jeffree in your area
Why he be sitting on something that look like a trap from the Saw movies 😂  plot twist hes john kramer lmao
Freaking AWESOME 😍😍😍
Even if you don’t like him, he’s is excellent at his layouts and promotional photo shoots. I hope he will just go back and get it right and just do make-up, one of the reasons I started looking at Beaty channels. He is really missed from that arena. He doesn’t owe anybody, but to just address the issues. Stand behind his words and let’s us see the beauty guru Starr.
Jeffrey, your nails!  Oh my God you took me to Oz with that gorgeous manicure!
IS C5 EVER GOING TO BE IN STOCK?  LIKE, EVER?
YES.
🔥🔥🔥 absolutely gorgeous colors! Love the packaging as always!
I wish Jeffree went back to makeup reviews. I miss that side of his channel. A little shade but mostly drama free.
Your models are so beautiful 😍
Every shade that I like looks TERRIBLE with my complexion. Most of those shades cater to fairer skin. Damnit!
HIS PALLETS ARE CHALKY AF
That red 😍 I'll be setting my alarm for this....
The lipstick must have been inspired by the velvet lipsticks by Lisa Eldridge... The name, the look of velvety texture... Just my opinion
This video set background is insane lol
Ummmm anyone else think this comment section is sus???? No one is talking about the fail of his last launch and people are just mentioning the fact he has "the best makeup"?? Vote the imposter out PLEASE.
I’m glad lip ammo is going byebye it was a shit formula. Come for me if you want but I have bought many whether it was OGs, seasonal or new shade. None applied smoothly and broke when trying to apply. 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ idk how I feel about these. Wait for someone I trust to review em I guess.  Also was there a reason that the watermelon soda swatching was edited out🧐🧐
No one can do it better Jeffree Star. She's the Queen.
Soooooo... he’s not going to address what was wrong with the old formula? Obviously there’s a reason it’s being replaced
Unpopular opinion *what if you bring all jeffree star's makeup products in medieval cuz you time traveled*
When you watch the whole video and realize you forgot to turn off your blue light filter...
He literally only posts videos right before he wants to sell us something. Sis is not even trying to hide it anymore. And these lipsticks are going to sell out within 5 minutes anyway. After everything that went down. Idk whether I should be pissed or impressed at this point. Oof😂
Jeffree last video : people say im only posting to sell something! 3 days later Jeffree: GUYS IM SELLING SOMETHING
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The lip ammunition was shit. So I can see why he stopped the production 😂
Absolutely love that jump suit!
KILLED IT with the packaging
I FUCKING ADORE YOU JEFFREE!!! 💖💋💖💋💖💋💖💋💖💋💖💋💖💋💖💋
What's the song name?
The trap reminded me of Blackpink Kill This Love MV😂
When his cosmetics are top tier yet still manage to price lower than kylie's.
this filming scene reminded me of kill this love by blackpink
Please make a velvet trap lipstick holder in gold 🥺❤️
this set is so extra ..... and I’d expect nothing less from jeffree
I see some people in the industry took notes after Lisa Eldridge released her velvet lipsticks with magnetic packaging few years ago...👀
BLM!
NOOOOO IVE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE SOME MONEY FOR THE AMMO LIPSTICK 😭
Yaaassss, unicorn 🩸 and a few other shades are calling my name! Excited for this drop, I love regular lipsticks. 🧡🧡
Coming out with lipsticks that no one can wear because of the masks.. :( I miss wearing lipsticks/glosses.
I'm happy that you kept the original Lip Ammo component shape and did not change it or something "subtle" and "store-safe".
Waiting for the colab with Nicki 🙏
With that REDDDD revlon like👀😂
Hi
Betchhhh!!! You looked BEAUTIFUL in that red hair ❤️
I Bet theres a bunch of lip ammos in these boxes. Gotta  clear out inventory lol. Probably a few shane items as well (ahem, mini reg controversy, ugly ass ryland color, and hopefully he doesnt add that damn regina george highlighter again)  But ill probably still buy a box or two and then be immediately pissed off about it
I'm not much of a bullet lip person but I'm down to try 🤔 These look so cute!
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.
Looks like a woman's "night toy", lolzzzz😁
Anyone else is thinking about the fact that he’s always releasing things right after his drama.... I’m kind of starting to see his pattern now
Too bad our lips have to be covered, but it does look like it would stay after we take our masks off
My goodness... what a lovely set for 1 I have been dealing with bs all day and now time to watch my Bae Jeffree and enjoy some ice cream lol
Song please!!??
...wow...of course there was drama to draw attention to a new product...
Jeffree: I don’t make up drama for a new launch Next day: New launch
Absolutely LOVE when things look bougie yet affordable. The fact it looks so expensive and luxurious is the best ever cuz then your not worried about being nrom
Looks amazing.
I love the frosted blue color. I just don’t know what I’d wear it with. I have trouble matching makeup with outfits.
The mystery boxes!!! I've been waiting for it!!! I NEED THE PERFECT RED!! ❤️❤️
This reminds me a lot of the Lisa Eldridge magnet packaging and her Velvet textured lipstick bullets. But at least he made it different.
Im here for it
💄
This is ABSOLUTELY NOT related to anything but what is that song in thr bg and during the bts....can anyone tell me?
as soon as he posts a video explaining all his current drama you just know his next video is gonna try to sell you shit. how very predictable.
So he WAS back here to sell us something 🤣
Im in love with every single color!!! You rock Jeffree!!! I'm gonna make it a goal to get them all! Xoxoxo 👄💄💋
Meow 😻
Jefree: I do not come back to YouTube only when I want to sell something!   Next day: New launch
I really appreciate that this new collection has more shades of brown and burgundy/red.  Absolutely love it. 💯💯💯
That campaign is fire🔥🔥🔥
Omlllll I know you probably don’t even care no one probably will but I’m about to be 18 in it’s coming out on my birthday I think that’s so awesome
Damn it! My c section is planned on the 16th of october! I wanted one of those mystery boxes 😂 better luck next time (ill try for the christmas one!🥶😆)
Hmm I’m wondering why he’s been offering new discounts ever since the cremated launch lol he might be losing money
7 hrs later and I am still here before a million views . But tomorrow this will be played over and over I am sure
You didn’t say the price of the lipstick, I know they can’t be $18 like the normal ones
OMG I NEED TO GET AT LEAST ONE JUST ONE. can't afford them all or I would get every shade.
Yay! Excited to try the new formula 💄💙
Blackpink vibes
GAG!!!!!!
JStars Velvet trap vs  Cardi Bs WAP!
I can't wait for Friday!
Those nails ooooooo yessss
Jeffree Star has the best eyeshadow and lipstick shades 💙
Hello Jeffree Star I really enjoyed your video I like the backdrop of being in your studio how you you know show your merchandise off all kind of photographs do you do for the merch when the camera when your camera was far away for your new lipsticks that you came out with when the camera was in a far distance it look like little wankers if you don't know what that word is that means a dick look like it but when you put the camera closer to the Maine lipstick then I got to see the true form of it and what it was looking like so I shall follow I thought you were going to go really overboard dramatic on that part if you just had the star with the two Jays on it Entune unusual patterns so and I'm glad that you're bringing out the Halloween packages mystery box I hope this time everyone will be happy about the Halloween packages I think I can't wait for people buying them and seeing what is inside them were people the YouTube channel and hopefully someone that I know that the YouTuber will buy it and do a review on it so keep keep up the good work of your business and stay safe stay healthy and be very careful who you date and if you ever date again but do you have to be extra careful for being a celebrity a music makeup and doing weed you had to do profile of people that you date make sure you have cameras in every corner of your home in and out in and out of your warehouse and if you have any extra extension make sure they have sensor alarms and cameras and you can get electric gates just so you know so and I can't wait for your new vault at your home that you're going to be working on for your new home remodeling a whole nine yards of a Gucci home I can't wait for the transformation when it's finished I know it takes a lot of work to get it done and to make sure it's sturdy in the paint job and everything I hope you have some extra new decorations to go with it in the process so I'm going to pray for you that the perk people that you encounter with the process of dating to be respectful every chowder when you're dating and not treating each other like crap so I'm praying for that when the time comes that you going to try again or I know you trying to I know you're trying to work on your businesses relationships with your friends in the makeup world and YouTube world so take care be safe and your babies too and your friends and your your crew and their families be safe also everyone that you encounter with to be safe they are important to too also be safe to you all including you Jeffree Star catch you later thank you for listening
You are gorgeous!! Looking like Joan Crawford  !!! Beautiful!!❤❤❤👄👄👄
You know what I really hate about your products?? Is when you put the pretty logo on the makeup, I really don’t like to ruin the products.😊😉
Literally thought the set up that he’s on, was in his house at first 😂😂😂
I needed Gemini in this formula. 😢
Love the double J so much that I've been marking my things with it for 15 plus years. I had it tattooed on my wrist about 12 years ago. I'm a Scorpio to so I guess great minds think alike,  lol.
🤍💀🤍 Love the look of these I’m excited to try when the wildfire evacuation is over!
Yo!!Lipsticks got a face lift and the price hasn't change?? That is awesome!! Can't wait!!
Jeffree can’t wait
the formula looks similar to Mattetrance lipstick by PMG..
i dont want to support him but damn these mystery boxes and that black lipstick is making me want to spare some $$ for it
This is so dopeeeeee !!!
Exactly there are so many other brands out there shop poc black business not wtv this is
Well dont even really wear makeup any more but now I'm just ready to dive back in 🤣
Girl dont get started always on point
Omg the Formula!! Looks amazing 😍
Yes Mystery Boxes Is YOUR THING!👏❗❤💯😎 Ughhhh I Want It ALL! 🙈😁 Always Steppin On Up Jeffree.
Bitch that is so FIRE!!!!, how I wish I have atleast one but I'm broke  The design though LT!!!!
how can that position be comfortable???
Ok jeffree this is dope asf
Why do I secretly want Jeffree to make a Halloween special FX makeup set 😱..
So whats the difference from the old one? Is it more or less matte?
Who does the lip modelling they have like the nicest lips
I love it all. I cant afford any of it but I will always cheer you on. Make a video on the launch. Please. I loved all the behind the scenes with shane. I miss you guys together with Andrew. PLEASE.
Does he drink water at all
with allll the drama he was just in, I should’ve known there would be a new launch lol
Oooh @jeffree yes to those red nails!
Congratulations 🍾🎉 to my one ☝️ and only queen 👑 Jeffree Star, always for ever and ever your makeup 💄 is the best of the best !!!
TRAP QUEEN 💖💖

I am very impressed !!!!
Soo excited for new formula!
🖤Damn i want all the lipsticks right now🖤
At 6:33 Jeffrey looks exactly like SJP ‘ Carrie Bradshaw ‘ from SATC2 gay wedding scene. Am I the only one thinking so? Okay
Jeffree looks Irish some reason
Bishhh I want Asian models
I’m in love with how Jeffree is so dedicated to making his campaigns ORIGINAL & creative. Major props to everyone who worked on the sets & photoshoots, AMAZING JOB👏🏼
The colors are insanely beautiful!!! The pigment omg 😍😍🥵🥵😍😍
dude is flexible af to be sitting like that and not feeling pain
Where can I acquire this Bear Trap chair thing?! I love it!!!!!
If You Confess With You’re Mouth Jesus Is Lord And Repent from YOURE sins and ask God and Jesus for forgiveness follow God and Jesus commandments and Ask For Forgiveness Share with others  🙏🏽❤️
I love thisssss I want onee ❤️💛💚💙💜 love u Jeffrey
Lets give it up for the oNLy creator who gives his packaging 100% even ms Kylie Jenner with all her money couldn’t complete. As for the recent haters can back off because clearly he ain’t stopping 🥰
Does he remind you guys of Willy Wonka too?
we all know why he made a come back last week
Sold me
HOW THE HELL DOES HE SIT LIKE THAT 😂😂
You should a Review on Walmart make up
Why am I not seeing comments about the fact the lipstick packaging looks like a little butt plug?
I wish people were ecstatic, hanging on every word towards Jesus Christ. Yeah, ...we are definitely at the end of the rope.
(Test the mic):::::Um:::: we are already in spooky season:::::
Okay I love it . That's it . I can't deny it anymore.
Umm.. someone's deleting comments again LOL
Now this is what you call GOOD QUALITY . Always killing it
Bougie
Wow! A new launch after made-up fake drama ... am so surprised :eyeroll:
Dude that black. 👌👌👌
Wow!!!he's so original.👍💜
Can someone tell me if these are long wear lipsticks?
Jeffree still has the BEST makeup!! I can’t wait to get my hands on these beauties!
EvEN ThOuGh HE ******** hIs MAkEuP IS sTIll The BEst
Hahahaha in his other video he said somthing like "people sayin i only put out a video when i have spmthing to sell" and oh shit... look what just popped up...
idk if it's just me, but I think this packaging looks very similar, if not identical, to Kylie Skin
You may be hate him BUT!!! YOU CANT DENIED THAT HIS BEAUTY PRODUCT WAS BOMB AS F. HIS FORMULA WAS THE BEST ALL OUT THERE AND FOR THE PRICE honey theres a high price to pay for a high quality.
Not original or "never seen" at all! Lisa Eldridge's lipsticks are far better option million times luxurious and well thought. Also... she's a person that I can support for her morals and ethics.🤗
Jeffree in last video after a month of inactivity: People are gonna think I'm back cause I just wanna sell something Jeffree 2 days later: buy my new lipsticks
Ok I’m not a super fan of him but these lipsticks are actually stunning
Wow beautiful
wow you’ve come such a long way, so proud of you luv!
This looks amazing. I see a mystery box, and some Velvet Trap in my future. 😍🔮💄  And Jeffree the eye makeup is KILLER!  I don’t care what anyone thinks about you. You are a business bitch! Your makeup line is THE BEST out there!  Love the bigger and better things you keep putting out, you know how to hold on to your customers and give us what we want! 💄💋🙌
Would love to try the new lip stick but can't afford it. Barely making it. We are over $2500 behind on rent due to my boyfriend loosing his job due covid. Sorry still love ya.
Can't freaking waittttt for the mystery boxes and this new formula looks amazing.
✨" there are a million diffrent lipstick formulas on the market, but bitch it's not jeffree stars "🌌 well said jeffree
love em all just a fan my fav is honey suck me the color is pretty i have a light skin tone its hard to find a good lipsticks that match my tones any recommendations on using cover up i buy jeffree stars products shes amaz but i need good cover up even tho jeffree is fab like not expensive
😂😂🤣🤣i fucking knew it🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣i saw a new product coming from the previous video.🤣🤣these beauty gurus are disgusting
I want to see the full face of the one who lip models for his site!!!!!
Damn those views went down
I’m gonna listen to this again and every time he says “so” I’m gonna drink a shot
Lisa Eldridge made velvet textured lipsticks a thing just saying...
Jeffree says in last video “I’m not here to selling anythingj just to talk ”also jeffree next video sells new products
Anyone wanna buy some new JSC makeup before I send it back and it’s destroyed? NIP
Urgh velvet makes my skin crawl. Disgusting
Launching on my birthday woohoo!🤗🤗
Omg ive been saving money to buy jeffree star pallete and now theres new product coming:(
Can someone please buy this for me or send money to my cash app to buy it $ChiiiikA ...
Lipstick nick does all of his makeup for new products! I love Boomkackmua but where is ms Lipstick nick?
YOU ARE A BUSINESS ICON. I LOVE IT
Wow the models this time for this campaign they look like real models! Amazing!
Who else still has the old JSC Lip Ammunition?
just wondering, would Jeffree ever have something in place where people could mail back empty tubes and palettes to be recycled?
I . Lost. Faith.
omg releasing on my bday ^_^
Love this collection!
Drama channels will use this and the other video as their content... Vote them they're a lil sus ahhaha
Jeffree: now before we get into spooky season... me: looks at the date and is confused because spooky season started almost a month ago
Awesome!!!😀❤️🙏🙏
Always a jeffree “Stan” I love you and I love this whole collection💜💖💚💙
I lovee the outfit
Please make androgyny in the velvet trap formula 😭😭😭 it’s my favorite shade!
OMGGGGGGGGGGG! I WANT THEM ALL!!!!
Hiyo, when you do a new make up review, can you review the glow recipe lip balms? They have a duo pack of blueberry and watermelon at Sephora
I just love the way he explains/ introduces his products...his way of introducing clearly shows his love ❤️❤️
Pls can someone tell me the song's name :(
He got this idea (the trap) from BlackPink - Kill This Love 👀👀👀👀👀
Why is everything filmed so far away?
Yes this...I always love the creativity and thought that goes into JSC products.
I love his products!!!! I love the warm nude one, the red & the hot pink!!!! They were all beautiful but those are my fav. His one of the best in the make up industry like dam he did THAT!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I have FOMO for the mystery boxes but I got Blue Blood twice in a row so I kinda don't want to risk getting that a third time :/
Ok. I need to know what Jeffree cleans his hands with. You can't tell that he just had some extreme lipstick on his hand.
Some one needs to rehire Nate’s brother. Who is filming? The dogs?
Jaclyn Jeffree Hill only comes around to sell us something now?
Oh she’s thirsty because she’s about to release new product... I get it now... been silent on YouTube for weeks
Jeffree it my dream to meet you love you pls give me a shout out
oh baby MEDIEVAL KISS. That BLACK CHERRY. LOVE.
Bisshhh yass!!!! Love you 😍 💗 xoxoxoxoxoxo
Ahhh 😍!!! Can’t wait for the mystery box and the new lipsticks
Oh MY God!!! Like sexy lingerie for your lips.. Jeffree Im so excited!!  thank you ....
That red setting during the shoot.... AMAZING!
Love the look of the lipstick it looks and glistens just like this Patrick Ta lipstick I bought a few months ago at Sephora. Gives Edward Cullen vibes. The matte pink packaging is beautiful too!
Love the packaging, formula looks luscious but the only thing I would have liked was if when showing the swatches on models he had a person of colour as well. I am not a person of colour but I think lipstick looks very different on different people and because you have some darker shades it would have been nice for those who are POC to see what it looks like on their skin and what undertones it brings out. Congrats 🎉
All I want in life is to model for a jeffree star shoot
No shade, but the lipsticks look unique and very high quality, but they look like almost a copy of the Lisa Eldridge texture. I will also state though, they are so different it the way that they are very unique to Jeffery star
even though you all start hating jeffree you all can't deny that he has the "best" makeup compare to others. wel love jeffree start!!!⭐❤
The attention to detail with every launch always amazes me!
I LOVE IT!!!! AS ALWAYS <3
do they ship international 😁
JEFFREE STAR : (last video) “ people keep saying i only come back to YouTube when i wanna sell something which isn’t true”  NEXT VIDEO: selling new products
lol my broke ass not being able to get any of his stuff
That crystal stiletto nails
I love the hair color you had in this video so pretty
Imagine the trap closed, instant Saw Movie 😹 🍿
Not digging this release style... I think it's the first time what he's saying feels rehearsed and pretty forced.
Is it me or the lipsticks look patchy on the model's lips?
How you say step out of our comfort zone and wear blue, but I don't see you wearing blue lol.
*Only people who didn't come from TikTok are worthy of liking this.*
Only people who didn't come from TikTok are worthy of liking this.
stun!!!
So we just gonna ignore the controversy orrrrr-
Yes lord can’t wait to order😍💕
Please collab with drag queen again with only ur product👏🥰
Leave that bear trap out for your ex, babe.
I am so excited for these! Medieval Kiss reminds me of a color I loved that Dior had once upon a time called Vamp. I just aged myself.... sigh.
why are you yelling
I wish I can affor It!!!💓😍🤞
No Androgyny shade?  Dang.  That’s my absolute favorite shade.
Here before million views and likes
What is the name of the song?
Is so breathtaking how his videos today dont reach the views he used to have
OMG your photo shoot was amazing!!! 😲 jazmina did amazing too!!!
Ethan would’ve lived for the black and red baby 🥺 I know he’s proud of you!!!
Jeffree you never disappoint!!
It looks buttery! I want to try!
After the stressful few weeks, these mystery boxes are the exact things to lift my mood! I'm so excited!!
Ugh I love "the perfect red" it looks so juicy! I love all of the shades but I usually only LIKE red shades I never really love em but that one had me hooked! absolutely flawless all of em! great work as always!
Beautiful colors
take a brek sweetie. you're flopping
I love everything so creative😍
I love how Jeffrey explains the design of the packaging. I can't wait to buy some lipsticks so I can see it in person.  I love all the detail!
doctor: “you have 16 minutes and 10 seconds left to live”   me:
Campaign is beautiful
Please don’t crash the internet again 😂
I just cant hate him :(
Packaging looks like a mini vibrator
I'm definitely getting a mystery  box
What time will the launch on the 16th be? I didn't catch it.
Me >sigh< " I really wish Jeffree would make a more dark burgundy/red shade.." Jeffree "Your wish is my command" 🖤Medieval Blood🖤
If I had the money I would’ve bought everything that was ever put out
First off thats the most green screen thing I've seen so far. Second, I'm bouncing till you follow through on releasing that foundation. Deuces.
Your amazing 😍😍😍😍 thank you for all you do!! I know its been a hard year but seeing you thrive is just what i need!! Stay safe and keep smiling 😍😍
Jefrees new video: you guys think I only come back for a launch Next video: *new launch*
Maybe I’m the only person that thinks stuff like this, but there is no way he is sitting like that ontop of his foot while wearing that heel. He’s totally wearing only one shoe lol
Where have theses been all my life!!! I need theses lipsticks right now 😫 😩
Hate all you want on JS but you can never hate the products he created. 🤍
I'm ready to spend half my pay check on the mystery box!! 🥰 I bought one last year it was the best!!
Jefree’s ideas, shoot’s everything is in another leveeeeeel Like no one see this fucking comings. QUEEN 💕 you slay this one big!
"But bitch! They're not Jeffre Star" ICONIC
Ok blackpink
He didn't say "exclusive cosmetic"  :(
JEFFREE 👏🏼 PLAYS 👏🏼 NO 👏🏼 FUCKING 👏🏼GAMES 👏🏼
Those shades are BOMB
Diggin' Jeffree's pink swath of hair.
I love how Jeffree literally called his red lipstick “THE perfect red” 😂 only Jeffree can dare to brag that way, he knows his makeup is high quality
Thats eye makeup is everything
Hey Jeffree do you think you could release the lipstick vault anywhere else but your own site? I’m not able to spend over $300 on lipstick with the conversion rate to Aud, shipping, and only having american after pay available which I can’t use in Australia it’s impossible for me to buy
14:49 Love 😌
*patiently waits for the foundation formula*
Jeffree's pink eye make-up is gorgeous.
When he got trapped
Did covid-19 die????? hello!! I have been watching you for 4 years now and u taught me a lot about makeup and been a fan of ur products never cared about the drama neither the cancel culture honestly but ... you are aware that the world is still suffering right? Hope u took all the precautions but seeing all of these people in ur video and only a few wearing masks , i just don't think it's the best time to do such a photoshoot
I have the nude vol 2 vault and omg I have to try the velvet trap formula BUT.....it's gonna be tough to beat the liquid formula!! So good
When I was in middle school I thought jeffree invented liquid lipstick when he first launched his liquid lip
Wow. That is some attention to detail with the packaging.
Gorgeous 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
the nails is so pretty
Still wondering when the new mini orgy palette is going to be sent out from the last launch flop.....
will the new lipsticks also be on BeautyBay? xo
Kind of sad that before all the drama, he would have had millions of views within his first few hours of posting this but not so much anymore... still love his make up 💕
No hate but I’m getting big Kim and Kylie vibes
There was no lip swatch for naked body 😔 that one was my favorite
of course he only came back to sell something
I’d give anything to own a single one of your products! They look so amazing and my entire vibe is pink pink PINK (my room, computer, everything is pink!) but unfortunately it’s probably never in the cards for me, I’m disabled with a back and hips that are fusing together so I can t work. But I’ll still do what I can to support your brand from a far! Love that pink outfit 😻
Is it just me but the lipstick looks like a mini pocket vibrator 😂 I prefer the older bullet packaging. Too bad I don’t work in his marketing I would of spoken up lol
The set looks so cheap
Anyone else notice how hot the male models and how beautiful the female models are like OMG 🥴😍
WHO IS SINGING IN BACKGROUND & DURING THE SHOOT???? ANYONE RECOGNIZE THE ARTIST?
SLAYYYYYYY
Is the launch just normal time ?
yesss ms mama
The RED CURLY HIGH PONYTAIL IS E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G 😱😍 STUNNING!!
The packaging... I’m S P E E C H L E S S
Missed Jeffree!
How are you still here
"Its a one pass highly pigmented formula"  *proceeds to pass it like 3 to 5 times on hands and lips when applied*
Gotta buy back those expensive “stolen” goods somehow
Wow that advertising  and the packaging oh my god
Jeffree really drops a collection when my tuition is due 😭😭😭
Mama Jeffree is killing the lipstick game again 😍Sickening! 🤩
Well ik what I'm getting as a late 21st bday present 🤩
BLACKPINK "LET'S KILL THIS LOVE!"
The collection looks amazing!!
Queen of lipstick
Cant wait!!
Do they vibrate?  Theyre giving me pocket rocket vibes.
Omg “so jaded “ the ARMY GREEN IS BEAUTIFUL! But I love them all . I need them all in my life. But I couldn’t even afford 1 lol 😂
The way he yells has  sham wow dude rolling in his grave.
See I can't be a Jeffree hater because thats my icon. Seeing someone come from absolutely nothing and build an empire around things they are passionate and happy about gives me hope for my life .
I love you 😘😘😘
What I find so cool is that the next launch after this is in my birthday month
The quality of JSC is hard to ignore 👍🏿
Hahahaha didn't he, in his last video, comment on how people think he is engaging in drama just to launch something and then, in his next video, he announces a new launch. Why do influencers do this when it is so obvious? Guess because it works.
Selling again 😑 oh dear god
Didn’t he deny people accusing him of pulling a Jaclyn Hill? (for being more active before a launch) But he posts one video after a month and has a launch all within a week. 🥴
"So Jaded"is totally "Dirty Money"s dark cousin
BUT>>>What time Friday??
“You only come back to sell products”  Jeffree: That’s not true :)  Also Jeffree: Hey guys so here’s my new lipstick
Congratulations again!
👏👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌🙌🖤🖤🖤
The behind the scene was amazing.
Oh is this the deleted scene from Blackpink Kill This Love?
😍😍
Jeff only shows up to sell something 😞
Every single time your creations never disappoint!!! Love the photo shoot and the vision! Just perfection!! 🤩
I'm getting knee pain just looking at how he is sitting the entire time lol
LOVE THE BACKGROUND MUSIC 😍
Jeffree everything you create is perfect!
I’m sorry but that set design is more than iconic
Umm i dont wanna like this but that quality  oof
Can't deny, Jeffree Star has a big brain to create those amazing creations :)
Omg yes
Yo did he just totally rip off Lisa Eldridge’s True Velvet Lipsticks???? Yes. 😒🤷🏼‍♂️😒
6:47 GODESS 👏🏽
But i get paid next Friday. I hope it wont sell out by then 😔
Thank you so much Jeffrey Star😙
i love how he only post when he's about to launch a product🥱
I need to buy some of these for myself for Christmas. I’m running low on unicorn blood so this is a great way to re-up!
Не подскажите пожалуйста, что за музыка играет на фоне с 5:12?
I wish i was able to afford this launch. I really want a mystery box but with how things are, rent and bills are more important. I'm sad that yet again i cant get a mystery box. And Halloween is my favorite holiday. 😥
Jeffree Lynn did it again! Killed it! Love him so much 😍
I love the blue one ..I hope I can get one 🔥❤
Gorgeous lipsticks
I want these so badly
Every time he opens a lipstick: beautiful shade, stunning red, stunning colour, this is soo beautiful, soo-cute. I love the shade.  Lol.
What do u think if  you push a little feffrey star on that lipstick right after  u apply  it on lips ? What do u think
Yas! Love that perfect red. I've always been known for a red lip. I picked up the habit  off my Nana Rosie. She never left the house without her red lipstick.
How can be just keep making videos like whatever.
ur wild but you have good product and I would be ur friend hehe
Ain't nothing wrong with a pretty bitch with weight on her 😉😘
Can’t wait to try the new formulas! They look gorgeous!
I wish Jeffree would come out with a mascara. He has everything you need except for mascara..
Looks like a kardashian product
I’m soooo excited for Unicorn Blood and a new mystery box!
Wow 💜 I just want everything from JSC
I can’t wait for everyone to not see my lips. 😷😷😷 hi mask. How are ya.
That red curly hair be doing him justice soooo pretty!!!!
People were right. He does only make a video so he can make money...then disappears until the next product.
I love those new lipsticks of u Jeffrey..Velvet Trap🔥
Oh lawd Jeffree just take my 💵 already!! Love your brand and makeup line so much!! So iconic it kills me! 💀 so shook and can’t wait to get my hands on these shades!! 👄 💄
I want at least 15 of these colors!  Awesome job!!!!
All shales are beautiful 💕💕💕💕💕
No one see your makeup when wear a mask
The naked body tho! 🔥🔥🔥
Really wish he would address why the mini orgy palette had so many problems
Jeffree, uploads a new video:   Haters: 👀 👀 👀 👀
I need that pink.  Gorgeous.  I didn’t see the hot pink being swatched. Did I miss it?
Yall switch up so fast.
Its so crazy the fact that I've watched your videos since your first ever launch, and the fact that you've come this far despite everything that has happened over the years. You are a fucking QUEEN and you deserve everything amazing that comes to you!! Beyond proud and still very inspired by you everyday xoxo (Also love all the shades but I love, love the perfect red)
That set designer is amaze balls. He deserves some kind of award.
If your afraid of color. “Can’t relate!” 🤣🤣🤣
I never got a chance to buy a lip ammunition they were so pretty especially the ones from the blood sugar collection those were my favorite 😭😭😭😭
I’m so glad it’s still a bullet♥️
Take a shot every time Jeffree says "beautiful" <3
I love it I'm excited! The majority of my make up is JSC top notch quality ♥️♥️
I'm not going to watch the video, but Jeffree do not have halloween party. Its not only selfish but also irresponsible. All love, please dont use your platform to do the wrong thing.
Love ittttt 💞💞💞
Is anyone else like ‘well, the big one is more cost per item than the medium one’?  Mini $12.50/item Premium $12/item Deluxe $12.50/item
Jeffree keeps making me jealous.
Mk mom is ur biggest fan she has jaw breaker and many more she is in love with ur vids please respond!:)
I want to be jeffree star rich. Where i can have random death traps in my home!
Absolutely beautiful , I can't wait to buy all of them.👄💄
You KNOW we lost it when we saw Perfect Red.
Issa NO from me lmao
The magnet is pretty brilliant
The new camera man suuuuuuuuuuuuuuvks
Wow this seems to be heavily copying Lisa Eldridge's velvet  lipstick line.
Colourpop,hi how are ya!
Love it! Great video. Thank you for getting back to work!! Keep doing you!
Yup...that deluxe is gonna be mineeee....fuck I can't wait 🌟✨🌟
Yessssss STAY UNBOTHERED 💕
Ya know, in his last video someone said something about jeffree only posts when hes going to launch something and he claimed that he would never do that but literally a couple days later he launches his new lips sticks? So jeffree, what is it?
The formula looks so luxurious ❤️
Jefree:  *Randomly appears in a giant trap with only some bomb lipsticks.*
Jeffree is the real life Willy wonka
it would’ve been cool if the actual trap was made out of black velvet
✨ICONICCCCCCCCCCCCC✨
I like the original packaging better
This is one of many reasons why I love respect jeffree, he’s all about Business and whatever he puts out.... he’s going to give you your moneys worth best quality amazing packaging, it’s not about your past it’s about what your going now 🤗💖 so much love plus team Scorpio ♏️
AAHHHHH *throws money*  Sooooo lovely. Thank you for your hard work! And thank you for leaving the animals alone 💓 I appreciate that you do your part to keep them safe! Xoxo I don’t care what anybody else says; you’re fab as f*ck!
The new lipstick looks smaller how many OZ are in it???
Jeffree has some of the best lip products in my opinion, he knows what he’s doing the packaging the shades the formula an the price is just amazing!  Whenever i wear his lipstick I always get compliments an ppl asking where I got it ! 👄
So JEALOUS to all the makeup gurus getting all of these for FREE 😝❤❤
Medieval is giving me life!!!  Omg!!  I need it!!!🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Can’t wait to try them WHEN I GET THE MONEY!😭😭
Love him perioooood! His makeup is fire bitches! Dont hate appreciate 😎
Ok Jefree, I am warding off all of the bad juju that’s been going on here lately. Dear Lord, please don’t let Jefree’s lipsticks have hairs in them. Also Lord we don’t want any bumpy balls in the lipstick thank you and amen!
wish you had come out with calabasas in this formula
Litttt the set is insane
Hmmmmm.....He  posted a video saying he doesn't only post on YouTube when he's announcing a new product, so he legit posts ONE video so it seems like thats not what he's doing?  I ❤ Jeffrey...but thats kinda hypocritical.
I don't support jeffrey 1 percent but theese lipsticks look bomb
I don’t understand why people say they hate him...
this is so ICONIC 🔥🔥🔥
I hope I can get one “my 23rd birthday is the 16th”. And I’ve been trying for years to get one. But every single time I try they are sold out.. so I’m hoping this year will be my year on my birthday 🥰🥰🥰
so far the halloween and valentines boxes were my favorite of your recent boxes
Black pick 😂😂😂😂😂 the set is hilarious
song please
My daughter -that's 4- said she wants your hair, your eyeshadow and your pink dress. She said it's her favorite lmao. Then she proceeded to say "I want that!" To. Every. Single. Shade. Of. Lipstick. Lol. Gonna have to get her some JS merch for xmas.   Don't come for me. Yes, she's 4 and she loves makeup. I don't wanna hear any shit about me letting her watch Jeffree Star. She only watches the reveals.  Her other favorite is Tati lol.  But She hates James Charles. Lol True story 😂
Love the photo shoot!!!! You should share that with us more often!!!
jeffree needs our help againn😅
“the retirement center”
Here before a million !! ❤️🙌🏼❤️💋💯
These are gorgeous new products and I absolutely love them! But I think the real question is.... how can he sit like that for a good 16 minutes 😟 my knees would be dying!!💕☠️
Jeffrey you made my 24 yr old daughter fall in love with makeup. Specifically your makeup. She picks out the eye shadow colors the night before.  She has 7 of your palettes and 15 liquid lipsticks. She bought me a t-shirt with your beautiful face saying can't relate. I love it. 💋💋💋💋
I’ve been a fan of jeffree for years but there’s no way for me to buy his products. Hopefully i can try them soon because seriously, just look at how beautiful those lipsticks are 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
all the drama and scandals don't matter...publicity is publicity.  and this product deserves the publicity. amazing product! great business style!
I really hope I can get at least one of the mystery boxes as my birthday is the same day as him. Would be a nice early birthday gift from me to me 😅
I’ve been waiting for the mystery boxes to come out I’m excited I get paid a day before so that mean ima get the deluxe one 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
Once again won't be able to get anything this launch. Being broke af because of this pandemic really blows.  😩😞
I was thinking the trap was just a dramatic intro. 5 minutes in and I’m realizing this is indeed the entire video 😐
Omfg those colors are to die for!!!
Why even wear the masks to have them down? Just sayin...
You are iconic 👑👑👑
New jeffree star headline drama ! ...... New release coming up
Girl not the time please
I love your background set
He look hella uncomfortable
Love It!! ♡love my JStar
Just take my money! 💰
“Only come back to YouTube to sell products” bit** he better use his platform to sell the product, he is running a massive business and needs to do whatever it takes to make his business successful, so shut up and enjoy
Velvet Trap? Is that a double entendre?
My birthday is on October 16th!! So excited
Sad cause I got a lot of compliments of Star Witness
Congrats to you and your team, these products look amazing xx
All of quarantine I refrained form buying makeup because obviously, my face is in a mask....BUT BABY CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY
I would buy but wearing a mask everyday for 12 hours at work just wouldn’t work lol
GO VEGAN JEFFREE <3
Wait... did I miss it or there’s no Androgyny? 🥺😭
Is just a copy of Lisa Eldridge “True Velvet Lipsticks”
I guess, BLACKPINK is no longer the only one who got trap in bear trap because jeffree is got one too... :)
If I'm a makeup whore, I'll buy!
for the box photo shoot those colors on the models were their colors!! They looked amazing
Oooh and medevil kiss it's the perf colour for me
New drinking game..everytime Jeffree says.. "SO" or "NOW"! lol I'm in love with these lipsticks! Congrats Jeffree! xo
Jeffree Lynn you have done it again sis! Can't wait to try this new formula!  And will definitely be snagging a box!
WE LOVE THE EARINGS!
Girl, I thought you were gone along with Shane. As you should be, I gotta block you or something.
that bear trap is a mood, jefree.
Jefree: *announces nystery boxes* Me: welp goodbye new paycheck
Damn! I've been waiting for Androgeny to come back in the bullet forever! Liquid lips don't work for me.
High quality, high vision, perfect formula = Massive Success to you!🙏💓👍
Sooo happy for you
Ahhhhhhh I love you 💕 everything looks and sounds amazing 🤩
Me:  *stanning jeffree star cosmetics, not jeffree. PERIODT
YAAAASSSSSS
"I feel like woman" lmfaooo
morgan adams unfollowed you oopf
❤️❤️
Omfg I'm so freaking excited for this launch of lipsticks and the mystery boxes!!! 😲💜😲💜
🧡 love when i see passion put to work. Thank you.
1 video ago, i would never come back to only launch my makeup
That make up tho🥰🥰 like him or hate him he still killing it😜
a makeup line designed around animal traps?....nah, im good..
Despite everything, Jeffree is still killin' it
The Velour liquid Lipsticks were AMAZING. Even tho I never tried them. ain’t tryn pay $40 for a lipstick for that amount I can literally design packaging and invent my own formula.
Jeffree is such a big company that I wish he used biodegradable packaging like Selena Gomez's Rare beauty line
I know he said it was launching friday the 16th but did he say a time 👀 because I cant recall if he did or not
So excited for some of these colors. However at this time I have to wear a mask at work all day and there’s no point in wearing lipstick😭 Once the mask is no longer required I will definitely be picking up a few of these.
can’t lie, Jeffree really be doing this makeup thing🥴
I wish i could sit like that ...
Why are these colors so beautiful!
No more Androgyny Lip Ammo !!!! 😰😰😰😫😫😫😫😓
i like the idea but how can we wear lipsticks during this time when we have to wear masks everywhere we go?
did anyone think it kinda looks like a vibrator-
I love it! I can’t wait to try them 🙌🏼. Packaging kind of reminds me of KKW though. Still, looks cuter 💯
Seeing him sit like this makes mt knees hips amd back hurt😂😂  I love the trap
On my birthday 😁
THIS IS ON MY LIST>_<
16:00 when jeffree uses his mirror as a coaster 😭
Wow wow this set up is insane
Omg I love this! I wish I had money to buy it though-
GORGEOUSNESS!!!!!
Velvet trap...sounds like a euphemism for vajayjay if you ask me lol!!!
If only I can buy it here in the Philippines 😭 LOVE THE SHADES😍
I want a tutorial on that eye look. Excited for the new formula yay!
If he gonna upload videos that aren’t just about his beauty products? Just regular things
Hi I’m hear to see if Jeffree still has fans.....what are y’all doing?!?! I really thought I’d come here and see like a lot less subscribers and comments saying what I’m saying..... I feel gross even giving him my view and comment....but enjoy it I guess lol. He really needed to be canceled and I’m disappointed how many people forgot about all he’s done just in the last 2 years, not to mention his past scandals
Jeffree send me all the shades please!!! A girl can dream right!?!
Do you guys not see the pattern? He’s putting a video up, then the next video after that is him trying to sell you stuff, then he goes MIA again. Are you guys still buying his shit ???
That montage reminded me of shane and jeffrees collab
So need your sexy lip swatches, doll! ❤️
@15:52 Why....why the air quotes around "holidays" ?
I’m confused, isn’t his biggest and best seller Androgyny? Where is that in this release? 👀
He just said he was not about to sell anything new ... I knew this drama was related
This is the most BEAUTIFUL lipstick launch shade ranges I have EVER seen!!!! Literally SICKENING 😍😍😍😍
I want them all ! Lol I can’t wait to get my hands on them ❤️🙌🏼🙌🏼
Good to have you back on YouTube, Jeffree! Missed you.
The fkn zoom... I miss Nathan’s brother...
Haven't watched Jeffree's channel ,  in quite a while .
I'm living for nudist colony!
i absolutely respect the fact that after a "scandal" he's able to brush it off and continue to build his company. unlike other youtubers just stay quiet for the months to follow.  mad respect!
BRILLIANT MOVE....  MAGNETIC CAP SO IT WONT COME OFF 🤣🤣❣❣❣❣❣
Okay but WHO is that Latino model? He’s fine! What’s his IG @ though? 👀
is this trap stage inspired by blackpink music video dduu ddu ddu or something?
THOSE NAILZZZ GURL 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I want it in every shade. I don’t care that it looks like my tampons
How is jeffree a god
All I ask Jeffree if he can give all the lipstick he used in the video. He probably will not use it anymore.
I really dont understand why we have to bring up everyone's past and be rude to Jeffree we dont talk about anyone's past unless it is related to something to do with problems today Jeffree has said MANY times he is not the proudest of his past but for some reason we still have to bring it up...
Idk why I was scared the whole video that the trap was gonna close 😅
I feel bad for him he’s don’t get his views any more and he’s make up is so good and always different to everybody else’s s and it’s affordable so i hope he goes back to how he was ❤️ love u mr star
You really do only want to talk when you're trying to sell something 😬😂
Here at 482K ❤️👸🏼 glad he's back!
The comment section be like: *even if he killed someone, his makeup is the best*
Meh
Take a shot every time Jeffree says "of course" RIPPPPPPPPPPPPP
Launching Oct. 16th???  My birthday!  Happy birthday to me!  Woo-hoo!! ❤😊
C'mom Jeffree... address the article...
Can he just come out with his own store! I want a jsc outlet.
Your makeup is stunning ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Hey darlin’ just wanted to say that even after these months my heart still breaks for you and that I admire your real-ness #scorpio but just love you and your products which I would never be able to find anywhere else that works with my eyes and skin tone well like you and love your inclusiveness throughout ALL of your line
Sorry but my black ass buying this 😭🤦🏾‍♀️
Jeffree baby,  I need to talk to your cameraman
I hope is no stickers in the mystery box
5:53 YOURE WELCOME
My broke ass really told me no💅🏼 👁👄👁
His shade range is Beautiful !!!! ❤️❤️😶
Pleeeeeeeease let Afterpay be available for this Friday and praying for no crashing of the website. Need these in my life 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
Can Friday come any sooner 😍
I love watching him and I love the lipstick shades! The dark colors slay!!
Can't wait for the launch, loving using the lipsticks.
But what was that song???
Hi 🙋🏻‍♀️ these lip colors are EVERYTHING 🤩
Ngl that tracksuit is everything 😍😍😍😍
Thought Jeffree bought the BLACKPINK ‘kill this love’ MV set
Jeffee really putting ppl at risk of catching corna  getting them to do a photo shoot
So excited for the velvet trap lipstick!!!!! Love you jeffree!!!!!
5 hours in and still hasn’t reached a million views??? Mhhhmmmm... I wonder why.
Do YouTube more please Jeffery
Okay but i really appreciate the $18 per lipstick. Mac sell their bullet lipsticks for $25 each omg and it’s nothing special about it, and here we have a masterpiece wow
is it just me or does he always “address drama” right before he puts out a launch..... loved jeffree but idk abt this one
Is this a green screen or? I’m obsessed with it all
Hermosos 💛♥️🧡💜💚🖤
That packaging tho...LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Love you Jeffree !!! You are ICONIC BABY
I kept trying to figure out what the lipstick was reminding me of...it looks like a fever reducer suppository. Yep. Remember giving one once to one of my kids when they were very sick.
Everything is lovely as usual
packaging brought to u by platex sport LMAO
Pure x Barbie have that exact velvet look I love it! It’s my fav lip stick I still haven’t used it
Omg i legit hate jefree but he always makes the best makeup and i cant help but buy it
Anyone else gonna talk about the fact the packaging looks like an egg vibrator?🙈
Love the shade hot comottitty
I bet the new lipsticks were launched because they look much more difficult to counterfeit than the older ones
Omg i need medieval kiss. I can relate honey ❤️❤️🤤🤤🤤🤑
Sooo basically all ur getting is a new box
I don't wanna like your products but i do
I’m surprised he’s not selling the lip ammunitions on sale?? They’re just gone from the website. Shame. He must have tons of it in stock in his warehouses.
Best wishes on the Velvet Trap products! But I’m sure you won’t need it! You got the Midas Touch! 😉❤️ Aloha from NE!🌺
Jeffreestar is so beautiful   Who loves jeffree give this a bottoms up👍
Love ya so much! ❣️keep doing u babe n don’t let anyone slow u down ! Love so much make up you recommended but yours the most, like you said it’s not Jeffree Star Bitch! So yeah gotta get Jeffree Star! Your pink ESP during October breast cancer awareness month is on point BUT your nails! !!!, 💞 love ya doll keep that beautiful held held high like ya always do! 😘💞💞❣️💝 OMG the lipstick prints in it 🥰
baby diarrhea green
When he showed the close up of the texture I said “WOOOAAAHHHH” out loud, I’m actually SO IMPRESSED
Is Jeffrey ever going to make regular videos again?
🌺
Shut up
I have a hard time finding a good lipstick...cant wait to try this! And the nails girl are FUEGO!
Echo echo echo...... 🗣🗣🗣
Now all the boyfriend drama makes sense
So so soooo glad you’re back, we’re missed you JS
That black girl is SERVING looks, holy shit
Girl, I think you left out swatching watermelon soda, but I think I saw it on your hand at one point though! Can’t wait to get a better look at that one on the lips! 😍
Everyone looks amazing but can we get some curvy girls in these shoots?
Fire your sound guy! The echo is so bad!
Launching on my birthday!! 😀
Launches on me birthday! Know what I’m getting hahahaha love the greens mmmmmmmm
You should do a lip or eyeshadow collection of greens and call it Chernobyl. Have the names be like ''toxic waste'' and all of that type of stuff, I think it'd be soooo cool
I literally can't relate because I can't wear matte lips. 🙁
Any blinks immediately thought of kill this love
HELP MEEEEE. DONT COME AT ME LIKE THAT
I JUST CAME FROM THE vid where Jeffrey and his bf broke up but I haven't watched in a while so are they still together or naw and sorry is you see this Jeffery and you are broken up and this hurts.. Have a good day! AND OMG YASSSSSSSS
Blackpink 🤭🤭🤭
If only we didnt all have to wear masks everywhere. I miss the days when my Jeffree lips weren't pointless. Definitely attempting to get one of them mystery boxes though
Jeffree was probably inspired by Blackpink 😄
Whether you like jeffree or not his brand is amazing and he stays coming out with better things.
So it's true then, that he always makes an scandal and a new video everytime that some new product is coming out.
As cool as this product is, I feel like most of the shades won't work on dark complexions. I feel like quite a few of them won't work on me and i'm really pale. idk if thats just me though. I haven't seen anyone talking about it
Just reading the comments, hoping someone knows what song he used 😭😭
def gotta cop a few lipsticks and a mystery box 😘😩❤️
Drill sergeant, pure hell, and celebrity skin 😍
Love, love.
So jaded just stole my heart
Oh!  My poor wallet!  See you on Friday!  💄💋
They are bomb 🔥
Girl this video
Take my money!!! I cant wait!
😅Would be sooo amazing if jeffree made 2 fake Jeffree pink guns to put the bullets in🙌💖 love the colors
So is he still going to sell his liquid lipsticks or did he just completely replaced them with these new lipsticks?
I can’t wait!!!
OMG!!! it's surprising, I love them❤️✨
Of course the ONE FRIDAY I WORK THIS MONTH is when the Halloween boxes are coming out. GRRRRRRR!!!!!!!
Just tell me, who swatches on palm?🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
omg yes jeffree we stan. jk
Why is he sitting like that again. My knees hurt
I love that “pulling a dick out” sound it made when he pulled the top of the box off.
👁️👄👁️
Its a little boring
Random thought: I should be lips model haha.
GIRL you really just posted one video to then promote your “new” makeup collection...🥱
Stunning🥳
Take my money 💕
What song is in the background??
I love all of this so much
I don’t care what others says but she does release a bomb ass products❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍
If you’re scared of red .... I can’t relate 😂 I friggin love him ❤️
I hate that I'm working on the 16th 😭
So ready my aunt is getting me one for my birthday!!! It’s Thursday but better late than never
The campaigns always look like an over the top masterpiece! Seriously a dream to be a model for them. They’re always so cool!
His reveal videos are always FIRE 💖💖💖
Mine black for my tiktok transfomation
I love it 😀 😍 ❤
Anyone else yelling yes at these colors like watching a football game??!
Jeffree you look tired and unhappy, cheer up all my support goes to you! Congratulations on this new launch all the lipsticks look beautiful, keep it up! ♥️
Selena red......PERIOD! Love it
**literally doesn't wear makeup and has no money** Me: wow this is so cool I'm so excited!!
I still like him and his products regardless of the media. He should make a palette or color called stunning. That damn word is said constantly
Yaaassss!!!💗💗💗💗💗
Jeffree, you are so pretty B*$%h!    LOVE you!
Wowwwww
Grey lipstick 🤦🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️holy molly who wears grey lipstick???
Rich lux called this
All the custom packaging and custom imprinting on the lipstick will make it hard to copy/fake. Clever girl 😉
Posing like an ✨Afghan hound✨
OMG, the new packaging looks SO similar to Kylie Cosmetics?! :O
Jeffrey WHY do you launch a new lippie when we all gotta wear masks???  🙈🙈🙈 I 💚💚💚 you but DAH!!!💋💋💋
OMG why does the lip tube looks like kylie
"one swipe lipstick"  * proceeds to swipe a dozen times *
The sound of the echoing in the Velvet Trap. lol
Please start making nail polish too! You make the best stuff
Ok I love you Jeffery, but I haven't bought any makeup of yours, don't be mad.  Lips are my thing though and you just hit a winner here. I am buy these lipsticks as soon as it is a click away! Love you
Beautiful colors ❤️
Jeff, feels like the shopping Channel , u should apply!
LOVE LOVE the grey wig with the pink swoosh.... i GOTTA have it....
Gorgeous colors, the imprint on the lipstick is so inventive,no one else has done this before.  I don’t  care what you say his products are bomb.
Totally Excited!!!!!
bitch i can’t wait for star skin 2021 or whatever u call it lmao WE WANT IT BIIIIITCH LOVE YA
I am NEVER going to be able to afford ANYTHING from Jeffree Cosmetics earning in Colombian Pesos. This makes me sad.
Can’t believe he spends so much money on such lame set-up.. RIP all that money 💰
Hi does anyone know the name on the back round of the photo shoot
For real get a new camera man last vid was zooming this is out of focus.
Did everyone just ✨Forget✨ :))
Could of known a new product was gonna be launched after all the drama online lately
Hey Jeffree , I doubt you will see this but it’s worth a shot. I’m 33, and I have been battling cancer for the past year! After multiple surgeries, radiation, chemotherapy, and lots of pain I am on my way to hopefully beating this! BUT , my stomach is butchered THE HOUSE, my hair and eyelashes are gone, I am going through early menopause, can’t have sex, and they don’t tell you how much cancer steals your womanhood. Like your lipsticks, I am looking for a whole new vibe. PLEASE, I am beggging you, help me find myself again and feel like a woman again with some amazing jeffree star swag! You are my idol and you are so incredible. Please help a sister out of this depression and out of this bed and into some beautiful makeup again. 💜🧡💛
Maybe I’m the only one noticing that Lipstick Nick is absent for this shoot even though she has been one of his mainline artists for all his campaigns...and according to Instagram, they do not follow each other nor are they communicating and haven’t been referencing each other since about June....?...Sad .
Rather give my money to Laura n Manny.  They arent pretentious or shitty.  Theyre funny and real.  Have a gorga day.
Coping Lisa Eldridge I am not here for.
but like, whose even wearing lipstick right now? should I smear it on the outside of my mask?
Question: did LipstickNick also do the makeup for this photoshoot, like all the previous ones? I don't see her mentioned anywhere... AWKWARD... :-/
I’ve never been more exited for a lip stick launch in my life
Carli Byble came out with the almost same design on the lipstick with Ilmakiage if hers were bomb his might be too 😍
Hold up. Let me run take out a loan so I can get ALL of these 🏃🏼‍♀️ 💨
Why is he screaming?
Two launches on the same day! Cheers to 4 hours of refreshing & restarting!  😁 The lipsticks seemed to go on patchy & pull at the lips. Gonna wait for the reviews on those but I want Halloween Boxes!  🎃🕸️
I wonder if you are getting another pop socket or stickers as your exclusive item?  Maybe he could/should show what those are since many of us feel burned by the last mystery box.
Hopefully Jeffree will make eyeliner and mascara product
Can't deny that his makeup is the absolute best👌
Piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiink 🤗😛🥰
Jaclyn had fuzzy velvet lipsticks before it was cool😂
Medieval kiss!!! I love it!
Love you!!!
WHERE IS THE LOVE FOR PURPLE!!!!?
Please do this teacher a favor and stop launching during the school day! Last year I missed it because we had a fire drill!!!
nudest colony or whatever is so stunning 🤩
Can u try the "One Dip Makeup Challenge"
L O V E
Mmmmm.....  Velvet  name.... Velvet texture...  Lisa Eldridge....just saying
I feel like lately all the reveal videos, the camera is way too far away.
I am obsessed with your nails
Everyone: "Shut your trap" Jeffree "smoken-a-J"  in that velour tracksuit: I can make money off this.💅 😂😂😂 Send i!t love it! 💜
Girl.... I love all your make up. I'm saving up a little so I can grab the cremation line. That's absolutely gorgeous.
I mean damn I’m not 30 seconds in and I realize like I do every single time I watch your videos, why I love them so much! It’s a fantasy land!
I mean, I get it, you're a brand owner, but then maybe you should've left out the "I'm not coming back when I have something to sell" remark in your last video, lmao.
CHROMATICA?
Guys, are we still buying canceled muas makeup in 2020 still ?
When they said he only uploads bc he’s fixing to sell something..oof
BITCH TAKE MY MONEY!!! 💕 LUV LUV IT. yet i am still want my Androgyny
Did you really call Trisha fat?
I was watching this in class (yes I have WiFi in school so cool) and this guy comes up to me and says wow that girl is flat😂  I was using my air pods  It’s 2020 you can be whoever you want
My name is not five weenies I am shoto from ua and I want to become a hero
love the details
Honestly love his brand.... Im gonna grab a few of these shades....
I would just die for a mystery box UGH !! Love all your products.
I can’t get over the shouting echoes... it so distracting
So just posted the other day ........because you have something to sell....😡
Quien me los regala alv :v
A lot of occultic symbolism I saw 🙃
Id love the shade breakfast at tiffanys in this
BEAUTIFUL colors you choose for your lip sticks
THE MYSTERY BOXES YASSS
Cant wait want them all.
Y'all fell into his trap I don't see how y'all still buddy buddy with this lying ass manipulative pink highlighter!?!
How can you tell which lip is which? Is there any indication without having to open each one?
Ohhhh 🎃
Uuuuum wooooow🤨
I can't believe he went with the bear trap idea. I'm no bleeding heart vegan by a long shot. BUT... traps like this are one of the most horrible ways to die. Traps are chained to trees so the animal can't get away. More often than not the animal dies from starvation before being harvested. Some animals chew their limbs off to get away. Most that get away on their own have broken or missing limbs. When the hunter comes and the animal is still alive it's clubbed to death or shot. The whole time the animal is trapped it's experiencing absolute terror and pain. I just can't believe Jeffree used this! I'm in shock. I would never buy anything from this palette on principle. I don't care how great it is.
Alright Jaclyn Hill we see you 🙄
Please review Selena Gomez rare brand
🔥💯💖💓✨💫😘😍💸😎💙💗🎨🎨🖌️🖍️🖍️🖌️💄💄💄😍🖤💋👄🎀
Sadly, lipstick is not worth the purchase right now. We are all still wearing masks. Shrug.
Omg! Jeffree you've done it again!
Chile, If I was this rich I wouldn’t know what to do with my money. 💀
LOL, making one video update in MONTHS, immediately followed by a product launch? Jacklyn Hill is rubbing off on U, Jeffree! I just hope Ur lip sticks don't have the same hairy problems hers did... Hopefully the Velvet Trap is not an actual TRAP! :D XOXO ;)
That trap has me gagged oml
Omg he just had a scandal and now he’s releasing a product/collection???? WHAT A COINCIDENCE WHO WOULD’VE THUNK IT
I would’ve done the lipsticks in a grey metallic packaging rather than baby pink, they give me Kylie skin vibes lol
I'm so excited for this release. Jeffree you are going to have to make clear face masks.Up here in Canada we cant go out in public without a mask.😪Your lipstick is too awsome to cover.
Congrats on the product, good luck on the sale. I hope it goes successful...
Wtf looks fuckn good
No matter what anyone says u can never take away the fact Jeffree is a creative genius!
Claim your "Here before 1 million views" ticket here
These are so gorgeous!
I hate how he announces it ONLY 3 days before launch... like girl give us more notice so I can save money!!!!!
👀
ah yes, all is revealed... why that André scandal broke out last week, such pristine timing, coinciding with a launch of a new product ⏱😏
Are we just never gonna talk about how shady Jeffrey is or are we just gonna turn a blind eye and mindlessly give him money he doesn’t deserve?
But will the boxed get here by Halloween? If it gets to N.C. on nov. 1 I ain’t gonna be feeling it lol
Beautiful
Loved the behind-the-scenes looks of developing the promo shots! 😍 omfgg... I can't even imagine what it's like getting glam'ed at Star Studios! 🌠
I CAN'T WAIT until I can afford Jeffree Star make-up and merch items! I've never owned anything like his high quality stuff! Not only am I on a fixed income because I'm severely disabled but I also help my sister with clothing for her 6 kids when I can. Anyways this is not a sob story, I'm just saying when I  finally get my one lipstick I swear you'll see me in so many pictures being my own hype person lol! 💜💚💜💚💜💚💜 you Jeffree! Your realness is amazing and so are you!!!!!
Hey Jeffree what time will it be in the UK 🇬🇧 when it all launches?? Previously missed items & sold out! Thank you! 😍😍
he said i dont come back to youtube to post new products and does just that
Periodttt
Whats the song starting @ 4:58 ?? 🤔
The set up is amazing !!!
I'm FUCKING GAGGING!!!!! I'm also so glad I got to see how velvet trap will look when it's all over my face and wiping the corners of my mouth just isn't enough 🤤😂😘😜♏
So excited for ya!
I'm so excited!! 😍 I love Jeffree and his makeup brand! No one does it better! His brand is high quality and he doesn't put out boring shit like every makeup brand out there. I can't wait until he comes out with a foundation or even skincare line! I'm definitely going to purchase❤❤❤
OMG The giveaway is on my birthday fuck yeah 🥳🥳🥳
"These are all one swipe formulas".  Proceeds to swipe them 3 or more times for every single one.
Well there goes my bank account 🤑 I am living for this formula!
I’ve never seen a brand so consistent with product and marketing, thinking outside the box and doing bigger and newer things than jeffree star cosmetics. I love every campaign shoot he has 🤰🏽
Is her really promoting his VEGAN formula products from the center of a giant steel leg trap that catches animals and causes them unimaginable pain and suffering before they are brutally murdered? Wow. What a tone deaf twat.
Out on my birthdayyyyy
I can’t wait to try it!!!  Love you Jeffree!
Oh wow! Fire starter and Unphased... I MUST own these! So gorgeous!!!! We love a perfect Red-orange & such a cool weird Chartreuse green type color! Mind blown!!!
I actually think I'm going to buy something after all these years of saying I want something! What color lipstick should I buy if I am very tan naturally and my veins are blue? I guess I have an olive complexion??
As problematic as you may be, one cannot deny that your products are of high quality
Male model was 🔥🔥🔥😭🤤🤑
I'm proud of myself for being early* not really tho* :<
i need to know who is the model with the chest tattoos 🥵
The set up is like so extra...
kinda wish the trap would shut
I want to be a plus size model!!! Love you so much!!!!!
I loveeeeeeeee it 😍❤️❤️
Sending endless love and well wishes xo
Danggggg girl! Thank you for making such quality items.
Everything launching the same day, really trying to leave me more broke 🥴
TAKE MY MONEY ✨✨✨
I hope i cam actually get ahold of a mystery box🤞🏼🤞🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Jeffree mayb LOUD but hes makeup is LOUDER 💯
JeffreeStar- We got a  new formula for the lipsticks!!!  Everyone: Doesn't sell out
I seriously love Jeffree and all his products are the best 😘 ❤️
The reason why JC cosmetics will always be my favorite is because it's outside the box. Not cookie cutter simple, or basic. Your soul goes into all of it and it shows. Thank you for always being different.
Wow this is stunning.  Pls help me by subscribing to my account.  I AM POSTING EDUCATIONAL TV LESSONS FOR MUSIC AND ARTS 🥰🥰🥰
Its unbelievable all what this guy has achieved and what he will. Truly 100% self made.  Love you Jeffree
It looks like a vibrator lmao
girl they look dry...
Jeffree using his mirrors as coasters 🤣 sameee
OMG I LOVE IT...!!!! 😍👑💄
Glad he found a new camera man😂
Oooo kylie skin is getting an extension?
Jeffrey is so creative. The packaging is sick. I just hope he stays out of trouble going forward.
Jeffree last video : People say I came back to YouTube when I need to sell something   Everyone : yes yes you do   😂
Oh. My gosh. Gagged. That gray color is so pretty! It's Jeffree Star though, all the lipsticks look amazing!
The echo is terribly distracting... I'm really over the matte lipstick trend too
Hola
Jeffree good evening!!!! Florida in the house. Wondering if you can help a 65 year old with what it is you put on your lids prior to shadow. If you could please give me the name.  I’m trying to apply makeup on much lighter than you show us but the same.  Just love the videos you are very talented and o wish I can meet you in person one day
it looks like the same packaging as lunatick cosmetics....
u need to do vid were among us picks ur makeup
Am I the only one who noticed he completely ignored watermelon soda?😬
Jeffery this new awesome superior velvet trap Stunningly beautiful delicious amazing . Wow , wow , wow ! My birthday is Halloween so I've got to treat myself 😊❤️❤️ Jeffrey I love love love you unique design , style & excellent flawless colour explosion that is beyond vibrant & superior stunning colours , I'm in Love with your new range 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕 xxx
I want to buy the lipsticks... but I cant wear them under my mask lol
The shade nudist colony is stunning. I just wish it was more affordable. $18 is alot for most people to spend on a single item. Or I wish once in a while you would offer real clearance prices for discontinued items. Lets be honest, so much will be thrown away. Or perhaps, an option to purchase slightly damaged items. 🤷
SOOOOOO FUCKING GLAD TO SEE YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE!!!!! You were missed!!!!!!!!💖⭐️ can’t for what is next!!!!!!!!!!⭐️💖
Thank God these things always come out on payday! I’ve been waiting on a new lipstick formula FOREVER!!!
Damn he snapped!😍
Are you going to do more liquid lipstick
Where's the watermelon swatch? Lol was there a glitch
WE WANT LIP BALM
I don’t even wear make up nor have I ever tried but I always come to watch Jeffree’s videos because I’m a fan. He always keeps it interesting and NEVER BORING! 🤣 💙
Jeffree you didnt say the time it stats
OMG! Gorgeous! Of course I have a $673 electric bill due Friday,I hate that I’m going to miss them!!!!! Love ya Jeffree ❤️💚🧡💙💜💛
Qué perros! 🤩
I need a NEON RED shade please 😘
lipstick looks bomb but lacking a lot of iconic shades of the brand
Idgaf about all the drama surrounding Jeffree, I still love him !
Omg they are beautiful
Yesterday: "Dang I am broke" Today: "ohhhhh I'mma get tat"  life choices...smh
Oh it launches on my birthday!! I love it!
Looks like a mini velvet vibrator 💄
400k views and 17 mil subscribers, but 5k comments, seems like somebody is deleting some comments
I live for those velvet traps 😍😍😍😍😍
*makes a green shade* OH MY GOD ✨stoner vibes✨
I want all your makeup line!!! It's AMAZING
Jeffree’s views aren’t the same anymore. . . 💔
Hi Jeffree. Will it be possible to make the top of the bullet the color of the lipstick inside so I can differentiate them? They're all pink and look the same from the outside.
masterful advertising
I really feel like I should dislike him but I just can't.  In an often cookie cutter world, he is a true original and visionary.  His products are bomb and these red nails a SICK.  I mean, look at this video.  Who else does this?  Amazing!   Whether you support him or not, nobody does it better.  Does anyone else think the component reminds you of a tampon?
All the shades are so beautiful.
His photo shoots are always amazing and crazy. I would love to do a huge photo shoot like his if I had my own brand
Missing Darker hot pink
As someone whos been on a team of models before that sh*t is tiring AF! I don't know how you guys went through all those makeup changes, I swear my skin itself would be tired from that!
I like how he uses the hand mirror as a coaster. Lmfao
That was slick asf
Can’t wait to place my order Friday ...
What’s the song name?
you are really pretending nothing happened huh?
Lisa Eldridge has had a "true velvet" line for a while now btw.  :)
What a beautiful campain!
I feel like Jeffree Star will be a huge designer name in fashion/makeup one day. This seems like a big upgrade!
Its monogram print on the lipstick  itself  for me. That was bomb af! Love the tiny intricate details!
😱😱 can’t deny how JSC always delivers with products and CREATIVITY!!! I luv luv luv those pictures!!!!
AGAIN WITH THE ZOOM ISSUES HAHA
I'M ALL ABOUT MEDIEVAL KISS!!!!  YAS QUEEN!
Hoping for metallic shades at some point. Seriously, the metallic lip ammunitions are probably my favorite lip product ever. Bummed that they’re gone for good.
Soooo no one is going to talk about how unoriginal this is? Lisa Eldridge has literally done this down to the velvet look of the bullet itself and the magnetic closure on the tube. I think I’ll give my money to the real queen.
okay but am I the only one getting anxiety from the pointy metal of the trap? please Jeffrey we love you don’t impale yourself 🤯😳🙆🏼🤞🍈😫😓🤏
Jeffrer after missing in youtube for months, then after 1 vid here she is exposing and selling her new product. Duh she's just using yt to promote her brand eew.
OMG I already loved the ammo! I love this new aesthetic!!!!! Bravo!!!
Yo no sé muy bien del inglés, pero siempre te veo porque Rosy Mcmichael hace reseña a tus productos y eso me encanta.
I want them all... 😫😭😫😭
What’s the song playing at 6:01
Clever hidden ghost name Jeffree .... awesomeness
he literally just said he didn’t come back to YouTube to sell stuff yet here we are.... 😴
Its the him deleting comments for me🥰
He looks so good tho
No Calabasas or androgyny?
I may have to try and get one of these mystery boxes, have zero beauty products. Had to toss them all.
Literally copied Lisa Eldridge velvet lipsticks 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I really hope he makes a Calabasas and Androgyny in this formula
Me watching Jeffree: The AD: what does it take to be an evil overlord?  YouTube savage asf 😭💀
💗💗
Lisa Elderidge recently released her true velvet line of lipsticks. I guess velvet lips are trending and the actual lipstick tube looks the same except minus the star logo. The packing is totally different. I guess great minds thinks alike!
Jeffery, YOU'RE the velvet trap.
I am screaminggggg!! I need to set a reminder on my phone!!
Can’t waiiiit!!! I wonder if afterpay will be available right away when it launches or an he after?
How are people still supporting him? Disgusting.
Very Chromatica 😍
I want to buy some of these and then I think about how I have to wear a mask everyone even all day in my office...#Sadface
Is it just me or does this look awfully similar to Kylie skin packaging? 👀 Not interested.
I am living for the magnetic lid! Very unique and useful! Beautiful shades!!
I can’t wait to add this lipsticks to my JStar collection!!
😍❤ so excited! Can't wait to try the new formulas and try to get the mystery box! Love you Jeffree!!
Random asf but is the style like the MAC starring you collection? Like velvety like those?
Oh look.. a product launch days after his "update"  🙄
He's acting very sus 🤔
ugh...choices to be made.  If only I was rich!
Genius. Love them all:
😲
I mean for the jeffree quality product  18$ is very affordable
Wow... just wow
I’m so excited to try this new lip sticks! Hands down the best cosmetic line out there and I’m stoked about the lipstick holders 😍😍
How does Jeffree not get pins and needles sitting like that 😂
I'm so excited!!!!!
Just hate we can't play with these because we have to wear a mask 😢
GIRLLL I HAVE A PROBLEMMM..... I WANT THEM ALLLLL❤️🤩
3 days ago: I’m not going to use this drama to launch a new product  3 hours ago: I’m in a velvet trap 👄
Did u come back just for ur releases
Jeffree I love you, but it would be nice to know that a product is retiring before it’s completely gone
Kinda looks like a tampon applicator.... not gonna lie
Is it me or is he loosing subscribers
Take a shot every time Jeffree says “Stunning”!
Yayy!! Can’t wait 😍
Can’t wait to buy. JSC lipstick is back in the game. Although I wish you put the shade names on the screen as you were talking about them because I tend to watch your videos while I’m cooking or something and glance over because I couldn’t hear you, and miss the shade name. Not that I can’t look online of course. Keep up the good work! Maybe I can afford myself a Halloween box this year !
For some reason I feel like someone is gonna hurt Jeffree. I swear 2020 be crazy. No hate
Willy Wonka
Oh my God! They are sooo beautiful. I wish I could have them.
Can’t stop thinking about the taser thing ...
Jeffrey's makeup
Jeffree Star: “I don’t come back to YouTube and make videos just to launch a product.” Also Jeffrey Star, just two days later: “Look I’m launching a new product.”
Didn't show much of Lipstick💄Nic..... Just HER hands
SO, the recent "drama" was just about generating buzz for a launch.... K.
Sadly I’m too poor to afford anything this time around
i love this my trap queen!
You got pins and needles didn’t you?
His legs are gonna hurt
A Trump ad though....... 😵😵😵😵
the uploaded a video  three days ago with a clickbait video and NOW you're coming out with products? that is so laughable
Omg cant wait I freaking love that nude pink 😍😍😍😍🙌🏻 yassss 🥳👏🏻
Lipstick 💄 looks beautiful
Jafar is back
Guys his/her/IT MAKE UP ARE THE SAME JUST DIFFERENT NAME AND MINOR DESIGN CHANGE 🤷🏿‍♂️
I think it would have been awesome to keep the sliver part.
❤❤❤
im getting like 8 of them
I wish you would make a Halloween palette
Now I know what to get this Christmas. ❤ Love the shades.
Jeffree 💜
These remind me of Lisa Eldridge’s velvet lipsticks from a bit ago. These are so pretty.
Remember when his lipstick swatches were him putting them all on?
When you set a reminder on your phone 30 minutes before the release on Friday. 😅
Why?!?!? Just why now that I dont have any money?!?!?!😖😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Is it me or does the trap looks like one of blackpink music video 💀
Love these colors,love you more😜
I’m 48 and love his makeup. Too chicken to wear the bold colors.
😍🥰😘🥰😍🥰😘🥰😍🥰😘
Launches on my b-day!! Yay!
In your last video you said you didn’t come back to sell stuff.......... the next video is you trying to sell stuff?
You need to do a unicorn blood set also a celebrity skin set whit every formula in each set
A MA ZING! ❤
Yaaaay so excited for the Halloween boxes!!! 👏🏼🎃👻💀
who even watches js anymore? seriously i was a fan and not bc of all the drama.. bc i dont know the drama, i just know i havent purchased from him since 2019 and i just cant relate to her anymore.. the whole beauty community is going downnn and to hear that js talked bad bout trisha skin and stuff like js have several seats.. the hate you spur is the reason u are ALWAYS IN DRAMA bc thats all u have.. smh.. u over due every video bc u have to make up for how boring u are .... from a ex buyer!
Why are you sitting like that
15 year old me would have loved that black
I NEED JSTAR SKIN PRODUCTS, NOW !!!
OMG! Those colors are amazing! Decisions, decisions,....
Can we just look at how she was able to sit like that?! For this entire video?  Like ghurl?!!!!  Imma get me cramps..
Jeffree: you only need one swipe to have that beautiful color also Jeffrey: continuously colors the lipsticks onto his hand like a child using a crayon
I love that you're not afraid to be who you are. I loved how you sat with your legs out. ❤❤ you're amazing
The colors are stunning 😍
GIRL!! I have followed you since MYSPACE!! It always makes me so happy for you when you launch a new product!! I KNOW you WORKED hard to get to where you are!! Stay amazing!!
Yes jeffree you set the trend with the mystery boxes 💯
Wish the mystery boxes were put on beauty bay so I could get it without paying out my ass for customs to the UK
don’t we not like you anymore
The PHOTOSHOOT IS JUST WOW. Amazing! But i feel like the drake looking dude model isn’t feelin it(?)
So many shades I want🥺 I have my eye on "perfect red" "unicorn blood" and "dominatrix"❤️
formula looks amazing!!! but i've seen many brands do the glitter overspray before Mac and Huda
Not the first time it's been done, Lisa Eldridge did a similar formula although with only shades of red, but excited for these colours!
Don’t care if you love him or hate him, his makeup is top notch.  Will only use his liquid lip, and his eyeshadow formulas are amazing.
Two times the packaging for one lipstick?? Yes queen destroy the planet 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍✨✨✨✨✨✨
lmao you are so funny
she just makes the BESST PRODUCTSS ❤️❤️❤️‼️‼️👀👀
All the colors look amazing, but, the black is popping. Looking forward to that one.
“Here before 500k views” people where ya at?
y do I want a mystery box
That red tho !!! Ughhh love it
Recently you’ve been pulling jaclyn hill moves 🤦🏻‍♀️
*whether you like him or not, you can’t deny his makeup is top tier*    edit: bruh i never said his palettes are better than everyone else’s and i was never defending his drama. all i’m saying is his brand is often high quality and consistent. peace
Check out my YouTube channel 💕💕
Of course she releases a product after she apologizes/address an issue.
why is called trap?
Even if its night this sis will just say goodmorning how are yaa .. I'm dead haha
He catches his scandals and buries them with that beartrap...
I'm so glad your back again 😭
he released THREE different launches in just four months..... respect.
6:47 jeffree honnneeeeyyyyu that hair style is taken from the Hispanic/black community... being Latina/black isn’t a fashion traittttttt
I liveeeee for Jeffery!!!! Your such a boss bitch ❤️❤️
Second video in months.... And it's a NEW launch😎🤣
Ouuu girl periodttttttt 😍
I don’t even wear makeup but I’m here watching till the end. 💚
Is he deleting comments or what
Ok I do not support jeffree and his actions and the fact he gets to escape every scandal but I’ll admit his makeup is actually beautiful and very good quality.
I think I was drooling all the way through the swatches! Can’t wait to try these!
Lol I thought he was cancelled
When is it dropping
Wow he really does only come back when he has a launch 😂
Deadass said he wasn’t coming back to sell a product 🤨
Anybody catch a time for the launch? Is it 10am pst like normal?
That weird green shade looks like a vegan's poop🤣 NO PUN INTENDED
Most amazing set ever! I absolutely love it
I'm down for a magnetic cap. My caps are always falling off in my makeup bag
Very excited for your new launch! With the direction the world is going now though, I would DIE if you started to produce your products with mother earth in mind. That is the one and only thing I could ask of you as a consumer.
I’m surprised Androgyny isn’t a shade in this formula....yet *wink wink
Girl you should do a video of your little kids please 🐶
These look beautiful.... although I liked the detailing on the other lip amo a little better. Still in love though. 💘👍🏻👍🏻😍
Oh my lord that set is insane
The bear trap is giving me “Kill This Love” by BLACKPINK M/V vibes. 🤩
I adore every single shade, so stunning!!
that does Not look like celebrity skin?!
andddd now hes not going to make another video for 2 months
Go ahead Jeffree
I'm too broke to buy any of it
Here Before A Millionnnn
This makeup is just bomb! Love your entire hot pink look... never knew I wanted those shoes and hair🙂
I’m just sad that you had to make up a fake drama just to get attention for your new launch lol
Hopefully I can get a box this year
Jeffree claims the boxes will be affordable cause of the pandemic.  100$ for the big mystery box? That's not half price at all nor is it helping people that want to get it.  I can understand if the boxes were 20, 30, 50 $
I keep wondering who buys all these youtube launch makeup. Like whos buying so much makeup?
The new packaging looks more cheap than the old
Love how ethnic this shoot is after everything that came out this year 🤣🤣🤣
I’m really excited for these
Lol just casually sat in a giant trap 😂 this is why I love you x
@jeffreestar My question is can you buy all the colours as a set? I love them all 😍
I don't wear makeup but 😍😍😍
I’ve never been into lip sticks but this just made me want to get them all so bad😍 you killed it Jeffery!
i don't like that there is no real indication of the actual colors on them. unless you look at the bottom of it or open it.  imagine having multiple of them, and looking for one. having to flip all of them over to find out which one is the one you wanted xD
The bullet lipsticks are cute as fuck
Huda beauty already made the formula and givenchy before that too  But its amazing the packaging and the colors are great
LOL he posted a video the other day to trick ppl into thinking he didn't only make videos when he launches something. Im dead
Lol I knew it 😂
These will be my birthday present to myself! 😍😍
Jeffrey, you should do a full face using your lipsticks video 😚😚
People were right when they said he'll be back when he has to sell any of his stuff ..
Am I the only one who like to watch this video..tho she can't afford buying those lipsticks 💔😹
These look gooooood
i really appreciate all the behind-the-scenes footage and explanations for how these products develop, sets, photoshoots, etc.  it’s a fun peek inside an industry that most of us would know nothing about otherwise
early 90's qvc style including mom jumpsuit... kinda living for it.
Just like this comment. I mean why not. What the hell. Let’s see how many it can get
why it look like baby lips chapstick...
is it just me or the watermelon soda shade got edit out?
Where can I get your brand I have looked everywhere and I can't find it anywhere I really want to get your products
lol one swipe.. but yet every swatch was 3 or more swipes 😅🤣😂
Hi. Jeffery, you look great I love ve your pink. Out fit. Your a cuttie. Lovr from Canada. Happy. Halloween❤️❤️🙂🙂🙂❤️🙂💐💐
Here
Omg if You have ANY Lip Ammunition’s left in the factory in the shades Ex Supermodel and Ice Cream Blvd. Please let me know-Because it is My 79 year old Mum’s GO To Lipsticks!! She is Obsessed with those 2 colors and she is going to be shattered to hear they’ve been discontinued 😭💖 Thank You in Advance and Congrats on This Amazing New Launch💫⭐️
Taking cues from Jaclyn now i see
it’s the ✨ c o p y I n g   k y l i e j e n n er ✨ with packaging for me
I’m in!!!
Everyone says he’s going to come back and first video is going to be him selling something 😂 makes a different video first and makes his second video him selling his products 😂😂 love you Jeffreeeee just thought it was funny 💓💓💓💓
THIS SET!!!!!! You are the absolute best Jeffree!!!!!!!!! SLAY QUEEN!!
I love these new lipsticks, I loved the old formula so I’m so excited for the new formula. I just hope I can get the shades I really want.
Really wish creators would do lip liners to go with their lipsticks.  Always disappointed 😞
jeffree in the last video: im not back for just selling you something new new video* GO BUY MY NEW LIPSTICKS
I'm a broke ass bitch..... the lipsticks I can buy another time, but this deluxe box.....Lord please send me some money !!!
I'm so excited 😁 the 💄 lipsticks are iconic.  Love them all the pink and red and brown and black omg. And the mystery boxes yay 🙌 😀 love it
your gonna have a makeup launch... during a PANDEMIC?!?!?! 😂🤣😅 (RICH LUX sent me here)
I'm glad lip ammo is gone, it just didn't work well for me. Excited for the new stuff!
❤️❤️❤️❤️😩🥰😍😍😍😍
WOW!!  LOVE the photo shoot!
Girlllll....all the shades are beautiful but the two green the gray and the black are calling my name😳😳
So the lip amo is retiring does that mean to TJ Maxx or marshals??? so I could head my ass over there  😩😂
Didnt he just say in his last video "Yall seem to think I only appear when im launching a new product"  Well , Jefferey, youre so right.
The trap is veryyy Gaga stupid love / sour candy
I NEED NAKED BODY SO MUCH, OH LORD.
Click here before millions of views to see the out come.    👇
My anniversary is the 15th so maybe I cancan snag a box
literally where is he
There’s still people that wears lipstick in 2020? 😺
Welp there goes my money! 🤣👋💸
Really.....?  This video is a bit much
Isn’t that strashme?
"Honey Suck Me" love it!😄
This eye makeup look is beautiful!! 🔥
It looks like a mini vibrator
I feel that they kinda look like dilatators
😍😍😍
I feel kind of selfish because I was only waiting for him to say that my favorite color was also included in this launch (Unicorn Blood)💕💕💕💕
Jeffreee!! Ik you don’t have acne but can you you do a tutorial on how to cover it up? Please!
Why the fack is he in a bear trap
Jeffree Star's quality of makeup is a 💯 if only she wasnt so problematic then she'd be a great influencer
Jeffree sure knows how to sell a product 😻
These new lipsticks look super cool. I always feel bad cause I want a box or a product but I feel their so expensive. Seriously $18 dollars for a lipstick? I think the most expensive lipstick I have was $7, then again that's a drugstore lipstick not a high end product like Jeffree's as he makes sure it's good stuff.
Literally to the 1% who's reading this may your Parents live more than 100 years with good health
Let's kill this love 😏
I don’t care what anyone says about you I still love you, you put your heart and soul into everything you make ❤️👏🏻
Love it 💕
Bwahahaha I knew he was only back to sell products
They look like candy 😍💄
Waouh amazing! France and Paris🗼 love Jeffreestar ❤❤❤
Love you Jeffrey my star ⭐️ love how they try you and you keep going no matter what!!! Your my star 💫
but...wheres Calabasas :(
КОРОЛЕВА С 1 СЕКУНДЫ
This guy is so inspiring. One day I hope to be you
Does anyone know if this lipstick will transfer? I love the liquids because his don’t go anywhere.
The magnet feature is fucking genius o.o
I want the whole set & a lipstick holder for them! I need a lipstick holder that holds all my j* in one!! Who else was hoping for sinister?
Ok but what song is this?
Can’t wait to watch the unboxing videos that come out cause I just can’t do it this month 😂😭💜
Love jeffree to death but in his last video he said that he was not coming back to sell makeup and guess what, right after he comes back he launches something... the makeup’s beautiful tho
Hi I came here to say I hate u 🥰🤬
El unico comentario en español /the only comment in Spanish.  #HONDURAS🇭🇳
Need all of them 🥰🥰🥰🥰
😍🙌😍🙌😍🙌😍🙌😍🙌😍
NO SHADE BUT WHEN HE TWISTED UP THAT LIPSTICK IT LOOKED LIKE LITERAL SHIT ON THE CAMERA W/ THAT SHADE/TEXTURE! lol DUDE IS THAT "SET" ROOM IN UR HOUSE??? I ALSO WONDER WHEN HE SITS LIKE THAT IF HE CAN EVEN STILL FEEL HIS FEET AFTER 15MIN! lol U cant see the model footage too well Whys it SO dark? also when they used it on that girl it Really looked dry and they had to hold her lip from dragging to put it on YIKES! FYI that ONE (low shot) ur ballz are hanging out! hahaha j/k but we CAN see right up ur crotch BAD ANGLE YIKES! I liked the one gurl w/ the buns posing at least SHE cracked a smile holding that fake chain! DUDE WHY u Always give us that SAME "Dead look" when u pose??? SMILE ONCE IN A BLUE MOON IT SHOWS UR TRULY "HAPPY! "HEAD IN THE BOX" shows adams apple & nails should have been pink! ALSO why does it look like that other guy (head in box) has the red lipstick All over his face??? OMG
The views went 📉📉📉📉
You only come back to youtube when you wanna sell something...lowkey giving me Jaclyn Hill vibes
Yeah not falling for it, ur still a bad person and nobody should support
LOVE3333 ALL the different colors. And the formula looks amazing!!😍😍😍💖
It’s the fact that I got excited about the fucking packaging
I'm so mad. I was thinking I would be able just to pick out one or two shades but I want like 10!
I'm so scared to get another halloween box, I never received mine from last year💔 Someone probably took it, because I got an email saying it was "lost" still so bummed out about that 💔😒
I would love to be a model. For you company
I'm into the reds!!!!
https://youtu.be/cD0r35iuhpU
I like that he had men in his campaign
so so so wooooowww))))
No hair in these lip sticks sis 💅🏻
What shades does anyone recommend for a warm toned lady?
Everyone was right, he only comes back to YouTube so he can sell/promote something new from his brand.
This is how many times Jeffrey said ,, this is so beautiful,, I I I V
Y'all cancel him bc you didn't like stuff he did in the past but you're still gonna give him money lmao. I love this man till the day I die
this video gives me 3 AM infomercial vibes..
The velvet outtit too omg i love him
not gonna lie, his lip sticks looks so good it makes me wanna cheat on urban decay. Sorry ud, still love ya. I would really love to try the  perfect red. i love red and it my favorite color.
Here before 1 mill
“AND THE FIRST ONE IS THREE. DON’T CLOCK ME!”-JS  I was about to 😂
Im buying everything!
For every dislike I will do 1 push up.
Hopefully your customer service department and the postage communications has improved since Orgy Pallete launch
Always drama before a product launch
these look amazing as bleeppp!! i miss how jeffrey had sassier vibes when he would present them, i miss the adjectives the examples ^^ cannot wait <3 been miissiing good OG queenz on youtube lately.
This packaging... might even be more userfriendly for movement-restricted people! My friend who has arthritis always says how difficult some make-up packaging is, with all the tiny flaps, this one she can just grab and pull to get the lipstick out :)
Me: damn. I want to model Jeffrey star products..but 25 years old w acne & a hideous birth mark in my eye 😖😖   The behind the scenes just HAD ME SHOOK! so amazing.
Gorgeous colors! Absolutely beautiful 😍
Jeffree...how are uou hoing to outdo yourself the next time
wait did we not cancel jeffree? and if not how are we gonna cancel shane and not him?
One thing that stuck out to me the most is that move jeffree did. He retired a line! He could have kept the old lipsticks and continued making money off both lipstick lines. Sometimes its overwhelming when a brand has so many lip products especially when lip products are too similar.
Why’d you stop showing the swatches up close? :(
290K views....wow! From ur last mystery box its so hard to choose!!! I like that pink..deluxe im getting i have to pay cdn
Absolutely beautiful!!!
Hot Commodity gives off BIGGGGG Trixie Mattel vibes
❤🧡💛💚💋💙💜🤎🖤
and we all thought the velvet couch was extra.. lmao!
Sure would love to see more videos, not just when your releasing new launches. Miss your other content
I would love to see more behind the scenes episodes of these shoots. You are so creative.
So hes not even going to acknowledge the Orgy collection drama and the dud palette??? 😐😐
YAAAASSSSSS!!!!!!!
I need to pay for college but take all my money 😍😍😍 I want everything!
why did the first thing i thought of when i saw the new packaging was it reminded me of a cross between a bullet vibrator and a baby balm lip balm 💀
Does anyone else think this looks like Hank and Henry's Lip Love Luxe Lipsticks??
Like always jeffree take my money!
I really want chocolate fondue 💗
Jeffrey, I really love you and your makeup, but that component is a mistake. It looks exactly like Kylie’s. I know pink is your thing but maybe a lavender would have been better? Still cute tho 😁
EVERYONE: swatching on the hand texture is WAY different then your lips.  I am sure that's why Mr Star had to swipe more than once.   Helloooooo.  Not to hard to figure out. Unless your lips feel like the inside of your hand.
Velvet has always been tacky to me I don't know why 😂😂😂
I want to see this light set up
14:00 that looks more comfortable
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
I have a question? How do we order on 10-16? Do we have to log on tje website at 12:00am this Thursday night???
Waiting your review on rare beauty products
I feel like I can hear there’s some hoes in this house as the background music
Purehell! ♡
Kylie Jenner vibes with her skincare line 😂😂 dead af...
OMG thank you for bringing back mystery boxes! I was so nervous you wouldn't do them this year and I really appreciate the price drop. It's very helpful as I am low on funds but still want to have a fun purchase this halloween!!!
Looking forward to seeing how Bunny gets on with all these.
shit I mean it does look good
This velvet texture is not new. I love Lisa Eldridge velvets. The best formula ever!
Baby diahrrea color at the end there (yellow-green one, ugh).  All the others are admittedly HOT
Your ideas are always so awesome 😭🤩 love lovvvve
Omg the packaging is amazing! 🧡💚💛💙💜❤
🤩 wow
Jawbreaker is my favorite
I have been hoping for years you would make Posh Spice into a bullet lipstick... the nude shades in this collection are beautiful, but....NO POSH SPICE 😢
I'm so excited!  Love this so much!🥰❤💜💙💛💚🧡
Only if I was not broke
GORGEOUS colors
I wore the red eyeshadow of the Androgyny palette for a swimming pool and it lasted the entire day, I don't know how can you top that. Jeffree has the best formulas. THE BEST.
I was literally waiting for him to open the Mystery boxes 😂😭😅
When you say you want that one to everyone time Jeffrey picks up a new one 👀
Lol thats not one coat
I want them 🤩🤩🤩🤩❤️
Omgggggg I need 😭😭😭😭❤❤❤
Kill this love Blackpink???
12:46 ...I think the description you're looking for is a weird "baby poop" green. That is literally a diaper surprise color, Jeffree lmfao and for the LIPS. Gurl, why? 😂😂
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lol. No wonder...
I love this!!!
yes KING !!!!!
Giant velvet trap house.
claiming the deluxe package i have missed jeffree star so much cant wait
😂😂😂😂😂
What’s with all these paid comments saying the same thing hmmmm
yay! So excited!! <3
Okay that’s it camera man you’re fired 😭💕  @Jeffreestar hire me I got you boo 👩🏾‍💻
I love all the colors of the lipsticks I wish I could buy ..... hi Jeffrey
Everything about this lipstick is so beautiful
I am loving those colors!
nein
Reminds me of Lisa Eldridge
LOVE THE LOOK
tl;dr OF COURSE
I’m snatching that deluxe mystery box and the Pure Evil lipstick🖤😍
Hot Commodity should be worn with that beautiful pink suit, Jeffree!! Just me? 🤷🏻‍♀️ 💖💖💖💖
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I’m gonna save some of unemployment money for this
I can't stop looking at his stunning eye makeup.
I can’t believe this has been up for 2 hours and it only has 200k views. Does that seem low to anyone else?
The models are gorgeous! 😍😍
Blackpink is gonna kill ya...
probably would make more money making medical masks with lips on them at this point
I was hoping for a foundation.
My legs hurt watching this
Oh yay new products by my favourite sexual abuser
you really do start posting on youtube when you’re about to advertise something though?? what a coincidence you said that you don’t in the previous video but you clearly do...
I cantttt. These are just too gorgeous!! 🤤🤤
I’m loving these new colors. I love all of them 🤩💖☕️
No ❤️
I’m here for the weird as fuck green.
It's kinda funny how he puts a drama video before a launching video. Jeffree knows that I'm here for the tea, but also for the makeup.
Not loving the animal trap
OMGGG love the campaign!
Stunning!
Hi I am new here and I subscribed with notifications on
Great job, jeffree but lets not get it twisted... one of the world's leading artists Lisa Eldridge was the first to come out with velvet lipstick.
So jeffry did that long “explanation “ video just because he have a comeback product lunch??
He simply outdoes himself every time... BRAVO Jeffree Lynn 💕🥰
Why are these 2 dollars more than the Ammunition?
He always leave us hanging for awhile on YouTube. Then finally makes a video explaing why,  "hes going through some thangs"...but the next day is another video to advertise his new product 🤣 I miss the old jeffree, the makeup reviews..tutorials and whatnot. But hey i guess this will do 🙃
Ugh where is my money tree? 😭😭
Love the PROP ❤️
Lmao, everyone said "he's cancelled" like 2 months ago and now "I really enjoy his work, he's so pro"  Make up your mind.
Nice ! Cover the allegations w a new ad
okay so, let's just all agree that jeffree's outfit is so damn cool
"I don't apear just to sell you products"  Jeffree:
I really want to try some of your products..... One of these days I will get to..  great video 💜💚💟💛💙
3:00 Dairy Queen workers be like
Doesn’t matter if you don’t agree with him with anything else but when it comes to his products, we can all agree that they never fail to impress
What songs are in this video??
is it just me or is the resolution super grainy like the camera is too zoomed out?
"you guys always say i dont do a new video unless im about to do another makeup release"......................immediately releases new makeup.
The applaying of watermelon soda was accedentily edited out.
I am 100% in LUST with some of the colours but that component is a total miss for me. It looks like something from Adam and Eve not JSC.
I want em all
Celebrity skin 💟 song by Hole. I love that Jeffree loves Nirvana and Hole (because I do too)
When are you gonna start reviewing things and posting what people actually want to see and not just about negative things and pop up when you’re ready to launch something. I want the weird full of life jeffree star back that ain’t care about NO BITCH & come back to us 😩💔
When someone is a toxic, narcissistic  person but makes good makeup...lol
yesss jeffree. cannot wait for the mystery boxes. the lipsticks are beautiful
then go home 😝✨
thi is another level of make up,
OMG! I’m screeeeeeeaming! This is so beautiful!!! I’m so happy for you Jeffree!  JSC is always evolving, innovating and improving their own formulas and products ❤️❤️❤️
okay he honestly DID that! So cute! Watch it get immitated everywhere lol
Omg these lipsticks look fancy af!
Hi, how are ya? I love you!
Jeffrey: “First video in two months! No I don’t only post to promote a product.”  24 hours late: “Today I am announcing a new lipstick formula!”
I love how the last he said I would never return just to promote a product
the nude on the black girl at 6:13 IS BEAUTIFUL AND SHE IS EQUALLY AS STUNNING
Firestarter is a need it's hard to find orange red lipstick. Pure hell is another want
His stuff is so good!!
Such a work of art xx
I can’t wait to purchase this product 😍
Ok miss jaclyn only uploading around releases 👀
Ooooo I loveeee these shades!
I’m usually a fan, but this seems like he straight up copied Lisa Eldridge’s product. I guess imitation is the highest form of flattery though...
Gee... I wonder where you came up with the magnetic packaging and velvet lipstick idea?
Damn. Now I need them. Here I am trying to save money. Well that went out the window. I better start selling some feet or elbow pics or something.
❤️👄❤️
Why are some people in this comment section just forgetting what happened??
So excited when I saw my must haves in the new formula!! (Unicorn Blood and Celebrity Skin). Plus all the new colors, my Christmas list will be long this year haha
What do we want?! Foundation!! When do we want it?! Now!!
Anyone else so bothered by the echo in this video??
Is it just me or does this new packing remind you of the P Louise lip sticks 🤷🏻‍♀️
Lets kill this love...
I love Jeffree but it truly feels like he has become one of those creators that only makes a video when they have something new to promote.  There were sooooo many launches this year (especially Rare Beauty) that I was looking forward to him reviewing and nothing :(
omg you always step it up, like wow, you're so creative and the way you always give us a whole experience, not only images and swatches but a whole new priject. Even the fucking details are fucking perfect, omg, im speechless💜
The bear trap is giving me ''lets kill this Love'' blackpink 😂
I hope I can finally get my 1st box this time ugh
Finally the mystery boxes are backkk
Are you ever going to post any videos besides plugging your brand? I miss make up reviews & frequent uploads.
Jeffree with tight curls is beautiful
COVID likes this!
“Well he always shows up on you tube when he wants to sell something”
COVID-19 WHO?.... I'M ONLY WORRIED ABOUT NOT GETTING MY HANDS ON SOME OF THESE LIPSTICKS!!!
If I wasn't a poor momma I WOULD SADDLE UP MOMMA! lmao. AS ALWAYS you have outdone yourself woman! Jeffree star always does.
If I didnt have to wear a face mask 24/7 I would buy the lipsticks
Dominatrix is literally the color of poop
His nails are EVERYTHING
Man he only uploads now to sell stuff
What if you laser etched the shade name for the lipsticks on the side?? Just for something new and different
Hahaha the new one looks like a pocket rocket
I Love How Jeffrey would say the wrong thing and was quick to correct himself
You really do only return to plug your products aye?
I work in a highly professional environment where you are expected to be groomed. Jeffree’s products never fail me such great formulas.
Wow...fucking gorgeous
Dude so much money on just the settting of this video lmfaoooo
Dont like any of the colors, no thanks
The velvet curtains, the bright velvet tracksuit, the neon boots, the dramatic eyeshadow the TRAP😂HE'S SO EXTRA I LOVE IT
“One swipe formula”  Proceeds to not swatch a single lip stick with one swipe  But on another note THAT RED!
Jeffree is such a makeup pioneer! These lipsticks are going to look FIRE 🔥 under my mask😷👌 Best 18.99 spent.
Hi Jeffree! You make all these colors hot n sexy!
I have no interest in make up at all. I’m just watching this because I find jeffree star so fascinating!
I want Hunty back, I dont care what formula I just want the colour back in my life
You need to create a whole lipstick line of just your dog names!!! I think that’d be a really fun unique line!
BlackPink - Kill this love? Beartrap? 😂
What’s with all the poop colors?
I’m buying them ALL!!!
Why is everyone banging on about this Lisa person and her lipsticks? MAC have had velvet lipstick lines for ages, I've got many. I'm not sure how a change of formula to make it more velvety is trademarked
What’s the song???
Please put some acoustic panels in the room to dampen the echo. Love you B****
Before the millions 😌💨
Jeff has pants on!  This must be serious :D
the colors are beautiful and yes, i am one who is afraid of the shade red for any lipstick or gloss.  i can do a nude and a bit darker and that's about it.
Cruelty free brand but sitting in a huge bear trap ??????  Weird
They all looks so stunning. I wish this year I could afford the mystery boxes tho. Because of Covid I haven't been wearing make up as much cause it breaks my face out so bad. Makes me sad but the masks are necessary.
I always try to get all 4 boxes but I have yet to...ive gotten 2 of 2 a them before but never all 3 different(for all holidays i try).  Let this be the YEARRRRR! LOK
Come on miss Jeffree 💅!
No mention of what you can get in the mystery boxes whatsoever???
I want naked body and that pink nude colony one. I also want the boxes lol
* uses mirror as coaster for redbull *
I really wish you’d do your old release videos where you tried them all on!
Kylie cosmetics has left the chat
I’m confused. In the video you posted this morning you said that you weren’t back to just sell something and then you literally do the opposite hours later. Come on.
I dont usually buy makeup just because it looks nice, but holy fuck, that looks amazing. I'm wanna buy some just to look at pretty it is 😅
Omg it's a daily vlog of him showing his house or an new product , I miss the old Jeffree
A launch on my Birthday! I feel so special. 😍
Can’t wait to get one
I dream to be this extra
You are getting 8 ....... stops to read the room 😂
The lip ammunition lip stick packaging was so cheap it reminded me of those dress up toys you get from the dollar store lol R.I.P! Good riddance lol
How the hell he sits like this for so long😳....... cute packaging and detail!
😃
Jeffrey Starr do be making some incredible products
That blue velvet I NEED IT I literally have every colour expect bright blue
What the helll. This is exactly why I clicked
You always do launches when I’m broke and I miss out for so long and when you re stock I miss out again haha 😥⚰️🤣
Previous video: "I am not here again just release a new product"   Releases new product   🤨
Nudist colony is calling my name!! Oooo baby!!
Last video: “Jeffree you only come on to sell your products” Next video: *new launch*
Has anyone ever bought a mystery box? Are they worth is? 💗💗
Omg love this. It comes out on my birthday going to treat myself
Love this set sooooo much!!
Whoever is filming these videos needs some better training.
JEFFREE!!! I. NEED. FOUNDATION. PLEASE!!!! 😂
WHO ELSE WATCHES THESE VIDEOS KNOWING FULL WELL THEY CANT AFFORD SHIT! 😭✨
Jeffree's vibe feels so off but def excited to get my hands on this
So fucking amazing! I wish I could wear lipstick  but it always looks bad on me
Love you!
I always love the photo shoot sets 😍 The campaign pictures look stunning every time
So he made a video on what he’s been doing to get everyone’s attention after being absent for months and now he’s here 2-3 days later selling something lol.
I didn’t want the lipstick until I seen the monogram imprint OMG 😱 Why does that look SO good 😊
wow.just wow.
“People have been saying I’m only back because I have something to sell..” coughs.... hmmm that didn’t age well...at allllll 😏 Editing because DAMMIT I NEEEEDDDD ALL OF THESE!!! I can’t deny that Jeffree kills the makeup game.
Nobody is gonna buy this.....we’re all wearing masks
Omg that red I’m dying
Im getting perfect red for my mom I just really want to see my mom with a BITCH red color on periodt.
why aren’t you in jail
The lipstick he holds up at 3:50 really looked like an actual Barbie prop
So excited!!!
Is there an echo in here? 😂
Hi Jeffreestar I just want to say ur channel is so kool and fun to watch thnxs
Can't wait for the mystery boxes...
Absoulutley love the  "Pure Hell" color
Yessss
Come on Blackpink
Omg girl! I love all of those lipstick colors! They are all so beautiful!! 😘😘😘
Has he ever had just gray lipsticks?
I call hands on a deluxe!!!! y'all can fight me for one!!!!!
Whoaaa
What in the “dog lipstick” component is going on...? 👀
My biggest wish is that the top of the caps were the same colour as the shade inside. It’d be annoying to pickup each one from the holder to find the colour you want. Still, stunning collection! 🙌
THAT TRAP WAS GOING TO SNAP SHUT AT ANY SECOND!!!!! I KNOW IT'S FAKE, BUT MY MIND KEPT IMAGINING THE HORROR OF IT SNAPPING SHUT, WITH BLOODY SCREAMS COMING FROM JEFFREE! "MAYBE I NEED SOME HELP, OR SHOILD JUST KEEP MY TRAP SHUT!" COOL COLLECTION JEFFREE!!!
Omg, it's so creamy😍😍
omg i thought it was a green screen... i guess not 🤭
Who's here before 300k views
6:46 is a whole different vibe -Jeffree, and I’m living for it!❤️
Getting Jacquelyn vibes of him not posting a video for a couple months and then he did and now he is selling a new product 🤣
"I know the first one was 3. Don't clock me!"
These are beautiful! I can’t wait to order 2 or 3 😂 💄 and the campaign looks AMAZING! I’m not a big fan of the packaging color..it gives me Kylie vibes 😞 but with JSC I’ll know that I’m paying for the quality 😆💕
Will it be going out to all your stockist 🙏🏼🤞🏽 NEEDED in the UK ❤️
Dam all you guys sre snacks in those photos
Jeffre is the only person who didn't know that him is cancelled
Jeffree I have been watching you for almost your whole time on YouTube and launch. I wish I could meet you. You are amazing and don't let anyone especially haters stop your thunder. Sending love from PA
🤩❤️❤️ In love 🤩❤️
yes i'm still stuck on you wearing a dark brown lipstick!! lol hope to see this soon. maybe like highlights and low lights in your hair as well! :)
Looks gorgeous
my birthday is Friday I feel BLESSED IN THE HOUSE
Jeffree in that red wig was just everything❕❗
Oooo I Wondered why he uploaded out of no where a few data ago. Not that I care but.... you know lol
Insane 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤤🤤🤤🤤
Something tells me I'll be lucky to snatch one item! 🙄
There are no words to describe the dedication creativity and passion he  brought his dreams & fantasy to life with all JSC products . Slay the game true GURU "JEFE" "BOSS"!!!  OG to the beauty industry this gift he was blessed with he created something anyone and everyone can enjoy N enhance our beauty.  and be our best selfs. If i had one wish it would be to own all jeffery star cosmetics product.
Kinda disappointed with the packaging he should have made the silver bit of the old bullets the colour  that the lipstick is in these
Girl yes 😍 I'm so excited!!!
Keep doing you boo! I’m glad you aren’t letting all the BS drama stop you’re work flow!! Everything looks sickening as usual.. I wish I could afford to get something but still out of work from this mess of a year! I’ll be able to get it eventually.. congrats 😘
Don’t get me wrong the colors are beautiful but I’m laughing because “One swipe application” but he swipes it mad times 🤣 only Mr. Starr 💕
Here before the million. Lol 😆
W O W -- b e a u t i f u l  product.
So when will we learn what in the box
Can’t wait 🥰🥰
I so love JStar❤️
Wasn't Blackpink in a similar trap first?
I’ll have to order some of the new velvet trap lippies and revive my YT channel! Or maybe a mystery box unboxing 😏 if I get a couple of new subs out of this comment, I’ll take it as a sign that I should start filming again!!!
I absolutely love Jeffree. His brand is amazing and can't wait to get Pure Hell.
I wasn’t expecting that... The quality and creativity has exceed my expectations, again ☺️
so bummed there’s no androgyny in satin
They look soo good 👌🏻👌🏻
😳 omg I can’t wait
What's the point of the makeup artists to have a mask if they aren't going to wear them correctly 🤔
Jeffree literally does have a wig for every single announcement and occasion. Never repeated. Probably has a room just for em.
He's so cute. Just sitting in that giant trap, drinking redbull and hanging out with his new lipsticks 💞👑 I can't wait for it, it's looking stunning ❣️
Jefree can you see if you can make your packaging recyclable,  or at least eco friendly  I hate throwing out tons of packaging unessesarly
Those mystery boxes are not affordable at all 3 things for $25 + shipping? Get out of here Jeffree. Then $60 and $100. I will never be able to get them or your lipsticks and eye shadow pallets. There is no savings. Prove it Shit I can get five or more products from any subscription box and pay much much less, like $25 bucks! No wonder your sales are down. Greed and for the rich only
Yeah I never get a mystery box like ever and it kills me but I’m getting one this year I’m putting sixty bucks back for it I want one so fucking bad!!!
What is this backdrop?😂😂💀💀💀💀
OKAY UR BROW BONE HIGHLIGHT 😍😍
Great things don't need much words . So " just love  these all " .
I love me some Jeffre Star ⭐️
Love that he is using his mirror as a coaster lol.
Finally someone else making velvet lipsticks, Lisa Eldriges are so expensive but so good! These look stunning miss Jeffreelyn! Love them 💕
I think this is the first time not seeing Lipstick Nick do Jeffree's makeup :( I only noticed bcuz I love her work, especially on his photoshoots.
me looking at the room in which he is: HOOLY SHIT!!
He looks so pretty and super cute with earrings 💕
I am so in love with your products, they are the best I have seen. The pigments alone are a big WOW. Love your brand even though I can't afford any. Your biggest fan #1
I havent even worn anything but chapstick since March 😕
stfu❤️
JEFFREEE PLEASE POST YOUTUBE VIDS AGAIN I AM DYING!!!
‘ They’re not Jeffery Star’ ... felt
lets kill this love yea yea yea yeaahhhh
Omggg I’m in loveeeee
Loved it Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Yeii finally a new collection ♡
Told you he only uploads a video when he's about to launch a new product. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
No disrespect to Jeffree or the lipstick as I'm sure it's a fabulous formula, but I have to thoughtfully question the idea of using animal cruelty as the theme. Traps? Really? This is a seriously flawed branding/marketing approach. Trapping/poaching is a critical issue and this campaign is tasteless and antithetical to your "cruelty free" identity. Imagine your dogs in a trap...Velvet trap could have been something sensual in the bedroom, which much more closely aligns with your identity and which could have been sexy, seductive, and feel good; instead this emphasizes pain. The horrific images that came to mind when I saw your set-up, heard you say the "bear trap" logo was on the lipstick tube, saw you put your head in a box, and talk about and sit in mouse and bear traps...well, I'd never want to pick up the lipstick tube because I'd always have an image of a tortured animal in my head.
Love them all ... Want them all 💄 💄 😍😍😍😩😩
Some of y’all fake asf, switchin up so fast 🥴
👍🏻👏🏼❤Queen Bitch gotta going on😊🤓💎
Are you only coming on YouTube when you want to sell something ???? :-(
Lol...cancel culter going by so fast like a little raincloud 😂
Lol, so you did come back to spill the tea because you had a new launch to sell. 😂
Launching on my birthday! 😁
Yes..WE ALL KNOW other companies have made lipsticks with 'VELVET' in the name or description over the years. He didn't say VELVET was unique to his brand. Get over it!
Are u all gonna act like it's normal to support him? How disappointing is that...ew
Omg 💄🥰💄I’m loving the cute fuzzy texture ! Intentionally textured not fuzzz from gloves or animal hairs or ...sorry I was having a flashback 🤣
❤️❤️❤️ love your makeup so much Jeffree can’t wait to splurge on every new product you launch!! Thank you!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Where’s androgyny 😩😩😩😩
I think you should bring back the Alien palette or design and Alien two or The Martian! Wendy Sowles on IG: wendysowlesexploresmakeup
You think the J* brand team realized that "trap" is sometimes used a transphobic slur, so they overcorrected by making things SUPER literal and putting J in a giant bear trap? Bc I think so. I think that's exactly what happened. lmao.
yay back again!!!!
Hoping to snag some mystery boxes and at least one of these new lippies to review on my channel.  ❤️ I love your formulas so it’ll be a blast to get my first mystery boxes.
OMG WHAT THIS SETTING IS INSANE
The lipsticks look beyond gorgeous! 😱😍😍 Cannot wait til Jeffree comes out with his skincare line! 😩😭😭
Omfg did I just hear black lipstick omfg the timing is too perfect
I can hear 👂 tatti crying 😂
OMG! LOVE the work you put in for this video, that trap is sick AF.
Black pink in your area
I really really want to buy a mystery box once, but honestly I am so worried. I don't know what it's going to be like if it will have something in it I already own. What are peoples thoughts on the past mystery boxes? Are they worth it?
why all the comments be nice 👀 bit sus
The lipstick packaging looks like a tampon
We love a good velvet shag room meow
Hi Im Excited!!!! 🤩🤩🤩
This bear trap is everything! Absolutely love it!
Congrats Jeffree!  But can't help thinking Blackpink's Kill This Love MV set as soon as I opened your video. Hahaha  Jeffree Star & BLACKPINK = Pretty Savage
Waooo Waooo 😳😲😉😘
Does anyone know if the lipsticks will be on beauty bay ?
Always out-doing yourself. You picked the right career choice without a doubt, killing the makeup game
I havent been here in FOREVER!!! Lots of catching up to do!
I want a deluxe box, please dont buy them to fast :(
These colors are perfect for the fall season!! I know the quality is going to be fire 😫❤️ edit: can’t get over jeffree’s look! This is my favorite look so far
Whether you like him or not you can’t deny that his makeup is bomb
I don't wear make ups but the name jefree star is on my search bar as always😀,million views in a single day is fucking insane🥰
JEFFREE yasssss now I need Black Friday to happen 😍
Inspired on Blackpink's Kill this love scenario :B
Is Jeffree pulling a jaclyn hill here and only posting when he’s releasing something new?
This is becoming a pattern...release one yt video than a week later introduce a new product..🤔
Okay I don't use makeup but like to watch the video because it's entertaining, but gurl that video quality is crisp
So jealous of all these beautiful models 😍
Can we talk about how amazing all your packaging is except your weird plastic for your powder? I had to decant my magic powder into my hourglass powder container.   I LOVE all your packaging except the powered please please please fix the lid and make it screw onto its powder base smoother. I hate the sound of plastic scratching on plastic like nails on a chalkboard.
Two words: Lisa Eldridge
"One swipe formula!"  *scribbles on his hand to get any pigment* 🤷‍♀️
First off I could careless= as in care less..about his personal life because im not in the business..I love color and I love his products and he calls cheap cheap
Trash!!
Sorry since when did jeffrey have his ears pierced
Wait, everyone just forgot what happened...dam..
Omg love the colors 💄
So killed it girl can’t wait so excited
Congratulations!
Will the mystery boxes be on beauty bay too?!
Omg Jeffree that red wig !!!!! Girlllll 🤤🤤
The set designs for your launches are always so beautiful 😍😍😍
I hated the lip ammunition lipstick that I bought. It didn't even go on... Maybe I got a dud.
beautiful
You literally said your last video wasn't so you could sell people shit. And here you are, trying to sell people shit. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I see you are inspired by Lisa Eldridge's velvet lipsticks, honestly why even try, she is legendary next time try your own concept
So they’re a lipstick, but they won’t be budge proof like the liquid lipsticks right?
Love you Jeffrey I hope you're doing okay and I hope you're doing well I'm never bought any of your Cosmetics but I would like to one day hope you're doing alright both professional and personal especially with what's been going on I follow you and Jeffree Star Cosmetics on Instagram I also saw that you have a orgy eyeshadow palette or orgy makeup collection coming out love that I also love a good neutral eyeshadow palette keep up the good work love you
jeffree you are that bitch!! yes the shoot was amazing girl! imma have to pick up this product <3
I am planning to buy the new iPhone 12... should I add more money to my budget?
I don’t like the bullet look ugh. It looks cheap
We need CALABASAS!
Literally 99% wont see this but if u do, God bless you, Stay safe and have a wonderful Day!
BOOOOO!!! Never again. Starr you tore my heart out. You love yourself way to much to look out for us little guys that make you rich. You’re welcome. But myself and many more have to sadly boycott youre products for now on.
Man god is great look what he blessed him with
the watermelon sugar shade was skipped! <3
The thing that’s so funny to me is he said he doesn’t just post videos before promoting a product... yet he just uploaded after a month 3 days ago... now look where we are..😂💀
Black pink fibes
bruh i need the honey suck me  lipstick AAHAHAHAH
No give aways 🙁
Any once else shutter when they touch velvet? I have never been able to touch it.
The models are absolutely stunning!!! With and without makeup!
Guirl bye...another lieeee!!! One swipe my asssss!!! U literally go back and forth back and forth ....otherwise ur swatches would b messy and not full coverage...its going to b the same when going on ur lips...😒😒😒
she we not gonna talk about him sitting on an large bear trap?
i don’t love or hate anyone in these scenarios but i feel like something is wrong with the comments
I don't care how much you might hate jeffree, that photoshoot was ICONIC!!
Chilling. I love it so much.
I personally like the og packaging better
The box’s have gone up in price so Sad.. 😞
Let's be honest, most of these views are just people coming to check the comments
8:47 red velvet 2nd album repackage “the perfect red velvet” tease
I would love if he did the boxes launch during various days and at different times so is poor Europeans can buy them without having to wait till 4 am and have them already sold out
The lipsticks look stunning,  but the new packaging seems like a tampon 🙄
this seems like a very desperate attempt to make money because he's losing all his followers.............
Not sure about the "one swipe" he swipe them like 5 times each on the same place, except for the first one, which you couldn't really tell if it was pigmented. I get that they are bullet lipsticks and not really as pigmented as liquid ones, but still, you could tell the first swipe was not that good
Jeffree stays launching new product right after a whole kettle of tea was spilled
ABSOLUTELY ✨𝑙𝑜𝑣𝑒✨ IT😩
Yes! Cant wait.

This is the level of extra I needed today
Omg I love that you're in a giant bear trap. 😛💖
we all knew this was coming.
Sitting on a trap! Yeah that’s about right he’s always setting himself in his own traps! Now if only Voldemort could be squashed in that trap and go away! Hes a sad case and his products are cheap
Wow jeffree really did that they look amazing. I hope I can get a mystery box this year they always sell out before I get the chance!!
So much pink :0 I LOVE ITTTTTT :P He's so iconic haha I can't wait to buy some of these!!!!      ♡Btw, read my channel's name ♡                    :D
I really missed the Pumpkin shade!! It will be amazing if you can bring it back to the velvet formula tho!! I will buy 10 hahaha
Celebrity Skin though!!! I'm dead.  ❤️💯🔥🔥
it's a good product but from far it's looked like mini vibrator 🤣
I love the red hair on him
Rip off from Lisa Eldridge's velvet lipsticks?
SOMEONE GIVE ME SOME MONEYYYYYY
Trapping us into spending more money. 🙄
IS C5 EVER GOING TO BE IN STOCK?!
The lip Ammunition is so iconic though 😢 I’m glad he stuck with the bullet theme 💕
am i the only one who got the mint mobile ad
Jeffrey, I’d love to wear your lipsticks however I’m allergic to everything in normal products. You should look into making a hypoallergenic shade or two.
The lipstick container looks like kylie skin
No wonder why he canned out with a video the other day! Thing that make you go hummmm!
I'm so excited to try the new collection!! I love you🥰
I can’t wait for Friday!!!
Ok so, you came back with a clickbate title.. and are now trying to sell again just like that...?
I can’t wait until my next paycheck to check out those mystery boxes OMG❤️
The velvet texture on the lipstick is the same as -- > https://www.lisaeldridge.com/products/velvet-ribbon-true-velvet-lipstick-colour except she doesn't have a logo embossed as well.
6:33 didn’t know bhad bhabie was apart of this campaign shoot
2:30
i know its not a normal thing but the next time you have a big launch can you do a full behind the scenes of the shoot for campaign. kinda like a mixture of what shane and you did and the montage in this video. that would be so amazing
I want pure hell 🖤🖤🖤🖤
"Say what you want about Jeffree, but his makeup is the best! uwu "  Gag me with a gun, y'all are such simps for makeup you're willing to put your morals aside. Y'all are no better than MAGAs.
No Calabasas or androgyny? 😫😫😫
You can hate him as much as you want but you can't say his products aren't bangers.
This set looks like James charles wet dream.
Wait you’re telling me this is only $18?!?!! They look so good omgggg
You are SOOOOO extra, I LOVEEE IT 💕💕💕
Ok this is sus af I haven’t seen one hate comment and I’ve been scrolling for a hot minute 🧐🤨
I really want some of these
*Jeffree releases a new product* *My pockets hurtinnnn* Love the products but not the fact that I'm now broke lmaooooo   ♡Btw, read my channel's name ♡                    :D
❤️ ❤️ ❤️ Loved all the lipsticks... Beautiful!!! And they're launching on my birthday!! Praying for birthday money to purchase a few!! ❤️ ❤️
Ur amazing love u
❤❤❤❤❤❤✌
wow the  best
people who collect his selection are still gonna buy this
That trap he was sitting on was giving me anxiety 😟😂
The one time I can afford your Halloween mystery boxes and You’re launching them while I’m gonna be in the middle of my shift?? I hate everything 😩
I badly want to buy one of the bigger mystery boxes, but babe 100$? (plus shipping and customs for me, 50$ at least) no ma'am :(
OMG the decor is soooo crazy cool ❤️
Wowww that is one bright ass velvet outfit !! I love it!!
Your sound guy needs to work on reducing that horrible echo..
i won’t be able to afford any of them 😔
Holy shit. That’s all I can say. Holy shit😍
I like the backdrop. Really cool. 👍👍👍
Not a big fan of jeffree but he puts out bomb products
"Honey, Suck Me" looks so pretty!!!
I am ready for those Halloween mysteries boxes!!! 💀👻🎃
You look so beautiful. Somebody bin watched shark nation. Love all the detail on the lipstick. You are so creative. You took the current past and made something positive and profitable for you. JS 💯you are #1 in your field.
I need those last 5 shades 🤤
You’re insane with your set ups
And right on cue, a drop after a drama lol
If another one of your videos has audio like this I’m just unfollowing and never looking back. This isn’t a fucking movie set it’s a makeup reveal
Them nails r like rubies 😍
We’re all gagging for this, freaking hot 👄  trap us, JSC🤍🖤🧡💛💚🤎❤️
Let's kill this love
Jaclyn Hill WISHES!!!
' Unicorn Blood is forever iconic!!!
It's sad the fact it's been 2 hours and you haven't even gotten 1M views😬😬
not me clicking on the video just to dislike it
Omg I'm so excited!
That eye look is amazing on you Jeffree and living for the new lipsticks will deffo be adding these to my credit card spend this month lol
I love you jeffree I’m so confident now because of you
Give me the pink xx
I love every color😍🎨❤️
Ok wait last video he said that the haters say he only comes back to reveal something I never say anything bad but after this kinda true I feel like he just posted his last video so doesn’t promote his products after no other video
I can't wait to try this one out.
Wow they're stunning.
It's stunning!How is that possible that he is so beautiful?He is my Bisexual dream.A stunning beautiful Woman with a Di@k!😏
OMG that lip stick and that shoot was stunning I wish I was one of those models they´re so beautiful
Stunning!!! 💄💄👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
OMG,  that set is absolutely everything!!! And your hair....What?!! I LOVE IT! 🤗💚🤗
Hi earrings!!!!
This will be my first red lipstick purchase. Love that red.
Jeffree's products always stand out. You tell his team works hard on the presentation and quality of the product! It's not just a brand name slapped on some product. AMAZING!!!
Oh my god now it's gonna look even more like I take my vibrator everywhere with me!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hun please stop taking all my money! Still here’s my bank card xx
Sis you're cancelled
“but BITCH, they’re bit jeffrey star” 💁🏽‍♀️🤩🤪
I may not support jeffree as a person but his products are awesome!
❤️💄 Me encanta!!!!!
💋💋❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love your hair!!!!
Love itttt 💖
Omg.  In. Trouble. On Friday.   You. Did. It. Again.
Uggh! Jeffree! Are they eyes safe? Are they kiss proof? Do they stain?
Oh I love....everything...I so need the black lipstick, and I have never gotten a mystery box yet :)
It's a trap.
This lipstick reminds me of the one from Lisa Eldridge but the low class version
LOVE the fact men are involved in the campaign, although i know nothing about makeup, it's just cool to me.
yes
Honey how’d you make and get into that?!?
I would die to get one of those mystery boxes, but germany says no 😭
Wait, you’re still here?
I want ittttt  🙏🏻🙏🏻
Jeffree is ripping off Lisa Eldridge. Look it up 🤔
That so jaded needs to be a single pot eyeshadow lol  all of ur stuff needs to be a single eye shadow shade just saying  future collections  maybe lol love u
I neeeeddd theseee mystery boxes but I’m poor so maybe next round 😉😂💕
Jawbreaker Starfish can get the limited funding meant for small businesses so he didn’t have to pay the employees who made this launch possible out of pocket. ✨🥺Oop they arent Jeffree Star so it does matter I guess.
The photos are everything omg... never disappointed with jeffrees ideas 🤩
I can’t wait for everyone in my boxycharm group to buy this mystery box just to complain for the next few months about it
Trump2020
Wow 💗 love it
Ahhhh!!!!! 👻👻👻👻 can not wait!! I’ll be going broke fridayyyy!!! 😈
Damn I want a mystery box 👻🎃
Me when I try to look at Jeffree but can’t because of his blinding clothes.  😖😑
They look amazing
Such stunning collection 😍😍love watching your makeup videos😘
This looks like Jeffrey went to the dark side.  Used to be a fan of his videos.  Sorry looks scary to me
Let’s all begin to focus on makeup brands that practice good ethics and do not conduct business and personal matters with ill intentions. There is so many talented makeup brands and products in this over saturated market. Let’s not keep commenting about how we shouldn’t care who he is... I think we actually should care and move on from this brand.
I expect this shit from j. Hill, I know I’ll get lies by Trump.  Jeffrey must be trying to one up the two of them.  See it you haven’t figured it out yet little miss Star thinks we are stupid! That she can lie to us and we will still go running to buy her products.  Well fans that have no scruples, have at it.  I’m out, as are thousands of others.SMH
And I will miss out on everything like I do every single.time
lisa eldridge made a set of velvet "velvet lipsticks", which are fantastic both pigment and texture
I need that red omg
Jeffree. I am an essential worker. I work a ton. Not old however my Fifties n I Just Luv U. Help a Sister out ' What foundation n highlighter, under eye  etc.   in a normal price range Please....  What would a gal use.  Be You.Do You. Believe In You. Peace. GodBless
This is iconic...who thinks of these things lmao queeeeennnn 👑
u my bestfriend in my head 😭
Girl.... I’m borderline offended that you didn’t make an ‘Androgyny’ shade for this launch... ?????
Passing on all of it...can't see lipstick behind a mask. I'm sure I'll end up with them down the road. I've never really been into the Mystery Boxes...I have so much stuff in my kit I'm out of room in my studio storage again so I'm not buying anything unless I know I want it and will definitely be using it.
Where is the tea Jeffree?!??? -_-
POV: you came here for the comments
Friday but at what time ??
LOL didn't you just say in a video a few days ago that you don't just come back to YouTube to promote products? And then you drop this video?? Doesn't really bode well does it?
I wont be able to buy anything cause its gonna be sold out ;_;
The lipsticks are fucking masterpieces,love the colors,the packaging.Everything,happy for Jeffree and my lips
Hi how R ya......this is my new lipstick 💄 I just dropped another scandal 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
❤️❤️
The set is so iconic! ❤️💄❤️💄
When ur here before a million views
This is so cool!
IM IN LOVE WITH THEM AHHH
As nice as these are! Mama Jeffree please can we have some new velour liquid lip shades! It’s been a hot minute since some new shades and ya gal needs a new purple 💖
Jeffrey : one swipe formula that’s all you need to do!  Makeup artists at the photo shoot: does multiple swipes
OMG😍😍😍
That room looks hella scary
Damn Bitch!! They are 😍 beautiful!!💋
this looks like cheap Lisa Eldridge lol
Once again...only comes back to sell something
now just imagine it closes and bam nomore Jeffree
Maybe since everyone is hating on him all us real fans may be able to actually buy  his products!
When I saw this velvet trap I thought of BLACKPINK Kill This Love!! I LOVE IT 💜❤️💗💛!!
Celebrity Skin velvet lip is calling my name better start saving now cause i gotta get me a mystery box and that new lipstick
Holy shit! 😁
@Jeffreestar damn girl!! Stunningly beautiful,  unique and just you in a lipstick!! Loves the props, clothing you slayed it.
Who's gonna get a mystery box?? 👀🎃
OMG!! Iam ready I whant them all, and you all can’t hate on him he comes out with the best of the best!!
It’s the showing the swatches from 40 ft away for me
3:41 this....is...just..beautifulllllll omg just take my life alreadyyy. No but srsly that took my motha fucking breath away
I mean his brand just keeps getting better and better.
yes jeffrey!!
Damn, I wish I could support him but after all he did I'm no longer buying anything from him anymore.
This is actually a good product, with a great packaging
trash
I’ve never tried any lipsticks like this. But I’m loving these. Love you and love your line. 💜🙏🏻🍷
I literally can’t wait!
Just imagine the amount of wigs hes worn in like the past year... wow.
Will it be out sold in Finland? I just love them so much 🥰🥰🥰🥰🤪. (Going crazy)
yes ma’am! I was just rewatching the Shane and jeffree star series again!!💕🍬
Are you ever going to rerelease things you've taken away?
Does anybody know the retail price for the new lipstick?
I want the deluxe mystery box
12:40 Unphased was cool as fuck. Never seen that color before but I'd wear it.
Baby!!!!!! I swear Jeffree can sell cow meat to a fish but honestly... these lipsticks are absolutely gorgeous. I want all of them ❤️🧡💛💚💙🖤💜💖
That doesn't look like Jawbreaker...it's lighter.
I'd rather buy JSC lipstick than high end brand lipstick out there
Lip ammunition was dry as fuck. I never bought another one again. Velour liquid lipstick? Also disgusting. Didn’t say on and peeled off and goopy. I wanted to love his products because the colors he offers are amazing but he’s always tooting his formulas but they were garbage. I’m not quite sure why people bought those lipsticks over and over except for the color offerings.
Definitely marking calendar for that PREMIUM MYSTERY BOX!!
Man I was waiting for the grey and of course wasn’t it the last shade. I will use this when I wear Cremated palette which is my favorite palette. There are at least 7 of these I want. Go Jeffery!!!!Judy D.
I am getting tired but is it just me ?
I actually thought he was using chroma key until I saw the set...no wonder the sound is horrible...he's in a warehouse.
The trap set up is copied from BlackPink's Kill This Love for sure. No good
Blackpink kill this love trap
Wow this setup is sick! I am dead from your fabulousness.
Omg this decor though WHAT
Ugh! I love lip ammo...I was the only non-liquid lipsticks I would wear 😫
Trap is a word u use in anime
GIMMMMMMME THAT PERFECT RED LORD I AM NOT READY
Jeffree take my damning money already! Bullet lipsticks are my favourite kind of lip product and they all look so beautiful!
So so so excited! Hope I get a mystery box this time!
Had me at “honey, suck me” 🤪😁
What I wanna know is how Jeffree managed to sit in that position for the duration of this video?! 😅
Omg I wish !:( I have had so much tragic things happening I wish I could get the boxes :(
YESSS WORK HONEY
I love the last five especially that dark army green 🤤
Knew that last video was just a lead up to a new launch 🙃
I love the models in the velvet box! It’s so gorgeous 🥺
Nobody cares, sis. We can see you’re spending all you’re money... might wanna save some... you might need it in 2 years, sis.
Did he really put himself inside a giant bear trap?😂
It feels like someone— wants to sell me something...
these are pretty much like the hank & henry sext lipsticks lmao
OK but, how does he sit in that position for so long? I've got pins and needles just watching
I was wondering why there hadn't been any new lip ammo since last summer. I'm glad I got the last full Lip Ammo collection that went with Jawbreaker.
I feel awkward is this room 👁👄👁
you could make a lot of scrunchies with that fabric
Yes bitch!! Im here for the set...the campaign and all the new launch...2 snaps!! Warm wishes& palm tree kisses🌴💋from Orlando jeffree🌈
Is this how you sell your products..... start a controversy ✅ makeup a product ✅ then sell it ✅ I swear I can't with this person 🤣 I was truly a supportive follower for everything else but now I'm truly over it I don't deal with this type of person in my everyday life not following a person that would use people like this just to sell a product for a ridiculous price.
Hehe I got my hot chips and water  I’m ready to look at all these comments
OMG I want them ALL!!!   ♥ Queen
Girl you did that’s love it can’t wait
Jeffree that echo thooo lol
TAKE MY FUCKING MONEY NOW!!! I’ve been waiting this all damn year!
BUYING ALL 3 boxes 🥰
They are all Aaaaaaamazing 🤩
Honestly, it’s about time- those old lipsticks were the weakest formula in his collection! I have been waiting for ages for GOOD lippies from JSC!
I wish  I could get your products from india
Nice collection, but yet again!
Yasss this Friday is gonna be hell. Don't know when I will be able to get those gorgeous lipsticks but I need them all!! 😍😍 You always kill it when it comes to your makeup!! I love it. Definitely will be trying to get my mystery boxes this Friday, praying for everyone who tries to get them!!!
This is launching on my birthday & I'm getting this ahhh
I am most definitely buying all the lipsticks these are absolutely beautiful 😍
Hello 1940ish red lips
Okay, personally I don't like Jeffery but you can't deny that he is the king of cosmetics
*Jeffree comes out with make up* me: 9:47
im not a fan of js but this lowkey looks good ngl
I honestly have not been wearing any lipstick because it just smudges under my mask. 😥 💄
Can’t even wear lipstick cause you have to wear a mask here
Can't wait till October 16. Love the new line 💖
The sound is driving me nuts! Way too much echo/hall effect😱
shooketh
The whole aesthetic appeal of this video looks so tacky! Jeffree has definitely downgraded !!
is she turning into miss jaclyn hill?
I swear I have a vibrator that looks just like that lipstick
Jeffree and team is so much talented 😍
Good afternoon friend. How cool your lipsticks are everything. Love you .✌🏾❤️⭐️😎🦋🌈🌹💐🙏🏽
Whole aesthetic is very similar with Chromatica, especially Stupid Love💕
Jeffree really did that!! Love those new lippies!! xx
Living for that track suit 😍💕
Did he delete the I'm never dating again?
Uhg. I hate being broke I want some of your products so bad. Just can’t afford it.  Stupid covid. I wish things was normal again. Shit is hard.       💖💖Good luck with your new launch Jeffree. I know it will do amazing. 💖💖💖
Gg
Will there be merch in the $60 & $100 mystery boxes? I need a jstar halloween tee. Mine was refunded last year because they over sold 😭
Jeffreeeeeeeeeeyaaaaeee❤❤💙💙
Yup I want all the “weird” ones ♥️♥️ that black is stunning
I love the retro look of the lipstick cases!!!!!!  Questions: 1.  When are the originals being removed? 2.  Which lipsticks are good for neutral/warm tone skin?
Omg,those colors,my eyes are blessed😍😍😍  The perfect red and pitch black, you're mine😍  Jeffree,you definitely spark people's love for lipsticks❤️🖤
before you start hating, just remember he has EMPLOYEES to pay that have families. let him run his business.
Why does it look green screen when it's not?... or is it?
okay it looks beautiful
People don't want you to make content, but then turn around and say you haven't made enough content to justify showcasing your products. Damn y'all vote with your wallets and block the channels you don't wanna see ✌️
Parece el final de dududu de black pink
RIP Lip Ammunition...I will miss you, baby.
UGHHHH I get WET for anything velvet. I'm gagging for the launch
Jeffree, that’s one hell of a security system for your new vault!
6.10 model with that colour honestly 😍😍
Take a shot every time Jeffree says "of course"
Idc what anyone says. He might have done terrible things in the past but his products are high quality
But what time is the launch
You only post when you want $$
It looks like my bullet vibrator. It’s just missing the remote.
Didn’t you just say you didn’t want us to think you only post when you drop a new product.........?
i need those pastels like jawbreaker on deep skin tones NOW
Jeffree stop!! I can’t !  Imma go rob a bank for the lipsticks !!
This hot pink velvet rack suit is everything!!
You can guess he's in his garage 😂
Thank you Lisa Eldridge for the inspiration. I guess what it's called nowadays 'Inspiration'.
He’s just not the same anymore. Kinda hate it.
Ugh fucking beautiful
Oh Thats Why u uploaded That last video so That u could announce this without «comming back to YouTube just to promote»
His formula is amazing! Im so excited for the Halloween boxes!
I want these so bad but I can’t afford it 😭😭 they look like they apply like butter
Unsubscribing to you Jeffree. Really disappointed in you. I really looked up to you. You are a Manipulative liar, I can’t even look at you without thinking about all the disgusting things you have done. I don’t know how somebody can be interacted with such a problematic person.        Sorry, not sorry.
Guys there’s really no need for the hate I’ve been a fan of Jeffrey for years now and I can tell their a good person and his products are super good Quality even my older cousin who isn’t such a huge fan of Jeffrey still loves his make up!
The phtotshoot looks like album covers
When I heard the word retirement ngl I panicked. Jeffree don’t ever retire :c your mind is too brilliant. The world AND the world of makeup literally needs you! Thank you for always bringing something novel to your collection.
That chair is sick! I want it
6:45 idk why but he is giving me LipstickNick vibes
I'll be there for true red and medievals kiss.. like hot damn!
Look when they like twist it out they move it back in a bit because they don’t wanna show how short it is lol
Fucking love your mystery boxes!!!
In the deluxe box will there be any clothing?
That set up remind me of Black Pink MV “Kill this love” mouse trap.   Sick.
Wait he isn’t trending lmao awwww someone cancelation is hitting hard
summarizing what practically changes is the packaging.  I think that the owners of makeup brands have to have a very fertile imagination to impress customers because there is already so much makeup on the market, so many brands that to impress you have to really create something very innovative.  Appearing with another pink lipstick on the bottom is just another pink lipstick.  Just it.
if only I had the opportunity to get a mystery box but the shipping is extreme!
Jeffree did go hard or go home with this video when it comes to his brand, wow
This setup is NOT it I’m sorry🤭🤣🤣 it’s way to distracting I can’t even focus I’m on the products (not that I’m gonna buy anyways💀)
Good idea choosing payday as the launch date haha
No Lipsticknick?
Please do a giveaway, these are beautiful!
I didn’t want to click because I should stop spending and start saving but yet here I am looking forward to buy some of his new products . 😭
Ohhh I see why u posted that weird video the other day....gotta hawk!
What ever you gotta say about Jeffree I have ALWAYS and ALWAYS WILL SUPPORT JEFFREE👏
He literally stole the trap from BlackPink's kill this love m/v
That Deluxe box is calling my naaaammmee!!! Bitch
Yes ma’am 🙌🏻🙌🏻 I’m getting all 3 boxes, this is how I started my love for JSC ❤️
Im excited for these mystery boxes and lipsticks
Isn't Trap a slur???? Not here for this...
It looks kinda... Cheap. Like carton looks cheap like there was no more paper material. Actual component is like ok but lools also quite cheap like it was washed out of prints and etc. Lip Ammo was more on fool child side and was along with the brand style. Now Jeffree is going in thia weird luxury direction but it seems like different brand not JSC developed on 2014. I miss this now
I’m so excited for everything! 💖
Oh no...not the CEO of a company promoting said company and taking good care of their employees and releasing products that people are excited about. 😂 The Internet is a really funny place sometimes. 😂
I wonder if the red lipstick is the same as redrum, because I love the color of redrum and I need a new one but it's always out of stock..
What a nice infomercial
It’s not my place to forgive you  but i hope you’ve learnt from your mistakes and that you have bettered yourself. There’s honestly not much more that you can do. I Wish the best to you and your brand💖
The packaging is great. No longer will I suffer with lipstick all over the bottom of my bag honestly.
Curious to know what Lipstick Nick is up to?
Seeing opened used makeup painted on all models with the same products makes me cringe...esp with this fungalitis crap going on in our year of 2020
Unicorn Blood is MINE 🙌🏽😱🔥🦄
Velvet Trap Queen 👑 💄 💋
Selling something thats y she posted the otherbday u wont get a cent from me
Say what you want about Jeffree, but he makes some of the best cosmetics on the market.
Hey jeffree star how are you doing today
Aaaaaaand look who came back right in time for a launch. What a surprise 😲
...
the velvet trap is so cool..............
🎉🍾
Is he going to get fucking loaded in money from this? It's up to you, Gays from the U.S.
Jeffree with that red wig was everything 🔥
ITS THE PINK FOR ME 💕💕💕
I want these lipsticks but I’m like broke 🤣  Rn I’m hoping my 90 subscribers turns to 1000 so I can afford one of these after 20 years 😅
Gimme 5 green, 10 dominatrix, 15 chocolate, omgeee I'm going crazyyy!!!😍😍😍😍😍
Watching this on my Samsung 4K tv and Damn Bitch! I don’t even wear lipstick but I might now lol the colors are magnificent A+ Jeffree :)
She's pigmented
Your real fans are still here and we love you and your brand 💯💕💕💕
These remind me of the new Hank and Henry lipsticks. They’re cute.
Jeffree bitch, I love you! Never tried any of your make-up bc i can't buy it anywhere in my country   😭 but I still love you
Yassssss 😈😍
people here be like "think what u want but his make up is still top tier."  you guys really wanna give this person your money? honey
Why is everything always released the week before payday 💰? Everyone knows it’s payday the last Friday of the month ☹️☹️☹️
I'm in love with Pure Hell. Can't wait until it drops.
Honestly though why is he putting out SO MUCH makeup right now???? I feel like he has a lot of cool new products but his platform is on a downfall atm he should wait for when its back up
Oh no
They look amazing but watching this damn near gave me motion sickness. Jumping in and out and up and down. Girl. Tone down the cinematics. You don’t need it.
Two posts in 2 days we are living😅🤣🤣
I NEED THE GREY !!!
Did anyone notice Jeffree skipped showing Watermelon Soda?
This looks like Lisa Eldridge's lipsticks. She did the velvet texture lipstick first.
Sorry don't like this video style
There are 3 lipsticks I need right now!!!
I love u and I hate u
You can’t lie, this isn’t a brand made by some people it’s Jeffree I N V O L V E D and he puts work into making sure it’s made by him and Q U A L I T Y
Halloween mystery boxes so close to Halloween? Anyone think they'll get to you in time? Or is that a stretch?
But bitch, they’re not jeffree star😆👏🏼💕
last video: this video isn’t to try and sell any new makeup 3 days later: new makeup launches
I want all the lipsticks 😅
I dont even use makeup but all these lipsticks are so nice. Jeffree u are a QUEEN! 🥳
This shade gives me stoner vibes *pulls out some weed*
https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCcTIJ5RKvn_pjo056Bp9PCA
How can one not like ‘business bitch’ Jeffree? The quality of his products is always great and he’s not afraid to deliver a wide range of colors for ALL his customers. Will definitely buy some of these.
👍👍😍😍
One swipe my ass😂
I don't wear makeup but I do love watching Jeffree's videos <3
Just love love love shut the front 🚪!! 🙌🏻♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️😍💋🤗
Rare beauty is WAITING for your review so am I 🤩🤩 live for the colors jeffree never fails 🔎🥵
:( how can we get a mistery box in mexico? :'( the retail stores you currently have don't sell it
Jeffree using his mirror as a table is everything XD
Who did audio on this? Yike
your filming production is so theatrical.  So much fun to watch.
Am I the only one who prefers the old lipsticks... 👀
Garbage.
He only makes videos for products now 🙃
Rip sound quality lmao
@JefferyStar I love you a lot but I’m still disappointed about that you did. Just please come clean and take responsibility for your actions so people stop hating you
For some reason I feel the majority of these comments were bought and paid for.
Congratulation for ur brand Jeffree love you ❤😃💃
Edited exactly the same as the shane docuseries.  Js is definitely paying shane a wage for these videos 🤔🤔🤔
Love you Jeffree 💗
Omg! I love them all! I can't wait I'm so excited! 😁😍
Blackpink trap huh
I can’t wait for it all ❤️🐝
So he made a video before product release 😏🤷🏻‍♂️
Are you gonna have the glitter ones?
its beautiful .. i can only wish to have it.. huhuhu
Ughhh these look BOMB! Can't wait to get my hands on some of these!!!  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So the drama ended?
Oh I can’t wait to get my hands on all of these Velvet Trap lipsticks! I love the packaging and I can’t wait to get all 3 mystery boxes as well! JSC Mystery Boxes are the best! 💕
Oh nooooooo my bank accooouuuuunt
Jeffree Youtube has an ads now? Wtf am I missing something? Now Im mad!!
GUESS WHO WILL BE USING AFTERPAY LOL ME
Even if you don’t support nor like Jeffree, you can’t deny the fact his makeup is amazing and one of the best products and formulas out there.
spooky boxes can’t wait!!! 😫😫
Starts swatching at @ 7:40. You’re welcome...
I KNOW WHAT I AM GETTING FOR MY BIRTHDAY THIS FRIDAY !!! I CANT WAIT TO PURCHASE THE DELUXE MYSTERY BOX ❤❤  I LOVE JEFFREE COSMETICS 💄 🔥🔥🔥🤩🤩🤩😍😍🙃
Celeb skin is my abso favorite. I've went through 3 tubes. I'm so excited for this formula of it. But that newest colony is what I'm actually really excited for!
🏃🏼‍♀️💨💨💨 Yessssssss..... Can't wait....
Jeffree looks so good with that dark purple lipstick in the photo shoot
OMG that blaaaaaaaaack!!!!!
A whole video things ill never be able to afford 😥😥😥😥😥
The fact that you put "holidays" in quotation makes me wonderrrrrrrr
one last question, will afterpay be available for the mystery boxes??
He put that last video up just so he didn’t come back with a new collection after not posting for months like usual.
All of us using facemasks but looking fabulous under hahaha
I'm still waiting for some jeffree star foundation 😔
I can't wait for this launch!! I LOVE LOVE that Red!!!  And I want a mystery box!  I always miss it 😢
Those mystery boxes are tiny. My Halloween box from last year had 13 items and was twice as big
I’m sorry but i cant even afford to pay all my bills sooo I’m just watching you guys enjoy this brand, never tried it even tho I’ve followed Jeffree for years, it seems like a sooo good brand and I really want to buy this but we’ll see when i can try this for my self😍❣️
I swear u can just tell how passionate jeffree is about every little thing he creates u can tell how much love effort pain sweat etc he puts in all his products from the packaging to the formula to the design everything this is why I love and support him tbh I wish I could buy some of his products so I can test them out but u can just tell even on screen how amazing they are I just I love this queen so much
Deluxe box me please 🥴
I’m kind living for Jeffree with that hair style ngl.
Literally a velvet trap Jeffree’s so extra lol
i think i just got aids.
Jeffrey star is just the most FABULOUS person on the PLANET!
Here before they start deleting the negative comments about what a horrible shitty person Jefrey Stor is.... 🙄😒
Okay but his leg will be HURTING after he gets up
Finally some good fucking contint
Is he still correcting the orgy pallette?
no ❤️
i feel like lipsticks aren’t the best thing to sell right now because of our masks
Jeffree I love you 😘
Oh how I wish I could afford any of the mystery boxes
😫 I LOVED the lip amo !
Where will the Halloween boxes be available at?
I swear JS has the best products on the market
Yes Bi#ches👄🔥
ANIMAL TRAPS ARE CRUEL NOT A COOL PROP!!
Is the echo killing anyone else's ears?
Why does he always sit like that? 🤭
Wow I'm quite early
that lace 🥱🤢
7:45 The reveal 💄
So sad exactly what everyone said when you released the video 3 days ago it's all just to sell something you don't care about your fans your subscribers.  You show me only that you don't care about us the viewers. Just my opinion and it sucks to feel this way when I cared for you jeffree.
Jeffree...       are your knees ok???
Yall switch up so fast. Only week ago he got himself into drama just to get himself some attention for his new release. He is so toxic and i totally disagree with this comment section, like how can you support a two faced person who back stabs people all the time but never gets the blame because he has done worse.
Please GOD 🙏 I really hope all your haters are broke the next 2 months 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
THAT  TRAP IS  KILLING IT ‼️🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗🔗
shut up and take my money Honey!!!
yes! the model with acne! love seeing real people!
"I don't go on my channel just 2 release new products"  * 2 days l8er *
Jeffree Star ‘new’ lipsticks are STUNNING!!! 🤩
There goes my money😅
🎃🎃🎃🎃
💗🤍💗🤍
Drink every time he says " of course ".
I have way too many nude lipsticks but a few more won’t hurt 😆
Wig snatched
Love you❤😘🤟
Ticket right here. Jeffree love watching on your videos.you are amazing person.
I've been looking for the perfect black lipstick and PURE HELL is so perfect and would have been SO PERFECT FOR MY WEDDING DAY but i get married the 17th. god damnit!!!
I don't care what he has or hasn't done, I don't even wear or buy makeup i just like his personality.
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THIS DAMN BEAR TRAP?? 😳😳
I wish I could afford some JSC I haven't had real makeup in years!! I'm a 46yr old housewife from a farming community in  Tennessee
What is the song in the video?
Omg I cannot wait!!! I’m at least grabbing 10 of those colors!!!
Ugh so damn torn. I'm a woman of color and a makeup addict. Why you gotta be so messy  😭😭😭😭i want them 😩 all. But I'm so torn. The stress
Really excited for these lipsticks !!!  Love the colors!
My knees would not work at all after sitting like that for even a minute
I need and I want and I deserve all your makeup ❤️ please GOD 🙏🙏
😍😍😍😍😍
I would love to get one of them but my parents would never be able afford one.
That’s my friends Xmas presents sorted 👄👄

Shook 💯✅🍽
We need face mask girrrrl!

Okay but can we stop caring about drama and just support the tons of work (and people working hard) for his brand? Like this make up is just on another level and deserves support
That shoot is beautiful
I love this filming style from you! 🙌 the lipsticks look amazing and the advert pictures are stunning!!
Yawn. Next.
I know he is a crazy man,  but he is super hardworking with makeup
It looks like a little bullet vibrator😂😂
bruh i thought he was canceled
What time is the launch is it 9am cst or 3 pm cst ? Will  after pay be on or disabled?
I'm really disappointed by this. Should've known when you reappeared on YT it meant a laungh was coming 🙁
JEFFREESTAR good work bro this year is yours u are the best

I want to come back to America y’all 😅😅😅so I can buy 😢😢😢
Can’t wait to get my hands on this lipstick

That set is so over the top, a giant bear trap who would have guessed. 😂 I'm excited for the new lip formula! I love liquid lipstick but I like the bullet lipstick too. Looks so nice!
I love jeffree with big hair!!! So excited for the perfect red shade! And the deluxe mystery box! My poor bank account! 😂
yall complaining that ppl are mad jeffree is advertising his products.... where’s that energy for jacyln hill?
They are so stunning! 😍👏✨  I really wanted to see Jazminas lip-swatch of Naked Body.. so sad that this gorgeous color got left out.
Velvet is back baby 👶 Hello again my 90s childhood
your hair is EVERRRRYYTHING !
OMG the bullet with the logo is AMAZING 😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
1am Western Australia time 🥺😓 I know I’m gonna miss out on the Halloween collection again lol
Lol really wow
Omw that yaaaay sound clip is a imovies free sound bite....
One day I’ll be on your PR list. I live.
why didn’t u drop products with this quickness when people cared for u? Jk we all know it’s just to line your pockets🤷🏻‍♂️
Jeffrey doesn’t need my money.  But am I going to give him hundreds of my tiny peasant dollars? You’re damn right I am.  😍😭💄🙌🏻
Love jefree anyway ❤️
I love this new look 👀 it looks so high end and fancy 😍😍😍
Ok he stole black pinks studio lol
Jeffree Star or Meridith from Brave?
He looks so pretty.
Dear Jeffree, dude, I support you and your healing journey.   You were in a dream of mine awhile ago. You were really excited about something and there was another male with us in this regular smegular hotel room. It’s was odd, but not wrong.  It’s so weird seeing everything go on with you dude. I’ve been a fan of you since MySpace, and it’s hard to believe what’s going on. I don’t want anything to do with it, because it feels so weird. You have good products, minus the nude pallet you released. The formula can use some work on that one.  I just want peace for people, and for people to do the right things no matter what those consequences are. Doing the right thing is always the best option, imo. Jeffree, you are a star, please don’t let how far you have come be tarnished by the past. I don’t know what this means to you, if you even care, but can you just do the right thing. Whatever the right thing feels like to you. I want to support you so bad, because it’s hard to believe that all that ish is really true. I support you and your healing journey my fellow human.
thanks jefree
I can’t wait to see my girl Alizee laugh about how Jeff is taking the “brilliant movie super villain” meme to the maaaaax.
Real Talk...these are fucking sick! The print ON the actual lipstick!? That shit is dope as fuck
Address the allegations
He honestly just makes me in such a good mood watching his videos
Kinda knew he was gonna release a new bullet lipstick formula when he discontinued his lip ammo. Even more shades on launch and this packaging looks gorgeous
The Boxes AND the Lipsticks on the same day? I mean, I'm in, but gosh...let's hope your servers are stable... ^^"
That hot comodity shade is blindiiiiiinggg
Jeffre could I work for u online🙏🏻
Beautiful colors 🙂❤️❤️👍💯🤗
What's up with his chin, y'all?  Is it just me, or does it list to the (his) right? 🤔
You’ve come so far ❤️ I’ve loved watching you for years and you never stop grinding or let people get to you. Queen shit forsure ✨
I think Miranda Sings need that red lipstick🙄💋
i hope that trap closes on him
I love ALL of your products can’t wait for Friday!!!!
Can’t wait to see you use these on a tutorial! Because the colors are so unusual, stunning, but unusual!❤️😊
You know your early when a video of his doesn't have a million views yet
If you're here to be negative please leave, thank you ;)
During the BHS of the promotion, who else had to do a double take after thinking that the dude was Nathan? Bitch, I nearly choked on my Pepsi.
Does anyone remember what the mystery boxes were last year? For a second I thought he was saying they would be cheaper this time but it doesn't seem to be the case
Thought it was a green screen at first wow! Killed it for sure!
up close it looks like Italian ice and I want to bite it or something
Why is he still here?
Jeffree denying he comes back to film when he’s selling a product in his last video, but here we are. Jaclyn Hill number 2.🤦🏻 My god, I’m over you. I tried to watch for nostalgic purposes, but yeah.....lm over him, and his bragging ways.
Congrats.  Glad to see you back.
I 💕 JS
You're all here because you want to be so either your a fan or a sad soul who feeds on drama and negativity. If its number 2 I don't even need to say anything because you are already miserable and will destroy your own life by such means. Lol
Okay, personal matters aside, this formula really does look *sickening.* I haven’t bought a JSC product in years and I’m ready to buy one of these right away. 💄👄
The apology video sitting position is back and better 😂
I LOVE the way it looks!
I'm getting my first mystery box this year. Can't wait. You look stunning JS. Kisses
Naked body 😍😍😍
2:40 يشبهون التحميله🌚
I NEED shade Naked body on my lips right now!! Yess Jeffree💕
Oh i see! Distract everyone from your r*pe and payoff allegations by releasing this😂😂😂
I need huntington beach ! I know its a liquid lip shade. But girl !!!!! I love it
Jeffree literally looks so perfect that I forget he doesn’t have eyebrows.
Everyone:green background Jefreestar: i want it icónic bitch Also jefreestar: go big or go home
This filming set up is SO cute! 😍✨
OMG JEFFREE!! I love big hair on you! This formula looks beautiful!
He is genius
Your nails are stunning ❤🙌😍
Everything looks so beautiful.. I wish I could afford a mystery box lol oh well
Rip my bank account
I’m not a lipstick wearer but these are making me change my mind!
Tbh, jeffree is gorgeous
I love Jefree so much❤❤ Whenever I feel depressed, I watch one of his videos and I am a huge makeup addict. My mom is minutes away from disowning me because I buy makeup a lot😂😂 Sad part is we don't get jefree cosmetics in India. Please start selling it in India❤❤❤❤ Love you lots and blessing❤
Jeffree you make amazing products  And I CAN'T wait to get my hands on the new lips.
Finally a day after I get paidddd
Anyone know his chart? I’d be shocked if Capricorn wasn’t in there somewhere.
No
Omg can’t wait to get sommmmmeee💗💗💗💗
I love, Love, Love it! That campaign shoot was pure 🔥🔥🔥🔥The new packaging/component is stunning!     Congrats on another amazing launch! Can't wait to try them all💖
Omg can’t wait to get sommmmmeee💗💗💗💗
Only green lipstick/lipgloss/lipliner/liquid lip I'll ever where is Jeffrees cause bitch jeffree knows how to do crazy colors like no one else. Rainbow who
Wish I could have a mister y box sadly they don’t ship to Mexico 😪
Nobody gets me excited like you Jeffrey!!! I need that Malibu color!! They look so amazing and I’ve been so worried about the boxes.  🦇🎃👻🍁🕷🧛‍♀️🥀
Okay I know it goes on sale Friday what time is it supposed to start on sale friday?
Is it going to be on Beautylish too?
I just think it's renevated to lip ammo formula
Beautiful colors!! That red! I've never found one that looks decent on me due to my weird tones, but I may need to try that tube of deliciousness
I really like that blue and violet.  Omg that red lipstick the formula looks perfect.  Next lipstick buying definitely
But isn’t he kinda, I won’t say copying but, taking the idea from Lisa Eldridge because she has got velvet lipsticks that actually look like velvet aswell. Just saying that’s all. 😊
Love it
Jeffree in his last vid: "I'm not going to come back just to sell you something" Jeffree the very next video: trying to sell lipsticks
You are creazy I Must buy it for my sister 😍😘🥰🌈
Love love ❤️ 😻 can’t wait !!
Period!!!
I swear I NEVER get paid during the mystery boxes 😕.  Ugh maybe someday I'll actually get to get one.
Wait, wait!! These lipsticks are HEAVILY inspired by Lisa Eldridge Velvet lipsticks... hmmm
Those nails are frickin sick!!
Jeffree is smart to revamp jos lipstick line, I feel like people are getting over the liquid lipstick phase and getting back to basics, the shades are really cool, fun and mostly very wearable. Love how those look👍
The studio tho!🤯🤯🤯
😃❤🙌 miss you girl
So Awesome ! ! LOVE ! 💋🐾🐾
Literally this Youtube channel has almost entirely become advetising for his makeup company. And no hate but I'm out. I subscribed for enjoyable YouTube content that he enjoyed making as much as I enjoyed watching. Now he only makes a video when he feels like he HAS to address some issue before coming out with a new product. Look at his last 4 videos: APOLOGY, NEW PALETTE, SCANDAL EXPLANATION, NEW LIPSTICKS
Don’t even wear lipstick but def buying at least one or two 🥵🥵🥵
I am living for it...take my money!!!!
Chocolate fondue, fire starter & unphased  ❤️❤️❤️
Love 💕 you! Keep your head up ! Love all your products! Can’t wait for the mystery boxes 📦!!!!!
Launching on my birthday ❤❤❤
What was everyone's favorite shade? I really like Medieval Kiss!
BYE I NEED THE MYSTERY BOX
Jeffree isn’t the nicest person or a likeable person for that matter but the guy is a makeup genius 😎
It’s sad that I can’t afford these lipsticks right now! I really really love them! Very unique 🖤🖤
Ughhhh if I would of known I would of waited to get the mystery box for my birthday (my bdays Halloween) but I got all 4 of the extreme frost highlighters
His eyes are as dead as my soul lol still ❤️
Ya so I need Firestarter...guess I'm breaking my no more makeup rule. Plus the Halloween box is a must.
Please make christmas cookie in this formula!🤞❤💋
Oct 16. My birthday. Sponsors, anyone? Lol
but, i'm trying to save money!  lol.
Did he say what time they new lipsticks/mystery boxes would be released or did I miss it?
Why the camera angle is different?

Lol I'm in th 30 and our thing yassssssss
So he's only going to post videos the day before every launch now?
SO EXCITED!
I’m literally on school hiding in the bathroom watching your videos lol
Y'all going off about the wrong thing in these comments. These lipsticks are fuckn 🔥😭😭🤚🏼 i hate being broke,  but my kids gotta eat. I might just get one tho 👀lol
Yes yes yessss
two days ago:  Jeffrey: I dont want to only come on here to promote a launch Today: Announces launch  Us: Ok Jaclyn Hill 2.0
Yess! These look dope. Definitely gonna be purchasing 😍
so its true he does only post when launching a new line buy jeffrree im out
Wonder if the site will crash when I try to order 😒
Jeffree needs to stop enabling my shopping addiction😭 I can’t help it with mystery boxes!!
Lisa Eldridge came out with velvet looking lipsticks a few years ago.....just saying...
You are so dumb if you still support him 😅
damnn these views are garbage
No
🔥 I love the everything!! 👻 🔥
So stunnung! I want all the collections!
I can see Trixie Mattel wearing some or all of those lipsticks.
Where tf is the rare beauty review I need from you!?!?
Am I the only one watching this saying to yourself how about dropping some FULL COVERAGE FOUNDATION!!! Lol i been wanting and waiting for a JSC Foundation 🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼💜
Wow Jeffree not surprised that after everyone else there's you bringing it all together I love ya ❤❤
I love you jeffree!
Okay dammit I need them all!!!!!!!!!!!!
HE WAS LITERALLY SITTING IN A VELVET TRAP ☠❤
Love the lipstick colours good job Jeffrey 💕👍
Innnnnn luvvvvv❤️❤️
looks sickening 😍😍😍😍😍 his so good at what he does NO ONE can deny that PERIOD 😎❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Love you Jeffree can't wait to buy it!!!!
Love Jeff hate Jeff,  HE IS THE BEST BEAUTY GURU. HE LOVES AND UNDERSTANDS ALL THE MAKE UP PROCESS. respect!
I need a Christmas Cookie in this formula...
The day of my birthday 🎂 😌  turning 24 omg will buy the new lipsticks 💄 😍....
Didn't Lisa Eldridge do this a couple of years ago...?
We need Christmas Cookie in this new formula!
Here before million view 😍❤️
Why does this even have negative ratings?? 🤣🤣🤣 Clearly not been watching the same thing haha 😆 Can't wait till Friday 😆 🙌
You may hate him  but his products are TOP!!!!
Why does Jeffrey never do his own makeup
*It’s the echo for me*
that lipstick looks so good omg 😳
Can't wait to get my hands on a box. What time does it launch? Noon? I must have missed it. But I did not like the old formula so glad he made something better.
Forgot a picture of naked body on the lips
Ugh.  Those lipstick colors are so ugly.  Wouldn’t wear the first one.  Much better colors out there which are more attractive and wearable.😖🤭👎🏻
I LOVE all shades! but I NEED “black hell” 😍
I’ve never seen a company care so much about every detail, from the formula to the advertising. OBSESSED
Your still here?
Sounds Good Jeffree, See You on Friday 💄💳💸🙌
Definitely excited for these!!! can't wait to try them!!
The trap looks so good!
I always wondered what do they do with the make up that they use on the models.
The thirstiest trap ive ever seen @JeffreeStar if ive ever have seen one. He needed to name it that because its literally his life slipping from under him lol trap it . But as ive always said "la ced mata"!!!!!!!
I mean... my problem is the lack of social distancing and mask wearing. All masks except like 1 were on their chins....
Yaaas ❤️
Take my paycheck Jeffree! 😍
Your nails!! 😍😍😍
Take all my government money
How are people just ignoring the stuff that he has done in the last year. I used to like him but after what he did to James... no
I'm probably one of few that just can't wear a red that bright but it's hella cute.
Its funny cause it seems he is just uploading to push his new launchs . 😹🤦🏻‍♀️ Jaclyn Hill 2.0 .
Hoping to snag a mystery box this time around!!
I don't own anything from Jeffree Star bc I can't afford it but some of them I would love to have!
Fabulous Star 🌟 you did it again.  Congratulations, just Fabulous 👄👄👄👄👄👄
IM SO EXCITED FOR OCTOBER 16TH BECAUSE OF THE LANCH AND MY SISTERS BDAY IS THE SAME DAY!!!!!!
I can’t imagine his version of Lisa Eldridge’s lipstick comes anywhere near
Idk why people hate on someone who actually puts effort in his company and tries to make it the best overall for his customers you can’t ever make people happy so do you boo!
Something’s not feeling great with camera and focus and everything!! Refer to earlier product reveals!! Even the last video was such !! Please look into it
What’s the music on background?
This man definitely out here paying people to defend him in the comments with the same exact words every other comment
I need these!!! So beautiful! Every time I think his products can't be any better, he amazes me!
Soooooo very excited to try this formula.  I have used your lip liners but not any of your other lip products yet!  Everyone look so spectacular for the photo shoot, but Jeffree you looked SENSATIONAL & BREATHTAKING with the red hair and silver dress!🤩🔥😍. Hope all is well with you, your babies and family!💋
Anyone in these comments know who made those boots he's wearing? Those are the mf T
Loved seeing so much behind the scenes footage!! She is a business OWNER biiiisshh
Love this! Can’t wait to try them!
NOT WITH THAT GIANT TRAP IM LIVINGGGGG
i don t like jeffree (raciest past...and more) but i cant deny those lipsticks look cool as hell
Are you going to bring back the old shades from the old lipstick
Omg omg omg im so excited.!!! Hope i can get my hands on that deluxe box 😬
Those nailS DOE !!!!!!!!! 😵.
Jeffree: Lipstick has one swipe coverage! Also Jeffree: Swipes each lipstick 4-5 times
Am I the only one getting Lisa Eldridge vibes? Her lipsticks have the same Velvet formula
lol my favourite Jeffree quote from this video “if you’re scared of wearing colour, can’t relate” 😂😂😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This is why 🤷🏼‍♀️ your the Queen 👸🏼 and King 🤴🏼 of this make up shit... whoever doesn't agree then can't relate 💄
the unfazed shade 😬 gurl, that looks like a babies diarrhoea😭
literally stop making videos you're so toxic and harmful
How did I know that he would come out with a new product lol
“Only need one swipe” continues to go back and forth like 4 times on every single swatch lol
Congrats on your new line!!😍😍😍
Imagine telling my coworkers when they ask... my lip color is Honey Suck Me 🤣
Damm i wish i could afford all of it and i probably wont be able to even by one because i know it will all sell out but great job jeffree glad to see you back baby!
Damn He creates all these wonderful products and i cant even buy them cause  “ItS nOt nAtURal for a bOy to wear makeUp”  Thats on conservative parents
I wish I could send him a picture of my lips so he could tell me what nude shade would fit me best lmao. I struggle finding the perfect nude and love all of his but don’t know what would look best in person 😭
:0000 it’s coming out on my birthdayyyndkldnfkwldb
I was hoping the finish of the lipstick was also a velvet matte look
Can you please bring the color Nate back? Didn’t need to take it away! And zero tutorials what going on?
I want a mystery box so badly, always have!!!
That Hot Ass Pink Velvet Outfit that Jeffree is wearing is Everything! Besides coming out with the hottest designs for his products and the hottest background set ups..you got to admit his products are on point girl! This Bitch does not disappoint!! PERIOD   👏🏼👩🏼💗💄
💕💕💕
This is the weirdest shit with him being so far away 🤣😭😭
I'm so excited for the mystery boxes! It's the first year I can actually afford one, so hopefully I can snag one!
I'm sorry the new lipstick reminds me of a vibrator lol
You can say whatever you want about Jeffree, but his makeup is amazing and his set ups are unreal!
Is it kiss proof like liquid lipstick?
YESSS
Cannot wait!!
Omg these velvet traps look snatched!!!! I Can’t wait!
Omg wish list: naked body, diet mannequin, celebrity skin, nudist colony and pure hell. 😍😍😍 so excited for these.  They look stunning.  Your backdrops, themes and the way you are styled is amazing. You seriously have a knack for coming out with products that are original and the best formula and on trend. Cant wait to get my hands on this launch. Congrats @JeffreeStar lots of love❤️
looking like bp’s kill this love or whatever
Im gonna go very very broke. God dammit
I love your BlackPink inspiration with the bear trap!!💖💖💖
Give me Give me!
This is bad timing , knowing everybody has to wear mask 😑
Love it Jeffree!! You're the best !!
Jeffree- thank you for giving us the same quality that you want for yourself. So many with makeup lines don’t do that. They just make cheap fast crap and mark up the price. I’d much much rather buy you’re stuff at maybe a slightly higher price but knowing I’m getting my money worth and I trust that you don’t release crappy stuff.
I wanted Tasty!
YAAAASSSSSSSSSSS!!!!
Honestly all the positive comments are a lil too sus and similar to take seriously.
💕 OMG I’m so in love with these lipsticks 💕 hopefully you will be coming out with Delicious in the velvet trap 💕 I love seeing you advertise your products instead of some generic commercial. 💕 You go all out and I’m living for it 💕 Can’t wait til Friday 💕💕💕
So excited! My favorite is medieval kiss, really praying Jeffree creates a different shade similar like burgundy wine red; I can’t find one that isn’t sheer and crap. ❣️❣️❣️
Blackpink „Kill this Love“ MV - Second Refrain Scene - MOOD
Important question! Does this mean the Ammo and their original lipsticks shades will be discontinued?!
I can't afford his makeup. I will never know how amazing it is. I'm sure that it is as good as everyone claims!
It would be a shame if that bear trap would just accidentally close on itself :))
Is he excluding coments?
Anyone else think "Hot Commodity" kinda looks like "Stacy's Mom" from Trixie Cosmetics?
Being rich enough to sit in a trap looking flawless
This is the Jeffree Star I enjoy watching as he is at his best when he is in business man mode.
Never shut your trap baby doll this is why we love ❤️ you!
Wow!! Those pictures are EVERYTHING.
God damn , I wish I got my unemployment already 😞 I need these boxes!!! Maybe next year 🥰
I don’t like how far the camera is
I can see the boxes containing all the lip ammunition that never sold along with a bunch of Shane Dawson Conspiracy stuff lol. I'm just saying! Lol
He just looks stunning with those piercings!! Goals AF😍😍
😂 a lipstick launch when most of us have our mouths covered with masks... I’ll pass . At this point would be a waste of money. Besides KVD has the same red named Outlaw.
Sickening!
Those lipsticks are INCREDIBLE!!! I can't! Jeffree I adore the amount of detail you put into everything but you've somehow managed to out do yourself and I didn't think it was possible!! I'm a Product Designer at Uni and I always marvel at how much time, effort, planning and thought goes into design of everything! Photoshoots, packaging, products, imprints in the actual makeup, it just all feels so loved and cared for. I find it so inspiring! Also love your eyeshadow! Purple is my fave colour! <3
omagawd i thought he was in a green screen this is everything lmao
Just take my money already 😜 JS never disappoints when it come to quality and care. Love it! 💋❤️
My dream come true would be to watch Jeffrey stomp a Runway. He really is an exceptional model. I really believe that is what he does best.
Can’t wait to try these new products! Love you Jeffree 💖💖💖
I live for the creativity of these shoots and everyone looks so freakin gorgeous🥵🥵
Can you review Selena Gomez rare beauty makeup or Rihanna fenty beauty skin careline please ?
The package of lipstick still looks like a sex toy lol
hun how many people did you pay to write the same comments again and again
Cant wait to buy it!!!
I love how its always like an infomercial on crack
I'm not a huge fan of liquid lipsticks so I'm actually pretty excited for these.
Waaaauw...... Just wauwwww 😍
I LOVE IT!!! 😻
Hi Jeffree! I'm in love with your makeup Brand! I don't really like this type of formula but the new shades are absolutely STUNNING!😍😍😍 I'm in love and would love you to make them as Velvet Matte Liquid lipsticks! It could be Amazing💖💖💖
Mmmm mrs.blues pose.... I hope people don’t take it the wrong way
Can’t deny the quality of his products. He’s good at designing/perfecting his formulas. I can’t fault him for that. ✌🏼💄
making a video adressing drama : sells a product
I swear if I had the money to spend right now I would be getting a mystery box and some of those new lipsticks, dang it Jeffree you always launch when I have other priorities lol
Produce more more more & more plastics!
I’m so excited to try these! Love a good lipstick. And I know these will be great. I can believe this set haha youre too much.
You should sell the remaining lip ammunitions that are left! I will buy so many!! I didn’t get the chance to get all the ones I wanted!!! Ugh I love you and your products! I love that you always stick to being you! It’s the constant transparency for me😍😍😍
Obsessed!!! Nice job Jeffree!! 😍😍
OHMYGOD. This is a new level of lipstick. How do you always overcome yourself again and again?
Did he just pull a Jaclyn Hill on us?
ur iconic
Stop complaining over advertisements. What if everybody came for your brand???
The shade you have on is like my absolute DREAM nude pink that I’ve been searching for my whole life. I neeeed it 💗 I also really want the black 🖤🖤🖤
Your coming out with this on my bday ugh love you boo 😭 I’m about to get some stuff 😘
I feel bad for thinking this but this reminds me of a buttplug like the case of the lipsticks
the comments:...  everyone: hEs a bRanD oWneR lEaVe HiM aLoNe
They are so beautiful Jeffree but due to unforeseen circumstances I won’t be able to afford to buy these for a while. But letting you know how gorgeous they are! You did good!! Edit: yes I know he will probably never see this. But I believe in putting positive energy out there so you get positive energy back. 🤗
The pictures are everything
i need a holder in my life where i can put my lip liners right next to their lipsticks
I need pure hell that shade is so beautiful
I am so happy that Jefree is back!!! I’ve miss your videos!
Nathan is missing out.
Come'onnn Stupid Love promo
Excited for this! But omg I cannot wait for a foundation!!
Bear trap? 🥴
Someone else said it too, but the concept reminds me of Lisa Eldridge's velvet lipstick 🤔
Can't deny he has become jaclyn hill💀 as a fan not really happy with u lately
I don't like the Drama but I like the products, sadly There's no say I can get it in Mexico. TT.TT
All jokes and drama aside, this guy NAILED make up products and set new standards come on now
Anyone else like i see you not sending credit to black pink! If you get it, you get it!
I just want a full size hidden hills liquid lip. I’m almost out from my vault collection. It’s the best shade 😫💔  guess ill have to mend my heart with a mystery box lol
Nobody say anything negative about the red hair or edges I mean it
Wow Jeffree, girl everything is beautiful!  One day, just one day... having an infant in these times ain't easy to treat yourself but damn, the day I can...I would FINALLY love to buy for the first time afteralltheseyearsofmewatchingu!😚
This rooooom, how. Love it.
Too bad masks and lipstick don’t really work 😅
Damn I wanna buy the whole collection 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Omg Jeffree October 16th is my bday!! It would mean THE WORLD to me if you sent me something from this new collection! I started collecting all your palettes back in January and I just bought the lip vault and both nude palettes. I love your makeup so much!
Stupid love, Lady Gaga <3
That bear trap is SICKN’ING !! 💖💖
I can never pull off lipstick. I’ve only ever tried using liquid lip but it wasn’t JS brand. Does anyone know if standard lipsticks are more flattering than liquid lips? I really want to get into wearing them
Okay bb you coming for my bank account😍😍 LOVE IT❤️❤️❤️
There is a couple shades of Velvet Trap im intrigued by and um YES mystery boxes! I really hope it goes SOMEWHAT smooth this time around
OMG Jeffrey i am soooo excited about this launch😳💜 Cant wait to purchase some of the lippies and please just keep on keeping on😍💜
Whew, girl!
JEFFREE YOURE KILLING ME! 😂😍 wow gorgeous collection
He really couldn't do anything about that echo huh 🥴
Kind of took the velvet texture thing from Lisa Eldridge, huh? I think the lids of her lipsticks were magnetised too.
Can we stop mixing business with personal? Thx.
These look stuning for real🌹
Hey guys I have never bought one of Jeffree’s mystery boxes. Are they all new products or are they products he already has out?
I’m living for the pure hell lipstick 💄😍
Everyone: wearing facemasks Jeffree Star: releasing lipsticks
It's a shame they don't ship to Spain :( I'm upset
2:49 my friends trying to set me up with a guy they know
Love it
Here we go.....why does he always yell out the last word of a sentence? Ugh
I am shook!!
Omg I am loving those new lip colors 😍
I see why your rich. You are awesome
The velvet texture is actually knocking off Lisa Eldrige lipstick line that has been out for a while...........................................
Can you get the mystery boxes off beauty bay for the UK people? 🇬🇧
I cannot wait to sell my soul for these lipsticks
I hate Jeffree Star as a person but I can’t say anything bad about his makeup. And honestly it makes me wanna kms because as much as I hate him, I HAVE to have his products in my collection. 🙃
first few seconds jeffree star describes himself..
Man Jeffree is a damn mess.....
Those nails tho 😍😍😍😍
Jeffre star,nunca defrauda,bonita gama de pintalabios!!!!
I want every single shade!! Omg I would give anything to be on his pr list 😭❤️
I’m broke! 😭
Make up on point today!!!!!!!
omg, I am so excited, love you Jeffree!!
This is how many times Jeffree says beautiful.   👇
Having the lipsticks in front of his knees while he’s sitting down makes it look like hands sticking out and someone trying to escape like he’s sitting on them lmao
@jeffree star will there be afterpay
this is so self unaware LOL
the lanuch is on my birthday 😍😍😍😍
I couldn't imagine not liking someone but commenting on their every move 😂😂😂
Amazing !
Are we going to get more restock then we get of the other lip products. I never can get my hands on any of the colors I want.
Yay im excited!!
They look so different to a regular lipstick umm no they don't lol there near enough the same as every other lipstick and I guarantee u can get all the same shades from literally every other brand out there and for a third of the price probably, theres only so many colours in a rainbow, same with eyeshadow palettes ppl buy em because youtubers hype them up so much n uv probably got all the same shade's already in ur collection, it makes me laugh ppl still buy them  n ur laughing making millions.
QWEEENNNNN! SICKENING! ❤
He doesn’t Post for weeks and weeks and then finally makes a post the other day saying he’s not here to promote new products LOL go figure
Last video he said I'm not back on youtube to "sell"
love the fact that he advertises it as one swipe but every swatch he does is more than one swipe 😋
14:55 ASMR tingles!
So we just gonna blow bythe fact that this lipstick package looks like a vibrator?
5:52 Ashley Petta vibes...
They gave us sensory deprivation!
im screaming, it looks like a vibrator
Really wish Jeffree could expand in the middle east 🥺❤
I love you Jeffry🖤🖤🖤
Colors are stunning! I want a few but hardly wear lipsticks now because it gets all over my washable mask.
You already know dean asmr is watching and waiting for the mystery box to come out!!
This must be the most awkward pose and way to sit doing a product reveal ever. 🦵👀💅
I mean I know he has done bad things but hes only doing his job and what hes passionate about... advertising is apart of what he does and what he needs to do to sell his product just like every brand owner out there..
I luv how he had to look away to know the shade name😂😂
WE NEEED WIFEY!!!!
Do someone know the music playing in background?
i dont own any jsc yet but im super excited! i love the redesign, so sleek and modern im dyyying
Nobody: Not a single soul: Jeffrey: ✨I’M IN A VELVET TRAP ✨
I hope you don't give any sneak peaks of what's inside. I would love to get an actual mystery box from JSC! 💜
Wow this is such an impressive collection. I cannot wait to try. 😘💕🥰
OMG....U R SO OVER THE TOP & I LOVE IT❣😍🤩
Me wearing a mask everyday for the last 7 months..new lipsticks? I think I need them 😆
Very #DavidLachapelle 🌱🇫🇷🥖🥐
Boo to the Trump commercials throughout this vid.
Love the pierced ears !!  ❤️
Love it. Those lipsticks are stunning.
Oof I need all of these 👀👀
Y mientras tanto Nathan......
no❤️
"I've changed the packaging to these brand new vibrators!"
Im a filipino fan of jeffree star🖤❤️
THE CHOCOLATE/CARAMEL NUDES THOOOOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥 i’m so excited for this!
Looks like a vibrator love it
Wish it would snap.
I need the Halloween boxessss all of them !!!! Can Jeffree just be my best friend already !!!!!!!
Well not copied by black pink......im just saying kill this love
So unprofessional to swatch your product in the palm of you hand. Mbye 👋
Can you do more videos please not just launch and addressing bs? I miss Hi 🙋🏻‍♀️ how are ya? Welcome back to my channel ✨ videos.
Jeffree in his last video: I’m not back to launch anything This video:
Oh look another video coming out when there’s a new product
I’m so fricken HAPPY af that the Mystery boxes are happening 🖤🖤🖤🖤 I can’t wait either to get me some new lippies 😭🤩😍
Announcing this the same day as the iPhone 12.... I see patterns
My friends: Please don't be so extra Me:
I just take the box’s/ just box there neat
Soo cute!!
When will poinsettia be restocked? It's always sold out 🙃
You freaking killed it
So amazing love love love him and the lipsticks look so yummy and creamy on the screen can't imagine how it'll be on lips. Daaaamn jefree you did it again... Fucking legend
YOU ARE AMAZING 😍
So it launches on my birthday and i cant afford it 🙃🙃.
love u!!
The nails though I'm crying😭😭❤❤
So glad to see that Jeffree showed everyone that he didn't really make a video just before a product release. LOL with that said what an amazing set. I I forgive him everything because she's just so fabulous.
Those lipsticks make me think of Lisa Eldridge velvet lipsticks
Shades and the set are gorgeous but ngl those lipsticks look like vibrators
Look I know nothing about make up but DAMMM that lipstick looked so good
Say what you want but Jeffree delivers top quality products. Very high standards and a lot of work is put into these products.
This is so sick!!
"Medieval Kiss" is STUNNING, I can't wait for the boxes and that shade in particular! <3 It's my birthday this month so I gotta treat myself... :D lol
Oh we got velvet cheese
Oh hello miss Jaclyn Hill
Whats the song thats playing?
Love this!!
The lipsticks are so pretty whattt
Hot damn! I have been waiting for the mystery boxes all quarantine. Literally the highlight of my year, lol.
Lol the packaging looks like some Kylie cosmetics shit
Yk that U lost Control about Ur Life when U spend 100 bucks For 8 products No one wanted to buy so theyre in a mysterybox
Everything is so beautiful everything from JSC IS SO DAM AMAZING!
Excited for the new lip... look at the colors!and mystery boxes. Love Jeffee.💗
Now lets wait till people start saying that jefree stole thier desing😶
Ok but are we gonna forget the assault allegations orr
UGH. This collection is BEAUTIFUL. Leave it to Jeffree to create such stunning shades, to outdo himself with the set, and to even make an effort to make his mystery boxes more affordable for those who've been hit hard by Covid-19. THAT'S how you show your loyalty to your customers, your fans, your followers and your brand.  I know a lot of accusations have been thrown around, but I am of the belief that if I wasn't there.....I don't know the truth, and therefore can't make accurate judgements, so I go based off of what I see, and what I see is someone who is doing whatever they can to be successful AND compassionate at the same time. Brava Jeffree, BRAVA.
i wish someday i can buy one of your makeup pallet 😭🥺
This is launching on my birthday!!!!
Am I the only one seeing leg hair😭💔love jeffree though💜
I can’t wait to get the new lippies!!
Love you❤
It’s one of those thinsgs that are just so pretty and detailed I don’t think I would be able to use it because so wouldn’t want to ruin it lol
💓💗 the set, the makeup, the outfit... YES 💗💓
Cant wait
Everything that you swatched can be shipped to my home, I'm more than happy to have the used ones and use them for my channel. Thank you! 🙃🙏🏽❤️
l- nvm😅
I love unicorn blood and celebrity. Lipsticks I will miss them !!!!
EIGHT! 📣👀
Song?
Am I the only one who thinks not making Blue Velvet in the initial launch batch of Velvet Trap was a missed opportunity?
even if he did only come back to youtube to promote the new launch how does that affect you in any way shape or form. youtube is not his job his job is to run a company and create bomb ass makeup. people be getting so butt hurt about everything these days
It’s the new jaclyn hill only post a video to sell something 🤮🤮🤮
will beauty bay have the halloween boxes for UK people? I cant imagine the custom prices if i order from america ;(
What happened to that watermelon soda at 10:21 ??? Show it please! :'(
Absolutely beautiful! Waiting for the Jeffree Star Skin Care line!
I had a black pink flashback moment with this giant trap
I would love them but suck the mask will cover it :( . Now with covid-19 is hard to wear lipsticks
Wow so many beautiful lipsticks.... can't wait♥️💙♥️
Omigoddddd I need it!
wheres the brown pinkish shades
Can we get a restock on those lip scrubs sweetheart im dying for that peach one!! 🍑
CANT WAIT 💋💋💋💄💄💄💄💄
Say what you will but the man knows how to make makeup.
Why do you have to drop new products when I have no money😂😂😂
Ngl tho they do kinda look like vibrators 😂
Lowkey giving me Kylie Cosmetics vibes with the specific pink and font 🤷🏽‍♂️ sue me.. the lipstick shades are nice and really pigmented
im so sorry but im going to follow my friends and stop supporting you sorry but i have to
I wouldn't consider him a youtuber. I mean he is a brand owner so this is a way to advertise. People will literally complain over everything. What I still don't understand is if you don't like him why are you even here? I couldn't imagine being so miserable that i hate someone but watch their every move and criticize them.
I need “Honey, Suck Me” and “Pure Hell” and “Unicorn Blood”
Jeffree makes me want to buy a bunch of makeup even though I have no idea how to do makeup
The trap should have been made of velvet.
Jeffree with the red hair 😍😍😍😍😍
Omg it’s every Karen on earth
Yesterday: people just stay I only come back to YT when I release a new product but that's not true Today: releases new product  I mean I'm gonna get it but still 🤣
Jeffree: Releases new product My bank: *is now empty*
Honestly I'm not even a makeup fanatic, I'm just watching, but from a business perspective he just seems like a really amazing brand owner. I'm not talking personality and anything like that, but he knows a damn good product and how to make one, and he knows how to sell it and make his brand unique, standing out from others. He's a very good brand owner, his marketing, packaging, products, it all seems really amazing for a brand, and all at a reasonable price given the quality. Honestly, say what you want about his personality, but I think in terms of business and branding, he's absolutely amazing.
Love the aesthetic of this line and photo shoot! 🤞🏻I get a deluxe mystery box this time.
i’m sorry what exactly is “trap” referencing ....
What's up QWEEN??♥️
❤️💙
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🎁
Those shades are dope I might pick up a few
He is a mood 😍🤣🥺🖤
Is it cruelty free?
They look like shot gun bullets and im living for them! More like dying because DAMN they look good
The decor is a bit tacky Jeffrey
HERE BEFORE 1 MILLION VIEWS 😌✨
This video edit is giving me Shane vibes ❤️❤️
Omg I need them ALL ✨
I'm going to have to have at least one of these lipsticks 😍😍😍!
8:05 😂😂😂 Jeffree We love you💓💓
Pls tell me that there's unbrainwashed people here??
For someone who always calls out other brands for copying concepts, this looks awfully similar to Lisa Eldridge velvet lipsticks!!!
@jeffreestar when will you drop some lashes and eyeliner like this if you agreee
...say what you want about Jeffree, but I don't think ANY brand in the cosmetics industry puts the time and attention into details that he does. You can see the care that he took into putting all these unique and special aspects into the packaging and component, and when he speaks about them he speaks with pride. I give major props for that. His products present luxuriously and perform beautifully and are not at an astronomical price point. I'll definitely be purchasing Velvet Trap, it looks gorgeous.
Iconic jeffree using his star mirror as a coaster for his Red Bull
I knew it... after every drama .... comes a launch.
You really stepped up 😍 loved the collection
as much as everyone may not like jeffree right now - LETS APPLAUD HIS SUCCESS AND BRAND FOR A MOMENT😖😭
Whilst I love these I don’t get why he keeps saying stuff about one swipe but when swatching he does multiple swipes?
Yep as predicted, he comes out with a product after the drama.. I won’t be surprised if these type of comments are getting deleted..
Can I PLEASE have the swatched lipsticks 😩 I know I can’t afford all the ones I’m obsessed with already 😍😍😍
Oooh velvet trap!! I love the color ❤️
Loving this collection 😍   Looking forward to purchasing them all.
I'm ready for it all.
Jeffree! Will you ever restock your Pumpkin Pie liquid lip? :(
THIS IS SO ICONIC🔥
Blood lust pallet for the makeup of the day 💜💜💜  I appreciate the stars details on the lipsticks.
Look cheap.
Orange based reds are the only reds i can pull off. Im 100% getting that one bc theyre so hard to find
What the fuck is that set i love it.
Woooooooow😍😍😍😍 take all my money 😂❤️
i loooove the set like whaaaa how pretty and extra af
No one cares anymore ♥️
Lmao nice chin diapers on the makeup artist there smh
I love that Jeffree always pushes himself! He never settles and is always trying to grow his business in every way still staying true to Jeffree with the quality ! A TRUE CEO
Quierooooo😍😍😍😍
I hope I’m able to snag a mystery box... they sell out so fast!
I wish I had the same energy for my viewers 😩😩    Love your videos hope to see you in South Africa 🇿🇦 one day ❤️❤️

Thank you for always making us smile Jeffrey! ❤   Stay healthy boo 😘
HERE BEFORE 100K VIEWS
I watch them and imagine that one day I can afford and order at least ten of these... They are so beautiful and a lot of JS items have been on my wish list for months, and I'm still trying to find a job. Life in Serbia is a real struggle. Ordering one lipstick like this is almost a luxury. Very sad. I adore JS cosmetics philosophy, uniqueness and design and I can't wait to own at least something! ❤️
I need this lipstick I don’t even wear lipstick but I need it.😆😆😆😆😆
Mmmm..... velvet lipsticks,wonder where you got that idea from,perhaps House of Eldridge??But yours look tacky and cheap.
i wish i could afford it
I’m confused. Is Jeffree Uncancelled ? Nobody in the comments got anything bad to say...luv jeffree tho!
okay you can say anything you want about jeffree as a person but you cant deny that his products are literally bomb
Lisa Eldridge launched Velvet Lipstick a year ago. There are no words.
I'm sure the formula is fantastic, but the packaging looks cheap as fuck.  The tube looks like that child's play makeup that most little girls have at some point.  How exactly is this "luxurious"?
Looks like a bullet vibrator lol
Living on the edge (the trap, lol)!!Yes!! And keeping it real! Congrats on all of your success!
i spent my weekly unemployment check on concealer and cannot wait to purchase these in the future! you make the best products ever!
I love you Jeffrey but in your last video you did say that people was going to say you was going to come back but you decided to sell something and your next video after you made that comment you're trying to sell something it looks like they was right but I still love you though
lady gaga is about to sue your ass
didn't lisa eldridge do the velvet lipstick texture before ???
omg Medieval Kiss is gorgeous 😍💜💖 New lipsticks look amazing!! I absolutely love the packaging 💯💄  And the campaign photos! You and your team did an amazing job! 👏 Excited to get my fav nude Celebrity Skin in this formula 🍁🍂 also, definitely getting Medieval Kiss and Malibu Beach House 🥰💕💜💜💜
Im a whore for the box alone! Omg! You just went from Jeffrey Star cosmetic to Jeffrey Fucking Star cosmetics. You always out do yourself with every choice you make and Im still so proud of you.... I love this all! VELVET TRAP IS JEFFREE IN  LIPSTICK FORM! 🤍🤍🤍🤍
Love how he said he wasn't coming back to sale his makeup but in is second video back he's back to making infomercials 😂😭
These are so satisfying to look at! I want the shade naked body it is so 90s!
I feel like I’ve seen this type of lipstick I don’t remember the name but it was on TikTok for a while. Anyone remember it?
THIS SETUP IS EVERYTHING AGH-
The only problem is everyone is wearing a mask 😷 so you can’t really wear lipstick 💄 right now 🤷‍♀️
idk about y’all but i’m not really wearing lipsticks right now bc i’m always wearing a mask so this seems like odd timing to me lol
"Wow! I really want a mystery box and a lip!" *checks bank account* ...well nevermind. $5.61 and I don't get paid until the 23rd lmaoo
I need those damn mysterie boxes 📦 !!!!!
Omg 🤩
I don’t get why people are hating this guy he is a Business person and his product are good and is for everyone .people let us empower each other rather then put each other down.can wait to try this one.
Will they be available at beautybay the same day?
Jeffree when are going to do another giveaway
Did he just say ‘weally’ instead of really?
Who's here right after watching Frenemies 5
Living for the trap
I  Love Your Pink Velvet Suit and Pink Booties.  So Adorable.   ...   🎈🎃🧨
Yesssss the mystery boxes tho omg
Love these!
love it
Holy shit, that army green lipstick is AMAZEBALLS!!!
Looks bad ass!!!
Even if you aren’t a fan of him, you have to respect his work ethic, I mean his makeup products are VERY high quality.
Of course he returns with a launch video honestly he use to be a safe place for me but now its all about drama and his brands he doesn't even do his own makeup nowadays
Yasss the mystery boxes are here 👻🎃 who else is excited 😆
Other youtubers: nice computer graphics and visual effects  Jeffree: a real fckng giant velvet trap
Bro Jeffery sitting in a whole trap. Fuckin epic asf
Oh Yasss work bitch! Miss jeffree you doin it! I'm so stoked for these and Halloween boxes 👻 🎃!! This girl is ready for Friday hunntyyy!!!!!!
Those velvet photo shoots are incredible 🔥👑🖤
Who love Jeffree star?   Leave a like💕  Love from the Philippines
Everybody trying to hate on Jeffery because he’s more successful then them 😂
Lmao I truly get he's a brand owner and all...but danm he's gone from interesting to just a walking advertisement....pass
I want the entire collection 😫  the formula looks so amazing and creamy. Love how the photoshoot turned out. Your team is so amazing 👏 😍
Omg this is amazing!!!  Jeffree your the one person who’s mind never stops creating!! Love it
I'm buying it.
Who are these palates being aimed at? Ever since Orgy came out, I dont let my teen daughters get near your makeup. Now "velvet trap" as in a vagina or anus. STOP. I am sure there are other names  that are also offensive to teem girls. If it was just gat men buying your products them cool.
Beautiful! ✨💕
Oh my god I really want to try these 😩😩😩😩😩😩
Is it les dry than the previous lipsticks? I really didn’t like that formula
Jawbreaker looks like Coral Blue number 2 semi gloss lipstick lol 💙
These are some beautiful colors.
im so hyped
“yOu reAllY oNLy nEeD oNe sWipE” *continues to swipe multiple times*
I want all of it, the colours are so beautiful 💕💕😩
So is there glitter in the lipsticks? Ugh which one do I choose? Mystery boxes!
Shades are so beautiful
Jeffery is such great sales person, that’s it.  but if you’re bad person, your product doesn’t mean anything, but a bait on the  hook. No shame
💗 Love your nails, Mama Star! 💗
Somebody send me these please😅😫 literally own one lipstick need some colour in my lifeeee but my banks telling me noo😂
Lmao omg nooo lmao I can’t I seriously can’t with these influencers... last video was   I don’t want anyone to think I only upload when I have new Merch....  here’s my new merch lmao I can’t
The monogram on the lipsticks are everything 🙌🏼
If anyone wants to know the song during the photoshoot: Afterlife - Besomorph & EMM
I’m living for the red !!!
Man he is rich rich
I LOVE IT! looks so good! Very tempting to get a mystery box... I really was mad when I saw the Purple liquid lip with orange glitter and I couldn’t get it 😫
Lisa Eldridge already did this. Copy much?
Medieval kiss is gorgeous 😍
My birthday is November 3rd!!!!! I wouldn't mind a birthday gift😘😘😘😘😘 scorpioooo
I love, love, love the hawt pink velour tracksuit with the baby pink heeled ankle length boots.
Caca green lol
So how bout the jaclyn hill vibes? Only post vids before a launch... haha nahhhhh im good
I kinda like the magnet, means i wont accidentally slaughter my lipstick when trying to put the cap back on
Up for 28 minutes with 91k view
Hello there
Woah Jeff, your makeup is amazing here!
That’s gonna be in my purse and people are gonna think it’s a vibrator 😂😅

Looks like a v*brator
Ok I’m going to try get the deluxe box fingers crossed
JS always on point and great products. He knows he isn’t perfect and he takes the piss for it.  💙💙💅🏻
i need to know whats in those boxes!!!!!!
Here before the dislikes reach 1k lol
Beautiful
I don't get why people hate Jefree he is such a positive person, entertaining and an inspiration to others much respects
I saw medievil i just love it
Haters gonna hate but I still love Jeffrey Star and his cosmetics ⭐️ 💄
YAAAAAAASSSSSSSS💜💜💜💜💜💜
Omfg i had a bet as soon as his last video came out that he was gonna do a release within a week lmao yay i won jeff you are soo predictable hun
OMG, my jaw dropped
Wow. Just wow.
You can think what you want about jeffree star, but you can't deny that his makeup cosmetics on #1 .
u should name a lipstick called MS.MAMA
I am glad my girlfriend doesn’t want anymore make up. With this covid virus, there is no need to wear make up anymore
I love this! But I’m always wearing a 😷
YAAAASSS
These are absolutely amazing omg
Holy shit that looks pretty cool ngl
Everyone complaining about him promoting his products: he’s a BRAND OWNER. Advertising is a must. That’s how it works when you are the CEO of your own company. Please get over yourselves.
welcome back mama
What is the name of the song its so cool and catchy
When October 16 got a lot on you 1. It will be my birthday  2. End of the school quarter 3. Jeffree Star launch 4. Big Test 5. Other things cuz I can't think of anymore
There us a resemblabce between Jeffree and Jacklin. PLEASE PROVE ME WRONG!!!
I’m getting it all!!!!!!!! Bye bye 💰!!!!
Ok but how extra is that trap thing, obsessed
Whatever you think about Jeffree you can't deny his brand is top-tier
NO ONE ASKED FOR LIPSTICK does JS realize there is a pandemic 😷
Super excited Jefferee! I finally can buy a mystery box this year and can’t wait to buy the biggest one!
Man ohhh man imma go broke 👁👄👁
Lol so apparently brand owners can’t advertise their products
"WOOOOOOF"
Hi jeff😀😁😁
idk, im not really feeling the background, or velvet trap aesthetic.. its very ugly. i dont want to be rude. the lipsticks look good though!
Omg the mystery box I'm getting it for sure!
I’ve never been here so early
Omg so happy for you love! Wish I had the funds to get these and support you! Keep your head high 💕
I am so impressed with the grey lipstick I never see grey lipsticks and i know it's a hard shade to make I want it👏
So excited 🤩🤩🤩
I don't support Jeffree anymore but I will always say that his products are the best out there by far!
Jacklyn Hill is that you  He only comes back when he's gonna sale us something lol why did he get offended about it when he knew he was gonna do that
When Jeffre wore that red wig with that silver dress anyone reminded of Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy?   No just me.
I'm always looking for a shade thats red gold
How have y'all moved on from the drama. Humanity is terrifying
I cant wait to try the new lippies, when will you make a green palette 😍
So we not finna talk about that black beauty that absolutely SLAYED? She’s gorgeous!😍
I am so excited for Friday!! 😍💄💄💄💋💋💋 congratulations on your new lipstick launch!
That red! 😳 Must have!
Jeffree...did you really not mean for those to look like the bullet vibrators? 😂😂😂 Honey Suck Me is beautiful but I don’t wear lip colors ever 😂 I have JSC nudes and red sets in the liquid formula and hate them. Not trying to be mean, it’s just not for me. I can’t stand any liquid lipstick! WAIT UNICORN BLOOD. DAMN IT HE GOT ME.
Jeffrey Star build up all his NEW DRAMA just to come back on YOUTUBE AND SHOW HIS NEW LIPSTICKS..... SUCH A DRAMA QUEEN !!!!
Yay just in time for my birthday!!! 🥰
Jeffree Star is the only person on this planet that looks normal without eyebrows.  Just sayin'.
I saw velvet listick with that texture from another brand. Lisa eldridge? Something.
I was literally on the website a few hours ago checking to see if he had lichee the mystery boxes yet! I’ve never been able to get one. I hope to this year!
I hope to get your Halloween mystery boxes
I wanna know if other popular lip ammo shades will make it. 😂
Jeffree I’m so proud of you, I’ve been following you/your career since the MySpace days & im honestly so proud at how far you’ve come. No matter what happens I will forever support you. I love your face, stay beautiful. ❤️
Jeffree slowly but surely becoming the male version of Jaclyn Hill where he only comes on to drop products then dips.
i want it all playing in the backgroundd
why does the model lowkey look like rhianna at 6:54 👁👄👁
Can see the drama coming🙃
ahou i love your vidéo and your enregie tank your very matche🐩🐩
Yesssssssssss
yes of course you had boyfriend drama right before a launch. of course you get the media to look at you right before a launch. isn’t that funny
Your eyeshadow is fire!
Of course this, of course that, how about next time editing few of them out?
So Jaded is my favourite out of the whole collection. I been dying for a Dark Pine Tree Green colour ( as that's my favourite colour) as lipstick shade for like ever and finally one of my favorite brands has created it.  I'll take all the So Jaded lipsticks please
Loving the new line 🤩
Thank you for sharing Jeffree.Hope everybody here becomes successful on YouTube :)
Glad I got a lip ammo before they retired 😭 they where ICONIC it was the shade galaxy gold and it is so creamy and pigmented I DIED I know these new ones are going to be SO GOOD
Need that one called pure hell cos I am goth AF. Love his black liquid lip called weirdo.
So cancel culture basically doesn’t do much
I’ve never been able to find a nude lipstick that is light enough for my skin tone.. I hope diet mannequin would be the perfect nude for me. 🤩
I thought velvet trap meant vagina
Last vid he said thAt he was not just coming to show us a new lunch yet here we are
oh that's why the random video 3 days ago, so that people won't be able to accuse him of showing up only when he wants to get money from his subs :O
Love that trap jeffree yasss gurl 💖💅🏼
🌟🦄 *UBICORN BLOOD* ... 💖🖤💖🖤💖🖤 ...   *STUNNING!!!*  Stay Safe 😷 & 💗 Much Love ~😈🔺🦋
Man i love this guy ...coz he is jst himself
Have you considered making a beauty advent calendar?
“Drill sergeant” and “Honey suck me” match jeffree’s hair PERFECTLY
I really really want a mystery box so bad it kills my soul a little inside the last time I went to order one and they were all sold out so fingers crossed that I will be able to get one this time even if it’s the mini one idc
Back to our regularly scheduled program...
yas come thru queen
here before a million views😘✌
People can say what they want, but no one can deny that when it comes to cosmetics, he is just the best. He loves it, it's a true passion and that's why he works so hard on it.
Love the name and the concept. Don't forget the lipsticks! Love that too!💖💄💕🌟✌
Hi miss you!
I adore you Jeffrey ⭐️!!!
This is shot so far away, I can’t see shit lol
Absolutely love that green. 😍😍😍
Girl I am Loving ALL the shades!! much love from NY
Omg omg omg omg I’m buying it right nowwwwww
OMG IT LAUNCHES WHEN MY EBT RELOADS 🤫💀💀💀 IM GEEKED
Would love them but the Covid is set up and having to wear a mask every where, it would be a waste of my money but you can take my money for the Halloween box’s
Jeffrey Star you are the best and I love watching your videos they make day and they make me laugh a lot . you are the best and wish you the best
Mystery boxes are only available on his website correct??
Jeffree!! Loving new stuff! But, I must say, I will forsure miss the silver tip of the lipsticks!
Wow that's a snazzy trap
Congratulations!  So excited to see new product!  Also glad to see Lipstick Nick (briefly) in the campaign.  Take care and looking forward to the JSC Anniversary/Birthday/Holiday Collection!
Why is no one talking about the fact they’re doing a huge photo shoot with lots of people in a pandemic 🤨
What time is the launch on Friday???? Am I’m deaf and NOT hear a time???
Wow stunning colors
Can't wait to get these!
Anyone else struggling to see the shades wish he’d gone in closer ?
Wow the background of the video its insane🥰🥰😍
These look like some matte lips u can see every line on the models lips u should of went with eyeliners since everyone is wearing mask where u can't see our lips. Give us the green palette every one has asked for
👸🏼👸🏼👸🏼👸🏼👸🏼👸🏼
YASS !!! The Queen 👸🙏🤩 is BACK !!!! ⭐️🌟⭐️🌟
*SETS ALARM*
Really bad Camera work  its so far away 🙄🙄
Am I tripping or does Jeffree not have an eyeshadow primer?
lmao, everyone knew you were going to release something after the "robbery" bahahaha
Looks like my vibrater
Oop
BlackPink kill this love anyone ?
Yesss queen, werk
The ruby glass slipper nails.....grrrrl!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Kill this love setup
I LOVE IT WHEN HE COMES UP WITH NEW THINGS!! ILYYY!!!
Velvet? Lisa Eldridge anyone??
Who else is sad about the lip ammunition going to retirement.  I just got the conspiracy palette!!! I haven't even tried it yet smh
jeffree: you guys are going to GAG *echos in large pink velvet room*  me in bed eating my trail mix: 👁👄👁
Did you say “velvet snatch?”
I know this has nothing to do with the video but please just hear me out... I wanted to ask anyone on here if they can find it in their heart, if they are able to help me with my rent. I know we are all going through a very hard time right now due to Covid, but I am trying everything I can to come up with my rent money. I am unfortunately a single mother. I have a beautiful daughter and I am really struggling. I am on the verge of going homeless because Ive lost my business due to this pandemic. I’ve tried everything I can and I am terrified to bring my daughter to live on the streets, especially as a single woman with a black daughter, it’s even harder! I’ve literally had to choose between food and rent. I have no family or friends where I live and I hate to even do this and ask but if anyone can help I would so much appreciate it! Unfortunately the United States is not taking care of its people right now and I know I’m not alone in this situation. God bless you all and I hope everyone stays safe ❤️❤️❤️ My cash app is $KaylovesMia  Thank you to anyone who can help and please at least keep my daughter and I in your prayers as I will for all of you ❤️💕👊🏽 👊🏽 👊🏽
Does anybody else think velvet trap is  a euphemism for vagina?
Omfg ilysm. I've been dealing with a very sick dog. Shes paralyzed from the waist back and she can't even stand or go potty. Its been.... alot. Im doing it all alone and my mental health issues are really taken a hit during this. But jeffree, u are a little ray of sunshine in my very dark world rn. So thank u for being u, u wonderful person u.
•
He really b making them look more like bullet vibrators
Omg...nudist colony is my fav...
I dIdNt cOmE bAcK tO aNnOuNcE sOmEtHiNg

I'm too broke to buy anything, but Imma still watch this video and awww at the products. 💅🏼
Ok I don’t even like Jeffree but that medieval one
I need Jeffrey's collection😭💓 i really like it💓💓
Everyone complaining about him promoting his products: he’s a BRAND OWNER. Advertising is a must. That’s how it works when you are the CEO of your own company. Please get over yourselves. (Edit) someone literally copy and pasted this comment 4 minutes after I posted it, and Jeffree replied to it. I’m so heartbroken rn.
BlackPink in your area!
Yooooo I am dead with the free music you chose 😂😂😂😂😂
I can't wait until I have all three of those mystery boxes, they'll be my first ever from Jeffree Star Cosmetics! 👻🥰👻🥰👻
I LOVE. But the foundation you’ve been wearing lately is not the one hunny. Looks like it’s separating. Congratulations on the new line! X
Its like blackpink kill this love theme
I’m not gonna lie lol the lip sticks are sick
Every video is just a straight up flex
How I wish I can try it!!!!! 😤
I was so confused at worst seeing lipsticks cause I thought they were deformed... THEN I SAW ITS THE JSC logo on the actual lipstick O.o
Omg!!! 😭💕💖💗 I need to work more 😭😂💕💖💗
So excited

U outdid yourself! I love your passion for makeup and how u care what ur clients want in packaging and performance..love you!!!
All of us wearing masks 24/7 no one sees our lips.  Who is buying lips products?
this would be a great time for my student loan to have gone through😂😂😂 GIVE ME THEM MYSTERY BOXES
I KNEW YOU HAD SOMETHING UP YOUR SLEEVES when you did your "comeback"
BlackPink did it better (dancing in the middle of a trap in Kill This Love)
Oh wow... it’s coming to Disney with me!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Jeffree! Your real fans never left your side. We will always be here. Ignore those broke haters. I swear people can’t stand seeing someone controversial be so successful. I will stand up and say it, I’ll always be a J* fan 💯🖤👑
Omg I am going to go broke!!! 💜💜💜💜
trash
I'm not even that tan and all of his nude lips are waaaaay too light for me 😭
Are they still orange scented?  I want to buy so many of these new shades, but the scent of the lip ammunition really put my allergic-to-orange self off to the point I couldn't wear them
Divahhh u have done it again 🍾🥂🧁😘😘🥳🥳
Wow what a shock, accuse a black man of stealing from you and then launch more products lmao, hate to be your fans who support your behavior 😍👏
Hiiiii
Such a beautiful collection🤩🎀⭐️ The efforts you always go to to give us the ultimate aesthetic/experience/moment is unparalleled & when it comes to the creative vision behind all of your #JeffreeStarCosmetics I really admire that you’re always being all inclusive, always innovative & always striving for quality formals👌🏼💯👑💄💋  May you continue to be successful in all your endeavors cuz honey I’m so here for it!🥰😘✖️💋
Maybe I missed it but did Jeffree mention if the mystery boxes will be on Beautylish?
Looks like he borrowed that from black pink.  In let's kill this love.
Ugh loveeee! 💕 Planning on picking up Naked Body, Honey Suck Me, and Pure Hell 😁
I wish Jeffree Star website ships to Spain
I’m so excited
But that back ground is iconic
Happy you made a thing for the bullets. I was wanting some for my bullets at home !
promo pictures of this campaign... hello??!! amazing!
these shades are beyond beautiful
So excited for everything!!!  Wish I had the money to get the mystery boxes!!  I would be thrilled to get them for my birthday month! #Scorpio
Looking forward to oct 16th - thank you JS
Honestly I prefer the old lipstick packaging... this new all pink component  is giving me dild0 vibes and its awkward 😭😭
fabulous
It's my bday
I really hope those lipsticks will also be on beautybay! I really wanna buy them 😍
YAAAAAS 😍
Love the formula, can't wait till things get better for me, so I  can get those green shades! Would love a mystery box, but can't afford to right now, so gonna start saving for next year. Love Halloween.  But as usual, Jeffree Star is killing it!
34 minutes.
You can’t deny that Jeffree creates his makeup with high idealistic designs and perfect formulas.
Early.
That magnetic cover is going to be perfect for me and my poor handbag! No more lipstick nightmares. 💄
Love the colors
Look we get it, you: Were here before a million Like jeffree star Can't afford his makeup Don't own his makeup but still watch Don't wear makeup but still watch Read the comments Only notice selective comment that will give you a witty comment Chase clout by being edgy in opposition to all the like Are mad about bots Mad about people saying the same thing Have a generic redo of generic comment It's you It's nobody Literally no one Mad about your life and jeffree is the one who just happened to be here....  We fucking get it, none of you...not even the anti-basic-comments, are original.
Omgggg so excited!!!!!!!!!!❤️❤️😍
y'all can hate him all you want but these lipsticks are "perfectly splendid" lol
Make more lip scrubs giiiiirrrllll!!!!!!
💜
It's not hairy!!!!! just vElVeT XD
I wish there were more drown mauve color 😭😭
Why he sitting like that😭
Naked body is literally the best “my lips but better” color I’ve ever seen. I can NEVER find this color. And the tones are perfect! I’m going to have to pick a few of theses up girl!!
I live for that black lipstick 😍🖤
Never been here before a million ppl
Love these. Can't wait for the mystery box. I love his makeup formula.
These are beautiful Jeffree! Kudos to you doing the damn thing as always.
Yassssss more jeffree star cosmetics too buy !! Can’t get enough love his products ❤️
Medieval Kiss reminds me of the old school Raisin Rage by Revlon (hey, that's what we wore in the 90s!) Ooooh I want one!!!
Omg yaaas!!! 💄💄💄
To busy reading the comments than watching the video 😭
Being your genuine follower and can't able to use your makeup hurts because I am broke😭
Controversy Silence Heartbreak Product launch  Controversy Silence Heartbreak Product launch  Controversy Silence Heartbreak Product launch    Rinse and repeat...
Omg i love “medieval kiss”!!! I need ittttt <3
This looks sick! The stamp on the actual lipstick killed it!
Nudist Colony looks so Gorg! & I need the Pure Hell for Halloween 🖤 20 shades for 2020! 🤩 Launches on My Man's Birthday 🎉 This year may be turning around. On some levels anyway.. OmGoodness 💜🖤💜🖤 Deluxe Mystery Box Please 🙏🏼
Here before a million train whazzz up ;)
Just here for the comments tbh
"If youre afraid of red lipstick, can't relate!"-Omg me😂👄
Congratulations Jeffree on the new addition to your collection They look amazing, beautiful shades. I've only recently found the love for all things JS make up, well make up full stop lol. As taking care of my special needs son took all my time. Now his a little older and a little more manageable, I found a little time for me and your collection very addicting. I'm building a nice little collection lol. My only disappointment is I found my love for make up to late for the Alien pallete 😭😭😭. You had just announced it's discontinue and by then it was sold out everywhere I could think of trying... I hope one day you will bring it back as a limited addition 🤞🤞one can hope lol. Congrats again 🥰🥰🥰
Hello my bíg sistar ! Love you !⭐️♥️💋💕
Georgous colours!!  Great job Jeffery Congratulations
So so many greens
Hey, are the lipsticks transfer proof?
Is this launch exclusive to JSC website or will it also be sold on your affiliate sites??
Lip ammunition was my fave 😭😭😭
Love that for you Jeffree! Velvet trap is looking beautiful and the photoshoot is just stunning!  And who is afraid to wear colors? Can't relate neither ^^
How he looks at the lipstick at 12:08 how I look at my hot Cheetos 💀
He didn't say what time on Friday..... I am screaming
Does anyone else hear the background music???????turn it up and listen
I’m so happy Jeffree is back! Ugh missed his content 💋💄
Will it melt after one use?  My alien tears got soft after one use. Am I suppose to store it in the fridge so it doesn’t get melty?
I love red one. I eant it in Poland!
Love the bounce to your curls Girl!
Woaaaabh LOOOVEEEE YOUR SETUPPP💕
Oh... Ok.. So... Just nothing and everything
i farted...
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcu990TqEVtJVpNkS1TBF2w
so this is why he uploaded that last video 🙄
I don’t get it why people get mad when makeup artists upload a video to sell their products. That’s what they’re supposed to do! 🤦🏻‍♀️ I personally love launch videos.
Do only some of the ppl that watch Jeffree understand that he’s a businessman before a youtuber? He doesn’t have a separate account for his business and promoting his stuff. Why worry about two accounts lol when he has so many other things to do and worry about. Cool you like his drama but he’s also a hard working bitch that owns multiple businesses and has more to do with his life then just think about the drama and let negativity bring him down... cool you want him to suffer but he has employees to pay and lot of other ppl counting on him to sell their things... so chill out. Bringing him down means more then just him. He pays a big ass team, pays for 3 or more buildings worth of employees and supplies plus some smaller businesses or youtubers go to him for shipping out their merch and shit.
I’m ready for this collection
Oooooooooo baby I can't wait ❣️❣️ probably won't get the biggest box but def getting the other two.
1 swipe... does 3+ for each with no close ups of a q swipe... still beautiful but you drag people for claiming a 1 swipe application but dont show your own product with a 1 swipe🤷🏽‍♀️
I clicked so fast but I’m still first
Jeffree- *sits in giant bear trap in the same position the entire time*  me- mr. yoga hiiiiii
Rest in peace to whoever is boom microphone operator
too much Blackpink for today Jeffree

Yasss Queen
I thought I already unsubbed oops.
Your team needs to invest in wireless mics or better boom mics due to the audio bouncing so badly.
Yo what’s the name of the song
Jessie maya👀❤
I’m still too broke to buy anything... but I won’t lie, those mystery boxes have my imagination running wild. Siiigh... one day.
Yay mystery boxes releasing on pay day 🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️
Jeffrey: ... Velvet Trap Me: is that a vagina reference? 🤣
These images are STUNNING! And I cant wait to try that new formula 😍
I need a mystery box like now!!!  I hope they don’t sell out
Knowing this dude, he probably put money in those mystery boxes lol
Literally the new jaclyn hill. Only posting when he has something to sell.
I can't wait!!! ( and the drama about to happen😒🙄)
how do his legs not fall asleep.. like my would be gone
I dont care about anything. I love Jeffree!
Again this skank only shows his face when she's selling something.Im not giving her one cent.
Where is the jeffree star iconic Mannequin Skin Foundation?!??!!! 😩😩❤️❤️❤️
Since when his videos are censored?! Or is it just me?!
Please do a tutorial on them eyeeyeyes 🦊🦊🦊🦊🦊
"The Perfect Red" really IS the perfect red. I have been collecting and wearing red lipstick for years and years and THAT is perfection.
This set reminds me of BlackPink’s Kill this Love set!
I'm legit so maddd it launches on my birthday I might not even get it but I'm finna hope on this website and try to order
Song please ?
IM SO EXCITED FOR THE DELUXE ANS CELEBRITY SKIN
How is it that Jeffrey is allowed to bounce back, quite simply, from his scandal yet Shane is slandered when he even dares to breathe on the internet? Make👏it👏make👏sense!!
I’m getting the smallest box😆💀 I would get the medium one but 60$ is a lot🥵
WHAT TIME?!
Jeffree been single too long. Haha. But that's a great design JS.
This is like one of those tele buy channels where you ring in lol 🤣
Iove that red 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
That set is fucking mind blowing!! Major props to your set designers, they killed it as always!
Jeffrey get ready for me to be your next model💕
What happened to the color masochist???????
Also I love that he improved his lipsticks and kept the price the same. You a real one  🖤
Waiting for all the drama channels to make a video about this....😶😶
Yay! I am so excited for u and all ur accomplishments Jeffree.. u have worked hard in ur life from what I have seen and deserve it all so congratulations hun!🥰✌️
Ok, ngl but that red curly wig is EVERYTHING.
You didn’t post a swatch of naked body ☹️☹️☹️
I love u
DAMN!!! Really wish I could afford one of the mystery boxes!! Those new lipsticks look insane!!
Jefree🤩 in the red Wig -Iam Deceased!❤️💀

You know I love Stacy, but now (sorry Trixie😢) she's a Hot Commodity!! 😍🙏😍
Imagine being worthy enough to do Jeffree Stars makeup 😱
I love all the colors in your collection. Amazing
I KNEW it was new lipstick!!! In your IG story when you asked if we could guess, I knew immediately! I am soooo excited to try this beautiful new formula! I need the entire collection 😍😍😍
Kinda weird to me that the lipstick looks like velvet but the application does not look like velvet.
I hardly wear makeup anymore because I stay home a lot due to Covid but... I’m snatching these idc
Bruhhh WOW.!
Need all the crazy colors
Can not wait hopefully I can get something this round
He really come to youtube just days before he launches something new. The new Jacklyn Hill people
im just here for the Jefree Star slander in the comments xxx sksk
Looks so good! I need this 😍🤩
This better come with some sticker!
Is that a grey?!?! Yaaas!!! I'm so excited
With lipstick I feel packaging is alot of what people look at aswell and this one just looks like a small penis. Not a fan. Wish you had steped away from the bullet look or had another colour with the pink. Lip sticks themselfs look nice tho.
I know Jeffrey star is pretty and all but you have to choose, is james Charles prettier or Jeffrey star? I pick james Charles lol, and no hate to Jeffrey star, and sorry for the Jeffrey fans
“it’s one swipe” does 3
Finally Jeffrey is just ignoring all the drama... It Got so boring!!!
stand by while i set a timer to get it all
I knew it duh.... another JH the house but more evil, he add big drama first and boom new launch
What time on the 16th
The boxes launch on my birthday, gonna get somethin’ for myself
Jeffree Listen  1st) your ear piercings look amazing  2nd) those lipsticks are DOPE they are so amazing, the monogram on the product itself? I’m gonna gag.
. how boring talking about lipsticks is.goodnight
I've never seen a lipstick that cool. I love the look with the logo on the actual lipstick it's so so cool 😯😯 brilliant job 👏🏻🔥🔥💋💋💋
I am mere before a million views
I can't wait to try 😍 that orange red shade thoooo 👀👄
I`ve never had the money to buy anything off your website, (yes that poor).... But, I love seeing that your thinking of the people collecting your lipstick and make the vanity stand for it, that`s amazing.
I support gay no matter what❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Nobody wearing lipstick these days
OMG! THOSE COLORSSS
I'd live to be apart of the design team at JSC! I am obsessed with packaging and printing techniques, the start to end process and the finished products (3D design). Im graduating my Diploma in November this year!!
this set is so ugly :( come on you can do better
The launch will be on beauty bay too? 😁
What a set wow 😎
Yeass let’s use animal cruelty to market our products 😍😍😍😒
These look so yummy. Sadly I'll have to wait but I can't wait to see whats in the boxes 😔😌
I like the old component way better than the new one.
I want to know which one he had swatched already on his hand but did not talk about.
I need that big mystery box in my life!! I will be holding out for a black Friday sale. 🤞🤞 Lipsticks look amazing and beautiful just as expected!! Love all the displays. Everyone in the campaign looked stunning!
Omgggg that dark skinned girl, I don’t know how to say it any other way without sounding offensive or rude, is STUNNING LIKE WTH SHES PERFECTION
Anyone thinking he needs a new camera guy? This one and his last video about life update.
NO ONE LIKES YOU
THAT FUCKING BEARTRAP YOU BETTER WORK JEFFREE
JeffPink in your area!
Ahhhh im so excited.... I love jeffree and his products🥰🥰😍😍😍😍
The 16th will make exactly one month since I started a new job, and I get my first paycheck Thursday or Friday! This couldn’t have landed more perfect for me..finally! I saw several shades I’m in love with, but my very favorite one that I absolutely cannot live without was The Perfect Red! HOW STUNNING 🤩🤩🤩
Why are people still supporting him :(
Any blinks on the comments that see Kill This Love trap too? Or is it just me?
Congrats & good luck on ur launch. Hope u sell the fk out!
That set is EPIC
kylie cosmetics could never yess
Omg yes Im going to get 6 of them
Why you always gotta drop new products when I get paid 😭
That looks like vibrator but better 🥴 no offense
You always do the best campaign photoshoots. I love how Lipstick Nick is always the one to do your makeup looks for the campaigns as well. Love😍
This video is why I need my stimulus check.
OBSESSED😍😍😍
Hank and henry came out with that kinda lipstick first
Jeffree Star  You're doing the world a favor by giving them the blessing of being here. Love you so much!
I love you I like your makeup in dreams💜💜💞💝💝💜💛
Kisses from Brazil
Let’s kill this love 💔  -Blackpink
So creative. Looking amazing.
Why no pictures of these lipsticks swatched on ppl with a darker skin tone?? 🤷🏼‍♀️ Askin for a friend
Woooow, loved EVERY SINGLE SHADE.
Is that a giant bear trap!!! Wow I don't even have a mouse trap😂 #sad
I'm obsessed with crushed velvet look.. and the glitter looks so pretty! it's not too overpowering. I love the hot pink one.  Where can these be purchased? Amazing presentation, Jeffree! <3 omg wear the dark brown color!!! you never wear brown and your eyes would match sooooo beautifully!
Uffff all of those colours .... 💖💖❤️🤤
I waited for the mystery box announcement for the entire day
Soooooo excited ❤
How long will the boxes be forsale?
Are the mystery boxes being sold on beauty bay?
Yasssss cannot wait for the mystery boxes on Friday
Since everyone is wearing masks these days, I believe it might affect sales.
Really beautiful colors
This drops on my birthday!
anyone else hearing a high-pitch hiss throughout this video?
YEESSSSSSSSSSSSS
I like velvet
when I bought the original lip bullet my co-workers thought I had a mini vibrator in my bag 😂 Now that is all soft pink it looks even more like a vibrator lol.
I don’t have any JSC products but I’m thinking about them mystery boxes so I can start my collection
I love you
Omg that is sum of the sexiest lipsticks I have ever seen. Love Jeffree’s logo printed in it....💄
Jeffree, I can't believe you had like the brand new cosmetics lipstick formula called, Velvet Trap at your house in L.A. on this video during your quarantine and it's from your own cosmetics including the Halloween mystery boxes, but I love it and you look sickening with the gray/pink wig on, honey!!
It's a no for me
goals!!!!!!
I want a mystery box!!!! So excited!!!
It just amazes me how Jeffree Star FUCKS IT UP with his products. No matter what you say about him he’s one of the most creative makeup creators the industry has seen in a while and he basically sets the tone for the industry each launch
jeffree: one swipe coverage also jeffree: swipes every shade like 5 times  guuuuuurl
Where's Gemini 😢
i love that he’s a mua but he doesn’t do his own makeup???
Here
They’re launching on my birthday!😱
cant wait for the unboxing videos of this years mystery boxes! 😍 so excited to see what’s in them 🥳 since i can’t really afford even the mini one right now 🤦🏻‍♀️ maybe next year 🤗
Stunning as usual! I want them all.
Что-то как-то плохо накрасился в этот раз😕
im earlyyy 🥺🥺💕 and omgg yess i really want to buy your pallets and makeup
I smell another scandal coming 👀
I feel like he only posted the previous video so people dont say that hes only posting when he has a launch
Why are you stealing ColorPop's component and star imprint? No, this aint it.
here for the comments
Why you gotta release this like 2 weeks before my wedding lol
Yay!! I love you Jeffree! 💕
The colors was stunning.  I want his mystery boxes this year but i know not getting them unleast i get the money this week
Unphased literally is the same color as my mans 1966 cadillac very weird colors back then but gorgeous😍 and funeral parlor ugh I'm about to be obsessed 💯😍💗 wish Champaign tears would come out in the velvet trap formula that color was to die for but hard to work with😪 keep slaying with these colors though
I’m living for his extremely extra set up 😂
i knew it, the moment he uploaded that video a few days ago,  "he's gonna launch a new product soon"
Dammit... I should've waited lmao I jumped on the new concealers and the promo sale with them. I wanna try these, too! 👀  Edit: Okay; Pure Hell, Medieval Kiss, and possibly The Perfect Red.... on the want list when Christmas comes around I guess lmao
I love your videos
I WANT ALL OF THEM PLEASE OMG
Bin all other lipsticks...JS ⭐️ Velvet Trap has arrived! 💄 👄
Were you inspired by Lisa Eldridge's lipsticks? Her's are also "velvet" themed and she developed the velvet texture.
OMG I need that first gray shade😍😍😍😍
🤍💙💜💯
Is it me or is he always hungry?
The new lipstick looks bomb asf 💕🙌🏼🙀
Oh my god! That JSC logo in the lipstick is everything I never knew I wanted!
Honestly perfect timing Jeffree my birthday is Friday!!! I’m so excited! Love you so much❤️
where are all the hate comments?? what am i here for if not to like them
Why wtf is most of the comments filled with:  "I'll sub to anyone who sub's to me!"
I love you so much jeffreestar
I love how he uses every one male female people of color
That trap is so extremely extra and im living for it
OMG. CAN'T WAIT FOR FRIYAY
It looks so cheap the lipstick standing. I know why he’s a millionaire
To be honest, I like your lipsticks and palettes but I can't support someone like you anymore
why was this on my recommended hate it here fr
I'm kinda early
I struggled with lip ammunition it just didn't go on well for me at all. So I can't wait to try these
🎃🎃🎃
I don’t need another mystery box but THEN AGAIN... I DO NEED ANOTHER MYSTERY BOX 😂😍🙌🏻❤️  Unboxing the last one was my first YouTube video on my channel was so fun can’t wait to do it again !!!
Damn i thought jeffree wasn't relevant anymore hes still posting?
High, how are ya?
Me looking at the thumbnail "OMG THIS BTCH I CAN'T 😂"
WOW he really stepped it up 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵 that minimalistic packaging is everything!!!
i dont understand launching a lipstick when you have to wear a mask everywhere?
I like the color it beautiful
I didn’t see watermelon soda?
Looks amazing 🤩
This is so stunning
Love it💗💗
OMG
BUT BITCH, THEYRE NOT JEFFREEY STAR!!! 💫💫💫Yesss!!!! 🤩🤩🤩 that set 😍😍😍
They look more like vibrators than before
Jeff: is offended people think he is coming back to youtube only to announce something   Also Jeff: HERE IS MY NEW PRODUCT LINE
He literally has a whole ass studio, like bigger than my school, kindergarten and house combined.
Even though I will continue to boycott Jeffree's products by no longer purchasing, I will never say Jeffree doesn't know how to design a product.
WAIT, YOU DIDN'T MAKE A MANNEQUIN SHADE????? NOOOOO....PLEASE MAKE ONE!!!!
Didn’t we cancel him already?
'I know there are many formulas but bitch they are NOT Jefrree Star'  Me:Take my money🗣
The lipstick looks like a butt plug or a v*brator 😭
Lipsticks, from the packaging to the product are beautiful! Looking forward to trying them. 💜
i am from South Africa but i wanna come to America just to meet you....i love you XOXO
Oh cool so it’s like Becca lipsticks with the whole magnetic component thang 😎
I want them so bad. looks so good.
I literally went from being a supportive customer of JSC to NEVER buying his products again!
The last 5 🙌
Ahhhh! Take my money 💴
Honestly tho, I would choke if he released a Scorpio collection. Pleeeeeease, I want a Scorpio palette
do you have aids
Please tell me the song when they where modelling the  velvet lipsticks 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I think you should go back to doing the swatches on your actual lips like before
Me being “weighted” .. “so I’m luxurious?!” 👁👄👁
So excited for the mystery boxes :o i wish we could see what’s in them lmao.
Love all the shades 😍
Here before a million views
Wow Jeffrey looks beautiful. I suddenly call him she
Loving pure hell
WHAT IS THIS FIRST RED  ;OOOOOO I'm in LOVE !
Hello echo, how are ya?
It kinda looks like... well, if you're over 18 you know what it looks like.
I’m so confused we’re he getting all these sets😂😂💀😭
Omg loving all the new shades
Hoping Mystery Boxes don't get sold out to fast 🥺 Haven't Scored one yet 🙃
A little sad you didn’t do Calabasas in this formula!
this was better than the iphone event
Jaclyn?? Is that you?!  Jk jk jk! JUST KIDDING!!
Does this seem like a Jaclyn move?
Omg. My life is complete.
Was this before or after the "business" loan you took away from small business's? Good to know what it paid for.
Goes to make a velvet BOX 😭🤣🤣💓💓💓
This collection is literally coming out on my birthday wtf lol
💖 you Jeffree!
Y'all so fake LMAO, some of yall don't get Who Jeffrey Star is, if you click with him, and feel his content, you will be on his side, yall switching teams like this a f*cking Game, chile, anyways, SO
So beautiful 😍❤️❤️❤️
hiiii
Really wish I knew the song he used..
soooooo pretty the set design and daaammmnnnnn jeffree that wig is gorg
Yassss so excited for the Halloween boxes. And about to make myself broke with the new velvet trap lippies 😍😍😍
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 💯✨
I ain’t gonna lie these lipsticks are so cute and for a split second I thought the engraving on them were stickers lmaoo 😂
Call me stupid, but what TIME Friday? Midnight? Eastern/Pacific ?
follow back trisha
so he just repackaged old lipsticks lmao
I really love you Jeffree and i really wanna support you by buying ur products but i cant afford to buy anything for myself.....All i can do is watch your videos n give it a thumbs up..
love your make-up
I love the new bullet though! ❤️
I’m absolutely gagging 😂🤣 the names are always my favorite part of his products other than the fact that they work lol
He too rich for me he is sitting on a giant velvet trap, like 👁👄👁
Omg how i love want you make video's .you are so pretty. Love your personality and you keep it so real.I hope one day i can buy some makeup from but it hard time right now. May one day ..Any way be Safe  out there. 💘
☹️ Calabasas didn’t make the cut to Velvet Trap. Maybe it’ll be in the next launch of colors?
Velvet Trap (echo) ......trap ....trap
💖💖💖💖💖
Girl we were right, she only comes back when she’s ready to sell something..
I like your nails
*New video = New launch*
I was hoping for some eyeshadow singles or some lashes. Going to skip this as I haven't worn lipstick in like 5 months!! Damn masks. Curious about the mystery boxes, but worried it may be filled with discontinued lip ammunitions, straws and pop sockets. Oh well, best of luck on your new launch. The formula does look divine!
Wooww I just love this photoshoot with such awesome colours of lipstick... ❤️❤️❤️❤️
OMG I just love that collection, its a shame in my country does not sell the originals, but someday I will buy every single collection... ❤️🇭🇳
Jeffree WHERE IS THE YELLOW!!??!!!??
I love you Jeffree but your customer service representatives are terrible. Never buying your products again but I'll still watch your videos.
Name of The song 4:55 ??? Anyone?
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
❤❤❤❤🎉
I wish he would’ve given us a bigger heads up than 3 & 3/4 days. Doesn’t he usually give us a good week notice?... I’m so bummed now...
Jeffree last video: y'all only think I come back to reveal new products.. that is NOT true  Jeffree literally a couple days later after not posting ever: hello here are my new products lmao
Previous Video: “people on here are saying the only reason I’m on here is I’m going to release a collection so I can make money”  This video: ummm... I-
I have feeeling this is a "trap"! 12:45 that color looks like "good morning its me: Diarrhea" ( I love it )
No redrum? Ok....
Watching videos of things i can never afford 😂😂
20 minsomfg
I’m gonna need that deluxe 👀👀
Silver and pink plus velvet is just perfection as are these stunning lip colours.
That set is stunning💗 but it makes me nervous don't hurt yourself. Those nails are everything!
So you just copied the @HankandHenry Lipstick formula and the imprint with sparkle. Cool.
who else is scrolling through the comments with the video on mute 😂💀
A shade was skipped between Celebrity skin and Honey Suck Me .. damn :,( thats a pretty pink coral too.. :/
Beautiful lipstick shade  especially that chocolate brown
I can hear the headlines now,  (J⭐ LOVES TO KILL BEARS!  "⭐ Sits in BEAR TRAP for product launch ! Community enraged!!")
Omg love the new look and formula wow so pretty. ❤❤❤
The embossing on the lipstick, holy fuck.
Yesssss the trap theme is so unique and I love it!
Jeffree star is and will be always on top with his makeup. Period.
I need the shade Drill Sargent in my life!
Thank fucking God Celebrity Skin is there. BEST SHADE EVER! 👌
OMG THE HALLOWEEN STUFF
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate how even though Jeffree Star is a millionaire, he still took the time to make his mystery boxes more affordable for the people who were hit hard because of corona? Thats how you know he really just wants everyone to have access to good ass makeup💕
lol you claim it's one swipe, but it's streaky as all hell until you do three to four passes.
They are very beautiful
That red wig and silver outfit I'm living for!!
Love velvet lipsticks so I can’t wait to try your formula and attempt to get my hands on at least one of those mystery boxes 👀
People can say all they want about JS’s personal actions, but DAMN his products are always so good and no one can deny that 😍
Can't wait!
I luv when u do mystery box cause I have never been disappointed with none of the items and the price 🤗
looks like a vibrater
killing it!!!
So good to see you back on the screen ❤❤
Posted on my birthday 💙💫
Those colours! Especially on Jazmina! Simply stunning. The new Velvet Trap lipsticks look beautiful.
Jeffree basically made a 70's p0rn0 set.... And I'm here for it.
I really thought after the valentines day boxs he would postpone halloween boxs...
The sound is bad. Now I'm sad.
I wish there was a bundle so we could get all the shades
When are the lipsticks available on beauty bay? Love to try these 🥰 x
Reminds me of Lisa Eldridge’s velvet lipstick - can’t wait to try !
SO EXCITEEEEDDDDDD
Damn.  Momma likes velvet.
what an iconic collection
Rest in peace lip amuniton
I can't wait 😍💄
The magnet is great, no more lids slipping off an little bits getting all it! Love it!
AWESOME
Please show more behind the scenes footage or shoots and sets being made. It's so cool seeing all the work being done to create the magic of the shoots.
They actually look amazing
Jeffree should sell *Face Masks* instead of lipsticks. lol
Anyone else reminded of black pink.... no just me?
Are these new lipsticks the same price as the lip ammunition? Those were $18 I think 🤔
They look like suppositories lmao
Distraction much?
Video doesnt match audio
The perfect red and union corn blood is calling my name. Crazy i just dyed my hair dark red today and this video is up💋
giving me very much Kylie cosmetic vibes...
Awesome!!
I support ms Jeffree Lynn and I don’t care what anyone else says. Even a bitter thieving pos who has no life that he has to Steal from the queen and lie on her.
Oh another collection
Too expensive...
My birthday is the 26 guess I know what I’m getting myself SCORPIO IN THE HOUSE!!!
Oml he looks amazing in that jumpsuit !!
Shook
Who else is already stalking Jeffery star cosmetics.           Come Friday I’ll be watching      And they will already be sold out   In less then 1 second
I think my favourite pic that you showed from the shoot was the one with the lipstick all over the guy's face. XD
Yassssss! I'm so excited Jeffree!
💗
❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Oops, I forgot to unsubscribe! *Unsubscribes cutely*
All these negative comments .........yet u all rushed here ?? If u don't like dont watch and don't buy his products. Its really simple. Life is way to short to be watching someone u don't like or taking time out ur day to leave nasty comments, move on with ur life folks and go live it! Dont waste ur time if ur not a fan. Talk about folks looking for drama !
What's up Jeffree
Oh I Am Soo Excited! First time buying a Halloween mystery box!
Are you going to do my fave androgeny
Beautiful lipsticks 💄 😍
I would buy these lipsticks just to look at them. AMAZING packaging! ✨
Jeffree says he doesn't upload right before a launch but we all know that's a lie...period
JeffreeStar I'm Loving Ur Nails ❤ 💙 💚 💛 💓 💜 💕 💖 💗 💘 💞 💋 💋 👄 👄
This reminds me of Lisa Eldrige lipsticks .....anyone?
The actual hell is this set up
Right before my birthday on the 18th!!! I cannot waittttt to get my first mystery box
we love a king who deletes negative comments
I know this is Ridiculous but Jeffree if you’re reading this can you please mail me one!!!
I’m gonna be so broke. Back to 7 12s a week, I guess! lol
That fuckin curly red wig 🔥 🔥 🔥
for my blinks does this look familiar
I literally never have money to get any of the mystery boxes or launches when they go live. 😐
I missed you! Even tho I don’t know you 🥰😘💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
I am kinda upset past one year he only (rarely) comes YouTube when he is launching a product ....
I love the set up 😵 SICKKENING
RIP to this channel... All jeffree uses his channel for anymore is self promotion and forced apology videos... I used to love this channel so much.
Prayers for Diva. My mother got Diabetes from Immunotherapy this year during her cancer treatment as well.  Super rare.  💕
Hi Jeffree Those velvet trap lipsticks look amazing, wish i could get them all.
So excited I love a good lipstick and I was obsessed with your old formula so I can’t wait to purchase the new ones. They look gorgeous and I’m obsessed with the packaging, the bullet and the colors. Congrats!!!
Did someone think of blackpink after seeing that trap?.......just me??
Those nails are amazing <3
Fire starter? I wonder if that was a pokemon reference lol
You makeup is so amazing! My mom and I now have something else to bond over. I can't wait to get my mother some of these for Christmas!
Once a year. One mystery box should include MEETING YOU💖  The #JS💖PinkTicket.                                   🌿💚🌎🌿💚🦋😊😊🦋
Que pedo! Llegué temprano!!!
I thought the boxes were gonna be more affordable..
Yeeessss!!!
Yay hope the boxes are better than the last ones
WE MUST KILL THIS LOVE YEAH IT'S SAD BUT TRUE
I’m ready for this mystery box. I’m getting the delux I swear to god
When I clicked it was at 1.6k views. Now 65k
the way hes recycling his old products cuz his sales are going down
is this being sold on beauty bay?
Maybe I'm just emotional being that time, but I seriously wish I had the money to purchase all of this. Ive never loved any lipsticks like I do jeffrees. Ive only ever bought 1 thing from jeffree, since it all ive ever been able to afford and of course, his lips! Im actually crying because its all so beautiful and I know I can't get any of it! The lips, holders, and a mystery box!
Biiitch!!!!!! 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
The lipsticks themselves look a lot like Lisa Eldridge’s
wow i love the new component 😍😍😍
So ...Jeffree is gonna be gone for weeks and pop up again when he needs to promote another launch?! It’s clearly a pattern by now
I want sooo many of these gorgeous shades. The more colours he introduced the more I wanted! 😍❤️
I wonder if this alien goddess will even see this but what I wouldn’t give to meet Jeffree and play with makeup. I’d quit my job and move to California to be able to be a part of this amazing company.
🧞‍♂️🧞‍♂️🧞‍♂️🧞‍♂️
Everything looks great!! Make some JSC coasters for your red bull haha 🌈💕
Who else is hoping all the drama means you'll have half a chance at getting something on launch day?!?!?!
I see jeffree took inspiration from Blackpink in their Kill This Love music video with the giant bear trap....
Will the after pay be available for it?
Can’t WAIT!!!❤️
Omg talk about trying to rip off Lisa Eldridge!!!
FINALLY, been needing new lipsticks for so long😭 The glosses are great but I need lipsticks and velours!
Can he add video without selling stuff later geez
Love her or hate her but her makeup formulas are top notch.
The lipsticks look like those tiny vibrators.
👄 ❤️
Diva Star as always,  over the top and  HOT A/F great stuff.
WOWWW
“One swipe!!” *swipes it a thousand times* 👀
You have never looked better
Is this a titillating nod to the Killroom in your gated community’s basement?
no wonder he posted the other day..
I miss the old times when Jeffree did those makeup reveals & reviews. Collabe doing fun things instead of those unnecessary drama etc ... I thought there gonna be a lot videos for Jeffree to upload during this quarantine time but ... only the drama...
I need 3! Can't wait
So excited mystery boxes are back and my wallet is now officially broken
Who will be buying the mystery box??! I’m very curious if ppl are gonna go crazy for them like before!
LOVE 💕💕💕 you always rock it
*I need them all '_'*
Oh my God how I wish I could afford Jeffree Stars products. I have one lip gloss from him that a friend gifted to me and I wear it every single time I do my makeup.
Soon I can afford it all!  I’m a avid fan from PH! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
OMG THAT SET UP
How's he sit there like that for so long??! My legs would fall asleep/lose circulation 😅
Jeffree always has the prettiest models
I wouldn’t care if jeffree only Came on YouTube for a launch video lol best way back at ppl is success!
Here before 1 million
Omg. Nooooo. Right in the middle of the reveal my Internet goes out.  Why me?
And the model montage...ahhh and that black lipstick. I don't like wearing lipstick but that black lip makes my goth heart SOB 😭💚💚💚
GOING really ALL THE WAY WITH YOUR, JEFFREY, LAUNCHES:  STUDIOS, MODELS, ARTISTS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, LIGHTING, SETS, FASHION, ASSECCORIES. ETC ETC ETC...  IT IS PROOF THAT - UNLIKE MOST, WHO WANT TO JUST COIN IT IN ON MEDIOCRE PRODUCTS - YOU, JEFFREY, ACTUALLY CREATE JOBS, JOBS, JOBS, SHARE TALENT AND "THE EXPERIENCES".  As you say:  "Go all the way - or go home".   JEFFREY, YOU ARE PUTTING ALL THE OTHER MAKE UP WANNA-BE'S TO SHAME.   THANK YOU THANK YOU.  GOD BLESS.
Yasssss🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
This is gorgeous. I- I’m speechless
Wtf
Wtf I thought I unsubbed from you I guess I’ll do it now 😐
Love you Jeffree ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Oh, she has something to sale.... 🤣🤣
That feeling when you're randomly browsing a channel and new video pops up, I mean ooookeee
Mystery Boxes Come To Momma!!! Gimme Gimme Gimme🎃🎁
Why you shouting
Epic background
Lol “i am not coming to YouTube to only sell new stuff” hahahaha
I'm loving these jeffee I really love the dark and nude colours though they are more me ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤍🖤🤎
Lisa Eldridge sweetie I'm so sorry. This looks like a Claire's version of her amazing velvet lipsticks. Total ripoff lol.

Soon I can afford it all!  I’m a avid fan from PH! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
🤯🥵🥰
Jeffree posts video  Everyone five seconds later: I was HERE BEFORE HE EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT RELEASING THIS VIDEO!
Yesssss b*sh
Ugh why is it when I don't have the money 😭😭
Kylie calling her lawyer after she watches this
Says in last video he isn’t coming back to sell products...three days later buy my products!!!!
Can’t wait

YASSSS THE 16th IS MY BIRTHDAY... BEST PRESENT EVER 🥳
I'm determined to get a Halloween box this year no matter what!!!
thank God for the magnet, my other ones cap always fell off!!!!
I'm hoping us mobile user are able to get the medium and large boxes this time and the busy traffic doesn't make the drop down arrow not work again
The more money Jeffree makes, the better packaging we get! Love it!!!
That new package looks like a suppository
I would love to have a mystery box!!! But I'm broke
I can feel the circulation in my legs cutting off. It can’t be comfortable sitting like that.
Pooh that red lewk is my favorite
I love your nails omg 😍😍😍
'i DiDnt CoMe BaCk 2 yOuTuBe 2 sELL pRODUCTS!!?!?!?' ok... suree..................
EARLY YAAAAY
It looks like a vibrator
" You are going to gag " 😄 Love jeffreys innuendo  Absolutely priceless 🤩 Such a cool rascal 😎
me waiting for the trap to fall on Jeffree: 👁👄👁
Woooow he really back to sell stuff... Jeezus you have no shame. You’re rich enough, you don’t have to keep doing this
Let’s talk about your allegations
People comparing this level of production to Jaclyn, how? Money has gone into that R&D girl, bye.
Claw because You can’t get out
Omfg its dropping on my birthday!!!! Ik what im getting😆❤
Yikes and I thought life couldn’t get more boring but then I saw those lipsticks
Click here if you are here before an hour of it being posted.
Love the lipstick girl!! I would really love to see a whole line of makeup that is environmentally friendly. Like no plastic packaging and nothing involved is harmful to the environment.
CEO of Melanin
I really hope I can get one of the mystery boxes!
And now I’m hooked !
YAAAAAASSSSSS
He is so rich that he even has a velvet trap bigger than my house...
I love the spooky szn mystery boxes !
I need NAKED BODY in my collection right now. 🖤
14 mins ago? bro thats the earliest youtube alerted me
I love Halloween mystery boxes 📦 😊👍🏽
After payday🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Lol last video he swear he disnt post becayse he had a product comimg yet here we are. FAKE FAKE
It doesn’t look like it would go on super smooth because of the texture. But seeing it just glide easily on the models lips was everything 👄 💄
Omg I want that green one , been looking for that shade forever 😊❤
That is the coolest shit I’ve ever seen, a velvet trap . Iconic setting for a video
To me, a black or rose gold metallic would have appeared more luxurious than a baby pink.
<33
am i the only one who is waiting to see the trap closing-
“One swipe coverage!” *swipes 5-8 times for every shade*
Can we use them on the eyes? As color primer?
If only I could have 0,00001% of his subs 😂😂😂🙈
So far, the only time I ordered something from your company, the concealer package was bumped and the palette wasn’t properly protected.
NGL, the packaging is very Kylie Cosmetic
https://youtu.be/5NUhn6g0qaw ,  This cover is killer Reminds me of Jeffrees world 🌎, love ya jeffree ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Great job Jeffree, everything looks amazing!
sexual immorality is a real thing. Jeffree star displays just that. Jesus is real
I want them but damn I haven't had the money to get even The Gloss yet!
Early!
report bots guys
love the new lipstick !!! so beautiful looking. oooo mystery boxes i neeeeeeed one xx
when your early and all of the comments are bots
Jeeeeesus Christ, that's extreme 😂😂😂
I really really love the colors 😭 sadly I can't afford them since I live in Africa Tunisia and the dollor is like 3 dinars now or something so it's too much for me, but tbh I am so proud of jeffree he keeps on surprising us with amazing makeup with high quality😍😍😍😍
Why is this the top comment?
Omg I am in LOVE with all of the colors.🤩😍
I feel like Jeffree wouldn’t wear half of these colors..
Pay day better come soon
Imma need the new camera guy to stop zooming in and out lol he did it last video too
Love you Jeffree! Congrats on new launch 💕⭐️
Love your nails!! They are on fire!!! You made the choice to pierce your ears again and I must say you’re completely snatched x100000000.
I wish beautylish and his other online retailer sold the mystery boxes! I only buy his stuff off beautylish! I always get my stuff within 48 hours! ❤️🇨🇦
My legs would have feel straight asleep.
This is how many times jeffre mentioned ”beautiful” 👇
Are the toppers from lip ammo going away too? Ive never tried them and i want to.
😭😭 I'm going to miss the lip ammunition so much 😭😭
I love the “making of moment”
Dear Jeffree I loooooove it👍👍👍👍
I’m so happy happy ur back Jeffre ✨ hope you’re doing ok 🤍 stay safe 😷
stop wearing real fur
Do the models get to keep the products they try?
"Let me show you a swatch of all 20" shows the 1 swipe swatch from 15 feet away
Jaclyn Hill lipsticks right now: 👁👄👁
Yaaassss cant wait to try
Jeffree stole the bear trap set from Blackpink...
By my new lipstick vault its only $5000😂
Must have!
You should all the beauty gurus in the trap
Here before the gossip channels release this video 😂🤣
Jeffree is just wearing the cost of my house, like it's nothing.
Getting Lisa Eldridge vibes from this...
Icon😍😍😍😍
Jeffree: Unicorn blood Me: Yaassss Queen!!!   I love that shade, it is beautiful
"He will come back when he will need to sell something" kinda true
I’ve never been this early lmao
The shape of the component isn’t my favorite; it looks a bit like a small KylieSkin-branded vibrator? BUT the lipstick itself is gorgeous, I love the logo all over the length of it.
AYYYYY
tag yourself i'm the echo in the room
Here!!
Ready for my Halloween Box 🎃
He says it’s a one swipe formula yet in all the swatches he did atleast 4 swipes on each one ....😕
Here before the "how can anyone still support Jeffree" comments.
Ahhh hi! Claim ur "Before million ticket"!!!!
pov: you're scrolling through the comments trying to find something that isn't spam, bots, begging for views, or wishing that you live another 100 years sjsksjksksj
Ooof, the velvet texture on the bullet...... Lisa Eldridge is gonna be pissed off at that one!
i want some glittery formulas bitchhh😭
did i just gagged seeing you on that velvet trap? absolutely ly 💗
Love your vibe, I love your products. Please always stay true, and always be you 💕
Hey thanks for getting a better camera guy this time. 😊 can’t wait for this release!  Sincerely, your fans that HATED the constant zooming in and out.
How he gonna sit that way for the whole vid my ruined kneecaps could NEVER
When you put on a stunning lip but forget it’s 2020 and have to put a mask over it🥺😂
Anyone know the name of the song?
Cremated and orgy are definitely gonna be in the mega mystery box
I thought you said you didn't come back just to sell a product..? Girl... one video is not "coming back." You're just here to sell a product.
Omg earliest ive been
They are beautiful! You Killed it once again, so so pretty 😍 💗 💖 🔥
Jeffree looks soooooo good in pink
YAS! FABULOUS!😍
Oh my God YESS THIS PACKAGING IS SO MUCH BETTER
The wOoo at 9:47 fell as flat as my reaction to this launch
Lots of beautiful colors... you've really outdone yourself Jeffree!!! Good job.... Love it!!!
Does anyone else think it looks like a mini vibrator 🤣
Beautiful
OMFG I HAVE LITERALLY DIED THEM LIPSTICKS JEFFREE!!! KILLED IT AGAIN 😭😍♥️🤯🔥🌈🍒 LOVE YOU XXXXX PS HALLOWEEN MYSTERY BOX YESSSSSSSSSSS 🙌🎃🙌
I love the new unicartan
Ok but that red one is absolutely everything.
Hi, how are ya👀
I genuinely do not care what anyone thinks, jeffree really has done a lot for the community since he started getting BIG in 2016... even before that in his previous light of fame he was a champion for all of us.... I will always support him. No one is perfect, recognize the unity of all beings, jeffree is a human being too.
Liked the video before even watching it. Lol
Hey constructive criticism here, you should get a lavalier microphone. Helps with the echoing. Hope this helps! 💓
Can you also ship to Italy? Pls!🙏🏻🥺
Holy shit. That monogram
Yassss!! I can’t wait!
Ddu ddu ddu ddu
I'm not sure if I should get the Halloween mystery box or the Holiday one. Will be missing the lip ammunition
I want them all 😫🥰 beautiful
I still love you girl
It is so wonderful to see you doing videos in your space. Looking wonderful.
Man, everyone in the comments annoying PERIOD 😂
Nice very pretty ... Love the set up you in :)...0wosh I had the $$to buy em... ❤️❤️ Cute packaging!!!
Jeffree is a literal velvet thirst trap.
Jeffree star is becoming the new jacklyn Hill. Only comes to sell a product
DDDD?
I'm on a no-buy for lipsticks, because I have to wear a mask at work and everywhere,,I really want to try these though 🤔 btw is that a real bear trap, or greenscreen? Wow! 👏 😮
Yo his sets wre getting better and better
Cant wait!!!! I need the reds and browns for fall 🥰
Dont think ive ever been this early x
Only Jeffree would be in crushed velvet. I love the hot pink and soft pink 💗
I’m so excited!!!!!!!!!!!!
you should do an ASMR unboxing of all the new mystery boxes!
Can't wait
Hi ! I need everything
Jeffree Yesterday: Everyone says I only come on YT when I have new product, that's not true!!   Literally the next day: We have a new product!!🙃🙃🙃
Taylor Swift 👁👄👁 “The Perfect Red”
I'm READYYYYY
no one:  not even air.  jeff in a huge vevet trap
A queen and look at those NAILS!!
*The velvet trap is literally the most Jeffree star thing i ever seen*
good luck to anyone trying to find comments that are not bots 😬👍
Blackpink?
What I love most about this brand is that Jeffree is a makeup snob so he knows a good product and delivers that experience to his customers at a fair price.
OMGGG
Fucking magnet!!! Yes. Love that
Cool, can't wait.
Told u he only put out a YouTube video and then he put out a new makeup product. Same on u jeffry
Weirdest set yet I think. The lipstick looks like the colourpop ones with the stars on them
👀  👄
Yep came back for money..
I help to Wonder... Is that trap a actual prop or edited🤔 .. .. Must be real bc it ecos like crazy 😂 .. .. My quick ass commenting for the 3rd time in the first 9minutes 😂😂
Jeffree baby, you are gorgeous love.
The only one who is still able to launch stuff during COVID is Jeffree!
The rat in the trap:
Just saying the first look of that lipstick I legit thought it was the veins of a penis. Sorry.... lol and then he showed the close up.... ooooooooo it’s JS star got it! 🤣
The bot comments are too cover the bad ones. Jeffree stop hiding shit.
If it vibrated it could be a 2 and 1 use lipstick and a vibrater lol.
Jeffrey should be recreating a barbie makeup tutorial!!!!!!!
Ya’ll can hate on Jeffree but we can all agree that he makes bomb products ❤️🎉
Dammmmnnn I'm in the first 1k comments 🤣
Lmao how does he sit like that through the entire video
Claim your spot as “being early” (before a million views)
🤩🤩
Ok. Going to comment as I watch so I have live level responses. First off love the new boxing. Way easier on my long bitch nails
Why’s he so extra 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Literally just made a video seeming like he wanted to catch up with his subs, saying not just before a launch and lol what do ya know, another launch 🤣
I so wish i was on JS PR
oooooooow, she's pigmented!!! :) x
so its basically Lisa Eldridge`s invention just Jeffree Star edition
annnnnnnnd heres the real reason he came back a few days ago oh hai jacqulyn nice to see you again oh wait its jeffree
That's one hell of a set up! Only Jeffree would do such a thing.
MY BIRTHDAY IS THE 16TH
Omg Celebrity Skin & Naked Body are CALLING MY NAME! 😍😍😍
Who is Early I am 😃😃😃😃
Okay, wasnt a fan of the original lip amo packaging it made me feel like it was for a little kid but this one right here is to die for!
I love how he says "only one swipe" but never gives us a close up of a one swipe swatch
Unphased should've been named keef
We’re you inspired by Lady Gaga’s stupid love single album cover?
Welcome To The Velvet Room!
Okay J cute
I told u he had a launch
But we are all wearing masks...?
Okay gurl 🤧💖🤣
Imagine him making a full velvety palette
Yaaaass #pinkmamma
Yaaasssss
These are so so beautiful omg 😍
What is that song that is playing when they are showing behind the scenes on the set?
Ok blackpink dududududu knock off. Worrrkkk!!
The trap reminds me of the scene in Kill this Love from Blackpink
Amazing, but I must admit that if it was not for Kirsty Meaken of NaioNails, I would never have started watching Jeffrey . Absolutely beautiful!!
Idk, $25 is fine, but $60 and $100 for the other two boxes? I wouldn't really call that affordable. What about the price of taxes and shipping on top of that too?
So are we just gonna forget about the drama?
Wooo you always go ❤️
I NEED GARGOYLE AGAIN PLEAAASE
Wow..amazing CONGRATULATIONS
I love behind the scenes stuff
I need your nails and also rip to my wallet
Hola
🙂
He’s so extra. I love it.
Well this was boring. 🥱🥱🥱
GAGGED
Stunning as always...thank you Jeffree...knock out once again!!!
Omg I'm so early lol ❤️
Are the old lipstick ammo being discontinued?
Those nails are a trap ufff beautiful 😍
Didn’t you just say you wouldn’t do thi- nvm 💀
I had a feeling it was lipstick
Jeffree can you fetch your mystery box’s to Beautybay PLEASE
Liking this in the first 12 minutes.
For every one who can pull of a black lip yessss queens ❤️
I'm early but I don't know what to say ... I'll come back later

I'm *livin'* for Jeffree's outfit
Why is this video blurry

What song is he playing when he starts showing his behind the scenes photo shoot

They look amazing jeffery but can we talk about that red wig!!
Now this is next level

Unpopular opinion: I miss the reveal videos that were up close with a simple back drop. With close ups to swatches as he did them. idk tho.
I love it!
My God, this comment section is crap
The pink boot 😍🔥
why tf is Jeffree sitting in a metal shark mouth 😂💀

How Jeffree protects his heart from the haters
COVID really screwed us with this launch. Damn masks 🙄
🥰🥰🥰🥰
So beautiful 🥺😍
Ahhh!!! Yaassss, Jefree Lynn!
I can't believe you're getting rid of the lip ammo formula!
The Collection is so gorgeous. I love how you included behind the scenes in the videos every other person I watch doesn't do that. I appreciate that.  I've been meaning to Ask where do you get your wigs from they are stunning.
Use me as “I’m not proud to be here but at least we’re here together” button
I’d like to see comparisons between his new lipsticks formula and PMG and mademoiselle by Fenty beauty...🤩
Yassssss Mamas👏👏👏👏💅
I love the fact that jeffree goes either extra or nothing😍😍😂😂

For the last time people Jefree doesn’t address drama unless its to clear his name before releasing products
❤❤❤❤❤
Can’t deal with that giant bear trap. So sickening
only people who didn’t come from tiktok can like:
i was wondering why the lip ammo has been gone off the website for a while
Yes 🥰😍
Why do you need drama to sell a product? Can’t you sell products without having drama?
imagine Finding My comment Leave a Like if u did.
Kinda looks like Kylie cosmetics
Why isn't anyone wearing mask properly..
Leave it to Jeffree to kill it with the decor
OH thats why you just posted a new video a few days ago.......
No one:  Not even Jeff:  Random comments: “DonT lIe WHOs bEen a FAn oF Jeff BEforE 2020”  Read channel name.
The amount of spam in this comment section is ASTRONOMICAL

Not haters being so obsessed they have notifs on just to dislike and leave a hate comment 😭

😍💄💖💕💓
Yeeaaaah....No thank you lol.
The set  😍😍
okay but likeeeeeee why isn't he addressing the whole shane situation. I need apologies luv.
Our Great Country has faced so many trying times this year the corona pandemic, Economic crisis, literally lost our jobs over night, well the ones that aren’t essential 😔 I grew up in an abusive home, and still managed to better myself with a college degree, I even shocked myself because I was told I couldn’t never do it. I moved to N.C for a better life, 8 years ago because living in PA was expensive. In my field in N.C my four year degree at Temple University as a social worker I was only making fourteen dollars an hour to take care of me and my 2 children.  Ppl say where is their father well ask yourself that. Not all children are blessed to have a father. So as a mother I tried my best. Not being able to make ends meet on fourteen dollars an hour I became a server and I was making decent money to support my family no welfare nothing!!! Since the pandemic my job is closed going back to my social work is not an option for me my son is autistic and needs me to be there with him. Like many Americans I AM facing a crisis little food trying to keep my kids safe durning this time seems impossible I’m ashamed to ask but as a mother I will do whatever it takes to keep them safe if you can help my cash app is $AngelaTiffanyRogers Thank you.
I like how he never adresses the drama and only adresses it when he is gonna release something like get outta here
The amount of bots in the comments is unreal

Who else was thinking that trap would close? I was scared for Jeffree. It looked so real!
It’s funny he thinks he has fans
