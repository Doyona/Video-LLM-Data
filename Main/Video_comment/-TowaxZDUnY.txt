💸
Should have used steel and not iron
No wonder it sunk i would not dare get in that not a chance its like a big toilet roll feel sorry for the familys
People didnt get into titan because of stockton rush they got in because of ph nargeolet and they figured with him in the sub with them they had nothing ro fear because he was a expert on subs and the titanic and he wouldnt get in titan if it was dangerous
I just watched the the new netflix and discovery docs on the titan sub and all i can say is im shocked and its so much worse than we all thought in one clip you see stockton diving the titan by hi self to 4000 meters and you can hear the carbon fiber hull cracking and making loud popping noises even stockton looked scared when he heard it and he said nothing about it to anyone and still took passengers in it
$250,000 ?!?!?!?!?! where they think they going? the moon? 😂💀
Imagine $250,000 ticket & taking risk to see old ship
"safety is total waste of time."  Me: WTF...
A dangerous nutcase that led those poor people to their deaths. You can't just flippantly "cut corners" or whatever in a very clearcut situation such as that.  It's safety or death- no in-between.
Carbon fiber is probably the weakest that you can use on a submarine it's not stronger as Steel. As soon as he said it's made out of carbon fiber that should have been a red flag but what happens when you have tons of money you don't really care apparently
There is a huge lesson in life here. The most confident people are usually the most dumb.
-10000 aura
it is scary in the bottom of the alantic ocean because it is dark
Underwater pressure is very high. How can OceanGate take it so lightly
This hack journalist trying to save face
Plexi glass for the port hole….. wtf was he thinking?
I'm convinced Nargeolet had a death wish, otherwise I cannot fathom it.
I dont care what ever you say Am never going into ocean its Livings Kingdom Not Mine i learned that the hardway 2018 i was Bitten by a bull shark i survived somehow Because i kept Kicking on its Eyes and just fighting for my life it was a long 30 minutes until Rescue i still thank god to this day that am still alive Now i limp everytime But i atleast have Life in me
Obviously carbon fiber is not stronger
This is a good example to not trust somebody just because they have the credentials
"At some point, safety just is pure waste." -- Stockton Rush.  His final passengers would likely disagree.
Yikes. I can't imagine floating underwater in the dark. My worst fear lol 👀
2:18 the reporter probably feared for his life right there and then 😩
The CEO collaborated with Boeing... yeah  if that's not major red flag I don't know what is...
The sub is what iPhone is to blackberry... 2 seconds later, "I got the handles from camper world" this guy was literally delusional.
We can only gasp at the sheer power of the ocean😳😳
Nature isn't cruel or kind.. It has it's own laws.. That's all.. And we know them.. Still at times behave as if we can violate them😢
Sad. R.I.P.😢
The entire team died
I would’ve took one look at that small thing and said HELL NAH I’ll see you when you come back up!
Rush literally said "your thrusters can fail, your lights can fail, but you'll still be fine". Bud, if your thrusters fail you are still stuck 3000m under the ocean. You're not "fine". This guy is delusional.
Rip them 🙏🏻 🪦
Or dead 🥺😢☹️
That was a dead coffin from the beginning
I can't imagine a more pointless activity than going to see the Titanic.
This was an experiment to him. Fr fr. He was throwing dice with their lives.   Rest in peace to the innocent people lost 💔
It is truly a tragedy. Tragic because more billionaires weren't on this half-assed hardware store submersible.
some people have more money than brains. Especially to see something you can see from your living room lmfao.
That's exactly why the military does not use touch screen controls.
I keep thinking that Stockton felt if he did die, he would go down in the history books forever. He was so arrogant.
"Does that not raise eyebrows in the industry?"  "Oh yeah ...I'm an outlier."
Can't believe it's been a year
So many times in this i said to myself "famous last words"
"At some point, safety just is pure waste. I mean, if you just want to be safe, don't get out of bed. Don't get in your car. Don't do anything." - Stockton Rush  Ironic.
Very sad story. It always amazing me when certain breeds of people think they can just go take on the craziest of endeavors, and expect everything to go smoothly. What amazes me even more, is when it DOES all go smoothly according to plans. What did they say, he successfully did it 12 times or so? That’s pretty cool.
2024 anyone?
all to have a look at a famous shipwreck?  thats the real tragedy of it...
WTH HOW IS IT A YEAR AGO LIKE WHAAAAT
It’s crazy how this situation was just wiped under the rug.  It was only talked about for a week
Sad what happen to OceanGate like that, but way worse! 😮
Not an engineer's famous words: "There are a lot of rules out there that didn't make engineering sense to me."
'don't get out of bed, don't get in your car, don't do anything' - Yeah no that's not how it works if you wanna go somewhere like the fking deep sea  This guy proves, that no previous achivement and status will help you, if you are an ignorant brick
“ We run the hole thing with this games thingy”💀OH HELL NAW💀💀!
... :  Why we should hire you?  ... : I warned Titan sub for their demise.
That submarine was nonsense
Ignoring relations and rules cause him and those people there life's 😔😔😔😔
Wow
Its been a year
Clearly stating that safety is a waste of time. He went so delusional and careless thinking that he was assembling a bicycle rather than a Sub that will go down to extreme pressure!!! He actually got an adrenaline rush with thinking about the box by breaking rules more than anything!!!!!
Can we please stop bringing up the controller as a negative... every expert out there has dismissed it because game controllers are used to control a ton of things now a days - even combat drones. There was a ton wrong with the Titan submersible, but the controller wasn't one of them.
Tht plexiglass window said not today
Just compare this submersible to the one used by James Cameron. It's a rat vs lion difference.
ПОЙМАТЬ ТЕХ КТО СТРОИЛ ЭТО КОРЫТО! И СУДИТЬ ИХ разбойников!!!!, ради бабла ПРЕНЕБРЕГАЮТ безопасностью!!!!ПОМАТЬ и НАКОЛ ПОСАДИТЬ!!!!
All these "safety" mechanisms... Where did they go when the situation actually presented itself?
Stockton Rush was clearly a narcissist
Natural selection
The guy chose money over human lives he was just a selfish person and very stupid you need to test things all the time this is how things work he just was a selfish pice of crap I feel really bad for the families that had to go through all of this loosening a loved one is a painful thing but your husband and son I really feel bad for the families chose smarts over money because if your smart you can make money the guy that made the Titan just was a greedy person and he deserved to go out like that
The families should be refunded the $250 thousand dollars.
I don’t mean to be disrespectful to the people that passed away was tragic, but really this was so simple and so basic in world  that would be considered by many to be a very hostile environment with billions of tons of pressure it was clearly an accident waiting to happen. My deepest condolences to all of those who have lost their lives this submarine. However, the designers attitude remains very much of a teenager being rather so so about something that is very important. Safety clearly wasn’t a priority. P.s  This shows you that bull baffles brains, and as a consequence of that people died.😮😮😮
Uh yeh the engineer and captain  of the titanic said “God himself couldn’t sink this ship”, and look what happened 😂😂😂
That scary
And this is just a snapshot of how canadians make our economic decisions
Off the shelf parts and Mcgyvering the parts 💀
My eyebrows were lifted the whole time because of the insanity of this whole thing 😲😧
Might as well have used an Atari Game Console Controller, and a inner tube
Bro made a submarine out of bubble gum and tape
I still can’t believe they did this 🫠
He thought safety is a waste  and paid big price. But unfortunately he killed 4 other innocent people with his recklessness
Mf said carbon fiber is better than titanium
You Know Its a Bad Idea if the controls are made for a Gamer
Cheapskate and narcissit he did this to himself
Companies that don't have safety as a first priority have expensiveness as their top priority. As for safety, its not a second priority, they just don't have safety as a priority.
Rip
فبای الا ربکما تکذبان
another guy who thought common sense and logic is just someone's opinion
Did she voice the ice man documentary
They needed some O’hare Air-
Left within first 5 secs
This did not age well.
How could you glorify Rush? The reporter should be ashamed  of himself
BOOM
Combining three different materials to build the " Ocean Gate " submarine. All three either contract or expand. Under that much pressure deep below the surface.. all it took was a single weak spot in a joint/seem.. for it too implode.
Remember, we cannot die and they did not die.They are spirit not The body
Umm how come I don’t see any comments regarding the dang video game controller used for the steering wheel ?!???!!?! I was waiting for him to say I’m just joking!
E morto molto per stare un po' con te
Speriamo None faccia morire altri
Bro Turned Into Human Ketchup
Leave titanic alone she's in very bad shape and should be left to decay in peace without people paying money to go down and see her. R.I.P. to all those people who sadly perished on that freezing april night. May they sail on the ship of dreams in heaven.
A video game controller no wonder it killed him
I'M NO ENGINEER BUT ANYONE CAN SEE THIS DESIGN COULD NEVER WITHSTAND THOSE DEPTHS ESPECIALLY FROM CARBON FIBER!!
A damn xbox controller is crazy😂😂😂😂😂
Bros grinding on mincraft getting diamond ore 😂
CBS News, You're awesome! Let's be friends and play together!
Why would anyone in their right mind agree to be locked into a tiny compartment with 4 other human beings and be sent 6 miles under the ocean? Play stupid games…
You would think with 250000 USD tickets, he would eventually upgrade his diving trashcan.
Eerily, they made all the mistakes that those onboard the Titanic did.  Overconfidence in their vessel,  Breaking well regulated rules, rules exist for a reason  Ignoring the warning signs
"If you want to be safe, don´t go out of bed, don´t get in your car" That´s exactly the kind of person you should never trust with your life!
We do not mounn the death of Rush, why?
The titanic took 5 more lives
There's places on this Earth that people are just not supposed to go.The highest mountains in the deepest seand a jealous man's bedroom
More $$$ but no brainer, now all are mush
bro set all those passengers up💀💀
" Stifle innovation " or in other words " it's going to cost too much of our huge profits"
' In 2018, OceanGate's director of marine operations, David Lochridge, composed a report documenting safety concerns he had about Titan. In court documents, Lochridge said that he had urged the company to have Titan assessed and certified by an agency, but OceanGate had declined to do so, citing an unwillingness to pay.
1:30 + I mean what could go wrong using clearly unsuitable cheap parts/materials but still charging $250,000 a trip. Amazed that anyone would have risked their lives on such a thing.
1:54 ¨This is to other submersibles, what the iphone was to the black earth¨   Well, it was crap, so yes it was exactly like apple . . .   😂🤣😅
Very tragic failure bless you 5
so sad for the billionaire
I wish my wife would of went.
I thought the game controller thing was a joke?
Thank god Ronaldo rejected the offer.
yea sure lets use carbon bcs we are special and unique xd
'Safety is just a pure waste.' ☠️  Over confidence arrogance makes you careless
“Safety is a waste” - last words before death
not the desktop wallpaper on the submarine 😭
The guy was so smart he was dumb
SR said that the pressure would compress the acrylic window 3/4 inches inward. It's possible that they were gathered looking thru the window when the window couldn't take the pressure anymore and popped inward striking everyone in its path. In the first moments after the acrylic popping inward like popping the cork from a champagne bottle, there is no water in its trajectory except the passengers, and it probably went thru them like a missile
There's also the simple fact that the TITAN most likely reached its operational lifespan, and just like planes, should have been retired. I'm sure if they did NDT they would have found many stress fractures in the hull, too bad they fired the safety guy...
Iam not heartless but i have no sympathy,its a grave.stocktons kids have a console but no handset absolute joke
from hubris to debris...
I still believe in Ocean Gate but I think the submersible is only good ONE TIME
“The unthinkable became all too real” is one of the most propaganda filled statements I’ve ever heard. EVERYONE knew this was the fate.
We are so lucky to have even been alive, that to risk the one life you have on a fool-hardy adventure for nothing more than thrill-seeking and social media posting is the epitome of Darwin's Natural Selection at work
That test run... scrub... was sooooo staged smh
Oh my God......how awful!!!!!
It was June
bull, where is the videos of the casualties being locked in,in the video.as there was previous occassions more footage.why so little info?
Wow!!
carbon fiber stonger than titanium teah right!!!!!!!
They need to hire a physics guy
Same thing when you have a different baby father they don't got a job they won't work your finances stability might be a problem😂
Obviously wasnt designed to engineers requirements for multiple trips was  more for most profit
I think the most implosion happened because of someone became desperate to be heard or found after so long that they  keep  banging the submarine so they can be heard and found till they made the submarine so weak that it imploded! That’s why they kept hearing sounds and no sounds afterwards!
He put his life into technology hands especially with only one button and a controller
Nice Happy to have at cheap sub = cemetery
Rich people's problems. Next!
Pushing the boundaries of stupidity.
If you want to make a car , or motorcycle out of recycled parts , that’s one thing , but making a sub that goes thousands of feet under water , let’s use quality materials
NASA says they did not work with Rush
Looking forward to the Netflix documentary
A tragic demise indeed ..
Thanks, Clown Core
Instant burley
Rush was a classic narcissist
I genuinely believe Stockton was a good guy. Rest in peace dude
3:16 good thing that was the only thing that failed
The game controller really isn't that bad but there are some janky decisions made here. I'm not getting in a sub that has lights purchased from camper world. Dude is like bragging about how janky his sub is. I guess when it came down to it their deaths were quick.
This guy and his ego got himself killed and what’s worst is that he took crew members to death with him as well. RIP to the crew members
If something seems too good to be true, often times it is
Guys, carbon fibre is great
When your ego gets you in waaay over your head
The world mourned?!?! Not me! Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Darwin 2023 award for all of them smh!
Should've been titled "Inside Stupidity"
PSA: Anyone who compares their product to the iphone of their industry: RUN.
You know, as sad as it is people lost their lives, people thought the wright brothers were crazy too when they were trying to fly.  Innovation often comes with scrutiny.  Being too cocky was this guys problem, he thought he knew it all and he should of taken advice from other experts.
The titanic is sunk and still taking life’s.. don’t go near the titanic it’s cursed
Imagine paying $250k to pass 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
“I think I can do this just as safely by breaking the rules” 🤔
Arrogance kills! That's all I have to say!
I will never understand how some people dare to put their lives on the line and step onboard such vessels and go down to such depths! I'm too much of a scaredy cat to do so myself!
It's like when u get old u start to lose your mind , you not thinking
That man ignored cracking carbon fiber. So sad 😢
“The risk of dying gives meaning to living” Gibran writes similarly in his book, The Prophet, about how our fear of death prevents us from truly experiencing life. There is such a thing as stupidity but that can happen in fear as well, not just fearlessness. I personally think Stockton Rush could have been smarter but without adventurers like him the world would be a dull place.
GO SAVE THEM NOW!!! THEY R STILL STUCK !!! PLS !!!!!
250,000 dollars to commit suicide…..fools.
Fukin ads are depressing every 20 fukin seconds on every fukin video
You guys need to leave the Titanic alone it's been over 100 years. Stop trying to find stuff that's deep down in the water.
Arrogance played in that disaster
So because he built planes that qualified him to build subs?  What kind of logic is that? Those are 2 completely diff things!!
Um wow?
Stockton: If you want to play it safe then stay in bed and don't even bother to get in your car.  Look who's laughing now. I am still alive and you are dead. All that money couldn't buy you brains or common sense.
I still cant get over the video game controller...its just crazy
All submersibles have to have an emergency balloon, by not having it means it's gross negligence.
Such a preventable tragedy!   Stockton Rush just wouldn't listen to anyone!!
Stockton said, there was a lot of engineering rules that didn't make sense to me. That should be enough to understand what his mindset was like
Whole thing is BS.
Imaging paying quarter a Mill to sign your death contract!
Yes, you can _"break the rules"_ of material science and physics ---- and also _lose your life._
One plus one equals Rush
Stockin rush shouldn’t be glorified this very misleading he is the reason those people are no longer alive
2:36 famous last words
nah nasa didnt this is crap
⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️
Epstien list. Good chance
LOONYS
"I can do this just as safely by breaking the rules"  Once he said that I was gonna run 😢😢😢😢
A Life without risk is too boring and a life too risky can be cut short.   I personally chose the riskier path and got humbled many times but I believe my life has been more enjoyable than the lives of people I witnessed just idling around in safety all the time.
250k a ticket?? And they still died?? Moral: money doesn't equal quality 👌🏾
It runs on an aftermarket Xbox controller? Wow.
The world do not mourn the death of rush
So he didn't care about safety that makes a lot of sense now sorry y'all
So if the whole point was to go see the Titanic and they couldn't see the Titanic do they get their money back?
Did he have a safety maintenance expert monitoring the submarine before it goes in the water every single time?
This man got duped by Rush😢
37.5 times now.
I love the ocean and being a modern explorer is wonderful. But safety must come first. Sad situation here. God bless everyone of those people!
That's false news because if carbon fiber was that strong it wouldn't imploded
At about 7:00 in the vid, you can tell it's very shoddy designed. There is bad seams behind the guy on his upper right. Light is hitting it.
I agree about when he says that everything is dangerous, well . . . driving a car in today's society have a 3% of fatality, sky diving  1%, going on on a walk 0.7%, etc, but that submersible was more like 80% +
here because of dont tell comedy.
i never get on it
if you think that way that you have to break the law to try some new things he can do it but  not risking another people's life and charging cash too
'Safety is a waste'?. You cannot fool nature
Sad and tearful😢
"Join me in my watery grave"
It’s the game controller for me🫢, it shows how serious this man was taking it. Not very seriously at all. That should have been a flag for everyone involved.
Bad things happen when you disrespect the dead and turn a mass graveyard into a tourist attraction for the wealthy. Bet they’re dumb enough to try this again in a few years.
Oh Americans! They claim to know everything until reality slaps them in the face…
Damn what a way to go 💥I’m very surprised they all got in that Tin can to begin with . But had mr rush not cut corners they would sure have something to talk about . Must feel weird that far down in the ocean
Well, he got what he paid for🤷🏾‍♀️
I defended Rush purely for the reason that this cannot be made out to be a precedent and reason for not trying out that design for a sub in the future, and thereby stunt the development of sub technology. The design for the sub in theory, imo, is sound. Stockton Rush's actions on the other hand, how he operated and tempted fate, in his continuing on with the mission(for lack of a better word) in the face of clear failures of major systems was VERY irresponsible. I defended him as a researcher, not as a business man.
Well if you think like that then i'm not surprise 7:09. Even tho its surprising to hear the man in charge saying those words before going down. As a passenger i would abort.
I don't understand why would you go down there several times to see the wreckage ? how more exciting can it get ?
Why would you implement the “3 strikes rule?!” Should be 1 strike and dive is canceled like airplanes because it’s life or death situation.
if I ever wanted to see the wreckage of the Titanic, I'll go to the local library and go to The National Geographic section.
Arrogance of humans will never die ,life is precious
Titanic's builders: This ship is virtually unsinkable. Stockton Rush: At some point, safety is a waste.  Sentences said before terrible tragedies. RIP to everyone lost on the Titanic and everyone that was lost on the Titan. 🙏
Imagine paying 6 figures for a ticket to then be crushed into oblivion. This is all on Stockton Rush.
This is not a tragedy or disaster,   This is a man running an extremely dangerous operation without proper knowledge or safety in mind.  I’d call this a stunt and as with all stunts come risk.   All those who went, assumed that risk and put their lives in the hands of an unqualified egomaniac who was also ignorant to the forces opposing him.
That sub captain is the biggest goof so far of the 2020s.
It’s not the Titanic it’s the Olympic
Just by looking at the size of  Ocean Gate makes me claustrophobic.
Things you cannot touch "stars and titanic wreck" 😢
Playing with your life, cost yourl ife 9 out of 10 times..
Some things in life you just don't do and this was very life risking ......may God surround them with nothing but peace.
Jesus, they weren't even on drugs.
he wasnt captain kirk.. he was more like forrest gump..
Many think the sinking was an accident, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.
When are humans gonna learn, the ocean is no joke
They doing bag pack to get death😳
hahaha mrbeast didn't want to die by just an invite to this
My heart goes out to the young man,I'm So sorry ur own father didn't take his son life seriously (RIP)
His problem was that he didn’t want to be the “passenger” of his life and that to him, the “ocean [was] the universe.” When it comes down to it, we are not in control.. God is. And when it comes down to it.. heaven is the universe, not the waters.
this is a real tragedy but it can happen because they didn't want the submarine to break either, but there was a risk written by God that they would die in the submarine! I also felt very sorry for that boy who did not want to go with his father. Condolences to the families, may God have mercy on those victims😢😢😢
Such a shame that someone’s Ego destroys people
Too many overconfident fools on this mission and that is why it failed.
Y’all are slow 🙄 why would y’all send them in That
gg
Didn't even watch the video considering you can't even get the name of the sub right 😂😂 It's the Titan!!! Not titanic!!
👍
Rip

I cant belive it😢😢😢😢😂💔💔💔💔💀💀
Quarter million to go down there! Hell no !!!

Jajajajajajajajajaja 😂😂😂😂😂
That was a. LIE!!! NASA did not serve as a consultant!

"It would be safer if I broke the rules" June 2023: :)
Man, that CBS interviewer is flamin'.  I'd Rather have Dan.
Do you know how easy it would for 3 billionaires plus 2, to have a larger submarine waiting for them, they exit the “ Mini-sub” , then send it on its way remotely to the bottom of the ocean ? No more billionaires, no more “Jeffrey Epstein “ sexual Fantasy Island accusations. “ They all drowned in a “ Yellow submarine, a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine.  They all drowned in a yellow submarine. Come on , sing it with me.
we should send joe biden, kamala harris, and aoc in the other sub
He did design subs, his credentials were in the sky. Also industrial psychopath.
Hold on
You ready to leave now
How many people with you
Where you at. You read this. I can get you.
They try to use a PlayStation 5 controller to control it
The titanic never sank they switch the sign
I wonder if breaking the rules was worth his life and of 4 others.
So I have one Mystery, did one of the passenger just destroyed the controller, or, the controller just broke
controller disconnected
S not the titanic s a other ship they changed the names
It's ironic that the Titan was said to be indestructible, or at least strong, and it imploded. The Titanic was said to be unsinkable, and it sunk. It is truly sad how those people died though and I hope that their families are okay
Also. These people paid a lot of money for a vacation, not a trip to their grave.

Huh, I wonder who thought it would be a good idea to name a submersible** to a ship which brutally sank.
wonder who tf decided to call a tiny thing "titan" they should just build a heavy reinforced nuclear sub if anyone ever decides to explore the titanic though, that kind f sub would probably take years to build and take most likely trillions of dollars
Just like the Titanic disaster, this disaster could have been prevented if the Oceangate CEO Stockton Rush didn't ignore safety warnings. This submersible was cheaply made and used end-of-life carbon fiber. Also, it wasn't certified
Nice a comedy
@ 1:13...NOT this IS Stocton Rush, but WAS.
Is so sad the titanic strikes again once more
Lol dying on the titanic in 2023
I do not have any sympathy for any of the passengers because it said on the contract *may cause death* and also why would you get in a submerine thats powered by a controller i am sorry but it is there fault for being stupid qnd btw i think that you should just leave the titanic alone the passengers just want to be left alone i dont see why people care about seeing it irl it is literally a boat with lots of bacteria on it  Edit: sorry to the 19 year old who didnt want to go on it
hopefully there in  the new underwater city we don't know about yet🙏
Stockton Rush died for his passion and he deserves praise for his courage. No one is perfect after all.
Titanic was a sad story until I found out black people were not allowed on the ship.
Titan submarine  episodes 😢
Carbon fiber is a great material, but not for building submarines like this one.
Scary 😟
Billionaires are good people - deep down.
Do britinac next!
plain stupid!!! I wonder maybe he had a huge life insurance police, he could be somewhere enjoying its fortune!!! honestly this looks just like a scam!!!
It is nice
What a tight man
No one cares!
Did y’all know that the person of ocean gates that was in the submarine actually has family members from the titanic that died in the ship his wife said that it’s a family curse cause she also had her great great grandparents in first class that died
If you are not afraid for your own safety and think safety is a waste, okay, just don't put other people's lives in danger for money
Mr. Beast was Invited but  he declined
It's a gruesome ending.  Imagine a hundred million ton press crusging the occupants.  Is this risk worth the fleeting moments of a close up view of the wreckage?   Rush had no concept of the need for backup, and redundant backip for all key components.   Instead, he cut corners even in the core electronics, using college kids to design the system.  HIs legacy will be HOw not to design a deep sea vehicle.   He failed  at  every design challenge.
Everyone is talking about the submarine but no one is talking about the titanic respect to the 1,500 who died on titanic
Probs for the titanic it still kills rich people
Omg why would anyone get into that sub?! It's a freaking gaming tube! It's not surprising that things went back but it's so sad that these people lost their lives because of it!
Sub is named Titan. not “Titanic”.
Do they make engineering sense 2 u now?
"There was a millionaire in the submarine."  Guess that's how mr crabs got his money.
Don't trust someone who use xbox controller they didn't even use PS5 controller instead 😞🙄
What are we going to call the implosion disaster?
No matter how smart he was , the sumersible,, look very unsafe , A mexican. Bote 🚣‍♀️ looks more safe, the capitán Explained so well 😱
Controller disconnected
Definitely a sense of irony here being that the Titanic became a tragic legend because of life lost. And these people died in the exact same waters trying to capture some of that tragedy. Very sad this happened, at least they didn’t suffer.
Upon the ocean's ebb and flow, Stockton Rush's hubris did grow, With dreams of fame and innovations bold, To secrets hidden in depths untold.  OceanGate's captain, fervent zeal, A mission planned with ardent appeal, To view Titanic's solemn grace, Prove his hull's worth in this daring chase.  Yet whispers echoed among the crew, Doubts of the engineering's value, The carbon fiber hull, a risky feat, Could it withstand the ocean's heat?  Guided by Nargeolet's experienced hand, They ventured into Neptune's land, To explore the wreck in ocean's sweep, In a submersible designed to leap.  Two billionaires joined the tale, Hamish Harding, Dawood's sail, Suleman, filled with awe and pride, Witnessed his father's dreams collide.  But as they plunged into the deep, Rush pushed the sub twice its descent's speed, The hull groaned, strained by the force, Doubts emerged, but took no course.  Rush's hubris faced its test, The questionable design confessed, For even with plans and expert aid, Nature's wrath cannot be swayed.  The carbon fiber hull, pride's toy, Met a fate it couldn't deploy, As Titan met its fateful plight, A tragic end to their daring flight.  Their memory lingers, a starry light, In every heart, burning bright, Courageous souls who dared to roam, In depths unknown, they found a home.  Let us remember their pursuit with grace, Their desire to leave a lasting trace, To learn and grow, explore and see, With humility and curiosity.  In Neptune's realm, where wonders lie, Respect the ocean, or peril is nigh, For even in our well-planned quest, Nature's might can put us to the test.  Lessons learned, a price well paid, In the depths where Titan laid, May the questionable engineering inspire, A humbled approach and minds afire.
IT IS A BIT LIKE THE CHALLENGER THE HINDENBURGH  THE TETON DAM WTC, THE TITANTIC IT"S SELF, THE DAM THAT CARNIGE BUILT A FEW IN CALE FOR NIA, MAY WATCH THE DAM THING ON THE MISOURI, CLEAR UP NORTH, UP RIVER, ALSO THE ASWAN, THE 3 GOURGES,, AND WHY DO WE BUILD ANYTHING IN FLORIDA ANYWAY AS THEY ARE SURE TO BE JUST LIKE APOLLO 13, OUTSIDE A FEW 100 OTHER THINGS AND TRAIN STORIES, WELL EVER THING SEAMS TO BE GOING QUITE WELL! I KNOW YOU COUGHT ME I DIDN"T BRING UP WWI, OR WWII OR WWIII YAH WHY DON"T WE JUST NUC THE BASS FISHES ANEY WAY"S IT WILL HURRY THINGS ALONG NICELY!!

Lesson of the day, don't go into a submarine that has one only power button and is controlled by a game controller.
I know you shouldn’t speak ill of the dead . But this guy had an ignorant attitude.
funny how bfdi predicted this tragedy
Just waiting for the movie to be released.
This situation was very tragic and sad. But he made it seem like the submersible was very cheap!
Nasa denied them claims
So his own stupidity caused his death-
250,000$  Lol  Store bought cameras. F’n tools Good riddance
Świetny sposób na zniknięcie z życia publicznego, albo z życia w ogóle
bunccha rich entitled ppl died whats the loss this is world news lol
thats so sad😔 it sucks that their controller disconnected😔
Turns out “old white guys” might have been smarter than you a bud?
Blud left had stick drift
The media obsess about wealthy tourists, who drown in the morbid folly of viewing Titanic.  Poor people die in a ship, while fleeing global war, and media do not mention it. https://youtu.be/8jJLDHFriBs
Too many cuts. Stockton couldn’t have been this stupid. So many of these interviews r cut. If James Cameron suddenly moves forward in under water exploration he prob had something to do with it lol
All glued together lol omg
Don’t worry guys, it was a canon event…
Well if I were to choose a way to die this would be it, won't feel a thing, just knock me out first so I don't see it coming......RIP to the victims
Yeah I swapped it out with an Xbox controller
Subways subs don’t implode
Well if Rich People Die I dont Care
You have to be crazy to get in that poorly designed, cheaply made, claustrophobic coffin can.
Epic fail compilation!!
This looked like a suicide mission.
Why would you pay ton of money to sit in tight space with bunch of guys to go see disaster that happened long time ago? What if one of the 5 guys farted?
“An expensive mini sub that can go beyond the norm level of the deep sea?! Sounds complex! How do we control it?”   “Ah yes.. we will use my sons old game controller”   But real talk, I’m not sure how to feel about this, this is both the most interesting but ridiculous thing ever this year, I mean how do you be a smart person who flies your own airplane designs and not be smart to think this through, it’s amazing how they made this thing, but it’s dumb on why they just thought it would work if you push it hard enough, I’m no expert but common sense isn’t rocket Science.
Give it a rest!
To paraphrase Mark Watney from The Martian, when engineers describe things like material properties, they don’t use the word “better”.
There's a simulator on the Playstation store to experience the wreckage of the Titanic in virtual reality.
7:00 this guy is on sum drugs
where are you now? Atlantis.. Under the sea.. under the seaaa E
I just found this out, the movie titanic was released 85 years after the disaster, and the titanic shipwreck was found in 1985, the movie titanic was made 12 years after the discovery, the titanic sank in 1912, and the titanic wreck was discovered 73 years after the titanic disaster, and thomas andrews was born in 1873, the designer of the titanic   Also rest in piece all 5 men, especially the young one, since was terrified and knew something was gonna go wrong 🙏
Alexa, play "Air Supply"
I feel for the young man,the rest where old people.
I,m. GODS. hands,  R.I.P.. 🌏🌎🌍🇳🇱💐💐💐💐💐💐😭😇🥶❤❤❤❤
Rich people done stupid thing and died, so sad much crying..... You know how many normal people are lost at sea every year? You should be ashamed of yourselves if your pay overlords allow it.
i think its in the ocean
just by hering the CEO speeking i wouldn't go with him  , the most dangerous thing is to act like you expert when you nobody
You don’t cheat physics man
The titan submarine you mean? I have no clue what the titanic submarine is.
Who is mourning Rush? It was completely his fault, he knew it wasn't safe because multiple people came out and told him and his excuse basically was "it would get in the way of innovation".
They be playing iron lung irl💀
Serious
"at some point safety is just a waste" famous last words
This incident is truly fake and I made memes that are viral over the internet
This is a prime example of how the government should have been involved from the get-go.  Someone charges folks $250,000 a piece to risk their lives on a controversial mission and its totally UNREGULATED??  So who's paying for the recovery of this imploded craft and remains😒  Not all government control is bad.
Stockton Rush was in a way a Narcissist ! He looked at himself and thought he was right in everything he was doing, even though others knew he was wrong. It was his way or the highway. What he shouldn't have done is risk other peoples lives, even though they had the choice to go or not to go.
man must copy from nature, eggshekk is much better form, carbon fiber can get micro cracks with time...flat surfaces are dangeros..all this stuff can bring disaster.
Logitech: This controller is not recommended for subs.
Did he just compared the iPhone to this.
Anytime a person becomes upset or retaliates when presented with FACTS and TRUTH…. run the other way‼️‼️ ‼️ and the families probably can’t sue because of the contracts everyone signed smh
https://youtu.be/OxpDmI6MZJw 18:21
2:18 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rip to all the victims onboard the sub
i mean they did sign a waiver to the man so
they were asking for that to happend
I’d want state of the art equipment
Ewwww
"to stay safe" dont get out of bed, dont ride in a car, dont fly in an airplane, and dont ride in a pepsi can with a game controller
https://youtube.com/shorts/WAoCA5-wmFM?feature=share
Iron lung live action
Still saving face for OG ... and defending his hubris ... good job CBS.
He was very educated and had zero common sense !! He was a NUT !
Its so sad that this happened
When the movie coming out tho? 🍿
THEM IDIOTS SHOULD OF MADE TO SUBS IN CASE 1 GETS DESTROYED OR GOT MESSED UP
I don't know why they still don't mention it but why in this day and age it is still ridiculous that this ship is still in the depths, isn't it more feasible to remove the rest of the ship and put it in a museum so that everyone can see it, this is more of a business and it could avoid accidents like these...
Almost mrbeast die
Lol nothing was intact except the controller
Hey, how about you guys do a inside story on the tax evasion and payments hunter and his family received for political favors. We dont care about this "look over here and ignore the big story" story.
😭
I’ve always said that going down to see the titanic for a human let a load a submarine has always been dangerous the reason being is because it’s more than 12 thousand feet under water that is something that no human or machine can handle.. yeah I know it’s taken soo many people down in the past without any trouble but it was just about time that the submarine was gonna explode because of the water pressure and then people who are wondering what happened to the 5 people well yeah obviously they died if they didn’t die from the explosion of the submarine than they deffo died cause no human can stand the pressure of water…. It’s a sad tragedy and it’s an eye opener for people to see that it’s best to just let the titanic be as amazing at it is the titanic is in the danger part of the water and as we all know oceans have no end to it
Deep down, billionaires are good 😂
they knew what they was doing, they bought the tickets, i say let them die, ooops
God must be laughing at the men who died on the titanic 111 years after it sank. It is tragic, no doubt, but still.
Does the US Military design its subs like this? HAILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL NO
If a guy said there lights are from camper world on a sub I'm out plus the guy who designed it is off his rocker talking about your thrusters can go and you'll be safe 😂
The fact that mrbeast almost went on this thing
Would you fly on a plane because someone said "we found a new way to attached the wings" 😅😅🤣
A back up of a back up of a black up of a black up and yet all backups failed
Also, If the sub were to get snagged on something, all the flotation devices would be useless.
Who can say that a small water leak didn't form before the sub collapsed? Or the creaking sounds that would have likely occurred. Also, it would not have collapsed the same way metal would. Remember that this is carbon fiber. It would have shredded into seperate strands.  I theories that the collapse could have been more gradual. Carbon fiber is so strong that, water could have noticably leaked in as the fibers were slowly delaminating and deforming right before their eyes.😮
Its too bad he didnt take david pogue down with him coz what a douchbag.
1:47 Ridiculous, the arrogants cost him and others their lives. Something like that should ALWAYS have backup systems.
Most captivating narration ever
I don't feel bad. Stockton Rush was a cocky rich man.
Hahaha those people died for a reason. BECAUSE THERE REATARTED! HAHAHAHA
No disrespect but Why do people spend millions of dollars to go look for trash? They could’ve still been living.
Cameraman finally died this time . Everyone say rip 😭😭
they glued both ends on...
Cant wait for infographic show to make a video on the titan👀
I don’t mean no disrespect, but something is off about the whole situation you’re telling me this guy was and has been in the dealings with airliners. Why didn’t this thing have a black box and why wasn’t there a safety line or tether ,or at least a  mile long bright yellow ribbon tail so in my mind either, they were shot with a torpedo from what ever foreign spy sub or they pirated some artifacts off the titanic and faked there demise,or they went into the situation as it’s said and they are as it is being told who am I to argue
It’s always dangerous to go with someone who thinks they know everything.
The only person I feel for is that guys son… he’s the only one that didn’t understand fully the dangers of the situation.
Guys remember, if you can't stand up in whatever your gonna do don't do it for like 400,000 dollars.. 😭
This story needs to end… a bathtub sub imploded.. we’re still talking about it. Humanity has worse worlds problems than this that can be addressed and worked on if we reshaped our focus for a better humanity
I think we should avoid naming things titan or titanic as it's now been proven to be a curse of death
LOL. If you don't get out of your bed, you will probably die pretty quickly.
The fact that there guts came out there eyes and they got squished to a pancake and people make memes out of it and I still laugh at then I’d crazy💀😭
Rest in peace to those who died on the titanic, and to those on the submarine.. 😢
A cool fact is that it take 0.05 seconds for the brain to feel pain the implosion actually was 0.01 meaning it was truly a event without pain
2:35 "i am definitely not alive" lmao
Stockton Rush is the type of guy that says Trust me bro
Nah that's crazy😂
Rush wore his name well, he rushed the design and took four lives with him!  Nobody uses carbon fiber pressure vessels for deep diving subs for a reason, titanium is common. His pressure vessel was glued materials and even the viewport was rated to a third of the depth they descended!!! His craft was a time coffin waiting to implode.  And it did, quite sad and careless.
The transparent viewport on its forward end, due to its nonstandard and therefore experimental design, was only certified to a depth of 1,300 m (4,300 ft).
God bless them ❤
Running the submersible in floppy looking game control? Dude, that is not innovation. That is just bloody cheap, and you are playing with human lives..
what a meme
Dude that add guy new when his adds were going
0:56 250000 dollar
nuts? yeah.. you're squashed nut
btw why would you even want to see titanic when you can see my movie and picture????????!!!!
Not sure what the rest of you guys think but personally the Titanic or what's left of her should be left alone  . Yes, there are no living survivors from the sinking but there's bound to be family members or ancestors of those who lost their lives. I mean you wouldn't pay £250,000 to go and look around graveyards it's disrespectful as is the same with the Titanic apparently she'll be completely gone in around 30 years so let her be.
Yo my controller died Everyone else on the submarine😮
So basically I've seen the Titanic as close as those people who died might have seen it? It was all on cameras? WTF is the point?
It annoys me when people say the Titanic wreckage is a "grave site" when it is NOT - Those poor souls didn't parash BEFORE it sank - They parashed AFTER - They died because of catastrophic errors - Their deaths was the result of a catastrophic ACCIDENT and like ALL accidents big or small it must be investigated - There are TONS of information we STILL don't know after 110 years later - For example - When a ship is sinking the correct color of an S.O.S flair is YELLOW but instead the color of flairs that was fired by the Titanic was WHITE - That's the reason why no other ships responded to aid the TITANIC - Did you also know that the ship's communications officer who recieved word that there were icebergs in their area but the officer got annoyed and turned OFF communications and went to bed and hours later by the time the lookout officer in the crows nest saw the iceberg it was to late - Its impossible to steer any vessel that size hard to port or starboard to steer clear of an object in less then 30 seconds - Its like stopping a train in under a minute - Not possible - Scientists and actual recorded incident data proves had the Titanic would had hit the iceberg head on - It wouldn't have sanked - But sending a non S.O.S flair is what sealed their fate because according to records other ships saw the flairs and thought nothing of it - My condolences to the families of the lost sub
A controller for a wheel? BRUH
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
first of all all assets in association with the madcap oceangate venture must be seized immediately including any movable assets like any real estate and equipment cars etc. may the ntsb and the fbi as well as the coastguard furnish a final report in this disgraceful affair. rush made every effort to undercut any type of tests and having the carbon fibre sub certified in any way at all, causing great risk to all that went down to the titanic. and was carefully avoiding any type of us scrutiny by claiming deep ocean and territorial immunity and avoiding any regular testing. there was even a joystick steering contraption fit for a games console ! operating not by wire but by a wireless connection inside the vessel. marrying a carbon fibre untested environment as a main cylinder and sticking on two rings directly as it were glued and bonded -on 2 steel rings with screws holding the front assembly and a porthole window certified to no more than 1200 meters, we are told ! there was diy parts and ballast fastened on by simplest means as well as using scrapyard type steelpipe weights. well here you have the recipe for disaster which promptly turned deadly and taking rush with it. question as well is this megalomaniac stupidity,  delusional ??  enter damages and injury lawyers for major cases.
Honestly, they paid to die. To literally go in a submarine that is controlled by a game controller, computer, and a light that he got at camp world. And only 5in of metal surrounding them. Of course they would get crushed. In conclusion, they signed a contract not to sue the company. So they can’t do anything.
are they a belivers in JESUS CHRIST.  THINK ABOUT EVERLASTING LIFE DONT CONFUSED BY THIS PERSHING WORLD.
"They'll put my wife and children in a submarine 💀"
It's exactly why it imploded they didn't put a lot of money into the submarine
He loved the Ocean so much.... the Ocean called him, now he will rest there forever.
Fired someone to provide safety regulations???? Could've prevented what happened RIP those guys 😢😢😢
Damn it's crazy how we always focus on history from the 1800 and maybe 1960s but we don't think about having history today so it blows my mind how now this will be in the history books in the future where was about the Titanic then to Titanic submarine
Rush played with other's lives and ultimately his own
needless to say I’m titanic, she was a submarine nevertheless, calling it quits now baby I’m imploding, crash at the bottom of the ocean baby you’re imploding
In aviation, we contact our airframes division to do non-destructive inspections  (NDI) infrared camera in the composite portion of our fighter aircraft engines after removal. Which the composite serves as the outer bypass duct of the engines; exposed to tremendous amounts of heat and pressure, but nowhere near as this submersible. I wonder, if these men performed such inspections in their submersible’s composite material, which if they didn’t could raise eyebrows to negligent maintenance of their submersible vehicle… hmmm
Titan was made of 2 titanium hemispheres 142 cm diameter Which makes a sphere of radius 0.7 m and the central plastic-reinforced-with-carbon-fibre tube was 2.4m long, also obviously with a diameter of 140 cm SO: Sphere volume is 1.4 m3.     (4/3 πr3) Cylinder volume is 3.7 m3    (πr2 x h) Total 5.1 m3.  Let's call it 5 m3 for rough calculation Boyle’s Law Pressure x volume is constant So pressure at the start x Volume at the start = pressure at the end x volume at the end or in simple to read terms p1 x v1 = p2 x v2 so volume 2 = p1 x v1  divided by p2 15 psi x 5 m3 / 6000 psi = 0.0125 m3.    Which is 12.5 milliliters. a wine glass is 150 ml a tablespoon is 15 ml 🤪🤪. It was as they said - a bit cramped. There was not a lot of space for 5 adults. Even with sandwiches and a Rubic cube and a portapotty
They not even a Pancake no more
That thing was a death trap waiting to happen
So, this thing was destined to fail.
Expensive grave. Now next time. Don't believe anything they say. You say NO.
Im guessing where the titanic sits be like a grave yard to respect all who perished in the titanic disaster and the recent lost of loved ones from the submersible the area  Should be left alone.
Capn' Crunch
Guy was literally a billionaire and couldve use the best materials but chose the unsafe route Wow no common sense.
Tragic
“Carbon Fiber is better than …titanium” is just an ignorant lie.
The sad part in here is the founder and owner of the ocean gate  who died in the sub have a wife who's ancestor died in Titatanic
All 5 of them probably got vaporized due to the extremely high heat produced when the air within the hull got compressed to a very small volume.
He sounds exactly like an Apple engineer and designer 😂😂😂
9:24  Facts 💀💕
Me being a curious person I will never do that js look it up
6:37 - 7:12 what a fool. absolute arrogance
Ig the titanic ghosts have nieghbors now…       Edit:I am so sorry for the families of those guys it was horrible😢
As The RMS Titanic, it was supposed to be “unsinkable” but sank..!! The Almighty never like Arrogance/Arrogant/Proud (The Holy Quran 16:23). ✨✨✨
To be honest, with the headlining thought being “let’s forgo safety because we need to break boundaries and be innovative” tells me it was more about arrogance, then confidence in their submarine… and what confirms it for me is when he says that he wanted to be the “Director of this mission” rather than “just a passenger” I guess it’s hard to see past your own ego when it’s highly inflated
Imagine spending $250,000 just to go to your grave… hah!
6:59 and now the man’s dead… reminds me of the tale of Icarus
I am socking when i knew the news
How do you really trust a Xbox controller that much
This is what happens when you cut corners. My brother told me that one of the engineers at the place in his internship skipped the safety protocols and next thing ya know he was electrocuted and fried to death. There's a reason  for every safety rule out there.
The only thing bigger than the Titanic wreckage is Stockton’s ego…
Air tank probably failed not enough safety relays
So they payed 250 k. Too see Titanic at bottom of the sea 😮 know your at bottom if the sea with the titanic its was hard luck ship 🚢⚓ thousands of people died 😢 hello 👋 should have known better 💯💯🙏🙏
I would've chosen to stay in bed AND still have my $250,000. 😌
His voice sounds like Ben Shapiro
it’s easy to think risking your life is worth it for the ultimate thrill. but we never hear much from the dead about whether the risk was worth it in the end.  RIP to all on board.
Do you know if those binoculars we’re not locked in the cabinet? This would’ve never happened
Digital images of the Titanic on the sea floor are amazing. I'm good.
The lesson: you don't want to hear all the excellent referrals; you want to hear everything from their critics.
"The world mourns-" The world: *WHEEZE*
Outrageous hubris on display alleged?
‘Safety is a waste’ - sums everything up about this man

MH370 still could not find it till now
The most expensive death ticket.
Why the world would they use a Xbox controller as the driving thing
Illuminate community know everything about it
You just searched this because you’re about to rewatch Titanic for the 33th time in your life 👇
Their arrogance far exceeded their intelligence.
God has a purpose of why Mr. Beast rejected the invitation of the trip to Titanic.
F in the chat for them R.I.P
The only reason why it crashed Is because the controller battery’s died

Now his name is Stockton Crushed 😂😂😂
They CLAIMED NASA approved it. NASA has since denied
I would never go on a submarine period no matter how secure it is, and definitely wouldn't if someone had said "safety is a waste." I wish the passengers watched this Sunday morning episode! I think the Titanic curses things too
Cutting corners with cheap materials when 5 ppl bought $250,000/ ticket 🤨
They were certainly industry disruptors, but arrogance ended their demise.
Although this is tragic, using a submarine that uses store bought material doesn’t sound like a safe idea.
1:56 Oh, the  arrogance  of  this man  🙄
“Carbon fiber is better than steel or titanium” said Stockton Rush. That statement alone is idiotic. “Better than”. I’ve worked with carbon fiber, it’s basically a fancier type of fiberglass. Same basic idea. Fibers, or strands of material, held together by epoxy resin or polyester resin. You could say it is lighter than steel, but “better” than steel? In what way?

they kinda deserve it tbh
The Titanic that sank 111 years ago must have had precious cargo. That must be the reason they moved together thinking they would hit the jackpot. Instead the jackpot hit them RIP
Hoom
The rats are leaving the boat (for a reason). Now they are perfectly safe in the place we the sheep have no access to. Those people just went to the elite's Eden (read: somewhere beyond the forbidden 60th parallel). That is why they needed us to believe they ''disappeared'' in an horrific accident. Who in his own right mind would believe that ridiculous narrative? Billionnaires risking their lives and their family members lives in a cheap experimental toy-submarine controlled by  PlayStation joysticks while refusing security  transponders at the same time ?!? All that money gone into going to watch an old wrecked ship? One have to be pretty bold to do that (which is not ''their'' most obvious traits)  andt WE have to be pretty stupid to buy into such a scam.
He's a murderer

So a fast food ordering machine, a game controller, and a single power button.  Not only R.I.P. to the 5 pain passengers, but also including the father and his son.
I dont believe none of it
It was a betrayal people otherwise they would still be here with money and you have to trust the people  back up there but cpuldnt be trusted sadly sad
Take this story with a grain of salt. CBS like ABC NBC CNN are famous for LYING and COVERING UP  the truth. They all have a long history of cover ups and lies?
If you are smart enough to avoid having society having a percentage of your invention relating to profit nor exposure... you will be hated nd targeted...
Cameraman never dies
My DIY project might cost more than Titan sub
those who are making fun of these people dying are sick people.  No one deserves to die like that.

Bingo.
You know what always wins regardless of how smart you and or your team are? Physics & nature  If you want to overcome them,  you have to follow their laws to the smallest of details and then enforce them 100s of times over.
Why does he look and sound like Ben Shapiro?😅😂
What's the point? There aren't even windows on it, might as well just watch video clips of the ship.
I'm not mourning the loss of Rush.
Rush wasn't a shadow of Elon Musk. Just a wannabe.
250k per person? Damn
How come there is no video of them going down ?
Bro played ral life subnautica 💀
Man's lust and greed  for fame and wealth.
I keep hearing that death was 'instantaneous' for the people on the Titan. I'm not so sure about that. It's scary and painful to think about, but I'm guessing there was probably around 30 seconds of pure horror while they were all crushed into each other and drowning. Idk, maybe not
How did he convince billioners to get in to that thing?
How sad. 🫢
Wow how 😔 sad!
That's why you are one in town
Most expensive suicide ever 😂😂😂
May their souls rest in peace,
It's wrong the way he thought 😢
Keyword: AEROSPACE not UNDERWATER airplanes are extremely different to underwater vehicles. Airplanes and other high altitude vehicles have air pulling outwards. Underwater vehicles have water pushing inwards. The design used for planes can't be used underwater
wow, i find his sense of adventure and pioneering spirit inspiring!....good luck my friend! 😊
There's nothing funny at all about this ignorant captain and owner of this POS submarine. The innocent people that died with him trusted him and they all learned the hard way. The remaining owners of this company should be locked up.
Feels like a suicide killing tbh
Selfish and foolish.
They pay so much money just to go down and see the submersible looks so cheap.😬😬😬😠🫤
Most of the things Elon Musk does, from the space program and the especially idiotic alleged "Mars mission", to the idiotic Vegas Loop, are mere efforts to keep inflating the Tesla stock bubble. Extreme investment fraud. That is all it is. The man has not had a single original idea in his entire life and he is anything but a genius engineer.
Not to sound bad ok = everyone have respect for those who have left this world plz. put the responsibility into the makers to find and fix the problem that made the world news.  i think they went down too fast and didn't have the oxygen and others mixed properly to make that quick of a decent.
The whole thing looks & sounds terrifying even without knowing the end it reached, just the CONSTANT galactic pressure on its cylindrical structure 😳
Safety…
you have a back up of a back up of a back up!! NEWS FLASH    them back ups didnt work
I wonder if he built it in his back yard or garage ?
6:58 Famous last words
It surprises me how, not so young, engineers express their opinions in the comments below without reviewing actual data. The act of rendering judgment without reviewing analytical, test, and manufacturing data undermines the credibility of the engineer and the profession as a whole. If that is an attempt to elevate your self-esteem on this tragedy, it is immoral and disgusting.
QUE PASA EN EEUU?!!! XQ DESAPARECEN 800000 NIÑOS POR AÑO Y EL GOBIERNO NO HACE NADA?!!
yeah the one part of this whole desaster is the one making all the bad choices still trusted his own thing enough to go down with it. Its a horrible situation either way but there is a tiny difference when the reason for the failure has also paid the ultimate price instead of being up on land safe and alive stammering about how it all worked before
Using simple tools to get to the depths of the ocean, where gravity gets insanely high and creates unpredictable waves... There’s a reason why humanity has evolved outside the planet, to the moon and now even mars, than inside the ocean. We know more about our solar system than we do of our seas. And just blindly jumping in saying “Oh it’ll work out”, is a clear suicidal attempt... So sad for the families that lost their loved ones
His sub is sound only it needs to be perfected by a inner titanium reinforced with aluminum with an otter carbon fiber super thick. RIP to all lost.
Now it is clear why it designed so simply.😢
they killed them to cover other scams at the time. Their plan is to wipe out 50% of the world's population, they are already poisoning food, water, burning forests wanting to wipe out meat, herbs spraying clouds, making artificial weather, talking about environmentalism, and they are building hundreds of factories in China, a lie breeds a lie
Selling snake oil
So tired of seeing this snake oil salesman, V shred on YouTube
What was they thinking
You mean to tell me that they sent five (5) people down to that depth without FIRST sending a PROTOTYPE down!?!?  ....I'm an inventor with 125 intellectual properties and you never, EVER, put to use ANYTHING without first safety testing it.
Ftastic

notice they were NOT black folks on that sucka............................................ naw they dont do that
The man was clearly delusional
Paying $250k to take yr life.what a price!!

Now they're all resting in Davie Jones's Locker, as someone who comes from a family of sailors, who sailed the Sea's for generations, the one thing that was always drilled into my head is always respect the ocean, we may have conquered land, we will never conquer the Sea.
Titanic is cursed so it follows anyone who seeks it's out. My Condolences to their families. 🌹
you cannot escape physics.
This is interesting for people who are afraid of swimming, like me❤
skydiving or scuba diving isn't a good choice for comparison because when you do it you don't endanger life of other people so directly... or maybe he thought you can squeeze 4 people into one single dry suit or something? Skydiving yes, but it also fails as comparison to submarines because people just don't invent new parachutes made with other, cheaper materials and go skydive with some random people who paid so they can be attached to you and jump from the heavens just to be later respawned back there after you both hit the ground and died because you're innovative parachute made with cheap materials failed... Guys who were part of this submarine thing were just a bunch of ignorants, nothing more, and their ignorance and arrogance killed themselves and 3 innocent people so cbs: please spare us this bullsh1t justifications about how they had good intentions or whatever just because they were just passionates...
When you have controler drift at the wrong time

I have a theory based on the news documents. It is truthful that the submarine implosioned. Answer me this if you are smart enough! There was a female recording the Titan when this one was submerging. Then, she disappears. At the moment that this was happening on the Atlantic Sea, the Congress of USA was providing evidence that there was a connection between the CEO of OceanGate company and Hunter Biden about pedophile involvement that probably the CEO of OceanGate have to testify in Congress. For some reason wich i have no idea, the CEO was forced to do the expedition with out idea what he was ready to be  facing, sorry he wasn't forced, he decided to join that team. My theory is because the submarine was sinking much more faster than before, on purpose? I don't know if it was on purpose, but yes, it was more faster than before, so the pressure was much more heavier. But before the Titan implosioned there were sounds of somebody hitting with a hammer from the inside. Who was it? The lady that disappears and the rest of the crew members? Is the CEO of Ocean Gates alive on purpose and people are thinking that he is dead? Why the Elite want to keep him alive? Will the company will succeed with out him? I bet you that the company will close because Elite will get that money for human trafficking. Implosion will leave no track of human rest at 13,000 feet deep. Por lady with the camera. God have mercy. We are living in a lie at this moment.
Who cares
RIP 🙏🕊️⚓
Ubåtsjävel. De hade överlevt om de haft en riktig x box dosa
The noise was Morse code!
Yeah, yeah... seemed funny then, I bet... Not so funny after all if your cheap-ness killed yourself and 4 people who trusted their life to you!
The guy who was fired for raising safety concerns is a smart man. I bet his family is really greatful that he did leave. "Safety is a waste." Unbelievable  Safety first!
no one gonna mention the banging noise???
Good riddance!!  No loss here Ladies and gents and the alphabet people
Universe wrestling 💪
Unbelievable.
Personally I think it's time we left the titanic to rest. This has been her warning shot.
It’s always dangerous to go with someone who thinks they know everything.. It’s always dangerous to go with someone who thinks they know everything..
How ironic. It was exactly this sort of technogical arrogance and corner cutting which caused the Titanic disaster in the first place
Him using the store bought items was already a red flag. But using an xbox controller was an even bigger red flag.
He had been warned about these materials and did not listen! He took his life and the lives of others and gambled and lost!
All the money in the world can't save you from yourself
"The risk of dying gives meaning to living." compare this sentence to the past 3 years, where we had to try anything to save everybody.
Wasn't there a YoutTuber that denied going on the Tiyan?
however , these are the  people who  push the world forward. they lost their lives but remain a hard physics lesson
Nice little distraction hoax
The 3 staff took “money cant buy anything” to a different level 💀💀💀💀 (rip 2 customers) 🙏🙏🙏
Isn't there a reason why specialties and subspecialties exist in many STEM fields? Just because one has a degree in one field of engineering doesn't suddenly make one an expert in another even if there are overlaps. Rush's degree was apparently in aerospace engineering and his money-minded business side just completely overrode everything.
Why tf did they use a controller to controll a sub
lesson learned ; never trust the rich
Bruhhhhh a bluetooth ! Controller the bluetooth in water bruhhh
I don't know why people can't leave the Titanic alone it is several 1, 000's of people's graves let them rest in peace !!!  If you can't do proper checks to make sure, everything is safe then you're stupid.
And indeed the arrogance and hubris of the original Titans; the Nephilim who were the offspring of the unnatural hybridization of  humans and fallen angels, as per Genesis 6. These guys went where angels fear to tread - alas! So sad.
🥱🥱🥱🥱😴
6:26 get it?? yeah I will see myself out.
Dam it
'The world mourns the loss of Stockton Rush...' - no, they don't.
Bro Stockton Rush is the Mr Krabs of irl
Like his hero Steve Jobs he died because he thought he knew better than all the experts, even when they were saying to his face that he was going to get himself killed. That's not a genius, that's a stupid person.
'He had all the credentials' - except the important one, a qualification in submersible engineering.
No way I’d ever let anyone bolt me inside that saltwater coffin.  I don’t even like elevators.
Bruh this idiot made a DEEP SEA SUBMARINE out of popsicle sticks spit and sheer will power and thought it would make it to the bottom of the ocean
dont be so over,you have done this all preplanned,you are big gang that has crushed to our muslims brothers
Wow
NASA said they had NOTHING to do with that contraption!
00:40 - why does he look like that?!?!??!  Good Grief!  and 03:43  I just can't stop laughing~
His last words probably were " remember you signed the waiver"
3:14 "Once the pressure vessel it's you're certain than it's not going to collape on everybody, eveything else can fail... << THE SATANIC SUB >> 😮
It is very sad,  I wish with all my heart that the 5 people would be alive and well today.
"Inside the Titanic sub disaster" I think I'd like to observe from a safe distance.
WHITE RICH MEN
a trip to die for
Terrible,  another tragedy next to a past one.
the CEO is a failed engineer
Be for real, you are in the the middle of the ocean during a severe storm come on, y'all was scared stop it because that ship could have went down. Y'all just lucky that it stayed afloat. Stop trying to act like y'all wasn't scared. Y'all trying not to look stupid for being on that boat at that time 😔
Although so sad 😞
The ocean wasn't meant for people to dive 14000+ft and explore seek and find out how long you will live
Wow this guy saying saftey is in the way of innovation truly shows that he doesn't care about people. I work and a warehouse/plant where saftey is #1 cause we want you to return to your family safe. We buold shot for power plants and other things sucj as cape Canaveral
"Safety just is pure waste" that´s all I need to know about that man.
.
No body was in IT.. !!!! FAKE NEWS PEOPLE
Run far far away from anyone who says this 6:58.
Aint no wah thai cantrik itu with controler game
4 victims, not passengers. good riddance for anyone but the teenager. truly feeling sorry for him. it's still very disgusting to go watch to titanic tho
They found something
his consistent , repeated interviews mocking safety standards...man....why didnt he listen to a community of experts who were terrified of Titan..
The unthinkable became all too real? Seems a lot of people in the submersible business thought just that, and said so. And I, for one, won't mourn any of the self-indulgent fools that perished. Want some thrills before it kills you?  Buy a Hang-glider.
He had the credentials!?!? Ever heard of Dr. Death!? Even sociopaths can get degrees.
#who_waylon💯💰💍💰 Family My condolences my heart goes out to the family family’s lost a loved ones at sea may God have mercy on my soul.
An individual’s ego, a joke of the modern science and an expensive failure! But, in the current world we are going to witness many more such costly expeditions, unfortunately
What a joke
They should send only robots and camera no person that may drown
It already sunk... why are we still going there? Leave it alone!!
Smh it's fake yall. Come one just listen.
Atleast 😂 they got to drink alot of water .😅
i wonder why someone  is willing to pay  250k$$$   to  pay visitin  in Titanic  inside    in a   Coca-Cola  can  with 0  protection....   must be totally stupid     .....  and now 5 ppl are dead and the worst  is they cant even bury them...
should of used a ps5 controller
That's why ion like mf water and its fish
Is cap no real footage
It’s not always good to go cheap
The subs that filmed Titanic for James Cameron where all built by the Finnish and Soviet Union, made with titanium and had sphere crew compartment that only supported 3 people. And yet they were HUGE.
Dude just wanted to grow his wealth FAST and cheap and paid with his life. As he wouldn't had the money to actually build something decent. 20 million net worth simply doesnt pay the high-tech
Exploring new & risky frontiers is always dangerous.  NASA had how many dozens or hundreds of engineers working on the Space Shuttle with tens of thousands of checklist/safety items and we still lost TWO before they cancelled the program.  This was tragic & unfortunate, but there is risk with everything in life and like always a lot of second-hand quarterbacking always after the fact.
The CEO didn't want to hire 50+ experienced, white military men because he wanted diversity. . . how is that diversity working out for you.
WE ALL LIVE IN A YELLOW SUBMARINE ! DIDN'T THESE GUYS LISTEN ?
why does everyone care that 5 people died lmao
Why is no one reporting on the deleted emails the digital currency the impeachment of Biden the recorded conversations just curious as to why our media doesn’t think that important
He was so proud of his toy…..
Egotistical idiots
They had more money than sense very stupid peaple no the great loss.
You can't fix stupid
I'm not opposed to the amount of money and efforts spent on the Titan rescue as any one person's life is valuable. But as the story points out, why was there not anywhere near the same level of human effort and cost expended for those 700+ people who perished on the migrant ship off the coast of Greece?
This narrator speaks too slowly. ❤
6:59 DESTINY
I know people hate the rich and find some issues with family members but like... the memes are so messed up and anyone who makes fun of them are terrible people. There was a teenage boy on there who lost his life and there are family members beyond any problematic behavior and they have to witness their family members being joked about incessantly.
He certainly put his name it history..
it all makes zero sense?  In this society we embrace mental illness fuelled with "arrogance as  brilliance.....God help us!
Ship that will never sink and same way submarine that will never sink !! both failed in reality !!
Not sure how you can link aerospace engineering to marine deep sea engineering. Even if you do stress cycling of components is how air planes components are engineered.  So how did all this engineering get lost with a submarine?  Suddenly testing of components isn’t required ?  This guy is a mad man with a death wish. My only concern is he convinced people that didn’t understand. Convinced these poor people out of money and lives to be test dummies
It was poorly designed so it was expected to implode. I don't see that the issue is.
They wanna play big boy games but to cheap to spend big boy cash
So weird that this sht happend at the same time as the immigrant ship that sank killing everyone on board beacause the government didn't want to help them. And they're talking about some rich billionaires that died because of their stupidity f this.
Wonder why they needed 3 things.  Oh yeah, he was an idiot
finally diversity pays off
i wish they would outlaw slow-talking so i dont have to speed up playback
Yea
They build everything
The man with the black jacket is the owner I think so! Tho I cannot jear the words yea. The submarine name is ocean Gate I haven’t be there any They died June 17 😢😮😢 I care about the five man’s who died:c
Apparently almost all of his innovative ideas were just a means of costcutting. E.G. hiring young engineers who were just out of university 'because they were 'more imaginative' than over 50 year old experienced and highly qualified engineers. The fact that they were also much cheaper to hire was not mentioned. Refusing independent inspection also saved money. Etc.
NASA, consultant, and what experience have they got with underwater subs, yeah NONE

It's a lesson
😢😢😢😢😢😢
One video said a previous dive let water in that was still there on the fatal last dive.
Excellent video. I really like this reporter.
hubris describes mr rush "I'm doing some thing they thosewho don't think like him must be wrong, too bad he chose to believe "they" don't like innovatiion that goes against safety norms if you were going to sky dive would you want your para chute packed in a manner" they said wasn't sound or would you insis the method " they" insisted was the safe and proper way         aerospace engineer  how about hydro space engineer, just be cause the formula's say it's good proper testing ensures it's good.
"At some point safety is a pure waste" yeah I am not associating taking risks in business to taking risks with adventures
If you guys wondering why the console lost connection, it is because there were no wifi under the sea😂😂
Did he say a game controller?????????????? for 2fitty k I am out on the submersive with the xbox controller
Todavía no puedo entender gente con demasiada plata que se vayan en un submarino de mierda que no sirve teniendo submarinos profesionales todavía no entiendo gente enferma para pagar tanta plata y Mauricion la mitad del océano en su Marino que no vale la pena
If it’s better than titanium why did if implode? 🤡 guy should go to jail for his action of not listening to the engineers before this happened.
PACKWATCH RIPBOZO
This is so tragic
They used a video game controller that’s so dumb
Unbelievably dangerous
Ocean Grave
I  can't risk my life to this,That's why women stay long life than men!
What is the purpose of going to see the Titanic? Im fine viewing videos of it on tv from the comfort of my own couch. There just some things thats not worth it...and this, is one such thing.
Even he knew he was playing Russian roulette, It was a use it 3 times and throw it away sub,, but Stockton had other ideas 🤔
why were going there
Distract the people with real or fake side stories and cover up the real news.....What was going on while the sub "supposedly sunk...The BIDENS were getting charged. What was happening when Jeffery Epstein's babe was in a court on Child rape, conveniently a courtroom that didn't allow cameras for some reason....well, Johnny Depp and Amber were playing their part in a month long daytime saga on TVs everywhere...DISTRACT and Divert.
A quarter of arrogant jerks got killed by their own stupidity. Society is no poorer. Rest in pieces and good riddance.
No matter how stupid is someone and his ideas , if he or she is charismatic many people will follow it. Unfortunately this is how many neurotypicals are working. Feeling and prime emotions over logic and common sense.  And for all wanna be Steve Jobs ambitious arrogant pricks: Please, he had WORKING real product on the table, not uncertified  junk and solely glamorous words and self esteem.
Just a damn distraction
For such design, it means to fail. It is just a matter of time.
So safety is a waist well I am sure he has nothing to say about it now wait he can't!!!
Hows that thing called titan if it is  A PLASTIC death TUBE!!!
What a joke! They knew sunday they were gone yet dragged it out in the news cycle to attempt to cover the news of joe bidens corruption scandle and his sons sweetheart deal
Is it true companies are offering trips to the Titanic with an optional excursion to the new debris field?
The only reason they sent it down with ppl to do a trial other wise it was dangerous they knew that why did they allow it because they anted to see for next time what they need to work on
YouTube don't delete by comment u likkle peado
Shame it wasn't just  Stockton that turned to  fish juice,  would of been karma, instead it's a tragedy,   not even a proper controller  haha 😂 logitec  wtf
5 rich people die because of an executive who built a trash sub to increase profits....and people are crying about empathy? Hundreds of immigrants die a few days before this tin can blew up and nobody cared. Its all relative.....(I do still feel bad for the 19 year old)
This is a very good report.... HOWEVER,  true me....  *THE WORLD IS NOT MOURNING* Everyone else in the world have to go to *our annual safety inspections* before we can even drive our own cars.
Except, it wasn't approved and engineered by NASA. NASA stated it "did not conduct or test manufacturing". Do the due diligence the public deserves.
James Cameron is going to make a movie entitled "Titan"
When big boys mistake real life for a playstation game.
sorrey, but I do not give a hoot,  they played with fire and got burnt, so much for the back up, with back up,  with back up and one more back up, which I might add, not one worked  :)
Not sad at all. They were warned about the dangers and still paid for what they wanted.  How about the capsized boat with over 100 immigrants off the coast of Greece? Now that was a tragedy.
Sad to say none of the back up equipment worked. So at what point did all this back equipment went wrong. I said before I even knew NASA had a hand in something in this sub that they needed their help. Now what I heard what help they had they needed more help from them. I kind of think they knew they may have known that it might not work.
So..bottom line..is dis a story of a foolish ceo?
Having more money than brains, isn't always a plus.
These intrepid explorers should never have children. So selfish.
Told you so
The 5 people are billionaire just buy a good submarine 😅😢
main thing that takes my breath away EVERY time I see it is the diagram of  the inside of the submersible & the  ridiculous way they unprofessionally *SQUISH* together 5 folks into the  Titan, like so many  huddled-up human SARDINES!!  & for QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS per patron??!!  I can’t even THINK about the leg cramps resulting from having your knees in your chest for 5 hours… good thing they weren’t large chested women…  probably could only fit 4, not 5 people!!     In addition, it certainly looks like they are about to have a seyonce like we did at slumber parties when I was in Girl Scouts… I wonder if they had remembered to bring their Ouija Board?  Maybe they summoned the WRONG spirts….   (OR, maybe attention needed to be brought to the fact that the Titanic is an actual GRAVESITE, & should be respected as such, not be turned into a roadside tourist attraction for rich people.)🐢🐢
I'm with John Cusack all the way
250k i want cars than this =D
Point is there was no safety protocols. My condolences to the family.
The world mourns? Really?? Perhaps maybe yes for the lost of the teenage boy…
Tbh, it kinda reminds me of the Iron Lung game.
I don't think that Mr. Rush can be included in the list of people who died "pushing the envelope" or those who go exploring for the rush of excitement, but rather in the list of those men or women who thought they knew best, in the face of repeated warnings from real authorities  - which is called arrogance  - as Mr. James Cameron pointed out, Mr. Rush reminded him of the Captain of the Titanic who didn't listen to warnings but went "full steam ahead" in shere stupidity and arrogance, as well as disregard for basic human protection protocols. So, I disagree with this journalist's assessment at the end of his presentation of his final sentence and conclusion.
It was operated by a PlayStation controller and they still got onboard. Wow
Carbon fiber for that depth 😫? I'd be using a 1m thich steel armor if I'd be going 4km down the ocean...
Titanic has seen enough wasted lives because of the Titanic pride and arrogance of humans.
They did not consult the calculations of military submarines??
When he take things lightly
I don't understand about these rich people are willing to spend so much money on the best and most expensive things in their homes, cars, and vacation but when it comes to their lives they're willing to get the cheapest things. Make it make sense!
Who would need to go to the titanic 37 times????????????  James Cameron I get because he was doing a movie. But still!
Never understimate mother nature
R.I.P TITANIC 😢
And then it became a meme
Africans are dieing everyday but America turn her dirty face for sponsoring wars in Africa ,Asia . Refugees are all over the high sea and u spend millions looking for some rich criminals . Occult members. Free Afticans
Fake news
It was a deadly  journey.
Well now i know how they died. Because they got in a carbon fibre bodied submarine.  Wtf...   Why ...   Should of stuck with Australian engineers.
the poor kid he was basically forced by his rich father to go down
Don’t trust everything you read or See on News! Check up the companies Economic situation and the insurances These 5 had, let’s See How the real situation is After that! And where are the Bodies? Use your own BRAIN!
It teaches me not to trust anyone more than ever , most people  are all full of crap
Imagine Stockton Rush didn't died in this incident? He would had a great time in the courthouse and jail and being hated all around the world. HAHAHAHAHA
Titan 2 is here ready to go to the titanic,  comes complete with PlayStation,  peep hole , long drop , and for safety your own titan life jacket,   only 500.000 per person get in quick tickets selling fast.
Life is itself dangerous and as humans living our life we have the right to live it as dangerously as we want.  Where the line starts to blur in this instance is when one person is willing to risk more and they take other people with them.  My big question is "Was Stockton 100% transparent with the other people?".  If he was then everyone in that sub was there under their own choice.  If he wasn't then the other people were there under false information and it could bring up the charge of manslaughter.    We should never hold back people who want to push the boundaries so long as they are 100% aware of the true risks.
2:29 WOW
Excellent 🎉
They put their lives in the hands of an edomite (which GOD hates) and this was the conclusion.
The unthinkable was awfully evident to the rest of the world
This hurts, no matter what. Yes we take risks daily, but come on😢
Cheating the right process is a recipe for dissactor the reward isn't worth the risk
I have been hearing about this tragedy on the news but didn’t know the exact details. Thanks for this video.
Remind me of the doctors putting out misinformation about the vaccine my condolences to the family of the people that lost their lives regulations work
Stop calling this a disaster!!!! It’s a misfortunate accident at best. A disaster would be what is happening in Palestine, Rohingya or Africa!
arrogance, reckless and wrong self believe is the main downfall. You cannot outsmart physics and engineering.
FAKE NEWS
Did they even tested it with unmanned mission?
No port hole
I would not sit Indian style. Ain't enough to see down there. The pressure cannot be repeated on anything. 1 new sub every trip.
250k to watch somebody have a game controller  as a steering wheel.....
they paid 200k to go join the titanic ghost, man if people dont want their money so much give it to me, lots of nice thing i could do with so much.
at some stage safety's going to cost you money is what he's saying
That old sub captain did the best description of this tragic accident : the sub was made of a three different materials that will eventually fail due to having three different molecular structure with different wear tolerance : CARBON FIBER, TITANIUM, PLEXI GLASS. While all great, putting them together on a sub it's not a great idea. Would work better if the sub it's made of only one of them , like all carbon fiber or titanium or plexiglass.
I wish he was still alive so he can be arrested for the rest of his life
am confused how nobody said anything about the 2 enginneers tat devolepd  the titanc i believe in alla and islam for one reason wen they said even allah cant do anyting or god cant do anything the strike got on tem and tey dissappeared if they hit a ice mountain there should be marks allah destroyed them and never liked what the engineer said
How often did they do a deep inspection of main hull integrity?
With the titanic they said God couldn’t sink it and he did. The submarine was basically the same thing. God stopped it. He’s not going to be tested. But he still has compassion on us even though we turn our backs on him. He loves us and wants the best for us. I love you and he does too. Find him
Princeton can charge half a million for a degree but can’t teach common sense?
What about the school shootings? Who cares about this.
May everyone rest in peace. Bless all who are mourning their lost.
He was comparing this PS5 controller based submersible to iPhone and Tesla, Mr. know it all! Out side of the box, indeed!  RIP
I see the twist in the end, spinning a different narrative on Stockton stating essentially “ curiosity killed the cat”, however curiosity also killed the other people on board. They were killed because of his own arrogance to take criticism or critiques. You’re a rich rich man and we’re getting parts from Camper World? There’s no doubt he was an explorative individual but I think his privilege let him get as far as he did without regulations or inspections! It’s just so sad to me all of this could’ve easily been prevented! Safety should always been the number one priority but instead he risked that at the expense of being, “ different”.
i wonder what kind of movie they make out of it. Will it be a romance or more drama you guys think?
Once they said most of the controls and mechanisms were store bought i would have said no thank you! More to the story than were being told. Handful  of super wealthy people on that thing. They tell us what they want us to know but something is really sus about it all. Open your eyes people!!
i used to have something like this when I was a kid, its called Mecanno
I they thought that if they died they can get rebooted
he`s inside a fish now.
CHEAP IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER!
Hmm 1:11 when someone includes a "it's stronger than" in their dialogue, that's a red flag right there.

Everyone has a different risk tolerance, think of how many people died trying to fly.  I’m sure some of Rush’s ideas will be looked at in the future, but they did find out what doesn’t work.  RIP to those lost, perhaps the Titanic should be left alone now.

Don't trust businessmen specially for a very risky business. They make it like a joke in exchange for their life. 🥱
سبحان الله وبحمده if Allah wrote for your death to be deep in the sea, you will spend millions just to make it on there on time.   A reminder that people don’t go for adventure sprees to graveyards then why is it different if thousands died at sea and to go visit them for a thrill or entertainment.   May Allah ‏guide us and give us a good ending   ‎آمين يا رب العالمين
It’s always dangerous to go with someone who thinks they know everything.. It’s always dangerous to go with someone who thinks they know everything..
he was suicidal at best
I've already commented, sorry again! Have a nice day ❤️❤️
I’ve never seen the titanic and I’m still here
Rush’s ego killed everyone on board, at least he went down with his ship.
great ty bili
so very sad
What's the motive behind visiting the Titanic!  Is there anything good from it!  Should leave it alone! The ocean is for the fishes etc. What a loss of innocent lives.
3 strike rule. 🤯 To depths of 12,000 feet!!!!
This guy committed suicide and he took those people with him
Such a miasma of scientific ignorance about all this business.  We have known for at least a century what would happen if a "space traveler" were to have their "space suit" suddenly to 'pop'.  This situation is precisely the same except in reverse.  I cry for the scientific stupidity of 2023 society.
Maybe just stop going to that area of the ocean?  Just throwing it out there…😐

There's a reason that this submersible was one of a kind and is considered experimental by established experts. Nobody else uses this type of construction with a submersible at those depths for good reason. Not a single nation uses this type of design with submersibles in their military. I believe all those individuals who signed on knew the danger involved at such depths, because they were required to sign off on legal documents regarding it. If not, then I suspect they failed to do their due diligence, with proper research and preparation as individuals who enjoy adventure and taking risks. Several other people have backed out of trips at that depth in that particular submersible, and for precisely that reason. It was an experimental craft and the only one of it's kind in use. That's a very big clue. Nobody and no government anywhere has ever employed such materials with that design together at those depths, except for this company with this CEO heading it up. He appears to have been very enthusiastic and sincere in his endeavors, but may have been overly optimistic regarding the longterm durability of such a design with those materials at that depth. Those depths are dangerous and brutal at all times, and therefore extreme caution must be considered standard  practice. Perhaps this design will be very useful in the future at depths with less pressure, even if it isn't quite ready for commercial tourism to the depth of the Titanic. It'd be great to see several nations colaborate in testing the design and materials in order to know exactly what happened and how it can be avoided in the future. While we know it imploded, there may have been more than one compromised feature in the overall design, as well as in materials used and the sourcing of those materials. These individuals gave their lives by putting their trust in the submersible's design. Let's honor their lives and memories by understanding everything possible about this accident and the craft's failure.
Add five more precious souls to the 1,500 lost on April 14th, 1912.

I think even Wright brothers didn't risk their lives so unconsciously. He clearly overestimated the durability of carbon fiber.
This man was suicidal thought he knew everything and didnt care about safety
Growing up i have always heard a superstition that when a dead trapped soul wants to leave they have to be replaced and i cant help but think some of the drowned souls from titanic wanted to leave and used those fools as replacements what else. An you expect going 2 miles under water in a tin can rip
*Shittyfluted version of My Heart Will Go On intensifies...* Well... at least their team was InSpIrEd and DiVeRsE and not white and bornig, isn't it?
The director of Oceangate,if 30procent of justice ,at least 7years jail.
After seeing the renewed interest in people paying large amounts of money into going to see the Titanic wreckage, I can't imagine that Musk and Bezos are going to get into this.
Mother of God ,joystick like in play station 1.
This small submarine I'see that iz big bottle of oxigen,with tehnology old Russian tehnology.
Too bad 😔
Perfect way to get rid of some one bury him in the ocean
Billionaires that cheap clearly nothing like other properly put together subs
the engineer took everything as  joke we dont play with mother nature wen it takes its course u cant do nothing but perish
This company should change their name oceangate to hellgate. This is what happens when man fights against nature
When I heard plexi-glass I knew it was over
Big boy played with toys and drew other big boys in to his fantasy world. Infantilism. Why should anybody have an urge to go down in the darkness??
The Human is really st..............................................
"Disaster" is quite a big term to use, I'd go with "expected accident" or "deadly scam", it's bad for them but WAAAAY more people die on the workplace, car accidents, obesity and pollution related diseases, malnourishment or just die in a camp for having the wrong race/ideology (this happens in China nowadays). So yeah, a disaster.
Him Pay for That JEWISH KINGDOM COMING ZOOM 😂❤
Safety First
"Your lights can go, your thrusters can go, youre still gonna be safe" A sitting duck 12,500 ft under the surface of the ocean is NOT safe. There is no way to tow that thing to the surface unless its in pieces.
He just seems so careless. Arrogantly careless.

This guy tho 😢
When it comes to trusting your life to other people who are pushing boundaries in extreme environments, the Darwin Award is one fool decision away from holding an awards ceremony.
Was there a lady onboard too?
THE TITANIC IS CURSED   BTW RIP to the 5 memebers
a staged event?
While inspection by regulators may have prevented this tragedy, the innovators are correct. Regulations stiffle progress. Now, an investigation will discover what went wrong, fix it and improve the carbon fibre sub. Had the regulators gotten in the way, no such improvement would have been possible.
If it wasn't 2023 and I wasn't a computer engineer developing AI, I would have said it was a titanic curse, such a tragic accident always bothering me, safety and safety and safety and calculation plus simulations, and my final world expedition comes with danger.
Too bad Trump's family weren't on board. We'd be celebrating.
It’s ubsurd how the west loves to challenge Allah all the time.
this makes men want to study harder !!
RIP 😥😥
The ''unthinkable'' LMAO
Pretty stupid to think plastic will hold up to that type of pressure and temperature change from the surface to the  titanic.  Plastic expands and contracts way more than steel. Utter stupidity.
What were they doing, what did they hope to accomplish by going down to view and explore the 113 year old wreck of the Titanic?!
In way they had a death wish 🤞 💀
What this tragedy teaches us is that just b/c you don’t respect the forces of nature doesn’t mean that the forces of nature will respect you.
Famous last words " No it doesn't need to be tested"
Couldn't even use a good brand controller... Logitech is garbage!!!
Hey baby!!!!!!!😍😍🥵🥵
So nobody is going to talk about how this guy sounds like Ben Shapiro
The man grew a big head and ended up killing innocent lives.
"When you're trying something outside the box, people inside the box think you're nuts." Not when 'inside the box' requires actual, secure safety measures and not a x-box controller to direct an entire sub. You can't expect a man who thinks he knows everything to lead a DIY submarine 12,500 feet down in the ocean. My heart goes out to the victim's families.
Not my fault they used a Logitech controller
Don't feel bad for a group of rich people looking for an adventure. We the people should be asking why is this a bigger story then an old fishing boat with 700 plus people, that was in trouble and no one helped. These people weren't looking for adventure, their looking to a change too have a better life. Poor people.
crazy how wealth and money remove common sense
I am happy that happened mr who knows everything!
Every human being commits sin and they keep us away from God.  There is only one way to reconcile with our heavenly father: by repenting of our mistakes, confessing them, forsaking them and accepting Jesus Christ as our only Lord and Savior, who suffered and died on the cross to pay for our sins in our place. .  God loves you and has a place in heaven reserved for you.  Read the Bible, seek it and accept it in your life.
RIP to all these people, I would have never I would never get in that contraption.
These rich foolish people died because of stupidity. And because they're white and Rich we spend all that time all that money and effort to find them they should pay the bill for it. What about the immigrants that were poor and searching poor a better life where they drowned and what search was done for them. I have no sympathy for the stupid people that paid to go into that death trap
Why u care so much for this??? And in the same time a boat full of african men and women and children died near Italy?just bcs they were poor ?or bcs are africans?
It wasnt unthinkable. Every expert in the field was thinking it and saying it out loud.
dont you think the news is just divergying us
250k for a ride in a death trap
Meanwhile a 19 year old kid is gone forever because of this guy trying to use duct tape and bubble gum to increase profit margin.
Honestly I'd say Stockton deserved it.
Moral of this story: Dont name ur boats/etc a god damn "titanic"
I'm gonna build a rocket to go to the Sun, I asked NASA if carbon fiber is good. They said yes, so now i know its indestructible and wont get destroyed as they are my consultants.  This is most likely the same senario this guy had when he used Nasa as consults.
Don't want to see the whole thing is crazy
Well it seemed like they covered all their bases he seemed like a smart guy just so sad 😢
Darwin award winners of 2023 )
Titan is a case study about the dangers or groupthink and arrogance.
I dont believe a word
RIP rush. Good for you
Is this the rush guy Joe Rogan talks about, that makes his sensory deprivation tanks.
Remember Challenger?
He never fixed the condensation problem in 5 years....at 6:44. Really. Also the ballest under the sub seem to compromise the frame too.
Big respect to Rush for his achievements but damn isnt he cocky? I mean the controler is a knock off of xbox joystick come on. We all know the entire oceans weight is pushing towards you the deeper you get and its only made of carbor fiber this submersible. Too arrogant for him to say carbon fiber is better than titanium. Too cocky.
Ghosts of Titanic baked a cake and went to meet they’re new neighbours in 111 years.
The submarine is not fully equip, and by  going down there with that oceangate titan is like going on a suicide
this sounds like a child being proud of their little science project, not a professional who takes the lives of others seriously
Is so sad how this all ended i feel especially sad for the young guy i dont understand why he would take that risk to please his dad and most of all why would his parents allowed their son to take that risk . 😭😭
The 19 year old  boy he didn't won't to go  ....that's who I feel sorry for
Captain Kirk is a fictional character, what on Earth is that man talking about? He got those people killed!
Are you going to trust carbon fiber at the bottom of the ocean?

@3:43 he sounded too joyous in that line
What did the orca eat for dinner? Five Guys. They have subs now.
So was the titanic... not like any other ships... 😢
Me queda un porciento
😪😪
Very sad about the innocent folks that died onboard. But, this is a great lesson of why you should not cut corners. This submarine was the prime example of: "let's cut every corner that there is, and justify it with other companies trying to stop rapid progress.) The rapid progress, instead became rapid implosion.
Fake😢
Just because the guy was a billionare does not mean he knew how to build a safe submersible. This type of work shoild have been handled by Navy or NOAA because they know how to build submersibles.
I can't believe how stupid this is..
stockton rush. more like stockton crushed 😃
I wouldn’t say the 🌎 mourns
I understand he was trying to innovative ocean exploration..but he monetized it like a business, charging people lots of money to take a chance on a non certified sub . Rip to all perished
Store bought cameras? 230$k x 5 is $1.3 mil wth
I mean, that is absolutely horrible they lost their kids. But I don’t think he should get 50years. The kid was doing donuts being an idiot and accidentally killed those people which again is horrible.
STOP going down there! It's a grave site. We have visited enough for education and so on and don't need to go back! Let those people rest in piece. The fact that they couldn't be buried where their love one's could visit is bad enough. Instead they get to be visited by nosey strangers! RIP to all the Titanic victims and the 5 who died in this tragedy too.
Very sad condolence to all their families and friends, may their souls rest in peace.
This idiot’s actions caused the deaths of not only himself but 4 others.
It’s like God hate the name titanic
3:06 ouch. That didn’t age well.
Guys, to be honest, I think he just wanted to play Iron Lung IRL
Damn imploding, I would've died from claustrophobia and would've backed out as soon as I walked on. Gimme my $250,000 back 😂😂😂😂
12 times, damn that was probably way past its service life.
People need to stop going to the Titanic site.
Why did Stockton say that cf is better than titanium?
They passed we are watching
😢😢
You can't ignore safety over innovation.
That part of the water is cursed
Arrogance and pride were his weakness.
read MrBeast twitted that he was invited to be there too...but he turn it down.
250k ticket to lala land
They paid 250k a piece to ride into the depths of the sea in a damn tuna can. How crazy and bizarre this seems to me
Hmmm hmmmm hmmm I can’t 😂😂😂
Thats by far the dumbest case of "lets skip some safety features they're not necessary" that I've seen so far. Any engineering student should know when it comes to safety features It's better to have a few more than not enought of them.
Got what they Deserved
May their souls rest in peace.
To take that machine and those people’s in that deep ocean with no kind of professional certification is beyond reckless and idiotic!! Very sad those families suffered from guy of that magnitude!!
Praying for the family and friends. May GOD Wrap his loving arms around y'all so y'all find comfort
"Better than titanium"   Lol
$250,000... here i come struggling to even afford a holiday.
Ceo evil and stupid grifter .....
It was a matter of not knowing the number of dives that the same vehicle. Every dive takes its toll on the integrity of the vessel. and this seems to have passed Stockton Rush by. Many deep sea vessels only make one or two trips  before retiring. This vessel had made 3.
Just sit right back and you will hear of a tale of a fatal trip
HARD certification is way more sound than i eyeballed it certification!!
*davey Jones locker
Rich ways to die 😂
Uhh how is this the first time it imploded? And yea, why'd he get on that dangerous sub wtf
So sad that father was one of those dudes trying to communicate with aliens they said imagine he did
B 0:27
noob
maybe you shouldn’t control a deep sea submarine with a gaming control and you’d probably survive
47 times, wow!
He should’ve been charging people $1,000.00 not $250,000.00 tf
Can I see it from the outside? I don’t wanna implode when we replay this
"Arnie Weissmann, editor-in-chief of Travel Weekly, initially agreed to join the June expedition, the Washington Post reports, but backed out at the last minute due to a scheduling conflict. A May dive he was supposed to go on also was canceled due to bad weather.  A conversation he had with OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush the night before the expedition, however, still haunts him to this day.  According to Weissmann, Rush had bought the carbon fiber used to make the Titan "at a big discount from Boeing," because "it was past its shelf life for use in airplanes."  In other words, Rush knew that the carbon fiber — which is a very poor choice of material for a deepsea vessel, as many experts have pointed out — already potentially had flaws that could've played a role in the Titan's tragic demise."  - courtesy of Futurism  *EDIT:  At some point those who had conversations with the Mad Hatter should have analyzed themselves.  I wouldn't have needed a full convo with that dude to understand he was  *INSANE* .  Showing me the remote; I'M NOT GOING.  Showing me the on/off switch; I'M NOT GOING.  Telling me "safety is a waste";  I'M NOT GOING annnd I'm reporting you to the proper authorities.  Folks that rode in that joant after sitting through what  *THEY*  obviously interpreted as a serious, intellectual, PROFESSIONAL discussion with the  *NEW*  Jim Jones are the ones more mental than HIM!  This interview was frustrating...smh.
Why can't the Titanic wreckage be brought up from the sea floor? Then people won't go down there to sea it. I understand Titanic is corroding away daily.
Oh my god
I don't to take away from the tragedy of this story, but youtuber Razor Fist pointed out in a very similar video that there are hundreds of thousands of tragedies every day. School classes die in bus crashes, families perish in house fires, mass murders happen across the world. And yet, the media chooses this tragedy to give so much air time, and not all the others. Why? Almost as if it's to distract the public from other important news.
