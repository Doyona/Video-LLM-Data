Me feeling pain because he killed a zombie villager which could have gotten him another advancement:
Him: it's about time Me: it's about Power(I know it wasn't like that but I don't know why it came to mind at random)
It's about time  ..it's about drive it's about power

Hi
My man really spammed attack on 1.9+ 💀💀
Shooting a villager is an achievement? Also I’ve dyed signs with glow ink sacs and never gotten an achievement
This is stolen by Bastighg, a german minecraft youtuber he did this a month ago
Anyone else think: destroy seed place seed again= [ a seedy place ]
I've never seen anyone so excited to catch a fish in Minecraft
Me hear is about time Me in brain is about drive
There is a secret advancement.
You: glowsquids im sorry i have to kill you Me and my friends: start full glowsquid killing organization named K.A.G.S (kill all glow squids)
Yess kill the ugly glow squids I wanted my moobloom

Lazy video alert
Guys go check out his twitch out. He's a great content creator and I've been following him for almost a year now (on twitch) but the sad thing is that I just now found his YouTube💀
“Because it’s about time” Me: “Because it’s about drive it’s about power we stay hungry we devour put in the work put in the hours and take what’s ours”
Please make this a series
How dose he get 11 levels…
“Look how big it is now”
Its just me or you guys think that he exited because of the expansion of the border is super cute?
Tell me this isn’t 3D forager
Him when he kills glow squid:  “IM SORRY YOU’RE SO PRETTY!” Me: *KillS it with no mercy* We could’ve gotten ALLIUM COWS
So you get so overexcited about your stupid fuckin glow squid you literally kill a ZOMBIE VILLAGER which you need for an ADVANCEMENT on the way ?!
Him:it’s about time Me: ITS ABOUT POWER
All you need to do….Is to kill 1 glow squid…….not 2
it's about time...
Kopied by BastiGHG
So.fake
He is useing og miro crat music from mirocart doubbel dass
Dont be sorry glowsquids deserve death
All I wanna know is why people wanted a squid and not a beautiful cow that would’ve probably been the third or second favorite mob in the entire game by most people
"Look how big it is now"  That's what she said 🤭😁🤣
Him: advancement Me: no, I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Jesus Christ hearing this guy talk gave me a headache calm down bro even the 5 year olds on mummy’s iPad think this is a bit excessive
This is the same system used in Viva Pinata
“Look at how big it is”  That’s what your mom said last night
Hola
You sound like mr beast
What happened when u go out of the border
too easy!
I did this challenge a while back ago. I thought this challenge up by a mod my friend introduced which if you get achievements the world border increase so I basically changed the mod a bit by using commands to do it lol
It's about power
I phone 14  Price- 1 million dollars$
That idea is called Minecraft captive and is over 5 years old. Exposed
Honestly? If you had genuine reactions this would be more interesting
I got annoyed because of his overexcitement💀
It has been a couple of years since I saw this challenge.
he is so energetic for the smallest things in life makes me happy
Aurora:omg it's so big  My mind: THATS WHAT SHE S-
"Look how big it is now." That's what she said
How to be a successful Minecraft streamer/YouTuber: 1-be excited over the most idiot things 2-do some challenges while livestreaming saying you're embarrassed even though it's some basics things and do these thing if your fan base do some not so cheap things(like buying subs,a lot of subs) and then make an entire theater over it even when your face is completely covered. 3-DO NOT,show your face 4(optional)- be a woman or be "friends" with some Minecraft streamer or (even better) Dream his army(not the stans).
sorry but like GLOW SQUIDS ARE FUCKING SHIT
How did you do this with advancments
Him: it’s about time  My brain: and about drive and power
Stop screaming
Him killing glow squid and got 2 then 3 Literally the achievement he wanted to make 1 ink for 1 sign and also him : I am sry I am sry for killing you guys

"Glow squids are so pretty"  That's the biggest lie I've ever heard
Kinda sound like Mr beast
This dude is either  just overexcited or high on coke
“LOOK HOW BIG IT IS NOW”  Don’t say it.. Don’t say it.                 That’s what she said
Him: it’s about time  Me:it’s about time it’s about towers we want fish we devour
Is no one gonna talk about the fact that he started the game with everything he needed-?
It's not glow squid ink. It's glow ink sacks.
How do I get the border on my world   I have both bedrock and Java so you can tell me any way
I like this concept!
For the love of God please just say achievement
This guy gives me a seizure

When he said look how big it is* Me😏
How do I get this
The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hitpoints, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks. The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring. His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider. Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings.  Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.  Strategy  Offensive  He can be used to jump over any level Walls, rendering them ineffective against Hog Riders. Note that while this allows Hog Riders free access to what lies behind the Walls, it does not open up gaps for other troops to move through. If the Hog Riders need the support of other ground troops, you will still need to deploy Wall Breakers, a Jump Spell, or Earthquake Spells in order to assist them. Hog Riders can be used en masse, i.e. a "Hog Rider Rush", without requiring any Wall Breakers to break Walls. However, such a strategy can be costly in terms of Dark Elixir, and sports weaknesses against defending Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps, a problem which only becomes more prominent at higher levels. At Town Hall 10 and above, Hog Riders can be combined with Miners in a strategy known as Hog Miner or Hybrid. Both troops are able to bypass Walls innately, but Miners do not have a preferential target, allowing them to cover for Hog Riders by dealing with defending Heroes and Skeleton Traps. The combination also has weaknesses against flying Clan Castle troops, as neither are able to target air. At lower levels, Hog Riders are quite capable of acting as distracting troops like Giants; they have nearly as much health as a similar-level Giant, move twice as fast, and do considerably more damage. They work well with the Healing Spell when you group several of them together. A good tactic for using Healing Spells is to place them strategically on a cluster of defenses (at least about 3 or more) and also deploy them shortly before the Hog Riders arrive in the area, i.e. deploy them ahead of the Hog Riders. This is so that the Hog Riders get the most out of the Healing Spell, and destroy the defenses without losing too much HP. Spots where Giant Bombs or Bomb Towers are/may be should be given special attention when deploying Healing Spells. Hogs of the same level as the Giant Bomb will survive a single Giant Bomb, but they're helpless against a pair of Giant Bombs even with a Healing Spell. Heal them after they've gone through a Giant Bomb blast. The Hog Rider is one of the best troop types for drawing out Clan Castle troops, as it can avoid Walls to penetrate deep enough to reach centrally-placed Clan Castles (and enough health to not die before it gets there). Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple Archers or Wizards to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during Clan War raids. However, Skeletons from the Skeleton Trap and Heroes can also easily kill the Hog Riders, as they can only target defenses, so make sure to have some troops that target anything, such as Wizards, which can swipe out the Skeletons. Hog Riders don't target air so flying Clan Castle troops, especially Dragons, can be a big threat. Most mass Hog Rider strategies in Clan Wars require that the Clan Castle troops be killed first by luring. Bring other troops in addition to Hog Riders, such as Wizards, to deal with enemy Clan Castle troops and clean up the base.
I have now found my least favourite YouTuber
Too easy

The fakeness of your excitement is off putting
Him: "look how big it is now"  Me: how big it is????????       SUS
How do I get this
Watching shit like this will give you fucking adhd
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

How to be a minecraft YouTuber: be excited about every little thing
it's not a mistake, ✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
