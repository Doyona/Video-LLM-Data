Hope you enjoy today’s vlog!! It’s a long one so here are the times codes :))  Visiting a FALL FARM! 0:37 Baking a Halloween dessert with mom and Shane! 5:07 Casa Bonita!! 18:45 Lizze HITS our house with her car… 27:24 Nights Of The Jack! 29:58
I've watched this so much times.
This was recommended to me and I didn’t realize it was an old video 😭 I got excited thinking it was a new upload. Then I started looking at Ryland and I’m like wait why does he look so different then I realized
Remember when Shane had high energy like this video . Now he’s too chill
HOLD THE F*CK UP! ... *whispers* That said BUTTomless pit right?
I have the exact cups Shane picked up in Safeway 😍😍 I have the mini rainbow one and the green one. If you go to Starbucks a lot and get points with their app, you can get the cups for a 70% off discount so it costs like $6
THTA SPENCERRRRR HUNGRYYYY BOII @26:32
lizzie not knowing/forgetting she hit your house is absolutely hilarious lol… yes im re watching lol
Oh my gosh it's spooky time and he didn't want to go that's crazy 👻 👻
Do you know how you can tell these two are the real deal?? 😊 Because they are balanced and they don’t differ from vlog to Vlog in personality’s❤️❤️ Love you two ❤😊
Lizzie is Rylands hype man 😂
“there’s other people waiting for prizes” absolute king 👏🏼
“i love how kinda tacky it looks” i love how ryan always has to throw in a negative comment before anything nice that they do it’s so fun 😍
Wow that’s God 😮😂
Cold weather makes me want to hibernate too Ryland
We grew up in Wyoming originally from Colorado and would go to casa Bonita all the time this is so nostalgic to watch
I never realized until now is that you can see Spencer with them
Obsessed with how cute you guys are, and how close this far into your relationship. Love goals
Idk why I ever took a break from watching you guys, but I am JAZZED at how much content I have to catch up on now
Idk why I ever took a break from watching you guys, but I am JAZZED at how much content I have to catch up on now
I love this soo much. Im trying to catch up on all the vlogs ive missed like a years worth. Also so excited they had twins!!!❤ i had my first baby in February❤
Your family is my entire sub list. Rylan, Shane, Sandy, Lizzie, Morgan and Jerid🫶🏼
Watching this 2024 and I just realized Spencer was in this video 20:23
HELLO SPENCER IN THE BACKGROUND????
Have you guys watched Casa Bonita Mi Amor on Paramount plus, yet? I’m watching it because you guys introduced this place to me. Such cool history!
23:50 ain’t that dummy Morgan dated???
I really wish I knew where to get these sunglasses that Shane is wearing. I've been looking for them everywhere!
Adore you both so much!❤
Lizzie is literally Jennifer Lawerence
Rylands lens is always dirty
Dude, I have to hand wash all my dishes because we don't have a dishwasher. Believe me, I feel Ryland's pain. I love those type of cups and I have to hand wash every single one and I get intricate with it. I will pull out the seals and everything and give it a really good scrub. They are annoying to clean but they are such good cups.
Rewatching and I spot Spencer at Casa Bonita with them!!
watching this 6 months later and at 23:05 you can see spencer who is now apart of shane’s podcast!
I have to know where he got that chapstick
what a beautiful family! i love you guys! x
I am so happy I'm not the only one who hates those cups! My best friend got me one for my birthday and it will stay the only one I own.
I spotted SPENCER!!! 23:03!!
18:04 is my favorite thing ever it was so cute and it makes me so happy to see them genuinely happy
I love this place but does anyone else not see the 50 million in renovations? It literally looks ideantical to 10 yrs ago but maybe better food. I was expecting a whole new place! I see zero differences
I just realize spencer was with them at the background hahahahaha
I love Steph Pappas i dont even like mukbang videos but i love her. I also haven't let my dog ride in the car since her dad passed because of what happened💔💔
I wanted that damn slime cup SO BAD 😂😂
This unlocked a memory of my family going to Casa Bonitas when we were visiting family in Colorado and it was so insane for my 9 year old brain 😂
Funny thing is I live somewhere close to casa bonita😂
Shane, as a person who has to do the dishes: HIRE A DISH WASHING MAID
Your chapstick looks like a s.ex toy lol
I’m so confused , jumping back to their channels. So did they move to LA, then back to Colorado ? What happened to the alpacas? I’m so lost lol the binge starts now😭 also congrats Ryland and Shane ❤️ so happy for you guys and yall will be amazing parents🎉
it is so funny how shane was so over halloween the last few videos and now hes all for it! haha
Wtf is sopapillas? 😂 as a Mexican im perplexed 😅
If you go back, I want a snowglobe! That was such fun watching you love it!
Ummm yall have to let the cookies cool duh
Omg I'm so friggin jealous
Love you guys !❤
Just here to say the intro music gets me sooo hyped!!  Showing my grower boyfriend the Casa Bonita part
What'd they spend $50 Million on? It looks almost identical to how it used to look, aside from a few little things.
Aweeeeee
Shane saying the 1900s as if they didn’t end only 24 years ago 🙈😂
The way they pick up the ice cream first instead of circling back around for it gives me anxiety. I can never get something that’s frozen first and then just walk around with my cart while it’s defrosting and melting. Has to be the last thing.
Pickles asparagus is absolutely delicious but also I will eat just about anything pickled
I love the cold weather! Above freezing but cool enough to need a sweatshirt. That’s my jam
My Alexa is named Ziggy,  so you're good ❤
Me screaming in my head “let the cookies cool!!”
please stop saying girl
Oh that man😂
I had a feeling the food wasn’t that great i guess i wasn’t wrong🤭😂
I love you guys! You will be the best parents! ❤️
That's OK Vicki! Dr Dre all day! Jay-Z who? Lol.
So Send that Slime green Tumbler to RICH LUX, he has a GIT That would match perfectly w/ that cup 🥤 ❤😂🎉❤❤❤
Hahaha the Helen Hunt "Cow" scene with Lizzie was funny
Hopefully Shane also helps with the animals?
Damn rylands mom on Shane’s side not her own son that says AlOT
watching Ryland on so many costumes it gives me  Modern Famuly vibes xD LOVE IT
You need to stop showing Lizzie. She's horrible, you are already a Diva. You need some that will balance you out. Hanging out with her is like there us 2 of you. She brings nothing to the table!!!!
I loved this video! Ryland and Shane are going to be the best parents! Those twin boys are going to have the most fun! I’m also a twin mum to a boy and a girl so I can’t wait to see things that they post after they boys arrive that only a twin parent will understand! Lol also on a separate note love that Shane mentions ordinary adventures! As I’m also obsessed with kitra and Peter! 🙌🏼🥰 love you Shane and Ryland 🫶🏼
Am I the only one that didn’t understand what the $50 million surprise was?
I was SCREAMING at the tv when you went to check those cookies. You can never wait till they look done 😭 11 minutes and pull em! They finish while they cool 😅
Petition for Ryland and Shane to put a live camera in their barn so I can just look at their alpacas all day! They make me so happy 🥹🥰🥰🥰🥰
I have that Starbucks cup! However much smaller in UK as I think the US medium is our large?
the start of this video reminded me of WHO wanted Princess Ryry from the beginning, and who REALLY got won over by her cuteness xD
is there a banana bread pillsbury?!?!?!😮
He is a nice guy.
not shane already wearing the Case Bonita shirt in the intro! hahahah
👍
Awesome Awesome
Good
truly brought him to life which when you are dealing
I love how far Shane has come
good
Fun Blog.    Enjoyed it.   The swimming cafe brought back memorys  of Mylan?. Love Aunt Lori
Amazing ❤👍
wow,such an informative video uploaded...
Good
Ryland is 100%- Starbucks needs to make their cups machine washable YESTERDAY.
We need MORE than 30 min video's. Please.
Aww that fall pumpkin patch place y’all went to is right next to my parents house 😂 it’s so weird to see you film where I go/know and see you make it look so cool! 😅😍 that town is NOTHING it doesn’t even have a grocery store hahahaha
13 days have passed and no new viddy? Are ya'll ok?
Good
Nice 👍
Ñice
Good video
Nice
good
good
Should have put them in the freezer again for a bit before cutting would have softened the cookie with misfire and hardened the ice cream as not to squish. Also cookies soften quite well if stored in a baggie with a pice of bread.
We’ve had a machine washable Starbucks cup for like six years now. I was washing it by hand for like three before I realized it though.
Good to hear
We need a lot more oogie boogie boogie🤣🤣🤣🤣
Eammy
good
I’m glad I’m not the only one who cannot find those cookies!!! I get so upset that my Walmart doesn’t have them!
Nice
Oh my gosh ahaha i wanted nothing but those FREAKING cookies all october long. Went to so many stores and kept checking on every weekly grocery trip and didnt find them until Nov 1st. So nsturslly i bought enough boxes to last me the rest of the yesr
Morgan is definitely your moms twin  I love how you & Shane are together ❤
Very good
Best video
Good
It's a nice one
Take a shot every time Ryland says "girl".
Thumbs up
I put my starbucks cups in the dishwasher even hot and nothing happens to them!
shane   thank you  for   an  idea  for next   halloween  with  the  cookie  cake  casa bonita is  on  my  bucket  list
good
went everywhere but walmart where they always have them lol
The cute little fall festival place in Colorado you guys went to is so much fun! I live near their! I definitely suggest going to Anderson farms by fort Collins! It is sooo much better and when you have the babies they will love it too!!! I promise!
Nice
It sounds like his mom calls him Ryan.
I'm not a dancer, but guuuuurrrlll I'm having a little dance every time that intro comes on
I have a sister named Alexa and she gets to triggered by these Amazon echos  - so changed my Alexa’s to be Hey “Echo” instead…. Extremely helpful!😂
👍
2:00-2:05  is me every day😂👏🏼 Love you guys!
Did y’all check the frozen section or ask an associate! I think those are in the frozen aisle
Very nice video
Good
This is very interesting😂
Where a baby updateeeee!!!!!! ❤
Did Shane get gayer
Shane and Ryland have to fight in every video 😂
I grew up going to Casa Bonita!! Thanks for sharing you sweetie pies! I freaking love you all! :)
Nice post🎉
Ryland seems to be very good-natured ❤ and genuine❤
I COULD NOT FIND THE PUMPKIN COOKIES AT 3 DIFFERENT GROCERY STORES (MULTIPLE LOCATIONS OF THOSE GROCERY STORES!!!) I am so disappointed!
The stove nook is so cute! 🤍
2:45 I’ve been this Shane all month lol
amazing ceremony
best mum in the world, and eventually the best grandma xxxx
Thank you for filming stuff like this. I haven't been home mostly all month and this helps me feel very in the spirit and like I'm not missing out when sometimes it can feel like life is passing me by
I’ll forever kick myself for not getting a pig purse when they were out 😂
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩SHANE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS IS SUCH A MOOD!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Shane's the male version of me when it comes to the nick nacks 😂😂😂
Pickled asparagus is the shizz ❤
Where’s my girl Morgan?!?!
My boyfriend and I live in Highlands Ranch  Colorado and we went to lone creek farms on Thursday and got lost in the corn maze and ended up on the haunted trail where we found a crack head in one of the little shacks on the trail 😂
I put my Starbucks cups in the dishwasher. They seem fine! Also, I was waiting for my Alexa to go off, thankfully she didn’t pick up on it. I think she’s hard of hearing.
Ngl, I wanna go bc it’s pink 😂
Ever since moving to Houston I realized how trash all the food is in Colorado it’s so plain. Especially the Mexican food. Am I wrong 26:45
im dying @ 15:22
shane in his little casa bonita shirt 🥺🥺 he’s SO PRECIOUS
The holiday sugar cookies are usually in the coolers either near the cheese or on the end caps in the coolers. They’re almost never with the other cookies! Omg my OCD when watching this video was crazy lol I would be the friend to ask someone
Its almkst october 31 where is early vlogmas plss do it again
Grown up going here and sooooo excited for the reopening!
I see Vicky is stocked up with Huggies. Bless her 💕
I can’t stand Lizzie 😭 who doesn’t even apologize for hitting someone’s house?
Make Shane do his own dishes 🤨🤦
This is video is good
amazing dive
Nice 👍
Nice one
Wow!  What a surprise))
JUST CAME FROM REMI ASHTON CRUZ’S vlog! They have some at ALDIs RUN SHANE GO BUY SOME
I agree. Ryland bitching about coldness is blah blah blah. Layer up. Y’all are so much happier in Colorado.
I love Shane he never wants to go anywhere but as soon as it’s something he’s fully invested in full on manic mode kicks in 😂😂😂
You all are Lots of fun! 🎉🎃 I LOVE me some Halloween!🎃🧡😄🎃 Love the farm. I like you mask Ryland.👍🏽 The Casa Bonita restaurant looks like lots of fun too!😃 ~Oh… love the Halloween light show! Why didn’t Shane want to see it? Shane, what happened to your Halloween Oogie Boogie spirit?👻😄 ~Thanks for the fun.💜🎃💕
16:38 I love Ryland 😂
Ryland's love towards Riley 💕💕
Its interesting images and video
I thought no one knew of the movie Twister and then Lizzie mentioned it. We love Lizzie and how stunning she looks. That's one of my fav movies and I grew up with it. I am always so excited when Ryland posts because I never know what to expect, lol <3
this is the 1st time ive seen shane so cuddly with ryland, makes me think he is alot but not on camera, cute to see shanes cuddly side
i have put all my starbucks in the dishwasher, nothing ever happened
Love a good vlog 🎉
I haven’t been able to find the Halloween cookies at all this year.
the way id do anything to go to casa bonita
04:57 ryland has some prince charming hair going on
I'm a red headed (Auburn the same shade as Shane's) cancer too sis and I really really really relate to Shane so hard
Tell me why I went to so many diff stores every day of October and never found the f’n pumpkin sugar cookies!! Still never found them but have found the snowman Christmas ones someone please explain
I love you guys so FUCKING much 🤍🤍🤍
Ryland I throw my Starbucks cups in the dishwasher.. I learned From this video that they do say hand wash on the bottom 🙃
Nice
amazing service
Very nice music sound
where is that bear sweat shirt from its so cute!!!!!!
👍
Shane is me when I want to go out and do something fun and go on an adventure and Ryland is my husband!!! I love them so much! <3
I’m just catching up on the episodes I’ve missed- SHANE!!! You’re so right!! This is a core memory. I went to Colorado on a ski trip with my church youth group in APRIL 1994- 9 days of skiing in the beautiful Rocky Mountains of Colorado - I remember maybe 3 days but the very best and most memorable day of that entire trip was the first night in Colorado, we had dinner at Casa Bonita!!! I knew in the thumbnail EXACTLY where you are and what the blog was about! So happy you got to experience this!
Im obsessed with who shanes become ❤
This is why tiktoks can suck if they get too big. Everybody does the trend, then you can't 🤣
Fights with Shane and Ryland real time
I remember going to casa Bonita for my birthdays and just to hang out with family that came into town. When I come back to colorado I will definitely try to go!!
I think those cookies are in the frozen section and that you bake them from frozen so they don’t puff up like that? I could be wrong but I think that’s what I remember
I really love this
Did y’all get something like the baby Brezza for the baby bottles? Because you can’t stick every brand in the dishwasher! I know the boys are coming soon and the amount of bottles you’ll go through will be crazy!
Casa Bonita literally felt like a fever dream lmao
That place looked like fun. Wish I lived closer!
Those cookies will still be incredibly soft when they are done baking but you need to take them out to let them harden up a bit
I was at Casa Bonita last month! So fun!
So Ryland will be the No we don't need that mom! LOL Love it .
This video
Nice vidio
OK Ok You get your Pickled Asparagus and Make Red Neck sushi with it Ok You get sliced hard salami or sliced lunch meat and the better stuff Not that cheap crap I like to use The sun dried tomato turkey sliced up for like sandwiches But I make Red neck sushi with it and EVERYONE at the school get together when I need to bring something or church or parties when I need to being something Everyone always loves it and asks me How Did I come up with it LOL and Well I just say It's something my family has always done but really the truth is I used to be a huge stoner and found out it was so good and I used to call them roll ups because You get a slice of whatever meat and Cream cheese and pickled asparagus and you roll it up together and slice it so you have bite size roll ups that kinda look like a piece of sushi and It is always a hit People love it LOL and it is because I was really high one night and I used to love cream cheese with hard salami and a friend of mine was making pickled everything and she made pickled asparagus Well she came over and I was standing in the kitchen munching on cream cheese and salami and she said taste this and I have never found pickled asparagus better than that jar she gave me that time years ago but I have found a brand that is pretty good called Napoleon Pickled green asparagus that is the best one that I can find in stores LOL The jar is small but it tastes the best
I would drop EVERYTHING if Shsne invited me somewhere 😭
I love y'all sm
U WATCH ORDINARY ADVENTURES OMG MY FAVS
I feel like I’m the only person who doesn’t like lizzy 🙈
Omg Shane looks so fit, he's lost so much weight.  Good on ya
Nice
Wait I'm so confused aren't they married already?
why must yall eat on camera...  the NOISE...
vicki is my favorite ever. i love how she acts just like one of ur guys friends and is so silly with u! precious
Girl I have lived in Colorado all my life so don’t be a big woman and talk about our weather in Colorado 💅💅💅
I'm with Shane! I also have an OBSESSION with my reusable Starbucks cups 😆
I love this! And next Halloween you’ll have two little bundle of joys to do this with. 🧸🧸🩵🩵
I promise you can put the Starbucks cups in the dishwasher. I have always put them in the bottom of my dishwasher (lids in the top) and haven’t had any issues. Only the straw needs hand washed
Hey, seriously love these videos
Verygood
Girl I throw all my cups in the dish washer 😂
Nice
I feel so bad for Ryland. He does everything and Shane: does nothing, treats him like shit, makes him look like a woman whenever he can, and actively flirts with another person in front of him. I’m sick of it. There’s no way he’s gonna help with the twins. I wish Ryland knew his worth
i can feel it in my soul mama that this may be the start of shane and rylands horror movie soon
We went to casa Bonita right before COVID hit and it was in rough shape, we’ll have to go again now that they’ve renovated
You’re doing so amazing! I can’t even imagine your chaos scheduling. Love your energy! Can’t wait for the next 😁❤️
“That was alot of blah blah blah and we need alot more oogie boogie boogie” I LOVE SHANE 😭💙
You guys need to try making cookies from scratch, and when you put the batter onto the pan thing you put those pumpkin cookies from the video on top of them and when they expand and bake, CHEFS KISS 💋
HI GUYS
I love seeing all of your family and how much love surrounds you both! Your little ones are going to be adored. Wish Morgan made a feature 😂
Pickled asparagus wrapped in deli ham with cream cheese 😋
What was the 50 million dollar surprise
me who puts my starbucks cups in the washing machine 😬
Coolies need to set for 5 minutes then transfer 😂
Ok, but he was cutting the onion etc on the same board as the raw chicken 😭
The five below cups suck they they break so easily 😢😢
Your hair is fine lol
The fact that that PINK PALACE was next to a dollar tree is cracking me up
I bought 6 boxes of the pumpkin cookies because once Tik tok blew up they’re all sold out everywhere
If you’ve never had Graeters French Pot Ice Cream made in Cincinnati, OH you’re missing out. S’mores is my personal favorite but the Pumpkin tastes EXACTLY like pumpkin pie and is hands down the best pumpkin flavored item I’ve had. You guys must try! Some stores like Kroger carry them but I highly suggest just ordering them online and having them shipped to you.
I had looked away for a second when ya'll were tasting the ice cream, and your mom sounded exactly like Morgan. :O I looked back really quick cause I thought maybe she had some into the kitchen. :P Your family is the cutest.
I was low key sad you guys didnt make a cheesecake out of the cookies lol. Cookie crust 🤤. Love watching yall❤
Ryland without Shane, please, just once……
Vlogaween
RY RY RY DO A TRY ON HAUL FOR THE MEN SKIMS
lizzie gives such emma stone/jennifer lawrence vibes it’s crazy
I put my Starbucks cups in the washing machine. And they are all fine.
SHANEEEEEEE I got to see oogey boogy wow i butchered that but I watched him in his prime 3D at the theaters last night 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
First off, love y'all to pieces. Secondly, use a bottle brush to clean your Starbeez cups! I always have like 5 laying around because i have an 8 month old. I have designated one bottle brush as my Starbeez cup brush. It cleans it in a jiffy. ❤❤
Shane's outfit is looking gooooooood. We say yes to colour :)
Most of the pumpkins aren’t real..
The moment from 13:23 to 13:36 is literally so SO cute 😭😭😭
But did the food get better at Casa Bonita?
Ok 27:26  Time to turn OFF!!
I miss the Mayan. Went there with my school one year.
Interesting
I Love this fun Video
Ryland you have a great family & you are such a good husband & friend ❤loved this video with your mum & grandma in it ❤
Roman came out of shane @15:21 😂😂😂😂
Nice video
Lol You’re never in the ghetto side of Colorado 😂😂
Life hack: use a “baby bottle” cleaner wand to clean your reusable cups you will be needing one anyway (; love the vlog and anything spooky season (can we make a vlogmas for Halloween a thing) ? Lol
I first became of Ryland and Shane cause Of Clevvertv and now to see them as fans of one my fave YouTubers aka @stephpappas makes me so happy! Love you guys 🩷
I wish these were 3 hours long. Fr
2:45 shane is too funny. Yall are adorable. 😂❤
i CANNOT believe this was mostly filmed like 5 MINUTES up the street from me!! i love you guys with everythingggggg XOXO
I really wish we could see bump update pictures since your surrogate said she'd feel comfortable being on camera. Like her face doesn't even have to show if she didn't want it to be. Hopefully we will get to meet her once the babies are born 🥹
Always cook Pillsbury cookies for less time than they say by like a minute or two. They’ll continue to cook a bit after you pull them out.
Buckley is soooo cute i just love her eyes! So femenine looking 😊😊😊
This is nice making any activities that involves family is nice even when they get aggressive lol cute💚💚💚💚
Good video nice time
90*s rock
The amount of times I've skipped making my morning coffee just cuz I didnt want to wash the friken cups 😅 we get it Ryland we do !!
👀 anyone else still put your cups in the dishwasher regardless?
So not long ago the dentist I work for was talking about casa Bonita. The one in Oklahoma since that’s where I’m from. I just found out it started here in Oklahoma! Crazy. I’ve never gone. Now I wanna go.
I thought the Mayan was a fever dream! No one else ever remembers it 😂
I’m sorry Ryland that shane never wants to go do things with you and wants to just be home all day
The hair Ry gorg
Y’all used a casserole dish instead of a cookie sheet. 😂
I just love watching u and Shane together your both so funny together ❤ I can’t wait for you both to be parents your going to be the best dads ever ❤
You only bake those cookies for 9 minutes. They look undone/soft when you take them out but key to being soft. And then you let sit for some time and they harden up to a normal cookie texture.
A “fall thing”… better known as a pumpkin patch?? ☠️🤣🤣
shane is literally me during spoopy season! my bf is always over it lmaoo
Swear you guys weren’t tipsy half way through 😂❤
Cicis such good pizza.
I can't afford to try all these festive things so I'll just live vicariously through y'all
Damn she for sure is a Karen asffffff She accused her neighbor for hitting her car without even knowing. That’s wild 🤯
I didn't know the guy with the green mug still relevant and in trending? No hate here but he something stupid before right?
You guys are the reason I believe in love
Very nice video
Is there going to be a get ready to decorate the nursery. Or getting ready for the twins arrival soon?...
Yall gotta let the cookies cool~♡
They put the cookies out in August. I legit bought 8 packs of the ghost print and the pumpkin print and put them in the freezer. By the second week of October, you couldn't find them anywhere! That's why I stocked up.
"You're just not good at spreading" relate
I aS getting. SUPERLUV Vibe from Shane when he put the Halloween cutout on and took a selfie
Oh my gosh!!! I was literally at Casa Bonita this past Friday,it was quite the experience to say the least!!! 🤣
She's so fn obnoxCIOUS!  and so PROUD of it ugh.
If you keep buying more reuseable cups, i say fuck it & throw them in the dishwasher ?? Like, who cares if they get messed up, you're gonna keep buying new designs anyways... Can't girlboss with all that hand washing 💅🏻
That restaurant is like a Pancho's on steroids !!
The way the roles are reversed - in Colorado, Shane wants to go out and Ryland wants to stay in. In California, Ryland wants to go out and Shane stays in!
Ryland is my sister about my Starbucks cup obsession 🤣 But I have to agree…they NEED to make them dishwasher safe
i am going to watch shane and ryland for real for the rest of my life they will always be relevant
Thank you Shane and Ryland for inspiring me to make the hubby a dessert tonight. ❤
Omg y'all should of done vlogtober until Halloween!!! Walmart always has those cookies!!!!
Ahhhh so fun! Loved this and you guys ❤
Walmart has them
please stop using the blaccent and like language girls use you've been gay your whole life now all of a sudden you act extra fucking gay PLEASE stop saying "gurrll" it's really cringe
I need MORE of the alpaca’s 🦙
"ALEXA STOP!" 😂😂😂
hehe shane’s in his oggie boogie era
shane is MEEEE!!! and my fiancé is ryland, just smiling along 😭🤣 i love shane’s energy you can just tell he’s so much lighter and happier 🫶🏼
Ryland is such a fall girlie and Shane js such a Halloween girlie. I love it
Shane looks like he lost weight looks extra pretty👑🍁
You could use a muffin pan for individual cookies
So is Morgan no longer in the vibe? I miss her in the vlogs.
Not the mark on the house being like the smallest thing ever compared to Lizzie’s car LMFAO
How do you not know that you hit a house?
i love vicki!!!! i want to be just like her when im a mom!!
Amazing video i like 50million $ oh no its your city i love it and your presentation i like it
As a mom who frequently purchases those cookies simply for the nostalgia of them…you gotta buy them in September and freeze them lol. Stores only get one round of them and then they’re gone until the next holidays batch. 😫
I love this video 🥺
I recommend getting the glass Dr browns bottles because you can stick those in the dishwasher. But I’m two years in an im still hand washing sippy cups daily.
rip the mayan i grew up going there and the best moments w my grandma were there
Sandwich cookie idea low key your on to something there it just needs to be perfected
When shane said “this place would be a core memory for a child.” Is absolutely right. I live in Oklahoma and us eating at Casa Bonita is one of my earliest memories I have. Still so sad that it was shut down. 😢
Try the icecream cookie sandwich at Christmas time! Have little Christmas tree cookies!
His rant against starbucks cups 😂
The edit on this video 🔥🔥
my name is abbie and i love being represented by the princess alpaca 😌😌😌🥰🥰
The genuine love between you two is just so beautiful ❤
You guys are so freaking cute I can’t take it !!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love how far Shane has come.
it’s not that i hate Lizzie but i found her very suffocating when ahe talk.
My best friend Jessica was your server ♡
I absolutely love your playful interaction, you boys are going to have so much fun lol.
I don’t get the title, but loved the vlog anyway!
Shane is Meee 😂
I love when all of you are together 🫶🏽😄🙃
Ryland Cut your hair lol.. you know you can't do the long hair.. were not going back to your Justin Bieber days
I swear you guys could film a video of doing absolutely nothing. Just walking around the house and talking all day. And I would still be here to watch It. I love you guys so much.
You can wash them in the dishwasher. You just can't use heated dry mode. Fyi.
ryland has official overkilled the word Mamas ._.
is it just me or does Ryland look extra good in this vlog ! like his hair is perfect and his skin is glowing 🤩
Is it bad I can't wait for vlogmas 😂❤
😂😂😂😂 the first 3 minutes Shane is literally my asd toddler  as soon as she eats off the bus from school. “I want to see spookies!!” This girl lives at spirit Halloween all october
"there's no but" ahahaha
"cow"
OMG, I miss going to that place when I was little. We used to go to it when I was a child. At least I think that is what it was called, it could be a different place but very similar. It was in Colorado. I just can't remember what it was called and where it was, but we loved going to that place 😊
I literally live right next to Casa Bonita. I worked at that Ross lmfao. It’s crazy to see y’all so close to me
Tell me why the squeaking of the oven scared the hell out of me 😂😂
I’ve been on the waiting list for months and I can’t wait to be invited to go
I don’t see much appreciation for Lizzie in these comments! She’s hilarious and I love how she’s just down for whatever she adds so much to these vlogs! ❣️
never been so happy to own a prius then to be matching with lizzie😏🖤🖤🖤🖤
❤❤❤❤
"The 1900s"? Gimme a break. And then you didn’t show it.
6 ON TRENDING!!!!
Growing up in Utah the restaurant was called Rainforest Cafe. They shut down I think in 2010? It was my favorite restaurant ever!
I love you guys 🤣🤣😭
Them fighting the whole baking part 🤣🤣
I love lizzy !!!!!
I want to go with you guys too.
I was screaming at the tv!! I love those cookies and you HAVE to undercook them because they cook a little more when sitting on the hot pan. Also they aren’t placed by the normal cookie dough they’re usually in the seasonal area ❤
It’s so odd not seeing Morgan. I missed her lol
I effin love lizzie Gordon ❤️ 😂
Ryland please stop saying girl 🥹
You should check out Anderson farms in Colorado very fall!!!
in mexico alot of the houses are like casa bonita!! they’re usually very bright and colorful!! casa bonita actually reminds me sorta of a church in the local town i visit 😁
Casa Bonita is basically a super renovated Pancho’s on crack iykyk lol
We luv u guys 🎃🕸️🖤 but for the love of God please stop putting lizard in ur videos ruins ur vibe! Too rough. Xoxo
You just unlocked a memory for me, I’m pretty sure I’ve been to Casa Bonita when I was a kid visiting CO!
THE AWARD FOR THE MOST CLICKBAIT VIDEO goes to RYLAND WOW 😂😂😂😂😂
Why does rylands mom call him Ryan
I think those cookies are usually on an end cap not with all the other cookie dough 😭 I was holding my breath hoping you’d look around more lol
I was looking for the same pumpkin cookies at my Fry’s local grocery store and they don’t have it either? They’ve already got turkeys for Thanksgiving and Buddy the elf… But no freaking pumpkins?! No ma’am.!!!
I was all my Starbucks cups in the dishwasher and haven’t had any problems !!!
It’s best to leave cookies to cool before moving them
Y’all really need to try the sweet Loren’s cookies. The chocolate fudge is delicious.
Why do I find myself dancing to y’all’s theme music every time?! Love it Ryland! Keep it up boo-boo ❤❤❤
Your mom calling you rayan gives me the FUCKING ICK.
Does Shane ever see his mum? Seems like it’s always your family, unless she does t wanna be on camera. Just hopefully they’re still talking.
The energy in this video is amazing. I love you and Shane so much and I love how sweet and supportive Vicky is!! You are my faves 🩷🥹👏🏼
Looks like Whoville.
Shane and Ryland love each other so much and I want to cry watching them be like this🥹 so happy they have each other
Shane is looks SLIM HUNNY 👏🏻❤️
Im glad im not the only one you cant find those damn cookies
I don't get the hype about Steph , she's so basic and generic 😂 literally just like any other food reviewer lol
why is morgan not in your vlogs anymore?
Shane!!!! You can’t walk around with oogie boogie WITHOUT seeing the movie!! It’s my all time favorite, pleaseeeeee watch it!!! K bye 😊😊🎃
You trending girl..
Is all of this in Calofornia or Colorsdo?
May I please just spend one Thanksgiving or Christmas with y’all and the family?? Paalease?
9 on trending but let's get it higher ❤
I make decent music
Omg I love your hair Shane! Yass KING!
Yes girl I love Shane he's so sweet 😋
I have been to Casa Bonita, glad to see it open again.
29:49 I'm sorry Lizzy but you're totally lying!! 😂😂😂 How do you not know that you hit a concrete house? She knew 😂😂😂 and she's trying so hard to make excuses of how she didn't have any idea and it's not working because when you lie, nothing makes sense! 😂😂😂
Why did u go blast your neighbors omgggg 😅 secondhand embarrassed lol
I did not think that chapstick was chapstick. 😅
I couldn’t find any of the pumpkin cookies either!! I’ve only seen elf & turkeys!
Shane with the Starbucks cups is me 😅…I have a collection myself lol
We remember all of the Alpaca names. Mama 1. Mama 2. Mama 3. Mama 4. Mama 5. Mama 6. and Mama 7. 🤣🤣
I always wondered who is cleaning this sparkly Starbuck cups at your house  😂😂😂😂
My Alexa normally goes off this time is didn’t I think mine is sleeping 😂 good thing
Y’all are getting my Alexa going 😂😂
I grew up going to Casa Bonita. Kissed my first boy in the spooky cave where the scary gorilla thing was 😂
YOU SET OFF MY ALEXA!!! lol I had to cancel the timer!
Lol I’m a baker watching shane try to pickup those hot cookies with a spatula traumatized me. It turned out kinda cute though
I love Rylan with the long hair looks hot 😂😊
Casa Bonita looks so fun. I love that they have Cartman there
I’m Shane 😂😍
stop uploading please <3
all you had to do was let the cookies cool off and they would harden guys 😭😂 sending love from IL
all you had to do was let the cookies cool guys 😭😂 sending love from IL
all you had to do was let the cookies cool guys 😭😂 sending love from IL
Ahhh I want to go to casa Bonita so bad!!!
I went to nights of the Jacks when they reopened from the vid and it’s really cool 🎃
Thank you for this video ❤️
literally the pillsbury pumpkin cookies have been in NO stores around me either )):
These were the last drinks I had before knowing I was pregnant and yes they were STRONG. Shane should do a video on casa bonita conspiracies!
"That was alot of blah blah blah and we need more oogie boogie boogie" 😂 2:02
the fact that there is a perfect 7 alpacas….. i’d name them after the 7 dwarfs 🤣🤣🤣🤣
When Shane said “look whaat little Deborah is bringing for fall” I cackled 😂
18:09 Ryan is a whole vibe "I'm doing this in my own next time" ❤ how something's be lol
I wonder if there is a place like that in Texas
What kind of partner is Shane? If my girlfriend wanted to go see sunsets I would say heck yeah without hesitation. You deserve better Ryland!
I love how Vickie said she was embarrassed of ryland when he had the pumpkin mask on but when Shane had it on she laughed like it was cute 😂😂 love their relationship!!
Love your mother for not knowing the name of that leech of a person and a rapper. I would've kissed her right there.
Ryland, just be like the rest of us lazy people and stick those cups in the dishwasher. Mine have all be fine 😂
I’ve lived in Colorado most of my life and I’ve never been to casa Bonita, but I do know it was infamous for having the worst possible food lol. Everyone makes jokes about it.
i'm in need of an update on the babies!!
Cold and cloudy = exercising, outside work, etc. without sweating to death lol!
Casa Bonita IS a core memory of my childhood!! 🩷🩷🩷
1900s ?!?! What 😂😂😂😂  I’m offended 😂😂😂
Never heard of it but damn looks like the coolest place $
Shane wants to go on season adventures in Colorado but in California he wants to stay home
i wanna go to casa bonita soooo bad
If Shane wants to keep his pumpkin all year round once painted. Coat it in clear gloss afterwards, 2-3 coats. That baby will keep up fooorrreeevveerrrr!! 🎃
I need u two , to do a cooking thing BLINDLY like no recipes .. something off of The try guys! Not knowing how to make something but based off what u would think would be how its made like i neeed THAT
I wash my Starbucks cups in the dishwasher lol bottom rack.
I love when ryland calls his alpacas “mamas” SO cute
Shane cares about the pigs ❤❤❤❤ I love that so much ❤❤❤
Lol clearly this is your first time driving the opposite direction down Parker road 😅 love that place
I need longer vlogs!!!!
The baby diapers in the background 🥹💙🩵
Your hairline is not bad but the long hair makes it look worse it highlights the peaks and the weight of it pulls and shows more of your scalp. The key is a more structured hair cut.
Jokes on you guys I have a google 🙄🤣🥰
You guys have something against kings 🥹
10:27 the diapers 🥹
Everyone knows once those sugar cookies cool they become crunchy, why are they saying they cooked them too long?
You were so close to where I live!
I get so much serotonin every time Ryland calls something “mama”
Ahhh I live where nerdy nuts is made. And graduated with the owner!!
Shane is like a very happy kid who is opening his presents or something and that is great!
These vlogs literally make my day! I live vicariously through Ryland & Shane. Much love! Will support forever 💗🫶🏼
“That was a lot of blah blah blah, and we need a lot more oogie boogie boogie.” My new fall quote lmfao
Funny story about Casa Bonita, when I was a toddler I lived in Colorado and I shoved my head in between one of bars in the line and got my head stuck and my dad had to basically rip me out of it 😂. And I STILL want to go back!!
Lizze is legit my best friend who reversed Into my mailbox sorry if I spent your name wrong love all of youse/ Corey burmaz
You guys could totally try that at Christmas time with the Christmas sugar cookies, Christmas ice cream/sprinkles. Just a thought 😏 keep being awesome! Love the vlogs.
Your vlogs are so amazing thank you for all the work and effort you put into these I love you all ❤❤❤
Going to Casa Bonita is actually a core memory I have as a child 😂❤
so much bickering 🙈
The South Park casa Bonita episode is so goodb
Ryland for Halloween you should get Shane the Dracula squishmallow with the secret candy pocket
The intro!!
My coworker’s family owns Lone Creek farms!! So cool!
I love how ryland lets Lizzie live her childhood with no judgment
when Shane said "omg I'm that light" after Ryland threatened to throw him out the window, sent me 😂😂
Shane… stop buying Starbucks cups. They are over priced garbage. It doesn’t keep your drinks cold for more then 4hours. Get a real tumbler cup that actually keeps things cold for over 12 hours!!
Always happy when you post
I couldn't find any of the cookies this year either. 😢
Me and Shane have the same obsession. Tumblers and mugs!!!!
You always have to do 2 minutes less then the recomended time on the box.
Every time I watch one of your vlogs my little one gets up l, stares at the TV and she dances to your intro❤️ it warms my heart so much😊
Literally my comfort videos
Didn’t know there would be a jump scare so early on in the video ….lmao I literally DIE LAUGHING every time I see that  Animal Crossing costume come up 🤣🤣💀💀
Hear me out: ice cream sandwich with ritz crackers and vanilla ice cream… my husband SWEARS by them and they are amazing
Genuinely I love seeing Shane and Ryland so happy and living life. 18:04 was just the cutest moment in the whole video. I can see their genuine smiles and that in turn makes me so happy.
Sheriff is giving Tammy vibes 😂
Omg Shane is so smart😂 I been wanting a slime cup but didn’t think to get it from eBay or Etsy duhhhh. Thanks for the idea 😂❤️
Shane wants to go out and wear costumes and be around people. Ryland wants to stay home and snuggle Riley. Did Ryland and Shane switch places?? 😂
I adore you Shane ❤ Rylands energy was off in this video, I hope he's ok, positive vibes x
Those damn cups!  I haaaate hand washing🤷‍♀️
Vicki is an icon!! She just ended Jay Z career in a couple of words 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jesus christ lizze is smth else 😂
COME TO DADE CITY IN FLORIDA !! AND COME TO SCREAM-A-GEDDON !! Im a actor there and we have scary houses that you can walk through !! And we have interactive ones as well !!! We're we can touch you !!!
I grew up going to casa bonita!  Giving the big Gorilla sophapillas was always a must.
To anyone reading this you are so so loved and Jesus loves you! ❤
I’ve never seen a place that is so perfect for a Shane wedding 😂
Lizzie being that bad of a driver that she hit the FKING house for no reason, it not funny it's legit terrifying.
I couldn't find those cookies this year either. They went viral and everybody bought them up
I love this! ❤ I love you guys so much. Stay safe. Drive safe.
I love Rylands dad so much ❤ He’s just so wholesome 🥹
“Alexa, stop” 😂
More food videos. Fuck man this is really starting to suck. I watched every single week (multiple times!!) and can’t even get through one episode. People are entertained by a lot of things, but watching you guys eat,chew, and swallow food is not one of them. Make this a patreon thing or something.
Lizzie saying “cow” 😂
I agree with you 100% ryland I'm basically everything you said in this video but especially when it's cold out not wanting to do anything
Hey I think of it has everything on a screen is a show to me lol 😅
3:14 The way you feel about Riley is the way I feel about my golden boy Kobe 🥹
Shane, you really need to watch The Nightmare Before Christmas. Oogie Boogie is NOT cute 😂😂😂😂 does anyone who actually has seen the movie think he's cute? I don't want to give spoilers so I won't say what he does or tries to do to a certain someone in the movie, but let's just say it's definitely not cute. Oogie Boogie is kind of a big ole perv...
Rylands hair is giving Scott Disick chic
Shane is lookin great !!
Shane: "That was a lot of blah, blah, blah. We need a lot more oogie, boogie, oogie."  ROFL  I love seeing Shane getting excited about spooky season, especially with the Starbucks cup and Oogie. He's going to be such a fun, loving, and cool dad to the twins. Ryland will be good too, because the both of them make a great power team together.
Ryland get the cup cleaning attachment for your sink. You flip the cup over and it jets water to clean the inside. It would save you so much time hand washing starbucks cups.
I will never get tired of watching your videos and Shane’s 🥺❤️ watching y’all’s videos since day one makes me happy
There was a shortage of those cookies this year, so literally no stores got the little cookies for Halloween, but we did get some for thanksgiving! :)
This is Shane’s season! So happy to see him so happy ❤
I went to three stores and I couldn’t find those cookies either! But my fiancé found those that had a turkey on them (not the halloween ones)
You guys are my comfort people
2:39 ITS THE FINAL FALL BEFORE THE BOYS!! NEXT YEAR IS GOING TO BE THE BEST ❤❤❤❤❤
Ryan and Shane you guys are my favorite no matter what…BUT YOU NEED TO WATCH NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS PLEASE. The oggie boogie man was my childhood
Casa Bonita is so iconic .. I went in the 1970s and went for dinner before prom there ! So fun .  Loved the pet at the end “ I’ll be here for Christmas wearing one of your babies” It’s happening soon !!
Y'all are not alone, I haven't seen the sugar cookie dough anywhere..... and I didn't even know about the cheesecake recipe. Now I absolutely need them to make it. Hopefully, they magically manifest in stores.
Omg Shane looks amazing
How many times u have to say my husband?
Shane and ryland could run me over with their gwagon and I would say thank you
I love this vlog yay it brightened my day
santa monica cayons is where my best friend crash his car and sadly passed away at the age of 17 and i miss him more than anything it happened augs 26th 2005 at 5:30 am
Vicki is down to do anything lol everyone is sleeping and she’s like “they should be up helping us” like go Vicki 🎉 it’s probably so late 😂
Literally the most excited I’ve seen Shane, to go out.
I’m with Mom, I don’t know who he is either. I’m not with the time’s either. I don’t pay attention to all those things either. I’m almost 48 and don’t pay attention to how is married to who and so on. I’m not into music of now a days. Lol. I love how Shane get’s so excited like a little kid. I love you guys so much. I love those fall cupcakes and brownies. I need to get some of those. I’ve been out of work for medical reasons and I have to be very careful because i lost 54 lbs and I don’t want to gain it back. I still want to get those though. I so much love your Alpaca’s so much. ❤
Aww i didnt realise one of the llamas shared my name 😂I 😂😂
I Love Ryland's hair
She's a million dollar babe
You guys hung with Steph & DIDNT DO A MUKBANG WITH HER 😭😭 my 3 favorite YouTubers 😍
Hell yes good my kebab n coke ready😂🎉
Rylands mum and shane are the duo u needed
shane and ryland were so sweet this vlog. the teasing and tickling makes me feel like i'm watching two teenagers fall in love
Where is Morgan!? 😔 I miss her so bad in your vlogs i wish she was in more family gatherings with you all
I missed the 50 million part
Shane with his 2006 Bieber flip is giving Ryan shit about his hair 😂😂 I love how they absolutely roast eachother ❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
Like for the Boston Terrier dish towel on oven!!! Where’s OLIVER?!?!!!!!
You have to give balenciaga a new name please !!!!!😢
Has Shane lost weight? I noticed it in the last video too. He looks great 😊
Lmao ryland was right, alexa did go off in my house😂
Watching this before going to a local pumpkin patch later with my family so excited 😊🎃 and its my birthday on Halloween 🖤🦂♏ im in the spooky spirit wooo!
I loveeeee when i see notification from ryland and shane.   But also, why is morgan not on ur videos for 2 3 videos? Maybe because she's bz with her house?
Buy the license plate cover that’s awesome
You can use the volume button to take pictures, Shane 🤣
a wedding vlog there would be EVERYTHING!!
anyone else miss morgan in this 😂❤
the pumpkin cookie dough ur looking for is at WALMART !!!👻🎃🎃🎃
Imagine diving in a pool all day/night at work. I can't decide if its fun or exhausting. Lol
Ryland is more a summer person Shane’s a winter person and I’m on Shane’s side I hate the heat I live cozy cold crisp weather ❄️❄️❄️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️
this is my favourite time, chilling, eating breakfast and watching your new video 😭 could be doing this for hoursss ❤
Omg Ryland so this weekend me and my sister decided to have a spooky night so we went to our local grocery store for snacks and the pillsbury cookies and they already had all the CHRISTMAS cookies out so we were like omg but we wanna be spooky it’s too early for Xmas 😭 LUCKILY they had orange turkeys for thanksgiving so we settled for those 😂🦃🧡
I just love seeing you in Ralph Lauren there is a new fall Baer sweater that you absolutely need
Ryan was a little spicy this vlog hahahhaa
Omg, that takes me back to being a  kid. I always had so much fun there
The Mayan was the absolute best! I went there for my birthday one year 🎉
I grew up going to Casa Bonita!! This brings back so many memories for me, I'm so glad you filmed the reno so people can see how magical it is
they're not dishwasher safe??  should i be concerned?
I love how Vicki thought oogie boogie must be a rapper lol
You guys should make a dessert holiday cookbook together 😊
i painted and varnish sealed my pumpkins and they lasted 3-4 years so it can happen :)))
This is so scripted
“They should be up helping us!” SENT ME 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love when you guys are in my city I go to that same Safeway all the time.
Lizzie crashing into  Ryland and Shanes' house. Reminds me of Lady Gaga crashing into Mark Ronson car. On her Netflix documentary.
23:21 my Alexa timer went off.
I feel like only Walmart sells those cookies
Rylands hair is looking amazing
Omg Lizzie liked a food!
You guys should both dress as pregnant women for Halloween since you’re expecting two babies 😂 Orrrr just dress as like a stereotypical dad, my husband did that for his very first Father’s Day this year and it was hilarious!
Something about Lizzie I dislike SO much.
You can only like this if your Alexis went off.... hahaha
There all over Walmart
if you turn the heat dry off on your dishwasher your cups won’t melt!!!
My son lives two streets over on 13th. We see Casa Bonita from his balcony.
Lol not the click bate 😂😂😂
shane is me with starbucks cups and ryland is my boyfriend. he hates hand washing and we totally want them dishwasher safe
I want to be as excited about literally anything the way Shane is 🥹
lmboo Shane is a mood 😂😂
First I’m a Colorado native grew up in Wheat Ridge so like maybe a 10 minute drive to it. Is the gorilla still there, and how was the food? Lol and the area it’s in smh not good lol (Shane a twisters used to be over there back in the early 2000s). Also I’ve found the cookies y’all been looking for at a Thorton Walmart lol.
Yeah Shane should stop with those cups especially since it’s sounds like Ryland is the one who cleans them 😵‍💫 And if you hate cleaning a million of those a million baby bottles will only add to it
Omg I’m Jelly! My Brother tried to get us In For my Birthday this last summer but we didn’t get and email back! We grew up going to Casa Bonita and I cant wait  to be able to see all the renovations! I live in Texas now but my parents still live in Parker Colorado and when I found out y’all where moving to Parker my little heart was so excited! Every time I go back home I pray I will run into y’all! Lol . I’m been a fan of Shane for years and of course have fallen In Love with ryland and now a fan of him too 🥰 it’s neat seeing y’all in Colorado and I’m so happy for the life y’all are building out there. Maybe one day I will run into y’all 🤞🏼
How did she not know she hit your house!? LMAO...😂😂 It was pretty clear.
that doesn’t look like chapstick
Watching this for the 3rd time. 😊
Ryland, your vlogs always make my day 💯% better! 🫶🏽
ur hair looks so good and you've literally been glowing recently fr😭😭
So every store is sold out of those Pilsbury cookies 😭
I think Shane would die over the Oogie Boogie build a bear 😁 love your vlogs! Live for these weekly.
That stove door was screaming for help😂
my alexia set a timer and scared me.
Ugh something Ryland is doing is not working. He like had something done to his face which is making him look like a real housewife who went to Tijuana for a bogo cosmetic procedure, that with the Karen cut is just not the vibe babe. Still love you soo much.
I suffer from extreme anxiety particular health anxiety and yours and Shane’s vlogs help me so much everyday. You’re like sunshine and keep my brain occupied.🥺💛🫶🏼
When Shane says “they’ve seen it they know what it is” and it’s true, I have seen it and I do know what it is 💀
This is insane I love South Park and to see casa Bonita makes me so happy. I love all of your videos and you and Shane are couple goals ❤️
I love when Shane woahed
6:30 is my husband and I 🤣😭😭😭
So keen for a baby update.
The way Vicky said “my team at work” 👉🏼👈🏼🥲 but I’ve also been in the same situation
I miss that Morgan doesn’t pop in on your vlogs hardly anymore.
Classic Ryland clickbait. I knew it would be and I knew I would love it. Btw did we really need to see Ryland cuddling with Riley? YES!
does anyone why Morgan not on vlogs with them like that anymore ? Curious
Excellent vlog !   Ryland is looking super hot theses days.   It’s the hair.  Love it
These episodes are so amazing and magical.  Great production quality too, keep up the good work and thank you for this entertainment <3
11:41 that ice cream looks so good
@14:29 This is so cute ? It's a jar, bro... What are you even on about. It's quite literally just a jar
THE CLICK BAITTT LOLOLOL 2 GROWN GAY MEN USING CLICK BAIT and conspiracy theories for there jobs and careers lol this is so sad to see. When will these guys ever grow up 😂😂 I’m just here because my wife watches and I think this is so funny. What are the point of these videos, you make a living off of other peoples stuff. The theories are other peoples not Shane’s…and he is still using click bait. Aye, his view numbers still dropped and he is still insecure so keep supporting the Shane y’all think you know lol
Oh my god!!! I used to go to Casa Bonita every time we would visit my grandparents in CO! It’s so nostalgic for me! This gave me such a serotonin boost!🥹
VICKI NOT KNOWING JAY Z KILLED ME
Please do an episode of year end shyland black holes! You get a back hole ...you get a black hole!
i dont believe they love each other.. if they did they would both be honest with each other regarding how their hair looks..
That icecream is fire!!! It tastes just like pumpkin pie and it has chunks of crust, whip cream, and pumpkin!!! Its top tier seasonal pumpkin!!!!! 🎃🎃🎃🎃
Ryland you should stop washing those and just make Shane wash them himself 😮‍💨
I was hoping for  another haunted video this year, like maybe the cheesman park downtown or something
Ryland you are the best Alpaca daddy!! I love how you call them your mamas!!!
... starbucks cups aren't machine washable???? ...... oops
I love how far Shane has come. I love seeing him excited for things and getting out there and doing stuff and how happy he is. You truly brought him to life which when you are dealing with mental health issues it feels impossible and it’s a battle to deal with and get out of. I’m living for this era of him
Am I the only one who thought there was an urn behind them ?
Pea Soup Andersen’s VS Rainforest Cafe VS Disneyland?
The 1900's kills me every time. 😢
Awww shane excitement is the cutest. ❤ ryland you are so loving and caring towards your pets 😊 love it! You guys always  brighten my day. Ryland would love to see a cooking video its been a while...  Much love to you both, love you guys!
❤@SHANE AND RYAN ALSO VICKY, 👍💀🎃👹👿👻🏚️⚰️👽👺🎃💀 HAPPY HALLOWEEN 🎃👻
greenwood village safeway where i live has 50% off starbs cups ;) in case shane wants one hahaha
I wish they would re-open our Casa Bonita here in Tulsa, OKLAHOMA 😊 I just love watching y'all ❤
I use to agree with you, but now that I realized and JUST heard one of your amulets are named BALENCIAGA I HATE YOU! I hope you are not 'elite" Pedofile status!!!!
ooop here comes Shane about to make casa bonita his whole personality for the next month or 2 before he moves on to something else
I’m seeing Shane’s vision about the thing he wants to make
I love that Lizze is still sticking to the I confronted my neighbor bit when she admitted on the podcast that didn’t happen 😂😂😂 I laughed SO HARD at that part of the podcast so I remember it well
I love that you always bring ryland mom along when go on shopping adventure and make something you guys are so cute 🥰
As a major southpark fan I’m dying😭😭
I don’t get why Shane always makes Ryland tag along, do things, and goes places he wants, yet Shane NEVER wants to do anything Ryland wants to do or go. Like bro didn’t even want to go to the pumpkin patch. You can’t blame everything on “anxiety.” 😂
Literally shitty place to eat tho lol cool atmosphere
We started off:  Shane's anxiety that spooky season needed exploring to end of video Shane won't go to Halloween display. Huh? 😮
I’m getting a apartment soon I’m so happy
Next time freeze them before you serve them.
As an Alexa, I can say I’ve already subscribed
Love you both so much. Please never change. I can’t wait for you both to give us babies update. Xoxo ❤️💜
Shane and his cups is much like me and mine and my partner 1000% feels the way ryland does.
You know when people think baggy clothes will help hide their fat?   Well bald people do the same thing by growing their hair.  It just accentuates your downfalls.
Vicki using age as an excuse for not knowing Jay Z is hilarious when they're only like 6 years apart
Bro, you seriously don’t put the cups in the dishwasher!? I put all of mine in there… I feel like that’s part of reason for the little knob, the bottom of the straw…
The more and more I look at this place, this would be a great place for a wedding. Your family & Guest would have a great time! Has it been rented out yet? Rent it! You will regret it if you do not Shane Dawson, the Universe says do it! Suprise everyone! Keep it a secret till the day!😮 👏 👏 I like surprises!
Guys! When you bake cookies you gotta let them cool so they can harden. Once cool you can grab them no poblem
Ryland those Starbucks cups are easy get ready for the baby bottles!!! 😩😂❤️
Ryland is 100%- Starbucks needs to make their cups machine washable YESTERDAY. 😡
🤵‍♂️ & 🤵‍♂ location for a wedding 🎉😮 for all the twink lovers! Lets hope Ryland wears some white speedo's when he dives! For 🐻 likers! Have Jerid & Chris in speedo's! 😅😂❤ you'll understand when your in your early sixty's good luck boys 👦 's on taking care of your Daddys! 😮 🤪 😜
My Alexa did in fact turn on and ask me how long I wanted the timer for 😂
Ryland, I love how your mom is up to trying crazy different things with you and Shane .
Where was Morgan?
I love that Ryland has been growing out his hair it looks so good 😘
CASA BONITA!!!!!
Love your vlogs Ryland, i cant get over how cute your family is 😊 keep them coming, i cant wait to see you and Shane be parents!! Big hugs from Mexico!! ❤
I like how you do stuff with your family (parents, grandparents, etc.) don't see many YouTubers who do that
Shane saying sopapillas is everything 😂❤! Love you guys ❤
This vlog was so fun!! Love all of you guys! I can't wait for the little ones to join in on the fun 😊❤️✌️
The Casa Bonita episode on South Park, is up there in my top 5 favorite episodes! That's so cool to see the place in real life!! 🩵🩵🩵
take a shot every time ryland says girl 😂😂
I think yall need to let the llamas eat the grass around your house. Getting so long
yall made my Alexa go off in my room and it scared the actual SH*T out of me lol
Did mama adams just Ken JZ? “Beyoncés husband” 😂❤
I can’t find those Pillsbury Halloween Sugar Cookies anywhere either!!! They’re all pretty much sold out everywhere apparently. My store had a bunch of Turkey ones and Reindeer ones for Thanksgiving and Christmas but NO HALLOWEEN! I’m like wtf!
Use a baby bottle cleaner
Wow! That cookie looks delicious  & beautiful!  And funny! Good catch! Cookie 🛝 'n off 🍽 ! 😆 🤣 😂 😹
Those cookies literally sold out all over the country.😂
Please cut both of your guys hair … pretty pretty please
I found those cookies at Aldi
Probably tmi but I’ve recently been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and have been going through it. However, watching y’all’s content brings me joy. So I just wanted to say thank you 🫶🏼
You know something’s up when Shane is wide awake and ready to go and Ryland isnt.
15:26 Dangerously good! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
My Alexa new name is Ziggie! You can change it on the app!
for once shane is the one begging ryland to go out 😭
Hi guys! Sunday night! 10:10 p.m. I was watching your platform while you guys & gal! Hi mom! Speaking of Moms! As you were getting the icecream 🍦 😋 out! I thought of your mom one day 📹 🎥 the boys getting ice cream out of the freezer as you did Ryland! So excited! Soon! 🌲 👶 👨‍🍼 🚼 🍼 🤱 💩 😆
Giiiiiiirl that long hair 😍
Shane’s rainbow chapstick looks like a vibrator 😂
I just knew Shane would be disappointed 😂
I’m soooo jealoussss!!!!! I’ve been waiting for my email from Casa Bonita! My husband and I just moved here. 😅
Excellent ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lol
lizze is so funny.. helen from twister hahaha
Loving the longer hair and stubble on you, Ry!! 😘
Wait casa Bonita is real?? lol
Just wait till ya gotta wash baby bottles for two! 😂
I always put my Starbucks ups in the dishwasher 😬🤷‍♀️🤣 I hand wash the lids & straws but the cups go in on the top rack, I’m just sure not to use the hottest setting. So far, no issues
So jealous of your twos lives. Thanks for sharing. ❤
Shane franticaly gathering 18 Starbucks cups 😭
My Life becomes a little bit better when you post 🥹🫶🏽✨
I’m so happy every time you upload
18:58 I’ve been to Casa Bonita, albeit was 2012. I can’t wait to move to Colorado next year. Funnily, my family is from California, but it was too expensive, so they relocated to Colorado. My husband is military, but retiring next year, and Colorado will be our forever home (or until it’s not lol).
That peanut butter looks like vomit 🤮
It was The Mayan in Utah
I look foward to every one of your uploads! love yall sm ❤❤
I just went to 3 store for the damn pumpkin cookies and they had Christmas cookies already but found one box 😮 before I even seen this video . I thought the same . Do they make them anymore? Yes haha
Elizabeth's reference "I'm Hellen Hunt in twister!! ....COW!" Literally made me LOL. 😂 thanks for sharing!!
You and Shane should make the ice cream sandwich Christmas version. Get the cookies before they go!  Love you both and your videos!
I can’t watch Shane while I have the munchies, his food ideas are always sounding so ymmmy 😂😭
That was alot of bla bla get up it's SPOOKY SEASON
When @ryland forget to film an outtro..
10:14 they should’ve gone to dollar tree, they usually still have a few Halloween things in October
it just hit me you guys ACTUALLY have llamas 😭
The Casa Bonita looks so much fun and amazing!! I would love to go there someday! 💕💕💕
Ryland put the Starbucks cups in the dishwasher. I do it everyday and they’re fine
Ryland over here saying shelfs like the word shelves doesn’t exist. Leafs. Lifes. Is he ok?
Lmao Vicki “you guys are younger!!” She’s so cute
omgggg i went to casa bonita when i was like 5 and used to think it was just a fever dream 😂
Ryland, I am food truck owner in Camden Arkansas. And I love how much you, Shane and Lizzie love food trucks so much. My dream is to feed y’all. My food truck is Bills and Dimes 😊❤
Shane, you look so healthy and happy. It's was so nice to see you this way in the vlog. Your are glowing and look so calm and relaxed.
I would die if y’all did a video with Steph pappas or had her on the podcast! I love her and y’all ❤
Shane looking fabulous! You look so trim and handsome!
The guy in the cowboy hat looked just like one of the guys working on Morgan’s house 😂
I’m obsesssssed with your longer hair
We used to go to Casa Bonita in Little Rock when I was a kid and I absolutely loved it. Watching this took me back in time. Sadly they closed it in 2005. I think this one in Colorado is the only one now.
Where is morgan??? We miss see8ng her in your videos 😢
I want to see your guys go through a haunted house now lol
I love that they actually take care of their animals & don't pay someone else to do it when they're home. I really thought they would do more Llama content though, like take them hiking with packs or something. I guess they just enjoy them as pets & that's it lol.
Holy crap this place is still open !!! Best Mexican food ever and the sopapillas YUM!! Thanks for taking me back to 1999! ❤😊
❤❤❤
YOU GUYS SHOULD DO A COOK/BAKE OFF❤️❤️❤️❤️
We left California a year ago for Northern Idaho. The heat was exhausting in California. The cooler weather in Idaho is exhilarating!
Goodness I love you two and your family. Also, did you partner with Casa Bonita? Because honey…it’s such a “dive” (no pun intended) haha.
I have not been able to find those cookies anywhere.
Shane trying to get Ryland out of bed is the plot twist you love to see. Love you guys!!
I love y'all but ryland NEEDS TO STOP snapping at Shane.
After you make the cookies they're supposed to sit until room temperature and then when you add the ice cream you're supposed to put it back into the freezer and let it firm up a good try LOL it probably still tastes good
17:26   I screamed when Shane was showing the sandwich😂😂😂😂😂
Those pickled beans are so good we have extreme beans here but same thing 😆😋
* skips to the part with lizzie in it *
I hate hate hate cleaning all those cups 😡😡😡 no more
Ryland, please… get it cut.
💜💜💜💜💜
i feel attacked for my starbucks cup obsession 😂😂😂
When i buy those cookies i usually take one raw one out and eat it at a time.  Did the same with the pumpkin spice chocolate chip ones.  I didn’t know they had instant banana bread.  Winter and fall being cool with crispy air is so much better than warm all year. Stepping on crunchy leaves, sweaters to hide extra weight, fireplace (on YouTube because i don’t have a real one). Glow in the dark stuff. Yellow and orange leaves. Dark all the time.  Fall is the best. But then winter is also good because it’s festive with all the lights and Christmas  cheer.  Spring it finally gets light again and warmer. Summer is nice for outdoor stuff. Going to the park or walking across bridges.  Changing seasons is the best.
❤❤
You guys didn’t find them cause their in the freezer section of the stores
That sweater looks better on Lizzie sorry Ryland 🤭
I miss Theresa 🥺
I just went to Casa Bonita on Friday I got ducks and the puppet show was so dope
Im lost. So what was 50million Dollars
Those cookies run out QUICK but I’ve seen that you can also get them at Costco
Also fuck you for the Alexa timer lol
These vlogs are seriously the best!
Ok, that shirt color from, ummmm, Casa De pink place looks amazing on Shane. Sorry, I have short memory skills, lol. But I do remember the flash of Shane in said shirt, lol. Love yall!!!
Lizzie i love it! “COW!”
Lizzie, my hubby did the exact same thing to his parents’ garage. His Step-Dad sent the family group text footage from their surveillance cams 💀
They can do anything kind of video and I’ll watch it and it will always make my day better 😭🩷
Rylan how can you not know that those sugar pumpkin shaped cookies are sold out everywhere 😮 😂😂 but I absolutely loved the vlog
Ryland, we love you… but it’s time for a haircut. Xoxo. 😘
Love you so much! ❤
Making memories ❤
I fucking jiz my pants (yes I’m a woman, but you get the point) whenever I see anything oil slick!!  oh my fuck. I went to jeffree’s webcite so fucking fast to look for that chapstick. THEY ARE OUT OF STOCK AND IM SO SAD…. I have that Starbucks cup and my entire kitchen is oil slick. I have a problem.
Seems like Shane’s so excited to go out in Colorado but doesn’t want to in California. Love his energy in this vlog though. It’s adorable lol.
I'm so jealous!!!!! I have been waiting to get my casa bonita email invite! 😭😭😭 I'm glad you guys got to enjoy casa bonita,but man casa bonita used to be so different, with canned cheese and refried beans and never ending chicken enchiladas. 🤤 and all you can eat chips and salsa and sopapillas.
Ryland I am also a Starbucks cup collector basic bitch. If you put them in the dishwasher on no heat dry you will be fine. I do it all the time.
WHEN IT ALMOST FLEW OFF THE PLATE
Walmart!
What happened to your other dogs?…..
The hair needs to be cut!
Next Halloween y’all will have your babies 🥰🥰 so many fall festivals, fairs, and Halloween things. I know my two year old has had so much fun this weekend doing family stuff.
16:39 insert fights with Shane and Ryland song
Wasn’t trying to spam I really do love Nerdy Nuts. 😅
Wait… I’m not supposed to put my Starbucks cups in the dishwasher? Lol oops
You’re mom waving when your grandma is crossing not realizing it’s you at first is so wholesome 🥹🫶🏽
I literally have that same conversation with my partner 😂  Y'all explored Lakewood??? I'm glad y'all enjoyed CB ❤
Ryland is in a mood .  I don’t like the nitpicky way Ryan is treating Shane.  Kickem in the butt next time!,
We had a Casa Bonita here in Fort Worth, TX. back in the 80s.
You’re only suppose to cook those cookies for about 10 min 😂
It’s like the pumpkin blaze we have in NY!
Seeing you guys thriving makes me so happy
😉
I love how there is a dollar tree right next to casa Bonita
They make the cookies I have them :) and the ghosties :) I got them weeks ago though!
Look closely at the goo in those jars. Get used to that vision, because when the twins get there you will be seeing that multiple times a day. 😂😂😂😂🤭🤭
That looks like shit. Literally.
Ryland always comes thru with the vlogs !❤ I luv the family vlogs sm
Shane being like a kid on charismas morning but on october first is so funny
Been living in Colorado for 30 years. I wish Ryan would quit talking about  freezing weather here. Move back to CA and stay there. The weather has been in the high 80's this week. 10/22/2023. Infants do survive over our winter months.  Then Lizzie who can't keep the F word out of her mouth. Can't tolerate her mouth.
Ryland is such a sour puss. Whatever Shane likes Ryland has to put it down. But when Ryland wants and when is supposed to be a big thing. Not a ideal supportive spouse.  I'd cheat
We need a babies update soon plz. Love you guys
I gotta say …. I loved seeing Shane have so much fun! His face lit up like a kid having a blast! Rylan, you let him have his fun, even if it is buying out the gift store! Thanks for sharing!
You can’t find the cookies cause every store puts them in the fridge now for some reason away from the other cookie dough
In like 2010 when I was in high school my best friend got arrested at casa bonita for cliff diving. She had handcuffs on before she even really emerged from the water ;___; hahaha
You guys should’ve went to Walmart for the sugar cookies, they have a huge refrigerator bunker in the middle of the floor full of them 😅
Shane WANTING to leave the house we love character development 🕺
Yaaaassss 1/2 Million Subscribers Yippee-ki-yay ❣️❣️❣️❣️
WHATS THE TEA WHY CANT YOU SAY ORDINARY ADVENTURE
why u boys so south in colorado hehe cute love u
Had a bad day and this made my day thank you guys for bring a smile and laugh to my face 🙏💜
i think its beautiful the you and shane will have babies next halloween!!!!! love youuuuu
i agree with you Ryland starbucks need to make  those  damn cups dishwasher safe.  Im twining with Shane though lol i bought that oil slick cup lol
Cow 🐄
I died when I found out Casa Bonita was a real place. 😂
I’ve been watching Shane and Ryland for years (literally before they started dating) BUT I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHY RYLAND DOESNT GO BY HIS BIRTH NAME RYAN??? Helpppp
lizzie if you see this, you look stunning always girly
Question for Shane and Ryland, are y'all going to do a baby-moon before the boys arrive?
Ryland, you are so right! Starbucks needs to make their cups dishwasher safe. I've bought similar cups from the dollar store, and they can go in the dishwasher. It's so silly.
17:41 I made these last year only let the cookies be round😂
Vikki had me dying in this video 😂 I love that she is like the 3rd person in the blogs ❤
Why does that chapstick look like a small vibrator?
Omg so cool that you experienced the Mayan!! big part of my childhood
Lizze! “Helen Hunt in Twister!” Love it!!!! Ha ha ha ha ha so funny!!! 😂 also did you know there is gonna be a sequel to that movie!!
I’ll give this vlog “10 Rina’s”… LOL Your adventures were FANTASTIC! 👏🏼
My family used to go to casa Bonita after every school year on the last day of school 🏫 also ryland you are a national treasure
Ryland! The pumpkins arnt real at those light shows! When I found out I was sad lol.
Shane is literally the sweetest 🤍
loved this. ❤❤
Those cookies are almost always in the middle open-air coolers, in the wide aisles!!! You should have just turned around 😂😭😭
18:14 I felt when Ryland said he wanted to do it on his own, sometimes when there’s too many cooks in the kitchen It gets frustrating, we must be perfectionists or something
Oh thank you for the Nights of the Jack lights walk through. 🧡
Why didn’t you just Instacart a box? Lol
Wait what was the surprise? Another clickbait or did I miss something?
I love Lizzie, twister cow 😂❤
Liz needs to stop sabatoging Shane and Ryland. Sell the Cali house....get rid of it already.....
I was rewatching old vlogs like Christmas and Halloween ones with you and on Morgans channel too
Those cookies usually aren’t with all the other pilabury. They’re generally in and end fridge or a fridge in the centre of the aisle.
Loved this, I miss your cooking vlogs and Shane just rejecting whatever the finished product is 😂 also love whenever your mom is in them too, she’s so hilarious
Ryland drunk is hilarious....the transition to cali sucks.
Ps Shane carrying the pig bag makes me want to scream~PLEASE I NEED ANOTHER CONSPIRACY PALETTE! I hit pan on most of the shades!
Do people really not know you have to let cookies sit for a few mins to get hard 😅
Ryland yes 100% make them dishwasher safe!!!! My daughter has over 100 of them 😞
I love any video with Shane in it, but Ryland, cut your hair!!! 😆
Not the mushroom lip balm! I love that one!
I live like 45 min from y'all, would love to collab! Your videos make me so happy
I'm so jealous!! I've spent many birthdays at casa bonita. I'd do some things to go back.
This is very enjoyable 🎉
My dad says that too all the time I have a million cups but mine are like dollar tree cups
Ryland you have to get one of those Starbucks cup washers that attaches next to your sink and blast water up at the cups! 😃
Great vlog! Loved it
We know who your Moms favourite is now! You put on the mask and she’s embarrassed and Shane does it and she finds it endearing. 😂
Pickled asparagus sounds amazing . Tell us how it was .
Shane picking on rylands hair like his hair isnt always literally exactly what rylands looked like lmfao sorry Shane you really gotta stop with the comb over nonsense
7:02 As a mom of a 25 month old and a 8 week old. You will be cleaning lots of  bottles and sippy/straw cups soon. 🥰🥰🍼🍼🥤🥤🎉
I put those cups in the dishwasher and they’re fine lol just sayin 💁‍♀️
It looks so good. I'm thinking the freezer hardened the cookies.
This was such a fun one! I cannot believe that Shane didn't want to go to Night of the Jack though! Seems like that would have been something he would've gone nuts over!
You guys baking made me *sooooooo* hungry. So glad you guys didn't use Pumpkin Ice Cream, that sounds nauseating as fuck.  Aw man, not *ONE* South Park cosplayer. So disappointing. :(
The next conspiracy video... Is Casa Bonita just a fancy Panchos??????
They are clearly sponsored by junk food companies, you would think if they have weight problems themselves, they would not try and show off that kind of glutinous lifestyle, but they probably are not capable of anything else!
Ryland, there will be a big growth spurt in maturity when those babies come.
The part where your mom was trying to rush cause she didn’t know it was you guys was so cute 😭😭😭
walmart carries those cookies
Did I miss the 50 million surprise
I love the Twister reference
I always take those pumpkin cookies and make a sandwich with icing in the middle, and it’s AMAZING
The only alpaca name I know is LIZZIE 😂😅
Ryland complaining about the Starbucks cups is my husband every time I bring a new one home 😂
I love Casa Bonita! 😍 I haven’t been since it was shut down and reopened! I’m so sad you guys moved to CO right after I left and I even lived RIGHT by where you guys are located now 😭
😂
You are NOT a "girl"
Anyone else from the south thinking about Pancho’s Mexican Buffet?  Especially when they said the food wasn’t that great but the flag and the sopapillas?
I love how much Shane is living for spooky season he is my spirit animal 🎃🔪
Ryland is a pregnant wife in her 3rd trimester 😂
Ryland, Why do you always call every viewer a "girl"? Can Boys/men watch too or not?
Ryland how come every other word is the S-Word? Why we're you treating Shane like that? 🧐
Those cookies are a tradition and this year I can not find them for the life of me. Found one pack with bats on them at the Walmart marketplace
Peter Monn purchased the same slime SB cup on line 🎃
The cookie tasting was so chaotic im in tears 😂😂😂 thanks for still posting this 😂😂
I wish I lived in Colorado so I can go to these places they go to bc they always find the cutest places
I wash my SB cups in the dishwasher!  top shelf. they fade a little bit but CLEAN
that cone with Lizzie looks sooo good!!!!
The pumpkin cookies are in the middle section of the isle.  They aren't with the other cookies.  I think it's because they have to lay flat.
We are supposed to be somewhere in 39 minutes, I just saw you posted this video ! We are going to be late ! I have to watch this !!
I love seeing Shane in such a happy place ❤
Every time a new vlog comes out I get a whole snack tray ready, roll a blizzy & kick back. Ur videos boost my serotonin & aid my depression so much 🩷
You have no idea how badly I needed this to be up right now. My life is horrible and I’m balling my eyes out I just needed something to keep my calm and sane. And here you are. Thank you
I love yall but ryland is super annoying in this video 😂
You make pure joy content, it brightens my day and gives us all something to look forward to. Absolutely rooting for you and wishing you the best, love the content and just felt like I needed to say it💕💕
Install a sink top glass washer…wash all of my Starbucks cups with it. Will be great for baby bottles
Shane thinks if he paints the pumpkin it will last a year! Bless his heart!
Finally I missed you ❤
I went to Casa Bonita on a cross country trip when I was 15. I’m in my 50s now.  I’d love to know when it got painted pink because I don’t remember it being pink.
The weather effects both of y’all in the opposite ways! Lol!
Ryland.. Starbucks cup ARE dishwasher safe… I literally wash them every time i use my dishwasher and they come up perfect. Just make sure to only put them on the top rack. The cups literally say dishwasher safe right on them😭
Those cookies are cooked best for 12 minutes and then let them cool on the pan to simultaneously finish cooking lol makes them gooey but also cooked all the way through
Okay i need to get that banana bread cookie dough... lol
SHANE LOOKS GREAT IN THIS VIDEO!  Whatever yall are doing...keep doing it.  ❤
Should’ve used a cookie sheet. And then use parchment paper. Let the cookies cool then put the ice cream on the cookies if you put it on a deep dish what you did yeah it’s gonna be a little bit difficult to transfer the cookies out of the dish.
Nights of the Jack is an event made in a huge field in Calabasas. Everytime I drive to my house the line of cars is miles long it’s crazy!🫢🫢🫢
Raise your hand 🙋 if you want to brush Shane’s hair on the right side??? He brushes it forward and it looks so bad just on the one side. Does no one in his life tell him to do this? His old hairstyle used to be so cute, this just ain’t it.
I think the cookies weren’t coming out because they needed to cool down. And they were hard because you put them in the freezer
So what was the 50 dollar house surprise?
Ryland is so pretty and handsome at the same time
In 2011, we hosted a lovely French boy for the summer. We found out he liked South Park and my son told him there was a real Casa Bonita. We took him there and he couldn’t believe it!
I LOVE CASA BONITA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ryland, Wendy's has a pumpkin spice frosty!! OMG so good
Buy a bottle cleaner you'll need one for the babies anyways but it makes cleaning those cups easier
2:55 what a reversal of roles😂😂😂Shane begging Ryland to be productive and leave the house…love u guys ❤
Y'all help me deal with life ❤
I love seeing Shane loving life and wanting to go out and about. You deserve it babe live that life ❤❤❤❤🎉  Love you guys so much  #joined2015 nd loving every moment of it ❤
Ryland, I throw mine in the dishwasher all of the time.. 😐 lol
Can you please give me a good Christmas 🎄 😢
Lizzie is lying, how can you not notice you hit something
“Oh my gosh it vibrates “ that’s what she….. he said
colorado and washington have the coldest winters, you should probably go back to LA so you don’t get cold lol
My absolute fave channel ❤
You could’ve just cooked the cookies separately instead of joining then cutting them.
So....come and tell us again about how hard is cleaning those cups AFTER you have the twins and you clean twenty four baby milk bottles every single day and night hahaha (so excited for you guys)
You and Shane are adorable
Haven't watched the whole video yet but Walmart should have the cookies
Wait wait... 11:55  I had to stop and rewaind it!!! He really put ICE CREAM in the OVEN?!?! I am screaming!!! lmao u guys are amazing <3
Omg Shane is gonna be the fun parent I love how excited he gets about everything. He is literally on a new level. Love you Shane and your entire energy.
@Rylandvlogs  I thought Starbucks cups are dishwasher safe. I put them in the washer all the time
Shane I’m begging you to try a middle part your hair would look even better than it does now 😍 it’s like the perfect length for it
Literally makes me so happy when either of you post only🤍 helps me so much yous have no idea🥹
Next time line the pan with parchment paper to just lift the cookies out.
Casa Bonita, what nostalgia! I grew up up going to the one that was in Tulsa, Ok. It's funny because I was just telling my son the other day about craving their sopapillas. I'm happy to see you all so happy. 😊 Thank you for bringing some enjoyment to my Sunday.
Wow Ryland looks amazing! Absolutely love the longer hair! 💗 Thank you for making my day with this vlog, I can’t get enough of you and Shane. Greetings from Germany 🥰
16:38 😂😂😂
Shane looks great
Excuse me ? Oogie boogie is from nightmare before Christmas uncultured swine.
Just unlocked so many childhood memories being in casa Bonita.  1st time I saw a magic show and called up on stage
You set a timer for 12 mins on my alexa 😂😂
That was the best! ❤
“Put it in after” that’s what she….. he said
I went there when I was a tween back in the olden days!! It had just opened in the mid 70’s and my grandma went with us. BTW: I’m 60 so ….Thanks for sharing because it brought back so many memories!!❤
Small towns know how to throw a pumpkin patch ❤
Ryland, please quit saying "girl" every other word. You are as much a girl as Dylan Mulvaney. Please Ry Ry, this too shall pass. 🎃🎃
“should i move my car? do you want me to back it into the house?” 😂😂😂 lizze omg lmao
25:15 They were talking about a wedding and getting married at that place. I thought they were already legally married???
I LOVE YOU GUYS
HI GUYS
The cup does look cheap.. that sucks he paid almost 50 bucks for a 5 dollar cup.. bummer
Ryland complaining about cleaning the cups 😂 just wait until you gotta wash bottles. 😭 And you all got 2 babies! I'm praying for you Ryland. 🙏 It's going to be a wild ride when your babies get here but so worth it. 🥰
I feel that I went to like 3 store for those Pillsbury cookies I did end up finding them at Walmart if anyone else is looking 😅❤
Love the video, These places are Amazing ❤ So much fun 🎉 Can't wait for u to take the boys to these👣👣
I’ve been looking for those cookies everywhere. Found Christmas ones but no Halloween
Isn't it sad how most ice cream doesn't really freeze anymore? Shane should investigate it as a conspiracy. My anxiety brain worties they've put just a touch of anti-freeze in there...
Again thank you for allowing us to live the good life through your adventures guys. Love you so much! 💗
The cookies will be great after the refreeze stage...
@rylandvlogs Nemu sells a cup cleaner just like the ones Starbucks uses.  Make your cup cleaning life easier ;)
Babies will be here by Christmas!?!?!
Of course Lizzie mawma wanted to come with Ryland for an adventure 🥲
They need to be in the freezer at least overnight so the moisture can get into the cookie, lol
Yay now I have a reason to convince my husband to go to Colorado! Lol thanks guys
When I was growing up my favorite Nightmare Before Christmas character used to be Sally but now as an adult and still is as a 33 year old woman it's Oogie Boogie. I'm living for all this Oogie Boogie stuff you keep bringing into the vids. I have that multichrom cup. Love it. Where you get that multichrom chapstick? Also have that lime green cup too.
Y’all got cicis pizza 😅
You should go to Hudson gardens for their magic of the jack o lantern event
YOU GUYS ARE SO FREAKING CUTE!🥺😭🥰
They have the cookies you are looking for at Walmart. Love your videos 💜
Shane is seriously my vibe every time I want to go somewhere and my boyfriend won’t get out of bed!!
I’m just gonna say I always put my Starbucks cups in the dishwasher and they’ve been fine so far 😅 I’ve been collecting for years.
So many ads on this video, Ryland needs some coins!
I haven’t been able to find the Pillsbury cookie dough anywhere this year!!!☹️
And to think next year you guys will do all the fun stuff with Jet, and Max ❤️
These two guys make me laugh🤣I just want them to slowwww down and be on the same page for once! All the drama will not be good for the babies coming soon. ❤
The big question…. Did you all FINALLY watch Nightmare before Christmas?
With how obsessed Shane has been with Oogie Boogie lately, PLEASE tell me he has finally watched NBC!!! He needa to experience Oogie in ALL his glory!
I LOVE that you always include your Grandma ❤
Rylands frustration with the starbucks cups not being dishwasher safe is so real 😂  they’re so expensive too😭
15:22 lmfao
Its crazy that gay men can just rent a woman and buy her babies
Currently snuggling with my two goldens as I watch this vlog!! ❤
why is Ryan Shane"s maid...what Does Shane do ever to help....HIRE some help Ryan..
I’m with Shane, it’s about the oogie boogie. We LOVE fall weather.
Love that for you ❤
Ryland is a visual learner and that’s ok lol
In addition to starbucks cups not being washable, they are also not recycable, so every time you buy one it will eventually end up in the landfill for hundreds of years!! 😢
Casa Bonita is a dream come true. Please go to Hollywood Horror Nights. Like the whole crew.
That title has MrBeast shook
I'm re-watching all your vlogmas from the last two years and loving them 🥰🥰
Thanks for setting the timer on my Alexa 😂😂😂😂
Why you still in bed it is spooky season  😂
Two things, loving Ryland dad hair. And I have one word for him about cleaning...bottles
@Rylandvlogs 6:41 there is a Target dupe of the oil slick cup! It's the big one! And the only differences are there is no Strabucks logo, and it's only $15.00! And they aren't dishwasher safe either, but that's because most insulated cups aren't dishwasher safe. I have one myself!!
I can't believe Matt Parker and treystone actually bought casa Bonita. I've seen several videos of people going in and eating. I didn't realize it was a buffet was it always? I'm very jealous that I'm on the East Coast in can't come 😢
Wait, was that Helen from Twister?! Yes! Hunt those Twisters Helen!
Glad Ryland mentioned The Mayan because that's all I could think about in the beginning clip of Shane describing Casa Bonita. The Mayan was the best, when I was growing up. Loved that place. Do I remember the food? No 😂 (My mom says it wasn't very good anyway). I do remember the diving shows though. But that was the main reason to go anyway! Nice to know there's a place a state over that is similar that I can take my son one day, so he can have a similar experience and memory. When he's older, we'll have to take a drive over there and make a little vacation out of it 🥰
Perfect for the beautiful Sunday. I will watch this evening. ❤❤❤❤❤
“If you did on your own it will never get done” is the most accurate Taurus comment ever lmao
I can't wait for the babies to come 😩 I have watched shane since I was 12 I'm now 25! So many more exciting adventures ❤
2:02 😂
Shane is my soul sister when it comes to spooky season
I literally ate at Casa Bonita when I lived in Denver Colorado every weekend with my parents until I was 10 years old when I found out not long ago that they close that place down it was heartbreaking because I no longer lived there anymore but they had so many things to do in there and well it is not digital because we didn’t have that back then it was a wonderful family place to go and I’m glad they reopened it
Your hair looks so good Ryland omg 😭❤️
Shane if you see this: I MUST know your favourite BB houseguest of those left in the house!!
I neee more blogs!!!🥲
Omg I use to go there when I was a little girl.  Loved it🎉
I love y’all so much.
U guys are so freaking cute! U guys are gonna be the cutest dads to the twins. I can’t wait to watch all the holiday things you’re gonna do with the boys
I just love that you kept Abbie and Zivas names because I’m an NCIS Stan 😂
Omg u took us to soo many places… loved it 😍
WAIT WAHATTT 😅
I love your mom she’s so funny 😂
Ryland is giving gay Scott Disick in this vlog
Whaaat I have washed them in the dishwasher and they’ve been fine
RYAN PLEASE STOP.  I cringe everytime you validate the theists in their god belief,  as a gay man . They believe you should be put to death. Laviticus 20:13 - If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death. Please stop African gay males are being killed by your support of the god belief.
Ryland your hair looks so good I love it!
PLEASE GET MARRIED AT CASA BONITA
Hey guys shot glasses are great for teaching kiddos to drink out of glasses. My daughter has a c ollection of shot glasses from all our family outings.
I dentify so much with Lizzie
I feel like the beginning of this video was so backwards with Ryland being the one in bed and Shane with a bucket load of energy ready to go 😂😂😂 I'm used to Shane popping out, just waking up, not liking how his hair looks 😂❤
As somebody you cant afford all the fun stuff i love that you do and buy all the things i cant looking forward to seeing u guys be daddies every holiday in the future ur gonna love it.
where is morgan and why is she neeeever in the vlogs anymore?!!!! i miss the dynamic
The queens have posted ❤❤❤😊
Shane dancing after that bite 😂  Never felt so relatable!
❤❤
🤍
The fact that they literally were next to my neighborhood is crazy! I can’t believe this
Take a shot everytime Ryland says "GuRrrRlLlL"😂
Casa Bonita, I was there back in high school.  Cool place
I just LOVE you all SO much ❤❤❤❤
i LIVE for these vlogs. nothing makes me happier than see you guys thrive 🫶🏻
100% perfect wedding venue!!!!!
Omg love love love this vlog !!!! Your mammas are so precious!!! I told my hubby I want to go to casa Bonita tonight! For date night! I think they recently opened it to the public? 🤔😂
I thought it was so cute and funny how your mom was embarrassed of you making the cookie box craft mask! I could see her blush! 😹❤️
Ryland is my therapy 😅
She shade between Shane and Rylan here hahaha
stop making my alexa go off lmao she saved the timer
Shane is an OG of coming up with Creations in the kitchen.
Thought y’all bought a mansion 😂
FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉
Surprised you have not gone to Frightmare in Westminster. 💀👻👹
When the twins grow up make sure they learn math and English from Shane. I'm only teasing out of love❤ so happy you posted today❤
RYLAND, take sliced ham, spread cream cheese thrn put 1 piece of pickled asparagus on it roll and fed to Shane. Yummy
My husband heard Lizze’s voice and said “is that Lizze?”  He doesn’t even watch YouTube but he loves him some Lizze.
So Lizzie remembered not having her foot on the brakes but don’t remember running into your garage?? I’m so confused….
shane looks really good in the casa bonita shirt i think that red tie dye is your color!!!
I would absolutely LOVE to see some adventures with Shane’s family I want some Shane Ryland Jerid and Teresa content 😢😢
this was defo one of my favorite vlogs  of yours!
Vicki looked so ashamed for not knowing Jay-Z 😭😂
Happy Spooky Season 👻 I have been in a frumpy mood but this vlog has inspired me to get up and back out into the world. Sending you guys oodles of love. Thank you for spreading light and laughter. 🫶
I'm watching this vlog and all I can think about is how a few months from now, all of this is going to just disappear into nothing but poop, laundry, and sleep deprivation 💚
My pup went missing 3 days ago, and that hug you gave Riley and when you said “I would be nothing without you”, hit sooo hard, I miss my baby
i love mama vicki omg
I love love the alpacas soso much!
Does nobody know 12:24 There’s a way to set up your listening devices, where they’ll only respond to _YOUR_ voice? 😂
Casa Bonita is in a sketchy part of town!!
Love you guys! happy spooky season🤗
I relate to Ryland a lot but I'm about 7 mins in the video and I swear I feel his pain cleaning those cups they are a pain in the ass my daughter uses them but baby bottles were kinda worse be prepared lol and I swear my husband is just as bad as Shane he always wants to buy stuff we don't need or just has things all around the house that don't belong especially when your trying to keep things neat and it tends to get really cluttered because he's super ADHD and because I love him I put up with it. It doesn't make them bad or to hard to deal with you just have to compromise but Ryland I feel you on soo many levels 😂
OMG I DIDMT KNOW CARTMANS FAVOURITE PLACE ON EARTH WAS REAL!!!!
So happy Aunt Susie got to go with you guys to Casa Bonita!!! Always makes my day to see her in a vlog :)))
Kinda fangirling because I sent a Snapchat message to Shane at least a year ago asking about a Casa Bonita vlog, and now it’s here and I get to enjoy the video :’)
So many fun fall adventures in one epic vlog I’m living for it!!!!
I couldn’t find those cookies either! Only the elf ones 🫠
The Casa Bonita episode is an iconic South Park episode ❤😂. We used to have a Casa Bonita in Tulsa where I grew up. Sadly no more and they didn’t have cliff divers but an awesome arcade
Shane seems significantly happier in Colorado.
Shane bringing the energyyyy!!! 🙌🎃♥️👻🥰
omg how did you get that cup?! can never seem to find it
I feel Ryland's pain about the Starbucks cups
Lol, take a shot every time Rylan says "girl" 😂
awww Ryland, you are moaning about cleaning Shane's cups, boy...do you have a lot of bottles to wash and sterilize lol
WOW! Fun episode award 🥇
Lizzie Shannon Beadored your house
There used to be a store next to Casa Bonita that sold beanie babies (and like nothing else, if I remember right). I’m so nostalgic rn
Yanno, I'm starting to think that the cravings and hunger of pregnancy has nothing to do with who is carrying the baby physically inside of them. Because every single thing that you've done for the last month is all about food - and Ryland just can't seem to get enough to eat.
Take a shot every time Ryland says "mamas" 💀💀💀💀
I find myself commenting on every video on how good Shane looks! He’s handsome!! It’s a glow maybe… love when people are haopy
My friend got that slime cup, dropped it once and shattered the bottom. Not worth the hype for sure.
I too am not a whip topping girlie. I'd rather have more ice cream, pie, or frap lol
You guys make me so happy 🥹 love you guys! 🫶🏻
Slayyyy
Make a Jay-Z one 😂  Love it ♥️
So excited for this vlog! The way I vicariously love through these is not healthy, and I’m ok with it! ❤ 😂
Shane & Ryland are family men❤😊
I love that chapstick Shane!! ❤❤❤
❤❤❤ I can't wait to see you both with the babies!! Sundays can't get here so enough for the vlogs
u guys should try anderson farms in colorado they have a terror in the corn maze and lots of other stuff OH AND THESE SICKENINING DONUTWS
Lazy Sunday and a ryland vlog 🎉
The jay-z shade . 😂
Awesome job ryland  with the vlog thumb up
Love this vlog Ryland ❤ filled my heart with joy! Keep being yourselves always! The both of you will always have a loyal viewer in me! Can’t wait for the twins 🥰
How did you mess up so bad hahaha
I always click so fast when I see you upload a new vlog ❤
I hope you both know you’re my dads. Happy fall yall 🧡🎃
Ummm WTF!? Is “Super” Target real or is that photoshopped in cause WHAT!? 🤯 I need to go
Anything y'all post is an absolute masterpiece 💞
I was looking for the Halloween cookie dough! It’s never in store!
this video screams america so loud😂
Wooo! Needed this today ❤
I’ve never related to anything more than Ryland’s hatred of cleaning Starbucks cups lol. I collect them too and my husband hates them with a passion because he can’t put them in the dishwasher lol
It's a rainy day where I am from. And seeing a vlog from Ryland makes this rainy cozy day complete😊❤ got my snacks and ready 😘🥰
I put my Starbucks cups in the dishwasher all the time and they’re fine
Anytime you and Shane post it brightens my day! Excited to watch 😊
Aldis has those pumpkin cookies!’n
I'm so jealous you got into Casa Bonita!
We had one in Tulsa but it’s closed now, wish someone would bring it back, it was fun
“Shane I’m so gonna throw you through a window tonight.” On the next episode of FIGHTS! with Shane and Ryland 😂😂😂
You guys, get Dawn Ultra Platinum Powerwash Dish Spray (not sponsored, lol) it's in a reusable spray bottle that you can purchase refills for that snap onto the trigger top. No scrubbing or soaking necessary, it restores those all those hand wash only cups (& etc) to squeaky clean so easily I was shook.🌈🌟
What was the 50 mil dollar suprise ?
it’s so awkward watching them fight every time
Alexa here already subscribed 😂
Shane seems so much happier since being with Ryland. Some people you can tell are just meant to be❤  love you guys❤
Is good to see Shane outside and happy and excited and your videos are always fun to watch even nothing special happend. 😂🎉❤
Shane you should have left the cookies cool and set up before you used the saptula. Great spooky snack idea. Btw, Shane's tickling you was the cutest thing. You two look so happy in this video.❤❤ That restaurant was magnificent. So much to see and do.
The oven door hitting those whistle notes? Iconic.
I need to go to this restaurant 🤣😁
I hate you guys. 50 million dollar restaurant.... it aint yours.... "visting a 50 million dollar build suprize"
I don’t know why y’all just didn’t look up each store online and see if they carried the cookies 😂
❤
Gonna have lunch and enjoy the video. Love your videos so much & can’t wait for parenting vlogs.
The genuine smile on Shane’s face when he is with Ryland is just so sweet. The way that they both look at each other is just amazing. You guys have something special for sure!
YEEESSS!!!! I’ve been soooo excited for this!!!!! 💖💖💖
I love what Lizzie adds to the videos, she's hilarious.
"We’ll bring your mom!” Im so happy Shane loves Ryland’s family
Love these vlogs with the crew!
Safeway looks the same everywhere. I love Safeway

OMG when Shane said spooky seasons almost over it made me sad because it’s true🥺🥺🥺

Ryland you and I couldn’t be more opposite I thrive when it’s cool out it energizes me hot weather makes me not want to leave the house I would give anything for some 40 degree weather 😂😂😂
