Welcome to Boro,  Kelechi.
1st comment in 1 year
Hat-trick ihenacho
I swear every year when Leicester bottle it, he's always there to turn things around. He doesn't get played much but surely he has proven he should start the whole season and not the end
Sheff are so bad for forward mid
Nearly a assist for inacho
Inacho is great in this😜
30000 on streets of London Take your freedom back
Man! Bryan looks even worse in this highlights package than the game. Backing off runners, not anticipating Vardy’s cross! Nowhere near kelechi at all!
IGBO KWENUU
Sheffield defenders so sick of Leicester strikers scoring that they scored one themselves instead of risking another striker getting in on the act
What if pereira users                                         Yes
"mutually" Wilder is sacked and they suffer their biggest defeat in what 5 years? Maybe more? Anyone know?
Seniorman kels
i really like leicester as a team but it's awkward to see goal celebrations when they're scoring against sheffield united
You can't say they don't deserve this. Been on top form today
As a man city fan I'm so happy for Iheanacho!, hes exactly what Leicester needs young and hungry for goals and wins
Always said when iheanacho was at city he had alot of potential to be great hope he does well
So happy to see Iheanacho get his first prem hattrick. Will always love that man, class act and class player!
The belligerent riverbed prognostically ban because format tellingly arrange absent a third apartment. bitter, tacit karate
I hate it when someone gives a really nice assist and then the goal scorer doesn’t even acknowledge them after scoring a tap in.
Iheanacho scores a tap-in performs a Ronaldo-like celebration, coincidence?
Ampadu is suspect....I'm a Chelsea fan
Kelechi's left foot is gold. What a strike.
Name of the song
I don’t tend to make this sort of comment after a couple of games in form, especially with one against Sheffield United, but Iheanacho > Jesus
Anyone here from Iheanacho’s interview
Good Start for the new manager Then...
Most one sided prem game i watched in a while.
Iheanacho finally living up to his career mode potential. absolutely
3 of the best he’s made them pay
Fofana is the best footballer in the world
🔥
Senior man Kels 🤣
Hi
Did anyone feel like even the last own goal Vardy was tryna pass to Iheanacho.He is a goal score but also a great guy who can make assists.
Love it when united get smashed
How is Aaron ramsdale a professional footballer. Relegated twice in 2 seasons 🤦‍♂️
Get 30,000 blades fans outside training ground and Bramhall Lane chanting for wilder back get banners up the lot
Nice to see Sheffield utd lose
This reminds me of when Charlton sacked Alan Curbishley, thinking that a better manager would take them further and he wasn't great. They went through a load of managers after that and now look at them.
3 gaols👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿😎
Ramsdale definitely wanted to knock someone out after the game 😂
Ricardo pereira getting upgrade les go
Why we let wilder go I will never know.  With this standard we’re going back to league 1
Mum: we have Ronaldo celebration at home Iheanacho:
Sheffield United have been poor since Henderson left them, if they had Henderson I’m sure they would be still mid table. Nothing against ramsdale but he’s not premier league quality.
If we don’t give Sheffield United at least 3 goals next week then I don’t know what to say
Where is iheanachos interview
The players where upset about wilder going what's their excuse for the rest of the season should be ashamed of themselves
Well done 👏 so why do they never turn up to the big games only against pub team opposition....
1:52 VARDY WOW
La masia never be outclassed
Sheffield United are so bad they deserve to be in the championship they should never have been in the premier league
Iheanacho silver stars incoming???
Sheffield United are officially dead as far as this season goes, I know their performance was poor leading up to the manager leaving but that just killed it totally
High fives here, 5-0
The Strike duo of dreams Vardy hat trick of assists Iheanacho hat trick of goals
Leicester literally turning Sheffield into a shot on your iPhone meme..
Sheffield United got off to a bad start and let's face it, they haven't been good enough really this season... But to just sack Chris Wilder off is a totally bad move...  And this is coming from a Leeds fan. MOT
Vardys passing is so good
Credit to Leicester but I’m not sure I’ve seen a worse premier league team than Shefford U. Their defending is absolutely awful.
Iheanacho is finally becoming a top class striker
Vardy is class
I wonder if Sheffield United deliberately played badly as a protest against the board causing Wilder to quit.
Hope you all know AYOZE is Nigerian
We could of won 12-0 how many great chances did we get
Think even Iheanacho was shocked he scored 3. He threw in a ronaldo celebration for the 1st then didnt know what to do on his 2nd
can already see people on tik tok saying beating sheffield isnt for everyone
And that completes a wonderful hattrick
sheffield need to win next to try carrying on suriviving if not       its championship football
Heckingbottom would of got Leeds relegated if he had had more games. If he's the answer, god knows what the question is!
0:35 Kelechi > CR7
Senior man Kels
Iheanacho’s 3rd was like when you put the fifa sliders to 100 shot speed and 0 shot error 🚀🚀🚀
0:34 sweaty goal
Anyone know what the name of the song that plays when Leicester score???
Didn’t know Leicester liked the gini wijnaldum song😂
I feel sorry for Sheffield United.
Man copied ronaldo celebration
1:56 = Aaron Ramsdale to Ethan Ampadu: "What the f*ck are you doing playing him on!?!?".
Football in Sheffield be a mess this season huh 😂👀
Well done Nachos. Love from Man City always.
Vardy is a sick bastard
Vardy the provider! Kelechi what a hat trick especially the 3rd goal. Absolute beauty
Think Mr K. I has finally paid the 25m back....Another brilliant team display by City. Can't believe how well there playing..... Champions league bk at the K. P🤔💯. See you Wed's lads at work.. 👊
Why does Leicester have  BLM on their seats?
He’s magic... you know?
0:37 SIIIUUUUUUU
Never forget that deliberate miss against liverpool
kelechi > gabriel jesus
Wow how badly did Sheffield Utd defend in this game? I know so many fans get on Ramsdale's back but he has been hugely let down this season since joining. They looked like 10yr olds ball watching and backing off and everything else wrong with defending. It looks like 2 different teams from the one last season!
Hahahaha hilarious all the original people quoting the FIFA commentators. If only I could like all those comments twice, every video I seen it!
Hopefully this will make the Sheffield tiktok admin be quiet for once
Could be worse. They could've lost 10-0
Nice clean sheet😏
*Vardy is so underrated.*
I'd take Iheanacho back at MCFC in a heartbeat cause Jesus is just not the answer for replacing Aguero
@2:09, the finish with the music.😍😍😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Also @2:35, the beat drop at the same time as the left boot connects with the ball. Amazing.
I would rather see Burnley and Newcastle get relegated than Sheffield United and Fulham tbh.
1:26 Is it me or did that feel like the ball took ages to go in? It felt like slow motion..
Such a mistake firing Wilder
Sad to see Sheffield United’s decline. They lost a magnificent manager.
1:57 listen closely to ramsdale screaming at his defenders “what the f*ck are you doing” 😂
Silver stars iheanacho?
Jesus is coming soon He loves u and died for u pls turn to Him
imagine if ihenacho stayed at man city
Leister scored more goals in this game than what sherfield have won all season
The managerial situation at Sheffield couldn't have been any Wilder, but after all that they're still Heckingbottom of the table...
Ramsdale save against Perez at the beginning was world class. Shame he faces so many shots on his goal every game...
I think Vardy is past it now unfortunately
Vardy Perez Iheanacho could become the country’s best front 3 at this rate!
Ramsdale is stealing a living
There in they've scored there surely home.and dry
I read this as ‘Lingardinho scores Hattrick’
They got rid of their manager when really they should have got rid of that away strip.
Iheanacho was a beast at oil factory why did they get rid of him?
put em in championship already and giv em a year to come back stronger
Vardy :  What Harry Kane can do , I can do them too!
The last goal he thought "this hatricks mine!"
Just relegate Sheffield they’ve suffered enough
Aarron Ramsdale is the most unlucky keeper
Better finisher then g.Jesus
Let’s give credit to Rodgers he’s the one who acc was using the inverted wing back role in the prem before pep made it look like a useful role
What a week bottom league down before Christmas lights come on.wilder Messiah sacked  got stuffed by owl vardy and co appoint ex 🦉 heckingbottom as interim manager wawawa 😅😅😜
Leicester goal tune - we’re going back down to league 2 league 222222222 22222222222222
Come.on city vardy the owl another big laugh after pumpkin  head wilder departure 5-0 ex owl in charge heckingbottom live it up blunts 😭😅🎈🎉🎉😜😅😅
Once you get confidence you’re unstoppable. Well done Kelechi!!! You’ve always had the ability now you have the confidence 🦊
Why does ampadu keep getting opportunities. He’s been awful all season, no where near good enough.
Iheanacho is playing like prime vardy...
Sheffield had a lot of narrow losses all season.. But they are absolute garbage now
Hello!......how are you...?.....goodnight !!!!see you back in championship where you bloody well belong!!!!!!!!
Vardy’s passing is so underrated
God help us absolute crap
Looks like we got an 89 Periera now :/ thanks, Sheffield I cant wait for champs next week...
Bring back Wilder
Iheanacho taking it on on why not it on
3 of the best he's made them pay and that completes a wonderful hat-trick
So Vardy was on form today, what a performance !
The 4th goal🔥🔥
my dad had a bet on vardy to score lol
Real Question: Would you take Kelechi Iheanacho or Gabriel Jesus?  In my opinion Pep only mistake was letting him leave... Was class for them and in City is a great second striker to have
That's what you get for not investing into your team same as West Brom Albion cannot stay in the premier without investing money ever year FACT!
Neutral observer here. Anyone explain what changed in 12 months for Sheff utd? Am I right in thinking they finished last season poorly?
SENIOR MAN KELS
Iheanacho with the btec Ronaldo celebration
looking good for Nigeria, England can keep Abraham
Love how Vardy always celebrates as if he scored the goal.
If ramsdale had a better team he would be a class keeper but Sheffield defence has been shocking this season
Sheffield Utd defenders hang your heads down that was bad
It’s a day he’ll never forget
Cr7
Strikers were great on form But vardy just gets better his a winner
Kasper Schmeichel traded in his goalkeeping gloves for oven gloves at half time so he could spend the second half making Danish pastries
Iheanacho> Jesus from a city fan
Leister to win the league this year city players 1 by 1 Aaron Ramsey better score 11 goals
Kelechi yes man
Compare the two SU defenders actions - No 6 at 1:02   and No 22 at 2:34  -- p.s  I LOVE watching Jamie Vardy
And that’s the third it’s a Hatrick today he’s really been on form
I think getting rid of wilder could be a mistake you know. He used his own brand of football to go up 2 leagues, and it just has not worked this season. He should have been allowed to rebuild. Such a shame, as I really enjoyed watching them in the premier league. Hopefully they do not drop down the leagues.
Wuda beat City playing like that today
I love the stadium music when Leicester score!
Fun fact Hatricks this season  Inheanacho 1 Messi 0
How biased is this commentator, like at least try not to sound Ecstatic when Leicester score
A very impressive Leicester performance
good one K C
Well this didn't make a difference Sheffield United board
And its live
Christ imagine if he played for the media's favorite team Man Utd we would never hear the end of it.Just look at the young lad who scored against Milan the BBCMU done a full report just about him lol
Memory unlocked: didn't Iheanacho play for Man City??????
Glad for Iheanacho. His quality's taken a long time to shine through, but he kept plugging away. Good for him!
Is the match fixing coming to an end or are they throwing the true supporters of football a 🦴
Ralph Wiggum meme
After that performance......       Leicester wont finish top 4!!
Wilder deserves to be sacked , for allowing grown men to play in those Pink Strips .
I feel sad for Sheffield united at this point
"One team looking really off colour" "3 of the best, hes made them pay" "all props to the team that is stacking up the goals"
Ineanacho doing a Ronaldo celebration??
haha blunts got battered crying pigs
Bye bye Sheffield United show why thay are down
Is it coincidental that Ramsdale was the no1 keeper for Bournemouth in the season they got relegated, now he’s the no1 keeper for Sheffield United in the season they get relegated.
Ndidi got the easiet assist of his life
Little Leicester City... Ex premier league winners.. New £110m training facility.. Bold stadium planned extensions.. Chasing runners up position.. Champions league football?? Oh my how this club has got to where it is now is nothing short of miraculous!! Times change, this is our time, Long may it continue!!.
Am I the only one who think's that Ramsdale deserves a better team?
*Leeds fans liked this*
Leicester might do the double over man city but it wont make a jot of difference football is a funny old game .
Iheanacho is so rude with Leicester fans in real life. He expected me to recognise him in a gas station like he was some kind of black Jesus
Sent Chris Wilder into retirement
Leicester giving Bayern Munich vibes with that troll goal music
How about you let us see the nld highlights
Cheers Jeff
lucky AS
They’ve got to start vards and Nacho every game! The new Cole and Yorke?
Illiman debut tho
Oh why not take it on?!....OHH WHY NOT TAKE IT ON!!!!!!! 2:18
VARDY WAWAW.
Sheffield united must be the worse team in premier league history
Thanks leicter, my Ricardo perayra is getting a nice upgrade
Players should have walked off pitch and refused to play intill chris got reinstated
Feel so bad for Sheffield it’s like they’ve completely given up already...
We are here to gather at a funeral (well not gather) for sheffield United they are going down to the championship but let's pay there respects rip
What a time to be a blade 😍😍
Arsenal have just beaten Spurs 🔴 north london is red!
Finally been giving opportunity to play consistently!
waiting for the arsenal highlights
Sheffield united=charity fc
Iheanacho is actually class
My first proper Leicester City game
There were some sexy goals in there! Love the way Leicester plays, Vardy is a machine.
I'm a Leicester fan but by the end this was a bit like watching one of those Attenborough programmes where the baby chicks need to try and get past all the snakes waiting on the beach...
Back to league one without Wilder
Excellent
Well, Iheanacho had a good game. I want to go in for him but Leicester are little shits when it comes to a side trying to get a player that is inform for them.
In the last few years Leicester have firmly established themselves as a genuinely threatening and highly entertaining team to watch.
Its a hattrick today..hes really been on  form
Ihenacho potm incoming[]
@0:37 that ronaldo celebration...
no way
The commentator is 🍆
Sheffield   (bunch of Muppets)   United.
I feel like Sheffield United has given up already
Did my man really do Ronaldo's celebration
kean bryan was shambolic
Beautiful response Townsend's critic.. He did not become Fifa  under 17 golden boy by chance.
This is the kelechi we saw at city!
Not a Leicester fan but some real talent in that Squad , without Barnes & Maddison today and those three centre backs are as good as they get playing that system anywhere in the premiership. Although clearly not tested today. Will take some form from some of the big boys to deny them champions league next season. From a neutrals point of view will be an exciting end to the season.
Ihenancho I am better than cr7 Cr7- well you have chosen death
Of course they concede 5 after Chris wilder is gone... one way down from here now, awful decision. !
Dont mind me, just refreshing to see if the Sunderland match has been uploaded yet 👋
The board members of Sheffield United deserve this but their fans don't. Shows how clueless they are in the board room if they haven't seen Burnley and soon Norwich coming back stronger than their last relegation which Sheffield United were capable of replicating.
Feel bad for Sheffield but most importantly Aaron Ramsdale cuz he left Bournemouth last season cuz dey got relegated and this season is obviously clear that Sheffield is getting relegated
I find it so cringe to see players copy Ronaldo and Mbappe celebration but her Inheanacho doing Ronaldo celebration makes me laugh because it just pathetic and embarrassing to copy a unique celebration that only belongs to Ronaldo. If I was Ronaldo I'll be bursting out laughing at this fool 😂😂😂😂
Iliman Ndiaye watched him in Rising ballers now making his premier league debut
as a sheffield united fan, this has been a painful few days
Heckys at the wheel
That was painful, what a horrid weekend this has been.
Sheff Utd players giving a message to the owners??
Stop! Stop! He’s already dead!
'IT'S THE HIGH FIVES HERE, IT'S 5-0!'
What a way to score the hatrick goal
Might just be time to slot him in to fpl
Nacho nacho man!
This would’ve been 7-0 Leicester if Maddison was fit
Transferred Iheanacho into my FPL🤪 perfect timing
Paul heckingbottom 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Feel for Vardy. Can’t get a goal at the moment!
3 of the best hes made them pay and that completes a wonderful hatrick
I think I'm one of the only Leicester fans who's always backed Iheanacho.  Comment if u also have
What's with the "shot on iPhone" music?
When your captain gets you 22 points without scoring a goal 😂😂
Good to see two strikers upfront feed off  each other
Iheanacho wants to be the star too often
Ramsdale left Bournemouth to further his career and try and Get in amongst the England set up, 2 seasons of being awful and 2 relegations. Enjoy the championship.
This game was shot on an iPhone
Reckon the commentator’s a Leicester fan?
STOP! STOP! They're already dead 😭
When lockdown gets lifted and those players or fans go clubbing, whenever they hear that song they'll be haunted by the memory.
And this is supposed to be the best league in the world, some of the worst defending I’ve ever seen and I’m including primary school level football in that list!
One team on their game today, the other very off colour
As a man city fan I’m very happy to see Kelechi scoring for Leicester. He’s a humble and patient player, definitely deserves it. Hopefully he stays on form.
Sheffield United will not score another point this season. Feel free to come and laugh at me in May if I'm wrong
As a Bolton fan, I'm loving every minute of Sheffield Utd's capitulation.
top 4 for Leicester this season i hope . They'll get what they should have got last season all being well
Sacking wilder they deserve to go down
Sheffield United are going down.
had a nice bet builder on for over 3.5 goals and vardy to score, this was the only game to let me down for 3,000 . FML
And there’s the third the hat-trick  One team at there best  the other very off colour  A day he’ll never forget
Does my what If Ricardo get upgraded 😂
Leicester is Flying High, great team
Cant stop Kel!!!!!!!
Talk about 2nd season jitters.where has it gone wrong?
Nigerian prince
Yeah, thats why you shouldn't throw out the manager who took you from League 1 to 9th in the PL and would be the best manager to get you back up
Sheff Utd owners are a disgrace for getting rid of Wilder. Wilder did an excellent job considering he got the club from League One to PL. What on earth did the owners expect?
Welp looks like we might be slugging it out with wednesday again for league 1 promotion in a couple years time, sir chris of wilder got me to fall back in love with my football club and now its hard not to feel a sense of loss and my passion has dried significantly, great
Ricardo pereira owner smiling
What a commentator
On 2 hours it's westham vs manunited
Leicester supporter here and just wanted to say that this performance was sublime. There's a real unity amongst this group of elite players that makes me very excited, going out of the Europa looks like a blessing in disguise with all the injuries too.
Bro did this commentator support Leicester or summit??? He was going crazy whenever they scored 😂😂😂
Five year contract for Heckingbottom asap.
The commentary made it so much better. Brilliant
Sheffield deserve this
Shouldnt have let wilder go
LAMELA JUST SCORED A RABONA
Getting rid of Wilder was an awful decision. They were going down anyway and this was clearly a performance with very little hope or heart.  Some of the defending was so woeful that you'd probably get hammered in the Championship with it. Who stands off that much?! Felt a little sorry for Ramsdale by the end.
Nice to see Iheanacho doing well. We had such high hopes for him at City. Will always remember going mad in the Palace end when he scored in the last minute.
Really happy for iheanacho well deserved 👏🏽
Chris wilder wouldn't have let this happen
One team very on form today, the other very off colour.
Worst decision in recent history by Sheff Utd board, wilder would have brought them back up next season. Now there's no passion left, loved by fans and players
With all Chris wilder's done, they can't sack him can they.
Fun fact: Sheffield United are actually a professional football team
Why couldn't united do this ?
Good enthusiastic commentary
Sheffield Wednesday fan here's just to say thx UTD for today's comedy show🤣😂🤣😂
Champions league beckons for Leicester City 🙂
Vardy loves going beast mode against blades
Now I'm unsure if we need odssoune edouard
Last season Sheffield where battling for Europa League qualification now there battling to get out of relegation 0-:
Kelechi is finally finding form again. So happy for him
Leicester will get top 4, but I’m worried how they will perform in the UCL, I mean they got knocked out of the UEL by Slavia Praha!
BREAKING: Leicester hit the number 5!
5 on the bounce
Really hope Leicester get top 4 this season they deserve it alot more than Penchester United and Chelsea
I love how Vardy and Ienacho are looking after each other without trying to steal the spotlight
Glad to see someone who played for RisingBallers making a debut in the prem
What is that clown doing celebrating a tap in like ronaldo 💀
Iheanacho with the perfect birthday gift... Even though my birthday Is tomorrow but still. This match Is one for my Leicester scrapbook
Okay someone's playing a Leicester City career mode
So sad watching the result of internal conflict within the club. No winners....just losers.
kelechi iheanacho is the best striker in premier league history
Leicester should sign john egan
Sheffield United are finished simple as that
0:38: Scores 1 hat-trick and thinks he is Ronaldo
Is that commentator a leicster fan ? He gets so excited when they score
Did ihenacho really just do Rinaldo's celebration. Pmsl
When I saw it was 1-0 thought it was a boring game then saw it finished 5-0:/
nooo vardy you are suposed to kick the flag down
That buy back clause is getting interesting now for iheanacho
Stealing Ronaldos celebration 😂
Sheffield got more than 11 points. A slim silver lining in a very awful season.
I’m so glad Leicester are heading towards champions league I miss it when they were in it
Sheffield United has no futball.
Big up illiman on his debut
Mighty mighty foxes! 🐺⚽
Nacho man looked like he was on the verge of tears after getting his first hat-trick. Gotta feel sorry for him, had a ton of potential but had a hard time at Leicester. Didn't help with Vardy overshadowing him massively.
I used this guy in my career mode all the time during fifa 16 times
leicester should be arrested and fined for playing music after every goal
Perez deserves a Spain call up.
You’re nothing special we lose every week
liverpool fans wondering how iheanacho couldnt finish for leicester against city in 18/19 :(
real definition of boys against men
It's like kicking a puppy
We're Leicester incredible today or were Sheff U terrible? Mixture of both or maybe we were just terrible, wouldn't win a game in Championship playing like that not a chance.
You just knew that was gonna happen
I feel bad for Ramsdale the goalkeeper.
2:17 Messi champions league final 2011. 😄
Could have been double figures!
more clueless owners in football no nothing about the game bye bye
i love this commentator
Iheanacho is a goat bruv, no 🧢
That was the performance of a club that has just had it's heart ripped out.  It's sad that both Sheffield clubs are probably going to be knocking around in league one for a long time going by how both clubs are being run.
Three of the best he’s made them pay and that completes a wonderful hat trick
Wow
1:56 you can hear ramsdale shouting what the f*ck are you doing
Sheffield United are the new Huddersfield, achieve miracles for a few years, reality hits, sack the man that made those dreams realities, then rot in the championship
Stop... stop... he’s already dead
Deserved for United after sacking Wilder
Is that 3 assists for Vardy
Goodluck to Kelechi and Leceister
Happy for kelechi, I knew he wasn’t just a flop
Iheanacho finally living up to his career mode potential.
One team on their game today the other very off colour
15 million for that trash goalkeeper was illegal
What a performance from the boys
You can really see Iheanacho thriving from Vardy
Feel like people forget how much of a complete player Vardy is. So much more than just a clinical finisher
This season iheanacho is in the top 5 best players in the prem
One team on their game today... the other very much off colour
I know Sheffield have been bad this season, but now that Wilder is gone it’s gotten worse. Not even a shot the whole game and had less than 30% possession. Feel terrible for this group of boys
so this is what he is really capable of...
I lived in Leicester years ago and I have never seen so many damaged birds in my life proper head jobs with deep rooted problems. Only thing I can say is they do love to suck down there so that's the only plus point, definitely a city of hebephiles.
One way traffic.
Leicester are the true champions this season.
Since when was MSN back together??
Aaron ramsdale is absolutely dogshit back to back relegations can't see another premier league club wanting him next season
The goal music hadn’t even finished before the next goal was scored
Sensational from Kelechi.   Brilliant goals and brilliant team performance.
Kel>ronaldo
1:00 faaaavaaaardy
Iheanacho’s third goal= sweet
Iheanacho's form recently has been incredible!😃
Im Igbo and I'm so happy for ihenacho, all hail Biafra 🤲🏾🌟🌟
Congratulation to Kelechi Iheanacho. I just wish he continues with his fine form. It is nice to see him scoring goals for his club. Lots of love from Manchester!
Well played Leicester city
Brilliant
I'm early
Yes my what if card get upgraded
“One team very on their game, another very off colour”
Everyone needs a teammate like Vardy
Leicester should be in the cl next season
The blades have really been put to the sword
I feel bad for Sheffield Utd hearing Leicester’s goal song every few minutes 😂
Vardy is doing a great impersonation of Kane with all these assists
I'm wondering how Sky Sports have made 3 minutes out of a 5-0 score line
Good one Kelechi
Leicester show no mercy when they get going ask Southampton lmfao 🤣🤣😭
My favourite part is the music
Iheanacho for Ballon D'Or
I'm so shocked that the people called him overrated. Iheanacho is class
Iheanacho is underrated
Whose Sheffield Uniteds manager Oh wait no one cares their gonna get relegated anyways
imagine coming to a side as a temporary manager only to lose 5 nil lol
KELECHI THE NIGERIAN PRINCE
haha he’s in my fpl
Poor Sheffield United, they went from being on the brink of European football to diving head first into the Championship
Every one is talking about Iheanacho but no ones talking about how good Vardy was, hatrick of assists
One team has looked bright and the other very off colour
Iheanacho is a beast at the moment
Iheanacho > pele
me who swapped out vardy in fpl uh oh
Leicester thrashed them poor start for Sheffield uniteds manager
Leicester - scored 5 goals  Roy keane “ that’s their job “
Ayoze made a huge diffence today what a player
Just give iheanacho the ballandor already
Maybe now the Sheffield Utd board will now appreciate the job Wilder did with that squad and should've tried harder to keep him.
ThEy ArE uNlUcKy  ThEy OnLy LoSe By On E gOaL
Watch Sheffield turn up against chelsea 🤣
About time
That's what happens when you appoint a manager called 'Heckingbottom'
So glad to see iheanacho scoring he’s on fire!!! 😎
That’s what Sheffield get for sacking wilder
One team on form, the other very off colour...
I had ineocho as captain
Has anyone seen the final fixtures for Leicester top 4 might be hard
MY STRIKERS
Hope Sheffield enjoy championship next season. Then league 1.
when Leicester start getting links with strikers Ihenachcho starts scoring😂😂👌🏾
If only they kept wilder
Vardy getting back on form. 2 assists
0:36 he’s just a b-tec ronaldo
What were they expecting to happen sacking Wilder 28 games into the season? Poor management by the board
Just put Sheffield United out their misery already
Iheanacho a different breed
Worst performance I've seen in over 5 years...that's what happens when you sack one of the best managers in league though 🙄   Wilder, you're always welcome back pal 🤣⚔
So pleased for Kelechi, really deserved!
Kelechi
The only points sheffield were getting were if the coach driver got done for speeding on the way home
Yeah, no chance of Sheffield United surviving relegation
