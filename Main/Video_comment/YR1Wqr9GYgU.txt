The only people who hurt you are the ones you love 😂
Im sorry Im not feeling it, But to be fair I don’t feel any of this style rap. Every rapper seems to be chasing this same technique and trying to rap about the same thing.  Narcissistic Rap is getting tired. Im Im Im, Me, Me, Me, I have this, Im gonna do this, Im gonna do that. Oh and lets not forget how they are gonna murder everyone. I just can’t do it, I guess the older you get the more it amazes you that rap is and always been a 90percent selfish genre of music. Running around a city you don’t own but think you do. Chasing money and respect until somebody, who’s nobody, kills you, or you become a so called sellout because you take the big deal that gets you out the hood. Rap isn’t the elevated way in life, Rap is the poisonous mentality that all the big industries want everyone to feed into. Rap makes more money in every other factor than its own.   Foreign Clothing, Jewelry, Cars, and even the biggest money maker, the criminal industry. As long as Rap exist, the generations will flow in like clockwork making every industry wealthy except its own. Now you can understand why the sellouts leave.   But definitely Im not feeling it.
That second verse different 🔥🔥🔥

What’s the sample on this beat… sounds like flashing lights kinda at the start
Should’ve won the rap game
Sound like Durkio...
I like this kid .. But singing and rapping about "Murder"  and "Guns"  you know he ain't built for that Life or even Lived it !!!   Sad truth is He's promoting The Demons Energy through his music to the Youths that already don't have self worth to humanity !!   This is Low Energy Vibrational Music  to keep them under a Spell !   WAKE UP  it's a Spiritual Warfare Going On and The Most don't Know it !!!
This is lit and he's mad cute
My dude be rocking !!! Keep it coming

I have a teenage daughter that I don’t mind her listening to you and I allow her to go your concert for the first time. Please stay true to your loyal fans and try not to change too much to get more followers. Your older loyal fan from when you were on rap game.

“I got PTSD I’m who you can’t T-E-S-T” talk that talk🗣🗣🗣 boy snapping on EVERY SONG!🔥🐐
Lyrics Bellow  Murder I don't want to catch a murder Yes While your posting weapons down below If yall wasn't on my dick I'd get along with yall Yes I'm one of a kind I don't belong with yall Yes I keep a clip but a full clip I'm going to get it on with yall Keep a chopper on my side like I'm Superman We not going to let him rock if your on his side we might just shoot the man Keep a gun with loaded clips you test me you're a stupid man Try To tell me I aint shit she must have forgot who I am I got PTSD I am who you t-e-s-t I'm a shooter I go hard in this bitch like a lefty Lifes as bitch but I'm still going to do what she let me When you had them problems You must have forgot who called to get me  Murder I don't want to catch a murder But I might have to catch a murder Because if a nigga test me he going to get murdered Murder I don't want to catch a murder But I might have to catch a murder Because if a nigga test me he going to get murdered  I used to send my killers to his section when he needed protection Everyday I walk with Smith and Westons I can't show affection I get picky with these bitches sometimes I can't make selections I'm just trying to guide my killers point them in the right direction I heard my dog was on his ass I told him to let him rock Cos I'm going to see him when I see him and I ain't going to let him rock You be in the kitchen cant take heat but you try to stir the pot Heard he keep sneak this and if we don't see him were going to disturb his block And we pull up windows tinted just to disturb the opps I got twin glocks with no safety what you worried about And at this point we don't take L's we just serving them out He scared to look me in my eyes fuck is he nervous about? If yall see demons in my whip yall better pray to God If he ain't mentioning no price we ain't going to take the drop I know top shottas in his area ready to take a charge And if it's war we ain't going to back down we going to get involved  Murder I don't want to catch a murder But I might have to catch a murder Because if a nigga test me he going to get murdered Murder I don't want to catch a murder But I might have to catch a murder Because if a nigga test me he going to get murdered
Hard 🐐
