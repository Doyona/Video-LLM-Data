Welcome to Prehistoric Past of 65 million years ago in Late Cretaceous Period from Jurassic Park Series! From: Nikolas James William Sylvester

R.I.P Film Because he got Burned in the Drive in Theater
The prologue makes it look like they can make a documentary
Repetición de la película Nosotros tan grande creo que dinosaurio tan grande Cállate cotizando la película Qué dice creo que la película de dinosaurio

Like this prologue is amazing and both Rexy the Tryannosaurus Rex and Zeb the Giganotosaurus were very amazing in this one. The landscapes were amazing and beautiful as well which will set up for the actual movie of Jurassic World Dominion.
I remember that at this time i was 10, when i watched this for first time i was so excited, everyday i said to myself “i cant wait to watch this movie” i saw Jurassic World Dominion plublicities everywhere, in the stores, in the supermarkets, in mc donalds i remember there was toys of the movie, and i remember buyng the Rexy mattel toy, and i still cant believe this was 3 years ago…
Why did this have to be so much better than the actual movie? Personally, my favorite detail is the Giga using its head like a battering ram.
THIS IS WHAT THE MOVIE SHOULD'VE BEEN ABOUT, DINOSAURS ON THE MAINLAND, BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
How is it that this prologue is way better than the actual film?
0:58 Job 40:15-19 15  “Look at Behemoth, which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox. 16  What strength it has in its loins, what power in the muscles of its belly! 17  Its tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are close-knit. 18  Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like rods of iron. 19  It ranks first among the works of God.”
I’ll Like That Scene Was On Peacock And Starz
More shorts videos
I bought the movie for this scene to see what happens mfs deleted it from the movie
If this had been the actual film it would have been a classic.  Instead we got... ::gestures at everything:::
I like how the movies
I will never forgive them for not showing this in the theaters
better than the movie;) we actually got dinosaurs living among us with people running in fear, kinda makes you think about how dumb the movie really was not to include stuff like this, aside from like a minute in Malta we don't ever see much of people being attacked
This reminds me of the War for Cybertron
"Oooh aaah that's how it always starts but then there's running and screaming" - Ian Malcom saying Dominion sucks
Still pissed this wasn't in the main movie when it came out.  this would have hyped up the audience better.  But hey modern audiences today don't like to be in long films.   Wimps.
Rexy first fight with zeb when The Prologue (65 mya) and now rexy rematch with zeb in the forest and biosyn coro
Does anyone know how many Pteranodons there were from 1:13 to 1:27?
In a world where disosaurs are common place, every dangerous one would be added to a database and tracked in order to not endanger civilians.
The only enjoyable flick from the Jurassic World trilogy

This is the 1000 comment I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!  HE IS PERFECT
4:36 what can be a problem?
5:12
4:28 Marques brownlee???
0:30
4:46 at speed 0.25x rexy has a broken tooth am I the only who noticed that? 😳
0:00 Lights, Camera, Action!
4:20 Is nobody gonna talk about how he landed face flat on rexys feet?
What happened with this scene in the movie?
Haci fueron hace millones de años
Nobody commented on the fleeting but disgusting bit of "woke-ness" that the producers felt needed to be included in this sequence,  It'll go by most in the audience unnoticed,  but provoke a weary eyeroll in the more perceptive. It boggles the mind that this otherwise awesome prologue was not included in the theatrical final cut of the film.
This prologue was 10000 times better than the they put in the movie 🤦🏻‍♀️
Love this so much!! They should've kept this for the opening of the movie. Rexy is #1!!!
I wont pay what there asking for I'm not getting Ripped off by these Companies anymore the movie wasn't that good either.  Part 4 part 5 was way better.
My god this is amazing still makes me hyped for the movie even after I've seen it, a crime this wasn't in the movie.
This was really good, why was it removed from the movie? I really hope that when it comes to homes we get a uncut version. You can tell this was cut because in the helicopter the biosyn guy said they catched a T-Rex shortly before their arrival.
I want to see the new movie
can you please make more of these! this was better than dominion 😔
Where is this scene.. @universalstudio Answer to us I really disappointed with the concluded movie...  It could've been way better..  Like previous ones The last movie of Jurassic era was not as much grand as it should be...
Soooooo. Where was this in the film? Kinda feel like we got lied to
They really should have left this in the Dominion movie, really bad move by the higher ups.
So… I’m hoping for an extended cut of Dominion. Theatrical is a solid movie, a blast to watch.   This needed to be at the start of the film.   Will we end up getting a 3 hour Jurassic World: Dominion when it hits home video? I certainly hope so.
Why did you not put this scene in the movie why this opening was not shown in the movie
I saw the movie and why did you not put this scene in the movie because I knew this was the opening to the movie but the opening was the mosasaurs attack a boat and the opening was different and throughout the whole movie this opening scene did not come out in the movie and was not shown so why did you delete this scene from the movie it would be way better with this in the movie and after this scene you can put the dinosaurs in our world scene with mosasaurs
Somehow this wasn't even in the movie.
Why wasn’t all this in the movie
I liked this much more than the movie tbh
So what happened between this and the actual movie? Because man was that a let down
Well, I finally got to see Jurassic World Dominion and I can't believe the prologue wasn't included for it.  I know it would've made the movie a little longer, but still, I wish the prologue had been included.  It just didn't seem complete without the prologue.
It was not in the movie!
Why wasn’t this in the movie?
Just watched the film! Really great movie. I just wished there was an actual continuation of this scene.
I like the part where this was in the movie
Is it possible this prologue 🎥can make it on the Blu-ray release please;-) I think many would want this and agree ✅😃
So much better than the shitty buzzfeed Intro that they replaced it with
This looks awesome & I'm lookin; forward to seeing the film!
I think it would be great if they would make another movie that takes place between JW: Fallen Kingdom and JW: Dominion. In this installment they could show us what happend to the world in those 4 years. The movie would exist out of scenes like the one’s we saw at the beginning of JW: Dominion (the news reports and stuff), the San Diego scène from The Lost Word JP, the campsite scène from Battle at Big Rock and much more! I think that JW: Dominion was great, but it missed scènes with dinosaurs rampaging in city’s and stuff. In JW: Dominion 4 years have already gone by and they only showed us some news reports from a few incidents and told us that the eco system has evolved (and will collapse) because of these creatures
1993 animation is still better.
Its hard to say, but this is better than the entire movie.
Hey this scene are not in the film ... Cast very stupid
Hoping in the digital release, this prologue would be included inside the film file. Too bad they didn't include this in the theatrical version. what a waste of vfx and cgi
Wait, if the Feathered Rex’s DNA was used to make Rexy, doesn’t that kinda of make the Feathered Rex, Rexy’s mother or father?
Dreadnoughtus ❤️🦕
i absoulutely adore, that the giga has the spore roar in its sounds
Can't wait for the movie dude Jurassic world Dominion coming June 10th 2022 Beyond excited
2 hours and 21 minutes left to go..
Which of the prologue will be in the final cut: dinosaurs before the events of Jurassic Park or Rexy on rampage at drive in theater?
Imagine the giga was in the original jurassIc park but eluded the settlers don’t n iurassic world
me too
try to watch this with your cat. you gonna suprise how cat react this scenes.
2:31 what is the name of that little dinosaur (so cute)
Jurassic World Let’s Celebrate
woah i did not see that coming its the dinisour logo on earth
This is Rexy's backstory
Epic I can’t wait🔥
Neat documentary, though the part with the helicopter seems less realistic.
T rex is still alive
Обожаю все части этого фильма. Жду с нетерпением.
That Group of #Triceratops was Amazing....😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Ahh yes Nevermind the millions of years of age gaps between some species

What happened to the Rex ? Did it just blend in the background with some hitherto-unknown camouflage capability ? And what's with the whole JP-JW series and piss-poor marksmanship ?  Its almost comical how you now come to expect that chopper borne shooters aren't going to cause any damage to the dinos.
Increíble una representación del cretácico en la franquicias es algo magnífico aunque el giganotosaurus párese un carcharodontosaurus
Rexy: calm down, I just want to watch movie in theatre
i hav been watchiing since i was 9
4:43
Poor rexy 😂
QUE LINDA  PELIQULA🤯♥️😱
J'adore
3:16 NOOOOOOOOOO!!! NOT AGAIN!!!  JP3 PTSD ALL OVER AGAIN!!!☹️😖😫😢😭
I really like the detail put in on the Tyrannosaurus 65 million years before and after.
And what’s the screen after the title card ? Boom Chris Pratts face!!!!
I wish more movies do this. So we can get a feel of what’s coming on.
Hhmm... Vehicle plate number of WM6 52F at 4:39. Is that an Easter egg? :->
The first one scary I see it at 11 years old OMG and the other ones were ok
Rexy is so beautiful just like I remembered her😍💯💜😊👍
Don’t they know all you need to do is not move.
4:28 I wish T-Rex had eaten them
yeah graphics are cool! the intro i didnt like at all ....
Even though Giga and T Rex didn't live during the same time I do believe a Giganotosaurus can kill a T Rex
so which of the 50000 genders that ''progressives ''' think there is will this t rex be????????
so how many woke t rex are in it ???? ahahaha
THAT THEME!!!! goosebumps!!
The very first 5 minutes of the movie! Disney's Dinosaur and 2001: A Space Odyssey vibes.
Wow, I liked it. Also I am looking forward to watch the 6 Jurassic films soon. Because I do like the  Dinosaurs Species and some Dangerous Hybrids.
3:35 The scene with the mosquito, I love how it actually shows the mosquito’s abdomen swelling up with blood.
Dinosaurs died out in Noah's Flood.
when will Jurassic world dominion come out.
Im still wondering how many times i have watched this. 😁
Had To Watch This Movie
I lo e dominio in 4K
Im pretty sure the large carnivore in the beginning is a giga, but I keep doubting it because of the extreme difference between it and the one from Jurassic world evo
What about the I rex
We must be patient everyone it's 2022 and we just got to wait 6 months
Stupid Iguanodon. It was all his fault LOL
I Like How The Giga Basically Told The Other Dinasour... "Get Out Of Here.. I Got This" Then He Walks Off Then Boom... Trex Comes Thru
In the 90's he would've eaten someone. Now these things aren't scary anmyre, they just walk around a bit.
PLEASE BRING A NEW HYBRID SPINORAPTOR IN DOMINION
3:04 Tyrannosaurus Rex roars 4:43 Rexy roars
@1:48  A Jurassic chicken...  Universals version of a Porg.
Anyone else notice that the T-Rex and Giga's fight choreography was based on the 1925 silent film adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World? 😁
After seeing dinosaurs get loose in 2 different parks, in San Diego and at a black market auction, it will be a refreshing plot change to see them get loose at a drive-in movie.
i can't wait for dominion to come out in Friday, June 10, 2022.
Iam watched Jurassic world Domainan trailer is very nice to see special graphic effect and Dolby sound system is very excellent, iam waiting to screen in theatre in Jurassic world Domainan full movie upcoming next 2022 year.👍💯👌🤓
I'm glad that the giga didn't kill rexy and it was just another t rex
This is so exciting to see Jurassic World Dominion when it comes out next year.
Guys,look at the Movie:Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom.See,this is JURASSIC WORLD FALLEN KINGDOM PART 2 and not Jurassic World Dominion.Get ready for Part 2 !!!

Giganotosaurus Is Acting Like A Crocodile Opening Its Mouth And Getting An Animal To Pick Food Of Its Mouth!
I wish legendary logo was on universal right about now
Giga was just chilling until Rex came along
1:25 That Quetzalcoatlus bellow is perfect. So intimidating and poweful.
Can we just a series bout this instead... I can watch this all day
Ya ando bien emocionado banda, se van a armar los dinomadrazos
Dude ive waatched this like a billion times since it came out and everytime i watch the intro i want to cry its so beautifuul
How disrespectful to the star of the franchise to have him losing to the new bad guy, they didn't learned from jp3
I think its funny that more people got hurt panicking than from anything rexy did.
when is it gonna come out eh?
Thats a big tranquilizers
when is the trailer available
И теперь весь фильм они будут гоняться за тирексом?
Good
Blue 🥺😢😭
Dear Jurassic Wrold Official. T-rex and giga in the same time line ? ? ? :D Nice drugs.
2022
23 of may is the release date in my theory.
Jurassic Park Jurassic World Jurassic Univese?
why is a cold blooded dinosaur on a rampage in a part of the world where humans are wearing jackets? suspension of disbelief destroyed...
In case all of you need to know, I've been a Jurassic Park fan for 25 years!!!!!!! This will be both my anniversary and birthday movie too!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I even love the way how real our dinosaur friends look especially this excellent prologue!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WOW! This is brilliant!!!! Love the giganotosaurus!
Although Giga and Rex were separated 30 million years apart plus two continents its safe to say that this scenario never happend. Love the design of the Giga far better then evolutions version except for the quasimodo hunchback.
Goosebumps ♥️
So now I can understand why the Trex want to push down the indominus to ground. Cause he before died get that, but she don't matter of Giga was much heavier and stronger than him...
waitwait, let me get this straight, 65 million years later? wouldn't tht mean the old characters like (Owen n Claire) are death!?
Wow just wow, absolutely stunning and terrifying at the same time!
I'm soooo excited for this!!!! But, can someone explain how the dinosaurs are having children when they were all created as females? 🤔
Is there a significance to the movies on the sign at the drive-in theater (American Graffiti and Flash Gordon) ?
For some reason the lack of sound when the trex bumps the cars walking through the drive in bothers me — like I feel like there should’ve been a sound of metal smashing or something.  And wish the foot stomps sounded like they did in JPark
I have a theory that the "modern day" scene is a flashback to San Diego. The cars and clothes and overall style of everything looks very 90's,including not a smart device in sight. Also there aren't any visible scars on the Rex that are evident on Rexy in Fallen Kingdom and this Rex has a colour pattern similar to the one from The Lost World.
4:25 I've heard of people who don't even know there is a COVID-19 pandemic going on so in my opinion this is fairly accurate
I’m so watching this movie 🎥 in 4DX 🦕🦖
Can we talk about Quetzalcoatlus? Something about the wing and biting sounds, the echoing screech and their pure enormous size is soo… _beautiful_
Gorgeous footage, love the atmosphere it created with the Cretaceous period scene
It has been proved that most of these animals had feathers. I only saw a few. At least the T-Rex, according to many researchs had them. I guess it wont look so terrifying with a feather coat on its body.
What was the point of the Cretaceous scene? Put the entire film in that era then you'll have my attention. Otherwise the film is just about rescuing stupid kids who end up saving the day. Again.  And apparently all this footage does not appear in the film...so again, what was the point?
Alan Grant: Dinosaurs and Man, two species separated by 65 Million Years of evolution have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together. How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?  Ian Malcolm: Taking Dinosaurs off this island is the worst idea in the long, sad history of bad ideas.   Owen Grady: It’s gonna be just like taking a walk in the woods, 65 Million Years Ago.  Claire Dearing: Do you remember the first time you saw a dinosaur? First time you see them, it’s like a miracle.   I adore those lines in the Jurassic Series from Jurassic Park to Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom and hopefully they put up the callback quotes for Jurassic World Dominion as well as new quotes on the way just for memories in my opinion.  As for the prologue for Jurassic World Dominion in 4K, it’s looks really breathtaking and pretty nice. Like I said early on, this is gonna be like the Next Dinosaur 2000, the Next Speckles Movie and the Next Walking with Dinosaurs Movie all over again but in Jurassic World Version with the breathtaking animation of the dinosaurs and man, it looks very impressive and very beautiful in my opinion. Honestly, I’m very excited to see how great this movie really is in my opinion and how much of a huge Jurassic Fan I am from Jurassic Park to Camp Cretaceous and I’m definitely enjoying this franchise more than the Disney movies in the modern day in my opinion.  I really wish Colin Trevorrow could do more of these dinosaurs living in their natural habitat for the next generations of the Jurassic Series because this looks visually groundbreaking. Like Owen Grady said: It’s like taking a stroll to the woods, 65 Million Years Ago. Like Ian Malcolm always said: Life Cannot Be Contained, Life Breaks Free and Life Finds A Way. Like Klayton Fioriti always said: As Always, Take It Easy.
Don't hit a 13 meters beast from 10 meters .... change job KID😜
I hope we get to see the Spinosaurus in this one!
When is the dominion trailer coming out
Why this Prologue,  Any Surprises or Ester egg here?
Goosebumps man. Goosebumps.
Super 👌👌👌👌👌
It's in the light of a huge cinema projection. It's also standing still.  1. how did they miss it with the tranquiliser gun? 2. how did they lose sight of it?
Life always finds a way...
perfect
This looks like a return to form! Love it. Looks less plastic and more grainy.  Let’s hope they are not cramming in 2000+ VFX shots. It is lazy and the effect of wonder of these animals diminished. JP1 had just 63 VFX shots with the use of practical and CGI. This made the story more compelling and gave you the idea the dinosaurs were everywhere.  Also nice to see the animation is not super duper fluid. In my opinion the JWW movies have doubled down on super fluid and fast movement. Whilst comparing this to the first 2 movies, the bigger dinosaurs were less agile (which makes sense).
All animals shown (please do correct me or add more): 1: (Brachiosaurus?), 2: Quetzalcoatlus, 3:Ankylosaurus, 4: Pteranodon/pterodactyl, 5: Oviraptor, 6: Nasutoceratops, 7: Iguanodon, 8: (Mapusaurs), 9: T-rex Those in () are those i'm not confident in
The Son of Trevorrow...
Ok i love how its the US Fish And Wildlife Service tracking rexy
I watched all the Jurassic movies so to see this one I am excited
2nd Chris Pratt movie with a let’s all go to the lobby
I love how in this movie they add in how the dinosaurs don’t technically look how they did in the movies and then add that in the film I’m so excited
10/10🥲👍👍😭😭😭😭😭 me love Dion
This honestly did a better job of giving the illusion that this really is prehistoric times then other shows/movies have, maybe it’s just the fact that the T Rex/Anky’s/Pteranodons/Nasutoceratops are all their JW styles but with a little more accuracy to them that creates the effect, but mostly i think it’s the bright blinding lighting that almost makes it look like old low quality natural film instead of clear staged lighting, it really gives it the natural/old effect, as well as the lack of music score or narration, the narration and music in WWD/other dinosaur documentaries kinda kill the feeling, where as this is just straight up prehistoric nature with no interruptions. It is very well done and i hope to see future Dinosaur Documentaries take note of this. 👏
3:39 that is the mosquito trapped in amber that Rexy's DNA was derived from to create(clone) Rexy in the first jurassic movies, it sucked the t rex blood thats why it had the t rex DNA(great detail the movie makers made). So basically Rexy is a reincarnation of that dead t rex the gigantosaurus killed. Nice.  They put furs on the t rex which is the modren accurate correct version(dinosaurs have furs and feathers). The Rexy one doesnt have furs cos shes just an altered clone of the original t rex. Good job on the cgi people.
4:19 And just like that, everybody at that theater who survived the bill Rex's rampage in San Diego during the climax of The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) began having flashbacks
Epic 4K, sharper and more realistic, boy am I gonna enjoy the full movie
I am so excited for this movie
I cannot believe you kept the name Dominion after the Dominion voting machine scandal. 🥴
I predict this will be the movie to bring back the cinema culture since COVID started. It will be a massive hit. The world is waiting 🇳🇬🇳🇬♥️
They grew up so fast ♥🤣
Can’t Wait For JWD!
So EXCITED for this!!! Looks like the one of the best dinosaur movies to date!!
This is insane
Nice aim kid
Whoooooo! I’m soo excited!!!
Giga looks awful. They made a parody of Godzilla instead of a real giganotosaurus
Looks like the primeval parts were filmed on Socotra Island in Yemen? Those dragon blood trees are very distinctive
My goodness, *this* is a movie I'm excited for!
Beyaz perdede dinazor izlemek kadar keyifli bir şey yok
T-rex died?!
They sent a chopper with 1 tranq rifle after a free roaming T-Rex? Surprised there's no national guard or at the very least a cop 🤣
🤩🤩🤩
🤩🤩🤩
🤩🤩🤩
I love ankylosaurus sounds
Do they fined the shaving foam
Wow wow  amazing   i wanna watch the movie now  . Im super hype. Is 1 giganotosaurus or charcharadontosaurus of africa. Becuase no is abelidosauride. Quetzalcoatl looking good. I wanna see trikes,deinonychus,mosasaur,allosaurus,spino therizino or i dont know 1 megalodon or 1 Sauropagananx   Looking good the movie but be careful . The ark movie is coming.
Can everyone just leave them alone they’re not doing anything wrong they’re just minding their own business
This is amazing
It all started here. 🦖🦕 #JurassicWorld #JurassicWorldDominion
All the times they show a new dangerous dinosaur they kill the T-Rex just to show how strong the new pet is. Like in jurassic Park 3 where the spinosaurus win against the Rex while we all know that a spino wouldn't be able to kill a Rex. The Rex have a way stronger bite
AHHH OMG IM DO EXCITEDD
Funny thing I just resumed playing Ark 2 days ago and just got notified of this, amazing CG, looks like its gonna be the next Lion King
Team Dominion or Team Fallen Kingdom Im team dominion
Giganto suck! T REX ROCK!!
I love the way you guys are making more Jurassic park franchises you keep making it better and better
Rexy, the old girl return! 4:43
poor rexy, she means human no harm, yet still hunted by human
Wait the T-Rex now has feathers? [Including the other dinosaurs]
Boring
More of these longer
This just keeps getting worse
I could literally watch a 2 1/2 hour film that takes place during the time of the dinosaurs that is shot like a nature documentary. Then it ends with the astroid impact. Thats a billion dollar movie right there.
I've watched this numerous amounts of times and cannot get over how beautiful this is. Gets me so excited for Dominion in 2022!
Ok, this prologue in 4K is breath taking.
Ahora, la historia fue acaba.
dinosaurs are back !
Now I want Jurassic park to do a whole movie just with the dinosaurs at their prime with no humans because I was so invested in the flashback. I don’t even need a narration just prehistoric nature doing it’s thing.
Wow! As if we were truly there. Crazy!
Yes! So happy that I can see this!
Seriously Jurassic world? I know you already did feather on your Dino But that oviraptor? What's wrong with the anatomy? Pronated arms Bad feather reconstruction    Come on this isn't 19s film anymore
We can see megalodon??
Finally they've gone to make feathered dinosaurs, with the excuse of problems caused by dinosaur DNA repaired by other DNA and DNA sequensation mistakes, to explain the feather-less cloned dinosaurs.
THIS IS COOOOOOOOL!!!!
"Congrats to Everyone who is early and found this comment"
That was crazy
One thing I noticed is looking closely at the close up the rexes feet during their little circle round, the giga is just starting up it's movement and later the rex was the first to go for the attack.  The rex was literally the attacker and the giga the defender and not the other way around.
Мы ждали, мы дождались!
so i am the only one who hated it
Imagine being Rexy and practically getting reincarnated 67 million years later
So jurassic park 2 all over again
The beginning was beautiful
Can’t be worse than the last one… can it?
WELCOME TO GODZILLASAURUS DOMINION
that was painful to watch, there is so much wrong with it that it hurts.
How do you lose track of an animal that can't run?
Idk man, it's cool and all, but it just doesn't seem much like jurassic World. I mean, in some scenes yes, but mostly seems different. Also, why does the giga look SO different to the one in jurassic world evolution??? Its cool but yea. If It didn't have the title as jurassic world, I couldn't tell till the last minute. Maybe I'm just picky. The giga also looks kinda like a hypo from the isle just to point out.
Gonna be the best part of the movie. All downhill from here.
wow and dinosaurus new good
maybe i'm the only one who believes, this film will be not worth... bad director, cgi, and the main problem of the whole Jurassic World is following - it was made for kids and families, that's why it's impossible to see realistic looking and living T rex tearing people up like the first one in my favorite Jurassic park from Steven Spielberg
I wish the fight was a bit longer to be though
Omg
Splendid details on all dinosaurs especially for the  nasutoceratops with broken horn
I guess every 3ed JP the dinos are on human land. Last time SD.
Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaake !
Dinosaurs/Pterosaurs in order of appearance: Dreadnoughtus, Pteranodon, Quetzalcoatlus, Ankylosaurus, Oviraptor, Nasutoceratops, Moros intrepidus, Giganotosaurus, Iguanodon, Tyrannosaurus rex.
There’s no feasible way it can be any worse than the previous film. Would have been nice to see them show the dinosaurs in the past with an updated understanding of how we think they looked, feathers and all. Would have tied in well with dialogue established in World.
dinosaurs living among us?!?!?
Definitely Like that the Rex is acting in a more realistic way. Snapping it's jaws in a similar way that  birds do. And more importantly it just wants people to get out of it's way so it can escape. Like the only reason why the buck was displaying hyper aggressive behaviour was because it was essentially on stimulants. I'm honestly just keen to see these animals act like relative normal animals considering none of these animals are geneticly identical to the animals they look like
I was just wishing for a new movie

Imagine a documentary being this level instead of the low budget ones we’ve seen.
imagine fighting with tiny hands
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Esperando al espino de cmp cretaceus
how do you lose track of a T-Rex in the first place?
BEUH I BEEN WAITING FOR 5 FREAKING UEARS FOR THIS MOVIE TO COME OUT NOW IM WAITING 6
T-rex always given up their necks.
👍👍💙👍👍
If only we had more dinosaur shows and films like those few minutes in the Cretaceous (barring the glaring inaccuracies, obviously). Seriously, can we PLEASE just have a modern spiritual successor to Walking With Dinosaurs already?!
So now the t-Rex has feathers?!?!? I really hate scientist!!!
i cant belive a couple is kissing and did not hear the dino that was there
So he was shooting a dark towards the T-rex's skull, where it's enter the skin and bounce off the bone, instead of the neck where it would have still hit and stayed put.  GREAAAT.... can't wait to see the f' up in this one...
Gotta love how Rexy shows up!!!! She is like " what did I miss, oh hey everybody!"
Is this just me or does this look realer than real life.
Why did u make the trek die… not watching it anymore
If only we had more dinosaur shows and films like those few minutes in the Cretaceous (barring the glaring inaccuracies, obviously). Seriously, can we PLEASE just have a modern spiritual successor to Walking With Dinosaurs already?!
Hard to think earth was like this a few million years back. These magnificent beasts have been here for the past million years. Now we look at some places today and we would never think this was around.
Remastered Giganotosaurus!!!
can't wait to see it on the big screen
Actually looks very good
T-Rex - *Flipping cars since 1993*
Ok, they better have a pretty nice excuse for removing this Walking with Dinosaurs thing of beauty from a finished film than some banal, desperate attempt to squeeze it in 2 hours running time, or I'll be pissed, like... REAL HARD.
This movie comes out day after my birthday and you betcha I’m going to be camping outside the movie theater that night
Incredible !!!
Another deluded dino fight scene among two spices who never met each other.
Poor dinos, they are completly lost, what's Joe BIden doing ?! Lmao
Remember: This happened because the clone of some girl who died that we never met, released all of the dinosaurs into the world instead of dying, because "They're alive, like me."
I love that car just driving towards the T-rex, I feel like reverse would have been the optimal choice there...unless they wanted an up-close experience
Finally T. rex is feathered !!
God imagine if walking with dinosaurs was made with this CGI
put the first part on tv sections every one buys a tv.
Pobre rex también quería ver la película 😭
Wooooooowwwww
I love that they included feathers in some dinos, including the T-Rex.
1:57 Don't break the egg. Don't break the egg! Dam it! They clearly didn't learn anything recently about Oviraptor!
Bom
Despite the breathtaking CGI, there are still glaring problems that I just cannot ignore with the biggest offender being time jumping dinosaurs along with their designs especially when trying to convey the Cretaceous Period.
Giant chicken 🐓 accurate
The T-rex roar was created for the films based off a Walrus.
65mi? School use to say that, then they changed to to like 3,000 years ago... WHOS LYING
What I don't like about the new movies is their lighting. No natural lighting at all only bluish filter. No hate
this is gonna be epic!!!!! especially seeing giganotosaurus, iguanodon, oviraptor, and MORE!!!!!!
This is gonna be great
Jurassic world is the best
You like the money
Lol the Giganotosaurus
Ben fatto.
ThAt looks soo awful
Is these the movie
Run, Rexy! Save yourself! Lead the dinosaur revolution and get rid of these humans!
Jurassic Warpath 2  Do it..
I can now appreciate the fluffy rex even more, now that it's in 4K format.
This is the 1st time I have seen giga in Jurassic world.  After playing too much ark it must have been engraved in my mind that gigas were bigger than Rex but no.
Stop running it’s vision is based of movement
I can’t wait for giga to get Merced by Rexy and spino working together
When the giga snarled at the iguanadon he kinda snarled like E750 because every -time E750 snarls he hisses and grutals
I love the tiny detail showing the Rex is nervous about facing the Giga while the Giga isn't concerned at all about fighting the Rex. When the Rex snaps at the Giga, it has no reaction but when the Giga snaps back, the Rex flinches ever so slightly.
The CG is amazing but that awful giganotasaurus design makes it look less like a living animal and more like a monster also how did it get a time machine and travel thousands of miles north
1:44 Awhhh that poor little pterosaur fell in the water
Wow Giganotosaurus walk many miles to Montana before the asteroid hit 🦖🛑🌎
They should brought Cadillac cars so it would became unofficial adaptation of Cadillac and Dinosaur.
2:44 Anjanath vs Deviljho
I really wish we could get an accurate dino documentary with this kind of cgi. Most dino documentaries are animated really badly but imagine a scientifically accurate movie or series using this technology
I wish This was in the final cut
เข้าเมื่อไหร่ครับ
Dinosaurs?
In 4K looks better :)
I'm so excited for this as none of those stupid quotes and voice overs are there ..... We can simply just relax to the sound of the jurrasic nature....
Muito legal esse filme quero que lançe agora
I hope those vfx are not finished. If this is the final product then it's a massive downgrade.
Here come all the paleontologists to critique the trailer 😆
The dude who wrote the description of this video used among us and i can't think of it without being mad anymore.
Finally. Been waiting to watch this in the best quality. ;)
4k? Looks literally the same.  The image is smaller and has a filter. The only differences :/  Edit: It has a liiittle upgrade on the quality.
Love that they're directly showing that the animals in Jurassic Park aren't accurate representation of the real animal.  Had to do a double because I'm watching on my phone that T-Rex had feathers on it.
It looks fantastic. The dinosaur skin Is so much Better and... There Is the quetzalcoatl(wrote It without searching).
Nice!!! 😍😍😍🥰🦖🦕🦖🔥😍
They gave the T-rex subtle fur or feathers! Anyone noticed this? They're trying to make him more realistic to science!
That Giga will pay the ultimate price in the end and Rexy's going to be the one to demolish it. 💪🏼 Colin Trevorrow has said that the T-rex will remain the mascot and the main attraction of the Jurassic saga moving forward.
Is no one gonna FREAK about cretaceous Rexy having like this down feather like fuzz????
Come on, this is a little bit pathetic... 3 big sins (my point of view)  - They lost T-rex in the wood??? They did not see anything? Have you ever heard about night-vision?  - For 30 years, every news (in the movies) were about how T-rex recognize the environment: Do not shout, Do not run (stand still or lay down), do not make noises and do not play with light... Everybody running and screaming  - The girl and the two guys have not recognized that EVERYBODY is shouting around them?? Just sitting and watching the movie  Everything else is okey, however Hollywood still not able to leave behind the "typical sins".  I was a JP fan until the 3rd movie... (i also watched the JP1 in theater when i was 9). After JP3-4-5, i expect another big nothing... But considering that Jeff G will be part of the movie again, i have maybe a tiny little fate.
You must definitely go to the movie!
I don't like that they depicted Oviraptor as an egg thief even though that theory had been disproven ages ago.
This actually looks and sounds great... can't wait for a quipping  Chris Pratt, a broken family, and boring adventure music to ruin it all!
It's going to be a blockbuster movie!🦖
👎👎👎
I now need to know why they were rivals, was it territorial? Or vengeance for what the Giga deprived Rexy of?
Oh God.
65 Million years ago, an asteroid hit Earth, for context here is Nov 2021 PBS discussion on it: https://youtu.be/vRfABLCF9I4?t=1608
I feel they really nailed the Oviraptor.  It’s movements were so very avian.  Reminded me of the feral chickens which wander around where I live.
2:40 I'm having a lunch next to the one of the deadliest things in the world asleep, what could possibly go wrong?...
Wtf no comments on camp cretaceous s4 trailer but this one has it?
will the dracorex be here
oh yes
❤❤❤❤
Great
Cool
now this movie will be a banger in the franchise cant wait to see it
I’m just waiting for the leopluridon
It doesn`t matter what you know about Giga and T-Rex!!!!!!!!!!! I really almost forgive them about so quick losing of best biting carnivore ever...But if it took place in postapocalyptic world, not past time, Carl!!!! So many dinos in this video never met before...
1:48 I start to understand why they chose a different design for velociraptors in the movies. The legendary kitchen scene wouldn't be quite as dramatic with those hairy turkeys
That Mosquito 3:34
the only thing that was missing from the beginning is david attenborough's voice over :D
ついに来た ジュラシックワールドドミニオン 人間界に放たれた恐竜達の運命はどうなってしまうのか 来年の夏が待ちきれない！ めっちゃ楽しみ！
Still prefer Jurrasic Park's CGI...
There's no noticeable difference to me between the 4K and non-4K versions, but I still think you really NAILED that scene with the Oviraptor, that just looks and sounds soo real! I love that, it's so good, and I wished it was the same feel for the rest of this prologue, but the animation still mostly looks too much like animation and the filming is too clean so it loses that documentary feel.  Most of all though I despise that (while claiming you suddenly care about scientific accuracy) you not only put feathers on Moros intrepidus despite that we got no skin remnants preserved, but also that you put feathers on a T-REX, knowing tyrannosaurs didn't have them as we increasingly find out thanks to the skin imprints we are finding across the entire tyrannosaur body plan.  But not only that, you also repeated the same mistake of having another carnivore somehow manage to rapidly kill off a T-REX again! Like, I get that you're setting up a rivalry so that Rexy will kill the Giga in a rematch later in the film, but seriously, we've seen enough of the T-Rex being treated like this.  The T-Rex would not only be considerably more likely to come out of most battles alive (as the impressive and efficient killing machine that it was designed to be), especially as a Giga (much less a Spino) would not really be THAT capable of taking down something like a T-Rex, but the T-Rex is also the beloved icon and big star of this entire franchise and you DON'T just have another theropod kill it off as has been an unfortunate trend in this franchise (at least for JP3 and JWD, with it almost happening in JW1).  Thus far JP1, TLW, and JWFK are the only ones to get the T-Rex done right! I'm expecting better from you Universal and Trevorrow! Give us that rematch with the Spino along with the Giga rematch and you're at least starting to get back on track, hopefully...
4:51 The DFW chopper moment when you're taking control instead of bot
This is supeeer cooool!
If there's one thing the history of film evolution has taught us, it's that spoilers will not be contained. Spoilers break free, they expand to new platforms, and crash through feeds painfully, maybe even annoyingly, but, uh, well, there it is - Ian Malcolm

I’m just as hyped to see the movie as any one else but I wanna know a couple things. I know colin(the director) is a Dino nerd as well and in his interview or something with ign he said something like he was trying to show what the Dino’s were like 65 mya. The problem with these Dino’s in this prologue is basically none of them lived together or ever would have met.  We have a Dino from Asia (oviraptor) a Dino from Utah (nasutoceratops) a Dino from Canada, North America ( ankylosaurus)  a Dino from Texas( it looks like a quetz to me) another Dino from North America ( good ol Rex) and then the oddball from Argentina (the giga)  now I’m assuming that this is for some reason taking place in Africa? Because of the Savannah setting and the dragon blood trees?  But last time I checked none of those Dino’s are from Africa. Idk maybe I’m just picky but  the giga def don’t belong with the Rex. Just saying. Ik it’s a movie and all but when the director says he’s a “dino nerd” I would have thought he would have taken more like research on where these animals more than likely lived. But it is a movie so whatever. Gotta make that popcorn somehow
4K!
This is cinema.
After the disaster that was fallen kingdom hopefully dominion is better
What a cute and polite Rex who doesn't smash or eat anyone! Can we return to the time when Jurassic Park was horror movie? Even the velociraptor now is an adorable Mascotte like a cute cat with blue stripes 😩
Amazing 👏  Dominion is my most hyped 2022 film alongside Multiverse and Madness, Love and Thunder, Wakanda Forever and Minions 2
Great continue (more dinosaurs, none hybrid)
Recreate walking with dinosaurs with these graphics please 🥺🥺
Mosquitos really set it all in motion, being killed then alive millions of years later
So close, yet so far
I LOVE IT its gonna be sooo good 👍
Let’s goo I Waited to long for this I’m a nerd when it comes to dinasours heh….. my life is sad but I like it :( hehehehehe
Imagine watching this in a drive in theatre lol probably can when comes out and I bet $100000 spinosaurus is coming back in this movie I have no doubts
is it just me or did anyone else feel like watching a Nat Geo wild episode in the beginning?
This won’t be in the movie btw
Make a documentary about jurassic like no music; just the reality of pioneer creatures.
I was a new born baby at the time of JURASSIC PARK(1993). I saw this movie at the age of 6 years, from then to now all sequels are (super except Jurassic world) showing dinosaur atmosphere. I wish this movie make all records brake.
But Tyrannosaurus actually didn't have feathers...
Man, I’m starting to get the feeling a T.Rex is terrible in any fight against another dinosaur of equal size. I mean a T.Rex lost to a Spinosaurus, Rexy would’ve lost against the Indominus if not for Blue and the Mososuar, and this T.Rex also lost a fight.
Hola
Please no more hybrids dinosaurs
TO BE CONTINUED
This scene is some kind of like flashback on Cretaceous period opening of Jurassic World Dominion Chapters Act. 1. 0:30 In the morning in 65 Million Years ago the place called Cretaceous period. 2. 0:53 Some 4 Cretaceous Sauropod Dreadnoughtus are walking around the muddy lake, with flocks of Pteranodon, and four Giant Pterosaurs Quetzalcoatlus are scavenging the unknown animal carcass. 3. 1:30 A herd of Ankylosaurus are drinking in the river. 4. 1:36 The flock of Pteranodon are having a nesting ground on the canyons. 5. 1:48 An Oviraptor was raiding a nest of eggs from an unknown dinosaur, one of which the dinosaur ate in the process before getting distracted by another dinosaur's call (possibly the owner of the eggs). 6. 2:07 A whole herd of Nasutoceratops were seen crossing through a river and migrating to the Nesting Ground. 7. 2:30 A Moros scavenged morsels of meat stuck between the teeth Giganotosaurus, before the larger predator sensed something approaching and rose. A near by Iguanodon looks up at the Giganotosaurus, but is ignored as its attention is instead focused on the arrival of a feathery Tyrannosaurus Rex. The Tyrannosaurus circled and roared a challenge to the carnosaur, whom refused to back down and met the challenge. The Tyrannosaurus attempted to lunge at its rival's throat, but the Giganotosaurus deflected the hit by bashing its skull into the feathered tyrant reptile and stunned it just long enough to seize the Tyrannosaurus by the throat. The two turned and thrashed about, with the Giganotosaurus nearly slipping off a sheer drop into a sink hole behind it, before regaining it's footing and grip on its rival. Turning about, the Tyrannosaurus was killed; likely by a combination of the Giganotosaurus' teeth garroting its throat and the sudden drop into the sinkhole breaking its neck. After the battle, it leaves its enemy's body behind and walks off. A mosquito lands on and bites the deceased Tyrannosaurus Rex, giving the scientists of Jurassic Park the chance to create Rexy, the modern descendant of the very same T. Rex which died in the jaws of the Giganotosaurus. Finally. 3:46 In 65 Million Years Later the Rangers from Government of U.S. Fish, and Wildlife Service Department of the Interior are try to search, and follow Rexy the T-Rex to capture her, and put her to the holding pen. Rexy is enter the Outdoor Movie Parking Lot, the people are terrified, and panicking by Rexy is walking around the outdoor theater, the Ranger try to Tranquilize the T-Rex and missed, Rexy is running back to the forest and hide the Rangers.
That Oviraptor is so cute 😍
We need trailer soon
Hey she is a classy lady who just wanted to be taken to the movies.
My boy T-rex always getting clapped.
Admit it you screamed like a 4 years old girl cuz you got excited
Actually gonna cry
This prologue thing it reminds me watching F9 in IMAX version before the film
Can anyone confirm that whether this priceless prolouge will be shown in the full movie??
If the little girl who let the dinosaurs escape in the last movie doesn't get eaten in this one, then this movie isn't worth watching.
this time you guys gave T-rex hairy?
First half looked cool then second half literally lost all interest.
Espero que la mayoria de película se vea igual de real, hace mucho que no veo dinosaurios que no se vean evidentemente computarizados, se ve que ahora si le están hechando ganitas😁👍
I guess this is what happens when you bring extinct species back to life and they find themselves slots in the ecosystem again
3:20 for those wonder how the Rex died you can hear a loud crunch and see it’s head go limp
4:06
Simply breathtaking. Giga epic.
Rexy just casually walking in a movie theater and is hella confused why people are running from her😂😂
what. also  IS THAT THE STAN WINSTON T REX
THIS IS INSANE
Never in my life would I have thought they would add feathers to the t-rex in the Jurassic Park universe. Beautiful
And this is how Cadillacs & dinosaurs was born...
Well, besides the inaccurate portrayal of dinosaurs from different Times (and locations), it looks amazing. Universal should do a big budget "planet earth" style documentary about Dinosaurs. Give us a big budget Walking with Dinosaurs 2.0 . I would Watch.
The best part of this to me is how they made Rexy look like she did in the original JP. The way she looked in Jurassic World was kinda off to me, like her mouth was bigger or something, and her skin was more grey. This looks EXACTLY like the rex did in Jurassic Park, except for the accurately updated hands.
I really don't understand why they don't have the balls to just do a prehistoric prequel? haha. I can't be the only one that found the prehistoric segment completely captivating and the modern segment kind of boring?? I know Disney's Dinosaur (2000) was originally intended to be with no dialogue, like a national geographic vibe. Of course, the studio heads shut down that idea but i'm still waiting for a film like that to come out. Innovative and brave idea. Would've been really happy if this was just that.
Spettacolo... Soprattutto quando il t-rex attacca il cinema
“This does put a smile on my face”
Rexy is the reincarnation of that trex that died
I feel like there’s gonna be a rematch between rexy and giganotosaurus later in the film
Another loss for a trex guess they didn’t learn nothing from Jurassic park 3
Beautiful 😘
Huh so the original t rex was fuzzy but not the JP one. I guess JP dinosaurs being impure clones confirmed?
Good!!!!
Now I gotta pray TWICE to god so I don’t die before June next year.
Stunning Indeed.
This is so cringe
i love dinosaur... and jurassic movies
There it is... Life Finds a Way
Iguanadon : well f##k this: 2:47
first trex will lost to giagntisaurs and after that they merge the spino ,indo genome to the trex  and become powerful and fight with gigaantisaiurs i think the last battle...
Ya quiero que salga!
I really want to see what would the Spinosaurus is gonna look like!!
Less than 200 days left
At first, I see the 🦕, I think it is a tree's🌳 🪵
I wonder if blue still alvie
Story continuing 10 June 2022 in theatres this summer
Adipowlii
If you guys hear closely, the Giganotosaurus’s vocals has hints of Indominus Rex’s vocals. My theory is in Jurassic World, one of Indominus Rex’s genome belongs to the Giganotosaurus. That explains its size being bigger than the T-Rex. Also, if you guys recall, when Owen asked Claire what is the Indominus Rex made of in Jurassic World, she said base genome is T-Rex and the rest is classified. As Jurassic World Dominion is a round up of the trilogy, maybe that’s why they chose Giganotosaurus as the main antagonist. Thoughts?
Who else feels dead rn ? Me ofc h😎
Next Thrilogy : Jurassic Era
Can we PLEASE have a 1 on 1 fight with a rex where it doesn't lose in 30 seconds??
No Matter What I am Going to watch it in cinemas one in 4dx and one in imax for sure....
Is this the same prolouge that was attached to fast 9? I missed that it was only in Imax so I went so see fast 9 and only got.. Fast 9 😂
So that was Rexy's backstory and origin
2:11 I love the little detail of that nasutoceratops having a broken horn. It Gives the dinosaur more characterthan it would have otherwise.
Everyone even me: T REX IS THE KINGG!!! Everyone and me: watch t rex got beat by spino, i rex and giga Me: why? Why? WHY?!?!?!?
I hope there’s some scenes where it’s just the dinosaurs in modern day being (moderately) peaceful like the ones in prehistory.
210 days until... ⏳⏳
2022 is the return of dinosaurs
It's such a small gripe, but I'm glad they removed that cheek-wiggle effect they had in the previous movies whenever a dinosaur roared. I see what they were going for with that effect, and I'm sure there's some accuracy in the roars creating movement in that manner, but it always looked a little silly to me.
Least it looks like a real hollywood film again. should in interesting to see how it goes? will wait for first impressions from trusted sources.
Honestly, they should give rexy her own solo movie and show what her life was like in the Cretaceous era before she was killed by the giga and cloned. It will be just like ballad of big Al. Except it’s high budget Hollywood film. And they should have Nigel Marven as the narrator.
Iguanadon seems pretty chill considering it’s smack dab between two apex predators
Ok but how'd he miss that shot 4:52
04:59  "Flash Gordon" and "American Graffiti", and the cinema is called "Sky-line" (similar to "Skywalker"). Great tribute to George Lucas, who is friends with Spielberg (creator of Jurassic Park) and also the founder of ILM (the FX company which does the amazing CGI for this film).
What sauropod species? Argentinosaurus?
OVERRAPTOR
가즈아ㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏㅏ!!!!!
I love how there’s no music in the beginning so you can actually hear the the nature
I like how they brought back some of the stuff from the first Jurassic park when they were under the car screaming and when the T. rex flips the car and spins it.
Very Excited for 22 June
Anyone else disappointed when it changed back to modern times?..
So cool and epic.
3:07
This is ❤️❤️❤️❤️
God creates dinosaurs God destroys dinosaurs God creates men Men destroys god ..... Women inhabit the earth
OMAIGAT, ESTO VA SER EPICO PAPUS
This movie Better break and set records, literally been promoting for 2 years… from battle at the big rock to this. Let’s see.
A casa tiranosaurio pete imperialista, otro triunfo para el chad gigantosaurio
Cool
4:38 it’s nice to see Rexy hasn’t changed her habits of flipping over cars.
Time-travelling Giganotosaurus aside, this was very well done
Ok this is epic
Rexy vs gigan ini gigan wins
was that Owen in the helicopter?
:(
the dinosaur rex from the first part is cute but he died:(
This looks great 💙
Jurassic Park 2 vibes, I like it !!
Walking with dinosaur vibe
QUÉ EMOCIÓN
that guy has the aim of a stormtrooper.
It's so amazing to get a good look at Rexy's backstory after all these years!! I just know that she'll meet the Giganotasaurus again and they're going to have the most epic of rematches!! LOVE THAT DINOSAUR TO DEATH!!!
I just hope that Owen and Claire and their friends will save the dinosaurs 🦖🦕 and they will find someone and it's Alan Grant and his family, friends too
Exelent!!! I can not wait!!!
Literally the opening of Dinosaur lmao
I'm gonna be pissed if they kill Rexy off in this one. I know she's 20+ years old but come on.
Will the trailer drop in February
The cg defintrly improved, the thing that a Trex screams+people scream and people keep eating their popcorn/keep making out shows me allrrady that there will be issues at the writing apartment...  We'll see how it goes when it's out, positively intrigued for now, with a smidgen of caution.
i really hope there will be a directors cut for home release. no way can you do this movie justice with just a 2 - 2.5 hour movie. wish it was a 2 part finally film
The second part is not credible because Americans tend to shoot anything that moves, imagine if they reserve the kindness to use tranquilizers. Dinosaurs would end as fast as bison today.
These are beautiful
I CAN'T WAIT THAT F@&KING LONG!!!!!!!!!!
Own by universal
Is this a trailer of a new Jurassic World Movie or something???
Please give a t rex fight
That another prologue was good but I which there was hybrids dinosaurs was gonna be on it and it make me and other some people feel a bit sad😔😞 so much.
Will probably be fun but there is literally no tension in this scene whatsoever.  They'll NEVER top JP1.
The CGi is awesome 👌
Super excited when is does out, I’m admittedly going to buy tickets when it comes out
That is 6 movies now and the T-Rex is loose in another city and they're chasing after her unbelievable.
Of course Hollywood can't go 5 minutes without black male/White female interracial propaganda.
These movies just keep getting dumber and dumber under Colin Trevorrow's watch.
I’m So Hyped For Jurassic World: Dominion!!! 😀
This is beautiful
Since when Giganotosaurus, Dreadnougthus, Moros, Oviraptor, Iguanodon and Nasutoceratops coexist with Tyrannosaurus rex?
BINGO!!!!! DINO DNA!!!!!! I know all my fellow dino fans can't wait for this one.
It's going to be the DINOSAUR APOCALYPSE!! 🦖🦕
Where is the tension?  This is boring blockbuster fluff.
I cant believe a giganotosaurus defeated rexy on a fight eh still looks epic
Come on Rexy, give us a classic “just broke out of my cage” full throated ROAR
I've waited for a long time.
in the drive thru scene, alot of the shots were mostly throwback camera from the original JP.
What the hell is that weird theropod that beats the T. rex in the Cretaceous?
THE BEST MOVIE
That prologue was highly scientifically inaccurate. It showed a fight between a Giganotosaurus and a T. rex when In real life a fight between a Giganotosaurus and a T. rex couldn’t have ever taken place because the Giganotosaurus went extinct 30 million years before the T.rex evolved.
What!
At 3:18 people are asking how rex died but you can hear a crack in the rexs neck then because of rexs body weight it would have broken multiple bones around her body
Bummer
minecraft
Los dinosaurios de jurassic park de 1993 se veían mucho mejor, mas reales...
Question: What would Dinosaur Feather Cloths Feel like I hope it feels Soft and Comfy
Where’s the Dragon 🐉
what is the dinosaur that the t rex fights?
ABSOLUTAMENTE FANTÁSTICO! 🇧🇷
2:48, 3:08, 4:42, 5:15
This is fake??????
OK I caved. Had to watch it now that it was in 4k. Tears. SO excited.
i need this, now.
am i the only one who rewatched the "battle at the big rock" and feel that that one is more of a movie than this??
Looks so much better
Could that be the very same mosquito that Ingen used to make Rexy?
The dinosaurs in the first one Jurassic park looked better
I like how you came around teasing the movie with this clip now by yourself. Man i wanna see it.
We're way to excited! My daughter and  I have so many questions! Was there more than one indoraptor(one of the most beautiful dinosaurs they've created)? I remember it being a prototype,but the DNA was there.  Also, who is Mazzy a clone of?? I understand the ogs are back,to what degree? Will the dinosaurs live on? Or will they parish? Ugh! I cant wait!!! The kiddo and I are so ready for this to release,but are super thankful for this sneak peak!
And some of y’all thought the T. rex was the biggest and baddest. Ha.
I'm pretty indifferent to these newer Jurassic films (speaking as a hardcore JP fan) but I will say this teaser has me slightly intrigued. I did like the first few minutes showing the dinosaurs just living their lives, which reminds me how much I long for a Walking with Dinosaurs-esque mini-series with more up-to-date creature reconstructions.   I did like that they portrayed the Tyrannosaurus as simply walking in on the humans and almost shooing them away like roaches or something, as opposed to the whole event turning into a slaughter. Watching the animal stomp around, roaring, and snapping its jaws at people just feels more real and believable, like how an actual predatory animal may react when it senses annoying trespassers in its territory.  Pretty interesting first look at the film.
I’m so freakin excited
Pure goosebumps watching this
I heard Chris Pratt will be voicing Rexy!
Yes!! Thank You!! ❤️
This is great... But the flow of the dialogue leaves a lot to be desired. It's giving me Fallen Kingdom vibes, and that's far from a good thing when you consider that FK's writing is what destroyed that movie.
Let's go to the lobby! (Your turn!)
I don't think this is gonna be part of the movie.
death by dino is my goal
Are we sure that they will keep in it on the movie ?
Don’t think the giga would have actually won that fight irl, there bite is no where near as strong as a trexs and I don’t think that fall would have killed the trex at all
Huh, I never realized that the nasutoceratops right behind the baby had a broken horn. Neat little detail.
"Let's all go to the lobby, let's all go to the lobby, let's all go to the lobby, to get ourselves a lobby."
The BBC Walking with dinosaurs feel to the beginning of this brings me back to when I was younger watching them, such great film making back then and now with this, very excited for this film next year ❤️
Me dio un micro infarto al ver que mataban a otro tiranosaurio. 😢 pensé que era Rexy.
I'm tired of seeing the T.Rex lose, sincerely, but his appearance in the cinema is spectacular. I can't wait for next summer to arrive!!! 🐱‍🐉🐲
Gotta say but this might be one of the best movie yet of the whole franchise! 🦖🦕
A Rexy vai da um coro no Giga e vai mostrar quem realmente é a rainha dos dinos 💁🏻❤
como es que no se hizo viral esto
4:43 I would be the guy in the Ford Explorer on right
I am super excited desperate and happy
Iconic. Already.
HOLA CRISTO 😀😇👋
Yes yes yes !!!!!! This looks so much better than those other last two movies
RAWRSOME!!!!!!
The CGI is spectacular. Definite improvement over the previous JWs which I felt still looked nowhere near as lifelike as the original film.
I need !!!!😍
Wow
Awesome prologue and so but where is the trailer?
Who else just unlike the last video and liked this one because this one is in 4K now? 🤣
I love the dinosaurs yeah yeah MMMMM
3:36ここから全てが始まった
It’s coming in 2022 ?
Que pro en 4k 👉
The helicopter chasing rexy could be one from the us fish and wildlife service departament that apeared  in jwe2?? Yep It is if you stop in certain frames you can see its logo
This is great ♡ Now we gonna wait the trailer , i really wish that the spino appears
It's awesome 💥💥🔥🔥🔥
can't  wait for june🤩🤩
In my own head canon, I like to think that this takes place in Isla sorna in 2021
Gotta give props to those at ILM - this looks cinematically gorgeous and the cgi is phenomenal.
This is Gonna be Awesome!!!!
Among us
65 million years later, Rexy is looking for her murderer and asking the humans  “Where’s Giga”
i  cant wait. I wish we have a series like jurassic world which is never end. Like Camp cretaceous but not an ankmation 🥺
Just thought I'd let everyone know that this is not going to be in the final movie.  It sucks I know, but the director himself said it.  They're being very misleading marketing this as the "prologue."
Rexy is just upset that nobody invited her to the movies
wow
This is beautiful, this is epic and I just can't wait for June! 😍
It will be a dream come true if Trevorrow made a JW tv series, kinda like ‘Walking with Dinosaurs’ but in this design style, little to no soundtrack, & maybe even Sir David Attenborough as voice narrative like in his nature documentaries!  I would pay good money to see a modern dinosaur documentary like that! 🦖
Holyyy crap what an intro!! I love how they made their mezozoic dinosaurs at least slightly more realistic. 👍👍
Isso está difinitivamente incrível ❤️✨
No animatronics were harmed in the making
"We've entered a new era. Welcome............ to Jurassic World."
So when can we buy our tickets?
Trex got rekt in 4K
Giganotosaurus is so beautiful and very amazing !!!!
Just 18 seconds took to the Giganotosaurus to get the Overratedsaurus out of the way
✊I help expose our evil government (the Illuminati) i have 2,145,212+Total views💜[The about section will blow your mind]😞🐤🤎🥰
Can anyone let me know if the official universal pictures channel will release the prologue?
This is missing the scenes of the Gallmimus, Allosaurus and Mosasurus that were shown in the theater version!!!
So, who exactly are those guys? I'm suspecting it's not animal control, don't know why but I just feel that way and especially with companies like biosyn wanting a piece of the Dino business for themselves
As a child i have passion for dinosaurs and i see your films 30 times hahaha🦕🦕🦖🦕
FRICKING AMAZING, BUT IN 4K
20022
Roar I am a dinosaur
Amazing
O filme mais aguardado de 2022 🔥❤️
Por fin en 4k
Wait did you repost it!
I’m curious to know if the opening sequence to Disney’s “Dinosaur” or a paleontology documentary like “Walking with Dinosaurs” had _any_ influence on the ‘Cretaceous’ half of this sequence alone (🤔)?
T-Rex is cool
This is gonna look amazing in IMAX or in Dolby Cinema
My eyes thank
its such a cool detail that real dinosaurs actually look a bit different than their modified clones that we saw in the first movies
This looks even better!
Wow😍♥️♥️♥️
finally 4k
👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
This is beyond phenomenal!! Rexy walking through the drive-in theater is pure glory.
Awesome!
I SUPER Love It You Should Make A Brand New Video Of ( The Evolution Of Dinosaurs 1914-2022 ) It Will Be SUPER Awesome Fun

🦖🦕🦖🦕
💖💖💖💖 Esse prólogo deveria estar no filme!
2:12 look at the nasutoceratops horn
Awesome !!!!!!
If only we had more dinosaur shows and films like those few minutes in the Cretaceous *(barring the glaring inaccuracies, obviously).* Seriously, can we *PLEASE* just have a modern spiritual successor to Walking With Dinosaurs already?!
Jurassic world dominion will be amazing
