Darren is Brillant

I think it’s normal for them to pay rent but some people may not work and may not earn enough :((

Love McDonald’s 👍🤩
Me and my brother got on so well when he was at Uni. Now he’s back we’ve been clashing 🤣
wait so jed pays rent but doesn’t really have a job or stable income....? Doesn’t seem fair
Anyone else notice that saffron pronounces nuggets as nugguts haha :)
Love saffron so much
Are you happy with your boyfriend staying with you  Dad- which one 😂😂😂
when I went to McDonalds I ordered the Katsu chicken nuggetsbut they gave me normal chicken nuggets!!!! I was gutted!!!!
Also I paired rent when I lived with my parents and I love that because it prepares me for when I moved out onto my own xx
My parents had a house fire 4 weeks after I moved out and so they moved in with me they finally got their own space and i love them a lot but I’m so great full for my space back xx
I love saffron’s videos ❤️
Jed is such a mood
Astons a good name, my son is called aston
I paid money to my mum. Its not rent but your just helping towards the bills when your adults. Its only respectable
The fact I’m called Lacey, I feel honoured:)
I actually love Darren he doesn’t get enough appreciation😂 ! Hilarious and such a loving dad🥺🥰you can just tell, what a man
i thought saff’s dad was vegan 😂
sorry but darren hits different
Hi so you do a deaf awareness video but don’t actually provide subtitles for the video?
That’s so weird you and Jeds relationship is like mine and my little bro’s me and him were also inseparable but now we bicker a lot 😂
Saffron: we do actually get on tho  Her dad : I know but better better  Ok only me who found that funny
Sad the barkers are moving out of the family home feels like the end of an era!! x
Yes I love ur family q/a everyone is amazing 🤩
Your videos are so entertaining they always get me in a great move and your such an authentic person especially for people your age (I am 20 as well) as the balance between being mindful about your health and body and the things like shows on Netflix is just perfect 😂❤️
I love this do more Q and A
Your actually the funniest family ever 😭😭😂😂
i love how they couldn’t call him aston bc of aston villa😂
She was gorgeous now she’s pterodactyl😂😂😂
My name is Aston named after ASTONVILLA x
First I watched Annastia's family's mukbang and didn't even crack a smile and then came to watch this video and wow, it was hilarious. Wendy is too funny and so is her dad. I can't believe I used to think Annastia's family videos were more funnier than Saffron's before.
I love your dad so much😭😭

You should do swapping jobs for a day

Believe Jesus died for your sins was buried and rose again on the third day for your justification and you'll have eternal life in paradise acts 16:31 1cor 15;1-4
It is your dads laugh for me 😂😂😂😂
9:55 Jed's "ARE U ON DRUGS"  HAHAHA I SPIT OUT MY FOOD FROM LAUGHING
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
i’m glad this has happened to you.
Is the title's inspiration from Nik's videos?
"Jed is such a dopey name" 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Kind of a clickbait title
Why are your family moving house again? No hate just wondering xxx

I was thrilled to find out you were named after Saffron on Ab Fab!  I have always oved that show!!!!!

Tell your dad he's not 21
anyone wondering where Tyler is? I thought he was living with saffron’s family for a while🧐
Saffron- would you miss me? Jed- No Wendy- yes you would  3 seconds later   Wendy- Saff would you miss Jed Saf- yeaaaaa no
Jed was just there for the food
well they aren’t are they babe
This frustrates me too when people say ‘your parents are horrible if they make you pay rent’ I just see it as normal once I’m moved out I’m going to have to pay rent/ or a mortgage and it will be a lotttt more than what I’m paying now so why not get used to the responsibility 🤷🏻‍♀️🤯
Great video
I don’t think it’s normal to pay parents rent. It’s not something that is common at least here in Canada
Ur dad is jokes 🤣😩
i don’t know anyone called casey, no boy in america💀💀💀💀ur dad is to much
it takes a lot to make me laugh but when the phone bill convo came up😭😭💀”i was sixteen!!” ah i cantt

Family goals🥰 And Darren is such a cool dad, literally fits of laughter whenever he’s on the channel😂😂
Jed “when the hell am I annoying I just sit in my room all day”

hey Saffron, i'm really happy for you that you get to move out and have your own space :-) a big congrats to you :-)  ( ---- Big Hugs ---- )
OMG darren is so funny
Is it just me or do Saffron and Anastasia Kingsnorth post literally almost the same content regularly? I know they are like best friends but there are major similarities in a lot of their content in the last few months. No shade I like them both...just a thought
“if its not about the money can we lower it then?” 😂😂😂
Funniest video ever! Love you all 🤣💕
This is chaotic and hilarious all at the same time i kept putting it back to hear what everyone said while laughing so much

So many of my friends parents charge them “rent” but when they need money there parents give it to them as like savings if that makes sense c

Saffron: I always call my boyfriend ‘little one’ Wendy: we don’t wanna know why Me: *ehh 3secs later AHAHAH*

Not the strictly ringtone 😂
Saffron we need to swap dads 😂😂. I want to try and live with Darren for a day
💕👍💕👍💞❤👌🤝💕
Nobody....  Wendy- “I look like a turtle”
Dazza is actually so funny
4:34 😭😭
darren and wendy are one of the funniest parents everrrr!! who else agrees?
love these videos with your fam so much!! xx
In our household we only pay rent if we have a full time job, we also typically 18 yr old and we pay bills like our own phone
PLLLSS MAKE MORE FAMILY VIDEOS THEY ARE MY ABSOLUTE FAV TO WATCH
I literally love saffron and her family so much I’m gonna miss seeing them when she moves out.
Was daz eating a fillet of fish? Isnt he vegan anymore?

DARREN IS THE FUNNIEST PERSON ALIVE😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
I never paid my parents rent. I lived with my my parents till 23. xx
“ shall we do a thumbnail”😂😭😂
only true fans were here when it was called a bukbang  ilysm <3
Saffron u didnt get kicked out of strictly u got eliminated u even put kicked out in the vlog where u showed u got eliminated
Little one 😂😂😂 Jeff would not like it if I called him that haha
PLS DO ANOTHER Q AND A!!! Honestly couldn't stop laughing 🤣
Saffron: Jed will you miss saffron? Jed:No😂 litterly no hesitation 😂😭😂
I’m 20 but don’t pay rent. Haha. But I don’t earn so.
Hi guys God loves you Jesus is coming back soon I want you guys to be ready go talk to God he is going to change your life for the better you’re so loved and appreciated God bless you🤍🤍✝️🙏🏾
For some reason saffron’s dads laugh is that annoying and funny I actually like it LMAO🤣💕
Loved that this video felt like I was sitting right near you all having a funny conversation. Love all the family videos you’re all so funny 😂
I thought it was normal to pay rent 😂 I’m 17 and I pay rent every month, I’ve been paying it since I was 16. Mum says it will help me for when I’m older and I need to save money/rent. She puts the money that I pay “rent” with into my savings so that I can pay for a house or uni when I’m older
Where’s your necklace from ? X
This is class
Why does she copy so many of anas videos
Does saffron employ her Mum? Xx
‘We don’t wanna know why’ Saffron’s mum is the best 😂
Do a swap jobs with your dad video omg that would be great 😂
Your dads the best 🤣🤣
OMG U HAVE A TESLA???
I love this😂😂videos with your fam are my fave😂💗
Not a fan of this clickbait title, got so worried and felt bad for you cause I thought your parents were splitting up
I thought your dad was a vegan? Xx
Tbh I can understand the rent thing. If you're legally an adult and have a full time job that pays well, but you're still living at home, then you should pay something towards the rent/bills etc. You can't live off your family forever.
im only here for saffrons dad... give him a Channel
you need to do a part 2
glad you have tried the katsu nuggets they are absolutley amazing
omg i love this video it’s so funny 😂
Little one 🤣🤣
Jed was the name of my dog
Okaaay people paying rent is completely normal you know. 💕
Part 2....
Darren is a mood and Jed too
Your videos are so entertaining - love you 💖
I really enjoyed this one because of the family together, your dad he funny 😆 ❤️🥰 bless you all xxx
Wendy: God I look like a turtle !!!!   LMAOOOOOOOO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Saf: Will you miss me ? Jed: No Wendy: will you miss Jed? Saf: Nah   🤣🤣🤣 I’m dying   This is why I love this family 🤣🤣🤣
Ur mum looks so young 😍
Love u all
Your Dad is cuckoo 😆
This was fucking hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 I literally couldn't stop laughing 😭🤣
Your parents are freaking hilarious.. such great humor
This is the best video ever 😂💞
Your dad is class
What's your car?
Saffron should switch lives with Darren for the day hahahah
You guys make me laugh so hard love everything about you and especially love Wendy
Why where you kicked out of strictly ?
Saffron “I call my boyfriend little one “  Wendy “we don’t want to know why”  Me bursting into laughter.
My first job I had to pay half of my wages for rent. It's a good thing to pay rent as it's part of growing up and learning. This vlog was an odd one lol.
What is ur dads star sign
Why does Jed sound like Arthur Christmas ?
I actually love Darren😂😂😂 he is too funny!
Omg same Wendy, I'm terrible at living with people who I don't get on with!! Also, I pay board/rent too. Have since being 17 - $100NZD a week (£50), so much cheaper to live at home, but definitely need my independence!!!
Darren is just a different breed 😭😭
I can’t cope with Darens ringtone situation 😂 I’m actually crying
I live with my mum and me and my big sis pays rent it’s just life and it helps our mum out a lot with paying the gas and electric bill and it helps out with food shopping I like paying rent for those reasons love u Saffron and love your family 💜
Darren’s so bloody funny..... he’s literally the best!
I love these videos so much❤️can u please do more
She had a lip job, look at her old videos from 3 years ago none existing lips to now
We wanna be TOGEVERRRRRRR FOREVVVVVVER - Daren  Wendy - we will always be together, like a little lost puppy dog without her  Saff- will you miss me?  Jed - No.
omfggg darren cracks me up hahahahahahah raaaawwwwrrrrrrrr
I love saffron but I swear she only does the videos that Anna upload!
I love saffron but when she said she was so pale when she's literally orange/tanned,  i got so confused 😂
id probs reword the title ...
Love watching your videos, always make me laugh. Best yt family ever xxx
I have paid rent since I got a job at 16... is this not normal? Lol 😂
Oh Darren just makes the Q & A more entertaining 😂🤣🤪❤❤❤💕
I would love to see "swapping jobs"-video with your dad 😍
Darren actually makes me laugh so much 😂😂
I love how down to earth Jed is like he just says it how it is and doesn’t give a shit😄🤣🤣
FUN!!!!
Ur family is hilarious😂😂🤍🤍✨✨✨
Do another q&a
I seriously wish your parents had an Youtube channel.  They're hilarious!
Such click bait. There are real families who have split up families and yet here you are being insensitive and exaggerating you leaving and refuse to excerpt your bf uses you for clout
PART 2 PLEASE
Hi 🙋‍♀️ Saffron Wendy Darren Jed Bella the dog 🐶 Casey Nicole and Harlow and baby 👶 Lake and everybody else in the world 🌍 of Saffron too awesome McDonald’s accommodation question 🙋‍♀️ 2 saffron is moving out she’ll meet her family are you going to miss saffron nope 👎 she’s not disappearing off the world 🌎 saffron will not miss Jed Jed won’t move in with saffron never 👎 in a million years both kids 👶 pay 💰 rent
Kind of early lol 😂
Next video idea : *Swab jobs with The Barker’s*
Jed "G-E-O gorgeous" 🤣
the mcdonalds mukbang you did with your family like a year ago used to be my comfort video ahahah
My names autumn
The father’s gene is definitely stronger
Yes Jed be saying can I sleep over.  Once everyone is moved out.  Yes also paying rent just shows good money management.
Darren makes me laugh omg😂😭😭😂😂
Loved the video please do more. X
Your dad is so funny 😂😂😂😂
your dad is the funniest person on the planet
Agreed paying rent to parents is normal my mum would have asked me for rent if she was still alive :)
Yes we want another car video with the family after you move
But who was here when it said Bukbang? 😂😂😂😂😂
Darren at 8:27 is me when I realise I have no more homework 📚
what job does jed actually do?
wait.. is darren no longer vegan? swear he was eating a fillet o fish haha
I love how jed is just eating & not that involved in the conversation What a mood
Darren is just the best 😍
Wendy is my ideal mother/bestie ... and she's beyond 😍 gorgeous. I can't even imagine how anyone doesn't love Dazza. He is such a crack up & just has the most easy-going fun personality. The Barkers are just my FAVORITE ppl!!! And OF COURSE Saffron you are my girl ... love you to pieces🥰
the fact that your dad had a ring tone for your mom singing gorgeous- is literally relationship goals!
I get told dont pay rent and save it to a house so thats what I do
Saffff! Your so amazing! I love your family also xox
9:04 classic Darren laugh followed by “You know what...I am SICK” 😂😂😂
This video literally made my day
I look like a turtle 🐢😂😂
Not aloud to eat in your car now you get fined if you get caught x
“I look like a turtle” ~Wendy barker 2k21 😂😂🤣
Ridiculous paying rent when you’re living under the roof of your parents who brought you here. They should be letting you save for your future
Is your dad eating a burger? Veggie burger? 🤷‍♀️
Omg this made me laugh 😂 I don't even normally like q&as but your family is just the best xx
Thanks a lot I’m now ✨on my way✨ to McDonald’s ✌️
Jeds face when Dazza b was pretending to be a dinosaur omg hahah
You guys are hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
I love your family :) your mum and dads laugh is so funny
Where’s your tip from?
Love these vids
they were all talking about the rent thing really quite harshly. not everyone can afford to pay rent at your age, i’m earning minimum wage and there’s no way i could pay rent. it made me feel quite stupid
I wrote drivers license from the blonde girls pov, it would mean so much if anyone would check it out in my channel, it’s just a minute long cx
I need to hear Dazs say Autumn
Jed in this video is such a mood🤣🤣🤣
could we just talk about how jed would suit aston better
I love watching you guys together. Great family xxx
Crying anna
PLEASE swap life with your dad for the day!!  Love dazza b on my screen he makes me laugh so much 😂😂😂😂
your dads so funny ahah
Hahahaha you lot are so funny!😂😂😂 love you ❤️❤️❤️
I love these videos with saffron’s fam       Ps I’m a small YouTuber
Can someone pls help me! I swear I watched a vid years ago where saffron said her parents adopted kids when she was younger and Jed is adopted ..? Have I dreamt this lol
Would love another Barker Q&A but then, who wouldn’t!  Darren is just hilarious 😂😂
Jed is so underrated he’s my favourite 😂😂😂
I just wanna be friends with Dazza
“We don’t wanna know why” I died 😂
The thumbnail  the dad, Jed and saffron: 😔 the mom: 😃
Omggg this was to funny 😂😂
Awww nooo
5:15 Will from inbetweeners “16!”
Adorable family!
Saffron and Anna’s videos are so similar constantly
WTF was this even about
I love this family 😂❤️
Jed is a dopey name
Where they in a tesla
✨I Look like a turtle 🐢✨
I pay 3/4 of my wage to rent
i love the fact that you’re all in a video together xx
Isn’t the caption supposed to be “my family is splitting up”?
Can you do a pt.2?
Awesome video Saffron xx
That’s so weird you and Jeds relationship is like mine and my little bro’s me and him were also inseparable but now we bicker a lot 😂
This video made my day, I love you guys 😂😂💖
Saffrons dad is hilarious..more videos with darren in please 😊
Omg I love this!!!😭😂❤️
Love😘😘
LONGER VIDEOS 😍😍
I just watched Anastasias video and saffron’s one today
love your dad that was so funny
I watched the first mukbang yesterdayyyyy. This is perfect 😍
Isn’t it weird how as soon as Ana posts a video... Saffron posts the exact same video...
Why are you uploading the exact same videos as Anastasia??
It's called "mukbang" not 'bukbang' SO PLEASE CHANGE IT
Jed's name hahahaha
The way you both are RUDE to Darren makes me sick.  Disgusting.  It’s not funny
I am dead when Wendy goes “we don’t want to know why”🤣🤣 this family’s relationship is so funny🤍
Difference with not paying your parents rent is that you can always be sure you have a home to go back to. I’d never ever think about charging my future kids rent.
We do the same in our household. When we get a job we pay a certain amount of our wages as “housekeeping” which includes rent and food so to me it’s pretty normal
Lysm
Saffron : are you gonna miss me  Jed : no  The crowd: that violation
Hi l hope you and your family are ok, l love it every time you upload,  love you so so much 💖💖💖💖
When you got your mom more cute than you. That feeling 😇
Saffron, where’s your necklace/chain from?? It’s so gorgeous!
I look like a turtle hahahaha I cant stop laughing 😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
When i pass my driving test, McDonald's drive thru is the first place I'm going 😆😆🍔🍟
Really don’t get the whole rent thing- like they always say your always welcome here you can always come home ext but what if they don’t have any money and homeless- like u gunna make them pay rent- in most cases no- so why you making them pay rent now like they your family- if someone comes and stays you gunna ask they to pay for the night- like so stupid lol
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
bukbang?😂
Where's Tyler? 👁👀
What does Jed work as if he pays rent ?
I hope you and your family are staying safe saffron, Thankyou for continuing to blog for us!❤️❤️xx
'should we do a thumbnail' hahahaha dying at your dad
Why are they all just shouting at the camera 🤯
love your family (⊙o⊙)your dad is so funny(⊙o⊙)
Her dad is so literally so hilourious when she moves out gonna miss her dad in her vids xx

I live u I have whatched u since 2016 ❤️
Love a mukbang! This was so funny 😂😂😂 xxx
Love your family .but can I just say there's nothing wrong with living in rented accommodation.  Not everyone can afford to buy
“Shall we do a thumbnail” 🤣
Do you wanna copy Anastasia any more
So sad.. but soooooo excited, can’t wait for the new chapter✌🏼 To anyone else reading this, happy hump day😇 Half way through the week, and if you’re anything like me it’s WINE WEDNESDAY😂 I hope everyone is well, stay safe and remember to keep smiling! Lots of love, a small time YouTuber trying to spread positivity❤️❤️
no hate, love her but feel like she needs to make some of her own content xx
Yes please do another q and a
there has literally never been a boring barker family video😭😭
This was so funny 😭😭😭
I still don't understand why she's moving out like her family is amazing and she's only 20? I'm happy for her but won't she be alone in her house a lot of the time?
Jed ‘if it’s not about the money can we lower it a bit please’ 😭😭😭😭😭
Omg I have just got off a call and I can already tell that this vid will make my day :)
To the person reading this: you’re gorgeous and don’t let anyone bring you down 👑😌❤️
To the person reading this: you’re gorgeous and don’t let anyone bring you down 👑😌❤️
Cant have aston because of Aston villa. What is wrong with that
saff " I call my boyfriend little one" Wendy: " we don't want to know why"  8:11 LMAOOOO I CAN'T WITH YOU GUYS
Loveee this 💗💗
oh i love these family videos they’re hilarious 😂
we will all miss the iconic family 😌
I'm 19 and my parents pay for everything but its cos i'm at uni therefore still in education so I'm not acc earning anything. Kinda surprised Jed pays rent but like what is he acc doing with his life now?
Ur dad is just the weirdest person ever 😂
Perfect! Needed something calming and fun to watch
Actually the cutest 💕
When I'm older I get to keep my first wage and then I have to pay 25% of my wage for rent
I pay rent! I think it’s normal
I thought Darren is vegan but he's eating a fish o fillet lol
Awww my nephew is call Aston and he is because my brother supports Aston villa haha x
