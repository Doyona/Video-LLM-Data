Colleen, it’s kind of hurtful towards people who can’t support the LGBTQ+ community because of their religion you think are clowns clowns😢
9:48 that is litteraly my friend
Flynn putting the magnifying glass up to his face is so cute!
It's funny because I had to have a c section and the thought of having to push a baby out now terrifies me.
Steak?
Love the throwback photo with Ariana, also love the cutest little man in the world Flynn 🥺❤️
he is so cute omg
You said triplets instead of twins
Like Aleaha & Kirra
Ahhh im so happy for collen she is gonna has cute twins just like flynn omg COLLENS NEVER FAINT
Flynn: *breathes* Me: OH MY GOSH THATS SO CUTE SIFJCJIDJDHFJSJSJDJJSJS
I’m so happy that big companies are acknowledging the community, but it’s hard to tell if it’s real support. I find it very likely that companies make this stuff just for profit :/ (especially if they don’t donate any proceeds)
U guys r the cutest family
Hey francesca is a wonderful name 😏 I would know
AAAAH YOH REMAINED ME OF PHEOBE FROM FRIENDS
Everyone needs water,but as a diabetic I can tell you that I use water to lower my sugar levels,so you may be getting sugar lows.
Just an idea london and paris they work for both genders lol 🥰
🥰
Weird, jolly ranchers make me gag
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Francesca and Tweed for the win guys 😂
People who have never been pregnant 🤰 need to lay off of Miranda. She is doing an awesome job with her son and her pregnancy 🤰.
Flynn singing Im a Little Teapot is the cutest thing ever
Yes she need to feed her and the baby's
I survived on Wendy’s junior bacon cheeseburgers, and chocolate frostys
Make sure you check your HbA1c with the doctors. Just to make sure.
I have a question what in the world is C-section
here are two girl names Astrid and Lola
me and my twin are Zoe and Kiah. (kiah rhymes with fire haha just how to pronounce it)
Or like Bryan and blake
Like Lisa and leyna
I thought is twins
Yeah it’s life
Petco also has pride merchandise for our customers and their pets too... we also have Petco shirts that we can wear as uniforms too!!
Colleen you are the best mother ever you’re so cute when you’re playing with Flynn
Flynn is so cute!
Our parent named our brother and I names that they though sounded good together but didn’t rhyme also. Our names are Miranda and Trevor. (Yes I know… Miranda)   other name choices that they had was Bailey and Trey (other gb) Bailey and Miranda (gg) Trevor and Trey (bb)
Girl I’m not even pregnant and I’m super hungry to the point where I will be nauseous if I go too long without food. Eat when you need to 💕
I vlogging I’m boring I’m Colleen
I’m so glad you are not going to rhyme or have their names be similar. I’m an identical twin and thank God my mom didn’t do that to us. We’ve always been called the twins and fought for our identities our entire life.
But I thought she was have twins not triplets
Jaya and Morgan if girls maybe
It doesn’t sound that good when they rhyme or match but I kind of like them when they go together like I have friends named Evelyn Ila and they’re twins and it just fits them so well they don’t exactly rhyme but they do sound good together
I've had two sets of twins 1 set natural with one baby breach the other a c- section.you will be ok.congrats on twins.
Flynn is soooooooo cuteeeee <<<333333
Does anyone else call "puppy chow" Chex Mix? Aha
Flynns voice reminds me of dunkin
I.. I just said it😧😐
Are u going to make any new episodes of the Haters Back off
I am ofended of my cousin s not not knowing of how you are like you are big becuse mirinda like what
Yeah....that is what terrifies me. I just had a miscarriage so didn;t have to face it...but when I get pregnant again, I am getting ready to refuse being weighed...I have a history of eating disorder....so I can't have people telling me my weight gain is inappropriate.  So you are right Colleen, everyone has a different pregnancy and it's okay to gain weight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0:44 I'M the SAME, but I'm not pregnant I just take hormones for a medical reason
I laughed out loud when Flynn said " oops, I spilled some". Too cute.😂
If girls lexie or lacy if boy Leighton or Ellis😇
TRIPLETS?!?
As a twin your pregnancy sounds very similar to my moms so i think there is no too much to worry about but every pregnancy is different but you’re doing wonderful. Those babies couldn’t have a better mom.
4:37 😍😭😍
Just want to put out an idea, eat calorie dense stuff, things full of nutrition and calorie and something that you don’t have to eat a lot to get a lot from!! :) saves you from feeling over full from “stuffing your face” haha and then babies get to absorb more so they don’t make you feel hungry! Also make sure you get checked for gestational diabetes :) which I’m sure you know just figured that’s something to point out if you haven’t already haha
im a triplet and I swear its not fun
One of them is a boy an’ the other’s a girl.
i can’t with the photo of miranda eating cheese puffs
Flynn is precious. What a smart boy!
The shaking and constant hunger could be because it’s twins
I can’t get over that intro it’s adorable
What about Emma and ava?  I think they go together very well.  But Flynn is going to be such a good brother!
did i just notice this but flynn was cleaning 🥺 he’s a great boy
Flynn’s singing was the WORLD to me omg
My cousin ha the pregnancy pillow because she is pregnant! 😁
I’m the opposite I’m normally hungry but not today I’m sick and Ben in my bed and on my phone all day.
Hey Colleen, I just had a twins boy/girl and it is so fun, it's hard too cause I am a single mother and working full time! But I wanted to tell you if you have any questions I would love to tell you some tips and tricks for pregnancy with twins  and for when they are born!😁
omg ariana at 2:00
I got like that when I was pregnant with my daughter. Perhaps try eating things with more protein and nutrition as your body may be craving them because of all the babies in their that your providing for 😂 I wish I'd done that when I was pregnant  but I just craved strawberry milkshakes and burgers 🤣
My friends are twins and they are girls there names are Kateleyn and Laney
Only 75 pounds is not that bad, my cousin just had a baby and she gained 92 pounds
Francesca and Tweed 💀😂
You need to eat more protein. That's why you get shaky so drink a glass of milk eat meat and egg lentils those kinds of things. Carbs are great but protein is what you body needs to build baby's. I really hope this helps! I'm so excited for you!
Twins congrats
All the people who were zooming in and spending countless minutes , even an hour or so investigating the triplet theory with the ultrasound , and whole time they were looking at your shit , zooming in on your shit . You win Queen 😂😂😂
Yeah I saw that and I was like-  “uh you’re sure it’s twins?” but yk doctors says :)
Mabey iff ther a girl lime milisa or malinda or if boy Calvin or noah
What about Cody and coby for boys?
The intro is soooooo cute
It's called hyperglycemia. The babies are taking all your energy to grow, and if you don't eat you WILL pass out from low blood sugar. SO don't worry about eating some sugary crap cause you need it to keep your glucose levels up.
My oppinion is that its your first time with twins your just geting used to it maybe
The watermelon suggestion made me smile. Not just when you're pregnant but if you ever get really really sick it can also be a complete lifesaver. It allowed me to survive h1n1 many moons ago.
#BornInPrideMonth #Pride #Yay!
I know triplets named Brody Connor and Ellie short for Elizabeth. They go together great. Also knew twins named Sinead and Finn short for Griffin. They go together good too. Anyways i know what you mean by that. Congratulations 🎉🎈🎊!!!!!
Eat more meat it will help! And definitely call your OB doctor ASAP
"uh oh I spilled it"
omg flynnnnn is sooooo cute omg also your the best mom i love yall
"franchesca and tweed" I-
I want “ice cream… i just said it” on a tshirt 😂😂
I loved watermelon when I was pregnant with my daughter. It was the best ❤️ my craving was orange juice 😅 I bought 10  jugs of orange juice 🤣 it would be gone in like a week 🤣.
OH MY GOOOODDDDDDDDDD
I love that Colleen is so supportive of the LGBTQ+ community and trying to say that stores making pride clothes is a good growth but the main reason people are hating on the pride clothes is because stores are using pride as a 'trend' to try sell more and gain profit. Most stores who realise rainbow clothes only around pride month never spread awareness or donate anything to fundraisers to help support the community. They aren't using rainbow clothes to help the LGBTQ+ community they are using at for their own gain. But there are some good stores like I know IKEA is a really good store because they've donated TONS of money to the Trevor project and other charities directed towards the LGBTQ+ community. So stores like that are perfectly fine because they aren't only talking about the community during pride month and using it as a 'trend' to get more money. They support the community any time of the year and don't do it for recognition. Anyways I'm so happy the Colleen is so supportive of our community and is more than happy to talk about it comfortably anytime! ♥️
Flynn singing is the cutest! Nothing quite like hearing a toddler sing ☺️
You know your body and it is your body, so do what makes you feel happy!
Everyone’s body is different with pregnancy! I weighed 150, lost 35lbs when I got pregnant, then gained 20 the last few months of my pregnancy, and gave birth 15lbs under my pre pregnancy weight!   Perfectly healthy baby, no issues, 7lbs 11oz, etc. so “you should only gain this much” or “have to gain at least this much” is all BS!
eggs
"Like Francheska and Tweed" why did I love that 😂
Literally never have puppy chow except for at Christmas
My mom had me my brother and sister dut she also had triplets so yea she had 6 kids
What’s next quadLets
rainbow capitalism isn't cute. These giant companies are profiting off of the LGBTQ community without actually investing in the community. It's all just performative.
Try the peach Jolly ranchers for nausea😊
omg im so confused your have triplets?!?
Yall are preshering this women
Do you have twins or triplets?
Hi colleen I am twin and my name is Ashley and my twins name is Angela and we are identical twins and Angela is older than me by 2 minutes and she was pushed out but I my mom had to get a C-section cause I was stuck up in my moms ribs but at the end everything was ok (ps: Angela pushed me up 😊)
Oh, my planned C-section was a dream. My first was a long labor that ended in an emergency C-section and that was awful!!! If you THINK you may need one, just schedule it. You don’t wanna labor for hours and then get a C-section. Like I mentioned in the beginning of my comment, my planned C-section was a dream. Worst part was getting the needle in my hand and then in my spine. I slept threw most of the surgery and was out doing yard work by the end of the week. Emergency c-section I couldn’t stand up straight for a couple of months.
9:10  I'm dying  broo
I saw the expression before I saw the title so my heart skipped a beat
U go girl! Eat what you want
Ty for supporting a month that me and other people can express ourselves being proud for who we are! SpongeBob and I are quite similar in a lot of things! One being that we are both asexual!!! This is why I love cartoons🥰💕💕💕💕
When you start at a lower pre pregnancy weight you should absolutely gain more than 25 pounds. Don't let people shame you for listening to your body
My Twins are Kiley and Emily
I’m a twin My names Charlize and my twin sisters is Havana :)) nowhere near similar!
I'm a type one diabetic and get really shaky when my blood sugar is low. Gestational diabetes is super common no matter your health prior to pregnancy. Low blood sugar can be super dangerous. Even if it is nothing, it may be worth checking out just to be safe. Love you!
.................... Eating for 4?
I gained 30 with my first and 60 with my second and I shook like that too. But, they were only 6oz difference at birth.
Like Mary Kate & Ashley 😏
Ron & Jon, Francesca & Tweed. Iconic Hahaa
Flynn: 👀MILK.  🤣 *obviously*
The 30 was my birthday
when flynn says he spilled the cup HAHA so freaking cute
That food rule is so bs. Our bodies even crave extra food on our period because it takes so much energy to have a period—having  2 babies is even more exhausting.
The flaky cuticle byerly expand because authorization concomitantly bump beside a plastic circulation. jobless, well-groomed customer
It's weird because you know colleen exists but.. she doesn't know we do... weird
“Ice cream ...*whisers*I just said it”Flynn is so funny and sweet
I am dying at the tea party. "I just said it. " 😒🤣🤣🤣
Omg talk about something other about being pregnant
You ARE eating for multiple. Your body burns more calories while pregnant than not so you require more food! Keep eating!
Why is Flynn a better singer than me?
Next will be rumors about quadruplets
Hay is it just me or are you also kind of worried for you colleen she has not posted a video in about a week
My thing is companies should be making pride clothes all year long and promoting them like they do with the rest of their clothes all year long
Today's my brothers birthday! (14!)
When Flynn was pretending to pour the tea and he said “Uh oh I just spilled it” was sooo cute 🥺😂🥺
if they are both girls you should do bailey and saylor i love those names
between hila and ethan and you guys i can’t keep up LMFAO
#FrancescaAndTweed
My mom had 5 kids. First at 22 (Twins, no C section), second at 25, third at 28, and fourth at 31. The twins names are Wendi and Hailie and they just graduated. They go together but dont match.
WAIT IF ITS A BOY AND GIRL DO PATRICK AND MIRANDA!
omg flynn🥺🥺 hes such a cutie!!!
If you’re shaky talk to your Doctor - I think you need to check your glucose levels. From what you said, you’re eating a lot of sweets so be careful.
Hey Colleen thank you for clarifying that there is only two babies which people thought there might be three. But you are eating for three so can’t wait to find out what’s next.
I do agree about the clothes for pride but I think it’s more the fact that a lot of companies are just trying to monetize pride and I saw another YouTuber say the least they could do was invite in young LGBTQ designers and have them make the clothes, I also think they should donate some of the profits
Flynn singing I’m a little tea pot tho 🥺
I have 3 kids and my last was breach so I had to have a c-section. It was terrifying. Everything went fine but just the idea of being cut open awake was too much. It was positive though because I have a wonderful miracle baby (now 6) and I was able to get my tubes tied. 😜
no one: Flynn: pshhhh pshhhh
I just said it... 😂
Can I just say, from the moment you announced the pregnancy, I knew you were pregnant with twins or triplets!! ;)
Colleen: *eats bagel and pop tart Also Colleen: idk why I'm always hungry 😂 I cant with you id be hungry too!!
cherry is my favorite flavor omg 🥲🥲
Congratulations
I'm hungry all day and I'm 25 week 2 days it is common my second pregnancy I was always hungry but not when not pregnant.  I get right sided cramps which sucks
1:42 thank you for this edit - it’s now logged in memory anytime my carrots go bad😂
Try protein in the morning
I haven't wached a video of u for a long time and i expected to start with "u ask her a question and she replies,  her awnsers are lame but at least she tries, collleeeeeens corner"
I have a really  harsh feeling  its a boy and a girl but idk
Ya the names make sense like one of my best friends is Katharine and Andrew that’s makes sense :)
That song at the beginning tho:
Because I’m plus sized the doctor I was going to before my 9 weeks mark told me I should not gain more than 15 pounds my entire pregnancy and would start saying that I had hypertension and all these things that I don’t even think was a concern yet? And now I am almost 21 weeks and I had actually lost 7 pounds and have only gained back 3 of those pounds since, my NEW doctor doesn’t seem concerned at all about my weight, my blood pressure stays normal and so far my blood sugar has too so 🙌🏻🤞🏼 and also I ate like nonstop so idk how I haven’t gained so much weight yet
Hmm... Maybe you need more nutrient dense meals. Poptarts and bagels aren't gonna keep you full for too long. I atleast have to eat a variety of  foods more often to hold myself over and so I don't get light headed and headaches. You'll find your balance ⚖️
I am a twin girl and boy I have a girl name lubna and a boy name luai I guess they're not the best but you know we don't rhyme but we start with same letter 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️idk but I do know that I love you and all your friends ❤️❤️
I’ve got cousins on both sides that are twins ,boys and girls. The girls are Megan and Ally and the boys are Zack and Carter . I think those go well together
The eating thing with twins is completely normal 🤷‍♀️I ate ALL THE TIME, and after I gave birth, I was 40lb below pre pregnancy weight
𝙏𝙍𝙄𝙋𝙇𝙀𝙏𝙎
If you have twin girls, the names Eden and Arella would be so cute! Eden means    Delight and Arella means Messenger angel.
Hey Colleen I saw some comments about how your shakiness could be related to diabetes or low or high blood pressure. It would be best to check it out just in case! ❤️
💜💜💜💜💜💜
Flynn is the cutest little bundle of joy! I can’t wait for him to meet his siblings, I have a feeling he’s going to adore them! 🥰
I have twin girls, Stella and Luna ❤️ I think it goes good.
Girl them eyebrows be bussin
I can understand what you mean with the pride selection in stores, and to an extent I really agree; it’s awesome to see places at least try to show support and variety in their merchandise they sell. However, I think by the posts I’ve seen/read through, I think people want more specific aesthetic-aligned clothes to show pride, and for it to be less of a capitalized thing, since most of the selections are only open for the month (aside from places like Hot Topic, Spencer’s, etc.); . Personally I’d love to see more people buying from and shouting out more small businesses that have pride merchandise (and that are LGBTQ+ based preferably). This is just my perspective, however. Sending love ❤️
A bagel, poptarts, and grapes? Please see a dietician for all 3 of your health. All love 💕
Dose this mean I’m pregnant because I’m alaways hungry lol I’m under 18
I’d they are girls then you can name then Emma and Maddie
Have you thought like not rhyming, but like idk rose, and daisy?
Oooooomg i havent even watched it yet and im so excited
i think your having twins because earlier this year you suffered a sad miscarriage god or whoever you believe in gave you that baby back along with another. it’s really a miracle! 🥰 love you colleen congratulations on your pregnancy!!! 🤍
FLYNN IS SO CUTE I CANT TAKE IT
Aaaaaaaawwwwweeeee!!!  Nevaeh &  heaven for 2 girls? Lmao
Stop hating on her it’s hard being pregnant
i’d be more comfortable to come out to you, than i would be to my mother 😐
He is so cute! You just gave me inspiration to make my kids a box and let them pick something like each week.
with this pregnancy, you’ll love pregnancy belts
BABY BOY NAME: ILLIAM, said like William without the W. :)) goes so well with many girl names and boy names
I was the same way I was ALWAYS hungry. I'd drink over a gallon if water a day and I tried to eat as healthy of options as possible and they couldn't find any reason (and I had a singleton)
You could be having a reactive hypoglycemia, where when you are eating sugary foods your blood sugar is spiking and then sharply dropping low (making you shake). My mom has this and can be dangerous. I’d talk with the doc about your shaking.
Kalvin and Kaitlin  Kiara and Katherine  Kolby and konner
Lol. I'm so down for calling your twins Francesca and Tweed until further notice. 🤣🤣🤣
Some names that go together are Sara and Kyle
Everyone enjoining there egg tea- mmhmm yummy egg tea!  Me- mmmhhhmm yummy salmonella!
Are we not gonna talk about how Flynn has some cake at 5:33
Hi! I’m a fan, and a licensed MD. While it’s true that every pregnancy is different, the recommended weight gain per trimester is to help you avoid developing complications like gestational diabetes while you’re pregnant. You’re also not eating for two (or three because yay twins!!!!), and by two I mean two adults. You do need more than your usual calories, but not twice or thrice your usual adult daily caloric intake. Your blood sugar might be low that’s why you’re shaking. You can eat healthy snacks in between meals to help avoid the jitters that hypoglycemia causes. Have a safe pregnancy, Colleen! Love you!!
The **Pftchhh** Sounds are so cute- I remember making pretend tea when I was younger with my friends too-
GIRL. TRIPLETS?
Ya know ... I never thought about making puppy chow that way .. usually I mix it in the bag or in the bowl... I'ma have to try this way 👍😊😹😸😸
Do you have any plans for Miranda being pregnant
You got me craving sum puppy chow now too lol
I know it’s tough with nausea controlling what you can stomach, but try cutting back on your carb/sugar intake a bit & adding more protein. It takes longer to burn so you won’t get so shaky & feel like you need to eat as often
2:01 Ariana was so young here!
Ethan & Hila are probably having triplets 😳 definitely twins! Also if you are feeling bad about eating, please don’t. Hila is experiencing the SAME thing with constantly eating when before, she barely ate. Now she has to constantly eat.
The shaking is probably low blood sugar.
Colleen: Im having a baby! also-Colleen Im having Twins!! Now I think im having triplets!!!
Being hungry all the time is my thing! And I’m only pregnant with one. The book “what to expect when you’re expecting” brings out soooo many good nutritional points including how often you can be eating & what is included in a healthy diet, while pregnant or not! (I say “diet” but I mean that in the sense of what a person eats in a day, not meaning restricting yourself to certain foods.) What is really important is that you are eating more often, but less amounts. This helps with all the symptoms... bloating, indigestion, heartburn, & constipation! 💘 luv ya dear
Ok. I don’t understand how anyone says that. They say you have to up your calorie intake! Babies are literally cute parasites lol
Colleen me too 😭😭 i get so sick if I'm not ALWAYS eating. Like I feel like I'm starving even though I just ate
My “friends” that are twins names are lilly and lainey. they dont rhyme, they do have like the l’s and y’s the same but i think they go well together
Sorry not box but boy
If one is a girl  you should call her Daisy and if it's a box Dylan
Currently eating puppy chow as I watch this🤪
if there 2 girls i like faith and nicole
You are having triplets 😁😁😁😁😁😁
"I'm vlogging it's boring I'm colleeeeen" so cute omg
I have the same problem with getting shaky if i dont eat. You might be low on iron. Or your blood sugar is low
What vlog did they start doing the pickle thing? I wanna see the first time Flynn does it.
I have no videos 😢😫😭😿💔💔😿😫😭😢
I’m a twin baby and my beautiful mum only thought she was having one until delivery day! She had multiple scans too! You never know... there might be a lil one hiding in there.
It is my.channel
I thought that it was twins!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don’t even feel like that’s a normal proportion of food to have when not pregnant... sometimes I worry about colleens eating habits, pregnancy or not. Only eating one real meal a day is not healthy even if it’s become normalized
Yes the companies are making money off of queer people but like, if they're not donating to queer organizations and they're not accurately representing queer people and queer identities then it's like...they're just capitalizing off of queer people
Reach out to Hila from h3! She’s having twins for sure, possibly triplets!
C: coffee! F: ....MILK C: 😳 that had me rolling for some reason!
I have fraternal girl twins, we named them Riley and Savannah. They will be 3 in December 😀
Twin run in my family and it skippes a generation and my grandma had twins so I might have twins now I am kinda scared
Watch it turn into 4
do a pregnecy craving vid plz
Love how colleen choose my name to say my name is francesca loll
Im a triplet!
*love*
Omg love this
*names kids Franchesca and Tweed*
What if we birth  babies by mouth.... the amount of dry-heaving
nobody: flynn: uh oh i spilled it 🥺 he’s so precious i just love him😂🥺🥺
Flynn is so adorable
Supporters of the LGBTQ plus community are actually called allies just a fun fact
How about Jackie and Lynn
its so normal my mom gained 65 with my sister and 77 with me !
"it's hard to be cool on a minivan" by go fish 😌 thank me later.
No one should be shamed for gaining 70lbs whether they pregnant or not and collen is carrying 2 babies and she is fueling her body.
Stop hating on her for what she eats every other content creator acts like they eat nothing at least she is honest about it honestly it’s really helpful and refreshing
Maybe some protein, complex carbs vs simple carbs found in bagel, poptarts.  So excited for you
A friend of mine gained 50 lbs every pregnancy. She loses it afterwards with exercise. My sil could eat two whole breakfasts every morning, could take or leave lunch, and had NO interest in dinner.  Every woman's body is different.
I mean you are eating for 3 Twins And Colleen
GIRL. I’m in my first trimester too and cold watermelon and jolly ranchers are 🙌 (also life saver mints)
Colleen: rumours about triplets H3 podcast: we’re having twins or triplets
I  get really jittery when I eat a lot of carb heavy things without balancing more evenly with veggies, fats and proteins. Could by why you are getting shaky. Your body could be telling you to eat more proteins which keep you full longer too!
Listen to your body!!! Unless your doctor is concerned about your or the babies’ health, eat whatever the hell you want whenever the hell you want (except alcohol and sushi and soft cheese lol)
Your not eating to fill up 3 people but you are eating like you are constantly working out essentially. When you are working out for hours a day every single day and looking to maintain weight you need more calories, you body is using an abundance of energy for the babies so you need more calories as well
GOOD BABY NAMES:2 girls, Veronica, Vanessa and Roney, and Nessa for short,: 2 boys, Ethan and Eric,: a boy and a girl, Ava and Tyler! hope this helps!! also love u and ur vids!!<333
If it wasn’t for C sections, my mom, my brothers, and me would not be here. My dad would be very sad.
The intro where Flynn sings is so cute ☺️
I shake when I haven’t eaten. I just think my blood sugar drops a bit. Keep drinking water!!!
Flynn is so adorable🥺I just can’t wait for these babiessss
colleen please just listen to your body and eat as much as you need to!! it is nothing to be ashamed of
“I just said it” lmao
Does it hurt to push
you need to try watermelon with yellow mustered
Hi Colleen! Going back to the name matching for the babies! My twin brother and sister have similar names and now they are 19, I feel like they have grown up with identity issues. Sometimes with twins they have a hard time with identity. I’m not sure with the science behind it but it’s something to think about. My siblings have similar names and we always referred to them as “the twins” never really independently. It may also cause them to top each other’s actions.
Colleen:oooo it’s coffee Flynn:NO ITS MILK
I was so hungry during my pregnancy! Waking up feeling like I was starving.
You’re the best mama🥺
the majority of the videos “making fun of pride clothes” are lighthearted rating videos of brands that are not donating to pro lgbtq+ organizations and are just putting them out there to make a profit for themselves. from what i’ve seen its people who are glad that there are pride lines but for kicks and giggles rate them for fun. i understand completely where you and kory are coming from though because there are a few people who are just bashing them with no harmless intent and that is not okay.
I do wanna tell you something when you felt like you were gonna pass out you had low blood sugar meaning there isn’t enough sugar in you blood stream the best way to get it up is a coke or something sugary I’m a type I diabetic but anyone can have it you Become super hungry, shaky,and light headed if it gets too low you can pass out your welcome, your friend cherry
Colleen can you make a video on names that you  like for the twins please💕
Flynn is precious
“....through my hole..”🤢 you could have just said naturally 🤣🤣
I make puppy chow in a bag so there’s no mess
It’s really cool because I’m a twin and I have an older SISTER
Eat what you want when you want. I had my children 38 yes ago. I gained a bunch. Like you. I needed that weight.
Butiful
“Coffee! :D” “>:) milk”
My cousins are twins there called Shannon and tigon The there are some ppl from my school who are twins and there called Ryan and Brandon  (Just some ideas for u 🙂)
Why does it say triplets not twins
C-Section saved my not so little mans life and my own! My second I had to have another c-section because I cannot give birth naturally now... you will be absolutely fine if you need to have one! Just get up and move ASAP, I was up and taking care of them with in a couple hours... how ever I do get that some women can take a little longer to be mobile again! 🥰
Still is dangerous to be loud and proud in some places....sad, but true....
colleens twins names : Francesca and Tweed
Just thought I should tell you that I've been praying for you and that this pregnancy goes a lot better than your last one so you can have some peace, and that you have healthy babies. Love you!💕
My aunt gained 80 pounds with her first pregnancy. She didn’t regret it.
Colleen you habe two Miracles inside of you you have made 1 already. Never doubt yourself. You are in my prayers, and many other.peoples I'm sure of it. Anyways... I'm sending you some  💅🏻glitter💅🏻
I ate soooooo much watermelon during both my pregnancies. And drank lots of strawberry lemonade. Have you tried the Outshine Watermelon popsicles? Those did the trick when I couldn’t get fresh watermelon.
Also for names bonnie and clyde if you had a girl and a boy wouldnt just be funny it would also be kind of cute
my twin brother and I are Madison and Morgan and I feel like it’s good cause it’s not  to matchy but I like that they begin with the same letter .
Girl, if people dont wanna hear about your pregnancy then they dont have to watch but for the rest of us we are here to learn about whatever you a posting about, so never apologize for talking about your pregnancy
Colleen says doo doo fluid  Me thinks about how Flynn called candy doo doo''s Me again so there's candy fluid in one of the sacks
Oh love how at the end of the video she had powder sugar on her shirt!!!😂😂
yes pls do not do matching names, as a twin that just seems so dehumanizing
Put watermelon in the freezer!!!! Also grapes in the freezer are also amazing and ALSO grapes help with constipation. TMI but my grandfather had back surgery and he had to take pain meds like percocet and oxycontin and opiate pain pills cause constipation so my grandfathers dr told him to eat grapes they help with the opiate constipation and again TMI but I can testify to that anytime im constipated I will eat grapes and it helps so well
I have a suggestion if you have twin girls maybe Paris and London <3
I totally get your worry about C-Sections because they are major major surgery and when people say C-Sections mean women didnt actually birth their children because they didnt birth them naturally out of their lady bits/vaheen and it makes me so mad no matter how you have your baby/babies and they get here safe thats all that matters and it infuriates me when people invalidate womens way of delivery of their baby/babies
Jesus loves you have a blessed day
you should buy a worm pillow for flynn!!!
Billie and Tommy
3:35 it was at this moment...        i started to cry or joy
I know twins irl, and I’m not going to use their names, but, their names don’t rhyme, but hey go together. It’s a really cute idea. And Colleen, whatever you name your children, we will love them and you just the same. 😃 ❤️
0:58 Did She just say, *“So I cAn kEeP oN sH*TiNg”*
Avoid the breads! I’m starving all the time also (22 weeks) when I start the day with lots of starchy sugary things it throws my body for a loop!
Hey Colleen you may not even see this but I would like to tell you that my sister-in-law is currently pregnant and she gets very intense nausea and vomit urges like you, she used to do a spoonful of lemon or lime juice which would bring down the gagging and vomiting feeling but she found these things (I’m pretty sure) she found them on Amazon called Preggie pop drops and they’re sourish candy that you suck on like a jolly ranchers but it’s meant for pregnant women to keep them from feeling nauseous and gagging as much. They come in a container with different flavors. But yeah I thought if you see this maybe you could try them and see if they help you aw well!!
Just saying, the name Micah is awesome. I have no connection to the name. I'm not biased😁😜
Sounds like your having some hypoglycemic episodes, i got them when i was pregnant and it is when your sugar levels get low/crash.. if your eating alot of sugar you increase your chances of getting them even more... Focus on complex carbs and high fats and that will help, when you feel a shaky episode coming on having some gum helps ease it also xx
i love puppy chow but in NY we call them both puppy chow and muddy buddies
You should consider hiring a doula for your pregnancy❤️ They are extremely beneficial and studies show that having a doula can help you have a smoother birth experience with a lesser chance of intervention.
Imagine you had 3 the next time if there is a next time   You would have one more then the last time
COLLEEN!! Look at the “everyone is awesome” LEGO set!!!!! Such a cute pride set that involves all of the community.
I feel like the pride clothing/items from stores(target, walmart, etc. literally any company that changes their logo to rainbow just to be like yeah we support but then don't bring up any of the issues they've been sued for for discrimination 👀) that arent solely lgbtq+ market off of the lgbtq+ community(I'm pansexual so dont come after me pls), instead why cant it be like for example "half the donation goes to support trans bottom/top surgery" but I do understand "trying"
Has bad pregnancy. Wants another baby but afraid of being pregnant again. Ends up pregnant and gets multiple babies out of one pregnancy
I have a idea if you have to girls you should name them Emma and Haley
😂 idk why but when u started singing legally blonde I got so excited 😆 like I said, idk why, I feel like it should be expected on this channel
Get mr Kate go do the nursery again please
I can't get over the fact that she is having TWINS
I am a twin and my mom had to have get a sea section and for all my other siblings too
I knew some twins named Ethan and Cole.
When Flynn started singing I about lost it ….. so cute!!!!
I am happy for you guys and hope you have fun naming the babies!! I'm an identical twin and our names don't rhyme but kinda go together. They are Kayla and Krysta. We would have been Mark and Erik if we were boys 😁
Omg..
1:40 i JUST ate carrots with ranch. Lol
What about for girls willow and Phoenix or emery
I literally forgot u were pregnant because the cuteness of Flynn and teacups just killed me so I was confused when you said you were craving... which is a normal thing for people to do it just confused meAa
🛐🛐✝️✝️
You need protein and whole grains!!!!! Bagels, carrots, and pop tarts are carbs and are used very quickly by your body. Protein and whole grains will last much longer and your blood sugar won’t fluctuate up and then down so much to the point that you are shaky and hypoglycemic.
I know nothing about pregnancy but I’m a twin and I saw a picture of my mom when she was pregnant with me and my twin and let me tell you her stomach was huge she said she couldn’t put shoes on and could barley walk .-.
We’re Having Similar Symptoms But Your’s Are 2x Mine Andddddd I’m Having A Boy 🙃🙃🙃. Just A Thought Lol
If you are shakey, could be hypoglycaemia, drink a juice box and then 10/15 minutes later eat something with carbs and protein! Love you and can't wait for these gorgeous babies on the way
I got super excited because of the legally blonde reference. I'm also so excited to be watching you through this journey. It makes me less scared of pregnancy later on when I'm ready to be a mom for the rest of my life. 😊🥰😁
Bagel, pop tarts, grapes, all are composed of mostly carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are absorbed fast, especially if they're not whole grain.Try adding some protein, so that you stay full longer. Maybe add an egg, or peanut butter or yogurt, cheese, legumes, etc. :)
My mom and aunt didn’t make the cousins named match or anything but we al have n sounds at the end of our names (Megan,Austin,Brayden etc.). I think it makes them sound like they go together idk lol.
My mom gained 90 pounds when pregnant with me
I could literally listen to Flynns intro on repeat for like 2 hours straight 😂 hes just so CUTE and Handsome 😍
I'm pretty sure your eating for 2 when your pregnant(or for you- 3) because when your pregnant the baby takes all your like- stuff I can't explain it
When my mom doesn’t eat she gets so shaky, but she has anxiety so
When did you find out you were having triplets??????? And which video is that in?
When my mom was pregnant with me she always craved chocolate and now I love chocolate
i understand what colleen is saying about the rainbow clothes….but thats rainbow capitalism- they’re profiting off of the rainbow theme of lgbtq+…idk i feel like there is a difference between supporting and making clothes that give big corps money because of the idea.
whens your gender reveal???
hi, i'm tweed.
I’m a triplet :)
I am a twin and I am not a C-section baby
i love how in the introw it sounds like flynn says: im vloging im boring im the qween when it is im colleeeeeeen! sorry bout the bad spelling:)
9:10 that was the highlight of my day🤣🤣🤣🤣 love you Colleen💛💛
"Ice cream🙄✋ I just said it😠"
The intro is ADORABLE!!!!!
I was the same exact way when pregnant both times i HAD to be eating or snacking at all times or I would get so sick dry heaving apart of me wonders too if it could have to do with needing more of certain vitamins like maybe I was lacking some but idk it was the worst 😩
I’m sorry, is anyone else freaking out that there is MORE to the Little Teapot song?!?  She sang ‘whistle, whistle, whistle’ and I was like 👁👄👁
Try dill pickles wrapped in salami with cream cheese
Twins i had no idea I've been grounded and I didn't get it till now
Name them off countries!
I gained 60! And sweat it all off a few weeks after birth. Every BODY is different!
Colleen’s pride song had me dying!!! Literally how is she so creative to come up with that on the spot!!!!
my twin sister and i have the same name, she's Amelia and i'm Emily lol
The issue I have is what is called “rainbow-washing” where big corps are really just using pride month as a means to profit off of the lgbtq+ community by stamping rainbows on merchandise and then not doing anything for the community itself or only donating small amounts orrrr simultaneously funding anti lgbtq+ politicians
Flynn is SO cute
Girl!! You got two placentas!! That's 4 births!! There's NO way!!!
"uh oh I spilled it". Flynn coming through with that improv commitment!!!
Flyn singing is a mood❤️🤍
I feel you are eating for how many you’re carrying +yourself because you all need your nutrients and your body is growing a human what does it matter how much you gain during pregnancy 🤰 I completely agree with you colleen
If u have too girl call them Lily and Rose
You should watch Jesssfams video of her having a natural birth with her twin boys!
That intro is the cutest
Watermelon is m6 favorite and I don't like cherry Jolley ranchers
Favorite food
Y
Omg I had a dream I was hanging out with Flynn last night and he asked me about the babies in my tummy 😂
The intro is so CUTE
02:01 is that Ariana Grande???
Gavin or David  Haha maybe😂
i feel like a lot of people think that most of the big corporations that put out pride merch are mostly just trying to capitalize off of us instead of support so that’s why people make fun of them
If it’s a boy and girl you could name them Reagan and Russell
I like the name Sydney
That was so cute  when they were playing tea party🤗
The fact that stores are even doing Pride stuff is amazing 👏🙌🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
You have to eat pretty constantly and eat more when you’re pregnant. You’re not eating for 3 full sized humans, you’re eating for you and two babies that use up a lot of your energy. You’re completely justified to fuel your body
It's odd to me u think that sandwich is weird.. it's basically jus a egg salad sandwich or a deviled egg.. (Shrugs)
this is flynn’s doing XD C- How many are in there flynn? F- THREE!! C- Three?!? F- TWO!! C- few HAHAHA
i agree, i think twin/sibling names sound better when they flow nicely together but they don’t sound too similar
Colleen I will post this on every post until I can help you lol. PLEASE try the "Relief Band Premium" I have awful nausea issues and it gets rid of nausea immediately.  It is used for multiple things pregnancy, anxiety, sea sickness, motion sickness, morning sickness, hangovers ect. It has helped me not be nauseous anyone. Please try it I promise you will feel better <3 Love you Colleen!
You are such an amazing mom... its weird to say but in all honesty im sitting here tearing up your so amazing. Flynn is the absolute cutest thing ever. You both are doing an amazing job and I cannot wait to see the beautiful twins!!
My little brother was supposed to be a twin but one was missed carried early on but my mom was going over her medical records since she was traveling. Then she saw she had an extra egg that could’ve been a third.
how do your miranda sing voice
I know what nutty buddy check mix is, ITS SO gooooood
It’s perfect this is in my birthday
Omggggggg
Maybe try oatmeal in the morning with Bananas and peanut butter.
i read somewhere recently on a post about little tips and tricks when you're feeling unwell that humming can help stop you from throwing up...maybe humming will help with your gagging too?
I can’t get over how good of parents you guys are Flynn is so lucky to have you guys
I loooooove ur intro lollll
Flynn is not helping a rumour of the triplets 🤣
psychic: 'he's gonna be all boy, jumping off the walls' Flynn: having a tea party and singing I'm a little teapot.  What a cutie!!!!!!!!!!!!
Friend! The shaking is most likely due to the white starches. They send your blood sugar soaring through the roof and then crash even faster. Try switching things out for whole grains/Whole Foods . :). Also eat whatever you can keep down currently as your nausea is terrible too. First trimester is rough! You’re almost through! Keeps going, you’re doing great ❤️
Sugar is bad
When he said he spilled it oh my gosh 🥺 that little dude has the best imagination y’all giving me baby fever
OMG!
The song about pride month. Was *chefs kiss* amazing
good luck on everything and I think you are an amazing mother. you will be such a good mother and already are.
I loved this Pride Month song, it was amazing.
Whatever weight you gain as long as the baby is healthy it’s fine! Flynn needed all of that extra love clearly look how happy and healthy he is 🥰 you did amazing growing him and youll do amazing with these two babies
Colleen: Franchesca and Tween  Me:  Fiona and Timothy
im vwlogging, its borwing, im colleeeee-eheheheen :)
My aunt and uncle are twins. They’re Ronnie and Rosie. Their childhood nicknames were nonie and yogi because they couldn’t pronounce each other’s names.
The thing about pride, it's true that we should acknowledge how far we've come and how great it is that they're trying, but some companies do it just to say they did and to profit off of it. It's not just about them not being cute, it's about them not getting members of the lgbtq+ community to design them, not donating to a charity, etc. Again, it's amazing that we've come this far and we should be proud of the representation we're getting, but we gotta call them out when they're just trying to profit from it
i like how ur not matching the names. ive heard lots of twins say they prefer individual ones
Holly and Charlie, Tommy and mickey I think are too twin names that go well together if u like them x
My moto was if I felt hungry, I would eat. If my stomach is growling, that’s when I would eat more food. 🙂 If you’re shaking, it’s already a bit late a you’ll be playing catch-up all day. So I recommend eating a banana or something that will raise your sugar & iron first thing in the morning. Maybe even keep it by your bedside.  <3
I cant wait for the babies to be born Colleen btw don't worry about anything you've got a whole family taking care of you!!
You are eating for 2...? You need to eat everything you would normally eat to function at your bodies usual energy output, plus some extra for the increased energy output the baby puts on your body. Babies themselves are parasitic, not symbiotic, they also need nutrients to grow and develop and that comes directly from you. Any nutrients that go from you to baby are nutrients then that your body can’t use for itself, which you then must replace so your body has enough nutrients for itself.  Who told you you’re not eating for two? If it was your doctor that was some 60’s as shit and you need to get a new one NOW.
Guys it’s called cravings let her be please ✨😌
Who me yeah maybe be .... ...nd who  cares ....oh your stay pretty , pretty il ur hair
oooo maria-kate and ashton
Can y’all please stop shamming her for eating, it’s her body and if u never been pregnant u wouldn’t know how she feels
I kame twice
I have some friends that are twins. They are boy girl and named Aidan and Nadia. I think it’s the cutest because Nadia is Aidan backwards!!
we love colleen
I want a worm pillow and I’m not even pregnant
lol
im a twin girl and my name is kyla and my twin is kendra and my mom  had a c cecshen
Maranda!
HAPPY PRIDE MONTH EVERYONE <3
9:10 wow she still got it. So are you calling Broadway or is Broadway calling you.
Imagine sitting down your children 15 years after the birth, broken down crying, and you tell them "sweetie, I have a confession, I used to you and your brothers ultrasounds and births as clickbait on YouTube! I'm so sorry."
Eric is such ⏃ good father
My parents purposely chose my sister and I’s names so that they don’t match or rhyme. They did it because they wanted us to be seen as our own people, and not just always a pair. Natasha and Chantel
Flynn is a beautiful boy
For Flynn.  If you haven’t done this already a great game with cups of tea is ew there is a worm in my tea or even a bee in my tea and I’m quite sure you could dramatise this. I’ve always done with my children and now my grandchildren children.
Watching Flynn learn more and more is so cool and his sense of humor!! “Oops i spilled it” lol hes such a cool little dude 😂😂
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iscO9yxp9wI&t=6s
triplets rumor came from Flynn 😂 he is so adorable
take it easy girl
aweeeeeeeeee  her intro im coleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
5:43 The sass tho 🤣
im soo happy that colleen is pregnant uhh i love her sm
https://youtu.be/A2utnO6i9mY
I feel like a lot of people aren't eating well/balanced/enough. Like pregnant or not, a lot of people don't seem to be eating like... real meals? even when they sit down to eat.   If Colleen wants to eat, and eat a good deal when she does.   Then she. Should. Eat.   No one is in her body but herself and her babies. Shut up and let her eat, goshdangit 😂😂
flynn saying "I just said it..." made me laugh out loud 🤣🤣
Yo try freezing cut up watermelon, it's like a popsicle
We call puppy chow muddy buddies and now I wanna start calling it puppy chow😂
Bagel, poptarts and grapes are all carbs. Maybe you need protein and fats too
so cute!!
What a beautiful family :)  Flynn is the sweetest and you guys make amazing parents
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Well I know being part of the b in the lgbtqia+ community, many of us don't like how many companies will capitalize on us, like many marginalized communities, and say only 10-20% will being going to a specific foundation, when if you truly were for the community, and true it's awesome to actually see it because it hasn't really been welcomed, but don't just celebrate and profit off of us for a month, celebrate us always because we aren't are sexualities or identities only for the month...just think about it <3
Okay but why do I feel like one of the babies is giving Daphne vibes (I’m sorry that this doesn’t make any sense)
I think what was being made in the 90s in the media is way higher quality than anything being produced now. I think in the 1930s they had better media technology then the crap being forced down peoples throats these days. I cant find anything anywhere that I would want to watch. Not at all. Zero since 2008
Thanks for 5 subscribe Ab 50 karvado Lave you all ❤️❤️❤️
colleen:"And clowns kinda scare meee" Also Colleen: **Escape the night season 3 flashbacks**
Flin: I’m  vlogging! Is boring! I’m Colleen!
omg yasss flynn is such a diva in a GOOD way he was just like " i just said it" i bet he was thinking jeez dad you didnt hear me say it.... you need to get better hearing lol
omg that pride song was so perfect as a part of lgbt i loved it so much
I’ve never heard any healthcare professional say you should only gain 30 pounds when pregnant and I work in healthcare. I also never saw one person be down on you for gaining 70 pounds. Only saw people tell you how beautiful you are. What are you going on about? Makes no sense....
I dont like anything in the media.
colleen theyre not really trying to "support us" they're just trying to make money off of us like if they wanted to support us they could donate or something for example my aunt just bought uno pride cards like how in any way is that supporting us it's not like we can wear it to show how proud we are
Did anyone else here the somewhat demonic undertone voice at 5:46, https://youtu.be/vn4tZO0iKec?t=346 when Flynn said "I just said it?"
I was thinking you name them something lucky! Like for girls Mira short for miracle Lucky and Charm!
We are living in the Last Days. The God of the Universe, Jesus Christ will be seen by every eye on earth. The God of Israel is coming very soon for His own children. Christians who worship Jesus Christ in Spirit and Truth are about to vanish. They will be accompanied by all the innocent children of the world. They will be in the caring arms of their Father in Heaven for all eternity. Those left behind will suffer unimaginably. They will have to die for their faith in Jesus Christ.  If you're willing, now is the time to repent, turn away from sin, and prepare for the return of the King. He is coming for a bride without spot, wrinkle, or blemish. They are a holy people who are blameless in all their ways. They have the hope for eternal life, after death or the rapture.  Jesus Christ will transform the willing into His own image, and for His Glory. He will prepare anyone who's willing to spend eternity with Him. God is merciful and kind. Mercy time is now, tommorow is never promised. There are many who found themselves at the wrong end destination. They are trapped in the underworld for all eternity. They plead for mercy, but it's too late for them. When they were alive they never cared about their eternal destination. They never walked in holiness and righteousness, therefore they were found unworthy to inherit the kingdom of heaven. We must always be found worthy to inherit God's everlasting kingdom at death or the rapture. God will transform those who are willing, and prepare them for eternity.  And also, please avoid the Covid-19 vaccine if you love Jesus Christ. Those who take the vaccine have no more hope for salvation. They have destroyed the image of God within them, therefore God will also destroy them. I find no pleasure in the death of sinners. I warn tirelessly because I care with all my heart. It's not God's will that anyone perish, but all repent to recieve eternal life. Reject the Covid-19 vaccine or Jesus Christ will utterly reject you. I warn because I care.   If you're willing, now is the time to repent and prepare for the return of the King. He is coming very soon for His own children. They will have the hope for eternal life. The Lord's return will be the Greatest Event in Human History. Please be found worthy to escape the wrath of God. This is the end, everything written in the book of revelation will be fulfilled.
that was a beautiful gay song, colleen, thank you
5:46 “i just said it...” THAT SENT ME OMG SASSY FLYNNNN 😭
I'm saying 2 girls. I've always heard girl's heartbeats are faster than boys. But, I'm not a doctor, not a scientist, lol. It's just something I have always heard
Let’s remember that a lot of these companies putting out “LGBTQ+” lines of clothing are just capitalizing on being politically correct! If they are going have these clothing lines, they should at LEAST be donating to organizations working towards queer rights. Just my thoughts!
My younger sisters are triplets.
You need to eat protein it will sustain your body longer than carbs.❤️
Flynn singing I’m a little teapot made my heart melt 🥺🥺🥺
Omgggggggg I found u eeeeee I’m sooo happy after a year I found u on youtube
Oh, the joys of multiples! I was originally pregnant with quintuplets and eventually gave birth to twins. I had a lot of complications/symptoms that the drs were concerned about, but which I think were likely totally "normal" for gestating 4 and 5 fetuses at a time. Best wishes to you and your family!
I had to have a C-Section with my daughter & the recovery was SO painful for me. Recovery sucked. It hurt for me to bend over, it hurt just to walk in general. And sleeping was superrr hard. I couldn’t lay on my sides. I only could sleep laying flat on my back. If you end up having one I pray it goes smoothly and that you recover well!!
Do you have pregnancy diabetes, have you been checked?  🤔
If it’s 2 girls you could do Zoey and Kenzie kinda sounds alike but not really
I had sooo much watermelon when I was pregnant, my baby is probably half watermelon 🍉🤣
When I was pregnant with ONE I starved like that. To the point of shaking. So I can imagine with two.
I would be so scared if I didn’t plan my day with food into it ... like I get you . YOU BECOME SO SPECIFIC ABOUT IT .
Honestly, as long as you’re active but careful after postpartum C-section, it isn’t that bad, just have a pillow beside because it does suck when you sneeze or cough 😬
That intro is my favourite 😂☺️🥺
Yes w/ pride clothes. I remember the first time I saw a tiny pride section in target. I couldnt believe my eyes. I was afraid to stop and look. I think especially in conservative communities it just nice to have people see it and almost desensitize them. Make it "normal" especially for the next generation
Can u please add subtitles?  I have a hearing loss
Up your protein and greens. You could be anemic, try to up your iron, again with the greens
Everyone probably read the title wrong and thought she was having triplets because now she's on trending 🤩😂
My aunt had a seasection with her twins and she found out that one had cerebral palsy a day before having them
When she has to bring desserts for her kids events, she is going to be the puppy chow one I hope
😂😂😂 You are so silly.  You gotta raise them. No more clubs, parties.  You stuck at home.😂
Flynn is so precious!!!
My grandpa is a twin and his mom had no idea there were two in there until two came out so she called them Ronald and Donald
You need to get tested for gestational diabetes
can you please do another muck bang woth JoJo??
4 pregnancies gained 50lbs each time and it was so funny with my 3rd the doctor would mention my weight gain at every appointment id always leave thinking how glad i felt it was my 3rd go around and not the 1st where that would have worried me or made me feel bad.
Wait this is supposed to be what mothers do with their kids? 👁👄👁
Early March 2021 I saw Colleen has been vlogging for a whole year...so i watched from March 2020 until NOW and i am officially all caught up 😂 so excited to watch this twin pregnancy journey!!!
we love a personalized song for us!! 🏳️‍🌈😂
Does anyone else love this cute intro
The moment when Flynn said “I just said it” made me laugh so hard he’s so adorable and growing up so fast! But he’s so sweet you guys are wonderful parents
Colleen : talking about pregnancy Me: Focusing of what she has in the fridge
May I put the names Sophia and Nathan into the baby names pot?
Your own sister didn’t like the clothes 😭😭😭😭
Regular medium meals are SO NORMAL during pregnancy. You need so MUCH energy to build humans. Not to mention your blood sugar and blood pressure is all wack. Keep eating girl!
Could the shaking when not constantly eating be caused by gestational diabetes? Gestational diabetes is when a mother becomes diabetic when pregnant. According to the CDC, there usually aren't any symptoms of gestational diabetes, but this may be a good starting place. I would explain to your doctor your symptoms and ask to be tested for gestational diabstes. I hope this helps. Here is a link to the CDC article I skimmed through about gestational diabetes: https://www.cdc.gov
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU that pride representation is incredibly important. I also am apart of the community, and the problem with big corporations like target and Walmart etc. using the pride flag is called pride washing. They are using not using our flag to celebrate pride month but instead as a marketing technique to gain sales. These companies are also less likely to support or donate money to the LGBTQ+ community and only slap a pride flag on products to make money. I also completely empathize with your point of view because growing up there was no representation at all and it’s great to see our flag way high in the sky and at big stores but once you look a little deeper you can see that their intentions are not prideful. SO MUCH LOVE!!! I just wanted to share my thoughts! ❤️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️❤️ thank you for creating a safe space to have a conversation!
How can a transssexual have kids?!
Omg stop now I’m craving puppy chow !😭😭I have all the ingredients except the cereal :/
Who else wishes Colleen would talk about Ariana more💞
Thank you for the c section talk.  I appreciate the normalizing of it. I know at-least where I am it stigmatized.
Ty for supporting our community!! HAPPY PRIDE MONTH MY FELLOW ALPHABET MAFIA FAM!!!! :)
Everyone I know that had twins had a csection because of the risk of one baby flipping after the other one is out
I love Colleen and her family but I do not support pride month.
Ur babies name them watever u want but I wouldnt do the matching or rhyming names cuz ull want them to have their own identity n not think that u see them as the same person or something,prob wouldnt feel special or unique if they're named the same n constantly made to dress the same n everything lol
I love how it sounds like Flynn is saying “I’m the Queen!” In the intro
Flynn is literally 2 and is already giving his dad attitude
Watch Colleen name her twins Francesca and Tweed
Your family is so sweet!
I thought the same thing when I saw the pictures on the reveal for twins I saw three and I was like 🤨hmm u having triplets
Uhhh i had a dream last night that you'll have a boy and a girl 😳
I am a twin and this how my mom and dad did the thing for naming us and if they wanted it to rhyme or match or be fine they want it to be fine together and also the doctors always called baby a baby baby baby so on and so on so they decided to name us after baby A and baby P so they would pick names that start with an a and started with a B instead of picking matching names and it sounds fine together so maybe this will help y’all with your picking out what’s the names will be.😜😜😜
I can’t believe this is trending!!
Wait- YOUR HAVING TRIPLETS?!?!?!?! COLLEN OH MY GAWD JSHSISHDSJUD AHHHHHHHH GIRL IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!!!!    Oh gosh I need to chill it's still twins lmfao love you guys
Colleen should put our pride march. If you see this Colleen please put out pride merch!
The Miranda singing bit at the end made me wonder about Miranda´s reaction to having twins haha
Your son is so adorable!
I AM a triplet and my mom (and her doctor) thought she was having twins until 20 weeks when they were surprised to find 3 babies... just saying 🤷‍♀️
Pregnancy pillow is my favorite and I'll probably keep it after Pregnancy too
Can pregnancy make you hypoglycemic?
@colleen Now that it's getting hot outside, try cutting up watermelon and freezing it... also grapes. SO GOOD!
one baby for colleen: too much, never again! two babies for colleen: FAR too much!! THREE BABIES FOR COLLEEN: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I don't know you but based on recent trending videos I know you are pregnant, you are having twins, and now maybe triplets
i hope everything goes good !
Wait? WHAT SHE HAS TRIPLETS!
When Flynn said its  ice cream  I just said it  😂🥰
Low blood sugar
If it is a girl and a boy you should do Brinley and Braden Or for a girl name Brielle ( Sorry I just had to say Brielle  for a girl cause that is my name )
Flynn: chocolate ice creammm! Erik: what is it? Flynn: I just said it 🙄😂
with the pride merch thing . i don't care if it's not cute. however, its worrying that huge businesses are profiting from pride month but don't actually support the lgbtq+ community. most businesses don't donate any money to charities and it's all very performative. if a business supports the lgbtq+ community, they should do it all year round, not just when it's profitable and easy for them.
can you do a video of baby names you guys love?! kind of like what Jessica and Chris did.
You should get checked for gestational diabetes. My mom had it with all four of her pregnancies
OH BABY A TRIPLE
Happy Pride month! <3
i think the reason people dismiss the idea of "eating for two" is because of the image that the baby is actually ingesting the bites of food you put in your mouth.  your baby isnt directly eating that food, but you DO have to up your food intake bc of the added stress on your body. while youre also most likely not eating DOUBLE what you ate before, in that sense you are eating for two
Hi I'm Anna big fan your son is adorable I can't wait for the gender revels I bet there going to be beautiful
Same girl! My doctor said because when your pregnant your body stops regulating your blood sugar.... and it’s part of the reason why morning sickness is a thing because obviously you aren’t eating all night to keep it going
I gained 20 lbs in 3 years and I'm not even pregnant so you do you girl! Grow those babies 😍
If only flynn knew things are about to change
Girl, it's a fact that you are eating for 2 or 3... pregnant women do need to consume more calories.  Think about it...you're literally creating life!  That takes energy.   So you eat when you feel hungry!  And don't you ever feel bad about it.
If there both girls you can name them Demi and Denali
Please do a video with MDJ about twins and asking pregnancy questions or going through things that nobody tells you about pregnancy!
Great job Flynn for singing the song !! So sweet
Flynn pouring everyone tea and milk and eggs was the cutest thing ever
what helped me during my morning sickness was deep fried chicken nuggets and deep fried pizza rolls
Don’t listen to what they say - eat what you feel you need to eat and then what you want 🙌🏻 you’re feeding babies and need to have enough nutrients to sustain you as well. Do. You. 👏🏻👏🏻
Wait, wait, wait, she does know that Rachel tested pride closes and threw shade at them right?
Lucien and madilyn for girl boy names
Dang yall are fertile as hell. Lol
My mom had a Caesarean with my sister and she told me that she felt nothing and they had a curtain up between her and her abdomen so that she couldn’t see the cut of that helps any!
Definitely try to eat a lot of sweet fruits for the shaking! My aunty had triplets  with IVF and she was constantly shaky and the doctor said she had low sugar and it caused the shaking, and it was apparently a little worse because she had multiples. Doc told her lots of fruit could help. I hope you feel better!
i just found out that this is miranda sings
I think the criticism over big company pride collections isn't directed at the cosmetic factor but that the companies clearly don't mean it. Most companies claim diversity in their workplaces, donating to charities, etc. But don't follow through. They mainly release the collections because it creates a whole new group of people to consume their products.
HOLE????  Yikes!!!  C’mon 🙃
Doctors really do need to chill though, there was one doctor who told my friend that if she didn't start eating then they were gonna get DSS on her because she's 18 and its counted as "abuse" but she was eating a lot... her body is different then everyone else's.
I, like you, am an ally if the LGBTQ+ community. The complaints I’ve seen about the pride lines of clothing at stores is not the ugliness of the clothes, but the fact that many of these stores have released these lines solely for their own profit. They aren’t donating any of the proceeds to LGBTQ+ organizations. The only reason some of these companies put out these products is because it’s “trendy” right now. They aren’t making any moves towards actually helping the community. Also, some companies only put this stuff out at this time of year. If you’re going to be an ally, be an ally all year long, not just for the month of June.
flynn is so genuinely funny i can’t take it
Who else thought Colleen was literally gonna eat straight up dog food when she said she wanted puppy chow🤭🤪
you're shaking probably bc of all the sugar you had ... sounds like high blood sugar to me.
I best friends are twins and there names are Maeve and Maryn.... so ya
You posted on my birthday
OMg
Flynn: I'm a Little teapot Me: watch out Ariana grande Flynn is coming  for your career
Pregnant right now. CANT STOP EATING !!! Lol. I’m soOooO hungry. It goes from zero to I’m going to die in an instant, basically every 30 min.
Thank you so much for pointing out that your body does what it needs and is supposed to do! Combating pressure about our bodies is hard
Sophie and Harry is cute together for baby twins ❤️
I feel like sometimes when you talk about the lgbt situation it might be good to say “here in the us” or something like that because where I’m from to be out and proud is still dangerous and I feel kinda alone or overreacting when I hear about how better things supposedly are. Btw love you to death, just letting you know ❤️🌈
I shake when I am hungry to but I ain’t pregnant
Okay so here is the issue with the pride stuff, it's that they are profiting on lgbtq+ people while also not really doing anything to actually help those people. So when they do a bad job and it's clear that it's lazily thrown together by people who are not queer and do not understand what being queer and pride as a whole is about it's super upsetting. I would rather them have nothing then for Target to come out with a lesbian shirt designed by some girl named Bethany with the words "Hey Girl Hey" printed on it. If you're going to use queer people for a quick cash grab you should at least do it well and hire members of the lgbtq+ community design them.
My god Flynn is just an angel😩🥰
So sweet Flynn is always in a good mood 😁
Hi beautiful I have good day too I have good day too I love you love you love baby I love family love you husband 🇺🇲🇺🇸😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️❤️🤩😍🥰😘🖤🤎💜❤️💜❤️
3!!! Am I missing something
we need erik to tell us ab the minivan
How much longer until you do
I have my tests on Friday and I read it will possibly reveal the gender too! I'm excited but a little nervous
Colleen: "Hi, lay with me" Me: "Ummmmmmmmmm no."" LOL
Why was that pride month song kinda a bop
Flynn: lEts TrY sOmE eGgS 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
BRO SHE COULD BE HAVING TRIPLETS BRUHHHHHH
My mom gained almost 80 pounds .she weighed around 125 normally and when she was pregnant with me she weight 200. I was also an 8 pounds baby and she left the hospital weighing 130 something. She was all water. It just depends on the person and how your body reacts nothing wrong with it.
I lost almost 45 lbs pregnant
i completely agree with you on how stores are putting things out on the lgbtq+ community but it also becomes an issue when it’s rainbow-washing. this shouldn’t be the only time that stores represent the community in that way. i hope this helps but i think it’s important to understand because i also understand your perspective <3
Yea when you showed the ultrasound when you found out your having twins I saw that which I thought it might be the baby but it can be triplets
My first was an unplanned C-section, my second was planned. Because of the medicine used I don't remember much of my first, and second I had to be in the OR by myself. Over all liked my second better because the anesthesiologist gave me a numbing shot in my stomach so I wouldn't hurt do much after
uh oh i spilled it
"I just said it"
What about Ava-grace or Ava I get complements all the time about my name
Does it hurt to give birth?😬
FLYNN IS THE CUTEST OMG
Flynn was so fed up😭 “I just said it😡”
I see Miranda looking over your shoulder making a stink face the whole time at the end
I found out my nephew is having a baby with his new girlfriend meaning I'll be a Great Aunt anyone got advice for me
The fact that so many companies are creating pride things just shows that it's so much more accepted nowadays. It's a good look for a brand to support the LGBTQ+ community whereas years ago it would've been scandalous.
The little tea set is such a good idea because you can see how good Flynn is at imaginary play, I feel like toys like they are great for children to develop in many ways and it's fun. He's so darn cute
Intro omg flynn so cuteeeee
2:03 TINY COLLEEN AND TINY ARIANAAAA
I wish people would realize 'eating for two' doesn't mean eating the amount of food two adults would eat. Yes you absolutely up your calorie intake during pregnancy. Just because pregnancy is normal doesn't mean it isn't hard work
POV:  You're in the comments trying to figure out if she has triplets.
Oh my gosh Colleen singing legally blonde at the end 😂😂
Why is no one asking about MIRANDAS PREGNANCY ANNOUNCEMENT?!?!
I WILL EAT FOOD WITH YOU
really was the sweetest 🥰
my brother just came out and i love that he came out to me first i am so proud of him
I don’t think the pride flag should have been a rainbow cause ain’t the rainbow mean something in the Bible plus I love rainbows and I was finna buy some  rainbow shoe cause they were  cute and my sis was like don’t buy it’s cause it’s the pride......
I had two emergency C sections, I was terrified before both of them!!! And I am terrified of the thought of another one
I couldn’t eat anything when I pregnant with my twins until the last 2 months. I was nauseous all the time!
Typically twins (or multiples) are born via c-section because if one baby is born head first, the second baby may present in a different position (butt first, back first, feet first) which then makes it dangerous for the second baby. A lot of doctors prefer to go the safest route (c-section) but some doctors will work with you to ensure that you can deliver both vaginally.
I had  c-section with both of mine and I was asleep for one awake for 2nd . If I could choose I would say being awake was better . You don't  feel pain recovery, is quicker. Your also  more present for birth you see your babies straight away and not when meds where off. All you feel is bit of poking and pushing but nothing more then when you have tummy examination.
I can't wait to find out the genders
If you like cold watermelon ,you should try frozen grapes! Amazing 😍
Francesca and Tweed 😋
IM VLOGGING ITS BORING IM COLEEEN SCREEEE❤️
I'm a twin and me and my twin are best friends🥰♥️
5:00 Colleen was so cute I can’t 😭🥺
But June and Juli it's such a fun name for twins but like if you didn't want it it's fine
I'm a large fan or francesca and twead
I'm not pregnant, but I don't eat because I shake, I eat cuz its comforting
I noticed you had a knee pillow, i have ALWAYS used a knee pillow my entire life, do you do it even when you're not pregnant?
I’m a clown, I do not support the LGBTQ+ community at all, and I’m not sorry
Cold watermelon was also a LIFESAVER for me when I was pregnant. I had morning sickness pretty much my entire pregnancy and I wish I kept track of how many watermelons I went through lol
The best advice my OB gave me was if I am hungry then eat, your body knows what you need
Try Powerade to help with nausea! They also have Powerade zero if you want to avoid too much sugar! It has vitamin b12 for fatigue and vitamin b6 for nausea! It helped me out a TON during my pregnancy last year. I couldn't stomach water during the first trimester, so my doctor told me to try Powerade, and it helped keep me hydrated and replenish electrolytes since I vomited so much!
usually, when I shake from being hungry, I make sure I have a ham and cheese sandwich. It has protein (ham), dairy (cheese), and sugar/wheat (bread). The hunger shakes usually settle down after that. It may help you to have something similar to that if you don't like the sandwich idea. my sister's ex was diabetic so she knew a lot about it and she told me that maybe I was hyperglycemic for a minute, just needed a few ket ingredients to provide energy fuel. I'm not diabetic but we all have this from time to time I'm sure.
you know... if you eat enough watermelon in the sims you'll have girls 👀
But also how cool is it that the overwhelming reaction to pride themed clothes is about the style of the clothes themselves and not attacking the lgbtq+ community!
the song about pride month was the highlight of my day
It looks like you're having three babies I really love you and I would love to meet you I watch all the Miranda Sings and I love your YouTube channel so I really really really really really really really really want to meet you I love your videos
Collen if you see this auntie is pregnant right now and said if she feels really ill and sick she said apple juice and grapes with no skin
If it's a boy's name a Elvis and if a girl is name is Presley makes it Elvis Presley
Flynn is the cutest person I’ve ever seen 😩🥺 he is so precarious✨🥰
Puppy Chow recipe please!
I’m a first time mom (had my baby last September) I just realized I had terrible pelvic pain too...I never mentioned it to my doctor because I thought that’s just how you feel when you’re pregnant. I too could not sleep or get “comfy” without a pillow in between my legs
I’ve heard that the juice from cans of fruit help with nausea especially when you are pregnant.
When she sang that song I felt so good and happy
triplets........ i thought it was twins w
Well it's normal idk about my brother but my mom gained 65lbs she was pregnant with me.
I loved cold watermelon when I was pregnant too. The best when I was nauseous was ice cold Granny Smith apples and sour popsicles.  Lifesaver!
"😑I just said it😌"
I didn’t know pregnancy pillows help hip pain, definitely gonna get one because I have horrible hip pain 😅
If you have 2 girls name them Mary Kate and Ashley XDD
Me and my brothers names kind of work together our names are Kendall and Caleb I think are names kind of work together you tell me
I’m a triplet and never met another a triplet before but want to but not on purpose just want to run into another triplet
Please please have your b12 checked. When i was preg with my son, i was fainty, shaky, and nauceous. I thought pregnancy blah blah, it never went away. I have to have a b12 tablet or you get injections.
uh you are definetly eating for 2 or 3, what you eat is going to go to the babies first, not you so you need to eat enough for the babies and then enough for you.
well you are eating for two more people, cause babies take your vitamins, minerals and everything from you. That's why some women experience hair loss and other stuff bcs of deficiency of something... Also my hands shake too if I'm hungry and that is because blood sugar is low....
it’s because you need more nutrients. you’re not eating nutrient dense foods so then your body thinks its still hungry
Me and my twin were sea section babies bc I got like a 2 on the test thingy so I ended up being born 9 around weeks early
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤍🤎🖤 i love that flynn is unknowingly choose the rainbow colored tea pot set to support pride month!
I love the pic of you and Ari
my mom had 4 sea sections too lol
Yea, so let’s just for get about the soldiers on Memorial Day and celebrated the LGBTQ+ when she wasn’t even in June yet😐🇺🇸
hey sunshine! ppl rag on Pride merch bc large businesses only carry it NOW bc they make big $ off of it. they wouldnt "support the community" until it proved to be profitable to them. So that's why u see that talk. pride and acceptance came first bc of activism. 💜 FYI my comment isn't necessarily my opinion, just answering the question. Luv uuuuu!! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
The arm workout that is making puppy chow is unmatched 😂
you could do one of those organizing my fridge videos! From what I've heard, it makes all the food in your fridge seem much more appetizing.
“Through my hole.” 😂😂
My close friend carried her twins till 38 weeks and delivered naturally
Totally relate on the not being able to breathe! My second trimester was so bad with that!
Colleen, eat more protein!  It really helps the constant eating and shaking.
You should do Delilah and pearl!
I was only here for tea time 💅🏼
We'll  I have a twin and hor name  is abbey and  she has type 1 diabetes
You need to eat the way you feel and not feel bad about it, like you said you are growing two little humans.  Enjoy your beautiful pregnancy journey.
Colleen: Ron and John  My mind: Ronald and Johnald
PLEASE BE TRIPLETSSS
Eat healthy food please!!!!!!
The shaking is probs low blood sugar, should get that checked out - i get it loads
Baby name suggestions: Boy and Boy: Noah and Ollie Girl and Boy: Luca (boy or girl) and Alicia Girl and Girl: Laila and Ruben  I love your channel/family! They are all so perfect! <3  I hope the cases of corona are going down in USA. Well done for being so safe and staying strong with this pregnancy! We all support you and dont listen to the haters! Stay strong!  <3 <3
I'll just list names. Samuel. Sawyer. Sailor, Jamie, Cayden, Cayde, Drew, Koda, Alyssa, Malia, Bobby, Charlie.
I'm so proud of your mindset this time around during your pregnancy. I remember how you described how tough all the body changes were for you when you were pregnant with Flynn and I'm so glad you recognize that reasonable weight changes are not physically important when you're pregnant. I'm not a mom but with my eating disorders I've experienced feeling extremely mentally and physically sick, and still prioritizing weight loss. They're definitely not the same, but you're work on self acceptance through a difficult time inspires me:) love you
I just realized I eat like I’m pregnant all the time
I would highly recommend checking your blood sugar when you get shaky like that. That happened to me when pregnant and I was having low blood sugar!
I've eaten so much food - lists a tiny amount of food for an entire morning.... hmmmm.
I had symphysis pubis dysfunction with all of my pregnancies, and holy wow, people do not understand the pain of simply laying down with your knees touching, or getting in and out of a car
Dude in my first trimester I was always hungry and my appetite was so much bigger 😅
Ron and John im crying hahahaha please name them that. Love you Colleen❤️❤️❤️
Can't wait to see Francesca and Tweed
this woman can make anything from sratch
🎶Colleen’s Corner🎶
Happy Pride Month everyone! Be proud of who you are!
My name's Francesca and I'm a Fraternal twin, so when you said my name while talking about options for your twins' names, I was really shocked 😅
omg please get the psychic come see the future of the twins like she did flynn!!
I didn’t have a chance on c section but with me I healed in one week
10/10 loved your little pride song
i just said it😒  I LOVE FLYNN HAHSHAHA
Colleen you Are SO AMAZING!!!!!
Lol why is everyone assuming the twins are both boys😂 do they forget there’s more than one gender lmao🤣
Colleen is such an amazing mom 🥰
“Oh I spilled it” 🤣🤣🤣 too cute I loved that lil family moment. 💛
We need updates on the bump. Bumpdates.
if you have a boy and a girl can i recommend (and im sure this is the first time your hearing this...) Patrick and Miranda ... you're welcome?
when is the gender reveal ??????????
If I have kids I will refuse to teach them kiddy songs is that just me 😂😂
When flyn said “i just said it.” I died 💀
I’d like to know how Maranda feels about being pregnant with twins... lol🤔
Honestly youre not eating just for you or the babies its also your hormones your body knows there is something different and you are growing and changing so it makes you hungry
oh  colleen , having triplets is a blessing but a painful process for me personally,
You might be extra hungry, since you've mentioned before that you're typically underweight-your body is trying to make sure you're as healthy as possible for the pregnancy, which means that you not only need to gain the "typical" pregnancy weight, but you also need to gain enough weight to reach a healthy general weight.  That might be why your body is telling you that you're extra hungry right now.
It’s not so much that they’re uncle it’s that those giant companies are trying to capitalize off of people that they also hurt and are not supportive of when it’s not pride month
I'm a twin and my name is Chloe and my sister is Callie :P Before we were adopted, our names were Mackenzie and Brittney LOL
I LITERALLY SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THE THUMBNAIL!!!!
y’all really living in flynn’s world 🤣❤️
About the pride clothes, a lot of the shops are only putting out these collections as a form of performative activism. A lot of people are saying that they would prefer large companies to donate to LGBTQ+ charities and actually help make a difference rather than just sticking rainbows on everything (especially as the clothes are laughable!!)
Me and my twin have names that sound the good together  but they don't rhyme
the names could be if they where girls both Evie and Lola x
Im so happy u support lgbtq🏳️‍🌈🥺💕
POV you didn’t even know she was prego
If you had a boy and a girl. Braylen and Jaden would be so cute!!!
It looks like there are 4 babies in there😳
That 70lbs was all belly, them haters be hatin hard girl!! Ignore them boo!!!!
Flynn's favorite word is dar dar
Gain whatever you want Colleen! Eat whatever you want. You’re already doing amazing! ❤️Ugh it annoys me so much when people play pregnancy down! It’s tough man.
Collleeeeennnnnnnnnn pls find this make ALL of your kids watch the scholastic video collection it WAS my childhood and it was wonderful I could not recommend it more!
Omg Flynn singing so cute
I got my blood results back in a week I was surprised how quick it was plus its another boy
Coffee ? … NOOO lmfao
“Ice cream.. I just said it...” HAHAHA
lowkey wanted to stop watching when she kept singing "Pride month"
Eat more protein
I love it huhu o I spilled it!
Mariah and joey
TRIPLETS?! Omg congratulations
I love flynn singing
you win for cutest baby
The judgement about gaining weight in pregnancy is ridiculous! I had a doctor tell me that if you factor in the baby and your waters, you shouldn't gain more than 12lbs 😱 Like, what?! They had the cheek to tell me that anything above that is just me putting on weight/ getting fatter! They were super rude to me my whole pregnancy because I'm over weight, they even made me restrict my diet so bad that I lost weight 🙄
When i was pregnant with my daughter, my biggest craving was cold melon!!! I swear at least one baby in there is a girl!! All the same symptoms i had with the nausea and everything...
Yes!! Validation for each momma out there!!Every pregnancy is different! Love you!!
name ideas : Girl/girl : Josie and Lizzie  boy/boy: Fred and George  boy/girl: Megan and Oliver
I got an In The Heights commercial on your vlog
My mum didn’t know she was having twins until the 20 week scan (the last scan)
If you gained 70 pounds and went back to your normal weight that quickly, how is that bad? Your body clearly need it...
I LOVE pride month!!!!!!!!!!
colleen you should do a morning routine when you give birth
I’m almost 22 weeks with my twins and my appetite is all over the place. Some weeks I barely eat at all, other weeks I eat CONSTANTLY and never feel full. Forget the haters love, do what you need to do to take care of you and your sweet babies. You got this!
What is this thing about colleen not eating for two, she literally is tho. All nutrients from her food directly goes to the growth of the babies. That’s what the umbilical cord is for. That’s why pregnant women need to have a specific diet cause whatever they eat or do directly affects the babies. Colleen is incredible for growing these two babies in her uterus and working full time. And if she has to eat more because she’s constantly hungry she is valid because she is growing two babies inside of herself.
My heart, hearing Flynn singing my little teapot stole my heart. You two are such amazing parents!!
I know some twins that are called Lennox and towns the girls Linux and the boys towns
“FRENCHESKA AND TWEED!”😂🤣
If they are both girls you could do haper and piper
coming from a twin, maybe stay with your gut decision and don't do rhyming or same first letters for the names! it can already be a huge identity issue growing up as a twin because people are constantly lumping the two together and i am SO glad my parents didn't do a theme for our names (my name is chelsea, twin's name is luke) <3
Colleen saying she eats that much, (my mom coming down stairs and me literally eating the fridge)
Because you now have a bigger stomach! Duuuuh
I JUST SAID IT 😂
Please tell me I’m not the only one who thought Colleen was talking about actual dog food when she said she was craving puppy chow! 🤣
Pet co has pride clothes for dogs and cats
Yep 4 C-sections because my pelvic bones are deformed. So it saved my life and all my kids were healthy and are amazingly cool people at 32, 29, 21, 14.  Don't let anybody tell you how to do ANYTHING. You do you, Boo. ❤👏❤👏❤👏❤👏❤  PS. I will NEVER celebrate clowns.
You just keep doing what you feel works for you. Keep listening to your body. Get plenty of rest, try to eat well (it's ok to eat the fun stuff too) and enjoy your life.
I’m so excited to find out the genders! 😊
I have great names for girls is lexi and alexis
Hi! Just wanted to share a little bit of my understanding of why people are upset about big box stores selling pride materials- I think it is less about the look of the pride lines and more about supporting smaller businesses who directly support LGBTQ+ people. People are saying to promote/purchase from people who are part of the community rather than supporting somewhere like Walmart, who is in it a lot for profit, rather than actually supporting LGBTQ+ people.
I have friends and they are twin and their names are Reagan and Peyton so they sound good together but aren’t matching
One of each!!!! Boy/girl twins  It will be her last pregnancy   One of them will end up fixing themselves afterwards  Type your guesses below!!!!!
Colleen, get your levels checked. Could be gestational diabetes... if it happens with one baby it could happen with every baby
Thank you for mentioning the Pride clothes but I do think that while we should not bash companies for trying to be inclusive. We should also hold them accountable in not just using PRIDE or the LGBTQIA+ community to seem "woke" or only for the benefit of their image.
I've never given birth and can't now. I did miscarry once. But something I've never understood is why women get so obsessed over how they give birth and over breast feeding. I agree with you. However the baby needs to come out safely and as long as your feeding your baby why is 1 way less than the other. Obviously 1 is preferred over the other but it shouldn't be looked at as less than.
Colleen: unsubscribe to me right now     Me: :’)
I GET SICK WHEN PEOPLE JUDGE PREGNANT LADIES FOR GAINING WEIGHT. Like are you okay?!?????? Is totally normal and acceptable and pregnant women shouldn’t be self conscious about their bodies when they are literally DOING SMTHING AMAZING. Like I couldn’t just get in my mind that it actually was a thing. If I am constantly hungry I can’t imagine having to feed 2 babiesss
11:15  the office in the background
Look Human has a ton of LGBTQA+ stuff they are more like normal tees but with cute sayings and memes on them. They also have a ton of cute enamel pins and masks (if you are still masking)
Now he needs to have a full tea party where all his cars are present
9:10. You're welcome.
My twin sister and I are Anahí and Sarahí 😊😊😊
“but clouds kinda scare me” omg i’m dead 🤣🤣🤣
Just @-ing Rachel right now about the clothes!!! Lol!!
I was pregnant with twins and My doctor NEVER once said I was overweight or I gained too much/too little. One of the first things I asked was “how much should I gain?” He said he’d never tell a woman how much every single pregnancy is different. I never felt bad I trusted my body and gained 30lbs total. Lost it all as soon as the babies were born. It was an amazing pregnancy.
I gained 10 lbs. Buuut. I was overweight and was losing weight. My weight didnt change after the first trimester but I got bigger. Like my stomach grew. I was just losing weight at the same time.
Talk about all the time if you want. I love it
Aw colleen singing about loving the LGBTQ+ comunity was so cute💜 We love you too girl!🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Okay I can't watch Flynn get a new toy each day - anyone else think this is a bit excessive ? Love Coleen but jeeze man this is wasteful
My sister in law pushed my nephew for 3 hours before they said nvm and gave her a C section. Yes his head was huge lol
The answer is no she's not having triplets ur welcome. 9:50
Early
Thank u for that LGBTQ song- I’m bi btw
do a gendr rvell
Omg I am soo jealous that you're able to eat with your pregnancy! I felt so sick with my last I couldn't enjoy my usual foods/snacks ;-; Enjoy it all, girl!
You are eating for two (three for you) because the food you eat supplements the babies 🙄 they take the food first it seems
My mom had 4 of us. 2 sets of identical twins. 2 boys and 2 girls. She didn’t want matching names for us because she wanted us to be individual and not be referred to as the quads or look at them they are so alike. She rarely ever dressed us the same. I appreciate my mom for that.
When Flynn was singing I’m a Little Teapot the captions said [Musik] 😂 He is really adorable though 🥺
Flynn is so cuuuuute!!!!
Hi Colleen, you should name your twins with a theme. For example, autumn and Summer for girls. I personally think this a cute idea. :)
omg i used to sing at cast party when I lived in the city! Love that that's where you started! <3
please do not pick Sam & Ella for twin names 😂
Why do you apologize or feel bad for talking about your pregnancy. Like that’s actually interesting please talk about it if you want😆 i guess i understand some people cant get pregnant and you want to be considerate but i really like to hear abt your pregnancy and im sure a lot other ppl agree
When are the twins due?
I was the same. I had to eat at least every hour and the hunger was PAINFUL. If i did not eat I would be insanely nauseous. This is my third pregnancy and I did not feel this way with my first two. I gained 10lbs my first trimester. Thankfully as soon as i started my second trimester it all went away. I am pregnant with only one baby btw.
All ends like Nicholas and Christian?
One reason you are hungry so much is because the babies are taking and absorbing the most nutrients and energy from your body. To sustain it you are hungry more. Especially with multiple births. You are not alone. Hugs!
What have I missed. She’s pregnant-
I'm vlogging, its boring, IM COLLEEN! Its so cute!
COLLEEN  you have to try putting mint and lime juice with your watermelon, you will feel like the bojjieist bish, unless that makes you nushish then please don't do that.
I'm sorry....did you just say "through my hole"? 😳........ 🤣
Im so happy shes pregnent again :)
I gained 4stone when I was pregnant I was always hungry and always tired hahaha. God nose how my son Arthur was only 7lbs 2oz xxx
About food, I think if you're pregnant, just do whatever your body wants you to do. So I honestly understand you 😭
Weight shaming is out of control in our society. I had such bad nausea during my pregnancy that I LOST 30 pounds and there were idiots actually complimenting and congratulating me, meanwhile I’m deathly afraid my baby isn’t getting enough nutrients and my OB was constantly monitoring the situation. People just need to leave it alone and practice some kindness.
Is vjune again
The foods you listed maybe adds up to 400 calories lol no wonder why you’re still hungry
When is the next episode of Haters back off coming ?  i really loved Haters back off☹️
You gained 70lbs? I would have never guessed because I think you looked amazing! As long as mama and baby are healthy I think that is all that matters. If anyone says anything else they can SUCK IT! lol
You’ve got low blood sugar. That is why you are shaky feeling. Try eating less sugar and more whole grains and protein.
Litterly love you so much!!
I agree with you about the pride collections. I think most people are saying that they are pandering and selling to us rather than trying to be inclusive. I think there could be some truth in that but I do think it’s also a tad cynical. No matter what the intentions, I think it’s important to realize that it is having positive effects in people feeling seen.
Also why is Flynn actually good at singing already 😭🖤 So cute
If the twins are both girls or one girl one boy you could name them Taylor and Madison.
Colleen if you’re getting shaky when you’re hungry you should talk to your doctor, you may need to keep an eye on your blood sugar!
Doo Doo fluid
all the pride lines are mainly big companies trying to market off of pride month so their intentions arent good and thats why people are making fun of how they just throw a rainbow on anything just to make more money
Since I am pregnant I have speak with a nutrioniste and she said you could feel like you are eating more but if you are just eating smaller portion through out the day that fine especially if you have nausea
I love the name Riley idk it feels like it matches for your vibe????? Idk I’m not very good at baby’s names it’s just literally the first name that came to mind when you announced you were pregnant
You eat as much as you want you Pregnant Queen!!!!!!!
I am a twin and our names are Sabrina and casey. They don't match but it goes together smooth
Now I'm no doctor. But in the sims when you eat watermelon it means you're gonna have a girl 👀...
My mom had a c-section with my twin brother and I. In her experience, she said that it was fine after the shot in her back. She said that the shot in the back was probably the worst pain she had ever felt lol. Recovery wise.... she was ok, said it was pretty normal.
I have twins, and let me tell you! I ate sooo much food I was always starving. Lol My boys were born super healthy and my weight stayed healthy. Listen to your body!!
Did she already post Flynn’s reaction to her getting pregnant yet ? If she did, can someone please comment the link
Miranda is gonna be so mad.. she gonna die out of anger when she founds out she's pregnant
Being a gay man It literally makes me SO proud that our Queen uses her platform to support us 😭🌈  .... THANKYOU!!!!
I'm LGBTQ+! I'm a transgender man. Also I'm 7 weeks pregnant!
I know with the nausea your tolerance for certain foods is limited, but please find healthy fats and protein that you can tolerate. Be careful with too much sugar (and simple carbs), your blood sugar is rising and dropping quickly. Even when not pregnant that causes shakiness and nausea. It’s a vicious cycle when you’re pregnant, I know! Also, take care of your teeth! With the jolly ranchers and the experience you had with Flynn, you wanna keep your teeth strong! Are you getting your regular checkups, missy?! 😝 I say all of this with love and compassion, zero judgement. 🥰
I feel like it's two girls but its probably going to be two boy!!😁😄
I've barely started watching but wanted to comment about the whole weight gain during pregnancy being bad thing. Because generally I agree that every pregnancy is different, but the bigger you are, the more folic acid you need for it to work in preventing things like Spina Bifida in your baby. So like for me I'm a little on the larger side, so would need a stronger dose of folic acid. And because I did have a baby with severe spina bifida, I now take it all the time, so that if I have an unexpected pregnancy or anything, I'm already covered and the baby should be safe. There are probably other reasons they're so anal about weight gain, but that's one of them.
Flynn being sassy pants is just my favorite.
BAHAHHA FRANCHESCA AND TWEED STOCKLIN
So how will Miranda take to having two more babies?!
Hi Colleen, with you saying about feeling shaky have you had your blood sugars tested? It actually sounds like hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) Sending love ❤️
We call puppy chow muddy buddy's where i live
I have some name ideas that i think would be cute! (im so excited for you btw!!) girls; Elowen(Ellie for short), Ryhia(Ry for short), Narcasia. Boy; Locke, Vincent, Caspian. gender neutral names; Atlas, Aris(pronounced AIR- S), James(just because I've always liked the name James), Dean:))
With the watermelon hack put some in the freezer and use as ice in a glass of Sprite
Just imagine wat if It’s a boy and a girl and she calls them Romeo and Julia
I am so proud of Colleen and Flynn FYI also Eric but i barely hear of him.Colleen is going to be a mother of three.and Flynn talks and sings so much.so proud🍟😊🙃😁🤩🤩🤩🤩
the thing with the clothing lines is that people are annoyed because it gives brands an excuse to pretend to support a community for a short time, without actually doing anything concrete for it. there are tons of people who are WAY more eloquent than me on the topic . i definitely recommend anyone who wants to to do their own research to go for it because i definitely didn’t do it any justice. the most common term i’ve heard is “rainbow-washing”.
i think the issue of the pride sections isn’t that they exist but rather the companies profiting off of pride don’t support the lgbtq+ community during the rest of the year. it is really cool that they exist but it would be cooler if those companies actually did something good for the community with that money rather than just profiting off of them
I literally could not agree with you more on the topic of the prude clothes sections of stores. As a lgbtqia+ person it’s absolutely amazing to see any sort of representation and support. I love it and I actually love a good majority of all the price clothes I’ve seen because I absolutely love rainbows and I love showing support always🥰🌈❤️
Your blood sugar is low.
My mom and aunt are identical twins and my abuela thought it would be a brilliant idea to give them the same first name 🙃 they have different middle names, so they generally go by their middle names but it has caused a lot of confusion for them both especially considering documents, mail, and things. So yeah don’t name your identical twins the same first name lol
WAIT SHE HAVING TRIPLETS KNOW ONE NOTICED
hey i was looking at you tasting boba tea and you should tast brown suger milk tea
I have a question   Are you going to record the birth
my friend gained 110-120lbs through pregnancy girl who cares you will always be judged you eat what you want! As long as you and the babies are healthy we’re here to support you
I love how open and excepting you are of everything pregnancy related. It's awesome to see and watch here on yt.
her: lay with me me: *lays down*
i know youre not having triplets but I had a dream last night that you were so I DONT KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE COLLEEN
rainbow capitalism isn't it. selling pride merch that was made in countries where it's illegal to be gay isn't supporting the community, it's marketing to us to make a quick buck. buy pride stuff from small LGBTQ+ organizations, not from corporations!
“Oh oh, I spilled it!” 🤣
Miranda staring at all of us in the corner while she answers questions lol
I gained exactly what they told me to gain by no actual intention and they told me I needed to gain MORE like wtf they are so confusing silly drs do you boo eat eat eat
colleen is turning into that fish nest in nemo little by little
I feel like Colleen is going to have a girl and a boy because she likes eating sweet and sour stuff
I will never watch another one of your videos after this.
Hdjsjjshjs damnnnn
I realize this is probably the last thing on your mind but maybe when you’re feeling better or after the twins are born you should do a part 2 of the Mama Doctor Jones collab!!
Ultrasound tech here! Each baby in the first trimester is attached to what’s called a Yolk Sac. It kinda looks like a circle/halo. A lot of people, who are not familiar with ultrasounds, can mistake it for another baby. The photo you have (the one that’s in the thumbnail) shows baby A without the YS (because of the angle of the camera) and baby B WITH the yolk sac! Congrats Colleen!!
i think its gonna be a girl and a boy or girl and a girl
Imagine colleen having identical twins and flynn getting confused about which twin is which
I am a twin and it was best for my mom to have the c section
Maddy and Mya!??
So I had a customer tell me once the nyakers ginger snaps you can get from cost plus world market were GREAT for her morning sickness and that it was the only thing that worked for her.
Flin is so adorable!!
Mom of  4
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
the thing about pride clothing in target is that they do it for profit rather than actually support,, or at least that’s the argument, but i’m not sure!
You going to be amazing mum to all 3 of your children 🥰
i am pansexual and non binary and i'm proud
My first 3 kids were vaginal, then last was emergency c section.  My advice, a c section is not bad, but the trauma and fear of an emergency c section is terrible.  If I knew I was at risk of a possible c section, I would rather plan it in advance than go through the trauma and physical risks of an emergency.  Obviously do what you feel is best, just giving you my experience to help in any way I can.
the intro gets me every time
just a quick take about targets pride collection from a lesbian:  the reason people are making fun of it is because of rainbow capitalism. basically for one month out of the year companies will be all about equality and pride but will just use it as leeway to make more money. plus, most brands don’t donate the money they make from their pride collections to any sort of lgbtq organizations, they just use the oppression of the lgbtq community to profit off of them forget about it the next month
OMG I can’t believe that when this video was posted Colleen will have a gender reveal party!!!
my personal issue with corporations selling all these pride products during the month of june is that i feel like my identity is being capitalized on. its socially responsible of businesses to give a shit about LGBTQ+ people now because being queer is more acceptable than it was 20 years ago- they see it as an opportunity for money and a good reputation. the purpose of a business is to make a profit- they dont actually care about us :/
Same! I’m only pregnant with one and I get super shaky if I don’t eat more than I want to lol.💜🎀💜
You get comments about how much you eat no matter what🙄 I've gained 20lbs so far in my pregnancy, currently 38 weeks. I get people telling me to eat more, eat fattier, ask if I'm purposefully not eating or if I'm dieting..... I have definitely increased what I eat this pregnancy (I was insanely hungry in the 2nd trimester), I'm not exercising besides yoga, and I do not worry or watch my weight.....I can't control that I haven't gained that much yet people still have a problem
So you’re not ok with assigned genders yet you’re looking at “girl” names and “boy” names?
Flynn is so adorable
Flynn is literally sooo cute! You can tell he is going to grow up to be an amazing person! 😊
Where did you get Flynn's Hot Air Balloon PJs? My little boy NEEDS them!
I love hearing flynn voice a little tea pot an singing it. C section might be easier. Yes they are 2babies
Its total bs the 30lbs minimum for pregnancy. If your stomach is growling because the babies are hungry then eat. Every pregnant woman is different. As long as mother and baby or babies are healthy just monitor the pregnancy. The weight gain most likely will be lost if the mom breastfeeds.
Thank you soooooo much for giving your babies their own unique names rather than rhyming. As an identical twin, I always appreciated the individuality my parents gave my sister and I. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I know you will be an amazing mom to your little babies!!!!!!!! 🥰❤️
Wait you are pregnant with triplets omg yay I hope they are healthy
What about rose and Ryan aaaaaw that would be so cute  ...rose is my dream name lol-🏳️‍⚧️
If they were two boys boe and Jacob 🤪😘
Flynn is so adorable 🥰 I CANT his little laugh makes me have hope for humanity
Phoebe and phoebo🤣🤣🤣🤣
Phoebe and phoebo🤣🤣🤣🤣
You are eating for 3. You are growing 2 extra bodies! All the nutrients are being SUCKED out of you and funneled to the babies to grow them! Therefore you need to eat  ridiculous amount and make sure you are getting enough vitamins minerals and especially folate. It's just how it works people!
The way Flynn puts the things from the box on the ground so perfectly, like not throwing them is just so sweet🥺💙
Hey Colleen idk if your seeing this but I saw this thing that said if you are nauseous, smell rubbing alcohol and if you are gagging, hum and it will go away. Hopefully this helps! Just to let you know I’m gonna put this on every video until you have these babies 😂unless I forget🤣🤣
On this part, she sounds like Maxine on Ginny and Georgia, it's very funny pls, I love it videos Colleen, I watch u from Argentina 🤍🇦🇷🤩
are you Maranda?
Please don't take me wrong but from what I have seen your eating habits are boardering on disordeded eating, I'm not saying you have an eating disorder. But I feel you could use the help of your Dr to adjust you eating habits while pregnant.
Name ideas Girl-Addison-Addisyn!(⬅️my name)Boy-Aiden!(⬅️my brothers name)
Flynn singing is literally the cutest!!! 😭😭😭
If they are girls Chloe and Zoe
you need more protein in your diet, it will help with the shaking. I was shaky and fainting in my 1st trimester and my OB said I wasn't getting enough energy from food. Just my 2 cents. ♥ you guys!
First trimester is sooo hard! With my son all I could stomach was apple sauce, and sometimes bananas. Whatever she can get down is better then nothing!
micheal and matthew for two boys definitely
I sometimes get carsick (just nauseous) on long car trips and my go-to foods when I can't stomach anything else are watermelon and for some reason, fried chicken.
Pregnancy takes up SO MUCH ENERGY. As much as an endurance athlete, and I'm not exaggerating. Just eat when you're hungry and listen to your body. Anything else is fatphobia imho. (I'm a doula)  Also!   If you have nothing better to do than to shame a woman pregnant with twins from behind your computer screen, find a hobby?
I swear y'all are just the cutest family I can't 🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
@ColleenVlogs what happened to miranda sings?
UH OH I SPILLED IT
Wow
I can’t believe how sweet Eric is I love it so much he should be featured more on the channel!
You have to make Flynn into a TikTok like ...when your toddler gets sassy during tea time or something idk but I watched that so many times.
but colleen.. you do realize that all those stores that put out pride clothes are also just trying to capitalize off of the community right...
Can't wait to meet the new babies: Francesca, Tweed, and Frank Matroll!
Re: pride clothes. I think Target has done a good job in diversifying their models and providing clothing for different bodies, so I am more willing to give them the benefit of the doubt about their intentions with pride clothes. As for wal-mart and amazon, I’m pretty skeptical. I think it’s them trying to make a profit more than them supporting the LGBTQIA+ community. Though I think your right about the impact it could have on someone who is not yet out. I think a cool way to support the LGBTQIA+ community would be to find people of that community who are creating pride wear and buy from them!
C-section saved my daughter's life because she had a stroke before her birth.
Hi Colleen!  I've been watching your videos for a couple of years now and they have helped me so much. You made me not feel alone in this weird time with how honest you were.  I’m currently a first-year biomedical/ nursing-midwifery student in Australia and from my understanding so far is that when expecting twins you should try to eat 380 extra calories in your first semester, 680 in your second semester and 900 extra calories in your third.   Your diet should be well balanced (this doesn't mean you can't have treats) consisting of 20-25% protein (adding 50g more protein to your non-pregnancy needs ensuring proper development of both babies muscles), 45-50% carbs and 30% fats. But most importantly, listen to your body. If your body is telling you to eat, you need it, whether it’s your mental health or physical health. You know what’s best for you!  Sending all my love and wishing you all the best xx
What about the names Abbi and Emma for two girls those are my cousins name and they are twins they do not look alike though on has freckles and short curly hair and the other one has no freckles and strait long hair though are just some ideas and I am a twin also :)
Ohh my gosh my name is Francesca you should so name one of your kids that if it’s a girl!!! And my birthday is December 22 so that would be kind of cool 😎
When are you posting Flynn’s reaction to you being pregnant? 😊
Girrrrrl!!! You are growing TWO babies!!! I was the same way with my twins! Until the end when I couldn’t fit very much cause they took up all the room in my abdomen 😫
About the pride merchandise, I completely agree with your statement about it being a valid progression, but where I live (Israel) pride merchandise (especially those sold in pride parades) are so overpriced and unaffordable to the point that it feels like a capitalist scam tbh 👍🏻✌🏻
The jitters and always feeling hungry...it might be what you are eating. Maybe it's time to make a lifestyle shift and make a point to eat cleaner, whole foods.
Eating more protein will help with the shakiness.
I think of your twins as a gift from God giving you two baby's instead of one for what happened with your miscarriage
It’s called rainbow capitalism, pink washing, or homocapitalism... look it up...
Are you going to have a psychic come over this pregnancy?
Hello 👋 please please do a dog day
Why is the whole vlog her compailing about being pregnant like some people can’t have a baby and ever few seconds she complains about her simtons
C section saved my baby and me ❤️ thank you for talking about it. I always felt like I had part of my birthing experience taken. Of course I’m happy with the outcome but it just makes me emotional!
I love it when she is like DANG IT! Lol it was so funny I love you Colleen 💖
Colleen: I would never choose Jack in the box Colleen a couple years ago: makes a Miranda song for Jack in the box haha
What you said about pride clothes 💯
Please have Terry the psychic come back to talk about these babies!!!
Please go to smellybellytv and go give them some prayers and good comments, there going thew a really rough time♥️
I totally agree about the pride clothes! Like yeah, they aren't all cute but at least they exist!
Colleen was like I see people hating on pride clothes (one of those people is her sister 😂)
Try pickles and  whip cream together
For naming the twins you could do an “A” and “B” name (for baby a and baby b) that’s what we’re doing for our twin boys! Aydin and Beck’em💙💙
Colleen has a point, they are trying. (14:20) but at the same time. They only try this month. They use pride as an investment for money. If they were trying to be true allies they would try and put effort more then one month a year. It’s great that we got this far, but we still have a ways to go.
add protein to your diet even if its a shake.
It's good that pride clothes are everywhere, are they really supportive of the LGBTQIA+ community? Or are they just capitalizing on the fact that it's pride month? That's why the internet doesn't like Amazon and other big companies that DON'T support the cause by donating and supporting their workers. Capitalism ruins inclusivity since it's tied to wh*te s*premacy.
No one:  Colleen 2 weeks later:  so were having triplets
I love the hot air balloon pajamas
Flynn is so amazing 🥺
I’m not against being in the lgbtq+ community but I think it is weird how if your in the lgbtq+ you get a whole month but people who  fought in the civil war get one day.
So there are twins or triplets ?
I want to see a baby name ideas video!!
Actually, I think you are eating for three. It's not just about calories, it's also about all of the essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals and so on. You might need to eat extra much to get all of those for you and your babies <3
Love the bangs!! So cute!
When my mom was pregnant with me she couldn’t stop eating steak and cheese subs and anything that involved sugar. Now I have a sugar problem lol
When you find an actually wholesome family channel:
M3 and my twin names are maggie and emily don't do similar names people will mix them up even more
If they are both girls
Stop it!!! Flynn singing 😍
You should name the twins Katharine and Sophia.
It's pride month. It's pride month. It's time to be proud of the LGBTQ+ community. If you're a part of the community, You. Are. Awesome. Shout it loud and proud. If you're not a part of the LGBTQ+ community, support them, don't be a clown. Unless you like clowns then be a clown, but clowns kinda scare me. So let's celebrate the LGBTQ+ people because we want equality.  It's a banger.
“Let’s try some eggs” 😂😂
I used to get shaky like that even before I got pregnant! I always attributed it to low blood sugar. My stomach could be full but I would still be jittery. Maybe you can choose foods with more fats and fewer sugars? I tend to feel jittery sooner if I choose foods and snacks that are just carbs (your list - bagels, pop tarts, grapes - doesn’t have much in the way of protein or fats.) If you can keep it down, maybe try yogurt or cheese or beef jerky? :)
i think for a girl it should be Giselle or Jacey
Omg I thought I had a pregnancy dream about this thumbnail because I didn't realize she has 2 YouTube channels!! I am relieved it's a real video haha
What the heck is “puppy chow”?
Imagine it keeps doubling and she ends up with like eight babies 🤣xxx
The Legally Blonde reference at the end <3
Girl EAT WHEN YOU NEED TO!! Also, I’m a preg mama too right now, pregnant with my third, and if you can get anything down that has protein in it (I can’t most of the time 😔) you might feel less shaky! That is not a fun feeling when you’re like hormonally hungry and feel weak and shaky!
You guys should try the kinder app for baby names. It’s like tinder for baby names. You swipe on the ones you like and it shows you which ones you agree on!
AHHH PUPPY CHOWWW!
Honestly you’re a very slender person so I think it’s totally normal that you need to eat all the time and that you’re gaining more weight than whatever is “usual”. Do whatever you need to feel good and grow your babies!
smoking wee amd watvhing some quality content
How many kids do you have now
Try changing what you eat. Eat more fulfilling foods and foods that give energy slowly.
Was anybody else very surprised when she said she was having twins I’m so excited for you to girl❤️
Cherry is the best jolly rancher flavor 🍒
Madison & Mason go together great.
I clicked faster than TikTok could say owa owa
Francesca and TWEED — DO IT lolol
If you keep carrots in a jar of water they last a good while because they are roots. I switch the water out like every 4 days or so. My daughter is a carrot fanatic
My favorite line “Eric just freaked out and bought a mini van” 😂
"Oh no, I spilled it!" loved it hahahaha
I had a c-section for my twins. Baby A was breech. The c-section and recovery was not as bad as I thought it was going to be.
Hey Colleen, the shakes could be a low blood sugar! Try taking in more protein and snack more frequently to help maintain your levels better!
I gained 70lbs in my first pregnancy, too, and I got SO much 'feedback' from my doctor about it. You're so right... every pregnancy is different and we can't rely on numbers alone! I'm not paying attention to weight at all during this pregnancy - just eating well, walking 10K steps a day, and keeping myself healthy. Weight is just a number!
you guys are such good parents I love it so much
oh I 've never seen anyone complain about the cuteness of the clothes, but more the fact that huge corporations like amazon and Walmart are just doing it for profit rather than changing their anti lgbtq+ policies etc, it would be really great it huge companies who sold pride stuff donated some of it or something like that
DID I NIT SAY ON THE TWIN GENDER GUESSING VLOG THAT "IT IS TWINS NOW BUT WAIT AND WATCH IT BE TRIPLETS" EEeeeeeeEEeEE If it ends up like that Ima scream because Im already soo happy for her and go around telling everyone and they dont know who you are lol-
i had a dream that the the twins were both girls
Make sure you’re getting enough protein if you are sick and shaky. It will help with nausea and being hungry all the time
When Flynn said lets try some eggs i was dying 😭💀
Your blood sugar might  be low. I get like that when mine is low
Triplet here! They didn’t find the third baby until almost 5 months because of our arrangement. Never say never.  Hope you feel better and you get to enjoy your pregnancy, no matter how many little ones have set up camp in your uterus. ❤️❤️❤️
If you are having 2 girl you should name them Lily and Abby
So cope and Hagen
is anyone else wondering what she’s gonna do about miranda being pregnant?
FLYNN SINGING THE INTRO IS SO CUTEE
I met twins named Liberty and Justice
it’s awesome to see representation HOWEVER amazon etc are purely making pride merch to capitalize on queer people (a notoriously impoverished group) i don’t have a problem with pride merch i have a problem with companies being “woke” during pride month but not caring about/ actively hurting queer communities during the rest of the year
i have sickle vomiting syndrome (chronic nausea and vomiting) and i found that eating sour candy when im having episodes is recently very helpful!
Flynn's imagination is great!
I am pregnant too and I can't eat a full meal.  So I eat little meals, pretty much a snack every 2 hours.  Just do whatever works for you. Flynn singing I'm a Little Teapot is the most adorable thing. I have 2 U shaped pregnancy pillows and love them.  I use them when I am not pregnant.  I have to buy another one for my son's bed because he loves them too.
I wanted watermelon the entire time I was pregnant with my girl. Sooo good
Ooo
Jolly Ranchers! Thanks for this seriously.... they have been helping me sooooo much with my nausea!
Puppy Chew- Muddy buddies
I'm a twin and it's pretty cool 😂and me and my sis were a C-section babys and our names are Sarah (me) and Farha lol idk why I wrote this
I've never watched you before, I mean I know how you are but I've never purposly went on your chanel.. I love these pregnancy videos 😍 Mind you, I'm 21 and have no plans having a baby in anytime soon hahah
I love the new intro! It’s sooo cute! Me and my younger sister has just been sat here replaying it bc we love it so much! 🥰 Also I can’t wait for the twins! I’m so excited and congratulations!! 🥰💗🎉
Flynn is so cute!!
C section babies aren’t born, just removed
If you have a high metabolic rate your body will let you know when it needs energy. Especially if you're growing two humans! Not to mention that constantly trying to cope with nausea etc will also take a toll on you.   Gf, you do you. If you're hungry, EAT <3 Everyone else can fk off ^_^ enjoy yo damn poptarts queen you EARNED THEM
I’m currently 16 weeks pregnant and the instant/constant hunger has been one of the biggest problems for me. I’ll be fine one minute and then the next feel sick/light headed/no energy so I completely understand what you were talking about at the beginning of the video. I’ve literally gone from eating one meal a day to eating constantly and, honestly, if that’s what my body thinks it needs to be able to function then so be it, pregnancy is hard enough without being hard on ourselves about things like this too. 👏🏻
I had the same problem with being jittery when I wasn't always eating while pregnant. My doctor had me eat 10g of protein every 2 hours and it completely stopped.
He is soooo smart!! He was born few months after my son! And my son has a major delay!! Wish I could get my son to even talk!! Need serious tips!!!
oml flynn is ADORABLEEE
If it's a girl Francesca or Olivia if it's a boy Alex or matt
Are the twins going to share a nursery?
me: see's the title  Also me: watching this now.
Colleen: There's no triplets. Everyone: Yes there is. Your just keeping it a funny secret. Colleen: gives birth to twins. Everyone: You're hiding the third one, to be funny. Colleen: No'a...Now stop. 60 years from now: Hello everyone. I am the third one.  Everyone: I told you so. Lots of beaming and laughter ensues.  The worlds greatest secret. 😎
Flynn looks so much like Erik these days!!
Anyone else want their own toy teapot set?
Thank you Colleen for being so cool
I'm wondering if her blood sugar is dropping and that's what's causing her to be shaky and hungry.
5:40
Francesca and Tweed... I mean... ok... we have some work to do😂
Man I want poptarts now
Colleen meeeeeee toooooo! When I was pregnant I had to eat all day just to keep from vomiting my brains out all day because I was hungry all day....yet didn't gain anything (was overweight so it was okay to not gain)....weird right I get it. So it is weird when people say you don't eat for two when I was eating for a small tribe or colony lol...I have NEVER spent so much money on food everrrrr. Saved so much money after giving birth lol...also I LOVE flynns pajamas. You are the best mom in so many ways. Can I just say I love how accepting you are of who your children could turn out to be... you explained about that in one of your previous videos. I just love your heart. Such a good loving momma
Try more protein and fiber. I did a lot of protein shakes with spinach when I was pregnant.
I feel like Jane and Alice are cute together and don’t match. I think I understand
I feel like if you have two girls you should name them after flowers
U call that snack puppychow🤭😦😯😲 ITS MUDDY BUDDIES!!!
Me and my sister have similar names   Kevin and Kelly, even though we’re not twins they’re still a good pair
I have freinds who are twins and their names are Brooklyn and Destiny and I love those names together personally
If people don't want pregnancy content or footage of pregnant colleen just answering our questions, then they can buzz off because that's ALL I WANT
Oh my God I agree with you on the Jolly ranchers yass queen
Flynn singing the intro is so cute!!!
My baby was a emergency c-section! Without c-sections neither of us would have made it 💛
are youre twins fraternal or identical? :)
How flynn automatically just goes "pshhh" as he pours the teapot 😭😭💗
I know I don’t know much but with your shaking maybe get checked for diabetes cause some people get it when there pregnant and when they have lows they get shaky and feel faint but again I don’t know
you should watch" rachelle and justins" videos, they went from 1-3 last year. they are amazing
Shaking could be low blood sugar levels, I had this lots in pregnancy. Try protein rich foods they helped me and it stopped the shakes too
Maybe you are hypoglycemic?
Rumors about triplets from the title me go's I called it I said I bet its twins and what about triplets when she announced it
Colleen that is sooo normal!!! My appetite grew dramatically!! I was just hungry all the time because your body is nourishing and using everything it has to give to this beautiful baby inside of you that needs nourishing. When you are creating a baby your body burns sooo much energy so nourish your body!!. Please do a video of buying some more maternity clothes!!😁😁 and testing pregnancy products
Can you Do a house toure PLSSS I RALLY WANNE SEE Flynnnsss ROOMMMMM
I came out yesterday. I'm telling my best friend this afternoon.
Let the woman eat 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Things like the LGBT+ song are why I follow you. 😂😂
If you like olives that’s what saved me with morning sickness. The salt helps with the nausea also. That’s a great idea with watermelon also
So cuteeee!!!!!❤
One of the bigger issues with companies doing things only for pride is that for the rest of the year many companies don't care and do nothing to support the lgbtq+ community. I think that's more of the reason why people are kind of upset. They are making clothing, changing their logos, and maybe trying to work with people in the community (oftentimes without paying an adequate amount, but that's a whole different issue) just to show outwardly that they care when in reality many of them are just doing the bare minimum to avoid backlash.  So yes the clothes and everything they are doing is a good start, and companies should continue to do that, but all year round. Everyone in our community deserves representation, equality, visibility, safety, etc all year round. Not just in one month when it works with their brand.
I love the LGBTQ+ song. I am also part of the LGBTQ community.
FLYNN SINGING IM A LITTLE TEA POT😭😭😭😭. I CANT WAIT FOR NEW BABIES😍😍😍😍😍
Happy pride month!!!! 🏳️‍🌈🌈
The little family tea party was ADORABLE but when Flynn started singing my heart melted !!!
Anybody else call “puppy chow” muddy buddies?
Hi :) You might need to have some protein to your meals, especially in the morning. In ADHD protein helps as well! What you mentioned had a lot of carbs in it which causes your blood sugar to go up quick & come down quick. That may be the cause of the shakiness/constant hunger :)
I nannied for twins named Owen and Oakley and I thought it was so cute 🥺
I told you watermelon is the trick darling..... IT IS EVERYTHING!!!!
Nice vlog
That’s the way we refer to the twins now until we know who they are 😂 Francesca and Tweed 🤣🤣🤣
I am watching this on the second of June 2021 lol
When Flynn said that he’s serving eggs in a teapot, IM DEAD 💀🤣.
when he started singing im a little tea pot my heart melted🥺
When you're in your first trimester you do need a huge caloric intake increase, especially with multiples because your body is adding the extra blood into your system for the babies and growing TWO EXTRA ORGANS TO KEEP THEM ALIVE. The only people who should be monitoring your food intake is you and your Dr.
I love you blogs colleen
I desperately want to have a tea partyyyyyy nowwwwww
We have a pride section in the front of kohl’s that I work at!!
#flynntro
For a girl ✨Rhyme✨ and for a boy ✨Story✨? Idk I’ve always loved those names
OH MAH GAWD if you like the cold watermelon you should definitely try freezing cubes of watermelon, when I feel nauseous its the perfect thing.
In the next vlog can you please give us a tutorial on how to make puppy chow!
Enjoy eating as much as you can ,when i had my twins ,by the time i got to the end of the second trimester i found i didnt have much room left to fit food in 🤣
Best part is the tea party 🥺🥺 so sweet.!!!
My twin and I are Brittany and Janaya ✌🏼
What is this roller coaster....  Miscarriage Baby Miscarriage  Twins ?triplets? (Not really tho)
Today’s my birthday!🥳
My sister and I are twins and our names our Imogen and Olivia
Love your vids!  I just wanted to say that the pride clothes that most people roast are because pride collections make hundreds of thousands of dollars for a company and yet no money is donated to the lgbtqia+ community
HAPPY PRIDE!! 🌈
I have an idea For girl names; Cassandra and Jessica For boys; Jordan and River For boy and girl; Luca and Josie
Can I Suggest two girl names ok Delaney and Alana that would be awesome
Still no captions, this time you can only get German ones! What's going on? Is this intentional?
Eat what you need.  No shame in that.  😊 As someone who doesn’t get hungry much but does get shaky at times....foods higher in fats and proteins helps me.  And something else that helps me is avoiding higher glycemic index foods.   Whether one is growing a baby or babies or not....no shaming in eating what ur body needs but even more so when someone is pregnant; Your body is doing a lot to provide for a growing baby and in your case twins.
Same, always always hungry and if I don’t eat, probably super nauseous too, so… normal lol. I just gain a lot of weight pregnant
The representation is good..but the fact that they are making it to make a quick buck because they think it will see, their only motivation...isn't.
Not it being my first pride month sense realizing I'm pansexual and crying cause people are so nice and supportive and me being hyped✌🏻🥰
6:32 hello, lay with me 🤣🤣
the problem I have with pride clothes by big companies, even though you said they're trying, they really aren't. they're pandering and trying to profit off the LGBT while putting in no effort whatsoever. they're putting rainbows on t shirts and saying "gay"
you are so inspiering and amazing keep up the good work love u
Absolutely agree! LGBTQ+ treatment was far, far worse when we were in high school, and it wasn't all THAT long ago. It's really cool seeing more and more acceptance through the years. It's certainly not perfect, and likely never will be, but I'm glad it's steadily improving. Many of us didn't get to experience it growing up, but it's comforting knowing progress is being made for the younger generation.
I’m a 90 pound girl. And when I’m pregnant, which I am now, I gain 42 pounds( almost half my weight) after a few months of nursing, the weight comes off like magic!    I believe thin woman tend to gain more and that’s super natural!!
I think the twins should be named mason and Jace if they are both boys
What is this puppy chow?! I need a recipe, please!!
It's word that Google says pride month is October ???
Flynn is so cute also   Colleen: Yummy tea Flynn:Juice eggs
Flynn can carry a tune :)
The captions... R in... German...
Just by the title I feel like you are having triplets not twins it's kinda suspicious that you post a video that you are going to have twins then you do another video but it's about triplets
I know what name we put for the baby’s Sandy Wendy Lucy
Meanwhile, Rachel made the video insulting all the clothes 😂😂
If it’s 2 boys, call them Rick and morty🥺😍
If they are girls u should name them Rose and Bella
So glad I unsubscribed. It’s babies this and babies that, it’s so flaming boring 🙁
The main reason why you're hungry all the time but you're eating all the time. Is cause you're noting eating much to sustain you throughout the day. Cause the babies are going to take every bit of protein you put in your body and there is none left for you. Just keep eating what are eating just more
Shaking like this is a symptom of hypoglycemia.
Hiiii I'm bisexual and my parents don't like it but I don't caree~~~~~
Lay with me?! 🤣🤣🤣 I almost unsubscribed that time.
The reason people are a kind of mad at the stores is because of "rainbow capitalisem" aka the stores just want to profit of of lgbtqia+ people with minium effort. A lot of them scream "A cis straight person made this" which is just a little weird. But the stores that actually donate to organazations or have acual people from the community involved in the process of making it are definitly awsome!
My doctor told me with my twins to eat as much I could to gain 24 pound by 24 weeks because after that there is no room and your stomach is squished!
u guysssssss shes having a boy and a girl i feel like cuz shes craving sweet and sour!!!! im just assuming btw
COLLEEN I KNOW YOU MIGHT NEVER SEE RHIS COMMENT BUT I HA A DREAM THAT THERE WAS A GIRL!!!!
The gay pride clothes rant pissed me off. Imagine if you said that about racism. It’s like saying, I know racism still exists but be grateful it’s not as bad as it was back in my day… wtf?
I love The intro of Flynn singing the intro btw love u Colleen
What
She needs nutrients because she has two LOL also she, like many people don’t eat properly. I hope having the twins helps her understand that because she’s gonna need energy when she has two new borns lol
I also had twins last year, and my entire first trimester if I wasn’t eating or sleeping I was nauseous and wanted to die. I gained a total of 80lbs in my pregnancy. So, don’t worry.
I get that brands are trying to show acceptance and be inclusive but it pisses people off that they make money peddling the merch, but then don't donate any of it to LGBTQ+ charities or organisations to then actually help them. At least that's what I hear mostly as to why people get upset about brands capitalising on the LGBTQ+ community, as opposed to it just looking naff🤔 Im pansexual androgynous and im personally not too fussed, I just buy it if I like it, but i'd be more so inclined to spend if it's also going towards a LGBTQ+ charity and such🤔✨
GIRL WHAT
Can't wait for the gender reveal 😭😭
Reminder ❤️ God loves you and dont use His name in vain or disrespect Him :) even if u don’t believe please respect my beliefs
Girl your body is telling you what you need! Don’t feel shamed to eat when it’s telling you to eat.
I feel so happy, thank you for that little song about pride month, this is my first year that I’ve came out and can kinda be involved, the only people that knoe are my household, and I feel so emotional tbh and kinda scared because my outside family is very homophobic and I’m scared for them to find out eyeyeye
Tres 3 nor 2?
Flynn is so smart!!!!
I actually find a decent chunk of the Target Pride line pretty cool/cute
You did NOT gain too much from Flynn, you grew him perfectly and gave him all the nutrients he needed. You were a tiny girl, pregnancy would do the same to anyone who starts off small♥️ I'm so excited for these little ones on their way!💓
Your not eating for 2 but ur body probably needs more calories since it's likely ypur TDEE has changed.    Eating for 2 sounds bad because u don't actually need to eat two peoples worth of calories but it makes since for u to need more calories based on your body doing more work so it burns them faster.  At least that's what would make sense to me.  People (doctors) are just being picky with how u word it. As "eating for too " gives the wrong impression
I love queen colleen :)
I’m obsessed with your eyebrows! I’m not sure why, but they look SOOOOO good!!!
Watermelon jolly rangers puppy chow pop tarts egg pickle sandwich jack n the box 🍟 I still need to know…are you eating chocolate chip cookies 🍪???
The intro 😂
When I read the title my mouth dropped.
This intro is EVERYYYYTHINGGGG❤️
Gestational diabetes 🤔
omg the intro is so cuteeeee
I joke about her having triplets, and now this video? I'm dying 😂
You may not technically be eating for 2 (or 3), but the maybe takes all your energy, some women get their energy back by sleeping, others find it by grazing food without the day. Nobody should be shaming you for how you deal with your pregnancy. You're not harming the baby by eating.  If you are personally worried that you're eating too much, maybe try having a big breakfast in the morning to get you through lunch? Like having bigger meals might make you have more energy. But honestly if this is working for you, I wouldn't change it.
I can’t stop laughing at @7:30 when you’re talking and you can see the Miranda poster side-eyeing you 😂
*Colleen speaking* Me: staring at the cardboard cut out of Miranda 👁👄👁
9:51
lol Flynn the Sassy Barista
Please please get your iron checked. I’m only 4 weeks pregnant and anaemic haha
What about Alexandra and Edward for B + G
36 weeks pregnant here and I feel you with the pelvic pain 😭 That 'Puppy chow' looked amazing though, I'm going to need some of that. My first pregnancy I gained 60lbs and gave birth a week late to a healthy 8lbs baby who obviously needed all that I was eating. So far this pregnancy I've gained 50lbs, hoping for an early induction as baby is measuring on the 90th centile 😳 Eat whatever your body tells you you need ♥️
Doctors usually tell you to not to gain a lot of weight while pregnant so you don’t get diabetes which can create difficulties when giving birth. They want the sugar level to be under control for you and the baby/babies.
Triplets omg
I am hoping for girls! Bailey would love that
My mom had one of my twin brothers by  c-section and the other one naturally
I died when you said Francesca and tweed😭😭😂😂
In the intro when Flynn says: I’m Colleen it sounds like he says  I’m the queen
i have a c pillow too 😝 i’m not pregnant i just have hip impingements so i can’t lay with my knees together either lol
Love that song ❤️❤️
I think the shade on the pride clothing is that corporations tend to capitalize on the idea of "pride month" but in reality, they uphold very different values about the lgbtq+, thus the insistent criticism over the clothes.
Colleen:im going to see Flynn rn bc i miss him so much i havent seen him in an hour  Me:AWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEE ONLY AN HOUR
Can I just say Flynn’s talking is so good
Ice cold water and juice helps me.
11/10 recommend the name Francesca (My first name is FrancescaRose) :)
Everytime I watch a vlog I am shocked by how well Flynn speaks now
As a type 1 diabetic, juice (or any sugary drink) is a life saver when it comes to hypoglycemia. It corrects low blood sugar faster than food does, so I would recommend that for when you're feeling shaky if your stomach is up to it :)
“I just said it.” ☠️
I’m not pregnant and I want a pregnancy pillow. I sleep with so many pillows and want a huge pregnancy one to snuggle in!
Omg Colleen you look so pale and weak 🥺
She should do a psychic reading again
I feel like when you keep the names the same length they will go okay if you have two short names or two longer names
"Uh Oh, I spilled it!"   HOW CUTE! He has a personality of his owwwwn now!
I literally told my sister Colleens having triplets and now there's a chance it might happen 😩🤗
Ya i no my mom is u no
is it just me or is flynn gonna be the cutest big brother.x luv u sm colleen xx
What about Millie and daisy
Sassy Flynn is amazing
Oof
ISABELLA FOR GIRL JAKE FOR BOY IF BOTH GIRL ISABELLA AND SKY BOTH BOY JAKE AND MAX
7:08 they are humans🧐
9:28 did she accidentally reveal the baby's genders? 🤨🤔🤔
If there boys you should name them Finley and charley
i feel you with the hungry part- 23 weeks and starving all the time lol
Flynn has the best manners I'm not even kidding🥲 putting all the toys back into box after digging everything out and saying thank you after everything  Flynn is adorableeeee
The hunger and shaking in the start - I hope it’s not gestational diabetes
Whatttt??
i’m in my 3rd trimester and OBSESSED with cold watermelon 🍉😋
You are making your upcoming kids as source of views.
My mum had my oldest brother c-section because he was four weeks early and my mum nearly died with him and had me and my other brother Naturally and she always says that she would much rather have a natural birth so
5:46 OMG WHEN HE SAID “i just Said it😒...” LMAO
Hi Colleen! Ok so with the pride sections in stuff, I think you should look up ‘pride capitalism’ I completely get what you mean about pride ranges never being around before this, and that opinion is absolutely valid! Of course it will always be wonderful that there is more acceptance and comfort around representing the queer community. But a lot of the discomfort surrounding big brand pride ranges revolves around their lack of actual support to the lgbtq+ community. So for instance, say a big supermarket donates to or supports a big anti lgbtq+ organisation, but they label things with rainbows during June to ‘show support’. Those actions aren’t big enough to cancel out their hateful actions on every other day of the year. I’m sure there are a lot of people saying about how they don’t like the ranges themselves, purely from an appearance standpoint, but there’s a lot of deeper meaning behind the disinterested too. I hope this was helpful! Thank you xx
We need more sam & laybia and characters with corey
I just found out I’m bi 🤍
“Uh oh I spilled it” he is adorable🥺🥺💓
Yeah so you ate sugar all day and cant figure out why you're shaky? Ok
As much as I want to support the LGBQT+, I think it a marketing strategy to get more money
I gave birth to my boy/girl twins at 32 weeks naturally, no pain relief and it was amazing!
Flynn saying "oh oh I spilled it"  Is everything 😍
Both of my babies are C section babies. I wanted a water birth with my daughter but she was 11 days over due and she pooped. So they needed to get her out. My son was 6 days early via planned c section. He was really small and because I previously had a c section they thought it was the best option. They are both so healthy and happy.
Im so proud of u colleen, You’re doing great and please stay safe colleen and family <33
Even though you aren't technically 'eating for 2' you sre barely getting any of the nutrients you are eating as its going to the babies in your uterus. That's the reason you are always hungry, because even though you are constantly eating you still need the nutrients that you aren't getting...
colleen, i would shout that im gay and proud. but im not out
Hearing how much weight you gained makes me feel so much better. I was 125 and now I’m 175 and only 26 weeks!!!
I still think Margo and Theo are the cutest names!  Margo and Dana  Margo and Ace Ace and Asher  Fiona and Finland
Omg! I couldn't stop laughing wenn I realized the look on  Miranda's face behind Colleen.  Is like she is looking at her the whole time  like "what the heck?!"
eric] what is it] [flynn]  ice cream i just said it
She literally said I hope I push out 3 babies😹 she meant 2 but still cracked me up
My thoughts on the pride clothing thing. I do 100% agree with you, but not most but a very large chunk of big companies use pride month as a time to get more money I guess you could say. So they are not necessarily doing to support and celibrate pride month but more to profit of of it.
loooooooved the legally blonde at the end !!!
What are you going to do gender reveal on the cake or what?
I though of a boy name and a girl name: Jason for the boy and Lilly for the girl 💕xx
Stop hating on Colleen she is carrying twins one more baby than when she carried Flynn she is allowed to eat a lot more if she wants and plus it isn’t her that just wants food it’s the two baby combined in her body asking her for food and they and the mom need nutrients
Omg 70 pounds! I gained 19pounds (9kg) but my bubba took everything from me!! I was sick and in pain all the time.  No shade though, hunger is real when pregnant and I bet it’s worse with twins
Imma be frank. Why don’t people mind their own god damn business and stop body shaming her! It is none of your concern. If she needs to eat lots to support 2 babies, then shut up and let her do it or SUPPORT HER.
The Ballingers are so good at naming their kids. Looking forward to meet Francesca, Tweed and Frank Matrol
Colleen’s face when she guessed coffee but it was actually milk 🤣🤣
Are you gunna dress them in matching clothes?
My problem with brands their rainbow sections is when they do slap a rainbow on things but don’t treat their lgbt+ employees well, or even have them in the room, when there is no (significant) donation part to it. Basically when it is just to get our money, not do any of the work to help equality.
Awh Flynn singing teapot is so adorable. His imagination is awesome.
Flynn with the tea set, so adorable 🥺🥺
Flynn always makes me smile. He's a beautiful boy. I hope his siblings will be as sweet and beautiful as him. ❤
Does anyone know what easy recipe colleen used to make puppy chow?
Colleen don’t push your self like your making two bAByS oMG bTW TELL PEOPLE tO bAcK oF whEN THEy sAy eWwW YoUR eating so much pEopEL BACK OF sHeS PREGNANT woman With TWO BABIES
Wow 4 kids
There's also a chance that people who are making fun of those pride clothing products are people against rainbow capitalism, which is warranted.
i just had a baby via c-section 14 days ago, never wanted one and honestly it was rough lol. just My Experience .. the recovery sucks
My mums a doc and said that she looked at the baby photos and their non identical because identical twins normally share a sack where as baby A and baby B don’t
Shaking could mean hypoglycaemia so try having more protein and wholegrains with the sugary food.
I'm an identical twin and our names are Molly and Paige
why dont u call ur twins AVA and Charlie because thats mime and my brothers names
Flynn is sassy 😼
Idk if it helps but my mom said the adjustment from 1-3 was a lot at first but honestly she preferred having two children at a time because my brother and I always entertained one another <3
Guys leave her alone she is doing nothing wrong Love u Colleen ❤️
in the sims 3 to gain chances of a girl you have to eat watermelon… so i think there’s a at-least one girl in there
2:01 talking about cast party, casually throws up a pic of ariana grande
just because you're not technically eating for two or three doesn't mean your body doesn't need extra fuel to create literal human life. twice.
Hi Colleen honestly don’t worry about your weight it’s ridiculous that they put a number on it! If you’re hungry eat just keep health in mind when you’re able to! I’m a slightly bigger lady and 15 weeks now and haven’t put any weight on thus far and im not overly hungry! That’s probably because my body is bigger so doesn’t need more. As a smaller person your body might just need more and there’s nothing wrong with that! Xx
Not a professional here! But I would definitely eat more protein/iron rich foods! They should help keep you feeling more full but also good for bone density, babies growth, and feeling less shakey. I get super shakey like that on my period if my iron is low. And it helps so much. Or trying an iron supplement. Hope this helps! :)
Colleen, I have a suggestion, I think you should make a family vlog channel.
Ugh if you are telling her what to do/what not to do, leave. Good rule of thumb: don't offer advice unless it's directly asked for, especially in pregnancy/parenting. She has her doctor who is giving her any directions she needs. She is doing great.
Two living baby’s two! Of course she eats all day every day and I believe in you Colleen your doing great.
I hated pregnant anxiety. It was like i needed to jump out of my skin.
I had to have an emergency c-section with my first but got PTSD from the Labour. Then after two miscarriages I had my daughter by a booked (elective) c-section. Mainly because I just did NOT wna go the through Labour again..
I had a dream last night you were having two girls 😂
Flynn pouring everyone tea and milk and eggs was the cutest thing ever
Charley and Lexi 🤍
Don't let the haters get to you you're pregnant you can do it you want
What about the names samara and Savannah?
as a part of the lgbtq+ community, the problem most people have with big companies putting out lgbtq+ merch is bc they only do it during june and then every other month of the year, they turn a blind eye to the community. it just feels like they're trying to profit off of pride. not all companies are like this but a lot are. itd be nice if they could put an effort year-round and not just this month
My mother had to get a cesarian with my younger brother because, well i dont know exactly what happened but it like pushed through a cell wall or something and before she was due she got rushed to the hospital
Are you possibly deficient?
Happy pride month LGBTQ+ ! Reply to this comment with your info! I’ll go first :D I’m non-binary, bisexual, they / them or he / him  You’re valid!🏳️‍🌈🌈❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
happy pride month everyone🏳️‍🌈🌈
Why are we not talking about how Flynn play spilled the juice when playing the the teapot?!
Both my kids were c-sections (first not planned, second planned) and its really not bad at all. You are in pain for the first 2-3 days but then it rapidly gets better and they usually give you very good pain meds in the hospital. Not being able to change diapers for the first days is a little frustrating since you are mostly lying in bed but i really enjoyed just nursing, cuddling and watching my perfect little angel sleep <3 I was a little worried since my baby girl was born during the first lockdown but not having any visitors actually made the time extra special.
I'm almost 4 months pregnant having 1 baby just like you Colleen I would go on with my day eating a snack and I be fine but now I am constantly hungry. I eat a meal or a snack a few minutes pass by and I'm hungry again sometimes my stomach hurts of how hungry I get even though I just ate. Also I gag frequently especially when I brush my teeth most of the time I vomit any tips? I've tried the preggie pops they been alright but any tips are welcome.
0:19 , wait what?                  She said see eating for three???? I just thought it was two Colleen! So happy for you either way!!!
Ok for one, it IS true that you are eating for two in this case it’s 3!! It just depends on the trimester you’re in too. You need food for the babies AND you. The babies take all the good things from you so you need to make sure you have enough for both you and the babies. Idk why those who literally haven’t been through nutritional classes think they know everything 🤣
Strawberries have been my love these last few weeks :) But so nauseous.
I’m a twin and I wasn’t c-sections :)
Colleen is such a bright light in this dark world. I love how she always takes a negative subject and find the positives in those situations. She reminds me to think of the positives even on the worst days.
Of course if you’re pregnant you’ll eat more! Your body requires more nutrients and energy and fuel to not only keep all YOUR organs functioning, but to CREATE organs for your babies from scratch! Eat all you want, but nourishing foods (like meat and potatoes and dairy products and fruits) will help you feel more nourished than pop-tarts 🤣 but I’m certainly not judging! You’re pregnant with twins! You eat what you want!!
my opinion on the pride themed stuff as a queer person: I in a way appreciate it. As colleen said,,, back when she was younger they didn't have that sort of stuff & it does show that being queer and pride for it is being normalised. My problem with it is the fact that it is rainbow capitalism. I'm constantly seeing companies and brands putting our pride merch while supporting anti LGBTQ+ organisations. Companies are doing it for money, because we are at a time where they can without getting backlash or lose money. Its just really performative because these companies don't  actually give  shit about queer people. Sorry if this was explained really bad,,, i'm not the best at explaining things lmao.
Flynn killed me with ice cream I just said it 😂😂😂
Ice helps. If you’re nauseous, try eating ice.
Sorry for bothering you colleen but what episode is Eric on Lucifer I’m watching Lucifer 2 right knows if anybody knows what episode please me
What a quick,humble flex using the Puc with Ariana Grande! Love you gurl ❤️so happy to see your family grow🥳🥰
Colleen you’ve gotta balance protein and carbs to balance your blood sugar! You will feel better and less starving and shaky! More protein will help! :))
Flynns voice is so precious
Name one Rick and the other Morty
You are not alone I’m 16 weeks and hunger is real and I’m only having one lol
I had to constantly eat when I was pregnant with my twins because it takes more energy up! I’d get the shakes and pass out otherwise
psychic: 'he's gonna be all boy, jumping off the walls' Flynn: having a tea party and singing I'm a little teapot.  What a cutie!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love puppy chow. Also that song👏🏻
I hope you'll be alright
The saying “eating for 2” needs to be taken not so literally. It’s the easy way of saying what your body needs due to the fact you’re growing humans inside of you. I don’t think anyone should feel conscious about saying it.  As for the amount of weight you should put on while pregnant, I don’t think it matters as much in your case Colleen as you are naturally thin with a high metabolism. They do say for women to weary of it due to pregnancy diabetes- which anyone can catch
U shold not be scared Off having twins its gonne be fun 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
I get shaky when im hungry too! no one aroung me relates!
Also one more thing can you please make Flynn a YouTube channel xx
Not pregnant but I do have blood sugar issues due to digestive problems and it can sometimes be hard to stomach food. I always suggest these little things called breakfast essentials. They come in a vanilla and chocolate flavor. They even have some with high protein if you're lacking in protein and need a little extra :) they help stop my shaking within 15 minutes too!
14:33 I thought Miranda was staring at me
Awwwww when flIN says pick, he says PICKLE
I have delivered at 156 lbs every single one if my 4 pregnancies. 1st I started at 103 lbs, 2nd 110 lbs, 3rd 125 lbs and 4th 130 lbs.  it was trippy. It is what it is. With my 1st my butt was the only thing that grew, I ended up in a size 22 pair of Taco Bell uniform pants (before they provided maternity clothes). With the second my belly was huge, snd so on. Also all of mine are boys. Our bodies are amazing!
Does Erik still make you that smoothie every morning??
Random thing to try... humming to counteract waves of nausea.. be interesting to know if this helps alleviate it at all for you! X
Try eating more protein might stabilize your shaky ness.......I know for me ( I've had 2 sets of twins naturally) meat was the last thing I want to cook.....there are other options for protein......even adding protein powder to a smoothing
Basically people don’t like “rainbow capitalism.” When stores use the fact it is Pride to get money and kind of take advantage of the lgbtq people wanting clothes to express themselves. It is always noticed when big company’s put out Pride lines but also donate funds to help LGBTQ which is given better credit too. people will make fun of clothes because they feel these huge companies are trying to take advantage of the LGBTQ people for money and then not show support the rest of the year. That all being said, I personally like to see any companies LGBTQ Lines cause I feel like it’s somewhat normalizing it. I’m Bi and Ace and so seeing that inclusion anywhere always feels nice but I understand the people who are upset about the rainbow capitalism.
Middle names like gray and grey
You are awesome Colleen. And Happy Pride month everyone. 🌈🏳️‍🌈🌈🏳️‍🌈💜🧡💛💗💙❤️💚💖😍🥰💞😻👦👩👭👬👫💑💏🦋🌈🏳️‍🌈
The thing she has a pillow in her legs 😆
Honestly Colleen you've not eaten much at all and your babies are trying to get you to eat more. It's good!
I'm so glad someone else has experienced gagging episodes! My husband said I was overreacting when I had gagging episodes the entire first trimester 🙄🙄
She said he?! She’s having a boy/boys
Favorite part Flynn "uh oh I spilled it" 😂
TRIPLETS?!?!!?!?
If you feel nauseous suck on a lime! It helps
It's not so much that you're eating for three; it's that you're eating to grow 2.
Imagine ( Flynn,Austin,and London)!!!!! I just think it would be cute ☺️
Anymore Pregnancies?
WAIT TRIPLETS
Just letting you know that when pregnant you should consume 500 more calories a day. That’s for a single pregnancy so multiple pregnancies are more calories. Your body is literally creating people. Also, my sister is a tiny lady and had 9 plus pound babies naturally. Regardless of the size of the mother her body does what it needs to do and things stretch and bones move to get the baby out 😊
"through my hole" 😂😂😂
Colleen at 8 months: I’m having dodecahedron kids!
I had my twin boys naturally & with no pain meds at 39 weeks lol. it wasnt planned to be medication free but they didn't listen to me when i wanted meds (which i should of had some - i don't think it was fair of me to go through that much pain) but they were healthy so i'm happy. they were 7lbs 2oz and 6lbs 9oz . you got this!
Hey Colleen! I know you're always looking for information on how to strengthen you pelvic floor so I recommend looking into Megsquats (well known female bodybuilder who also happens to be pregnant).
What is your favorite part about pregnancy
2 trimester
Lol the pride song made my day 🥰
IM BI YASSSSSS
Ive always ALWAYS ALWAYS!! Loved the name lennox
Your body probably needs protein. I got super shaky when I needed protein when pregnant. You keep eating all you need girl. Who cares what others say. You know your body more than anyone.
Where did you get Flynn's pj's @??
You should make a cooking channel
I legit had a dream where she revealed she was expecting twin girls❤️
Where the hell did she get Ron and john out if
Pregnant twerking
Colleen:talks about c-section  Me:holding back from writing tons of essay-like comments of being an nat. birth activist as since the Jian Hao Debbie Starley preg episode
I’m sure my five kids are made of bagels and pop tarts
I never thought yea sets were for boys and while I don’t care seeing Flynn play with it makes it look like a girl and boy toy and I love it
He's gonna have siblings!!!
The only thing with pride products is that many of these companies don't put their money where their mouths are or even go against the community outside of pride month. Biggest one is Disney has pride ears and yet refuses to have lgbt+ characters and is constantly queer baiting. Other companies it goes from 0 to 100 and then right back to 0. It's made pretty clear they are celebrating pride for the publicity over actual care. Which to a degree can be expected but can be kind of hard to stomach all the same.
dramamine original formula motion sickness relief pills helped my nausea. I was non stop vomiting and nauseous until I started taking the pills. I got mine at Walgreens
Not me thinking she is gonna have girls cause she is eating watermelon lol if you know you know
Flynn: Ice cream.....I just said it..... 😤🙄
Consider Robert and David, thats me and my twin! It has a nice ring to it!
Being awaken during a surgery is scary so I understand why someone wouldn’t want to have a c-section… but also pushing a human out of mg hole is also terrifying

Am I the only person who has never heard it called "puppy chow"? My family has always said muddy buddies.
I’ve never been pregnant before so I don’t know if this would help, BUT I do have severe anxiety that causes extreme nausea, I went like two months throwing up EVERY DAY due to the anxiety and the only thing that helped it was red & white peppermints and ginger ale but mainly the peppermints, so I’m just wondering if those could also help you?
I seen another youtuber talking about Preggie Pop Drops for nausea....they might be worth a try....
The picture of Ari at 2:04 omg what a baby. She looks like a distant relative of present day Ari.
since you’re shaky and nauseous sometimes, do you think you could possibly have gestational diabetes??
Its awesome that you're pregnant with twins! I'm a twin myself!
I love how Colleen says '' what did you pickle"
YES COLLEEN! Love the lgbtq+ song hehe! 😊😊🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
did she get the good carrots i need to know!
Sometimes i want to eat constantly when there is something missing. Maybe you should check all the nutrients. I know you do a blod work frequently so it's just a suggestion based from experience.
Beautiful
Regarding the first minute: maybe you're not eating or drinking the right things and getting the right nutrients you need?
I keep hearing Flynn say "I'm the queen" not "I'm Colleen"  it's adorable.
we love you so much colleen, eat as much as you want because that is what's best for you and your babies!! <3
Omg watching you guys playing tea party with Flynn was DARLING!!!!
I agree with you that having more representation is great, but the issue with big corporations releasing the pride stuff is that that are basically just capitalizing off the lgbt community
What the hell??? Who's actually saying that crap. My doc was like, "You're creating a living breathing human from just a few cells. You need all the vitamins, minerals, and energy you can get to keep creating this in a healthy manner" plus as a Mom, you need the energy to not only do that BUT to fuel your own body and go about your day. Food = Fuel. End of story.
You might have low blood sugar (hypoglycema). My mom had that when she was pregnant with me, and she would get shaky and  only the sugar in food would make it stop. Maybe ask your doctor?
Flyn stop it your sooooo cuuuuuute!👆😭
This is so wholesome it’s burning into my heart🥺💓
Maybe you're eating too much sugar and carbs:3
Hi I’m a twin and my mom has told me many many many stories about her pregnancy with me and my twin sister. One of the main thing my mom would always tell me was that she would be so so so so hungry all the time so it’s very normal 🙂 (just a good piece of advice😊) It would make me really happy for this comment to get liked or pinned 😊
I'm sad because, there's certain youtube channels I strictly follow because I know they have positive comments & I love so dearly & they sometimes post in regards to negative comments & I feel baffled I never see those negative post & I feel distraught that those very few negative individuals affect them so much 😔 they & no one deserves negativity especially those kind hearted ones, also in specifics to Colleen & the many others🥺💖
With both my pregnancies I HAD to eat every 3hours. If I didn't I could feel my blood sugar drop. I would shake, get cold sweats and feel dizzy so I can 100% relate
I think you’re body is always hungry but you only listen to it when you’re pregnant!!
Sounds like it could be reactive hypoglycaemia...
Okay but I literally felt the need to eat 24/7 with my pregnancy and gained so much weight lol I gained 80 pounds and everyone that heard that judged me but I don’t care if my body told me to eat I thought there must be a reason my body is telling me to eat so much. The doctors thought I was going to have a big 10 pound or more baby because of what my tummy was measuring but nope! Had her at 42 weeks and only 8 pounds 🤷🏻‍♀️
I think when the doc says “you’re not eating for two/three” they mean you shouldn’t have to force yourself to eat more Bc you feel like you need to eat for two/three. Back back in the day women were expected to. You’re totally going to eat more though Bc your body is growing TWO humans!!! Which is amazing! So you’re using so much energy! Eat as much as you need pleaseeeeee!!!!
I was a c section baby too cause I was a breech baby.
I think if their two boys they should be called Cloud a thunder because they kinda go with flinn
I have friends who are twins (both girls) and one of their names starts with an A, and the other is a B. The older one has the A, because alphabetical order. I thought that was a cute and funny way to make matching names without it being too obvious and annoying.
When he pretend spilled! Oh my gosh , that is the cutest kiddo ever!
Also three sets of names are Chase and Clyde Sarah and Sophia and Jennifer and Jerry
Mmm love eggs in my tea cup 😂😂
Ahhaha I can see the powdered sugar on her sweater near the end lol
i just wanted to put it out there that while its nice that there are pride collections now, it comes off as very much capitalizing off of minorities. to me, and quite a few others, at least. like , you dont sell traditional clothing that says your race on it during heritage months, yknow? plus, they shouldn’t do it JUST during pride month if they truly care. i noticed last year specner’s has never gotten rid of their pride merchandise since june 2020, at my local stores at least. but the whole idea of rebranding to rainbow and selling special pride collections during june as most big corporations do, it just feels weird and more like a publicity stunt than genuine care for the community. it would be nice if they donated the profits to organizations that help our community directly, but as far as i know, they don’t. i could be wrong though because i haven’t really looked into many because i find the concept weird.
Colleen it's all good I'm a mom of 4 😮🤣 with my first I gained 80 lbs....but I was 98lbs. With my second baby who only weighed 6lbs I still gained 70....your body is gonna do whatever it wants don't listen to the Dr's and weight every pregnancy is different and exactly what each baby needs that's just God's design. I cannot stand the weight requirement either. You do you baby because they don't feel how you do💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Flynn is literally the cutest little boy I have ever seen. ❤ I love your song.
Please get checked for gestational diabetes! Shaky, increased appetite and multiple babies definitely increases the chances!
Colleen you’re perfectly fine for eating how you are it’s normal just like block everyone’s negativity out the baby’s said we don’t wanna cart that energy you’re producing two people so you’re intake is normal and I love you
If you Believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins  then Resurrected three days later and is our Lord and Savior you will be saved ! He who is sinless died on the cross for our sins just so we could be here. He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords from generation to generation! Read your bible daily please  and Repent!! God bless you and your family!💜 (Not trying to force upon anyone who doesn’t agree )
You should make something that is filling for you
Did you get vaccinated and knew you were pregnant? How did you feel about it? I have nothing against vaccines, but just wondering...
in the most respectful yet disrespectful way, YOU SHOULD NEVER SHAME A PREGNANT WOMEN HAVING ONE, TWO, THREE, OR EVEN FOUR BABIES ON HOW SHE CHOOSES TO HANDLE HER PREGNANCY YALL STFU!! Colleen is doing amazing for crying out loud she's fucking killing it Idk what tf yall r watching.
OMG IMAGING THE DAY WHEN SHE SAYS LIKE FRENCHESCA INSTEAD OF FLYN
Name them Pedro and Murilo, it’s me and my twin names
TREAT PEOPLE WITH KINDNESS
I def call “puppy chow” muddy buddies
Colleen is the only YouTube I’ve heard saying ‘Subscribe to me right now!’
Just realized what puppy chow is lol we call it muddy Buddies where I’m from. Delicious tho 👌😂
So puppy chow is muddybuddys?
Hey Colleen if you do end up wanting/needing a c-section, it is really normal to feel scared but trust me it’s not scary and oddly just as beautiful as a vaginal birth in my experience ☺️ I know you said you are open to it so I’m sure you are prepared but please don’t feel afraid! Xxxx
Love the LGBTQ+ song Colleen!!! 🤣🤣❤❤
Coleen the Lgbt song lyrics I love it
Anyone remember “hey I’m colleen and I’m filming my day every day of may so hey I’m glad you came and I hope you’ll stay you’re watching quarantined with collen and this is my day” I have loved these vlogs since way back in March 2020. Love all the ballingers and congrats on the twins!
Not Flynn singing better then me and knowing more lyrics to that song. 😳
it was funny to hear the tweet about thinking it was triplets bc their parents said that, my sister is an ultrasound tech and immediately knew it was dizygotic twins upon seeing the thumbnail with the ultrasound lol y’all doctors exist for a reason hahahahaha
I gained 50 pounds with my first baby and the Dr asked me what are you eating I told her bread it's the only thing I can keep down she's like you don't want to gain too much weight because it'll be harder to lose after the baby I'm like I'm not worried about losing weight right now lol
Im 14 weeks along now, and watermelon has also been my go to. And i been craving lemon alot. So i like to squeeze lemon all over my watermelon and add a little Tajin. So yummay.. i want watermelon now... 😁
Maybe ur body is faking being hungry while what you really need is just water sometimes brain sends us wrong messages about being hungry while ud be thirsty
“What do you pickle?”😍😝SO CUTE! Btw I’m doing that with my kids for sure!!
Eat some protein!  You're eating a lot of sugar (pop tarts, grapes, bread etc.)  Dont stop eating those things, just add protein.  It slows down the absorption of sugar, will calm your shakes and keep you fuller longer
When I was pregnant with my twins they told me not to eat chocolate 😩
Names: Cheri Lynn (means petite one) for a girl... that's my actual name, but no one ever names their lil' girl that. And Sean for a boy, if it's one of each.
Every time colleen is playing with Flynn, for some reason I feel like tearing up!  I don’t have that kind of relationship with my mom, and I can’t get over how colleen is such a good mama🥺🥺
i have twins with rhyming names--I call them the wrong name all the time! 😂 10/10 do not recommend
I have good baby name zammy
Name suggestions =  Aria & Blake Jessica & Jasmine Blake & Jace
It would be cute if their names were inspired by your grandfather and his twin ❤️I wish you the best
might want to mention the shaking to your doctor because gestational diabetes exists.  not at all saying that's what you have because how would i know? just a thought.  it might help someone somewhere
Flynn knows the teapot song better than I do haha 😂
Protein! If you have protein in the morning it will help you feel full longer. If something like eggs or a protein shake won't make you feel nauseous.
The pride clothes thing - i honestly think companies are just trying to profit from smth without feeling the connection as an ally or part of the community
The pride sections are nice to see but I feel like they come off as disingenuous because these large companies are profiting off of it instead of donating the profits to charities that actually help lgbtq+ people.
I just came out as trans and I’m also bi it’s my first pride month we’re I’m apart of it and not just supporting it
Flynn: ice cream i just said it 🙄🤚 Is just so iconic 😅
Flynn singing little teapot is so cute.
My only problem with big stores and their LGBTQ2IA+ merch is that it’s a corporate money grab. I did find a lot of awesome small businesses who have great items for sale! Supporting artists 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Omggggggggg
Flynn es el niño más lindo del mundo 🥰
Someone inn my class is lesbian and liked me but i dont care
Um, protein ? Hello? Avocado bacon and cheese? Omelette?  Nuts?  You can't feel satiated on carbs gorgeous!
Colleen: I’m so sick rn *gets all excited and looks 100% fine* me: uh- aren’t you-
When are we going to see Flynn’s reaction to the pregnancy?
My heart..... He is so precious! Like when he started singing “I’m a-little tea cup”, I died. 😍😍😍😍
My most favorite part abt this vlog by far was when Eric said “ what’s in here?” And Flynn said  “ ice cream ..... I just said it
Flynn is so cute ❤️❤️
I had a c section it felt weird my son turned his head after 16 hours of labour he is now 21
Girl, I had hyperemisis gravidarum, literally could not even keep down a teaspoon of water or food for several months, had to get IV's, and when I could actually eat it was nothing but refried beans and ramen until the last month when I could barely actually eat a few other food items, and I still gained 50lbs! (Went from 125 to 175.) There's no way I could have eaten less than I did!  I really think that 30lb weight gain limit is a bunch of crock personally. (I'm not a doctor, just sharing my experience.)
THE CHARACTER FLYNN HAS BECOME OMG 🤣 “…ice cream…. I just said it 😐”
I don’t know why but whenever I’m watching Colleen my cat just gets closer and is so relaxed.
No joke - I ate half a watermelon with a fork when I was in my 3rd trimester and would have forked anyone who tried to take it away from me.
Collen try to talk to your doctor about ear patches for nausea. My mom gets them for her motion sickness and it works great, but I don't know if you can use them for this or while your pregnant cause they are a prescribed thing. But it would hurt to ask.
“Through my hole” 🤣🤦🏼‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣
CONGRATS   It’s compleatly your choice if you want to put the kids up for adoption or keep the.and raise them And remember stress is bad for the babie(s)
World : to have babies the "natural' way Colleen: through my   hole
~Francesca and Tweed~
The “Uh Oh! I spilled it!” was the cutest thing omg
For nausea, try preggy pop drops! They’re on amazon!! They saved me and they’re sour and so good!
Why the fuck would anyone shame people for their weight gain in general, NEVERMIND DURING PREGNANCY!!!!!! If you crave something it’s usually because your body needs something that’s in that food! And during pregnancy you still need the extra nutrients even if you aren’t “eating for two”. Even though “eating for two” literally makes sense and I’m willing to bet people who say otherwise that info comes from a place of diet culture and disordered eating. STOP SHAMING PEOPLE!!!!
I will say that, regarding the pride stuff in places like Target and Walmart, the biggest issue I have ever had with them is that they don't (or at least didn't - it may have changed now) give much *back* to the LGBTQ+ community. They make pride stuff to make a profit off of people and that's it. That's why I try to buy pride stuff from stores that give proceeds to LGBTQ+ centers, The Trevor Project, etc.
low blood sugar!!!!!
...ya gotta put peanut butter in the puppy chow! 😂 at least that’s how we do it in the Midwest!
Completely understand what Colleen is saying but there is a difference between corporations using their power and platform to celebrate and protect certain groups compared to using a trending societal moment to profit. Most corporations don’t care about progress or protecting minorities unless there is money involved.
I can’t wait to get to “know” your future babies. Flynn is so freaking awesome and has such an awesome personality. Parents like you give me hope for the future. You’re snapping awesome little humans.
eat some protein and go ahead keep eating healthy, don't worry about it! You'll lose it later.
I think you could be shaky because you are eating all sugar foods try adding some protein and fiber.It will help you feel full and not shaky.Take care growing babies is exhausting.
this is suuuuch a fun vlog, the whole flynn tea party section was one of the cutest moments ever and the pride song at the end was iconic LMAO what a vlog
THE SONG COLLEEN SANG ABOUT PRIDE AT THE END WAS ACTUALLY FANTASTIC LMAO YES
Name the twins sam and labia haaa
Erik: what is it?  Flynn: Ice cream, I just said it 🙄💅       he is adorable! 😂
Didn’t Colleen say that she wanted to have good CC on her videos, so her brother Trent and other people in the deaf community could make sense of her videos?
Shes Miranda the wergin again like if you remember the show👍
Oh you could name you twin if 2 girls they could be name Melody and Harmony because you and your fam are very musically inclined 🥰
Thank you for supporting me and my gf 😭😭🥰
If They are both boys you could do like Noah and Ryder or sum idk
Her singing oh my God  from legally blonde has been the highlight of my day
Flinn is so cute!!
People forget that every woman's body is different. I'm currently 14 weeks with one baby and I have gone from barely eating one meal a day (and never being hungry) to feeling like I'm starving ALL the time! I'm eating 4-6 meals a day and I have to eat something reasonably sized before I go to bed or I'm waking up in the middle of the night really lightheaded and my stomach is full blown growling. Yet somehow I have managed to loose 5 kilos since being pregnant.
What about Ashton and Ella or if it’s 2 boys Henry and Ben or if 2 girls Angela and Elloise/Ellie
Im here to say eat whatever you want/need whenever you want/need and I’ll take all your cherry jolly ranchers you can have my green apples
Just a suggestion if they are two boys you could call them Tom and Gorgie or boy and girl Tom and Georgia
I think the problem with pride merch is companies trying to profit without doing anything to actually help 2SLGBTQIA community 🤔 and the items they are selling have pretty narrow spectrum 😅
The Flynn intro is so fricken cute! Still not over it. Please never change it.
Colleen, I completely understand where you're coming from about the pride clothes. But the issue a lot of us have with it is that companies are only using us to profit off of. It's upsetting that they choose to outwardly support the LGBTQ+ community now because it can make them money.
“ ...I just said it” I SCREAMED
An egg, pickle, and mayo sandwich doesn’t sound weird at all just mix it together and it’s egg salad
My dad’s brothers are Ron and John 😆 They’re not twins though. And what’s even funnier is Ron married my aunt Rhonda!
Is it just me or whenever she says puppy chow I Think about the dog food
Try jack in the box tacos! So good
I have double that food by noon and I'm not even pregnant lol
You should do a psychic reading on the twins before and after like you did with Flynn!
I thought you were having twins not triplets
who else thinks the best part of her vids is flynn singing its sooo cute!!
Wondering how Miranda will explain this pregnancy. Also, prenatal vitamins and lots of protein!
Your eating continually because your body is telling you that you need nutrients.  So you keep eating. But your not eating healthy to satisfy your body and what it needs. (Vitamins n minerals from food) grapes bagels and pop tarts are just sugar. Your sugar crashes are the shakes.  Eat healthy if you can but if you can’t keep eating what you can. Your right at least. 5 meals a day. Seems like you eat all day. (I should add try to get a multivitamin your allowed to take. Plant based of course and organic and natural.  This will help babies get what they need )
I don't know all of my mom's cravings when she was pregnant but this is what I remember:  Pregnant with me: Spicy food. Once when she was at Pizza Hut, she had asked for a bowl of hot sauce  Pregnant with my sister: Sweets and Coffee  Pregnant with my brother: Fried pickles and Fountain Coke (not from Mcdonalds though)   She didn't really tell me details but this is what she was craving
3:33
My parents gave us the same middle name so we always have a twin connection! But our names aren’t the same letter or rhyming.
Your little munchkins are taking nutrients and energy from you, so you have to replenish them. ❤️ Eat what/when your body needs, and don’t worry about judgments from other people. It’s just Biology, baby. 👶🏼👶🏼
I'm lowkey curious on what happened to miranda sings. I will love to see miranda pregnant again and with twins !!!
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Me and my twins names are Ricky and Randy whitch both of the makes can go with either gender im a girl and my name is randi and ricky as a girl name couldbe ricki
Bruh some of these comments...it's clear who has experienced pregnancy and who has not. OBVIOUSLY a healthy diet is preferred. As someone who has been pregnant and who is currently pregnant AND has had terrible sickness with both..eating healthy was and is literally impossible for me. Most days it's throw up even water or eat the damn poptart so you don't faint. If you are not her doctor or haven't experienced severe nausea/vomiting/cravings in pregnancy, you are not qualified to give her advice or tell her what she should do.
Sometimes I get shaky when my blood sugars low
Tea party was sooo adorable❤❤❤
EAT WHAT YOU NEED! It’s not eating for two, as in the food isn’t going directly to baby, it’s going on running your body! Eat constantly if you need hun!
I don’t believe she’s having three babies. I still think it’s twins.
If the twins are a boy and a girl you should name them miranda and patrick
Growing a human is hard work! Growing two humans?! My gosh you’re super woman! So eat what you want when you want! Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise! No one knows what your babies and body need but you! 💛 You’re amazing!
If you are shaky, you might want to keep an eye on your blood sugars. They can go a bit strange when you are pregnant.
I'm always so surprised when she says puppy chow. I've grown up hearing them called "muddy buddies" it's just so weird to me how we all have different versions of stuff we grew up with! 😂
Colleen- I’m craving puppy chow, so I’m gonna go eat some  Me- what?! Gross 🤢🥴 Me- oh wait she means yummy delicious chocolatly goodness!! 😍😋😋😋 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️😅😅😅😅
That's the yolk sack in the ultrasound! When my husband saw that on mine he thought it was twins but it was not
When Is Miranda sings revealing that she’s also pregnant with twins?
It’s still scary to be gay and out
flynn is definitely gonna turn into a sassy little kory 😂
I love your videos they are so sweet and I love them and I don’t know what to watch because I’m sick so I’ve been watching your videos.
FRANCESCA!!!!!  IF YOU NAMED YOUR BABY FRANCESCA I WOULD ABSOLUTELY DIE!!!!! ITS A FABULOUS NAME 😉😉😉
6999
I’m honestly with her on the pride clothes
Gaining weight does not diminish your worth, remember that Colleen. Your body is so amazing!
😀😀😀😂😂😂
Flynn singing the teapot song is just so adorable 💖💕💖
Sweetheart, you are creating human life, eat whatever the hell you want.
We stan Francesca and Tweed 👯‍♀️
Watching kids play is just too cute and fun.
As long as you and your baby/babies are healthy don’t worry about weight gain.. also I was the same during my pregnancies (all single baby pregnancies)..  I would get pale, shaky, cold sweats, and my vision would start to tighten like I was going to faint.. it was scary for people around me but I was use to it.. I just needed to sit down and eat/drink
Erik tour of minivan!
I want a teapot that can turn water in to any drink.            Just me.    Ok.    😅😅😅
I think you need to eat more protein in order to help your body. Growing twins is no joke! I constantly crave protein! Good luck!
Hi
all of y’all Ned to stop hating on her she is doing her best
When is the gender reveal coming?
7:49 THATS MY QUESTION OMG IM CRYING AND SHAKING IVE ALWAYS WANTED COLLEEN TO ANSWER ONE OF MY QUESTIONS FOR YEARS AND SHE FINALLY DID. I WAS HAVING A HORRIBLE DAY TODAY THIS HONESTLY MADE IT SO MUCH BETTER <33
At Target yesterday I was looking at backpacks for a trip to NYC and saw Pride logo and thought "That's risky! You'll get your ass kicked or backpack stolen". Then I realized it's not the 1970's - 90's anymore.
Its hard to believe he was born in 2018.. I feel like we were just watching her pregnancy videos with Flynn.. Now he's two and they're having twins! 🥺❤
Girl mint smell mint when you are nauseous! It is amazing
im a twin and have an older sister and we were all c-section and my mom said that she preferred it over the thought of natural birth
If they still make the tropical bag of Jolly Ranchers, try those!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I think the problem with pride is that it’s not inclusive based, it’s money based.
Francesca and tweed 😂😂😂
I think the  amount of food your eating is completely normal and nothing to be concerned about. I myself as an active 20 years would have consumed similar amounts if not more than you! (i'm studying a bachelors of exercise and sport science), i also just did a nutrition subject specifically focusing on nutrition during pregnancy and nutrition in children!
How many think that once these babies arrive the vlogging is going to slowly get more and more rare simply because she’s just gonna be so dang busy/tired/living life/gets a nanny etc? And we’re totally okay with it??
I agree 100% that it should be celebrated that pride merch exists in these big stores for representation purposes BUT we can also at the same time recognize that it is just capitalism. Instead of giving our pride money to target or Amazon we can give it to small lgbtqia+ brands  P.s. Flynn is adorable
Pregnancy cravings are so weird! When my mom was pregnant with me she says she would always crave Dr. Pepper (which she doesn’t even really like) from one specific McDonald’s fountain machine, no other McDonald’s, just one location. She would make my dad drive 15 minutes out of his way home from work every day to get it for her 😂
Flynn: “this is chocolate ice cream” Eric : “what is this?” Flynn: “ice cream” Also Flynn “I just said it”  😂😂
I LOVE HOW YOU SAY “ what will you pickle” It reminds we how my grandpa says “are you cereal”  He still says it and he has said it for as long as I can remember
Omg I totally relate to the fast food cravings though. When I was preggo all I ever wanted to eat was triple cheeseburgers ALL OF THE TIME from McDonald’s and that’s like... not at all what I ever eat 😂 babies want what they want!
You need protein! I had gestational diabetes I was shaky and low energy unless I had protein with every meal and the doctor put me on a strict low carb diet go see your doctor
With all that sugar you consume. Yes you will shake! Lol. I learned the hard way and ended up with gestational diabetes lol .
What if you name a one of the baby’s Miranda ??
Your body needs more now that your pregnant again especially since you have twins You need iron rich foods and proteins or something could go very wrong with your twins I was born very early because my mom had not been eating properly at all and she had also been smoking so for the love of God please eat enough for your twins and you they're going to need it a lot and what you consider a lot of food is a snack for someone who is pregnant
You need protein!!
Colleen your such an amazing mother!
Wait you gained 70 pounds last pregnancy ?! It did NOT look like it omg
Eat you some protein girl 👍🏻
Me feeling jittery and feeling like I’m going to faint because I literally need to eat every 2 hours because I’m pregnant with 1 baby and everyone is shaming colleen for feeling that way while conceiving 2 baby’s 😔 stop mom shaming!!
i saw that lil legally blonde the musical reference at the end! ;) theatre kids turn it up
Eat!!!!! You need lots of food to make babies!!
Highschool musical 4 coming soon featuring Collen's pride month song 🎵
I’ve never ever been prego before as I am literally a teen lol, but I know that iron is very good for pregnancy and those wee lil babies. So eat some lentils, delicious and full of iron!
I wish I could of ate anything during my pregnancy that didn't give me heartburn, when I wasn't puking non-stop for 7 months so  you do you! Eat when you're hungry!
"Ice cream, .. I just said it" YES FLYNN I LIVE FOR YOUR LOW-KEY SASS
I love how you feel about your birth! I wish I could be as relaxed as you! My daughter was born via csection against my consent and with no medical indication other than the dr needing my bed for someone else so I am adamant this time that I WILL NOT have a csection unless it’s a medical emergency. I want my vaginal birth that was stripped away from me 🥲
If you have 2 sacks your most likely to have a boy and a girl
Francesca and tweed 😭😭
I’m vwoging 🥺, I’m bowing ♥️, IM COWWWEEEENNNN!! 😄
U should reach out to jesssfam bc she had twins and she has 7 kids so I'm pretty sure she can give u some tips about twins
There were a set of (boy/girl) twins at a school I student taught at; their names were Aidan and Nadia...which is the same name forwards/backwards 😂
My sister and I are identical twins and our names are Samantha and Summer 😇
Baby name ideas: Sam and laybia
“I want to try to have the twins through my hole” LMAO
LOL it was so funny and cute when Flynn was being sassy
Give us a Flynn UPDATE!!
Adding protein and fiber with your carb sources will help you stay full longer and not get those hypoglycemic shakes! I get those too.
Boy names: Noah and Nathan  Girl names: Liberty and justice     ❤️❤️❤️
Flynn is literally the best!! I love your vlogs!!
I’m so exited for you I have twins too 🥰🥰💞 your such a great mother your so strong you can do this beautiful mamas 💙💙
Loved the vlog sorry if I spelled it wrong and you are doing amazing especially carrying two kids sorry if that sounded rude but happy pride month and I thought I might just say this but my local Starbucks has a pride flag hanging
Me hearing her call muddy buddies puppy chow : ಠ_ಠ  P.S. : you should mix the powdered sugar onto them in a trash bag. It's easier that way. At least that's how my family does it.
Literally next video it’s going to be quadruplets-
sassy flynn i love it
Flynn is so precious!
My sister just had her twin girls and their names are Sophia and Leona
guys come on it’s 2021 we should all be supporting each and not bringing  other people down and i support the lgbtq community and if you don’t then that’s fine but don’t say hateful things and yes everyone has there own opinion but if it’s negative then keep it to your self and you don’t know that people go through and god bless everyone and i’m not trying to be mean and i just want everyone to be nice and we are all humans and we should treat each the way you want other to treat you and just spread positivity !!! happy pride month 🏳️‍🌈
Try cold lemon water and acupuncture for nausea also take warm baths for your back
Lol Miranda’s face in the background of the questions.😂
To answer why you eat so much the baby’s take a lot of nutrients therefore taking your food away.
1:09  17 or 70 ?
The yolk sac and the embryo look like two white dots in one amniotic sac early in pregnancy before the placenta is formed. My twins looked like four little dots in two different sacs.
Eat that protein, darling! IT'll help you feel full longer!
Flynn’s hot air balloon pjs are too cute!!!❤️❤️
Collen I'm a twin and me and my brother combined were 13lbs and my brave mom did not have a c section.
Aah yes Francesca and Tweed
You and Jessica should have make your pregnancy cravings and have the kids judge as to which ones are the yummiest lol
You should also get the pregnancy pillow that Karina Garcia used in her pregnancy morning routine vlog, it helps with sleeping and your sides and I’m not pregnant and I’m about to get it lol
you look so beautiful Flynn singing little teapot made me smile another fun video
noticed your pretty natural nails in your chatting segment! your nails are looking so cute and healthy, im SO proud of you and recognize and validate your effort!! keep it going! sending lots of love , muak!
You and Eric should go on more dates before the babies come and have a vlog of Cory putting Flynn to sleeo
Hi from Shakey Jakey!!   Iron and protein, girl! I'm not about to tell a pregnant woman HOW MUCH she should or should not eat because "that's your business" (shameless Tabitha plug). I am slightly anemic tho, so I understand the bloodsugar and low-iron shakes very well. Lots of dark leafy greens in your meals (spinach breaks down to barely anything so adding it is almost unnoticeable) and having some really good oats and whole grains should both bring up your iron levels. To balance out the carbs, try to include more protein like nuts, wide variety of veggies for balanced aminos, and some chicken. Protein also helps with feeling more satiated. Just some ideas. Take it or leave it. :-) Excited for you and Erik! Rooting for you!
"ice cream... i just said it 🙄"
Colleen singing legally blonde the musical at the end 10/10
Im so about the evil on this earth. People are so shitty. Have donut baby and that fried chicken and that yeast roll yuss I’ll have all of that with you
Omg he is so cute When he sings a little tea put some
I think it's going to be a boy and a girl
It would be amazing if the twins are girls then name them amethyst ans Emerald
why did want to sake a box like her
Tried to have my first baby naturally but it turned into a c section.   Second baby was scheduled c section.
When I was pregnant with twins they told me to eat a lot of carbs because my body was naturally going into ketosis & I was shaking and getting headaches. They said the babies were taking everything out of me!
Flynn is so cute him singing I'm a little teapot broke me
I spilled it lmao too cute
Please Note: Pregnancy RAMS up your progesterone levels which are associated with increased hunger. She is likely starving because in addition to an increased metabolic rate from even just making babies, her progesterone levels are EVEN HIGHER than most pregnancies, as she is having TWO babies. Think of a woman hungrier around her period but 30x the intensity.
Flynn knows more of the I'm A Little Tea Pot than me
Why do u keep saying twins when its triplets??
I had hunger pangs too with my daughter. That’s how I knew I was pregnant. I couldn’t satisfy it. But U should eat better than bagel, pop tarts and a few grapes. Eat what you would serve your toddler, just a bigger portion obvi lol!
EVERYONE NEEDS to pause right on 9:12
I am so anxiously waiting for Miranda to reveal her twin pregnancy! Aaaaahhhhhhhh!!!
So far you seem a lot happier in this pregnancy and that makes me beyond happy! (Not that you have to be happy to be strong and successful) I hope you really are happier and I’m sending you all the love and wishes for a great pregnancy!!! Your fans love you and appreciate you either way!!!
I got a dream that she is having a boy and a girl :)
:D today is mine and my mom’s birthday, I’m her birthday twin. I was born on her birthday :D. I turn 15 today and my mom turns 47!! Also love your content Colleen
I can't with how Flynn sassed back at Eric, "I just said it" lmao. He's too cute and growing up too fast!
I honestly really like the target pride clothes
Triplets are mentioned after 10:00 btws!
Man he is so good at talking!! Singing I’m a little tea pot was so cute!
Sorry Colleen, I’m merely at the end of the video but I’m literally half asleep and it’s only 11:50 pm
Have you thought of a water birth?
He is soooooooo sweet, LOVE his little singing.  Awww he's so adorable.
It's annoying when parents name siblings almost matching names. They think its cute, but from experience I can tell you it's not cute as an adult! Everything gets mixed up when it comes to paperwork and important documents. It drives me nuts when people don't know which one of you they are talking to.
Literallly hydrate always! Like first thing everyday! EXTRA WATER! Then eat betch!!!!
I hear people say "don't eat so much" but my doctor is amazing and told me "Don't listen to them. If you're hungry, eat. If you feel nauseous, eat. Your nausea is highly likely caused by not eating enough so always have snacks with you, always eat or snack, it's okay, your body is growing a whole person." And it made me feel better about always been so hungry to the point that my stomach feels like it's eating itself after an hour of not eating
Awwww!!!! Flynn is soooo ADORABLE 😍💙💜❤
TWO PERFECT NAMES WOULD BE HANNAH AND REBEKA IF THEY ARE GIRLS!
Weirdest food combinations??
Sugar low I get that often. Be careful just eat darlin😊
You look like Meghan Markle
Erik: **lovingly asks Flynn what he’s pouring out of the teapot**  Flynn: ICE CREAM...I just said it!    Flynn is hilarious 🤣
EVERYONE: performs,  accompanied by their parent/friends  Colleen: Performs, accompanied by ARIANA GRANDE
I love watching you with Flynn, you guys are fabulous parents.
Eat lots of protein, you will feel way better
yes we are appreciative that we have pride merch in general but we need it to be good and cute because if it's not cute no one is gonna buy the merch (which hopefully/most likely donates to LGBTQ+ charities), which means those charities will get less money and also like the bad designs show that companies didnt spend a lot of time, effort, or money on the products and that can mean that they are just doing it as a performance for their public image and thats also annoying !!!
you're the strongest woman ever. period.
My mom gained 70 pounds for my older brother and she was literally your size. She’s fine, he’s fine, and Colleen YOU DO YOUR THING GIRL
I’m votin for Francesca and Tweed for the babies!!
Flynn's personality is really showing through now and it's so cute!
I love how you show the real life of being pregnant I thought I was the only one that felt like that because everyone makes it look like a dream
Colleen Im gay and I love the song you made
You 1000% deserve god answering your prayers and giving you 3 babies in one pregnancy!
When is jojo going to do the gender thingy?
You should cut a watermelon and then freeze the watermelon it taste like a watermelon popsicle you should try it
I feel like Willow & Aubrey would be a good set of names if u were having 2 girls
Maybe add protein to your diet. Or a smoothie with protein.
Bro y’all need to stop shaming pregnant ppl for eating what they want? What if this is you and you were getting told how to eat, she’s growing the babies and she knows her body, so stop
It's only supportive if they actually support LGBT+ all year. It's mostly just exploitation.
Could it also be that your sugar is dropping alot? Very common in pregnancy.
Honestly, gain as much weight as you want, you’re literally so tiny so it does make since
"I do want to try to have the twins out of my... hole" 😂😂😂
Colleen's little pride month song went on for a little too long and it absolutely destroyed me lol I enjoyed that immensely
I get shaky if I don’t eat some protein for every meal. And I’m not even pregnant!  I feel Like Eating protein keeps my blood sugar level consistent. Hope you start to feel better soon.
Eric making you smoothies yet ??
I'm bisexual and my whole family is homosexual and happy pride month
I’m bisexual
You should name one of the twins something starting with the letter U and then something starting with the letter N for the second one so that the initials of your kids will be FUN.  Ha
My new fave twin names; Francesca and Tweed  lol
Harmony rose and melody grace for two girls is cute!
When your body is in the process of making a baby it burn approximately the same amount of calories as you would if you ran a marathon. So eat girl, eat!
My name is Jessi ahhhhh yes queen
TELL ME WHY. Me and my friend was talking about people who is pregnant with twins possibly have triplets because the woman never knows if there’s one hiding… but TELL ME WHY. She posts this video😭like omfg
with the thing about the pride clothes i see where you’re coming from, but most of these big brands are using pride and the lgbtq+ community simply to sell their products and during the other 11 months they don’t really give a shit lol
I’ve never been pregnant, but I’m super sensitive to not having enough food or not having the right kinda of food etc. (I’m not explaining it well but whatever) Basically what you’re describing at the beginning of the video, especially with the shaking, is what me and other people I know experience when we don’t have enough protein. Bagels, pop tarts, etc are amazing and perfect for an initial boost of energy, but peanut butter, eggs, cheese etc should work wonders to prevent the jitters and help you feel better for longer. Lots and lots of water always helps me too. I know everyone is different, but I hope this helps! 😊
I LOVE the part when yall were playing with flyn. I loved his sas.
u made a good point about the pride clothes in walmart and target
Please tell me I am not the only person that when saw collen at 1:47 thought omg why does she look so damn good :O
haii colleen i was just wondering if you have told ariana yet??
Can’t wait for tomorrow it’s poddddcaaaaassssst dayyyyy!!
With my oldest I lost 40 lb and then gained 60
Caspian is such a cute name just an idea
NGL the pride song was a bop 😂
Why did I start crying with Flynn started single ‘I’m a little tea pot,’ when he was putting his toys away? Hahaha AM I PREGNANT?!
girl, you do not have to defend target or amazon 🤣
Flynn is so funny 😂😂😂 “ice cream...i just said it...” absolutely disgusted that Erik asked I’m laughing so hard
the thing abt pride stuff is that its rainbow capitalism, they don't care abt us they just want their money and to put on a good face. I did find some rlly cute overalls at target tho. Plus most don't donate ANY of the proceeds to lgbtq+ organizations or anything, the pride line is for nothing but trying to make themselves look good. I'm gonna keep bashing on those god forbidden "gay af" and "slay queens" and "Human" shirts, never even including the lesbian flag anyways, and if it does have the lesbian flag it's the wrong one.
This is off topic but in my house now we always say Relax to everything, say ‘I have a present to you’ instead of for you, fingies instead of fingers, oh my nooness and oh my gotch, and mayks instead of mask, the way Miranda says it 😊😁🙃
OK maybe your baby is not eating a sandwich when you do…But you are eating to keep two people alive or in your case three.  So yeah, you are eating for more than just yourself. People should just be quiet
I was ravenously hungry and got shaky when I didn’t eat when I had prediabetes.
oh my gosh flynn singing is so cuteee
Flynn is just the best
Who is she?
Weren’t you underweight when you were pregnant with Flynn? So like.... 70 lbs is nothing. You NEEDED to gain that weight.
okay legally blonde the musicalll looks like elle's gonna win the prize if there ever was a perfect couple this one qualifies omigosh you guyssss
I died suffering from a case of too cute at that tea party
the song you sang about pride month is my new favorite song
For girl twins I’ve heard of Hailey and Bailey
Also please make “I’m not a scientist” merch hahaha
The issue with the pride clothes and the rainbows on the clothes is that some companies aren't lgbtq-friendly until it comes to June and suddenly they want to corner the market. If you're looking to buy some pride clothes I would suggest looking for companies that donate part of the proceeds to charities.
How far along are you?
I had my first born all natural. My second was a c section because his head was way to big for me.
My mom had hyper emesis and ate an entire watermelon and every day when she was pregnant
You are not eating for two which means you’re not eating 4000 cal a day but you are eating probably 2700 cal a day to grow baby and maintain your own healthy weight so they can suck it and you can eat all the healthy safe things that you want
I was also pregnant the same time you were pregnant with Flynn I had my baby girl in October and now…. I’m pregnant again…same time as you… I think you are a month ahead of me this time… love it tho!!!
Protein! Smoothies that are easy to throw up are good! And protein cereal I would use for early morning. Has literal no flavor so easy to re taste.
I’m so happy for you and how excited and happy you are 🥺 you’re an amazing mama and you deserve all the happiness!!
Lmao.. your sister made fun of the target pride clothes...
My mom had a 22 hour labor and got the “best” of both worlds! I was born first naturally without any epidural... and then 99 minutes later my twin was born WITH epidural and then a C-Section because he was facing the wrong way.
Puppy chow is another name for muddy buddies interesting
Maybe other people have posted this already but, I think your weight gain was exactly what you needed for the job you were doing! Your previous weight was pretty skinny and was fine for you as an individual but was not at all enough to sustain a pregnancy! And some people might have enough (minerals, vitamins, protein etc) on them already that they don’t need to gain a lot of weight to keep that baby and their body going. And Doctors try to highlight that for those whose extra weight could be a hindrance to their or their baby’s health, but that’s probably not the case for you. You’re doing great!  And for anyone is already heavy before pregnancy, you’re doing great too! The right weight you need to gain is completely individual. The ranges don’t apply to everyone 🙂
I love hearing colleen and Eric's excited parent voices off camera
Okay but now you gotta name em Francesca and Tweed 😂
Girls.   boys Ava.     Liam Isabella Andrew  Idk I think it cute
Vaginal birth is so important! C-sections are one of the major contributors to an unhealthy, underdeveloped microbiome which can lead to all kinds of disease later in life.  Of course I am not shaming anyone who has had one for any reason, and yes, sometimes c-sections are necessary. But most of the time they are not, and should be avoided if possible. Just feels like an important thing that more people should know about! Anywho, very excited about these twins, however they come into the world! Love 💕
You should give us a house tour and were the neresery will be
me being a twin watching this video: hmmm was this how my mom was... hmmmm yep c-section that’s meh
I’m livening for sassy Flynn
that picture of Colleen and Ariana is proof that she is actually tan and she’s not a blackfish 🤦‍♀️
Thank you for all the great advocacy work you do. In case you didn't know, sex is the word used to refer to the label you’re assigned by a doctor at birth based on the genitals you’re born with and the chromosomes you have. Gender is much more complex: It’s a social and legal status, and set of expectations from society, about behaviors, characteristics, and thoughts. I hope that in future videos when you talk about your twins, you refer to it as finding out their sex, rather than finding out their gender, which they will determine for themselves later in life. This will help make your videos even more inclusive and if you talk about the difference in your videos I bet a lot of folks will learn something new! <3
Chloe Davis girl you right
I have a pair of shoes with a rainbow stripe on the back, and everyone comments on them and i get so many compliments on my unintentional pride shoes!
I hope your doing good with the babies and I’m a lgbtq+
You are eating for 3 because your body needs those extra calories to grow these two babies in your belly!
They are capitalizing over the pride month period lol. They don’t care, all they care about is the money. But I see your point.
just a thought about the pride merch- It’s not just about the designs, it’s that the companies putting out the merch don’t have the best track record when it comes to supporting us LGBTQ+ folks. It feels like a slap in the face to have these companies only “care” about us to make a profit during june.
4:37 the little laugh! I can’t get over it!😆😆😁🤣
COLLEEN!!! PLEASE START MAKING MUKBANGS AGAIN!!
For me, I don't mind that companies decide to have pride stuff, I would just personally rather buy directly from members of the LGBT community or from causes that I know are going to benefit it.
colleen u know that a lot of stores coming out w pride stuff r jus profiting during pride month n some r actually very homophobic
When Flynn said " I spilled it"  and " and "I just said it". I laughed so much😂
Colleen is literally such a good mom 😭😭😭
It's not about companies supplying "bad" pride items its about large companies profiting off of the LGBTQIA+ community. Look for companies that support year round and donate a portion to the community.
You are Powell the big sister I've never had, thanks :)
My name is Bianca, and my twin's name is Gabriella, shortened to Riel (a personal choice they made in adulthood). As a twin, I highly advise against matching names!!! Being a twin is a lifelong identity crisis (at least it has been for us, and I cannot imagine how much more difficult it would be with similar sounding names. We're 30 now, and people STILL call us by each other's names by mistake, and we're not identical). Individuality is so important. That's my 2 cents about names!
That watermelon tip is good to know. Maybe that’s why I’ve been craving them lately. I’m seven weeks and I feel like I can’t keep anything down
There are essential oil inhalers for nausea. I swear im not a hippy that think essential oil will cure everything, but my dad had cancer and would get horrible nausea and it helped, it also helped when I got migraines. Just look on Amazon.
Flynn: ITS CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM! Erik: what is this? Flynn: ICE CREAM! ... I just said it..  😂😂
I love Flynn's noise for Water when he tips his Tea Pot.
lmao francesa and tweed
Colleen really deserves the world 🌎
She said d c - section 13 Times if anyone is wondering
right when she said watermelon i immediately thought about how in the sims 3 if you eat tons of watermelon while your pregnant you can have a higher chance of having a girl 👀
I have a twin brother! We look nothing alike except our smiles. I’m blonde with green eyes and a light complexion and he has dark brown hair with brown eyes and darker complexion. He’s extremely smart, forensic psychologist, and I have a learning disability. He practices the study of mental illness in the criminal justice system and I’m bipolar. Lol We were born 3 hrs apart and mom was, at full term, 121 lbs and had us naturally. But did have to have 4 blood transfusion after having us. So u can have twins naturally. 😉
I remember when he was first born he’s so cute 🥰
My town put pride flags out for PRIDE month pretty cool
Your sons so cute omg!
The thing with pride merch is that a lot of those companies are just being performative with their pride collection. They're trying to profit off of it and a lot of them only support LGBTQ+ people during the month of June. I get that this was so different just 20 years ago and thankfully we've progressed so much and so fast. But the downside of that is now there are people who just want to take advantage of it and just try to capitalize on it.
Erik: what’s in here? Flynn: ice cream!!  I just said it Me: 😂😂😂
I legit died when Flynn sang the “teapot song” he’s too pure 🥺🥺🥺
Omg Colleens LGBTQ+ song made me laugh so hard lol (and don’t flip out, I’m an lgbtq+ Allie, I’m just saying I liked her song- ok? Ok.)
I am a C-Section baby and the C-Section actually saved not only my life but my Mom's as we were both in danger.
Honestly, I have had three c-sections and if I ever do get pregnant again I will most likely need to have another c-section. I will still be nervous and if you are nervous about it, that is ok. It is a major surgery. Good luck to however you deliver the twins. ❤️
Just wanted to say that I know people who ended up having multiple babies and thru the whole pregnancy there was only 1 heart beat heard and only 1 baby in the ultrasound, so you never know.
Of course Eggs Colleen, gosh.
Hey Colleen, just wondering if your family has a history of Hypermobility or Elhers Danlos Syndrome. It runs in my family and really effected my cousin's pregnancies. She had horrible pelvic girdle pain and was in a wheelchair for at least the third trimester for each one.
This is a petition for her to name them Francesca and Tweed xDD
Remember 2 years ago you joked around that you were having twins but now you are
You’re probably hungry all the time cause your body makes sure that the babies get ALL the nutrition so you only get the leftovers for yourself.
Eat more protein you won’t be extremely hungry
The only 'shade' I've heard being given to Target is about the profits for their 'pride' clothes going to anti-LGBTQIA+ companies.
I like the name Francis and the nickname Frannie or Franny
Me and my twin brother are named Daniel and Deanna so same first letter but I’m sure you guys have something very unique planned
the funny thing is i am on my laptop lying on my bed to so I thought it was so funny when she said hello lay with me lol
Obviously zero pressure and expectation, you are pregnant and your body decides schedule, but I'm so excited to find out what the blood test shows and also so excited to see what JoJo comes up with to announce it. So now I'll be thinking about that waiting for the video to drop at some unknown time in the future. The suspense is so high! xD
Rachel her sister is gay and Rachel shaded the Target pride clothes
Girl, you need to eat some protein and not so many simple carbs. The shaking will likely stop and the starving will lessen.
I’m so grateful for moms of twins. They literally go through pain TWICE to push two babies out! That would be so discouraging for me, so you’re so awesome!! I hope all goes well for you!! Get that epidural lol. Let me know if anyone else went through this because I’m curious
Omg Flynn is hilarious.He really said "Ice cream....I just said it."😂😂😂😂
I love puppy chow! ❤️
I love the idea of names that go together! I used to know boy and girl twins named Levi and Rose :)
If you have two boys, one of my favorite names for twins is Brayden and Connor.
Pregnancy pillow...seriously best thing in the world...
Girlll you do you but you eat to much sugar that could be why you gain more weight❤️🤔
I’m in a bus to go to Mexico and I’m just seeing your videos
Watermelon was my go to. Highly recommend when nauseous.
i am so friggin excited to meet these babies omg🥺🥺
I literally eat a full meal like every 2 hours and snacks all the time this pregnancy or I get a headache and feel sick which I can tell is my body being hungry and having low blood sugar even though I don’t feel hungry so I feel you. My other two I was to sick to eat more than like 1 maybe two meals a day.
Colleen, try to eat protein, even if it's a little when you're eating sweets. Sugar will jack up your sugar and make you feel better, but it will make your sugar bottom out too. Even the carbs in the bagel turns to sugar. Protein will help to keep it level. I think that's why you get so shakey. The same thing happens to me unless I'm eating some sort of protein when I want a treat.
Theres definatly at least one boy in there because im pregnant woth my first boy and had similar cravings
😭him so grown up....him singing the tea pot song, oh my heart🤗😍...if 1 boy name after ur grandpop🙏
I ate so much when I was pregnant and only gained 10lbs! 6 of which were my son! Eat your heart out girl! Love you!
Colleen pregnant coffee Flyn no milk
He said uh oh I spilled it I was like awe I love him 😂
Ok so as a csection momma I giggled when you said that csections terrify you, because I'm scared if the idea if a vaginally birth lol.  Also, watermelon has been a life saver for me too this time around Nausea wise and also is a good way to help with constipation.
hi! my mother is also pregnant roght now..and its also the same as yours! she gets hungry every time btw she only has one baby in her but she gets sooo hungry!! so dont worry!
Hey Colleen! As a proud mother of triplets I totally understand what you are going through! Multiples are the best and would love to chat about my experiences. One of my triplets is now a HUGE fan so much to share. BTW almost got into a big fight with hospital as inpatient for high risk pregnancy for not giving me enough FOOD so I totally get it. Even with triplets, I left hospital only 5 pounds more than when I was pregnant. My ultrasound also initially showed twins but one of them split. Looking at your ultrasound, possible triplets?😍
my friend who is 5 months is the same way. She feels extremely sick when she isn't eating so she literally has to keep snacking all day long just to function. Its awful lol. Also she throws up terribly just like you. I feel so horrible for her  not even meds work. You are not alone!
I was hungry like that in my pregnancy if I was hungry or needed water I'd shake  I would get sick though if I ate over a limit but needed to eat sooner
U are amazing!!!!!!!
Flynn’s singing voice is so good! It’s so cute, he’s taking after his parents so much!🥺
Am I wrong when I say that I’ve heard that pregnant women need to consume 6000 calories a day?? Like it makes sense cause your body is CREATING A HUMAN (or two or three) and also keeping up with your own health and nutrition
It’s almost 11pm,I’m sitting in bed watching this while eating ramen. You say you’re craving puppy chow and start making it..and I’m like “Hmm...I want some puppy chow..wait..am I pregnant?🤔”😂 I actually might be,I’m making an appointment with my doctor tomorrow to find out. Lol
I’m getting surprised and more surprised by this pregnancy 😐
Hi Colleen I totally saport you
You should do more marinda vids plzz
My mom had three C-sections, starting an emergency one that saved my life and hers. You’ll do great if you need to have one!
Girl you needa better diet
Please pleas
on your main channel, you should do a baby names we loved but aren’t using, once you decide names
Y’all should check out the pride collection at Akira! The clothes are actually pretty cute
Another thing that helps nausea is dark chocolate  and for me cold peaches
You need to have meals instead of snacks
Colleens pride song made my gay heart happy❤🧡💛💚💙💜
Omg I just remembered. Do u guys ever church up cookies?? lol
I don't know if it's true but maybe u can try it. I heard smelling oranges and eating them help when you have morning sickness and it's supposed to work like the jolly ranchers but idk.
I also felt faint if I didn’t eat all the time. My glucose was amazing, I gained 30-40 pounds and my baby came out at 6 pounds 🥴
Who loves that she supportsLGBTQ🏳️‍🌈 🏳️‍🌈 🏳️‍🌈 🏳️‍🌈! :D
Flynn singing the Little Tea Pot song was so cute and was the highlight of my day
I was sooooooo excited to see the Pride section at target. Like I absolutely get that a lot of the clothes are terrible BUT I was so excited to see it being normalized. I know people go after corporations for trying to make financial gain from the gays without actually supporting them, but even stuff like pride merch at these major stores makes a positive difference in normalizing the community and making people feel more comfortable to be out and proud. But those are just my thots
Watermelon melons almonds cashews
Everyone needs a Flynn in their lives. Little kids like him could change peoples lives. I know my baby brother (he’s 2) makes me the happiest person on earth.
can you please do a what i eat in a day while pregnant?
me too!!!!
Lauren from the bachelor, is pregnant with twins and she is also constantly eating!!!!
Rachel made a video of Target awful Pride clothes. Lol 😂
Hi. I’m hoping one is a girl   2 “looks like white dots” are possibly the baby girls pelvic bones yay would be great one girl one boy. Fingers crossed.
colleen watch Anne with a e
5:41 🤣🤣 he is so dramatic and it’s adorable 🥰 🤪
can someone PLEASE explain her bangs. I Am  So  CONFUUUUUSED Sometimes they’re there, and sometimes they’re not. Help.
if you aren't feeling jolly ranchers at the moment any hard candy helps with nausea so like butterscotch or lifesavers
When she sang legally blonde ✨💖YES💖✨
ive been watching colleens vlogs so much that I literally had a dream that I was pregnant last night LOL
I could watch that into FOREVEEEEEEER
When flynn started singing i died that was the CUTEST thing in the world i died and i hope everyone reading this is good and happy right now
Non pregnant human here who also gets shaky when I eat a bagel!! Doctor told me it has to do with the way your body may process carbs (simple sugars that quickly hit your bloodstream). Fiber and protein and complex sugars may help you feel full - without the scary shaking ❤️
When are you going to do the Miranda is pregnant video on her channel
The shakes is from a blood sugar issue… bagel, pop tarts, grapes…. CARBS = SUGAR. SUGAR = SUGAR. You need a bore balanced diet.
<3
It would prob help if you had some protein instead of or at least with the carbs. Bagel, pop tart and crepes are all carbs try throwing some protein in the mix I bet it helps!
We have popsicles in my house now and it reminded me of my homemade slushie that I made once and loved, and now I've been making them everyday.
Eat it all Mama! You are growing 2 humans plus all the things that grow with that!
The shaking sounds like low blood sugar to me. That happens to me when my blood sugar is too low. Honestly some juice or something with sugar content fixes it. Maybe that will help on the times that you are too nauseous for a meal!
What about Miranda for a girl and mathias for a boy idk?
Pregnancy cravings video
✨Francesca and Tweed✨  😂😂
People need to leave her alone about her pregnancy weight-gain. Before she had Flynn she was very UNDERweight, so the 70lbs was just exactly what she needed for her body to make Flynn. Also if her body tells her to eat then she should because, ya know, she's making TWO HUMANS with her SMALL BODY! 🙄
omg Colleen wth 🥴🦋🤍
Hey just saying that we call them Muddy buddies not puppy chow hahah idk tho Colleen is always right
I'm a C-Section baby as well.
I’m excited
Girlll eat whatever you want
The jitters even though you’ve eaten: 🥯 bagel, pop tarts, 🍇 bunch of grapes before noon.  Extremely gentle reminder to attempt to get some *protein* in there for growing baby bits n parts- *building blocks* for constructing *two*  little human beings 🥰  With that said... I know you are dealing with consistent monster nausea and vomiting- so this is not some finger wag or guilt- just *IF* and when you can- add some protein for your blood sugars-jitters will be better if you don’t have carbohydrates crashing on ya and a little protein will just balance alllllll out. Annnnnd not to worry you but hopefully soon you’ll get your sugar test to rule out chances of gestational diabetes. I only bring that up because my daughter had same symptoms with two pregnancies and it goes away when she’s not.
I love how Flynn is playing with “girl toys” he is so sweet and smart. Toys should not have genders or be geared toward certain genders. Great job Colleen and Erik!!
When it comes to corporations, not necessarily Target, they often times use Pride Month to profit off of. Which is called “Corporate Pride”. They typically don’t have actual policies in place to hire, help support, and fund LGBTQ+ organizations. They simply through on a rainbow and call it a day. While, of course, it’s a great thing that we’ve come far to be proud, many companies also use this statement in the month of June. After that, what’s Pride? Who’s she? And much of their “representation” of the LGBTQ+ community is very stereotypical. With gay men being extremely feminine and what not (as an example)
Omg my name is Francesca ! Haha lol
❤
Flynn can speak so well!!!
I'm a twin and I was born through c section
Colleen: im so exited i get to see if there is a boy in my body!!!!!!! tomorrow me: omg im so exited i have no school tomorrow its the last day!!!!!                              guss tomorrow is a speshal day lol
I'm a twin and I was a seasection and our names are Avery and Addyson girl and girl and so we have the same letters
You could do something like names that have double letters(looks cute on paper plus double babies and double letters 😉) for example: Connor and Quinn
When you mentioned how C-sections have saved a lot of lives, I totally related to that. The umbilical cord wrapped around my neck three times when I was in my mom's stomach; while that was going on, my heart rate was constantly going down. Without C-sections, I wouldn't be here typing this comment today.
What would you do if you were having 3 baby
Girl I'm the exact same with my pregnancy with eating! I have to eat every two hours or so or I get faint and shake a bunch. It's apparently really common!
Colleen I love your videos! Also I haven't been able to look at your other videos :( but congrats on your twins!!
She looks so good
I'm a little relived that Colleen isnt having triplets because if she was, I would be scared to death for her.(but if she was, I would still be happy for her)
Omg u have to try puppy chow popcorn it is bomb it’s basically puppy chow but with popcorn it is sooooo goooodddddd!!!!
نتي جميله ونتي حامل بطن كبير وجميلة
My mom does stuff for learning resources and she was so exited to see glom open a learning resources toy
can we all agree that coleen is the most amazing youtuber out there. she amazing and so genuinely kind and strong
Can you do another pregnancy cravings video?
Flynn is so smart and cute. I can’t
Your body is doing an incredible amount of work to grow those babies and you need to eat to have the energy. You're doing great!
Queen eat all you want. I'm a twin and my mom always ate. Don't apologize for it. :)))
Oh my goodness Colleen, once again CONGRATULATIONS 🎉!! So happy for the twins to come 😁! Also I could listen to your intro with Flynn’s voice on repeat!! Sending much love 💕
The tea party was just..  😭🥺🥰
I completely understand your point about the pride clothes. 🌈 Appreciate how far we have come and recognize how far we still have to go. 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️ Sending you all the support and love in my heart to help you get through this tough pregnancy. ❤️(Lastly, I would LOVE a mini van tour😁)
wondering how Miranda will take the twin news?!!!!🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Great blog today
flyyn It's chocolate ice cream  Erik what is it Flynn chocolate ice cream I just said it  🤣🤣🤣🤣I watched it like 10 times and every time it makes me laugh
I wished big companies were really trying to make people in the lgbt+ community feel accepted and represented, if they were trying they would donate, but they are just trying to profit and capitalize from pride month without doing any of the actual activism
So my sister is in the last couple weeks of her pregnancy (I’m so excited to be a first time aunt!) The doctor told her that she shouldn’t gain anymore weight. I haven’t been blessed with kids yet but don’t you gain your most weight during your last weeks?
For some weird reason I have never heard it called puppy chow. I call it nutter butter. is that weird am i weird?
OMG when you said TWEED my todler cousin makes me watch the lorax so much its a good movie but omg TWEED as a name i feel like could either be cool or HEAVILY bullied
show us the mini van pls!!!!!
I got the Target Ally shirt for Pride month! I love it and I got several compliments and a thank you today! 😎❤🧡💛💚💙💜😎
Name ideas: Rosie Hannah Milly Indi
You are looking so happy Coleen 🤗😍🤗
5:40 The sass lol I love flynn
The foods you listed have no protein in them. Somethings with protein may keep you satisfied longer 😊
Only OBGYNs put a weight cap on. I was a skinny little thing at 5'9 and 133 pounds when I got pregnant with my first. I gained 99 pounds and my midwives were so sweet about it. They told me that my body is doing what it needs to and that its okay to gain weight. My baby was born naturally, a very healthy 10.1 pounds and I was only 20.
Who?
Screw what other people say, do what your body tells you and make sure you’re eating something from every food group/ as many different types of nutrients as possible bc you are literally growing humans. Eating through out the day is normal especially in pregnancy (especially with twins), don’t let others discourage you. Eating as much as possible seems like the best thing for your body if you’re shaking from hunger.
Flynn is just too cute!!!!!!🤩🤩
You are one of my favorite Youtubers and I just want you to know you’re going through a really hard thing and you doing amazing
How about instead of the name rhyming, the first letter should be the same letter, like Richard and Rebecca, Frank and Fatima
Why is nobody talking about how cute Flynn is in the intro
Imagine if there actually was triplets tho 🥺
Hi
"I just said it" YASSS FLYNN 😫❤👏
when flynn started singing  😭💗💙🥰☺️😊😂😛🤣  HE’S SO FRICKEN CUTE
Meal prep!!!
Me when I see the tittle: OMG 🥺🤯🤯🤯
Ask your doctor about blood sugar issues! When ever I get shaky my blood sugar is low and I need to eat gummies
on Emily D Baker's channel she has a pride merch line....she is a lawyer so they lean a little to the law but there are paw ones (for animal people) too to celebrate pride.  Check it out
Ummm are Colleen’s eyebrows different sizes?
I haven’t been watching you in some time but I just realized how much I missed you 😁🥰❤️
I want a minivan so badly!
I was just listening to legally blonde the musical today!!
When people correct the term "eating for 2" and say "no you actually aren't" it's because it just means in terms of portion size. You should always keep your "regular" healthy portion size for meals even during pregnancy. Over eating will cause worse heart burn and sometimes gain weight too quickly. But the cravings are reeeeeeal I had to snack all day or I thought I'd die.
Sonographer here. The second structure people are thinking is the triple is actually what’s called a yolk sac. It is what sustains baby until the placenta is formed. Just anatomical things✌🏼
hi colleen! we recently did a cover of your song, (the one where you said you wrote a song about how you see yourself through someone's eyes!).  it would mean the world if you checked it out!! the video is in our channel, and we wish you the best! 💕 and we hope you like it🥺🥺
Is twins already in your family?
You sooooooo good for being pregnant with twins, like miss.girl
Flynn is so smart!!
You should give them names that have the same meaning or meanings that go together. That way the names can be completely different but you know they “match”.
Hey Colleen, you're doing an amazing job with these twins and taking care of Flynn. You are an inspiration to so many. ❤️ I remember when you did the pregnancy cravings video with Kory, and maybe when you get further along in your pregnancy and feel better, you could do one with your cravings this time around? Love you, you're amazing. ❤️
Omg! Flynn is hilarious!
Coleen literally has a jack in the box song on the miranda channel lol
I think Flynn is one of the cutest children I have ever encountered
Lemon jolly ranchers are the best... they’re on Amazon (I believe they stopped being produced a few years ago). Totally awesome for nausea!
Leave Colleen be, she is pregnant so she needs to eat to make/produce them babys that are in her stomach. 🤰
I like Fiona and foster as baby names
girl twin names that are good is (Ava and Chloe)
Oh my goodness I love your intro so much
Everyone: talking bout how she isn’t giving triplets Me: let’s take a minute to appreciate her lgbtq+ freestyle song 😏
colleen please please please make a mukbang with trish
Ultrasound tech/OB Sonographer here. Just to add to the ultrasound photos. In early pregnancy there is something called the yolk sac that is seen with each baby. Some people think that’s a second baby but it’s not! :) It just provides nutrients to baby until their placenta forms.
*dies*
You should have a Psychic come read for you babies again
I predict a boy and a girl
WHY did you buy a minivan when there are so many amazing SUVs??
Awwwww omg the tea party was adorable I love when Flynn pickles stuff from the box
Have you tried frozen watermelon 🍉😋
hahahahahaha good luck girl!
I am a twin my name is Karlee Silena and my twins name is Tyler James.I was a normal birth not a c section.My mom was and still is a brave worrier.I was born the wrong way.When my brother came out I flipped because I had so much room.And the scary part is that I swallowed too much liquid.So please be careful Colleen
Colleen Flynn is a singer. I can hear it is his little voice I can’t wait to see him grow
Colleen is such a strong woman😊😍💛
Protein Protein Protein!! A bagel, pop tarts and grapes are sending you blood sugar levels sky high and then crashing hence the shaking.
HAHAHHAHA MAMA THE LAST PART  ur literally Miranda Sings  just admit that Colleen is a character JK
It's funny when people say the baby is hungry lol, no, your body is growing a person/people and needs more fuel. For an "average" weight person they say like 20-30lbs is "normal", however if you're considered under weight by medical standards it may be necessary to gain more to ensure a healthy place for baby to grow, so said my Dr when I was pregnant.
love u colleen but capitlism is taking advantage of pride which is why everbody hates it, they don't support us only pretend to, and then make money of us
I love you ♡♡♡♡♡♡
Amazon pride collection was the best so far!!! LOL
Yes I too was told with all 5 of my kiddies gain 30 ya ok gained 40 happy pounds lol doctors they know not much I had Midwives with all my pregnancies loved them they didn't nag just the docs wheneva I'd see them .  Coffee ewww Flynn is adorbs and so smart love the way he talks my goodness powdered sugar on her sweatshirt lol love it oh I remember my pregnant days . I gotta try that puppy chex yummmmmm.
You should check the chatwins channel, this supper skinny girl had triplets🥺❤️ you are going to be such a great momma of three🥰
awww when colleen was talking about pride month was so amazing! have an amazing day! stay proud and be yourself!💗
You need the extra energy when you’re making those babies! u need the extra food
Awww! Pretending to spill it!?!? Are you kidding. He’s so cute!
Why didn't you post the importance of memorial day?! Not surprised, democrats don't care about the people that sacrificed everything!
I can’t believe he’s two, he’s just so grown up :((
The puppy chow part omgggg I just had puppy chow today because of you Colleen!!
😱 3 baby 👶👶👶 congratulations 🎉
Colleen’s pregnant appetite literally sounds like my normal appetite
You know..... There's something I've noticed since Flynn was born but never commented.  There are so many parents who claim that they are obsessed with their children and they act like they are perfect parents. You can tell that their kids aren't used to their parent(s) acting the way they do on camera. The exact opposite of that is true for these parents. It's obvious that they really are obsessed with Flynn. They are great parents and even when they struggle, they talk about it. I was so sad when she was saying she never wanted to get pregnant again because of the trauma from Flynn's pregnancy. A few months ago, I knew she was open to getting pregnant again. Having personally gone through several losses, I was worried that she may decide that she couldn't take the risk of another loss. I am so happy for them. Their babies are super lucky!
Giiiiiirrrrlllll you need hella protein in ur diet! Gotta build those babies!
Sassy Flynn is coming hahahaha
OMG!!!!!
If there is a girl you should name her Gabriella, Gabi for short or Jasmine, for short  jazzi and for a boy Lorenzo is really cute
Flynn's singing is so cute😍
I want to try to have my Twins through my HOLE !!!! Lol 😂 I died laughing !!!! Wow Colleen 🤪
I call Puppy Chow Muddy Buddies
I get this. I liked Elijah for a boy and Elizabeth for a girl. When I found out I was having both I gave up Elijah and chose Henry because Elizabeth is a family name. So they are Henry and Elizabeth. I didn’t realize this someone mentioned it that it was royalty and I wasn’t planning on it. Lol
When I was pregnant I was always starving! I would eat snack in between breakfast lunch and dinner 😂 I bought a bigger lunch bag for work
im screaming at the fact that as I'm typing this comment Colleen knows the genders already EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK
How come there is no s for straight people
This is my first pride as a lgbtq+ member and I was so excited to see merch for pride as I walked through target!
I'm glad I'm not the only one who calls it puppy chow
Bagel, pop tarts and grapes = NOT blood sugar stabilizing = shaky and energy crashes. Your insulin/blood sugar needs to be stable throughout the day to keep you from getting shaky and hangry. Starting the day with protein is super important! Sets you up for more stable blood sugar even if you eat the pop tarts later. That being said, I know it's hard when you feel sick amd you crave comfort foods and carbs,  but I would suggest finding a way to eat something like eggs, meat, yogurt (low sugar), nuts...something high in protein and then try eating the carbs. Your blood sugar will thank you💕
It doesn’t matter so much the amount of food you eat, but the amount of energy your body is able to get from that food.   *TW I’m going to mention specific foods, gag at your own risk*   I.e. if you were to eat a whole bunch of cookies, let’s say your body would be able to use 40% of each cookie as fuel to help power your cells and grow your babies. If you were to eat a sweet potato let’s say your body would be able to use 70% of a sweet potato as fuel. In order to get the same amount of fuel/energy from cookies as you would from a sweet potato, you would need to eat more cookies. Because the cookies are a simpler carbohydrate you would need to eat again much sooner to maintain the glucose that your cells are using. A more complex carbohydrate may last your closer to 3 hours.     It sounds like you might be experiencing low blood sugar. From the foods you’ve listed you’re consuming a lot of “simple” carbs. This is not a bad thing, it just means your body can put that fuel to use easier and faster than other carbs. Low blood glucose makes me either very nauseous and confused or ravenous and dazed. Either way I’m a little foggy lol. Your body tells you it needs more fuel ASAP when your blood glucose levels are reduced and your instinct will be to have more simple sugars because they get the job done quick. This is all further complicated by your inability to tolerate the idea of most foods due to your pregnancy. When possible, it would help to combine your simple carbs with something fibrous or to swap for a more complex carb.
My parents said they never realized my twin and I have the same initials lol I’m AK and she’s AK lol my name was last minute cause I was expected to be a boy my parents wanted to name me Rory but they changed it to be suited for a girl even though Rory is a girl name my mom just didn’t like it as much as my dad did but she really liked Aurora so that’s my name and Rory is my nickname, also we were a c section and my mom had a good experience with us so if you have a c section don’t worry you will be ok
tweed lol
I bought one of the pride shirts from Target admittedly because as widespread as pride is now, it's still very rare for me to find something with my flag on it. So -- yeah, it might not be the cutest, but I'm stupidly excited to have something that represents me.
I love just the photos of Miranda on the walls
I feel like the issue with big corporations putting out pride lines is that they are profiting off of other peoples struggles without changing the oppressive system causing their struggles or donating to orgs to help. Representation is great! But the issue goes deeper than how cute the clothes are!
YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR YOU MIGHT HAVE PREGNANCY DIABETES
i just want to have a whole conversation with flynn he’s adorable 😂❤️
It’s great that we are seeing more support and normalizing LGBTQ+ nowadays! I do remember the days when it wasn’t normalized. But that’s just it. It’s society (specifically trans POC!) that’s normalizing the community and speaking up for it. It’s not like these corporations are taking a big stand by selling pride themed things. Many of the big companies profit off of the merchandise more than they donate to LGBTQ+ organizations. The reason a lot of people are mad is because now that there are enough people in society that are accepting of the LGBTQ+ community, companies decide to support it too because they will make a profit off of it. They only take a stance when it’s financially beneficial to them. We’re not saying stop selling pride things. We’re saying stop profiting off of our community when they have the resources to be donating A LOT more and doing a lot more for those in need.
Bottom line, if you are hungry, eat
It’s because the the food is going threw the tube and it’s going to them if that makes sense so you usually have to eat like a meal for 3 people then you won’t fell hungry
Cam someone tell me what puppy chow is?
Btw ima sesection baby but I'm if that's how it's spelled
Remember when Colleen did trying out kitchen products and she got that thing for pickle jars and it has a fork in it and she said when I’m pregnant I will use thing and here she is.
Nobody shame her because my step mom gave birth to twins and she ate ALOT
Hey why should she be ashamed about talking about her pregnancy it’s exciting and frick if you don’t like that there is many other you tubers so Colleen keep doing you boo
Taylor and Jordan would be good names cause they can be both boy/girl too
I have friends that are named Miriam and Lily and   Kairavi and kirtana
Please look up rainbow capitalism, Big  businesses selling gay pride merchandise is    not revolutionary it’s just businesses attempting to profit off of the LGBTQ+ community
My father was a iidentical tiwn and his mom name the Richard Leo and Leo Richard
yall give her a break she's making two babiesss
Flynn is so precious!! I can't wait to meet the twins 🤍
My mom is pregnant and she can't lay down without a pillow between her legs
The problem with those large companies putting out Pride clothing and items is that they are benefiting from a symbol that the represents a marginalized group and large corporations like that are not giving back to the LBGTQ+ community. The community has worked very hard to make that symbol mean something and now large companies are capitalizing on that symbol and not giving back to the community that has literally died for it. I totally get where you are coming from! It’s great that the rainbow is so positive and available for everyone to enjoy but that does not mean it’s okay for large companies that capitalize off something and not give back to the community they are ripping off! Love you just trying to educate.
Happy pride month
I get jittery really easily if I go too long without food. I end up eating closer to 4 times a day rather than 3. And I'm not pregnant. Every body is different, and there's no way you can judge people based on an average or a standard when you don't know how their body works. Colleen, if you gain 100 pounds by the end of this pregnancy because it's what your body needed to produce 2 beautiful babies, thats absolutely amazing. Some women may gain more, some less, and some may even lose weight. As long as the baby is born healthy and both mom and baby feel happy and healthy there's 0 harm in whatever happens to your body to get you both there! I hope whatever happens this pregnancy you know you're doing what you need to do and maintain the attitude you have about it because it's truly inspiring and a beautiful way to look at things.
Leave name ideas below!
I loved this intimate conversation at the end of the video. I feel like we should ask you How are you down there? Comfortable?
Sooo NO ONE is gonna point out that picture of Ariana Grande and Colleen in 2:02 oh… ok. 🥲
Who tf says you’re not eating for 3? YOURE GROWING HUMANS WITH TOUR BODY.
About pride collections; look up the term rainbow capitalism. Very interesting concept where pride collections are put out by companies really as a cash grab and not really in solidarity with or partnership with actual lgbtq+ voices/designers. It comes off as tone deaf and pandering.
girl:                     boy: -Jessica                -Jude -Kinlee/Kinsley    -Kaleb  -Harley                  -Cherish -Moly                     -Mylo -Kayla                    -Kalep -Jules.                   -Jack -Jazlyn/Jax          -Jake -Caitlin                  -Carter -Ellie                      -Elton  -Ollie                     -Tate -Rosie                   -Rocky       Colleen, I hope for the best with your pregnancy and wanted to give a few names for your children, hope you like them!
Happy pride mouth! 💗💚💙!
Watching colleen eric and flyn playing with the teapot and teacups was so cute.   My heart
my mom had all of her kids with c sections don't worry she said that it wasn't painful and all of us turned out fine!!!!! love you, you got this, you are so amazing. ❤
I can't wait till the twins are born! And Flynn's reaction!
You eat as much as your babies need! Every pregnancy is different and unique
Have you checked your blood sugar? I get shakey when my sugar is low
i know that it’s great that now there are pride clothes, but what a lot of people are upset about is that companies profit off of pride month by slapping a rainbow on things but then they never actually support the lgbtq+ community in other ways such as donating or advocating for it. that’s not allyship. there are some companies that do, but like... yeah i’m not the most educated to talk about this. it’s just that they’re just activating performatively and it’s harmful.
The lord was like this lady had a miscarriage GIVE HER 2 BABIES TO MAKE UP FOR IT
wait your having triplets not twins i need to know
Bagels, pop tarts and grapes are all quick-release carbs that don't keep you full for very long, even if you're not pregnant. I think the shakes are from hypoglycaemia (=low blood sugar) that follows after a sugar spike is over. To prevent the shakes, try eating some protein and fats with every snack / meal. Proteins and fats help keep you full for longer.
I need to make a mental note about the cold watermelon when I am pregnant later on in life!
Alex and Bailey, Samuel and Carter, Bexley and Liana
I love flynn’s intro🥰
I didnt have kids.i guess I couldn't  have any.i wanted 4.But it's ok it just wasnt meant for me to have any.
Colleen thank you for posting you’ve gotten me through my hard times
You should have them check to see if you are nondiabetic hypoglycemic. I had similar problems when I was pregnant, and went through 3 pregnancies not knowing.
Colleen: Everyones throwing shade on pride clothes Rachel: ;-; *Rachel has left the chat*  Edit: bro I'm famous also I love the replies lmao
She just eats snack food all day
I'm obsessed with Flynn's sas😭🤣
Yeah because you don't eat anything girl, pop tarts! Grapes, bagel, that is all sugar girl.... You need real food girl, eat lots of vegetables and protein protein, some lean chicken
My first baby I gained 21lbs. Second, 17lbs. Third, 35lbs. Forth, 60lbs. 😬
OMGGG
Had our boy girl twins in April! We didn’t want the matchy names either, we have Rylee & Arlo!
I have mixed feelings about rainbow clothes at big chains. I feel like they’re just capitalizing on pride, but like you said it’s great they’re doing it at all. Support queer creators!
a bagel and poptarts arent alot tho
GRANDMA NEEDS EGGS
I was the same! Not eating all morning until lunch and dinner but once I got pregnant, I have to eat or snack every 2 hours 😅😅😅
Lol@ Colleen thinking ANYONE talks about her. Lol
5:44 - you’re welcome. 😂
I love the LGBTQ+ community, my BFF is bi, and I think all the different identities and things are so cool!
THE LEGALLY BLONDE LINE YES
I saw the title and I was like wait what
flynn is the sweetest, cutest most happy and smart little baby i’ve ever seen i can’t wait til i have my own little angels❤️
Can't wait for the gender reveal. Also Flynn singing I'm a little tea pot and changes the drink randomly to also food is so cute.
I’m 6 weeks pregnant and I’m constantly hungry and also constantly nauseated so life sucks right now
Colleen your jittery issue could be because everything you just mentioned eating is high in sugar or carbs that turn into sugar. You need protein. Lots of protein and calcium and vitamins and minerals. You're body is exhausted carrying a baby and you're carrying two honey you have to put better fuel in your system. You may be having blood sugar in balance from all of this. Go to your doctor and get your blood sugar tested. This is no judgment by the way. Lots and lots of concern and love.
I’d kill for Colleen to be my mom I’m currently “in the closet” because I don’t think my mom or bio dad will be too happy that I’m part of the lgbtq+ community imagine if Flynn or one of the twins or multiple of her children came out imagine how supportive she would be towards them 😩 I wish I could feel that comfort know that my mom would be supportive of me
So why does Flynn have blonde hair but yet his parents has brown hair I’m confused?
the seasick bands stopped working for me because my brain started equating those bands with being sick lmaoooo
Oh my word, I haven’t been able to watch her videos in like a month, I listen to the intro in the beginning and I replayed it like 5 times, so friggin CUTE!!!
I got the notification and my hand flew to my mouth
I was 98ish lbs before pregnancy. I was 175 before I gave birth. 2 hours after I gave birth I was 145. I am now 110lbs. 8 years later. Pregnancy MADE me hit 100lbs. I was always under 100lbs.
I laugh so hard at the random transition “😏hello lay with me”🤣😭
waiT A DAMN MINUTE...this beautiful woman is eating for herself and *TWO growing human beings* and people really have the👏🏽 *AUDACITY* 👏🏽 to judge her for how much she eats?!?!! WTAF, make it make sense!?!?   ...and this is the same woman that usually gets judged for being “too skinny”.....like come on! People need to mind their own business and spread more love! 💕
I have a question about pride month. Would I be a bad person if I don’t support them, but I don’t discriminate against them either. I have friends who are part of that community, but I just can’t say that I support them.
I can’t wait for the gender reveal! 💙💜
Miranda behind you when you were answering question looks like she is totally judging you 😅
Oh my gosh you should name them Miranda and Patrick
It's called a vaginal birth or a C-section.  One of my friends had one twin vaginally and then had a  c-section for the second one. They are both doing awesome! You'll do great, no matter what happens!!! XOXO
Im sobbing watching flynn sing the little tea pot song and hosting a tea party😭yall are the purest family ever
As a C section mama, it was scary! But afterwards, I honestly felt like a superhero. I kept telling my husband "I just had surgery-- AWAKE! They literally cut Gabe out of me and I was AWAKE! I am so hardcore!"  He did not disagree.   I was hoping to have a VBAC this time around, but my OB is wary because I am under 18 months since my last one. I am okay with that. I don't feel like I am going to feel so afraid since I have done it once.   I would say if you do end up having a C section,  just to listen to your doctor and don't be me--- REST!! No need to get up and move around until you can't function.  My husband had to help me shower a few times because I in a lot of pain from not being as cautious as I should have.
wait. so you're not having triplets?
As an SLP for kids I LOVE LOVE LOVE this tea pot pretend play time 🥰 this is amazing y’all are so wonderful at engaging with him and modeling language and play!
COLLEEN IM MAD AT YOU!!! you missed the perfect hamilton opportunity with todrick!!!! i literally sang “A MONTH OR SO...ELIZA YOU SHOULDVE TOLD ME” 😭😭😭
When my sister was pregnant they putrestrictions on how much she can only gain. I think it's because it will be harder for her to get the baby out/carry the baby  if she gains more.
Im shaky anytime I eat a poptart in general bahahaha
When I was pregnant with my daughter my sister in law kept saying that my ultrasound looked like twins every time I had a ultrasound she was one baby
What about Miranda being pregnant are u taking a break from Miranda?
Flynn is so precious 🥺❤️
I also found green grapes really helpful for nausea.
Your body is splitting nutrients between 3 people! Eat everything you want and need! And to everyone who isn't, I know sometimes it feels like you can't or shouldn't eat but you're allowed to and you're valid xx  I love Flynn's hot air balloon pyjamas!
During my pregnancys i just need to adjust how i eat. I eat every hour. A simple protein and simple sugar. Like a hard boiled egg and a piece of fruit. Ot helps immensely. Its your body adjusting blood sugar. So your body quickly blows through what you eat and your sugar drops. Happens to me all the time during pregnancy.
Ok Colleen you need to do another pregnancy photoshoot with Jessica
Hi Colleen,  My name is Marley F. I have watched all of your vlogs since COVID-19 started.  DAY 22 Since I heard you were reading comments I decided to write a comment every vlog you put out onto the internet. I’ll do this until you read one of my comments on your vlog. It would mean the world if you could respond to this.  VLOG TITLE: Rumors About TRIPLETS!   First I want to say thank you. You have helped me through this year. If you didn’t post your vlogs I don’t think I would be were I am today if it wasn’t for you. You are so inspiring and amazing. Btw your bangs look perfect on you. I am proud of you because you did something that was scary for you. I can tell your going to be a really good mom Colleen. Not that you aren’t a amazing mom now. 😂   I am feel safe opening up to you and the people in the comments. You are so comforting and so impactful on so many peoples lives. Including mine. To make a really long story short... My sisters help me too when I need to talk to someone. My parents don’t like me, they chose my little brother over me  I think I have depression and anxiety, but I am to scared to ask my parents to go and ask a doctor and see if I actually have it. My mom drinks at night and smokes 3 or more times every day.  My dad just goes along with everything. My brother never gets In trouble for anything and everything. I get punished for all his mistakes. Even if i have nothing to do with it.  You are amazing Colleen you need to give yourself more credit for being this amazing. You have helped millions and millions of people. I love you so much and I can’t wait to get tickets to your next live show. When ever that might be.  You have permission to share this with the internet.  Highlights from this vlog: 1.  Yes girl get that food in your body! You got baby’s they need food! You eating for 3! 2.  Flynn singing “I Am A Little Tea Pot” os to die for. If you ever have another Zoom live show please make Flynn be a special guest. And please please do Flynn singing with Miranda it will be the cutest most weirdest little thing ever! 3.  Flynn: “It’s chocolate Ice Cream!” Erik: “What’s in here?” Flynn: “Ice Cream” Also Flynn “I just said it” love that. PERIODT FLYNN PERIODT 4.  I love you little jingle about the LGBTQ+ Community and clowns... love that tho 5.  Can you please do more storytimes? They are my all time favorite videos (other then you vlogs of course)  I hope who ever is reading this has a amazing day, night, morning.
For some reason it’s coming to me so strongly that one of them will be a girl named Darcy, the names Flynn and Darcy  together sounds so nice
I have a twin brother and my dad wanted to name us Pride and Joy
My friend when she was pregnant  was the same..she carried snacks with her all the time!! She would get shaky if she didn't..love you colleen...I'm so excited for the babies ❤
We. Love you
That cute “uh oh....I spilled it” ✨🥺✨
You should try keeping your puppy chow in the freezer it’s so much better!!
In case you need a change from standard Jolly Ranchers, they came out with Tropical flavours: golden pineapple, fruit punch, lime & mango! I hope it's not only sold in Canada...
When my parents had me and my twin sister they went with one traditional name (After a great grandma) and I little more unique for me! We were VERY early though (c-section) so they didn’t have middle names picked out when we were born! Lol
Colleen!! I will literally go to the farmers market for you and get fresh carrots for you
my mom just made puppy chow
I ate half a watermelon every night when I was pregnant with my daughter. I was obsessed lmao I ate so much one night I got so bloated and peed myself
Ballinger family tea parties give me life 🙌🏽
Bro she’s literally so tiny, making two babies takes everything she has so she’s got to eat more to make healthy babies
How about Aubrey and Briley
You eat when you want girl
the title of this video FREAKED ME OUT but like in a good way
I love when she talks about her symptoms with her twins because I’ve always been interested in twins and stuff like that so it’s fun learning about it
But, like, it is dangerous to gain too much weight during pregnancy.  That’s why we have doctors to say that.
If you have a problem with eating lunch like early because your breakfast wasnt filling its not because your not eating enough, its the foods your eating  Like i know that rice balls with seaweed are really filling like i didnt eat till 3pm and i ate at 7am (this is not for pregnant women because i dont know how it affects your hunger as well)
It is my birthday month of June.  Flynn is the coolest.  I love how Flynn picks things.
So cute how Finn picked the teapot and then started singing the song
When she said she was going to make puppy chow I wass like ur making dog treats and realized that it was food for her lolz
Omg I’m like a few days behind you in my pregnancy & been loving watermelon too! And yes, gotta be cold!
Happy to hear you guys are already decided on names! I'm triplet, and we was born two months early (our father was out in sea when we was born/and that's another long funny story) and went for weeks without actual names except for X,Y, & Z, because there was already two other sets of triplets born without their names yet at the hospital named A,B,C & 1,2,3.
I am very proud of Flynn. He did an amazing job on the teapot song!
I am a twin and I hated always having to match!! We are Morgan and Megan lol
The contentttttttt and the amount of uploading is 💯
During my pregnancy I lived on Powerade since I didn't drink much water and fruity flavors from yogurt land because it was so hot and nothing ever sounded good.
Flynn’s pronunciation is SO GOOD
If you love cold watermelon I suggest going and getting the OutShine watermelon popsicles so so good it’s definitely my favorite this summer
1:41
shut up that shot of flynn with the magnifying glass
Let me tell you a family story, so my grandma’s cousin was having a baby and the day came and she went to the hospital. After some time finally she had the baby but... apparently it wasn’t over. There was a second baby in there. The entire pregnancy and so many ultrasounds they were never able to see the second baby. The way she was positioned was behind her twin so they just couldn’t see her. So anything is possible I guess lol. Apparently babies are good at hiding. Honestly it must of been the most amazing thing to happen.
💗💗
Its not eating for 2 or 3 bc its like I think only 400 of 600 calories per kiddo lol so it's still more breastfeeding, same deal it burns so many calories
Low key think Colleen wants to name her kids after Mary Kate and Ashley
If it is a girl and a boy name them Lucy and Oliver. My neighbors are named that.
Colleen:once we figure out what they are Me: honey they are 👶 👶what do you think they are aliens 👽   By no means am I trying to be rude but it was just so funny
Name ideas:  Girl and boy = Callie and Jasper  Boy and boy = Aiden and Ethan  Girl and Girl =  Isabella and Sophia
Im so happy for her that she seems to be in good spirits! 💗
I want to see u and JoJo Do a collab for PRIDE month!!
I was sooooooo hungry when I was pregnant!!! I dont care what the Drs say! I was eating for 2 totally!
your body is giving basically all the vitamins and nutrients it gets from food to your babies instead of too you. thats why your body wants you to eat more and thats why your shaking and feel like your going to pass out. no, eating for two ect isnt technically true but it is true in a way that you now need double or triple the amount of nutrients and vitamins you were previously giving your body. so yes eat what you want and who cares how much weight you gain as long as you are being healthy, your pregnant so obviously your going to gain weight, lol
I love how pickle has still stuck! I continue saying “oh my newness” even though Flynn says “oh my goodness” now!
One month later I’m having quadrooplets?
Flynn: it’s chocolate ice cream  Erik: what’s in here?  Flynn: ice cream...... I just said it   😂😂😂 Flynn is so precious
I am a twin and my mom had a c-section
You should try frozen watermelon to see if that also helps with your sickness!
LOL Rachel hated on the Target Pride clothes, and Colleen loved on them
Girl you’re eating for three but they’re consuming it fast. Your blood sugar will drop. You’re beautiful and tallk all you want about your pregnancy.
We shake our puppy chow in a bag am I weird??? 😂😂😂 I’ve never seen it shaken in a bowl.
Please do pregnancy muckbongs !
Colleen says her videos are boring but its literally the highlight of my night
Have you ever tried otter pops? They might be too sweet if you are nauseous it might not be good, but it is basically ice and it might help.
i love you so much
Colleen singing every 5 seconds is the BEST part of my day! Love you! 😘
I love the pride song. That should be the official pride song.
I was always hungry when pregnant but not so much when not.
What about sour mangoes? I live in Asia and most mother's when they are pregnant they crave mangoes
I feel like ur my friend.. like genuinely 🥺‼️
Flynn is so funny ".....i just said it......"
Watermelon with salt and lime! The best!
you make my day better sooo  much bc it was the last day of school for me and i was sad but this made my day
Colleen and erik are just the best parents
When are you due for the twins?
Flyn telling Erik that he just said it killed me 😂 so adorable
Question: Where are the babies going to sleep? Love u!
I think that people dislike the pride clothing is it feels like more a critique of the commercialization of pride rather than about them actually doing anything to support lgbqt+ in a real and meaningful way outside of making a profit off of them during pride month.
Girl if you have to have a C section don’t worry about it.  Once I had labor pains and then ended up having to have one anyways I was in love.  Lol I was like poo on all the pain and all that.  Give me some numbing meds and cut them suckers out.  Lol. I have had four c sections.  Three with births of my children and one cause of a tubal rupture from a tubal pregnancy.  That was pretty traumatizing but I had to be out completely to sleep for that cause it was a emergency surgery cause I had been bleeding internally for almost a week and my whole abdomen was full of blood.  Scary!! But with regular delivery it was great.  Yes a longer recovery but just a different recovery than normal delivery.  No Hoo Haa recovery just stitches recovery.  Love you.
when I hear Flynn Sing the intro is the favorite thing ever!
HAPPY PRIDE YALL
Im part or the lgbtq+ community and i saw the stuff in target it was so cute they had mini flags but my mom is homophobic :(
Who else thinks that she should make a new my family rap when the twins are born!
As a dietitian, I recommend protein with what you are eating to stabilize your blood glucose. Also eat for your hunger.
Just wanted to say for someone who never wanted to go through pregnancy again you sure are handling it like a rock star because I had that awful nausea and I really never want to go through that ever again your such an amazing mamma
Omg congrats that it triples or twins!!!
Food gives you energy. You’re pregnant with twins. They’re trying to get energy to grow. They’re taking your energy. You need to eat more to accommodate. Listen to your body and screw the rest of ‘em!
My friend has twins named Sam & Ella, so whenever she calls for them it sounds like "SALMONELLA!"
You are incubating mama! That drains you of nutrients and your body needs extra. Eat on!
Hope you do have triplets
Think about it this way. You might be eating for 2 or 3 or whatever the babies aren't even that big yet so how much could they need. Certainly you need a little extra but not massive amounts extra. But it sounds like you are mostly eating healthy things so who cares.  That said and it sounds like me. I'm hyperthyroid and that sounds like me all the time. Seconds away from shaking tired and hungry
9:30 COLLEEN YOU DID THIS LAST TIME ISTGGG
Well you’re eating enough to MAKE 2 humans.... so I say you need more than to be eating for 3 people
A wittle tea pot :3   My heart-
When do we see the Flynn reaction video?  Did I miss it??
I gained 60-70lbs when I was pregnant with my daughter Nova 🤷🏻‍♀️ I was back down to 110 only a few months after I gave birth (underlying health conditions limit my appetite etc, it's a long story). I felt zero guilt eating whatever and as much as I wanted when I was pregnant. As all pregnant women should! Follow the directions of your body, it knows what it's doing 😌 Oddly enough I had a TON of fluid around her so up until my water broke she could still do full flips and rolls. I am petite and always have been but my belly was HUGE and zero stretch marks o.o A little disappointed bc I was gonna tattoo them but oh well, it's also a blessing so I am grateful 😊
You should only add 300-500 extra calories to your normal diet when pregnant
Colleen:I'm sorry that's all I talk about  Me: OMG 😂😂
Sounds like you need protein too much sugar and bread.
I think these are sort of gender-neutral names but idk, Aloe and Vera?
Everest Mae Stocklin would be such a cute name if you had a girl!
The sound effects for the teapot tho. That is it. Sooo cute!!!
perhaps you need more protein, eat stuff that feeds the cells, carbs and sugars cannot sustain cell metabolism.
Flynn is so cute and funny when said I just said it
you’re doing amazing
I had a surprise c section and it was really scary. Perhaps it was because I didn't do enough research and didn't think it would happen to me, but it was hella scary.
re big corporations releasing merch for pride month: I totally agree that its incredible that we live in a time where we can be loud and pride (and I know I get so excited whenever I see pride collections irl), however, a lot of these companies are very performative and essentially only release a pride line in order to profit off of the community lowkey so that might be why you're seeing people talking bad about them
Colleen has given me baby fever so bad that I decided to finally take the leap and start trying for baby number 2!
So like- are we going to ignore how STUNNING  colleen looks like dang girl💕
Is anyone else exited to see the twins and Flynn grow up?? I am supper excited they are gonna be adorable I just know it!!!
If there 2 girls you should name them Paisley and Presley
Babe!  Find a protein!  You need protein!  Of course bagels, pop tarts and grapes. But please eat protein
Im convice you have phil and lil in your tummy 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
youre definitely eating for two. i dont know why they say that. when i get hungry, i get nauseous and it also feels like im SO hungry as if i havent eaten in 3 days. you keep eating and growing the babies
I have never seen that teaset before but it was 100% in my dream last night. What the actual F.
I feel you in the shakes! I ended up having to eat a diet similar to someone who is diabetic and very frequent. Otherwise I would dieeeee
You might have gestational diabetes. It’s more common with twins. I had it with mine
I don't want you to think worse of me but i don't support the lgbtq + community. I am not mean to them but i do think is their choice
I hope you have the psychic back. It was so cool how she was sooo spot on with Flynn! It'd be cool to look back and see if she was right about the babies!
the way flynn said “ i just said it” was priceless
💜💜💜
Omg flynn is too cute. I love him he reminds me of my kids awww.
I gained 80+ pounds during my first pregnancy. My goal is to not gain that much this pregnancy, but I like the thought of I will gain as much as I need to to grow my baby. I've stopped looking at the scale at appointments and I hid the one in the house.
about the whole pride section thing, its the fact that they obviously didn't consult lgbtq people about their designs, and also its the rainbow capitalism; its the fact that even thought they are so supportive, its only around for one month of the year
I was starving like that for the first three months of both my pregnancies . Eat what you want/need! 🍓🍔🥙🌮🍕
GIRL you are literally creating 2 whole human beings in your body rn girl eat what the hell you want
The shakiness could possibly be gestational diabetes. Just something to consider.
Lol lgbtq song  I be singing I’m Bi lol
As an ultrasound tech, obviously not seeing the babies live I can't say for sure, but there is a possibility that "second circle" in the second gestational sac picture is what's called a yolk sac at an off angle. This is what gives babies their nutrients until the placenta takes over. Each baby has a yolk sac at this stage so that is definitely an option or as Colleen said it could just be the angle that the photo was taken at and could be a piece of the baby.
Omg him playing with the teapot!! 🥺
HAPPY PRIDE MONTH EVERYONE!!!🌈 ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
I super love Flynn’s pouring sound effects!
Girl. When I was pregnant with my twins, I had the worst hunger pains. Fuck what anyone says. You snack away. Eat everything under the sun if it makes you feel better. Also, I ate all the time and I only gained 7lbs... with two babies. And my doctor had no concerns. Eat what you want! Worry about weight later
And can u name won of the baby’s kris please your choosing
Nooo eat as much as u need, your eating for 3!!!  PS I LOVE YOU
How long will it take to find out the genders just asking
Wow Cool 😀
Omggggg you got foood lolll feed them babies all you want none is shaming
It’s not gonna be like “Francesca” and “Tweed”... oh wait, that’s what we’re gonna name them
I’m sometimes a bit suspicious of big brands that release products for Pride, just because I just feel like they’re trying get a money-grab from us. I don’t buy these products unless they’ve explicitly said they’ll be/they have been donating to a foundation/charity/etc.
My mom had a horrible pregnancy with me (poor thing was a teen mom too) and she gained 80 pounds and everyone would preach to her how unhealthy that was but eating was the only thing that helped her not feel sick.
Nobody: Literally nobody: Colleen: *sings pride song* Also does anyone know if the pride festival/parade is happening in Houston, Texas this year?
I think we all know she should name the twins Francesca and Tweed
The babies are constantly taking your vitamins and nutrients so they can grow, of course you need to eat all the time. Your growing little people! ❤️
All I wanted in the beginning was COLD things. It had to be ice cold drinks. Soooo good. I didn't think about watermelon though. Sounds amazing
So I haven’t been keeping up with vlogs for a while and I come back and FLYNN IS TALKING ?!
I have always called those muddy buddys
Eat what you want...
Make sure your drinking enough water! Your body will act hungry, or give you signs and you think your hungry, when you haven’t drank enough water. So if you had just eaten but feel hungry...not all the time but sometimes you could just be dehydrated, your body tricks you. Just make sure your drinking enough water lovey, I don’t know anything about pregnancy, but I know that when you seem really hungry all the time, you may just be dehydrated☺️💖
the body knows if you need to eat and what you need. you're doing good, mama colleen. you know what's good for y'all.
Try eating more protein. It may help with the shakiness.
I smile every time I hear that cute intro 😊
I recommend  buying a cotton candy machine. You can put hard candies and joy ranchers in there it’s so fun but it gets hot so little hands keep away! Flynn could try the flavors and it’s really fun! Kids are cray cray for anything puffy and melty
Do you still talk to Arianna Arianna grande
Not speaking for everyone but in regards to company’s putting out pride products for the month of june, i’ve heard that some companies put out the pride stuff just to profit off of pride month but don’t actually support lgbtq+
I can relate to you so much about the weight gain because my mother in law would always ask me how much weight I have gained through out my whole pregnancy and she would make me feel bad about it. Then she would tell me that with all of her kids she only gained 20lbs with each
4:36 "uh oh, i spilled it!" omg🥺😹💖 5:44 "ice cream... i just said it..." the sass😹 omg he's growing up so fast
Ah yes! the indie band Francesca and Tweed 😍
Hey girl hey I love your hair you look very very pretty😁😁😁
at 6:50 in the video i thought the pillow was the wall and her leg was that skinney lol sorry who cares
I am just watching the first part but when I saw the title I was freaking out like what🤭
Flynn and the Little Teapot song just melted my heart!!  He's talking sooo clearly now!!  😍😍😍🎶🎶🎶🌈
Colleen just seems so much happier in recent vlogs, and it’s so great to see. I can’t wait to watch her family grow. Flynn will be the best big brother!
Flynn’s little singing intro always gets me, it’s so adorable!!! 🥰
OK BUT FREEZE WATERMELON ITS EVEN BETTER FOR NAUSEA
girly, ur belly is going to be GIANT
4:37 “uh oh I spilled it” PLEASE THAT WAS SO CUTE
hey colleen, you'll never see this but in case you do please don't raise the twins as the "same person" don't make them wear the same clothes, do that same stuff, etc. I know you prolly wont but just incase!
Has Flynn ever seen the movie Cars?? He would probably love it
When I was pregnant as soon as my stomach was even slightly empty I felt super sick and would get shaky so i constantly had to have atleast a snack with me. Gained between 50 and 60 pounds when I was only 90lbs to start with. If eating makes you feel like you're not gonna die eat away!!
I think and I THINK gaining alit of weight during pregnancy is bad because it might collide with the belaby and crush it somehow
Don't just put food in you, put REAL food in you. Meat, veggies, fruit. As unprocessed as you can get. Real food cooked. Spices as desired. Nourish your body.
Awww this video was so cute also can we adress the fact that colleen is the sweetest ever also sorry I proubly spelt that wrong 🏳️‍🌈❤️❤️❤️❤️ it  is pride month
Don’t listen to them, I agree I am the same and feel HUNGER! I don’t care about the weight and seriously good for you! I feel like your body tells you not a doctor!!!
Just some thoughts on twin names:  My mom named my brothers (twins) Miguel and Marc - But we always call Miguel, Mike.. So, essentially, it's Mike & Mark. My best friend is a twin and he and his brother's name don't start with the same first letter, but they both end in "ian" (i.e Adrian & Dorian.) Growing up, I had a set of girl twins who were my best friends, they were Maya & Kira.  Then of course, there are the Property Brothers whose names are Andrew (known as Drew) and Jonathan.  Of course there's lot's of different options depending on what you want to do.
When is Miranda gonna talk abt being pregnant w twins👀 no rush just wondering🥰
Omg if it’s triplets I will be so shook
Well I asked my mom if thats triplets because she had kids and she said its triplets
OMG COLLEEN!!! This is so exciting. I can't wait till I know the genders. I can't wait I will be giving you names.every day so please read my comments.
Eat protein!
'I do want to try and have the twins through my hole' 😂😂😂
It is funny how colleen was talking about videos making fun of pride clothes at target when rachel did a video a few weeks ago buying the pride clothes at target and making fun of them🤣 I am not hating at all just thought it was funny.
I ate a whole watermelon a week with my first
I think colleen is having quadruplets I have a feeling she is
Girl: Gracie Boy: Liam
Your awesome Colleen!!!!!
Coleen girl get uses to it it’s not gonna be like how it was with flinn your going to be so much more hungry sense your growing 2 babys
Omg I love your vibe so much💗!
Make puppy chow but with captain crunch instead! So yummy!!!
Pregnancy vlogs are my new obsession
Who else loves when Flinn says I’m Colllllleeeeeen! You should keep that
My city has made its first safe space for lgbtq youth today it was amazing ribbon cutting ceremony.
It’s muddy buddies not puppy chaw
Here queen👑👑👑👑
If I ever have twin girls I wanna name them Alaska and Atlas
I love your intro it is to cute and you are an amazing person
Wow I love Colleen so much. She makes me feel so much better because of how supportive of the LGBT community she is. I’m trans and love how much people not in the LGBT support it. Ima cry now 😔
Can you guys do a minivan tour? It looked awesome from Eriks IG post! Would love to see more if it! Also, sooooo excited for the twins! Can’t wait to see you guys grow!!!
Omg ice cold watermelon when you are pregnant is the BEST
who in the chat is lgbtq because i am
Hey, someone might've mentioned this but if you like cold watermelon I HIGHLY recommend putting a few slices on a popscicle stick and freezing them. It's DELICIOUS and such a fun Summer snack. Good luck with everything!!
If your bodies hungry, eat. Ignore people. You do you Colleen❤️
I think flynn he gets older would love those hair and makeup heads that have like that color changing makeup when you rub water on it
Aww Flynn is growing up so fast he’s sooooo cute!
i’m a twin and about the name thing my name is serenity and my twins name is destiny! i like how the sound together but aren’t so similar.
Too many ads! Im just tryna watch ur vids but this is outrageous
Hi
That song was everything!
Reese and Ellie are cute Reese could be for a boy or a girl
I completely understand the needing to eat a bunch. I  was like that when I was pregnant with my son! I had to eat all the time or I’d be wicked sick and shaky! Maybe your twins or at least one is a boy!  Also Flynn singing the teapot is adorablllllllllle!!!! He is the cutest!!!!
It’s callled puppy chow!?!!!    I thought it was muddy buddies 😭
Who else thinks Colleen is going to be a mother icon when she has 3 kids!!! Btw Colleen you are a queen!
It has to be two boys remember that psycic from awhile back?? Yeaaa
Watermelon helps people dealing with nausea from chemo too!
If you get sick often you are not eating as many calories as you think.  Your body is also probably trying to pack on the needed weight to support 2 babies full term. Eat! I like eating for 2 and I am not pregnant!
Does flynn ever have a fit? haha
i feel u am hungry all the time too with all this nausea ... am just eating a super heavy breakfast so i wont be hungry until lunch  i would do a smoothie because its easy on nausea just to drink something and big avocado toast with two eggs
♡♡♡
I love the sound Flynn makes when he’s pouring the tea!  Psssh.
She said “he” she could have mistaking it with Flynn, but it could mean one is a boy
You just said it is a boy
as far  as the pride clothing goes, for me it just feels icky to know that they're profiting off of the LGBTQ+ community when they actually don't care about us the rest of the year. They do this because now the tables have turned where it's not okay to not be accepting of us. Which is amazing, but it's very see through. And they think being gay is putting a rainbow on it and that's it. (Put a bird on it! portlandia vibes) I'm happy it's accepted but pride has felt somewhat stolen from the gay community by huge corporations, which is the complete opposite of what being queer is about.
Flynn just wins my heart ❤️ him singing I’m a little teapot even more! I can’t wait to see him be a big brother I mean he already is but see him with the babies ugh he well be the sweetest 😊❤️
WHAT TrIpLeTs
9:10 yes coleen!!!
“I spilled it.” 😂 Flynn has a great imagination!
Flynn with the tea pot 🥺💕🥰
As much as i love companies supporting pride, they arent doing it genuinely. It's all about the money. It's the same reason the larger non vegan companies are making vegan products now. They arent doing either that or producing LGBTQ merch out of the kindness of their hearts. They are only interested in making money and going into the areas that will make them that money.  It's good that its available though because I know that its not possible for everyone to support smaller LGBTQ creators merch because its super expensive usually.   Also I just make puppy chow from cinnamon toast crunch as I'm typing this lol
Oh my goodness
Protein protein protein! Helps so much with the jitters. Literally make chicken tenders as much as possible
Francesca and Twead😂😂😂
Yeah those docs and nutritionists can say "yOu OnLy NeeD 200 ExtRa CaLoriEs" but if I didn't eat significant more than my normal when pregnant, I would lose weight, and that wasn't healthy especially considering my starting weight. YOU are the one who knows YOUR BODY best.
Love Flynn’s hot air jammies! Where did you get them 🥰
When I saw you in the videos when you had Finn, I thought you looked very pretty. So whatever you gained looked good!
OKAY GLOWING MAWMAAAA 🥵😍
The problem with the pride clothes is that these companies only participate in rainbow capitalism and don’t actually do anything to support the community the other 11 months out of the year, only when they can make money. The least they could do is design clothes people actually will be able to wear
Flynn singing is the cutest! 🥰🥺
Maybe eating more protein/fruits/veggies throughout the day would help you? It’ll keep you fuller longer and keep your blood sugar more stable compared to those carbs and sugars. I also realize it’s hard to find what to stomach with your bad nausea....But If you don’t want advice that’s cool too I’m not telling u what to do just trying to be helpful 😭❤️
I had an emergency c section to save my son’s life. They had just broken my water and I was only 3cm dilated when the doctor came in and said my son’s heart rate was dropping too much and they needed to get him out. Within 30 minutes he was born. When they wheeled me to the OR I couldn’t stop crying or shaking because I was so scared. I thought for sure I was going to die and I kept praying to God to at least let me meet my son. Everything turned out fine but my gosh I was TERRIFIED. No one prepared me for the possibility of a c section so I didn’t know what to expect. I’m glad you are calm and open to it. That will help so much if you end up needing a c section or an emergency one.
Whoot whoot c-section baby also!! So true about it being able to save lives. The amount of babies out there that are at risk of not making it, but are saved by a cesarean makes me feel so thankful that that option is out there.
Is it the Kia minivan/SUV that went viral?
If the babies are girls what about the names oakley and autumn
She found out the genders today 😄
Francesca and tweed lmao
Flynn singing I’m a little teapot makes me want to be a mom I can’t do this colleen
Flynn should open up his own tea shop
When I was pregnant I didn’t have any cravings at all only food aversions :/  I couldn’t eat any meats 😩😩
my thoughts are this, pride collections are just corporate schemes to make money. they don’t care.
I'm so glad you mentioned the pride collections. As a queer person that grew up in the deep south, around very "one man and one woman" believing people, I'm used to hearing/seeing people spew their hatred, for people like me, just as proudly as they condemn lgbtq+ for being. Being able to walk into a store and have the affirmation that not everyone wishes harm to those that are different is like just for a moment I can breathe a bit better. I get that the big retailers arent always gonna be the most fashion-forward, but when have they ever been? I know that some of these things are just capitalizing on a marginalized community, but in a way, it forces hateful people to be faced with the reality that we exist, whether they want us to or not. It doesn't portray us in a hurtful light and isn't aggressive with its messaging like the hateful ones are.   p.s. I can't wait to hear the twins' names!!
the reason youre hungry is not cause youre "feeding for two/three" but because youre body is using up energy to MAKE these tiny people in your body so your body is asking for food to fuel that energy!!
Anyone else literally love colleen! I was her vlogs everyday, My mom watches her too😭
Okay but why was Flynn totally singing on key for I’m a little teapot 💁‍♀️
Colleen is so open and honest about everything and I love it she’s open about her insecurity she’s open about the things she’s excited about the things she loves about pregnancies and I just love it like she is such a queen such a good mom such a good human 😭❤️
My little cousins are Ava Claire and Mia Lynn (super southern I know) but their idea was for them to both have short first names with longer middle names :)
OMG I CANT BELIVE YOU'RE ACTUALLY HAVING TRIPLETS!! WHAT? That is so wild, I can't believe it I will be praying for you and the 3 babies!
Can't wait for Francesca and Tweed :)
I wonder if your cravings will reflect what your kids will like. For example I’m a twin and my mom told me when she was pregnant she NEEDED strawberry milk and she has always disliked it and still can’t stand it. My twin brother has always LOVED strawberry milk so she always says that was him.
Colleen stop giving me ideas, now I have to buy some Chex cereal so I can make “puppy chow” 😂 I haven’t had it since college so I don’t know if I’m craving it but just about everything sounds good to my pregnant brain.
Colleen pride song mare me so happy, even though I know it was kind of silly. I just love how accepting she is and not afraid to show it. 😊
I’m only about 2 minutes in but eat a well balanced diet (protein, produce, grains) and see if that helps with your hunger. Congrats on the babies!!!
I have a game where they added clothes for the pride month🏳️‍🌈
My mom said if she had twins she would have named them Mandy and Brandi and I’m very glad I’m not a twin
My mom had me naturally and my sister c - section.
woulw love to see Flynn’s room and the new baby’s room! only if you are okay with the privacy!
Flynn being sassy brings me joy😂
BECAUSE you’re body is craving NUTRITION! Not empty processed sugary carbs and gluten. BUT real nutrition from fruits veggies nuts and seeds!
Your vids make me so happy. I know you most likely wont see this comment but, just know I have been watching you for years and I love you so much! <3
Girl you need some protein to hold you longer
Just started and I'm at the shaky part - sounds like you've been eating a lot of carbs, I'm not pregnant but when I do that and have caffeine I sometimes get shaky. I think it has to do with blood sugar spikes! Try adding some protein to whatever you're eating for breakfast and little bits of protein throughout the day and see if it helps.
Hi Colleen! About your hunger! I’m with you that your babies are contributing to it but one thing that will help is eating protein (what you can handle with your nausea) with the carbs. The carbs (bagels, pop tarts, and grapes) get used up quickly by your body! Hope you start feeling better soon :)
You're like me, I didn't eat enough for a normal person before being pregnant but pregnancy made me eat like a person should, plus the little extra for the baby. But because I didn't eat enough before pregnancy, eating a normal amount felt like so. much. food. Keep eating what you feel like when you feel like, just get those calories!
When Flynn said he spilled it! I lost it 😂😂😂😂
Keep going mama. Your got this.
It's your body telling you your missing nutrients. It's best to eat more smaller meals but just healthier options.
Colleen: Hello, lay with me~ EW, why did I say that? Unsubscribe to me right now.  Me: **subscribes more**
Us utahs call puppy chow (muddy buddy's)
that Pride song was FIRE!!
Omg I can’t believe that she is pregnant and I’m not and she eats carrots without like getting forced to
Flynns pitch is already amazing 🤩 can’t wait to see how amazing of a person and singer he becomes!!! 💗
When my granddaughter was pregnant with her twins she ate every 2 hours if not she would throw up
But people need to understand that you have more than one baby so it makes sense why your body reacts the way it does. Your beautiful and amazing don't let anyone say otherwise. You do you
I’m not a scientist should be merch
Just eat when you're hungry. Follow your hunger cues. Your body knows what to do. If your doctor isn't worried about your weight and you're not worried about your weight, who cares?
Blow this up for her!!!! Ask to be tested for gestational diabetes!!! It has to do with placenta hormones
“Ice cream... I just said it.” Oh my god Flynn you made me laugh too hard
I was watching vampire diaries and I saw Eric
I love the intro 😂❤️❤️is so cute
Every time I hear Flynn talk I’m amazed at how smart he is! He’s so sweet and has grown up so much!!
watch 8 months from now she comes out with a video "Meet Franchesca and Tweed Stockland!!!"
It's funny because the second you said you were pregnant I said OUT LOUD  girl 💗💖💝💘💕💓💞
You should have your sugars checked for diabetes. Alot of women develop it while pregnant.
I was born a c section
omg Flynn with the tea pot song. Flynn is going to be a good big brother! And guys don’t judge Colleen for how she is eating
I got a pronoun pin A pride 365 shirt with Diffent flags There was a tie dyed shirt that said pride I got a rainbow tire dyed hoodie crop top  There was a tank top  A pretty cute BLM pride shirt An Ally shirt
I haven't even finished watching this video but I want to comment this anyway. There is no way about the triplets, but if it's true then CONGRATULATIONS again! 🎉
I am happy they have pride clothes but some of them aren't made in mind for people that are part of the community which i find weird and some of them are too much bc as rachel said we gave them rainbow and they threw it up at us
Pancakes saved my life my first trimester. It’s gross…but they tasted the same coming back up as they did going down and that made getting sick constantly a little easier 😂
The reason why you're shakey is because they are taking all your nutrients so therefore you need more then usual so eat healthy and eat lots of food with iron !
My guess is a girl and a boy also my sister is pregnant right now so she knows how you are feeling love you❤️
A bagel, pop tarts, and grapes isn’t “a lot” of food, lol.
I saw a video of yours near the top of my YouTube page called "I'm Having Twins" from when you were pregnant with Flynn. It was clickbait for your lipsticks! :D Did you know that goats and sheep often have twins and even triplets?
LMAOOOOOO pls dont name your baby tweed
Listen... I’m all for pride month and being out and proud. But get one thing straight, company’s do not care, they do things because they are marketable and profitable. Make no mistake, if they didn’t think THEY would benefit from it.. they wouldn’t. It’s great and wonderful to do what they’re doing, but they’re not doing it to be supportive
I'm early(ish)...COLLEEN...NAUSEA HELP COMMENT!! 😅 I had extreme nausea for 2 of my 3 pregnancies. Sparkling water is something that REALLY helped. I could not keep water down, but I could if it was sparkling, plus it also seemed to calm my stomach. Ginger gum was also a go to, it just doesn't last as long as I would have liked.
On the subject of Target's Pride collection - Target is not "supporting" me by selling clothes with rainbows on it. It's marketing. It's nice that we're at a point where you can make money by being LGBT-inclusive, but this is for them, not for me.
I have an idea what if Maranda talks about having twins
So glad you are having beautiful rainbow babies!! I hope this pregnancy feels fast so you can go through the pain quickly and get to the fun part!
those weight recommendations are bogus, idk why doctors follow them so closely! I understand that if you have diabetes, are obese, or begin to have complications related to weight gain, then yes maybe you should be more careful but when people stay healthy during pregnancy and still get frowned upon by their doctor for gaining “too much” weight, it’s ridiculous. Like I’m still healthy? My sugars are good, BP is good, baby is healthy, not too big. That’s what matters. I gained 45lbs and nobody every shamed me for it. According to everyone I know, 35-45 and beyond is normal. Never heard of anyone gaining just 20lbs! 🤷🏼‍♀️
The name segment was so funny to me. My grandma didn't know she was expecting twins. She was already planning on using the name Donald, so when my dad arrived a few minutes after Donald, he was dubbed Ronald. 😂
The pregnancy hunger is no joke! I gained 60lbs with my first daughter (I was also very underweight at 106lbs) and only 20lbs with my second ( I was at a normal/healthy weight by then). I completely understand that hunger pain and frustration.
Can Flynn always do the intro song?!?!  It makes me so happy!!
Awe I love his singing
[cool]
about the "eating for two" subject...you probably weren't eating enough when you weren't pregnant and that's why you notice such a dramatic difference in how much you need to eat. A poptart and dinner is not enough food but when you eat like that for awhile your body just adjusts to it. Your hunger cues and appetite are affected. But you can't get away with that when growing two humans. Your body NEEDS energy from food and can't just skate by without it while trying to grow two humans. And bigger meals (bigger than some carrots and ranch) may help with the frequency at which you need to eat :)
Honestly, I'm just here for Flynn's intro ... So in love
They are right you’re not eating for two. You are eating to GROW two(or one) HUMAN’s!!! That’s exhausting and takes ALOT of energy and nutrients!!! Listen to your body!
Colleen:  talking about being hungry all the time now Me: yeah no gurl thats me for the past 16 years of my life...
I would die is Colleen had triplets
Where are Flynn’s hot air balloon jammies from?!?! 🤞🤞
Talking about twin names. My mum chose Alice and Freya for me and my twin. I also know people that have names that begin with the same letter e.g. Sophie and Shannon xx
If it’s a boy and girl name then branch and river those are my favorite names ever
I see where you're coming from re: pride clothes and I think reasonable people can disagree on the topic, but I personally find it irritating when companies pat themselves on the back for doing something they're only doing because it's profitable now. I won't pretend that I don't own any rainbow merch, but I do feel weird about it and I do think it's a cynical cash grab that just happens to give me something cute to wear at pride.
How do I set Flynn singing I’m a little teapot as my ringtone??? Asking for a friend...
When I was pregnant with my twins I would have one craving right after another! With twins you are going to eat more than you thought was humanly possible! You got this girl!
She should make dar dar with a truck on it for one of her Merch Ideas
You do shake being pregnant and its awful girl
When she said that C-sections were used to save lives it really felt like she was connecting to me because it saved my life my heart stopped beating and that's why my mom had to have a C-section
Now I want puppy chowwwwwww!
I'm OBSESSED WITH YOUR CHANNEL! I love how you support everyone in their decisions. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
When your allergic to peanut butter (all nuts yes even almonds not concunuts THERE FRUIT) GOSHHHHHHH I want it
My mom had me and my twin from her hole-  we were super tiny though i was 4 pounds 11 ounces and my sister was 5 pounds 11 ounces 👍🏽
I sure wish i would of done that same thing with gifts let them pick 1 and put the rest away for other times. We waisted so much money buying alot and never playing with them lol
Flynn's toys and how you say what do you pickle is so cute I love it 🥰🥺❤️
I just said it 👹👹
Yo I literally make up little songs like your LGBTQ+ song all the time haha!!!  Loved it, feeling not alone haha
Twins usually turn out to be small so you might not be as big as you think you will you might be a little bigger that you were with Flynn
I’ve been been binge watching all of colleen’s videos and vlogs lately and I’m loving it !
“Im vlogging It’s boring I’m coleeeeeeen!” So cute omg XD 💛
I had absolutely no clue what puppy chow was until today and now I want to make some
Yay
Bagel, popstars, and grapes (although delicious) are all very carb heavy. Maybe you need more protein to stay full and feeling better for longer, especially in the morning. Worth a try!!
My mom gained 85 pounds with me. I was born 5 pounds. 😀
I just made Reese's puppy Chow lol it was bomb
As much as i'm happy for colleen having Twins, i'm also as scared as her as for her body. I hope everything goes well, let's just pray! ❤️
MINI VAN TOURRRR
Eric’s laugh is like Flynn’s
I love flynns hot air balloon pjs😍😍
At the beginning of my pregnancy I would get really hungry and shaky too! And I was SUPER nauseous also, like unless I was lying down I was dry heaving/vomiting. Bleh. My midwife said that making sure to eat protein as often as I could stand it would help with the shakiness. It was supposed to help me not be nauseous too, but it didn't work for that....
Tips about nausea- smell rubbing alcohol, and hum!
Does anyone else find themselves singing the podcast song? It’s so catchy
But I thought she was having twins cuz she has clickbaited having a baby, than she did, and she clickbait Ed having twins, than she did
So the upset about stores like Target, Walmart, Amazon, etc. is not about the clothes not being cute, it’s about large corporations commodifying and profiting off of Pride month and the LGBTQIA+ community without ever actually doing anything to help the LGBTQIA+ community.
98 people watched your video and did not like it will let me tell you something leave her alone if you don’t like her leave her alone I love you Colleen
Lol you c	an tell colleen isn’t new to youtube because of the title. Gets a lot of people to watch when she mentions triplets
give then gender neutral names
The pride clothes from these places are for straight people tho, that’s the problem
Flin is so cute
Ahhh your son adorable!!!❤❤❤
what you said about stores and pride is so true. i 100% agree with you. also loved the song! not apart of the lgbtq+ community but i do support and love them.
The way Flynn sings the into is soooooo sweet!!!! Like if you agree!!!
It seems like your body is burning through the carbs very quickly and you’re getting carb crash. Try more protein. That’s helping with my pregnancy! Hope it helps!
I feel so so bad for you I’m sorry about people hating on you if they are hating you don’t mind them keep on your hard work 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Could we have Flynn’s reaction to the pregnancy please?😅💓
Okay I'm a nutritionist and I'm like actually ASTONISHED AND LOWKEY MAD that literal DOCTORS would shame a women WHO WAS EXTREMELY SKINNY when she conceived for gaining 70 pounds during pregnancy... like what, shes supposed to support a pregnancy with that tiny body??? She ended up the same size/weight as a woman who started at a bit of a higher weight and only gained the "appropriate" amount of weight would have so why would it even matter??? Also your body knows best. If you're hungry it means you need to EAT. Like why the hell are doctors promoting restriction during pregnancy instead of promoting making sure youre getting enough calories and nutrition to grow the LITERAL HUMAN INSIDE YOU. BABIES NEED FOOD. Ffs, you can literally harm your baby's development FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES if you diet during pregnancy, not to mention that it will suck your body dry of all the nutrients you have! Pregnancy is temporary, osteoporosis is forever
No 3 babys
I'm so happy for you and your family!  Flynn is just the happiest and sweet baby and now you will have 3 amazing hoomans 🤗 thank you for sharing him with us.  I love how excited he gets to make others happy.  You guys have done a great job and have such busy lives.  Praying for a great experience
I am part of the LGBTQ+ Community. I am bisexual. I have a lot of friends who are Lesbian, Gay, Pan, Nonbinary, Trans, and Bi (like myself). It is so cool to have these people in my life. They helped me to realize my sexuality. I love them for it. And nobody was affected by my sexuality. No friendships were harmed when I was coming out. Except I am too scared to come out to my family because my parents do not support the LGBTQ+ Community, let alone Pride Month. It hurts to know that my family probably won't accept me for who I am.
I like the color rainbow but I’m not part of the lgbtq + community
Frozen grapes! I had forgotten about them but the cold watermelon reminded me. Try frozen grapes for your nausea!!!
Oooh puppy chow! Good choice!   Once my mom had me making puppy chow and wrote down the recipe (I was like 10 at the time)...She forgot to add butter to the list. Needless to say I made a total mess and was also a HOT mess afterwards because I was so frustrated as to why the chocolate was hardening so fast.
Nitra B here on YouTube is pregnant and she’s been eating cold oranges! If you get sick of watermelon 🍉 then try different fruit like oranges 🍊
My mom is pregnant and we usually never eat Taco Bell, and she wanted Taco Bell for about 2 weeks!
Tell me why I started shaking my phone with her as she shook the box of puppy chow
COLLEEN. I LOVE PICKLES AND JOLLY RANCHERS. YOU HAVE TO TRY JOLLY RANCHERS IN PICKLES LMAOOOO it’s so good! just stick one jolly rancher inside a pickle (the seed part) and suck on it! the best flavor jolly rancher to go with it is the apple flavor! pleaaaseeeee give it a try lmaoo if it doesn’t make you want to throw up your intestines
I love you Colleen ❤️😚💗💞🥰💕
i’m bi and the pride song made me smile so much so thank you colleen :))
Your way of naming the twins is what my mom did with me and my twin. Since she wanted us both to grow up as individual unique people instead of being associated with each other all the time, so that both of us weren't dependent one another.  P.s. Are names are Rebecca and Audrey
Listen up all you people criticizing Colleen for her eating habits: fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy often cause an increased appetite, which is why pregnant people often feel the need to constantly eat. It’s recommended that you eat several smaller meals and snacks instead of three large meals while pregnant, for this reason and also to help curb nausea. Her babies are not going to develop an awful defect just because she’s eating pop tarts instead of salad.  Y’all can chill, Colleen ‘s doing a great job and is choosing to share her pregnancy with all of us. I sincerely hope none of you speak this way to people you actually know.
Lol Flynn: I just said it gosh dad 🙄😂 He’s so sassy
This is not helping my severe baby fever....
It might help if you eat protein and less carbs. I know carbs are just fast energy. try deviled eggs or some cheese and crackers.
Flynn calling the pregnancy pillows worm pillows is  so adorable
You need protein colleen!!😂
I love you and you are totally right on eating your cravings once in a while and also eating frequently, there is nothing wrong with that.  The problem on weight gain is not how you look or if people think this is not ok. The problem is gaining to much weight is a risk factor for a lot of things in pregnancy. I'm a doctor, and believe me the goal in every pregnancy is a healthy mama and healthy baby! And that's why gaining a lot of weight is not recommended I get it, you should eat what you can, specially with the nausea you are having. It's about trying to make healthy choices more and more.
Why does it say TRIPLETS!? I havent watched the whole vid yet so I'll edit this comment on why...  Edit: still.dont know
My friend who just had a baby says to try baby booster powder! You mix it with fruit and milk and it makes a shake that gets rid of morning sickness and substitutes a meal
It’s true that you are not eating for two!! But if your body need it, you have to have it cause we are all different and some people need more than others! Your body is wise and ask you more fuel to feel more energized! And twin need more! Back off haters!!
Sammme with me about food.
Colleen says its the worst angle and she looks super gorgeous haha! She is so pretty!
I totally agree about Pride merch!!!! Eight years ago I tried to come out to my friend as ace and she didn't take me seriously and didn't really believe that asexuality was real. It was hard and pushed me back into the closet for a few years. Then like three years ago I saw an ace flag for sale in Target's Pride collection and it was so freaking validating I got emotional. I bought the flag and cried the whole way home. I hung it up and came out proudly to all my friends and family. Representation still matters, and even something as seemingly cheesy as Pride merch collections can help someone in ways you don't even realize. 🏳️‍🌈
omg it was so cute when flynn was singing the tea cup song
Since you love Flynn so much Flynn should be your two twins
Oops I spilled it lol
You seriously need to at least double your intake with foods and  vitamins in food probably. I was the same way when I was pregnant with twins. Everything was more intense. Talk to your doctor maybe they can help you.
I think part of the reason people make fun of companies’ pride clothes is because it’s just “rainbow capitalism,” meaning that these companies pander to the LGBTQ+ community during pride month to make money but then show no interest in standing with us the rest of the year.
As nicely as I can say this, I think you may need to eat more protein. Hope it helps. Good luck!!
5:10 Eric’s really yes anding the heck out of this improv.
im not a doctor but mabey its because your body is working harder because you have more than one person inside you so your burning off the food faster. agine i am not a doctor
*ice cream, I just said that...* Flynn is getting so adorably sassy lol
5:42  flynn: it’s chocolate ice cream !😀 erick : what’s in here ?🤨 flynn: ice cream..... I just said it 🙄
Flynn toys reveal would be a awesome YouTube channel
Flynn kills me. "Uh oh I spilled it", and "ice cream. I just said it" 🤣  He's so adorable.
1:06😅😅
Girl: maple and rose  Faith, Hope. Olivia, Sophia. Ella, Emma. Hailey, Hannah. Ava, Emma. Boy:   Blake, Jake Brandon, Landon Brett, Rhett Daniel, Nathaniel Ian, Ryan Jayden, Kayden just some ideas
You were very underweight prior to pregnancy so actually the amount of weight you gained was good. I also could not eat that much and be fine but when I’m pregnant I’m always starving! The shakiness is probably from lack of caffeine since us pregnant ladies have to limit out caffeine intake.
Adding a bit of protein to your snacks and what not will help with the shakiness! ✌
I’m grateful for all the pride clothing! As someone who has 2 father in laws I want to support LGBTQ+ community in every way possible!
Sure it’s great that big companies are selling pride clothing, but be sure to buy from small, independent companies!! 🏳️‍🌈 happy pride month everyone :)
My twin boys are Silas and Leo. It was SO hard for us to come up with TWO baby names that we loved but they fit them perfectly!! Best of luck finding their names !! 💕
Colleen: Stop hating on pride merch Rachel, her literal *gay* sister: THIS IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE
Jake and jade boys names or Jack. Girls lily and lila or layla
That tea set is so cute and fun!! I love how colorful it is too. 🥰😃
Colleen hey I just want to say that no matter what happens with this pregnancy you can handle it. Your body knows what it’s doing and I’ve been watching you for a while and you are the strongest person I have ever seen. I don’t know how you do it, but I know you can do anything. Have some faith in yourself and your body because you can do this and your body can handle this. 💕 (also happy pride month)
Keep the Flynn intro forever best intro ever
Please please please please please please please please please please please please listen to your body. If you feel you need to eat then eat. I think it'll work out for you in the Best way! I can only imagine how hard carrying twins would be. Experience that you can only take one day at a time. I hope it gets better soon for you.
I thought Gwen said I just said it!!
Genuine question, why are closed captions not available? I am hard of hearing and its hard for me to see your videos even though I love them 😭
Apparently the weight gain is based on your current weight. So, I am overweight thus it was recommended that I gain no more than 15lbs, 20lbs max. As long as your doctor isn't alarmed, no pregnant person should worry too much about weight gain.
Try eating full nutritious meals instead of snacks :)
I love how Colleen is trying to be the best mom she can for Flynn!  ❤️🤗
Im soooo opposite! So I feel similar, whereas, I feel hungryy all the time but Im so nauseous, I havent really been eating at all 🥲 I actually lost like 4 lb so far and Im 9 weeks along at the moment 😭
I had the same problem Colleen. So from what I noticed was that if I ate something that has more protein it made it a million times better. Obviously idk if it's the same for you but it helped with my shakes when I was pregnant with my son
can you give us a recipe for the puppy chow
I just don’t like people giving unsolicited advice. Honestly if Colleen didn’t ask just don’t give your “advice”
i love that flynn has a teapot 🥺
“What kind of fluid?....👀doodoo fluid” 😂😂
IF IT TWIN GIRL PRESSLEY AND PAILSLY AND YOU CAN CALL THEM THE SPECIAL P’s
"It's ice cream, i just said it..." 🤣🤣😘😘
Try not to eat so much sugar for the shaking. You can have blood sugar sensitivity while pregnant.
My literal reaction to the title "No frickin wayyyyyy"
I think your drs suck if you didn't eat all the time you could get extra sick I forget the name u are feeding three your doctors aren't it second opinions to the rescue queen u got babiesssss not baby bb girl. I admire your strength do what your body tells you that's what it needs. Also speaking from past experiences I wish I new this when I was pregnant it could of saved me from the hospital and getting a condition eat up you need nutrients if you aren't sure eat a lot of health foods but keep all them tummy's full.
6:27 Not to be rude or anything, but did anyone else notice that person in the back (I think Coleen's mom) slip through in her towel?! 😂
COLLEEEEN MY MOTHER IS LIKE YOU CAUSE SHE WAS LIKE IM NOT NAMING MY TWINS WITH ANYTHING THATS RYMES BTW I AM A TWIN SHE HAD I AM. A BOY AND SHE HAD a BOY AND A GIRL SHE MADE THE NAMeS GO GOOD "Jack and Sydney"
Ok I am have been so confused with who I am, but sonce it is the 1st day of pride month....... IM GAY. Also how could people dislike colleen, she is like the sweetest human ever. She IS a wonder bar, amazing
“It’s only like noon” 😂
My mom just had twins on Thursday last week
Thank you sooooo much for that beautiful song about lgbtq+ song!
“I do wanna try to have my twins through...my hole” 😂😂😂😂
Colleen, you have to recognize that a lot of stores like Walmart are just selling pride stuff for profit, not because they actually support the community. Also, great that you support the community, but please don't speak for the community.
I’m at work can someone tell me what the clickbait is about
I think it will be a boy and a girl
Honestly I’d say try to stomach something with protein, but I know it’s hard in the beginning and you eat what’s whatever you can manage
Wait.... is this true?? Haha nevermind. It’s two
I don't think we every saw Flynn's reaction to becoming a big brother. If not can we see that clip?
Happy Pride Month 🏳️‍🌈❤🧡💛💚💙💜🏳️‍🌈
OMG IM A TWIN IF ITS 2 GIRLS NAME THEM CAITLIN AND NATALIE
For me it's not about the fact that a lot of big businesses like Amazon and Target are making pride merch, that's great. It's the fact that most are only capitalizing off of pride to get money and not donate any of it.
I feel bad because I watched you all the time but I went on vacation for a week and You kept on posting which I love but I can keep up and then I didn’t watch all those videos and I’m starting again OK I hope you
I think you are such a trooper! and even if you are not technically eating for two, you are still creating 2 HUMANS only from the materials in your body. so I say YES, you do need to eat more. you do you. you GO girl !
I clicked on this video faster than Flynn could say “I’m a queen!!!”
Did you really actually say “back in my day?!?”OMG NO
I think it's bc ur body is doing all this stuff WITH 2 BABIES and so it needs lots of energy
I support lgbtq because my sister recently came out
Are you still married please answer you have not been wearing a ring
I don’t support but I respect!
Candied ginger also helps with nausea. Pregnant and not.
I was 100lbs when I first got pregnant with my son in 2019, and when I was 40 weeks I weighed 160lbs. Then after birth I lost pretty much all of it and went down to 110lbs, which was healthier for me than 100lbs. So whoever thinks you need to gain a certain amount of weight, don’t even listen to them! I never got shaky like that with my first, but I’m 32 weeks pregnant with my second and in the beginning I got SUPER shaky if I didn’t eat anything within like 10 minutes of my last snack hahaha
Have you tried the tropical flavored Jolly Ranchers?
"it's ice cream, I just said that" Flynn is too cute!!
NOOOO
you should think of gendernuetral names to
You're probably shaky because growing babies is using up all your supply of a particular or several particular nutrients...so whatever it is your craving is the nutrient your short supply of.
"You're not eating for two" - probably a doctor going by research on pregnancy with only male patients 🙄 that's how much sense they make
When I tell you that last little jingle at the end made me laugh soo hard I peed a little
Green apple is the worst flavor 😫😭🤮
Baby content! Baby content! Baby content!
Egg Nog
Colleen I am almost 13 weeks and I'm in the same boat I have actually lost 10lbs. I have to eat always or I throw up nothing but stomach acid. I went to my family's yesterday and I could not wait on food to be done i had to eat some of the sides first I was dying.
Target has great PRIDE clothing!! Proud supporter of PRIDE!
I feel like you can really tell how much better just emotionally she is even though she’s in pain a lot of the time because of how her doctors being supportive and her just being fully excited for these babies(not that she wasn’t for Flynn but like it was her first so ya know)
My grandma had twins and didn't have c-section
I’m having identical twin girls and naming them adalyn and Evelyn
🏳‍🌈HAPPY PRIDE MONTH🏳‍🌈im lesbian and proud<3
Happy Pride Month!!
omg colleen
The issue a lot of us have is companies are trying to capitalize off of us. They don’t donate proceeds to lgbtq charities and they just do it to try and make money in pride mouth, they usually don’t cate about the community. It’s really lovely to see and makes me happy to see pride merch but most companies just want money.

I don’t think people are bullying these pride collections because they just want cuter clothes. I think the main issue is that most of these corporations are so quick to profit off of us (the gays) during pride and they’re so quick to put out a collection for pride. There is no real effort to actually support the lgbtq community, it’s more so that they just want to profit off of us. The bullying is just us poking fun, although I see your point, I just wish companies would put more effort into their collection and actually show support by perhaps donation to lgbtq groups and charities.
You’re shaking because you aren’t eating protein or fiber. Especially in a twin pregnancy you need a TON of protein. You feel starving because you’re eating high sugar foods and your blood sugar is going sharply up and crashing down over and over.
Coleen you have inspired me so much with theatre and I am audition for a show and lost my voice and I don’t know if I will be better in time because it is tomorrow and it is a show I have been wanting to do for a long so just wish me luck! 😬❤️
Something that is good is frozen watermelon and u can use it as a popsicle!
Babies taking all your nutrients 👶🏼👶🏼
can we make the pride month song she sang an anthem like.... 💗🧡💛💚💙💜
My mom tried to birth me naturally, had a heart atack and I had to be cut out.
Your Son is so adorable!
FOR NAUSEA!! There is something similar to those generic nausea wristbands, but it's electronic. It's called the EmeTerm wristband, or another brand is ReliefBand (looks nicer and has more setting options, but the battery life is crummy). It's like a weak miniature TENS unit, it sends tiny electric pulses to the same nerve that the basic elastic/button wristbands hit. It is completely safe for pregnant women, a lot of doctors even recommend it! I have only used it for nausea from other things, not pregnancy, but I know quite a few pregnant women who loved it!! They're not the cheapest thing in the world (usually around $120, but their website has them on sale right now), but they have a great return policy if it doesn't work for you. They also last for years. I've had mine for 3 years now, and it's still going strong!  Edited to add: It uses the same nerves on your wrist as the cheap "elastic band with a plastic button" things, but it does actually work in a different way, it's not just a more expensive version of the same thing. So one might work when the other doesn't.
Does Flynn sound like Ayla jaluns son Flynn alittle bit
I love the miranda sings picture from Ralph breaks the internet in the background
I am a twin and my mom puked us out. She said it was not that very hard.
Omg I love flynn so much      Flynn: " Ice  cream...... I just said it"  😁
I just love you!!! You are such a good mom !! I enjoy your vlogs you make me laugh thank you for that
Colleen that’s disappointing I thought you were a Christian now you support lgbtq that’s terrible and ungodly
I love her pride month song lolll!!! 💖💜💙
5:44 Eric: What’s in here? Flynn: Ice cream, *under his breath* I just said it 🙄   OMG I love his voice and him!
When he said “I just said it 👹😡” I died lmao 🤣
Omg jolly ranchers helped me so much with not gagging. I remember my first 6 months of pregnancy is gag every 5 mins for no reason or if i felt something I didn’t like it thought of something I didn’t like or felt hair or thought of it. I remember It would always be a hair feeling in my throat even tho there wasn’t any there.
Francesca and ✨Tweed✨
WE LIVE FOR THE LEGALLY BLONDE COVER AT THE END!!! LOL  luv u Colleen! :)
If you’re pregnant and nauseous, it’s better to eat pop tarts if that’s all that you can keep down over eating nothing…
At 0:49 I thought she said I’m 4 months pregnant I was like UMMM WHERE DID TIME GO?!?😂 And then I replayed it and I was like 😅
If they might be two girls I think two good names are Maddie And Hannah
Them having a tea party with Flynn and pretending with him was so flipping adorable 🥰
As a queer woman, I have mixed feelings about rainbow pride stuff. I try to buy pride stuff from queer creators. Or I look for campaigns that donate portions of their proceeds to lgbtq+ organizations because otherwise they’re just trying to make a profit whether they really support or not. I question big companies because there can be a lot of things that don’t align with my values  going on behind the scenes, or they’re super contradictory. I try not just give into “Rainbow capitalism” because it is a huge thing that they do just to make more sales without actually giving back to the community. However, I totally agree that it’s amazing to see and it’s uplifting and makes my heart happy and we need queer joy. It makes a big impact and I want to see that impact beyond storefronts, if that makes sense. 💕
My parents are gay and I can’t imagine my life any other way to live!❤️
Next thing u know she has quadruplets I just now starting to watch the vid so idk anything yet
“I just said it” made me laugh so loud that I scared my cat
It makes me happy when she wears her theatre kids sweatshirt cause I can put mine on and we match!
Peppermints help being nauseous as well and pickle juice
How about names: Maria for a girl, and Alexander for a boy
I swear Luna bars are soo good and I feel full after them,  add them into your routine!
is that Flynn’s voice on the audio Oml lol
OMG I’m the same way! I always have to eat or else I get super shaky and I’m only pregnant with one baby, so I could only imagine what you’re feeling.
I hope I’m not the only one who’s recommending this, but have you looked into how woman are traditionally supposed to give birth by squatting?(or even a water birth??) Using Earth’s gravity would help a lot, esp having two :) good luck with the whole process tho Colleen! Hope you see this🤞 😇🙏
All I have eaten is a piece of pie-
Twead?  LOL🤠❤️.   So plaid or cotton, cashmere or terry cloth?
Everytime flynn makes a full sentence I get so impressed, I feel like he's gotten so good at talking so fast!
Rachel made a video talking about how bad the Pride clothes at Target are.
You literally need more food tho cause you're using up more energy cause you're making TWO humans inside of you. If someone says anything honestly... to heck with them. Your body is asking for food.
Babies take nutrients from you so it’s good to be eating a lot. Especially with twins. I wouldn’t worry about what they want you to gain. You have to just listen to your body
colleen singing for pride month is eeeeevvvveeeeryyyythhhhiiinngggg. (happy pride mouth)
Another tip for your gagging episodes is to hum! I think it’s impossible to throw up while humming
Pick Alex lol
Yes to the minivan tour!
Was the puppy chow bustin
One of my best friends is bi and she loves her pride socks and pin. She loves being proud and showing it. Im so proud of her!!!!!!!!
People's obcessiom with women's bodies with pregnancy is so weird. You don't have to "bounce back". You don't have to "pace yourself". If you're healthy and the baby is healthy, your body, your business!
Oh and by the way my twins broke my Pubic bone
Flynn saying "ice cream,  I just said it " had me dying
Mia and Sophia are pretty
Luv you so much!💕hope the rest of the pregnancy goes well!!😁
About the pregnancy weight gain, you were and are quite small so your body is making you eat more to make room for the babies
Francesca and TWEED
The thing with the pride clothes is that most of the companies that release the hideous clothing don’t donate money or do anything to support causes that support the lgbtq+ community. Plus it’s really annoying to see that they only do anything once a year and don’t even donate some of the profits. I understand the point of we’re moving in the right direction and other people didn’t have it, but they don’t even do anything to actively show support. They’re all bark no bite
Ilysm
0:41 oh no not grapes I've heard those are bad to eat during pregnancy
Do you know what there due date is
Omg if she’s getting the gender envelope TOMMOROW!!! Chances are we will know the gender next week ish!!! So exciting
Can you make closed captions available for this video please? It’s not accessible 🥺
The fact that Colleen eats what I eat everyday when she’s pregnant-
i was dying of laughter when erik goes “ what is this Flynn” and Flynn goes “ ice cream! “ and he whispers “ I just said it”😂
Are his pajamas from KYTE?   That’s all  my daughter in law buys.....they are so cute and comfortable.....❤️❤️❤️
I have never been excited about a mini van but since it’s Colleens I’m freaken hyped lol
I'm a twin and my mom said when she was pregnant she would go from fine to RAVENOUSLY HANGRY immediately! She can relate
I don’t agree with the lbgtq thing that was a good song
Colleen/her family and her channel is the only the reason why YouTube is better then tiktok. (Plus tiktok is problematic)
i SWEAR if i see one more person making fun of the way she eats, SHES CARRYING NOT ONE, BUT TWO BABIES LEAVE HER ALONE, SHES HUNGRY
I can’t turn on the captions
omg Francesca! yaaasss represent! Then you can call her Frenchie (if there's a girl..not that Frenchie is only for girls)
Love you 💕
Damn, that little LGBT song made me tear up bc I just realized I'm bi a few days ago and haven't told my family yet bc they are super religious and wouldn't support me ✌
Colleen: Unsubscribe  Me:NO
Id you have two girls i like Maddison & Addison
Legally blonde reference love it
The “Francesca and tweed” thing really got me!!😂🤣
What's wrong with not supporting lgbtq community in the end of the day it's your decision and are not clowns it's just that they don't support it this is America it's a free country we get to decide what we like and what we do my but there are some homophobic out there that are clowns cuz they are people too and we have to respect them we have to respect the people that are lgbtq but we don't have to agree that but we do have to be polite🥰
a bagel grapes and pot tarts i’m insecure now that’s like a single meal
I’m so happy you said something about pride month! Me being a lesbian, I don’t hear a lot of straight YouTubers celebrating pride month!!! 🏳️‍🌈⚧
SAME I’m a c-section baby too and I’m number 4 and my moms 4th c-section
ok, yes its good big companies are making pride sections but i think some of the reason people are hating on them is because they know the companies are just doing it for the money, not because they actually care. So many big organizations will act like they support the LGBTQ+ community during pride month but wont give a fuck the rest of the year
Why why is it not true to say ur eating for 2 or in ur case for 3 ??
these vlogs are such a safe space for me :)
You need to be eating proteins, that is why you are so shaky. Those babies are growing and they need substance.
You may not be "eating for two", but during pregnancy, your body is constantly using copious amounts of energy - the energy you get from food - to grow those babies. So regardless, you DO actually need to eat more! And even if this wasn't the case, no one has the right to judge your eating habits, it's YOUR BODY mama!
The intro is my everything❤😍
I was like what is puppy chow....I just call it muddy buddy’s 😊
'What kind of fluid? Du du fluid' okay but did anyone else think of like candy or sweets on chocolate when she said that cus thats what flynn calls candy🤣🤣
IM SHOUTING LOUD!!!!!! (Sooooooooooooo loud....... seriously 😋) 💖💛💙
Girlfriend you are growing two placentas two babies and yourself!!! You fuel you!!!
I appreciate your view on c-sections. I've had 2 and I've been told multiple times that I took the easy way out! Frustrating!!! I can't get a baby out my vag or I would !
How cool would it be if Mr. Kate designed the nursery for the twins again! It would also be cool if they didn’t because I’m sure whatever it is it will look great!
Did I mention, I just LOVVVVVEEEE Flynn , such a cutie patootie.   BTW when I was preggers, I loved watermelon popsicles from Trader Joes or Outshine bars toooo.   i ate so much actual watermelon...  I just love tuning to your Vlog!! YOu are so relatable, soul sister :) .   OMG can't wait til you find out about the genders.  So exciting!!   And totally related to your showering story a ton.  I share many of the same habits, here my friend.   Doesn't shampoo clean everywhere really.   Oh and  Got ADHD and dermatillomania too.    My teenager does too!  oy vay, that's fun...LOL.
Today I got a Shirt for pride month, it says 'Love Without Limits'
Hummm when you start gagging ! It helps!
Sam & Laybia
The enunciation on the teapot song- AMAZING!!
I just realized what it is about Colleen that is so EXTRA charming. She is everybody’s big sister. 😆💖
Please eat whatever and whenever you can!
How did ur doodoo fluid get in ur uterus I'm so terrified rn.
Sounds like you need protein not just carbs that will help with the jitters
Colleen, you are burning lots of calories and just keep eating to keep yourself going. Gaining 70 pounds with Flynn is perfectly fine because you started out underweight. No biggie. Just keep doing what you’re doing. A mother’s needs what she needs.  Hugs!
Eat more fats and protein all the cabs make you hungry faster because they digest fast. Hope you feel better :D
I don't like the pride merch from places like target or Walmart since it's clearly made with no thought and to profit off of the lgbt community. As soon as June is over you will not hear a peep coming from these companies about the lgbtq+ community.
I know twins who are veronica and Vanessa and they have the same letter but there names don't sound the same
Jayden and or Elizabeth
I love his little box that he pickles from ღ🥰ღ
Funny Colleen said cold watermelon when I used to feel sick and my stomach hurt I’d eat cold watermelon and it’s just like yessss so good
Day 59 of asking Colleen to react to the birth vlog With Eric And Flynn!!! :))
Shake Shack fries are awesome, if you need to widen your fries horizon 🙃🙂🙃
“I just said it” hahahaha such sass!!!
We’re Miranda I miss that guuurrrrl
A bagel, pop tarts, and some grapes is BARELY a snack for a pregnant woman, you need to eat a BUNCH more, complex foods
I love that Flynn pickled the teapot. He is so cute and his singing was adorable
When are we gonna see the clip of Flynn reacting to your pregnancy
just be careful with the jolly ranchers and getting cavities
Boys!!!. I just read online that moms eat more because of the testosterone!  I’m pregnant too again with you 🤣 but also please check your blood sugar just incase with the shaking. ❤️ You can get a blood sugar meter for cheap
wait, it just hit me, Jojo (or colleen), are probably finding out or have already found out the gender of the twins!! aaaahhhh
I’m a triplet!!!! I love it and at first they thought i was a twin but found my brother
I definitely appreciate when you talk about pride stuff and shout out the LGBTQ+ community! At the same time it’s often frustrating when you criticize young people’s perceptions, critiques or experiences with issues regarding LGBTQ+ topics because you were around during a “different time.” I understand that Kory and you chat about the hardships of queer people during your lifetime but you have two very distinct perspectives and it often feels condescending and invalidating when you tell young people to be grateful for what you didn’t have. The fact that we get representation is incredibly exciting but it’s still otherizing that there’s even a section for a group that’s “so difficult” for companies to represent or support. It’s also important to keep pushing for progress so I’m glad that young people feel so comfortable to push for improvement... just some thoughts
Ppl, she is keeping her body nourished and 2, TWO, babies!!
Okay, darling. It's not like your eating for two or tree or ten... It's that you didnt ate for 1 before lol
Girl.! u eat ur little heart out.! Do not care what that scale says. Dont even look at it if itll make u feel not good about yourself. It's only a number. If ur hungry ur hungry.! You are beautiful no matter what.!
Flynn saying “i’m a little teapot” literally made my day❤️
I literally love the intro. Flynn’s voice is so cute!
Might be gestational diabetes, that hunger shaking
Hopefully your kids love watermelon because my grandma ate a lot of watermelon while she was pregnant too and now my mom doesn't like it lol
you better be checking with dr mama jones !!! because of what I hear when you made a video with her , your doctor at the first time wasn't really helpful
All the salty food tells me boy and the puppy chow is girl I vote one of each
wow this was so fun!! Thank you
During my preggo times I was shaky and found out I was anemic.  Pregnancy induced.  When they do your blood work, hope they check your iron.  💗💗
There is no easy way to get a baby out. It’s not fun, but the babies are worth it.💖 Wishing you all good health and happiness. 💐 PS I was addicted to watermelon as soon as I could hold down food. Lol ✨🍉✨ & I AM YOUR ALLY🌈💖
Love you so much
Colleen can eat what she wants you try to eat for three people, I bet you couldn't
Colleen song about pride month was the best thing ever
tried the Jolley rancher thing and it littlery induces me to gag 😂😂😭😭
I have gaging probloms I'm general stuff that has helped is mint and gum <3
Love your vids
I love puppy chow I love having it. It is awesome
You are growing two humans so eat as much as you need to
I swear when Flynn went “ice cream! I just said it.” Was the best thing to ever grace my ears. That lil dude is too adorable man lmao
You look pretty 😍
Love tea parties with kids . My niece has a teapot that, when tipped to pour, plays the sound of pouring water lol
I'm the G in LGBTQ+ and thanks Colleen for the support! It means so much!
Yes Colleen, I know what you mean about rhyming and, matching names.
that 40 extra pounds that Flynn gave you was the extra respect and cuteness
😳😳😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭im so happy for youuu.Im here for you.love you forever.
Idk how someone can judge a pregnant woman for eating or gaining weight. They are growing humans let them do whatever makes them feel better. Like dang they are going through enough let them make their tummy happy
As a black lgtbq+ member I LOVE june I get pride month AND Juneteenth (the day my ancestors were freed from slavery) OOO this is my month 😌
I dislike your intro
OK this might be a mistake maybe you forgot or whatever  pregnancy brain but I thought they were girls but then you said he and then you said there’s two of them but you only correct yourself on there’s two babies so maybe they are boys🤔🤔
Cold watermelon was the best!    I am guessing Erik bought a Pacifica Hybrid minivan. We have one too and love it but be aware that it’s brake takes some getting used to.
I was excited to see the pride collection at Target. My daughter wanted a shirt for her bday but it felt really cheap, and I know Target can make soft shirts. It was disappointing so we did not buy it. Bummer that they didn't put more effort into the collection.
That's how I am! I have to keep eating. Nonstop, I'm 31 weeks, I've gained 18lbs at the moment.
I have twins that are 7 now....I drank protein boost shakes because I am not a big meat person and I had a hard time getting enough protein. Maybe try those. They are easy and have 20 grams of protein 🤗
i think the issue a lot of people have with the pride clothes is that they’re just profiting off of the community and not actually supporting it. but companies like American eagle and pet smart are actually donating funds from their pride collections
Also it's ok that you gained so much because you were too thin to start with and you lost it quickly.
I only gained 16lbs when I was pregnant. 70lbs sounds a lot...
2 baby names i for sure will use in my future for babies names are Nova Raine and Noah Alexander *i  know you said you don't want any matching names but I think both names sounds lovely as twins or even single babies :)) i hope you have a lovely day!
Awh  flynn is so damm cute❤️🥺
me and my brother are twins :) our names are Lexy and Chase :)))
Try getting in more protein.  Your body is going to burn through those simple carbs so fast.  That said, protein was hard for me to stomach with my pregnancies so chips dipped in cottage cheese (don’t judge me) and Greek yogurt with special K cereal added in for texture for me through!
I literally can not handle Flynn speaking in full sentences. 😍 Like, doesn't it feel like it happened overnight?!
colleen being so inclusive and validating in literally everything she says
Goes from pride month to clowns on the same topic
You should cut watermelon into cubes and freeze them, Flynn might like them too on hot days they are amazing
You are a very slim person before you get pregnant. I thnk the amount of weight a woman gains is definitely different for everyone. I didn't gain until my 6th month with my babies. They were all healthy. You do you!
My thoughts on the Target pride clothes is I AGREE! And also... your sister LITERALLY just did a video slamming their clothes. LOL (not mad at it or trying to be a troll, just thought it was funny and ironic - love you both)
He is so cute sing The Tea Pot Song
🏳️‍🌈Happy pride month 🏳️‍🌈 I'm pansexual hehe 💓
do you want triplets
Bangs still look great
You should watch Jesssfam's Twin Birth Video ❤
I agree! Flynn singing the teapot song is the cutest ever!!
You can't have grapes when you're pregnant and I repeat you cannot have grapes when you are pregnant IT CAN CAUSE MISCARRIAGE AND I DO NOT WANT YOU TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN PLEASE DO NOT EAT GRAPES
so while she was signing about lgbtq+ i was playing the ukulele like i always do bc i have a short attention span so i have to do multiple things at once. the cord progression and strumming pattern kinda matched up? like not a bunch but like.....
I personally think that the amount of weight a woman gains during pregnancy is literally no one's business except maybe their doctor. Listen to your body and eat when you need to and screw what people think 💕
if you have two boys you should name them fred & gorge of harry & ron these are just suggestions
Colleen, so proud of you, you are so strong being able to handle TWINS!! You are such a strong woman! Also, IT'S PRIDE MONTH!!
when pregnant you are obviously eating for multiple as the babies take everything first then you need to eat for you too
Everyone: leaves after Colleen says she isn’t having triplets Me: stays  OH MY GOSH thank you all so much for all the likes! I’ve never gotten anywhere near 948 likes, this is making me so happy! Literally I don’t know what to say thank you so much!
Yes every mom is different. It’s just we see moms gain weight and then not lose and get pregnant again and gain again and so on. But it’s different for anybody. Eat if you’re hungry! Listen to your body!
Great protein snack while pregnant toast with peanut butter and sliced bananas ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I ate so much watermelon and cold fruit in the first trimester!!
Im just watching while I'm on my brake at work
It already been said a thousand times but Flynn singing I’m a little tea pot was so sweet.
MOM TIP:      Colleen, in the future when the twins are eating solids DO NOT BUY BABY FOOD. Store bout baby food has medal in them and the it can make the baby's gassy and cry more so JUST DONT BUY STORE BOUT BABY FOOD make it your self. Hope you see this 🙏❤💖
You should name one dip and the other one dot
I bet no one has any idea what you were singing at the end. I got you girl 💁🏼‍♀️👩🏼‍⚖️💕👙
Is it just me or can’t stop but smiling in the intro🥰Just me?
Flynn’s little giggle at the end of the intro is too adorable
Your so right about how sea sections save live because if that did not exist nether would my big sister
Both me and my sister are c section births because we were strangling ourselves with our umbilical cords good to know I have had suicide thoughts since before birth
Barely and Carley
my mom loved watermelon when she was pregnant with me lmao
i can’t wait till marykate and ashley are born 😁😁😁😁
9:11  Look at Colleen’s face, then at the big Miranda in the back. I can’t. I just cannot.
Uh oh i spilled it 4:37 ICONIC
Love the Legally Blonde ending lol!!! OmG
Anyone else hear her legs popping when she stood up at the end
I thought it was triplets too. My grandmother didn’t know her twins were triplets until the 3rd baby popped out. Surprised the doctors and nurses.
So Adorable!!!
Can we get a sunflower update?!? I haven’t seen them since early quarantine!
LOL your Pride Month song was amazing.
I had watermelon throughout my pregnancy. It also helps with being constipated.  Win win!
Francesca and tweed I burst out laughing when she said that😂
It’s normal for you to be more hungry you have two extra little humans to feed and grow! Your supposed to take in extra calories while pregnant. Feed them babies momma listen to your body!
16:45. Is Miranda gonna be pregnant with twins too?
francesca and tweed stocklin <3
I don't think it's 2 girl's but i also would not be shocked if the Ballingers finally got another girl (or 2) in the group.
I’m a twin and my twin and I names are Raegan and Lauren
If I don’t eat I will get cranky and have a headache and when I eat my headache gets better and I am happy
I just want to take a moment to thank colleen for all that she's done and posting videos while being pregnant. Whenever I watch her normal videos or vlogs it makes my day so much better! I wish the best luck to your new family.
Flynn is the cutest
gwen saying “ooh it’s ice tea!” lmaooo
everyone thinking you're having triplets when really its just your diarrhea kills me LMAO
Could they be conjoined twins?
He’s so dang smart!!!!!
What about Miranda
Girl. A bagel and pop tarts and grapes is barely any food and its all carbs. You need carbs AND protein AND good fats. Concentrate on balancing your diet and I PROMISE you'll have a better time and be full longer!
Is miranda announcing the big news? Haha
I love when Flynn was singing I'm a little tea pot so cute!!! ❤️
Fllin * I open it arpirik *don’t open it if you don’t pickle it I might spell it wong
I love when Flynn was singing I'm a little tea pot so cute!!! ❤️
Colleen: Coffee! Flynn: *Milk.*
First c-section moms rock I've never felt more powerful while feeling sooooo much pain. I mean the pain sucks but it made me feel like I can do anything or everything Second the first time I got a ultrasound I saw that second sac and almost fainted thinking there were two Dr said the same thing no that's fluid lol
Hi
I could watch Flynn pour imaginary tea for hours, fr just watching them b a family 🤧 it’s so cute I think Colleen thinks that it’s boring for us but fr I love it
What doctor or people said that you're not really eating for X amount of people when you're pregnant? Your body is LITERALLY grows humans! You need extra calories for you and for the babies. I have been told that you don't need a whole lot more calories bit you do need extra. I remember being hungry all the time with my son. Your body is working over time. You do what you need to do to keep you and those babies healthy, listen to your body and forget about those jerks who are trying to tell you how to care for You and your unborn babies. You got this!
5:45 Flynn - I just said it... (why does that sound like something Colleen would say, sm attitude) lol
Loved when Flynn was singing I’m a little tea pot so adorable
Flynn's Intro😖
Me like what’s pupie chow it’s muddy buddies for us
"i do want to try to have the twins through my... hole"
Puppy chow recipe?
Colleen: ✨Coffee✨🥰 Flynn: 💥Milk💥 😾😡
*me trying to not click because I made a routine where I have to watch colleens vlog at night during my exercise*
Name suggestion Raava Eins if it’s a girl Raava means light, peace and Einz means love
Um i literally have that in the span of 2 hours 0:37
In 1 hour got here
Who the heck is out here body shaming pregnant women? That's disgusting
what about (if they’re girls) natalia and victoria
That's so cute
Yes
I was the same way when I was pregnant- I had to eat every 45 minutes or I would feel like I had low blood sugar and needed to eat. I thought of it like this: I’m a machine that’s BUILDING something from scratch. I neeeed to fuel this machine or I can’t build this amazing thing. Fuel that machine, Mama! Listen to your body! ❤️❤️❤️
WAIT YOU CAN DIE IF YOU PISH A BABY OUT???😕
some stores do have pride clothes, though, just to have them. sometimes they just put them to get sales. :/
Collen :Oh it’s coffee  Flynn:milk  Haha Flynn is the funniest
i kinda stopped watching her daily vlogs this march (wasn't tired of her or anything, just slowly drifted away after a year) and I decided to watch this one, can't get over how much flynn talks now lol
My brother and I are twins and our names are Thomas and Phillip. Whether it seems like it goes together or not, overtime it’s what we’re familiar too and I think it sounds great when both of our names are said lol
Omg Flynn singing I am a little tea pot made my heart melt
i just want to point out how smart is the idea of getting Flynn a box filled with stuff and letting him pick one because you are still spoiling him (and i dont mean it in a bad way especially because giving people we love something they like feels so good and i am not a mom) but you are still teaching him some kinda of control!
I love Colleen so much as inspiration to make me feel good about myself always 💗💗
flynn is getting so big omg!!!
I've just come over from the frenemies episode where they were talking about how much theodore loves trucks! my first thought was "what a perfect friend for flynn" haha - aaaand hila is pregnant too! play dates pending?
Eat more protein! All you mentioned in the start was just carbs which will hardly sustain u!
we love you Colleen! Flynn was adorable singing I'm a little teapot ❤️😩 I can't wait for more baby content <3
I think it’s normal I too was Starving all the time! Which is not me at all! I gained 50 pounds for my pregnancy however none of my doctors said I was gaining too much they always said it was in the normal range
Am i the only one i keep repeating the “im vlogging its boring im colleeeeeeeeeeeen” cause its just so cute😩🤍🤍
yes thank you
Might wanna look up/research Reactive Hyperglycemia I have it and it's basically where when you eat something that may be higher in sugar and not protein your body can't handle it. And it will cause your sugar to drop (I.e Thirsty, shaky, etc) My doctors thought I had Diabetes with all the symptoms and it turns out that's what it was.
I am pan 🤗😁
You can tell Colleen is going to be the best twins mom ever🥰
Omg she’s finding the genders today!?!?!!!
Does anyone else remember fruit punch jolly ranchers....just me?
I subconsciously just got into the same position she’s in at the second half while listening to her like we’re just two friends chatting and i love it
2 girls Lexie and Serena
It literally just came to my head. If it is 2 girls..how about Elizabeth and Margo.
I LOVEEEEE HOW MUCH U POST IM SO ENTERTAINED ITS LIKE WE R HANGING OUTTTTTTT COLLEEEN
Girl I’m always hungry even tho I’m not even preggo so. Take advantage of it and enjoy food yeaaaa I love food
Trembling can happen if your blood glucose level is low. Eating will of course help. Maybe you should get a glucometer so you can keep an eye on it. Never hurts to be safe. God Bless.
im a c section baby and a twin!
Please do another pregnancy cravings video with Kory 💙
Colleen, I am one of three identical triplet girls. Our parents thought they were having boys (in 1958 they didn't have today's technology). They didn't even think of girls names!! It took them 3 days to decide and then they said to heck with middle names. We each got only the initial for the order we were born in! I was born 3rd so my middle name is just the initial "C". When you talked about your twins being Baby A and Baby B, it made me think of us. We were so blessed, my mother carried us to full term and delivered us naturally on December 9th, which was also our dad's birthday. We were all 6-7 lbs and perfectly healthy. And the next day we were on the front page of the San Diego newspaper with our dad, because triplets were rare then.  P.S. They already had THREE children!
I'm a twin and my mom didnt have a c section with us
5:41 Flynn: it's chocolate ice cream!  Eric: what's in here?  Flynn: Ice cream...I just said it☠️🤣
You already in second trimester. ? Wow that went fast
When colleen mentioned their new mini van i thought of the one from haters back off
Oh my gosh imagine Flynn playing with 2 other baby’s 🥺🥺🥺
Omg she i such a goos parent i love you colleen
You should definitely think about the name EVERLIGH
One suggestion I’ve heard before is when they’re born, don’t refer to them as “the twins”.  Call them by their names so they feel like a separate person from their twin.
Did the good news just  triple?
Watch your blood sugars. The shakes sounds like low blood sugar
No u are eating dor 3 yourself and the twins
Is Flynn’s reaction coming soon or are you not going to post Flynn’s reaction
THANK YOU for the comments about Pride clothes and accessories at Target, etc! I have been thinking the same thing.  I've been dating women for 20 years and finding anything Pride related has been an ordeal until very recently, and it means so much to be included at the big department stores. ❤
I get pelvic pains when I'm on my period. I wonder did you have those and now they've transferred to your pregnancies?♥️🥰🇱🇨♥️🇱🇨♥️🇱🇨♥️🇱🇨♥️🇱🇨♥️🇱🇨♥️🇱🇨♥️
"hello...laying with meeee 😉😉😉😉" THAT MADE ME CACKLE and flynn saying "it's ice cream...i just said that 😐"
I will tell you my 1st one was vaginal horrible horrific he ended up had to be vacuumed out my 2nd 1 was almost 10 pounds and I was a week early c-section I loved it I wish I would have had a c-section the 1st time around but that's my preference I do well with surgeries everyone is different.
I’m late 😫💔
Colleen, I love your vlogs so much and I ADORE you however the music in the background distracts me from focusing on the things you are saying or what’s happening, would it be possible to not put music in the vlogs like in the background? ❤️
Collen: Stop hating on the pride clothes  Rachel: Makes a video saying they suck
Most judgmentals have t  been pregnant
Colleen: there’s only two in there  At the birth: has triplets  😂
Who else will EXPLODE if Colleen has triplets😂😂😂
What’s with the toy basket for flynn? Is it like a reward?
7:00
I have watched you for a while now and just realized I was not subscribed but I did it right away
Omg you would be the best mum to Flyn and triplets
Hi Colleen, I am a twin myself and some cute baby names in my opinion(if you read this omg hi! And also you are amazing) if the baby’s are both girls Taylor and Payton is cute and also that is my twins sis and my name but the name also go together, but girl and boy names that are cute are Olivia and Oliver and last hoy and boy names that is cute is Tyler,Trevor idk but byeeee queeen
Wait whaaaaatttttt
I get Colleen's comment about the pride clothes, but there's another side to the story. Nowadays it's very hip and trendy to support equality, which I'm all for! But there are a lot of brands that try to take advantage of that by selling products that are representing the lgbtq+ cummunity, without really supporting it in their way of, for example doing business with other companies that don't support the lgbtq+ community or support queer rights. Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled that there is more stuff out there now and I'm all for it! I just think we need to keep looking critical at brands that do sell such products and how they are involved in the process of getting equal rights and celebrating the lgbtq+ community. Happy pride month! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Perhaps you are underweight for carrying babies. Whose to say 70lbs wasn’t perfect. Its weird that doctors would judge a certain amount.
Yessss show the minivan tomorrow!!
So I’m a twin, I’m older so when I was born instead of hearing the nice lullaby. my mom was singing Living on a Prayer by Bon Jovi’s lines “ were half way there ~~~ “
I think it's funny that you think you're eating a lot 😂 what you ate all morning is less than what I ate for breakfast when I was pregnant. I wonder if you tried to eat a bigger breakfast if that would stop you from needing to eat all morning? I would eat 2-3 pieces of toast, a full bowl of grapes, and a large glass of orange juice every morning.
PLEASE DO VLUNE
I have a question Colleen have you been craving Cocoa Pebbles because you said that every ballinger in your family that has been pregnant has craved Cocoa Pebbles?
My. Mom had c—section because she was very sick. If she didn’t have c-section there could be a chance me and my mom could both be not alive. It saved us
Have you had your blood sugar checked? You could be hypoglycemic.
I’m still so excited she’s having TWINS!!!! I’m guessing boy and girl!!! Everyone have a great night!!! 🙌🏽❤️🙌🏽❤️
WE LOVE U
You are shaking because you ate all carbs. Try protein or at least some protein with your carbs. Congratulations on your pregnancy and twins!
Does she fill in her eyebrows? Mine are naturally dark and in your face but like...... just wanna know if it’s natural or if you do it on purpose
You are eating for 3 u need more nutrients when pregnant. You r so small u need what u need. Love u
Im sorry!! What did you make?? and I need it now!!!! 6:00
girl
Ani and Lyra if you have girls
Sounds like hypoglycemia
Flynn and his adorable little tea set 🥺
Colleen, you really are an awesome person 💝
I would like an album of Flynn singing thank you bye
Am I the only one who laughed when she said I wanna have the babies through my.... HoLe😭🤌
I love watching your videos
I am transgender 🏳️‍⚧️
I had to like this video twice
My son was going to be called Ruby if he had been born female, his name is Henry. My  daughter was going to be called Lennon or Elvis had she been born male, we named her Rain instead. Just thought I'd share some of my favorite names for you to consider. Best regards. Xo
You should definitely do a “Baby names I love but won’t be using” video 🤍🤍🤍
Awh! I love the pride month song! Thank you, Colleen. 💕🏳️‍🌈
Doodoo fluid 😂
Colleen your parts are going to be non existent
0:19 "...or in my case, for three..." along with the title of this video got me REAL GOOD for a moment... LOL!!!! I know that's not what your goal was, but it got me. :) :)
I get so excited for your videos!!!!!
YouTube is my best friend! Honestly I love seeing peoples stories💖
Flynn singing is the cutest!!
okay so i LITERALLY was just thinking of how much I was craving puppy chow (like I googled it and it's open in the next tab) and even texted my boyfriend about it and 2 minutes later you're making puppy chow in the video... I think it's a sign
Also LGBTQA+ GANG
Did anyone else only read “TRIPLETS” in the title 😂
I NEVER CLICKED SO FAST
im only one minute in but girl you need to get some PROTEIN in early in the day!! poptarts and grapes, that's literally like eating air!! i get the same way and im not even pregnant, SOO shaky and my blood sugar gets so low i get so nauseous, and i swear protein/meat is the only thing that helps me prevent that!   if you are not already seeing a nutritionist i highly recommend at least an appointment or two <3 those empty carbs aint gonna cut it for ur energy boo! ur gonna burn right through it!
You got this Colleen!!
Thank you for your love and supportive!
Hey Colleen! While I think you are 1000% right about being thankful that companies are participating in pride and grateful that the world is slowly becoming more accepting, I think the actual reason people are hating on the looks of the clothes is that they feel as if it was slapped together quickly for pride month. As in, these companies are just sticking rainbows on clothes and calling them pride clothing in order to gain money. Yet for the other 11 months of the year, they do nothing to support lgbtq+ people, and many are even outwardly homophobic the rest of the year. The problem is that these places are using pride for their own gain and not because they actually care. And since lgtbq+ people can't stop these businesses from using the lgbtq+ identities for their own gain and corporate greed, pointing out the looks of the clothes is to discourage people to not buy it and point out how the companies don't actually care enough about pride to put effort into their designs.
How do you make that puppy chow?
Hello! I'm just going to say that very quick as someone who struggled with gestional diabetes, the shaking when you're hungry could (COULD, I'm by no mean a doctor, I just speak from my own experience) be hypoglycemia. Be careful with sugar (or just be careful to eat proteins and fats with it) and make sure to mention it to your doctor! :)
No matter what anyone says about Colleen and her parenting, she is such an amazing mom. She makes Flynn so happy and she is amazing.
So they're not identical? :0
Flynn singing I'm a little teacup is the cutest thing ever 😍
I just said it.... I'm dying laughing hes so stinking cute!!!
who else spends 5 whole minutes or more just replaying the intro over and over and over again😂😂🥰i normally did it even before i was Flynn doing it but now i just can't stop
First colleen now liz katz AGAIN (somehow) 😳
Flynn’s hot air balloon pjs are to die for!! 🥰😄
What about phoebe or phoebo
Flynn is too cute I can't handle it!
hi colleen!! hope ur feeling a bit better! can i hv a shouout? and i hv a question! when r u finding out the genders of da babys??(:
Colleen: only eats sugar all day  Also Colleen: is shaking
Hey colleen I have a dessert sry uf I spelt that wrong but you get need peanut butter butterscotch chocolate chips and chow mien noodles and it's no bake you have 1 and a half cup peanut butter one small bag of butterscotch chocolate chips and melt those together in a pan on low heat and them mix it with the chow mien noodles then put in small clumps and but in a cold place do not freeze completely it doesn't taste as good frozen completely you want the chocolate to harden I hope you try this out it's my favorite dessert
Boys always make you hungrier too than carrying a girl
Colleen Is SUCH A GREAT mom she even had a tea party with Flynn IT WAS SO ADORABLE
Say what?!
so most likely you’re feeling shaky because the babies are affecting your pancreas (ie gestational diabetes). maybe talk to your doctor about it, shakiness happens often due to low blood sugar
guess I'm a clown then...🤭🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
I have never been pregnant and probably won’t be for a while but pregnancy pillows are the best!
Who else could already tell from the intro clip that she was gonna make puppy chow 😅
i was eatiing puppy chow while watching this
yeah re: pride stuff, i guess something is better than nothing, but the whole commodification of queerness and rainbow capitalism thing is not my jam. i get why people are salty. like brands will slap rainbows on stuff once a year, but manufacture them in (ie give money to) countries with anti-lgbtq+ laws. and then on top of everything it's not even cute even though they had a whole year to figure it out (since they apparently can't have pride stuff year round)?? lolol idk i still buy right into it half the time cause it IS cool that it's available when it wasn't in the past, but there's just a lot of cognitive dissonance and like hypocrisy surrounding it
I started crying when she sang abt the lgbtq+ because pride month is a month where I’m so proud to be who I am (pan) HAPPY PRIDE MONTH 💕
There will be six people in the family
I’m part of the lgbtq+ people and that was the best song ever
Oh lord if there triples ima die
Those babies are taking all of your energy from food you are indeed eating for three people now, you should eat whenever your body tells you to because your body will tell you what you need, I don't get people judging her doing what she needs to keep herself and the babies safe.
I haven't finished the video yet but it's already one of my favorites of all time. Flynn singing is the cutest thing ever I'm dying!
miss colleen.
You eat girl. You know. Your body know.
Flynn during the tea party bit gave me lifeeeeee 😂  Also, I'm a twin and we were born through c-section! Because my brother was transverse during the last scan before the birth and then he was full-on breach when the day actually came around. So out the sunroof, we went 😂 (also why I'm the older twin, because I was closest to the incision 😌)
The hunger is probably your body needing protein which you need more of when pregnant. You get shakey when you blood sugar drops and protein helps keep your blood sugar stabilized. Try adding more protein it helps with nausea too!
Are we not gonna talk about that awesome Pride/LGBTQ+ Song she made up on the spot 😂😂😂
People criticizing pregnant woman, like they’re literally making a human (in her case two)  leave them alone.
So they won't be identical if there the same gender? Due to them being in separate sacks
i wish women wouldn't judge each other, we're all different and we should support each other. do what you need to do for your pregnancy colleen! your body knows what it needs and i promise real fans won't judge
"I'm a little teapot short and spout" THAT HAD ME DEAD🥺😭😭❤
love the legally blonde cover at the end 🤣
It sounds like you only eat carbs. You might need more protein
Colleen, I’m so impressed that you’re still vlogging while pregnant and raising a toddler! You’re doing great!
colleen before her pregnancy: i want a baby. god:.....well might as well give her 2 of them.
Colleen is an amazing mother! And I just love watching Erik with Flynn. He’s such an attentive, involved father. So beautiful to watch!
you know... samara is a really nice name! you should consider it!!  (sum-are-uh)
Good luck if you are having triplets I had some of my own ☺️
Am I the only one that listens to the intro song like 5 times before watching the whole video?!!! 🥰🥰🥰
I like your viewpoint on the pride merch but also these big corporations are profiting off of the LGBTQIA community during pride month. They aren't true advocates and allies of the community in my opinion.
I thought watermelon wasn't good while pregnant. I read that watermelon detoxifies and the toxins could go to your baby. If this is wrong let me know cause I want to enjoy watermelon again.
Loved the pride song
Loved the little mini Colleen’s Corner at the end!
You could do a pride shirt in your merch and make it cute.
I LOVE Colleens pride month song!!!!
Cassie from the SoCassie channel has talked about her c-section journey. Honestly so raw and emotional. For her, she had a hard time coming to terms with the pain from her anesthesia and "missing" the birth of her son. She said she was in and out and did not remember anything from after having him and it broke her heart. Thankfully she filmed it but for her, it was like she was watching someone else and not herself. Not saying that happens ALL the time but I understand your concerns and other woman's concerns. Just praying for healthy babies and either way they come into the world they will be loved.
I NEED a puppy chow recipe!
Your hair looks incredible ☺️☺️☺️
Eat some protein. You’re only eating carbs
Colleen: if you’re in your first trimester, try COLD WATERMELON Me: *in my first trimester and gagging every time she says watermelon 🤢😂
My dad wanted to name me Francesca but they ended up naming me Emma 😂😂
SHE FOUND OUT THE GENDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can imagine her calling her kids names like Rowan, Reed, River, Autumn, Hazel or Ivy.
If you want any girl names ideas  Nicole,Emma,Amelia,Ava,emily,Olivia,Ella,Mia,Charlotte,grace,Sophia,Anna,Sarah,Luna,iisabella,Chloe,Stella,Nora,Audrey,violet,Lucy,Bette,cassia,aislinn,
Flynn is so smart and creative! A true Ballinger-Stocklin creation❤️ I can’t wait to see the twins in the mix❤️
cant wait to know the genders
Half of your hunger is you just thirsty so drink water to💖
Colleen....eat what you want and don’t feel bad! Period. And be thankful you can. I know you said you’ve been nauseous but mine was so bad I didn’t eat for like pretty much the whole first trimester with my twins and lost 20 lbs. not fun. So please eat whatever you want for me! lol 💕
Call the twins dar and dar
I love you so much
Yeah I'm my brain I was like " that baby looks like two in one circle" but I wasn't just gonna be like UH ACTUALLY YOURE HAVING TRIPLETS!!1! because I am NOT a doctor at all lol  Also it's not my business
💕🙏💕
Flin: IM VLOGGING! ITS BORING! AND IM THE QUEEN!
Cast party YT episode- https://youtu.be/7R8LYn39Dec
Loving all the bricks of kerrygold in your fridge
Can you eat grapes while pregnant? I thought I read you can’t but I’ve seen other pregnant people who do. Out of curiosity does anyone know?
I’m due with my first baby September 30th , (it’s a girl😆) and it’s so exciting to be pregnant at the same time as you! I’ve followed you for such a long time and when I got pregnant I went back and watched all your pregnancy vlogs with Flynn, because my first trimester was so hard, and I knew it was hard for you too, so I brought me comfort, then when I found out you were pregnant, and with twins!!! Goodness! It’s so fun to experience it with you. I look forward to your updates everyday 💛
I love you colleen
Colleen I swear to you your having two girls
Love that u support the alphabet mafia
Can’t wait for the twins!!!
i love how people call things different names. like she made puppy chow but to me those are muddy buddies
Flynn is growing so fast 🥲🥺 i can’t take it  “Ice cream, i just said it”
Lego made a pride set this year but aren't using any money or profit to help lgbtq+ communities :/ be careful of people and companies trying to cash in. ♡♡
yessss i needddd a pregnancy pillow i’m not pregnant but i always sleep with a pillow between my legs because i have bad hip problems because i messed up my hip like a year ago lol
I can’t have kids unfortunately even though it’s one thing I have always wanted but watching Colleen have Flynn and now is pregnant with twins makes me so excited and happy for her!! I can’t wait to see the babies when they’re born!! 🥰
These pregnancy vlogs are the highlight of my life. Thank you for sharing with us Coleen! And Flynn with his I'm a little teapot solo was the cutest thing imaginable.
I am a twin and I was not sea sectioned out and my sister was sea sectioned out
The way she’s been saying multiple times that she never craves Jack in the box and even one time she said she probably had never eaten it meanwhile she did a whole sponsored video for them as Miranda 💀😂😂
Colleen! Was the reason why Miranda Sings did not participate in Mark Rober's Color the Spectrum fundraiser because you were pregnant?? It just occurred to me that may have been the case and my mind is blown. I was watching and rewatching the live stream wondering why you didn't participate when you were announced to be one of the people showing on there! Either way, I am still excited for your babies! Sorry about your morning sickness!
I can't with the intro❤🥰😭
I don’t see it as people hating on her I just think it’s concern over her eating habits. She is having twins and that means that her body need more nutritional food for her and her babies to be healthy, and not only cookies or Taco Bell or other types of junk food. I understand the cravings and that’s all fine and completely normal, but we can’t forget that everything she eats the babies also eat and so that’s why I think people are commenting.
Love your vids cannot wait to see the twins
Colleen I definitely one of my fav YouTubers! She is so amazing! 🥰
I love hearing about cravings.  I craved jalapeños, green olives and mountain dew... LOL!
I ment such love you
If you give the babies names that start with an A and a B, your whole families' initials would be A-baby, B-baby, C-Colleen, D-Daisy, E-Erik, F-Flynn and G-Gus. Ha Ha Ha!!! Just a kooky idea. This is my first time commenting and I just want to tell you I love you and your family so much💜💜💜
Colleen you are suck a great mom
Humming helps with the gagging so everytime you feel it a bit just hum. A lady I know has been doing it and it seems to of really helped her
Wait- LOL ima not trying to sound mean but you went from one baby to twins to triplets?
Just a little tip! If you have not been tested for gestational diabetes I would look into it! Some of the hunger symptoms remind me of how my aunt was when she was pregnant and she had gestational diabetes.
I forget about pride month because its my birthday month!!
JESUS IS LORD AND KINGS OF KINGS   Jesus loves you and forgives you for your past choices and mistakes accept him as your Lord and savior before its to late start a relationship with him read your Holy bible, talk to him every day and pray, he is waiting on you with arms stretch wide open waiting for you he would not force himself on you his a gentleman, kind,loving and PATIENCE. Put your trust in Jesus because he is the only one that will never fail You, worship him day and night , be thankful every day despite of😊  Gospel songs Nobody - casting crowns  Michael w Smith- love in his right hand  COMMUNION- TRIBL I THANK GOD - TRIBL  Voice of GOD - Dante Bowe  CHAMPION - TRIBL   There is much more but accept Jesus he loves you and he knows what's best for you, trust his timing, his ways and thoughts are higher than ours😊❤❤💞💌💌
The LGBTQ+ community song she sang is now saved in my phone and I’m going to play it when I come out. (That’s clearly a joke just so you know)
You should do Milo and juliet
No one reads ur comments
Puppy wutty? What was that thing Colleen made in the tub with like peanut butter and cereal it looked like? I’m Scottish and I’ve never heard of it, looks so good
When I saw her ultrasound and I saw 3 little dots and I was like holy crab is she having triplets!!!!! Then once I heard that she wasn’t having having triplets I let all the stress out. 😂😌🤰🏽❤️
love the pride month song 🏳️‍🌈🥳 happy pride month to the whole lgbtq+ community! love you all so so much ❤️
My mom had a sea section and She had triplets so u do u girl
What else  r u craving
“Ice cream, I just said it”   Iconic.
Hi
Love you Colleen, u r awesome.
You are  underweight so all the extra weight you will gain and had gained with Flynn would be leveling you out. The more weight you gain it will make pregnancy way easier on your body
This video is going to be a roar if she does end up with triplets
My twins constantly want food too 😩 today I've had leftovers from dinner yesterday, a little bowl of spaghetti, oranges, and a hotdog
EArly
My twin and I are Rebecca and Victoria (we were almost Amanda and Victoria), and they went with “similar length” names as a theme lol. But all my sisters have “classic modern” names so that’s also a theme, and that worked really well. Mom always get complimented on how the names go together LOL  (Emelie, Johanna, Matilda, Rebecca, Victoria)
Im 24 weeks and I lived on cold watermelon and bananas that's the only thing that helped my nausea
TRIPLETS?? HOW MANY BABIES ARE IN THERE COLLEEEN
if they are both girls then the names ava and vanessa are very pretty!
Flynn is talking so much
Sextuplets?
Flyn is sooooo cute
Here are some matching names Quin and Clare
A good plant based protein shake powder helps a lot with curbing hunger issues,  plus it has a bunch of good amino acids and protein and stuff. Building blocks for babies ya know!
Oh! For your nausea, Zoe Sugg just uploaded her first trimester video and she had a fancy wrist band for sickness!!!
Flynn is getting so big and he just looks more and more like Erik each time I see his adorable face. love you all
Ok Colleen I'm sorry to say 1. Rachel shit on the Target line 🤣 2. They are not "literally trying" they are capitalizing on the lgbtq+ community. And they aren't designed by LGBTQ people, they aren't making and selling them in support of the LGBTQ community, and they are not putting any of the money back into the community. So yeah we're going to shit on them.
i love Colleen she is so amazing and ill never get sick of her talking about the twins
Happy pride month everyone!!!!!!!! I'm proud!!!!!!! 🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈
5:45 Flynn getting sassy over here! 😂 Don't make him repeat himself!! He's DA QUEEEENNNN
The fact that most of these judgmental comments about Colleen gaining weight during pregnancy which is NATURAL and to be EXPECTED are coming mostly from women is infuriating. We get enough shit from men about our bodies.  Also, unless you are Colleen's physician kindly STFU you are not an expert, you don't know her health records.  Pregnancy and motherhood is difficult enough without constantly being judged.
I was like “wth is puppy chow?” And I saw muddy buddies 😭
I didn't expect to have TRIPLETS as a title EVER in one of your videos nor TWINS! Until now im still processing your having twins and a mother to a toddler😯 YOU GOT THIS QUEEN🥰
Sorry but corporations trying to profit off of Pride isn't support or representation. Don't be fooled into thinking they actually care about anything but making money with the least effort possible.
When I saw the total I was like if this is true she is not going to survive
I had twin sheep and named them mason and mazie
Egg tea lol Flynn is adorable
In regards to her eating, she’s hungry. her body is growing 2 babies. Don’t judge someone who eats when they’re hungry
Hii
The thing with the pride products at stores is the fact that they only sell them in June to capitalise off pride. A lot of the companies that just slap a rainbow all over their company don’t actually do anything to support the community, and that’s why everyone hates it. And also like no one would actually buy or wear the products cause they’re just… hideous 😂😭
How did she make that treat with the peanut butter and chocolate
Your body knows what it's doing. You are amazing and our bodies are amazing and growing babies is a frigging miracle !!! ❤
colleen*
Use this as an “ I’m part of the LGBTQ+ community 🌈🏳️‍🌈”  button
I think it’s wonderful that there is encouragement to celebrate gay pride too!!! It is so important to support others. And I love rainbows!!!🌈
6:32 omg i’m dying 🤣🤣🤣
Wait! You don’t double boil the chocolate and pb and then mix the Chex in that pot and then dump into jump zip lock back and shake it with the powdered sugar?! You know what...i like your process! Puppy chow is puppy chow. Also....the clumpy ones are the best hands down.
Colleen you are the strongest woman out there and you are beautiful. You inspire me everyday to be more loving and kind. You have been the one that has helped me through this pandemic because of your videos. Don’t feel like you are always putting off your problems on us cuz your not. We want to know what they are so we can help you through any hard things cuz we go through them too! Always remember, God loves you!!❤️❤️❤️ P.S. if you see this, tell Flynn that he’s really cute.
TRY!!!!!!! THE CORN NUTS!!!! (i am going to comment this until you see it!!!)
U need to eat bigger meals ! Not just snacking all day . Meals Colleen !! ❤️
Flynn singing I'm a Little Teapot was the sweetest!!!
Flynn looks so much like his dad. Its like he's a mirror.
Have you seen the new coach collection? It’s actually stunning and I don’t normally like coach
collen can we have the recipe plss
I was told I can only gain 30lbs and I gained 50lbs. It's hard work growing babies, and we know what our bodies need
Austin and Joseph would be such cute names if you had a girl and a boy
Eating more protein may help the shaking, and it’s extra important if you’re currently growing people. You’re doing great!
Aloe, Elm, and Indigo are cute names!
Congratulations at maybe having triplets!
i loved that pride month song 😅
Can put Lilly and Max on your name list
Happy pride month🏳️‍🌈
You’re an awesome 😎 YouTube channel.
I clicked on this video fasted than Miranda sings can eat on cheese ball lol
BRUHH... I CLICKED SO FAST -
The pillow in between the legs lol been there done that 💀👍
I love how Flynn includes everyone around him to make sure all of the people in the room is involved so nobody is left out. (Like the tea party)🥰
omg im not pregnant but i recently got into a new migraine medication and i feel the exact way that you are describing!! i am always SO hungry to the point of feeling faint, it’s the worst
How- This video was uploded 23 mins ago and already has 83,020 views! But anyways, i hope you guys are doing well and...yeah :)
Legit laying in the same position you are in while watching this😂
Loved how he randomly put eggs in the teapot
DO ANOTHER IN AND OUT MUKBANG PLEASEEEEEE
I don’t believe it…show us more ultrasounds 😏😏😏😏
Glenn is similar to Flynn and your mom’s name!
if people haven’t been pregnet or doesn’t have a uterus shouldn’t get a say on what a pregnet women with twins eats. colleen knows what she wants and needs. everyone should stop hating she can’t get a break.
I have a question for Colleen: do you plan on homeschooling your kids or sending them to school?
She is literally eating for three people her two twins and then herself like leave her alone
honey you need to eat more than you normally do. your babies are taking what they need.
Ima just say sum GGGs k Gabriela Gabriel Gracie Grace Gemma Gorge Gorgea I think I spelt that right? Now TTTs Tilly Toby Tallia now SSSs Sam Samantha ok 👌 Collen probably is not going to have kids with them names NOO WAIIIITTT...  Fline I NEED MORE NAMES WITH F TO MATCH FLINES name sry I cannot spell oof
❤️👍🥰
Melody and Harmony are cute names!
The reason people are making tiktoks about how horrible pride clothing is is because it’s pandering. It’s saying the only thing about us is these rainbow flags and stuff. It’s insincere and it’s just pandering. It’s often referred to as rainbow capitalism because the companies only stock those clothes during pride month, don’t make them decent quality a lot of them time they are made cheap and fast, and it’s just for a quick buck off the lgbt community.
I don't know what idiots say your not eating for 2 or your case 3....ummmmm....the babies are stealing everything from you! EAT Colleen ...cravings are your body saying I need this ...I need that...eat and don't apologize for it Mama!
i still can’t believe that your having twins-
God: ok she wanted a family....and family’s are like, 4 ore 3...
I THOUGHT IT WAS TWINGS SHE WILL HAVE MORE KIDs then my family
My twin sisters names are bailey and Morgan my parents wanted unisex names because they did not find out the gender before they were born They were an hour and two minutes apart and they were natural I told you their names because I thought those names sound really good with flin
Girl you got this i love you!
You said you like nature names and unique names that are not to out there, I think the names Melody Mae or Harmony Mae would speak to their musical backgrounds, while the names Oceanana or  Shore would reflect Santa Barbara. Also if you have two boys the name Glenn is similar to Gwen. Aloe and Cedar are also cute! I know some might be a little to unique for you!
I dont know if you have this, but there are green containers that make food last longer and it actually works so for your watermelon they will last a bit longer in the green containers.
Good, eat what u need because you need the energy.
Eat more protein or drink Boost or Ensure.
Please help I'm deaf in one ear and no subs..Colleen I'm not being horrible but I'm hard of hearing and got a little baby that sleeps in same room as me and I can seem to get subtitles to work! I can't hear you very  well or have you very loud because I'll wake the baba xx :( sucks.. kinda dunno what your saying 🤷😕
I clicking faster than I choke down puppy chow
The idea of a csetion scared me too, but after 2 vaginal births (1 being a 9lb 11oz) I didn't think I'd have to have one with my 3rd...... but I had a placental abruption with my 3rd so a csection saved mine and his life 🥰❤
You talk with your hands a lot love you though
IF ITS TRIPLETS I AM GANNA DIE OMG
Awesome Now I Know How to Make Puppy Chow Yum:) Yes Your Making 2 Baby's Eat as Much You Need Lots Of Carbs + Protein Your Doing Well xo:):)
I am currently 6weeks pregnant with my first baby 👶 and morning sickness 🤦🏻‍♀️  My Dr told me to try taking B6 and omg it’s been a life saver since I started taking it I haven’t had morning sickness. It’s been a life saver
My twins are Zoee and Drazdon. The z in each name .  They are 23 now !!!
I loved they way she said:  “I really want the carrots with the ranch!”  😂
OMG YOUR HAVING TRIPLETS
I said oh no when I saw this
Adderall can decrease appetite. I'm not sure if that's what you had been taking for your ADHD but   if you were taking it and then stopped that could account for some of the change in appetite 🤷‍♀️ it's probably mostly you growing two new humans though lol
We not gonna talk about how entertaining her intro is
I just had a heart attack 😂I thought it said I'm having triplets 😂
We NEED more Colleen and Flynn duets!!!
flynn is getting so sassy now that he’s learning more language and how to use it and i love it he’s so funny. “it’s ice cream. i just said it🙄” HAHAHAHA
colleen lost a baby so life gave her an extra one to make up for it
I LOVE THE BLUE RASPBERRY JOLLY RANCHER YES
We appreciate you Colleen!!!
Have you tried dehydrated ginger for nausea?
My younger sisters are twins and their names are Lily and Claire. They are as identical as can be and my mom ALWAYS dressed them differently. She wanted them to have the twin bond but be able to act as individuals! 😄
"Ice cream... I just said it" lol
You bought a minivan! Omg I’m so jealous! I want a minivan so bad!
Hands down the best family on the planet and I’m so glad we get to watch them grow and expand🥺
I feel like there's gonna be a girl tbh but, idk
She talk  to us and trying to find a snack lul lol
You can see the yolk sac and the fetal pole.
You need more protein
maybe try eating more iron, I used to get shakey a lot and when i started to eat more iron it got better, It might be different  when u are pregnant Idk. Also do what ever your body is telling you to do.
If your scared about the c-section (sea-section not sure) my little brother was one and I was one and we came out fine (for the most part)
2:45 he looks SO much like Erik!! 🥺🥺
Check your bloodsuger? That can give you shakes
Follow our #NewYOUTUBEChannel  We’re coming for y’all Youtube!  Hanging with The Harvey’s  Instagram: Hanging_withtheHarveys  🤪🥳💃🏻
I heard some twins name it was a girl and a boy it was this Layla and Liam
I have a name idea but I’m not sure if Colleen will see this, Bentley + Jake or Oakley and Wilbur (for one girl one boy) They’re both gender neutral names and a girl and a boy name and I think it would suit them very well :) Also Colleen being an ally to the LGBTQ+ community is amazing 🤩
Ok but the tea party killed me🥺
3:32 ok, but Flynn’s diction and articulation while singing “I’m A Little Teapot” was actually so impressive! I feel like he’s gonna be a great singer like his parents if he ever wants to do that.
She gained 70 pounds with flynn?! You’re telling me she almost doubled her weight and still looked that beautiful?!
I’m the same way with the hunger  I have to constantly be eating or I feel sick I’m 22 weeks preggo
I don’t get why anyone judges anyone for what they eat or when they eat. Pregnant or not. Mind your own damn business
Flynn growing cuter & cuter day by day
Did you find you're not rotten carrots
When I saw this videos title and literally said out loud “ no way” haha lmao
6:32 THE WAY I SCREAMED ACKFJFJGJ
I just had the best idea if the genders are one boy and one girl this would sound so well all together when you call the kids down to eat or something so of course we have Flynn, then Liam and Aurora
Posh peanut!! 😍😍😍 our fave
You are the most beautiful person while pregnant literally
Hi collen
Colleen EAT MORE PROTEIN! Carbs spike you blood sugar level and that’s what’s making you shake. Meat, eggs, healthy fats. Look for those 🖤
Flynn's imagination and the things he says. ❤  Precious  ❤
Yes, I had 3 c-sections.
*The kids get all Toys* *YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FLINN AND TWIN BABES*
flynn is so good at pickling. he only pickles one toy and puts the rest back in the box. such good self control. i’m obsessed with him.
living for the legally blonde cover at the end
does the intro sound like “i’m the queen” instead of “i’m colleen” to anyone else?
Can you say dialogue
nobody: me:why am i watching this im 10......oh wait shes haveing two{possibly three} babys!
I clicked on this faster than I could even breathe
Who else wants to join the tea party? Bc I do 🥺🥺🥰🥰 🫖 🍵
Wow she's amazing like I know she throws up alot but she's not complaining thats amazing for you 👑🏆
Puppy chow is literally my favorite thing, now I’m craving it 🪦
Don't support corporations this pride or any future pride - support and buy from small lgbtqia+ businesses if you want pride related stuff or clothes <3 edit: when Colleen started singing Oh My God You Guys, I got a little emotional because we were supposed to do Legally Blonde for the Spring Musical last year and it was also the first and only musical I would've been in since I was graduating but that - among many other things- was also taken away from me 😭
Flynn is so cute!
I just wanna say how much I love u Colleen! 😍
Owen and Nicole
I'm a twin, and my mom named us Madelyn and Brooklyn.
The gender reveal party should require guests to come dressed as a set of twins. If Jessica and Christopher think the babies will be two girls, they come dressed as Mary Kate and Ashley. If Parker and Jacob think the babies are two boys, they can dress up as Zack and Cody (Dylan and Cole Sprouse). Any other combination and set of twins works. Lol
I feel like Colleen and Erik need to play the tinder for baby names in a vlog. That would be so fun to see!
That’s me every day girl and I’m not pregnant 🤣🤣🤣 plus I am just glad you are able to eat!!
Can you do a video with you and Corey trying your new cravings like you did when you were pregnant with Flynn x
Even pretend, Flynn spills the tea 👌🏼🤣
omg Colleen - Pride Month on iTunes when??
omg im so sorry your going true all this
We call the "puppy chow" muddy buddies
If you have a boy & a girl, I love the name combo: Nico & Nova. ✨
Colleen : "COFFEE!" Flynn : *what the heck mother?* "...milk..."   Flynn is a comedian I swear! 😂
Max and ruby go together
Our fire station has put up a massive pride flag on the tower. Its huge and I'm so happy since it's not a huge town I live in. 🎉🥳
I’m a emergency C-section mama . I wouldn’t go past a one . My doctors said I was a champ with the healing process.
Wait what three
I gained 60lbs with my kids
Rose and Violet are kinda good name if you like them
i can’t get over her intro ❤️❤️❤️
COLLEEN I LOST IT WHEN U SAID U WERE PREGNANT AND HAVING TWINS DON'T MAKE ME HAVE A STROKE WITH TRIPLETS
Holy moly triplets?! good luck if thats true colleen!
Laughing so hard at “uh oh, I spilled it!” The imaginary juice 😂 so adorable
Maybe not “eating for two”, but eating to replace what the baby or babies take as they grow!  Why would anyone want to comment on that to make someone feel badly?? You have to keep yourself stocked up with nutrition and growing humans is a great reason for the extra, maybe to some “weird” food choices IMO
Flynn 😍 I can’t get enough of him.
Hey Colleen, just want to give you a quick heads up about the way Flynn was sitting. While you guys were while playing tea party, he had his left leg bent away from him. As good as it is for flexibility, sitting like that can really affect the way his cartilage in his knees grow. He’s so young now that I think it’s fine but I’m only letting you know because I use to sit like that with both legs until I was about 8 or 9 and it caused the cartilage in my knees to not grow properly. I’m not trying to be one of those “YOURE DOING THIS WRONG” type of person, I just like to inform parents because it’s better to be safe than sorry. I would rather let people know the effects because you never know. I had surgery on my left knee at 13 to correct the issue :) definitely do your research though and ask your pediatrician because I still only know so much myself 😂
Why are there no closed captions?
the legally blonde musical lyrics were very much appreciated 🙃  also congrats on twins and i cant wait to see the genders whenever you wish to reveal them to the public❤️
Omg 😱 now is triplets whatt
YESS cold watermelon!! That was the ONLY thing I could stomach!!
Sounds like you need to add protein to your diet!
Happy June 1 first
Happy pride month 🏳️‍🌈
I had 2 sets of twins, the first set came out vaginally and the second set via c- section (they were transverse breech) and I was just happy to end up with healthy babies. Whatever ended up happening was exactly what needed to happen for me to bring home 4 beautiful girls. I will say that everyone told me that the recovery with the c- section would be much harder but that wasn't my experience at all.
This family is 👌🏻
Flynn is sooooooo adorable and cute
I'm part of LGBTQ month
You shouldn’t try the peach jolly ranchers you can get them on amazon
Mine told me I'm eating for 3 to make sure I'm eating all the time... cause what we eat goes to the babies first then we get it AFTER they get all the nutrition they need. Also First pregnancy gains more then normal. Twins I was told I need to gain double what I did with my first pregnancy. My twins have a Theme.... Merlin and Arthur will be my boys names I am Mo/Di pregnancy so Identical
You even made the puppy chow right!!!!!!
I love her intro😂😍
I love the name Francesca
flynn is so wonderful and precious "i just said that" SO FUNNY
Some names if your are looking for some:  Boys: Liam Carter Henry Ryder Declan Noah  Neal Rhett Conner Mason  Girls: Rory Hazel Birdie  Willa Eleanor Zanna
0:38 Colleen I would eat that much and not even pregnant and probably still be hungry🤣
I got curtain bangs today and I love them!!! XoxoX thanks for the inspo ! You really did look great with them XoxoX
i would love love loooove to see Colleen do another psychic video w Terri about the twins :))))
Say heyyyyyy
Him playing with a tea pot and having a tea party is so cute
Names if twins ik  Logan, Lydia: M&F Ben, Patrick: M&M Ellie, Morgan: F&M Lacy,Nicole: F&F Niamh,Lola: F&F
Ok miss ELLE WOODS I see u 👀
You should make a channel called Collins cravings and it would be all of your pregnancy cravings
the “i just said it”took me out 😭 Flynn is so hilarious
I thought the title said "rumors about twins" at first lol
maybe you have that diabetes that some pregnant women get
i love that you were excited and talking about pride month! that means a lot. Happy pride month everyone!! <3
I have multiple friends who have twins, they’ve all had csections. You’ll be in good hands either way. Our friend who’s had vaginal and csection said she preferred the csection.
Yessssssssss I can’t
You are pregnant. Please talk about your pregnancy 🥰 we are here to experience life with you. And someone as small as you SHOULD need to eat extra to feed the babes. I'm so glad your babies and you are enjoying food!
Flynn is the cutest thing on the plant Earth!!!❤❤❤
Hi
I'm only pregnant with one and pretty much every 2 hours if I don't eat I get very shaky and before I got prego I hardly really ate
I missed trish in your friends video but I was so stoked to hear them mention you on frienemies! Here’s to hoping we get another mukbang soon 🥰
❤️❤️❤️
lol flynn "I just said it..." sassy flynnn so cute
I live in France and watch the blogs bécote I go to sleep  I love it ! good Luck with all thé symtoms you are making so cute babies
I heard that you have to eat a bit more for twins than what you eat for one baby.
Happy Pride 🏳️‍🌈 🌈
I feel like ppl are just going to keep adding  babys until they come out see that it's twins😹😹😹😹
Colleen talking about the LGBTQ clothes and Rachel made a whole video bashing the clothes 😬
"... I just said it" I CAN'T! You tell em Flynn
I am a proud bisexual and my daughter is pansexual and my other daughter is lesbian.  I told all 3 of my children that I will support them no matter whom they want to date and whoever they want to be.
“It’s ice cream I just said it”
hi colleen. i love your videos and just want to say im a twin. ive asked my mom many questions about her pregnancy when she was pregnant with me and my brother. im not sure if she was in pain but i bet she was. caring for us was one of the easiest things shes done but of course its different with everyone. dont be afraid to ask for help with the kids if you need it you need it. not only was she pregnant with twins she was also in her 40s and almost died because of all teh blood she lost. all pregnancies are different. i love you so much good luck with them. i doubt youll see this but if you do im glad. (dont want the almost died part to scare you i dont think you will have any problems"
🙄 I just said that - I feel you Flynn Also, my boyfriend and I were at the store yesterday and he saw a little car toy and excitedly said Finn would like this!! I said who?? Haha he meant Flynn but so cute that he thought of him
Flynn is such a good boy!
A little story: My grandma will be 85 this year. About 10 years ago she saw two men kiss in public. She was beside herself and couldn't understand what is happening.  6 years ago my mom came out as gay and now she is fine with it. She didn't understand why two people of the same Sex need to be together. When my mom came out she realized that it is about the person and not the gender.  Opinions can change if you are open to the unknown.  #happypridemonth
I imagine any type of sucky candy would help, not just jolly ranchers
I honestly think Colleen looks healthier now then she did before she had Flynn
Omg I’m so excited for the birth of Francesca and Tweed!!
"Ice cream...I just said it" THAT IS A WORK MOODDDD!!!
You weren’t eating anything b4 and now your eating normally to me anyway
omg please do an awkward maternity shoot with jessica
Colleen dont do this to me DONT DO THIS TO ME TRIPLETS
I have twins but I couldn’t imagine triplets lol
Girl yes! I'm 8 weeks pregnant currently and I'm constantly snacking or eating something. If not, I'm starving and getting the shakes as well. It's wild. I read it's due to your baby's brain developing at 7/8 weeks. You're not alone! I hear you!
i love colleen
I really feel like if one of the babies is a boy the name Wyatt would be super cute and would go good with Flynn
Not to scare you (like Colleen is going to read this, but it's my two cents, and what it's worth LOL), but the first c-section, in my opinion, is harder than subsequent ones.  Mine was called a "classical" which means from the bottom of my belly button to the top of my pubic bone down the middle.  It's usually only done in an emergency, which was what mine was... problem is, once you've had a "classical" c-section, I think you are always going to have to have one.  Usually, the most common method now is in the bikini line and this seems to be a lot easier for women.. different muscles are cut, etc.   My first birth was a singleton but my second was twins and there was no way I was going to attempt a VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean).   I hope you can deliver vaginally but if not, you will do fine with a section.. gotta get those babies out somehow!   I truly hope that your nausea subsides and that this pregnancy is easier than your first but with twins, it may not be.  I think state of mind goes a long way.. if you wake up thinking that it's going to be a horrible day, chances are, it will type thing.  I am going to think positively for you.   Love your vlogs, love your family and trying to be supportive.  You do you boo!!!!
Good luck with the blood test for the twins! Love you and have a good day
3 BABYYYSSSSSS AHHH
Hello Colleen.  You may already be trying this but adding extra protein may help keep you satisfied longer.  Even adding a good protein powder to smoothies can help, if your tummy can handle it.  My sense of smell was so strong that I couldn't take the viteminey smell that many of them had but it did help a friend of mine.  BTW, you are doing just fine.  Please continue to listen to what your body needs.  1 more thing, fruit, veggies, and "junk" food gets digested faster so if that is what your body can handle and wants, then it may just be your normal to be hungry all the time.  Keep up the good work on those babies.
Hey Colleen, so apparently if you eat something super bland that can help with nausea. Like super basic plain toast or crackers. As they bind the stomach, but of course every pregnancy is different. I hope you feel better soon :)
What is happening with Miranda.. Gurl!!! Cmonnnn x
Girl you’re killing it, you know your body better than anyone else. As long as you’re listening to it you’re doing a good job :)
My tik tok is @dpot31
before i got pregnant my weight was 90 pounds or lower (depends on if i ate a lot) but after i had my baby i was 170 pounds, and now a year later, i haven't lost a pound. and idgaf🥰🤗  but i also did have a c section for my baby so..🤷‍♀️ they really arent that scary, i am currently 17 and had my daughter at16, and ad to have an emergency c section, and now thinking back to it, i would do it millions more time for my baby
ALSO EAT WHATEVER YOU WANT NEED COLLEEN DONT LISTEN TO THE HATERS WE LOVE YOU💖
ooh so the names like Lilly and Lola or something?
Hey Colleen I know you probably don’t read the comments but could you please add closed captions to your videos because I am deaf and it’s really hard for me to understand your videos hope you understand and congrats on the twins
I can’t get over Flynn saying “I’m a little teapot!” 🥺🤧💞
OMG COLLEEN, once the twins are born, you have to do a remake of your family song!      Please make this a top comment
Aww Flynn playing tea with you and Eric was so cute!! You and Eric are amazing parents to Flynn and you will be good parents with your future babies too!
“I just said it” I’M DEAD.
Flynn whispering “I just said it” about killed me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I need to know how Miranda is going to handle all these twins situation!!!! That is going to be exciting and interesting and FUNNY!!! I cant wait!!
Whole sections? My Target has this teeny tiny shelf of the ugliest pieces of cloth I've ever seen ngl
Im a twin. Im Jada and her name is Emily
I gained 65+ with each baby, and lost it each time. I was a tank, but I guess that's just how I grow babies 🤷‍♀️
what pregnancy pillow do you use? 5 weeks pregnant, but I'm plus size so I know it is something I will want sooner than later
People hating on someone who is pregnant WITH TWINS! Obviously have nothing better to do with their time
Fylnn makes my day so much better, I love him singing... I DIED out of cuteness!!!!!!!!!!
I had 3 c-sections my first one I was in labor for 3 days. I had pre-eclampsia and was in the hospital for the last 3 months of my pregnancy.  I wanted to try for a v-back but there was too much scare tissue.  All my pregnancies I had high blood pressure.
Flynn “spilling” his imaginary tea 🥺
Girl your gonna kill me, how many babies do you got in there 😭😭😭😭💀 erikkkkkkkk
Omg one of these days I’ll tell you my C section story it’s kinda wild LOL. But the best advice I got and I’ll pass onto you is IF you get a C section when you first stand up make sure you stand up very straight! You don’t want your midsection to heal while your hunched over ... 💜💜💜
Flynn: It's chocolate ice cream! Erik: What's in here? Flynn: Ice cream.  👿I just said it.👿
Colleen is legit the only reason why i still watch YouTube
Flynn's "I just said it" is so funny!
You are literally the best mom ever, adopt me
Your babies aren't hungry, they are demanding more nutrients.
Do a miranda video!!!! PLEASEEEEEE
HAPPY PRIDE MONTH!  I'm part of the B in the LGBTQ+ community! Please spread love and be supportive to everyone in the LGBTQ+ community! I love you guys! 🏳️‍🌈❤🏳️‍⚧️
Aww Flynn singing I'm A Little Teapot is the cutest thing ever!! Bless him!! <3
Colleen. You are a great mom. I would kill to have a mom like you. Thanks for being a good mom for all you little babies ❤️
Girl you're growing humans EAT!
Okay but Flynn having a tea pot set really that’s for little girls 🙄 people nowadays
You’re barely starting to gain baby weight. Yayy we love you so much😍😍
Whats that recipe she makes?
My favorite set of twins names are Leyla and Olive. They go together without being so similar
Omg I just LOVE BUT LOVE to hear Flynn sign the intro 😆❤️
Colleen, I don't know about Gestational Diabetes. But regular diabetes have the symptoms you are speaking about. Especially feeling shaky and craving sweet or carby foods. Please get tested!
When’s your pride month song coming out on Spotify?
I completely agree about the pride clothes (not to mention I actually think they are kinda cute). Just because you don't like the way they look doesn't mean you should trash talk them, just be glad they exist.
Flynn singing I’m A Little Teapot is giving me all the joy 🥰
That little boy is so cute and smart! He's going to make such a good big brother to those babies!❤❤❤
I love you sooo much and im soooooo happy for you colleen!!!!
“I’m collee hee heen” - Flynn
I was literally having a panic attack for the last hour and I haven’t been able to calm myself down. Once I started watching I was finally able to breathe🥺
Everyone else but me: checks for collens new vlog everyday Me: sleeps till 11 then wait till the next day
i would try more protein and long chain carbs with fill ins maybe
Watch her name them francesca and tweed
Can we get a picture of your next ultrasound :)
I love you so much and have been watching you for so long but I am missing Miranda, honestly, I get if you don't have the time. You are growing beautiful babies in your body at the moment but I just wanted to ask! Lots of love.
I'm a triplet myself!!!!
AND NON BINARY 🏳️‍🌈
“Ice cream. I just said it 🙄” the sass to Erik not listening 😂😂
PROTEIN, eat protein. You can still eat the other stuff, but include protein.
I’m sure you’ve been getting asked this a lot but what was Ariana’s reaction to you telling her you’re pregnant again with twins??
IM GAY!🏳️‍🌈🌈
if you have a boy or two boys I think one of them should be named Lukas with a ''k'' like Erik is spelled with a K :)
If ur having girls I say Zoe and Sophie/a
Day 7 of asking Colleen to consider the name Opal for one of the twins. Really, plz plz plzzzzz, consider
Colleen! Your videos keep us going and entertain us but mostly make us laugh and wind down from stress and struggles so thank you ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Have you been journaling during this pregnancy to remember how you felt in years from now? Also how long do you journal? And do you do it everyday?
Trust me, eat what you need!  I had twins, (almost 21 years ago. lol), and I actually lost weight at the beginning. lol.  They need all that extra food.  And then by the end of my pregnancy, while I did obviously gain weight, the doctor said it was All baby.  My face had gotten so slender and I lost weight everywhere else in my body.  And I was eating plenty! But they obviously needed that.  So don’t let people make you feel bad.  You NEED to feed them.  And you.
It's pride month! I'm bi.
Love you girl! Keep rocking
I love the names Mason and Madison for twins 🌻🐝
OMG U NEED TO MAKE THE LGBTQ SONG A REAL THING OMG 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Sometimes it feels like some of these places just throws the Rainbow colors and Pride stuff just to make a profit tho and not truly supportive.   HAPPY PRIDE! 🏳️‍🌈
that title scared me ngl
Colleen is so strong. I'm so proud of her
What the what?!?! Clicked faster than Lightening McQueen ⚡️⚡️⚡️
If you want I really really think that these are super cutes names for a boy and girl set of twins and I really hope you like them too! The names are Damien and Danielle.
I love pride month ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🏳️‍🌈⭕️✴️🔆✅🌀💟🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
LMAO "Erik just freaked out and bought a minivan" made me DIE! also the puppy chow that you eat is called muddy buddies where I am from! and muddy buddies is an actual type of puppy chow so no matter what we sound like we're eating dog food 😂😂😂
Flynn is my favorite human and I have never met him, his energy is so pure and joyful I love his little soul 💖
If you want equality Colleen Please talk about what is happening in Palestine You and any American citizen are helping in bombing and killing innocent children with your taxes Please educate yourself on what is happening And hopefully spread awareness about it
i know Colleen has gotten over her bangs i just wanted to say that they look so good! i cant believe she did them at home.  Also Colleen doesn't know but whenever she posts a video she makes my day better. just wanted to put that out there" also the haters who disliked the video are proably just jealous so ya have a nice day everyone
I love Colleen she is amazing
Girl!! See a chiropractor for your pelvic and hip pain. I work for one that specializes in pregnant mamas and they feel so much better! You might benefit from it!
I cannot believe how big Flynn is. Such a big boy 🥰🥰🥰
Colleen, did you remember to give us a tour of your van today??? *eyebrow raise*
Watermelon was all could eat in my first trimester. I lost 10 lbs because I was so freakin’ sick!! It’s all worth it though! She’s 11 now and the most favorite person in my life!! ❤️
i like how its called puppy chow when there is literal chocolate in there
OMG when I was pregnant with my twins I was sickly hungry all the time! I would eat and be starving my stomach would hurt I would feel sick hungry 😩 like after I ate in 30 45 minutes BOOM starving lol I understand you love ❤
if they are a boy and girl, maybe Julia and Liam (my (twin) siblings names) or Brendon and Catherine (I just feel like those two go together)
Okay last comment.. I’m so excited to find out the genders!
OH HONEY I HEARD TRIPLETS AND I CAME RUNNING
I was in shock when u were pregnant again. And had a mini heart attack when u said u were having twins and god knows whats gonna happen to me if u have triplets
I still can’t believe Colleen is having twins
Egg, pickle, Mayo sandwich sounds like you want some egg salad sandwiches.
Pregnancy hunger is no joke. One time, my husband and I woke up at 9am, had breakfast and then went out to run errands. At 10am, I saw that we were coming up on a Steak and Shake and I told mu husband that we should get Steak and Shake. He said something along the lines of "Yeah, we should have that for lunch in a couple of hours." Um no, I want it now! I literally grabbed the steering wheel, cut across 2 lanes of traffic and flew into a parking spot. From that point on, whenever I said that I wanted something to eat, we got it right then, lol.
What about Miranda sings videos
i think the issue a lot of us have with the target pride collection is that it is very much a big corporation profiting off of gay people for just a month and then forget about them for the rest of the year
I call puppy chow muddy buddies
I hope it’s triplets!!
I think that’s a sugar drop and not hunger. I mean you still need to eat something or drink something with sugar and electrolytes. I dealt with that as well. I ended up having to take sugar tabs.
A couple of my closest friends are twins and their names are Keeley and Makayla!! If you need ideas haha. I love their names :)
I had hg when I was pregnant with twins and if I didn't eat toast the second I woke up I would puke green nasty bile it was terrible.
But can we have a “chromosome reveal” instead of a gender reveal? Instead of colors there can be x’s and y’s. And a banner that says “all x’s!” Or “there’s a y!”
Sorry that part had me rollin
why her babies gaining
I had to have a c-section and it was a little scary, but of course we all do what is best for our babies ❤
Cold Watermelon has been a huge life saver during my pregnancy also!
Loved the song 🌈🎶🎵🤍
i’d give anything to have a tea party with flynn 🥺😭
They're raising Flynn so well.
Such a valid point about pride clothing!
I clicked faster than Flynn could say “I’m Colleen”
Hold up
I might be getting braces tomorrow and I'm so proud
I was only STARVING when I first woke up for the day during my pregnancies. I needed to eat something immediately, so I would literally sleep with Nutrigrain bars under our mattress lol! But, other than that, I never felt the need to eat nonstop. Which is surprising, because I LOVE food! For I daughter, I gained maybe 20 pounds? And, for our son, I lost weight most of my pregnancy (I are a lot healthier, because I craved healthy foods for a weird reason lol!) Then, with our boy, I ended up gaining about 8-10 pounds only, which was literally his weight, and the placenta. I was Pre baby weight the second ge popped out! Lol! I’m also not a super thing girl, so that could be why I didn’t gain a ton. I range from 165-195 while not pregnant. I’m currently 170. I swore I would gain a ton while pregnant, and I didn’t. Not that you asked me any of this info, but just sharing! Lol! Congratulations, Mom!
Lol you’re shaking cause your “breakfast” was little to no food.  You have to fuel yourself.
imagine having 4 kids, and 3 at once 😳
Wait 3!
ME IS EARLLYYYYYY YESS tysm AND COLLEN UR INTRO IS ADORBS
My younger siblings are twins and I have no clue what went through my parents minds when they named them. The girl is Sync and the boy is Washer        They were going to name my sister Sink but everyone thought that was terrible so they switched the spelling Cuz that changed soooo much😂
Omg I love your vid
"Uh oh, I spilled it."   😭😭😭😭😭
Two will due. I say eat, drink and be merry. Peace and Love.
I was the same way with 1 baby. And she was teensy. I can only imagine how ravenous you'd be with twins
You are such a beautiful person!!!!!
was I the only one vibing to her song?
I JuSt SaiD iT —Flynn 😂
Flynn is over here spilling the tea 🫖 ( I love him)
I had an unplanned C-section and it was OK.  I was scared,but it worked out well.  I also love Flynn’s imagination!!
im choosing to have a c section!
I lived on melon and Fuji apples when pregnant! It’s the only thing I could stomach due to my hg! Popsicles too! Lol I thought my son would love watermelon but I think he got his fix of it in the womb cause he hates it now!
why hasn’t miranda posted
3:32 Me: *sees Flynn's teapot and teacups* Me a second later: I see a rainbow, I am Queer ... Thanks for reading my weirdness
Lucas and olivia??? please...lol
Colleen saying "Doo Doo fluid" as I ate mint chocolate chip ice cream lol 🤣 loved the pride song she made up on the spot lmao 😂 😂😂😂
“My biggest lifesaver rn is Jolly Ranchers” Um… they’re not Lifesavers… they’re Jolly Ranchers.  Ew that was a terrible joke. I’m sorry. I will turn myself in to the authorities.
when is your song about pride month coming out on spotify
Names: Matthias, Millie, Katherine, Mae, Blake🤍🤍🤍 your the bestttttt love u ❤️🤍
U should do ella and Madi 👯‍♂️
Petition for Colleen and Eric to call the twins Ron and Jon
I love how Miranda is staring Colleen down in her Q&A
OK but one of my friends had "twins" and they didn't see the 3rd baby until the 20 week ultrasound! So they had a gender reveal PLUS a surprise triplet reveal!
Colleens about to name these babies Mary-Kate and Ashley 😊😊
your pride song though 😌🌈
i love your family so much . Your twins are gonna be adorable because ERIK STOCKLIN AND COLLEEN BALLINGER !!! LIKE NO QUESTION .  stay safe and hope you  can have an amazing pregnancy.
Flynn is the cutest thing ever oh my gosh yess
I was wishing my comment got read from twitter ahh :(((
I love how Colleen literally uploaded videos telling her entire family and friends she's having twins and people still started rumors saying she's hiding a secret third baby 😆
At this point... I don't think, I just click
Those poor bubbles, they could never compete with that teapot 😭
Flynn should have his own channel where we just plays with toys the whole time XD
Seeing her and her husband playing with Flynn is the cutest thing ever it melts my heart-
Can’t believe doctors would shame Colleen for gaining weight when she was pregnant with Flynn!! It takes so much to make a baby, Flynn was big and also if you’re a petite girl like Colleen you might need to gain more weight anyway to make the pregnancy viable
I’m a twin (boy/girl) and we are Tara and Tyler cause my mom wanted same first letter
When Flynn started singing the tea pot song my heart melted🥺
I'm a TINY girl. 110-115 5"7 by the end of my pregnancy I was 145.. I was considered an obese pregnancy 😳 I went but where? Lol
For the pride lines in stores it’s just the fact that for one month they have these things and never mention it again for a whole year yk. It’s just like they have it to have it and not because they actually care. They just want to make money
I’m pregnant and today I had ramen noodles for breakfast. I have no shame ✌🏼
I love you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is my first pride month:)
I clicked faster than Colleen can ever blink 💕
Also Colleen if you read this I just wanted you to now that you are an amazing person and mom. And your baby is the cutest. Also I hope that I can find someone like Erik. You are both amazing parent. Have fun and keep making amazing vlogs. Lots of virtual Love your#1Fan.
I basically feel nauseous or like I'll pass out if I'm not eating and drinking water all the time. I'm 32 weeks pregnant and it never stopped for me. Your body knows what it needs.
Omg I’m not a fan of cherry jolly ranchers either lol
I am also a twin and my sister and I were not C-Section baby’s but we were born in an operating room in case one was needed
my day always gets brighter when i get the notification that colleen posted 🥰✨
Francesca and TWEED?! 😂😂😂
I think the main reason people are upset/making fun of pride clothes at Target and Walmart is because all of these big corporations are profiting off of the LGBT community every Pride month without actually contributing to social change. Look up Rainbow Capitalism for more info. Please support independent queer artists and businesses over large corporations this June!
early again
A bagel, pop tarts, and grapes by noon is NOT A LOT OF FOOD WTF
RAINBOW TEACUPS IN PRIDE MONTH :D🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Colleen please don't play with my feelings 🥺🥺😂😭
there is a holy virgin miranda in the house!!!!!!!!1
What about Christi and robin
The shaking might be nothing, but maybe ask you OBGYN about it. Might be nothing, could be a red flag for gestational diabetis. Better safe than sorry. 💕 Especially if you're going in for a blood test anyways for the gender. All the best for the rest of your pregnancy!
I never had problems with my blood sugar until I got pregnant. I still sometimes will get dizzy and need food because my blood sugar’s too low. It hasn’t happened in a while, so I hope I’m finally getting over it!!
does anyone know a good puppy chow recipe?
Flynn playing tea party just 😭 so cute
Erik: What’s in the tea pot Flynn: Ice cream, I just said That was the cutest and funniest thing ever!😂
Just a reminder to take it easy! If you don’t feel able to post for a while, then your true fans will understand! Your wellbeing is what matters right now , and the babies  of course 🧡
Love you xoxo
did anyone else hear rachel when flinn was picking his tea pot toy
you're literally growing TWO humans from the size of a poppy seed to like, idk, 3-5 pounds each?! And you have to keep your own body nourished while you do it?!? For 9 whole months!? People can shut up about how much you eat and when!! They're not growing TWINS in their uterus, so they don't get to judge you for how much you eat
I just said it lol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hi Colleen! Just curious: Have you listened to Olivia Rodrigo's new album SOUR? What's your favorite song on it?  ily 💜
Eat all the food mama, you're legitimately making 2 babies plus all the stuff they need and your body has to make more blood and everything!
Flynn singing I’m a little teapot is my everything 🥺🥺✨
Food = Energy for: 2 growing babies, and their brains 1 adult Mom and her energy dependant brain = Eating food 24/7
We knew twins that were Justin and Casey (so they were just in case) so sometimes there are fun ways to name twins that has more to do with how they go together and how they stand on their own too!!
Flynn is SO big what even he's so cute :)
I was the same when I was pregnant with my son. Try  eating something with a little more protein. Eggs, grilled, chicken, oatmeal...
"Ice cream I just said it" my fave Flynn quote by far😂😂😂
i saw "triplets" and had a heart attack I fell on the floor omg
I just keep replaying the part when Flynn said “ it’s ice cream... I just said it”
"I'm not a fan of cherry" Quoted by, Colleen Ballinger
When is first ultrasound video coming put?
I get what Colleen was talking about with the names of the twins. She said she doesn't want rhyming names but name that go together. Like Ava and Katie, or Caleb and Logan. I feel like those go together
stop hating on her about her eating habits, she's pregnant, with TWO OR THREE baby's. she needs the extra weight and food to help the baby's grow.
Omg Colleen big fan by the way congrats on the pregnancy. I'm so exacted for you. Cant wait to the babies in your vlogs. Congrats 😁
i know some twins called millie and molly and they are identical in every way! scary
when flynn "spilled" it 😂 and when he said "ice cream i just said it" he’s so freaking cute
OMG I’m a triplet I can’t tell you how amazing it is and the bond we have!!!!!
My cousins are twins and we’re born “naturally”. They were 31 minutes apart. The doctor delivered the first one, then went to deliver another baby, and then delivered the second one.
good afternoon/morning/night everyone. I hope you all have a wonderful day today. have fun, stay safe work hard be humble Stay positive and remember to TREAT PEOPLE WITH KINDNESS also you are all amazing people.
I love you so queen. You are the sweetest kindest most caring amazing human ever. I could never thank you enough for all you have done for me in my life. You are the best mom ever to the sweetest cutest toddler ever with the biggest personality and twins. Erik is so loving supportive and encouraging. You are the most beautiful person inside and out. You have benefited my life in so many ways and have had such a positive impact on me. Thank you for making me smile daily and bring joy to my world. I truly don’t know the person I would be without you. I’m so proud of you and all you have accomplished in your life. There are no words to describe how much you mean to me and how amazing you are. Thank you for being the sunshine in mine and so many others life. Thank you for getting me through tough times and making me so happy. Love you to the moon 🌙 and back. 💜💕❤️💙🌻🍪💛🌵🐢🚗
bro what you were talking about at the start i always feel like that. like i need to be eating always and im sure not pregnant. it is truly awful
If you feel hungry when your pregnant then eat until your no longer hungry, if you dont eat their could be some serious complications in your pregnancy. Also you should feel comfortable eating whatever you want even when your not pregnant as long as your being active and stay healthy.
omgg!
I love these vlogs so much ! I’m so happy Colleen decides to share some of her life with us 🧡🧡🧡
I love how they say Flynn can “pickle” the toy he wants!! So adorable!!!
Someone please tell colleen that they sell "puppy chow" and it's called mussy buddies from chex lol
flynn’s little “i just said it…..” PLS
My blood sugar would drop really quickly when I was pregnant and my midwife told me to just “graze” all day, like keep almonds or grapes or whatever I could stomach in the beginning to keep from those shaky spells. I wasn’t hungry my blood sugar took a hit with my pregnancies 🥰
Have you ever tried that thing where you hum if you’re nauseous? Idk it may not work, I haven’t had to try it 😅 but I just wanted to suggest anything that could help right now! Love you!
“Ice cream, I just said it...” We don’t deserve Flynn🤣🤣❤️
8 minutes ago! Wow I’m early
Did you find the carrots?
Flynn is so sassy and I love it!! ❤️
YESS COLLEENS CORNER IS COMING BACKKKK
OMG WTH
Flynn is so good! Like he put all the other toys back while singing like an adorable angel after picking (pickling) one toy! Colleen and Erik are such good parents 😍
how do people not love colleen. like if you don't have this intense love for her you aren't human.
You need to get your thyroid levels checked for hyperthyroidism. Constant hunger and thirst plus the shaking are some signs for thyroid problems.
Nicole and Kasey are good names but you can do what you like
try eating snacks that are higher in protein and bigger more hardy meals! I know its hard because the nausea makes it so only a few things are barrable to eat, but that's what helped me when I was pregnant with my daughter.  <3 You are doing great Mama can't wait to meet these two cuties!
My heart melted at 3:32 when Flynn started singing the Teapot Song 🥺💜🥺💜
I clicked so fast when i saw the title
hey colleen. with your symptoms, you may have low blood sugar. i recommend getting test strips, a poker thing and a tester at walmart, you can ask a pharmacy employee what you need to check it bc idk the names of it. that way you can figure out if your low or not :)
"Grandma needs eggs" -Flynn, 2021~
i freaking love you
Omg I cant believe they think your having triplets. I cant. There are only 2 babies in there people. I cant wait to find out the gender
Flyn:it’s chocolate ice cream Eric:what is it Flyn:chocolate ice cream Flyn:I just said it
Oh baby you need way more calories when your pregnant because you’re literally MAKING TWO PEOPLE inside of you. Eat what you need and get a variety of nutrients. Also don’t listen to me or anyone else cause we ain’t your doctor!!
oh gosh remember over 2 years ago when that psychic said that Flynn would definitely have another sibling, and now he's gonna have 2 siblings???? 🥺💗
I have never Click on video so fast I was the Word Tiplets I got scared
Eric: what’s in here? Flyn: icecream...... i just said it  😂😂😂😂
You could not tell me that Flynn is not the cutest thing you have ever seen ☺️
You should not feel bad your eating what your body needs to grow those beautiful babies you may feel sick but you look good 🙂
love you
Wait I enjoyed this video so much
Hi
I loveee youuuuu
I cannot get over how cute Flynn is and when he is singing
Hi Colleen! I know you were eating that Chex stuff, and you were asking what people call it. I call it Muddy Buddies, but I don’t know what other people call it. They are sooo good tho!!
Lmao nvm what I just said there aren’t
When is She going to post Miranda videos again? Did I miss her saying something about that?
Wow, 3? I could never do that, or even twins, that's a lot!
When Flynn said "lets try some eggs" IT WAS SO CUTE!!!!
I love that Flynn "spilled" the "juice" during play, that's adorable
I ✨FLEW✨ TO THIS VIDEO SEEING THE TITLE
Hi
wait so is she having twins or triplets
When I was shaky during the first trimester, cheese was literally my saviour! it stopped the shaking and baby really liked the cheese too so that helped lol
You have such a sweet sweet son. Really adorable. xXx
# Loving the hair
hearing Flynn sing "I'm a little teapot" melted my heart! I just came from watching his birth video!
I laughed so hard at " it's ice cream. I just said it."
DAMNNN IMAGINE HER WITH TRIPLETS-
HAPPY Tuesday Colleen and fans :)
I clicked on this so freaking quick that I dropped my computer while in class. Just seeing TRIPLETS IN HER TITLE. Bro.... don’t scare me like that❤️
I had the same in the beginning I kept shaking and being jittery if I didn’t est enough. I was told not to gain weight because I am already heavy. I ended up losing weight due to my thyroid. And you do not have to excuse yourself for talking about your pregnancy. It is one of the biggest things in your life right now. The fact that you are doing it again after your first traumatic experience is pretty badass and super brave! Thank you for sharing your story! ❤️
What if Colleen named her twins Miranda and Patrick or Miranda and Emily 😂😂🤣🤣
The tea party looked so fun
Just got back from my trampoline and see triplets but then read the rest
When Flynn said “I just said it...” I felt that deep in my soul
Omg my heart absolutely melted when Flynn pickled the tea pot and started singing 🥰🥰🥰 he is the most amazing little boy y’all are so lucky to have been blessed with such a perfect little man. He is going to teach his babies so much as they grow.👶👶❤️❤️❤️
You are eating lots of sweets it might be a girl?
Flynn is so adorable and funny
Flynn is so cute and happy all the time I love himmmmm ^w^
omg is that ariana’s real hair i see
OMG I LOVE THE INTRO
I clicked faster than Flynn can say, “Dar Dar!!!”
I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT FLYNN IS THE CUTEST LITTLE BEING IN THE WORLD SO THAT MEANS THE TWIN ARE GOING TO BE MEGA CUTE JUST LIKE FLYNN
I always look to see how long the vlog is to see how many minutes of bliss I get lol.
hello
All I saw was triplets!!!
Don't scare me like that Colleen
i love your chan
Colleen, I would definitely get a glucose meter and check your bloodsugars when you feel that way.
Hey girl hey
The intro of Flynn is so cute
Wow never been this early
Omg as you’re reading this comment Colleen is having bloodwork done to see the genders of the twins!
NO BABY TO 2 BABYS TO MAYBE 3?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
You might need more protein?? I’m not sure, I’m not a nutritionist at all, but I know protein keeps you full longer and is just generally good for you. Not trying to give you any unsolicited advice! You do whatever your body needs, just a thought I had.
This better be a joke the other day I felt bad for her cause she is having to babies but good cause she is having a two babies and she she talking about the rumor of twins I can’t
I love Flynn’s little “Uh oh, I spilled it!”
My mom got diabetes while preggers with twins! Your blood sugar could be weird if you’re all shakey!!
OMGG flynn just melts my heartttt  (Ps sorry if I spelt his name wrong I'm so sorry )
I have never clicked faster in my lifeee
Heavenly Father I pray that you keep the person reading this alive, safe, healthy and financially blessed Amen☔️
What is she having triplets because she said “ in this case 3” when she was talking about food
2:29 I never noticed this picture of Mirandas on the wall of the corridor lol
OMG TRiPLErSSSsS I clicked faster than Flynn could say I'm vlogging
Those who haven’t been pregnant don’t really know that the baby takes nutrients from you. Having twins takes a heck of a lot more from you. Of course you’re eating all the time. Every body reacts differently to pregnancy, you’re doing great.
Actually, people who are underweight or on the thinner side tend to gain more weight during pregnancy, but everyone is different.
You are so motivating never stop talking about pregnancy it’s making me more comfortable for the future baby or babies I hope to have!
The rainbow teapots on the first day of pride month 🌈🫖! HAPPY PRIDE MONTH
Omfg that title gave me a heart attack. Bless your soul. If that becomes real you are gonna have one big ol happy family.
I feel like Flynn was still talking about dar dars and now he’s speaking in complete sentences!!! He’s growing up so fast!
Hiiii
Do you now the song goodbye buy post Malone
You should reach out to brooklyn and bailys mom to learn more about twins
If you have triplets: Rip that p***y
Omg flynn singing I'm a little tea pot my heart melted
KAIISJSJWJDUWJWKJWISJEJWMWJDJENE WHAT I haven’t watched the video yet but I’m freaking out possibly TRIPLETS (it was my b.day on the 31st hehehehehhe)
Girl rn its almost 23:30 and girl im tirreeeddd so I am gunna save this and watch it tomorrow morning. Something to look forward to!
i love when flynn gets to pickle from the box UGH ITS SO CUTE
I have diabetes and when your sugar gets low, you feel heavy and more shaky. I suggest if you go out, pack one or two juice boxes. Just small ones! Because if you don’t eat, your sugar drops. I hope this helps!  Edit: and also, everywhere I go, I bring a bag filled with a few juices, some candy, and just my phone and other things. I love it because you an sneak some things in school!🤣
Hi everyone !! 🐣🐣
I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3333 im upsested with your vids, its bad.... just girlie things :D
I clicked faster than Flynn could say “i’m vlogging!”
Flynn singing is so heartwarming. It’s so adorable 🥰💙💛💜❤️

Can we appreciate how ADORABLE Flynn sounds in the intro! 💕

Ah! The Pickle Present thing is so cute!! 😭
Flynn singing “I’m a little tea pot” is THE CUTEST!!! 🥺🥺🥺
I’m so exited that Colleen is having twins!!!!!! 👯‍♀️
Omg when he sings I’m a little teapot my heart melted! I was like he couldn’t get any cuter and then he sings!
Also who is literally OBSESSED with Colleen like she is the person that will put a smile on my face and will make me feel ok! And she is always doubting herself! She literally AMAZING❤️❤️🥰
😱 OMG I am waaay to excited
Omg I can't wait to watch the vid lol 😀
Never been this early!! 🙀🙀🙀
Omggggg...  Hello ... I should be sleeping its 4 am ... But the notification .... I had to click
i cannot get over how amazing of a mom you are. it’s like this is what you are meant to do
I saw the word “triplets” in capital letters and my jaw dropped 😂 until I read the other bit, “rumours about” lol
I clicked faster then I could read the title
When she say pregnancy is all I'm talking about so get used to it😂😂 I love it! I get to be apart of her Journey it's amazing who else agrees
I can’t believe it could be triplets oh my god!
💖💖💖
Hi😀
I love this women
✨FrANchEsCa ans SWeEd✨
Heyyyyy!!! ❤️❤️❤️ Enjoy the last week of school!
Colleen you are amazing. I am twelve. I have crohns disease I had a really hard time with it bc I found out in the "great" year of 2020. Your vlogs got me through it and I can't thank you enough.  Also I love when you talk about your adhd bc I have it as well. You are my favorite YouTuber. Thank you for the joy you bring me.
Babies need the food for nourishment probably so those babies are hungry probably ❤️
i clicked so freaking fast that i did not  realise that the title said triplets
Each individual is different… Do what works for you and you are pregnant with twins, so your body definitely needs more in nutrients and so yeah. You know, everyone always knows everything about everything. Do you
COLLEEN MY MOM LET ME BUY MY 5th PAIR OF MERCH!!!! I’m so excited
I LITERALLY CANT GET OVER FLYNNNN... flynn through the magnify glass O-o then he says ice cream... i just said it 🙄
Wow hiiii 💕
POV: your here 29 after she posted :)
1 minute ago and already 10k views?
I love you colleen
Flynn is adorable serving tea.😆🥰
Hey gitl
TRIPLETS!? No way! Can’t wait to watch this!
I almost died when Flynn was singing “I am a teapot short and stout” and the rest of the song   SOOO CUTE
U should have your blood sugar checked
Colleen, you literally are the biggest inspiration to me. You are such a strong and powerful woman. I swear you could move mountains. You really further my definition of what it means to be a strong woman. Seeing your growth over the years I've watched you is so inspiring to me, I'm only 17, but you've helped me see how far I could go on my personal journey. Not to mention you've made me so excited to be a mom one day. Thank you colleen. Ily❤
Clicked SSSSOOOOO FAST i literally sit around and wait on your notifications, your the absolute best and I am so happy for you and your amazing family on the twins! I can not wait to see how Flynn reacts to the babies after they come home. 🥰
O
Colleen you might need more protein. That's what happens when I'm low on protein, I get shaky.
I loved watching you on the pyjama cast party u were amazing
i love you colleen!
Who else is excited to see what she names the twins!!! (Also to see the gender!)   Comment what you think are good twin names! I’m rooting for Francesca and Tweed! 😂😂😂
If she had triplets I would’ve lost my mind lol
Hiiiiiii
This is what I pickle 🥺🥺🥺
Sounds like possible gestational diabetes. I was diagnosed at 13ish weeks! I would tell your OB about it and maybe get an early 1 hour glucose test! It could be nothing but I felt the same way and felt like I’d pass out if I didn’t eat every few hours.
You have twins you can eat whatever you want ❤️
I love how she is having triplets ❤️😌
Freaking love colleen
omg that would be so amazing if they were triplets 😆😆literally love you so much!
I’m 1 minutes early
Colleen just casually showing a picture of her and Ariana Grande!🤣 Everyone Else: ahhh oh my gosh a picture with Ariana freaking Grande!!
POV: Everyones scrolling in the comments to see if shes having triplets
Early
It’s been like less than a minute and there already almost 500 comments 🤯
When I read the title all I saw was "TRIPLETS!!"and I was like OMG! then I reread the title lol 😂
You are so strong 💖
Flynn singing is my absolute favorite part 🥺♥️
2 minutes ago hey Colleen
colleen, i hope what ever the babies are are healthy! I know you think the same but you and Erik will love them no matter what how many there are!
I was so scared that she is gonna had triplets because she is so tiny and thats so many babies at the same time.
Comment what genders you think the twins are! I say a boy and a girl!
HIGIHIHIH
WAIT IM SCARED TO WATCH THIS VIDEO
COLLEEN! if one of the babies is a girl, maybe you could call her stella? i think it’s a beautiful name and it means star. but that name is connected to your grandmother i believe? 💜💜💜💜  edit: apparently estella is the middle name of alice estella conklin, colleens great great great grandmother (her grandfathers grandmother).
Hi Colleen i love how much you are your self and you helped me and you made a great a community :D
my heart was racing when i clicked this 💀💀
I’m positive that you are going to have a boy and girl, or both girls and another boy pregnancy, go back and look at the that you did with your friend that she told your future or something I forgot what it called, but she said 2 boys!! Edit: with the psychic
I know how you feel 20 weeks this friday and always hungry
I clicked faster thank the test showed pregnant.
Me reading the title: WaiIiIiIIiITTttTTTt? WOooOoooOoOooOooOOt?
