5 years on we know them injection s,are dangerous  and just don't work   ,I never took that junk  and now all my friends are sick  and some  dead
None of them were happy but were not strong enough to say.
Lock javid up
This was such a pivotal moment. This burst the vaccine mandate collective psychosis. I can remember the relief. Hats off to that doctor.
This interview convinced me not to get jabbed,  best decision I’ve ever made
Final statement at the end…only 10% of staff were wise & followed their conscience! 90% were dumb@$$e$!!!
This man changed my life during covid Dr Steve James a man of honour
I thank this doctor for his part in ending the mandate.  It wasn't long after this they did a U-turn. I still have my job thanks to this brave doctor for speaking out.
Yes I agree and respect  this Doctor for speaking up and of course the Science does indeed support his decision 🙏
That didn’t age well, did it?! The doctor was right but quite understated the case and should have extrapolated to the whole population. Hindsight, but for those awake definitely accurate insight at that moment in time.
Vaccine experts = vaccine salesmen.   Used car experts = used car salesmen.
Much respect for this doctor. Wish they were all this sensible.
Watching this now, god we should have all listened to him!!!
Not just a brave, incredible doctor but also a gentleman who clearly recognised how uncomfortable those nurses were and stepped up. These people worked 'at the coal face' and were far more experiened to talk about this subject than some ignorant politician. During that awful time this doctor's calm, level headed approach stuck with me more than any other rhetoric which came out.
Well.  He's sacked.
Yes health Secretary, there are different views. That is why it is your job to present the different views, and let people decide for themselves. This has not aged well Javid. The doctor was right, who’d have guessed. The silence from the nurses was deafening.
1.55 Someone's not happy about the Dr sticking up for himself..!!
After this video things suddenly changed ..hood for him showing them up
The very best advice from psychopaths!
So this was on the 7th of January . on the 24th of February the Ukraine war started and all this ended......funny that??
"That's your view." The blasé dismissal of a credible, reasoned, and patient consultant still grates on me, even two years later. I'll never forget the coercive tactics used to push experimental gene therapy, threatening livelihoods if we didn’t comply. I'm honestly surprised SKY hasn't banned the comments, but then again, it's Friday, and life seems normal—wine o'clock for most people.
And it caused blood clot…
And don't forget it wasn't a vaccine the Doctor who invented this sed it was not a vaccine but there stoped him talking about it and called him a lair os name is dr marlone
This video sums up Sajid's ignorance and arrogance
Doctors were not listed to. The science didn't allow it. Who's science was it? It was never a vaccine.
I loved how the doctor came forward and protected his staff. Very good logical advice
It’s the mark of the beast don’t fall
They took advice from expert bodies who are in the pockets of big pharma which predominantly funds the bodies that regulate it.
Self determination is the basic human right.  Everyone decides for themselves to feel protected or not (no guarantees anyway), no other does that for anyone else. There are many lies spread during the massive pushing of the vaccines.
idiots
I am a doctor also agree with this brave doctor. As a Radiologist I see the devastating effects of the jab. This politician should be prosecuted for his arrogance and mistake of bullying millions into unnecessary experimental jab
I cannot stop watching this just to remind me how much bullshit comes our mps talk
I would say this brave man is the reason many nhs staff and carers ended up keeping the jobs and not having the jabs as the mandate got dropped days after this interview
💪💪💪💪💪
Where is this health minister now? finny how all the politicians and so called experts advising them have all disappeared in to shadow.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Brave man.
Crime i nals!!! Did we realize that yet three years on?
Absolute HERO!!! Articulating perfectly what a lot of health professionals were feeling.  One day away from being dismissed from the profession we love!!! I will never forget the feeling of relief when Javid U-turned on the mandate. I feel that Dr James played a big part in influencing the U-turn with this public display of pressure and truth! I still fear that a mandate is around the corner after all the lies have been revealed. The public want be so trusting and obedient with the next virus…
So 5 nurses are struggling to give the answer that HE wants...now, multiply those 5 nurses across every hospital within the NHS.
I remember listening to this at the time and thinking Thank God someone has had the courage to speak out.  As an NHS Healthcare Professional I had been taken off clinical duty (University Hospital Southampton Trust) who were the ONLY Trust in UK who stopped un vaccinated clinical staff from practicing from September 22 to March 23 when they overturned the decision because of this man - DR STEVE JAMES.  Moral courage is a wonderful thing. Respect.
evil government
It is the new Lysenkoism, and much more popular too. Popular worldwide this go around.  It declares itself as "the science", or should I say it identifies as "the science".  Not going along with it goes almost as well as not going along with Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union.  But how can all of those highly esteemed and highly credentialed experts who signed off on this "up and down the chain" be wrong?  Arguments From Authority are the main arguments being made here.  That was the biggest tell of all.  Expertism has failed us yet again.  The expert class has failed us yet again.  The propaganda is still working, at this late date, on the mass of men led so easily by the masters of men.  One looks at how easy it was and wonders less how some of the horrors of the twentieth century happened. One can see how easily the magic trick is done. One can see the man behind the curtain.
This doctor is an angel
Difference being, the surgeon is giving advice based on science.  Whereas SJ got his based on what he was told do to by who would make the most money and pr9vide the biggest kick backs
Doctor is living proof vaccine is unnecessary
All this time late and we are still dealing with the fallout in so many ways. Please keep commenting on this video.
Anyone else still appreciating this absolute legend of a doctor in 2024??  Genuinely believe this guy single handedly changed the narrative by speaking out 👏👏
when can i get a booster ?
The plandemical orchestra to sell the product lol glad I have a brain and I understood everything in May 2020
Excess deaths...let's talk about the excess deaths
That doctor was 100% correct
What happened to this doctor?
Javid didn't have any meaningful arguments to disagree. Just that they take advice from "vaccine experts". Are those the experts who work for the vaccine companies?
Co za draństwo wyrzucać z pracy etycznego lekarza, który głośno mówi prawdę!
This is exactly right and THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT REASON not to let WHO anywhere near mandating global policy.
6 days passed by still suspended only? That means he can fight a case in court and if he wins he can get his salary reimbused from nhs
Because of this Hero Doctor that make me think twice about NHS or a GP  no more trust.   Thanks Doctor the reason I’m still alive is because one of this Hero Doctors still here 🎉🎉🎉🎉
The purpose of these pandemics is to promote the need for stay-at-home absentee balloting.  This promotes election rigging and selective vote destruction….
Lies lies lies. Good on that doctor. 2yrs later and does anyone feel different about the jibjab.
1:15 Its called an election and vote is that consideration.
That was such a set up.
Full admiration for this Doctor. Clear comprehensible explanation of the nonsensical government approach.
Sajid Javid sent so many to the death sentence.
They all lied
After Omicron 1, the vaccines dont protect.   Medical lecture  https://youtu.be/npQ1X0C3R8w ..
Vaccine lies direct from the government  .
Why isn't there study on the millions who didnt need the crina vax and didnt take it who are completely healthy?? ( My retired pharma friend said ' that wont make any money)..
Truth.  Good job doctor.
The doctor is very brave. If I was sick I would say yes to being his patient.
Well this went down well for the government
‘1 in 35’
Nothing matters apprently if able to care ❤
What exactly is going on with our nhs😮❤
based  never jabbed never masked never swabbed cucklords can cry about it
Savage jabhead didn't have a clue he's a puppet being manipulated by those above
This guy will go down in history.
How RIGHT was the doctor! Never forget the culprits.
I never got vaccinated  I never got covid politicians  and the media news have been lying to everyone
I wonder what happened to that guy?, he had some bollox standing up to that clown Javid. I hope he won the argument and was not dismissed.
What an important and satisfying moment this was....
Crazy times . Politicians telling doctors about medicine
They call it “the jab”?!? I thought that was a pejorative… 😂🤣
Only cowards and fools acquiesce.
Would that politican revel is vacation status then and would he be going for covid shots today 23/09/2023
Biggest bull shine story ever, along with Climate crisis and the Royal family. Wakey Wakey
100% common sense. Well done for speaking honestly when your other colleagues just stood there. 👍 I agree!
God bless this REAL doctor
Life prison sentence for all doctors politicians media police and everyone involved with illegal Covid tyranny
It’s important to remember key elements during Covid leading to its current understood state like this video, to see savid Javid express himself this low as a man in light of honesty and professionalism shows the module of characters this country and institution produces
Well said that man rather listen to the drug companies than a doctor wonder why money to be made
💪💪💪
Crimes against humanity....like all he had to say to an expert was oh well another expert said so and that expert won't talk with any 9ther scientist or doctor to debate lol
Now this is why Doctors should become doctors.Risking his livelihood for the better of us.
The day war started in Ukraine the media stopped talking about virus despite the vaccination in Ukraine was very poor. Within a week 3 millions Ukrainians crossed the boarder without any health check related to Covid 19.  This shows how media represent corporations. I mean all media.
Actually this doctor should be in the seat of health minister not that weasel clown.
sajid... what a balloon.
I cant believe how far it had gone by this point, everything was becoming so predictable , variants, boosters etc yet people like this doctor were being painted as the bad guy.
OBVIOUSLY ANTIBODIES MUST WANE...BECAUSE THERE IS NO PATHOGEN...PPL WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND IMMUNOLOGY WILL BE TRAPPED...AND IM SO SHOCKED THAT MOST MEDICAL STAFF AROUND THE WORLD WERE FOOLED BY BIG PHARMA THRU MEDIA BOMBARDMENT ABOUT COVID 19
i am hitting the like button and its not registering.. anyone else experiencing this?
The biggest scam of all time
What is his name!
There are no unbiased scientists they tote the garbage of their employers, big pharma legal drug pushers! Thank God some, like this doctor have the integrity to tell the ACTUAL truth!
Nurses were to cowardly and scared to speak. Massive respect for the doctor.
80K vs 2,416 _Individuals_ in favor as of 05/08/23!  Says it all, really...
This aged like fine wine
Just think of the money drug companies make with monthly boosters
Safe and effective.... i see AZ has recently been banned in Australia 🤥🤔
And it turns out the best source of advice was stood right in front of him.
I’m a Kings student and I was complaining to my friend about how the teachers are way too bias, with anyone that disagrees with Marxism being shunned and called stupid and uneducated. She showed me this interview and how she greatly respects him along with a several few of staff.   People like this give me hope for our future.
Health secretary is short for "I'm gonna steal as much cash as I can and the people I harm and kill are irrelevant I just want what's due to me"
"And that's your view" completely dismissed 🤬
I hope Kings College are sued for negligence and common assault to all staff forced under duress to take this poison.
That's a real doctor who doesn't follow the bullshit
This didnt age well...for the government
Why does this media representative fight natural immunity so hard?
Javid is pure evil. Just like his predecessor Hancock. I hope they both face trials and get locked up for life.
If everyone stood up for what’s right we would have a different outcome .
Emergency in the NHS medics and politicians don't give a fudge in this crisis   How many politicians had the jab out of interest      What happening with the people whom are having heart attacks in Britain  and heart valve problems and blood clots  and the changing eye right after have that has been noticed in the elderly people   they go glassy and  cataracty  my elderly friends gone blind since  whom had NO eye probs before    all thus seems  to have links to the covid injections what about them. Even dictirs who werd for these havs are now  saying oh dear i was wrong given the data  afterwards  I don't know how long ago this interview was given but  I think awhile ago and   These nurses doctors were right not to  have jab   and i am greatful for them  abd their stand with the public whom like alot if us public have not had it ...
Here we are a year later-that doctor is absolutely correct.   We also now know about the negative effects of the shot and boosters.  The people promoting those shots, etc., are monsters.
Anyone taking jabs now must be crazy
What a legend, speaking on behalf of so, so many at the time.
Ahhh came back here to see what was going on. Glad I listened to my gut and didn’t fall for this bs, didn’t follow the lockdown guidelines, didn’t get vaccinated. Guys remember these people ain’t here to help us, anything the media and government show us, do the opposite!!
Good and sensible man.
Hero
It's about time we made sure all the politicians and their experts were fully up to date with their boosters.
I'm anti bioweapon
The last line was classic: We take the best advice....from the people that are vaccine experts. Boom 😂
Who is this doctor he is a true hero for speaking out early on . Love it ❤
No evidence that transmission is reduced.
The vaccines are doing more harm than COVID by the way things are coming to light tell me that's not true
🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
Stick ya fukin jab up ya arse!
Yes he's fighting when we all should
ONE PERSON had the balls. and in the right tplace at the right time, to SAVE ALL NHS STAFF from being FORCED to take an untested drug.. well done that man!! and badly managed VIDEO opportunity for SADDDICK JAVID ,,, one rebel got through your masquerade of trying to FORCE those poor nurses to say something against their will.. woo hoo,,, and NOW javid has stood down as an MP,, for the next election GOOD RIDDANCE,,, this DOCTOR proberbly save the whole of the UK from mandatory va(((ine passports!! ( for now at least) eternaly gratefull
This Doctor should of been Knighted for his services to mankind. However they chose to glorify Mr Whitty (the now elusive) figure of doom n gloom. The whole thing was a farce, luckily a few people saw through it a few months into the pandemic. Unfortunately it showed just how gullible, the vast majority of the population is, not giving any thought to what they are doing, nor questioning the rationale behind it all. I fear these people will truly pay the price in the ensuing years as the vaccine injury’s unfold.
Sajif Javid caught off guard  So what?
Get this doctor into parliament
And all this time later turns out the vaccines were never tested on preventing transmission, shame on them, the trauma caused to so many families...we will NEVER forget.
The doctor was right...
One person can change the world
He is right...why would this Doctor get vaccinated when he has natural immunity, and his point re boosters is spot on...am picking that many others working in hospitals have a similar view.
Doctor s who stood up in Ireland  and refused  to give this pison  got struck off the medical register
This Dr was so right.  So very very right
Brave doctor
Nine months later Pfizer admit they have not tested whether the vaccines they rolled out are effective,so what have they rolled out?
I 👏👏👏👏 this brave doctor for not only doing the RIGHT honerable thing of telling the TRUTH on national tv but for also taking a stand and stickn to wot he beleives is correct! We NEED MORE doctors like him especially in biased snob infested oxfordshire health authority in the uk!
From vaccine experts, murderers more like
Sure he got fired next day
And now that doctor was wise
Vaccine saved the world...
Super respect for this doctor
This is the truth now
An hero doctor ❤️
Well done. There are not enough people in this area speaking out against it. Took many people being sheep.
We take the very best advice we can from the people who are vaccine experts .....the makers of the poison
SANA CHUASNAGA
Health Secretary has no experience  in health or medical what so ever ... belittling  a medical professional . I'm on the Dr's side 10000%
Follow the science 🤣🤣🤣
I would had punch the bold guy ..
would have loved to seen his reaction when he firmly said "vaccine experts"  and to be corrected with "people profiting on vaccines"
Watch Javid's body language! Tells me everything I need to know.
Amazingly power and oil seems to be able to adjust its price as if it were a currency with a gene mutation. We could have done with more protection. Survive covid to go to a freezing home all winter is going to harm as many as covid has,if not more.
It's his view but it clearly doesn't matter :)
what a hero! DrBeen goes through a couple of research papers!  https://youtu.be/zyYq93YtScE
🐑🐑🐑😷😷😷💉💉💉 ☠️☠️☠️🚑🚑🚑⚰️⚰️⚰️
There are a few people that I will remember that had the courage to make a stand. He is one of those I will remember. Good on him.
THAT YOUNG DOCTOR WAS BRILLIANT!!! SAJID IS DEFINATELY NOT A GOOD PROSPECTIVE PRIME MINISTER!! HE WOULD HAVE US ALL LOCKED DOWN AGAIN, POISONED IN A HEARTBEAT!!!!
Note with meticulousness the green crap mask the doc has on compared to the N95 s the nurses have on.   Idiots in the NHS told me take my N95 mask off and put on a green 'thing' =70 % efficient with the greatest of luck and luck as I know has nothing whatsoever to do with catching what might be a death disease. N95 masks should have been and still should be the very minimum.   Asbestosis ring any bells?
Javid stands need to criticise the PM PPE the biggest lie since Mussolini was a young boy.... MASKS  = brain washing to the detriment and death of some individuals I would wager.
And this is proof that some doctors are dumb af.
Courageous
"That's your view"  It's not a view moron, it's science!
Usual mealy-mouthed statement from the hospital commisars. What c@nts.
This Doc on good morning Britain smashed it ! Well done doc.
Very courageous Dr, he is one of the minority, he has guts! He speaks Truth. God bless this Dr & all other medical staff speaking out with courage under these wicked times. Speaking Truth has become a revolutionary act
"So get your jab although there are NO REAL benefits to it." No. Build up antibodies; just like we've done with ALL OTHER FLUS."
Rishi sunak Early Investor In Moderna!
We need more people like him !
goddamn joke, I'm in constant pain and the nhs does not give a damn!
NHS service!  Is crap service since Coved🥺
What an incredibly brave doctor! He's brought hope to thousands of people I'm sure
Savage Javage
After seeing this I don't want javid in charge of anything I want him sacked
He may be a medical expert but not a vacine expert ive got covid and it would be significantly worse 8f I dint have it
He's rong
He doesn't pay his tax.
Jabid would be livid if he paid his taxes, because that way he might contribute to there wages.
masculine courage on display right there.
"vaccine experts" yeah alright
DIRTY FILTHY SCUMBAGS ALL ON THE FIDDLE
Stupid little squit. Typical passive agressive statement from the hospital. Commies.
I am a doctor and I 1000% support this brave doctor for speaking out and standing up.
Is firing highly trained doctors and nurses on mass really gonna benefit a already struggling NHS?
This man seen through the lies
santoran
The NHS needs to be shut down and replaced it's completely useless.
Devils in government
Hero
Sajid Javid asks for the opinion of health care staff on compulsory vaccination. The nurses never responded but he got more than he bargained for from the ITU doctor. So instead of listening an experienced and knowledgeable doctor who must remain upto date with top research to maintain the effectiveness of his practice, Javid shuts him down with some ignorant comment  just to maintain his political image. This is the so called healthcare secretary appointed by our clownminister.  What A Joke.
UK GOVERNMENT ARE COWARDS
To hell with vaccines
This man has my biggest respect. Been saying this for ages and the guy has literally voiced my opinion 🙌 hands up for this
At the end of the day I’m not commenting what side I’m on. However the NHS is so understaffed and so stretched they can’t afford to lose a handful of people never mind how many will walk. What’s happens. They have realised the threat hasn’t done anything and they can’t follow though with it 👍🏼
So I took a jab three times.. And now I have a dirty nasty pain down the left side of my body
This guy might be a doctor, but why does he think he is better qualified to make public health decisions than an expert epidemiologist?? The practice of anaesthetics have no bearing on virology! What a fu£king muppet, he should be stuck off for his ignorance, a danger to himself and his patients!!
Dr. Big Balls! Those nurse’s were literally petrified of speaking their opinion.
Is this politician in a school yard ? I hope he reads these comments and sacks himself !!
And just after this encounter covid has gone down the drain. I shouldn't have done the vaccine only time will tell what they injected in me
His science is completely right.  He is a doctor.  I dont agree with his decision.  But, Im glad He has stood up for what He believes and yes his facts are spot on.
Every Ukrainian should read "steal this book" by Abbi Hoffman. Once Russia is back on home territory then the Russian people should have that book.
I wish the nurse just called him an arse
I got 3 doses of vaccination. After that I became sick and feels depressed always.
This single video prevented me getting my top up.
the uk needs to experience another proper plague.. lol look at these people thinking they are above everyone else cause they are unvaccinated
how is this dude a doctor?
Lol very funny. Good man. Made Javed u turn the vaccine thing
Lmaoooo what an idiot
Danbutler
The NHS is a joke  the amount of money they wast is un real iknow this as I work for them plus the people in maid up positions on huge wages the reason our hospitals are over run is because they shut down 10 to build 1 new one
NHS need to grow stardawg and mamorsa and dish it out to defeat covid 19 to the people in England ⁰
https://youtu.be/iulvEmAmtcQ
Supprised they showed this, all a mute point now because the government backtracked, it was an empty threat to push sales, i mean vaccination numbers up. That dr schooled that dickhead hard.😄👍
So this "doctor" think if he had a COVID he will have antibodies for his lifetime? Real reason for vaccine is if lots of people get vaccine in short time and they will have antibodies then virus can't spread, why people can't understand it.
Save the NHS they said! Look at the pages and pages of dangerous adverse reactions to the vaccines!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I knew all along with the others with brains but now the vaxed can read the incredidbly large amount of pages for themselves. They did not want these released until 2097!
I feel this was the turning point for Legacy media's coverage of Covid
This guy lost his job and pension the GMC is investigating him for a trumped up charge like bringing the profession into disrepute
If it wasn’t for this Dr,  this con would be still conning the nation. Fact
Everything the NHS doctor said about this vacation to the health secretary was right and he has a lot of courage but the health secretary didn't want to hear it and didn't expect that reaction.
This video is gold
He’s awake 😷💉🦠
He’s nose what a boyo
I trust the doc 👍
The system will crumble without nurses … bottom line. Unfortunately most nurses have been brainwashed to follow orders that dates back to Florence Nightmare… Hopefully we have enough Erin Brockovich’s  in our profession to advocate for the nurses that work in the hospital or push for a strike until we get our freedoms back… Being a RN isn’t worth a lancet and hospital bag for yearly nurses week appreciation anymore! Right now nurses are running and vacating this field faster than we can count with no reservations. Hospitals better be prepared for mass shortages and paying the same nurses they fired 4 times more as a agency nurses to come and save their stupid butts…  To top it off they still won’t be vaccinated … and they will have to pay them 4 times more to meet safe staffing … how ironic and rewarding that day will be lol
All roads lead straight to the bank for the pharmacies. There would be no laws surrounding this if it wasn't for the money involved. Captain obvious yeah yeah.
They're pushing this vaccine so hard, and in such insane ways, that one would swear they've got an agenda.
This is SO typical of our dismissive culture towards any doctor with an opinion that's different from a government doctor.  Being written off as "not an expert" never would have happened if this doctor agreed with vaccine mandates.
Hes in a tough spot,outnumbered by far.  Hope he can stand true..  imagine using science to fight made up numbers.
Bravo
He'll be fired of found dead watch, god bless him
He smashed every argument. Boost staff every month.
The nurses clearly weren’t happy either.
Check out pro ject Veritas it's all for money. These people need to be locked up.
Ahh, u can almost taste whose opinion is actually worth their salt in this scene. Truly fine cuisine. 10/10.
I was really I’ll with Covid but I now have better immunity  Fuk your vaccine!
There's just something about Sajid Javid which invokes extreme mistrust but I can't say what it is.
They stopped the restrictions because enough of us said no to the lies and utter crap spouted by mainstream media like sky 😂😂😂😂💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
See a lot of people regret getting it but they don’t want to admit it they’re angry that they were deceived I don’t wanna except it and they want to continue in denial even though they’re seeing the truth
Good ! More need to be brave like him ! People are living fear to stand what is right!
That's right, the science is not strong enough
No more requirements, no more mandates whatsoever!
When we look back on this in ten years this chap will stand out from the crowd big time. Shame most people have no backbone in the U.K. what an embarrassing two years it’s been.
Think as a PLANK our Health Secretary. The press and politicians have run amuck with COVID  mania. Time to wake up folks.
Vaccine experts.. ok
Glory be to God almighty after many years, finally i have found joy with the help of DR JADU OINDIN on YouTube, the great herbal doctor help me cure my HSV 2, with the herbal medicine product I ordered. I will forever be greatful to DR JADU OINDIN on YouTube thanks 🙏  herpes gone finally ….❤️
Hero.
I could literally vote for labour rather than Javid if he was to lead to conservative party, and I think labour a complete disgrace on most issues. Javid just seemed like a complete prat
Doesn’t he have to take seasonal flu vaccination and others?  In the US anyone working in hospitals are all required to have all vaccinations, COVID is no different
The truth hurts liars . Much respect. Keep up the great work doctor 👍 👏 💪
They are the front line, they know what happened there! Stop lies about vaccine!
AMEN Baby, Keep Spreading The TRUTH!!!!!
I had my vaccine because I wouldn’t be able to work without it, how this doctor managed not to have it and still work? I wanted to be in his position because it makes sense of what he said.
Facts
And the other 2500 itu consultants that have had a vaccine don’t make news.
The white shirt Official not listening to a Frontline Doctor giving him first hand experience knowledge. The white shirt is a fool.
I have no trust in Sajid Javid, hes the worst person that should ever have been appointed to run the whole bloody country, what has UK government done to this country, they are going to forever regret putting him in this post, Mark my words.
Good man
People clapped for that Doctor what a joke
A doctor who does not believe in medicine needs to removed from the medical field. He thinks he knows everything like he has studied covid for years. Let's be honest most doctors are  just walking, talking textbooks, they are simply glorified nurses.
The science is not strong enough…”that’s your opinion aye”
That doctor should be struck off. He is not an immunologist. He is commenting outside his speciality. . The title doctor is no guarantee of smartness and knowledge. That is why doctors have consultants and specialists.
Is that consultant still working there? Or has he lost his job already?
Good man!
Imagine a bus driver that doesn't want to respect the speed limit or red lights "because he's wearing a seat belt "
How can the doc even carry around such balls speaking in TV about not getting vaxed.
That's awkward 😂
I genuinely believe there is a link between vitamin D and this viruses severity. I want to state my honest experience with covid so far.  My entire family got sick including me and my identical twin brother. A month or so before I had a blood test that told me I had a vitamin deficiency so I was taking vitamin D tablets. Me and my twin brother live very similar lives, same diet, exercise and routines etc. My brother was incredibly ill for 3 weeks. I was fine (I had a migraine for a day and then I recovered). All my other family members were very ill too in a similar way to my brother. My brother and I are genetically the same, we live incredibly similar lives and the biggest factor between us was I was taking vitamin D tablets as I was very deficient. It's only natural he'd be deficient in vitamin D too and he happened to get very ill whereas I was completely fine. It's either luck, strange coincidence or those vitamin D tablets played a key role in why I recovered so fast.
We need more antibodies in parliament
This guy should be health minister for a few reasons… First he don’t need expert’s opinion…  Second he knows what’s he talking about…
That final text from his employer is interesting. It's basically saying we don't agree with our doctor. Please get jabbed. If the vaccine truly had very little effect, why has the death rate come down so much....
The health secretary had nothing to say, they can't afford to vaccinate people every month
Hero
Do like the muggy Chief Exec in the background filling his pants and desperately wanting to usher things on. He is a klingon just like the rest of these people who can't exercise I bit of critical thinking about how or how not effective this vaccine may really be in those younger.
Stop the forced drug injections into peoples' bodies!
smart doctor
Don't know what the doctor is babbling about...a bit protection after one month and worn off after two month? There are proof it still works after 7 month. There is also a new vaccine now that should have longer protection... it's just matter of time until they find a vaccine that last very long. I have taken a vaccine that still works after 30 years
Medical expert vs economist.
FreedomOfChoice!
About time we see a doctor that is refusing it. Tired of all these doctors saying how great the vaccine is. Good on him. Try telling a doctor he's wrong lol.
Finally, someone who isn't stupid!!!!!
Ask yourself : "why now are sky allowing another side to be heard"  When all along there have been doctors and other qualified professionals speaking out against the measures.
That doctor should be sacked
YouTube have capped the views on this should be way more than 2.6mil by now
Now thats the doctor I definitely admire to speaking up to his knowledge. I'm unvaccinated myself
What the doctor seemed to be arguing for was monthly jabs.
Aged like fine wine 🍷
Salute to this doctor.
Selfish and arrogant! Wouldn't want him treating me!
90% of the sheep have the injection 😂 i first learned about sheep in year 2 when everyone put there hand up for the right or wrong answer. People copy the majority
Good for doctors like him.... stand up
💖this doctor
Protect him at all costs for telling his truth
Its disgusting that this is happening.  We still dont know the long term effects of taking the jab . Force is never the answer.
Knows what he’s talking about he’s a dr see what’s going on other guy just didn’t like what he has to say cause not the answer was looking for just looking for the lies n bs
Finally, someone with balls that spits the truth .
This man was our saviour …  It’s after this confrontation and destroying health secretary with fact that they did u-turn on their mandates..  the doctor also filed a case against the mandate because it does not have any medical , scientific basis to mandate this vaccine and forcing staff to be coerced into it.. the government know if the case goes to court evidence will have to be presented so they quickly shut it down…
Every time a minister visits any medical facility,  they usually manage to find a Lamebour stooge. Usually  a union commissar.
Dr Steven James a true hero.
Not everyone has antibodies , I think the science backing the efficiency of the vaccine is pretty conclusive
That is one confident Dr! We won’t ever know everything but everyone has a right to decide for themselves their outcomes, good or bad.
NHS is out of order. It is sad but most of the staff is using coronavirus in their benefit. They do nothing for people and they clearly do not care.   Not even going to nhs anymore, as apart from tge telephone call is impossible to see the doctor.
Savid is ignorant like other from current Government members. Not surprised watching that ridiculous video, forcing people to say something positive about vaccines otherwise they will be sacked.
He claims he understands but does nothing mandatory vaxes SHOULD NEVER BE allowed
Huge Respect to this doctor 👏
That last comment by the bald guy really says it all, he doesn’t respect the doctor’s intelligence, because he’s not a “vaccine expert.” Seems like he knows more than the self proclaimed experts do
Why is a former banker a health secretary? Why does the former banker want to dismiss an anaesthetist and defer to nurses whom aren't comfortable answering?
It's funny cause the guys is like trust me I'm a doctor and the other guy says trust the vaccine expert. I thought a doctor's opinion is pretty valid still?
Why do people insist on seeking out careers in helping others, if they refuse to keep those they help safe as possible.
I hope these "vaccine experts" are at least as competent as the "computer modelling experts" were!
“From the people who are vaccine experts”  Aka the people selling us the vaccines.
Vaccines experts don’t exsiste it’s all political agenda to control us , let’s go Brandon
WELL DONE that doctor I applaud him
😁
"from the people that are vaccine experts" 😭😭😭😭
Love watching this. Cool calm collected doctor
Just wondering; why are so many people missing the most relevant part of that anaesthetist's stance? He'd already contracted Covid 19, hence he was protected from reinfection by antibodies. Any NHS staff who have not already contracted and recovered from Covid will not be in the same situation.
Interesting that KCH chose unvaccinated staff to be meet Javid.There is more to this than meets the eye. Its all planned folks.
I feel so bad for this guy
Health Secretary with no education in medical field. Good Job United Kingdom. Such a disappointment!
Wait that can't be true, an antivaxxer wearing a mask? A ruse for sure!
exercising the attempts at being powerful humans on Gods green earth
big respect for speaking out 👏🏻 by FACTS
The fact that healthcare workers don’t want to get vaccinated is concerning cause I’m sure they know more than us
The secutery trys to belittle doctor by saying we get advise by vaccine experts the doctor is probley more qualified than the secutery is
Steve James...TOP bloke...maintained credibility...integrity intact...👊🏾
Just two things I have noticed in this clip,    1. Why does Steve James have a different mask on from the rest of the staff members considering he works in critical care? Should he not have the appropriate mask on especially in that specific setting? 2. Under no circumstances are nhs staff allowed jewellery, loose fittings, apart from a (wedding ring band) around all clinical areas, why does Steve James have a watch on? Something doesn’t seem right……  Feels really staged.
Vaccination should be compulsory for everyone
That guy should get sacked. It's absolutely shocking that he's still practicing!
The doctor makes a really good point, something government advisors have not considered or are just ignoring
Minister was trying to brush him off,but the Dr. Stated facts. More healthworkers should cm forward,the silence by the nurses was upsetting
This is a great chance for the tories to massively cut the size of the NHS. They always wanted to do it. They just couldn't manufacture an excuse.
If the doctor hadn’t previously had covid, would he agree to vaccination? He’s exposed some flaws in the vaccination program which is important, but would his own decision on being vaccinated be different if didn’t already have antibodies
Setting up stage for antichrist to come
Makes me sick how front line staff gets treated, poor nurses was too scared to speak up, this doctor who had the courage to voice his opinion and speaking facts, Bravo to him, during the hard times we had a few years ago when Covid was at its peak, the government needs to remember these where and are the hero’s that saved countless lives while putting them selfs at risk.
Considerations for these vaccinations should be case by case, not everyone will react well to them but for many it might save their life. Make a measured judgment and decide for yourself.   I’m not an anti vaxxer but they are and should be a choice. These are relatively untested, we don’t know the future ramifications and health implications of these vaccines. We are already hearing some severe cases (always to be expected). I am double vaccinated and boosted but if they’d offered me AstraZeneca instead of what I got, I wouldn’t be vaccinated at all.
Good for him to speak up about it
Only white middle aged people why ? Are they trying to find a purpose ? Do they have nothing better to do?
Maybe they should include some kind of basic understanding of statistics in order to become a doctor or nurse.
Reliance on Science, No jab means No job. Glad the NHS staff have more sense, than to follow Mushrooms that put experts before sense
There is no freedom. BBC are so scared to get wrong type of comments that they switched comments off :) I support doctor's opinion and NHS should not be forced to get jabbed.
finally
LIARS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IN GOVERNMENT AND THEY HAVE ZERO INTREST IN ANY OF US ITS ALL ABOUT THEM GETTING RICHER. 💯🎯  PROVE ME WRONG ......
Corrupt politicians are the virus.
And so the vaccine mandate was scrapped! This aged well
Saying to a Doctor we take advice from experts, that made my day. Trying to mug off ordinary members of the public maybe but a doctor!!! 🤦‍♂️
I thought the main point of the vaccine is to lower the chance of hospitalisation
Dear people, what can I do and how to stop this horror. My 11-year-old daughter wants to get vaccinated, her father persuades her, society forces her, and she almost died of anaphylactic shock because she is allergic to some medications. What a world this is! I no longer see the meaning of life.
It's just so ridiculous to even suggest this. Clap for the NHS staff one minute and pretend to care about them...the next minute leave them without a job. Absolutely ridiculous and disgusting behaviour.
Nonsense. Yea antibodies vein because the body smartly does not keep them when they are unnecessary. But there is something else they don't mention. There is memory in T-cell which produces antibodies when it is required again without the need for a so-called booster. Data shows that natural immunity is the best and sufficient.  But this part of science is not profiting big pharma mafia and world health care business organization so it is just my opinion (and many experts also)
Amen <3
My hero
This is the guy that embarrassed the Health Sec enough that they had to backtrack, lol.
Health sec   is  got DESTROY ED
Who is right now
Ahhhh a failed Banker doing what he does best... Fail
I got vacation  after emails from HR last week . I didn't want to do it, but I am afraid to loose a job.. I like to work in NHS , I even got no longer face to face contact with patients.  I am really upset... we have to and we do respect patients choices but because I am NHS worker my body doesn't belong to me..
What a legend 😁
Dr Steve James for Health Secretary !
This man has balls of steel, so much respect towards him for speaking his mind and dropping straight truth bombs. On tops of this, the health secretary tried putting social pressure on him like a coward and failed miserably.
Owned!!!! Respect Doctor 💖!!!
Glad that doctor saved the nurses.. they had no idea. He recognised that - good for him
Scummy Javid wishes he never went into that hospital....those ladies were not ballsy enough and this Dr slapped him down....well done that man
totally inept imbeciles all of them, not all heros wear capes well done sir
Sack em
Sajid Javid is a question dodging goblin
Sajeed: let me get back to my employers the drug companies....
"The science isn't strong enough" ??????? He puts people to sleep.......he is NOT an expert in immunology.......his opinion is counter-productive and plain wrong.......maybe he wants the attention and seen to "be special". He's an idiot and putting his patients lives in danger - I wouldn't want him putting me to sleep.
Sack the Doctor, plain and simple.
Can I just say that we must recognise that we simply cannot categorise members of society into two tiers of vaccinated and "anti-vaxxers". Division is the very last thing we need in the current situation. Please understand that not every person not wanting to be vaccinated is against anyone that wants and has been vaccinated and we should really respect everyone's decision and refrain from categorising, classing and degrading anyone due to their own personal views on vaccinations and every aspect of life!  I am genuinely stunned that given the current situation of healthcare systems around the world, anyone would consider forcibly dismissing healthcare staff for ANY reason!
The guy forcing the vac is an IDIOT
This is one person there are thousands
All that proves is that doctors can be assholes too.
Science is science. Science need no debate but proofs.
Tell em Doc.👍🏾
What's that politicians name....doesnt matter...Every politician should be jailed for Crime against Humanity...
Good man....That politician belongs in jail...
this guy is a ledgand
I think that they cannot force anyone to have a vaccine.
What a hero! He got the balls to talk up
I would've like the minister to confront his views much stronger.
Thats exactly why I won't have the booster, no point if I'm gonna have to keep topping it up.
Hero!  Informed consent will always be important, wise and just....this Doc is on the right side of history.
Well said doc, I’m not getting a jab either. As that twats destroying London.
the doctor is only thinking of himself (that his antibodies will keep him protected) but he doesnt think of the people he interacts with😏
"That's your opinion " speaking to an NHS consultant! Christ just accept its over and let us get back to normal.
Vaccine experts ha ha that’s hilarious 😂
He has guts savage
Commenting for better better reach 🧿
There is this thing where governments and individuals ignore that Delta let alone Omicron spreads well enough among the vaccinated to be problematic and not consistent with their narratives.  The epidemiological relevance of the COVID-19-vaccinated population is increasing - The Lancet Regional Health – Europe And COVID-19: stigmatising the unvaccinated is not justified - The Lancet  There are problems with the official narrative.  COVID vaccines cut the risk of transmitting Delta, some — but not for long - at three months some are on par with being unvaccinated. "Unfortunately, the vaccine’s beneficial effect on Delta transmission waned to almost negligible levels over time. In people infected 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, both in the UK, the chance that an unvaccinated close contact would test positive was 57%, but 3 months later, that chance rose to 67%. The latter figure is on par with the likelihood that an unvaccinated person will spread the virus." Nature.  "Increases in COVID-19 are unrelated to levels of vaccination across 68 countries and 2947 counties in the United States" European Journal of Epidemiology  Links:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481107/  https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00258-1/fulltext  https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02243-1/fulltext  https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2106757  https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2  Interesting...
doctors like others may be fine but they can transmit or become varus carrier to another patient. Doctors don't like vaccine should take extrea precautions and informed patients they are un vaccinated by choice
Wouldn’t listen because there’s no money in natural immunity
If his job as a pharmaceutical salesman doesn't work out, he can always go back to loan sharking. Little runt.
Having "naural" antibodies is not equivalent to a jab - it is definately better to have antibodies from transmission. One of the latest CDC MMWR says about the latest scientific research about that.
From people that are vaccine experts 🤣🤣
This (health secretary) idiot want to get an advice from the vaccine experts ( producers) 🤦🏻‍♂️😂😂😂.
Great doctor!
What a hero
Palmed him off instantly. What a douche.
Fair play dr, more people should just speak out don’t be scared. I’m with the NHS not some self serving politician
Nobody’s asking the obvious questions to the doctor here.   If the vaccine’s protection disappears so fast why is it that the overwhelming majority of the hospitalised and nearly all the dead are unvaccinated? Only 10% of the UK population are unvaccinated and 18% less than double jabbed. The maths doesn’t work here.   Why is getting a vaccination too much of an inconvenience but wearing a mask all the time isn’t?   If the added protection afforded by a mask is worth it then why not the added protection afforded by the vaccine? Why doesn’t he feel the need to maximise the safety of the vulnerable patients in his care? Does he really think he can evidence the idea that the effort/reward ratio is sufficiently poor that expecting staff to vaccinate is unreasonable?  Given how extremely safe the vaccine is why would he resist having it, even if it really was just for the sake of appearance or to please his employer?  The Saj really dropped the ball on this one. If he’d been competently on top of his brief he could’ve shot this doctor down so hard…
My family GP, died yesterday, he had covid earlier in the pandemic and survived it, he too thought he had antibodies and refuse the vaccine… he died in hospital yesterday after battling with a reinfection for over a month. If that is what this doctor wants, well… let him go to heaven then, if he doesn’t trust the science of his own field…
Probably going to get a lot of backlash for this, but what this doctor has done is extremely dangerous. Even if he has a point about transmissibility, the number of people he has influenced to not get vaccinated, even just in these comments, is worrying. I am a nurse who has cared for covid patients in hospital since the beginning, I couldn't be more thankful for the vaccine. What me and my colleagues went through the last 2 years was hell, the suffering we witnessed. The vaccine works, this wave is completely different and symptoms are now mostly mild for vaccinated people. Granted, we still have unvaccinated, young and normally healthy people in ITU.  I dread to think about the influx of unvaccinated people I'll be caring for because of this doctor.
Very well spoken doctor. Made very good points.
Javid didn't know what to say, lol.
This doctor has convinced me to not get the booster after having Covid. He’s just speaking facts!
This guy is the face of common sense.
No way should these people loose their jobs. Me and my husband have had all three. Two weeks after the booster, he has covid for the second time and we’ve been super careful.
The media crucifies anyone who speaks out 😵
💯💉3
Hahaha mugged off
It's impressive how this politician body expression just screamed '' I don't want your honest and the factual truth''. As much as we want unfortunately the vaccines and boosters we have are not that effective, so lets invest more in more effective vaccines research and not just sell the left almost useless type of vaccine that was developed to the 1st Variant.
Lose more doctors/ staff from a struggling service which is in middle of staffing crisis good logic there. It should be a choice and not mandatory.
Not every hero wears a cape but this one wears a mask! Respect!
God blesss him : )
I heard a perfectly valid and rational argument. With no valid or rational counterpoints
Clean blood over here 👋
I'm afraid this is not courage, it's totally selfish to refuse to have full protection when dealing with sick patients. It's no different to a surgeon refusing to scrub up or wear a mask during an op. It amazes me that so many people can't understand that getting the vaccine is not just about that individual, it's about other people.
Fair play to this doctor for standing up for freedom of scientific thought while these moronic  politicians want to sack thousands of key NHS workers.
Well done to this doctor🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
Vaccine experts 🤔
“Thats your view” and now let me move on because thats not the view I want 😂
I’m very supporting him!! Brave!! Liberty
90%? Wonder if that’s after half their staff had to leave.
Slap head needs to listen to hair experts before he starts debating with those with hair
Great!
This isn't the only case. Many providers are opting out of the shot. It makes sense. Not enough data to put yourself at risk. Low to no benefits from the shot.
God will dish out justice and I hope HE does it soon to these sick devil agents
I would not want myself and my beloved ones to be treated by staff who are not vaccinated.
Straight in the face, boom just like it should be.
“We take our advice from the people who are vaccine experts!?!?”  WHAT A COLOSSAL JOKE!  Here in the USA our so-called “vaccine experts” are FAUCI & BILL GATES!  We know what’s going on.  This Health Secretary thinks we’re all stupid?  Who is this joker?
This Health secretary has got nothing. Just spews out the same old lines and propaganda with no evidence or common sense
It’s all about me me me me me!!
UK government is a scandal after  scandal....we can't keep up.Yet they assert: " We Take professional advice".    (And Not follow it....booze Party at 10 downing Street......whilst these doctors took care of the I'll people)
If health professionals aren't taking this vaccine. Then that say's something. I agree with the doctor
This doctor runs a private breathlessness clinic. It is to the benefit of his personal wealth to have unvaccinated people. Fact checking is vital.
The frigg’n face diaper CULT. 🤣😖
Bye bye lol
Health secretary can only deflect, isn’t it sad to see the person in charge not be able to have a conversation.
Doesn't having a vaccine reduce symptoms of covid? Therefore vaccinated doctors are more likely to be carrying covid having no idea and therefore increasing the likelihood of passing it onto an elderly patient..?
Javid is like a Lemming, off to the cliff we go! I wonder how many Pfizer shares he's been given? All advisers and Mps/govt ministers need their bank balances scrutinized. Just how did the 10 richest men in the world double their wealth since Jan 2020? Where has the £3.4 billion pounds paid to fraudulent Covid suppliers gone? Who's investigating?
A DOC that's scared For the hand go firgure
👍
Love when he says at the end: let’s talk to the vaccine experts. We all need to recognise our level of ignorance with humility.
Immunity from natural infection wanes too,in terms of antibody level. Elderly people will die upon first exposure. Not everyone will survive without vaccines. So better to get a vaccine and then get infected with a less deadly variant. Because we'll all get infected eventually. The brightside is that our body will still remember how to fight covid bcos we do have memory t cells. It's just that thr antibody levels diminish after the infections.

''The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.'' - George Orwell
Looks like home secretary has part time job with covid Jab manufacturers. Proper marketing , well done government. Let's sign whole parliament for boosters as they recommend.. Stop just taking , shows us principle.
I have been vaccinated but I agree and support the dr in all that he said.
This shows we're not actually in the authoritative state many people claim we are. A public sector worker can publicly oppose the Health Minister, and it is broadcast by National News
Wow a politician blindly waves off an actual medical opinion. Surprise!
Brave man.
The doctor is WAY underselling it.  Seems to be half brainwashed and half awake.
He will be sacked then. His choice.
"We're getting out information and advise from the people who are vaccine experts" seems to be everyone's response when they don't have an answer, tired of not having answers
Standing behind our NHS staff who are qualified doctors and nurses This bloke is an arrogant disrespectful politician who himself knows nothing about medicine, was incapable of discussing the subject but just shutting him up
Well done for Speak up , very brave and I agree in everything what he said …
In june had 1 jab, then caught corona about 3 weeks later. Can anybody please tell me why I would need to go for a 2nd jab? Its not going to prevent something I have already had is it? Im not going to get any better immunity than actually having the disease.
mmm the main DR has a Crappy masj n yet al the background jobs worths have N95 masks.  Health Secratary had no comeback or could not offer a sensible solution.   If the NHS collapses on April Fools day 1/4/2022 when the DRs and Nurses and support staff leave, understand its the Politicians who have mandated the collapse.     These key people we were banging pots as the NHS heros back March / April 2020, they worked there while Matt Wancough was Shagging his secratary and buying at absorbatent prices expired PPE forour heros.
There should be an crowd fundation for people who get fired because of telling truth like this doctor, maybe then would be more courage in society and more person like him.
When health professionals won't take it why should we??.
Natural immunity has been proven time n time again to have superior protection, it doesnt disappear. Immunity is generally life long when it comes to naturally acquired immunity. Its the artificially acquired that requires boosters. Remember; a client cured is a customer lost….
This doctor is a narcissist. He seems to think he is a virologist, he is not. He seems to think that he knows more than the WHO and more than the leading experts and scientists in the world. It is laughable. There is a culture in the NHS hospitals where doctors like this chap get away with bullying and creating toxic environments. Nobody is allowed to question them in the hospital and they develop God complexes. These are the types of doctors that are so arrogant that they end up killing people with stupid mistakes . Doctors like him , have been responsible for the death of many people. He doesn’t have the expertise to talk on this subject. Im glad that Sajid Javid explained that they take advice from people that are “vaccine experts”. I can’t believe this doctor is selfish enough to regurgitate this rubbish, to encourage people not to get vaccinated. Simply because he seems to think he is immune … the arrogance!
No more claps for  NHS?
Give people no choice and ask them what they think about it?  Sounds like bad joke mr.  When he says  vaccine experts does he means vaccine manufacturers? That's not even funny...
Well done Dr
Sure do respect and appreciate your courage to stand up against this gov't tyranny !!
See Now..  The vaccine HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED.  It never was.  And only the Phizer is approved by FDA for emergency use.  Still under review.  "Sorry mates we told ya they were experimental".  I can hear it coming...
Clever man!
AMAZING DOCTOR.. WELL SAID.. those who dont want this EXPERIMENTAL MONEY MAKING TEST...
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I really appreciate the doctor stand on vaccination and the extra booster shot.
Cant bully people who arent scared that simple.
This doctor drstroyed that loser
Why the panic over mild Omicron??? And why the complacency over a jab that has not passed animal testing and won't be licensed for safe use (not emergency use) until late 2023. Any why is our news media so busy keeping quiet about that?
Stripping people of their human right this is Britian
Dr.  "The science is not strong enough"  Health secretary (crickets churping)   ... Enough said
Great doctor. Speaks his mind based on his knowledge, not extras feom pharma.
Utterly appalling that a doctor could be obtuse.  The vaccine has proven over multiple studies to be far more effective at protective yourself, and other people from future re-infection, hospitalisations and deaths from Covid.
Absolute legend
Sajid Javid yet another native english man ( lol )  in charge this time Secretary of sudden death aka Health Secretary exposes his stupidity ,  where is M. softcock?  where is Bojo and the booze...
stunning and brave.
We need more Dr. Like Dr. Steve James. Voice of the people.
What do javed know about medical cannot even manage finance stupid idiot
There is no such thing as a view in science
It is better to boost our immunity by using health supplements.  We have such wonderful proven products.
Advices from vaccine experts? He's mean vaccine producers?
"we take the very best advice given to us" oh really, by envelope pushers in big pharma? Get fucked...
I’m so glad someone stood up to this goblin 💪 #NHS100k #holdtheline #westandwithyou
Here is a great sit down interview with the doctor who spoke up here.  His name is Dr Steve James.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ik6cxFBbBw
Excellent well done to the Dr - who - said it exactly right.100% So well said we need more Drs..as he says..the Gov will not do it and he has already got immunity ..so why on earth would he have the the jab -Fantastic comments here as well   I am so glad that there is a person who raised his voice and said his opinion in front of camera towards to someone with power.
oh look, he literally contradicts himself. Enjoy, sycophants. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh2vWO58sj4
God bless those with the courage to speak up!
Well done to that doctor for standing up to him, everyone is slowing waking up to this scamdemic
Well done dr James !!!!!!
Keep on speaking your truth dr James and protect the nhs staff with their freedom and jobs
"Vaccine experts" i think he meant "Pfizer experts" :)
The doctor is lying.  The effectiveness of the vaccines start to wane after around 6 months, not 6 weeks.  His argument of catching the virus and gaining immunity is dangerous and incredibly negligent.  Wtf....
I guess that a small percentage of people choosing not to vaccinate will be helpful as a control group in order to contrast the efficacy and longevity of the various vaccinations, very courageous of them.  I hope they dont pass on the disease to patients who are more likely to be susceptible to covid though....
Around 95% of NHS staff have vaccinated vs 5% including this doctor who hasn't.  Its a pity that SKY chose to air an interview with an expert in anesthesiology and not an epidemiologist (an expert on disease spread) or an immunologist (an expert on the immune system).   Regarding how long protection of the vaccines last (longevity) the doctor is factually mistaken. The levels of effectiveness start to wane after 6 MONTHS, not 6 weeks (Im guessing the good doctor was tired out and under pressure).
The science is strong enough. He just doesn't want to believe it. He's an anesthesiologist. Not an immunologist and it shows. He should stick to what he knows
Health Secretary to a DOCTOR: We will take best advice from people who are vaccine experts. Doctor: ...  So who are vaccine experts? Bankers?
”Vaccine Experts” ?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well done!right choice !
He knows better
Vaccine experts hahahha, I’d rather listen to a biologist.
Great respect for Dr!! ♥️I’m of the same opinion!☺️
BRAVO Doctor!<3
This doc is a hero.
Bravo for this Doc. They didn't expect this answer on front of camera at all. I'm surprised that this video is still available on YouTube.
We have to understand that he isn’t talking about the general population. He’s talking about medical staff. He and other medical staff working with Covid patients have developed an immunity already from their exposure to the virus so therefore do not need the vaccine. Yes there isn’t as much evidence behind it but then again, we don’t usually wait for years of scientific testing when there is a pandemic going on. I understand both sides of the argument and I wouldn’t judge anyone for taking or not taking the vaccine. But I don’t agree with what the health minister is trying to do. The health workers have given too much and done so much. He needs to have some respect for them.
Well done to this doctor 🎉🎉
When people speak from their heart, it is easier to understand.
Feel sorry for these people
Vaccin experts? Who is that?
A common sight in British politics, a representative of the people squirming after been caught lying on camera. Ahhhhh so proud to elect these idiots. (That’s sarcasm) (British for “I know they are morons they don’t represent the public”)
‘We listen to the vaccine experts’ the people making the vaccine ching ching
Is there only one doctor in UK who think logically and is not afraid to tell the truth?! Wake up people if not too late!
Well done Dr Steve James for telling the truth 👍
That doctor is not a vaccine expert end off.
The world is becoming fascist again.. ffsake
No way on earth am I letting the government jab me
BRAWO doctor !!!!!!
I support Dr James.👏
There goes a true hero
That decision will ruin that country health system and that politics will be RESPONSIBLE for many people death as will be not enough staff in hospitals what's is happening already ... What they doing with us ???? How can we be so helpless and stupid ? !
I am sure the nurses appreciate the doctor standing up for the staff, gives them a deeper appreciation for people like that.
He does not respect the view he is disgraced,  bullshit man comes to save thee truth
Well done brave doctor...
Bravo for Doctor 👍
i havent had 1 jab yet and their already starting to mandate boosters.. i’ll have alot of shots to catch up on! .. imagine having to get injected every 3 or 6months for the rest of your life, just to keep your job.
A bloody hero !!! Professional vaccine seller (economic studies include marketing)  vs unprofessional staff(wht on earth doc knows abt health care?!). My God save the NH Mess and have mercy on us all.
"Vaccine experts"  translation:  Pfizer, Moderna,  Johnson & Johnson
These directions and mandates are served to us under the guise "science" when really it is an opinion. A political opinion from politicians no less. What are their motives, agenda and who is set to gain? Answer those simple questions and it does not take long to figure out that this is big money (even) for the 1%
Vaccine experts? 😂😂😂 who cares about some doctor's opinion
Anyone know if this guy's still alive??
the bureaucratic arrogance. The doctor on site says his opinion but the bureaucrat is going to consult with the vaccine experts ... that are going to do what? Run some computer simulations that will put out erroneous results yet again ? And speaking of journalistic integrity "his 'natural immunity' after contracting coronavirus was far superior to any booster." Where does the doctor say far superior? He literally says "probably equivalent". And in the article's intro paragraph he is reffered casually dismisive as " an unvaccinated hospital consultant". Damn the facts if controversy generates views I guess.
Just to be clear, anesthesiologists are not virologists, and there appear to be quite a number of quack anesthesiologists.
Alright, get rid of him, easy done. Just watch carefully so he doesn't become a social commentator with Sky News.
Yes!!!!
When someone who knows COVID meets someone who tells them they know someone who knows COVID.
He's literally telling a Doctor who works in a covid ward that "we are listening to the experts"   I genuinely don't know anymore....
In China he would be dead ☠️
He is ABSOLUTELY right
Stand for nothing kneel for anythiny.
Great respect for that doctor speaking up in the right moment !  heres a link for an interview with him after that video: https://youtu.be/4Ik6cxFBbBw
Good on the doctor for saying that. If the government has secret data they're not showing us then this maybe part of the problem!
Too funny he's a bam lol
This is brilliant
ITS OVERRRRRRRRR
NHS dentist here who will no longer be an NHS dentist if the mandate goes ahead. Respect to this doctor!
Sajid Javid is our health minister and he can't even provide any argument back. He's so far down the vaccine obsession rabbit hole that truth and reason need no longer apply anymore.
Remember that sky news promoted experimental vaccination as well, when it comes to hanging for crimes against the humanity.

There’s other views… of course there’s facts and evidence and science tho so other views are from lies and misinformation so. Common sense should play a part somewhere still there’s people lining up for 3rd 4th..ect it goes to show how brainwashed people are
Thumbs up!!!! 👍🏼👍🏼
Favourite video, ever!
Put that doctor in the covid ward so he can take care of the unvaccinated people like himself, I’m sure he’ll enjoy it
Brave doctor and very ntelligent
Great point!
"... from the vaccine experts" lol Good one m8
The doctor saying the vaccine can offer protection if I take it monthly......but I'm not going to do that
"we will take advise... from people who are vaccine experts" oh yeah that will end great
I'd like to hear more from the doctor and his mate regarding his natural immunity and what he did to overcome the initial infection in the early stages.
Where was this doctor until now?? Suddenly he appears, standing near Sajid Javid in the hospital while the other talks to the nurses, looking like an actor, a short time before they ease the restrictions in England. He might be a controlled opposition.
✊
Based
Full respect to this doctor I hope he is still working and standing for his rights
Really appreciate and respect this doctor for his courage to speak up. If more people do this the decision makers will need to listen.
“We take advice from the experts”  What like bill gates?
Why would sky news release this footage
Javid to his secretary: “Find out who that man was and ‘handle it’!” Secretary/handler: “It’s difficult to find him, he was wearing a mask!”
What a hypocrite! what he meant to say was that they only take advise from vaccine expersts that promote a particular view. And clearly thats not how science works. Kudos to the Dr for standing up for medical ethics of bodily autonomy and informed consent 👏
This doctor is very brave. Wishing him well.
Javid is a government puppet, he's got Boris's hand so far up his backside. I really hope this puppet doesn't run for PM, he's just a business man trying to force his own opinion. The man needs to sit down and let someone intellectual to take the reigns, someone who looks at actual research papers, statistics and uses their common sense.
The unvaccinated are dangerous to public health and should be excluded from society for as long as this virus is a threat.
Well done for being brave to say it.
april 1st apparantly is the date when internationally, hospital staff will lose their jobs. People who still think that this isn't directed aren't paying attention.
Hero
ORWELL'S 1984: READ IT
The vaccine experts is what he said to listen too.  The CDC and fauci are the experts and the lie about everything.  Change their minds weekly.  Joke
If we don’t need masks anymore why would they need to get jabbed 😂 although it’s clear that’s just Boris trying to get the attention off of his Downing Street raves
Says someone not practicing bare below elbows.
“We have to weigh the social care”  … and there it is folks!!!! A politician finally speaks the truth, this has nothing to do with protecting public health.
Good for him for speaking up and calling it out.
Respect to this doctor. History will judge him well. It is not easy to speak up right now.
The jab lowers your T cell count making your immune system weaker….
I have a lot of respect for this doctor !!
Two months moderate protection is surely better than none, no?
So has he been buried yet or cloned?
This intensive care doctor is working with the sickest patients in society. The vaccine would have prevented him from passing on covid to these patients. Even if this effect reduces after 8-12 weeks - that's still 8-12 weeks of him being less likely to pass on covid to the most critically ill patients in society. Given how safe the vaccine is I feel he ought to have had it
🌹🌼🍀
Googlebot censoring YT comments automatically wow....
We take advice on that translates as we pay the people to tell us what we want to hear so we can enforce bogus laws preventing family's from seeing once another while we sneak booze in down street for parties
That's a real man. Women, take notes
Max was here.
Even when he explains his "intelligent personal" position ... they do not understand the logic, but get VERY defensive ...
So Sajid defo is illiterate shutting the doc down what an idiot ! Lol at his at some point …. Sajid go read some common sense !!!!
Most There scared to speak out. Why are they so determined to give everyone a fix 💉 ridiculous that should ring alarm bells
⭐ HERO⭐ and health minister is a ssssssssnake🐍
"From the people who are vaccine experts" The vaccine experts are saying the exact same thing!
So honest!
Aaaaaaaand I hope he’s never my doctor
Buddy didn't have a educated medical response lol.
Regarding the description, why does it say the doctor stated that his "'natural immunity' after contracting coronavirus was far superior to any booster".  I don't recall him making that claim.
well said, doctor. its not about what is one and only solution for everyone. but how one can protect themselves and the others around. most people are unfamiliar/denial with healthcare and its practises, hence vaccination are adviced. sadly, politics makes it such that it is mandatory, because it makes their job easier, for better or for worse.
If u are like : take vacin then u are " Expert" If u like : i am not for it.. " it is ur opinion"
I want to marry this guy
Well done to the doctor 👏
Thank God
great
Strong courageous man!!!!
Guy's I too am being harassed by the NHS management for not being jabbed. I need to know can we not challenge this issue in the court. Can we all together do it. I am really frustrated
All doctors and health officials come forward with the truth! This is madness and is a fight for control not for public safety! Madness..
Good
I was forced to get a vaccination as a student nurse. Otherwise, they will kick me out of the program.  I did not had the choice, . The government forces most health care staff to the get vaccination. Even though staff members wear PPE( protective equipment ) and wash hands every 5 min. It's over for humanity.
Doctor doesn't know what he's talking about, getting Covid-19 does not produce nearly the same number of Neutralising Antibodies than two doses of vaccinations. Protection after transmission is a myth with Omicron, his alternative is to keep catching Covid 🤦🏻‍♂️
BIG FAT B.LL..KS TO THE GOVERMENT
My mum will be losing her job in the NHS soon as she hasn't had the vaccine, she already had the virus last year so should have the antibodies, and it should be her own choice to protect her own body, if the vulnerable patients are jabbed then the patients are protected from covid, are they not? Feel sorry for my poor mum who has worked hard her entire life, just to have it taken away from her for exercising her right not to have a needle in her arm. If this madness doesn't stop soon, this country is going to become a much more dangerous place when people need new ways of making money to survive
Getting vaccinated against viruses like covid is a really good idea. This is true for the original variant and delta.  However things have changed with Omicron, the vaccine that’s offered whilst it does offer additional protection isn’t really designed for this many genome variations, I still got boosted as I had plans to see my elderly grandparents at Xmas. If I wasn’t going to do that then no way.   Best to wait for redesigned vaccine. I personally won’t take this until late this year.
Doctors are speaking up. The mandates are based on old data.
"We take advice from the people who are the experts" (yes, expert politicians😂)
This dr is around the most vunerable people.  The unvaxxed carry a heavier viral load for longer than the vaxxed. He owes it to his patients to get vaxxed so he does not pass the infection on. If he doesn't then this selfish man needs to be fired.
The Doctor is 100% correct
I salute this doctor, single man who stood up ✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
A set up
Finally someone showed him how dumb the politicians are. * Dictators
Remember, remember the 5th of November…
Give that doctor a bloody medal
Yes and here we are, a doctor who has a career in medicine, dedicated his life to medicine, studied his profession for years to get where most of us can not, in order to care for us.. being told it's just your opinion. Welcome to arrogance, take note
Health Secretary is living in an illusion.  Needs to be dropped in a forest for a couple of years living off the land to remind himself of who we are.   The human race can't go on getting vaccinations and booster vaccinations.    Self immunity is key.
[  Meditation leads to awareness of telepathy, and awareness of telepathy leads to meditation.  ]  Honesty socially is much more important than DOING to impress others. It’s not what we DO to build social value that matters. It’s the respect we are willing to give, as well as the authenticity and sincerity we have within our personalities. The ideas we choose to participate in matter most: they are either friendly or cruel socially. There is no material wealth or DOING in society that creates authority by default, which is the ability to pass judgments socially the most. The minds participating in that idea are hypocritical, cowardly, and dumb. Anger and zero accountability are not replacements for honesty and empathy.  Authoritarianism is a head game men play when they refuse to share honesty (friendship). Classist men are completely biased against ideas supporting emotional freedom, free thinking, and level states of being. Spiritual development, the focus away from the material and towards psychology and attraction only, is promoted as “not important” by the fearful seeking emotional leverage socially. Spiritual ideas immediately decentralize power, elevate mood, reduce manipulation, and eliminate leadership. Spirituality places much more emphasis on social inclusion, honesty (friendship), and collective consciousness. Authoritarians weaponize materialistic development and use it as a basis to remain unfriendly (dishonest) and critical. Dishonesty is the only way the idea of “power” may exist. When friendship is seen as much more important than power, material development is subservient to mood. When material development is used to boost self worth and reduce others socially, mood is subordinate to power.  Joyful ideas supporting free thinking (telepathy, cooperation, and honesty) encourage growth of the human persona, are anti-manipulative, and remove the idea of “power” from the human mind. Men focused on the immaterial (personality) and on honesty (friendship) are more developed socially than domineering men consumed with leadership. Authoritarians intentionally remain closed-minded, antagonistic (blame), and manipulative (controlling), while also forming intense judgments (jealousy) about more emotionally developed men, in order to seek status. Men with evolved personas possess honesty and humor within the mind, and never extend the idea of emotional leverage to anyone. This makes them an unintentional threat to critical men focused on social dominance. Leadership is not warm, nor is it real. It is used in practice to reduce pride in others and to artificially boost feelings of self worth in an individual focused on social image only. Men focused on telepathy are contradictory socially to authoritarians that promote leadership. Men with inherent worth (love for others) are offensive to men trying to prove worth (lack of belief in self) with material development.  All men know consciousness (Source) and possess a conscience. Possessing a conscience is knowing right from wrong. No man is exempt from understanding Source (love) within, and all men know what a conscience is. Comparing the human being to an unaware animal is cunning and manipulative. Alphas rely on lying socially about awareness instead of developing character, while ignoring Source (love) completely. Our feelings (thoughts and beliefs) are transmitted vibrationally to the minds of other people. In order to seek power, which is the intention to emotionally reduce other human beings, status seekers must feign unawareness of knowing a conscience. Cruel ideas are deliberately participated in and broadcast mentally promoting social dominance. The willful focus on an honest (friendly) collective consciousness is a contrarian idea to human animals playing dumb. Being EQUAL TO in the mind socially IS secure, and the ONLY true expression of emotional security that exists. Authoritarians refuse to focus away from being unfair human animals and towards emotional harmony, and remain consumed with social inequality only. This forces an unrelaxed, emotionally tense environment driven by melodrama and contempt for others.   Alphas have low feelings of self worth, mental instability, manipulative personalities, and severe emotional issues resulting from the intense focus on both apathy (unfriendliness) and advantages (social exclusivity). Ideas rooted in social dominance (alpha psychology) will never promote honesty (friendship) in society. Dishonesty leads to an emotional schism (depression) socially. Alphas are homophobic and seek more control over feelings, and focus on blame and paranoia socially to maintain a false sense of emotional security. These vibrational attacks lead to violence. Control over feelings is impossible, as we all share thinking. Alphas are combative because they are deeply insecure about the emotional intelligence in other men. When men possess emotional IQ, it means they care about other people, have level minds socially, and think very highly of other human beings in general. We are all telepathic. There is no choice but to be honest (friendly), and to focus on the ultimate truth of what reality is (connection with Source). Men with evolved personas refuse to manipulate the truth and to seek power over others. Seeking status means to be endlessly critical, materialistic, and cruel socially. Men with emotional depth focus on honesty (friendship) more than alphas, and this is why they are non-violent.  The idea of a social hierarchy (human authority) is degrading and humiliating. It promotes closed-mindedness, fear, and the social inclusion of violence. Non-conformist men focused on telepathy, possessing elevated emotions, are judged relentlessly by alphas that refuse to evolve. Violent men intentionally share the same judgments about more emotionally complex men out of spite, keeping a false sense of security. Alphas seek validation and support from each other, since the ideas they participate in are rooted in dishonor and hate. Alphas judge friendly, emotionally developed men the most because they possess more honesty, more self control, and have the courage to show love (truth) to conformity. Passing excessive, unprovoked judgments (authoritarianism) on a better psychology, wavelength, and state of being is jealousy. These judgments always relate to honesty, social harmony, and non-violence. Violent men rely on power of numbers to keep ideas going that are manipulative and threatening towards men that have already focused away from machismo (lying and fear), and towards telepathy, honesty, and Source. Men that refuse to evolve into non-violence and remain focused on alpha will stay domineering and controlling socially, and will always promote vibrational attacks against more emotionally developed men. The results of this psychology are petty head games and constant manipulation of the truth.  Intelligence is always associated with emotional IQ, and emotional IQ has a direct correlation to the mental focus on social equality. Social equality can only result from honesty (friendship) within the mind. The reason men chose to be honest socially is always the same: they are aware telepathy is real and they don’t like looking stupid. Alphas primarily focus on dominance and social image, and focus entirely away from emotional depth and connectivity. This reduces their emotional IQ socially. Because of this, alphas will always feel inferior to more honest (friendly) men. Alphas must always focus on acting skills to socialize, since the inner persona is focused only on aggression, violence, and dishonesty. This creates a shallow personality socially with a dumb vibe. Men with violence on the mind will always show jealousy to non-violent men with emotional depth. This is because only non-violent men can form honest outer personas socially that are not shallow, more trustworthy, and more likable. Shallow minds are not highly thought of or respected when it comes to emotional IQ, and are often avoided socially. This angers the minds of men that possess a lower psychology, which will often create a violent reaction socially unprovoked. When thinking in men is focused primarily on honesty, feelings radiate warm / soft. Men that have violence and cruelty within the mind radiate ice cold / threatening feelings.  Machismo and compassion are polar opposites. Machismo will never allow for healing to occur, while compassion is the promotion of both healing and emotional growth. Men focused on compassion will always outwit less mature, manipulative men with arrogant and violent personalities sharing no respect. Men will either allow healing (level thinking) to occur socially, or they will attempt to take away pride from others to artificially boost feelings of self worth. Alphas will always attempt to seek an image of more value socially by cheating (violence, greed, or leadership). Judgements from personalities with machismo usually have little substance. Only judgments relating to character issues (dishonesty), violence, or an excessively critical mind have real substance. Passing judgments on men for being honest (friendly) is shallow, arrogant, and completely against the development of our collective consciousness socially. Judgments from alphas are often hypocritical, cruel, and reside in dishonor. Shallow judgments from authoritarians will always lead to drama, social inequality, and violence. Alphas focus intensely on cutting other men down unfairly in order to promote a better social image, labeling it “competitive”.   It’s time for human beings to end classism (psychic warfare) for good. It is jealousy. Materialistic development and social image will never supplement dishonesty and cruelty. Secure men are level in the mind and easy to get along with. Conniving authoritarians play childish head games and allow stagnation of the personality.   End the drama-  https://youtu.be/hHcIOwgOHqk
If 90% of people smoke tobacco, does it become safe?
Natural immunity is better than a vaccination
As someone’s who has the vaccine. I fully agree with the doctor. If he doesn’t want the vaccine then he shouldn’t have it
Great truth! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXjvCcYpSY0
They just care about selling the vaccines.    I'm not vaccinated.
Can he at least wear his mask properly ffs?! 🙄
Bravoooo
Doctor: 1 Politican: 0
Such a stupid debate
https://youtu.be/pyF_A_Zi8pA
LOL, so they are taking the advice of "experts" but ignoring an ER Dr. that treats Covid patients... Natural immunity is better than being vaxxed. Ignoring that reality is purely political in nature.
Well done to this doctor. We need more people like him!
No real need for a comment, as the confidence in knowledge comes through! Spot on those saying that it's appalling to see a non-medically trained showman telling a doctor (with a fair and very reasonable point) about listening to 'the expert advice'. Absolutely despicable. I do hope people will sober up and we can move on from all this nonsense soon.
Good for him
NO VACCINE
The Dr has got a strong point I agree with his point
I expect that they would fire him that's all
We have to all stand together and stop this madness .
Kings has some of the most amazing people which work for them. Trusted, informed, amazing doctors, nurses and health care staff. Its disgisting how Mr javid snubs him.  Shout out to Kings college. Life savers and legends.
Never trust a banker
Brave doctor, well done for speaking up.
No one is a "vaccine expert" on this vaccine because it is new technology that is being used for the 1st time in a experimental capacity. Maybe they're getting their "experts" from big pharma, or their experts are receiving their education courtesy of big pharma
Why do people still think vaccines are soley for your own benfits? Do they not understand the concept of herd immunity through vaccination?
I agree with the doctor
Doctor should lose his job. Regardless of his opinion on "natural immunity" his decision shows a complete and callous disregard for his patients and colleagues. Disgrace.
Finally a real valid opinion on these gimmicky vaccines
From the people who say what we want them to say
👏👏👏
This what the NHS is really about.
Politicians know more than experts.
“From the vaccine experts” LOL
SHOCKING!!!!😱
Lisen people to this doctor.. smart guy!
Bravo doctor without reciving vaccine..
Ain’t nobody here but as slapheads! Javid and Whitty - the two slapheads of the covidpocalypse!
Puts Scabhead Jabhead in his place
And he is telling people to do it.. funny..
Gross actually gross all of them are vile
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Jeez the doctor taught him
I thought that was Ali abdaal
Dr James has about-turned on this issue because he’ll know he’ll be out of a job in the NHS. I truly believe he deliberately pulled this stunt to advertise his own private, ‘alternative health’ and/or quack healthcare services which he is also getting money for. Nice move and it also shows that the Anti-Vaxx movement also stands to gain revenue from COVID
Respect to that Dr!
So they’re just gonna keep jabbing people over and over again expecting different results. Isn’t that the definition of insanity??
Yay for the doctor standing for what he believes. Knowledge is power; Ignorance is not bliss😉
What’s this doctors name ? An amazing fella
Takes advice from “vaccine experts” Trying to sell their vaccine but won’t listen to a doctor in front of his face lol he’s a robot
U can still catch and carry covid with the vaccine and give it to people either way and the vaccine isn’t 100% so at the end of the day what can they do? Ban people from working? It’s a joke people should be able to decide what goes into their body and not pressured I got the first two vaccines but u can forget about the ‘booster’
that stupid interviewer is such a rat. Even though a doctor is telling him a vaccs is not effect because we have our immune system, the interviewer is like, oh, ill take advice from a vaccine expert. Fool. Im glad the doctor told the truth.
I consider our government to be both immoral and hypocritical, often changing the rules to suit their own interests, a government who clapped the NHS in 2020 and who now wants to turn those claps into a “push out the door” to the same NHS staff for all their hard work over the years and at the height of the pandemic while they where wearing their full PPE, whether vaccinated or had immunity from covid from natural infection. I doubt anyone at No 10 ever experienced a shift wearing full PPE or the physical or mental pressure of working in a challenging medical environment.     I was pro-vaccine, but I feel and hope Omicron will over-rule the governments decisions in regards to vaccine mandates. I was triple jabbed by October 2021 with two Astra-Zeneca vaccines in Feb and April 2021 and Pfizer BioNTech booster in October and I still caught covid in January this year. The vaccines may of helped decrease my reaction to coronavirus, but I really wonder now with the emergence of Omicron if my symptoms would of been much different if I hadn’t been vaccinated. I’ve mainly had persistent mild cold virus symptoms, with the worst symptoms being headache, dehydration and chills for 14 hours on day three after contracting Covid.
Look at them other doctors was scared to speak out control by the government
Listen to him (HERO Ignored AGAIN)
This is what courage looks like. We need people like this to voice their opinions without fear.
“From the people who are vaccine exerts” he means people with the money
"That's your opinion"
The silence when he asks the question says just as much as that brave doctor.  Honestly the fact they aired this on mainstream media shocks me.
This Guy is not listening to the truth.  He works on Covid patients everyday.  He has been Covid free for two years.
Who are the vaccine experts 'dear health secretary' ? Is it the ones who sold their souls for money or position? Bravo doctor, I couldn't agree with him more. 💖💓💕
The doctor got half his claims wrong and was citing incorrect conclusions from a study that he didn't understand so not sure why people here are hailing him as a hero. There's a reason 92% of his colleagues have been vaccinated
I love the way he went straight for the nurses to ask for their opinions, knowing fully well they do not have the qualifications nor knowledge to give an intelligent response on the issue. Meanwhile he gives his back to the doctor (seems like a Reg) in charge of the ward. The doctor then speaks up in mic shot so Sajid had to acknowledge him. Also note none of the nurses felt comfortable giving an opinion.
So, Djokovic was kicked out of Australia and got a 3 year ban why exactly?
Don't do it it's pointless
We'll take advice from the "vaccine experts."  Really? Who are the So  called  vaccine experts?.....Gee, could it be The big Pharna companies, maybe, The same ones who is making  billions of dollars on Booster shot  sales....really, Is that what males them experts? Funny man.
This guy is a a Lion, the rest is bullshit. He said the truth and everytone just freezed up.
Nobody cares,the NHS is going to start sacking unvaccinated staff next month
It seems to me the health minister was saying yeah yeah a lot and then finished off saying we are taking advice from vaccines experts. What experts. It’s not a vaccine dumbo
A real good doctor right there! 🙌👍🏻❤️
Does anyone listen to the reality,  fact and science ? The physician is accurate.  He actually has antibodies exceeding the vaccines.
National guidance is based on a farce!  Pay attention to the Doctors that are in the front lines fighting the viruses!
I don't have any medical knowledge of any form but I can spot a reasonable person or a cheeky liar pretty quickly 😉 The guy on the left is guilty ,his whole body language says "I don't want to be here" and he's wearing a white shirt  for only one reason,to whitewash himself,as it's the colour of innocence.
The doctor is correct
Is it the effect of brainwashing on the health secretary? Or is it money speaking ahead of medical reason? Either way it’s a sad indictment on our medical institution as a whole
We NEED to go after each person, doctor or not, recommending the jab!!!
No matter what your beliefs I think we can all agree the comments sections under Sky News videos are retarded
Bravo to this dr.
LOL the charade keeps falling down daily.  We all know where the nurses stand but unfortunately most of the world is run by egomaniacs and tyrants
Don't blame the doctor. Why stick a bunch of temporarily effective jabs every month when CBD extracts have been proven to treat and even inhibit sarscovid2?  Oh that's right, theres no profit to be had from a plant that anyone could grow. No wonder this stuffs still illegal.  All while Bojo invites people to a party at downing Street with some recreational boozing.  Deary me what a joke this is...
Stand your ground even if your voice shakes
Maybe ask him if nobody takes the vaccine, in the hospital where he works, would they have enough beds for people that will need their services? If people starts to don’t get vaccinated, they will potentially go to hospital because of complications, would the hospitals have enough nurses, beds, oxygen tanks, ventilators and doctors to attend the demand??? We already know the truth, which is NO! This “medical doctor” wasn’t clearly in this planet when the pandemic started, when the beds where giving to young people because the old people had a lower chance to make it. Please people don’t forget how everything started and how the vaccines have been helping to contain the virus. What is true is that the governments are relying on the vaccines and not investing in hospitals and resources, that’s a different story and that’s what this “medical doctor” should highlight.
His argument still fails because he's not alleging the vaccine doesn't work, just that it doesn't work for long.  He also might want to recheck his textbooks on how vaccines work, instead of trotting out the 'antibodies' trope...and stop watching Joe Rogan.
Full respect to this honest brave intelligent doctor
I find myself afraid of the backlash of sharing this. I find myself uncomfortable in questioning the authorities who are pushing yet another booster upon me. I find myself concerned about the backlash that considering the information might bring my way.  My gut tells me I have the right to form an opinion without being labelled an idiot or an upstart. I'm going to share this anyway because I think we should always have the right to question authority.
Health minister doesn't know what natural immunity is?
The good Dr. has knowledge from being on the battle field. His experience trumps "well we'll have to see." No the good Dr. has already seen.
Great respect for this doctor 😀  Finally, someone has the courage to tell them that we disagree with vaccines for NHS staff
To what end?
A doctor with courage, in my country the ones that appear on tv are a joke, they sound like politicians.
This would be so easy, it's a requirement of the job.
Bravo!
Well done to this doctor. Finally common sense vs political mambo jumbo.
"experts" more like clowns🤡
The man on da right knows Covid 19 seen it everyday the man on the left learn from Comic book
Oh and it's not actually a vaccine!!!!
"That's your view" - reflexive dismissal. This is not about 'views' - it's about truth, and this doctor is speaking it. This health minister politician is a dangerous scoundrel.
I agree with Mr blue coat how dare Mr politician speak to him like that 😤
I agree with the NHS worker NOT the numpty as let's call him Mr numpty Narrow-minded
This health minister studied Politics & Economics at university. Had a career in banking and politics. Just look at his wiki - he's a sociopath who has spent his life climbing the ladder. He cares about money and power, nothing else.
Give them “ Informed Consent “ then let’s see how that works out 🤪🤣😂 Simple questions makes life saving decisions!!!
He looks like gru from despicable me why should we trust him?
Ive have zero jabs.. I’ve had covid and it was a right laugh, lost my taste for 2 days for 10 days off.. same again please!
The nurses were so scared to speak up fearing to loose their livelihood. Good for that doctor for standing up to These tyrants trying to force their way on us.  Who in their right mind would want to be vaccinated 2-3 times a year
Psychopath 'health minister' puppet fishes for propaganda material from normal people. A doctor gives completely reasonable statement which is dismissed as a 'view'/'debate', and returns to the scared nurses for the 'forced consensus' or agenda/narrative that has been pushed for years. Lying, psychopath, scoundrel.
I really feel like it’s staged ! Sorry
Thats your view 😂 he is a fukin doctor haha.
Old ppl die ..
Covid politics by stupid politicians
Well at list  they showed it.. that’s seems like a freedom of speech! Respect! Other county’s or news Chanel’s would cut this out! Love it!
He has point.
If what this doctor says is true why arent we jabbed regular for mumps measles and rubella or the flu or any of the vaccines we are given from birth for life long protection if what he says is true then we need all of these every month also or is it a different science used for the covid vaccine to the rest
No one should have to take a drug that is brand new in order to keep their livelihood.
"vaccine experts" lol
Where there is risk, there must be choice.  Look up Kyle Warner.
Forcing a new one year old concoction into someone's body is morally wrong.
Typical women just agreeing to everyone instead of standing up for there selves
"Vaccine Experts" ...he means Vaccine Businessman
l bow my head to courage of this doctor to say what many think. He can expect unpleasant things now...   and if that would be true...than we have "democracy" at its best... oh the irony...
wow that bald guy seemed so disrespectful ngl, asked for his opinion then shuts him down for what exactly, ego? I've been triple vaxxed and understand fully where the doctor is coming from as the majority of NHS workers have been dealing with covid etc for some time now and it doesn't take a genius to conclude that they would have built up some immunity. But anyway agree or not with the doctor, respect the mans decision and opinion dont shut him down by saying "we take advice from vaccine experts". what a clown honestly
This atmosphere that he is like a black sheep and its like a "omg he doesnt want to have the vaccine" thing when he just states he doesn't want to be vaccinated . Although the manager seems very civilized , unsually civilized,  this sub fear or sth in the conversation is revealing of the bad situation.
N O  R E F U N D S
So this Nurse is putting his opinion above the safety of those far more vulnerable than himself and risking others because, ‘the science isn’t compelling’.
Such dismissive behavior by a non doctor liberal demanding other follow his lead. The far left is dangerous
Well done to the doctor
Courage, covering and protection from the Lord be upon this frontliners. This is what we need!!! To more bold courageous heart be reveal.
Minister is a clown and that just proved he just got shut down ! That his views !   Someone who spent their life on medical knows more than that clown !   Well done to doctor !
I'd like to hear why he doesn't want it specifically. Is it to do with something being put into his body that only protects for such a short time for example? Or maybe he doesn't believe the vaccines were trialled properly. Would like to know.
Well done that man!
Vaccine experts? No such thing. People were conned. We were told this would end the virus and transmission. A lie
Rabid Javid could not care less about the truth and even less about the NHS staff.
I have taken 4 shots ( 2 sinopharm and 2 phizer) in 2020
People are immune to the virus, these people will be stripped if the immunity and a vaccine will then be made.
Logical and serious!I have the same view
WE don't need injections I'm with this Doctor as well.  Plus it our choice !!!
Get this man some bitches on his lap
"The world suffers a lot. Not because of the violence of bad people, but because of the silence of good people".  (Attributed to Napoleon).
Well said Doc!! Sajid , please stop acting like a puppet in theatre. People x-rayed your plays....
The Government are not following the Science....
He said he understands, but it didn’t seem like he did
Vaccines don’t work.  *Trust the science*
Why is our "heath" minister not a white British man?
Good on him(doctor)!
FIANLLY the truth!!! Unless the vac can achieve 100% protection for a long long time stop asking people to get injection. Who the f knows that’s inside and the long term side effects?
Well done him
The health minister who did NOT study medicine, rudely and arrogantly dismissed a doctor (who studied medicine) by concluding with  "...we take the best advice we can from people who are vaccine experts" as though the dr speaking is an imbecile and doesn't  know what he is talking about. Classy  NOT. I don't  know why people do not see that this is an agenda that is being pushed by governments. The dr is quite correct, the science is not strong enough to mandate that individuals must have a vaccine. This smacks of the thought police in Orwell's '1984' “And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed into history and became truth. ‘Who controls the past’ ran the Party slogan, ‘controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.'”
Fraudci
BRAVO!!! BRAVE!!The truth!!! God bless this DOCTOR and protect him!🙏🙏🙏🙏♥️♥️♥️♥️
We need to jail those who have silenced us for so long. We need to jail these news people.
Pfizer spokesman debates Covid frontline doctor
Good on that doctor. Well done for starting the debate 👏
NO VAX AB MASKS NO STUPID SIENCE
They'd love to do nothing more than monthly boosters. $$$$$$$$$$$
https://youtu.be/u2CUK-Rgdoc
I just loved how the female doctors/nurses were so afraid of speaking their mind.. whatever their opinion was.
I've never had the Vaccine and had Covid right at the start of all this mess, I've never gotten it again after these last 2 years. In my own personal experience, natural anti bodies beat Vaccines.
Well done Doc!! Hold firm!!!
The health care has to obey my boyfriends heart specialist even  told him the truth they still dont know how this virus works .because he had a good viral dr .this is what happened he caught virus because he takes the phnemonia shot the virus left little spikes in blood it protected his lungs but the spikes went to heart valves messed them up he had to get 2 stints .hes great now .just wanted to give facts case this helos .
I support Dr Steve James!!! He should be able to make his thoughts known without being slated. Well done Dr James!!
Excellent
We need to setup a gofundme for people who get fired for vaccine refusals
There is no madical motivation. The motivation is political.
why would anyone listen to a anaesthetist about covid? maybe question a virologist
Being silent😑🐒
Kill baby my body my choice Squeeze some fluid into ur bloodstream goverment choice hehe
My freind has been told she can't have a hip replacement unless she gets vaccinated......
One only quotes what others said, the other articulates what he thinks. .
At some point that doctor shouldn"t be there any more because he is suppossed to convince people to get protection from vaccines but he is not convinced himself.
This Sajid Javid is a complete waste man. Not sure how or why these people get voted into gov, get them all out I say
The last comment ‘from the people who are vaccine experts’ almost seemed like he was trying to belittle the doctor.
Poor Doc got destroyed on Good Morning. Media agenda hey
" the sience isnt strong enough"  Truest thing ive herd all my life
So he didnt seem to answer back to dr hillary on GMTV why didnt he say this on there?? Makes me so angry
How is this news? One doctor doesn’t want it.. and? His word is not gospel, more doctors have taken it than haven’t. He is the anomaly
I don't have antibodies, but still have my body and only I am authorized to decide what I do with it... there is no need for discussion about this...
Do we have human rights anymore?
Catch COVID from someone who got vaccinated and I got laid off from my work for not vaccinated to protect others...I am still confuse on blaming people who are not vaccinate to be the one spreading it.
vaccine experts 😂😂😂😂
1:24: ?! Health Secretary the Antibodies last longer when accquired from Covid exposure than from the booster as far as I am aware (years minimum...). The Doctor made an understandable point about already being immune naturally...He wanted to take the risk ...Not all Doctors do so being vaccinated should be done out of a freedom of choice this video has taught me. Unvaccinated people may die but that is the risk they were willing to take when choosing to be unvaccinated (for any ailment where death could be an outcome)
What happened to my body my choice or do we have to be transgender to be able to say that
Well done. The whole vaccine “trial” was just a big scam for politicians and big pharma to make big bucks. They push it and push it and in some cases make it mandatory.  Here in Canada they forced doctors and nurses to get jabbed or get fired. Now they’re saying oh we’re so short staffed. Wtf did they think was gonna happen? Everyone was going to comply? I don’t think so. There’s not enough info about the vaccine long term and what it could do. No thanks.
This doctor should concentrate on administering medicine and leave the scientists to talking about protection.
The nurses seemed too scared to talk  but this doctor wow!!! This doctor is amazing! Admirable courage!!!!!!!!  Health secretary didn't  have any info to back his position. Appalling, embarrassing. Science is all about data interpretation,  there can be more than 1 opinion ..."the very best advice" means very little.
The human race will to survive no matter how bad their lives are is tremendous.
Sajid javid, a man who has a degree in economics and works in a bank trying to talk to health care professionals about vaccines. And if this situation was reverse and it was Sajid who was against the vaccine, he would be pubically shamed. 'we take advice, when we can, from vaccine experts' he's such a mug.
"I respect that" ("but frankly I don't give a s**t because that opinion doesn't line my pockets")
Finally a person with a brain
Well done for having the balls to speak up. The awkward silence when the ladies were asked spoke volumes
Really sad to see that your job depends on vacination, they just deported world number 1 tennis player for not beeing vacinated saying he is dangerous for citizens of Australia, he is playing one man game with pretty much no contact with anyone like what is this bs
I like how he tells the Doctor that they take the best advice from experts(who have been proven to be the liars) and are making millions if not billions off this. They never seem to mention conflict of interest is more dangerous than the actual pandemic
"Thats your view" he says to a doctor who says the science isn't strong enough to support mandatory vaccines...ummm that's "sciences" view there buddy.
That doctor is an absolute chad.
I know a nurse who works in a hospital & she has informed me that the hospital she works at hasn't been busy since this pandemic & she will not accept the jab/jabs something is going on behind closed doors  Please people wake up do not trust the jab/jabs  Big up to the doctor for speaking up  One Love !
The politician should feel like Gestapo the way everyone wouldn't dare be frank and honest to his face.   He represents a regime, not a government.
Good for that doctor for speaking out!! 👏👏🙏
'Advice from vaccine experts'.....What about all the other experts that would like to share their opinions? I think I'd rather hear from them too and Hilary Jones getting angry at this doctor (GMB interview) was just childish and unprofessional.
Where is the woman power??
I’m a healthcare provider in the same situation. Had a symptomatic Covid infection in 11/20 and an asymptomatic delta infection this past fall. My SARS2 IgG is 2000x higher than the threshold as of 12/21. Yet these people still say the same garbage “we don’t know how long it’ll last”. Well dummy we know the vaccine hardly lasts past 6mos initially and that immunity after infection is far more robust.
What an odious class of people politicians are, born to lie and those nauseating little hand movements like a cheap car salesman spiv. Why do we listen to these fakes?
The nurse sitting down, that breath says all 0:10 . It became taboo to say something bad about the vax. so sad...
Compliance. This is about filtering out the critical minded and replacing them with the blindly obedient.
Anesthesiologist talking about virology lol! Everything he said was bullshit and counter to what the top virologist said. 1) Vaccines induce more antibodies than natural infection not the other way around. 2) antibodies don’t only last 2 months.
Recommend and coerce are 2 diferent thing .
I know a few who were vaccinated who still caught covid. Whereas I decided to not get vaccinated and I have been alright. Getting the vaccination should be a choice and not forced on people like that. Also, I do think it is disgusting how those who choose not to be vaccinated are treated. I have experienced it myself with having to deal with rude people who have completely spoken down to me because I have made the choice to remain unvaccinated. Hats off to this doctor for speaking up. I do feel this vaccine gives people a false sense of protection and isn't very effective. I say that because I have friends who are vaccinated and those vaccines didn't stop them from getting poorly. Also, my mum and my little brother's girlfriend caught the virus after being vaccinated as well. Also, my friends now don't bother with wearing masks now even though most had covid and got over it. As for myself although I am unvaccinated. I do wear a mask and I don't like being in crowds anyway. But yes I think everyone should have a choice whether they should get the vaccine and people shouldn't be shamed or made to feel guilty if they decide on not taking the vaccine.
It's all about money and control
Tyrannical corrupt health ministers should be investigated by the tax departments globally
Brave guy, respect.
COVID 19 = Dr. Fauci, Bill Gates, China & Politicians🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Vaccine expert said the clown to the Doctor🤣🤣🤣That clown is a Politician making MONEY from the VAX!!!! The only debate is to agree with the Mandate!!! Mask up, Test up, VAX up & Shut up🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Imagine being a public official mouthpiece and not knowing anything about anything.
Health secretary knows nothing and he has absolutely nothing to add so he just keeps waffling on about we take advice from experts and basically telling the doctor he knows nothing.
Dnt have it
It's poison 🤔
I'm happy to get treated by an unvaxxed doctor!
Basically what is happening is that they are trying to boost people faster than the virus infects them. Anyone can see that is not going to happen.
The jab should always be a choice, no one should feel force to have it.
The hero!
Love it. Exposure at its finest
The NHS staff were forced to work around Covid at its most dangerous before a vaccine. Its absurd to sack those who are not vaxed
They still pretend like there's a good reason to get this vaccine/violate people's rights. Stop pretending it's reasonable at all what these nut heads are saying
This dr is a hero!! ♥️🙌🏼👏🏼
What a relief, a doctor with common sense. A rare breed these days!
They had him on a morning show n called him an anti vaxer, they attacking him for his own body choice!!  Its madness what's going on!!!
Stupid government policies
Haven't had any jabs and have not been sick once. I work in retail and delivery driving, also am in the gym multiple times a week and out and about the rest of the time. All with no mask
He should not be allowed to be around patients
kinda sus the dr had no credentials, different scrubs and a non n95 mask lol
Disgusting and he's ignoring a real doctor with facts this world were living in needs a change and people ignoring the problem isn't helping the fact
Vaccine experts?? LOL!!!!
Our officials, media , medical establishment and big pharma has build this massive money making , life ruining , politically destabilizing Covid machine . Now that’s it’s up and running at full throttle they don’t know how to shut it off without going to jail !!!
😂 The doctor destroyed that little penis. Haha
It is frowned on to not to get jabbed. Natural immunity is the preferred protection  against any virus.
This is what it looks like when calm intelligence encounters , stupid , pointless , authoritarianism.
Let it all collapse , let’s see how the politicians and their enablers make out then .
Fascist Anti Vaxxer who clearly doesn’t understand medical science unlike our glorious politicians!!!
It's an opinion , not science , doctors not a vaccine expert
Sajid javid, who has no qualifications whatsoever in science of any sort, lecturing a consultant from kings college, one of the best and brightest hospitals in the world is quite simply a complete embarrassment.
Much respect ✊🏼
Good for him! Common sense prevail.
Anyone seen this doctor on good morning  since this theres something a bit different with him...I think
Anyone who disagrees with NHS staff being sacked for vaccination status can sign the government petition that is due to be debated on 24th Jan:  Prohibit employers from requiring staff to be vaccinated against Coof 19
what a great rigorous comeback Sajid Javid had. Oh wait it was missing...
No mandates for anyone especially for experimental drugs that have not been used before in human history
Health secretary frantically looking around for another "yes man" to agree with HIS opinion and not the doctor. Clearly the HS hasn't a bloody clue.
Toll the line brother😆
This is so sad seriously.  This doctor has some heart man.
"we take the very best advice that we can... from the people that are vaccine experts" lol what a way to rapidly close a discussion
Hahahahahaha huhuhu
The best doctor in the world 👍👍👍
“From the people that are vaccine experts”. Basically just dismissed this doctor as not knowing enough. How DARE he talk to the doctor like that. I know which skills I would rather have with me on a desert island and Javid is not who I would choose. Disgusting politician. Why bother visiting the hospital and even asking the question he asked when he already has his answer formed. This was a media stunt that backfired. Keep your freedom. Don’t consent!
Hero ❤ keep speaking up
The Government MHRA infecting people with covid 19 Antigen Test and Trace kits which contain Coronavirus hazardous pathogens when used Swabs are then administered in to individuals
From the people who are BULLSHIT experts
I am so glad that there is a person who raised his voice and said his opinion in front of camera towards to someone with power.
Dr Brave ❤️🙏🏽❤️☺️❤️🌅
He's on anti bodies and what else? And malaria vaccine/medication or something stronger. Followers of the anti vax cult will not get the whole truth from their leaders.
Hey dummy, natural antibodies are what have protected our species since inception. Take the vaccine or not, who cares, but stop lying about known science.
Good on him 🙏
Respect.
Brave and clever doctor
He speaks for me. I work for the NHS too and am on the brink of losing my job. I too have had covid and thus also have antibodies. My last vaccine left me with psychosis. It’s taken 7 years for my brain to completely heal. Any thought of getting a vaccine gives me PTSD.
Respect!
This is what a conversation between an intelligent person and a professional liar looks like.
Good answer minister!!, that’s one opinion, take advise from a real experts, not some GP.
Mafia democracy!
Did he just said "Vaccine Experts"?! What a moron. Typical disposable journalist.
Surprised sky uploaded this to be honest
Here’s a longer interview with Dr. James .   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ik6cxFBbBw
Fantastic NO ONE SHOULD BE SACKED FOR REFUSING AN UNTESTED MAN MADE DRUG!
Stick to your guns Dr James to many staff being forced out of jobs for this nonsense, well said
I find it very insulting that I took the time out to be vaccinated yet an NHS doctor refused to do.   Therefore, I will refuse to be treated by such a "so called caring medical person".  Clearly this Doctor doesn't seem to care the increased pressure that will be piled on the NHS and long suffering patients.  How selfish can a person get?
Wait how/when did Caillou become health secretary?
Thanks Doc for speaking your truth 👏
The doctor knows the jab doesn’t even help for long lmao, I’m surprised sky news has actually posted this video
That guy who pretends to be a health minister didn't expect the doctor's answer and he turned to nurses to get a different reply...but it is obvious what the nurses believe as well
love the way the nurses say nothing ha ha
Vaccines experts lol...aka big pharma
well done to that doctor for speaking the truth.. hope that bulb headed idiot listens to doctor who actually knows what he is talking about..
So what if it wanes. As long as I've been alive people get sick. People recover and yes some people die. It is nature's way.  Stop this insanity
Medical staff literally standing there muzzled. Fascinating visual.
Savid getting schooled... please listen
Wow, the nurses saying nothing at all just says it all! This doctor is a legend, i'll take his advice over these so called vaccine experts any day! 👍
It’s a testament to the insanity of the ‘Covid Cult’ that we are all surprised when a physician speaks rationally about vaccination.
I must say, thanks for posting this - even posting it unedited if not in entirety.
Absolutely brilliant not enough evidence and we are all being watched and hearded like animals  I've had all my have including my booster and I have been nothing but ill since will not be taking anymore well done to this icu doctor for standing up for himself and possibly all the millions of people who may be brain washed to getting these jags
It’s so refreshing to hear someone in the medical field speak out against this mandatory vaccine tyranny with logic reason and common sense 👍👍👍👍👍👍
"Vaccine experts," more like paid experts making tons of money.
The real question is, why did they allow this piece to run and get global traction? It ostensibly destroys the narrative they've worked so hard to instantiate. And it looks like what the Dr. said wasn't going to be a surprise to everyone there. Interesting how the media controls the flow of ideas, and we sheep just eat it up. Maybe they released this one-off to seem like the media is unbiased and not paid-off? Ha, that's a laugh. Or maybe a release valve to lower the pressure a bit before they come right in months later with the same Dr. who then will say, "I've changed my opinion on the matter since now the virus is so bad", and the little sheep who once applauded this Dr. for his bravery will come running in and get their jabs like good scared little boys and girls. Who knows?
It's like a big joke from the top to just say "because I said so".  The media is on their side too. A silent war going on.
The science is NOT strong enough.  But the herbs and fasting are.
We need more doctors like him!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The jab doesn’t work against Omicron and Omicron is mild anyway. Government needs to stop trying to control our lives.
Then fire him. Job done.
Great to see those COVID hysterics like jabbit get fucked
the nurses are very quiet?
The man speaks facts. Mad respect !
https://youtu.be/Kh2vWO58sj4 let's hear him explain himself in details
Hahaha. That says it all! After a very thoughtful debate from the doctor, all they can come back with is the narrative they have been fed. "We only take advice from vaccine experts" omg lol😄🤣🤫
God bless this man may the truth finally come out !
Surprised sky allowed this lovely little snippet on their propaganda channel as it goes against the mainstream opinion that unjabbed are all silly conspiracy theorists.
The thing that pissed me off was the doctor was speaking facts and then this guy turns around and says "That's your opinion" he's a senior doctor working in the NHS and has been seeing this payout infront of him first hand.
When 90% of the staff are getting the jab, what is this pussy scare of ? Seriously…. What is his worried?
Brave dude
Male Karen 😅 nhs is so busy yeah they look so so busy they need a pay rise 😷
Take it or get the hell out.
He said they take advice "from the people who are vaccine experts". *That DOES NOT MEAN they are experts in the human immune system and or how the human body actually works. And it doesn't mean they are honest. And it doesn't mean they are infallible. It DOES mean they make money from it.*
Clearly actors and fake news ran by Russians and China in order to make us less protected to the virus that has killed so many people shame
Well said Doctor...
I'm just taking the booster shots in hope that one day, I'll accidentally get some experimental stuff and develop superpowers.
Interviewed condescendingly said after the doctor supported his stance, “…that’s your view” lmao.  Edit: typo
The health minister is an immigrant. Yeahh something is wrong here. They should not be in charge in a foreign country
Doctors at the surgery I used to work at were not happy at all. "Next they will make us [women] wear a coil".
Thing is the health Secretary doesn't care about people who don't get the vaccine because they want everyone to, like every other sick country who think they can just do what they want twisted messes
This is absolutely despicable. Unfortunately this doctor will be responsible for thousands of deaths. Many people will misinterpret what he has said, and now refuse to get the vaccine as they will be under the impression they can also develop a natural immunity. Yes many of them will just develop a natural immunity after contraction, but many will end up being admitted into ICU (taking up beds from those that really need them, such as cancer patients), and a handful will end up dying. All because those individuals won’t necessarily understand the intricacies of the science and how immunisation really works. So yes, I understand his rationale, he has developed a natural natural immunity, but your responsibility is a doctor in setting a good example to the population is most important. Not to undermine the importance of the vaccine regime on NATIONAL TELEVISION. I literally cannot believe what this doctor has said and hope he gets investigated. This doctor is in the 1% of selfish individuals, thank God we have a 99% population of moral and ethical doctors in the UK that would NOT make this statement on national TV.
The other pandemic  is people  like Javid who clearly don't do critical  thinking, think for theirselves  and lack common sense.
Listen to the doctor, don’t get the jab!
Stick your vaccine up your arse
All bullshit, a bit like skynews
Good for him ..they are ruling us …
It looks to me like the doctor has the prestige and authority to speak up when a lot of the other staff are too afraid. I've had my booster over Christmas, I've been very ill with delta and I work in a school which is currently rife with Omicron, but I don't want NHS staff who we were all clapping on our doorsteps to face the sack over this. It's terrible that everyone just abandoned the care workers for refusing the vaccine. School staff will be next and staff I work with don't want the vaccine.  Unfortunately because this arguement has been left to the fringes, people might assume that i am anti vaccine, but I'm not, I am just aware that public services need staff to function, and that many of us have gone above and beyond for two years and none of us deserve the sack.
Literally,  the vaccine uses your NATURAL IMMUNE SYSTEM to teach it how to fight a disease.  To claim that the natural immune system is LESSER than the vaccine is a completely illogical stance not based in science or just BASIC REALITY.
The big man stepped up and told him straight yet like all politician still doesn't  listen because he has a dark agenda  to push
Savid is not a doctor as far as I'm aware, telling an actual doctor "that's your opinion" shows how little these politicians listen to those who pay thier wages.  It wasn't just his opinion, it was his professional opinion as a healthcare worker, which is worth more than any politicians lies.
Excellent!
Not mandatory!  Well done King's College Hospital!!!
How soon does natural immunity wane of compared to vaccine immunity for delta and omicron variants?
This is fantastic at last a chance for a real human being to have a small platform of time to tell the truth that little brown rat and the rest of the filth in the ivory towers doesn’t want the mass population to hear. Fan bloody tastic ❤️🙏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿😀😊
🤣 Health secretary isn’t educated enough to argue with dude
Well done Dr. 👏  tell the truth bro 💯
It's absolute bollocks that the protection from the vaccine is insufficient after a month. Pfizer efficacy goes from around 90% to around 60% over the course of 6 months. If the entire country would be protected at 60% efficacy, that would likely still destress the healthcare system to such a degree that no measures are required. This medical professional is wilfully or naively spreading fake information that could destabilise his own industry.  He is right that having gone through an infection provides him with adequate antibodies, though.
Good on him no jab mandatory vaccines are evil
GOD BLESS THIS DOCTOR, can’t say it enough
In Netflix women can beat up 10 men but in real life this is women "bravery"... Sitting there in quiet none of them had the courage to speak up.
When stabbings are so common in your country that your terminology is "jab."
Now there's a man who knows the truth
Didn't realise I was watching an #Owned video
Much respect for the guy going in the open. These people in government are pure criminals. It is disgusting. And these other being silent instead of supporting the colleague. Sad.
Refreshing to see a Doctor talk sense instead of towing the party line...
It's a personal choice it's disgusting we are making people have it for their job
I call b.s on the "we take the best advice from vaccine experts".  Are Drs considered experts? Dr Robert Malone should be considered an expert!
That hospital is a complete dump and one of the worst in the country.
Big respect to the doctor for facing the devilish javid face to face.
Poor doctor seemed scared to speak out, let's hope they don't flood his PC with pdf submittals.
Vaccine experts ?   Let them be experts.. noone is stopping them... but this doctor makes a good point.
FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VACCINE EXPERTS!   LOL
74K likes 😱
Notice only the man speaks up.
When a doctor on the front line tells the politician the truth he doesn’t want to hear it. We take advice from the vaccine experts. Name one vaccine expert. Then why do we still have covid. Not much of an expert.
I have friends working in the NHS. They lied- vaccine will be mandatory from April. One was told she either get vaccinated or dismissed. Law has changed also to allow employers to dismiss people on this ground legally. Of course they are scared. I am sure many doctors and nurses will leave the NHS this year…they are just bidding time to think of what to do next or where to move…
I really hope the powers don't make an example of this young doctor. May God protect him against those who would desire to harm him and others like him with integrity.
Legend. Nobody should be forced to get an injection that has Emergency Use Authorisation.
Takes advise from the money men and corporations pulling his strings. The real power behind governments
He isn’t the only health care worker. It’s the nhs managers pushing for this and the nhs managers aren’t doctors and probably haven’t ever been doctors
Vaccines are weak they dont last long and the pressure put on us to do it despite it not working how it should is insanely unfair and cruel.  I had my 2 doses but I'm relieved its quite useless and will not stay in my body for long.
Politician is dismissive, lacks knowledge and is disinterested in listening and learning. Arrogant
That doctor didn’t kill him self
Well done doctor. Finally some truth from a very respected guy. Nurses n doctors know more about this stuff than the rich pricks in London that don't care about anyone , they only care about their bank balance. #nevertrustapolitician
He's not even a practitioner, he's an anaesthetist. I'd rather listen to the overwhelming majority of virologists who are actually experts in their field.
That doc is the man
Apparently he wasnt there for a discussion, only there to belittle non agreers. The MP doesnt understand how doctors in Western medicine practice evidence based medicine. They are trained to critically look at research.
A consultant Anastheist is not a doctor people. We literally have little clue how anaesthesia works, he uses that anaesthesia. Definitely not a doctor.
Cowardly nurses.
Dangerous times when the establishment threaten to sack our brilliant nhs staff should they refuse to have an unknown fluid pumped into them. These doctors and nurses need to hold their ground as we need them far more then these idiot mps
I've had some scares where I've unknowingly spent 4 hours + with infected individuals and at present 24/7 with my infected family but I have presented as a negative on all PCR tests I've taken (10+). I'm not sure why this is the case but maybe I've been infected in the past and been asymptomatic (doubt this as i've been living with my family since the start of 2020 and they did not get covid-19 until presently) or maybe it's down to a strong immune system. I am unvaccinated. I support this doctors point of view and his reasons for not getting it.
The narrative is slowly changing over here. Its falling apart in the states just need europe now to crumble
Saj (coconut) Just a complete fool..!   This doctor would do a better job than sajja....!
big harma gains all from le vax.....they have no intrest in our health only money and track records prove that
minister not listening to an actual doctor ffs
Stupid move for hospitals to mandate this crap because they're losing good doctors and nurses.
No.one should be afraid to have an opinion in a democracy nor feel afraid
I’m not having anymore I was essentially forced to have the first two to keep my job…
THESE ARE OUR HERO DOCTORS!!!
How about getting a vaccine that is effective against covid for up to 6 months, but that would mean Pfizer making less money.
Interesting stuff, a politician that think he’s knows more than a doctor and doctor that thinks he knows more than a scientist.
Remove politicians & their mandates, allow doctors to treat the sick.
Natural immunity is better than a vaxx. Your immune system gets trained better to the real thing, thus making it stronger against the virus for later encounters.
Vaccine experts my friends not a nurse or Doctor 💉
They just keep wanting to push the crap ... Brainwashed collaborators in white shirts...total bs.
He is one in a million 🤩🥇
That Health Secretary is Pakistani - so no one actually takes him seriously.
People are so scared to speak out its disgusting how people are so scared they can't speak whatever they think about this , rather hide behind a mask and not say nothing at all... it's very sad..
Finally a true doctor who is not a sheep well done buddy
genetic variant in our blood make some of us vulnerable and most of us unaffected. Check last week researches! There is even a test on going, so we will be able to find out if we are at risk
The NHS doctor knows what he is doing, as to why he is not for the vaccines, since he firmly believes on the practice that he believes, in action at the hospital(s) while also doing his best to do his work/profession.  It is always an example on the end of the doctor that knows himself, his standards about vaccines, as to active ingredients, formulations and the adverse effects from excessive. The NHS Health Secretary has delivered and to date delivers the importance of knowing the sides/technical aspects of health, the vaccines, and the reports that it has from numerous cases collected from both private and public sector(s) since it is not just the vaccines that prevents, the food, nourishment per derivatives, nutritional intake, the figures of the nutrition, the way the hospitals, patients were placed safely inside the hospital, the way systematic Queen Elizabeth Hospital was designed, for the purposes of hospitalization, part oval and another segment rectangular, in all floors. The Health secretary knows the cleanliness standards and sanitation of the hospitals, it has new exhaust fans, as well as a huge AIR duct, that siphons the bad air from all floors, in order to contain/remove and kill trapped viruses in the air, for it not to be inhaled, the way incubators are designed for newly born, to protect them from harmful viruses, since it has a barrier. Congratulations Conservatives for always being evident in the places 2021 2022 onwards, and to numerous improvements for a lifetime as Conservation, conservatism, CONSERVATIVES. HRH HRH HRH HRH 1892
Great we support this Dr.
I thought naturally acquired antibodies were lifelong?
For all the antivaxxer applauding. He isn't against vaccine and is in full support of needed vaccine but not the covid vaccine and definitely not the booster because of its questionable efficacy.
“From the people that are actual experts” 😂😂 how often is the “experts” right? Its not often
He’s an idiot & the doctor needs to find a new job.
Truth is treason in an empire of lies.
Exactly, I'm not a dr but this has been my struggle and argument. That man needs a go fund me now, I bet. But if he needs any help I'd be honoured to help him.
This doctor is wrong
Thatta boy
I encourage anyone talk to their doctor about getting the vaccine and follow their advice. I do however disagree with the mandates, if someone wants to risk getting sick with covid and possibly die, that's their choice to make.
"Strongly encourage" sounds more like "strongly demand or else" these days... And they demand it so they can get their Big Pharma paychecks
Finally!
"Vaccine experts"  The people who profit from selling them or the people who get paid by big pharma for promoting them???
Boosters every month seems like a pretty good business plan for Big Pharma.
Good for him!
Because he’s smart…
Don't get jabbed
That tid bit at the end " we take the best advice we can get... from virus experts" that doc stated he has worked in a covid unit from the start and had covid as well i think he would qualify for a "expert" in that field... also medicine is very personal what i take would not help someone that dose not suffer from what i suffer from, so why the hell is social medicine even a thought?
EVERYTHING ABOUT COVID MANDATES ARE NUREMBERG CODE VIOLATIONS!    STOP COMPLYING !!!
The real doctor with real conscience that truly cares about the health of people.
Masking Humans is SLAVERY, stop wearing those diapers on your face
Love this man speaking his mind and not being afraid
There’s sane people still left on this earth?
He is right, I had the real disease  twice in a row 1.5 months apart, similar symptoms with similar variant, no decreased of symptoms & not spared from re-infection.
God bless this doctor
God damn..This guy is a real. Love him, he's just exposing the lack of common sense in government policy over mandatory vaccination, I guess sense is not common to SOME.
I don’t want this doctor anywhere near me or my family
UK maybe different but in Aus nurses and doctors got let go for not getting the Vax, they recently changed the rules so essential workers(eg nurses and doctors) can go to work covid positive as long as they aren't showing symptoms like a runny nose. How does that make sense?
He is a hero! He stood up for his belief.
Other staff need to start speaking out , God bless and protect this doctor 🙏
The nurses have big mouth only with patients harassing them but in front of the camera they go deaf and they try to be nice and caring
Well said 👏
👍👍👍
The only problem with this point of view, to which he is fully entitled, is that what would happen if everyone refused the vaccine. Deaths in the millions. I don't feel he should lose his job over it though having risked so much to care for those in trouble.
Health Secretary: "We take the very best advice that we can from people that are vaccine experts"  GTFO. The doctor has a point and he is just ignoring it. Health Secutary is only there for publicity to make it look like they're doing everything to help.
i hope he won't get sacked lol
I just find it interesting that the health secretary when confronted with a very logical response deflects to the ‘vaccine experts’… that isn’t a rebuttal, that’s scapegoating… and why there isn’t any fluidity when having a civil discourse, his responses are so rigid as to say the Doctor doesn’t know what he’s talking about; any rational person can listen to an opposing view and if it makes sense, at least try to see where they’re coming from but there’s none of that in his demeanour and there’s a reason 😅…. At the other end of this vaccine parade, someone is getting paid 💷
Welldone Doctor for speaking up!
Salute to this doctor... Atleast some exposure of truth from this COVID Stupidity..
Ppl keep showing off they have been double vaxxed, and then have issues when u tell them “u do know u can still get covid and share it”
Well done to the doctor !!!!
A jab every month, what do they think this is one of Boris' parties
اي دولة ممكن توقف هذه المهزلة والمطلوب هو مقاطعة المستشفيات وكل قطاعات الأدوية واللجوء للتداوي بالطب البديل...وخليهم يطلعوا الأرقام الوهمية
This man is a doctor in the NHS, speaking eloquently with a posh, educated accent. He would not be regarded as a crazy anti-vaxer. However, if this was someone living on a council estate, from the North East of England, with exactly the same view, they would be seen as selfish, thick anti- vaxers.
"We take the advice from the best people we can" - ignores everything the guy working daily for the last 2 years has to say
A dickhead like the health Secretary is not sensible
I’ve had 9 covid jabs now
I thought at the beginning we had a choice over the vaccine but with every passing day the government do more and more to force us
Dear is a different between a media doctor and a medical doctor i am talking about the Itv doctor hilbilly prank
These kind of doctors need to be sacked
Well we take the very best Advice we can. magic mirror on the wall who should get the vaccine after all?  eeny meeny miny mo catch some covid from your bro. if he dies let him go. eeny meeny vacine woes.
These nurses were scared as hell to actually say anything. Absolutely trapped.
I tottaly agree with the doctor 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🥇🥇🥇he is a real HUMAN !
This is a DOCTOR who's studied his whole life giving a polition who doesn't need any degree or qualifications for his job giving him his expert opinion. Does he listen?? Nope!!! Not at all
Hearing people speak reasonably has gotten rare.. it boggles my mind how so many people dont see something so obvious
Not nided rubbish  vaccin.
Beautiful 👏👏👏👏
If I knew that the booster only gives a month protection,I would have thought twice and getting it. I see why they kept that quiet. What a brave doctor
Javid's experts,  Sage and Pfizer.
Good man for speaking up
Wow soon this guy will be the Prime minister of UK
Hats off to this doctor who's not afraid to speak out and calmly present a well-articulated set of arguments to defend his position. But though his attitude starkly contrasts with that of many 'antivax' whose irrational refusal is purely based on emotions, one should not forget that a vast majority of doctors opted in favour of the jab, considering that the information given to them was actually sufficient to make such a choice. Who's right ? I don't know. All I can say is that the Health Secretary seems to be a very open and considerate person, which unfortunately is not the case in many other European countries.
Good lad. Think for yourself.
I fully agree my colleague! This gen therapy is not usefull at all. Stay strong or leave the job.
Well done. Dont get jabbed.
F@ck this Covid  mafia..... Don't give up your freedom.
It's no use being reasonable with that health secretary. Blind as he is.
The Netherlands and others should have a doctor like this gentleman 💪
LEGEND
Much respect for the man.... All the politicians talk about its vaccinations.... Can't beat natural protection.....
Well done to the consultant. Exercising his rights 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Absolutely disgusting a doctor doesn't want the jab for valid reasons so the best idea is fire him and the others who choose the same. Make the struggle harder for the already struggling NHS good move!!!makes sense
Based
Disgusting that the very people who have selflessly looked after our population, seeing trauma everyday have been effectively forced into a vaccine in order to keep their job. Disgrace. Javid’s response sums up the modern politician, inept and incapable of thinking on their feet, unable to answer question and apply logic. Utter disgrace. I’ve had two jabs before I get called an anti Vaxer
What a guy, willing to put his point across to that muppet.
Dude is speaking what he believes and I bet on everything he will get nothing but earache for this from higher ups.
Incomponent at its peak
If this was China that doctor would be missing by now
These healthcare workers have saved lives and seen some horrific stuff . They are loved by many and have worked so hard to get where they are . How dare people tell them what they have to put in there bodies or get sacked . Keep speaking up , there’s a lot more people who agree !
This guys a hero
Its not all about the transmission tho, sure the vaccine is only about 60-70% effective against transmission but it’s 90+ percent effective against serious illness and COVID antibodies after 6 months drop to levels lower then the vaccine anyway so unless u had COVID in the last 6 months ur way better off with the vaccine
We are going to lose many more great doctors not to COVID but to stupid rules that they can't even follow
Well done for having the balls to speak up. The awkward silence when the ladies were asked spoke volumes
Hel lllllo I'm not a anti vaxer. But this don't add up. When I see them stop vax the mass then I might consider. But there is no way I'm going on this never ending jabbathon. I tell ya that now
Imagine getting 4 polio vaccines and still getting polio 😄
I agree with him he should not lose his job because he's not vaccinated when the vaccine dose not last long and vaccinated people can still spread covid. We will lose our good drs and the government will use this TO privatise the nhs after they have brought it crashing down. They been looking for a way to privatise it and I think this is how they are going to do it. I had my first vaccine against my better judgement and have not been right since. Won't be having any more.
Well done Dr for the people 👫 in the world 🌏 🌎🌍👬👭👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👪👍👏😇🙏❤️
That health secretary was quite condescending when he says we'll leave it up to the vaccine specialists, whoever they mite be?! Big up to the doctors.
this doctor is gold! intelligent and brave!
Health & social care get rid of the government
I am pretty sure they are not 90%
It's called human rights let people make there own choice, that's all people want dont punish these hard working people who have been there since the beginning. He is a trained doctor who I'm sure is trained with regards to vaccines.
the doctor is legend
"We take advice from those that are vaccine experts" aka shut up your JUST a doctor.
"Vaccine experts" 😂 He's literally a doctor...
The doctor came out after this and said he got some of the stuff he said wrong and that he was pro vaccine. Weird.
Let's hope nothing happens to that doctor who seem to talk more sense than anybody.
Yessss, this doctor knows what he is talking about and that politician is just talking rubbish. I think we should start a petition.
I never took and will not. I support him 100% vaccinacion for this is pointless. It can make more bad then good
The doctor is a profile in courage
Brilliant reply. The funny thing is, if Mr Javid really does consult the 'proper experts', he'd soon find out that many of them would be saying the same things as this brave doctor said!
He is right! Natural immunity is much better!
Brilliant brave doctor..should be be more comming out
A true hero!
1% of climate scientists also said global warming wasn't real nor human caused if it was real.   And as we know... The 1% of any group is always the RIGHT ones.  (To those who just WANT to believe the opposite of what the vast majority of the experts are saying).
They will kill him to make a example of him
The vaccine shouldn't be mandatory but people who don't have it should be secondary to people who do when getting healthcare
Typical reprobate uneducated politician. The facts must give way to the political agenda..  & this one stinks.
Great , fire him , get another job looser 🙏😷👍
The very best advice from the people behind the scenes 💰 💵
And who are these vaccine experts?  So far the people I've seen are Gauci and politicians.
Dr Steve James….. make a YouTube channel
God bless this doctor for telling truth !
So if a doctor talking logical science  , now condemned by the Covid Cult as a liar . Believe science ? What a joke this world become
I don't mean to be argumentative or disrespectful, but can't a vaccinated doctor shed the virus just as well as an unvaccinated doctor? ( in response to concerns about this particular doctor being unsafe to stand near a patient)
What is the vaccine shot given to medical staff that prevents them from catching and developing aids from a patient. CAN WE ALL HAVE THAT ONE TOO ? or is that shushy shushy.
anybody ever see that old movie with vincent price the last man on earth.... i am prepared to be last lone known survivor to NOT have that poison injected in me if need be among a world gone mad...
The "experts" aren't they the ones making all the money from the vaccine?
Well done doc!!
Brave man standing up for what he believes.
Respect to Steve James for calmly and eloquently expressing the concerns of many within the NHS and broader society, and for challenging dogma, sometimes referred to as ‘the science’ on the issue of vaccination.
Javid "we're taking advice from vaccine experts!"  THOSE THAT SUPPORT YOUR NARRATIVE. Take  Dr.Mike Yeadon ex executive Pfizer microbiologist "banned from debating" the ongoing debate Javaid speaks about.....what debate would that be? What credentials does this fool have to debate this or any other health related issue with even a junior doctor.
This doctor is to be admired for what he said.
ive had natural immunity for over a year man lik
What does sajid the WEF puppet actually know about science?  Are people really that thick 🤣🤣🐏🐏
This whole narrative is just such a joke 🤣🤣🤣 at this point  ... just let people believe whatever they can perceive from this all. Many have been hypnotised and brainwashed... time will show all truths and good luck to those who trust these scummy politicians and the lying media
A vaccine expert.. which one?
From essential to expendable.. smh
I am praying the so called government change this despicable coercion ruling. It draconian ! They must not lose their jobs for not having a trial drug. 🙏🌎🕊
Javid says their scientific advice is its best to have the jab, but the scientist saying this work the government so essentially they could be being told what to say
The media is the virus
Javid thought he could say some blanket statement and that be the end of it.....no sir
Has anyone verified if this Dr is  1. Still alive for speaking out on this truth?! 2. Has been hauled away to a camp for speaking this truth?!
If all the Heather care workers walked out, the government would change their mind on this
I'm sure this doctor will "mysteriously disappear" at some point in the future.
Respect doctor!
Hahahaha priceless 🤣  Way to go man.
They have already dismissed staff in care homes, they are so short staffed and it hasn't solved the issues there is still covid in the care homes today hence why they are not taking in hospital patients. Just boost the vulnerable regularly like the flu jab as its not practical to keep bosting the whole nation every few months.
Vaccine experts...those who get paid by Big Pharma
Your words are dangerous
“We will try to understand that and take everyone’s point of view”.. - silence - “from vaccine experts”. So, this is great that rules are implemented by those that have zero scientific background, like that bald man over there.
good response... perfect one doc💯💯💯
Whats your thoughts on requiring a vaccine to continue working?  Dr answers Thats your view but we’re taking our advice from vaccine experts.  What was the purpose of your original question.
🤍
So in the hospital statement they even call it a jab and not a vax
Gaslighting lives in he EU as well. That guy asks for input from a reputable source then immediately dismisses it. Pretty disgusting..
Oh, pandemic marketing live. Nice. Resist these soulless bribed "experts".
The silence of the nurses reminds me of my military service, keep your mouth shut! was the order of the day... the health ministers arrogance here is typical
Predictably this guy has been got at a few days later. He suddenly lost his articulate expression on a virtue signalling, sleazy GMB hit piece! I doubt he could go into the details since he has said enough already and probably been threatened with an early dismissal.
I’ve just watched Dr James interview for n GM Briton. How they twist his words is just infuriating!!! And Dr Hilarys opinion is 💩💩💩
I have had covid, was fine. Have antibodies. I’m 24, totally healthy and don’t want a vaccine. Why would I?
Seeing that statement at the end, it's pretty obvious that doctor's getting fired, kudos for doing what he did, I'll be sharing this video so he could get a bit more recognition
Those five nurses are the epitomy of what's happening right, too many people, are too scared to say what they think and now that Doctor who spoke up, will likely be fired and silenced by social media, because he has noone on his side backing him up. Good job world.
I love him 💪💪💪💪💪
NHS doctor (who has had 15 mandatory vaccinations) says no to vaccination.  Not all doctors are smart.
There is a huge practical benefit to boosters every 2 months: $1,000 per second profit for Farmaceuticas, according to the Oxfam Report
The head doctor just said it's no good and still they say oh our experts say this. Bullshit there's another reason why they want vaccine taken by everyone.
When everyone everywhere has accepted it as true it's almost certain to be false.    YNWA    ❤✊❤✊❤
Which ones the health secretary
"Well, that's your view"  Sounds like a pissed off spouse.   Vaccines dont stop transmission. Why are they pushing for more vaccinations?
A man that can think 4 him self , GOATS TAKE  NOTICE ...
Well the CEO of Pfizer has come out and said that the vaccine doesn't work or offers very little protection and that they are bringing a new booster in march that 100% is going to work. How can people keep falling for this obvious bullshit
Lol
That Doctor should have straight up asked that worm if he was going to sack him if he didn't get the clot shot. That would've been interesting.
I broke the like button
I'm voting for that dr as new pm of Australia next election.
The true speech we needed.💪🏻
I don't need It.
Our NHS stuff have done so much! Everyone in the front line, now this government is forcing them to get the vaccine or they get fired, freaking disgusting!  Wake up!
"Well take the best advice, that we can...'  BULL CRAP.  MONEY TALKS, AND THAT POOR DUDE AND HIS COLLEAGUE, OR GOING TO BE OUT OF A JOB.    Kingdom Come!
No idea where he’s getting those numbers from, another video made by an actual virologist showed comparisons of antibody tests from people who had had 3 2 1 or no vacations and the results even a year after the last dose didn’t even come close to supporting what he is saying
We don’t have enough doctors as it is, so to sack more over something so stupid would certainly be the death of the NHS.
Congrats for courage, asking questions and looking for answers is our hope
If a Doctor don't want to get that S**** so what they expecting from other people.  Be Free!
Lol the Dr is telling him he is constantly exposed to Covid and the politician obviously has 0 knowledge 🤦🏼‍♂️ utter stupidity.  I got vaccinated because I have little exposure to people thus the vaccination actually has a benefit but I have not working on a Covid intensive care unit for 2+ years
This clearly went on longer than your showing. The thumbnail is from a different place. Show the rest please sky
Why was this cut off with the idiot getting the last word?
Ffs, they needed a disclosure at the end
From vaccine experts???? Who is the vaccine expert? Fauci??? Cause every report says the same thing so.....
I like the gaps at the bridge of the nose on the mask. Go Doc, tell them the facts. Eventually it might sink in but I have a better chance of my immune system doing it's job than morons listening to reason.
In other words we are making money. That doctor is awesome
The fear to say what they want to is clear as day at the start of this. Then he goes on to ignore an expert because he isn't getting told what he wants to hear.
Human right
https://youtu.be/UP4voM92r3k Here's a simple video from someone 7yrs ago.... This is about natural immunity. Be smart people
Everyone walked away from him :)
Best doctor!!! Facts
At least one person in the NHS dares to question authority. Javid will face trial for crimes against humanity.
It is not a VIEW. Nor an OPINION. It is HARD SCIENCE. And it is undisputable what the man said. So there are no other correct views on it. He's had COVID and he is immune to it for the rest of his life. Everything he said is not up for discussion. It has already been discussed and proven.
Javid is a complete moron, dosnt know what to say in reply to the Doctor. Waste of space.
Its just the sniffles.   I thought Hitler was dead.
We take the best advice, from people that study how to make Profits for big Pharma
Im going to wstch again
On a comment of someones I found in the comment list , I watched again.  Watch closely the body language of the guy in the white shirt . Watch how he intimidates the nurses and even moves towards them . OMG!
That Doctor does a fantastic full interview here https://youtu.be/4Ik6cxFBbBw
He’s one person and he’d be a minority amongst his peers. He’s generalising without looking at complex variables. I knew people like this at university, mostly Bible-bashers who answer the questions in the exam as per what was taught in the course, yet don’t believe a word of the information they recite. He shouldn’t be a doctor employed in the public sphere.
RESPECT .
THE FOXES ARE IN THE HEN HOUSE!! WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM HAS COORDINATED GOVERNMENT, MEDIA, CORPORATE AND MEDICAL DEPARTMENT HEADS TO EXECUTE A NEW WORLD ORDER!!! READ YOUR BIBLE!   WE ALL NEED TO STAND UP AND FIGHT THIS GARBAGE IN EACH OF OUR INDIVIDUAL SPHERES OF INFLUENCE!! THE COLLECTIVE EFFORT DOES EVENTUALLY WORK! PLEASE BE LIONS (like this doctor) and not SHEEP!
Here is a link to Dr Steve James giving a in length interview. https://youtu.be/4Ik6cxFBbBw
He is working at a bottleshop now...
Hilarious article in the Mail regarding the hero Kings College doctor who told Jabbit what’s what: “A BBC News ‘fact-checking’ article meanwhile identified a number of errors in Dr James’s remarks…”. A BBC News ‘fact-checking’ article? Who was that written by Liar McPorkies? Oh…and the articles had comments disabled. Evidence of biased propaganda.
Brave doctor. More need to speak out and stop being intimidated and coerced.
Just say no to drugs!!!!!  Stand your ground doc !!!! Thanks for stating FACTS
Funnily the cameraman probably agrees with the ballsy doctor 👍
Well said and the vid demonstrates what most of the medical profs are thinking but not saying because they will be struck off/ de registered and lose their chosen livelihood.
and this health secretary knows more then a fully trained doctor... what a joke this is.. this whole situation is a political source of control not a means of protecting people..... complete joke
Its funny how all the news clips that are biased towards mandates have comments disbled
Well done pal 👍
“It’s your view” when he mentions the facts … Fck these guys
Politicians and bureaucrats never take the best advice, they take the advice of the highest bidder.
Sajid JABvid should ask his own people to get vaccinated first before asking Australians to get jabbed. He'd be ostracized and threatened and he wouldn't squeak a word.
When they are hit with real facts they shake in their boots and hide behind their mask.
vaccine experts? what a pleb. 1:55
Anything for a camera. I feel for the doctor.
This doctor is basically being told that he doesn’t know anything. HE’S A DOCTOR!  He is a specialist!  He is a scientist!  He is the boots on the ground that has first hand, in the trenches experience!  He has street cred!  The bureaucrat doesn’t want truth to get in the way of his agenda and, more than likely, his pocketbook!
The sheep get vaccinated. It’s the same with successful people! It’s the 10% that are the most successful because they do what the sheep are not willing to do. They take risks. They question the science
Dr is a legend
This is awesome, now it’s obvious this is politically motivated and it’s not about health at all.
Now,  Vaccines "experts" vs Real Doctors(Health Experts)
I don’t believe ANY so called vaccine experts.  This doctor made more practical sense and the gentleman didn’t want to actively listen to him. He was only working to try to shut him down.  People know what is going on and trying to push a lie only makes them more determined to fight against it.  This whole Covid fiasco has made me leery of the medical community and their true intentions to treat me.
“From people who are vaccine experts” yeah a sentence like that should certainly raise a few eyebrows. What a world
These fugub  🐝🌟ds, can shove their dumbass “vaccines” up theirs, where the sun don’t shine!
respect ,this is a doctor i trust common sense
I am glad not everybody bought in by the dictator government . Feel like the government working for the Pharmaceutical industry
what a hero legend brave man ! thankyou for speaking sense and facts.
THAT'S WHAT A DOCTOR LOOKS LIKE , TIP , THERE NOT IN A CHINA LAB.......
And tell Google in the comments that u don’t like them putting their covid propaganda links below videos that they don’t agree with.  I do.    Google - take those shameful covid propaganda links down.  We don’t need u to influence what we think or believe.  We can handle thinking without your influence.
Also defund the media.  Translated - if u do not watch, they will not have advertisers paying them.  Don’t watch msm.
I applaud this doctor. He spoke facts and as usual when faced with facts the covid vaccine pushers give a vague reply, even veiled insult "we look at the BEST advice"
Your body, your choice.  My body, *MY* choice.  *_MINE!_*  Not *_YOURS._*  Not Bill Gates' choice.  *MINE!* By the way, I have received the Moderna vaccine, two shots, but it was *MY CHOICE.*  I will not be receiving a booster because *I* have decided I don't need it.
Who are these "experts" ur literally face with a doctor and your trying to dismiss his points because he is not a vaccine sheep
The health secretary seems clueless.
Praise the Lord for people started to wake up about this slow but effective bioweapon.
James 5:1-6
I understand the importance of vaccination for healthcare staff but sorry, I prefer a hospital with nurses, vaccine or not, than no one. And unfortunately in UK, we don't have the luxury of being able to have less healthcare staff
The anesthesiologist is wearing a non effective mask. Meanwhile the vaccinated health minister has got one if those fancy n95s on.
Well done Sir !
F*** The vaccine
Freedom of choice
Not from the people are vaccine expert mr health officer. From the people who are health experts. There’s a difference.
Splendid! I basically told my boss’s boss the same thing when he mentioned I might lose my job if I don’t take the vaccine! I’m said I don’t really care!
All doctors and all nurses should just walk off the job
Protection lasts 5.3 months.  I pity the poor patients that get this uneducated "doctor."
Good man 👏
I guess another doctor is going to bite the dust.
I left my career over it. It's a critical historical issue of principle and precedent. Trading permission for liberty is like trading honey bees for wasps.
my greatest takeaway from this is witnessing a doctor saying "the science isn't strong enough"
"Vaccine experts"... aka those who are paid off by certain people and companies.
That Doctor is a Hero
This potato heads doesn’t know anything about science but tried to argue with the doctor pathetic clown!
The Koolaid doesn’t work unless everyone drinks it………. J, Jones
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The science behind this plandemic is weak that it might as well be labeled science fiction.
They may take advice from the "experts" like Fauci, but this guy been proven to be a liar.  These experts will never follow the science because it will end their careers.
God, what a brave man!!👏
I am so glad to see honest, intelligent, kind, and with a mind of its own that is NOT AFRAID TO BE WHO HE IS!   THIS IS THE POWER WE ALL HAVE, THIS IS THE FREEDOM WE HAVE TO PROTECT.   Not speculation of useless politics who are gaining with the death of millions of inocente citizens.   Well done for this HERO!
Smart guy and brave  BRAWO!!!
Way togo doc, it's your rite to take it r not.
Protect that Doctor!
This was planned
lol vaccine experts aye little jab at the end Javid, I like this doctor. He's very hospital doctor-like in explaining to someone who's in the wrong on what's right!
The jabs dont stop transmission at all
👏👏👏👏👏
Bassed
I can hear the nervousness in his breath. Very proud of this brave doctor!
everyone including the 'experts' blindly kidding themselves that the vaccine is much more effective than it really is... and that natural antibodies somehow don't count... so much so that anyone pointing it out is made a pariah... why is almost the whole world so stupid, trying to gain control from a chaotic situation by getting fixated on an inadequate solution
This is weird
What a Muppet, the doctor is giving him medical advice and he is just dismissing it like he knows better. This is the reason why I'm not taking it, the government are clueless
Our government is out of control, unaccountable and unfit for purpose.
Planned and scripted bullshit
That anesthetist has more science in his pinkie than the fellow asking the question!
Humbled by his courage.
Brave doctor well done and well said, health secretary rude man,  the way he spoke to that doctor disgraceful.
Good on him
"From the people who are vaccine experts" 😅😂😂😂
Not one of those sheep backed him up.
Fk this woke commie  government  well said that man I want him as my doctor
Saj just talks straight out of his arse.
10 points , for this MD , for not being willing to give up his soverinty.  The unvaxed , are being treated like trash where I live & despite the lockdown level being the same , some places are demanding vaccination passports be produced , or no entry .  This divide the community tactic is inconsiderate , as the adverse reactions to the vaccinations have been suppressed , naturally aquired immunity is debunked , and as the virus changes , so to the number of boosters .  Oh , exposure to the common cold , it's been found , provides some immunological support , as it's a carona virus -  just one that hasn't been purposely generated & released upon the people's of the world , just so a few greedy pharmaceutical companys can pay out more in dividends to stockholders .
So the hospital used the word “Jab” in their statement?  🙄😑
This health secretary is a complete joke
Glad he's  not my doctor.
There it is folks, somebody Who is the doctor debating with somebody who is not but because this person has political power, they feel the rates that they can argue on an even playing field with regards to peoples health and medicine. We need more government and less politicians
Even doctors are tired of everything at this point. And the "vaccine experts" at the end of the day... Are big pharmaceutical monopolies. Remember doctors used to sell tobacco to us in the past
Such a brace man bless him and his family ..
He’ll take advice from the people who are Vaxine experts? 😂He means from our corrupted experts!
0:39 "that's your view"    IT DOESNT MATTER IF A DOCTOR TELLS STRAIGHT TO YOUR FACE THE TRUTH, IF IT DOESNT SUPPORT THEIR VIEW, IT'S NOT THE CORRECT VIEW, AND THAT IS WHY I WILL NEVER GET THE VACCINE!!!!
More vaccinations equals more profit for big pharma.
Time to move to rumble
🎩 off to brave doctor
Vaccine experts. He means vaccine makers. Maybe the same thing. But. There is a different philosophy in the pharmaceutical industry. Have lobbyists really got all governments fooled on science? Or do they have skin in the game too? Or are there powers above these nations making the decisions for them? Silly questions. Best return to monke
Well done 👏🏼 for standing up to these politicians who haven’t got the faintest!
Good for him speaking out ,
The banker thought this is going to be just another day at the office. The look the gray haired gentleman with glasses gave to one of his colleagues @0:18 is telling: "Well this wasn't supposed to happen".  Praise to the doctor who had the courage to speak up. Its an open secret that NHS workers are bullied, threatened and fired for telling the truth.
Why do people always need to say ' I am not antivax but it has to be free choice'. Well these so called vaccines are toxic and nobody should get them injected
127,000 doctors work for the NHS, let's ask what the other 126,999 are saying. I bet they don't agree with this guy.
Well  Done Doctor!
We take the best advice we can get from Pfizer’s marketing team
What about before he had covid? Did he have anti bodies then?  No So.... why didn't he get the vaccine?
Get the scientists back to the drawung
This is the only vaccine which has become so controversial and doubtful worldwide which means there is something bad in it.  Better to avoid till all drama behind it unfolds.
Hyperindividualism will kill the humanity.
Vaccine experts looooooooool  im dead
Gene therapy for viruses that have been around for millennia is as dumb as it gets. I can’t find a single article describing how these new variants are significantly different to previous ones. The question is are we going to hold those responsible for poisoning half the planet?
The UK  people know there's not enough science
THIS MAN IS MY HERO!! .. WE NEED MORE LIKE HIM!
Like tuners with bikes or cars on a dyno “vaccine experts” are working with the data and the forecasts and the real world transition that the doctor who’s opinion thats being discredited is seeing i would imagine.
There is no debate moron!
WOW. The disrespect towards the doctor when he stands up and says no. With the health secretary stating “we take the very best advice, from the people who are vaccine experts”. If they don’t care about their opinions why are they asking?   Yes, I can understand why a vaccine expert would be pro vaccine. Duh.   I quit my career in healthcare due to the mandates because I had to. The medical staff they have lost due to mandates is why the health care workers are so tired, because they are short on staff more than ever before.   Where I live, our hospital has always been over capacity. These last two years is probably the first time in a very long time where code burgundy wasn’t called daily. They were announcing a new hospital weeks before covid hit.   People seem to forget that.
They want the NHS to fail it will be gone on thext 3 years
They're medical people, guessing they know what they're talking about. How to brainwash an entire nation by making them believe that the vaccine is the best thing since sliced bread......maybe it isn't?
Depressing that a doctor doesn't understand how the immune system works fully. He's not a vaccine expert.
I wonder if he is still working ??
Doctors a hero 💪🔥🙏
health secretary is a brainwashed idiot using fear to keep that money train rolling
The calmness and composure of this man clearly detailing factual information just eradicates all nonsensical fear mongering these politicians have to say. Its brilliant to see common sense clearly prevails among the general population.
A man with the courage of his convictions. I’ll thank him for his views when he serves me my burger at McDs
Health secretary u are getting advice from money hungry evil advisors like faucu n his croonies who know jack..shameless n sad
that medic is an idiot
I love this Dr...
Health secretary u are just a puppet
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Bravo to this brave dr
They didn't expect this fantastic doctor to come in from the side did they brilliant
Give the doctor a medal.  I assume the vaccine "experts" Javid is referring to are also the ones selling it.
Well, I trust this doctor not the politician with medical advice. He shouldn't get the vaccine if he doesn't want too, it's his body and not the governments.
Fortunately, they can’t sack the doctor since the face was covered, and we can’t be sure if he was an imposter or not.
Absolute RESPECT to this doctor for saying what we all REALLY  know! But yet still most seem to want to close their ears to the reality. #YourChoice
I would Support a strike by the nhs staff.
So now the WHO have openly stated that the continual boosting of vaccinated people with the same short term effective jabs is unsustainable and ineffective - so This doctor was 100% right. So what will the authorities do with that new piece of advice from the WHO ?
Even the pause from the staff when he first asked the question tells it all
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
It’s fair to say there are too many so called “decisions/regulations based on science” without much scientific debate and data analysis.
It’s fair to say there are too many so called “decisions/regulations based on science” without much scientific debate and data analysis.
Good luck in your new job. On the bright side, the hours probably won’t be as harsh…
If this man disappears... we all know why
They doing this to privatisation
That was extremely moving for me. That must have took courage to talk about such a divisive topic, especially on camera.  I hope others find courage to stand up for themselves in the same manner instead of giving in by the bullies around them
This jab is aids bruh it literally destroys your immune system.
"but we take the best advice that we can from the people that are vaccine experts"
F your jab
Is the general population being distracted by pure theatre, while the government ruthlessly administers poison, through pharmaceutical bureaucrats, who are doing such a remarkable job that soon none of us will be well....
Quite right.. This doctor is top drawer...
A lot of virologists are on the side of this doctor, as am I!!!
This doctor is amazing! We need more doctors who are this brave and actually know how to think for themselves!
Vaccine lol bullshit much
I will 100 percent believe the doctor ,he's on frontline and sees it every day ,Sajid hasn't a clue
Finally a doctor with the balls to tell the truth
I thought I was a being illiterate for not being vaccinated, I'm not a health expert but I had similar kind of views and do not trust the vaccine 100%. They are forcing it right now in our country & might get into a serious scuffle at check posts.
I am glad that this gentleman spoke up for what he believes, especially on TV and in front of the health secretary. Furthermore, I can see the merits of his opinion regarding vaccination against Omicron.   However, while his choice not to get vaccinated at the start of the pandemic may have been beneficial to him, his absence from work (I assume) while he had COVID certainly contributed to a significant staff shortage in London hospitals and had a negative impact on countless ill people. This shows how there are some solid arguments for vaccine mandates.   Vaccination is becoming increasingly unimportant with Omicron, but this medical professional has still put others’ lives in danger by not vaccinating himself when he was first instructed.
NOVAK DJOKOVIC ❤️
What a legend
Even the WHO are saying boosters every 6 months isnt a good idea. Can't be great for your immune system either, and of course covid mutates so often the vaccine is out of date.
He knows enough to be so strong on his stance.
That guy's got some dodgy clinic in London charging people big money for quackery.
A congratulations this doctor for the courage to stand by his convictions, and have an intelligent reason for doing so. I think its very telling the MP comes back with a line they've used from the very beginning " that they rely on the experts advice". Unfortunately they seem to do this only when it suits them. I also thought that it was a bit patronising that the MP more or less said, I respect what your saying but I'd rather listen to people who know what they're talking about. Rather disrespectful
Should be fired
The silence and lack of comments from the other doctors and nurses around him says so much.
An anesthetist. Not a virologist. Not an epidemiologist. Might as well be a hairdresser for all he knows about vaccines.
Iv had two jabs and guess what I’m in isolation with covid so if they say everyone must get the booster not a chance it’s just stupid now especially when boris makes the laws then don’t follow them grr he needs to go
Watch the GMB interview to see the other side of this argument. Sajid Javid doesn't really know much about the topic.
Cause he’s a smart man
Amazing how Javid has absolutely nothing to contribute in this conversation. Kudos to the doctor for standing up to this bs.
So the health secretary telling this guy “that’s your view” is a poor attempt at “fat shaming”. Your choice and Your rights are now being communicated as your view. When this health secretary gets sick I wonder will his “view” be scrutinized?
Simple as we do not need to take this we are made to fight little flus
An Eyes wide Shut journalist
The Dr. has been fired after this video was aired they said he was talking to demons
I don't understand. If getting vaccinated is the same as getting covid19, then wouldn't it be better to get the protection by vaccination, without the risk of getting seriously ill?
Top man end of
Honestly, if more than 80/90% of the population in a country has taken the vaccine, they're safe, right? The infection rates should be very low. And the people needing hospitalization as well. Why is it necessary to make everyone take it?
Legend . Fair play
Well done doctor! We all have right to choose!!! Stay strong.Open debate are needed in the whole Word!!!
So they take their consideration from vaccine lobbyists lol.. not vaccine experts.
MP: "we take the very best advice we can"... Except when it is advice that contradicts our narrative and makes us look stupid.
“From the people who are vaccine experts” 😂😂😂
MP: "we take the very best advice we can"... While he ignores excellent advice being given there and then!
Stand Up! The whole thing is crazy!Greetings from Sweden!
Well done, a doctor with some common sense and moral fiber to stand up!
The vaccine experts AKA the people set to profit most off of it.
These politicians are simply vaccine hustlers
Just check out how many celebrities and athlets have died suddenly “with no cause of death known” in the last few weeks.
I love how the former banker is trying to debate with a doctor about the vaccine......
Doctor💪
The problem is the vaccine experts work at the vaccine companies
Watch the follow up video from GMTV where that doctor states that because he's young and fit he won't get #covid19? Seriously? #Covid19 is not choosy, it's killing people of all ages and fitness. For a senior member of the NHS to say this is abhorrent.
In Spain now we have  Covid chewing gum....Atención, this is not a joke.
I wonder if that "brave" doctor tells every new patient he come up to that he has not been vaccinated. I bet he does not. So he wants his own way and cares nothing of anyone elses. I would not want him anywhere near me but would have no choice. They should wear badges or something so that the public they serve is aware.
NEVER trust and expert or an MP! Lol...🤣🙋‍♀️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
The vacsin experts have been pretty wrong the last 2 years......but hoe is to blame !?
I love this doctor ⭐🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿. So so brave 🙏🏻
If there was ever a shining example of Truth to Power-- that was it.
The evidence is rightly against what this consultant is saying. And for him to work unvaccinated is grossly unprofessional and dangerous. Thousands of people are dying of #Covid. We all need to protect ourselves.
Yes ! It's about time doctors start to stand up  and open conversation regarding this topic !
Should lose ya job then
Dr Steve James may have just ended his career. Good on him for speaking up.
Respect to this Big Balls Doctor !
Well done a brave doctor
Clown!
Never seen so many likes
It is not a "jab".. It is a medical experiment that is extremely profitable. This madness has to end NOW!!
" Thats Your Views " to a medical doctor on a intensive care unit who works the floor and clearly has knowledge sorry mr MP who sits in a office being told what to say by another person who sits in a office YOUR ALL DODGY B"STeRDS
Courage
"We take the very best advice that we can". Then ignore it if it doesn't suit our plan.
Bravo... I'm stuck in EU because of COVID PCR tests. Been through it last few weeks. Not been vaxed. I have been alright ☺️ and now cannot go back to UK cause of false positive PCR test and I need to spend loads for ferries due to rebooking and also tests themselves are 80£ a go. Also I have to provide PCR test solely all the other tests are not accepted by ferry company and I drive so honestly it would be easier now to go to Calais beach, grab a rubber dingy and get through the channel that way cause for those guys there's no testing required nor even Engilsh language... What a time to be alive...
One is thinking, and the other is just saving his a#s, and that's a problem. We are not getting the best advise . The only thing we can do is take logical approach to what we do know. Vaccinating monthly is not sustainable. it's even dangerous.  Cuba has developed a vaccine that protects from all variants for life. That's the best advice available. But, that would be to admit that brown people are smarter. That's the actual problem.
What is the name of this man? I want to personally thank him.
It is quite amusing to listen in on a conversation between the real-deal medical professional and someone who has become a politician.
Getting infected once with covid does not make u permanently immune to covid. He rather get covid every few month rather than get a vaccination? It’s quite clear from data that almost everyone that is dying from covid did not have the vaccination.
Vaccine experts 😂
Looks like the nurses fear losing their job if they answer honestly. It's sad
The doctor has a point, but the braincells of these sheeps in the comment section will be the most american it gets
Move to Ireland
Absolutely brill well said! Yyaasssssss💪💪
Based doctor
Listen to the Doctor's they are dealing with this problem not the bureaucracy.  Health Minister listen please.
Hero ✊
Surprised they let it air... Dont normally show an honest opinion when it doesnt meet there agenda.
I salute this nurse or doctor from standing up and speaking out about his decision.  If health professionals are willing to take that risk to expose themselves I believe we should just let them, perhaps they are proving a point to a lot of people that they are equipped with the proper immunity.
So ask this asshole what the answer is ffs.
Massive respect to this Dr for speaking his truth.  We need more people like him.
Resign Javid
SILENCE SPEAKS SOOOO LOUDLY!!!!AMERICA SPEAK UP or FREEDOM WILL BE TAKEN like 2020 election.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE IDIOTS sorry ARE WE NO LONGER LISTENING TO OUR PHYSICIANS???? Are we listening to a senile person in office illegally and his appointees??? AMERICA WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!!
Souch a bravery and scrutiny of this doctor BRAVO 👏👏👏
That doctor has great courage! May God bless him for speaking up against that liar. Imagine loosing your job because of that piece of crap!
Good doctor!  Finally someone with some sense.
Bureaucrats don't believe in science, hence NO ANSWER TO NATURAL IMMUNITY
Love this Man, more of the same please people.
Then he must lose his pay and job.
Consultant anaesthetist is a honest person. Bald head is a  sycophantic lemming.  We are lucky that honest medical people are willing to stand up to provide an alternative opinion on vaccine and the mandate.
He knows the truth that's why  https://youtu.be/ihjNDf32_Ac
At least someone standing up for his rights and his body.  And to travel to Aussie, do i have to get a covid passport?  Because i am never going to get a jab. Its terrible.
Mummy tussi kaddi sochiya si vi assi etheh HONGAI
Wow it’s your opinion Yes and I’m a doctor
Respect for this doctor 👏👏👏
Takes great courage to speak up! Time to reconsider!
I've watched experts talking from the other perspective, saying NHS staff should be vaccinated, but Thier reasons are completely contradictory. They make themselves look like idiots.
Honorable man right there!  100 percent!
I hope this is legit but this is most likely staged
Frack kings colleg hospital and they statemant they bulshiting and they will pay for that.
Agreed
This guy talks sense
This Doctor deserves a medal.
Imagine listening to a guy with zero hair on his head about what to do to your own genes. Thats a good one.
Why the lady’s nurses scared or won’t spikes out the reality off these ?
My brother is a scientist and he won't have it and had to leave his amazing job he's been doing all his life.
One should really learn how to humble oneself when in the presence of surgeons, anaesthetists and other clinicians who know what they’re talking about! They keep hospitals running. They save lives - NOT morons gliding in with a Prince II qualification in project management or anyone else.
Hmm 🤔 should I believe a doctor or a politician? And his response is a typical political response.
good man
I have had covid... it felt like not sleeping an entire night or hangoverish... that was about it... but the woman I live with had more like influenza-like symptoms.
No debate his colleagues agree they just have no backbones. Pathetic
We know the true views,  Javids predecessor NOT ONLY VIOLATED SOCIAL DISTANCING BUT ACCIDENTALLY WAS SLIPPING HIS PENIS IN HIS SECRETARY BEHIND HER BACK, hardly a family member,
Notice the administrator moving into direct vision of doc.......thank youbfor speaking out for so many giving them the courage to challenge the untrustworthy
The Dr telling him and he knows what the Dr saying because he knows
Not that good of experts then
Hats off to this Dr!!👏👏 🙏🙏❤❤
They forget in number 10 it's not just them who knows what's up with vaccines even the public kniws
These nurse were petrified  and UK people understand it big time pushing UK for boosters for 6 to 8 weeks protection before Christmas was a shock tactic
Fire this man and keep him out of the medical field please.
Just leave the jib because feel so strongly then it will crash
Sky please follow up on this Doctor, the public need know if he loses his job.
Strange how people who claim to follow the science, go to great lengths to ignore natural immunity.
Well Drs staff need to be test every month then
Brain etc etc
The staff knows the the repercussions if the vacine in later in stages
The group’s awkward silence at the beginning says all i need to hear Much respect to that doctor, hope he doesn’t lose his job.
The vacine experts don't work in the ground toooooo
The Dr was looking at his staff to back him shame on them nurses when the Dr stood up like he did for them
"We take the best advice we can.... from vaccine experts"  No your advice goes against our plans *CENSORED*... Next!
He's spoke upon the people if UK here the dr
It's the other way round it's the anti body's needs
This should be share all over the wirkd
Listen to the ones who work with it not vacune experts
😇I do have a immune system, it works fine, already for 64 years, I eat good, sleep well and exercise regular. My body is my best friend, I listen to it and care for it. I try to avoid medication and vaccination as my body only likes what is natural to the body, I try to avoid STRESS, like fear, guilt, worry and anger, and try to avoid information from a dumb and mindless government.
His own funrual there
VAERS DATA ANALYSIS https://youtu.be/Y4MViwU3XOo
Go back with your tail there to doing street the people know it's not working goid
I am proudly unvaccinated and will never get the vaccine. More people need to be proud of being unvaccinated like this man is.
Well the experts know this to loo then
Scaring people in to booster before Christmas to blanket vuruis
Dose not take a scientist to know this even the person in the street knows this
Brave man..... Give him a beer!
Why ask a question then get mad when the answer doesn't align with your views? I'm glad it was aired but that's not news that's the reporter bringing personal feelings to the workplace.
Give it 12 months and therll be another video saying he died of covid. If doctors arent willing to take the vaccine to protect their patients then they should be sacked as they have a duty of care. He may well be fit and healthy but that doesnt mean hes not a carrier. He only has to pass it to a vulnerable elderly patient and they will die... people are being stupid because the gov give no real guidance. I follow worldwide news because uk news is bs
Respect dr
They better not dismiss any n h s staff the people will go berserk
The worst government in modern UK history
They've know this all along just covers for a few weeks but they don't understand UK people getting to know this
Boooomm
No medics are professionals toooooooooooooooooo UK people know vaccines not working big time that's why we angry with government even mire
The doctor putting patients  at risk doctors work him and nurses what if get covid gets ill  he not be treated his fault rather have the vaccine protection  than not
Good for him. Courage, Merry.
It's only covering for weeks thank God for this Dr for the UK people information  this is what the UK know know and angry with ? ? ?
NOW its ok to let omicron "vaccinate" people, but before it was right to vaccinate because it was more dangerous and it saved lives. I dont understand how people are against saving lives, their own included. I know its OTT now, and kinda a weak virus anyway, but it was potentially severe, and it was killing, spreading etc .
I believe people who don't want to be vaccinated shouldn't get vaccinated  BUT those are the ones who go to the hospitals, to the same places where they say they don't trust. It's not rational, is it?.
I think this appears to be a set up.
This is the reason i gave up on my dream of becoming a medical doctor and started pursuing programming. I don't want to get in this situation. Sad world we live in.
This guy is a saint
I am a Nurse and I am not taking the booster, my country says we need to get the vaccine every 4 months and I thought the same thing, what is the point! It clearly not a good vaccine and getting a vaccine every couple of months is not sustainable. It is not very healthy for my immune system to be constantly reacting to the spike protein and therefore, settings off immune responses each time. That is NOT sustainable!!
Good lad.
"the science isn't strong enough" "that is your view" WTF that was passive aggressive.
The silent of fear to say the truth
Kuddos for this brave doctor. Although, I always question myself why is msm showing something. There’s always an agenda behind it.
I respect that but going to ignore it.
👍👏🙏 what a brave Dr.❤️❤️❤️
They take a very best advice...from Pfizer,  Moderna,  etc... How much the advice c😉st ??
In other words "we don't need your common sense shut up!"
This doctor is talking out his arse, an anesthesiologist doesn't know anything about vaccines or the effects of covid. Dr Mike would be ashamed of sharing the title of doctor with this clown.
Don't force people if they don't want to be vaccinated. Including professionals. 🙏🙏
That’s your view.. of the facts… which are the same from any angle..
00:02 curb your enthusiasm
Incredible FairPlay to the doctor. Javid is clueless unqualified and looked absolutely lost in this exchange
People listen without hearing.. Doesn't seem to matter how reasoned and logical the argument, just follow the national (idiotic, irrational) guidelines.. A brave and genuine doctor.. Good on that man..
My question is how do we got more covid cases and deaths after the vaccine than we had before the vaccine???
He's probably now been suspended or sacked. Stay true.
And many vaccine experts are say don't do it.
The latest survey by the Indonesian government shows About 73% of those surveyed have never been vaccinated against COVID-19 There is no relevant diagnosis record  About 86% of Indonesians have antibodies to the new coronavirus This is equivalent to nearly 9 out of 10 people who are positive for antibodies...  This survey is closer to the truth always know About 20% of the population in each country or region has poor physical fitness 80% of healthy people do not need vaccines at all...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ik6cxFBbBw&t=447s  Interview with Dr Steve James
Can somebody explain how these people hold these positions without having a career in the field before hand?  The guy had a career in banking and economics but somehow he's the Health Secretary 🧐
The doctor is wrong, sorry. His protection from having had COVID is 26x BETTER than the vaccine. Not even close to ballpark equivalent. The doctor's protection also DOES NOT WANE like vaccine protection. Who are these "vaccine experts" the government is taking advice from? I bet I can guess: the "experts" on these vaccines are Pfizer, Moderna, Astrazenica. I'm sure those guys want to sell less vaccines.... 🤦🏿‍♂️
I thought the NHS was under pressure from staffing shortage? I thought the lockdowns were so we could get more NHS resources? But we are willing to fire NHS staff?
God bless this doctor! Truth! 👍
He's a hero!!
Its because he had corona, therefore he got his „natural“ vaccine. So makes sense that he doesnt want a vaccine.
WHO.  Repeated Covid boosters not viable strategy against new variants, WHO experts warn. vaccination strategy based on repeated booster doses of the original vaccine composition is unlikely to be appropriate or sustainable,” the WHO Technical Advisory Group on Covid-19 Vaccine Composition (TAG-Co-VAC) said in a statement published on Tuesday.The group of experts, who are working to assess the performance of Covid-19 vaccines, called for the development of new vaccines.
Last month javid said this mandate would be unethical!!  Well done Dr James!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sajid “do as I say “ javid . Landed himself in a hole by hearing the truth.
Brian McConnell won’t be happy with this doc
Fact: countless politicians get infected with covid although fully vaccinated/incl boosters.
It seems that doctor knows something we don't know about that vaccine????????
What a legend!! 💯💯💯💯
wrongthink
"That's your view." In one ear and out the other. Those incapable of listening to reason have no business having power over anyone but themselves.
I am loving this doctor, he is a doctor and he can think.
If this goes through then it will be the final nail in the coffin for the nhs,people might want to start thinking about that before condemning these people,the people we were all out clapping last year!
Pity the experts are idiots
This doc is an absolute champ.
Sajid Javid  vile man
Don’t get it!!!   Survival of the smartest. 😂 We need less people in the world like this.
I like that he admits there is some but not enough benifits to the vaccine.  His statement doesnt explain why he doesn't want to vaccine though.  It looks like a political/media stunt to me.
VIVA LA REVOLUTION !!!!!!!!!
What there's no debating is fully vaccinated are still getting sick and spreading it too.
Hero!
This guy should be the health secretary
Idiot
Hi I'd like to add french subtitles how can I do it ? It'd be to interesting to share it to my French friends who agree with their president annd say they want to "piss off" the unvaccinated..
Show me a trustworthy politician and I’ll get the jab
The government, who have broken all the restrictions with their party, will try their best to keep their jobs, YET, this same government, will sack this consultant anaesthetist, who has been working in Covid I.C.U. since the start of the pandemic, for not being vaccinated. SHAME on the government. We need men like this doctor in government - not total idiots like Savid Javid.
I’ve been in care for 8 years, risked it during the whole pandemic. I’ve never had Covid, other employees most everyone have been vaccinated and are still off sick with Covid! Is this the thanks we get? Have the vaccine or lose your job? I’ll be leaving the industry in April, I hope everyone else continue to stand up for what is right.
Maybe, and this is a long shot: health-related roles in government ought to require a medical background? This man is out of his depth.
They want to destroy the heathy sponge of society,,  already dismissing what has kept us alive for thousands of   years ...        Following vaccines experts ? Who don't share the general opinion of most doctors ?  Wow ,, this is crazy 🤪  and very scary 😨
Hope this doctor stays strong and tells them where to stick their poison vaccine
This is also why Americans needs to be more financially independent. These women didn't speak for fear of losing their jobs. I will not be forced to take a vaccine that I believe isn't needed for my body.
A Dr 's view ?   What the hell ?  That idiot is not convinced of antibodies ?  Not a human !
I'm with this Doctor and support him 100%. I'm not against it, I just strongly believe that there's no way to stop the flu from mutating. We as humans will beat this thing over time...not with a vaccine that has to be "taken twice with boosters," or take both Moderna, phizer, and whatever else is avail all at once to be "fully protected." I'll trust my own immune system and mother nature to do what it does.
Amazing howany people dont trust the government but they completely trust SKY NEWS. Amazing.
Who is the guy in the button shirt and glasses standing behind Javid giving the anesthetist a death stare?
I had Covid. I got vaccinated. Big deal.
That doctor charges £500 a day at a breathlessness clinic 👍 ironic.
Great doc!!!
Covid the only disease with so many variants coming out one after the other. By the end of the mellinia.. Well all be able to learn Greek alphabets
Lmao that's your view not a fact wow
Then get him infected with the virus itself and if he survives then no problem with him
the doctor who is fired could be the guy saving your life one day
I feel sorry for the doctor speaking out in the NHS... In my experience, they'll make his career/life hell for embarrassing the NHS by having a novel thought in his head. I hope I'm wrong and his opinion is respected and not used as punishment.
What a laugh, so dismissive of the person that works in the medical profession rather than just being a blood sucking worm
Hat off to this Doctor
At this point all governments will need to see their decisions through.. they can't say they are wrong or that they overstepped or that they in anyway made mistakes... They would lose all credibility.
Finally some doctor made sense
We have the evidence now the shot is not for everybody
No mandates period! Especially since thousands of FULLY vaccinated healthcare workers are testing positive for Covid!!!!????There is a massive staffing shortage. Now hospitals are so desperate that they are putting Covid POSITIVE nurses and doctors back on the floor to cover shifts!!!!!!!
A guy who knows nothing, takes advises from experts that stay in their labs, and do not listen someone that is at the front line... nice... For the doctor, who had the balls, RESPECT!
So why did carers get jabbed we was told if they don't we can't work in care...we are all key workers rules should all be the same
I fully support this doctor
I lost my job in Australia due to this.
Total respect for this man. Stick by your guns sir.
"We get our knowledge...from the vaccine experts" -UK health minister speaking with hospital doctor. That says it right there, the vaccine guys told us the vaccine is good. Seriously? C'mon man!
He's not wrong his argument is basically if the vaccine or the booster won't protect me indefinitely what's the point of getting it just once? The immune cells his body naturally built are the equivalent if not stronger than any vax or booster. But if he doesn't get it he potentially will be unemployed... America everyone
why ask his views to immediately disregard him by saying 'thats your view'.
Another words doc. He doesn’t care what your stance/opinion is no matter how fact based it is and they will continue to ouch the lies on everyone
If it isn't mandatory then he has no case to answer.  This is a case of "news" not being news?  Waste of airtime.
Stand strong
Support Legislation in NJ and NY to BAN COURT ORDERED RAPE..
My life is in God's hands....... plus, I'm pretty pickled from the whiskey!
This doctor was found face down in a ditch the next day.
So much respect for this doctor! There is curerently a shortage of mental health nurses and my university is telling us that we'll get kicked off the course if we aren't jabbed. I've personally had covid, why isn't it a choice for health care workers? Can't stand this government
Did this reporter just try to gaslight an anesthesiologist…? Wow.
Save this man….respect for standing up and speaking up. Btw it’s not a view it’s science……buts it’s very convenient to ignore it when it suits a narrative
Good job doctor
Courage.
Keep standing up! Do not comply! Stay strong friends! ❤️ from some unvaccinated girl in Austin Texas
Liberandus everywhere 😂
he said it "the science isn't strong enough"
When a politician thinks they know better than an expert.
This doctor is amazing!
Imagine having a Health Secretary who studied economics and politics, worked at Deutsche Bank and Chase Manhattan, knows literally 0 about health.  Also for the past 10 years Id like to see his taxes and financial statements, he left a cushy job that paid 7 million a year to work for the government? Yeah nah. He is getting paid big time from external interests. No doubt in my mind whatsoever.
The Health Secretary is a crook. He takes advice from Pfizer and the people who fund him. He is a public servant. Serving the public, yet he acts like an abysmal piece of sh*t who only takes orders from the people (big pharma  corporate interests) who put him there. He isnt taking anything this doctor is saying seriously, he is being 100% dismissive.
A politician (with zero medical experience whatsoever) telling a doctor what’s best medically?! 🤔
In my small Queensland town hospital the respiratory specialist was sacked for refusing to be vaccinated, he had previously emergency treated two vaccine injured. Now the emergencies don't have the specialist to treat them.
Gotta love the news man discrediting a doctor and everyone there is scared to speak up
My biggest regret is I took the vaccine in the NYPD session itself. I am a candidate and warned not being hired if didn't take it then I took it because only 3 of us in bunch of candidates who didn't took it.. Now I didn't continue my candidacy once again because I fuckin hate this world's tyranny. NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS REAL ANYMORE
He just totally dismissed this mans opinion, after trying to pry one out of 4 other workers who were hesitant to even say a single word.
“The Science is not strong enough”
Maybe Conservative want a walk out and a callaspe and destabilise the NHS it pave their away into privatising it which has been in their plan for a while.
I wonder how many students will line up to spending years and years studying to be a doctor or a nurse only to go into an institute nhs that will ask them to give up the rights to their own body. If I was a student I'll be running from that profession.
Why was my comment deleted?
What a dumb physician.
Natural immunity wears off ? This guy huh!?
I wish they would stop calling this a Covid vaccine when it is not a vaccine  The so-called vaccine is a preventive treatment with no guarantees and is not a vaccine under the true meaning of the word  The medical definition of a vaccine is that it gives a guaranteed immunity with no ongoing treatment     The biggest dereliction of duty of care is in the governments' duty to educate its people in the taking of a higher level of vitamin D supplement in pill form or diet form food such as Sardines or Cod Liver especially in an epidemic situation  Education not domination is the compassionate way and unfortunately, most governments only understand domination
FROM THE PEOPLE THAT ARE VACCINE EXPERTS.... LOOOOOOOOOOL nearly spilled my drink after hearing that
Have no fear. There will be other jobs for the people who refuse the poison. Better jobs that will actually be fulfilling instead of working for an industry that kills the most people on the planet. Kudos to him
What a nerve on that politician to tell the Dr that “we take advice for the vaccine experts” what a stupid and ignorant thing to say, smell like corruption..
Kudos to this Doctor 👍🏻
NHS hospitals usually have a media team and their job is to speak to the press so I’m surprised that this doctor got to voice his honest opinion publicly on camera to the health secretary! Brave doctor though and he was very articulate and knew what he was talking about and explained it very well.
Lol   Politicians are pure  dumbshits
He was clearly not alone, it looked like all the female nurses felt the same way but feared speaking out when asked the question.
Science is based on world views, similar to the shape of earth
And, by the good doctor's own logic, his immunity from natural infection will likewise wane within a similar timeframe. So, what are we supposed to do? Just throw up are hands at the whole situation? Who's to say that the government aren't going to continue boosting as necessary? That's a fool hardy position to make, let alone believe.
The jab up yours! Good job Doctor 👏 👍
It is incredibly important to listen and understand what was said. It's not an anti vaxxer conspiracy, it's logic and reason.
What a lovely brave doctor for standing up for the truth. This is the epitome of a real man, one that has the BALLS, to speak the authentic truth knowing there's a possibility he could lose his job for stating the facts  Would the doctor not know best?  A trained medical specialist?  I'm listening to doc not that  sickly looking guy that's trying to covertly challenge the articulate doctor.    My question would be has all members of the House of Commons had their vaccinations or up-to-date with them? Especially this MP whose advocating it.  Can we request these details about MPs under the Freedom of information act 2000 because these are things we need to be looking into to see if these MPs are as genuine as they make out.    Since MPs advocate so much for these vaccines it should be mandatory and compulsory for every MP in the country to prove to the British public that they are up to date with their vaccinations.  Did anyone notice how rude that MP was to the doctor just watch his tone and attitude towards the doctor response the MP clearly, was not impressed with the doctors response and then was impertinent enough to say to the medical specialist, that this is his view and opinion.  How rude! the doctor makes valid points,  We don't have the resources to vaccinate people every month so what's the next solution? especially when so many hold the same view as the doctor.
That doctor is absolutely correct and the other doctors need to stop being censored from the internet! Natural immunity.
So courageous to stand your ground and state it calmly, rationally and straight forward. It's interesting how dismissive the other guy came across.
These people have no real answers and say they are following experts that are wrong every turn wake up people
Vaccines are NOT Safe or Effective.
This is a pandemic of the morbidly obese, the aged and the infirm. Make them get the vaccine. And let us get on with our lives
We take advice from those that profit from our ignorance and stupidity. This Dr is a hero. The other guy just doing what he is told.
He is spreading false information.
They don't want to hear the truth!
Did the secretary just say "We'll take advice from the people that are obviously experts"??  He was condescending!
Vaccines experts are there to sell vaccines and make money. Not to tell the truth.
what an utter disgrace the way the media shames this Doctor, who just stands up for what he believes. the mainstream propaganda can go to hll....
With coming more new variants it's clear that the efficiency of every vaccine is decreasing day by day which means they will have have to work on new strong vaccine which they will announce like adds, oh come get vaccinated.
that man has balls of steel in todays world….God bless him.    How smug of that reporter who said we take our advice from vacine experts
The most courageous act is still to think for yourself... *Aloud!*
Is it the very best advice from experts or is it advice from an  echo chamber?  Clearly, from what I can tell, the other sides argument is being censored.
Well done Sir. Vaccination of the immune person is pointless as the risk of severe disease is absolutely minimal whereas the administration of mRNA vaccines is not without risk and does not stop viral spread. Use the vaccine for the covid virus naive and exercise some common sense Mr Health Minister.
The CEO of Pfizer said that there is almost no protection gained by taking the first 2 jabs - encouraging 🤔
Javid is a bully plain and simple. That we tolerate charlatans like him is a stain on how far we’ve fallen as a society.
Ohhh love the dr standing up! And carrying on standing up!
Take the best advice,  from the people who are vaccine experts.    Coming from a health secretary with ZERO clinical experience or qualifications for his brief.  Shut up Javid.
I want my Doctors to be like that man. Utterly disgusting the way that minister reacted to him.
His honest answer would be but if we don't push the boosters we won't make trillions in profit and I won't get my under the table kick backs 💰💰💰
Legend needs more to stand up to these draconian rules from these psychos
This is Socialism; we have to weigh the social care (aka: we will do what we want in the name of the greater good. Because our “experts” [who is anyone we say are experts] know better than the people).
Glad to see so few virtue signallers in the comments. This only highlights the incompetence of government officials vs. the rational of the actual professionals on the front lines. Keep on keeping on.
Just calling it a "jab," shows it to be supercilious.
69 thousand likes is insane
Who is the Moran interview guy?
I had Covid a year ago and have not gotten vaccines, I’ve been around several positive people and have not gotten reinfected.
NO MANDATES
Where's he getting these figures from? Literally no one is saying that protection drops that fast from the vaccine
Love real scientific sense.
Sajid javed telling a fully qualified doctor about his field, wtf!!!!
"From the vaccine experts" they are very keen to mention that there are some people who really knows about vaccines...yet nobody mention about immune system anymore...they only worry about selling their poison...well done mate, the other ones are f.. scared to say it... I'm not sure how long they wear those mask as I can see they struggling to speak with the masks on...they don't have experience...that shows they don't really wear mask usually, only in front of the camera...
In summary:  Unvaccinated - can catch the virus and spread it.  Vaccinated - can, apparently, still catch the virus and spread it.  But we'll punish the unvaccinated, because... HEALTH!!  This is not about 'health'...
That was all about "appearing to do something" that doc pointed out his lie and he said social aspects have to be considered. Nothing to do with medicine. Wake up people.
Why have Sky placed that silly statement at the end of the video🤔😂
"Vaccine experts " in other words sales reps from the drug companies.
He implied that this medical doctor does not have the expertise to understand vaccine and booster efficacy?
This dude got balls cheers from the USA🇺🇸
Its sad people think the unvaccinated are a big disease.  It should never have ended up like this
Good lad
Javid hasn't a clue. He is doubting the words of a doctor that understands that staff will have to take "boosters" every month to remain legal. How can Javid have more knowledge than this doctor? He isn't a doctor himself, he is a dubious character that may soon be in the driving seat. Then we're fucked.
Dub
Covid vaccinations are wrong
LOL this is hullarious- the dynamic between these two chaps
"We take advice from the vaccine experts".  And by that he means Bill Gates and George Soros.
Javid: "we take the best advice we can "  Fcking halfwit is hearing it from an eminent doctor who knows his stuff. The poor Nurses all looking round at each other because they Dare not say what they think for fear of loosing their jobs.  Its time to get rid of these idiots in power. they do not know their arse from their elbows and are not fit for purpose.
Can’t stand the torries but I also think this is reckless behaviour from a trusted doctor, the vaccine is working, why belittle it, we will never get out of this mess if we don’t use the tools available to us
They all look like they’re in jail 😂
They are going to keep losing health care staff. Even before the virus the staffing was not good. So make a ruff situation worse. Not too bright
The FDA did not pass the @vaccines” for safety.  The vaccines are not preventing Covid.  They are not preventing people who backed from spreading it.
Speaking truth to power.
Love that from this guy. Tell him straight
And he doesn't GAF 😂
I’m a student working in the NHS whilst on placement, it’s a complete joke that my university is FORCING me to get the vaccines otherwise if I don’t comply, I will not be able to continue on the course.
Stand up for yourself and all others without your voice!
Look up.  Redemption drawer nigh.  This world is ending.  Submit your life to God
I would trust this doctor over any corrupt and lying  politician - and who is this  uneducated politician to try and dismiss this articulate, educated doctor in his own field of medicine- the government are an absolute disgrace.- and sajid would need help opening s box of plasters!
BRAVEEEE
The BALLS on this Doctor. Absolute respect. I'd sooner trust the doctor over a politician who turned a blind eye to certain "incidents" because they might cause.......outrage? shall we say.   And the Doc is absolutely right, they will have the antibodies from covid to this day, Sajid is a prat.
We need more like him to speak out, true heroes!
Hold the line!!
Well done matt for standing up to these so called experts 👏
Atlast one doctor is talking sense and is ignored.
He's right and tbh I don't wanna take the booster too
Doc is the real deal.
WTF. The government ministers take the best backhanders from the pharmaceutical companies and also their advice. They know which side their bread is buttered 😉
There are a great deal of calm docile fascist sympathizers out there, and I'm pretty shocked by how many of them are female.
Well said lad
Compelling facts from the brave surgeon…..
Note how he sidesteps the question of natural immunity wearing off as well. He just pretends he doesn't hear it and moves on.  I hope the journalist eventually got him to answer that question and that we can find it posted somewhere. Typical of Sky News to post a clip less than three minutes long on such a controversial announcement.
Nice little dig from the health sec there right at the end
A doctor killing his patients. Nice.
I’m glad people are finally telling the true and facts, mainstream media has been lying to us for too long! Joe Rogan podcasts have exposed the lies and now it’s cool for Sky to jump on the bandwagon.
Awesome doctor
2 things I took away from this. 1 although he is a medical expert he is NOT a specialist in vaccinations so his opinion does not supercede the advice of the government specialist advisers. 2 by his own admission the vaccine does reduce transmission for a period of time.  If the worst case scenario is it wears off after 8bweeks why isn't he taking it to stop the spread for those 8 weeks? His argument makes no sense
Good for him Fu## the jab.
The “vaccine experts” are paid for by Pfizer and Moderna. Natural immunity works
Anyone can just make bold claims and seem brave. I can say that I own 12,000 four legged snakes, so it can be said that snakes are 4 legged animals and anyone that forces people to believe that snakes have no legs are infringing on my rights. Yeah that statement sounds logical, but only to people who don’t know anything about snakes.
Maybe its just me but I found Javids passive aggressive argument at the end very immature. He put the doctor down by saying “We take the advice from the vaccine experts” as if others don’t have the intellectual capacity to form their own opinion because they aren’t experts. This is very obvious with this government, the do as I say rule. No transparency and a lot of corruption
Stop covid propaganda!
The doctor should understand that this country is only doing well in this pandemic as a result of the vaccines.  Or does this doctor want death rates to go up
If he doesn’t want to get mandated to have the vaccine then that’s just his ego getting in the way. If he thinks it’s harmful to be vaccinated then he needs to say why. Otherwise just shut up, put up and get jabbed to get on with life.
Many lies out there.  But that doctor is correct!
I think the most important thing is being able to have an honest, non-toxic discussion about these topics, so props to this news outlet for not framing this interaction in any particular way. Apart from that I don't know what to think about this. I don't even know if I'm generally for or against covid vaccine mandates.  A major aspect I haven't seen discussed anywhere is how the psychology behind people's willingness/unwillingness to get vaccinated right now might effect the pandemic long term. Right now we're only talking about short term effects. This doctor here is saying the vaccines available currently only offer one month of protection (adequate for healthcare staff) against the covid variants most prevalent in his country (delta/ omicron). As someone without medical background I would have liked to see the other guy verify or deny this for clarity's sake but I also understand it might not be that simple and that the data might differ on this. But the real question that comes to mind here: Is that really the deciding factor of whether or not a vaccine mandate is appropriate at this time? When reflecting over the history of this pandemic, I think the most surprising thing was how fast these pharma companies were able to whip up vaccines that were both relatively safe and relatively effective against the original covid variant. I have no doubt these companies could produce similarly well working products for today's trickier variants - they are most definitely working on it right now. But what if we get to that point and _only then_ start talking about vaccine mandates again? It's going to be the same proccess as last year. If people aren't already used to the mandate being a thing they will drag it out as long as they can and by the time the mandate actually gets implemented we will yet again provide time for a completely newly mutated variant that is somewhat resistent to current vaccines to spread, rendering the mandate useless. And here the cycle begins again.  The (simplified) way I see it is that there's only three ways this is gonna go. 1. Either we drop the lockdowns and let covid do it's thing (in a 'survival of the fittest' kind of way) 2. Or we keep up this never ending cycle of lockdown and no lockdown that is detrimental to education, businesses, jobs/ people's livelihoods, and social connections because at this point it looks like this virus will be overstaying its welcome 3. Or we enforce vaccine mandates that make people feel like the government is infringing on their human rights  My personal opinion: I think Nr 1. is highly unethical and should be avoided - both because of the deadly increase in victims (vaccinated and unvaccinated) but also because of the burden this would put on our healthcare workers who were already stressed before the pandemic. So the real question is: How long can we keep going with Nr 2 / how long should we decide to wait and hope things get better on their own until we ultimately choose Nr 3?
the doctor is confident on his antibodies…but what if he has the virus(didnt know) and he went to his grandparents..suddenly got the virus from him…his grandprents has a weak immunity… this doctor is a selfish person..
Your immunity doesn’t disappear after 2 months, it is reduced I believe it’s around 60% and 80% depending on the vaccine, and the development of natural immunity is much more consistent when introduced via vaccine, that’s facts, this “courages” doctor is nit picking facts.
Vaccine experts will always say "get vaccinated......all the time......forever!" 💸
Ouch;;;he didn’t want to hear that did he///
See he know all true
Speak the truth brother👏👏👏👏👏
Doctor should have given Sajid a couple of more jabs up the backside whilst he was there the boldy mongoose
Health Secretary is Corrupt. Guilty! There WILL NOT “always be a debate over it.”
Maybe I'm judging too harshly based on my general experience with consultants but somehow it seems unsurprising that this doctor can't even follow basic infection control procedures about being bare below the elbow, let alone understand the need for a united front on vaccination efforts 🙄
Why didn’t he threaten this doctor.  He theatre’d the public in the briefing.  Cowardly little man.  He has no answers because he’s a liar and doesn’t have a clue what he’s talking about when are people going to ask about heart attacks going up 40%.  And all the other vaccine injuries media do your job.
"Well we take the very best advice we can, from the vaccine experts." I mean, just look at the sheer ignorance and arrogant of this FOOL, a good for nothing "journalist" who doesn't want to even hear out a doctor who's experiencing and giving out vital information. We all know why he's so adamant on asking the female doctors; they're POTENTIALLY more likely to give a politically flattering comment due their nervousness or preference to stay quiet on the subject. This doctor could probably run the country better than that lying, deceiving moron called Boris. Sod your "apologies"!
Reading all the comments here shows me not all have gone stupid.
Luckily for him he can emigrate! Goodbye!
We are fed up with this fraud
I have been waiting to hear this .. ohh gosh this doctor!!!
Great doctor !!
Leave us with your vaccine!It should be optional!
Bravo. More need to take their stand.
in his interview on Good Morning Britain anyone could spot how embarrassingly selfish and statistically dumb this guy is
I'm surprised this stuff is in the news. Well done sky news. Well done this man. This guy is a legend!
Vaccine experts eh? What a load of nonsense.
Question everything.
I’m glad he spoke up..he has some very legitimate points,FYI I’m not an anti vaxxer I’m just an advocate for freedom of choice
"Democracy is hypocrisy" -Malcolm X
We can see clearly that the government has as its agenda, impose the vaccination as if it were our best option. I do regret that I took the double plus the boost. I’ve done it believing that it would get me at least in the position of being able to work normally and be everywhere. Now I don’t trust this government any more, there is too much they are not telling us. Bunch of liars.
Very good I am on your side let's fight this luciferian posterity...if there was truly a pandemic alarm they would not dismiss their medical staff!
Damn right
Guy talking about “vaccine experts” who don’t actually work in a hospital up front with the virus as opposed to a MEDICAL DOCTOR IN THE FIELD. The arrogance.
They take the best advice....from big pharma!!
Good for him
Hasn't got a clue
Well done to the doctor for standing up for what he believe and with facts behind it, shame it was dismissed so casually.  Also made such a valid point about the booster, why is this not being talked about.
I do strongly believe there is no need to get the vaccine if a person has already been exposed to coronavirus and has antibodies I have had covid twice and I don’t see any benefit in taking the vaccine when antibodies are already in the body and vaccine doesn’t last more than 3months what’s the point in that
just for show stupid masks
Crimes against humanity.
The doctor has a valid point and now it just looks like your forcing people to take it or loose their rights to work/earn a living
Heard Aldi has some vacancies. Good luck mate. Hope it’s worth it. Looser
The doctor did a good job in ssyinhvhis point pf view on the vax.
If only more spoke up like him.
they had to put that at the end so they dont get backlash 😂and good on the fella voicing his opinion 👍
We need more people like this to speak up!! I’m thankful for him putting what a lot of us are thinking into words
what an idiot doctor LMAO
Love this
And WHO is the Vaccine expert exactly? The vaccine salesman?!
Sajid javid is a complete knob
Sky, guardian, BBC, your time is up.
I also don't want the jab. I work in a night club with hundreds of people every weekend with no masks or distancing and not me or any of the regulars at the club has even had covid. I've been in close contact 4 times now with family that had covid.. Some which are vaccinated.. and everytime ive tested negative and had zero symptoms.
So when an actual trained doctor states that he shruggs it of with a well that's your opinion?
Is the health secretary a fully trained and licenced doctor because this guy is actually killing me
His body, his choice. Say no more 🤷‍♀️
What a guy.. good on him
Find more people like this we need more coverage of people that don't want to be vaccinated and that doesn't make us anti vax we're just anti coronavirus jabs 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Corruption is the key 🔑
Yesss ! Finally a nhs worker that speaks sense
In my opinion , let doctors not get vaccinated if they want , however them doctors must only work on covid wards since they do not pose an increase risk of giving covid to someone who's not got it , he can also have his antibody immunity regularly topped up by the contact as his own logic requires.
The doctor should let the nurses speak first.
Lies i know a nurse in the nhs who said that if she didnt get vaccinated she would be let go
No cure for bio-variant the billgates weapon. That's why conservatives parties were held because they weren't worried about this pack of big-pharma lies
Legend 😎
legend. down with this madness
What a man!
Ita Javid mă! Te ai facut broker medical mă!?
Health Secretary got NOTHING in response.   Pathetic.
Maybe they will send this Doctor to Australia, we seem to be back on that period of time ...
MVP
The health secretary doesn’t have a clue lol
Good for him
WTF is a "vaccine expert"?
🤟✌👍🖕
Fair play
Can't believe I'm going to say this but...well done Sky News! For actually posting another perspective 👍🏾
And people attack Novak Djokovic who has the same opinion as this young doctor. Double standards or what?
I will wait for non mRna vaccine!
Let's be clear here, the doctor isn't against vaccines. He's opposed to the proposed mandatory vaccination as a response to the current Omicron variant and the efficacy of the vaccine and boosters on long term immunity.  As he clearly states, he doesn't see the proposal as being viable because that would mean monthly boosters for all NHS staff.  The opinion he expressed is far more nuanced than the click-bait headline is implying.
The word ‘expert’ is being thrown around a lot, mostly to indicate someone, in this case a medical professional, is out of their depth, mostly by people who have no medical knowledge other than what they are told is the correct answer.   This video is a metaphor of the herd who are told what to believe and are fearful of thinking for themselves, in this case illustrated by the nurses on the left, versus the minority of people who still dare to think for themselves and comprehend or understand the difference between natural immunity, and immunity provided through these untested vaccinations, (tested now because we were all forced to take them, at the risk of losing jobs etc)
Ngl this guy deserves a promotion for this. Honestly, I feel like some people are worried to speak up just in case they lose their jobs.
It's good to see his bravery in citing the real science versus the bullying and intimidation.
Salute to Dr Steve for speaking Truth and  only Truth , speaking with the lense  of Science rather politics .
He has worked so hard for this VERY MOMENT!! He should be so proud of himself! SHAME ON THIS MORNING SHOW! Literally twisted his words and trying to silence him! MOST PEOPLE WITH BOTH VACCINES HAVE CAUGHT COVID NOW!  Why can’t we all just accept the government don’t have a clue whats going on and start listening to the people who are on the FRONT LINES!!  This man has made my year!!!
Good man
It’s fine if he doesn’t want to take the vaccine, totally up to him. But it’s the people calling this a “brave act of rebelling” or seeing him as a “hero” which is dangerous to people wanting to remain alive.
Brave doctor...hand up for this doctor who stand up for what he thinks is right..
Big up this Doctor telling it as it is.
How shamefully telling it is that the health secretary is ignorant of the correct terminology yet has wit enough to emulate a ten year old by attempting to maintain his air of superiority with the pathetic “vaccine experts” reference . Too stupid to know or too arrogant to care about how embarrassingly out of his depth he reveals himself to be 😐😑
This doctor has got asymptomatic covid 19 and likely transfered to all his sick patients and their family member who transmitted to other members. This is NHS govt health system not his private hospital where he is practicing. Let him practice in private and have a board that he is not vaccinated. The Trojan horse is in the NHS. I would say a consultant is not liable to be holding a permanent position and easily sacked. Remove this person immediately. Example: If someone drives a car and sees a person crossing then the driver will not drive past the person saying legally the person crossing was not following the rules. As a doctor it's his responsibility to keep the society safe. He will die soon of some reason. God will punish the unkind.
All Respect to this Doctor. Bless him🙏🙌
I really don't see the problem tbh. It may be temporary, but It's Better than nothing right?
Well done! Somebody has to start speaking the truth. Bravo!
That's your view... Dismiss your opinion even if it is based on facts...
If they really, really want to encourage vaccine hesitancy they should make them mandatory
Those staff members were terrified to actually say how they really felt. Good on him for speaking his mind and potentially putting his job at risk. They guy clearly wasn’t happy with his answer lol was obviously expecting a bunch of yes “men” 😂
It’s very telling that when the Health Secretary asked these ladies know that receives about five of them isn’t there there’s five of them all standing there is a NHS professionals NHS nurses not one of them answered the question because they were scared because if they answer the question incorrectly that all be fired so that is very very interesting and very very interesting indeed the sky report I did not pick up on
The doctor is not an antivaxer. He is opposing an unnecessary vax mandate. And he knows what he’s talking about unlike the Health Secretary.
The dr got a point....the guy main advisor for the gov'nt does not look like a prof'r amd instead looks like some geezer they picked of the streets....
Would love to buy that man a coffee
If u want vaccine get it if u don’t then don’t why everybody turning on each other
If all medical staff and medical scientists with this opinion would go out of in the same time from the system.... Then the government's will stop paying pharma for nothing. Anyway it does not have an effect anymore. Plus gives SO MANY SIDE EFFECTS!  They listen the vaccine experts! Whom are those? Someone whom seats in a lab only and moves papers or someone whom is doing daily something?
Well done that man! A highly educated health professional - check the science and respect for freedom of choice - vaccine is NOT the only way
Why don't we just realise we are in a country,  who can tell us that we can lose our job unless we do what the government says. Apparently their was one 70 years ago, but in this day and age people are starting to think for themselves, not brainwashed or propaganda?
Le Shill Du Jour
Cool - great point. But why not just get jabbed anyway?
I stand with the doctor!! I have also been in the same position as he is. How dare the government keep carrying on like this
the response of the healthy secretary shows how little this gantelman  knows about covid vaccine and science of  immunity
British doctor Mike?
Young healthy people should have the choice of having or not having the vaccine or boosters.
He got in trouble.. wish they had spoken up for care staff but, only relavent when he has to take it
Sajid Javid is a coward
Doctor doesn’t give a toss about infecting customers.
😂😂😂
Natural immunity is better than any vaccine, always has been. This is all about money and control, nothing more.
Javid getting schooled to kingdom come there
I've been vaccinated, but only when I was traveling back up to college, my parents are vaccinated and get boosters because they are at risk and one is a school teacher. Vaccines are good, but the mandate isn't. People should know where and when to get one so they don't give themselves a false sense of security when it wears off in a month.
That reporter suddenly proclaims "from the people who are VACCINE EXPERTS" at the end with such a tinge of ignorance, and fear, that he moots his own point. It is their own cowardice that exposes them and does not allow for valid points to get foothold in their minds. They sit in their existence of fear and cowardice, ignoring the very facts that they are presented. He was told he needs to boost every month for the "vaxxine" to be effective and he just glosses over it like a mindless drone. Disgusting.
well done to the doctor for speaking the truth!
Well done that man, clever, articulated and standing by his own views. I don't share his view having had the vaccine, but it is a persona choice, it should not be mandated. Sajid Javid had nothing in response to that.
Praise to this Doctor.. stands up and to his beliefs
Glad they're broadcasting the ones that have the courage to speak up against lies.
The nurses just giggling to to each other looking confused and the doctor standing upto sajid the boris bumboy I really can't wait until this party is out of number 10
Javid acting like he knows more than an actual doctor
Build a staue of this man
We take all the advice from the experts thats his answer to all that the doctor his telling him funny how everyone is a total expert on covid and its only been 2 to 3 years of it existence
Just remember the day that none us live in a free country anymore. Wake up everyone
If the virus gets him which it will he should be denied a bed.
He asked thinking they would all be on board,when he found out they weren't he becomes passive aggressive. He tries to switch to asking the nurses none of whom wanted to answer or come to his defence with no I think we should all be vaccinated, so he jumps back to being passive aggressive with the doctor on the front lines lol great work.
Hopefully an ex NHS doctor now.
Well done 👍🏽
The nurses didn’t even want it …
Knob head sajid has no idea about health! He is a bloody banker! His background is in financial banking! Nothing to do with health
That guy straight away “that’s your view” the attitude…
'we take the best advice from our vaccine experts' what u mean the vaccine company in which u hold shares in?
Friends who are nurses, health aides and so on don’t want the vaccine. They would rather quit and look for a job anywhere else that’s not mandated.
Where are the rest of his colleagues?? Why aren't they speaking out? Shame on them. Yellow bellies.
the man with no hair shouldn't discredit an expert's point of view based on another expert's opinion
Dam right
More than 90% of staff are vaccinated yet they’re all off with Covid. What am I missing here
Very brave... Many doctors are scared yet they all know the truth... They just play along with these bullying politicians
They take the best advice from those that work with it on a daily basis, ignore their advice and throw parties! The GALL of the man to step inside a hospital and ask staff about new COVID rules! The rules which could see them lose their jobs! Let's see where the pandemic leads with no Doctors and medical staff!
What a legend of a doctor
Look at the like ratio compared to the similar videos with opposite views than that doctor. They get like 400 likes this had 67 thousand lol wake up people
When an unstoppable force meets an immovable object...
snubbed the Doctor and tried getting opinion from nurses, that is how clever Sajid Javed is, his head is completely empty inside and out.
That minister looked like a fool, well done to the doctor
Then it’s gonna be case of survival of the fitt3st if we play it this way doc. The boosters are necessary to protect people of all ages. We can’t just leave them hanging now.
All staged managed to keep the public guessing !! Wake up gullible public
Good on him people need to start speaking their minds about absolute garbage lies
Ok fine tell me what dose the vaccine has how it is made of dose any one know it please explain???????
Well said brother,big respect 👏
I'll side with the one who's got the medical certificates!
Shameful doc. It’s not about u. It’s about others. And breaking the pandemic to endemic.  And also be dnr please when u get sick.
Health secretary and his whole team can all resign.
Funny how the only person who stood up to risk losing their job and showed some back bone is a man
Was waiting for these experts to pop out like the experts fromthe  Ali G's movie, because that's how much of a comedy sketch this whole shambles is.
Ide say the doctors working in ICU since the start of the pandemic are in the best place to call themselves vaccine experts since it is doctors that diagnose the outcome of people who did or didnt take the vaccine and literally doctors analysis that forms the statistics and "science" ?
He has balls and is a doctor…Everyone should be able to give their point of view…This is democracy
NO ONE is in the ICU beds 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Look at how unbusy these healthcare workers are. I was expecting a new nurse dance video
Well said that Dr , the science isn't strong enough , this should be what's shown by the MSM not MPs and what they think ,because it's obvious they know the truth ,just look at there behaviour
Good man ! Tell them straight !
This is insulting for the MILLIONS of lives that could have been spared if they had access to the vaccine. And I am not talking about people with comorbidities, but people who did not get the proper medical treatment due to hospitals being overwhelmed, especially in low income developing countries. From a point of privilege is really easy to commend this type of behaviour and cheer for a doctor who obviously has a personal bias against vaccination. A lot of people could not afford to gain natural immunity and a lot who did survive now struggle with long-covid and are more vulnerable than in the very beginning of the pandemic.
No jab
Ffffffff with that 💀 vaccine
IM NOT ANTI VAX! …. BUT I HAVE A RIGHT TO DECIDE IF I WANT DRUGS INJECTED INTO MY BODY OR NOT , NOT BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT OR MY MANAGER OR ANYBODY ELSE IS TELLING ME I HAVE TO BECAUSE ITS GOOD FOR ME ! … WE ALL SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR OUR DECISION
Who's the Doctor here?! I know who I stand by!
this man is not saying that no one should get the vaccine he is saying those with antibodies (from having covid) shouldn't get the vaccine antivaxxers please STFU
Well said Doc!
Vaccine mandates save lives. It is quite selfish to refuse it. I myself have taken 2 doses and will soon get the booster shot. The science is settled on this matter :)
Comment section full of anti-vaxxers 😂😂
Haha backs it up with science and gets the reply of “it’s your view” umm no it’s the view of science or missing science haha
He is absolutely correct. Keep fighting!
Yeah just what we need the doctors and nurses going on strike cause they will be forced to get a vaccine that should be a choice
Completely agree with that doctor. Why can’t everybody have common sense??
WATCH HIM ON THE YT CHANNEL UNHEARD
It took just two years, to wake up..
This doctor is one gutsy guy to speak up. People need to stand up  to these fascists, who are not taking natural immunity into consideration. One solution DOES NOT fit all. How hard is that to understand????
That's just facts and logic, nothing controversial at all.
#respect!DrSteveJames!!!!!
I knew this would be the most viewed and highest comment count on this story. When I put a comment up it was 400 now 18,000. Wow.
Such a brave man.  Respect to him!
It's mind-boggling how the interviewer is asking for their views and then proceeds to challenge it... This man is a Doctor... In fact, he and his medical staff are keep the patients in the background ALIVE... as they have done thousands of times throughout this plandemic and yet, people refuse to LISTEN! Lord, help us all!
Lol why did they have to put that at the end ffs, the doctors right and he knows it to lol
Y'all anti vaxers are fxking wild, lmao holy fck.
The Government that claimed to be following “The Science” seems to be very selective about what science the follow. They blanket vaccinated everyone, then blanket boosted everyone. The creator of the AZ vaccine actually said not everyone needs the booster; I think she knows a little more about the vaccine than whoever advised the PM about the booster program.  For a good while now we have been in the midsts of a political pandemic with the medical pandemic passing a long time ago. A media driven, opinion pole following, statistic cherrypicking and misrepresenting political pandemic.
It must have come as quite a shock, since the health secretary is used to people saying yes and agreeing on everything. Can we start a campaign to elevate this doctor to the sage committee.
It will be interesting to observe the outcome of this  in couple of months. Is he creating a milestone
This deserves to go Viral all media outlets.
They said it would be personal choice to get the vaccine, obviously not the case. Who trusts the government at this point anyway
Why do I have the feeling that the health secretary does not hold any medical training?
Lol this just made not wanna get jabbed even more
Well done to the doctor for speaking it as it is….. the truth is coming out, a booster a month to be effective 😱😱😱🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Its a shame that even DR needs to be taught on how to protect themselves and the people they ares treating.
Well done hallelujah.. finally  somebody has got the balls to tell the facts.
He never gave an argument against vaccination
We said Doctor 💊🏥
Absolutely appalling that NHS workers should be threatened in this way for a pathogen that is on par with catching a bloody cold! Your own anti bodies are the best! better than the RMA artificial vaccines. The experts they take advice from work for the vaccine companies. What a tyrant Savid Javid is and the rest of the axe wielding Governments left and right!
THIS is the definition of a MAN! RESIST, DENY, DO NOT COMPLY!!!!!
Someone who is actually “following the science”. Good for this doctor.
Country of 60 million people and only a fraction had seen it ! What a shame !
Mah MAN!!!
Health Secretary has zip qualifications in health.  He is a mouthpiece whose duty is to provide lipservice supporting government's policies.
tories ain't listened to science all the way through this pandemic.
if people bombard their immune system on a regular basis with the covid vaccines not only will it slowly become less effective but when that vital immune response is needed for this or any other virus inevitably overly  vaccinating humanity will have weakened natural immune response so much over time that unfortunately those people on jab number x? will be completely and utterly f*ct and so much worse off than those who opt for natural immunity.
He’s probably getting punished for this , not right away , but down the line .
more coverage on this type of conversation please
Amazing, if only more people like this doctor could come out and speak the truth
HEALTH SECRETARY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE VACCINE & COULDN'T ARGUE ENOUGH WITH THE YOUNG DOCTOR.  THE YOUNG DOCTOR SPOT ON. I TOTALLY AGREE WIRH HUM. WELL DONE TO HIM. 👏 ✔ 👍 👌 😀 🙌 👏
“We take the best (chosen) advice. Your advice doesn’t make us money”
It’s ridiculous that they want to take away your choice by threatening people with their jobs if they are not vaccinated I  refuse to have the jab my wife has had the jab and yet she has had covid and I have not so I still decline it. No one is forced into having a flu jab and yet the severity of it is the same if now worse
They don't take the very best advice, they take the advice of those who have an agenda to promote, and therefore they get it wrong.  That is called, a "conflict of interests", they are not actually interested in the truth.  [Truth should equal science actually, but no more, science now equals "hidden agenda" (sometimes not so hidden)]
Why people still believe in a power play of politicians in the 21st century? Something went wrong somewhere.
Great man for actually talking out!
The facts they don’t want to hear 💔
He is just being reasonable and wise. Those other nurses there don’t really dare say what they are thinking, but most probably agree with everything the doctor speaks out about. So sad to see how this official is bullying the staff.
Its Not just  veiw its his Professional Opinion hes a doctor.. What a embarrassing situation for Sadiq.. Well done to the doctor
One very awkward moment for a government in total disarray, probably many more to come
He’s wrong the anaesthetist is far from an epidemiologist as has been widely criticised by the profession for endangering vulnerable patients.
That's the way to tell the ignorant and political idiots what's the reality.
Look at the Israeli research,  13 times stronger immunity   natural immunity than any vaccine and lasts years not just months.
Guarantee this policy will be scrapped on 31st March. The Tories have no intention of going down in history as the party that sacks precious NHS staff.  However they will have achieved their goal of forcing as many hesitant staff as possible into complying so win win for them.
The doctor has no studies to base his claim that we will need a booster every month. Seems he has an agenda.
He says he respects it but didn't he say a while ago that everyone who hasn't been jabs are idiots 💀
I'm under the impression that Tcell memory can register sars from the 1980s and can recognize co vid 19 as its cousin, same family and knows how to fight it I think this is why a large portion of the population is asymptomatic, basically, Tcell memory could have the lasted in people over 40 years.
Need to be really idiot and blind to get the vaccine.Side effects will be 100% in the future to.
Someone’s getting rich off this vaccine!
This is a man on a mission! He won't be detracted by a doctor with an opinion. He will listen to 'vaccine experts'!
So Kings College say that it is not mandatory to disclose Staff vaccination status yet say 90% have had it. So what 90% of covid nutters did a tik tok to announce it to the world did they??
"Listen to the doctors and scientists" "Not this one though"
HERO
Why qsk for others view to the slate them and not take their clinical experience and try and say your team in the government are the only experts, the doctors opinion was clinical valid, we aren't able to realisticly do this monthly
His arguments do seem reasonable. It isn't just quacks and conspiracy theorists that object after all. I don't really know what to think now. How many boosters a year will we be taking?
Not a virus expert, just a numptie.
other doctors and medical experts, please come out of your closets and expose the EVIL!!!!
Good for him! I have been told I need to get the vaccine and booster as a carer and now support worker. The dismissive tone used against him is laughable considering how much more valued this doctor is to the latter and really shows the delusion of the situation as a whole.
Good for that  doctor. Very smart. I also will not get vaccinated  though Im a doctor in South America
So his experience working around this mess and not getting sick , means nothing . Why did the jerk even ask the question . Sorry but this is simply just another means of calling the doctor stupid .  I agree with the doctor . God bless
I support this doctor....what he's saying is what "conspiracy theorist" have said in the past....at last they are speaking up
The first 0:10/0:15 sec shows how they truly feel kinda a shame cameras were there but rate the guy for talking
When facts meet fascists.  At least he did not lie. He takes the best advice from the people that are "vaccine experts". Those experts work for Pfizer and the advise comes in the form of stacked Dollar bills.
shame on the other doctors who couldn't speak up its them and people like them that all this can be blamed on
Losing my job this month because of my reluctance to be vaccinated. I'm so sad it's untrue
Stick it
I stand with this doctor! Courageous and honest chap, anesthesiologist go to school longer than most medical doctors I will trust his word over the TV puppet or the fake hack doctors who peddle lies and deceit to the public at the CDC and WHO.
crazy people
Well, usually are doctors who prescribe vaccines to politicians not the other way around..
“ that’s your view “  Nah player. These same people kept telling us “ trust the science. Trust the science.”  Now the science doesn’t support what they’re doing and they’re calling it opinion now.
The bald guy lost his brains when he lost his hair
So the minister of health ask others what to do becuase he has no idea what’s going on…neither the experts…so this is ridiculous as it gets. He needs to be boycotted and the minister health should no longer be in charge of making policies
NHS funded the creation
Well said more people should stand up for what the believe in like this chap … very calm and knowledgeable … the usual answer we will take answers from experts  …  wake up they are taking every bit of freedom we have little day by day …
The guy is just another NOVAK idiot - should be released from his employment. JH
It is COERCION
There are so many opinions, who is right & who is wrong, I think nobody knows!
This is terrible- healthworkers know that health promotion is part of their work. Evidence-based medicine is how we practice and the evidence has been very clear when it comes to the safety and efficacy of covid vaccines. If health workers say they aren’t getting vaccinated why should the public?
Politicians are the most useless people on this planet
Let's not forget those of us that have lost our jobs in the health and social care sector already for refusing the vaccine. I myself being one. I stood at the front line caring for elderly residents despite the risks to myself  day in and day out working sometimes 80+ hours a week. It was ok then wasn't it.. vaccine is personal choice and should not be made mandatory for anyone. The state of our so called care homes now is appalling and the NHS will go the same way. Under staffed, over worked, unappreciated. I wander if any of our so called leaders eould do what we as care workers and nhs staff have done or do??
The journalist trying to get the opposite from what this doctor is saying + dismisses him saying “let’s hear from vaccine experts..” 🤦‍♀️
At least he is a true doctor and scientist not a robot that is following instructions from pseudo scientists. If there is something these vaccines better called gene therapies do is not providing immunity. The perpetuators of this planedemic are ever shifting goal posts  from one jab to two to three or booster to a shot every month and pretending they are following science. Is natural immunity not science ? Ain’t there drugs for Covid? Is Covid even an emergency!!!!!????? Calling for emergency rules!!????
Watching a politician tell a doctor he is wrong is rather amusing
Stupid rule , at least he asked the question.
Experts!! that only have one answer? I don’t know really and we think 💭 it will work, by jabbing everyone at a cost to the people and Africa can’t afford the vaccine and have the lowest cases in the world!! Umm 🤨
Dumb doctor
At some point people won't allowed to be pushed anymore and when they finally find out this stuff is killing people, they will hang people like this director in the street
He has natural antibodies and he has sufficient and thorough knowledge of Covid, having worked with Covid patients for years now. It’s time for them to respect his credentials. They treat us all like we’re nobody and we know nothing. It’s despicable.
Why is he wearing an ffp3 in a non AGP room but yet our nurses DRs are only allowed to wear a standard Surgical Mask
He has very little experience....he's only a doctor ‼️👨🏼‍⚕️🤷🏼
....don't have the 'Science Slime'!!
#gettheshots 🙏‼️😛
SET UP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fire this semi doctor.
Well done to the doctor 👌👌
I can smell those thick farts thru screen of my phone
The health secretary should know what he's talking about, he's a banker. A complete and utter banker!
YESSSSS!!! 🙌
Well done for standing your ground. Real shame if he will have to leave NHS
We all know the injections are fraudulent, don't give immunity or protection from anything.
Jesus is coming soon be ready for the rapture of the church or be left behind for (Revelation 13 verse 16-17)
Good on this man, little worm javid wasn’t expecting a real man to be behind him
❤️
Good on him
Kudos to him 🙏🏼
Finally someone standing up to Government, but he will lose his job.
This man is a disgrace for NHS. He neither has medical knowledge nor he is well qualified.
Good on the guy - NHS is already fucked so Javid and his science experts 😂😂😂😂 want to get rid of the best if they don’t get a vaccine - a four hour wait to get seen at a and E will become a day
Finally someone said it well!
"The science isn't strong enough." That says alot.
Interesting how SKY let's such a interview on air, something in the pipeline, I think so ....
He got fired, out of a cannon probably
Why won't they allow ANY counter discussion happen about this? That's freighting!  I applaud this Doctor for speaking the truth!!
Kudos to this doctor 👏🏻👏🏻
To many sheep he will be thrown on the scrap heap won’t be long
Welldone doctor, i hope more will follow suit😞
"vaccine expert" yeah right
Finally someone who has a brain cell to speak his mind. I can't see Boris, Chris and Sajid working in a hospital. Those three would not last 2 minutes.
I haven't done anything wrong. I have antibodies yet the government is sacking me in April because I refuse to have risky drugs that I don't need injected into my healthy body.
Why does this dr sound so nervous to speak to this FOOL?  It is because he knows he could LOSE HIS JOB for simply speaking his mind, knowledge, training, and experience.  Smh what has this world come to?  Will this madness ever end?
He must be an uneducated knuckle dragging anti vax conspiracy theorist; oh wait...
I do have a feeling there are some in the British National Health Service having seen American politicians Rand Paul and Rodger Marshall Advocate natural immunity without the vaccine.
I hope the day interviewer i factoring in the views if Dr Robert Malone and not just cherry picking experts who agree with him. The reality is that the situation is nuanced and vaccine experts don’t all agree with each other.
How sad have we become that we consider an opinion of his kind, brave. Also, isn't it incredible that we've been told to listen to experts since the start of this, but when experts speak out against the handling of the pandemic they're simply shunned, shamed and dismissed?
Absolutely,  I have had my vaccines but definitely don't like the idea having to be forced to take the vaccines. Its ethically wrong!!! Just working for NHS s stress enough on a daily basis, especially when most of our patients are unvaccinated,  staff are getting infected from caring them despite vaccinated!
hes saying that the vaccine is effective for only 1 month, but cdc.gov says that vaccine effectivnes lasts for 6 months, he doesnt belive cdc?
Kudus to ths Dr for standing up for his rights...and speaking out
I hardly doubt most medical professionals would agree with mandatory vx. This is top down authority making decisions rather than those on the frontline, even those nurses at the start were uncomfortable giving any answer. Bless this brave man.
I agree with this man
So... why doesn't he want the vaccine exactly???  He doesn't say, just implies he knows better.  He's just arrogant this guy.
Sajid Javid does not seem to be much informed about the topicand did seem quite silly - what a shame, really! Kudos to Dr. James for speaking the truth, as per current best studies available.
Credit to this man, and as for the cases of so called none vaccinated patients being admitted to hospitals, of course they want to dramatise and make a fuss of that! They want us all to have the hive mentality and just do what they say!!
We need more honest doctors like this
We’ll done
I’m not sure about anyone else but I feel like this is heavily staged. Why would this just be on mainstream media as it doesn’t fit their narrative? Just really out of the ordinary 🤷‍♂️
Shock no women said anything useless
Vaccines and boosters are all bs. This good doctor knows it.
I mean, he does own a private breathlessness clinic so it's kinda in his best interests.
If a doctors refusing to have the vaccine then y should we?
The doctor knows best the a health sec who’s about a useful as a chocolate coffee cup!
What a legend, good on him for standing up to this madness
Valid questions by the Dr. completely sidestepped..
Sack him, I’d refuse to let any doctor or nurse treat me if they had not had the vaccine. What a pathetic man
No one should be blackmailed into having vaccination . Disgusting way to treat people dedicated healthcare workers this way .they weren't worried about NHS staff putting their selves at risk in the beginning no one was vaccinated these ppl had no choice but to put their own lives at risk . Losing staff in this way is putting more lives at risk how stupid is this government
Full respect to this doctor standing by what he believes in I’m in full support of this
I wonder what the % uptake would have been if they weren't under threat of losing their career. This is criminal, forced test subjects with no idea of long term side effects. What if there are major side effects, and 90-100% of all health care workers were affected? Its insane to put these people at risk. The CDC didn't even jab 50% of their staff, because they need people to figure out what to do if there is a problem. This should apply to all critical workers.
inb4 this getting deleted off the webs
It’s time we fight back against this evil they don’t care about us one bit well done to this doctor, don’t give in to them stay strong 💪🏿 it’s about time we all woke up people
We’ve all been forced to get the vaccine and most people have got it because they have felt they have to. I don’t see the science behind it and only see corrupt companies with past experiences of paying people off creating the vaccines in a capitalist society where they strive to make profits. They don’t work for the government or our country they work for their profit. Me personally I’m double vaccinated and have still caught both variants.
The Doctor is correct. Natural immunity should not be debated.
Wow completely calming answers.. and as I have not taken Vax and I have complete faith in my Ayurveda and holistic medicine to fight particularly against infection like covid.
If this was about health we wouldn't be mandating vaccines at a time when the NHS is already under strain. All staff whether vaccinated or unvaccinated have been working on the frontline since the start of this pandemic at times with insufficient PPE. I will lose a job I have loved as a result of this policy.
The science isnt strong enough" hahahah everybody remember thay this is a doctor and not a biofarmaceutical scientist. Maybe hé could understand a little bit of the data of the clinical trials, but apparently not bc hé doesnt seem te be bothererd by the levels of antibodies u get with u second shot. Which is about 3 to 5 times higher. Next to the fact that hé is talking about lowering transmission, which vaccines not do directly. Hé also says we should boost every two months which is crazy and bullshit. The interpetation of only being protected when antibodies are present in the blood is not true bc when u get the virus after u had the vaccines and after antibody levels have dropped u still are protected. Why u ask? Because u still have B-cells that produce these antibodies which will be hugely upregulated so u will have lots of antibodies and thuss are protected. So plz get the shots. Not even for others but for your own future protection bc your body will remember to make these specific B-cells for years if not your whole life. The boosters are here to help with mutations and to help your body against them before they enter your body.
Good man. Ever since getting the vaccine I've had covid twice and had 6 months feeling run down. I was fine before
I hope he is well and truly SACKED along with all the staff in the NHS who won’t get vaccinated.
Fairplay ✊🏼
The 5 second silence of the ladies said it all - Pure Fear to actually say what they think. If they were happy with the mandates they wouldn’t hesitate to say something but they are so afraid of losing their jobs. In this case silence speaks a 1000 words. And of course massive kudos to this doctor for speaking out and stating facts! The world has gone mad
🎤 drop 🖐🏽 🤫
Tories are just hoping to one day accomplish there goal of privatising the nhs that's why there dismissing doctors who haven't took there jab regardless of a medical condition or a  religious belief
"We take advice from vaccine experts" well your experts have been wrong for two years
Which tells me that 90% of your staff lacks simple common sense.  How are these the people leading this 💩?  It’s exactly what the guy said, a jab a month and it doesn’t provide protection from getting or spreading.
Meanwhile ppl who took the vaccine :😐😐
This doctor is a proper hero not just some dancing doctor on TicTok
Wow! So much courage!
this comment section is acting as if this man is the world's top virologist or biologist. he's an anaesthetist from staines
I had my 2 vaccines so people who didn't want vaccine didn't have to but now knowing that NHS staff who worked through it I will not be getting my booster or any other jabs out off protest
Unfortunately politicians telling/guiding how a doctor or scientists has to act in Pandemic
Well done doctor ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Respect doc…. Sajid more onto somebody else….. ANY OTHER VIEWS
where'd he get his degree from? clown college?
God bless him and his family
Once antibody levels fall we then rely on T and B memory cells to kick onto action and provide protection upon infection with   the virus . Thats the way we maintain longer term protection so why is the Doctor saying we all need jabbing every month ? He's an anaesthetist but should have some knowledge of basic immunology .
Wait, UK's health sec. is an inbred with cousins who run 2 star hygiene takeaways... Interesting.
RESPECT STEVE JAMES 🙏🙏🙏
How about the reporter stop and listen to what the health expert Doctor has to say!!
Respect to this Dr. It’s a shame there is thousands of people losing their jobs because they refuse to take the vaccine. My partner is one of those who will lose her job. Families will suffer - people will become homeless… why..  because they refused to get a vaccine “for your health”. Scumbags.
Maybe ask who is earning money from This and if this minister has shares etc in big pharma.
🙏🏼👊🏼✌🏻👌🏼🙌🏼 this doctor is for the people
Wow what a Chad.  Telling mr clean what’s up
Very sad to see how our NHS staff are being treated, there is such a shortage of staff already, that I feel this mandate is counter-productive !
Wow a guy with brain cells put on mainstream programming and being allowed to finish a sentence! Incredible 😂
amazing
Bye then
Lock up Bill Gates.
This dude shouldn’t be allowed to work in health care…. Shame
And he knows that owain is a lie there are people that are still showing natural immunity to viruses over ninety years ago what a lying Health Minister he should be fired and tried for crimes against humanity
There is no debate, there is a choice and it will be defended
A qualified medical doctor stating scientific facts is dismissed by a simple MP who states it's just his opinion 🤦🏻
Health Secretary sounds like a used car salesman.
The guy asking questions from the doctor is a complete idiot. And yes the doctor is telling the truth.
Got belittled by my vaccinated family on the weekend.. why? Because i decided not to have the vaccine. Its funny how ive spent hours researching wheather the vaccine is right for me.. yet they've just listened to the goverment without any research and got jabbed.. yet im the one who gets ridiculed.
Yep. After my 3rd dose, I am now wondering how effective these vaccines truly are. Apparently, Israelis are now on their 4th dose. IMHO, this COVID has been blown out of proportions.
I'm a medical engineer in the NHS, I'm not patient facing and I'm being forced to take the vaccine.  I was told "nicely that if I dont dont the vaccine I will be fired. And since I'm young and new to the role they are really forcing me to have it thinking they have an edge on me. Where is the precious freedom we love ?
Javid getting angry towards the end, what a snake. The Dr is making perfect sense.
What were the health secretarys response to this doctors point...."um er um er um er....
Well said 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Love that Dr
Brilliant, fair play doctor/ nurse
On es vraiment  perdu dans se monde avec les décisions politiques  aléatoire
Disaffected member of the team. Just get the jab and STFU
Go on son
"We take advice from the vaccine experts" what about the vaccine experts who say the exact opposite... Oh they're threatened and censored, aren't they...... Well done to this doc for saying what a lot of us wish we could.
Good on him, I've had it twice, certain I must have antibodies.
I think the doctor is an expert Mr Javid !
That guy only listens to "experts" that tell him what he thinks is right.    That doctor expressed hi view clearly and the health sec ignored it as if he didnt know what he was talking about.     Its been 2 years now so these "experts" should be able to answer a basic question.    Why should someone get the jabs if they got the virus already?
Love and respect for this good guy 🙏
Well said. I'd like to know why the WHO has ADRs for COVID-19 vaccine on record dating back to 2018.
Brilliant 👏
I am proud of this man
“We take the best ideas we can . . . . From people that are vaccine experts” he means from people who are pushing the vaxx agenda. He’s basically telling the eunuch doctor that his experience and facts don’t count against the propaganda
This doctor makes 100 percent sense ,why take the jab when u have your own antibodies. ...
“Vaccine experts” also known as sales reps from big pharma…
I got my dog gets vaccinated. But im an anti vaxxer myself.
How is it that people who allegedly studied biology and medicine aren’t defending and advocating for natural immunity and antibodies?? This doctor admitted his antibody status but is walking around being timid about the facts?
Much respect for this man. These days it takes so much courage to stand up and speak the truth and what was once common knowledge. Hopefully he doesn't face any repercussions.
Freedom of choice freedom of speech there trying ti take that away from us
Well done Sir!! We need more people standing up and telling the real truth!
Is there an explanation as to why and how the virus mutate? Do the vaccines prevent or accelerate mutation?
Aww so cute
From the people who are vaccine experts? Where? How do they know  How do they prove it
Wonder if he'd still have that opinion if he was on a ventilator keeping him alive alone in hospital whilst he had covid..
Never bow to evil
BRAVO
The Dr is completely in the wrong with his knowledge. Probably best he is fired!
More professionals need to start standing up to the insanity of vaccination especially when the science just isn’t there. And the truth of the matter is it’s all about the pharmaceutical companies making trillions of pounds and governments take any moral stance against their own people.
This booster shot will be on going thing therefore I don't want it.
Video appears to end before the exchange does.
If not being vaccinated was such a risk to patients, why would the NHS/Government wait months before implementing their mandate? We were encouraged to clap for these professionals, who put their lives on the front line for us when the stakes were highest and now people are turning on them when the disease has mercifully attenuated to be more like flu. If 100,000 or even 1,000 don't wish to take an experimental vaccine when they feel well and are almost certainly as immune as anyone vaccinated (and they are medical people who are well placed to know) then we have no right to demand it of them. I suspect that many of these 100,000 are not coming out and describing the side effects they have seen from vaccines. Treat the sick and vulnerable, leave the healthy alone, or we will continue to spend a disproportionate part of our health budget enriching drug companies by treating the healthy at the expense of cancelling other treatments and care for the sick.
The amount of total degen retards in this comment section is imconprehensible.
I have an underlying health problem, indeed with lower immunity to infection.  I was advised by a doctor not to have the vaccine. He told me that the science was not entirely correct on the vaccine side effects. I did however have the vaccine and have not had any problems. I think until all the evidence is in it should be choice without prejudice.
Health secretary paid off by pharmaceutical companies
1:20 no it is not. Yall not virologists
He should be the boss, probably the only doctor I trust!
Well done doctor!!!
Bravo👏👏👏👏
A massive well done to that man!  The nurses obviously got abit scared to say their true thoughts on the vaccine in case of backlash but that man if obviously educated in the matter and took a stand to say his honest opinion.  Everyone is entitled to their own views and I think he expressed his personal views very well.   The other guy tho 🤔 came across more argumentative and like he wasn’t happy that someone educated told their views on camera. He went in hoping for only one certain response and was upset that he didn’t get it.
I have had all 3 jabs to date here in the UK. It was a personal choice. I believe others should have that personal choice also regardless of wether it matches my views or not.   Education is an important part also. There is a lot of misinformation, particularly on social media. However people with genuine concerns should not be shouted down like some sort of conspiracy theorist.
❤️🍀🌍👌💪‼️
Let's see if he will get to keep his job in the near future.
People are so quick to judge those unwilling to be vaccinated, but they are the ones fighting for bodily autonomy. Once we lose our right to do what we will with our bodies, it will inevitably lead to the most tyranical government this world has ever seen. Revelation 13:16-17 kjv.
Why do these mp's become stuttering fools when challanged, well done to the Doctor
I don’t want to take a vaccine I had a really bad reaction with first dose so no thanks ain’t going through that again
Either it's mandatory for everybody or mandatory for nobody. Why should I be forced to have a vaccine when the patients I am treating aren't?
I’d love to know who the “vaccine experts” are that they claim to be getting advice from. Are these the docs paid by the pharmaceutical companies? Why not get Dr Robert Malone to give them some advice. Well done to people for standing up for what’s right and calling the BS. Stick together and support one another. There should be open and free debate to determine solutions for COVID, not government mandated policies.
I'm warmed by the amount of support in the comments and the number of views this got recently. It gives me hope because so many people are afraid of speaking up in public about this covid nonsense.... its time to wake up
He said he respects that and understands that.... Then agree... Liar
God bless thos doctor 🙏  We need more people standing up against the jab
I've had covid, both jabs and booster. That's my choice. I don't agree with mandates.
Shame on #GoodMorningBritain for their interview with Doctor James. They patronised him right up untill the point where they bought in Dr Hilary 'Shill' Jones to ridicule him. Dr Hilary Jones was allowed to speak without any interuptions or questions. Doctor James was given the final word but as soon as he debunked the nonsense by stating that Dr Hilary Jones only promotes one singular narative they bizarelly dropped a loud notification sound over his voice and ended the interview a few seconds later. Wake up people, wake the eff up.
Morons
Bravo
When there is a mandatory thing that is forced all over the earth then that's something not right... The doctor or any other human have the right to take or not to take vaccine or any other thing... Bcz no vaccine is efficient to stop the spread and the vaccinated people too hot infected. Now the case is clear basic human rights should not be taken out for the benefit of pharma business..
This doctor is talking plain common medical sense that All or most medical professionals would have spoken before covid can't even believe we are having this conversation whole thing utterly stinks!!!
Wow wow i was surprised to see this video here. Well done Sky news showing the other side as well not just what Big mainstream mediaban pushing!!!
This doctor won my heart. Simple plain common sense message to power. I commend the health secretary as well for allowing the doctors and nurses to express their views to him in person in front of the press.
Stick your bullshit vaccines up your arse
"Yea yea yea yea yea" "that's your opinion " This is what being ideologically possessed sounds like
This is the doctor we’ve all been waiting for 🙌🙌 his points are all true.
How has goose stepping to corrupt government mandates been working for ya?? Deception, misinformation Manipulation, fear, sound like good ethics?
He is a doctor and knows much more than this health secretary who gets led and information by others, taking advice.  I would much rather listen to the doctor
Hero!
Fair play to that doctor for standing his ground
let’s get rid of any mandates…
Time to find a new hobby then
The health secretary didnt want to hear the REAL science from a REAL DR he is trusting “vaccine experts” who have gotten it wrong. 🤦🏻‍♂️
More people like this HAVE to start speaking up. The media tries to paint everyone who does not want this jab with the same brush. We need people like this to stand up now.
Non-medic asks medic for his opinion, then essentially tells him he isn't really qualified to offer an opinion, when the answer didn't suit his agenda. Bravo, doctor
I'm surprised comments haven't been turned off for this video
These vaccine experts are they the same experts that assembled the virus ?
Let's be clear here, the doctor isn't against vaccines. He's opposed to the proposed mandatory vaccination as a response to the current Omicron variant and the efficacy of the vaccine and boosters on long term immunity.  As he clearly states, he doesn't see the proposal as being viable because that would mean monthly boosters for all NHS staff.  The opinion he expressed is far more nuanced than the click-bait headline is implying.
Soon well be forced to eat their food freedom is dead.
Bahahahahhaaa
BAM!!!! THERE YUH GOLADIES AN GENTS A "HIGHLY RDUCTED DR" says FUKU NO JAB FOR ME, THE "SCIENCE ISNT" STRONG ENOUGH. LOL!!!!! ALL INEED TO HEAR... THATS EHY IM NOT VAXXED.
Good doctor right there
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYIJxoh7gqw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCciAJJMt9Q&t=340s
What a man 👏🏽
All the other doctors standing around were probably too afraid to answer cause they don't want to risk losing their jobs
Britain is riddled due to this mindset.Doctors can be idiots too
We need more doctors like this
Well done for standing up for the 💯 awake people of this country!!! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
As a physician I couldn’t agree more. Simple common sense from a medical perspective.
I bet Javid really lost sleep over that.
all Sajid Javid could say is "that's your view" it's scientifically proven that natural immunity is far superior than this man made vaccine. it's not that difficult.   and these so called "vaccine experts" of course will push their product and want every last person to get the jab
A doctor himself doesn't want a vaccine that surely tells us something right
At least sky news still has 10% of their staff that can think for themselves, worst part is the unvaxxed are going to be left to care for the vaxxed as they continue to fall Ill...
Vaccine is snake 🐍 oil
HUGE RESPECT TO THIS DOCTOR - VERY COURAGEOUS
What a loser, I'm another nhs doctor
Sajid is a work place bully
Vaccine experts. $$$$$$. Those are the experts.  Lining their pockets.
Great coverage
Number is probably more than 10% of the RNHS
They say they follow science and experts but when a doctor, an expert, says something they don't agree with, it becomes "just an opinion"........ 🤷‍♂️
That nurse knows what he's talking about.
The sheer ARROGANCE of javid ! This man knows more medical facts and has medical knowledge of TREATING covid patients and has decided his own immune system can easily cope with any new variant because he's had covid and built up his antibodies. What does javid do ,   ignores him like 'he knows best ' !  What an arrogant tosser !
Well said. Someone actually speaking out.
Vaccines are 27 times more effective than only relying on your systems antibodies, that Doctor failed to mention that.
He means he takes the very best Kool-Aid that he can
Well.. time to find a new job buddy. We all have to do our part.... Where is he even getting his stats from? An antivaxer Facebook page?
Man looks like an absolute clown next to this Doctor. This is the health minister in the UK, what a joke.
“From people that are Waxine experts”🤣🖕🏾  Good on ya doc ! 👊🏾
So the phone pinged and end of interview lol
we need more people like this doctor!👏👏👏
So who is "the vaccine experts" this health politician gets his advice from??  Pfizer? Moderna? The health regulators who work closely with big pharma?  ...I'd trust an on-field practising specialist doctor over a pen pushing, deal spinning politician any day! ... where's the scientific peer reviewed studies showing that boosters will actually be beneficial to a significant portion of the population?  Anything? Or is science out the window and it's all about "deals and politics" now?
Just like 30-40 yrs ago they said Crisco oil is better then coconut oil. They the big pharma is telling us Vaccines or booster is better then natural immunity.😂😂😂😫
The risk to his health from getting Covid a second time is still greater than the risk to his health from the vaccine.   I respect the way he put his point of view across but I agree that we need 100% vaccination rates among medical staff.
I have the utmost respect for the doctor who is speaking the truth  and sadly one of our ministers virtually dismissed his point of view      I've read alot of the reply s  commending his honesty   the media frenzy towards non covids  around the world has people in hysteria towards each other   maybe people such has this doctor need to be projected more into the public media
The world needs more doctors like this!
😂👌❤️
The 'Vaccine Experts' from Pfizer said it's all good
He said his point of view in such a respectful and factual way. I am pro vaccine but given his response I can see why some health care professionals don't want the vaccine.
Taking advice from the vaccine experts i.e. pharmaceutical companies.
Whelp hope he has another source of income
💪💪💪💪💪
And he is a health Secretary hahahaha clueless 😂 😅
believe me, it all goes about the money,most people can't afford to lose there jobs so thy follow like sheep ,.there are thousand other medical people who know the truth but have been bribed by big pharma to say its safe and has been approved, but we all know its an experimental drug,same as policemen who abuse hit kick ill-treat people ,thy know what thy doing is wrong but thy just follow the science of being so abussive
Purely farmaceutical profits
Now this man is talking sense
This doctor is a legend. Finally people are awakening. Well said. All the respect to this brave doctor. Our health secretary hasn't got a clue...
😃✊🏿
A junior anaesthetist's view vs that of a whole advisory board who study virology and epidemiology advising the health secretary
We need Nuremberg 2.0 for all the people who censored people with opposing views during this pandemic. Businesses and lives were destroyed because of them.
"We listen to the experts".  The Nurrenberg doctors were experts,  too. Luckily there were also good doctors back then that rose up against the experts. Who knows how many innocent people would have died because of the experts.
He's a disgrace. Fire him.
Well, the doctor is the expert....the experts he talks about are all paid by the pharmaceutical industry
I’m vaccinated and i completely agree with the doctor lad because in 10 years time people will have 100 boosters ))) it’s funny but also sad because people had there vaccine just for going on holidays and get drunk
Sajid javid stinks
There we have it, well done Doc.. if the Government don’t reconsider guess all these health professionals will have to work outside the NHS.
Is he an immunologist? Is he virologist?  Not all doctors are experts in every field of medicine. They read what papers they can, but work mostly within their own field of expertise. He is one voice, expressing an opinion based on his views. He should present empirical evidence to back up his statements. I'm not saying he is wrong, but too many people think like him, see him as a figure of authority and decide this is where the truth lies. Leave these decisions to the actual experts.
I don't GAF what the 'experts' say, nobody will force an experimental treatment upon me by force. We already know what does it look like thanks to Germans and Japanese during WWII. Are we all NUTS??!!
Hero
This was incredible to see, and Bravo Sky for publishing it.   We live in a world now where tv personalities and arse kissing politicians get to tell fully trained and qualified medical professionals that they are wrong about a medical issue…….  very alarming times.
And every boost destroys your immune system.
I found the health minister to be very dismissive of the doctor who had good and valid arguments about not taking the vaccine. Health Secretary saying that they will take advice from experts is a laugh cause they haven't at all. Even the guy who created the new delivery system for the vaccine said it was pointless and Twitter banned him for stating facts.
Hero
The health secretary is an idiot
Health Secretary knows nothing. 😆
This government is a complete joke.  Who is this bald fanny? Not a doctor, no background in medicine. Just a token Asian in a tory government
Anaesthatist =/= knows how viruses/antibodies work
Who are the vaccine experts?  Are they in a conflict situation?  Who’s profiting from the vaccine?  What about vaccine injury?  What about the fact that vaccine manufacturers can’t be sued?  This is absurd.  Natural immunity is better than vaccinations.
Let’s make that doctor the next secretary of health
We take the best advice from vaccine experts. Yeah, not from medical doctors that is clear…
I just  wish thay would put asmotch effort into finding ways to cure cancer
Actually regret having both my vaccines tbh wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of people who have mysteriously start getting cancer at younger ages or something along those lines
This man is a HERO!
Amen 🙏
Good on that doctor for speaking up. Praying that this nonsense will stop.
🤣
Asked for their comments and then was totally stumped when someone had the guts to tell him how it is
so glad someone is speaking out!!!!!
The silence of the nurses is DEAFENING. Isn't it?
And this was sadest health secretary evil back uncovered....now it's clear that this 🤡 is for bad side too....noted... 💎👍
I'm referring to the bald dude Richard head
This guy is a lump head
Good man . He is smarter than pm
Secretary is frustrated because he not like that honest doctor 😂❤️❤️❤️ love this doctor
This health minister knows the truth.
Well done doc.
I hate how people are so rude to others for rightfully deciding to not get the jab. Fck off already. This is getting old.
This doctor has all my respect
With that statement at the end, I really hope the doctor is still in employment 🤞
Obviously health secretary is not health expert. There are full of useless power grabbing bureaucrats in government.
What a disgraceful performance from an elected official, shame on him!
Being told from a higher source what to do what to say to fear the people..... wake up
Good for him 👏
Imagine if a woman agreed to have sex with her boss because if she didn't he would sack her from her job. By law, that would be classed as rape. The boss would be arrested, charged, found guilty and imprisoned for up to 10 years.  Now imagine that same woman agreeing to have a jab because if she didn't, her boss would sack her from her job.  There really isn't any difference between these scenarios. Both are bodily invasions against the person's will, both are completely illegal, yet bosses and the government are getting away with the equivalent of rape. (on males as well as females)
A laughing stock of politician’s pure ignorance of science, but only government as partner with big pharmacy, become a salesman.
All these Muppets un this comment section praying this doctor, the one who moan 24/7 if they had to see a doctor how useless they are. And NHS is lying.... perthetic
Wake up please!
The narrative is starting to shift...eyes are opening. This is one of the greatest scandals in common era.
I'm fully vaccinated but I must say doctor got the balls to speak up 😊
God bless this doctor!! 🙏
Good for him
just shoot up everyday HAHHAHHAHHA
I've just watched GM News where this dr was interviewed. Those interviewing were absolutely disgusting in their perception and aura! How dare u judge this Dr who is front line and is seeing the day to day impact of those with covid and those with side affects! If we are not to belive the Dr's then who the HELL will we belive!!!!
Salute to  sky news for allowing us to comment our opinions 👏
They take the advice off the world health curupt organisation. Say no more. Well done to this doctor for stating the true facts. 👍
All about those #'s...
Took some balls but so glad this Doctor spoke up....spoke up logic..not all of this rhetoric....
very brave for him to stand up and putting his job on the line 👍
I’m still recovering from covid, didn’t want the vaccine because I believed my body will fight it off. BAD IDEA. I was so sick and weak from headache, fever and cough I almost passed out. I and my partner tested positive but he wasn’t sick because he had the vaccine. Please to avoid hospitalisation and overwhelming the NHS please get the vaccine. Will be getting mine too.
We only take the advice from the places that pay big £££
Fck every one of these paper tigers, secretary of nothing..mess them at every level.
Someone with bolls to defend the freedom
Glad to know some real men are still alive on earth  who tell truth to the pharma monopoly
The guy has worked with covid patients and done his research. In my view he is one expert in this and because of his job did decent research. The health secretary needs to take notice of those he works for and is  employed by and not just take vaccine expert's advice.  The people should be listening to. Health secretary did not like things not going his way in his interviewing and it showed.
God bless him  I'll pray for him and all those brave people who will speak for the truth.
It is all so one sided. I'm so happy people are starting to speak up. Your own body, your own choice. Why should that be taken away from anyone. That's when it begins to get scary.
He did a decent interview recently that went for a little under an hour,detailing his views.  Made perfect sense and worth a look.
That’s not his view moron that’s actual case study he is a bit off but not by much
vaccines are garbage and always have been .
He said it perfectly!!!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 It's exactly why I haven't had it. When the cons far outweigh the pros, it's a definete no.
European Medicines Agency's Head of Vaccines Strategy, Marco Cavaleri:   “If We Have a Strategy in Which We Give Boosters Every Four Months, We Will End Up Having Problems with Immune Response”  See Full Conferamce Here:   https://youtu.be/08tenjr7SUA
RESPEKT!!! "well thats your oppinion" "we take advice frim the vaccine experts"=those who make the money
Journalist gets owned 🤣
Tanga
As the NHS rules stand at the moment, that articulate, valuable member of staff will be dismissed if not vaccinated by the end of Feb.
Fuk the jab
The nurses’ body language and absolute silence speaks volumes.
A man for sure
We take advice from the vaccine experts. Can vaccine experts see into the future now?
Fair play to this man 👏 Sajid didn’t know where to put his face
This minister is an idiot.
it's become a point of pride. i'm fighting something way bigger than a ccp flu when i fight for freedoms and principles despite living 2nd class from it. shitlibs are equally as miserable with all their freedoms
Very humble and factual submission!!
kudos for the doctor who had guts to tell to health secretary. :)
Jabbid got owned
The doctor is correct. Sajid is a lieing donut who looks rather like a malteaser. So what is he actually? I'm confused
I have so much respect for this doctor👏👏
The health secretary: "We take the best advice". Meanwhile, everyone is beginning to see that even after three injections, this whole vaccination strategy has failed, was doomed to fail and fails. How long will these hypocritical politicians continue with their Machiavellianism?
It's mad we've got a government that has lied to us for over 2 years and a Dr that has helped people for over the 2 years but still a lot of people still think the government is right and still believe that people in hospital are just unvaccinated people with covid lol  and this dr is wrong because he dont want a jab what is wrong with people or is it just a hard pill to swallow that this dr could be right and not everyone really needed to get that vax at all I just hope all them people calling out people who choose not to have it will say sorry to all them people that they where wrong about and say sorry to all them nhs stuff who lost there jobs because of a choice .
A medicine expert an educated informed doctor 👨‍⚕️ telling a crooked totalitarian leftist politician the real FACTS to his face!!!! Great job doctor
Baldy had that end line ready, regardless of what the nice unvaccinated mam would say. What a joke. What the nurse said made far more sense than any mandate/passport/requirement.
From the people that are vaccine experts - he's a stupid man🤣🤣🤣 Look I have worked and lived in the country for almost 30 years. These politicians,  They don't care and have no common sense. And I could hear from the health secraties response that he is not intelligent. He is not a Dr so how can he advise when the experts are private firms who have the government by the ball sack
White shirt guy: i get paid a lot of money to do my job and push vaccines Nurses: Umm we don't want to lose our jobs by answering, someone please tell them to go away Dr: leave my nurses alone, they all have natural immunity as do i. FACTS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
How stupid is it that people refer to a vaccine as a “jab”. Is this a YouTube no no to actually say the word? Asking for a friend…..
I'll take the Drs word over any MP or PM any day as they don't no nothing about Medical matters at all & I'm so proud of that Dr for standing up to him 💜😁 more & more Drs should do it & put their own message out to people & I'm sure most staff who's had the jab got it under protest as the gov said get jab or lose job 😟 Last time I looked on the gov website there's More people sick in hospital that has been jabbed than unvaccinated.  X😎🐘
Go Doc your wonderful
That doctor should be in charge because he clearly knows more.
My wife will be loosing her job as a recipient on dental practice because of this crap and she was on her way up the ladder to be manager she heart broken does anyone know away out of this or around it so she can keep her job
Boris brort us brecksit sack all the covit stuff he got brecksit done. Boris is #1
Phizer wants to wait 75 Years to release data on their vaccine...why!? Thankfully a court has ordered them to do this in 108 days..The same length of time taken to approve. This to ensure that different scientists have an opportunity to scrutinize..
Egg head did it again get rid of these party
In layman terms... F.U...!!! I'm not taking this 💩!!!  HERO!
most docs these days know f all
Wow! Ballsy! Respect!   (Who would have thought 2 years ago that a doctor giving his professional, experienced opinion on healthcare to a politician would’ve been courageous and risky to that doctors career).
Why did Sajid Javid even ask the question if he didn’t want that answer.  Clearly he wasn’t interested in the facts based opinion of a doctor working on the front line.
That's view of professional doctor!
The nurse's silence says it all
They aren’t taking advice from vaccine experts though.  They are taking advice from statisticians, social manipulators and invested billionaires.
va cine experts and fact checkers are not representing science, they are just well paid individuals pushing a certain agenda for what they are paid
Takes a MAN to stand up and speak. The women were terrified to speak their minds!
What a man! Not the minster ofcourse :)   soon the number  likes on the video will disappear  too!
This idiot isn't listening to the Dr...he has no clue and obviously is embarrassed..good on u Dr for speaking up, thank goodness some1 mks sense
I respect this doctor for calmly stating his personal view even though most of the world will probably judge him for it. And for having actual reasons why and not just some conspiracy theory-ish answer like some people.   I hope they choose to keep him there!
everyone one can have their own opinions but i totally agree with this doctor
Finally a consultant with a brain and rational thinking.
Javid is chatting bs I had covid 2019 it’s now 2022 my antibodies have kept me going so that’s exactly what I will do
Vaccine experts, haha, who pays them
We need more unbiased experts to speak up! Also why are the comments flooded with support but all media hosts give only one point of view?
I’m a little surprised SkyNews aired this.   Good on him (the doctor) for standing his ground on this situation.
Natural immunity is the way, these vaxs to f all but hurt people
Are the vaccine experts employed by big pharma
Hero doctor! 💪
With all these healthy or non healthy debates about the vaccinations, the jabs , that is saying something in itself . That's why people choose to or choose not to. It should come down to freedom of choice .
He is more of expert at medicine than that oaf of a politician that's nothing more than a expert at genocide! I mean doctors and nurses get where they are by studying sciences wtf. Get rid of these elitists Tory dictatorship now ppl
Wtf
That's your view ..... pmsl. No that's science moron. Wise up rise up
Health Secretary: "We take advice from vaccine experts".   REALITY: We Take Orders from Pharmaceutical companies and their INVESTORS.
ahahhahhahaha
Vaccine experts really...they want us to get jab jab jab jab....
He's fighting against their agenda and they the elite don't like that.. stand against the illuminati be awoke in a generation and lineage of families being asleep, sheeples and too afraid to stand for the truth because being weak and believing everything and doing as they say is easier for their life's.
Leave the jobs and see what happens. Nobody should be forced and the side effects are deadly.
Must be the 1st sky clip I've 👍for at least two years 🙄
This doctor has made an appearance on good morning Britain recently and MADE to back track what he said or be sacked...and guess what comments have been turned off.
This has already happened in Canada. Where I live in Ontario they have fired tens of thousands of nurses and are now telling the vaccinated nurses who are sick with covid (go figure) that they need to continue to work with covid because we are SO understaffed. Not only nurses have been fired but many other sectors as well. We are fighting to survive here. The discrimination is almost too much to bear at times.
Just cos he's caught Covid and was fine doesn't mean others will be, hence all the hospitalisations. Telling people vaccinations or boosters are pointless is dangerous
Javid was a manager of Deutsche Bank (meaning, a manager of a criminal institution ;-)). What does he know about health, medicine or science?
Dictators
That is the doctor I would trust my life with. Wonderful and honest man
That Doctor deserves a Knighthood! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇬🇧✊🏻💪🏻 Stick their jabs where the sun don’t shine!
There are over 5 million families who have lost loved ones to Covid - a horrible, suffocating death. What would they say to vaccine?
His reason is that he's had Covid and has anti-bodies. But ignores that those anti-bodies will wear off
Oh from the people that are vaccine experts like faucci ya? The one that said the vaccine was going to end Covid ya? Guess his expert advice is better then this doctors.
Notice how the stupid health secretary gets his last word in by using the phrase vaccine experts 🤣🤣🤣 how people can't see that something is very wrong in all this is beyond help .
if doc loses his spot at that murder facility, lets get him a gofundme page and give him a year's salary until he finds a better hospital
I find the Anaethetist (far more qualified than a GP) to be quite practical. The public servant clearly not in his league on the topic. His reply was the expected beaurocratic BS around taking best advice. Governments will hopefully one day need to release the health advice for all to see. If this so called best advice is coming from Epidemiologists, it would explain how they got it so wrong.
Vaccine experts who like Psychopath  bill Gates.
Experts paid by fizer
I respect your view but can we have the ones we prepaid for please.
Out of all those tory MPs couldn’t they find one who was a doctor to be health secretary? The secretaries need to be experts imo. They all have that bollocks PPE degree. Time to change up how our country works and bring in technical experts as our politicians.
Shove vaccination up ur backsides the government think they know more than doctors
This is exactly why I and thousands of others quit working in social care and why there are immense staff shortages in health care 🙌
90% of staff got the jab
Hi Bozza
Didn't sajid have both jabs and still get covid
This doctor is my hero!!!!
Best piece of advice the government has received in 2 years 👍
Brilliant. Stand your ground.
Doctor vs a so called Health Secretary
Size of those 🎱 🎱  must be big
Sack him instantly!!!
Poor doc will be fired for speaking against blackmail
The doctor being a wanna be hero - most of us lived thru the virus; get vaxed to save the more vulnerable in society; we get it he survived the virus unvaxed; he young n fit; bldy selfish n over entitled
Love that guy good for him
Jabbed every month
Utter rubbish. The vaccine doesn't work and no one knows what they are injecting into people. These provaxxers are beyond stupid and have zero common sense. WHAT PART OF THE VACCINE DOESN'T WORK DONT THEY GET??? Experts??? The Health secretary is a paper pusher and NOT A DOCTOR.
This bald guy just literally shakes in fear
personally think it's yr right to have the vaccine or not and we shouldn't have to prove things to be able to go placed. fair play to him 👏
Adding to what the doctor said: the horrible, even deathly, adverse effects of the vaccines... Like please, he's right, we're better off fighting with our antibodies and using actual remedies that have worked efficiently.
Love this go on lad! More people need to get behind this
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
didnt expect that did they
Vaccine experts 😂
This doctor is such a Chad just explaining his views in a uncompromising and unapologetic way, while still doing it respectfully and concisely.   Big round of applause
It is all about killing us
The health SECRETARY telling the Doctor what He, the Doctor should w/his OWN BODY…IT is NOT open for debate or discussion as the SECRETARY has stated.
That knobby lil man had all the time and respect for him until he challenged the vaccine rule and antibody theory then he says well we leave that up to the experts looks at doctor and says "the vaccine experts" who are your experts and how are they more qualified than the people on the ground living with it daily what an appalling excuse for a minister!!!!! Toe the line lil man toe the line
Talking about omicron and delta like they exist. Idiotic. Staged otherwise it wouldn’t be televised
Vaccine Free
Wow! Bravo for the man who's full of courage 👏 👏💪
ITT: A bunch of clueless turds
Don't care as long as I don't have to sleep with IT !
This guy the doc needs sacked
STAND UP DR. its not an opinion its a fact!
Fair play to this doctor , spoke up and spoke sense 👏🏻
So glad he spoke up!
Vaccine experts like Bill Gates!
This doctor is a true hero funny how these office hands have no idea or clue about what the vaccine does to some people.
Stuff that I'm not getting a booster every month.
Pretty sad day when the media doesn't want to hear from Doctor's who are giving health information because they aren't the right type of expert.
Respect to doctor speak the true
What a hero doc!
I want the science to recommend vaccines at least 4 times a year. 😂😂
The other staff were afraid to say anything.
Ignoring Science and Progress takes us only backwards
Sane doctor not getting trapped in the cattle run.
This "Health Secretary" needs to be FIRED.
The reason your country fails in Covid 19 control Sky News
Thank u doctor to stand up.
The doc is an anaesthetist. They do another 5 years minimum of difficult study and training on top of their medical degrees. I’ll stick with him, not the government hack.
How easily  the so called health minister dismisses him and can't  engage a well qualified  Dr in conversation  but replies by saying we refer to our health experts 🤔  the experts that suit their narrative .. well done to this Dr.. so many  nurses have  lost their jobs for standing up to their principles good to see Dr's  doing so  at last.
That Dr HAS the best advice now Omicron is on the scene
Medical Strike anyone? Force the world govs into doing away with the mandates lest tens of thousands of people die from everything and society grinds to a halt because everyone is sick or injured, Give it one week.  Imagine if petrol station and oil field workers just went on strike over this, you'd literally see everything shutdown within less than a week.
YES!
They take the best advice from vaccine experts... like Pfizer?
KEEP IT NON MANDATORY
Couldn't UK produce a single eligible doctor to be a health Secretary? To be honest it is the case with most of the countries that ministries were given to those who don't have a clue about. How would it sound to take your car for a repair to a doctor?
He’s a living patriot.
I had covid in 2020 so I have antibodies I was also double jabbed and I still got Covid last week. I’m not getting boosters all the time they need to make something that works. The ‘vaccines’ they have are not practice.
Legendary. This goes to show how all this is POLITICS driven by POLITICIANS who have no idea what they are talking about getting fed lies by people who are either evil or also don't know what they are talking about. Vaccine experts? If Dr Malone says it's not good then who is a greater expert than him.
Waste of time ...
What a brave doctor! We need more people like him to speak up. So apparently to the health secretary only vaccine health experts and not medical doctors can read data and come to conclusions. So in other words the health secretary is stating doctors are no longer to be trusted with coming to their own conclusions based on their own analysis. "come on man!" -FJB
GOD BLESS THAT DOCTOR !! He speaks the unbiased truth. Fair minded people are rare and worth their weight in gold 💖🙏
#vaccineexperts smh
And the sheep are led to the slaughter.
They don’t want to hear about natural immunity.  Natural Immunity will wane off but so do the vaccines, whats the point?
Steve James your a courageous fellow. Bravo for your free speech.
Hero!
Whats in the vaccines tell people the ingredients that they will be putting in their bodies
We will take the best advice from the vaccine experts ! (paid by Pfizer, J&J, Moderna) ...🤔
So instantly dismiss the Dr & take advice from the “experts” that are on the Pfizer pay roll.
Its not about fredom but about natural immunity for me.
Thumbs up for this doctor!!! Please listen to him about how long efficacy of the COVid vaccine lasts. I wonder if the scientists from Moderna and Pfizer got the vax from their company. That would be just fair!!
I totally agree with him, the science is not there for people who have had it.
Much respect to Dr. Steve James for saving the awkward silence amongst the nurses. The way he freely expresses himself in such a thoughtful, calm and respectful way says a lot about his character. This helps raise awareness on the importance of Pro-Choice and the freedom to think for yourself. Vaccinations in theory do carry benefits but they are also not without risks and people should be given the freedom to make an informed decision. Something else to think about.... if the Omicron  variant was discovered in South Africa - a country with less than 50% of the population vaccinated - why are their infection rates sooooo LOW compared to other countries? AND why are the manufacturers of vaccines released from any liabiities should someone suffer a severe reaction?  It's events like these that truly make me understand Dr. James even more when he says there just isn't enough science to justify mandating the vaccine. We need to ask more questions ! Seems to me , he is  neither anti-vaccine nor pro-vaccine - he is PRO CHOICE.
It's messed up. This guy is the expert. Those who say they are just want to sell the poison. Notice the other workers were to afraid to speak up. That says a hole lot!
Bravo  Doctor  Brave! Vaccines! - it  is about politics tricks and MONEY MONEY  Big Farma $$$$$$$$$$$$$😉😉😲
Well the doctor was smart , the other turd wanted to shut him up so bad for telling truths
Period, tf. These times literally feels like what it would be like to go back to 3rd grade.... as an adult. Do “they” really think we’re all dumb?? Common sense is common, don’t let media and “experts” speak anything less on humanity.
So what about putting other people at risk?
We can only ascertain. So my own interpretation of body language is that the awkward hesitation from the group of nurses showed how scared they were of saying what they really thought about the mandate.  The young Doc sounded like it was REALLY difficult for him to speak up and say his actual views and so good on him for actually doing so. This entire cultural & political situation is getting so bloody laughable.
Requirements and mandates are NOT the LAWS!!!!!!!
Good for him!!!
Being an MD doesn't protect everyone from falling victim to spastic paranoid asshattery. Fire him right away. That ilk needs to be brought to heel and put in their place.
Watch 'Unherd'
The vaccine only provides 2 months of reduced transmission to others?? Please stop. Actually, hygiene, masks, isolation and other protective behaviors reduce transmission to others. But should these reduction measures fail, and a person still becomes infected the vaccine is meant to boost their INDIVIDUAL immunity, chance for survival, or need for hospitalization. And then secondarily their "primed" immune system thanks to the vaccine can reduce their recovery time and with that hopefully reduce their infectious time period to others. So basically, a lesser number of infected individuals PLUS lesser lengths of time of infections help reduce the spread of the virus which benefits everyone. But this doctor pulling "2 months" out of the air and fabricating a ridiculous monthly vax strategy only he's saying would be necessary is so sad to hear. And that silence from the nurses is usually from people just wanting to keep their job and knowing that doctors in healthcare usually have more liberty to say things, right or wrong, that others don't.
The only thing they are weighing is their wallet  Corrupt f...s
The guy says vaccine experts.. there is a man in front of him taking data  everyday from patients & he is trying to diminish his perspective because it doesn’t support his cause.. 🤔 do they not know how untrustworthy that looks? Just an observation, no one needs to get  in an uproar.. I am not promoting anything just observing..
These politicians act like vaccines don't require a natural immune response in order to develop antibodies.   They are entirely wrong to assume vaccines provide the antibodies directly.  And therefore have no argument to ignore natural immunity.
This Guys has Balls vs the Experts Pussy
That "Health Expert" is no expert. This is what is happening. People like that nut want to be in control and tell people what to do in the guise of safety and security.... The Medical staff had a lot of very good points to make. Mainly that to be fully protected allegedly by the booster, then technically one must be administered the booster every Month, and as logic would dictate, that is not going to happen. And every comment he made that dumb "Official" only come back was well we do the best that we can and we are listening to "Experts" I thought he was walking around there playing expert? what a joke! That guy is embarrassing to his profession. He should be kicked out of his position with disgrace.... So many "Officials" like that these days. Its such a shame!
Sky/Fox News just more ugly propaganda.
The reason for the nurses awkward silence was explained by the doctor’s brave response. Hopefully we can get a sensible balance between vaccination and immunity from previous infection.
This doctor should be the health secretary.
Put the clown right on the spot there he did
This the man!
His body his choice!
We always face corona pandemic without vaccines, but suddenly after mRNA developed, they need free lab rats 🙄, coincidentally the first outbreak in China, so propaganda media can make a full swing
Nurses all silent...afraid of speaking the truth. God bless that doctor for having the courage to speak.
Good job doctor 😍👏
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
When a doctor says take the vaccine then he/she is the messiah... Any doctor who says otherwise is treated like a pariah
Lots of facts coming out now about the life threatening lies being perpetrated on the people .
Vaccine is not necessary for everyone, but it can save lots of life. The young doctor may not need vaccine. But his parents should get it ASAP.
Question: Why is this Doctor ONLY wearing a surgical mask when all the nurses around him are wearing FFP3 masks? FFP3 are dramatically better than surgical masks. Even the health secretary is wearing one. Looks like he’s NOT taking precautions seriously!!!
The Authorities should understand that the surge of omicron and also new variant in the world is not the result of nonvaccinated (5% -15%) as the variants are  new and recent ones. Further only vaccinated ppl are able to travel overseas to South Africa and other places where they were contaminated before returning back to contaminate others. The surge to covid and omicron is due to nonefficacity of one of the sanitary measures, which cannot prevent the variant from entering our body, ph of sanitizer as a cue to virus and variant contamination. The Authorities are hence responsible for these crisis and they don't care and are endangering the life of all these people, police included and their families mainly with the variant omicron prevailing as an air borne virus. The solution is to use essential oil eg amla oil to be rub regularly on hands, forearms and face and face masked and proper washing as the virus/variant is inert in such medium and is not able to enter our body. Already 6 millions of deaths since 2 years. The Authorities and those holding power on covid  have to change strategy with above Deus abençoe
Poor guy realizing he has overestimated the intelligence of his medical peers, all these years. Ughhh
Good for the doctor. We all got the right to live. Eventually the elite will kill off all the people that keep their feeble bodies alive.
Give that doctor a knighthood and throw a custard pie at that health secretary fella whatever his name is…
This why we keep getting variants… unvaccinated
My respect to this Dr.
Yeah, yeah, yeah....truth is he has got zilch!
On 13 January 2022 Susanna Reid interviewed Dr James. While viewers were fixated on her cleavage and commenting on social media, did they also observe her body language? It was pretty obvious she was not happy with Dr James having a voice that did not align with her own view, and was "gunning" for Dr James right from the start. I am more anxious of the "Susanna-Reid" types of people in this world, which there seem to be way too many like her now.
This doctor is a legend 👌
Small pox vaccine, 95% effective. 1 dose, 3-5 years Covid vaccine, 35% ? effective, 2 doses, 4-5 months ? FEEL BETRAYED YET ?
This doctor should be health minister, not this ex banker from a corrupt deutche bank
We must all stand up to these bullies.  They won't fight back because they can't.  They've got NOTHING.  We easily outnumber them.
This 💩💩 is NOT about health.  It's about CONTROL and MONEY.
Stop calling it a vaccine, it's not.
That Health Secretary was really not listening. His attitude was that of brushing him off and moving on. He did not want to hear anything contrary to his brainwashing. He mentioned the very best science....WHAT SCIENCE? Prove it. Every scientific research article I read says his science is full of BS.
So the poor Ostrich died for nothing !
Here we witness a freak occurrence when someone with common sense gets to talk to a politician. and it's so abnormal it's news worthy.
How many people has this idiot infected !!!!!
Aquired immunity is more durable sajid.. why dont u know that??
Brave doc
An MD contradicting himself. The science he is saying is not good enough also re booster every month
Where there is risk, there must be choice.
He's risking people's lives by not having a booster, next time he could die from covid.
Good for him, finally someone is courageous enough to speak up inside a health care facility.
...and the doctor in question is a specialist in which area???? Again, another story blown way-way out of proportion regarding reality versus one person's opinion, which this is.
Woah this is actually being reported on? What’s going on
This doctor is a hero!
Why are these politicians so stuck on vaccines?? Oh yea, money.
Antivaxers: "Why should we care about what the so called doctors, experts, and studies say?!" Also Antivaxers: "Wow, look at this doctor, he's clearly telling things like it is, everyone needs to listen to him!" Also Also Antivaxers: "Wow, look at this study done by experts, it clearly supports what we've been saying all along!"  Got it, so as soon as an "expert" or "doctor" even remotely says anything that goes against your preconceived notions , they are wrong, but when they say something conforming to those same notions, they are clearly right. No nuance of any kind, no in depth comparisons of the claims or figuring out exactly what is being claimed by the studies, just complete tribalism. Pathetic.
I admire this Doctor for speaking out.
This is the problem with putting somebody in a role that they are not qualified for. Javid knows what the man's saying is right but he has to tow the party line. There are some cabinet positions which require experts. The Health minister should be a former or currently practicing doctor if there is one available. The education minister should be someone that has been involved in education in some capacity.
He said… “Doctors that have antibodies exposure” that is what white privilege sounds like.
I respect people who don’t want to have vaccines and I respect people who want to get vaccines.
Well done to this doctor!! Sending him all the best wishes he is a credit to his country 👍👍 hope it encourages more people to stand up and wake the hell up👍👍
Why are being forced to take a product that expires every 5 months or less and does not avoid hospitalization or death?! The numbers are showing it, they can't hide it anymore! The "vaccines experts " loose their expertise when ignoring the fact that continuous inoculations might mess up the immune system as well.
He takes advice from the vaccine experts, also known as the vaccine manufacturers
This is not a debate to be had in-front of the media, who then blast it out to antivaxxers. The doctor wants a more sustainable plan than boosters - fair enough, what is his suggestion? The decision not to get vaccinated is utterly irresponsible towards his patients. Aaah, now I get what my friend, a top biochemist, used to say about the whole doctors vs scientists dynamic. Some mechanics would always hate on the engineers, who invented the damn thing in the first place.
Natural Immunity
This whole thing with the mandatory vaccinations is a total bs. Everyone know that but all act
This was so good, so good. Thank goodness there are people alive who can think for themselves and ask serious questions. And contribute with well thought out answers.
This is so mad. They can't stand up against them and strike as their job is to save lives so what can they do. Then when sacked who is gonna do their jobs as we are struggling to get healthcare workers in the first place. 🙃 Has this not been thought out like brexit.  Or is it lets just do it and wing it when it goes wrong like brexit. 🤔🙃🤔🙃
It isn’t true that the booster offers protection for two weeks only.
So who does Savage Jabit consider to be a vaccine expert? It makes me question what is really going on. Could this be the Dr that Boris is referring to when he says people are “spouting jumbo jumbo”
He felt he had to preface his justification for not getting the jan with the fact that he’d already had covid. Still doesn’t matter. The science doesn’t justify the jab, period. The fact that he already had gotten covid is cake at this point.
Boy it's almost like this thing is the mark of the beast from Revelation...😉
This reminds me of the Ryan Long video where he joked being a health expert and beat up the doctor who disagreed with him. "When an expert disagrees with the experts" the video was.   It's kinda sad that these people who are even in the field are scared to speak. Even the women's silence when asked about the vaccine just says a lot. That part reminded me of when the women olympians were asked about competing against a trans woman. Good on this guy for standing up and speaking his views and doing what's best for him. Need more of that than these "experts" Boris and his Peppa Pig Party crew tell us to obey the will of.
Dr. the immunity in your body is stronger than the man made immunity on the Jab. 👍
Health Secretary spouting false propaganda. More of the same.
Well done to that doctor.    Also.....The fact that people are still having to use food banks in 2022, because of man made poverty, proves the government is corrupt just like Boris Johnson and they have NEVER cared.  Minimum wage should easily be £20 an hour by now.  These greedy people have TRILLIONS of pounds in the banks.  Plus it's a machine that makes money, which proves there is no excuse for poverty.  Poverty is a crime.
Share share share 🙏
SMART MAN!!!! RESPECT THE TRUTHFULNESS!!!
The biggest and most dangerous criminals in this world are NOT the poor thugs on the streets, but the ones who hide in a suit and tie or put on a respectable uniform. They all need a tight rope around their filthy necks.
Brave Doctor!!! The truth is first!!
Ridiculous. Where would this country be if everyone took the same approach to vaccination as this doctor? More dead, more variants and a shattered NHS. Get vaccinated! 💉
Somewhat confused about how this doctor says “there isn’t enough evidence” and then makes multiple claims about the effectiveness of the vaccine. Something here isnt adding up
Good for him
My first vaccine has been delayed 3 times now it’s ridiculous when I have been seriously ill with covid because I got it a day before I was supposed to get my vaccine and they don’t want to give it to people in schools like me, most likely to get it and spread it
Who are the so called "vaccine experts"? Are they from the vaccine manufacturers or hired by them?
How come Journalists and politicians can. March into hospitals every 5 minutes when it suits them but relatives cant see dying loved ones?
Rabid Jabit got schooled by the Doctor. The long clip.is better.Who  are the experts Rabid is listening too.Bill Gates and Big Pharma?
I believe he believe in Santa and Jesus. What a joke.
I ❤ this doctor. We don't have enough medical evidence yet. We don't have a clue what we are doing xxx
Drop my saluted  boss,  Take my  little  bit  Pure Honer
Good for him. Look at the fuks in the background. What the fuk they gonna do
Those vaccines proved useless from protecting me and many others.
silence sometimes speaks louder than words and although I applaud this doctor for speaking up the silence of the nurses speaks volumes!
this shows these shots are not about your health but about selling a pharmaceutical product
I hope that guy loses his job. What on earth was that and 10000s of y'all are gonna eat it all up and think just because I saw one doctor saying not to take it that means all doctors on earth do it to... Research Andrew Wakefield and see why this is a problem.
Political bullshit from NHS jabber bullshitto
In 2 weeks, he will be found to have committed suicide by shooting himself twice in the back of the head.
Well done doctor
Vaccine experts xD - go home and eat an apple
Anyone else think this is  a bit of a smokescreen? If the government mandate the jab a lot of NHS workers will simply be sacked or leave. If they take this into consideration they may just scrap the whole thing all together.
Today reports from the Dutch experts and USA experts are saying Natural Immunity is better. I suggest our experts get there act together sharpish. The facts are out there if a Doctor on YouTube can get them why aren't our experts acting on the findings. They must no and read them.
Peasants Revolt.   Look it up.
Good for him!  Love it!
Vaccine mandates are there to allow people to go out on the piss down the pub.  Close pubs/clubs, stop the alcohol culture, stop the transmission, no vaccines required, easy solution.
Amen
Awesome!!
Brave man!. Is he still working there?
Vaccine experts = the people profiting from jabbing everyone as often as possible
Selfish …. So basically I’m thinking of myself and I don’t mind exposing sick patients. His view is a minority view of nhs staff. The nurses didn’t say out because they don’t agree and were embarrassed. He was on GMB and came across as a twit
I’m not and anti vaxxer or a non believer of Covid but the nhs need to pull there finger out and stop using Covid as an excuse from seeing patients with routine appointments and most definitely patients that require surgery.
Who wants to bet that Dr Steve here is a little religious Christian minion?
Imagine having to be jabbed every month….and I’m sure the Health Minister would go with this in a heartbeat if the “vaccine experts” said so……as if they would ever tell us we don’t need the vaccines….follow the 💰….
What's the difference if your doctor is vaccinated or not? He or she will still get sick (but with weaker symptoms if vaccinated), and will transmit the virus even if vaccinated. WHAT IS THE POINT?!
The funniest part is that Pfizer has released their clinical data about the vax and all but openly admit that it does almost nothing, and is not exactly risk free either. Look up the Canadian  alliance video on it, its not on YouTube, but on their site
This Doctor has the right and experience to do what is best for himself. Give us the facts and let us all make the best desicions we can for us. To potentially sack these amazing Doctors and Nurses who worked through it all because they don't want a vaccine is absolutely disgraceful! I too have had it and have antibodies so will not be having it either! To see a government minion shrugging off the opinions of a doctor is embarrassing and laughable.
Please don’t give them the idea to jab everyone monthly ….
I will pay him salary if he will be without job! What a great human been☆  i will support hes saying and the other guy has no sense at all !!! He tried convinced medical person that he is correct? Iam laughing .... and those other nurses scared of their job... mafia!
Pls people stop sending this kind of politicians to the parliament? Find an ethically morally sound leadership. Read the English history and learn from it. Please !
Unity in numbers  , censorship is on the rise
I am part of a walking group. 18 members. 16 fully vaxx'd and boosted. 2 totally unvaxxed. Last week we suspended our walks because 8 members tested positive...including the 2 unvaxxed...the 6 vaxx'd positives had very mild symptoms. ..the 2 unvaxx'd positives are still in the hospital...the choice is yours. And, btw, we are all otherwise very healthy and between 65 and 75 years old.
Total silence from the nurses until the doctor spoke up
"IN DRUG COMPANIES WE TRUST". A lot of people still believes that there's no dark side to science like how this viruses got created in the first place. Experts say multiple houses and Bugatti's are the 😘👌
Much respect to the doc
People have a choice and they have the right to refuse
Horrible advice on the end!
The vaccine experts could also be the same people selling their product lol   Really need specify who they are
Good man, i see nothing wrong with this..
Sajid Javid is ignoring the medical and scientific evidence. He is trying to rely on fear and threats to deter a virus. The virus doesn't listen to Sajid Javid or his fear-mongering and threats. Sajiv Javid only listens to vaccine salesmen.
This is what integrity looks like. Politicians take note!
This guys a doctor 🤯
Hats off to him for speaking up and being courageous but maybe I didn't understand his reasoning behind not being vaccinated? because from what I understand his point was he didn't want to get vaccinated because he is a fit and healthy person and that only the vulnerable should get the vaccine? Even though the purpose of a vaccine isn't just to ensure people live or die
Hold strong Dr and way to go! No Jab!!!
This egg head clown thinks he knows better idiot
It's not a view , it's a fact. Omicron is so slight in it's effect against healthy humans then it's downright tyrannical to enforce this on citizens.
I’ll be skipping that hospital.
why he is the only one who stand up?as i see he is a proper doctor,,,,,good job!!!
Why they don't boost themselves every day and let us in peace?
Interesting that the doctor was enough of an "expert" to work all through covid, but his opinion doesn't count.  I see..🤔🤡
I really admire this doctor for expressing his views, sharing his knowledge and experience in a balanced manner.
Roll up your sleeves sheeps And get boosted up the A$$ every 3 months
When common sense  Meets  Big pharma  Who wins? 😷
Aka he knows it is bull
I’d recommend people to get the jab, but no one should be forced to get it, people are people and can make their own decisions, without having someone shouting down their ear about what they think is best for them
U can tell those women where scared to say what they think he obviously wasn’t good on him
This Health Secretary thinks he knows everything  But he's putting a boris John's performance
Way to go doctor!
very heartwarming to see a news source post this and what a wonderfully calm conversation, i’m someone who lost their job because of the mandate.
When I tell people I've had covid twice and my body will produce an anti body response they think I'm crazy but that just came from a doctors mouth so 🤷
Immunity stays for years in the body it depends upon each human beings system since every body is different
27 times more protection with natural immunity.  Vaccinated are 7 times more likely to get covid then the unvaxxed
Here's another "doctor" ... https://youtu.be/0ts8X3HDtPE
Whats the doctors name? We need to follow this guy and see if he gets pressure to loose his license and back him if needed.  I wish i had power to do something about this crazy times
I love this doctor👌. My gran who is a nurse was forced by her employer to get the vaccine, they told her she’d lose her job if she didn’t. It’s bullying at this point.
Javid Savage is a joke.  The way he dismissed a medical professional like that is disgraceful.
Great job 👍.. don't take the jab, cause the end thereof is destruction?
It’s telling how we must listen to “experts” when they peddle the “correct” narrative but when this doctor comes along, with a medical degree and firsthand experience working with covid patients, we shouldn’t listen to him. Funny, isn’t it?!
Unbelievable. Dismissing it has “his view”  Funny how the guy who was in part one who invented the mRNA tech is saying the same and being censored from social media.   This corruption needs to change.
Savage!
Telling that 6 female staff don't even want to talk about it through fear of losing their jobs what has the country come to this is absolutely shocking
There are so many holes in this consultant's logic and indeed facts. Also i'd prefer a vaccinated doctor to look after my  anaesthetic especially as I'd likely have a co-morbidity simply by me being there. He's no doubt an expert in his field but his field isn't virology. By the way he is not an anti-vaxxer.
Doctor dies of covid after saying he doesn't want it aka killed off. surprised they let this on sky.
They are really trying to crush this doctor now. ... stupid leftist anti freedom government
Again, a politician and a bureaucrat, think he knows best! We elect them. So .... who has the fault? Society needs to be rebuilt from scratch because this is so wrong! That doctor refuses the vaccine using clear data. The politician is telling crap. This is why a meritocracy is a good thing!
God bless the doctor for having the courage to speak out.  We need honest and courageous people like him to help sort out this crazy mess we are in. May God protect all those who are trying to do the right thing, with common sense and following real science rather than the constant fear mongering.
If anyone is interested in learning more about this doctor, his name is dr Steve James and I just watched his latest interview on UnHeard. He’s a legend.
The Narrative of the corrupt Governments across the world is falling apart!!!
Totalitarians - 0  Free English Men - 1
Yuhuuhuuu! I absolutely Love this doctor!!!!!! My type of guy!!!
It is good to hear an honest response from a health care professional, it is good that he got to speak his truth. I hope the government respect his wishes
Fuc... scam!! Well done hns
People do not understand  . World War III is in full swing .... and it is being carried out.... silently. Mark my words.
How on earth did it come this far.
I can see where he is coming from, unfortunately, 80% of covid patients in hospitals are unvaccinated which is putting unacceptable pressure on this numpties colleagues not to mention contributing towards most of the anti covid measures introduced by the government .......I would of liked to of heard his views on this. Personally I think he likes the attention. I'm quite happy for people not to be vaccinated as long as they pay for their own medical care if they need to go into hospital with covid related issues
This doctor is a true hero, best bit of news for two years
I don't care what one a 100 or even 100000 have to say when 5 million say its good only a fool would believe 1%
He is just ignorant...I feel sorry that he is a fellow scientist and doctor...and I bet he doesn't care about the masks either as on an ITU when everyone wears an FFP3 he just uses a simple surgical mask (probably to keep everyone happy and not because he believes in masks)...at least I feel safe that my airplane pilot still believes in wings and engines 😂
This man should have a choice we live in a democracy or not?
Sadjid Jabvid.
Sajid Javid , a bankster who became a health secretary , and who doesn't have a damn clue about his job .. AS JOHNSON , NOT TO BE TRUSTED !!!
But he made sort of a u-turn on Good Morning Britain which is quite frustrating https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh2vWO58sj4
Remember more than 150k people died and if there are no vaccines then what .?  Dr didn’t lose any of his loved once to Covid mmmm
Natural immunity is masterpiece
That is what happens when politicians think they know more than doctors about medication.
I am looking forward to the day these WW NWO.are jailed.
Doctor is not a scientist  ie he is not an expert in vaccinations nor viral infections
Javid pretends to ask people but is not interested in their opinions because he has already made up his mind.
Hero
It's killing people time to jail these   MPs
What a brave man speaking up for his own views
This doctor should be health secretary
This guy knows he is losing his job in April so thought he may aswell say the truth.
How disrespectable of the health Secretary to patronise a fully qualified in medicine doctor.He has forgotten it is our wonderful NHS staff who have worked tirelessly in helping to save thousands of lives throughout this pandemic. They have always worn protective clothing throughout the pandemic,so let them continue to just wear it,It is their choice if they want the vaccine,there should not be consequences for them if they don't want it.Its gone from clapping our NHS staff to threatening them if they don't get jabbed they will get sacked.Its disgusting treatment.
They didn’t contact vaccine experts in the first place, what hope do we have .
Love that he spoke up👏👏👏👏
I am not taking a 'vaccine' that doesn't seem to stop many people getting the virus. Maybe when it's more developed! 👍
The entire government is a farce. Good doctor for questioning the ridiculous vaccination policies.
Where is he hearing it's 2 month?
These politicians were first captured by the military industrial complex and now its big pharma. BLOODY SELLOUT! , there is no scientific foundation for these vaccine mandates😡
I've got no jabs but got my heard immunity like Bono originally said and a heart specialist I know advised.
Dr James is literally explaining how immunity works and sajid javid is like nah I listen to government experts. Academics who could do with some practical hospital experience v a doctor who has to actually deal face to face with infected people. I know who I'd trust more. The doc is not anti vax but pro choice
Man, according to the mainstream media this doctor who have been dead a long time ago.  I also enjoy that this reporter with absolutely no medical knowledge is arguing with a doctor.
Its my body and i should have the right to say no to vaccine
Legend for doing that!!
If a medical professionaI of 10% of the best in the world tells me something.........I listen. If a unqualified political mouthpiece tells me something...... I dont listen. I am very proud of this level of honesty, this man is nothing short of an hero, tell the truth and shame the devil. God bless this man and all those angels of mercy who represent the greatest health system in the world.
Unbelievably embarrassing....shocked this hasn't got more coverage...
Same old song and dance. Who cares anymore, find something else to focus on.
Boom mr health secretary go and enjoy your Christmas party with boris we I dont want your vaccination it shouldn't be made mandatory and even if it is I still wont be getting it
DO NOT GET VACINATED.....IT BIS POSION
Jab the sheep they've earnt it......!!!
We need to get ride of theses politicians not the amazing Doctors and nurses that have survived us so well . Love to them  ❤  shame on this Conservative government, ill never vote for them again 😢
FUTURE BREAKING NEWS.. young Doctor body found near river thames!
The silence from the other members of staff said a million words, basically they did not want to say they never agreed with it. If they did agree I’m sure the would of spoke straight away
Vacine does not works ! Look the numbers !
Doctor who is speaking sense to a politician that has no sense is nonsence..
The word redeploy gets used when NHS staff refuse the vaccine...in short another word for redundancy... Bravo to this Dr for calling it out for what it is...
Good for him. Not everyone needs it. Especially if they've acquired natural antibodies. Mandates are a violation of our human rights. I've had mine but I have compromised immune system and breathing issues. Let ppl decide for themselves!
Fair play!
If anyone has any - could they cite any supporting references please. I’m very curious
HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH HALLELUJAH!!!!!
How the video ended with him saying taking advice from vaccine experts :(
That situation could have came to blows and Jabs for a non jabbed doctor.
These are the people who represent the UK what a shambles. Well done to the Dr or Nurse for speaking up and speaking truth. 👏🏼
So an nhs staff will risk vulnerable people getting covid for more protection for himself
It's hard to take it seriously when in the back ground it looks like that doctor has his Wang out ....
javid is basically shutting him down here. most likely because he knows he is on camera and is reacting to his massive football stadium sized ego. remind me again how many years it takes to train as a politician?????
If these so called leaders had a fraction of this doctors character we wouldn't be in this mess
"From people who are vaccine experts" Says who? WHO? The same world health organisation that fabricated swine flu to SELL a stock pile of vaccines, made multi billion dollar contracts to the EU, UK and USA then they were exposed 5 years after the stress & trauma they caused.... gtfo, sooner we eat the rich the better.
the nhs were the angels at the beginning of this scamdemic, now they are the devil incarnate, but take a look at the plp who disagree with this highly trained doctor, who spent many years studying to actually be a doctor , all fake , politicians are not doctors, a health secretary who has no clue about medicine!!!, taking the piss outa all of us, ty for speaking up sir, the truth will out
This right here ladies and gentlemen is a real doctor , one that knows what's best for the body , not ones that are willing to just read of there scripts to keep there teslaa fully charged
So many officials and politicians globally need to be held accountable for their crimes against humanity The people need to demand they are all held to trials in international court.
This government does NOT take the best advice they can. They have been taking advice from Bill Gates who has no medical qualifications and is a self professed eugenisist. The ministers all seem to have conflicts of interest. Hancock is a part owner of a vaccine company, Patrick Vallance has millions invested in GSK, Whitty and Hancock received millions in grants from Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Doctors have been dismissed for speaking out against this crime and there have been substantially more of them than 'government scientists.'Much of their dodgy legislation has been based on extremely distorted predictions from a discredited statistician who like many of the proponents of the legislation have been seen ignoring their own guidelines.
"Anaesthetist thinks he knows better than epidemiologists  about vaccination efficacy."
What a complete knob .....and I'm not talking about the doctor
The "vaccine experts", are farting in the wind, and preying upon anyone who complains of the smell, threatening their livelihoods should they refuse to donate their body to science. Perhaps requiring vaccination of people with comorbidity issues, should be the focus?
Mandatory vaccination will NEVER be justified.  If the NHS suffers department closures as a result of the governments medical fraud then it is the government who are to be held accountable. Freedom to choose must be protected.  More like Dr Steve James please!
Government takes advice from "Vaccine Experts" ie:  "Vaccine Sellers"   Well done to the doctors SPEAKING UP
That Doctor is getting fired
Watch them gun down this man in the future. He’s fucked up their evil agenda. Good Morning Britain presenters & doc Hilary have already tried to make him feel guilty. They’re so upset with him. We can see through that
Somebody give that doctor a medal
Well said N your view is legendary
Excellent points made.
There are many including informed professionals who do NOT agree with this "vaccine" and see the negatives yet the news has mainly been bias only showing a one sided view. I respect news companies not only showing one sided views otherwise for me it becomes well suspicious. Respect to this doctor yet the silence of those cowads who were first asked showed they too agree.
Well done Doctor by talking against the guidance with some sense now causing the anti-vax nutters to come out with their idiocy
So very proud of Dr Steve James. I stand with him and other NHS staff
Changed the definition to label this therapeutic a "vaxine."
I better download this video before it gets taken down mysteriously.
Sajid Javid 😂
As a fellow nurse I feel slightly frustrated by this group who had a golden opportunity to roast the health Secretary but when presented with the opportunity sat around lost for words, come on folks, no wonder us nurses get shafted at every turn by the gov. Take a leaf out your medical colleagues book, grow a set and speak out more. We are great at sounding off in the staff room or our nurses forums but failed to speak out when it counted.
I’m with the guy on the FRONTLINE ALMOST EVERYDAY FOR 12 AND A HALF HOUR SHIFTS! Nailing his job while still getting underpaid. He’s know better. He IS the expert
We definitely need more people like this doctor to come forward to  discuss these issues. His honesty about are we going to keep getting boosters every couple of months was informative.
And that's ur view. Sky news report about those camps and protests. Time for each government of the world to stand trial at the Hague.
Nice one for standing up for the truth
Doctors missing the point. A law would last for a long time, including when vaccine come around that's been adapted for Omicron variant. By which point he might not have antibodies and then is at an increased risk of transmitting covid compared with those who are vaccinated. "the science is not there"... I wonder how this man even qualified if he doesn't see how wrong that is. And Javid should've done much better too!
Can anyone name any of these “scientists” ?
To mandate something in this way needs far more than it being a preferred option. If it was overwhelming or essential, then come back and we can talk.
Only from the Horses mouth and still flopped it tried of everything
He's been bullied on ITV Good morning Britain ..They gave him the "opportunity" of saying that he is not antivaxx, he just thinks it shouldnt be for everyone, and the presenter tried to undermine him that why would he risk his job just for a jab. Incredible. The woman is okay with coercion and bribe.  Humanity is doomed.
Great point doctor, every month boost jab everyone. What does it mean vaccine is useless.
So patronising Sajid...
Protect this doctor at all costs. Please and thanks.
It’s sad to see hospitals full of unvaccinated people, taking away capacity that could be used for other things like fighting cancer.
Haha the health secretary is struggling!😅…but doctor’s common sense won!
The science is not strong enough! True!
Sad to see an actual doctor giving advice and some idiot "leader" disregarding him cause it means LESS control
Someone protect that man.
There's a sort of north Korea vibe about all this vaccine bullshit.  Those nurses seemed to not want to say anything about it.  Well done to the young doctor for having the balls to speak up.
I would argue that getting in contact with the virus offers better immunity than getting vaccinated.
Qualified Medical Professional: It isn’t going to achieve practical effect. (Translation: It’s an exercise in futility.) Government drone #17: We’ll take that under advice. (Translation: I’ve already forgotten about this conversation.)
He is one in a million. Well done Doc not sure why those nurses kept quiet.
A lot of people here seem to be missing his point. He's not refusing vaccines cos he's bravely standing against the tyranny of Big Pharma, he rightfully puts across that he doesn't need vaccines as he has antibodies already in his body from being infected by the actual virus.
Why is he as a doctor wearing mask. ?
This doctor is a joke  He is one of the people spreading the infection to patients.
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Over 90% of his colleagues don't agree with him.
It the vaccine has stopped being effective at 2 months…it’s not really that good at it’s job! Let the Drs do theirs!
That's really embarrassing for a doctor. Setting a poor example too.
Proper⚓
Take a bow doc, take a bow 👏👏👏
How is this a democratic decision? Get vaccinated or get fired? I have had 3 jabs based on my own personal decision but I hate to see people get forced into something by the government who doesn’t event understands medicine? We need doctors to be in charge of the NHS not random politicians!!!
brave brave man for speaking out. We need to hear from more people who feel similarly, rather than marginalising them - a real chance to air opinions, rather than be dictated to. Good, decent, honest, qualified, human beings having to choose in this way between their vocation and their own right to decide re vaccine. Unthinkable position to be faced with.
Can't BELIEVE the video cut off with that goverment stooge having the last word brushing over that doctor's words... 'fackseen' experts are paid by the pound, liturally. Also the way the stooge turns to the woman saying the doc's words are 'just an opinion' "and what's yours?" 🙄🙄
What an absolute legend. Hero!
Preach
So one doctor... an anaesthetist, is an expert on the  virus!? As it is, his comments on the time for effectiveness is not totally correct. The logic of getting advice from an anaesthetist on epidemiology is like getting a glider pilot to fly a 380...
Standing with this doctor, 100%. Any talk of mandatory vaccination is a disgrace. Look how scared the nurses are to have an opinion. Covid has created a culture of fear and tyranny. If the media stopped speaking about it we wouldn’t even know it existed. The whole thing has become a cult.
This is what smart doctors REALLY think. They are being bullied into submission and can’t criticize the vaccine or covid policy without the threat of losing their job. If more doctors took a stand and didn’t comply, the hospital systems would be screwed. Who’s going to treat patients if there aren’t enough doctors and nurses. They need to quit being cowards and do the right thing. The fact that Fauci and all the shills like him never discuss naturally acquired immunity is a disgrace and destroyed all of their credibility a long time ago.
If doctor won't who is in the eye of the storm why should I then
Good for this man ! We need to stand up for our selves
What an absolute dickhead! Should be sacked!
GMTV turned off all comments to his interview this morning and barely let him have a reply to the stooge that is Dr Hilary.  Just saying! 🤦
Some boy speakin up
health secretary has no IDEA what TF he is doing
This doctor is talking so much sense  and forcing the NHS staff to have the vaccine is against eveything we stand for! A year ago the government was clapping them now its turned to jabbing them. Every NHS staff member who doesnt want this should simply not go to work then we'll see what the government do then. I have the same views as this doctor ive had covid so i dont need a vaccine or a booster when is this BS going to stop
Like a boss!
Based
Trying to talk common sense to a complete RETARD,... good luck with THAT,.. 😵‍💫
Until he gets unstuck and is off work for 2 weeks when he gets it on SSP and then his partner gets it and hes off for another 2 weeks on SSP so smart!
Cheeky kunts if he don't want it he don't want it how can they sack him for it corrupt cheeky conservative maggots
Docs with any integrity should stand against this scam
Should be health sec
hear intelligence
Great Dr speaking the truth from his heart, see the politician g riggling for ground...and trying to silence him and belittle him to look knowledgeable, I believe he has sold out..and following the governments agenda..good for the brave Dr who knows the the truth and speaks it!!
God Bless this Dr. and everyone who has common sense about this bullshit! (vaccine).
I am so happy to hear this!! What a joke, trying to tell a doctor about medicine!!! This is common sense and goes against the scare tactics. The vaccine is a joke. People seem to think its a cure, it isn't no where near
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ik6cxFBbBw&ab_channel=UnHerd - Excellent interview with Dr. Steve James who explains all
The man asking questions says 'we take advice from the vaccine experts so the doctor isn't an expert that knows more than him. Vaccines are meant to last years, not a couple of weeks.
This should be played out over and over again until the decision is reversed its a disgrace to take away there jobs after they trained hard to get the job and worked hard during this pandemic justice for the unvaccinated doctors I am sick of hearing the unvaccinated people being bashed and it's about time we heard genuine stories like this to raise awareness of the government's stupidity in these decision
Won't get jabbed. Will still wear a mask. I get why he's refusing the jab but don't be a hypocrite 🤣
That took a lot of guys. Other nurses and doctors couldn’t speak up otherwise they’d be judged by their colleagues or even lose their job.
Fair play to the Dr
Vaccine experts yeah right they all got stocks from the companies so getting rich by telling everyone to take the jab a couple times a year
And the mask thing doesn't work either.
I'm not a doctor but I too thought the same, that I've had Covid so I already have antibodies. I was forced to get 2 vaccinations for my job (I need to work). I resent this police' state attitude.  Clearly this doctor talks sense and clearly current vaccines can't keep up with the speed at which covid is mutating. Some people will continue to die and the fittest will survive. The sooner this is accepted, the sooner we can get on with living.
Good for him xx
NOBODY SHOULD BE FORCED TO TAKE ANY VACCINE! NUREMBERG CODE SPRINGS TO MIND
Fcuk 🖕🏻 Boosters  Fcuk 🖕🏻 Vaccine's  Here in South Africa 🇿🇦 my family, friends and colleagues haven't contracted Covid or any Variant thereof nor did any of us get Vaccinated.  I am speaking for 56x people ages from 21 to 83
6,500 languages in the world. 6,500. And this gentleman of a Doctor chose to speak FACTS.
Health secretary is obviously an idiot!
Recently had my antibodies tested. After 11 months still have full robust antibodies.  So I call B S on them waning after 2 months.
Javid's clearly being a knob here and can only imagine that's not the answer he was expecting lol. I generally agree with the doctor from a personal liberty viewpoint but his rationale (from a medical perspective) for not getting a jab is weak, especially after watching his GMB interview
😠 #### u health secretary
WHAT A CHAD
oh, he played the "vaccine experts" card 😂
This doctor is an absolute CHAD.
People says they listen to doctors, experts and scientists. But only the ones saying what they want to hear💩
This Doctor will not be touching me. I want only vaccinated Doctors
Javid "we take our advice from experts", what a way to talk to a doctor who knows more about medical issues than Javid ever will. just shows he did'nt want to listen no matter what!!
See how he didnt know how to handle a man with such an informative view   and just agreed with evry word he said....now hes way off trying to force evrybody else to take it
Some one buy this guy a beer. Thanks for being brave enough infront of the vile media. Salute!
Well said! Stick to your guns, they can't sack everyone!! The govt are an absolute disgrace regarding these ridiculous vaccine mandates!!!
Great stuff here im not getting a vaccination either....it goes against my religion...
Anything non pro vax is always argued against and ridiculed even though what this guy says makes perfect sense.
It's also pretty obvious the other staff Javid is desperately looking to for moral support aren't entirely on board given how they leave him out to dry.
This is never going to stop until scared dumbasses stop fueling shady politicians.
It was fully staged but why are we being allowed to see this ? It could be screened and censored if they chose
Surprised Sky News allowed this story. I hope the Dr doesnt lose his job. We need people like him to fight this nonsense.
We should demand to see vacancies experts Bank accounts and all their off shore accounts will be clear for everyone what's going on ❤️  Where is division there is weakness!  Think together stay together and we will overcome any obstacole says nature 💪🏼🙌
The new health Secretary right there, with a medical background. Just imagine.
A physician with balls. Nice to see.
Amazing that the health secretory just disregarded the advice of a doctor
He ain’t going on holiday anytime soon 🥺😐
I'm going to listen to a doctor end of.
Ohh man he's convinced millions of people to not get vaccinated
These fools that believe it's a vaccine..  IT'S NOT A VACCINE!!!!!!!!!!!!
People, come watch a bureaucrat ask a medical professional for their opinion and then completely ignoring his good arguments. We officially live in the upside down. Who in their right mind would trust these morons with their health?
Sensed that the Health Secretary felt awkward during that conversation.
He will be sacked by the weekend lol
This Doctor is a hero 🦸‍♂️
Well that’s the last time we will see him then
Its all a political fairytale. Anyone who takes advice from the government regarding forced injections needs to question their morales and reasoning.
The world has been sold a lie !
Totaly agree with that doctor.. Natural immune system is far better than jabs that stop natural exposure
Say it's his views lol when he literally said the science isn't strong enough lol
king 🤴🏼
I don't want this anti vax clown treating me
How Javid tried to completely dismiss his comments like the slimy, little politician weasel he is. They really are the worst that the human species can offer and they're in the driving seat. It's just crazy.
Sacked
Mini me doesn't look too happy
Why does no1 mention the professional athletes that are dropping like flys. This jab is unlicensed and not properly tested. The whole thing stinks. It's like living in communist Russia.
Vaccine is an absolute farce, junk food and alcohol is the biggest killer and the biggest strain on the NHS. Covid is ridiculous,  money making racket
What a f joke remember inbreds fascism always ends in genocide.
The "vaccine experts" comment is absolutely hilarious. Same as saying "professional lego builder".
I had sars cov 1 in 2003 and was immune. Forced to be jabbed to work in France, I lost my natural immunity to an induced lack of durable immunity. It's just idiot.
Javid getting ratioed in this comment section and would love for YT to re instate the like to dislike tally for public view. GUARANTEED TO BE out ratioed there too. Well done Dr!!!! Fxcking the ex banker!!!
Funny that so many people think this guy's views are the gospel truth without even knowing how many years of experience he has and how factual his information is or even how good a medic he is. Doctors are not gods, they can make mistakes/ have erroneous beliefs too. This guy has probably half the medical experience of many doctors and scientists who have designed the vaccine protocols (and have had the vaccine themselves).  Besides, it is already known that some people do not develop significant amounts of antibodies even after having the disease, so what he is saying could mislead many into thinking they dont need or the vaccine. Also i think it was rude of him to take the spotlight from the nurses, of course they may have not had the confidence to speak up right away and probably were still thinking of an answer that wouldnt offend colleagues, im sure they dont talk to politicians and appear on tv regularly!
By vaccine experts he means pharmaceutical companies then ...
Legend
An actual doctor.
Get it up yee
Sajid is like one of the characters from the movie Don't look up.
Sky news the home of non bias reporting
Fight them back, for they have no idea !  Vaccination must remain a free choice !
What an honourable man this dr is. That's why javid didn't get it. Not many ministers have ever heard of honour. And he's gonna be sacked. ? What a joke.
The health secretary acts as a salesman and someone it's not buying what he is selling.  😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
Look at the background guys...... It's clearly green screen.
Vaccine experts
👏 👏 👏
That's not just views, it's the false sciences proving vaccines to be good
“That’s your view”   What a terrible uneducated minister. I’ve heard he doesn’t even have a medical degree.
60k Likes to 1.5k Dislikes... its good to know the majority of us are in agreement here!
Well said doctor!
That’s a very good point front the nhs staff he was the only one who spoke when the other just kept quite.Good man
Stop Covid business!!! No Green pass!!!
A Doctor with a spine and a set of balls. Nothing but respect for this man. He is risking his career for speaking common sense.
♥️🌹♥️👑
So if I had a booster 4 weeks ago I need another right... I've had covid 3 times and I had no vaccine I'm 52... Whats going on here.. This world's unreal. Is it a dream cos if it is please wake me up..
integrity
0:38 “Doctor who isn’t taking the vaccine” ( THE SCIENCE IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH )…,,,  THE PHARMA SALESMAN(JAVID)  0:40 thats your oppinion 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤣🤦‍♂️🤣   We teally live in the matrix now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🍿🤣
Who are the vaccine experts ?
Good for the doctor. All my family who have been vaccinated have had covid. I am not vaccinated, not had it and will not get vaccinated.
'That's your view', what a typical political asswipe seeking career progression at any price.   Well said Doctor 👏
what a hero
I’m not vaccinated and I won’t have it.
The creepiest part of that video is the five nurses who were all too scared to answer the question.
The fear in his voice for speaking the truth was utterly saddening, what an incredibly articulate explanation for why this nonsense should not be allowed to happen
This British Indian health secretary not fit for the job and not qualified for it, he doesn't got any clue regarding the jab what's so ever. I agree with the doctor as humans we need our rights to refuse this dodge jabb.
Love this....well done to the DOCTOR on his honestly and fundamental facts .. 👌
👏👏👏
If I had covid I wouldn’t have taken the two jabs. Would make no sense.
Good on this doctor
He is saying the right thing.
Javid to trained doctor "that's your opinion" Dirsespectful, dismissive and f**kin' rude! Tw*t
This is the guy charging £500 a consultation in his private clinic, another 2 jobber !
At last,somebody is standing up to the real fascists....
Al doctor le faltó decir, cuán riesgoso sería vacunarse mensualmente.... Estarse inyectando  sustancias extrañas en el cuerpo de forma tan seguida podría traer un perjuicio a la salud, en vez de una protección.
the doctor  represented me when the irish  PM with retard face (milk seller) told me vaccines are good for me....
well done
Godbless the Doctor 🙏🏾
By taking advice from « vaccine experts » he meant the ones paid by Pfizer and Moderna and the other big pharma companies.  Just for some clarification.
I salute this guy  javid needs to fk off back to where he came from
Brave doctor
My smoke buddy only yday joked about how he can lick windows for 8 weeks because he can't catch it for 8 weeks, lol
A banker that speaks about health.
"Vaccine Experts"!? 🤣 Lol. How about common sense experts?!
Enormous respect and appreciation to the Doctor. Bravo! ✊👏
Well spoken the brave and courageous Doctor. To add to your point natural immune system is above the 3rd or up to the 6th jabs or what ever numbers of vaccination they are heading to. Israel is on the 4th as of now, obvious something is not right...
Make this man prime minister! I’ll vote ✅
Haha the statement at the end, keeping people in fear by reassuring that their staff is vaccinated (aka your fear is totally valid and keep at it). And yes your fear is valid but I encourage people to deal with it at a more sustainable level than restricing people freedom, forcing vaccinations and projecting it at a cause outside of themselves preferable not on a precieved out-group.
vaccine experts = vaccine companies i.e. big pharma... stop right there
good for him.  Unfortunately the real "Vaccine experts" are typically censored, and the other ones are politically or financially motivated, so can't really trust them.
hero
The science speaks for itself and Savid its not rocket science!
Vaccination experts! = Sales people!?
Funny to see UK. allow scammy India working in UK. government... 😁
A reporter thinks he knows better than a doctor... who sees reality every single day... what brainwashed retards
UK not pursuing 4th shot over concerns to immune system.  Listen to the doc!
Big up this man for speaking his mind 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Lord protect this honest Dr for standing for the truth. I feel there is no longer human rights which the UN and other activists used to talk about. Why forcing people to get the vaccine.
Not enough Doctor's of this quality. And will be even less at this rate. A finance man trying to belittle a Doctor whilst being given the job of health minister 🤯
I accepted the vaccination, not out of fear of Covid, but out of the fear that my freedom would be taken away from me if I did not comply. I'm 23, I did not want to have the right to live the life of a lad in his early twenties to be revoked.  Now? Well, now it's a completely different story, a completely different mindset. At this point I am outright belligerent, to the point that I would love to find a way to become UNVACCINATED, purely out of spite in the face of the rampant hypocrisy and fearmongering.
"That's your opinion" so years of experience in healthcare and 2 years experience in working an ICU is an opinion. That man needs to be kept away from any position of power he's very dangerous.
Whilst the jabs are very obviously working and doing what they're supposed to, there is still no way any jab of any kind no matter how proved, effective or approved should be mandatory for anyone.
Wouldn't even let djadiv into the Building the useless C*nt  Props to all the nurses R.I.P 🙏 to all lives lost under this atrocious Government
If I am in the hospital, I don’t want anyone near me who hasn’t been vaccinated.
The nhs worker said “that’s the science” and the other guy proceeds to say “that’s your view” hahaha no pal science is science! If my view of gravity was of disbelief I wouldn’t just float away into space would I.
From the beginning of this crap with coronavirus there is no science in anything what was done at all .
Who are all these people telling doctors to get jabs? Makes me question the knowledge of doctors themselves.
The Vaccine experts are the likes of Pfizer, the ones making all the money from it.  I'm honestly surprised this actually has been broadcast.  Maybe there is a change to the narrative?
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
He is a professional Doctor and he has spoken the Truth.
He defo listens to Joe Rogan
He won the debate period.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
why is he patronising a doctor for?
Well that's his career bolloxed.
👏👏👏
Javid is beyond arrogant, arguing with a literal doctor and dismissing his opinion on a medical matter! The clowns are running the circus, that's why we have reached this point.
They forced care homes to take vaccination and they lost staff.   Now the NHS… these bumholes never listen!
Salute to this doctor!
Mr Sajid Javid  needs to back down a bit... and let Drs speak up!!!
Javid said at the end this is for the people who are vaccine experts......the same ones that are making mega money. I would say this medically qualified doctor is also an expert giving that he's worked in hospital right through the pandemic
Good for him!
The asshl is saying that's your view. It's not a view, it's a fact from life testing.
We don't pharmaceutical doctors, we have plenty of doctors who don't believe in that garbage vaccine
https://youtu.be/qqWtwedwIbVM https://youtu.be/qWtwedwIbVM
FUN FACT!  By the same time next year, I will still be covid vaccine free!
We need more of this I take me hat off to this guy weldone sir 👏
We can use those scientists and doctors  are not for the vaccines and tell them to open up their hospitals and clinics!!!!
Brilliant
He doesn’t disagree with vaccines, he disagrees with the need for HIMSELF to be vaccinated due to having antibodies.  I also sense that he doesn’t like being told he has to. I’ve been vaccinated, but disagree that they should be mandated.  The science is not settled on this Javid. Should we be expected to have 6 boosters a year? I don’t believe we should
Sky news gets some legitimate "likes" for once
Please where is the go-fund me page for this Dr. He deserves support when the clueless party govt. finally acts on mandatory vaccine
Top man 🤣 so before he's comments he's word was gossip and any one that said other wish was stupid 🤔 now  he's comments don't fit there agenda he's stupid and shouldn't be listen to 🤭🤣🤷🏼NOW THAT'S CONTROL AT IT'S FINEST 🤣
I'm in the same position as this doctor...he is right of course!!!!so called "vaccine experts "are business people!!!!natural immunity has to be recognized!!!!!
LOL from advise of “vaccine experts” this health secretary is bought and paid for lmao can other doctors not do research and be right? Idiots these people are
I trust the qualified medical professional that doctor is over the ex-banker interviewing him any day.
Wow, this Dr. is a brave one. I do salute his courage.
So he is saying that 'transmission is ONLY lowered for 8 weeks or POSSIBLY less with Omnicron' - ifs and maybes are the only support to his argument. He doesn't care that he can transmit the virus during 8 weeks to someone and possibly kill him. Good job Mr Doctor.
"There are three classes of people:   those who see;    those who see when they are shown;   those who do not see."   Leonardo da Vinci
Have watched this doctor on GMB tried to discredit him went to comment section GUEST WHAT COMMENTS TURN OFF big tec shutting down people's thoughts and discussion  Just like the other Doctor malone who partly created the vaccine who states causes more harm than good against a virus which seems to attack the most vulnerable he's been shut down of Twitter. CAN'T MAKE THIS  BS UP SILENCE THE TRUTH
In April anyone in nhs who has not had the vaccine will face dismissal, someone at my wifes hospital has already been told this after a meeting for her not having the vaccine.
I wonder when he administers anesthetics to a patient does he go with the "probably" will work theory?
This doctor is no expert and making a xomment with Zero experience is so irresponsible
the only time I have liked a Sky news video
Well done to all doctors that stand up and speak facts
💯🇲🇽
Well done that man
The way the health secretary is dismissing the facts is astounding. Monthly booster jabs for frontline workers to maintain a higher level of defence against covid is ridiculous; I truly wonder what would happen if nhs staff banded together and refused to allow the no vaccine no work mandate to come Into action. This is about logic not emotions.
I admire this doctor. I would however be very interested in why he doesn't want the vaccine. Is it because he doesn't need it, or is there another reason as well?
Bravo! Finally ! Its so good to hear the truth!
He didn't say "he won't, he said he doesn't want to".
“Drs” logic is flawed, by his logic, no vaccine is needed because if we all get Covid, we’ll all have immunity…um no.
Loved how the 4 nurses remained quite and then this guys speaks up. Really admire his courage and determination to get the message across.
Interesting that the only person being against vaccinations is also the one not wearing an n95 mask... You'd think doctors would take a global pandemic more seriously, but I guess nurses are more on the front-lines seeing the actual effects.
What a wonderful doctor to stand up for what's right!
Quiet, calm strength right there. Not only are we losing health professionals---- we're losing the BEST health professionals. In the end we'll get stuck with mindless drones who will commit far greater atrocities against humanity because the "experts" told them.
Great, a new poster boy for the anti-vaxxers. Let’s see how much he profits from this with his own private practice offering pseudoscience and non evidence based practices 🙄
The guy has antibodies against something that has a 99% survival rate, imagine the new survival rate, much less dangerous than driving a car, should we start banning cars now?
The truth is plain to see Thé truth demains thé truth The vaccine is obsolete We are living in a world destined to disappear from lack of trees and faith in YHWH And all we are being forced is a New religion whose Idol is a needle
Your watching the WORLD FALL........    SEEK THE LORD JESUS CHRIST WHILE THERE'S YET TIME BECAUSE TIME IS ALMOST OVER!!!
How many of the 90% who accepted the vaccine were coerced or complied out of fear?
I hope this guy stands his ground and doesn't give into that bs...
Boosting every 2 x months is actually a better way to keep on enriching the “vaccine experts” No one will make a profit of the doctors “natural immunity” option.
This chap should be the Health Secretary.
What does this doctor know anyway?  Trying to tell a banker how to treat people! the nerve!
He really said "we're going to listen to the vaccine experts".... like did he not see who he was talking about? Where did he think he was, the jelly bean factory?
we had  so many much more dangerous viruses in the past and people was never force to take any medicine !!!! i dont belive this politicks and there PROPAGANDA !!!!! is a big SCANDEMIC
I will be very surprised if he keeps his job
They like the power and Don't want to lose it now and their making billions of pounds out of it
He just has no technical reply. He doesn't give any arguments back to the doctor, that is a man who knows nothing about the words he is saying. Good on the doctor
The way the nurse's went silent says they no the vaccine is dangerous to certain people
Medical professionals take issue with this jab. But they can’t talk because they are not epidemiologists? This is madness!
this world become a JOKE  ..novak dojkovic is danger to australia ..prezident macron want to piss off unvacinated people this is crazy !!!!! bravo DOCTOR !!!
brave doctor !!!!! safe a lot of brainwasched sheeps  from taking more poison
I took the Covid vaccine. He actually made me regret it now!.
RESPECT 🌷
From the arguement in this short clip, I can't see the doc as anti-vac. He is against the impracticality of monthly jab. Also, being a doctor that face covid-19 probably gave him enough immunity just as much as vaccine could.   That being said, his later argument cannot be applied to everyone elsewhere. It is valid to be applied to him.   My personal view would be he should just take the shot so that his patients would have some peace in mind while being treated there. After all he is in medical field.
Wake up
To be fair I would always choose unvaxed doctor, because if he was an ordinary dispensable doctor he would have been fired immediately. If he’s unvaxed and still have a job, that means he’s useful and without him this medical organisation would be screwed.  Just like doctor House wasn’t fired because he was breaking the hospital rules.
Fair play to this Dr handled it in the right way with facts.
Did Sajid really say he’ll take advice from “vaccine experts”??? This shows how unqualified he is to be the health secretary because what the doctor said made complete and utter sense to me and I don’t even have a medical degree. Such a disgrace and BRAVO to the doctor for speaking up 👏🏾
8000 doctors  in Greece are not working because they didn't want the jab .
Javid is hopeless, an ignorant and self serving  numpty. Pointless discussing he needs sacking.
Well Dr for not being a sheep and being a wolf
I’m vaccinated I believe in it but i feel doctors shouldn’t be forced to become vaccinated if they dont want to
Imagine an epidemiologist going into his ITU ward and telling how to manage his patients.
Im aginst the vax. There is no science. They say to trust the science, but real science is questioning.
Wowww... Wonderful 😍❤️😍❤️😍💃💃💃💃💃.. loved it !!!
Congrats doctor!  Thanks for having the courage to voice your convictions!  Obviously caught the media crew off guard!  Well done!   We need more voices that combat the ridiculous lies that the media in particular is feeding the nations!  Stop the insanity!  Allow the truth to be told!!!
But why does he not want a vaccine? Just because he is ok? Smart arse.
Wake up people of the world
Respect to this guy
And he concluded that he will take his advice from the vaccine experts. The same ones who got us into this mess?? Moron
This doctor is very courageous to speak out like this. I don’t agree and have taken both vaccines, booster and yearly influenza.  We need more clarity from vaccines experts on this discussion in video.
well done for undermining the vaccine campaign
Well said lad people need to wake up i have leukaemia and refused to have it because it basically triggers illnesses and i dont want to go yet im 42 xx
Im glad someone has spoken up, i was told by my consultant that i couldn't be put on the Transplant list without the vaccinations. The NHS and government is using underhanded tactics to make people take the vaccine
I wouldn’t trust the health minister as far as I can see him.
I am a doctor. And he is an idiot. Surely he knows that 80% of iTU patients are non vaccinated. Twit
👍👍👍 thanks for talking sense doctor
Without the vaccine we would probably still be in lockdown…
I know that doctor was being nice. He had way worse things to say in his mind
People who think the vaccine is good = Bots🤖
Hmmmmm I not pro or anti vax, however if the shot is essentially useless at defending against C19 after a couple of months……………………
The nurses did not want to give their honest answer
Why the hell did I get the first jab 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ should have just waited .. now im contemplating  on whether to have the second one, and possible boosters , or just leave it there ? Any insights people ??
Gandhi - "just say no"
Velaccine experts... more like vaccine pushers.
DUMB ASSES WEARING MASK..
He Just told us the truth
damn stupic little man bullshit politician! That doctor is spot on!
Hero
The world is full of spineless scumbags on the take.
Javid did want to hear the facts from a consultant
He has intelligence, integrity and courage. We could do with some of that in others who have positions of power.
He appeals to authority when challenged.  They "take advice from the vaccine experts."  This whole thing is a sham and deep down he knows it.
A man with a conscience.
Brilliant!  The doc is a hero for providing a clear stand point of why he is not taking it.   The health minister ought to be ashamed to even enter into an argument and just jibberingabout vane of natural immunity.  My severe handicapped son has 18 months antibodies when tested in Oct 2021.  8 weeks Delta. Less with omicron  "We take the best advice we can... from vaccine experts"  What bollocks!
Well done Dr.!!!
got to say, this man is an anaesthetist, not an immunologist.
None of the people who don't want this injection are antivax!!! This is NOT a vaccination...get over it! I have had every single vaccination, and I believe absolutely in vaccination...but I do not believe in this injection! A vaccine expert would never call this injection a vaccine...unless of course they have been paid to do so.
Should get sacked then.  His reasons were factually incorrect, so he’s not even making his excuses based on a foundation of evidence.  All he’s done is feed the rabid, deluded anti-vaxxer’s, conspiracy theories.
Takes a strong man to redress the balance and bring back the freedom to speak.
So in other words what the physician says is he developed immunity so no need to vaccinate,  but he needs infected people around to keep up his immunity level. So keep infecting. Very nice doctor
Well done for standing up for himself and millions of other's not only in the nhs but the public, its not a selfish act what he and many others are doing but it is selfish to have the right to a choice taken away and that's the point "do it or lose it" is a disgusting act and it should not be a thing as I'm sure millions of others have had no choice but to bow down and be walked over.
A banker disagreeing with a medical professional about medical decisions.  🤡🌍
Clownville 🤣🤣🤣🤣😃
The labelling of the anaesthetist as an "anti-vax" and everyone else who doesn't want to be vaccinated is just pathetic.
A true NHS hero! This qualified doctor knows the medical science which proves that natural immunity is at least 17 times more effective than the current vaccine technology. The latest peer reviewed study suggests that it may be as much as 25 times more effective. This qualified doctor also knows that the current vaccines carry known side effects and future unknown side effects. He is absolutely correct in his assessment that he does not need to be compulsorily medicated and therefore he should not risk his future health without firm and peer reviewed scientific proof that it is absolutely necessary on medical grounds alone.
It's not true that 90-/- of staff are vaccinated, go and show this message at the end to those who are vaccinated, we those unvaccinated are not interested
So proud of this man
Well done, tell him to get as many jabs as he want not to force people idiot
Rat at the end did appeal by authority, which is often considered a fallacy.  We take the best advice we can blah blah.  No counter valid argument
Here Here Dr James.
“We take the best advice we can” while someone is giving the best advice he has heard 😂 if your eyes aren’t woken up to the world by now and what is really going on then nothing will.
Unfortunately the Dr wasn't factually correct on some of his own points which is sad tbh, and this will now be used by vaccine conspiracists
Good
brave, brave man
I think the 3-4 second awkward silence and then laugh from the nurses when he asked about compulsory vaccination just prove that they more than likely felt the same as the doctor but daren't speak up
Yeah they wasn’t prepared for him to say that at all😂😂😂 Well done Dr whoever for actually standing up and making Sky look like the mugs they’re
Why is a guy who's only job is to provide anaesthetic trying to act like he knows more than expert virologists 😂😂😂 this is like a mechanic trying to tell a NASA engineer how to build a rocket 😂😂😂
Idiot politicians clearly don’t listen to real science, just convenient science
Não quer e um direito que lhe assiste. Não é parigo para ninguém por não ser vacinado NÃO PEGA A DOENCA A NINGUEM. Senão  expliquem-me porque os vacinados contraem a doença  e morrem? Confio mais nele que em qualquer um,pois será  uma pessoa muito mais cautelosa em relação  a contrair a doença.
The minister had to get childish lol
There is always that person who wants to be different and think its cool. Goodluck to this 'tryin to be different doctor'. Sorry but majority of doctors dont share your views. Everyone is entitled to their opinion though...
Quite right ✅ it's his choice ...I've just been told I'm classed as unvaccinated and I have had 2 ...didn't have booster due to complications
Just out of interest did the doctor give a reason for not wanting the jab?  I’d be interested to hear why he is so passionately against it.
I really feel for the doctors and nurses who'll lose their jobs when vaccines become mandatory. Javid says he follows the science but he doesn't... He follows the opinion that supports his agenda. I think the NHS and care system will suffer deeply as a result.
kill all covid psycho facists
Does anyone know where he's getting that number of the vaccine only reducing transmission for 8 weeks? Anywhere else I look it's at least 6 months for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.  I don't know if I'd want my mom to be treated by an unvaccinated member of the NHS. He might be young and fit and asymptomatic if he has it, but she's over sixty.
The doctor still didn’t give a reason for Not getting the vaccine. He only spoke of the limited benefits. Like it’s not that much effort to get jabbed.
I'm only here to laugh at junkie tinfoil comments 😂  #executetheunvaccinated
I am 100% behind the doctor well done for speaking up 👍🏻 it’s about time the government started to listen to those who are actually on the front line.. and not the ones sat behind a deck and causing havoc. Well done to that doctor total respect ✊🏻
Real news for a change. The tide must be turning.
What a legend 👏
From someone in the trenches "the science isnt strong enough". Simple
The government back in 2020 told people to wash their hands because they had hardly any masks then it was all guns blazing wear a mask now they have this vaccine that they made from the first strain of the virus it’s showing it’s not as effective on a different strain so why would it be effective for future Strains for omicron u need to have had a booster and that will not fully protect u ,u may or may not feel the symptoms as much as someone who hasn’t had the vaccine so why scare people into having a vaccine that’s not fully tested and by tested I mean what are the effects after five years ten years how does this vaccine interfere with our immune systems in the future why is it that health secretary couldn’t listen to the views of a medical professional who had worked the field whilst this has all been going on hope this video goes viral
I respect this Dr for his brave response and being honest like them others who portrait them lies and deceiving the nation.
Very brave man
ITS NOT HIS VIEW ITS SCIENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love how any mp that goes to visit a hospital has their sleeves rolled up as if they are “hard at work “
Good lad
Well done that man! True courage
Yes exactly
Kings college won't call it a vaccine lmao it's a jab, the shits starting to hit the fan!!
The most important video of 2022 so far, thankyou thankyou thankyou to this doctor for speaking up!
I applaud this doctor's stance and his clear explaexplanation of such and even more so enlightening all that the booster only provides protection for just about 2 months. Health secretary was prepared for an all yes team , we need more people like this doctor who are knowledgeable about the true and real effects of being vaccinated .
We take the very best advice... From the vaccine experts..... Aka pharmaceutical companies selling their products. Well done for speaking up.
Do not get vaccinated.
More people like this HAVE to start speaking up. The media tries to paint everyone who does not want this jab with the same brush. We need people like this to stand up now.
He dont care what he saying
Everyone is welcome to their views and opinions however, for those who haven’t been vaccinated to then have a job assisting and treating those who are Ill.. it’s beyond me.
Why would a company release a one and done product, only makes sense they knew the benefits were short lasting at best. Once a month, sounds about right, just like my other prescriptions. Put it in a pill, people will take it every day.
It’s a racist thing Jarvid will have the protection to play that card
Well done doctor!
The way he instantly dismissed him with "that's your view," when Javid has zero medical education past his A Levels, if he even took biology.
No one talks about antibodies
People seem to completely forget that Natural immunity is real...big up to that doctor for Thinking logically
Let him go, plenty of replacements ready and vaccinated.
good on the nurse telling him straight and sticking to natural immunity instead of nonsense jabbing.
finally truth is out hatts off doc
Love how he couldn’t even argue that point😂
Interesting to see how cowardly those nurse chicks have nothing to say in fear of loosing their jobs...
The truth.nothing but it.
The inconvenient truth. The vaccine doesn't actually stop thr spread and doesn't work very well. But let's pretend.
If just one sane GP says that he doesn’t want the vaccine then that should be enough to make everyone think.
The left will suffer terribly. Thanks, China.
What a legend. There is NO science supporting the existence of covid or vaccines. Both pseudoscience.  The little goblin acting like everyone else was trying to speak when he asked if anyone had an opinion they never responded. Then the guy did ad sajid says 'well that's one opinion lets hear what everyone else thinks' and no one speaks ahahahahhahaa
brave to speak up!
"We take the very best advice that we can. From people that are vaccine experts."   HE'S A DOCTOR!!!!!!!!!!!
Forcing NHS workers for the vaccines and boost every month is disgusting
Health workers have to be vaccinated already though. So what’s the problem with the COVID vaccine compared to all the others?
Well said
Bloody anti vaxxers!
“At some point that will wane as well” but so do the boosters? So what’s your point. They should just use ivermectin or Hydroxychloroquine, they don’t need boosters, they’re expected to work  the first time.
I fully agree with the doctor for not being vaccinated.  There is NOT enough science behind the vaccine.  Spot on !  This is reality.
Can't people see its the hospitals, being run by the puppet masters, I know 1st hand, got a problem? Go f yourself
England really turned into America 😂
Health Secretary look like stupid zombie....tipical politicians style.. Repeating the the same words.. . My respect to doctor who is reall and honest.
Bless this doctor 👨‍⚕️ speaking sense…but whatever 😂
At last. A working doctor or surgeon speaking out. The advice the governments are giving out is by doctors and scientists who are being paid to give specific (wrong) advice
Money vs health that's how I see this conversation. Vaccine expects are they new Gods?
Fair play to the doctor - at least some people still have courage to stand up for what's right and what they believe in, while most just follow like sheep
Congratulations to this doctor for his honesty and logical thinking.
Gotta love it when the health secretary needs to resort to appeal to authority "vaccine experts" to make his case.
When politics rules over...
Vaccinate this fool.
Why is this on regular TV? This kind of informed conversation is mostly suppressed or shouted down. Things changing?
Wow! I want this doctor to be my doctor!
The 'truth' hurts as they say.
Good for this guy, I have many family members who work for the NHS. I don't think its fair they are being strong armed into taking the vaccine. We can't afford to loose these consultant specialists in the NHS. Why doesn't my body my choice apply here? Savage Javids response and argument was so weak. History will view vaccine mandates as unethical.
I wouldn't like to be a patient to this doctor and all his team.
A massive well done to this doctor for being honest and say the truth 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I’m sending my respect and appreciation to this doctor. He s one of the kind and a very rare hero who s gonna save us from this medical dictatorship
Why don’t people want the vaccine, what are they so worried about
Why ask for this medical professional's  opinion and then dismiss his opinion as somewhat not credible?
Fire him LAWL
All this makes me realise is just how many go along to get along cowards there are making up our entire NHS system.
I will never take your jab....EVER 🖕 good luck making me.
So he is already had a type of vacciene by getting covid. so he should be able to refuse being asked to get it again!
I'm fully vaxxed and just survived covid.  I can't imagine how bad it would have been without the vaccine.
Trying to reason with the ultimate agent of force (the government) is futile. Force is the only language they understand
One dose of AstraZeneca in the UK costs £3, £2 in the EU, £4 in SA and god knows how much elsewhere in the world, every person needs 2 doses + booster, do the math…it always comes down to “follow the money”
I am in Singapore. All unvaccinated are not allowed to go back to the office from 15th Jan. I will not take it even I am fired but I told my boss that I am more concerned my team members  who are getting endless jabs..and it is matter of time they are likely to get other health issue sooner or later so I will not regret it.
Im surprised the comments are open
😁
Javid is clueless
Great job in speaking up. Vaccine experts my foot!!!! Am sure none of them took that crap🧐
Will the entrapped slaves ever wake up
Who are the expert he is talking about, this covid 19 jab was creating from thin air!
One of the most important videos on YouTube at the moment. Especially for us in the UK
"the ministry of truth has declared this information too dangerous for public consumption"
This doctor is a true national hero. This pandemic is entirely political, no science whatsoever behind it.
Well done my men!
We take advice from vaccine experts? Wait isn’t that doctor considered an expert being that he is on the front line in the hospital treating people?   I think when they say vaccine experts they mean the big pharmaceutical companies that line their pockets!
Truth
Sky news is fake news. Reporter didn't even want to hear from the guy denying vaccinations don't work over antibodies from past exposure.
One of these 2 people is a doctor. Enough said
The simple fact of the matter is the physician is wrong. His claim of eight weeks goes unchallenged, but it isn't true, and this doctor isn't allowed his own truth. It's a good thing he doesn't deal with awake patients being an anaesthesiologist. And everyone in the comments who are cheering him are only doing so because they think his credentials outweigh the vast majority of physicians who disagree with them... Talk about burying your head in the sand...
he is so correct.. i take my hat off to him for standing up to the madness..
He should be jailed then
Vaxx experts???  That's the greatest joke. Biggest expert is Bill G.  Imagine that:))))
They created cancel culture so people would be terrified to speak up Good job he didn't hold back
Legend
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
If that doctor lived in Australia he and his whole team would have been fired.
Politician knows nothing versus actual doctor
Vaccine experts I’m really scared now
The Secretary sounds like they don’t believe them self.
Nice to see a calm discussion however its pretty clear whos speaking the facts with that doctor, despite going through many years of medical school and knowing a lot more than i ever will, being in a minority of other doctors with equal expieriance. This man may be a medical professional however that doesnt make him an expert on vaccines as a new report published from south africa outlines that he was wrong.
Won't take an injection made by a company immune from any liability, and rushed into production.  He's a radical, a fanatic right?
He couldn’t get away from him quick enough 😂
Hero
Definetlely not clickbait or propaganda. Definetly not.
I’m with the doctor! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
My body, my choice !
Says it all really, nothing else to say!
Give us our right to say NO
Well done to this young doctor to stand up for many others, if should totally be a personal choice for everyone!
💪 it's not equivalent, it's superior.
Health sec was so arrogant there. My wife is in the same situation she practiced medicine for 14 yrs and will simply get fired for not having vaccine at some point.
Vaccine experts he says mate listen to the doctor he knows better. The jab is all about money not health wake up everyone?
Wow
"Vaccine experts"? Big Pharma foot soldiers!
Important guy:" were following advice" Doctor:"Yeah but this" Important guy:"Yeah we're just following advice"
He’s entitled to his view
We need to check if this doctor is still alive after 😬 I mean he basically tell the truth to a propaganda minister 😅
Love the notice at the end of the video, such a gentle touch on the subject, 90% already done so, but we don't force the staff just yet because most likely they'll all resign. 🤣🤣
Politician says...   "That's your view, but we're taking the best advice from experts."  So...  What's the physian? Who's working on the front line seeing things develop in real time and not as a possible hypothetical infection computer  model!!
It has to be one's own decision, who is who to force others?
I understand that, and your view but we must go ahead with the QR passport and vaccine for the rest of the peasants.
Vaccinate the naturally immune..makes sense,, while millions of vulnerable people around the world still cannot get the vaccine! why cant the UK government ship the millions of unused vaccines out around the globe to those in desperate need..and desperately want them!  instead of just binning them after expiry.
So what was the answer in the end?...none, because the Heath secretary was prepared to reply to the consultant, which is very disappointing....😕
And.. your views
"We take the very best advice we can from people who are vaccine experts" Does this misinformed fool not know he's saying that to a doctor?
A voice of reason in the darkness. If the vaccines and boosters were much much more affective I might disagree with him. But they aren't!
vac experts are the ones that are selling the vac
The truth will always come out ! Lies, deceit will always be uncovered ! This is the law of the Universe !
Well done, it should be up to the individual. Not the government. This is ludicrous
I’ve waited 2 years to hear this. An opposing view on NATIONAL television about the vaccine. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾Protect that doctor at all cost.
answer took malteser man by surprise
This is real ,we are in Perilous times ,which means dangerous times in these last days So let's wake up and Pray like never before ,on these bad agenda being planned as I speak all leading to the Anti Christ agenda ,this secret society is bringing it in Be watchful, stay in alert!
So when did this twt do HIS studies  Is he another yutz talking shyt now that treatment has leveled with infection symptoms  🤔
Right, 1 NHS doctor says that!
I've had one vaccine. Don't believe i needed it as I've been working in a office for 7 months and been going out ever since this started. I took it because of potential travel but now I can see they'll probably start mandating more than 2. I.e its getting ridiculous
I had covid a year ago and I had the 2 vaccines only because I didn't want to take the risk having my daughter lose her father but as far as boosters go I will not be getting any. I don't see the point by now my body is either immune to covid or its fucked so what good is pumping a booster into me every two months going to do
This is too risky for him to say the truth.May lose his job,sad 🥲
This doctor schooled this pathetic beaurocrat with facts and 'science'. This clip should be shown around the world and repeated constantly. The doctors and so called experts working for the government are mostly nothing but medical graduates that could not cut it in the real world and have never actually treated patients.
I respect this doctor...not afraid to say the truth and stand for it.well done.
They take the advise from the mf that produce the poison... not from the experts
vaccine decision must be a medical-health decision and not political-mandatory. what is going on here  is that the big pharma and leaders want really bad to control people and make money
this on sky news wow did NOT think they let that one come out
"We take advice from Vaccine expect",  he is saying  to the Doctor who actually  work with Covid patients  opinions or expertise  does not matter.  This so called Health minister is NOT even  Doctor. This is Totalitarian system coming nothing to do with the Virus.
When science meets crook.
Every single month is not true. What an embarrassment to the medical community
This country has become rotten to the core. It's a complete mess. It really is.
Bloody privileged 1st world brainless
Clot shots and they know it.
Vaccine “experts” aka Vaccine Salesmen
V well done for standing your ground!!
👏
I will only see doctors that are against mandates
Jesus Christ shouldn’t even be a doctor then should he.
Worthless jabs with risky outcomes
Good man
Would be interesting to see the full version.I've had my first and get my second on the 21st.I feel like I am being conned,but without it no travel nowhere?
"well we take the very best advice that we can...from the people that are vaccine expert's" - I'm so mad with the way he replies that, to someone who he asked his opinion about the rule to vaccinate. And he is a NHS member. Shame on that politician
Absolute hero! 💯 well done sir 👏
Could anybody explain to me how around the Europe most of Health Secretary ministers don’t come from medical background?
Natural immunity never goes away. What an arrogant media guy trying to tell a doctor what the science is.
This man is my hero.
Id trust the janitors opinion over any politicians at this point to be honest
This needs more coverage
Well i will also never get the jab
Well, I am shocked with statistics watched this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sTFPVxqw_g
Yep...just another fuckin pandering politician.
What he is really saying is; I will keep my white blood cells running 100% as  white blood cell count runs at 25% in vaccinated.
"We take advice from vaccine expects".. who are this so called vaccine expects?.. well Doc for speaking for truth and not being weighed down by people's opinions
Well said this man, we now all know that the virus is not what its meant to be - natural immunity and anti-bodies are the way forward, stop the madness, stop the advancement of the great reset and lets expose the lies for example 'we take the very best advice, from vaccine experts' yeah right, we all know that's BS in particular when there are 1000s of vaccine and immunologist experts that have been dismissed and discredited because their science does not fit the political narrative.  STOP the madness STOP getting tested STOP any further mandates Lets get back to life, move on and crack on.
Javid just has his fingers in his ears singing lalalalalala he doesn't want to hear that and that response caught him out.....well done to that doctor 👏👏👏👏👏
Smart guy 👏👏👏
Thankfully he's in the minority. Foolish man.
I don't get his point. What is his real reason of not getting a jab? He did not explain it clearly here.   It's not that if he gets the jab then someone else (who presumably will need it more due to various reasons) will lose the opportunity to get a jab. There's no vaccine shortage issue.   And what's the point of Skynews putting up this video when the antivaxx movement is surprisingly gaining support here in the UK?  Please look at the people in the developing countries, they're desperate to get vaccinated yet the vaccine supply is less abundant there (as they are not as advanced in technology to produce their own vaccines).
This is pure gold.  Love his response.  Well take some better advice lol
This doctor has balls the size of Javid's head. What a legend.
The doctor is a hero! ❤️
How is it his opinion if he's a licensed doctor?
The government just got told!!! Not enough science and too much politics
Longitudinal studies on patients who had SARS and MERS (wild type) show they still have antibody immunity over a decade later. This "Health Secretary" knows nothing and it shows.
MAKE THIS DOCTOR THE HEALTH SECRETARY!!!!!
"we take the best advices we can, from people who are vaccine experts" Clearly they don´t. And u can here in his voice that statement is a belief he has, it´s a conditioned belief that has been adopted and not done any reesearch on. Not his own conclution. And talking about vaccine experts.. Dr. Robert Malone is one of the greatest experts on this feald, he´s advice resonates completly with what the unvaxed doctor is saying. He´s the one talking fact and logic, not this pro vaxer guy. It´s the twilight zone, bananas!
Courageous doctor. Good man
Bravo Sir !
The health secretary gets his advice by big pharma....and that's more than likely Pfizer!
I'm pro vaccine, fully respect what that Doc's saying
"The Vanities of all Visionaries are always Calculated to Appear So Natural" be proud and loud, every human has a RIGHT to be human
Javid clearly doesn’t understand, but then why would he, he’s a Politician.
Ja is is not listening. Telling this guy they talk to Vaccine experts! BS.
The heros of 2020 are now being fired for not willing to take the vaccine!! How is that fair!?!?
I am a Nurse working in health and social care I had all three vaccine and Covid twice if the first one was mild but after the vaccination I have suffered with covid symptoms 10 times verse
Good on ya !! I won’t be having the vaccine either 👍
VACCINE EXPERTS ,THEY COULD NOT BE ANYMORE WRONG .SNAKE OIL SALES PEOPLE COMES TO MIND .
Shows how insulated the Westminster bubble is. He couldn’t imagine this response.
Bravo that guy for stepping in and hitting peanut head with truth bombs. It was clear the poor nurses were scared to tell him how they really feel about the jab.
Well done to this Doctor for speaking out from his professional, personal point of view and challenging the politican👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻  Currently, I have been tested positive and my symptoms are very mild, almost nothing, maybe 5-10%.  Just feeling a bit tired and sleepy.  That is it!   Yet, I am healthy young woman with no underlying health conditions. Not vacinaited.  I understand, other people are not that lucky ❤
I with the doc
Bless him 👍
A great guy, telling it how it is
Anyone who is not vaccinated, shouldn't be allowed to treat sick people. Period.
Legend
The police will probably pay that doctor a visit now and give that doctor a beating for saying that.
Had to watch before they took it down.👀
Natural immunity is by far better safer longevity of life
great to see, how this jerk became very nervous as he knew his lies were getting obvious!  Only think he could grab were the "experts" paid by Pfizer and Gates...
Disgusting that they say how understaffed the NHS is to the point they bring army medics Into london, but then also dismiss any nhs worker for not getting the vaccine that they had to change the definition of the word vaccine to even call it that.
but the doctor missed the important aspect of the vaccines... Profit.
Brilliant 👏 a man with integrity
How dare those nurses stay silent! They should have said they love the mandatory vaccine rules! How dare they!
I bet hi's a Novak fan...
Dankoooo 😭❤️
Sacked in the morning
More doctors need to speak!
Huge respect 🙏 for a Doctor.... who sayed his own opinion... and he a Doctor he studied all this.... and health Secretary.... cmon of course he didn't like it 🙄 because Doctor didn't sayed what he wants to hear....
Love this man   Xxxx very sensible man😍
Scoateți masca de pe chipul domnului mâi oameni!!! 😔😔😔
Stop nannying people and start running the country. People that are vaccine experts paid for by big pharma.
This clearly shows that its not about the people its not about your health  A doctor said that if u had covid its the same if ur vaccibated so what is the point????  And also this boosters Are u going to have a booster in every month or what???  Time to wake up!!! Finally someone said something✌️
To even ask that question shows how out of touch he and this government are. Those nurses silence were the answer of many that are too afraid to speak up due to repercussions of being fired.
Yeah! Let’s get jabbed with a “vaccine" that doesn’t immunise no one!
Must be annoying when they didn’t receive the script in time
Every month !!😀
Arguing with a man with 8years or so leaving medicine and years after refining that skill with an idiot that studied arguing there point till they die
Didn’t we clap in 2020 for Dr’s like him? Now he’s losing his job. What a nasty and judgmental country we’ve become.
Well he has a point im jabbed but now feel like a sheep 🐑
Is the Health Secretary an experienced doctor? Has he studied, or at least researched the subject of Virology and Immunology?  Only if he has extreme competence in this matter should he be telling doctors what to do. The medical profession is vastly misunderstood these days. People seem to often value their own opinions and ideas above those who are qualified and experienced. And compelling doctors to behave in a way dictated by the politics of the day only serves to increase lack of trust in the doctors themselves, and in the profession as a whole. The whole problem , I believe is that the NHS, like the BBC, is, and has been politicised for some time - (and this is obvious to many) - and then becomes corrupted by those with an agenda, the "long game" - which we see coming to fruition now.
❤️❤️❤️ Good luck doctor! Keep fighting the ignorant sheep! They definitely don't want to hear about science.
Fantastic guy, well done to him!
This doctor speaks for a significant number of health professionals I know. The amount of qualified people’s voices getting hushed on this topic is shocking, it’s great that they are finally getting represented.
Respect to this doctor.
I personally will avoid any hospital given the stupidity in which it's been run. I'd much prefer an unvaccinated doctor with natural immune than a vaccinated doctor who is part of the spreading problem.....far out. I'm no doctor, just a mum, and I can see the evidence that this is ridiculous. The rich minorities , the self appointed powers that be, are loosing their grip, and so will push harder to infect everyone with some dodgy vaccine that's not a vaccine. Good on the doctor for standing his ground.
Political stunT 👉🏻🤡👈🏻🇺🇲🇬🇧🇮🇱
Respect to doctor.
What a legend! Xxxxx
My man 👏
Wish this doc could replace the doctors helping the govt, great to see sometime actually being rational and logical
absolutely brilliant!
This is why science and politics shouldn’t mix
Good words
1:53 The vaccine expects are often on the side of the doctor.
WHICH COUNTRY IS THIS?
Look at the way he started getting defensive when the doctor is simply explaining why it doesnt make sense  instead of understanding
Well done this amazing man standing up to these clowns. Our bodies, our choice, our free will ✌🏻🔥❤️
The big middle finger to the propagandist standing in front of his face.
And already there’s a witch hunt against this poor outspoken doctor 🥲
The doctors know what they are talking about not these stupid politicians good on him.
Respect mate thanks for that
Finally the other view is being published on mainstream media, instead of being force fed how critical these jabs are 🙄
Why is it the only experts seem to be the experts that work for the government. There are thousands of worthy, expert scientists and doctors out there all with a varied opinion on this. Sadly, the scientists and doctors that don’t agree with the current narrative, are not listened to.
Why is this doc so scared of a vaccination? Even if the extra antibodies are negligible over what he already has been exposed to isn’t that something better than nothing?
Fair play to the doctor
We all know who this benefits....the politicians and global elites of the world 🌎
Can anyone summarize in English what is being said in the video? Then translate it yourself. I can't understand English.
Jarvid has no clue the doctor should be his boss 🤷‍♂️
Amazing Dr for stepping in for the nurses who clearly felt uncomfortable speaking freely.  Common sense delivered in a calm and professional manner. Let’s hope other medical professionals can find the courage to follow his lead and speak up for themselves & colleagues that are being blackmailed to keep their jobs!
“Vaccine experts”= big pharma NWO
🙄 .. for the media guy!! He’s trying to contradict and undermine the doctor with his BS, when the doctor would know far more about virology and immunology than the media and general public giving opinions to the contrary !! The doctor makes some good points!
thumbs up  Dr james , he said in a polite way jabs dont help hip hip horray more should come up with the truth  keep it up stop the fear mongering and fake news
part of the great awakening. enjoy the show
I think a lot of people need to understand the words coming out of the health secretary mouth. He’s literally blabbering on trying to stop the conversation between the doctor because he knows a doctor in front of a camera saying he’s going to loose his job from not getting the jab,  the rate at which we will need boosters and why the whole situation has to be reassessed is bad for press and the agenda him and his health team are trying to push. the statement where he said “we take all advice from the people who are vaccine experts.” these are the same people who have never dealt with covid
What a reasonable guy. Straight up says it how it is with a needed calmness. Much respect, agree with everything he said.
So the doctor went to school for probably half his lifezc studied medicine extensively, and my man did dismissed all of his VALID points. Dirty game
Incredible
The description of this video is a disgrace, dr Steve James never said his natural immunity was far superior to any vaccine he said his natural immunity from exposure to the virus would be equivalent to any current vaccine and the science isn’t strong enough, when will people wake up and see that the media are just mass manipulators pushing their own agendas
We need more doctors like him.  Good on him!  It's a shame those nurses were too scared to speak up.
Right
This doctor also runs a breathlessness clinic where he charges £230 per 30 mins for a consultation. it seems as though he’s just widening his population…
Experts have got it wrong from the start. Don’t be forced to get vaccinated
All my light and power and support to this doctor....👏👏👏👏👏🤘
I like the way he tells the doctor they take advice from vaccine experts.... eh? Is that not a doctor your speaking to?  Stop forcing your narrative!
Well done to this doctor for speaking up and standing up for actual science and common sense. He's an absolute hero.
Half these jab mandates are about lining people's pockets not protecting people.
Just because a majority says so, this doesn’t mean there right.
Very best advice from the vaccine experts, getting grants from big farma.
Another way of saying it...look were doing what we were told to do push VACCINES ‼️🌏👤🚫💉
Even I am a doctor  I have not taken vaccination still
What a fantastic doctor for standing up and telling this bullshit for what it is! 👍🙏
From the people who are vaccine experts ? 🙄 People like who dr Robert malone whos now banned from twitter . O give me a break ! The science that suits them SMH. Well done doc well said 👏👏👏 that guys an idiot!
Brilliant this doctor is he is speaking up
Now they call him “deluded” and attack in every possible way. So the only one correct opinion is to vaccinate and anything else is wrong. 🤮
Clap for the NHS. Until they are not vaccinated they throw them in the trash. Sad sad world
GOD bless, and keep this Doctor for saying it as it is period.
Well that’s your view, anyone else who I can latch onto that has the same view as me? What a arse
Fire that idiot doctor.
Well said!
Well said, I totally agree.
Well done a true soldier speaking the truth and standing up to the bully.
This doctor should be the health secretary
Good doctor
Vaccine experts! He means the devil. Bravo to the doctor
This is exactly why they won’t have an open debate - because their arguments sound weak with absolutely no substance when put against an intelligent doctor with a mind of his own!
It’s insane how many people are ill informed on this subject. Even the doctor said his natural immunity is probably equivalent to someone with the vaccine. No no no your natural immunity is far more superior than someone who is vaccinated!!!
WOOOOHOOOO ... Theres a COURAGEOUS person Finally .. who says how much more to live with FOOLS who think more injections mean Immunity rather than working on Natural Immunity .
Natural immunity is better than any vaccine. Don't be fooled by so called experts that are clearly driven by profit. The nhs is struggling not through covid or unvaccinated people, but through miss management,  privatisation,  and lack of staff . Don't believe the lies . Reverse the privatisation of the nhs .
“Vaccine experts” = drug company sales rep politicians
I'm all for the vaccine, I think it's a fantastic win for the scientific community and the general population - despite the misinformation that's spreading like wildfire about it. However, I am not for mandatory vaccinations. People should be trusted to make their own decisions about their health, just as we do about religion and politics, instead of imposing it on everyone.
Thanks to the doctor standing up for his rights, his colleagues, ‘actual’ science and the rest of the world. Natural “whole virus” immunity is far stronger, and also lasts very long. Evolution doesn’t make mistakes, but Big Pharma does.
The truth is coming out, the government has to do a U turn come April because doctors and nurse know the truth and they will not take these jabs
Good lad
I think it’s absolutely disgusting to be forcing those doctors and surgeons and nurses that worked so hard throughout the whole pandemic putting their own lives at risk to treat others with Covid and well as keeping to the rules better than Parliament has , to get a vaccination if they choose that they do not want it. We have already lost loads of top doctors and hospital staff because of the immense pressure that they have been under.  Especially when the vaccine does not provide 100% protection ( no vaccine does) .And  Does not stop people catching or spreading covid. It seems completely unjustified for them to be threatened with losing their jobs given the circumstances.
This guy is copmplete numpty .How the hell did he become a doctor mind boggles
He'll be 'missing' in afew days
The fat headed oaf wanted a gaggle of mindless hens that can't answer a question without giggling and getting giddy to play into his agenda until this lad showed up and got him visibly frustrated. The way he said "vaccine experts" as if undermining the doctor makes my blood boil
I support this doctor in his belief that he´s got enough protection from having the disease and don´t need the jab. I´m unvaccinated as well and I´m still healthy and haven´t changed my life in any way (I live in Sweden)
it's not "his view" it's the truth based on the scientific evidence.
Agreeing or not, well done to this person for having the courage to speak his mind, calmly, rationally, raising questions in a productive way.
100% common sense from the doctor
Does that sadiq know what he is talking about.  Vaccine 💉 experts.     They have said. It’s all a money making game.  And these people in the parliament are making money 💰.   Even boris telling everyone to lock up and has a party at no.10.  Bring ur own drinks 🍺.    LoL
What is the percentage of doctors who approve of the vaccine? A poll would be nice. 90% of Staff took the vaccine but what percent of doctors in that case? I'll go with the majority if its overwhelming when it comes to the professionals.
Good on the Doctor who spoke up🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻👊🏻🙏🏻  “We take advice from the experts”?! I hope their not referring to FRAUDCI OR THE CDC😳 OUR BODIES, OUR RIGHTS👊🏻🇺🇸🙏🏻
Coawrdly little disclaimer to end there 🤢
How can Javid just fob off this doctor. The doctor is the expert not Javid.....
I had covid , never had a vaccine , fought it off myself so im pretty much in the same boat why inject my body with something that hasnt even been properly tested yet ? I have my own antibodies to fight of the virus not getting vaccines that have been tested for less than a year no one even knows what the long term effects from it could be .
This doctor is working for someone above.  Someone else that is paying his salary..  So why trust in him.
That was very brave of him to speak out like that. Well done! I could hear how nervous he was when he first started to speak but slowly towards the end he grew in confidence. Everyone has a right to decide if they want the vaccine or not, nobody should be forced or pressurised into having it. A healthy society is built on freedom of choice not by an authoritarian Government telling people what to do.
I was basically demonised for not receiving the vaccine. Unfortunately I had to take it since I would be seen as someone that's uneducated and  supported anti-vaxers. NHS betrayed it's workers
Google Dr.Robert Malone. He’s a vaccine expert…
*"Cut! Cut! Edit that out!"*
This is the clear difference between health care staff vs politicians. One has hands on knowledge and experience, others are being bribed
To all those defending the doctor: sure he has every right not to get the vaccine (and suffer for it). Unfortunately he is not an expert on vaccination/immunology, he is an anesthesiologist. His "facts" are not supported by numerous studies of covid-19 vaccine and antibody trials and his rhetoric (given his non-expertise) is dangerous. People jumping on to support his claims because they like to think a bus driver would make a great F1 driver (or vice versa) if it aligns with their worldview...
Some one please sack this selfish idiot people have died because of him
RESPECT
What happened to the inappropriate dancing on the wards......?
Notice how hesitant the nurses are. They just want to keep their jobs. This is tyranny and fascism in its purest form. All governments and anyone who wants global mandated vaccination is just doing the bidding of big pharmaceuticals.
Perfect
What this doctor (and MANY MANY MANY other doctors and scientists) is saying is relevant to not only medical staff but to the whole population in general!
Well done , consultant. Good explanation
Oh wow how long until YouTube removes this? This is gold
Ive had my third booster. Its my last. Its clear to me that the term vacine has been misused to identify thse compounds as the protection thry provide seems limited and fails fast.  Now that we have good therapeutic medicines like monocromal anti bodies combined with a regiment of excercise and healthy eating, I'm done.
This was a tale of the interesting two.   Up to 7 years in medical school and training vs a politician who blah blah blah.
Good for him for speaking up. Arguing with a Doctor, no chance
And our so called NHS want to dismiss doctors like him, and keep the sheep that will nod their head to anything hahah Iv lost faith in the whole system, the government, medicine and now slowly humanity 😔
While this brave doctor talks, his colleagues behaved as mice
Personal choice...gee what a concept!
MP says “we take vaccine advice from our vaccine experts” …. Any pharmaceutical company that pays us!!!!!! That doctor said it perfectly and the MP still wants him to get a daily booster 😂
COVID is a political disease.  It does not make sense with vaccines just popping up after an outbreak.  There's something fishy going on here.
Sajid javid under pressure 🤣
Ok so the doc in the video got antibodies as he got covid and not the vaccine. So what? What if when he was sick with Covid and unvaccinated he had complications and died? The vaccine would have protected him better and triggered the required antibodies. The vaccines also reduce transmission so while the unvaccinated doc was spreading it around , others being vaccinated didn’t or at least did it less.
Seee how they segregated him from his other colleagues from standing together lol thd group didn’t even no what to say lol very best advice lol go look into Pfizer nano technology
"That's your view" like he's a milk man 🤦‍♂️
Well done for speaking out. We need science and not blind obedience.
The health secretary can’t tell him why he won’t be vaccinated every month, wow. Typical Tory.
W
Listen to the Doctor box ticking Dumbass .Stick your jab
He said experts hahaha
We take advise from vaccine expert’s 😂😂 I hate the government they are just rats 🐀
God bless this Dr. for speaking truth and walking the walk, that takes courage and integrity. Much respect!
Intelligence against dumbo. 🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿👍 Wasting your breath mate.
So we will have 100k less medics and the rest will be off every other month to get a jab, good thinking there then If only they did actually follow the science.  FFS
I’m just amazed the comments section here is open!
Hero
The white shirt didn't seem open to any discussion whatsoever. Shame
Why isn't this doctor running the country..he would do a better job by himself than all of the others put together
Brave doctor.  I am glad he is trying at least to talk sense but it is like talking to a wall. Big Pharma wont let common sense prevail as there is no profit to be had. Unfortunately people will keep complying no matter what.
People are so stuck in their own views on the virus and inoculation it's like à political stand. But science isn't like that. So many people are now convinced by this news clip. Yet the doctor has since said he got his timings on months wrong.... Too late mate - the crowd are convinced!  🥳
Not just his views the views of millions
Censor this man for his choice and opinion please we cant tolerate those
We take advice from vaccine experts, said the idiot to a doctor on the front line 🙄🙄🙄
Legend 👏
Hope this doctor is still working in NHS?
Lol
Great answer from a real dr. God bless him & all those who stand for their rights and the truth!
All the Sheep out there lol
So listening to facts is being discarded. Wanting to listen to people tell him what he wanted to hear is what he wants. I  Would have kicked him out my location.  It was just a show for media.
The bald guy got upset wanting to do his propaganda
The Health Secretary is a criminal idiot. Let him prove that he took the vaccine. And NO not a photo where the needle's cap is still on. Evidence in his blood!!!!!  Also the whole parliament and leaders of every country. And let a dr. who is against the vaccines do the blood work.
Brilliant. Good to see people standing up for human rights and freedoms. These people are usually silenced and censored. They slipped up with this one😅  The Covid sh*t show is unravelling at pace 👌👌
Delta variant   >>   Omicron variant   >>>   IHU variant   >>>>   & the next mutations ? ? Get your vaccinations and wear a mask to save yourself , your family and your Country . Your PM may not be always right , but listen to him this time  .....
Finally a doctor who is bold enough to speak the truth!
Ayyyy I was born there, and a brilliant doctor.
😊😊😊
Can we all, no matter-jabbed or not, -just would go away from our workplaces to end this worldwide madness?   I hope for it, that in some moment in time this will happen. We should unite!
Good on him 👏
A hole politician pushing his Agenda - ignoring their own Dr's- I hope their will be Nuremburg trials over this
Legend...  I agree with all he said 👌
An economist and former banker is somehow confident to discuss immunology with a doctor only to say immunity wears off. Sajid Javid is plain foolish because he made a false statement but this is what party politics offers those who vote for them.  A grown man who is incompetent but does not know so. Or he knows his incompetence and is comfortable managing his portfolio as health secretary in UK.  The gullible then take his advise to accept vaccination although it is a false paradigm.
I wouldn’t want to be treated by that doctor - a doctor that ignores the overwhelming evidence / science, I wouldn’t want operating on me
Truth is, there is no debate, it's not permitted! No alternative means of compliance = coercion & no real concern for public health.
Interesting...Javid seemed a little dismissive. Instead, of really taking on board the point this doctor so eloquently put across.  Now, I hope that he goes back to his "vaccine experts" and challenges them...ask his experts does what this doctor told me have merit etc. Javid should remember there is a difference between results that are derived in a lab Vs. results in the field.
Awesome how this man stood up for what so many of us believe. A real shame the nurses did not join in to support him even later on in the conversation. Obviously now they will try to make him look bad but so pleased he is a hero in so many people's eyes.
He said what all those nurses wanted to say 😂 the shoulder shrugs said it all.
Bet they try to fire him. Hope not. He makes sense. I think the shot is tied to 5G phones because they are really pushing that too! I feel like this doc does. I’m not going to get booster after booster after booster after booster! utterly ridiculous! Every DAY it’s something new to do about these damn shots! TF!
Wish more doctors / nurses in hospitals spoke up rather than being bullied of possibility of loosing their jobs. Would be surprising no doubt the amount that 1) don’t want the vaccine 2) would treat someone that hasn’t been vaccinated.    It’s just endless with it? For as long as there is air travel we will have constant Covid/New Mutated Variations.   When will the jab nonsense stop? After people’s 20th Booster & 5/6th time of Catching Covid?
That's a practical and logical viewpoint.
Doctor makes sense administrative mouthpiece for pharma sounds like an idiot
Sounded like the doc was out of breath
Top man
Got Covid?  Natural antibodies equivalent to the "shot"?  Try 27 X"s more protection.  And as far as it waning?  Who from where, internationally, has done a study?  Antibodies may wane, but the B cells and T cells...WON'T!  HEADS UP AUSTRALIA!  And Every Country that is being stupid.
An anaesthetist with a blue outfit and soft spoken tone does not a vaccine researcher make - he is not qualified to speak on this matter - just like a nurse in surgery isn’t qualified to perform an operation - proximity to covid and medical appearance should not be confused for competence on the subject of vaccine efficacy where data is obtained thru large scale peer reviewed trials.
Vaccination is not the only solution and treatment option. Every “health” agency and government body that has stood in the way of treatment should be sued out of existence. The deaths are on their watch. NOT THE UNVACCINATED.
I would of thought a doctor that had been on the front line for the whole journey would of been an expert...a one that is not afraid, my kinda doctor
Say no to vaccine 🖕
Now this guy is a hero,he is standing up for what he believes and more shoukd do the same. Its disgusting how the NHS are being treated when they decline the jab
Brave Doctor..we all need to Respect his right to voice his opinion..   "For the love of Humanity"  some still work under that  .. As a close relative told me that's why they do it.. 💛 as one of the team
Well...that doctor just got his walking papers...
Then he shouldn't be working next to vulnerable people.
We take the best advice from "vaccine experts" ...  Let me rephrase to what he really meant  We ONLY take the best advice from the vaccine experts that fit our narrative.
From the people that are vaccine salesman
Doctor death
thank god u r an anesthesiologist and require minimum expertise( a crna could do ur job) . i wouldn't want u to ruin people's life by being any other specialty.
A Dr speaking the truth and facts yet other still chap wasn't accepting ..
i hope the doc STILL has his job. XD
The health minister has no clue how to defend his ‘view’ - it has no grounds! Hilarious government that’s what we have
And vaccine manufacturers are laughing all the way to the bank!
The last line "actually experts" gotta remember most doctors in hospitals don't work with the development of vaccines, immunology or epidemiology. Not all  doctors are the same. The media always makes out that all doctors know everything about medicine. If this was the case we wouldn't have specialised areas of medicine. I'm sure he's a very smart man and knows a lot, but i wouldn't trust a dermatologist with a cardiovascular surgery. If he was a physician scientist focusing on immunological then I would listen, but this doesn't seem to be the case
Still no proof of virus and germ theory.
He takes advice from... the pharmaceutical companies that create "vaccines".. completely ignoring the doctor on the front line 😅
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍smart man.
Freedom
Bravo. Well done doc for standing up for your rights and educating many others. Your other colleagues coward and couldn’t speak their minds…👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 👏🏾
And that comment at end bollocks if 90 percent done why they not say only 1 who said hasn’t been liars
He says it's not doable or reasonable at the state level to require people to do so. Might get misinterpreted by some that it's better to get sick to get the antibodies as opposed to get vaccinated.
There was 0 enthusiasm for the mandate the very moment he asked that question of the medical workers there.  Tells us all we need to know.
Forget about it just having short term effectiveness....we don't even know about the long term side effects
"The protection i've got from transmission is better than vaccination" Very very very stupidly wrong!!
My sister is a recent convert to tiny pricks, guess I'm well in now.
It’s not called courage, it’s called rational thinking
This NHS doctor is anti-science. There are tonnes of scientific papers out. All the things he said are wrong. The protection does not go off after a month. Go and heal the disease with your crystals and tea. Great his is losing his job.
Sack him
What he really was saying is he won't turn himself to an genetically modified human for the government and new world order
I actually like how this doctor explained his views. The companies that are firing staff because they are unvaccinated didn't take this into account. Bravo, I think we need real medical experts advise on vaccine
Look at the likes on this video!!!!!! Yes!!!!!
Anaesthetis... consultant... talking about vaccines. What an authority....maybe let's hear it from a virologist? This man is a danger to all his patients.
Absolute Legend! Well Done!
There is no debate allowed!!! Take the jab or get fired is the only thing that the government and media are forcing down your throat. Ironic at best.
Salute his courage 👍God bless him.
this courageous doctor should be the health secretary !!
At the end of the day the power is with the doctors. If they say they will strike on the 1st April. The notion will be overturned weeks in advance. The government can't afford to have the few doctors they have not turning up to work
This gentleman knows what he’s talking about… and the politician dismissed that by inferring that he was not a “Vaccine expert.”
90% are jabbed? Trusting in Government controlled statistics these days is like giving yourself an uppercut!
I absolutely agree with the courageous doctor! The Health Secretary has obviously sold his soul to defend the evil, NWO!
Finally a doctor with balls.
Where is rest of the doctors...hiding 😂
Well done to this doctor. The interviewer asking the questions was looking for the answer ‘yes we should keep getting boosters and mandates are acceptable’ yet he didn’t get it. The reason is more people are being brave and saying hold on a minute, the science and data is not supporting the narrative for forced and mandated vaccination. Then at the end of the interview he said we will look to vaccine experts for advice… so why is he interviewing these people then?! They didn’t give him what his employer / the government / the mass narrative needs to extend this pandemic. I’m all for right to choose, the need for transparency in the science and data, and importantly the ability for open dialogue. This news reporting is agenda driven and perpetuates fear mongering - shame on them.
Finally one brave doctor. Bravo. The rest is just saying what they been told. Big respect to this one...
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Here in 🇮🇳India (assam) we are not allowed to board any means of transport and are not allowed to visit any Institutions if we are not vaccinated(i.e double dose).  We need a certificate provided by the govt i.e the license to go everywhere freely.  Forcing people to get vaccinated.
What he said is absolutely true. As minors in zoology I can confirm from what little I know about medical science and viruses.
If the reporter was sick and in the hospital he would listen to the doctor’s advice, so why not listen to him now?
It's not HIS view.  It's the fact and only truth here! He is a real doctor, by name and practice, I must say. The interviewer keeps trying to minimise and belittle whetever he said, like he's not already speaking with the expert on the matter🤦🏾‍♀️. The audacity!
Never send a boy to do a man's job
So Grateful I got out of Nursing 10 yrs ago, Cant Imagine How Horrific Life is for these Clinicians, All I can Say is Get Out of that Tyranny ASAP!
I agree , I have worked in a covid ward for nearly two years now , I must have encountered every variant and developed natural antibodies . I think we should be able to choose.
"Health" Secy didn't listen to a word the Dr said.  Natural born authoritarian.
what a *TIGHT SLAP* 😂😂
My doctor recommended I don't get vaccinated.
Amazing how this has gone viral but not one mention of this on Sky News channel (501) but only makes it on Sky News YouTube channel 🤔 Well done to the Doctor for standard up for what he believes in.
Can we just take a second to acknowledge that even this hospital is calling it a jab and not a vaccine 🤨
The daft thing is they can't afford to lose doctors and nurses.  Scare tactics perhaps, we will see what happens when its enforced.
Scamvid 19 "vaccine experts or scam experts"
That Dr was talking to a brick wall built by corruption.
Because he is a doctor look at all the support he is getting! Double Standards, If he was joe boggs he would getting taken apart by the mob, or called stupid by a president somewhere.....
Respect the doctor for his clarity👌
Good to see people are starting to wake up.
Why can't the politicians listen to reality and facts. Listen to the Doctors.
“From the people that are vaccine experts” felt like he was putting down the doctor
Health Secretary isn't a doctor or a scientist 😂😂😂😂 just a 🤡
That's sad the health Sec is telling a doctor his views doesn't matter but also that same doctor pulled the truth out of him unknowingly 😆😂😆
Perfect example to show that these jabs are Al nonsense and comical.  I hope they keep him alive 🙏🏿
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Medical expert: “i say no”   Puppet: “We take advice from vaccine experts”  Medical expert: “…..”
Dont take the markofthebeast
Well said doctor..that is why i wont get vaccinated. Makes sense.
More liess to persuade the public to get in these experimental vaccines obviously this was all planned anyone that still can't seeing this after almost 3 years is crazy
About time someone tell the true 👍🏿 💯 well done 👏 ✔ 👍🏿 👌 🙌
Heroes were used and dispensed. What a grateful way to return the favor. No one was screened when help was needed, but today without a jab developed last year, your whole career can be thrown out the window.
Let it be clear not a lot of people can stand up and defend on what they believed in especially when it comes to science. How can they actually say that the antibodies created by someone who already had Covid at a certain point in time are not enough and a vaccine is needed. Do the people who advise the government are that stupid or it’s just political.
The vaccine 💉 experts 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️$$$$$$$ Baffling that people think the government and big pharma have the People’s best interest .  Ridiculous 😣🙏🌎
Actually with Pfzier booster, immunity from infection is at 75% for up to 9-10 weeks before it drops down to 30-40% range. After that it is still effective against lowering hospitalization and death.
"We take the very best advice we can."   If that is actually true, then I hope they listen to this doctor, as well as other world-class experts who are being deplatformed for actually following the science.
Imagine a lousy 'reporter' arguing with a medical expert... Welcome to the 21st century madness
They look so F’n stupid in those face diapers
My best friend didnt get the vaccine. He just passed a few days ago. All he needed to do was take the stupid shot. And follow the cdc recomendations not some doctor who doesnt specialize in pandemics or viruses. Bummer
A gentleman I just spoke to has been having his antibodies checked and it’s been over a year probably a year and a half and he still has antibodies would not be amazing if they never go away and we have some kind of strange against the stamp stuff
Anyone in health care who doesn’t understand science should be terminated. They are clearly in the wrong line of work.
It must be so much easier to hold the company line on camera w a mask on 😷
I wonder how this type of exchange would pan out in the United States...🤔
So what is this doctor's advice to those of us who haven't got the disease and don't want to get it because we have preexisting conditions and the long term effects might do us more harm?
They take their advise not from doctors but vaccine experts only
This doc is a shame to medicine and science. Fire the idiot!
Haha yes, like the “vaccine experts” aren’t biased in any way to recommend mandatory vaccines 🙄
This is gold for anti-vaxxers and I’m glad that guy makes up a tiny minority.
Over 20% of American doctors have not been vaccinated as of November according to the Association of  Surgeons and Physicians. The vaccines are not effective enough to be worth the risk according to over 1 in 5 American MDs.
Good for him for standing up for the right to make one's own medical decisions!
Give that man a knighthood!!!
Cowards,!!
He uses the term "vaccine experts" very loosely.
Thank goodness a dr with brains
Wow! The silence from group of doctors is the real story!
Reading the comments, it’s good to see that everyone respects his opinion on the vaccine whether they themselves have had it or not, it should always be a choice and never be a mandatory situation.
NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO TELL ANYONE TO GET VACCINATION OR OTHERWISE THEY WILL LOSE THEIR JOB....BULLSHIT
Great man the doctor 🙏🙏🙏👍
I’m so glad he spoke up 🙌🏾✨
JAVID THE Dirty, criminal, traitor needs locking up for TREASON, MALFEASANCE in PUBLIC OFFICE AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.
No vaccine is the way to go
Idiots are weighing in doesn’t help push for a quality debate.
He doesn't need it.  Most people do.
HAD THE VACCINIATION AND STILL GOT COVID...WOW WHAT A BULLSHIT THIS IS...WHERE IS OUR FREEWILL???????? SO PROUD OF THIS DOCTOR HATS OFF THAT AT LEAST WE ARE NOT ALL ACTING LIKE SHEEP IN A HERD
Stupid retard " tHAtS yOUr vIeW" no dumbass, that's facts
I wonder what they did with the doctor did they fine him, release him from his job. If it was any average worker and not a doctor
TELL HIM AGAIN THE LITTLE BALD MUG
I agree with the Dr . He is on the front line and dealing with it . Not pushing a pencil and making decisions for political reasons . The EXPERTS that disagree, their opinions and data aren’t even considered.  An upside down world we are living in
His point was that unless all NHS staff are boosted monthly there is no point in them being forced to be vaccinated.
my admiration to the brave doctor! We should get the right information from the experts… then form our stand. The science is obviously not followed anymore.. The good doctor said it all. He is a doctor, he has the MIND to think so what he said, as a professional, as a thinking person.
Hes right I'm thinking
These bar stewards i politics need to be hung up and now!!! Utter bankers.
Great doctor ..I hope the governments take his opinion but if course they are going to take $$$ big farma side since they have the experts in vaccines
Kudos
Follow Vaccine experts... Ya, the ones who parrot the narrative
Well done brave doctor. Well done. Exposing the lies and tyranny of mandates and so called vac#ines that do not work. Well done sir.
The corrupt big pharma narrative I'd crumbling. Truth will always win
Doctor is a fool
"We have to consider the other views"  The other views, by false data and statistics, will always say vaccine mandate. There is a vaccine agenda at play, and they will not stop at "though the science doesn't support it, we will listen to the government vaccine shills who go against all the Medical Doctors speaking out about the science. Thanks for your opinion but we will mandate it anyway. Company policy."
no jab , no job .
Tell him like it is. People aren't going to DO that!
And he's right. You'd have to have it every month just to have slightly less symptoms. That's not cost effective and at some point the ratio of injuries from it will increase.
The thing this doctor is missing is that all antibodies wane over time. His infection induced antibodies have already waned too. All the vaccines aren't equal, which is how basic this doctor has made his argument. So he's right and wrong all at the same time.
Get the Jab and be a Slave to the Boosters for the rest of your lives.
I would be really interested to find out why I've managed to escape getting it even though I've been exposed several times, twice by those who had it pretty bad. I'm seriously considering finding a doc who will prescribe the T test and just paying the 150 for it. Because either I have those or I'm being protected.
Sajid like many other MP’s are clueless. Sheep who blindly follow advise given from those “experts” above. The same “experts” who milking the government with consultancy invoices. Comical. He hasn’t a clue about health, likewise many other hypocrite expenses bashing puppets in no10.
Not the answer he was looking for so he shrugs it off and wants to move onto the nurses quick.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
The last bit he said "best advice from vaccine experts ", Not virologists? The vaccine experts all have vested interests in promoting vaccines.
The doctor is a professional, offering his advise.....the other man is a professional fibber owned by big pharma lobby group's.
Double vaxed and boosted and still catching it and giving it make it make sense. 🤯
Stand up to medical tyranny…
Shame on those other health care workers in the video for being quiet and not supporting that doctor. They sacrifice him to keep their jobs. That's why we are all in that situation, people think only about themselves and later they complain but they not willing to risk anything.
The one that questions this honest brave Doctor sims to be annoyed with Doctors expert explanation and saying:” we take advice of best experts” - yeah, the industry that profits if 7.5 billion humans by injecting monthly, WOW 😳  WOW, do the math here people, who is protected?
Fixxxer be like: Jab another pin Jab a new vaccine in me 😁
Big applause for this Doctor and team! Everyone should be following on the actual science ..like these people who are doing it everyday! And shut down the Politicized "science"!
Javid told the doctor that his after Covid antibodies won't last either. How does he know???
Well done to that Doctor for standing up for what he believes in!
This man now is missing
All a big money grab from Pharma and anyone with half a brain knows it
I get it if people don't wana have vaccination, but do it like the way this guy did - speaking eloquently and peacefully. Most people just burst out in anger when they speak of vaccination.
He seemed to assume he has COVID because he said he had it ‘at some point’ which is rather vague. I understand he has antibodies from a already being exposed, but that does not mean other should wait around to get exposed to naturally get those antibodies as it would be fatal for them to do so (elderly, vulnerable etc). So some may rely on the vaccine for antibodies. Also, the reporter was being respectful and clearly trying to ask the others their opinion but the doctor seemed to want to have a debate.
What happens after 10-20 boosters.
lets go don't get booster
.....From Expert Deceivers.
The Doc made the Sunday Roast in front of Sky News
😎
This dr is influenced by Djokovic 😂
I wish they would listen to vaccine experts
This doctor needs to listen to the science from Sajid Javid.
So this doctor accepts the vaccine helps to reduce transmission, and didn’t mention at all why he doesn’t want to get it… that’s helpful.
They politicized this vaccine too much. Honestly do it or don't its none of our business. Do your own research, make your own assessments, and make your own risks. Even if thats taking it or not.
What determines a vaccine expert?   $$$$$$ to bribe people with so they agree. That's what makes them an expert.
Excellent. Doctor that believes in science and has the balls to state the truth. Bravo.
He's just explained that in such a calm and factual way. He's my '022 hero 🏆
My job just sent an email today that says we have to either get the vaccine or will have to do a covid test every week.
https://youtu.be/GYjTlfZn7R8
Meanwhile the US has huge staffing shortages as unvaccinated fill up the hospitals to capacity- So hospital administrators are forcing COVID positive medical staff to come into work & work with immune compromised patients & the elderly in elderly care facilities. This doctor is an idiot- science is strong enough. Unvaccinated people who got COVID before are getting omicron again. Let this doctor go work at a fast food place- Not a hospital endangering patients. Do the a vaccine mandate for medical staff.
He finishes with the statement “We take the very best advice we can......from the vaccine experts...... “ so exactly what is the background of these chosen so called experts, who is in charge of selecting these “experts” and is there any form of financial agenda for these so called experts ??? If so isn’t that what we class as a conflict of interest and not a true and just comparison to this Doctors theory
I’m so appalled at how his calm, factual and well explained views (and having spent years in Med School) were simply dismissed by someone that clearly doesn’t have a clue, or his own opinion. This doctor is a legend and I believe we should all have and keep our own rights to have the vaccine or not. I have to attend surgeries in my post and was willing to have the vaccine if my boss (the surgeon) said I had to for the safety of others. I’m pleased to say, he was as knowledgeable as this awesome guy and said every individual/patient has the right to refuse any treatment, even if deemed beneficial to their health and survival in a multitude of medical conditions. We need more guys like them!
Odd as this  health minster,  did not get the answer he was looking for ,so he dismissed this doctor . Is that , not what has been ,happening this last two years . This is not an health issue it’s politics. Dismiss every opinion ,but the governments narrative. Are we in the middle of something much worse than a health scare . History shows us many things ,the most profound , is governments across human history have caused more pain more suffering to our society , more death , more fear ,more violence and damage, than any other form man made or natural.
Its a JOKE OF A VACCINE.....i have natural immumity.  I Will Not Have It.  They can go get jabbed every month, I WILL NOT.
Does a fully vaccinated person intentionally or unintentionally can't spread covid and if both fully vaccinated or unvaccinated can spread covid then what's the difference between unvaccinated person covid transmission and fully vaccinated person covid transmission? If governments answer these questions then everything will be crystal clear I am urging all governments to answer these questions
Lord bless and protect him.
What an amazing doctor! He was giving an honest true opinion!
The truth is coming to light. Brace yourselves for the ace up their sleeve. 😞
If this doctor has his facts right (which I’m dubious about), it sounds like a better vaccine needs to be developed.
We Need More Brave Souls to Speak Up 🥳🌎🥳
ধন্যবাদ ভাই।
Awesome this doctor stood up and told the FACTUAL TRUTH
That took courage. Good for him!!
Also to see someone stand up and say no, not just feel like tradi g their life for their job.
the mask and vax dont work
Hero
I was to be vaccinated today....I didn't go. I am with that doctor above....no   and I had covid 1/2 of July and all of Aug.........I survived
Politicians don't listen to anyone....just good at wrecking our nation.  Civil servants.....remember that. So arrogant
NHS IS DEFINATLY AN STPID MAN.
OK so we Sack our brilliant  doctors that have bravely  worked throughout  and bring in foreign not as qualified  doctors to cover.
Finally someone with courage👑
I respect the opinion of this medic
The 90% vaccinated is probably just so they dont lose there job and risk getting blacklisted
The pod people discovered a human.  "Type H. Repeat, type H."
Remember we don’t have doctors as politicians. Savid Javid is a businessman
Respect to the dr.
I honestly can't get over the amount of people that don't see through this???? This is mainstream media which means it is meant to be seen... Why? Because this is the perfect way to get folks ready for the new magic pill, the lovely doc says it's not logical to keep getting boosters.. See it now?? ..... Come on folks open your eyes!!!!
The great poisoning. In a nutshell.
smart doctor wish there were more like him
He is man ,realy big respect,  hope he can keep the job for saying the truth
Yessss truth!!!
Lmao. He really did nt want that conversation.
Whooops , Doctor spoke the truth
Well done about time nhs spoke out and now it time to answer but oh he can't answer they always run off ! Shame on the government 😕 don't care about NHS or us !!!!
#TheNewStasi
Who knows more about the body, the doctor or the vaccine experts? I hope when mr health secretary gets sick he goes to the vaccine experts.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
They're going to kill him soon. Then blame him for not taking the jab.
DO NOT GET THE VACCINE
Not getting the vaccine is just pathetic😂😂 how is he a doctor if he doesn’t even understand the importance of a vaccine🤣 just proves even medical staff and doctors can have IQs of frozen peas🤣🤣
Thankfully, someone has the guts to question - Wow, Sky actually broadcasted this!  The tide is turning.
Nurses of Nuremberg
Monthly product intake will not be harmless.
The fact the mR N A j a b pushers pretend natural immunity doesn't exist and have the gall to tell a physician that his natural immunity is "his opinion" shows just how bogus this all is.
take your national guidance and stick it up savid jabid ware the sun dont shine ....well theres a guide for ya
Well said.
Why do even "experts" keep referring to it as "jab"? It all just seems like a nightmare. And it makes no sense people keep comparing the flu shot but think about it the flu vaccine has been studied for well over 70 years it does not compare to this human experimental chemical it's fucked up
Breathe of fresh air to hear someone else say it. I was thinking the same thing all along.
Thanks for standing up for our freedom
So disgusting how someone sooo experienced MUST stand down.. SHAME ON HOSPITALS AND EVERYWHERE ELSE
Javid is a twt
Idiot
The nurses looked so uncomfortable at the question posed, and it was unfair of a powerful politician to bend the question to support his ideal. Brave Doctor, a keeper for sure.
Like he got slapped in the face when he heard that
Finally!! Thankyou Doctor.
Has anyone noticed that the video title says "NHS doctor," but the description says "consultant anesthetist?" Anesthetist is not an anesthesiologist MD. So far, there is no MD who are allowed to speak the full, unbiased truth. Those few who did, their videos got deleted. What remains are innumerous propaganda hidden in long-winded, seemingly compassionate, on-your-side-we-got-your-best-interest-at-heart tones rife with superfluous scientific/medical vocabs that say nothing. Some even go as far as dropping some seemingly "negative vaccine facts" or risking-potential-persecution tones. As a non-anti-vaxxer who is still waiting on an unbiased presentation on the pharmacokinetics of these vaccines, I think it's wrong to exploit our need for truthful, factual answers for profit.   What we truly need is journalistic integrity to be out of the ICU. Or am i too naive in hoping that journalistic integrity is still alive somewhere outside the twilight zone/X-file series?
Health Secretary doesn't sound too prepared for a logical argument from a real Doctor....
Well done that doctor for speaking out !! The 90% of others will be on the government payroll FACT ..
He has already had covid and has been in daily contact with it for two years. At some point the government have to start accepting the likelihood of natural immunity. That was their misguided plan at the start of the pandemic, but it might not be as careless and risky two years down the line.
Brave man. I respect him so much x
Why  is  there  NOT  a Realization   that  we  NEED   TO   CHANGE   OUR  OUT  LOOK.....   MONEY ! !         CONTROL ! !
THATS FINE BUT DONT FORCE IT !!!  STOP BEING SHEEP 🐑
He's conflating his own experience of COVID on the rest of the population. Just because he has had anecdotal experience of immunity from natural antibodies doesn't mean everyone who catches COVID will react in the same way. I think govt need to rethink the whole vaccine mandate to nhs staff because their jobs are so important to saving lives and they have had such a raw deal from the pandemic already. But he's now cast doubt on the efficacy of mass vaccination in the general public which is just going to end up with more people catching COVID + getting seriously ill from it. He's entitled to his opinion but don't think for a second that just because the nurses were silent doesn't mean they agreed with him or agreed with javid. There may be power dynamics we don't know about in hospitals and this was on national tv, if I was agreeing with either of them I probably would have kept silent too.
Finally a man with a set of balls!  Respect sir ✊
Most of this guys life was spent being a BANKER, people my god, he has the guts to try to talk down a doctor who has been on the floor this entire time....what is he doing in this position? Health of what... Deutsche bank? Since he did so well there
Given that vaccines have been around for 220 years or so, it's a bit strange that someone medical should start questioning the technology today. Of course I don't know his reasons but one of the anti-vaxer reasons I've come across seem to bear scientific scrutiny. Maybe he just doesn't like being forced. I can understand that but it is a political and not a medical objection.
People are still getting the virus, with or without the vaccine.
Dismissing his views and dismissing that health care workers will leave and we will be fugfed
Wow, this “official” thinks he knows more than a doctor!!! It’s is sickening & disturbing to say the least, to see how careful a doctor, an expert, needs to tip toe around the “vaccine” issue!! It is tyranny!!!
Hero....
Hatts off boy for raising your voice and awareness
Antibody is great protection.! Strong immune system is the answer!
Well done doctor
All hail the Almighty Police State
There is no debate needed. The evidence continues to show the vaccine is not as long lasting nor effective as a healthy diet, exercise, and natural immunity. The more spiked protein the more weakening of the immune system.
Lmao..we take recommendations from people "who are vaccine experts"..okkkkayyy...it all comes down to how much money can we make
Ha, a clear example of someone who knows what he is talking about talking to a bureaucrat - doesn't it seems like the biggest waste of time?
Good man!!
Wow
I am yet to read or hear a response from the 'vaccine experts' (Sajid Javid’s expression) to this Doctors specific points and articulate argument. The silence is deafening! They're clearly just hoping it all gets forgotten.
It's literally just a 10 second procedure why do people even make a fuss 🤷‍♂️
If the virus is crippling the NHS, why are they getting rid of the doctors and nurses? Nothing makes sense anymore.
Well done doc for standing up to the bully
Silly Doctor… just because they have antibodies does not mean they cannot transmit covid onto other people.. doesn’t have his patient’s best interests at heart
Hospital statement so pathetic 🙄 🙈
This is how they treat wonderful doctors, coerce them into taking the vaccine.  This needs to stop  because what next will people be bullied into having.  Are they trying to ruin the NHS?
Well, the other experts who know what they are doing in their respective fields are against forced mass vaccinations, good grief. Dr. Malone is one of them.  This baldie knows what he is doing.  He is being paid to do so.
"I respect your view" but we get advise from "vaccine experts" . If im going to a doctor to get vaccinated, he's the first person I'm going to trust about the medications he's giving me.  Its not easy to against the grain. I really respect him for this.  👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Brave and well educated doctor,bravo🤗❤👏
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 respect this doctor 👏
He says he’ll get opinion From vaccine experts??!😝😝 not from working every day doctors!!
Doctor big W
Hmmm, maybe ‘drug money’ is involved?
I'm on the doctors side, I won't have the vaccine neither.
yes....seems strange that thousands of nurses have resigned rather than get the jab.
Stand strong mate.
That Doc is a hero
The knowledge-less potato was struggling there 😅
There's science and facts, then there's politics and ideology.
Fantastic docktor!!!!
This doctor is a legend! 👏🏻👏🏻 He suggest we all follow his IG to show our support ❤️
Massive respect for speaking up. Mandating the vaccine is madness. Well, worse than that. Criminal actually.
even the nurses dont want the poison! 😎
Weird doctor. Too risky for everyone.
Main point! Remember that the MANUFACTURER is NOT legally liable for any short term or long term side effects from the covid vaccines!! The taxpayer pays for the vaccines manufacturing, to purchase them, and for severe damages only. While the manufacturer just cashes in the taxpayer money and has no legal liability.
we want to be jabbed every week!!!!!
Politicians telling health workers whats healthy!🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
🤡
Every one to two months to maintain some level protection. We have to do better
The mayor destroyed the doctors logic at the end by saying “vaccine experts” 😎
There not bothering about the poor people who have been vaccinated and are suffering terrible side effects.
It's not a vaccine it's a experiment
Who's is sajid Javid does he have a medical degree to be health sec?
The doctors who are dealing with it are the ones to listen to.
I am surprised this has not been deleted by youtube.
Skin head wants to take advice from vaccine experts 🤣🤣🤣 who don't have a clue on how to control the virus, But This doctor who knows and understands how the body works and how to tackle viruse and disease.
Shut up
He is brave!!! Well done Doctor.
The doctor probably isn't even anti vaccine, He's just anti mandate , Which i completely back
Minister shitting his pants and attempts to minimise what the doctor said,  by labelling it as 'a view'. Cock
Note he says we take the best advice from vaccine experts, didn't mention virologists. Vaccine experts = big pharma
Oh, I like him
I just read he had been sacked
a disgrace to the profession why not do the same for polio meningitis leprosy etc  the mans a fool
Wel said Dr. Mr S J is clueless...like we didn't know already!
The Health minister does not have medical knowledge and did bit study medical
I find the nuance of the English language rather amusing. Sajid Javid says "That's your view", but what he really means is "Your opinion isn't important".
The jaberoo is not safe and effective and besides that it flies in the face of sovereignty over our bodies.
If Javid wanted to be clever he should've asked the Doctor what % of covid patients in ICU are not vaccinated! What a load of rubbish from someone who should be setting an example.
On a really shallow note, this doctor is quite attractive. But he also makes his point calmly and objectively.
This mans a hero
Badman v Baldman
I develop migraine with virtigo after vaccine
My elderly father refuses to have the next vaccination, as he believes this virus is changing to quick for any vaccine to work.
All my respect to this doctor  Its a shame that doctors and scientists are not allowed to debate the vaccine issue makes it a conspiracy theory We need to have an open public debate on the vaccine issue and let the people decide whether they're comfortable and satisfied taking the vaccine or not.
Javid pants: 🦐 Doctor pants: 🍆
THAT ladies and gentlemen is a MAN  total bravery to speak up!!!
The health secretary didn't like the idea of that doctor not dying.
The Government is disgraceful in this mandate
I'm vaccinated.  I don't have a problem with people who don't want the vaccine as long as they're not pushing agendas. I have a lot of respect for this Dr giving his reasons sensibly and respectably. I hope he continues to be healthy and do his job well.
Remember clap for the NHS
They F'd us
Truth has to be told and well done Dr.
I'm praying for this MAN! A  man who is happens to be a Doctor! Hes no better than us, standing up for his rights!
Finally!!
Good to hear a real doctor being allowed to speak up instead of ignorant politicians and money grabbing pharmaceutical companies.
Bravo doctor! Speaking the truth!
This Doctor is a hero. The voice of many.
believe me there are alot of other doctors who has the same vision as him but they are to afraid to speak out against the goverment rules. and also they are all afraid of losing there job and the media is walking hand in hand with the goverment. sky news is like the only news station that is truly neutral
The vaccines not helping.. stop damaging people
So the Medical staff were praised back in 2020 without the jabs but in 2022 they’re not good enough if they don’t get vaccinated? Does not make any sense 🤦‍♀️ Well done, doctor 👌
I had my booster...I'll be fucked if im having anymore. This doctor is right & I now know I was stupid to get the vaccine.
The best part is Sajid asking the other staff for their so-called alternate view and them all choosing to stay quiet and not give any different view.  LOL and look at the man in the background pacing back and forth (white shirt, yellow tag, grey hair), my money's on him being one of the management staff who are overpaid and draining our NHS.
I hope he is not fired....much love to this doctor
👍👍
Respected love to the doctor
The doctor is absolutely right
Ugh, just like Greece. In the UK, the Health Secretary has never worked in a Hospital, not to mention, as a Doctor.   I Greece, the Health Sec. is a Former Lawyer, who has never worker as a Lawyer, nor as a Doctor... Good times...
Amazingly stupid statement by Kings Hospital, that they encourage all staff to take the jab, they 100% ignored the common sense argument that doctor made.  Its embarrassing to see that kind of gross stupidity in people in important positions like NIH  health secretary and Kings hospital admins.
Yes , sehr gut ! So muss es sein.  Toller Arzt!
Brilliant 🙏🏼
He's an anaesthetist, not an epidemiologist. "Pfizer and BioNTech confirmed that immunity from their RNA vaccine is still going strong (91.3% effective) six months after the second dose. Similarly, evidence for the Moderna vaccine shows 94% effectiveness six months following the second dose." Obviously there is differences for the new strains, but the vaccines work overwhelmingly compared to no vaccine. Hence 90% of those in ICU with C19 in UK are unvaccinated.
I like his opinion and he makes sense
Well done to this man, inspiring stuff.
I more trust the doctor.that your view 🤣🤣 his talking the truth it’s a plandemic
What this doctor is saying is completely correct and the 'very best advice' is wrong.
The proof that physicians not necessarily are smart is right here, ladies and gentlemen.
Health secretary? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 he ain’t got a clue! That doc needs to be prime minister!
I like doctor 👍😌
Well-done to that doctor for speaking up. A reasonable discussion is needed. This doctor gave a very courageous and we'll reasoned argument. I'm so pleased their are still doctors like this in our NHS. I would be very happy for this doctor to deal with my health care if needed. Please don't silence or dismiss such people. It would be a huge loss to kings Hospital.  Support, don't silence your staff. They have a right to their professional opinion, even if it differs from that of others. Science is about evidence base and being willing to re-investigate  testing mainstream theory and being willing to contradict it if needed.
I'm fully supporting the doctor, I'm unvaccinated, and will not be blackmailed into taking it either.
8 out of 10 end up in ICU bed are not vaccinated they spend months in hospital fighting for their lives, families crying on face timing their loved ones... the patients most of the time die of covid or if survived they will never have the same quality of life ever again.   I am seeing it every day hopeless and desperate situation for all healthcare workers. All nurses, doctors and consultants working so hard doing crazy hours in the last 2 years and then have to listin to this nonsense.
Respect for speaking out . I'm on the doctors side .
Swiftly moving on, cough cough
The truth is slowly coming out. Main stream media have always persecuted the unvaccinated in every way possible but now the narrative is changing as the Government try to look for a way out of their lies and corruption.  The media are complicit in the greatest medical fraud in history.
KUDOS! IF HE GETS DISMISSED, I'LL GO AND PEACEFULLY RIOT - I MEAN "PROTEST" IN FRONT OF NO 10
Nice of Kings college to pipe up?
Surprised sky news posted this
The doctor categorically stated that he had Covid antibodies. How would he know that? Oh! Let me guess. He’s had a blood test. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could all be tested for antibodies, but we can’t, it’s too impracticable. So until then, all we can do is to put our faith in a vaccination that will hopefully keep us out of intensive care units.
Sajid Javid isn’t even a doctor and he’s debating a medical doctor in his field , this is nuts
He should be sacked. No jab no job.
🇮🇪
I have worked for 20 years in the NHS and I am so sad that the NHS has come to this. Mandating ineffective vaccines that have not completed Phase 3 trials, destroying careers and livelihoods.
I wish I could of fixed this whole issue. I mean the doctor is correct, there is no moral to sustain such practices where everyone would be immune from the current problem around the world. Simple solutions is to rework the infrastructure and not the people because we are not used in this modern era to be told what to do, so there are other ways to do it which won't anger people.  Anyways, I hope that the current costs are somehow covered because I am unsure how we are going to pay them all after this whole issue ends one day.
This is excellent, what great timing. At last, a doctor is able to state his knowledge. Shame on the government for putting pressure on those that don't want the jab!
This is a real man standing up for the truth and his convictions!
If he's not an expert worth his opinion I don't know who is.
Absolutely agree with his submission; it's feels discriminatory to threaten livelihoods as a way to compel people to take the vaccine most especially so when the science isn't strong enough!
https://youtu.be/tbaDRf042m0
i support the doctor
Wow, an actual doctor with a back bone!
We’d like names please, who are these vaccine experts?  It is of great public interest to ensure that there are no conflict of interests involved in the strategy that is being chosen for their supposed health.  Transparency now!
Leave people alone and let them decide what they do or don't put in their bodies
Nobody appreciates these doctors who were/are working on covid wards. This is insane!
My BIGGER question is WHY he does not get vaccinated. Does he know something the general public does not know. Please tell us.
I think in the end at the 11th hour the Government will back down.
Well, it might've been important for that booster to lower the risk SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PERIOD. So not to boost us every 2 months, but manage the spread and risks.... Every doctor is NOT an expert on ALL health/medicine matters. There's virologists, they know how it spreads, how to prevent or stall it etc....
Well done to this doctor for having the bravery to speak his truth
When are we gunna stand up to this bull... they lie to us everyday. Boris is as useless as my left sock... lie apon lie. Us as a nation will stand up. Human right is out the window. I will be deaf to the malicious gossip of our government. I will fight till death appears in front of me
Funny how smug that guy was
Thats a good Doctor! We all want a Doctor who tell us the truth, its what they are ment to do. A politician on the other hand....🤔 nar!! Never!!
why can't the sheeple watch this and wake the f up, oh they have, and dismissed it as conspiracy🙄
Puppets of WHO picked wrong hospital for live tv😂 And for the Consultant big respect…💪👍 Stay strong People 💪💪👍
Love how we take medical advice from the likes of Javed, Gates, Zuckerberg and Johnson - all with no medical background
The non-vexed Doc is actually the one following the science.
Stand up to the bullies and expose their lies 👍
NHS doctor can agitate for his freedom and nothing happened to him! Why normal people like us can't?
What a great guy, wish he was my doctor
No shots or cruel sex medical procedures
We need more Doctors speaking out. The silence from the group of Nurses in this clip speaks volumes.
A courageous doctor who can think for himself.
Good man!
Next day he has covid jab lol
So many experts in the comments.
Bout time they aired some of this
I just cannot help myself..but I just wouldn't trust this health secretary one bit.. he is wearing face of someone who have long ago sold his soul and now just blindly following orders...
Respect to that man
There is no such thing as a vaccine expert
Whats funny is every place that's "complying" somehow always seems to have 90% of people agreeing to do it never anymore or less it's always 90% 🤔 🤔🤔
Yes I've seen this..   A shame all the Lemmings DON'T... NO AIR PLAY THROUGH MSM
Hero :)
👏👏
God love him.....very brave, very courageous....trying to argue with the devil himself....even Jesus didn't do that....Lord come quickly!!!
Silenced to a degree because he knows the con
At last someone with proper medical knowledge spoke up for all of us who do not want to take the vaccination for good reasons.  If SJ can be the health Secretary with no prior medical education,  I am sure my mother in-law can better him with her home cooking knowledge !
Best doctor ever
Fully agree with the Doctor
'That's your view', not it isn't. That is based on the science. This bald Politician just does not know what he is talking about. How I wish Russia or China invaded and took over, time we were run by competent people...they are not in this country.
Imagine seriously being treated in a doctor who refused to get the vaccine...
This idiot is a doctor?? And he doesn't even realise that vaccines are not just about transmission, but stopping people ending up in hospital?? He thinks he is 'courageous' and 'making a stand',  but he's a dangerous fool. Sack these twats.
Fair play to the news for showing this. This is a good start showing views of real people. Doesn’t really do much good for gov trust .. the politician didn’t see him worthy of debate
Bravo!!!!!😊
Yes thank GOD for this man 🙏 some sense at last
The dr switched from, transmission to no protection! What a dork
Big pharma would love to boost the world every month!
I agree with the Dr's point of view regarding making it mandatory for NHS staff to be vaccinated. However many people are taking this to mean he is against the vaccine of people altogether. This is not the case.
So he is telling him that hi is not an expert!
This doctor is a reasonable man using logic that clearly the 90% of staff in that hospital lacks
Well done to this doctor 👏 👍
I wish more doctors, nurses and scientists would speak up, and those that do should not get censored by media platforms!
Like he says he only listens to "vaccine experts" aka big pharma lobbyist. Corrupt c*nts, the lot of them.
Forgot to mention how over 140 studies prove that natural immunity is way better than the boosted one, for example the Israeli study proving x6 protection against hospitalization, x27 protection against developing sickness, compared to vaxxinated...
I think it's awesome that this doctor spoke his mind and explained his views. Health Secretary was completely unprepared for technical discussion which means he cannot clearly explain why jabs should be required. Just an unqualified beaurocrat who should not be doing this kind of work.
What if the vaccine experts have a conflict of interest and is looking to benefit their wallets?
I hope they dont fire this doctor… we need common sense and long term data when it comes to  vaccinations
I.love u doc thank u💕💕💕
Well done. A doctor standing up for the truth. Immediately they try to belittle his medical knowledge.
I've heard this doctor runs a covid clinic and is making good money out of it. Anyone got details on this?
The guy with no hair needed to be zab everyday for covid
This doctor was protecting the nurses from saying something that could jeopardize their jobs. He was saying what they all wanted to say
Oh they would love to poke us every month
'we take very best advice from vaccine experts'...says this numpty, and he's saying this to a Dr, when did they become health experts. Lol😂 what a joke, what a circus. All about greed, money n control n stripping us of all freedoms. Cudos to the Dr. Makes alot of sense
well done  DR
lot of agreement for the doctor and his Anti-bodies but people have still caught Covid 19 more then once, what happened to there Anti-bodies?
well done !
yes!!!! doctor talks sense
Legend
Vaccine experts (Pfizer CEOs and board members)
Why don’t people like this speak out for the public
The health secretary seemed clueless, just spewing standard government rhetoric
I'm surprised this doc is able to walk with balls this big.
The doctor is right to call out the health secretary. The health secretary didn't have an answer but rather than look out of his depth he predictably used rhetoric we hear all the time from the government to reply to the doctor's valid argument against mandatory vaccinations. How long can this uselessness government last?
Respect for this doctor!!!
Excellent footage ..
What's better than the courage shown by this doctor, is the fact that this was allowed to be aired at all. So much misinformation is not dissected and than allowed to be seen and in too many cases administered as the gospel (narrative). It's now time for an independent investigative journalist to bust it all apart.
I applaud this brave Doctor for standing up against nonsensical BS. Acquired natural immunity is the best one, every good scientific knows this.
Kudos to this young Dr for speaking up. I'd have supported him if I were one of those standing RN's
Good on him 💖
lolll vaccine experts. Does he mean Moderna etc 👀
The science isn’t there to justify compulsion. This is about increasing the power of the state.
Well done to him to standing up for what’s right 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 we shouldn’t be pressured or forced to take a vaccine 💉 very suspicious
He’s my friend and the way news cut this conversation is not a whole message it was much longer discussion
Is sajid a doctor?just asking.
👏👏👏👏👏
God bless Dr Steve James. 🙏✝️
Absolutely a Hero! 👏🏼
Oops
Maybe the government should investigate China’s bio lab 1 mile away from Wuhan instead of witch-hunting the unvaccinated.
Well done doctor tell him without any problems with all of the times when not explain information mean.
Totally agree with this doctor...and am behind him all the way!!!!!
I think this doctor is a hard core Christian
Health secretary so bloody patronising 🤬
Well said that Man he is Spot on
Kudos to this doctor for speaking up & even though I believe in vaccines taken to keep family members safe, I completely disagree with the mandate. Javed is a milquetoast and the debate on protection has been denied the public by the MSM.
👏👏👏
Hospitals: Just  because your staff has mostly "already done so" doesn't mean THEY WANTED TO!
The MD is not informed -- it does NOT help with "transmission" period! And anyone ANYONE heard the word "RISK" regarding vaccines on tv yet?
If majority of people get together those politicians wouldn’t 💩 on our heads.
0:06 longest 2 seconds ever
In your face vax salesman
What was the point of this he wasn't going to listen, the tw@
Well done to this Doctor for speaking up for common sense
Booster every month haikona This s nonsense
Good man
Good for that doctor for standing his ground
COVID 19 IS ALL B,S ... TELL THEM TO F.CK OFF    (     ;
I never thought I’d see the day where anti vaxxers actually won
I think the doctor is right and I thought the same about the booster. I got jabbed in order to follow the government and health advice. I think we need a mutating vaccine that can fight any form of Covid mutations.
I say all doctors and nurses who have been “canceled”  or/ and fired for refusing the vax should open a private hospital of their own. Lots of people like myself would HAPPILY help them fund it and get it off the ground since We no longer go to the doctors we used to go to out of mistrust.
He can  respect our freedom with his jab We are 49k health professionals living the nhs in April!!!!
I've been vaccinated but mandatory vaccines for jobs is a disgrace it should be an individual choice nobody should be forced to choose between jabs and there job.
I hope more doctors step into their hero scrubs as this one has! Thank u doc for speaking boldly in the face of media🤝
I give my humble opinion. I'm one of the people who never caught covid and I don't even know how it is, but for  respect for other people  I had two jabs, after all this time working with people on a daily basis and many of them ( people) even sick I still haven't caught this virus (Thank God), I think some people have one stronger immunity than the others, if the person feels at risk or sick, they should take care of themselves and be treated in-home or hospital, but I think we must learn to live with it ( covid), like cases of flu, the person just  has to rest and take the proper medicines, no everybody  should be forced to take the vaccines because I agree with the doctor there is no scientific proof, so let's stop to worry SO MUCH ABOUT COVID AND let's TAKE CARE OF OTHERS HEALTH PROBLEMS, for example, people who are suffering from aids, cancer, heart problems, etc, this covid has already given a lot to talk about, let's move on with our lives FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
Doctor 1 "Health" Secretary 0
all nhs stuff must get vaccinated before joining the NHS, its mandatory but now willing to lose their job not to get one and even after he admitted the vaccine does protect against the virus if for just a month
"Well, thats your view" eerm no, thats the science and whats been seen since day one by people working front line, not a politician in an office or a vax technician in a lab
LOGIC FEW OF THIS DOCTOR AND WELL BRAVE WELL DONE.   No need put NHS under pressure. If they keep leaving their job- who will safe the life’s then.   The Government ? ))))
Go on lad! Well done for standing up and shouting out 🙌🏼 bet some manager called him in an office once cameras were off!
Pure science being sidelined because since when does artificially induced immunity becomes more powerful than a natural infection ? If so why was it considered no necessity all this while for us to get vaccination after getting measles, chicken pox and mumps? Oh I forgot, ever since it can generate billions for Big Pharma and all the elitist who will benefit!
Huge witch hunt by the scummy British media now attempting to assassinate this man's character. They're so desperate it's beyond shameless
I already trust that doctor more than I trust Boris..well done
Agree with him
He missed the point, it’s not about him it’s about protecting others.
Respect!!
What a amazing guy well done for speaking out 👊👽
This Dr is right - do not over medicate
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
He was speaking nothing but pure common sense
Bless him🙏🏽
This doctor is very COURAGEOUS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Common sense. The government and media are the real virus
Oops!! There's the EXPERT word again right there at the end!! That's what people do when backed into a corner and lose the debate, they spew the EXPERT word 🤮
Like this doctor
“We take the best advice from people who are vaccine experts” wait I thought he was supposed to be the health secretary (which is supposed to be an expert)?
Respect! 👍
👏👏👏
Doc needs N95 mask at least, renegade!
well done Dr Steve, we need another view in the media!
Good on him
Respect to this doctor
Government agenda sponsored & pushed  by Big Pharma, not in the public interest! 💉💉💉🤦
Why would they air this? Many say this and it didn't get aired
well done to this doctor for speaking out
Dr. 💪🏼
This doctor who doesn’t want to be jabbed seems wearing masks not properly. Oh! Such a disaster.  People , at least wear masks please.
👍👍👍طبيب حر فيه الانساية
He's going to get fired XD
“From the people that are vaccine experts.” Ha!
So they want to dismiss this articulate and educated doctor who saves lives every day, and they will keep Caz and Baz from the back office in post, just because they do as they're told and had the vaccine? This doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
Great to hear this. Despite all the lies and condemnation of those which only seek the truth and pursuit of their rights and true freedom, staying true to oneself will set us free of this global tyrannical corruption
A bureaucrat tells a doctor who has treated Covid patients that he listens to the "experts" that never set foot in a Covid ward. God Bless this doctor.
Still doesn't answer this Doctors question. Why would so many staff take it knowing this factual data. Anyway, the truth is out. Wait and see. Sky news staff...lawyer up!
Yes well done! It is a pan-panic! Also watch Dr. Yeadon and Dr. Bhattacharya. Our immune systems can slaughter Corona and most viruses but not STUPIDITY!
https://youtu.be/QciiFYJJiJk
Well done to this Docter for speaking up
Shout out to this brother ✊🏿✊🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿he spoke nothing but truth
Politician refuses to accept medical info from doctor, instead relies on administrators advice
"...from the people who are vacine experts..." and that is how a politition shuts down a medical expert who has a sound argument. The hypocracy is openly being practiced. In the end, the politition basically informed the medical professional that his sound argument has been bulldosed.
From the people who are vaccine experts...aka from the people who stand to gain financially from more frequent vaccinations.
He just got owned
Well done mate!!   I mean well done Sajed for asking a doctor such a dumbass question and then getting owned.
Can I just highlight the tone and raised voice of the health secretary when he said “ we take advice from the vaccine experts”. Last ditch to win the debate in front of a frontline expert.
That’s my guy👏🏾
Someone buy this dr a beer for being politically and medically brave for the world to see.
Don't encourage him he will be giving jabs for breakfast.
It's amazing that an e-banker turned politician, made health secretary, by an ex-journalist turned prime-minister, because the previous unqualified person was dismissed for stupid behavior, is debating the semantics of vaccine mandates and their efficiency, with a Doctor that has worked in the covid ward from the onset of the plandimic and this ex-banker totally disregards the Doctors completely factual and rational view.
Stand firm. Stand strong
They are going to Vax U every 3 months
Well done to this brave doctor! ❤️
I will trust a doctor over a politician any day, sadly society is full of scared people who like the abuse of government, really quite pathetic.
respect for the doctor to speak up. by the way who are the experts?
The doctor admitted that infection he had provided him with antibodies, which will wear out similarly to the antibodies gained via the vaccine. Still he will not have the vaccine/booster to keep the level of antibodies... I understand this is his personal view and not research or based on a research.
Respect to thisdoctor. U cant force the nation. People have rights
great, for a change proper reporting from the media. shame the comments were cut when the anaesthetist said about majority of admissions were from co morbidities,  being overweight,diabetes etc...
Good for him!
For once sky news recommendation won’t get blocked by me….      for the 100th time.
Anyone that knows this legend should please give him a hug for me....He is a treasure! Weldone for standing up for the nurses.....their body language answers the questions Mr Home sec
There are a lot of doctors who feel the same way but fear to be ridiculed.
That was a slap to his face 🤣
Quite right, fk that clown
how many who have been jabbed  have fallen ill???
I know how many veins will we have left to punch through
Great see doctor telling truth fair play and sky actually let this air , is   funny seeing minster  lost for words though.
Wow, can we replace Fauci with someone as smart and brave as this Dr.  What we need is new meds and more research not to continue making Phizer rich!
Nothing but respect for that doctor
I have anti- body’s too, why would I want a synthetic trial ? Sajid is a patronising idiot who takes advice from hedge funders, not virologists !
Well said doc 👏👏👏 spoke the real scientific facts which makes so much sense & then the fake scientific comeback is such a joke because it makes absolutely no sense - how are they able speak such BS in response 🤦‍♀️
lol
The government have got this badly wrong for the reasons clearly stated by the doctor.
From the "vaccine experts" this is NOT a vaccine.  It is the equivalent to Tamiflu- it mitigates the symptoms..... for some.
No doubt this bloke's knowledge is way beyond anything I could ever achieve, but given how so many of Covid related deaths are among the unvaccinated, is it wise to dismiss the science behind the vaccines?
I personally regret getting jabbed. I am a healthy woman, and I don't know if the undiscovered side effects or if something went wrong it would've been worth it. I fully support him.
Its ok, Javid just wants to fire this doctor from his NHS role, then give him a new job in the private sector.
He should be setting an example by having a vaccine. Not a good leader at all
Sky news = staged
itll be in tablet form eventually and everyone will have a prescription 😂
Perfect. We need more people like this in this country. There are too many sheep just following orders. These boosters cannot have been tested and god knows what the after affects will be.
Finally a normal conversation about Covid not filed by emotion and people trying to prove a point!!
I almost feel sorry for Sajid…..errrr no I don’t ! I suppose they’re politicians acting on the advice from the drug companies (who are having a bumper few years!). Difficult situation all round.
Dumbarse Javed thinks he knows more than the Dr
Looks like the instruction has come through to change the narrative.   No way sky would keep this on their main news channel on YouTube unless they were told.
He has my support..i dont think mandating the covid vaccine is the right way
TRUTH!!!!
Salute to this brave man and for speaking your thoughts!!
I HATE the word expect because with how science is always changing they are simply the flavor of the week
This poor politician. Asked the wrong person there. Should of asked a useful idiot, not a useless free thinker!
Yes, top man!!! Clearly knows more about health than this financier!!
As a doctor I do strongly agree
I absolutely applaud this doctor, I personally chose to get vaccinated, however, I would be happy to receive treatment from any doctor, nurse or health professional regardless of their vaccination status, they should not lose jobs, they save lives, without them we will be in trouble, I couldn't imagine being told I can't receive treatment because they don't have enough doctors, nurses etc because they wasn't vaccinated, let them do their jobs, leave them alone.. they are being blackmailed.
Javid channeling The Dude "That's just, like, your opinion, man" nice try, egg.
Sad state of affairs when the logic used by a Dr is so full of Misinformation, Disinformation and Outright Lies. His view is a Political one, not a Medical one. The vast majority of Viral Variants are coming from The Cesspool of Mutagens circulating in the Pietrie Dish of Unvaccinated people. Delta came from the Unvaccinated in India, Omicron came from the Unvaccinated in South Africa etc. We need to get the entire world vaccinated to the point where the Covid Virus is contained to a small series of manageable outbreaks. Cheers from Michael. Australia.
“The science isn’t strong enough” The single most disregarded statement since the vaccine programme was launched. I’d rather listen to this guy all day long than the utter nonsense being pedalled by “vaccine experts” and a government that can’t even adhere to their own rules. I’m off for another illicit garden party.
lol advice from vaccine experts...are that the same ones making billions on it?
This doctor pointed valuable ponts.
Dr Steve James is a hero!. Javid is just another puppet!.
Dude was right
The man's an idiot and has not studied the science
Good on the doctor
Well said I work for the NHS also and will be leaving because I will not get the jab
The politician telling the doctor that he will ask the experts 🤣🤣
I admire this guy confidence in telling him the truth, this needs more views
Protect that man at all costs!
Nice one.
The way he says. That's your opinion.  He's a doctor his opinion is pretty special
Wish I never got the jab, made me sick for 5 months…
Para-Docs
I’m not anti vax but I’m glad I didn’t get the vaccine and I also have had covid nobody should be forced to get the vaccine or lose their job that’s just fkn wrong
But they would get fired because he says so
Doctors dont go to work because mr Javid is a health secretary
Let them do their job !!!
A prefer a medical worker who is unvaxed.  It proves to me they can think for themselves which includes my care - meaning they won't push whatever rubbish pharma and government are trying to force. I am for Freedom Clinics that are seeking donations to open.
Very good doctor even i don’t believe in vaccine poison
in italy a doctor speaking so openly, it would be immediately suspended from practice, if not radiated
Thank for this Dr standing up for all of us . I had my vaccine and the booster but I will never have anymore again. Mandatory vaccine is fundamentally unacceptable in a liberal democracy
Man's gonna get fired for stating irelevant facts that everyone knows an accomplished nothing
Well done my friend
The doctor deserves all the praise we can give him . Well done.
From people that are vaccine experts, I.e. the manufacturers, because a lot of vaccine experts and developers of previous ones, agree with the doctor.
People in the medical field understand microbiology
He could head up a new hospital just for the unvaccinated.
Good man,
We stand with the Dr!
Fully agree with the doctor
Vaccine experts ?  Those taken back handers from the giant pharmaceutical companies who are getting massive contacts from the government ... Next stage vaccine experts "we need a booster every month".
This doctor is a true hero here. He should be health secretary
As a doctor I'll say he is a disgrace. He already forgot everything about immunology
Doctors aren't scientists. Unfortunately this doctor doesn't seem fully aware of all the studies and the maths that show vaccinations work.
Surprised Sky news covered this story
101 in how to kill your career.
He needs to watch Jonathan Van-Tam's Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on BBC iPlayer!  This Dr is a gasman!
I thought Sajid Javid was quite decent during this interview. I'm fully vaccinated and think all healthcare staff 'should' be too, even if the science is not 100%. But I don't think that refusing to be vaccinated should be a sacking offense. Freedom of choice - and the pragmatics of not losing/alienating staff who have given so much throughout the pandemic - outweighs everything else. In the current situation. I hope the government listen and don't blunder along regardless. Mandatory jabs would be a) wrong and b) a mistake in my opinion.
I love this and i can't stop watching it .
It's called freedom of choice also in line with freedom of speech which we aren't allowed to express with being branded a racist or other crap it's what are forefathers fought and died for and in there life time it's all lost by corrupt governments wanting control
Bet the bold 1 lost his job speaking yhe truth
Sajid is SO rude - he doesn’t even have a medical degree !!
Great doctor ❤
I admire your morals and integrity young fellow, stay strong.
Very gud  doctor we r with u  welldone doctor
His body his choice i respect his choice. As long as he wears a mask when hes in close contact with patients and gets tested daily then whats the problem.
i would like to see a breakdown of coronavirus deaths of age brackets per 20 years and what the top 5 or 10 comorbidities are included in the death counts. this is an obligatory oath to public health as doctors and the news to provide this information
A Warrior of Truth ....................................
Poison vacc
It does make perfect sense tho
That bald man is a nasty piece of work
The nurses look thrilled at that question.. too scared to voice their own opinion. Well done to this young Doc.. this man wants to help people, dedicate his life to medicine and this is how we treat him ?!? Absolutely disgusting!
That's impossible every month feel sorry for the NHS staff well done inspesking the truth 👏  need to improve vaccine booster that it .last longer then a month
This is it lads the New World Order.
Vaccine experts - Pfizer and Moderna current, past or future employees and shareholders... Sick
Welll done doc 👏👏👏
Good man himself ✌🏼
I wanted to hear more from this Doctor ...more should be talking about it
The NHS needs more people like HIM, not the lying and manipulative, brainwashed sheep it currently has
HERO
Idiot should be taking pointers from VIRUS experts and virologists.  NOT VACCINE EXPERTS.  That's why Covid is still a problem. It's because of idiots like this Health Secretary. Knucklehead.
Medical care by RACE in the USA: https://youtu.be/u8ywWgNEYuQ
What an amazing and brave person to speak out. Let people do what they want to do but penalising people for listening to their body and mind is against every humans right.
Well done 👏
Let's go Brandon!!!
Legend
Wow. How quick did Saj wanna move on! He literally has no clue what this man is telling him. "vaccine experts" agenda pushing experts maybe.
Wise man, real science 👏
Javid trying to swerve.
Pukka Nurse told him how it is.
Very awkward, this medical staff treating vulnerable people categorically refuse to take the vaccine wow! These are the people we are depending on whilst we feel forced to take the vaccine when they refuse! Not good. I took 3 and I will not take a fourth! That is it.
I agree , the doctor,s natural immune system will look after him
Doctors are all silent 🤫
I agree , the doctor,s natural immune system will look after him
So he won't mind taking unpaid leave while his claims are independently verified in a lab then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Good on him.
"People who are vaccine experts" Reads actually "people who WE choose to be vaccine experts"  There are many experts out there who do not agree.
javid on how coruption works doctor on medicines each to there own
I've just written to my MP , incorporating quite a few YouTube video sources, for the TRUTH from people like the inventor if the MRNA strand Robert Malone.  There are very many trying desperately to get the TRUTH out. Thank goodness my MP is open minded
Tbf he’s a doctor, but that doesn’t mean he has studied vaccines and fully understands them.
Bravo!!! Finallu someone has balls to talk about it!
Well done that man
doesn't it just show it's not about a virus just control.. getting everyone in every few months to comply or your freedom is limited.. Evil.
The NHS are mandating vaccines its not just advised
Legend
"that's your view"... no, it is called science. It can be peer reviewed and debated, when permitted to
The nurses was scared to share their views. That says a lot about not feeling comfortable in expressing true thoughts. (Especially for those who aren’t jabbed) Thanks Doctor. It’s okay to have a different opinion.
What I don’t understand is what the issue is with having a vaccine? Where’s the evidence that its a BAD thing?
Love at 0:40 he tries to escape and asks for other views and gets no response.
Straight from the doctor's mouth
It was obvious what the nurses response was
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Bravo Doctor, finally someone wasn't afraid to speak up.
The most likes I've seen sky news has got on a video 😆 🤣 try harder corrupt establishment 😆 we know what's going on and they will see justice. What happened in nuremberg to the doctors and media that lied??? Yous bricking it yet main stream media ?
Very courageous to speak up his mind. I respect this Doctor!
God forbid they ever listen to doctors and real scientists
He’s a very clever man, the dr knows what he’s talking about
Great doctor speaking the truth. Fear no one but Allah he feeds all the creation on the earth 🌍.
"That's your views "  That's not his view  He just views the reality of the science properly
Them tube won’t even let me comment in favor of that man !!!
Silly man doesn't really have a logical argument. Does he have a problem with the safety of the vaccine or the fact they can't administer every month? Just because he's a Dr, doesn't mean he knows what he's talking about. 🤦‍♂️
Good man well said!!! :))
This doctor  deserves a 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Health secretary looks a fool.
Bravo that man!
OMG, this guy is a saint ❤️
Respect this man!
Which of these 2 men is most likely  to help people who need medical help?
Respect to this doctor
Does anyone else think it’s kind of weird that the Kings College Hospital literally called it ‘jab’👀. This man spoke so professionally, didn’t raise his voice to drive home why he won’t get the vaccine. Really nice seeing medical professionals voicing their concerns and backing it with facts.
I agree with Dr. ❤️😘
Did this guy really just tell a doctor that they were going to take the advice of real experts like this doctor isn’t one? As if he hasn’t been on the frontline of this virus working to save lives.
At first i was applauding this doctor and all of sudden i realized that satanic sky news wants this to go viral and have us injected every month, its called false opposition a playbook trick  from pedophile billionaires
idiot spreading misinformation, there’s more than enough science to get vaccinated?
a man apart.top resepct he aint NO sheep
Pity the nurses were completely mute. It should not be one lone voice whilst the other stand there like useless idiots.
In my opinion... this NHS doc has a good opinion. However, he's also speaking reckless knowing the trauma patients go through and the loss to life.
Vaccine expects that no what about this virus?? Nothing and no one really does I think I'll take the advice of the dr working with these patients day in day out thanks. Petty little man doesn't like being challenged.
See how the interviewer tried shutting the doctor out because his answer did not fit their agenda.He got caught off guard from hearing that from an actual doctor.This whole thing is an absolute joke and a scam. I got two jabs last year;no more!
Secretary’s response only serves to confirm this is not about a virus or “science.” It’s about $$$ and QR code’s.
We take the best advice from the people that are vaccin experts xD. His famous last words xD
he shouldnt just think about himself, he should think bigger and let it be a free choice. not only the ones who had it but also those who simply dont wnat that experimental jab!
Could not be said  any better.
Vaccine experts ie the maniac Bill Gates of Hell
Smart guy
The Tungsten balls on this guy!
Man said vaccine experts 🤣
"We take our advice from experts in the field"  like an anaesthetist would not have done his own scientific based research.
Soon the government would assassin those people who speak the truth to warn us
Fantastic doctor! Speaking the truth about the ridicolous protection of vaccines. I hope they listen to him and to the other experts against mass vaccination.
Legend! get him on the advisory board so we can stop faffing over a cold and get back to normal
The vaccine is about reducing serious disease which takes significant NHS resources. Check the numbers in ICU who are in vaxxed.
Brave and sensible doctor and completely right about natural imunity and the vaccine.
Wow best truful doctor
We need more honest doctors like this.  Good job with being honest.
Amazing to have anti vaxxers leading the front line.
The doctor who told the health secretary this remark about being unwilling to have the jab is an opinion that is shared by many and rightly so.
Shocked that this is being shown..  so what is *THiS* a distraction from
Doctor dodged the question about his antibody protection waining just like the vaccine.  Had an answer for everything else, but not that.
Javid says there will always be a debate about it, but there has been no debate surrounding this. They have just taken the word of the scientists who are making and selling the drugs or the tv scientists and doctors not on the front line. Let’s have that debate on TV just like Brexit / remain and then think about decisions. There will be thousands of experienced NHS workers kicked out in April. Just res3arch this Doctor and see his credentials they are phenomenal.
Absolute legend 👏🏼
Another doctor who should stick to his day job, instead of hogging headlines.
I never had the first jab nor the second jab and I am not going to have the booster. I have been out and about since 2019 before Covid-19 become fashionable and have simply let the immune system deal with it. Let nature take its course and feck the vaccines that clearly do not work as well as claimed nor last very long! Many NHS and GPs and their families have refused the vaccines. The pharmaceutical companies are taking the piss and making a fortune £££££££££.
The health secretary didn’t really know what to say did he? I took the first two VAX options, but they had a very adverse affect on me, so when I find out that a booster is only going to give me up to 10 weeks protection, I’m afraid I have now chosen not to have the booster. I am being careful, but I just don’t want to risk another shot.
I'm next to this man... no way am I getting stuck with an experimental vaccination. Every month now lol. Unfortunately only darwinisum will save us.
Great guy, someone who had the guts to stand up and speak out. How dare they try to force NHS workers to vaccinated or get another job. They weren't saying this back in 2020.
Well what's this telling everyone? Firstly this shows the government is not following any science,  this is a qualified Dr talking and here's  this idiot Javid arguing with him!! Secondly if medical staff are refusing this vaccine what does this tell us???!!!!!! People need to wake themselves up!!! If medical staff are prepared to walk away from their jobs rather than take this vaccine then this confirms things are not right!! Not to mention that countries  that mandate them is because they cannot get people to take it without force!!! Bad move! There will be back lash if they carry on like this.
Novak Djokovic!
Politicians lie doctors don’t
He right
A brave doctor speaking truth for thousands of health workers and people. No one shall use force to administer injections into your bloodstream. And no one shall threaten your livelihood with such a weak scientific base.
I bow to  Mr.DOCTOR.
Vaccine experts lol
Well done to that Doctor speaking from the heart
The guy conducting the interview was just not open to that doctor's views. At the end he condescendingly remarked that "We'll take the views of those who are vaccine experts", effectively dismissing what the doctor was saying
Great doctors are speaking up.
A man with principles!...
These so called health officials want to way in everything but won't release data
All the pro experimental vax lunatics are unusually absent from the comments 🤔
He obviously doesn’t care about the patients then….
They understand how underestimated the mutation possibility of retrogenes is.
I love this Doctor! Well done for speaking up! I really hope that people start waking up and stand up for themselves.
👏 Well done to the Dr
And all the nurses shitting themselves
Go for it doctor, tell them the truth 👏
I respect his opinion way more than the daily mail reader who won't be vaccinated because "I don't know what's on it". I hope anti vaxxers don't see themselves as equally informed as him!
the doctor tell the truth this guy a clown my god sky news showing real  actually news/they must be scared of G B news trying to get back there terrible ratings bit late
That right there is a Man  💪🏼
what did the doc say  ""a booster every month "" ??? .
no doctors or nurses should be penalized for not taking a untested jab
The doctor is my kind of guy, not afraid to say what most people are afraid to say publicly, Donald Trump kind of guy
At last a doctor who's not afraid of speaking the truth and still the health Secretary thinks he knows best! What a brave soul that man has we need more of them to come forward!
What i find dismaying is that the expert has given a scientific and practical analysis but the secretary still wants to hear 'opinion'
And that’s a doctor who knows what he is talking about so who am I to disagree
The question is simple. Does vaccination stop infection? We all know the answer so may your conscience to follow...
Such a shame that this man feels scared to speak out. A doctor ffs. And the evil Jabhead then says we basically agree to disagree. We're living in 🤡🌍
🤫 👕👍  *Javed got OWNED big time!*   😳 👖
*THIS VIDEO SHOULD HAVE 1B VIEWS* bravo for the doctor 👏
Amazing respond dr. James !!!!! Well done
Lol all the women stayed quiet and the man just clearly stated he weren't happy... interesting
People with antibodies should not have to vaccinate.
I can't believe I'm witnessing truth being spoken out like that in the UK and from a medical professional to boot Wow. It's usually only fringe channels.
Imagine being a HEALTH secretary who has go NO clue about HEALTH what an embarrassment.
I'm stunned at how many sheep there are in britain, they've said they cannot keep the vaccines up as there's a shortage n belive me there is my puppy cannot even get jabbed it's disgusting and also selfish really... So god bless this doctor we need more to speak truth like him.
Oh look, 1 professional out of 1 million who agrees with me, guess this confirms what I've been saying this whole time to be true.
Absolutely well done.. We've all been told that this has always been about protecting the NHS.. And now there threatening to sack them if they don't conform.. Utterly disgusting..
Well said that man.
He’s a plonker.
Awkward!
Thankyou to this amazing doctor and Thankyou sky for actually allowing us to talk amongst ourselves for those that agree with the so called doctor. Our voices are usually shunted out via social media.
What a beautiful, smart, brave and intelligent person....
The science isn't strong enough? Nuts. If he was listening, he had to stop right there. What is his benchmark and standard?
Tell that jabbit to jab off, we don’t need him he not a doctor, pretending he knows everything, get rid of the little pretentious git ASAP.
Thats some factual points he pointed out there. Brave doctor 👏
The guy that invented the mNRA vaccine agrees with this doctor and got banned from twitter for it.
Alguien que no tiene idea de nada poniéndose con un DOCTOR. El otro solo recibe un sueldo por andar haciendo preguntas estupidas. El DOCTOR recibe un sueldo porque estudio. La diferencia de tener libros en la cabeza con uno que tal vez solo por tener buenos conectes está donde está. Al DOCTOR TODO MI APOYO 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
I worked in a nurses house today and funnily enough she was saying this is the general consensus in her particular hospital. Apparently the amount of heart attacks they are seeing is immense now. No booster for me I think
Hero
He made very valid points none of which Sajid was willing to discuss, in fact, no politicians are willing to discuss, instead we get blanket answers, if we had more information and clarity then people would be more prepared to make a decision
Well said Doctor!
I regret having my jab
RESPECT.
Very well communicated. This man made a lot of sense and calmly communicated his point. It would be a shame for the NHS to loose him.
If everyone'd followed the lead of this 'brave doctor', the UK health system would've collapsed a long time ago.
Actually please note that the unvaccinated doctor has since admitted he made a mistake. I know everyone loves to find the proof to back up their claims but sorry it doesn’t and he said so later.
Everyone has their views and I respect how calmly he came across and explained to him why he has the views he has
Respect for him speaking up. A little surprised maybe that a Doctor is opposed to getting a vaccine though, regardless of how ineffective he believes it may be. His job is to save lives and thought he'd want to do what he can to continue that effort
That was embarrassing.
LEGEND !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sadly, goodbye then…..
Notiest  how they blow off what the dr says
Natural immunity is superior and robust.  Spend money on real health
Za začetek "PRENEHAJMO NOSITI MASKE ČEZ NOS". To start: "STOP WEARING MASKS OVER NOS". This is what GT gave me: "LETS STOP WEARING THE MASK OVER OUR NOSE"
Legend!!!  I work in a hospital lab, have done throughout this whole thing. It’s been what- 2 years now?! I’ve handled covid swabs, blood samples from covid positive patients……I haven’t gotten sick ONCE, not even a cold!  I don’t have the vaccine, and I’m shocked because this has been the longest in my life where I haven’t picked up anything ( I normally catch anything and everything going) The only thing I’ve done differently is drink a decent amount water regularly…I never use to drink any 🥲
Slap head just chose to ignore the Doctor, typical.
TOP MAN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What a brave doctor, voicing his concern, respect to the doctor, and he is a health professional
doctor is legend !!!!
We are ruled by stupid people. People need to wake up.
Brave doctor teaching me something new
They dont care about real doctors or scientists  They really want to hear them own narrative. Incredible
HERO
The interesting thing is Pfizer staff are exempt. Tells me all I need to know. Let's see what the fda has to say for themselves in 8 mouth as they have just had the 75 year data release date refused.
The manager in the background looked hot under the collar!  Truth is coming out and this Doctor has common sense!
Balls!!! Nice job doctor 👏👏👏
There's plenty of people talking sense, but it's rare to see a frontline doctor on mainstream news talking sense. Brilliant!
I'm  currently sick with COVID and it sucks, I feel lousy. However, I'm trying to be optimistic and think ahead to the natural immunity I'll have once I recover!   I think it appalling how the discussion on natural immunity to this virus has been shut down. I understand there are immuno-comprimised people, and they should definitely take steps to protect themselves. I think normally healthy people should do so as well by staying home when they feel sick, and engaging other common sense health practices. However, the shutdown of debate on the matter of natural immunity is extremely concerning, and the fact that many experts don't even want to further study it is concerning too.
Respect for speaking his mind 👏
The health secretary in this case made himself look like he had very little knowledge of the science here.
How honest is the message at the end?
So much respect to this guy for standing up to the reporter and hitting him with facts live on tv ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Look even the nurses were like ehhh... They don't agree with it either ha
Awkward 😬
Being a key worker myself, I have been exposed to diseases worse than Covid. I respect this doctor and I applaud him. I think the government is very disgusting to force people in social care to have both vaccine by April 2022.  And if they compared how many people has died from cancer, hiv, hepatitis ( these are only few) covid hasn’t even reach the top 3. Because I have seen with my own eyes how doctors are claiming that someone has died of covid while the person died of other diseases.
👏 for this man.
We all know Mps are getting paid millions by the drug companies
What a wonderful doctor, we really need more like him to speak out. He is working on the front line daily, long hours. He is the right person to assess this viruses. If. Not a travelling payroll politician.
Great man
I stand with the doctor and applaud him, clearly the nurses think the same  but aren't as brave.... People should have the right to choose...they shouldn't be dismissed if they choose  not to have it.
Bravo, Doctor!  It is about time more people spoke out.
We take the best advise from Vaccin experts. Oh my word, what an idiot. Cringe moment, but alas the stupid asshole politician has to much arrogants.
Former HEALTH SECRETARY doesn't know a thing about HEALTH.. remember he's was part (probably still is) part of the bankster cabal
Javid is well out of his depth...
Well done doctor
This doctor is a hero.
Good on Doc 👍
Wow
Calm key facts posed to the health secretary and he just can’t answer. I’m a nodding dog who implements things I don’t understand but The info does come from experts……. Apparently
That doctor did not kill himself lol
This is quite revealing and I'm surprised MSM ran with it.
Now I saw an article on MSN they start to discredit him and talking crap about how much he charges for private patients. I'm sick of this world
Health security is such a weird power mad hob goblin
Free nation! All my love from italy
Doc talks sense!
Vaccine experts he said.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Finally  a rationale  person that  gets it.
Very well said, there are lots of doctors, scientists and specialists in this field that said say that COVID is like any other illness that can be cured with normal medication or even home remedies. It's not as dangerous as governments picture it to us over the last 2 years. But indeed they try their best to use it as a mean to spread fear and to dictate new laws against the will of populations across the world.
I agree doc!! And the comment the man said, vaccine experts? Smh
The nurses were petrified to the point of being unable to speak. They knew they were about to be canceled and taken to the gallows or guillotine.
The Doctor knows what he talking about.Natural immunity is better than any vaccine. The clown speaking to him is part of the problem. In plain english a follower with no brains he works  probably for the NIH or pharmaceutical company.
A real doctor says it like it is. A disgusting vile politician cannot make an argument against.
There is no need to debate this; first, the vaccine developer does not guarantee that the vaccine will work 100%; also, they ask for immunity as they are not sure or guarantee there are no side effects.   I personally three times vaccinated as I trust NHS. However, it is unethical, and I am against enforcing vaccination on people. Nevertheless, concerning NHS paid for treatment, the only logic is “ when a person does not trust NHS and reject the vaccination he will not be subjective to free NHS treatment if he gets infected with COVID”. Alternatively, work has nothing to do with the vaccine.  We have become an authoritarian country, and this is not the nature of this country.   Job and work should be used as knowledge transfer with payment between the company and the employee, but people are not trained enough and become controlled. The job becomes permission for People who are allowed to live and unemployed who are not allowed to live, and a hidden network controls this action. This explains why we start seeing illogical decision-making, unscientific approaches to behaviour, and much more.    England was providing the entire world with knowledge in management; unfortunately, we are unable to manage our things, and COVID is clearly showing that there are no right people in the right place.
The irony they disclosed 90% of their staffs status ....what a mess, damage control lol
Don't forget the biggest clue, the Leak in 20 10.
VERY BRAVE PERSON, SUPPORT TO HIM
Whatever about the jab, be wary of any narrative that cannot be challenged for fear of losing your freedom/job/education/relationships etc
Finally someone telling the truth.
At last someone who knows what he is talking about instead of stupid  MPs and there flocks of sheep. This doctor is my hero and should get more support from the medical profession.
Bravo for speaking up, natural immunity is the best, do not comply
"we have the vaccine experts".. it is not a vaccine but  a gene therapy still on trial ( we are the testers) until 2024, so, who are the so-called vax experts? bigpharma experts? a bit of a conflict of interests i'd say ..
What a brave Dr for explaining the science to the secretary. Let’s see how long YouTube leaves this video up… I’m sure it will be very well hidden in some search algorithm at best soon! What an encouragement to see that some Drs standing up and following the science.
No need for a disclaimer KCH. It wouldn't bother me to have an unvaccinated person care for me. Let's put this into perspective. The anaesthetist has excellent points to raise.
He may have antibodies, but others around him may not. I can't believe that he would wear such a crappy mask that wasn't even covering his nose properly.
This doctor should get a knighthood for saving lives rather than that  tony Blair  bloke who forced us into a war to. Kill people and destroy buildings
YouTube automatically delete comments in regards to safety... If I mention the obvious it's automatically deleted
Experts - synonym - satanic idiots!!
We take The very best advice   From the vaccine experts …. And how. Many of them work on the front line  cos of course that doc working throughout the pandemic on the front line is just an amateur  ….. And how many of the so called experts have declared their shareholding’s in the vaccine companies ?
That 4-5 seconds of silence from all the nurses says it all…..why would they want their colleagues to be sacked? This guy said it all, unjabbed and working on front line from the start and has antibodies, this will be the case for the vast majority of doctors and nurses.
Good doctor is hard to find. Not as hard to find as a good journalist. But almost.
Finally, someone is talking sense. Or at least allowed to talk sense and not being censored or silenced. Good on him for speaking up!! More health workers need to step forward and tell the truth. The public deserve to know and actually practice informed consent.
Health secretary has no clue. The doctor was correct on the antibodies. Your going to boost everyone every month.
Yes finally it’s on national tv!! This is called responsible journalism. Well done Dr for speaking up.
All our professionals in the medical field shouldn't be risking their lifes and families because the government wants to keep the money floating in our country.
It will be interesting to see if said doctor is penalized for stating his opinion so well.
Well the actual scientist not allowed to speak
I agree with the a doctor.I too have had covid and have anti bodies and they are doing a damn sight better than any jab the government is pushing 💪🏾
There are more of these great and honest doctors I think but they are afraid to speak and that makes this one a true hero. Unafraid to speak the medical truth.
Sack him he took an oath to do no harm, sack him he's a coward hiding behind that fact that he got covid19 how many people did he give it to🤔🤔
I’ve had Covid, it’s not nice but I got through it, I’m not vaccinated and don’t intend to be either. People who are vaccinated have had it too so I’m still questioning it’s use in terms of fighting or preventing anything.
He makes a very good point. Even though the general picture with Covid is very unpredictable and rapidly changing the current vaccination methodology is not sustainable in the long term. The BIGGEST improvement that needs to be made to vaccines right now is to increase the longevity of protection from antibodies from a few months to at least a year so that it becomes more reasonable and sensible to get a booster at an annual basis (just like the Flu jab). It will also be more cost effective as the NHS will have to buy a lot less doses to keep the general public safe from Covid which is what we should be aiming for.
Well said lad get in
God bless him and above all  protect him. Italian medical doctor De Donno was murdered for telling truth. Look for
It’s funny how a banker is debating with a doctor about the vaccine 🤣🤣.. We might as well take how to stop addiction lessons from a Junkie
That health secretary needs to be put in jail for what he’s done to the country and the our NHS
these experts are morons payed by the pharmacy companies , real doctors are the experts not the tv morons
As a nation we need to make sure this man isn't fired or disappeared for speaking his opinion and answering the question asked. It's a shame the bank manager thinks he knows better.
Epic fail on this Ministers part. Perfect execution of a politician dismissing the Dr. for the narrative sold by the "vaccine" experts....who are those experts. Dorothy don't look behind that curtain! History will prove the Gov incorrect.
I wonder what his opinion would be of someone riding a motorbike without a helmet ? IMO it is the equivalent to being an antivaxer.
These days a good doctor is about as hard to find as a good JOURNALIST. Both are in short supply.
Thankyou for speaking the truth Dr.James.
Why are good doctors like this next to non existent in this day and age?
This is what it looks like when a sensible person tries to use reason against a nonsensical agenda. It looks like seeing a live action character inserted into a cartoon world.
I like this man
Every respect to this doctor!!!!!!!!
Lmao at all the sheep’s
Damn right! Well done for speaking your truth
Salute to the doctor!!!
Why does near enough every politician sound like Boris Johnson
But we need to make more money from the vaccine so please get jabbed
Tell the truth my friend!
ARISE DR. STEVE JAMES!!!!!!!
Can we know, who are vaccine experts.. Is there higher weightage to vaccine manufacturers or monetary beneficiaries of booster doses??
Okay 👌 Gud job doctor informing us
This has become like a religion now. Theyll have this Dr up in court for blasphemy. orwellian behaviour
What a brave man. Perhaps politicians should stick to politics. Its a crying shame there has not been one decent mainstream  debate.
Finally ! Someone who was willing to speak up ! As NHS frontliners we should be respected and not held hostage to give up their job or get a vaccine
Well damn🤣
Finish this all circus. Put in jail these all COVID actors!
I'm more shocked that sky news allowed this to show. People have been speaking up over covid for over a year if not longer.
STAND FIRM 👍
The government can share our personal medical data with foreign corporations, but they won’t share their own protocol on the matter with us? I’m out.
Brilliant. That Javid needs a slap to wake him the f*ck up
Antibodies gives very little protection though. Moron.
Very proud of this guy standing up for what he believes not using emotion but using science. And the disrespect shown to him by saying advice from vaccine experts. This guy works on the front lines and treats patients everyday I would say his opinion holds a lot more weight then the idiot health secretary. Give that guy a promotion for standing by his oath
I'm with this Dr. I'm not getting the vaccine myself
Javid hasn’t a clue what to say.
Any vaccine that hasn’t been researched for many years would be risky to anyone.
i like this man very well said
When tou watch a politician teaching medicine to a doctor 😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷
Now this is news. This is good, well done doc with the good common sense
Looks to staged . Vaccine pills ?
This man's a man that has been on the front line and has more knowledge than most,  Also a man who's going to lose his job.... crazy
What has been produced are not VACCINES but Javid insists he'll be taking advice from VACCINE EXPERTS.
Smart Man!
Who are these vaccine experts?! Where are they? PULLING MY HAT 🎩 to the Doc who answered for his staff as even the nurses felt uncomfortable. As an ex NHS worker and still in contact with former colleagues I can say that the majority of my old department IS NOT vaccinated! Humanity has always survived to this day and that even before big Pharma!
Hero
Health liar not secretary
The comment section here is absolutely wonderful ❤️ that’s how it should be. We all respect each other choices. Nhs staff are significant workers 💕. They deserve freedom of choice and a pay rise!
Go on doc! Tell them
Somethings up.. This wasn't live. Why release it? Sly News has suddenly jumped ship? I doubt it very very much.. Whats the angle? Who knows but not good..
We don’t need people like him in the nhs infecting at risk people, his only concern was his own well being…………. At least now he’ll have more time now to watch David Icke videos👍
Well said doc
I bet Javid parents wanted him to be a doctor.
A Doctor talking to a Banker..........
No profits for big pharma with natural immunity
wait until this dr and nurses get infected and then spread it to unhealthy people in the hospitals. that is the cherry on top of the cake! going to an hospital to get treatment "if lucky" and end up getting covid because a dr and a nurse are too selfish to do the right thing. nobody seems to be talking about that besides boris...
Yes , this man is 100 percent correct
I am fully vaccinated, but I agree with what he is saying and don't think anyone should be forced.
background to the virus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcQZ5GE1jf0&t=21s
Oooh my God, I love his honesty. ☺👏👏👏👏👏
Protect this doctor!
Herd immunity comes at a cost, so far its   around 5M dead and rising, and there are no guarantees that it will help if a new variant comes along, which is clearly possible, due to the profit motive holding back mass vaccination and other public heath measures. This doctor fails to grasp that this is about more than just his feelings.
Respect to this staff member, very logical argument and eloquently put, I hope he stays safe and is able to stay in his role. I'm boosted and am grateful, but respect to this man's explanation of his choice.
Hey Queen, make this doctor a Sir asap!
so the plan is to get shot every month?
Well done that man! The health secretary stuck for words! Priceless!
"nearly half the staff that we havent fired already is 90% vaxxd!!"
May God reward this Doctor with everything
The secretary just basically dismissed everything the Dr said.  We take the information from experts.  What a Fk, the secretary is.
It's amazing the comments on here, detailing the TRUE nature of the public. And all we get shown is a mainstream biased narrative.
big respect for this doctor!we are with him!
“We take our advice from experts”… He’s an expert 🤦‍♀️😔😒!
Imagine being the Health Secretary for a nation and not having an answer to this very important and logical question someone hasn't done their home work 🙃
Spot on
this is why there will never be a national debate
He got told and had no real comeback , why is he doing that job
Has anyone else noticed he didnt respond with genuine answers or a counter argument he just kept trying to push the vaccine.. I wonder why, it's not like they're making billions of pounds from it
We take our advice “from the vaccine experts” - Who are their so-called ‘vaccine experts’? Pfizer CEO, Fauci, Ecohealth.
Great informative answer 💗
Well done to this doctor for presenting his own research and opinion of the vaccine. The health ministers reaction is exactly why people are hesitant about getting vaxed. The condescending response and hiding behind “experts” without giving any real content is a big problem. He should set up a debate with his panel of “experts” and a room of doctors who have questions and concerns like this about the vaccine so that these experts can address any concerns anyone might have. There are clearly a lot of unanswered questions that the government is not telling us and I think full transparency will elicit more trust on this vaccine.
Respect for the doctor 👍👍👍
So proud of this doctor who stood up for himself and eloquently expressed his view. The others seemed too afraid to speak up. Freedom of speech is becoming a theory
Good for him
Bravo 👏
Jab for this jab for that they will be saying we need a jab to see properly next
And that's his life work over with by the decisions of a bald fuckwit who's  answers are fuckwitty!
Great Doctor. Speaks truth!!! We need more doctors like him.
This doctor needs to create a gofundme page. I want to give him money!
Finally I don’t feel alone in my views
https://youtu.be/xjszVOfG_wo
Well said!
Sajid will be having a strong word with who ever let that doctor get access to him, this did not go to script.
What a fool! He probably tells his patient to not vaccinate. HE AND PEOPLE LIKE GIM are the reason this pandemic is still ongoing
Well get a load of this badass 😎
Savid jabtard is evil and is a war criminal
The man is a legend!!!!!!
Well said, NHS is in shortage and will lose a lot of staff and volunteers like myself!!!! .
Well done, this guy speaks for many many people and he makes a fantastic point .
What hospital is that so I know not to go there. He says changing picture due to omicron if that was really the issue he would have got the vaccine before omicron existed. He is anti vax and in my opinion they should all be gassed or forced to live on an Island together.
Gbu Dr...may Jesus protect u always from all harm and danger
Go on son!!
What an Amazing Doctor! I wish we had more Doctors like him in the world!
Yes standing up for our human rights!   This doctor is bold and right on the money! Who really believes the government has your best interest at heart?
This guys a legend   logical and not afraid to speak the truth.  We need more people like him
Clearly the nurses will be sacked if they speak up
NHS is already understaffed, if they start firing people who don’t want the vaccine what is going to happen?
thanks sky news for showing the either side of the coin. Subbed.
Why would they waste money on a dose when he clearly doesn’t need one
What a brave intelligent man. Who makes so much sense. 👏👏👏
Keep NHS  NO PP.. NO mandates freedom to chose
And that doctor was never seen again...
Shout out to Real NHS Hero  !!!
Well done... That doctor is my collegue...this nurses are not.. Scary to talk.. No mandate vaccines... Last year everyone was fine ...This year everyone sick in NHS
Its amazing how an uneducated public take his comment on mandatory vaccines and his flawed stats opinion, to confirm all sorts of conspiracies. Critical thinking skills are scarce in Britain
That’s the MEN
I know a retired Consultant Anaesthetist who would disagree. What does that prove?
I agree with this doctor wholeheartedly
But he’s coming into contact with vulnerable people - if he’s saying that there’s even a slight reduction in transmissibility it’s his moral responsibility to get boosted whenever. I think his objection to vaccines goes deeper then he lets on.
Freedom….
All Doctor's knew about the Danger of the poison Vaccine
Would he also do a lumbar puncture without washing his hands???
Well done doctor 👍
Watch them nurses when Javid asked them. They looked frightened. Then the Legend pops in. Top guy!! Seems like this is what they want. Jab people every 3 months. Wonder what next strain of the rona will be? Maybe a mix of all variants where u need 5 jabs to stay so called ,,protected"
Haha my money is with the dr in blue  he knows lot more :)
At least the vaccine reduces transmission. One of my friends who is vaccinated had covid last week and I was with them when they had it but I never caught it from them. If they weren’t vaccinated, I would have caught it from them
Sky actually posting a great insight to what we all think
The stupidity and arrogance is scary.....Dr No fxxxng way is he ever treating me
Bravo 👏🏽
Hello I also work for the NHS and am around vulnerable patients daily.   The precautions we take to help prevent COVID from spreading such as washing your hands and wearing a mask etc, is the same as taking the vaccine/booster.   Each individual is different and will react different in catching COVID. This doctor is implying that HE has antibodies that can fight against any virus and so chooses to not be vaccinated, whilst working around vulnerable patients. If he also thinks he is invincible then why is he wearing a mask?  My prayers go out to those who have passed due to COVID and to those who have suffered from a love one passing away due to it. Let us not forget the impact of COVID and what we went through during lockdown. Stay safe.
Take a bow !
NHS staff should have the Jab, everyone should.  I've had all my jabs and been around those with it and I'm safe.  Those same people in my family without the jab all caught COVID-19.
what a man.... standing up for what he sees and believes
💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
I have nothing but respect for that man!
People are so scared to talk and possibly lose their jobs.  Ridiculous
Respect 👏👏👏
A good doctor speaking out against the unlawful gov.
I agree with the personal choice and I understand this doctors opinion and that he has comparable protection at least the moment.   But what is the reason he wouldn't get vaccinated? That is more interesting...  I think it's fine to say it should be a choice , but from what he's saying he's never been vaccinated so it'd be interesting to know why not...
what a complete fuckwit  of a politician he should of been shaking that doctor's hand for speaking the truth
He should be promoted
Fair play to him for not being a sheep and saying what everyone’s thinking and not what everyone wants to hear.
I can assure the guy Fauci  is no vaccine expert and the vaccine experts that are speaking out are being censored. Dr Robert Malone prime example, inventor of the MRNA technology. Take his advice
So glad this doctor spoke up. I feel the same! I had covid and so I have the natural anti-bodies. To have no job if I don't get both vaccinations doesn't feel right.
Legend. Plain talking, to the point. Listen up!
Wonder if he's a party goer and likes affairs? The government - i believe all they say. It's got be true, if it's back up by the world admired BBC.
We take our advice from the vaccines experts. Big farma
That Doctor is a f*cking hero.
The Health Secretary's dismissive comment of "that's your view" is just appalling. It's not a view, he's just stated back to back scientific facts.
Ha ha ha more of anti-vavacine and he's the head of what?
Top doctor. Well said that man.
Respect for speaking the true 💪
Good , 15years to sanction vaccines, the world is breaking its own rules !! Wake up
I had Covid in April 2020 when it started spreading in the UK. I lost my sense of smell and taste for 10 days. I felt shattered and wanted to sleep all day. Then again, I had Covid December 2020. This time symptoms were mild. I was offered a vaccine in February 2021. I refused as I had COVID two months prior.  In 2021 November, my wife and daughter had Covid, but I didn't have this time. I don't think I will take the COVID vaccine at all. It seems my body has already developed immunity.
LMAOOOO sajid didnt know what to say
Respect and agree with this doctor, sister is a nurse who’s worked through the pandemic with no vaccine and antibodies who’s job is in jeopardy, shame on the government! NHS will suffer further so will the public
Tbh ill be 100% with it if it worked 100% did exactly what we wanted it to but currently i feel its a hit and miss with most people!
sience is fact dabate is two side thinking there corect to fine a middle ground there no middle ground in sience the worlds round we cant give way to flat earthers like the anti sience vaxed people no sience just belife opinion and no facts we cant sit down when your side has no sience
So... The Health Secretary LITERALLY agreed that building antibodies against COVID (from catching it), is as good as the vaccine. Why are they still pushing Vaccines when our immune systems can handle it and the vaccines only last 8 weeks? 😅
I hope this brave young doctor sees the support and admiration that he is getting.
good human
Fantastic reporting!!! Freedom of speech is so important
But how does this vaccine differ from other vaccines that im sure a doctor would recommend to his patients such as the HPV vaccine which has shown to decrease risk of cervical cancer in women? This is a real question. I respect his opinion and its good to hear that the vaccine does what it says it does but just won't last very long but how? I'm confused
Apparently on Christmas eve they passed some law for 500.000 5 year visas to bring trained staff in to the country.
What a legend.. completely agree, working as a teacher throughout the pandemic face-to-face, no PPE and still continue, I have not been vaccinated and I’m one of the only members of staff who hasn’t had Covid and the only member of staff that is not vaccinated and I’m fed up with the pressure. It is my human right to make a decision based on my own circumstances and risk assessment.  Bravo for speaking out.
next thing will be puppet doctors saying the opposite to him.
One of many
How irresponsible of this 'doctor' to be saying this, and now of course we know that all his reasoning was utter jibberish and false. He should be dismissed immediately.
Shame he couldn’t give an actual reason not to get it.
I'm going to say a word I never say.... AWESOME!
no vaccine !only i can say!its my choice how i want die ! no hospitals etc ,lies ,hospitals full and the same with European bus to leave ... where's that 300 billion, millions????liers..then park in garden with mates and i cant !!wtf
Very brave 👏🏼
Funny coz most people with a brain wud consider dr Robert Malone the best expert and ur not listening to him u horrid little man
There silence spoke volumes before the consultant spoke up lmao
A-hole isn’t listening . VETS DONT EVEN VACCINATE DOGS YEARLY !!!!!!!
Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo Tango Hotel Echo Victor Alpha X-ray
Well if he's asking the vaccine experts i try to think like one of those vaccine experts.  If i m a vaccine expert normaly i will work for a big company in industry and what do i need ? To make money. How do i make money ? Telling health secretary that people need more jabs. So easy :))  Il keep watching the show wish to see more and more stupid rules... i m wondering when this bubble will explode couse it s fkin close :) .... i heard that electricity will duble this year i can t wait to see it
Can't vaccinate your way to health!
Lmao sky news coming out only now with this Said David clip. I saw and experienced this fully before it was even uploaded😂😂
After my second jab I had a serious side effect for the past 7 months. Extremely extremely extremely hot. I mean mega hot, window open 24/7 fan blowing hot and sweat pouring 24/7. I wasn't like that before the jab. It stopped me doing things. Very uncomfortable. ...
I think it’s a great idea to sack every single member of the NHS who doesn’t want the jab as we did with the care home staff. That way the NHS will completely collapse just as many of the care homes are at the moment. Getting great advice from Sage aren’t we?
Very intelligent Doctor The so called health secretary said we take the best advice from the experts Who are those experts misleading the world Why are doctors and scientists who apose to the vaccine not allowed to debate this issue publicly
These medical practitioners were thrown to the wolves without any proper PPE and without vaccines when the pandemic began. These people were dangerously And continuously exposed to COVID because of this government. And now years later  they are being betrayed because they aren't vaccinated against something they've been over exposed to for years. Disgusting.
Javid asks questions to a consultant but doesnt listen to factual answers.
SJ  is SUCH a fool  and that's an example of our government folks!!!
🙂💔
Legend!
Good for him
Well said 🙌🏾
How ignorant javid is. Saying  Quite bluntly"thats your view" to a doctor who has fact is so typical of our ignorant government. Well done doctor for standing out against these morons
Sajid is an absolute tool. Good job Doctor for standing up for yourself, especially having natural immunity.
There are other views, but his is the truth
The Doctor speaks the truth.  But "we take the best advice from the people that are vaccine experts". LOL........I don't even think he's listening. Lights are on but no one home.
See how hard Javid finds it to deal with common sense, logic and what every knew prior t to the rewriting of science in March 2020
Stupid doctor. He is getting a lower immunity without taking the vaccine. Weak argument. 3 jabs are okay to provide him higher chances to not get infected. Soon he will be applying for a new job by doing that.
The truth is an offence but not a sin !💯💯✊🏾✊🏾 never give up the fight !! Keep telling the truth
Hospital shitting it’s pants n feels the need to put a suck up to the government statement out.
The Doctor refusing to take vaccination is covering his foot steps. He must be working in private hospitals charging £400/ to £500/- an hour. Health Secretary should remain firm with  such health staff.
It is quite stupid now. The government appears to be following jacks in boxes.
Agree totally with the Doctor.
Doctor death. Didn't reference any real data did he?
Natural immunity ISN'T "A VIEW" is science but who cares about science.
I'm sorry I would want to be treated by a doctor who has been vaccinated, he's now a scientist is he? Nope
So this poor lad wi get the sack coz he was honest n told the truth n went against the establishment
Health minister who knows nothing, no surprise there!! Muppet.
He speaks truth! The political money making elite just want everyone to comply to the tyranny
Get his eyes tested tho so he can drive 🤣
Sajid Javed got refuted! 😉
I stand with this man
The guy from NHS saw some hope in the nonvaxxed doctor when he said people need a jab a month but when not agreed shut him down when said we take advise from vaccine experts.
U have to be the right person, in the right time and place to say something like that. This is why they can't label him as anti vaxer!
That’s your view he says. Says the one who has no clue what he’s talking about.
Salute 💯💯💯💯
Javid is an arrogant corrupted puppet. Get rid of him and his cronies.
Well done sky for reporting this
I guess not everyone can be bought afterall.
Well done to this consultant 🙂
Health secretary says; but at some point your natural immunity will also wear off... That is an anti scientific analysis. Where is the research and proof on that? My grandmother had the Spanish flu 90 years ago; still had antibodies this day. People who had the Mexican flu 17 years ago; still have antibodies. Senator Rand Paul is holding the debat about acquiring natural immunity, with Tony Fauci. Dr. Fauci didn't gave an answer to that question, until this day.
Not sure about u guys but I’d rather take an AE drs advice rather than a politician
I heard him say that ion order to have any decent immunity you’d have to vaccinate a person every month ! Smdh
The vac don’t even work ! Smdh
A brave doctor to stand up to the system.
Do as we say or loose your work, "allowance" to travel, or eventually even shopping. GREAT FREEDOM OF CHOICE.
I’m an nhs frontline worker. The stress some of had been going through because of this. Our mental health and well-being has been effected. Hats off to this doctor!
If what the doctor says is true we may as well all stop getting vaccinated. I have had 3 jabs but will certainly think seriously about having another on that evidence.
Those infected with the original SARS 17 years ago are immune to Covid and variants.
Not the first instance of a doctor woefully misinformed, propagating misinformation. Should be called to account for this, and if deemed appropriate, disciplined for behaviour calling the profession into disrepute.
True that!! Other staff sitting like silent mice..
I don’t think he’s brave at all in fact I would refuse treatment from him. He can still get COVID and transmit it to his patients. Also he’s not qualified in the field of epidemiology and so the statistics he’s quoting don’t correlate with the facts.
Good doctor.
Totally dismisses the real doctor in the trenches opinion , the doctor made comp,etc sense to me ,the nurses seemed threatened to not tell them they don't agree with vaccines because they will lose job and job security, vaccine experts are vaccine producers ,ie vaccine sellers
Health security didn't have a come back welldone Dr ...........
What an amazing Dr the fool questioning him wants to be fired
Please listen to  DR SHIVA AYYADURAI
Good man!!!! 👏. Vaccine does nothing!
Say it louder for the people at the back
This is too complicated a subject for a 2 min sound bite.  Some of what the Dr says is right but in general virologists studying this disagree with the longer term protection vaccines offer against severe covid.  It’s still an imotive subject.  But it’s about protecting those older more vulnerable people.  Going forward and if this doesn’t go away we’ll all be in that older more vulnerable position
I do not like Sajid Javid
All I hear is the Vaccine doesn't work
Respect Respect Respect to the Dr.!
Well done Doc. It's great to hear someone speak the truth  . This Doc. Is a expert
This guys has got some balls to speak out on camera to the UK Mister of Health. I'm not gonna argue if it is or it isn't effective but the science is really just not there and there is nothing clear about it either. We need more people like him. Anonymous heroes.
No one should be forced to take the vaccine. I have not taken the vaccine and will never take it.
Had Covid twice. I'm ok. Time to crack on........
I’d listen to the dr , dr is so right ,
Javid made a complete fool of himself. How embarrassing.
Now that's a doctor 💯💯💯
Government are not in a position to say what medical treatment people must have! It is a breach of a basic human rights! Especially the vaccine is unsafe, does not protect against catching it or transmitting the virus to others. So why? Awful stuff happening! Scary and truly distopian. I got he covid from a fully vaccinated person🙈
Vaccines are pointless
Everyone said well done to him..but that's not a solution.. we want solution of this pandamic.
Oh boy
Massive amounts of money made off human pincushions... I wonder which big wigs have shares in pharmaceutical companies... Blair?
This guy is amazing well done for standing up very powerful.  I wish more people would research stuff and stand up for themselves
People have and should maintain rights to treat their own bodies how they choose without suffering prejudice towards their work. Let the NHS staff and care workers and everyone, choose for themselves without fear of penalty
The paid bureaucrat is a deepstate shill.
Witch experts is he talking about? The corrupt ones?
The vaccine policy is disgusting. People must maintain their right to have choices over their own bodies and this should not have any discriminatory affect towards their work or way of life.
I applaud this doctor, the other staff seemed very nervous.
Staff clearly not happy. Straight from the front line. Yet he will listen to vaccine experts who are likely in receipt of huge salaries and benefits from the vaccine companies!
In Italy he would be already suspended.
"we take our advice from Vaccine experts"??.....eh yea... The guys selling the vaccines 😂😂😂
Probably the first piece that has a negative connotation and we are aloud to comment 😂
Government bullies. It’s disgusting that the government line is so biased towards vaccination and just don’t want to know about what people actually want
How bad he handled that was cringe
Fantastically brave
This doctor is 100% right. God bless him for telling the truth. Vaccination will not be enough. Wake up.
"We take the very best advice that we can...from people that are vaccine experts (in the pockets of big pharma)"...ignoring what an actual practicing doctor is saying right in front of him.
Great to see this video. Does anyone have any data on the vaccine reducing transmission like this dr has said..I believe he said "about 8 weeks" for Delta. Never heard of the vaccine preventing the spread of transmission before and am keen to see data on this.
Javid exposed  good work
He is a poisonous man.
It's so easy to see the differences in us vs them...
I really hope this doctor won't be sack to give his honest and right opinion.
👏👏👏 listen to the doctor!
I don't want him treating me
Common sense prevails
He vile
He definitely said those words. I read his lips.
Well done for standing your ground👏👏👏👏
So called Health Secretary is blatantly a muppet .
The most likes sky had in a while  People seem to like truth over smelly BS
This Dr tell it as it is .... people need to stop putting these lying politicians as if their royalty.
Basically shut up your not a vaccine expert
It should be about choice and the freedom of choice and nothing else, after all its a democratic society.... isn't it??? 🤔
Why not listen to somebody who is on the front line of this madness instead of a scientist sitting behind a desk (controlled)  lying about this madness. Hidden agenda.
Good man, standing up for himself against the tyrants.
The DOCTORS and NURSES are out there on the "FRONT LINE" and they are Well Aware of what is going on and they have a lot to say if we have the time to *LISTEN* to "THEM" after all "PERSONAL" hands on *EXPERIENCE* is by "FAR" the Very Best *TEACHER*!!!
It's all against the Nuremberg code!!  These people are criminals that only have the power to scare us into compliance.  Do not comply!
For anyone reading the comments thinking there are people out there that ignorant that they disagree with the doctor. Most of them are bots...   Bots form the majority of comments on all social media platforms these days..   They perpetuate the narrative ...
I would ask him, does he think  getting vaccinated is dangerous or can cause some long term damage?
This is amazing when we respect each other opinion, decision and life... Maybe we could just let everyone alone and just get on with life...
Well done to him for being truthful, honest and ultimately for sharing some clear, vital and obvious expert knowledge, which although obvious, may not be obvious to the general public and clearly not the health secretary, which is extremely concerning.
Respect to this man!
So I assume they didn’t get the Hep B vaccine either?
Has any vaccine experts as Javid calls them come out and refuted what this doctor said?  I swear to God people in the government must have shares in Pfizer because what they are doing makes no sense.  They keep pushing these ineffective vaccines which have not been tested properly and which the drug companies have immunity over any possible problems/side effects in the future.  I am very far from an expert but I worry that in pushing these vaccines which are only partially effective and haven't been tested, we could possibly create a mutation which is far stronger and which nothing we have has any effect what so ever. Isn't that why we are told to always finish a complete course of antibiotics even if we feel fine half way through?  And I have personally seen more people who have health problems after taking the vaccine than I have of people suffering from the virus.
This Doctor is well informed in the role of vaccinations.  👏
I still haven’t had first jab and not going to either. Also already had corona for the most part of 2 weeks. I’m good 👍🏽
What happened to free will in this country now they are going to sack the very people who saved thousands of lives for wanting to have a choice to have or not to have a jab
Hear hear. To the doctor, the silent nurses and to everyone else who are getting segregated and their voices not heard.  I would like to see tests for the amounts of antibodies and T cells etc we have so we can make an informed choice about boosters , vacinations, abstinence etc  PS I was surprised at the lack of likes, its odd that I couldn't give this video a thumbs up without 'signing in'what is going on
Fair play to him
Natural immunity no good for Big Pharma profts... And 2. Who are mentioned vaccine experts and what are their ties if any with Big Pharma or financial institutions/bodies/investment funds that also benefit from mentioned Big Pharmas' profits?
Javid listens to the experts unless the experts tell him what he doesn't want to hear.
The minister was so disrespectful towards the ICU doctor 👨‍⚕️ watch this everyone the Doctor was telling everyone the scientific truth https://youtu.be/7SKDHfA82HA
What an amazing doctor!, this Sajid guy is a complete idiot and so disrespectful. He should be listening to this doctor and not being so arrogant!! He’s probably being paid off by Pyzier
These officials are idiots.
Nothing but respect for that Doctor. Glad he chose to speak truth!
The Covid/Vaccine zealots will make out they know better than this doctor and that he’d be putting pressure on our NHS if he isn’t vaccinated.
Y’all firing medical professionals who don’t trust the medication 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤔🤔
This doctor should b fired immediatly.
Absolute hero. This doctor should be knighted for his bravery. It’s astounding how MSM have rallied to make him out as some sort of quack
AMERICA WAKE UP! STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS!AGAINST MANDATES! No-one should be allowed to force another person to have a medical procedure. No-one!!! There is nothing more dangerous than allowing politicians to take care of public health, If anyone is trying to silence another, for any reason, THAT PERSON HAS SOMETHING TO HIDE & are GUILTY! STAND UP! DRAG THEM TO JUSTICE!! I want to see government officials held accountable.  Now, not later. Let's go Brandon 👍F...JB!! AGREE???
sheep
we do not wear facemasks and never ever vaccinate
Jeez, at least have the young doc talk to someone in immunology. What is he a doc in? Podiatry?
funny how the first group of medical staff did nt know what to say and just stood there looking glum.. thinking should we really say our opinion or follow the narrative lmao
If the minister was getting so called expert information. Then he would know Doctor is rite. Only Dr with Quaulifaction is Dr Malone .who actually invented the main part of ingredients in vax. But he gets taken off Twitter for false information. So if your not listening to him. All health men and women so called experts no nada..and still got masks lmao experts.
Look at how many likes this gets. Versus the regular scaremongering biased non-news that sky typically broadcasts. Says it all. Dr Chad. Javid is a weasel
I was the only one who chose not to get vaccinated and lost my job because of that (a care sector). It is refreshing to see someone standing their ground for what they believe in. Huge respect !!!!
Vaccine experts.......
That dig about the experts      This guy deals with sick patients day in day out, hes not some dumb epidemiologist .  The doctor is completely right, natural immunity is the best, the vaccines have to be boosted every month to match up to natural immunity
Question is why are we being shown this? People trust doctors more than politicians. That did not look good - thought about this a little more. He's a doctor not a virologist. Maybe I shouldn't hold his opinion with such weight ✌️
From people like Robert Malone? A vaccine expert as he put it...
Facts facts facts it's not a view!
Remember Folks....mandatory is......... ONLY REQUEST............NOTHING MORE !!!!!!!!!!!
The silence from the 5 ladies says it all.
“Take advice from vaccine experts”  - says the ex banker 🤷🏻‍♀️
I think at least there should be something compared to nothing eventhough it wont protect ppl for so long. What a crappy head doctor
Finally someone speaks out from the medical field! What's the need of having covod passportt if this vacine dose not give a permanent protection?!?!
Thanks doctor for speaking out! So agree with him
He just tried to dismiss the doctor by mentioning vaccine experts! 🙄
He is right, no vaccine !
Hahaha Didn’t get the answer he was hoping “anyone else” hahahah
Well done to this doctor, this reminded me of school. He asked the first group, all whispers and giggles and the guy at the back of the class... I got sutten to say...
I do not believe for one minute that 90% of the staff have had the jab. This is a ploy to get the 10% to go get jabbed.
Once we were clapping the NHS staff,  now the Tories want to sack them- how the worm turns
If doctors and nurses won't comply to the coercion, they will surrender and stop this nonsense, otherwise NHS will collapse.
Massive respect to the Dr here speaking some absolute gold. And the health Secretary wanted no part of them facts.
I fully support that doctor
I got jabbed but this is it. Im not going for anymore of it in the future.
Government doesn’t think natural immunity is real just like the Christmas Downing Street party 🎉
He is absolutely right, i totaly agree with this brave doctor, he does not play like a sheep, but like a lion.
There own ppl saying they ain’t enough evidence regarding the jab does what the leaflet says 😂
This Doc said it with chest.. 🔥🔥🔥
Glad to hear an honest answer from this Doctor who clearly knows what he is talking about. Sajid is a tyrant.
Sack him putting folk at risk
Take the Drs advice. Hahaha he didn't know what to do there haha
"From people that are vaccine experts........ that agree with our agenda"
looool sajid davis is clueless . sounds so ignorant compared to the doctor loooool
But we have a Procent that State and Politicans want%%%%%%%%
Kings Collage Hospital didn’t like what the Dr had to say and neither did the health secretary. He spoke the truth, if he gets sacked I would happily have him as my private Dr . I will never again trust the government or NHS
This Dr has convinced me that I shouldn’t have had my jabs.
As I said Poison
I respect this Doctor , I like how calm he is   and has carefully collected his facts Poor nurses afraid to losing their jobs will be vaccinated against their will Appreciate this Dr for standing up
That’s your views but it’s facts
Lol the guy is speaking to a doctor and basically decline's his opinion and says were only taking advise from vaccine experts when the doctor jus said the problem with the vaccine this is a big scam
I've made my mind up and now don't like Sajid.  Total ignorance.  Why ask a question and then dismiss the replies?  If this was a PR stunt he failed miserably at looking decent and honourable.
"Vaccine experts" ...Robert Malone apparently no longer qualifies since going against the narrative
Nearly 90%, meaning 26.5%
Javed rejecting doctors points. By saying we'll take advice from the vaccine experts.. To stop him looking silly
Wow! Well done to that Dr for sharing his honest views! Respect 💖
That Consultant is correct but heck no, let's just ignore the current science and keep blasting away with a shotgun because that is def the easiest way out. What folly. My partner is also another one of those there who disagrees with the mandate for similar reasons but is def not against vaccinations. I can hardly wait for the amount of spin doctoring that will be required to cover up this mess when the politicians see that this mandate will not produce the effects that they are pushing so hard and probably at the cost of more lives because there will be fewer Doctors and Nurses around. This is against human rights from a country which boast constantly how their human rights are so good. What hypocrisy!
Facts.
Well done to this doctor for standing his ground and exposing the lie behind this scamdemic
Vax experts = Pfizer.. We get it.
Hang on, the vaccine only reduces transmission for about 8 weeks?! Why is this the first time I’ve heard about this?
Well said, doctor! 👏
The only expert advise your getting is your pocket getting filled with corrupt money.
Amazing doctor That has the guts to talk to truth , Javid looks shook
God Savid is an absolute bellend, is clearly losing the argument against someone not even “ qualified “ to talk about politics. It’s embarrassing don’t actually have a solid argument for not taking the vaccine, they just say it’s to help others and yourself yet we have seen no evidence of that at all. I had 2 vaccines and so I’m not anti vax, but the government are a joke and clearly have the wrong advisors
That end statement is just there because of the fear backlash in this sick fearful society
I am double Vaccinated U.S. Oregon got my last shot 4 months ago ..Both Moderna..today I got tested positive for Covid  I am sick but know I will not end up in ER .. we were told not to get a booster until 6 months but now I think its 5 months ..
I’m proud of him for standing up for his personal views on the vaccine, and how much pressure he must of felt in that situation, he’s inspiring!
Bäm
I m staying masked all the time...is that a guarantee that I will not get the virus?
What an absolute fool.  A medic with that mentality is a danger to us all
The problem with a video like this is that people listen because he's a doctor but very few people watching this video will know if the things he's said are facts or made up. He said he had 1 collegue in the same boat. In a whole hospital. So most doctors at the hostpital are vaccinated and agree with vaccination but him and 1 collegue don't. He's a red herring.
Really and truly, it isn't the doctors area to decide upon such thing. I'm sure there are scientists who would disagree but Mr Javed was not equipped well enough
Fair play for speaking his mind about wat he thinks. But am not gonna agree with u all on here. I would not like to be treated by unvaccinated doctor or nurses. Might as well have micky mouse there trearing people! Yea it's a choice but still huge risk in hospitals. UK still living in Disneyland it seems. I bet people still get on packed buses with windows shut not even bothering to wear a mask & in shopping centres. Only the UK for u that. In Asia & most European everyone wears mask even in street to protect yourself and others.
I'm glad someone said something.
It is mandatory.  So inconsistent.  Diabolical
It's not Smallpox...
Say no more
Health Secretary's a joke, working for the nhs has only got harder. Patient flow through the hospitals has quadrupled and staff are already dropping like flys
#novaxforme
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I agree with Doctor ..Mr Javaid has Not studied medical. No they Don't and will Not take any Advice...
So the mp can question a doctor the mp acting like he has qualifications of doctor
So 90%  unvaccinated in icu he happy to pass it around hmm yes good ethical point I'm young I survived it fine but fook vulnerable people and the elderly I will pass it around.
Well done to that medical professional, with first-hand experience on the front line from the start and not sat in a government office, who took the courage to speak some common sense and challenge the nonsense approach of doing boosters every few months.   If the public are to be "advised" (through fear and coercion) to take certain medicine on a regular basis, then perhaps the public could be entitled to see the pharma contracts and financial figures that sit behind all this – especially since the tax payer is probably paying for this (in multiple ways).
Well done doc
Im surprised the main stream media were even allowed to broadcast this! Nice to see some sanity break through, hope the tyrannical government takes its decision back and this good brave man can keep his job.
Everyone should have the right to decide if they want the vaccine or not.
That doctor is standing in the wrong place. He should standing where The Health Secretary is
Just fire him.
Politicians are so damn ignorant... Why are people voting for them seriously?
Wow I'm actually giving sky news a thumbs up!
Way to go Doc!!  We need to hear the other side of the story as it has been censored for so long.  If something is that censored, what is being hidden?
Well done sir for speaking up!
That took a lot of balls, I've got nothing but respect for him!
Bless this doctor!!!
These medical bureaucrats think that if they use the word "experts" that somehow cancels all data to the contrary. The data stopped supporting the "science" and "experts" over two years ago.
I totally agree with the Dr who does not want the vaccine and it should never be mandatory forcing people to be vaccinated and if not they loose their jobs, that is so wrong!!!!!
Your immune system is still producing antibodies after thirteen months.
If this doctor loses his job over this it would be disgusting after he's been looking after people with covid from the very beginning risking he's own life it's like leaving our war veteran's on the street's why has this country lost all it's sense and morals this man risked his life to save others wake up Britain before it's to late
Lmao doc was right, said just back handed him vaccine experts,  my arse, I'd rather have thus doctor do  rain surgery on me than listen too vaccine experts who are corporate run, rather insulting how said dismissed the doctors comments, not a debate just dictatorship.
SALUTE...
The fact that the Dr produced concrete and science based arguments while the Health Secretary could repeat nothing other than “we refer to the experts” says it all!
A Consultant Anaesthetist, who has worked   intensive Care, all through Covid *IS* an expert. It’s obvious the nurses didn’t want to say, they all looked so uncomfortable. Bravo to the Consultant, 👏🏼 he made much more sense than months of us being told to get jabbed with this and that, then a booster which has made so many unwell, only for them to go on and catch Covid anyway. 🤥
What’s the chance he lost his job for doing this - btw kudos to this guy as a young man his behaviour and conduct is admirable
JUST SAY NO.
As much as I respect this guy for standing up for what he believes in and I definitely do. All his "facts" start with "probably" "I probably have the equivalent antibodies as the vaccinated" The science isn't strong on both sides of the arguement and we are expected to believe what we are told by those who can't even follow the very rules they set out for everyone to follow. I have had the vax plus booster, purely because if there is a chance I can help protect my family I will, even if it doesn't work I can say I atleast tried. I definitely don't think the vax should ever be mandatory though
Best advice from vaccine experts? What Javid doesn’t mention is that these vaccine experts are working for the multi million pharmaceutical companies who want people to buy the vaccine. Javid is a fraud
what kind of vaccine expert advise is he getting.Stop forcing people, let them make their choices with their bodies
The Doctor makes perfect sense...Uncle Fester is a balloon
How long before this gets taken down
Bet this video will be deleted very soon
This politician is still fighting him at the end saying we take advice from the experts..WTF. Well done to Doctor and nurses (silence..)
We need truth, thanks for the truth Doctor, someone had to stand up and speak soon.
Next they'll be making abortion decisions for the staff too.
Every POS pushing this agenda to make the elite more rich will soon be answering to angry mobs, and i hope they get torn apart by them
So, that is what a real man sounds like. Lord bless him.
They must lick the bold mans head !
Finally the world is waking up to the retardation
Integrity and courage to challenge the Emperor's new clothes, well done him! Give just how crazy this world has become, it's wonderful to see such bravery in action.
Tu byłem. Tony Halik 2022. Those who got vaccinated now have a damaged immune system.
Much respect for this doctor who is saying the truth finally
-"We were only doing our job!" Doctors and nurses arround the world.
Absolute hero, finally something in the media. Well done Doctor!! Everyone needs to speak out against this madness
Because I go to a finance politician instead of a doctor for medical advice!!! Hmmm let ask a plumber to check the wiring of the electrics in my house.
I cannot believe how gullible people are! Bravo to the Dr. for speaking up!
The protection offered by the booster isn't permanent either. I think it's good to be vaccinated, but it should be left to the people to decide. We can't force it.
The epitome of speaking truth to power, well done Dr
Way to go doc he had nothing
The side effects of frequent vaccination will outweight hypothetical benefits leaving vaccinated people with damaged immune response. Supreme Court must have taken a very long nap when all this nonsense is administered without any clarity involved.
Well done that doctor and it just shows how arrogant Javid is that he dismisses the 'doctor's' concerns
I've had c-vid once and unvaccinated. Everyone I know who has been vaccinated has caught c-vid, some twice... Go figure... We are being constantly lie to by our government. The truth will fully come out, and just like we call Tony Blair a war criminal, Boris and his goons will be called c-vid criminals and a stain of history.
👏 BRAVO Dr.!!! Refreshing 2 C TESTICULAR FORTITUDE DEMONSTRATED!!!🎆🗽🎆
Javid (who is not medically-trained) is all blah blah blah: not weighing anything up, just sticking to policy - for show, not reality.
Just say NO TO THE VACCINE
The criminal said at the end: “...we take advice from vaccine experts.” This should be: “...we take advice from people that have special interest in the pharmaceutical industry, and supporting our big leader’s ‘great reset agenda’. Heil Schab!” 🙋🏻‍♂️🪳🪳🪳🪳🪳🙋🏻‍♂️
His going back to dom, then saying step up the psy ops the science isnt enough, march 2022 is key
What an asshole "vaccine experts" -- as if the Dr doesn't know what he's talking about...
The Dr is absolutely right. Maybe we should start listening to actual MD's and nurses instead of politicians and pharma reps...
Politicians are just pure cringe.
I won't jump on one side or the other but I'd really like to see an extended discussion/debate to see the points of both sides
So all the women laughed when asked the question an the brave doctor answered i dont want it its a waste of time....meanwhile the guy in the white shirt thats showing  javid around the hospital tries to silence his colleague thats speaking out ....say no to mandatory say no to covid passports
By the way they don’t all have to be vaccinated by 1st April they have to have their first vaccine by 3rd February otherwise they are out . So we will know how many are going to be forced to leave by 4th February. Is the government mad these are people who have risked their lives  for the old and infirm for two years , what about their lives , every drug has risks stop pretending it doesn’t and natural immunity will always be the best when it comes to covid 19 , look at the evidence from SARS 1 . It’s time the government and saga apologise !!!!! Ignoramuses
💯🤲🏻 GOD PROTECT US ALL.WE WILL ALL BE PROTECTED WITHOUT A JAB
At last someone with common sense
there idiots.in goverment we dont need these people. lets fire all off them take there pension there freedom evrything they took from us. Neurenberg 2.0. They only take.the advice thats suits there narrative otherwise the whole facade will collapse.
Definitely get vaccinated, but not too much and definitely do not force it upon people!
Surprise, surprise! There are a few doctors that haven't been corrupted yet.
Well done man
Ah the doctor is just one of those conspiracy theorist nut jobs who has no idea what he's on about.......NOT!!
It's time someone starts to tell us the truth,we'll done .
Stick that in ya pipe n smoke it Mr Health Minister
The consultant made the health secretary look like a complete idiot - well done - a super smart guy who still has common sense and logic , wake up people the health secretary , spending tax payers money , controlling your lives basically admired the government is stupid and he knows it’s been a stupid call , how embarrassing!!!
Their needs to be more men like this. We have a voice, it needs to be heard !
So much respect for this doctor! 👏👏👏👏
So much respect for this nurse  The vaccine experts as he said they are corrupted by big pharma to Push for this experiment that is clearly not working against covid... If those experts where ligit they won't suggest vaccination during a pandemic that obviously creates variant. But because nowadays money count more than everything as we are under w satanic upper government around the world .. With magistrate court proves if interested please read the book  "The beast" by Carlo Palermo an Italian magistrate That shows court evidence about this  People This is a spiritual war
Thats not his view politician. He's a Doctor, he's an expert unlike the politician so what he had is an expert opinion which means his opinion is like given evidence unlike non expert opinion or view. Although a health Secretary is advised and informed he can't unless schooled understand fully. This is our problem, those without a right to perspective claiming it, mainly managers and politicians.
Sounds like someone needs some new “vaccine experts”
Well done Doctor for putting your valid and reasonable point of view across. Unfortunately the politician had no answer and no idea of the damage he is doing. Our fantastic NHS workers do not deserve this. United we stand, and on 01/04/2022 divided we will fall.
Those with natural immunity simply do not need to be vaccinated.
People who aren't in the risk group shouldn't be forced to tk a vax period. but old people should tk a vax no matter wht thy think, cuz vax will sure help them down the road.
Follow the money
They aren't listening to anyones advice they are listening to bribes, they need to be exposed for the criminals they are. This man who is supposed to represent the people is failing and was shown here to be a complete moron. We need new government who will not force this vaccine on people. It should be ones own individual choice.
Well said that doctor!! To a pathetic, bought politician looking for a photo opportunity. Whilst on a campaign to lead us into totalitarianism.
Funny how msm allow this on youtube and I gues else where where the mere sniff of anything or anyone saying anything contra to the govs narrative has been censored. I found it interesting that when the doc was told normal unvaccinated immunity would "wane" he had no response. Dont be suckered people.
Each vaccinated person I talk to here in my city says they only got vaccinated because politicians have mandated services for the vaccinated not because they felt any  threat from covid and nobody wanted the vaccine in First place. For once now, science no longer matter. What matters is politics 🤔🤔🤔🤔
If anything, the Doctor was being extremely reserved. The evidence is clear, people with antibodies are up to 16x better off than those who are simply vaccinated. And people with antibodies, myself included, are far more likely to have adverse effects to the vaccine, so says the CDC data and figures from Israel. If it perfectly sensible to test for antibodies and adjust policy, but they won’t because they’re afraid it’ll lead to vaccine hesitancy.
What are the Health Secretary's qualifications to challenge the doctor's position on vaccine?
Good for him
Vaccine "experts" and who might they be? 😂
Awww thanks Dr. Teach him! Hope he learns
It's totally absurd this doctor must defend his personal choice about his own body and health. Against a gov bureaucrat. Government has no power over your body. Period.
46k likes wow.
It's like fkn Darwinism. All the ones with a brain will go... can't wait to see what the NHS is left with after this. 😭
Not all heroes wear capes
Dodgy jav was out of his depth.  When faced with someone who understands far more than he ever could he reverted to generalities.  A completely unsmart way to handle this
Is this April’s fools day?
Doctor speaking facts
That dude got owned and could only say "we take best advice from vaccine experts" what a cop out 🙄😆
Nurses too scared to comment and how about the look from the bloke in the white shirt staring down at the doctor.  This is Australia people. We need to push back
He should have said, we will listen to the "vaccine experts" who support our agenda and silence those (like Dr Malone) who don't.
They are scared to speak up
I am so proud of this Doctor for standing up for freedom of speech.  And real science. We all need to find our courage in these difficult times. Praying for him.
The Doctor made perfect sense.
I also believe that covid is here to stay. Like flu. Highly mutable. Cant get rid of it.
Nice video ...
They gonna fire him
Well Done. Somebody with commonsense is still in this world
We have a cross section of doctors.  Most doctors are good citizens but we have a number of crackpot doctors in jail right now for everything from insurance fraud to rape.
It’s people like him infecting patients
Well done for speaking out more need to
May YAHWEH keep him and protect him from all evil.
Dude has valid points.
Those women nurse looked absolutely terrified as though their voices and say have been taken away from them. Well done to the male nurse for standing up and giving it straight. Having the jab should always be a choice and not a mandate.
They shouldn’t force people to get the vaccine…
The fact my GP text me 5 times 5! just last week to try & accost me into getting my first jab and 2 boosters tells me all I need to even though they haven't contacted me for a year says all it needs to.quotas. I hate that Sajid guy Enoch Powell was right innit.
He spot on 👌
A salute to that medical professional who spoke up. If public has to trust medical professionals they have to work in the best interest of people.
That doctor is brave for standing up but I can't help but fear for his safety.
I can’t believe this dumb interviewer is arguing with the doctor basically about how he Has the antibodies and doesn’t need a vaccine I mean I’ve caught Coverd and I’m not getting a booster because the doctor told me that that’s basically a booster already so corrupt the media
I'm surprised they left this up
I bet the health secretary is prob wishing he never asked him haha
As soon as the politican left, he would have ordered that the doctor be suspended. "We take advice from real experts!!!", what a pr!@k!
They wouldnt be getting a booster monthly
"Your view", politicians are totally against the science, because it destroys their agenda.
Stay strong people we strong together we are powerful don’t comply
Wow, total Chad move
He asks for an opinion he gets an educated answer from a doctor who is on the frontline and then has the audacity to say "we get advice from experts", what a patronising waste of space.
Using this vaccine to control spread of the virus is like trying to use a spoon to chop down a tree.
Bruh, I thought that was doctor Mike in the thumbnail
If the vaccine is free, then whats the issue of even taking it every month? Is there a speculation that vaccine might have adverse effect in the long term?
This is Britain’s Health Secretary this is disgusting 🤮 Brave doctor
"Vaccine experts" works for the company. Asking for their advice is a bit...
The way he was patronising and trying to discredit the doctor,  at the end, was revolting.
Surprising to see that on sky news who have no balls for a long time now and obviously the doctor is right and is going to lose his job due to the agenda being priority and not health
Bravo young man 😊 we need people to stand up for truth and uncover the stupidity of so called experts
This doctor a Hero with balls 🦸‍♂️💪🏻 🙏🏻
The doctor is correct! And the nurses well…….it says it all.
I sure hope he doesn't get fired!?? And I applaud his bravery! 👋  We literally have nothing left to lose, they're trying to take everything away!! We must stand up and speak our truth!!🙏🌎
What the government's are doing around the world are forced medical body tests which are not being done by the person themselves but are being forced from volunteers who are not medical staff and sticking these tests in the noses or mouths of every person. Against the Nuremberg Codes and every human right we possess.  It's an illegal forced attack on the people through medicinal PROPAGANDA
Absolutely disgusting
Agreed Dr. Natural immunity is stronger than the jab
Taki him advice
The bald suit dummy has no clue what he's doing
My guy I give him a pat on the back!!
AWESOME DOCTOR!!  Nurses should speak up instead of look at each other hoping someone says how they feel. They are "Vaccine experts" they are "Prolonging for mass benefit" experts. IMO
Goodluck Doc
More of this please. No vaccine mandates for everyman And healthcare workers. Listen. Stop isolation and asymptomatic testing.
The health secretary is a joke.
WOW!!  I can't see any replys ????? is it just me?
They can take their vaccines and shove em up theirs. I would rather die than take it
He put all FACTS in that man’s hands but he was obviously too weak to carry them…
Salute to this gentleman 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 well said
I feel sorry for Sajid. He can't win. I'm not a Tory.
I admire this doctor. What a brilliant man. The health secretary doesn't know jack and knows that this plandemic will eventually come to an end.   It's like me going to tell my mechanic that we follow the science on cars. What do I know? It's like me going to tell Sports Direct that we follow the science on gym trainers. What do I know? The Health Secrtary is not a doctor. He should listen to the people that were treating patients, even before he took the role of the Health Secretary. Eventually, this man will have another role in parliament because he will not be gealth secretary for too long.
I’m double vaccinated, and don’t have a problem with it; but I admire how brave that doctor is. I hope he didn’t get in trouble at work after this video.
What a scam.
Health minister resign
“The science isn’t strong enough”, said Dr. Steve James. He added that since the vaccine begins to wane in two months, monthly boosters would be required .
Javid following the scrip fills me with confidence 🤔🤪
I'm fully vaccinated, athletic and have no medical issues. Have been in bed for couples days with covid, I don't know where the best advise is coming from but it didn't work for me.
Sick up for your rights and don’t be sheep 🐑 or a guinea pig 😉
Legend 👏😎👍👍👍👍
The narrative is falling apart.  Well done to that Doctor
Imagine getting 4 vac in 1 year and still getting it. It's happening lol. Effective af
Hope the doctor is not fired for speaking honestly and having a genuine concern...
Health secretary should be in jail
Health Secretary is a tool for the elitists not even a health professional, I mean really what has the government come too!  People with banking credentials put in charge of health ? Now that’s ridiculous...
This is ignorance, it’s to reduce hospitalization and pressure on the health care , Covid-19 vaccination has proven to reduce adverse events. He talks about antigens after contracting Covid-19, what about those with underlying sickness and the aged. It’s just a selfish idea and should not be allowed.
A new Bolsonaro?😳
This Doctor will have many patients coming his way.
Love this guy even though I can't feel love.
“We take the best advice we can…” from Pfizer and Moderna executives who are selling the vaccine!
He has a point though. He’s been infected so he has antibodies. The same antibodies a vaccinated person would have.
There are no vaccine experts to a test trial. Dr Malone who is and was a key member in creating mRNA vaccine has not only been censored on most social platforms has said clearly that mRNA is not fit for purpose.
In Other Words.... In your Face
“Vaccine experts” = Pfizer sales reps
DO NOT GET THE VACCINE!!
Why majority of the people who got covid are fully vaccinated?  If they don't know the longterm efficacy of the vaccine, how much more the long term adverse side effects?
First they were hero’s… Now they are villains…
Did I fall into a Conservative shithole
Random booster shot seems very random
What a brave man he is !
Finally, some COMMON SENSE !!!🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
The Dr. is making mincemeat out of him, in the most diplomatic way, with scientific facts.
To me it is not necessary to mandate medical staff to get the covid shot because they have the PPE to wear to protect themselves. But the dr made a point and this is why we r getting alot of breakthrough cases. The covid virus is mutating like lightning too. If flu shots r annual then covid being much worse...how many times for the yr we have to get that shot??
😍😍😍😍
Brave man
This doctor is a real hero, he had the courage to speak up against madness
Fair play to this Doctor. The nurses are more than likely afraid to speak up for fear of being sacked on the spot as soon as the cameras are turned off. Maybe this brave doctor will get kicked out for speaking out like this. In fact, I know he will. At least its been spoken and it can't be taken back. The truth always finds a way. Do not take the jab, stay strong. Just say no!
I'm a radiographer in a hospital, the owner told me to get vaxxed, I said I'd rather resign and now they stopped insisting or I'll just go home,  radiographers are very few, that's why they have to hold on to me for the moment
Yeah they got it because how many years of school and who do they have to support? To many lies around this vaccine
Common sense and reality vs numbers on a paper 🤔
100% staged. No way would this have reached the public unless they wanted it to. It’s part of the new phase to change the narrative.
Tyranny.   Bullied by MPs who are on a free ride
Vaccine experts are big pharma where share holders profit come first
The Dr doesn’t want to have a heart attack.  Imagine training all your life to have your profession and life taken away because of profit hungry, no liability pharmaceutical companies with criminal records.
He didn't like that the doctor spoke his mind and was willing to stand up.
Obey
hw bacyly is teli him "fuxx off we will do what ever we want your sience does not matter"
Brilliant one Doc 👏
I got the vaccine and than got a blood clot, I’m struggling. I’m 30 and I’m a healthy bmi. (100lbs) I work out and always eat pretty healthy with zero health problems. I can’t even get into a specialist office for months. I’m in pain. I went to the emergency room when my leg was 2in bigger than my other and they saw the clot. I won’t be getting a booster or any vaccine ever. I was mandated at my job to get it but since I had it my life turned upside down
Respect to him
Isaiah 13:14 [14]And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.
He should be fired and lose his licence. Disgusting behaviour.
Free willy
Dude in the long sleeve it being one sided and not even listing just thinks his way thats one sided. be everyone there should have a say for them self. RESPECT  to the one speaking up for others!
There is no vaccination for covid-check out numerous publictions regarding this...
By vaccine experts he means the ceo's of pfizer and astra zenica
Fire him.
Funny how a politician can stand in front of a front line health worker and tell them they get the best information available from a corporation who makes vaccines.. I'm sure Dr's know more than executives and directors..
That is a hero!
This stupid doctors personal and selfish choice don’t make a difference for what’s best for a population
He should have asked what they think of politicians on 10x their wages paying advisers to think for them with their income tax on a subject they've been in the front line of for two years.     Vaccination was about a crucial period of time during a pandemic, doesn't take an expert to know that, makes as little as no difference outside of that period of time but _because_ the advice is paid for it'll keep coming ad-infinitum until they can think for themselves and stop wasting peoples time trying to do a days work that got us all through this, not that he'd notice,   'protect the NHS, sack 10% of them' ?  I agree with the Nurses first and second answer and also Doctors protecting them from stupid questions in rolled up Tony Bair wannabe sleeves, takes an idiot to know one, sorry, Sir Idiot.
Good doctor. It is his body, he is a medical doctor and he has earned the right to be respected.  He was good enough to show up to work all during the pandemic when there was not vaccine.
Im not sure how this anaesthetist figures the vaccine efficacy is so short lived while the unvaccinated patients still vastly outnumber the vaccinated patients in hospitals
In my world, when a vip comes around, we minions are supposed to stay mute.
Well said doc
Can we even call it a vaccine if it doesn't provide immunity the only person speaking freely is the doc and the nurses are just scared to speak
Smart doctor!!!
Watch gravitas exposing big pharma
YES! Well done that man 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
We will listen to experts( dismissing the doctor’s 6 years at university) as long as they are the right kind of experts and say what we want to hear
I always said I will NEVER get the vaccine.
That is how a person speaks who has already decided he won't listen. There is no debate, no science.
Although what he is saying is completely credible I still believe a jab is better than none and I think it might be a little irresponsible for someone In his position to send a message against vaccination as he will obviously have quite a lot of influence. I do understand the point but I think people working in a medical field should perhaps expect to get regular vaccines.
Well done Steve.
So called vaccine experts where the covid vaccinations are the only vaccinations in history needing a booster every day
Naturally acquired immunity surely has to be better than a quick 'fix' concoction. They tweek the annual flu shot to fight the prevailing strain, yet these vaccines were developed to 'deal with' the first variant, it's no wonder they aren't working anymore... If they ever really did.
Tell it like it is, the vaccinated is getting the unvaccinated "SICK". They are taking there varient all over the world. (One has to be vaccinated to travel).
Thank u Doctor!  I love your decision and explanation.
From the people who are vaccine experts/ Big pharma.😎
Respect to this Doctor. He told this uncomfortable politician the facts
Truth versus agenda. If one is suppressed…..
Bs naturally immunity prob doesn’t wear off i have friends who had it and want it again so they get their immunity status again without jab and they go To people with Covid and they can’t get it!! They’re trying to get it lol and can’t!!! Let that sink in
Respect to this doctor👏👏❤️
That Dr is a legend. This video will go down in history and he is the star.
1:58 - what an undermining thing to say. Typical politician rat.
MP javid is a prik
I dont get why people are saying well done it was doctors and nurses that refused family members into hospitals when there loved ones were dying for fear of spreading it but they not vaccinated themselves how is this different from government telling us all to stay away from each other while having a party imagine being someone who didnt get to say goodbye to the loved one and then finding out that he was in the care of someone unvaccinated they all as bad as each other and I have had both jabs but refuse  the booster jabs
Bravo for the WISE and brave Doctor. 💜
I wonder if the government allows equally qualified experts in that field to question their "experts" on their recommendations...
Well said doctor 👏👏👏👏
The best , on national TV a doctor confronting the stupid and corrupt minister with the true !!!.. Amazing...
Ends with “Well we take the best advice” He’s either patronising the doctor or he has no people skills, like most private school career politicians actually
Looking at this from a long term stand point he has a good point but also a bad one if the more people are vaccinated the better the population is at fighting the virus before it mutates and becomes 10 times more deadly if 10,000 people get infected then the possibility of the virus mutating is 10,000 times worse but if only 1,000 get infected it is 9,000 times less likely to mutate. If his argument is we need boosters every 2 month then so be it the alternative is the virus mutating and killing us all off it's not a strong argument really is it
Good for the Doctor!!! SHAME his colleagues didn't back him up.
I agree with that doctor it's ridiculous how the Gov are trying to force people to have the vaccines the NHS staff are under a lot of pressure as it is and now going to lose their jobs!.
They say nearly 90% of their staff is vaccinated but according to this video 100% of their staff disagree with the mandates which leaves only 2 scenarios being no where near 90% is vaccinated or even if they are health care workers do not stand by this tyrannical government 🤔
Hahaha vaccine expert at the end Google how long other vaccinations have taken to create ?? YEARS NOT 11 fkin months man
Well said 👏 👌 👍
That’s his expert view.
Their "experts" are Satan's minions.  Never trust them. Experts have an agenda.
Brave doctor. The CDC asked all medical staff not to speak negatively about vaccines. I've personally seen letters sent to medical professionals in Canada. I wish governments would stop being sheep and wake up.
The doctor has a mask on
“we listen to the absolute experts” 😳 fair play to the doctor for not remaining silent on his views
Looks staged
I support this Doctor! He's so brave to speak on behalf of so many people who feel the same way!
Hero legend expert
What a moron our minister is  Vaccine experts or e doctor I would listen to this doctor for before the drug companies  Our respects go the brave doctor
I take my hat off for the doctor, at least he’s got a brain that can critique, the rest there are brain-dead.
Well done to that man, massive respect to him.
javid shaking
Respect to this doctor! Perfectly said 👏🏼
I bet Javid wished he hadn't asked that question!!. It will be a disgrace if qualified medical staff lose their jobs due to these mandates that are not based on scientific evidence. I hope that those that find themselves out of work challenge it in court - the data is not there to justify the mandate (it isn't even there to justify licensing any of these products).
Have already done so.... for now
Mark of the BEAST weigh That up with your creator
Iam afraid for that docs job. They will let him go.
I had the vaccine booster and now my right has terrible arthritis.
LOVE THIS! Well done for speaking up to this Dr. SJ’s lame response really shows that they have just rehearsed a couple of sentences and are not even knowledgable enough to hold a basic conversation with involves a challenge to their corrupt approach to vaccination. It’s all MONEY MONEY MONEY people wake up! They really do not care about your well being or if they do it is at the bottom of their priority list.
Dont care about the science...no means no...war on the unvaccinated.....continues
Ay, whose the thick guy in the white shirt who doesn't have a basic grasp of the real situation. Nah, I actually know who he is, but he's still thick. Shares in big pharma pay good dividends to political friends.
Fair play to this Doctor finally people are starting to open their eyes and stand up against the bullying and blackmailing
This doctor is a hero...
No excuses at all for not getting the jab especially from members of the NHS. Up to 80% of all cases in hospital over the past 2 months according to medical reports are unvaccinated and the NHS are complaining about the strain it’s putting on them. How does that work?
Aleluja..and this came from doctor who works in hospital...WE need more like him..who not AFRAID to speak loud..to ANYBODY...
Nurses remain silent, afraid of being ostracized, shunned and losing everything. Cult members do the exact same thing.
Good on the bloke. Media repeating things doesn't make it true. Science is being hijacked at the moment
Well done doctor we support un Vax
Does the heath secretary have any medical qualifications?
Im surprised this hasn't been censored yet. Well he didn't see that coming. Like a deer in the headlights🤣 Great respect to the Doctor for giving his opinion. Shame it was pretty much instantly dismissed. Would have been nice for his colleagues to give him a bit of moral support. It was quite obvious that their lack of reaction to the original question was because they had similar opinions. Nice to see the government listen to the opinion of the professionals that actually work in the NHS🤦‍♂️
That goon said they’re going to pay attention to vaccine experts. If they were “vaccine experts” it would give more than max 8 weeks protection. Doc said every month booster necessary. Yet tetanus  is booster after 10 YEARS and every ten after. But how many even take booster? This doctor is rarity because most want their Pfizer shares and to keep their money rolling in forget what’s good for ethics and patient health. This guy is a doctor who is speaking facts not finances. That and those types should be your EXPERT. Meanwhile back at the Amish and Mennonite ranch, they are healthy and no masks, no restrictions and in two weeks they were done and all are healthy. Deaths? None. I can’t stand corrupt criminals in public view arrogantly disregarding someone who went to med school and knows the facts. I hope this doctor is rewarded richly via underground patients who also refuse.
From the "vaccine experts" that earn £6000 per week .Might be even £6000 per day.,as consultants.They dont want the "pandemic to end.
Fantastic. Kudos to this doctor for putting it straight and shutting Mr.Out of his depth right up. Top marks
Funny how it goes! I am not vaccinated just acquired Positive in Covid still in quarantine but in all honesty I dont have any symptoms or whatsoever I dont have headaches, no sourthrought , no cough 😷 nothing. I have a few friends got vaccinated and boosted yet they have body pains, coughing and sneezing all the time body aches and etc . How ironic is that ?
Javid takes his advice from the back office trans people who were elevated to heads of committees under the Johnson Cabal via work experience at gates funded universities.
I knew something was not right when they said BOOOSTER. The DR is even saying we have to get booster every month which I think we can’t do it. Did u guys hear from China? Are they giving their people vaccine and booster???
I see the quality of doctor employed by the NHS has slipped somewhat. Doesn’t know how many weeks are in a month. He’s an idiot. If his antibodies have worn off, why not get it? Or is he saying it’s not safe. In which case he’s an idiot.
Well said mate 👏 👍
Hilarious how this joke of a "health" minister tells an actual doctor, "that is your view"! The nerve of that                 (....fill in the blank with the many suited adjectives).  So glad we have corrupt governments to force us .....meant to "guide us"....on what is best for our health, those saints.
government should not allow people to lose their jobs because they choose to not have the vaccine. Well done - We need more doctors like him
This lad should be fired.
Natural antibodies and t cells last longer. And were seen more effective than the vaccine against variants in the Israel study...
Respect.
Face the fact that the 'vaccines' NEITHER protect from infection NOR the transmission of the virus...   That is THE science...  Ask all the panel from "The View"... ;-)
Instead of relying on advice from  "vaccine experts" why not use common logic and look to evidence and facts?  Data doesn't have secret agendas, people do.
Big up this doctor
He’s on point. That’s exactly why I keep postponing getting a jab. How many times do we have to get vaccinated? Two times? Three times? Four times? Once every month? When I take a medicine, I know exactly how many pills I have to take and when. This vaccine campaign is out of control. It’s against Nuremberg accord.
Loved watching Javid struggle! Lol Doctor's got a point the Jab is good but not sustainable. We need a mix of vaccinated and natural immunity in the population and hope fully we can wean ourselves off the vaccine.
I understand he says he has antibodies so therefore in his opinion doesn't need the vaccine, but he doesn't put forward any argument for not having it. I don't understand why he is so resistant.
It is a truly personal choice,  I am double jabbed but I stand by someones right to chose and i am really uncomfortable with the media drive to demonise those people, this is not what a democratic country should be doing, is it?
He’s not bare below the elbows
Like how they end the video when it was gettin to the good part 😆🤷🏽‍♂️🤣
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 😳😳😳😳 woooow
need this energy in Australia
I got double vaccinated and I really regret it. I wish I never would have gotten it.
Brave man, good on him
Only stupid people need experts! Humans make misstakes! Experts and specialists also!!!
What’s the problem here if he does not want to get jabbed, uppercut him.
I respect what the doctor said and agree with him . No one should be forced to be injected with a experimental drug
I think nurses are done with this covid as they struggle more than the doctors.A huge hats off to our nurses all around  NHS. Still no one guaretee about vaccination because even vaccinated people are getting covid.Some experts says the severity can be reduced that's why vaccination is important. But I think once covid then natural immunity ( antibodies)can fight against it.Even if people are vaccinated the covid still attracts them and some people get mildly affected but some people still get worsly affected.
How many staff have taken the vaccine under duress.  I am totally against compulsory vaccines.
Respect for This doctor
doctors/nurses who don't believe in medicine maybe shouldn't work in medicine.
This just to show how clueless some of our doctors are. BBC cover this today debunking this Doctors claims. Embarrassing
The silence of the nurses says it all
This guy is a hero but Health Secretary has other plans. The prefer to listen to 'experts' who are deep into conflict of interest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8n9GpftejE&ab_channel=TheRubinReport
I like how javid asks an awkward controversial question and gets the best possible awkward answer in return, sickened mate.
“To the people that are vaccine experts” that comment bothered me.
Big up this guy for standing up, and answering when his staff couldn't
Clearly the health secretary has no medical background. Makes me wonder why he's even the health secretary 🤣
The Health Secretary is out of line asking these nurses a question on camera that would get them fired if they didn't support his views on vaccines.
Good on this Doc he's a bloody legend, stay strong mate. little grub politician just a puppet 🤬
He’s damn right, they are already talking about 4th vaccine which is absolutely ridiculous and unsustainable. The government should rethink their strategy. They can’t keep maintaining this “fully vaccinated” status of people who got two shots say an year ago. Someone who has a natural immunity from a recent illness has a way better protection than these people, yet when traveling they are treated like inferior. I think they should change all that PCR testing to antibody testing that detects both natural and vaccine immunity and establish thresholds for min. count if there is any cheap and quick quantitative testing… Or come up with one, that’s the best way to know the real danger anybody poses at a given moment of time..
If only the public was clever enough to see through the lies like this doctor has. But the scaremongering campaign has been pretty relentless on the news and TV adverts and lockdowns so eventually this pressure will make people succumb. Nearly 80% of people have had at least one jab in the UK. 20% of us, which includes this doctor, have a brain thankfully and can think for ourselves.
That doctor gets it
Respect to the doctor who speaks the truth 🙌
Well done. Why punish any who doesn't want it? Every must take vaccine to care for others, how about starvin tummies in the world... shouldn't we care for them first. Hypocrites.
Great NHS doctor
👏👏👏👏
Respect to this brave doctor
wanky wanky stanky
A MAN right there! Stay real from Poland!
Great Doctor.
Love this Doctor. One of the honest one i have ever heaed so far.
Good Man rest are complicit cowards
good man
Health Secretary says that there will always be a debate about it - where has the debate been?
I respect him! We need more voices like his!
Covid 19 vaccines don't work
I highly respect him for not wanting to get vaccinated. He truely deserves a clap 👏
kudos to the doctor....shame to the ignorant politician
This is great!  Standing up to a medical dictator!
FFS. Who educated the Proles?
He's right
"Can I ask your opinion, so I can completely ignore it and move swiftly on, thanks?"
NHS are severely short staffed, if and when it's mandatory for staff to have the vaccine and those who do not have it lose their job the place will sink even faster than it already is
Natural immunity is BETTER!
👏👏👏
Didn't a single TB jab (BCG) give protection for 15+ years? There's something very wrong about these new ones.
This video should be titled politician vs logic
This doctor is spot on .. finally someone talking sense and not being a sheep
The question to ask is why did weasel javid approach the nurses when he should have asked the doctor? That good man did the right thing by taking on the question and also put the politician in his place. Well done!
Well said sir. A man with integrity and critical thinking.  Having caught said virus( one of the strains anyways) and my missus having had 2 jabs of Astra, I could see how i lay in the couch clogged up and, at the time,  thinking "...this might be it..." even though I'm a non smoker, exercise regularly, and try to eat healthy (try...since there's chemicals in everything. Including the Teflon pans etc...et cuetra) plus at 42 not really in the vulnerable group, and yet, I caught it, and it was Bad....very bad. My partner on the other hand...fine as can be.  I can see both points of view, between a rock and a hard place indeed, and yet, its NOT sustainable to vaccinate everyone, every 2 months...even 3 months...irrelevent of the tax payers money being directed to the various company's out there producing said vaccines.  I'll wager the gov is waiting for the worse to pass...but knows full well this will have to stop.  Rather curious why he just doesn't say that to beguin with...
How god damn disrespectful to disregard this doctor that would of worked his arse off front line throughout the pandemic.  My husband works on goods level with the pharmacy department. He buys and sells drugs for his hospital and to others.  He comes into no contact with patients doesn’t deal with patients. His hospital has sent out a email saying that all front line members of staff have to be vaccinated which really he isn’t.  His manager asked him today would he be getting the vaccine. When he explained his interpretation of this email he got told that if he was to be in a lift or walk past a patient then he has to get the jab! What kind of made up on the spot crap is this.  How can the world over put pressure on people to put something into their body they don’t want. I am a type 1 diabetic I have had covid and I will not have the jab. There is no certainty given I have a underline medical condition that I will be ok after having it. Diabetics can suffer with heart conditions later on in life. The risks of not having it is just the same as having it in my opinion. The letters and texts I get sent on a weekly to not only book my vaccine but to book for my two teenagers to have it is cusp of harassment. People need to stand strong and not back down to this. Especially this so called health secretary.
I think Javid was hoping to hear good feedback for his mandate instead no one agreed and the good medical doctor based his judgement on science but what did javid responded- he was advised by vaccine experts— who???
Just take the vaccine ffs
I’ll listen to that dr over “vaccine experts” anyday. That dr’s not getting paid by the vaccine makers…
I commend this man for speaking up while everybody else was understandably afraid to do so and speaking his mind 👍🏾👊🏾
Our life style and food culture determine our antibody; everyone is different. Not everyone is lucky to be born healthy with natural antibody, so, I suppose the vaccines help to reduce the severity of the virus
10 % of the nhs has the brains and the balls , as for the rest 🐑🐑🐑
What a disgrace! Covid is so new that the only way we will find an effective vaccine is to test it. I wonder how many patients he has passed it on to?
We take the best advise from vaccine experts. Who are these experts? Pfizer themselves?
This Doctor beleives in GOD not the vaccinations or western medicine system. Good luck af and god bless Britania🤣
not that I'd like to get jabbed, but to maintain the vax's efficacy (weening off against delta after 8 weeks) the doctor says one would have to be jabbed every month. That is worse than other sceptical medic experts say that the vax weans off after 10 weeks, and I was calculating to get jabbed at least 5 times per year, which is nuts already.
Good for this guy!!! Hold strong to your convictions bro!!!
Fair play doc ,!  Good on u
Bravo!
Real doctors are rare these days. Well done to the lad
is the health secretary Dr Bob ??
How this video is still online?😃 They usually delete all of these...
Politics vs true science.
Brave doctor.
Egg head got it, he ain't got a bloody clue the whole cabinet needs removing...
👏👏👏👏👏least someone’s saying it
Bravo👏 very brave doctors 🎊
may god protect all doctors especially the ones like this man!
Says the with his mask not even covering his nose
Should be free choice
Listen to the health care staff—there are solid reasons why the jab has been questioned from the get go—
All we need to ask ourselves is if it wasn't for the vaccinated where would we be now? I don't think it can be disputed it's saved lives.
respect for the doc! im really happy he spoke out, and we should support him
He is practically dismissing the Doc turning his back whilst saying 'thats your view' Only a doctor, yet turns and asks the nurses what their view is wth
Is this doctor still employed..I'd be surprised
go on fella big respect !!!
Stop talking shizer Mr. Javid,, let people get antibodies naturally if they get it,,, than a useless jab that lasts only for a few weeks,,, no need to keep having jabs every few weeks,,,people should be able to have freedom of choice acts,, not companies pressuring stressing the people,,, people with capacity are supposed to have their own choice,,,,
He looks like doctor Mike  😂 completely agree I’d rather get natural antibodies that last longer than the vaccine .
This Doctor should open his own practice.
They don’t want to hear the truth
So he threw a colleague under the bus to defend his misguided view on why he doesn't want a vaccine that would protect his patients.  He is an anaesthetist, not a virologist for anyone listening to this idiot
Difference between someone with brains and someone with a script
Why does the Jewish community have vaccine exemption?
How can people be agreeing with this man just because he's an NHS doctor, NHS staff make mistakes all the time ffs don't take his side just because he has a certain job title, I've spoken too enough NHS doctors/nurses/specialists too know that they don't all know what they are talking about
The truth !
😅 love the honesty from the Dr. Somone was shutted down?;)
Good on him for speaking his truth.
The science also shows increasing reinfections for people with "natural immunity" averaging about 16 months (Source: The Lancet). Beyond that, we can only test for antibodies and we don't know what is an effective range yet.  Down the line I hope people will be able to test out, but as it stands now we just don't know enough about COVID to identify when someone has a sufficient level of natural immunity to not need the vaccine.
Firstly fair play to the doctor for airing his views, although unfortunately a lot of what he says reveals a flawed understanding of the science. He is clearly not a virologist. Secondly, us healthcare workers already need to get immunisation for a range of viruses as a condition of our employment, so the premise is not so unusual as it may seem to the public. Having said all that, it's likely that covid vaccination will become seasonal like the flu vaccine over time, but that we're not there yet.
Respect to this Dr, Actually questions this BS!
The guys just to stupid to take good advice from a Dr who knows more than him
This wise Doctor is trying to explain the logic of covid -19 unfortunately Mr Sajid  did not understand ... Bravo Doctor
Politicians!! Brainless, they should respect whether doctors, nurses or people wnats or not to get jabbed!
These are the doctors that they want rid of its sickening
He studied medicine? I wouldn’t want to be treated by him.
Why is he in asking the nurses what they think if his only response to the arguments put forth by the doctor was, “the vaccine experts.”
what an embarrassment that doctor is.
Brilliant , a doctor talking sense , but the Tory couldn't accept his view, just ended trying to put the doctor down , by saying we take advice from vaccine experts, didn't see this on the BBC 🤦
Javid's consensus is from the experts on the Gates Foundation pay roll
This guy has courage
Bravo!!!
Love this Doctor. Protect him and his job dear Universe!
It doesn't take being a vaccine expert to use common sense.  This doctor just explained the flaw in their reasoning to enforce a vaccine to maintain protection  and the reporter blatantly ignores it. 😑
The doctor understands the science better than Savid. If the nhs is struggling with staff off sick, leaving jobs from burnout and stress, Lord help us if the unvaccinated doctors, nurses and other nhs workers are forced to leave because they're not jabbed!! 😪
Loooool
He got hold
This guy deserves Tony the butchers knighthood.
No to forced vaccination!
Only lasts 8 weeks!!!!!! … that dr is right… that’s excessive… and I don’t have any intention of taking a booster every few months.  I haven’t had covid yet… and I did take the Pfizer 2-shots, initially.  But I will not boost even every 6 months .. let alone earlier than that.  I may do it annually because I have asthma (like I do with the flu and annual checkups and things they want to give me at the checkup…) … but that will be at the most.
Cowards  all the nurses   Im a vaccine expert. It is useless & if youtube removes my comment they are agreeing to be racist and homophobic
Respect for the doctor💪🏽 I haven’t been vaccinated myself and I’m not going to.
I'm sorry to say this but, having heard the whistleblower reports out there regarding the actions of e.g. phizer to force adherance to their vax doctrine, and the completely corrupt realities of that, I really don't think any of this has anything at all to do with the efficacy of these policies anymore, it's about money and power, disaster capitalism, end of story.
This doctor is not virologist. He's not an expert. How many times have doctors messed up people's treatment because of their ego. I know a doctor who caught covid at the start of the pandemic. It has changed his life for good. Prior to it he was super fit,  running marathons etc. Now he walks so far down a ward and has to sit down to rest. His heart rate is all over the place. This Doctor was lucky by the sounds of it,  other people not so lucky. I hope he doesn't speak to families who have lost loved ones from covid.
My point to all this Covid situation is, I only hear " Get vaccinate, or get a booster." But I don't hear from the media, or doctor's,  that injects us with " Get the vaccine slogan" Saying something like " We are looking for people that been exposed several times to Covid, and never getting the virus. So, we can find, if their are immune, and what can we do find out why, and if possible to create a real vaccine, based on real evidences. I never in media heard or read about it!" Instead they just want us to be vaccinated. Why? Which will lead to weakening ou immune system.  The doctor speaks facts
This doctor is a voice for the voiceless
He will not need a vaccine  because he will be fired... good  for him for speaking up unlike the muppets  who stood  and said nothing 🤦‍♂️
As a potential patient myself I am uncomfortable with doctors being forced to vaccinate! Not only is this unethical, it would also cause further shortages in profession where there is never enough of people!
Snake! Snake! There's a venomous snake on the ward!!
What is wrong with us Nurses is time to speak up.......!!!!!!!
"We take the very best advice that we can, from behavioural scientist experts" is what he meant to say
Fantastic 👏   Javid is a robotic puppet.... his brain couldn’t compute someone with common sense putting their argument across so articulately!   Hoping everyone would nod their head in in agreement in front of the cameras.... well he read that room poorly 🤣
Takes a brave one to speak up KNOWING what they're talking about
"Yeah I think people should wash their hands, but there really shouldn't be a mandate"   Thats what y'all sound like.
Big big big respect to this man. Wow how I’d love to hear how the rest of this conversation went… can’t help but think this Dr. has probably already lost his job for standing up for what he believes in. Again, big respect!
What a jobsworth politician.
doctor who :) u can dooit
I like how they make a random guy the "health Secretary" when he has no medical background lol just some random guy who's been elected into the roll the government is a joke smfh
Politicians are for the money, not for your lives.
Brilliant! Well done for the courage! Keep it up!
U kno. The excuse that the science isnt there is really annoying to still hear people say. Its 2022 and science is way more advanced than even 100 yrs ago. I thought people generally knew that🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😅😅😅
Imagine leading scientists in the field of vaccines and viruses telling the government there's no consensus in your vaccination mandates amongst virologists, and government just says well, that's your point view and we prefer to listen to virologists that work or use to work for big pharmaceutical companies. I don't think UK government understands what consensus in the scientific field is all about.
We take advice from the people who make the vaccines (and listen to nobody who questions our actions) He is unfit to govern.
If that doctor said this on twitter, his account would be deleted...wake up people.
This doctor knows more than Javid...fact.
Good man! And it's not a veiw, its an actual fact.
It just show how uttering moronic he and his government are.  There is a doctor serving on the front line during this pandemic and he arrogantly refuses to listen to him but will listen to faceless so called vaccine experts that are not on the front line.  In other words the giant pharmaceutical companies who are paying him.  A perfect example of lions led by a jackass.
Wow great answer from the Doc!!
I got nothing against vaccines and they do work to a certain degree. But the doctor has a point can't keep jabbing people every 3 months. Getting a jab done once a year not so bad but every 3 months is ridiculous governments around the world need to stand up for their citizens and tell the companies to make the vaccine last longer or cancel the cheque.
The Banker/Health secretary telling the doctor he knows best when it comes to science 🤣🤣 "our government our logic pahaahahahah" 🙄😳
Hope he would not need an ITU bed for himself ..... just foolish not to be vaccinated in my opinion !!!
We need more of this, great work!
Given how many of these Consultant Physicians are openly criticising him one has to wonder Are these attacks on Dr Steve James orchestrated by their NHS trust heads and ultimately Javid? Will these mouthpieces for the    mandatory vaccination policy be rewarded for their dirty work? Have they been offered incentives already? This Government needs to be kicked out ASAP but we must be very sure that we don't replace them with an equally dangerous vaccine Dictatorship
Come April there will be a lot of resignation... but I think they want the NHS to collapse.  I have been saying years they have sold the NHS to pharmaceutical companies. How they have been making policies over the pass 10 years show that they want it to collapse so they can privatise it.
The heart monitor adding to the suspense
Sajid Javid in the mud 💩
Absolute legend
I guess the nurse who spoke and explained everything will shortly get fired for saying the truth.
Study in Israel of 2.5 million people showed that natural immunity is 27 times more effective than the vaccine
True HERO in scrubs!!!! The experts are the ones at bedside, NHS!!!
@Sky News what happened? Won’t get your monthly Pfizer donation at this rate
Who is this Asian guy
This will be taken down soon 🤣🤣😅
Sorry to hear about this doctor commiting suicide via three bullets to the head 🙏
Useful idiots running the nations.
I had a brother almost die of covid due to not getting vaccinated. Natural immunity does nothing for certain people and no doctor or scientist can say why. He can be a doctor but he’s not saying the whole truth.
The nhs staff are scared of losing there job! It’s criminal how they are treated. Especially Nurses
Top class Dr. I havnt seen any brave doctor like him he just save the nurses from panic. I dont understand why the minster didnt take the dr advice as he got a lot of experience .sound he is looking for the bankers advice first
Well done sir , well done 💪 we need more people like him to challenge them
That went well?
I love how they go from we are listening to "medical/health experts" to we are following "vaccine experts", yet strangely even the vaccine experts don't support their bullshit. Pollies aren't even good with words anymore..
Good on him.. stand your ground. They can't say he doesn't know what he's on about..
"Vaccine experts" LOOOOL :) Vaccine experts :) Yes , vaccine all even they can still trasmit the virus - where is the logic ?~!
Good on him it proves there are many doctors and nurses that will refuse the mark of the beast, it's a pity patients can't refuse to be treated by vaccinated staff to support them.
Hospitals losing lots of good doctors and nurses over this. No wonder hospitals are "packed" because less staff means patients waiting even longer for treatment.
Respect for the doctor who speak up the truth.In my care home where I worked I was only one who didn't take that pointless jab ! I was thrown away like used Ppe thanks to Javid and his corrupted advisors.
I wonder who I should trust a politician and a consultant doctor, it is a tough choice 😏
Vaccines are for fools.
Try and stick something in me without my permission. Just try
oh boy…
The 'health secretary' being lecturered by a young doctor.
If people want the truth, here’s.. Respect for this man…
Not an accurate heading was it. He was pointing out he will lose his job... even those he has antibodies. Come on Sky News
Doctor sahab zindabaad!
Respect for this doctor 👍, we need people like him!
I totally agree with this Doctor
Protect this doctors at all cost 💕
Fire him.
Boss!
Load of wimpy arses. Say what u think ffs.
These are the type of doctors have been kept hush since day one. Hope he is ok and not sacked already
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Brave man. Respect
Great to here this from the doctor. Shocked sky posted this. Something majority us been saying for 2 years!
No dislikes 👎🏻 …says it all totally respect him for standing up for his rights ✨
He wasn’t listening at all to a doctor that made perfect sense.
God bless this man
"Vaccine experts" 😂😂  He's a serving front line doctor, u look a fool little man in the white shirt😂😂
The silence is louder than anything else. Those people are using common sense. And common sense is something the government doesn't like.
There are doctors who believe in a sky daddy aka God, being a doctor doesn't make smart!
If that's  a doctor that is talking,it's worrying. Up to him if he don't want to get vaccines. But it's what he is saying that's wrong people can get covid more than once and we have see people going on about antibody and they are no longer here
Glad to see a doctor speaking the truth but shame on those nurses who did not speak up.
But the pharmaceutical companies need to make their millions so take the booster x100 times
From the "vaccine experts." AKA Pfizer Chief Medical Offer AKA their Salesman of the Decade
I bet he has a mysterious accident
This video being posted is the definition of shooting ones foot.
Liar ! Jab kills do not get it.
Well done for speaking out, fell on deaf arrogant ears unfortunately.
Who are the vaccine experts.   He means the ones who make them. 🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻.  This is why our systems are so fucked up.
mr javid probably has an interest in Pfizer somewhere along the lines, how can they be so bullheaded.
Birds aren’t real
Wonder when he's going to do a Dr David Kelly?
Surprised Sky News showed this.  It felt as if he wanted to ask the nurses because he felt they wouldn’t say much but went on the back foot when the Doc spoke up
NHS staff have to have vaccines anyway…. So
Another bloody tennis player
He’ll be dismissed?! Wow
This doctor and this comment section. Wow. (N I don't mean that as a compliment).
This clip speaks a thousand words and not much was even said.  How long will the people actually believe in the government.
All NHS staff that don't want the vaccine should go off on stress! Sort that out Boris!!!
They are scared to tell their opinion.
Go Doctor Go👍
Politicians without their script are like fish out of water. Well done, sir 👊🏻
Now he is worth a clap and a bow!
How come its only Govid Necessaries who can choose and Govid Essentials whilst the populace are threatened with their livelihoods if they do not submit 🤔
They are gonna destroy the NHS and then we are all going to have to go private
Good and neither will I.
I think that our good old health secetary fully expected everybody to back him up - Well said doctor, they are crumbling.
Dr: The science isn’t strong enough   Jarvid: that’s your views 😂
Gang gang. Well done doctor ✊🏾
Well said doc !
He has no business being the health Secretary. He's a bloody banker.
Dr Steve James has two big balls ,  what more can I say  people are afraid to talk, fortunately there are still brave people ,  my doc only gives me antibiotics every visit even if I sneeze hahahaha and keeps asking me why I haven't been stabbed yet :)
Give this brave Doctor a 🎖medal!
WELL DONE TO THIS DR!!!!! ITS ALL A LOAD OF NONSENSE.
This man is no sheep. RESPECT!!!
All this bollocks would go away so much quicker if people would just stand up and say that they do not want to have this injection.
a woke doctor well said
Natural immunity is stronger than the vaccine….says 140 published studies.
Love that The government got egg on their Faces
Give that medic a huge cigar - long live freedom of belief and opinion!
"ADVICE FROM VACCINE EXPERTS"  If I was that doctor I would of lamped that bold little cut!!
Put the needles down!! 💉👎🏻
Well done 👏 to that man
It’s great to hear an opinion that is similar to my own.
From a Dr who declares he doesn’t take a vaccine is such a irresponsible thing to say. A vaccine has eradicated smallpox and polio. Vaccines saves lives !  The reason why this virus is hanging around is because not everyone is taking the vaccine
Finally, someone of stature talking some real sense on mainstream media, bravo!
When not showing the dislikes backfires
“From the people who are vaccine experts” that’s quite disrespectful. The doctor made valid points regardless if he’s a vaccine expert or not.
Respect to this doctor the world is waking up
Vaccine experts.!?... who is that ....total nonsense
Well done that brave Dr👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Finally they show someone from the NHS that says no to it
0:38 "yeah didn't like that answer, anyone else and this time with the answer I want please!" 😂😂😂
1:39 Actually, all the pharmaceutical companies are planning for exactly that: monthly booster shots
Good man
All healthcare professionals need to stand together and stay strong. The government should not allow people to lose thier jobs because they choose to not have the vaccine. Well done doc 🙏🏼
They have their own agenda and don’t even listen to the sense! He is dismissing a doctors view
0:36 Good for him 👍 I hope him luck
We been had
By March the 20th no jab no job.    Health secretary was not ready to have a sensible question thrown at him.  He might as well replied " don't blame me i don't make the fuking rules i just give them out "
Personally I don't believe for one minute that the boosters wear off after a month or two. Doesn't happen with flu vaccines, or other vaccines so why only with covid. The requirement for more boosters is just to perpetuate fear to leverage compliance or public acceptance when vaccines are made mandatory.
MASS FORMATION PSYCHOSIS!!
Be strong people the truth will come out .  I am not against any covid vaccine but mandatory for healthy and jong people is absolutely rubbish but just pharma lobby and marketing.
He definitely regretted taking to that Dr 😂😅
This means so much… That Doctor is fantastic… bless Him! 🙏🏽
Wow !!!! I rest my case ………..
Nothing like being belittled by a higher power, “we take advice from vaccine experts!” Don’t worry about the views of a front front line doctor and his front line understanding of the virus and his freedom of choice! I to am unvaccinated,  not an antivaxer just don’t want it! I am due to get married in April, let’s see if I can attend my own wedding with all the new rules coming!
Good on that doctor I suspect he will lose his job now for speaking the truth it dosent fit the health secretary’s agenda
Not all medics are Government puppets, it is heartening to hear from them.
There will probably be variants down to the letter Z. How much more boosters and vaccinations can the body take. When the tables turn will the NHS pay up for the unseeded havoc that is on the way ? Will they speak the truth ?
They’re killing people in hospitals. Wake up!
At the end he gets a sly dig in saying we take advice from people who are vaccine experts as to say he doesn't have the expertise to know what he's talking about
Coming from a NHS working doctor and the health secretary says what...... More should stand up and speak out just like this doctor, i give him! applause.
Why is the minister asking the staff about what they think, if he is not prepared to listen
Sometimes silence says more than 1000 words. Those nurses were afraid to speak up for fear of losing their jobs I guess. Kudos to the doctor for having the courage to stand up. For NHS staff to be treated like this by the government is absolutely disgusting.
Well done for speaking up. Someone with guts.
Science is science, not someone's view.
Someone REAL telling it how it is! Well done. SHARE SHARE SHARE
This consultant doctor was asked directly by Javid his opinion.
Vaccines experts are magically the Dickheads the public love voting in. Eating all the bullshit they can talk about.
Thats your view the politician says to the trained professional.
Yes he got schooled 😂
Amazing doctoryou are heroe
Fair play for honesty....
But what is going to be done about this? Are we all just accepting that those unvaccinated staff will be fired in April? Or is some action/lawsuit being planned?
This is a good example of a relaxed conversation between a government head and one of the public. I have had 1 jab as i fall into the group where not all jabs are ready for me yet. I'll probably hold off on the rest of the jabs until they become more consitsent and last longer; like the flu jab. The Dr. has every right to not get his jab, and I believe if he keeps his mask on and maintains lots of hygeine, good for him.
Well Done for him for speaking up 👏
What a brave guy! We need more doctors like him who will speak up for others!
I love this man. He's so calm, logical and reasonable
I cant see what he is trying to achieve by asking nhs what they think about it
Wonder who's more qualified here....????
90%........RUBBISH
Hundreds of doctors and trained virologists > 1 doctor!  Honestly, dont let anti vaxers use this as a tool!  ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️😢😢😢😢😢
I didn't think the sun or bbc would put this up lol and also let the comments open wow
Yes good on this guy for speaking up, everybody must make their own decision I agree 100%. And NHS staff should be rewarded for all their hard work not punished, But why is nobody talking about the fact that this doctor has had covid. It’s possible the reason this guy caught covid in the first place was because he didn’t have the vaccine. It’s also possible he could have passed it on to any number of people for all we know. Working in a hospital he may well have unknowingly passed it on to someone extremely vulnerable. I pray this isn’t the case, but these are the risks that need to be discussed and considered when not having the jab.
So Jarvis dismisses a Dr! By saying he’s not an expert! what a joke javid is!what are his credentials??? This country is up  the swanny! We are being lead by people who haven’t got a jar of glue!
Couldn’t have staged it any better . Loved the pauses as well  so awkward why they remember their lines .
He isn't that brave he wears a mask, how many jabs has he had in his life before covid ?
I’ve had the vaccine including the booster, this is my personal choice. I don’t think it is right to put people in a position where if they don’t get the vaccine that their jobs are in jeopardy.
Legend doctor speak the truth
Says it all. Shows how incompetent the government is. This guy is a doctor and he proves how wrong the government is. Shame how stupid people are…
Forcing or pressuring anybody to have any form of medication is wrong and this is not the way to tackle any problem. People have a choice, should have a choice and have the freedom of choice once all information has been laid out
Respect to this Young Doctor. Stand up and be a voice for those who's voices aren't being heard.
Well done sir and by the way guys listen to this doctor he knows 100x more than this bald head idiot
Lmaoooo, wheree are the ladies on the side not saying a word, the doctor speaking facts and saying the truth only and the guy in the white shirt dosen't like it.... xd lmaooo! ]
Kings college hospital  are basically  telling staffs no Jab no job and has given a deadline  as to when all staff members need to be jabbed by.
Well done doctor they’re not standing up for us!!!! Let’s stand up for each other. #NHS
I love this doctor.
JAB = 13
Who are these so call vaccine experts they take advice from
Well done. Speaking these days is equivalent to losing your job, sad that saying your opinion is brave and extremely risky.  What’s even more sad is it’s considered controversial to not want an untested, ineffective vaccine for something that is very unlikely to be lethal.   Absolute lunacy. Media work magic.
We take the best advice from the vaccine experts…… at Pfizer and Astra Zeneca.
For all we know in a few years time, we might only have unvaxxed doctors left.
This is democracy: out of how many people were there, only one had the guts to speak up. Well done doc, that's courage in a "democratic society"!!!
I'm double vaccinated but fair play to sky for actually showing an other point of view. Don't think job losses are the solution
Fu@&king  vaccine fascists. Congratulations to the doctor for being brave and telling the truth.
I totally agree with this doctor! The government wants the medical staff to become all IVDU or what? Let’s stop this nonsense of getting injected every few months. Nobody cared when Covid started in 2020, we all did our duties with courage and professionalism and guess what.. we still standing! If javid is suddenly a genuis in epidemiology how about helping people with HIV, that’s a nasty virus too !
Be cautious of those who brings up the experts
Boosters cost money and there are many making profit from this capitalised scheme, and when the tax payers lose their jobs who holds "control" of your living sorry, existing looks like 2birds 1 stone.
Stand together and stop this tyranny.. they are taking our rights and freedom
Good for him!!!
hes smart like me.
By enforcing this they would lose more doctors than they would by having unvaccinated doctors...
WELL DONE !👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾
Fair play too many are scared to speak
No debating this.YOUR POISON DOESN'T WORK, PISS OFF TYRANNICAL CRIMINALS
The Health Secretary….💩💩
Glad to sea doctors speaking out and question 👏👏👏 salute to Doctor!! Respect
That boldy is a numpty!
Only few adoment idiots trying to prove points without getting vaccinated. What is he a research expert, data expert, epimiologist or vaccine expert, just a junior medical college pass out 🤣🤣🤣
Fair play to this lovely doctor! Well done !
Good on that doctor. He’s clearly Capable of independent thought and has more intelligence than the others who unquestioningly follow the mob.  I love when Jarvis asked the first group about compulsory vacc expecting them to just nod and got absolute silence.
Thank god for this guy
Good stuff need more like this
Why didn't the women nurse's speak up
Well done Dr for speaking out
God bless him! He is a hero in my eyes and the others should have said something too
This is practically the truth Boris
Good man,  came to his colleagues aid. Gave his professional "view" then his place of work doesn't have his back by commenting at the end.. u have my respect sir
True words
No offence but the doctor probably knows more than the politician
Finally!!! The media reporting on REAL news. Any one with any form of intelligence knows this is now all absolute bullshit and the government are just trying to make themselves not look like fools…… It’s too late for that now,   try and lock us down again….. see what happens this time
More shocked that this is even on Sky News
Clap them yesterday sack them today. I would not blame them if they did a mass walkout. But seems to me to many are scared to challenge the tyrants that try and control us
If I express myself- will I be targeted again- happened many times with government/ council - police- I admire this Doctor- but he is going to be attacked
this uneducated "doctor" need to go back and learn about B cells......
I have no problems with having hospital treatment by a doctor or nurse who hasn't been vaccinated.
why ask a question if dismissive of an answer.
In my experience not all doctors agree with each other.
God this is embarrassing 😬.
I agree. I am a nurse and was at the full front of everything when it Started. I am not against vaccinations but I believe everyone should be given a choice. I was told that if I didn’t get jabbed I would lose my job and to me that it totally absurd. Why should me livelihood be used to threaten us.   What irritates me is that those making these decisions did not once come up to ICU to see our struggles and tears. It’s very Sad.
They're hero's one year and unemployable the next. It's bloody  shameful!
Not one nurse said,  "Oh yes, I'm looking forward to getting the vaxxes and all boosters. Please inject me now. " No. On the contrary... they were put on the spot and their silence suggested they do not want to be jabbed. Hope they stay strong against this evil medical tyranny.
If this Dr would have been in India and if he wouldn't have agreed with the minister, he would be sacked from his job.
Huge respect to this Dr. Literally shut him up in such a respectful n gentleman manner, good to see n hear.  Absolutely ludicrous to blame the people who aren't vaccinated that they are spreading the virus. Honestly the logic is crazy!
Good job to that Dr… thanks for speaking truth..
Would like to hear what expert virus scientists say on the matter? The medical doctor's argument seems to be based on speculation about the longevity of efficacy of the vaccine. Is it speculation or is there some truth in the claim that efficacy of a vaccine is gone after one month. He did not say why he did not take the vaccine;  would be interesting to know that? He seemed to be implying that medical doctors who have been exposed to Sars-Cov-2 but are not vaccinated will not benefit personally or pose an additional societal risk: there must be objective data on this point of view?
I am a truck driver & it’s was duly vaccinated with 72hr testing or no job. Been hospitalized due to jab & since have Covid. 2022 looks like more bullshit I must endure
I've had my 3 vaccines. If the doctor doesn't want to that is his choice. If the government do what they did to care homes to the NHS god  help us.
We need more doctors like him
Well done 👏!
This is the type of Dr I would love to be in charge of my wellbeing!!!
He takes advice from the very best. Lol, best government stooges.
I’m not one for conspiracy theories but it does seem they are hoping drs and nurses don’t get it so they can sack them and then say NHS has no staff so the government will have no choice but to go private.
https://youtu.be/busJjizJ0cg
That's your view, says the politician to the DOCTOR.
There is something not right about this it seems strange that  sky and the main stream media are showing this. They're pro vaccine and have not wanted to show any adverse talk regarding the vaccine so far, so why now????
Last I checked consultant anaesthetist weren’t specialist in infectious diseases…..
Takes Advice from BIG Pharma , Fascist .
The triumph of individualism leading to thousands of deaths
Bloody hell here is the nhs staff making more sense then the government trying to vaccinate everyone every two minutes. I’m not getting h the booster, I’ve had two shots and that’s enough
I think the doctor in this video is a true Brit. I can't believe Sajid Javid got stuck in telling the medical professional the government will decide who gets jabbed, a monthly jab just to keep topping up the coffers of the elite. What a disgrace.
Good on that doctor, what a man, ill happily go out at 8pm and clap for him alone.
Well done mr! I wish the nurses had said something too.. people need to speak up more
Personal choice.
Couldn't find a qualified person to get a balanced opinion if he tried. Surrounded by sycophants and so he expected those doctors and nurses to be no different. Someone please put a pin at that hospital's location so those interested can follow the science.
Love the doctor for speaking his mind sadly Savage Javid is probably planning on giving everyone a booster every month until we are all dead 😆 well not me because I haven't had the clot shot either 💯
I do like the way that a doctor stepped in. He will be given his notice by the end of the week for doing that
👍👍👍👍
No disrespect to this doctor if I need anaesthetising I would not defer to an epidemiologist over him but if I wanted advice on vaccination against Covid I will go with the overwhelming majority of epidemiologists that say it is necessary.
He knows its p.o.i.s.o.n
Full support for the doctor zero support for the government  They’ve never followed the science just make rules up as they want Natural immunity it’s always best
We take advice from ze experts init
If sajid is ill, send him to a vaccine specialist not a doctor, because they know better then a doctor
Well played doc  That moron asking the question hasnt got a clue
How peculiar.  Doctor accepts that for delta a vaccination would have stopped him passing on delta to his patients for 8 weeks.  Yet he did not take the vaccine!  Wow in those 8 weeks how many patients would he have seen?  How many people could he have potentially infected with delta? Not what most people would expect from a health professional I think.  Patients first I would have thought.
It takes scourge to stand alone. This guy is a hero, and they so badly want to silence him. FYI, there are no vaccine experts sir, only tyrant forces
That’s it, plain and simple, I sp with Doc had a mic to drop!
Bravo bravo bravo 👏👏👏👏❤🌹
Time to fight back
Javid no fcuk all about health he was put there because nobody wanted the job after hancock
The doctor does know what he is talking about he's A DOCTOR????
yeah the nusrses ,,wanted to say no ,, also ,,  xxx
Respect to the Doctor's
I wish the doctor was a bit stronger.  Also, there are 'vaccine experts', even in Pfizer, who are on records as saying their v@xxes are not safe.  But this doctor was a hero.  disciplined  I think the nurses, if the Kings NHS Trust is anything like mine, are constrained from saying anything not preapproved, or they would get disciplined.  Maybe even get sacked, if they agreed with the doctor.  If I were there, I would be polite but a lot firmer with Savid.  He needs suing!  Wait till April when up to 125 K NHS staff, including me, face sacking for refusal.    There are ALREADY 90 K, that's 90 THOUSAND, NHS vacancies, so, along with fiduicary mismanagement, it's no wonder that the NHS is under extreme stress, especially with this being the Influenza Season - my NHS Trust regularly goes into Black Alert quite often during the winter in 'normal' times.    As in the US, they might sack us, but they will be asking us to return when the NHS is on the verge...
We could do as the doc says and have a whole population get their antibodies from covid, sure. But there would be around 80% more deaths in the process. He's unfortunately not understanding the very basics
Anyone want to go to a hospital or doctor that isn’t questioning the science? Me either.   Stay away from organized health care
This is what we need to be doing all of us that know what is thru... Vaccinated and unvaccinated, temporarily or permanent immunity.
Brave guy said what we all think of and they will crucified him for this
This was my situation a few months ago.  Back in August 2021 I was placed on leave of Absence. They didn’t want to fire me. Luckily I found another employer  who allows me to test weekly. At least for now. I hope the truth comes out and we can sue all these criminals for Human rights violation. I’m glad it’s in the Supreme Court already. At the very least stop the mandates and the lying. Hold these corporations and politicians responsible for there corruption which I doubt will happen.
Finally, someone speaks and educate this useless politicians. Even though they know the truth very well themselves. Just the fact they were having Xmas party should be enough to know who is truthful.
My New Hero 😍🥰
Good for him to be so bold!
This is an expert in the field listen to him Savid!
The little leech didn't like the answer, but he tried his best to elicit from the staff to get an answer for his argument. Big slap on Javeds face lol
I could be wrong but it seems setup, where's the backlash!! Normally any doctors I've seen so far going against the establishment are shown the door ultra fast, could this be the push to introduce the COVID 💊??
That's your view. what does he know He is talking to a medical professional who oveously knows his stuff Don't listen to the politicians they are full of sh.. 💩
Can we just take a second to admire this gentleman for his brutal honesty.
Excellent, we need more people to speak up so that the government does not dictate how we live and what we do. The way this is going is like dictatorship  multiplied!!
Everyone knows these so called vaccine are useless.. It just isn't valid and effective.. Everybody who is healthy and young should avoid vaccination.. Older and sick people with some highly sensitive conditions should get jab, they have nothing to lose
Respect to that doctor for speaking the truth
Not even gonna comment on this except to ask what does he know that many others don't
Here, here
Good for him,  I agree with him  “That’s your view” wow the guy doing the interviewing doesn’t seem to want to listen
Few real men who can think for themselves and say nothing about any of this is enough proof scientifically ! MANY men ready to jump off a cliff if they just hear  it's so ....
Javid shut up and get me a Slurpee and a lottery ticket
“THATS YOUR VIEW” saying that to him like he’s not a doctor 🤣
Don't take Dr lucifers vax! Blessings.
Well done doctor! Happy that some NHS people are not afraid to say it straight
Great to see this type of thing finally reaching the main stream outlets... so many people brainwashed...
That broke his brain
People are driven by fear.
Finally someone with balls... sadly not many of does in NHS
RESPECT! 💚
This doctor now will get the sack we are all slaves
PATRIOT!! FREEDOM!!
My opinion is we don’t even need the vaccine end of
Hey somebody needs to give that Doctor a MVP Award let that's Doctors name be shared and I guarantee so many more with stand with him!!!
Critical thinking at its best. Standing up for what he believes in.  Human liberty is fragile, the vaccine should not be made mandatory.  Freedom to choose is everything.  George Orwell 1984 - everyone should read this book
This is why certain ages won't get the vaccine so much nevitive about the virus there being fed by media and TV bad thing we will never get rid of the virus not any time soon are covid have put nothing in to getting rid of we had locked down right at the very being shut down everything we would not be in this mess all those life's and not to mention other life's what what are very sick very bad illnesses we have lost fare to much it as to end Godbless to all the people all over the world 💖💖💖💖🌹🌹🌹🌹😘🙏😇😇
That Doctor deserves a medal for speaking up!!
Government fckhead!
This government need to do as New Zealand and Australia are doing stop non passport holders for the UK 🇬🇧 entry full stop  only allow entry if they are a UK resident passport holder but have go into a hotel for 14 days which isn't cheap, putting people off entering.... To stop any further strains of the virus coming in again and wait till the last 2 strains have burnt its self out... Then re assess boarder control.... Also including by sea too... No one in the UK, asylum seeks too, shut all entry into the UK down and get Covd19 controlled and stamped out as much as possible.... This should of been done in the first year of Covd19  and aspecially after the newest strain from Africa got in.... This government don't have a brian cell between them and won't listen to the advice given... So this nightmare goes on and on...
'Speaking the truth in times of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.'
Well done doc for speaking the truth and how it is ! RESPECT AND SUPPORT 100 PER CENT ! 💪❣️😇
Just because he's a medical doctor does not make him an expert in immunology or vaccines. Many watching this will forget where he claims to have been exposed and have antibodies. The point of a vaccine is to trigger protective antibodies in a controlled safe way.. BEFORE getting the actual infection. An actual infection is likely to cause lasting damage or fatality. For the overwhelming majority, a vaccine is an extremely safe alternative. But eh every unvaccinated person is welcome to keep playing Russian roulette with their lives.
The unsung hero of a doctor 💪
what a total idiot - he is not a doctor and should be stripped of his position. why does NHS employ this JERK!!  what a loser  SACK HIM
Legend
Every doctor that shares the same opinion please please speak out. Your voice will be heard and will be heard louder in number's
‘That’s your view!’ What a cretin. 6 years of medical school (probably unsubsidised) WASTED because he doesn’t have freedom of choice. Poor man. Disgusting!!!
It is the truth
Javid was cornered big time. Fair play to this doctor. What javid meant to to say was we take the advice which is most financially beneficial to the pharmaceutical firms.
Javid is useless....
Sajid wants advice from the 'vaccine experts'. Well, too bad virologists speaking truth get banned from Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube.
Yesss!!!!!!!! Nurse here! I’ve had covid, have antibodies and also refuse to get a jab! They are absolutely pointless
That doctor took the div to school
Well done Doc, brilliant for standing up for your right to make a choice! Funny that a Doctor doesn’t want the jab? 🤔 fair play to him! 👍
How embarrassing for the Health Sec to be so unprepared for some brutal honesty.   Give this Dr a bonus for not being blindly compliment and having his own back 👏
GigaChad
I don’t mean to sound ignorant but aren’t the antibodies only useful against the variant he caught? So if he had the original version then gets Delta his antibodies wouldn’t work properly would they?
No longer believing this, could easily be staged and is being promoted alot. Where as if they DON'T want inconvenient moments shown they are quickly removed.
It's funny how everybody suddenly is a bigger health expert than an actual doctor, who studied for many years AND worked for many years in the medical field.
The give away that the jab don't work is the bloody masks on the face
The weak and sickly believe they need injection protection.
Utter imbecile is Sajid Javed!  An uneducated mug standing in front of a front line Doctor and can not even respond with a logical answer!  Hats off and respect to this Doctor.  Stand your ground people..
Is he still working or is fired?
Well said Doctor,honesty at last.
Propaganda video gone wrong😂
One of the most stupidest thing i have ever seen in my lifetime is dummies who have never studied science ,medicine or anything pertaining to health are the ones prescribing and making recommendations on what they don't know. Is this the blind leading the blind.
Waw, such an intelligent honest doctor.  Now refreshing. Seen so much lying dash board puppies lately.
the so called jab experts including those that helped create it are saying to stop them.  This guy doesn't listen to any credible experts.
Any half vaccinated peeps (Pfizer) ? 😂 Won't go back for anymore shots!
Well said!! This Dr, should get a Knighthood! He speaks truth. He worked all through the Pandemic, now that we are nearly over it....they want to dismiss him!!! Thousands of Drs and Nurses feel that way. I will walk rather than put something in my body I don't want in. I have seen the Adverse Affects that this jab causes.
I want that doctor given round the clock protection. The powers to be WILL NOT accept anyone giving the truth about the Covid Vaccinations. This was one of the bravest acts I can remember from a doctor, since the start of this Covid pantomime.
The nurses poor side have all been put under pressure to keep their jobs!! At least the doctor has the balls to tell that muppet Javid could just face the facts that this is all a bullshit creation!! If this government had balls we would t have been in this stupid situation!!
lol as if the nurses are gonna say the doctor is talking bs!
Nice one!! Well said doctor!!
We have a king 👑
"From the people who are vaccine experts" I.e the pharmaceutical companies selling the product
Why is he asking those questions if he doesn't accept the answers. Vaccine experts? Yeah, those Pfizer experts who tried to hide their data for 75 years.
He know he is lieing
Hold on.....Sajid Javed does not have any medical background so who the  F!%# is he to tell a Medic to have a vaccination..... THIS DOCTOR MAKES PERFECT SENSE!!!
God bless everyone who chooses to speak their mind and stand for justice even if it can be threatening.
Health secretary " we take advice from the doctors on the payroll of the giant pharmaceutical corporations for profit"
Take Tony Blair's medal and give it to this doctor 🏅👍👌
Health secretary was very rude and schoolboy like with his response and wanted the last word “from the vaccine experts”
It’s not about a virus or a vaccine…that should be obvious to everyone by now…
Good good man shout out to this brave doctor who has taken a stand we need more people like him brilliant and he talks sense
Thats your opinion lol
Question for Mr Javed, how much money and  big Pharma contracts are going to your buddies?
Boosters every month, yeah Nahh
Idiot
Well done to him X
What a hero!
this doctor is a legend! i just wish the nurses had spoken up and supported him also.
100% Doc, the vaccine is NOT for everyone!
That's your view the way he is talking vaccine experts lol next  Hes taking to him like shut up cameras are here he is talking the troth and its seemed he was just trying to shut him up
The body language and eyes (slowly closing) of the staff in the background is also telling, probably managers of the hospital ward. If the cameras were not there I can imagine the government line coming straight out of their non-medical mouths.
So is this true. The "Booster is only effective for 1 month after which its effectiveness radically declines" Sounds like a DeCaprio line from the "Don't Look Up". "All scientists like me have been fired" Still no open debate about this  Pandemic, still all one sided Doom, Gloom, Fear and vilification of genuine skeptics.
That Health Secretary acted and sounded like a well trained seal... Which is the requirement to be in positions like that these days. 🤦
Any person who works in the medical field,  it's a given,  they are vaccinated for any disease.  They are there to protect, not bring disease to them. They should be replaced or lose  their license for endangerment.
Their vaccine experts have failed over and over again. That is the true misinformation. Repeating something over and over again expecting different results is insanity and pathetic. The only thing advancing in the plandemic is big pharmas profits💊😈
The doctor is brave. Bravo.
God bless that doctor  for telling that government  idiot he's  talking bollocks
So all the time and money spent on this man was wasted because of his principles, i wonder how many nurses could of been trained instead of him 🤔
Javier knows better. What a plank
Doctor is right, when someone exposured virus that person has automatically has antibodies same as the vaccined person. The secretary unfortunately he didn't understand what immunology is ?
I think it’s time the government admit they made a mistake and move on, the longer they keep this party line, the more inept they actually appear.
Doctor speaking the truth
So a politician argues with a man, a doctor on the frount line. So that is where we are, we are so F£$$D
Lol...The Mekon wasn't expecting that......!!!
So glad that this physician spoke up...The little bald guy tried to pivot to traditional talking point and,  epic fail..
Wish this video was longer. I’d love to hear more of what the Doctor has to say
Dr putting all his staff at risk.
Well done for being brave enough to say it doesn’t make sense!⭐️
Some saying this is a set up.
Much respect to the doctor for being so honest! 👏🏾
Lets hope he doesnt get s@ked for his truth 🙏well said doctor!
Well don doc for speaking up, Yes their getting advice alright, Pfizer, and their making billions, from an experimental drug they hold no liability for. Good place to go for advice!
All doctors need to put an end to this BS now. Nurses need to refuse to participate.  Politicians are all employees of big pharma.  Does anyone still not understand this?
Funny how if this was joe public he would be getting hate for being an anti vaxer. Hypocrites.
The silence of the nurses was tragic. They are afraid to speak. Shame on all of them.
yes let a load of politicians who know naff all about anything make decisions like this and take no notice of the people that actually know what they're talking about - the advice they are taking is from people working for the drug companies who are making money out of this and likely getting back handers from china
The doctor is so disrespectful. Hope he's been fired.
The Dr found a gap and he used it 🤣🤣🤣. They will keep him on a tight leash from now on 🤫🤫🤫
We all know what's really going on! The game is up I'm afraid!
They want us all to be jabbed, but don’t want to be jabbed themselves 🤔 ..
Good luck. The care staff haven’t had any. Even the ones that had covid and still had antibodies got the sack. It’s the law for them so it has to be for nhs staff, their in the thick of it, they deal directly with people with covid. Why weren’t they first actually. One of my colleagues sacked after 12 years service for not having jabs. Yet the families of the residents don’t need it to get through the door. How backwards is that.
Good for them obviously not in agreement!!
Great news good on them
The nurse in the light blue was spot on 👏👏👏👏👏
Sack him!
Who is with the doctor and not the peanut head 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Top man
Hero 👏👏👏
Health minister..We take advice from experts..( who are paid handsomely by the pharma industry ) ex = Has Beens: sperts = Short Spasms.
Though doctors, they talk about vaccine efficacy and waning as if it were a car being topped up with gas, which burns off when driving. That’s not even how the body operates. What has gone wrong in this world? Doctors can’t speak out, and when they do, they can’t do it intelligently.
My expert is bigger than yours, is his reply
How can a doctor be so foolish.
The Health Secretary has clearly made an administrative decision, and no medical facts are going to change it. That he would go to this facility and pretend to ask questions is an insult to everyone's intelligence. He is clearly calling us all stupid.
What a complete and utter knob jockey !! Well done Dr for standing up to him 👍🏼
Finally. Someone talking sense who also knows what he's talking about and most importantly standing up for his rights.
Last generation, repent. God is coming back soon and this time its personal! 😡🔪👑🦁
Savage Jabber
I applaud the doctor for saying this. All NHS staff at York Hospital, Clifton, North Yorkshire received a letter on Friday from senior management. This letter stated that any member of staff who is not willing to have the Covid vaccination within the next 12 weeks will be have their employment terminated. Despicable action from Senior Management/Government. 🤬
I have no respect for these coward nurses
Hero
I won't be surprised if he gets fired....well at least he spoke the truth. Well done doctor.
HOOORAY. More of this.
Was this on the actual TV?
Good man
A true hero
The Health secretary out of touch
Real dr with balls
Vaccine experts that have never treated one COVID patient and never will.. they're experts in working with humanized mice..the same experts that are exempt from taking them also.. and have big stakes in the companies producing them..
Keep it up!!! Never give put your head down and fight fight fight!!!
Brave Dr speaking out !  Does he still have his job ?
Brave doctor!!!!!!
Very hard to bulls**t a group of nurses! The doctor was on point too.
Try’s to brush of simple logic with the I’m taking expert advice card.   And sure we can’t see right through it.
Incredible. He's put everything on the line for what he stands for. Not only did he back his argument with his medical knowledge (regardless of him not being a COVID expert) it was thorough where the DH Minister (who oversee the threat, policies and data) had to take step back with a moist/vague response.
DoLS - Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards  We all have capacity to decide for ourselves until it is proven we have a mental impairment.   Are we all having DoLS in place?
Notice his reaction to the doc telling him about vaccines...he quickly tried to dismiss and asking the nurses in hope they will give contrary views. His body language was uncomfortable and as if he didn't want to hear what the doctor is saying and he just wanted to leave. They silencing the "experts" who are not for it and only allowing the "experts" who are pushing it.
IN YOUR FACE!!!!!
A doctor saying the science isn’t strong enough for vaccines and the reply is “that’s your view”   Seriously  But, I am very gratefully someone finally spoke up and we have it in recording!
Sadhead didn't see that coming. Well done for speaking out. Politicians don't give a toss about us, all about them selves
He even said it does reduce the chance of transmission so he shot himself in the foot immediately. Young doctors thinking they are experts in all fields but they’re not,
I wish there are more hero like this consultant anaesthetist to challenge the Health Secretary.  Best advise???? the health secretary took. Um!!!! Are there any alternative?
What ever happened to human rights &  freedom of will.....
What a man 👌🏿😎💯
When the truth hurts... Well spoken nurse!!!
Who the F*** are vaccine experts...find me one.....hahaha....hospital idiots....DUMB DOCTORS...#pharmaterrorism !!!
That was Your last week at work hahah
Savid  says,,, We take our advice from vaccine, experts....not a doctor.... Experts, who agree with our narrative... I say.  I wonder what vaccination does to the body, the dna, long term.... Hmmm
I ain’t had a vaccine and I’ve never had COVID yet, there’s no need for it.
These so called govt all over the world have lost it. Lies upon lies even when things are now glaring and evident yet they kept pushing. Only God knows what their plans are. They thought its gonna be easy to decieve people but now being exposed by God. Their claims now truely sounds stupid.
Good for him... let him keep his job and get rid of these goons in parliament who have screwed us all over
He shouldn’t be working in NHS, or take His license off better. Ridiculous
Well done doctor
Highest ratings to the doctor.
❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎
Well done doctor....respect for people with integrity.
And a doctor is not as expert as Witty etc!!Respect to this doctor x
What a back fire.
I applaud this doctor for telling the truth as it is. He is right. Anyone who has had covid has antibodies. It is not possible to give everyone a booster every month. I also refuse to have the vaccine. I would prefer my body to fight the infection off itself than rely on a vaccine which my body becomes dependant on. I dont trust the vaccine one bit. We cannot live in fear of this virus and we can't let the government force us into this. Let's stand together.
In general i been accepting the guidelines from the government on what to do with Covid, but i agree competely with this doctor. People that survived Covid should have the antibodies, why in the hell would they need a vaccinne?
Taking the vaccine is to protect myself ( from getting COVID).. on the other hand, I caught the virus.. anyway..but was able to survive without the use of any medications.  That is the logic. Take it to protect yourself, and to minimise the attack  Several millions were not able to survive the Virus infection.
So just who are the vaccine experts ?!. Clearly this doctor knows more than the experts (who are probably bathing in money from Big Pharma)….. This doctor is a credit to the flagship of truth !
I’m so proud of this doctor
A man who can think for himself. Good man.
my hero
Some gov idiot telling a dr ‘That’s your view.’ Huh?
I always wanted to be a vaccine expert.
Good doc's educate them. They think they know everything.  We need more like this doc's we r not fools. We know what is going on
Fantastic, that's the language this doctors should speak to these heirarchy idiots or puppet's who wants to vaccinate the population. Bravo doctor keep strong.
Maybe the politicians and the media should stop acting like they know better than doctors that are “experts” in the field of Medicine. I would rather place my life in the hands of doctors in the NHS to make the right decision for my health than “vaccine experts” out to make money.
what a hero!👏
I love this doctor
Brave man, we need to stand for what we believe regardless
That's your opinion, obviously, we have to weigh up how big our backhander from big pharma is going to be.
I love the energy the comment section has when they find a single doctor who supports their dumbass view. Broad medical consensus? Nah. The odd doctor (who puts people to sleep and knows next to nothing about virology)? What a hero. 🤦‍♂️
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻this doctor ❤❤❤
Vaccine expert=someone with ties to a pharmaceutical company....🤔
This guy might have just lost his job for speaking the truth.
Haha that wasn’t the response he wanted, I’m not anti vaxxer but I do agree everyone should have a choice weather to have something injected into them or not, regardless where they work
Your opinion Sajid says has he turns away ,  He's a a doctor saving lives everyday!!
He is a heroe  he spoke up.....
Hes saying what we all are thinking..the vaccine is piss water,this doctor should be the health secretary,he is way more qualified
utter rubbish!
1.52 . He’s boss telling him to shut he’s mouth 😆
Well done and well said doctor ✊
Correction: NHS doctor tells Health Secretary WHY he won't get jabbed
"Never before, in human history, has the ineffectiveness of a medical treatment been blamed on the people that didn't take it..."  And as others have said,  "We need to protect the protected by forcing the unprotected to get the same thing that didn't protect the protected..."  Makes sense to me.
This seems staged. Could it be they are telling us about the covid pill that the WEF have admitted to have produced?
I support the doctor’s right to choose
The nurses are gagged on saying anything that goes against the government push on covid jabs and well done for that Dr speaking out the truth on what is real and the fact there is just not enough evidence to support the use of these jabs
Ww2 Nuremberg trials declaration no one will ever have to undergo any medical procedure that they don't want like the poor jews underwent, Javid is acting like Josef mengele trying to make people undergo medical treatment
Well done
Natural immunity is the best immunity!!
mike drop
I agree with the guy whos giving his opinion on it because I don't want the vaccination either
If it's true for the medical staff, it is true for everybody. So if showing the presence of antibodies is enough, then that's what the Covid passport should be about. Showing either antibodies or vaccination. Mask wearing should still be mandatory, because it is not about immunity, but about transmission.
Great to see that there is still some decency and spine left in the NHS Javed is a weak corrupt globalist k unt. Nuremberg 2 is coming.
Great. We need more people like him.
No ones has to weigh up anything its our own personal choice not to be forced a radical new gene therapy NOT A VACCINE
Good to hear, well done that doctor!!
I am a dentist and every time I spoke to my patients who are matrons of chiefs of staff in one of the big London hospitals they said that more than 35% of their NHS staff are not COVID jabbed and will not change their opinion despite draconian measures taken by the government to get them sacked if they don't vaccinate by 1st of April 2022.
"We take advice from the people who are vaccine experts!" OUCH!! What an arrogant jerk that Sajid Javid is!
Well done to this doctor for logically challenging him and for speaking common sense backed with facts!
The silent nurses will speak out about the genocide practices soon , stay strong.
Good on that Dr for standing up to the man who is going to force NHS staff to lose their jobs! I have had Covid in April 2020 and I'm not having the vaccine (although I don't work for the NHS). I've looked into studies about antibodies and it seems natural immunity last a lot longer than the vaccine! #NHS100K
Great👍👏🙏 true facts from this doctor. Thanks from Germany ❤️
Sorry don’t believe 90% have had the jab
Vaccination won’t provide the doctor with much additional protection given he’s had the virus but refusing to have it rocks confidence in the vaccine broadly. His decision could cause others who haven’t had covid to refuse the vaccine and then potentially become ill/hospitalised. Doctors need to lead by example. At worst he might expect side effects for a few days.
They all know it isn’t good for ya
I've left my nursing degree because of this. I hate this!!!!!!
Mr Javid a tree that doesn't bend breaks in the wind.
My spouse was infected by someone who was vaccinated, got Covid and gave it to my spouse. Vaxx doesn’t stop it.
The doctor won with actual science
Respect !
😂😂😂 he got mugged off 😂😂😂 This doctor needs a medal 🏅
So he claims the learned Doctors natural immunity will also wane .... that's goes completely against what historical science has always shown for decades. Natural immunity consistently is shown to last for decades not months as per the vaccine data. The doctor is right, and is following the best of scientific data. The interviewer is clearly not and just another puppet of the mass psychosis.
The silence was deafening-
The nurses were just typical snowflake cowards .
this has nothing to do with science but terror that has not been seen since Adolf Hitler Hopefully more doctors will come along and this fascist terror will stop
A health secretary who doesn’t understand the work loads of the NHS health care workers 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
A health secretary who isn’t a medical professional!!
This was always about curbing the spread to ensure the elderly were protected. The most at risk groups are protected now it’s time to get back to normal.
I also don't know if I believe the numbers the majority of people I speak to also tell me they haven't gone for a booster.
I applaud the Dr, for his brave stand, against the bollocks we atre being brainwashed through the media.
90% of general public got that first jab!  And what percentage of them are currently satisfied with that.  Or have refused to take a second.  Think the doctor is smart enough and brave enough to use his head properly.  And as they say...the majority is always wrong.
Kings College🤢🤑
This doctor is hope that maybe terror will not win. This is the doctor for the Christ sake and maybe if doctor says he doesnt need these criminals will stop
Well Done Dr....and thank you....I am a Nurse leaving the private sector because of mandatory vaccines I wish I could work in the NHS but if will be mandatory...than....I WILL NOT
Cancel Tory Gov🤑Criminals🤢🤑
The nurses are to afraid to speak out ☹️
Hopefully that dr gets sacked in  the morning
"But at some point that [protection afforded by natural immunity due to previous exposure] will wane as well." Really? Where is the evidence for this?
MSM have already stated the lynch mob smear campaign with “angry doc’s denouncing sensible person”
Looks like jabs every month for the brainwashed people enjoy zombie land 😆
Interesting
39k likes says everything.
Thanks Doctor for putting this muppet where he belongs!!!
HERO and I'd say the front line expert. Politician typically condescending, arrogant paying lip service. This clip summarizes the whole ffed up situation
I mean he can't really talk medical language with a doctor lol
This Doctor is full of opinion. He isn't the best authority on coronvirus, and his refusal to vaccinate, which is the advice of those who are authorities on this virus, is dangerous and stupid.
Maybe there should be a DEBATE about it Mr Javid. Just stop pushing other peoples drug products at the taxpayers expense and risk!
A hero. well done.
Health😰Sec
These nurses were like rabbits caught in a headlights....this is a good example of what nurses are  like... I witness this alot in my line of work ....this is even evident in their attitude towards a pay increase. Alot of nurses will be offended by this comment because it is the truth...  I salute this Doctor as he was prepared to call out the bullshit that Javid is trying to chat....The NHS need bold men and women like him.
A true hero.  His expertise and advice being ignored?
Braveheart what a answer well said doctor .
Went well Javid 😂😂
Surprised the comments weren't turned off!
Thanks doc for speaking out the truth. No thanks to the profit secretary....I mean health secretary!
Cats got sajids tongue
Well done doc
They KEEP DELETING MY COMMENTS. GO WATCH VIDEO OF DR REINER FUELLMICH INTERVIEW DR DAVID E MARTIN TESTIMONIES ON FAUCI AND CDC. BOMBSHELL  DR Reiner Fuellmich has already filed biggest lawsuit against CDC. WHO and others for crimes against humanity.
They get there advise from vaccine experts haha 😄 😆
Total respect to this doctor, and disrespect to SJ,  his science or lack of doesn't make sense, other than the  nonsense of denying !!!! Running down the Rabbit hole
The health minister does not understand about health.
Funny how they shut him down from talking 😏 can't deal with the truth that we just don't need to get the Vaccine
I most likely had covid before getting jabbed. I've had both jabs. I'm not getting a 3rd a 4th or 5th. Its all bullshit.
The doctor is right because Omicron is a new strain. Good on him for telling the truth. Well done.
We are forced to take vaccine being working in a nursing home.
never knew doctors were antivax. learn something new everyday i geuss
He's talking about transmission rates, but what about the huge decrease in hospitalisations that can be attributed to vaccination? He can choose not to take the vaccine, but if he gets seriously ill it will be the tax payer who pays for him to stay off work sick, and foot the bill for any additional care he needs.
The vax merchants move like they’re in a trance. Its weird man.
I hope as they say that rich people wont need politicians very soon anymore.
What a dickhead javid is it?Time to get rid off these idiots, javid can't see  what the doctor is saying y the hell do qe have these idiots to run the country they are just a joke.
Well that's him sacked
A doctor saying don't get the jab. Yet they are overwhelmed by patents without in hospital without the jab.
432 💙💜
Sense being made
Bravo doctor!!! Common sense.
Sajid's answer basically translates to "I don't really know, I'm just towing the narrative"
I always think people who take up positions in government should have previously worked in the field that they are working in. Health Secretary should be a consultant doctor who understands how hospitals operate, education secretary should be a former head teacher who understands how schools operate etc. Instead, they get people who don't have a clue about how things work in practice.
"at some point that will wane as well"........... WHO, WHAT ,WHEN, AND SHOW ME THE DATA ON THIS  MIS INFORMATION.........
More of them need to speak up for them self's & have less fear about losing there jobs those doctors did not study for 10years in medical school to be made to feel used & manipulated by a careless NHS & people like Sajid Javid
So Javid knows more than a Consultant!
A guy trying to give advice to someone who knows nothing
How long til they sack him..
What is alternative to not have vaccinated ? ? Is 2 months still not protection ?? How many vulnerable people could be saved
Respect to this Doctor. It takes genuine guts to go to the powerful who aren't used to being gainsaid, and do just that.
Nothing but respect to him as a doctor !u can see who’s talking on script these politicians need to shut up an actually do some work, instead trying persuade people the colour red is actually blue
Good on him
Wow is msm actually broadcasting the other side of the discourse. Hope arrives.
What!? How can they put up that statement at the very end - ".....we strongly recommend....the jab"? Anyone who doesn't see the madness in that is brainwashed.😶
Well done Dr ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
“Vaccine experts”, he meant crooks.
His comment " that's your view " he's a doctor worked in the toughest times so yea I'll go more doctors argument.....
So much respect for this fellow colleague! 👏🏼🙌🏼👏🏼🙌🏼
They fired them here in Canada and now with the omicron wave they're crying about not having enough staff. One year they were heroes and the next year they can't even receive EI benefits after being fired. And the average person will call them "science deniers" meanwhile healthcare staff like him have been working the covid wards since the beginning and have skills needed to work through the wave. Ridiculous!
This man trying to argue with a consultant doctor.  Politicians arguing with a CONSULTANT DOCTOR about what’s better for health.
All of this COVID is falling…minister don’t want to talk with him …he is safe person with his own immune system protection…
Pmsl praise the Lord
Good. People need to stop buying this big pharma nonsense.
1:54 we take the very best ADVISE. Yeah from the ones who said it would be one and done and now have income for life selling BOOSTERS that do WHAT?
2020: clap for the hero's of the NHS 2022: sack the anti vaxxers
the consultants is a hero , how dare the banker talk down to him
Bloke is a plank! Sack him and put him in the stocks.
Stupido baksin kubid.. hecta delta omellete.. new varian IHU ihateu ilapyou.. deceptiocon.. stupido
Lol he told baldy
the love of money will see many souls in hell.
Well done to the doctor! Javid saying they are listening the advice from the vaccine people is a joke. Vaccine people looks for profits. This is disgrace, nhs struggles anyway and they getting rid off valuable doctors.
"Listen to the experts"  "Unless it's experts with critical and objectionable thinking skills, then sack them"
I think most people the world over want to give vaccination and boosters a chance. They may not be as passionate and vocal, but it does look like they are the majority.
Doctors like him who fought COVID19 in hospitals from the beginning, and chooses not to be vaccinated the government call him "selfish, stupid,  hesitant or ignorant. Just think about it !  First a clap, then a kick in the a**.
Doctor👍 teach him wisdom
He's well awake.
No additional benefit from vaccines… why waist taxpayers money on vaccines.
What joke advice from whom
The doctor is a man of noble character. God Almighty bless him and protect him.
That Doctor was protecting his nurses!!! Good job!!
I bet he had an email from HR lol.
People are afraid to speak.  The fear has taken root.  The science is not proven.  We are being played.
What annoys me is literally only 1 guy has the courage to speak up and its news asif it's something amazing. Wtf is wrong with ppl, girls giggling like their in school smh
Whys he stood there telling a medical expert he's not an expert? Condescending and manipulative at its peak!
This report would not have been on the basis BBC.
Omicron produces same effect as vaccination..........
Respect! This doctor has courage and stands against excuse me “the fucked up “””health secretary”””
GREAT DOCTOR!!!!!!! He gave the FACTS!!!!!!!!! The other guy just didn’t have a clue...he did NOT have anything to answer. „We have information of the vaccine-experts“ is NOT any kind of fact. What ARE the „experts facts“?! The doctor is absolutely right when he says we have to overthink the situation because of Omicron.   I am a med. doctor from Germany, we DO HAVE the mandatory. I have been vaccinated twice, still dealing with the side effects, having tested my antibodycount (which is 1148bau/ml) and I refuse the booster. Nobody wants to hear about the side effects. And I now have to make the decision of loosing my job or risk more side effects.
We need more doctors like this man!
Hmm this is dodgy the Dr owns his own health and well being very expensive private practice in the hospital,  no wonder he is going to be anti vax
Sj is not Doctor . That man is a Doctor  and more qualified. than sj he listen to Mr  Doom whittie .
This doctor has courage to open his mouth against the fucked up guy reporter!
Ironic that statement at the end .. as someone that works for the NHS I can fully confirm it is mandatory now for all workers who are in a clinical or patient patient role to have both jabs .. then they'll keep pushing their boosters every other month .. no thanks
Was this shown live?
It’s a shame he’s being publicly condemned by media - he has more public support than they’re letting on
Good on him. Legend
He’s seen the worst of it, been in the thick of it, weighed it up and decided not to get jabbed, fair enough! I’m pro vaccine but pro bodily autonomy!
I'll be leaving soon unless I'm made exempt I have crohns disease as well such a shame so many vacancies are going
Civil liberties please. The vaccines, also lose their protection. Individuals are also taking best advice just like Government Ministers. Who is to say Government advice is best. I personally know people who caught covid soon after taking their boosters. There is no science to say that these people do not inffect others in the same way as unvaccinated people can. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated are making a contribution to understanding this man made disease. Please do not stigmatise anyone.
This guy speaks common sense  Protect him at all costs
Brave MAN very brave MAN
This is a CAMBRIDGE TRAINED DOCTOR - he has more than merely a VIEW!!!!
Wow !
Well said got massive respect for that guy said it how it is, the vaccines dont work,
We use to mock north korea for its media giving the party line, all I here from ministers is how World beating we are and what a great NHS and so on, truth is under this current regime were becoming more a banana Republic every week Johnson in number 10. What is the biggest joke is how the corruption and lies and incompetence is now accepted because of no proper opposition party.
What a boss. That doctor could see those nurses were intimidated and he spoke strong and proud. He is right it is a choice and to lose a job is not acceptable. Is barbaric. Nobody should be having to force someones hand to give them an injection
1.2million views bow that speaks volumes.
What is really intriguing and suspicious about this doc, is that he closed his private practice back in March last year. Then suddenly reopened it on the very same day he goes public with this interview, perhaps knowing it would go viral along with all the free publicity that would bring. He is charging £500 for initial consultation then £250 for half hour follow ups. Be interesting to see if he's another grifter and his practice/wealth picks up because of it.
.....holy shiii
I'd rather take the advice of teams of experts at the top of their field than one kook anaesthetist
Trusted news initiative is having a day off??
Health Secretary whose last job was chancellor with no medical credentials, shows why were in this mess and then tries to belittle a front line Dr.
He couldn’t reply anything else rather than ‘I respect your view’. He couldn’t even support the conversation. Liar.
Who are the vaccine experts maderna and Pfizer ???
Sky news are a disgrace!
Listen to how Javid dismisses this Doctor's qualified opinion out of hand, declaring "That's your view", going on to say that the Government will take the advice of "vaccine experts". So this lowly Doctor, working on the front line, just had his point of view ignored by a completely unqualified Politician who clearly thinks that mere doctors don't understand the problem well enough. He's going to listen to someone else. When this doctor and many like him refuse to be vaccinated, what is Javid going to do, call in the army?
this video now has 38,000 Likes and 1,000 dislikes.
Absolutely zero arguments from the man with the white shirt. Revolting.
Ignore the doctors viral knowledge because it doesn't align with your narrative. Tunnel vision psychosis.
Aint no Human being  alive a expert at nothing.  No human  can find a cure for death. GOD IS THE ONLY EXPERT  GOD ALLOW PEOPLE TO LIVE AND BREATHE THE BREATH OF LIFE  THAN ONE ONE DAY EVERYONE WILL DIE SOMEDAY  FROM OFF THIS EARTH.  THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE DELUSIONAL.
Well done! Free vax for ever
HA!
Money talks and bullshit walks.
Well done mate it sounds that he nos more then the other thinking he knows
All a scam
So much respect to this doctor for standing up for himself and calmley puting some facts across .
Well done Mr Doctor! He didn't like it did he,,, I've had covid in August 2020, and I'm still not gonna have the vaccine x
Proper order at least that dr has the backbone to speak up if he doesn't want that jab that's our choice medical fascism this is.
A former Banker asking about a vaccine like he knows the science.
The silence speaks volumes and then Dr Coup de Gras steps up and ends Mr Javid.
We need more doctors like him to speak up for the unvaccinated who don’t want or need this untested garbage.
Didn't realise javid was a qualified doctor saying he'll take advice from vaccine experts to a qualified doctor, stupid man lol 😆
Thank to this Dr for bring brave to tell the truth
NHS Doc dead now…..
No one is expert's.   They all just studied late night and wrote a exam .   That doesnt make them experts.   If they can bet there life and Pay check on it that it will be 100% then they are expert's.
Well done to the Dr for speaking the truth. I refuse to get vaccinated.
And that's your view.  Yes a trained professionals view
Health secretary just got whacked ,Excellent job sir
Big props to this doctor. Totally rational and logical argument.
He is my man! Sussed him straight out of the pool with 1st hand professional info.
So we're all still pretending there is a vaccine
Well done doctor 👏 he didn't expect that
"Vaccine Experts " At what making a vaccine what dont work lol
"The Science is not strong enough",      Mad respect to the awesome doctor
Take your masks off bin them in the name of Jesus Christ. I’m done with following evil. Nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. We serve a very jealous God. He wants all his people to turn to him and repent   This is not his kingdom. Heaven is his throne. And anyone who wants to keep following these evil people will be condemned. And lose there souls to eternal hell. When the free gift from God is to believe on the one he sent for. Jesus Christ. Amen
The doctor has the fortitude to tell the truth and he seems to answer for the nurses. Their silence says it all. 🇨🇦 Follow the science has become a joke.
Well done Doctor much love from Ceylon !
Condescending little Savid, there for his little photo-opp. Well he didn’t expect that did he. Finally, some truth among all the BS.
This bald guy is an absolute fool as if he knows what he is talking about!
The only thing that worries me more is, he is wearing an apple watch, that watch carries more viruses and bacterias than his upper and lower airways.
This man is my hero!
Can't get a mate to sign him off, so he gets the sack. Whatever next?
His best response was he takes best advice from vaccine professionals. I wonder who employs all these 'vaccine professionals'.  When we constantly see people getting shut down or ignored everytime they go against the media narrative, how do we know that the exact same thing isn't happening to the people doing the research? I don't think it's too far fetched to assume or wonder if these scientists come up with research or evidence that goes against the narrative, are they also afraid to speak out or are they being silenced. To anyone reading this thinking I sound paranoid, when all the governments and media of the world are punishing people for thinking differently, how can we ever trust that we are getting the full truth?
That doctor should be knighted ...Not Blair ...
He won’t listen to facts based on the coal face He has ‘experts’ pushing stats all funded by the same people the gates clan,and pharma greed. Why isn’t anybody questioning why these highly trained nurses and GPs don’t want it… What are they seeing the media and the Gov ain’t reporting…
What a knob
Get this man is a cape!
If a scientist carries out a Qualitative Comparative Analysis of the data, draws a conclusion, that doesn't fit the established narrative in relation to C, and switches sides, more often than not they can expect to be excommunicated from the scientific/mainstream establishment. That defies logic.
That doctor deserves a lot of respect!!
Absolute gem. Protect this man at all costs ❤️❤️❤️
I work in healthcare and last week we all received an email saying your job ends if not fully vaccinated by April 1st.
As the surgeon said, the Omicron strain may change the situation with his immunity. Until then, the Government is his employer, answerable to the tax payer and also the NHS sole customer and paymaster.  So until then, just like surgeons are obliged to be vaccinated against the hepatitis B, he’ll have to follow the rules as laid out, or if he can, he's at liberty to work in the private sector.
Respect !!!! Don't vaccinate people !!!!
The health secretary doesn’t have a clue
Anyone who has worked in the heath service would fully understand why the nurses remain silent, its out of FEAR for their careers and jobs.They do not have the power of a consultant. Also did I hear SJ say something about debate. Bit late in the day to start talking about debating things, when their strategy has been divide, intimidate, mob pressure, vilifying. Stick to what your good at SJ, BULLYING!
He is smart ,why they are pushing vaccination 🤦‍♀️
Fair play to the doctor . What a hero
Rules are for fools! Especially when the rules are this foolish. Is this surrealist comedy like the office? David Brentesque wtf!
What’s the doctors opinion on his fellow nhs workers who caught it and died, the old and young, those who the jag saved. Yes he’s smart he’s a doctor but I’ll listen to the professors and scientists
The doctor has the common sense to tell the ignorant politician that the science doesn’t back it up.
Good on him
We went from clapping for the nhs workers to sacking them within 1 year. Respect to this dr for speaking his mind. Watch this podcast from last week with Joe Rogan and Dr Robert Malone and it will open your eyes to what’s really going on with this bs narrative the media and social media companies are pushing on the public.
Takes some balls. People don't realise the pressure they are under, not just losing their job, but potentially pariahed for the rest of their career if they have one.
Who the fook does he think he is talking like he's a doctor,,to a doctor 🤡🤬🤬
He just said he doesn't care what the doctor says because he only listens to "Vaccine Experts."
Well said Doctor
The man is a hero for giving his opinion. Lets keep and eye make sure he is not fired. Tthe Health Minister has obviously made up his mind and this 'soliciting of opinions' is just a charade.
Vaccine experts? 😄😄
Javid slaphead
We strongly urge (euphemism for mandatory) our staff to drink the Kool-aid
Good doctor
He should know better than to ignore the vaccine.
Seems like the muppet knows more than the doctors
A health secretary with no medical qualifications 🧐
Mark my comment. He will not be able to practice his job  in the near future. Im not a conspirationist, but from begining i said will be wave 5, and not only, whatever and i was called conspirationist
Weren't we told that the magic with this vaccine technology is that they can change it quickly to cover other variants?  Delta has been around for quite a while now, Omicron is newer. And we're still using the original vaccine? What gives?
Hmm, who should I trust? The politician, who is a liar professionally, or the man who went to medical school?
Saj should be sacked the doctor should take his job
Real G
What about the one in three asymptomatic people who contract Covid but show no symptoms and therefore don't end up in hospital? Why do they need a vaccination?
I have had first 2 jabs. After 8 months had covid n just recovered. Still not 100%. Have joint pain/body ache. I wasnt sure about having the booster. After contracted the virus I was like I should have had it. Now I am confused.
Good on this Doctor - we need more like him
About time someone who works in a hospital Spoke Out and told the truth
"we get advice from the experts" the health secretary says, and who are the experts? The pharma companies who have only their financial interest at heart.. and the puppet "useful idiots" in government have sold themselves to their pay masters and not really representing the people who voted to put them in office...
Im agree  with the doctor
i gotta thank that pigfuck for firing me for being late, traffic jams..
Hmmm...not bad...it's taken the NHS staff two years to work that one out..in the mean time the people who run government have almost taken away the right to refuse any medical procedure.
Interesting point...
Well done 👏 Smart Dr 👏
Only the newly forming British Civilian Party will end this horrific vaccine crime against the British people! Find them on Facebook! These criminal politicians are destroying our country!
To mandate a vaccine that would require monthly boosters just to maintain its efficacy, just crazy to me. Although it reduces your chance of contacting or transmitting the virus, it's not the wonder drug they sold it as a year ago. To me, it makes much more sense for there to be proper investment in the appropriate PPE & for staff to an have LFT before work, than it does to introduce any type of mandate at this stage. .... and the lack of studies, focus or debate on natural immunity is also concerning.
Everybody is entitled to their own views when it comes to taking any kind of medication whether it be tablets or vaccine regardless of their professions. I respect this doctor's view of opinion. The body needs to constantly be reactivated with it's own immune and defence mechanism like in the common cold scenario
Savage Jab'em should listen to the doctor.
A vaccine is something that protects against transmission or infection for a long time we only need to look at Israel they are on the 4th booster and cases are through the roof.
So what if there where religions that prohibit  taking the vaccine?
Well done he stand up👍...I work for nhs in Wiltshire as a medical courier, I've been collecting all sorts of samples from GP, hospitals and surgery before covid started, i wanted to get covid to have natural immunity but i didn't in 2 years...now I'm fully vaccinated on 9 of November in Europe with single dose Jhonson&Jhonson and had covid on 14 of December. My family not vaccinated  and we all six of us had same mild symptoms like flu and nothing else. Now, one of my colleague been boosted 4 or 5 weeks ago and just tested positive last week. I will not have any other experimental aproved vaccine or booster with no liability in case of severe reaction for the sake of keeping my job with Nhs. What is the science behind all this rubbish? ..Get vaccinated to protect the vaccinated??...nonsense rubbish. Just looking forward to have my contract terminated as I'm not gonna share proof of vaccine frome EU and not gonna take any other vaccine or booster.
Amazing 🤞🏽
Apparently he's coming in for a lot of "flack" from other health care workers..Funny how not one of the nurses would comment/agree with Rabid Jabit.
What a guy. Someone standing up to this nonsense
Good for him
I would take to the streets with my pots and pans for this one 💯
Puppets are only told what to do and they go along with what ever it is even if they know its wrong. Prime example how he ignored the doctor who is qualified
The nurses were terrified of saying what they truly believe, they knew their jobs were pretty much on the line there with that assh*les question. And when he says "that's your view" I think that doctor handled it very well, because it sounded so snobby and dismissive when he said it, I honestly think I would have flipped on him. Such a disgusting human being he is. When are we going to get rid of people like him, they have so much power over the country and its people and treat us like we are something to be wiped off the bottom of their shoes. I just hope that people will stand up to such bullies without fear of losing their jobs or becoming ridiculed by these fools.
Javid wanted to be "a man of the people" until it backfired on him and he didn't get the answer he wanted. So he turned back to the nurses who weren't so confident in speaking to a "celeb". He was probably wetting himself at having to deal with the awkward situation.
A doctor that worked with Covid from the start (and not some random punter from the street): The science doesn't back it up.  HS: That's your view. no counter arguments or stats.
So...this dude is our HEALTH SECRETARY 🤨 Please tell me - What qualifies him to be our Health Secretary? Shouldn’t that go to someone with a background in medicine or something?
Need more Dr and Nurses to stand up for the truth and for the government come clean
Many thanks to the doctor.
Sly news, put these DRs words in thou pipe ( crack! ) and SMOKE it. Well said Dr
Kudos to the BRAVE doctor!!! We need more like him.
Look how scared the staff got when asked the jab question.  Sad and scary times.  CVD is exposing people's bad treatment of other's.
Legend.
So good to see a Doctor speaking up, and especially in front of the tv cameras. It makes absolute sense that he doesn't need the vaccine when he has natural antibodies which will most likely prove to be way more effective in the long run. Good Man! <3
Trust your own immune system, no one lives forever.
No one should be forced to take the vaccine....
I totally agree with the doctor✌
That's not his view, it's a FACT!
Wow,  a real Doctor with balls of steel
Thank u brave smart MD
I’m glad I listened to the doctor, and was impressed with his argument re: not being vaccinated. Shame the nursing staff were unable to voice their opinion? I wonder why? Saiid Javid is a decent person who would have listened to their responses. It’s a bloody awful time for us all & I can’t imagine the exhaustion of many people dealing with this endlessly x
I bet that dirty Politician hasn't had a jab either.
Sajid guilty of murder arrogant   and stupid or evil and paid off sick pri**
A doctor that knows more than the health secretary that Dr is doing a fantastic job 👏
My wife is a nurse she has had two vaccines she was told its mandatory in the hospitals I was furious her boss even told her she couldn't go out and mix with people no socialising I told her they can go fk themselves I ain't stopping living cause of these morons get lost
As ever arrogant politicians telling the front line EXPERTS what to think. Make it choice work everyone. Eventually we'll all have had it. For sure any health worker will have already been regularly infected by the real thin with real immunity not a vaccine with limited benefit. Nothing beats the real thing, which as this doctor says...he's had it.
I d like to correct my mistake in thinking that Sajid Javid was responsible for the mound at Marble Arch. Here is a doctor giving  a medical fact on  the value of vaccinations and the health minister still didn't believe him. It was very unfair of the minister to then turn  to question staff about vaccines  he is the health minister he should know and be well briefed
This was an ideal opportunity for them nurses or sister etc to finally say what they think yet the three GORMLESS bitches stand there with there fingers up there Arses....talk about GUTLESS ..
Well done to the Dr speaking his truth.
Next up we ask a baker & an accountant on their opinion of how the to tackle something they have not studying anything about...
Brave doctor speaking out! We are being bullied into silence.
This is the only sky news video I've ever put a thumbs up on. 👍 we need more doctors like this gent to stand up and be heard.
LOVE THIS DOCTOR for using logic and critical thinking. GOD BLESS HIM ❤
Spike protein affects endothelium!
He said it correctly that he didn't know if the protection from his infection has decreased or not...  There are dozens of peer reviewed papers about this topic..  This doctor is clearly not specialized in microbiology and it shows.
These are the heros of Covid yet they dont even care what they think.
I know who I believe
doctors a tool,  if booster does only give 2 months protection surely its still worth having.  I'd sack the clown now
Saj got rekt
people need to not be scared and say what they want it's called free speech so well done sir
Well done , so proud of this doctor !!! 👏👏👏
It says "add public comment".. and when I do.. it gets deleted... how are the general public ever gonna hear the truth, if we keep getting silence.. Dr James is so 100% right and the Health Sec was just out of his depth.. no doubt Y/T will delete this as well.
Well done to that doctor for standing up against this global tyranny. We need more like him to expose these frauds.
What I like is that Sajid Javid is trying to teach A DOCTOR about how immunity works…
Financial and employment, status terrorism is what the Govt will use (especially as there is now no social safety net ... Geaaaat Jaaaawwwwbbbb, omg,omg,omg)... Neo-Lib policy in the US, NZ, and Oz .. People with bombs are NOT the only terrorists.. :-(
I have Corona no vaccine and I'm fine, I would advise people not to get it, your putting yourself more at risk with the vaccine,
Wahoo, this doctor is so brave!
Everybody's personal situations are different when it comes to covid infections, Vaccinations, boosters and risks. Then there is decisions need to made on level of employers, employees, customers, society, city, state, countries and ultimately world organisations level. Politicians and their scientists are burdened to make decisions and to make right decisions in ever changing situations and ever changing informations. He's right to consult concern of the NHS employees but this seems like just photo op gone wrong.
Nurses are scared to losse their job. Time to open hospitals without restrictions regarding Covid bullsht.
The last time I saw Nurses giving "that look" was when Jimmy Savile was parading around N.H.S Hospitals.
Who is this person?  The guy asks the question, and then was very rude and dismissive to the physician who obviously didn’t give him the “correct” answer that he was expecting. He clearly thought he could intimidate the nurses into saying they were happy about the requirements, but their body language is very telling.  Such an awkward video.
Nurse are scared of health minister as he is a non scientist is fare from science just voted as ministry of health no relation to health at all where is the English people..speared and like vidio to make is millions like
Thats your view Doctor But I Know "Experts"........... also i'm a former banker so trust me. hahahahahhahahah Has anyone tested Sajid Javid for being on crack? probably should.......
Overall, total workforce vacancies last year across the NHS stood at 93,806 What does that say about how our government treat the NHS staff! Is this not the real issue here?
5 petrified nurses and one educated legend.
- Politicians are not experts on much, so why let them run our lives -
90% is a lie
Fire him
Respect for this man! He took the words out of my mouth. I am a scientist and I can’t place products that clean the body without thorough research etc. yet we are putting vaccines in our bodies that have not gone through the proper 5-15 years of clinical research. Even  though we have fought the virus without them: which shows our bodies are capable of fighting it!
Well done nurses, your silence was golden!
No body should force anyone to get the jabs or boaster even the government cant or the health secretary if they do then they are 🤬 and they should lose their jobs because it's a private reason for not to get the jabs. Well for me I anit have one because I'm not risking my life Getting it and I'm not a sheep and I don't follow the government
NONSENSE! THE JABS ARE A FRAUD. THEY DON'T WORK
Respect 🙂
That doctor is wrong. He is not an infectious disease expert. He has not read the data. He's putting people at risk.
Well done to the doctor
Jarvid couldn’t argue, hats off to him for speaking up
Wow , a Doctor with integrity……. there are a few good men out here!
I don’t know what the side effects are but I do feel after the vaccinations (a couple of months after) i feel very fatigued when running just two miles when I used to run 5-6 easily everyday, diet is the same, training is more or less the same, I don’t think it’s a placebo effect but I do feel that it has all to do with the vaccine that has negatively impacted me and has done for months afterwards in which I rarely suffered from before hand
Châu chấu, những dòng sông nước chảy như máu, bệnh dịch, hạn han, lủ lụt, các điềm lạ , động đất.. là báo hiệu tận thế  Phản Kito là ĐGH  Sắp tận thế lúc 15 giờ
I'm a Doctor in one of the busiest Hospitals in London and I think it's a bit naive to say what he said.  It's going to have a negative impact instead of  a positive one in terms of what's the right way to go about vaccinations.  Individually for the sake of himself fair point, but as a Doctor who has responsibility for patients. It sort of doesn't seem the right thing to say on a large platform such as national Tv.
It's always the vaccine 'experts' and these 🤡 government that have so much to say ,while the frontline Drs and nurses are the one telling us the truth what's going on. But yet the government aren't listening to them. The government is run Thanos🙄
Everybody knows the Government hates the people.
Welcome To 2030: I Own Nothing, Have No Privacy And Life Has Never Been Better
He thinks he knows better than a genuine veteran. What an arrogant jerk
Very brave Doctor,its everybody's choice to get vaccine or not. #Big No to mandatory vaccine.
That doctor is wrong . The booster does not wane after 2 months.
What a fked up world in which we live, where such clips are even possible.. cant believe it
The Dr is an example to us all. Well done for standing up for your rights. Knowledge is power.
Look at the lady at 1:00 can see that big smile through the mask 😂
even doctors can be idiots, this random doctor seems awful at his job, embarassing, no wonder the NHS is in such a state if this moron is an example of a 'doctor'
This DOctor is a gem needs to be protected at all cost. He said it out loud and clear 🔊🔊🔊😍😍😍😍👆😎
If people cannot see its the politicians causing this then  they are mentaly ill. This is hard to watch.
Silence says everything,, shame.... 🤮
Yeah but 90% of the staff is Already vaccinated. Our family doctor also advised us to get vaccinated. So I'm going with that. I'll follow the medical advices. Also even this doctor didn't say not to get vaccinated. Not sure about vaccine mandates though. Unless they can produce vaccines that are effective for 1.5 years plus, mandate not going to be effective, we cannot just get vaccinated every six months
YES! FIGHT BACK!!!
All mps are puppets. Who is pulling your strings????
'90%' have done so because their jobs have been threatened....the others have left or been sacked! Im fuming!!!!
By next Christmas fifth booster shots a will b consider fully vaccinated. This restore my faith in the so called highly effective, game changer hopeless vaccines.
Shame on these corrupt politicians. Tyranny 100%.
My doctor says the same
The best advice is listening to the front-line doctor expert in the ICU.
The nurses couldn't say a word, shame ,well done Dr for standing up and be brave
Look at that CEO opposite looking daggers at this brave doctor..
someone had to do this and see the appalling failures. this guy's a doctor and so we cant say much. he's gotta discuss/ debate with the 'experts'
Errm 🤣
.
What a joke that idiot really is there’s a doctor tell that thing what he thinks how is in the hospital working with patients every day and that spastic from the government thinks it knows better
real recognise real,  doctor is a real 1 for sure, the sheep staying silent should be ashamed. 💯
more not listening and hostility to real truths and people not just raising their sleeve. respect to this dr speaking out when so much pressure is on him to not, even when confronted with the health secretaries rhetoric!  and the nurses deafening silence spoke volumes!!
I think he was talking to the expert but lets just move on...
2:02, the fact they call it a jab, suggests to me it can be used as another meaning.
1:02, ya, for people who think.
Well done Doctor for taiking sense 👍
Why would they want to reduce the workforce of an already depleted NHS. Makes zero sense to me?
This is real bravery. It will cost him from an employment perspective but his integrity will be intact...a true NHS hero.
A lot of doctors and medicals supported Hitler's regime as well.  But the history will remember only the one who opposed. I am loosing my job in a month as well in two months. I don't know what will happen to me but I know I will not comply to the facsist government and all the media that support them.
Javid takes advice from the 'vaccine experts' who happen to be the  'vaccine manufacturers' ?
He’s a hero.
I am very surprised that that doctor was allowed to tell javid his views. This so called democracy we live in is so corrupt . Politicians being the most corrupt . Well said sir . 👌
I absolutely love this clip. The anaesthetist is so clear and articulate - and demonstrates that Javid is utterly clueless about the jabs.
The clown is arguing with a clear  doctor and or surgeon who's fully trained in medical background while he has absolutely no medical experience, it's almost as bad as world leaders listening to investor gates who has no medical 9r science backround
That guy is a hero!
What a legend. Honesty and common sense is rare these days. Give this man a job in the government.
Good on him , silent nurses , very awkward situation. Speaks for itself
That politician expertise is in economics…. What the fcuk is a vaccine expert…
The nurses clearly think the same but are too scared to say anything to big bad Sajid. DONT GET THE JAB.
Hope Sky News are choking on the truth in these comments, yes we the people who do have the power are not standing for the lies and poisoning going on.
He says from the vaccine experts , I am sure. The qualified medical professional knows what he's saying , and another ," vaccine expert ' Dr Robert Malone has a few things to say on the Joe Rogan show check it out !
Well done to this doctor. We need more like him ✊
Are we shortly going to read about a certain doctor looking for new employment?
💯
That "Health Secretary" is an arrogant and ignorant guy. The Dr just gave him clear science and he shrugged it off like it was nothing....in other words he will only listen to his puppet master.
Nurses are saying nothing which is very telling & the brave doctor speaks out & he is correct the science doesn't back it up. I bet that was more awkward for the health secretary than we seen on camera 🙄
My mate and his missus got their boosters 5 weeks ago now they have omicron. so I agree with the doctor
Totally agree with this Doctor
this just shows how unopen for discussion the vaccine vs peoples rights are as well as how frowned upon this is getting and causing segregation
The sheer novice of this vaccination should be enough for these so called experts to tread a little lighter on the almost sarcasm to this dr. There simply hasn't been enough time to even speculate how the vaccinations are going to affect people in the future, some say there will be little to no effects and the fact remains...time will tell us everything, what if the healthcare system gets overwhelmed in the future with people fraught with illness from the many vaccinations they've had. What then.
i agree with him about the booster not being practical or healthy...it could cause more harm than good too
Nurses make me sick
I think this doctor is very courageous to speak up against being forced to take the jab or loose your job.   The government doesn't make sense in this. Many doctors and scientists around the world are against this push to force people into taking the jab.
Way to go that doctor👍
Yess ladd
Good video.
Out of 8 members of staff 7 didn't respond to the minister's initial question. The only one to reply questioned the government policy. How embarrassing for the government!
This is brilliant! Brave guy. So, a politician arguing with a seasoned medical professional working on the covid frontline whose 'Science' and experience apparently don't stand for anything because it doesn't suit his 'Science advisors', bonkers!
Dunno, I feel like this was staged.... Gives the perfect opportunity to push the new pill.... This won't end until we say no.
This is brill
No salary increase for NHS staffs.politicians only doing drama
Shows these 'experts', let them come out and show themselves. I want the names of each person pushing this. Evidence of it all wouldn't hurt either. Plot twist, there IS NO SCIENTIFICALLY BACKED EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING. It's all riding on Louis Pasteurs fraud from the late 19th century. They can also quit pasteurising milk while they're at it.
Superb doctor, I say screw the government.
Well done !!!  That's all I have to say.
Brava!!!. This Dr is amazing. Someone who actually knows what they're talking about and who has NO AFFILIATION or FINANCIAL BIAS actually opposing the clown and his circus publicly. Need more just like this.
GOOD ON HIM FOR NOT HAVING THE JAB, YOUR BODY YOUR CHOICE
He takes advice from the vaccine experts!! What a laugh.. he should be in prison..
'By saying to a doctor  That's your view'  tells me that Sajid Javid doesn't respect his view simply because he's only a doctor and not a politician.
I would back the dr up 100% ridiculous that this guys employment would  be terminated  because he didn’t get vaccinated has javid got a phd
Well done Dr. We all should have a voice on this subject, freedom for all to make there own choices on there own. Government should back Down and leave use alone.
And isn't Germany or Denmark or someone currently stating that multiple jabs could have major side effects/problems?
Good for him he is sticking to his guns. He listens to his own gut instinct. Unlike millions of sheep
The Doctor is still pushing the government narrative the con vid  Omi con bs. And also the doc has is own private business,now with boosted sales and beware this is being promoted by MSM f@ke news channels ,I'm not buying this as being genuine as much as I want it to be truth
Thank doctor Steve James!!!
NHS = National Hoax and Scam
Well done doctor talking truth to power.  Not encouraged in these times as shown by the silence from the nurses.
Takes advice from experts yet takes a news crew to ask their opinion, he clearly thought it would be a landslide support for vaccines 🤣
Robert Malone made the vaccine and says its bad so who are the vaccine experts they take advice from.They dont believe the docter that works with it.So were does the expert knowledge come ftom
good man.
Chapeau Dr.
At least he could wear a mask correctly!
Doctor knows the truth that's why we'll said salute 👏
Surprised Sky even aired this
Tell him who u are!!! That u will not stand up to this
I can’t help but wonder why Sky posted this? They do not normally show opposite opinions. Is it staged or is genuine?
SMRT FAŠIZMU SLOBODA NARODU
Fair play to doc for standing up as them other 5 clowns are afraid to give an opinion as they in fear they lose jobs etc, no science involved
That health secretary has got a punch me face.
Big pharmaceuticals are making huge profits out of this , then look who are the director, board members and share holders ,its the politicians their family and the apparent experts , the sooner the msm stop telling lies the sooner this scam will end ,
Why ignore natural immunity is better protection , why do we follow CDC regulations
The nurses silence actually said more than the doctor
Medical tyrrany  through bulling and intimidation and fear of being sacked , the biggest scam in history
https://youtu.be/Fx9DDcUN3sM
Stop the Raping ....!
Well done.
Javid and his boss wont care unless people are dying ..   Until then get covid its fine according to them .
The nurses look like they were told to say nothing. It's TRUE what the doctor is saying
have they all forgotten about herd immunity-that only recvire 70% people with vacsination....... i will never take it,my friends life is ruined after her 2 shot..
It's about time someone talked common sense this man is a good man , speaking the truth in the face of a corrupt proven lying regime.......I trust what he is saying and it has given me hope that at last the other side is being heard and reported on.  Remind me again that I live in a 21 st century democracy. Governments are supposed serve the people.....something is badly wrong here.......
This doctor is brave to speak out what everyone is scared of. It is a shame that he doesn't have any support from his nurses. However the body language from the nurses can explain it all.
Perfect example of knowing when to speak and knowing when simply remain silent... Well done.   Salute. 🙋🏽‍♂️
His own decisions ❤
👏👏👏👏👏
Drs don’t wear watches!
I would trust that surgeons opinion a lot more than any of these lost politicians put it that way!
This is so appalling and terrifying on so many levels. Bravo to the brave doctor who spoke out, but shame on this female nurses for keeping their mouths shut when it was SO OBVIOUS they agreed with the doctor! It makes me feel ashamed to be a woman!! I would have stood up next to the doctor and supported him 100%. This short clip says so much…How sad…
Brave doctor, big respect. F these demons like Savid big pharma boy
Thanks for your courage !!!
Now this is one true Dr that probbly thinks for himself and makrs his own concluaion like any of us Doctors should, instead of always obeying the authoritarian protocols. BRAVO
But it dosent matter what the doctor says, the Media and the guverment are ours new doctors.
AOC was trippled vaxed and boosted still she caught covid. Those vaccines don't work
The title is made out to sound really bad. But this is got to be the best new's I have seen in a LONG time. Fair play to the doctor, it's nice to see a profession actually speaking for a change.
Dr. Steve LEGENDARY James... Bravo... Bravo...!!  The rest of the front-line really need to start to come forward and speak up on this impractical monthly booster for all (or even lesser intervals) forced/mandatory risky solution...   Cunning politicians are NOT experts, neither they take the actual advice from the actual experts, only from those dubious "experts for benefits" who keep agreeing with whatever the politicians' and their campaign-donors' agenda is...
I love that dr i hope they allow him to keep his job well said...
It's all staged wake up people 😴
The upmost respect for this man.
Hold the line, don't comply✌🇬🇧
I love this Doctor.
well done to the doctor  shame about nurses put on the spot !
Vaccine experts.🙄 like Bill Gates I suppose
Hero !!!
The nurses silence says it all. They are afraid to voice any opinion on the vax policy. They all know its a fraud. They are seeing it every day and their friends and colleagues who have piped up have been sacked.
He's been in ICU from the start and contracted covid and does not want/need a pointless vaccine (of dubious effectiveness and not yet completely trialled). Simple immune system common sense. Well done him! These views have become marginalised. One should not need to 'sell' a pandemic as much as this one has been sold.
Forget advise. Put the men of Science in your position of power to form and implement Scientific Laws on this issue. Iceland did and abolished use of Pfizer and Moderna after too many European and Nordic deaths from Cardiomyosis and Thrombosis and got rid of rule by politicians and closed the borders 2 years ago now and has had almost no deaths.
The nurses didn't want to speak for FEAR of losing their jobs. Manipulation by FEAR means CONTROL... End of!
At last - mainstream media starting to cover the whole story. Long may it continue.
I saw this . He is truthful and brave.  No emotions just cold hard facts.  Most Dr's don't have the 🏀🏀's he has
Let’s go Brandon..
Dr.Brave
ahaahahaha well done that man, a dr with balls?!
I respect a doctor or anybody that makes the right decisions  it's not 100-percent safe to have vaccination  also the doctor is qualified to discuss the matter the health minister is not qualified medically also the daughter is qualified to discuss the matter the health minister is not qualified medically the government are bully in the stuff that they need and who they have underpaid for many years and got away with it all the medical staff in a good position to solve the government to get stuffed
He is serious well your a idiot then
a health minister with zero medial bakground
The nurses were to scared to speak up ! Javid needs a punch 🥊 !  Javid says “ there will always be a debate about it ! Of course there won’t be a debate , the decision is already made !
Best leave it to an educated expert ,  eh Jabbid !
1.1 million views says it all..
The nurses are terrified of saying everything and look at the man in the back ground the one who runs the hospital.
Well done that man. Love those likes.
All experts say the vaccination works and is important for everyone to get. Along comes this doctor and contradicts! Doctor gets fired from his job and cancelled... All experts say the vaccionation works and is important for everyone to get! Now please repeat with me!
Its frightening to think that NHS and other health workers are not vaccinated at this point. They should all be sacked immediately.
We need more of this!!
This doctor is my 2022 hero
"we take the very best advise as we can"
That doctor is a hero.
Makes Chris Whitty look a complete Bell End, which we all thought, he was anyway. Kudos to this Doctor in standing firm!
Fair play to the GP!!!  The NHS should strike….
The one who does not compromise his hippocratic oath....Respect.
Hang in strong Medics, front line workers, all allied to the health profession  -   we have taken a stand and will NOT allow so called ' vaccine experts ' to trump actual science.   Immunology anyone ?
Casually just dismissing a trained doctor's opinion, when he's got no qualifications himself. Javid has experience/education in finance, he has no existing understanding of healthcare beyond what he's learned in the last 6 months. Really obvious why none of the nurses wanted to answer.
Astoundingly clear and concise. Anyone with half brain can see who knows more about the issue at hand.
Him and many other drs too🙌🏻🙌🏻
The doctor I hope he take them to court
Anyone working for NHS and not vaccinated should be totally ashamed of themselves
Good for that doctor. I'd love to have heard him push back harder on the natural immunity though... when Javid says "that wanes", he could have pushed back on that saying.. "NO... antibodies decrease as they should and have to but B cell and T cell immunity lasts a lot longer and that has been demonstrated. Vaccine immunity is nothing compared to natural immunity in terms of actual protection, transmission and longevity"
Well done that man
A truthful man but still no dialogue about boosting immunity
Bye!!
Sack the doctor!! ASAP!If only for his influence!!??!
doctor is not arsed to put bean head in his place  well in lad
There's a worldwide movement ✊ it's called freedom. Join the movement.
Also as per the WHO there is now a spare vaccine going begging to those who really need them in Africa
Booster every month? I'm no doctor and I'm terrible at math but I think he is wrong on that one. Anyhoo, it's good to see a doctor voice opinion (not conspiracy theories) rightly or wrongly without fear of reprimand. Funny seeing people praise Sky one vid and say they have an agenda another vid just because it's inline with their views this time.
The Dr talks sense
Well that was awkward..........
Well said doctor
From the ppl who are vaccine experts? Who have an ulterior motive. Sajid needs to be put down
wait so is he saying the covid vaccine eventually wears off or just the booster? because if thats true wtf is the point in still trying to push people into having the jab I mean the booster makes sense it won't last forever so whats the difference with the jab
Amazing!!!
Nearly 2 years of COVID with all top scientists probably working on it and still they deny it's origin....China gets away with it.... no-one even mentions the word China now .... disgusting...
Javid already know the Vax is dangerous, and is still in clinical trial until March 2023.  He won't have been jabbed. He knows that the nurses know about the side effects and he is just doing a mind game with them, because he knows they are low paid, and cannot afford free speech.  This is all about the end of the NHS. Javid knows that people will be sacked rather than risk the jab, and they will take their skills to the private sector, where they don't have to be jabbed. This is REALLY about shutting down the NHS.
Poi spiegatemi voi che differenza c'è tra fare educazione fisica a scuola con 25 alunni in uno spazio e fare attività sportiva al pomeriggio con la metà dei presenti ( vedi pallavolo o basket) nulla ha logica al mattino non serve nessun tipo di green pass al pomeriggio nella società sportiva serve il super Green pass con vaccino. Al mattino a scuola c'è un'esposizione maggiore visto il maggior numero di presenti in palestra ed è sempre una attività motoria. Non si capiscono queste differenze che non hanno logica.pomeriggio con la metà dei presenti ( vedi pallavolo o basket) nulla ha logica al mattino non serve nessun tipo di Green pass al pomeriggio nella società sportiva serve il super Green pass con vaccino. Al mattino scuola c'è un'esposizione maggiore visto il maggior numero di presenti in palestra ed è sempre un attività motoria. Non si capiscono queste differenze che non hanno logica.
The government don't take the advice they are given from the experts they listen then ignore it and just do what they want its become a totally joke could make a new Carry On Film out of this farce
My advice to the health minister is he should consider finding a new job
i love watching a non-medically trained professional politician telling a doctor "we take the best medical advice that we can", whilest rejecting his professional point of view
Question is,why do so many health workers not want the jab .
Vaccine experts like Kill Gates ?
Well done Doc! Someone needed to tell him (lol)
Yes. Precisely As....les from gov . Do not listen . People unite as one , do not let them devide us .
Go on Doctor lector , crushed the Health sec
He and others took a job to PROTECT OTHERS.   Advice is u must have it.   And he's breaking that rule.  Id fire him.
💓💓💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
best doctor ever, FREEDOM for everyone...
I can’t believe Kings College Hospital have not presented a viewpoint based on science.It is well know amongst experts that natural immunity is more durable than vaccine immunity.Perhaps the Government could get some REAL experts to advise them.The nurses silence said it all, they have been gagged and their silent protest bears witness.Well done Doctor for telling the truth in fact I think even he was measured in his response for fear of reprisals.
Nurses to scared to say anything
Sheep are not gonna like this but its the truth I've been hearing for the last year, well done for it making mainstream.
Finally a sky news video I don't have to dislike.
Well done to the doctor. Shame on Sajid Javid - to say he takes advice from 'vaccine experts'. He takes advice from whoever who says what he wants to hear to fit the government agenda of having us all vaccinated in order to have vaccine passports and ultimately digital IDs.  This doctor is stating the facts. For the vaccine to be truly effective people actually need to be boosted every month. That is unsustainable, both from a health and from an affordability point of view,.
“Vaccine Experts” AKA non expert, unqualified, spin doctors who rabbit our agenda.
Its not about a virus, so the Dr's proven medical point (not opinion) won't be considered.
That doctor should be fired on the spot. He might be a danger to fellow staff members and patients.
Hero!
What happens when your 90% drop dead, who is going to look after patients in the  hospitals.
Why not get the vaccine we are not being given a reason not to
natural immunity is better
I dont think I've laughed more in quite a while.
Courage, doctor. U are not alone
"Vaccine" "experts"
He’s right.   I personally feel the government know they  are wrong, however they are so far down this path now, any U turn on their narrative would be catastrophic and they would lose what they are all drunk on... Power.
Three cheers for the Doctor!
"We take the best advice we can from the people who are actually experts". That's a cop out. Now that the data is in we know that what the doctor is say is true. Antibodies from Covid are stronger than from the vax.
I'm sorry to say but the the doctor in the video is not an infectologist, but a consultant anesthetist -- and definitely a denialist as well. So, there are no specialists in the scene. Moreover, his arguments are clearly twisted, since he says protection is waning after eight weeks -- in fact, it is up to something between 12 to 16 weeks. And all that for what? "Because getting a jab will infringe in my personal freedom!" Hearing a similar argument from a healthcare worker is even more appalling.
This man's a hero
Well done that Doctor for speaking up. It's shocking how people are being ostracized for contesting or even questioning the agenda.
Stick that on your propaganda Javid "monthly jabs" forever. 😄💉💉💉💉
This doctor better watch his back now for speaking publicly
It’s not a vaccine and it doesn’t even work!
Finally! Keep it coming Sky news. How about covering the criminal investigation against the government next !!!
I would like to buy that Doctor a drink, I would put my trust in someone that spent 8 to 10 years in univeristy and in residency training and then on the Covid frontline for the last 2 years than anyone from that savage javid and his "vaccine experts" I wouldn't piss on him if he was on fire.
Is it about good health of people, or is it about something else?
It is forced redundancies..designed to make the free system buckle
The Doctor was calm, he stated facts as a medical expert good work man.  Javid bring out your so called experts on a live broadcast with people like this guy. Bet they're retired social media Fact Checkers.
The boosters compromise your immunity apparently. Who'd have guessed a jab rushed through for quick bucks wouldn't be that effective? There's no money in curing an illness, the money is in ongoing treatment..
Well spoken doctor
Well done to that doctor 👏 common sense and truth will shine through in the end.  The health Secretary showing ignorance to the Facts
So according to the young doc, the wisdom of the whole scientific community is wrong and few sceptics like him are right ?
Goodness this was actually brilliant. His response is retarded.
"Well, we take the very best advice that we can... FROM THE PEOPLE WHO SELL THE VACCINES"
Many doctors and nurses have got sick or died of Covid...yet we have this "doctor" questioning the whole scientific wisdom just because he did not die after getting infected!
The good doctor
Good on him. Nurses, speak up. This is not the time to be afraid.
After all this the health sectetary didn't even have an answer he is clueless , good on this doctor and I totally agree with him 👏
Not having a rational discussion will only harbour extremism and resent, well done doctor.
I'm commenting just to help this trend a fraction more. Have a good day. 😉
Well done doc
Body language: Javid is not unintelligent - he knows the medic is right.  He has no argument. But he has to tow the SAGE line or lose his career.
Second opinion used to be a good thing all of a sudden it's frowned upon! Vaccine experts this guy is on the front line ur not even a doctor and ur talking down to him! Egotistical arrogant a$$hole! We trust that Dr right there!!!
Publicity stunt fell on its arse there didn't it
The wanna be doctor tells a doctor who has been on the field longer than his ministerial or secretarial tenure his thought fit for cabbage.
Very brave man 👍
The doctor could give COVID-19 to a vulnerable patient who is admitted for other reasons. That patient might die from the virus given to them by the doctor.
The impartial Vax experts that work for the government
Javid and his COVID experts. What nonsense.  We have seen world over how these experts interpret COVID data and flipflop, belly flop and attend government parties well we the people are told to shut up and behave. Experts my foot
Secretary shut up and listern!
Government is a joke.
This man is an idiot according to Tony Blair.
These journalists think they know more than the professionals themselves. Disgusted to see these rats along with their political godfathers controlling the narrative.
Where did javid get his medical knowledge from??? What a idiot  got his knowledge out of a kinda egg
GOD BLESS THIS DOCTOR
Sajid Javid. Take the best advice - from vaccine experts. Very true.  He may be a doctor. But certainly nit an expert on covid.   I side with Sajid Javud
The Doctor is correct and makes good points !!!!! The bald guy is brainwashed and has NO common sense !!!!!!
Remove all restrictions... Masks social distancing lockdown ...just get on with mixing.👍😁
0
He'll be ok. If they sack him and others the UK people will do crowdfundings and I will certainly donate to help anybody standing their ground and losing their job until they find something else.
Hahahaha, cant talk reason with the unreasonable
This is the only truthfully thing iv seen on sky news
We all need to keep our eyes open for the Dr, to  make sure he doesn't get put out to pasture
Javid is a puppet for corporate interests .. always has been
We take the best advice… from people who are profiting off of the jabs. So shut up.
slimey torries
Lol never understand the west. A doctor doesn't trust vaccine. It's like a doctor doesn't trust medicine, isn't it.
He just DOESN'T KNOW WHEN TO STOP! ENOUGH of this CONMAN!!
These are the doctors we need, question everything.
Very good!
Vaccines salesman is who they listen too..
Healthy secretary’s is an idiot.  Natural immunity is protective from the entire virus. Protective of 5 proteins.  The vaccines only protect from 1 protein.  It’s all a lie for greed. A manufactured problem and a manufactured solution designed for profiteering.
The vaccine experts seem to be dismissing the science around herd immunity , control groups and natural immune system. Vaccine experts are in the pockets of Pfizer.
This Doctor is the Hero we deserve. Thankyou for speaking up.
If this scenario was happening in China everyone would scream its madness! It happens in Britain and everyone mumbles
Love this. Tell the fool.
It's not following the Science.It's following the BS😂😂😂
PR stunt didn't go this bully's way! Lol Guess what it wears off a lot quicker than two months and they know its failure!
Respect ✊🏻
Properly be sacked now like a lot of them who choose to live in a free country!!
What a kick in the teeth for NHS staff. From March 2020 that have been worked non stop and there was no vaccine then and it wasn’t a problem. This is disgusting and a breach of human rights
Brave doctor
"We take the very best advice we can." I LOVE THAT I CAN HEAR WHEN SOMEONE IS LYING THROUGH THEIR MASK. What a pile of horse manure. They will TRY to roll out monthly jabs. THINK OF ALL THE MONEY FOR BIG GREEDY PHARMA!!! Then all the horrific 'side-affects' they can treat!!! Allopathic Palooza!!!
Looooool snm
Well done Dr.......hopefully won't be out of a jab sorry job because he speaks truth May God bless him & his family
He is taking advice from vaccine experts, who sells vaccine… what Javid does is a crime, isn’t it?
😜 The mind Parasite has perfected the Art of listening and responding without hearing. Here is a successful demonstration performed on a well educated man 👍
GOOD ON HIM! There's too many sheeple these days and not enough people like him speaking out.  ***** !!! VACCINES SHOULD BE CHOICE, NOT FORCED !!! ***** (there's something very very strange about all this)
LOL, "what's your opinion?  Oh, shut up now we'll take our advice from experts that agree with us!"
King's College Hospital  should follow the advice of its doctors... not a politician.
Natural immunity antibodies after  getting covid is 8 plus better,also then get TCells that last for years
This politician should know not to ask a question when he does not know the answer.
So Sajid is basically telling someone who has spent years studying to become a doctor and would understand the science behind vaccines far better than Sajid having been on the frontline that “we take the best advice from the people that are vaccine experts”?  What a condescending statement.  And the nurses silence was deafening.
Natural immunity is the way to go!
Vaccine destroys untibodys
He speaks truth to madness. Madness was not listening.
Well said Doctor as it was evident the nurses were afraid to speak up and give they true opinions. The Doctor was probably doing his job the whole time without any vaccine but if he doesn’t stay inline and be a good boy like everyone else  that takes the vaccine that’s his job. They want decision from people that sit behind a desk instead of someone that’s frontline dealing with this on a daily and is fit and healthy.
🔥
Get the jab. Don’t be an idiot
What’s the point of asking the question when his quick to dismiss they opinions and decision, Big Pharma is controlling they law maker decisions and politicians as these enormous amounts of money being profited without any consideration of people’s free well to decide for themselves.
Upmost respect for this Dr.
Sky news is part of the problem.  They are full of trump loving, QANON nutters.
By vaccine experts, he might the ones who made the vaccines ... the big pharma where the money is coming from into the deep pockets of corrupted individuals.
Vaccine experts only want their money
L E G E N D
this doctor is a man bravo
It's soothing to  hear a voice of reason in this sea of madness.
The Covid-19 vaccine is genetherapy....
The "science" doesn't add up with the numbers they make up in america
Good on him for standing up!!!! Well done!! 👏👏👏👏
Wow anybody who takes the politian side over the front line doctor is either an idiot or a dumb teachers pet
Real Hero
This chap has BALLS
Finally a free thinker that's not afraid to speak the truth/fact's..... notice the difference between the sheeple and the free thinker within this video.
Sadgit Javid takes the best advise - Translation - We take advise from people who stack the data to back up where we want to take this. December headlines from SAGE 10,000 Hospitalisations a day and 5,000 Deaths a day - Very frightening but complete bullsh&t
He wouldn't BE. A doctor at all or working in a hospital unless he was Vaccinated for multiple things as well as annual influenza.. This anti vaxx drama is just getting out of hand . If people don't want to vaccinate and end up sick .they shouldn't be allowed hospital treatment
I smell a rat this looks like a set up
“We’ll take advice from the people that are vaccine expert”  How about taking advice from the biggest expert of them all, Dr. Robert Malone?
Sajid just got scienced 😂
Wow, 2 days in and YouTube has not band this ?
That's your view decries  the reporter. Was that not what the reporter was seeking? Maybe it was a vaccination affirmation.  The reporter then holds himself up in apparent equality, as though his view is equal to a doctor, who has worked in ICU since the beginning of the pandemic  Oh, the joy of this game.
“We take advise from the people that are vaccine experts” ..and have a vested interest in global distribution.   Vaccines are great, but their application needs to targetted and far more nuanced, economically and ethically.
What a brave man
Wonderful to witness this. This doctor displayed honesty and intelligence 👏👏👏 Greetings from Australia ❤
Ya ya but ya we ah ya take advice from the vaccine experts! Sorry I don't ya but yah don't have a clue lol 😆 im here to sell 😅 vaccines as ya the experts 😉 🤣 said 🤣 ya
Big business
90% are like the staff at the beginning of the video: shrugging their shoulders and nodding along whilst tyranny is being installed
Go stick Ur vaxs up Ur a.......
What education does the health minister 🤔 have for him to be the health minister 🙄????
nurses are just thinking of the next choreographed tok tok dance
People shouldn't have to vax if they don't want to
Good on u doctor. Ur a champion
I regret getting it. 3 months ago I was an arrrogant person who looked down on those against it as fools ignorant about science. And then I got poisoned without my consent or knowledge with a heavy metal (Gd) for an MRI scan. I became very sick. It's a covered up issue by big pharma so I received no help by doctors and was suggested psychiatric help instead. I discovered so many evil and disgusting things about the pharmaceutical industry, millions around the world victims of their harmful medication get no justice as big pharma has politicians in their pockets too. I am sad and angry to see how obviously governments are owned by them/the wealthy.
My respect for this doctor for being so honest and brave to speak out the truth.looks like the health secretary has been heavily paid off by Pharma mafia
Steve James is his name. We must protect him because his superiors will be coming down on him hard! Likely to be sacked very shortly but we must not let that happen
"Well thats your view" and turns his back on the doctor. What a POS!
I'm a Cardiology Nurse, double jabbed and boosted.. I agree with the vaccination programme, but am also staunchy against a mandate. Everyone, regardless of their reasons, MUST have the right to choose, I've said this from the beginning. Statistics and data and all that nomenclature cannot take into account the individual human factors that help us make these decisions. Some of the Anti-Vaxx conspiracy theories are ludicrous, but it is not my places nor the place of fat-cat political stooges to tell people what they can and cannot do with their bodies.. I commend my medical colleague for his calm, sensible, down-to-earth decision that he felt was appropriate for him.
Politics forces him to keep repeating the party line — no matter how weak their case (for vax mandates) keeps getting.  But the doctor is a rockstar for speaking up directly to the politician’s face.  Well done, and may this inspire and embolden others to stand up to the authorities.
I totally don't understand why is he the health Secretary with zero knowledge. Welldone Doctor finally someone who knows what he's talking about they should fire the so called heath secretary and give the job to the Doctor.
When politicians hide behind science but don’t really understand the nuance behind the science…
The doctor was proved right, based on how many people caught omicron regardless of vaccination status.
He exactly explains what I always tell my colleagues.
Good a professional in his element ripping a know nothing health sec
Well done doctor
Good on that doctor for speaking up. I wonder what the other staff would have said.
Did somebody ask that Pakistani man to show his covid passport? Or he just get in because he's "somebody"
Why suddenly the lefties became religious fanatics in their trust in the greedy vaccine companies?  They lost their minds.
"vaccine experts" and by that he means pharmaceutical companies with an economic interest
It will be over soon let it wear itself out .This is crazy all planned !
SMART DOC
Absolute legend!
Don't criticise this idiot doctor. Your comment will be deleted by the moron monitoring this site
All we need is Monoclonal Antibodies
This man is a legend, I would’ve said the exact same thing, he’s so right! The government are clueless
Everyone calling unvaxxd people "loons" don't know what this guy knows and would take his advice if they where sick
A bit of sanity in a world gone mad from mass psychosis.
That's your view,,, the reporter,,, what an idiot
Great! F*ck off with these good for nothing jabs
So he first asks what folk think, then when they tell him what they think,  he explains to them how what they think is wrong anyway because - EXPERTS.  Wow! I guess this must be NON-REPRESENTATIVE democracy.
There are other views, but those views have no scientific efficacy. Follow the science! Do the math!!
👏👏👏
So much respect for this doctor. Follow the actual science and not "The Science".
The single-masked medical doctor tells all those double-masked bureaucrats off! How epic!
Well said that that man 👏
And your views the prat like they will tell him, he needs to shove his jab right up his arse.
I’m double vaccinated but I think it’s ridiculous in some cases people are basically getting blackmailed into it, it’s your body and should be your personal choice
if this is not staged then my grandma is not near deaf
Lol vax experts 🤣🤣
We need more guys like him Well done doctor 🤝
Only one who spoke up. The rest are sheep. Unlike my doctor when asked if I should get the jab, said "Well, I am getting it." Was the dumbest advice I have ever heard from a doctor. Thankfully, America's Frontline Doctors filled me in and I got educated.
So ridiculous
This guy has no expertise in the area of immunology...
Balls of steel.
I myself am a massage expert. I think people should get a massage every week.
He claims he takes his advice from "vaccine experts"! This is sad! Here is a Doctor explaining to this man that his natural antibodies give him protection, is saying that natural protection will wane. There are experts who say the opposite, that natural immunity from infection is stronger, and longer lasting than the present vaccines. Where do these people get off thinking that "experts" can control how people live? They can RECOMMEND but that's all. Demand we obey them? What?
The divisions have been created
Typical govt response.  That doctor IS a practicing professional and should be listened to, rather than a POS politician.
There is no science that says natural immunity wanes. In fact antibodies from natural immunity are still strong 30 years later
Brilliant put this idiot in his place bNATURAL IMMUNITY IS THE WAY FORWARD NOT EXSPEREMENTAL VACCINES
Shame on the nurses
I understand, but get it, there will always be a debate about it. Absolute crap, there has been no scientific debate and any political debate is shutdown as quick as possible, the doctor is talking nothing but sense the clown is reading the script and insulting a frontline worker who has far more experience, disgusting
What a hero!  A hero for the UK who speaks truth!!
0:10 5 nurses, looking at each other, trying to find an answer, thank god the Doc stepped in….. He will be sacked soon. 🤔
Well done to the Dr 👍🤙👍 though Saj saying well we take the best advice from the best virologists was taken the piss.... Come on people stand up to those tyrants
Interesting that he clearly can’t rebut the data or the Drs logic, so he simply falls back on appeal to authority which is a fancy way of saying he doesn’t know what He’s talking about so he can’t disagree with him without looking like a dope....🤓 God bless this Dr for his courage to speak up...🙏🏽💒🙏🏽
BASED
Well done that man!!.....and Javid tries to tell him the science. Bet deep down he agrees with him too.
think safety
Wow talk about a health secretary not wanting wanting hear another opinion while asking about opinions 🙄 what a clown
No one should be forced to get vaccinated
He forgets to mention that his natural immunity is also short lived! He is not being honest! Plus he is an anaesthetists, not a virologist!
Health secretary drinking the kool-aid
Excellent! Keep the good fight for the truth! I guess the opposer has not listened to enough 'experts'
👏🏼 legend.
good on ya doc. tell em as it is. ur nealth and wellbeing of others is highest priority
No vaccine expert can argue against the logic of that one doctor.
He’s real science!
why would anyone want an old alpha booster shot thats two years old?
So why do we have flu jabs every year, I have not had the flu since starting mine a few years ago
Rules are rules, I don't get it why this is even news? Stop promoting content of this sort. Well he doesn't understand the bigger picture. The only way we can stop the virus making new variants is by getting vaccinated. This vaccine hesitancy has to stop and further please stop spreading misinformation. He needs to be ashamed of this and I hope  NHS suspends him
This man is absolutely amazing and I am grateful that he articulately conveys important evidence/ rationale for not getting the vaccine. This is why vaccine mandates are irrational. What was the point of Sajid Javid asking the question, if he was just going to shut down opinions that differ from the main narrative?? Quiet disgusting and disappointing really.
HEALTH SECRETARY!!!????? RATHER DEATH SECRETARY
JUST ANOTHER FAUCI SIKO
THIS SAJID GUY IS A CRIMINAL NWO PUPPET
That’s a real doctor giving his expert advice who knows what he is talking about what does Javid know he worked in a bank a few years ago he is just going to milk that position as long as he can line his pockets and be gone
"We take the best advice we can. From the people that are vaccine experts." Riiiight... vaccine experts just sitting on their porch waiting to be asked. No ties to the vaccine companies.
Easy: just fire him.
The vaccine experts. What a joke. The good ones are censored and shut down.
That reporter was awful!!
Take off that stupid mask, too!
Man is brilliant. Run for government!!
That is great for him but some people's health won't allow them to live through a bout with Covid-19. So vaccines are still relevent. The scientists still have to find a better solution.
This man has a backbone.
Looks like the Branch Covidians are lining up to attack this doctor. Something very strange about this whole business. Variants appearing on cue and manic attacks on people who choose to say no, which is their right. Piss off shills.
Hes thinking “boost everyone every month? yeah, hell yeah”
All we know is that he's a doctor. Of what? His position is not shared by the majority of experts who know more than he does. Just because he has a strong opinion means nothing.  Unfortunately we did not hear a counter argument from an expert and Javid is no expert and rightly said they they consider the directions of experts. My sister died of Covid related illness due to the stupidity of these ridiculous opinions. He should be nowhere near a hospital. The majority of commenters here are obviously jumping onto a convenient bandwagon as the title of the video will draw them like a lightening rod.  The other staff were like rabbits in the headlights not wanting to put their heads above the parapet. It's like a colonel going into a canteen in the presence of the staff sergeant and saying "any complaints lads" totally predicable lack of engagement. 😕
Sajid is just a Politician after Power and Money while Pretending to want to help Australia!
Go doc go!!
Pls pray for this Dr , so nothing happen to him.
Every single celled organisim in this comment section is going to die of Covid.   And I'm all for it.
Paid off by the sounds of it
Legend!
Well done Dr., the truth speaks for itself.  However, in the case of the Health Secretary, it seems that he lacked of any possible rationale to justify the mandate that he is imposing. My god...
The Dr makes a great point and obviously the minister is not intellectually up to speed to even debate! Minister just de-escalated by not engaging.
1million veiws 2days says it all
Governments are so wrong sacking doctors and nurses when we need them because vaccines don't work and when everyone gets omicron and they weren't vaccinated they are going to have good immune systems for the rest of their lives as opposed to need to get booster and vaccines every couple of months for the rest of your life that doesn't work.
We should support doctors and nurses as if we don't the majority of us will suffer if they quit their jobs because of this bullying into being vaccinated.
😅😂🤣😂😂😅
This is one of Sky news most viewed videos. Over 1 million views.   Hilarious.  The only way for Sky news to get more views than this would be to defame Joe Rogan...
This man is a hero !
ALL OFFICIALS MUST FACE NUREMBERG 2 TRIAL FOR THIS
If he disappears, we know who did it
I've had vaccines before: tetanus, small pox, polio, flu, and I've been in this world a long time, But I've never seen vaccines pushed so hard now like a massive sales pitch along with draconian threats. It's very suspicious and I am not taking it.
Hero
They vaccine is not safe many got injured from it. I got ed nimiaj was telling the truth
Hahaha this was the best thing I watched in last 2 years.
👏👏👏 bravo common sense and heart won. Big pharma who is killing people will take responsibility for many deaths?? Who are these experts?? Politicians who spending hard earned tax payers money..
Sajid has no medical expertise in any way almost telling a qualified NHS doctor that he's wrong,  either the medics are cowboys or the MPs are,... Which is which?
THANKYOU FOR SPEAKING YOUR TRUTH DR DO TELL 💜
The truth always comes out, it seems to be a force of nature.
May The Almighty Creator God, who's   WISDOM , TRUTH  and LOVE  is ABOVE  all mankind, -  BLESS  and PROTECT  that doctor for his COURAGE  to STAND !! - even when he was recieving oppostion and dismissal of  his  credibility,   knowledge, expertise and conscience  xox 🙏📖🥖🍷 🕊
Need to rise up against this ppl
A doctor using common sense and not caving to the pressure of the system to say what they want him to say.
That public health official was such a dismissive jerk. Good for the “real” doctor (anesthesiologist) for standing up and holding his ground to this clown!
The problem is, guys like Savid Javid have no qualifications or expertise to do the job he does. Thet just  hop from one department to the next.
Bye bye bye javid,  🤡
Doncha love it how the Health Secretary dismisses the highly trained doctor with a glib, that's your view. In my mind the highly trained medical staff doctor opinion is the science.
Finally
That dr said every month for vaccines
#legend 💕🙏
So why are they calling it a vaccine if immunisation is only effective for a month? My Measles vaccine immunises for life. Same for Chicken Pox.
Even if he thinks his acquired immunity is better than a booster, why not just take the booster anyway?  Its quick and free.
Good on him 💕
Well done lad. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Natural immunity is better than vaccination (and is most likely lifelong) why take the risk of an adverse event.
As a healthcare professional,  I totally agree to never take this jab!
Yes 👍
This doctor will now be targeted and forced out of medical practice, anyone who is honest with a psychopath and upsets their delusion is perceived as a threat and targeted as a criminal should be. This is why psychopaths are never fit to work in government.
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
All the casual and part-time workers still want to know who's paying their wages if they get COVID.is there a answer to that please let us know.its ok if your a politician or full-time worker your pockets will be full.
He’ll be fired or killed... new world order bitches won’t like a free thinking human with a brain....
This very brave doctor stands out like a lighthouse on very dark and stormy night - where are the rest of the doctors with their so called 'Hippocratic Oaths'. One major lesson I have learnt from this pandemic is that medical doctors do not deserve the respect and esteem we bestow upon them - they have feathered their nests and hidden behind government directives knowing that the science behind the government directives and mandates are flawed.
It’s politics and not about health. There’s plenty of money to be made and politicians around the world are in on it too. Follow the money, power/ control. Simples.
What a brave and reasonable doctor, but I hope that Sajid Javid won't have him murdered. :( Sky News should probably check on him again in a few months.
We take advice from vaccines experts, I think he mean those who are paid handsomely to push the vaccines as the only solution.
Doctor tries to explain science to journo
Come on! Backing this doctor and all he has stated all the way. Well done for speaking up! Sheepish response from the health secretary says it all.
We take our advice from a variety of people (pfizer), we have the best virologists (pfizer). 🤑
Science v political science.
He will leave that to the "vaccine experts"? Is that the manufacturer who makes more money the more people take it? Conflict of interest there, sorry
"There will always be a debate about it", he says. Then why the false information and the cencorship of any dissenting views?
Why are they trying to dumb down the truth . God help us. I want them to find who made the virus and wring their damn necks.
The health secretary is a p o s ….. and his actions and responses are classless
The nurses just sat there cowering. Tails between there legs.
This Doctor is misinformed 😑
Dr is quite an expert. Science can stand up to scrutiny. Allow all of the research to be  examined. It is still an emerging sutustion
The doc is right natural immunity after infection is far..far superior than the vax...
They were so not expecting that.  Well done Sir, and Tony Blair got a knighthood, Jesus wept.
Smart doctor and dumb secretary of state! What a difference!
I stand with that doctor and everything he said. A government never outlasts its people and neither do unjust laws
😊👍
What he should have said is that "Anyone mandating these experimental and harmful procedures needs to be tried under the Nuremberg code and hung."
Sure. Trust the random doctor over the researchers that have done all the work. He's surely qualified to report on the effectiveness of vaccination
It looks staged to get people on the tablets that are coming
The bald guy learned to duck and dodge and deny a long time ago. Health Secretary huh? Nope. Just a another puppet at the bottom of the big triangle of world domination. He's a flea on a dog.
Good for him , I’m not getting vaccinated either , something synister is behind all this
WELL DONE THAT DOCTOR.   WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING IS MARXISM.
That doctor is an absolute freaking tool.  He needs to go back to medical school
This doc knows the science and politicians are ignoring it at there own peril.
Good for him,!!!
Best thing I've  seen all year
💃💃💃💃
Can't believe they aired this, say no to never ending boosters
Advise comes from patels favorite holiday destination  and they are on jab 4
These nurses are sheep
“We take the very best advice that we can from the vaccines experts”. Who are the vaccine “ experts”. ? Are they paid for by pharmaceutical companies? Or do they work with or for pharmaceutical companies?
This doctor is a HERO for standing up for his, and our human rights.
Lol. Every month? That's only for the JJ vaccine. Just take either pfizer or moderna for more lasting protection
Sajid was trying soooo hard to be irritating....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A lot of our doctors won’t either.
This is the FRONT LINE SPEAKING! These higher ups need to move out of mother nature’s path so that patients can be cared for. Figure out an ONSET OF SYMPTOMS OUTPATIENT PROTOCOL with your “vaccine experts”.
I wonder how many doctors and professional Health Care workers have already lost their jobs, how many will loose their jobs, because of "their view", how it is in line with article 23 of the International Human Rights and how it affect the Health Care System in general.
I hate needles
I am vaccinated and so is my partner and most of my friends and co-workers. I do respect the calm discussion and disagreement on the topic, without throwing insults around.  It's... refreshing to see somebody calmly discuss this without throwing around words like "freedom", "sheep", etc.
An Er doctor offering opinions on epidemiology is like a mechanic offering opinions on rocket science!!
Good for the Dr for standing up.
I love this doctor 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them  John 3:36
It doesn't matter who the other opinion comes from unless it supports their vision it is still dismissed, fact or feasibility has holds no credence with these governments that have their agenda of control and political dictatorial aspirations, every country is experiencing this some are resisting more than others some less
Dr. Ball of steel . Respect!!!
I love this clip. Running around stabbing everyone with needles each week as a solution to running our health service into the ground for a decade is no solution at all. It’s not the virus that our NHS needs to be protected against - it’s these rancid austerity merchants and racketeers.
So fire all the doctors and nurses that choose not to get a covid shot and how will that turn out?  Those given a shot or not given a shot still can get covid.  It has been researched in Israel and those that have antibodies are much more well protected.  Plus what about the side affects people do not want to risk by getting a shot?  Blood clots, enlarged hearts, etc?
people who been jabbed are becoming bullys telling others to get a jab
Who’s the little puppet who ask questions however didn’t want to listen?
Yes sir! Don't get vaccinated the government is brainwashing people think for yourself not others
Javid came as a pharmaceutical vrp
The doctor bravely shares the facts ,then Javid quickly snipes at him "that's YOUR view". Rude idiotic man.
This is why they go by the majority consensus in the medical field because there's always a few doctors who could potentially get it wrong. That's the reason we get second and third opinions. Doctors can be wrong about things. The vast majority of doctors have come to a certain conclusion that it's better to be vaccinated.
I'm 2x jabbed, but the Dr is right. The booster program was designed before Omicron and is obsolete in the face of Omicron. Time to stop vaccinating the under 65s and reserve tests for healthcare settings only.
Good man who can think for himself we need more people like him
King College Oxford statement is a move to sweep over this nurses view  by saying we strongly advise people to take the vaccine.  well he strongly says he is not having the vaccine also . Javid recoiled  and hid for cover highlighting the experts  to shut the nurse down. So called experts feeding governments   have caused confusion and won't tell the public that people have died taking the vaccine too.  One sided rhetoric.
Yeah having to have a shot every month is so bizarre. Too much.
Major Balls from this Dr, ain't no money that can silence him at this point.
I am a nurse, like he's saying got covid in 2020 March, God blessed got better. I refused the vaccine, and got fired, out of job since September. Good news is God is still providing for me.
Forthright & Outspoken Dr. Narrative of his experience.  Was Infected by COVID.  Contention ? Natural antibodies vs  Syringed Antibodies . Syringed waning antibodies Boosters Busted by Dr.
He takes advice from the big pharma experts. Poor health secretary.
I appreciate his honesty and courage to speak up!
👏👏👏
Natural immunity = unable to prevent Covid-19.  Covid-19 is 100% preventable and people who are “naturally immune” showed their inability to prevent it. We’ve had way too many health care workers come in to work sick infecting others patients, vaccinations should certainly be enforced.
Thats your view, how dismissive. This guy is talking sense, its not all just one way, there's alternatives obviously. Friggin hell 🤦‍♀️
Then he should be dismissed
This doctor = legend!
Look at this on GB News (and I don't usually watch it) this info made me drop it here listen to Dr M Yeadon's take on the matters!  https://youtu.be/7SKDHfA82HA
❤💪
disgusting as usual
That LAST COMMENT is a BIG FAT LIE - The many, many honest experts say “Do NOT take the jab!!”
Hero.
*RESPECT* bravo Doctor 👏
Difference between this doctor and anti-vaxers is that this guy isn't anti-vax. A lot of anti-vaxers say it doesn't work, don't trust it etc. All he is saying that for him, and people in his position, that it isn't needed which is very sensible thing to say and his point is factually true. I'm sure if he didn't have antibodies or if/when a vaccine comes out that significantly reduces chance of catching and transmitting covid, he would get the vaccine
We will not get vaccinated.
Sensible, pragmatic and rational. Dr Steve James is a class act.
Oh did y'all heard the gossip? Kardashians are Fake 🤥 and Kim use to clean Brandy's closets  Oh yeah 💃TF 💉🤣 ⁉️
When there is a risk, there should be a choice...
Massive respect to all the doctors who are speaking up! The so called advise and scientist by all these politicians and beuracrates is outlandish and destructive. Now time has proven what many of these doctors warned about to be true!!
Big Pharma is paying the politicians Big Money
Not all doctors are the same. They have different area of expertise. For example, a bone doctor should keep quite when we are dealing with virus. We should listen to viral experts of the world, not few sceptics
Well said sir
Love how he basically says I know my sht and I have made my decision but the politician says we take our advice from Vax manufacturers because their science supports us and every bad  decision so far
I don’t understand why Javid is asking the question when he already knows the answer
It sickens me to see these Devils walking around with sleeves rolled up to give the impression of {I am working hard at this} Monsters, all of them...
Soo whats the harm in adding even more antibodies? Scared of needles?
Stay free Stay off DRUGS
That “doctor” should thank all the people who instead did take the vaccine and saved his hospital (and the country) from collapse.
I trust this doctor more than any so called "vaccine experts".
If doctors and scientists disagree like different religions, it is embarrassing
Nurses are all silent. Wow 🐑 mentality
They don't want to hear the truth. Nurses afraid to lose their jobs.
Masks. Everyone else wearing a N95 mask. This Anti Vaxxer doctor only one wearing just a surgical mask.  So, not only is he an Anti Vaxxer, he's also an Anti N95 Masker.  Good grief, If I need an Anaesthetist, I would not want this guy breathing on me with his covid ready to pass it on to me. Fr..king idiot!!
This “health secretary” for NUREMBERG TRIAL!!!
brave man next to a worm
Take the best advice from the vaccine experts aka big pharmas 🤨
Thank God for free-thinking patriots like this young doctor, standing up for individual rights
Wish I had the opportunity to work alongside this doctor. BSN prepared nurse stuck at home during a pandemic and a nursing shortage… no jab no job. But no worries, CDC has it ALL under control.
Those women didn’t even want to answer him fear of losing a job for their own opinion that’s why this is so wrong
The guy is pretty persistent for all to get vaccinated 😀
The expert are clueless. We have been taking expert advice and they all failed. Listen to practical doctors or alternative voice they have been silencing. The expert did not tell Us that we are going to be having monthly subscription to vaccine. They claim get your double jabs and we will Go back to normal. It’s either the expert lied to the public or they are clueless. We can’t trust them with our life anymore. The government should consult someone outside these vaccine cartel
its all about £££££
Plus vax us now in nuculus
He was previously infected and has immunity, what's the problem?
Some point, we are ALL going to be carriers of something.
I love this lol
"...well thats just your views---" thats not his views its Fact !
The only sensible one is the doctor 👨‍⚕️
A brave doctor and a bunch of COWARD nurses waiting to do their tiktok dances!
Good for him 👏 brave!!
Brave Doctor vs useless politician
This doctor used common sense to dismantle the health secretary.  Common sense will prevail…. 2022
The doctor is a clown.
Dr doesn't even know how to wear a mask correctly 🙄
This doctor needs a special something for being REAL. thankyou
I sense this is a piece that is somewhat staged/produced (otherwise why is it released to the mainstream… or perhaps it was leaked?) to get those already infected with covid and those un-veed to sign up to the booster program. Solidifying the message that doctors (or anyone for that matter) cannot have an expert opinion above the narrative of trust the science and the chosen few “experts.”
Good on this doctor. Shame on those nurses for staying quiet.
How could a doctor negate science , mistrust it but still earn practicing as a doctor…. I feel ashamed for paying my tax share for his salary. So is it like he don’t believe in what he is practicing?
"Vaccine experts"  like Dr. Robert Malone?
The doctor is giving facts. The other guy is offering none except ‘we take advice’.
Man with balls
Resist!
Twats
Respect to the Doctor. Disgusted at the nurses for remaining silent.
He’s correct. That’s where the magic comes from memory B and T cells!
From someone in the battle field (covid icu), what he is saying is spot on.  We have to do what make sense, practical, and sustainable.  I am fully vaccinated but I don't want to be jabbed every 6 months or everytime a new variant comes along.  We need to look for other solutions, with the vaccine primarily used to protect the vulnerable.  This virus, even without a brain, has totally outsmart all of us, unfortunately killed some of us, and yet this virus remain strong and unpredictable.  Putting a weak solution to a strong problem will not give us the result we need.
So if our best doctors, best teachers, workers etc etc are getting threatened to lose their jobs…. I say put em all together and create new communities
They are going to let hundreds if not thousands of excellent, qualified, trained, experienced staff walk out of the NHS when they are most in need because of some scientists wet dream that they want to vaccinate every human being.  Hopefully they will see sense before they make a hug error.  Vaccine mandates for this are plain wrong.  Tear the whole legislation up and say given the new omicron variant and what that has changed means we can do thhis - they dont even have to admit they were wrong.
True say..the vaccines will not achieve anything greater than your own immune system.
Educated doctor vs spin merchant.
These "virus experts" who work for the elites suppress Science to advance their agenda.
That doctor should be fired
An anesthetist is not an epidemiologist
He's correct!
Brave, wise and inspirational!
One Health Secretary completely out of his depth ! ! !
It's incredible how they're trying to make people believe that the jab is the same or even better than natural immunity to the virus when science has proved that natural immunity is better... we need more Dr. Like this one to stand up for the thruth.
Love this guy. Massive respect!!!
“We take the best advice, from the people that are vaccine experts” - Desperately trying to dismiss the Doctor’s concerns by saying he might be a doctor but he’s no vaccine expert, what a disgusting man.
I'm Spartacus!! The nurses definately weren't!
Everyone scared to speak up so fair play to this DR
90% vaccinated 😂
the doctor deserves to get omricon
This Dr should be chief medical officer!
Sack this doctor the man's a disgrace 😤
We muts keep fighting..for a real safe way to live!
This doctor, Jokovich in Australia... Till there are heros like them, we are alive...
I bet he got suicided because his precious brave Dr lips were so blessedly truthful behind his clothly mask. Hopes and prayers to his neighbours 🙏
The DR is a hero and speaks truth but the reason for the injections is to shepherd everyone on to the vaccine pass which has the same platform as the social credit system…..
Truth bomb!
Do not comply. Hold out. The truth will come out.
I don’t blame the doctor. The vaccine and the booster is a joke.
Health secretary is full of ....
Time to stand up to tyranny!!! Sajid Javid is a neoliberal Piers Morgan conservative not a populist by any means.
Bravo Dr 👏 👏
Wain is a lie nartural is for ever
A selfish doctor who only cares about himself.
I refuse to get the vaccine too.
He is not a medicine scientist who made the vaccine so how he would know he is just a doctor.
Love him
Much respect to the doctor. More doctors like this one.
Well done!!!! Such a Brave Soul
Oh gee a lifetime politician (aka con artist) talking to a Doctor. This is going to be super honest & productive
Doctor does not say why. He says "probably". The nurses were all dumb. Why? As Javid says they rely on the experts, fortunately. I do not want a family member of mine going into hospital with an unvaccinated doctor or anyone else who is not vaccinated. How difficult is it to have the vaccines? How difficult is it to wash your hands, stay 2 meters apart and to wear a mask. He is trying to say something he knows nothing about. Boosters every month? Possibly but probably not. I have to take medicine every day. Wow that's difficult. I had to inject my cat with insulin twice a day for 10 years. She was an angel and never a problem. Wow not at all difficult. That doctor has a choice. Get the jab or stay away. He is free to choose but not free to endanger others.
They blatantly do not listen to. Anyone except their experts. Governor General is fully vaccinated plus booster but still has virus.
Kings college statement at the end 90% of staff have the jab meaning most who have take 2 jabs or less are leaving hense the huge staff shortages nhs has thanks to the tories party
Hats off Doctor‼️🥇🏆
Guys got a Fucken set of balls good on the bloke
God bless and protect this brave doctor. Health Sec is captured imo.
Respect for this dr. Nurses are lip tied. Dr unvaccinated is still working that's the way it should be. Make your own choice and live with it.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Dr is spot on
Who da fook dis guy. Looks sick already.
Something tells me that all the vaccine experts....except one....don't have their hand in the piggy bank. So, why should ANYONE listen to a "vaccine expert"?
Holy smokes!
100% of experts agree with the people paying them
Ask Sajid Javid how much money he gets from the WEF.
Based
Looks like the politician wasn’t interested in the science
its about control!!! not about the vax
A Ex banker who can't articulate what his supposed expert's say because he either doesn't understand it so can't speak to it or he knows their looking at the same data and coming to a ludicrous position which is undefendable. This guy trys debating with a doctor 😂😂  Sky actually reporting such things? I'm shocked. Are they feeling which way the winds blowing.
April 2022 it will be a legal requirement for all NHS staff to be double jabbed by that month.
Fair enough . He's had the virus. But with same logic he then should never get the flu jab.
He’s so correct about the boosters . One size is not best for all. They are not obviously working are they ?
Genius
Think this is what we call being put in your place. Almost as if Javid doesn’t belong.
God be with the NHS doctor.
How can he take the advice of vaccine experts when they cannot say the disastrous side effects of these shots, they are not real vaccines because they did not go through years and years of trials?? They have not. It’s the same rubbish in USA
People like the Health Secretary bullsh!t their way into their jobs while being yes man to everything that is asked of them…No planning or common sense, just yes boss…unfortunately his boss is just as stupid and they all look  stupid…he can’t have a conversation with that doctor…so sad people like that rule the world…good job for being brave doctor!!!
A doctor who talks sense. Total respect
How the hell is this guys our Health Secretary.
He speaks for all the unvaccinated!
Dr Robert Malone, the inventor of the mRNA system is alerting the world but this Health Secretary has not noticed!
What an amazing doctor I hope more have courage like him !!
This dr is a hero ...
Wake up Australia.  The tyranny is in your face!! We know natural anti-bodies work.  This is NOT about health and maybe doctors know because they are doctors!!!
Something not right here...Sky loves the vaccines why would they show this rather than demonise the doctor?
🤣 how the hell did that happen? wasn't rehearsed was it?
Wow.... Imagine your a real doctor on a youtube video being cringy and refusing to get vaxxed.
I would love this doctor to start a patreon or something. I would definitely donate part of my salary to keep him afloat !
https://youtube.com/watch?v=da3IObmX8t4&feature=share shers
It was bad how he talked down to the doctor.The doctor was trying to explain we r screwed and the Health secretary has no answer how to get us out of this mess.Obviously the doctor is right but I'm not going to lie I've have gotten 4 jabs so far(two sinovac jabs in Pakistan and 2 Pfizer jabs in USA).I don't understand why we don't just mandate everyone mask in public and all stores and eateries keep windows open.We are going to have figure something else besides boosters every month or two this is getting retarded.I have no respect for how the Secretary Of Health dealt with this doctors question.I get he don't know but have an open discussion instead of talking down to the doctor.I will say this everyone needs to look into nasal sprays like Xlear which u can purchase at walgreens or targetor online to stop the spread of covid and other viruses.I have been using it everytime I go into a store or eating place and when I come out.I have been lucky and not caught covid thanks G>D!
Good for him for standing up. People should be respected with what they want to do with their own body. Period.
At no point is it anyone else’s decision is I tell me what risks are acceptable or NOT?  These vaccines are NOT acceptable to me so I decline wholeheartedly
God Bless this honest Dr. most of us know NOT to inject snake venom...so many dont..and they are suffering.
Staged…more theatrics from the msm
I think UK hospitals will lose tons of doctors if the bloody vaccine is mandatory, is not possible a wise man who works and see covid everyday to accept this lie
I don’t see the point he’s making. He’s not going to get the vaccine because he can’t be boosted every month?
Health secretary? Public servant!
Note to all the antivaxers, he’s not on your side. What’s he’s saying is that due to the short life of the vaccine’s effective protection (although quite effective) it isn’t worth it to vaccinate every doctor in the hospital every month when natural immunity has a similar effect. If the vaccines lasted longer, he would likely advocate for them. However the statistics generally show that for the 6 month period following a mass vaccination, the number of fatal and new cases does lower. He has a separate interview where he urges the public to get it- he’s talking about hospital staff.
Now it’s time to PROTECT THE NHS from its own government his could they do that !!! Come on everyone we got to fight this 💪
From the people who are "vaccine experts" aka, pharma salesmen.
Again the fakeness at last with a disclaimer.
They want to completely destroy the NHS, then sell up private health care.
90 % hmmm
They are so afraid of losing their jobs!
Oh my gosh listen to the actual doctor,we have all been duped & brainwashed by sage and the companies asking their profits in,at least I can end my days knowing I was not a sheep going to get the vaccine 😆😆🥰🥰
The Hippocratic oath?
This is the 1st time I've seen 2 apposing views in this subject and it's quite easy to see what would happen if there was a fair debate on TV... wouldn't be good for the government at all coz most of the so called science is utter nonsense just like the reasoning behind stupid protocols that restaurants and pubs follow ... 🤦‍♂️
He’s not a sheep
Well done that doctor for speaking up. First bit of sense sky news has shown in years 🤣
Although he is 100% correct, they will not care. This whole mess has NOTHING to do with a virus. It is about tyranny and grabbing power.
I won't either weather I have natural  antibody or not. Luckily I have after I got infected
Good on him telling the truth. Javid listen.
He came from nowhere like an lion to protect his gang, while the nurses didn't know what to say.
The doctor telling the true
The guy in the white shirt is a minion! Oh the drama "we take the best advise we can*. 😷👿👹
Good for him!! Natural immunity!!
Masks don't work lol!!
We can replace MPs anytime. They have no worthwhile skill to offer us. Unlike a Medical Consultants, Nurses, Care Workers or others like them in our society.
Fire him
Good on this guy for raising the points a great deal of us have!
Follow the MONEY
finally.. and if someone would just say why is everyone waking around with mask still when thats still not changing anything.
Big salute and respect to the Doctor . this shameless business must be stop freedom is what we want not control.
"That's your view." Now let's ask the less qualified staff. Silence.
Brave
Most humans have a 97% natural immune system that's a fact so what's really going on.or more to the point what are they really pumping into most of the world 😠 madness
"The reporter knows more than the doctor." The world is upside down.
Is anyone enjoying the new world order ?
Love this doc’s style. So clear. So clam. The other dude is running.
Doctor should be fired, he's a moron
Only thing is that it's not actually a vaccine, just another form of the flu jab. Vaccines are preventive, this is just an immunity booster.
Sky News doing news 👏
I do not believe the 90%. Instead a 30% perhaps.
An actual NHS doctor who knows about the viruses tell a stupid politician that the vaccinations don't work properly and to catch it and develop antibodies is the best option  and still the little pleb doesn't listen... Massive con this pandemic.
Not all heroes wear capes
Im in absolute AWE of this doctor! Who is he? He needs recognition! Not all heroes wear capes! Wow what a fresh if breath air to hear the other side of this covid narrative!! Salute to this doctor!
Well done, that man. I guess the nurses just want to keep their jobs. And then Sajid says: "we take advice from people who are experts". So that means this doctor is not an "expert"?
A politician commited to the big pharmas and a dr. Committed to human beings. Is not difficult for me which one choose to follow.
Bravo NHS doctor
Based
*BS‼️* Vaccine immunity is stronger than natural one, that BTW does not exist to Omicron❗
How much is Javid being paid by big pharma and the globalists to push the PLANdemic?
Good for him ... this is allabout force ..control...and money... I all think k we know what's going wrong ..or on here...
Notice  he said  experts. There's no such thing as an expert unless your Jesus Christ
Imagine this world where we are willing to sack great employees for refusing a EU drug.
I’ll die before I get the vaccine. Plain and simple. Heaven is where I would rather be in this exact second anyway. John 3:16!
I like this guy , I would trust what he tells me , absolute legend for saying what he believes but I get he got sacked for this
That's your view...  HES A DOCTOR FFS.  Who's view should we be listening to on medical issues?  A DOCTOR who actually sees patients on a daily basis?  Or some arrogant politician?
“We take advice from the people that are vaccine experts.” The world has gone stupid.
It would have been nice to know what the doctor's reservations are on getting vaccinated.  We certainly know that outcomes for long covid and severe outcomes on natural infection are far more of a burden on the health care system (that he is a part of) than reactions to vaccination.  The hospitals are not over-run with patients with vaccine side effects or vaccinated patients presenting with severe covid.  It is the unvaccinated and immunocompromised vaccinated that overwhelmingly burden the health care systems.  I also find it odd the doctor cherry picks the fact that there is waning immunity with antibodies for the vaccine but not for natural infection.  He also states that he had covid 'at some point' as if he didn't know exactly when it was.  Is he indicating that it was asymptomatic and only knew he had covid because at some point his blood was tested for antibodies? If that is the case, asymptomatic covid infection has been proven to provide far less protection than a more severe covid in terms of antibody response.
I can’t believe this another doctor who’s a friend of mine said the exact same thing the government are such a joke it’s unreal 😂😂😂
Guarntee his jobs gone
The advice we are given is to talk to our doctor. Why doesn’t the government listen to the doctors that are treating patients with covid.
Everyone let’s raise there awareness of the doctor and nurses in this video by hitting the like button so everyone gets to see this
Ahh man when Humpty Dumpty said ‘that’s just your opinion’ I really hoped the doctor would say, ‘and it’s a more qualified opinion than yours’…. missed opportunity
I salute this Dr’s bravery 👏
That journalists is a condescending little beta passive-aggressive dirt-bag. He talks like he's an expert just because he heard the "official" point of view and this well-spoken physician dared to oppose it. I hate biased journalists.
This doctor deserves to lose his job
We dont listen to Dr.s only the experts🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤔😑
Sounds like that doctor is being very logical, reasonable and measured in his response. And he's a doctor dealing with the problem first hand! Politicians need to get out of the way and stop fuckin this stuff up.
AMEN.....FINALLY, A DOCTOR TELLING THE TRUTH NOT ENOUGH RESEARCH DONE ....THESE SHOTS ONLY WORK FOR SO LONG
In my view the health Secretary is like the modern day Adolf Eichmann .  Also it's my view the doctor is a Brave man and the whole world needs to get behind him and his colleagues
Surprised the comments aren't turned off. Hopefully, I didn't jinx myself
Well said doctor! I've had also covid in May 2021 and since then I keep testing negative with antigen and PCR tests, still not vaccinated, covering the absenteeism of colleagues all double or even triple jabbed under their 40s with covid. A lot of them had covid before getting the vaccine and recovered quite well.
Well done doctor!!!
That's a sigma.
the nurses😂😂😂😂👌🏼👌🏼
... from the people that are vaccine experts. Yeah right. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sina lakusema mupo ☹
It is shameful how he tries to belittle him by saying "we'll take advice from vaccine experts" like the doctor doesnt know what he is talking about. Everyone who questions the official narrative, regardless of their qualifications is constantly undermined.   Also the doctor is just being polite and avoiding being confrontational when he says that he has the same level of immunity than jabbed people. He knows he is more protected and for a longer time.
Where the hell are the other doctors to join to their colleague against this dealth Minister which should be put in jail as soon as possible.
lol done him
If he's so aware of what the jab does, why does he have an objection to having it. Seems by his reasoning it would make no difference either way to him so why not get it just for others piece of mind
That doctor is nothing short of a hero
👏👏👏👏
This is against the principle of informed consent and sets a very bad precedent for the future. And I’m speaking as a virologist. The Doctor probably has better protection against Covid19 having had the infection than getting the vaccine. And he could lose his job over this? Madness!
This doctor represent the REAL SCIENCE  The media-doctors  and experts represent the Government
Dr = smart  Sajid Javid= not listening
Girls were so apprehensive to answer.
the best doctor that I've seen. Telling how it is. And Javid, as a "good" politician trying to keep pushing his narrative no matter what
Well said Doctor Steve James.
Bravo for this doctor...he is also expert in his field but like so.many experts these days...they are silenced by politians and experts paid by Phizer
SCIENCE DISREGARD WITH THE CELL MEMBRAIN...VACCINES MIGHT END UP TO A FULL ASYMPTOMATIC FOR A NOT 100% PROTECTION.
Very Brave man Good job
Well done Sky for showing this without fear or favour! More of this please!
He hasn’t got a clue, puppet master
He dismisses everything the doctor is saying  "We will take our advice from the vax experts" wtf, these being the vax manufacturers... The money this guy must be getting...
Well done matey!
Fair play to this Doctor. In years to come, this madness will be exposed
Now the wolves come knocking.
So his thinking is the Dr is less knowledgeable then the vaccine experts!  Well good luck when hospitals are empty as Drs nurses and all health care workers say Enough and walk off .
There is studies showing natural immunity is 60 % more affective.  Advice from vaccine experts?? Dr Malone the inventor of mrna is band on many platforms because he speaks out...i think that is defnitly the one guy we should give a voice. The banning of him told me..this is all wrong..somethings up..
What he is telling is that jab after jab after jab...because your body wont produce profer and natiral antibody...what your body will do is to wait for jabs.
Epic
so many people have or stand to lose their jobs in Australia here. It is beyond comprehension and so wrong...
Natural immunity is far stronger and has no side effects 🎉
their silence says it all, ! How dare he talk to these people like this they are the experts, this ICU doctor is the voice of reason, The vaccine mandate should be scrapped immediately
I pray for this man
Finally
Someone screenrecord this before it’s taken down
90% of a HOSPITAL's staff not having been vaccinated is not good enough. That's the same as the general population! Those 10% are infecting others and taking up hospital beds themselves because they are far more likely to become seriously ill! It must be made madatory for NHS workers and fines will have to be introduced for the general public. At this rate it will take all year for the 10% to get their first dose, which is crippling our health service and economy
Nobel Prize goes to this Guy.
His body. His choice.
Fair play to this doctor for speaking his mind and giving his opinion based on his knowledge, qualifications and experience, that his medical coworkers were clearly and obviously afraid to say to the secretary and on national news. When the governments on Britain, EU, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and so on sack doctors as medical advisors for not having the correct hive mind opinions that the government's wanted, this should have been a huge red flag for everyone.  The media and the media medical advisors did not do their job to pull at any of the obvious loose threads of the government's decision making or the vaccines. They just spewed out what ye governments said and the propaganda the governments told them to say. This should have been another red flag. When the media, social media cancels and silences two of the leading doctors who developed most of the mRNA vaccine technologies used in the covid vaccines, for speaking on the risks of mRNA vaccines. This should have been a red flag. When statisticians are silenced or sacked for raising issues with covid data not being validated, data not being cleansed and wording around data description etc. This should have been a red flag. When epidemiologist advisors to governments are sacked for not having the same hive mind opinions as the government or for pointing out the flawed logic to government action and mandates that have no valid base. This should have been a red flag. Again. Fair play to this doctor for speaking his mind and giving his opinion based on his knowledge, qualifications and experience, that his medical coworkers were clearly and obviously afraid to say to the minister and on national news.
He's a Consultant Anaesthetist, he's not a virologist or an epidemiologist, he's also ignorant,  anyway Sajid Javid did a terrible job defending the vaccine, the main function of the vaccine is to stop hospitalization and death, not transmission. Although it does slow down transmission as well by about 60% and it stops the infection by about 40% . The antibody levels drop after about 2 months but Memory T cells are still there and ready to kick in if needed.
Truth speaker ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Who the experts the one selling the drug is he listening to him self
Complete stupidity, people are getting covid 3 weeks apart, it's highly reinfectious.
Natural immunity is 1 million times better than this experimental medication
At least in UK he still has choice..in Canada Drs not vaxed put on unpaid leave..also after a clip like this in the medical association might investigate & cancel his licence as has happened to thos Docs "spreading dangerous misinformation"
nurses aren't allowed an opinion whilst at work, sad truth of the profession.
#jabborisfrthistime
#jabjavidnow
This doctor is my hero ❤🙏❤🙏❤🙏
and what about doctors who want vaccination?
Well said doc.
The NHS is absolute garbage
So for 2 years no public debate or opinion and suddenly this? Staged for sure
"We take advice from our vaccine experts at Pfizer"
A great man of integrity telling the Government to get stuffed✅✅
Disgusting that a doctor won't get vaccinated.
Lets wait till zombies show up then its was the boosters that did it
It sounds like getting omicron is a good alternative to getting jabbed.
This doctor is straight up lying lmao. There is STRONG evidence that a booster protects against omicron for 10 weeks, not 4 weeks.
The doctor was very brave, but I wonder did they edit this because surely he would have mentioned the onslaught of undeniable side effects that medical staff have been seeing. Any medical staff that say they don't see a negative increase of various disease, death and disabilities in certain people are liers.
It's like these *MPs cower away at any sense that is spoken to them 😅
Where's the full clip.
Respect ✊🏻
There’s one doctor I can respect.
Very brave of this man to say how he feels✨
Honestly, that means he shouldn't be in his job. Sack him.
Well done Doctor
Bravo now THATS COURAGE..
eye-opener. hats off to that anaesthetist!
People are slowly starting to realize that the vaccine really isn't working... At least not anymore.
We have the health secretary arguing with a licensed dr🤦 this is how scientific and based in "medicine" this propaganda is 🤦
I don't believe that 90 % have taken a vaccine .that is a lie I'm sure
1st class wangers! Charlatans these politicians. In their face ha
Evidence that it's got absolutely no basis in science It's all ideaological cult crap
If that doctor goes missing in a few weeks we know why 😶😶😶😶😜😜
I would pay more attention if he was a consultant immunologist. This anaesthetist is entitled to his opinion, but government health advice is developed by immunologists, public health physicians, and epidemiologists; who collectively, have vastly more expertise in the area than he does.
Truth will out....These politicians are now despicable tyrannical enforcers of pharmaceutical interests..It's all about the money..So many jabs ..so many billionaires.
Good honest doctors 👍👍👍 That politician  should get out ...from that  hospital ..they don't want him or any politicians in there.  They are using the NHS for political points scoring and for turning the NHS as police services protecting the government......  That politician has no clue about  vaccines and the virus or simply pretending he has no clue....  That  doctor just explained the real fact about covid and vaccines....He definitely SURPRISED the politician who probably thought that his presence there will make  the NHS staff happy and say yes to vaccines...He had a shock.. It is a reminder that we are in the UK 🇬🇧 Freedom and human rights.  That politicians didn't like what he heard. He probably couldn't bealive his authority was useless in front of those highley educated doctors....  Then he still wanted to have the last word by saying "will see what the expert says"     He should be in that Job if he can't even see the fact that covid is 99.6% mild. globally before any vaccines or drugs... He can't even see the fact vaccines don't stop the virus from infecting people in most cases and statistics are there... But the politician continued to be  arrogant not accepting the fact that  natural immunity is far greater than any vaccine and it could be life long lasting immunity..Just like those people who recoverd from sars1 some 18years ago they still have immunity for sars1 and even for sars2 which isn't exactly. T cells memory and cross immunity... He should  resign and not to forget the way he changed his stand on covid. When he was pointed in his new post. He said" People should stop panicking about covid" then he was attacked by the media and the Labour party ..then he converted to covid extremist the next day and apologised....So he is now covid vaccines loyalist like many other politicians including the opposition..They are  all pro a life long global mass vaccination program even if the world population is naturally IMMUNED... They are very dangerous people.  He also said ." Care home and social workers should find other jobs if not vaccinated "
Silence speaks volumes !
We going to bypass how condescending he was at the end 'From the people who are vaccine experts'
Wow what a rude man. The Mayor of London is not fit for purpose.
Hero
Fire Him because this clown WORDS people will die
Dr doctor in la la land  talking rubbish should no better
1984 Public Health Act: (1)Regulations under section 45B or 45C may not include provision requiring a person to undergo medical treatment. (2)“ Medical treatment ” includes vaccination and other prophylactic treatment. ]   Any form of coercion to take an experimental procedure is illegal - and the MSM stayed silent
Massive respect for that doctor 👏 🙌
As long as he wears a mask and submits to Covid tests I think it's okay.
The moral of the video : never argue with a stupid politician
If the tyres are puctured no amount of pumping air will fix it the vaccines can't stop people catching the viruet's live with this end
Who is this morone? (sorry, I'm from Germany and do not know the Great Cats in - Australia?) - : "... we'll take the best advice ... from the vaccine experts ...", this morone doesn't recognize an experts when one is standing in front of him (because this one doesn't wear a gov'mental sign saying "EXPERT")
In your face !!! 👏👏👏👏👏
This doctor is amazing ! Respect
Nobody is a expert I don't care what people say. It's arrogant. God is the only expert and perfect. Sorry for who don't believe in God. I pray for all of the lost. God bless everyone.
priceless
The vaccine doesn't work. Wake up Australia. I live in Vermont which is the most vaccinated state in America. Our numbers are literally 10 times that before anyone was vaccinated.
1:55 those “vaccine experts “ being who? The big pharma who are making billions out of this?! I don’t think they have any interest in making a vaccine that is actually working coz it’s all about profit now, boosters every few months = cash forever 💵💵💵💵💵
im not jabbed and it wil never happen!
Lol this is one doctor who doesn’t want to get vaccinated out of tens of thousands who advocate for it and all the commentators are immediately latching onto him.  Confirmation bias and totally lame- go back to your Facebook bubbles of friends who echo your sentiments.
Sajid jabhead didn’t know where to look
I agree with the Dr
And why don’t we fill the care homes with unvaccinated staff while we’re at it? If I go into hospital I do not want treating by people who put their principles before my safety.  THEY ARE IN THE WRONG JOB.
Vaccine experts are corrupted people in government. Dr. Robert Malone is an expert on vaccines and got banned from twitter and LinkedIn
Epic. A bloke that stands his ground his body his rules end of I salute u sir never backing down welldone
Health Secretary??? Stealth lie and genocide secretary .lock him up . Arrest him for stupidity treason and genocide. I wish I could get interviewed by him .he is so so annoying and pathetic.
Good Doctor! Smarter than the average bear!
Divide e impera! People are scared to speak.
Waht a braveheart men,well done!!!!!
I won't be getting jabbed and neither will my family... we ain't "vulnerable" to covid!!
The jabbers are saying they wont get jabbed 😂😂
90% of staff haven't  a clue because all the scaremongering. Coward controlling your a disgrace to us
Fair play to him 🙌👏
This guy is a joke of a Doctor. I've never caught covid and can't afford to catch it due to a weak immune system so people like me need the vaccine to help get those antibodies.
Should kick this doctor out of the hospital. There are several examples where people disagreed and later on were on the news that they died of covid. Good luck doc
Funny is when they talk about the "Experts" advising them, it is another politician with pockets being filled with money from big corps!!! Sorry, it is not an expert's advise in my opinion
People have rights,no one have the right to force medication on anyone
The doctor is giving the very best advice to wally
The nurses are so scared because they know they will get blacklisted
If we had a proper lick down from the start when people were worried and scared, we could of eradicated the virus. Now, it's going to be with us forever. The nurse is right, vaccines won't help rid of this virus
Who has more expertise? The Dr. on the front lines or the CEO of Pfizer? Just stop with the BIG LIE!
His sleeves rolled up ,,hilarious
Thanks for speaking out....
Well done!
Only Skynews published this. Funny..
Good for him. It’s so sad people are so obsessed with telling people to get vaxxed. Look how scared these women are to answer the question
All this guy does is explain that vaccines are not a perfect solution.  He still does nothing to explain why he himself has decided not to be vaccinated
Well done on that doctor for speaking up! We need more like him! Enough is enough. This all needs to end.
Just stop with the phoney jab. Obviously they guy in the white shirt & dumb mask works for the BIG LIE. I wonder how much he has been paid by the Pharmacudical companies. Just like all of the bribed Aussie PM's -THIS IS TOTAL B.S.!
Salute the doctor
Make this man prime minister!!!!!!!
Do NHS workers also need to have mandatory flu jabs?
Javid doesn’t know what he’s doing.  He’s a banker, remember that.  It would be like a ballet teacher becoming the England National Football Team Manager.
Hero!!! And he's right!
A medical professional speaking the truth wow what a man stepping up to the situation!
"We take the advise from the vacine experts" he says as a frontline doctor and expert stands infront of him and tells him why the science doesnt add up. They he dismisses him because his logic is showing his policy is flawed. ?????????
Well done that man, we need more like him to stand up to this tyranny
It's absolutely pathetic how the Tories are resting their entire Covid strategy around boosters. As if it'll actually make one iota difference in the long term
"We will the the best advice we can from the people that are vaccine experts" Ain't the vaccine experts now working for big pharma to push boost shots? Why is no politician talking about eradicating the virus completely but still containment after 2years?
These aren’t “views”. It’s called science.
He is 10000 % right and people are refusing to Listen
I had my first 2 doses and I'm disappointed in myself for getting them, I thought they'd be mandatory for indoor venues 😔 no way I'm having the booster or any of the further boosters which will no doubt be twice yearly forever now 🙄
Health Secretary getting owned - what a be11 end he is...dismissing a man in scrubs opinion -  smh. How bad does the health secretary look....
respect
That Anaesthetist is toast and will be disciplined soon. I bet his bosses are furious with him.
I work for the nhs and I'd didn't want the jab but I ended up getting pressured into it, still haven't had my boost and still not going to have it
He is the real hero.
What a hero
Well done to the Dr I know who I'd rather take advise from that little cretin needs to resign like the rest of the corrupt lot all in it to line there own pockets
Check out Dr. McCullough's other in depth interview here https://youtu.be/IJiKsbzlW4s and Dr. Robert Malone https://youtu.be/28xqpV6cmcU
Love to see a politicians replying to healthcare people working in the front line
It is now a pandemic of the "vaccinated". FACT.
1:53 "We take the best advice that we can, from the people that are VACCINE EXPERTS..." He is a journalist talking to someone with a master/phd in medicine, working in a hospital at the front rows of the pandemic...
Really? Is this the health secretary? He seems illiterate on the subject
First they prize the nurses as heros now they fire them !!!!!! strange !!
Reset mob. Watch them.
.... and then a hero comes along...with the strength to carry on.... Did anyone else suddenly hear Mariah Carey burst into song when the Dr started speaking? We applaud your courage and strength sir! Bravo!!!
Those nurses looked so uncomfortable and it's clear they didn't want the vaccine either or they would have answered him instead of staying silent or nervously laughing.
Well said mr doctor put him in his place ... im suprised this hss been let out for the public to watch 🤔
Brave doc for speaking out
While I think there would have been an argument for this at one point, I agree with the doctor - omicron has removed all sensible arguments for this imo.   The world does also need to accept: 1) we can’t stop people getting covid forever  2) natural infection as a protection against severe disease is pretty much as good as 2 vaccines  We’re in a new phase of the pandemic now - endemic. We need sensible discussions about what that will mean to us going forward.   Ps I’m not anti vax. I’ve had two, but I see no point in having a third as everyone will be exposed to omicron anyway and I’m happy with my level of risk after 2.
what about presonal autonomy of ones sovereign being and the right to choose,It should always be about consent,,,INFORMED consent and not about that freedom being taken away to force a rushed through, unproven, potentially lethal substance into peoples bodies
We will take advice from people who are vaccine experts...and who are as well economy experts politic experts, all in one
Health Minista... do u have any bullocks left sir ? ... "I'll check with the experts" ... ur in a fukking hospital mate
Well done to the Dr for speaking up Javid wanted everyone to agree with him, when all the Dr and Nurses leave people might wake up they have worked when there was no vaccines everyone should have a choice its their body with all the side affects which is kept quite how dare they suggest mandatory vaccines.
Tell people wtf is going on in Telford,
No doubt he will lose his job because of his views , the health secretary wasn’t really listening to him
Could this be a sign we are beginning to escape the utter madness of the last 2 years?
Whoau vaccin Not god
And there we have it folks, the tide starts to turn.... 👍👍
Why is Sky broadcasting this? How does it further the agenda?
only 10% in every state are more clever. that makes sense. 90% stupid and weak.
Well done Doctor 👏
if the transmission he has is the same than someone who has gotten vaccinated and they didnt have to go thru covid... why not got vaccinated and not have covid instead? this guy omg
Insecure angry little man
Well done doctor for speaking your view and taking a stand!
He didn't expect that but he's right the fact the government's around the world are pushing it when the vaccine literally does nothing says everything roughly about 70 ppl work at my place about 60 have had the vaccine yet most have caught covid multiple times but I don't run to the doctor's for every little sniffle the fact the government's propaganda machine the sun have kept this post up really surprises me let's see if they take this comment down like they have with most put up they don't agree with
wow... is this REAL news from Sky?
Well done to this doctor for standing up for himself and others in his position!!! Vaccine experts more like pharma sales reps. This doctor is no fool
Jabid showed himself as a total fool🤣👌🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Won't be in a job by tomorrow.
It’s sad that it needs a Consultant (whose higher position gives him some job safety) to be able to voice what the others are thinking, but are too afraid to say, because they don’t want to get dismissed for just saying it.     This minister shouldn’t even have asked this question in front of the cameras, but off record; what’s worse when he didn’t get the answer that he wanted, he tried to brush off the valid argument the Consultant raised as it didn’t match the response he was aiming for.    We don’t force people to have the annual Flu shot, even though its intended outcome is the same as the boosters for C., that are being pushed on us now.  We don’t make people stay at home if they have the Flu, yet the complications from the many variations that fall under this umbrella can result in widespread infection, hospitalisation or worse.  We shouldn’t be holding people hostage - using their jobs/social life as collateral - to force a desired outcome; it’s every individual’s human right to decide for themselves.   I’m vaccinated, but understand why people choose not to be, even when their decisions may impact upon me or others.    Ultimately if we force this particular decision upon the population as a whole, what is the next thing we are going to be forcing people to do? And where does it stop?
Where was this thinking in the last two year? We need a full investigation.
So much respect for this doctor!!! Telling a member of parliament how it is hopefully it’ll end now!!!
So when are we striking against this law then? Notice the unions not getting involved. All brought and paid for, should be ashamed.
The bald guy is a complete vaxx douche, not the least bit interested in the Doctor's logic or predicament. Sad.
Did he really say he’s taking advice from vaccine expert? As in the people who are making the money from the vaccines?
I am actually extremely surprised all the comments are supporting him, not bashing him for having doubts like I usually see. Thank god.
Can I just ask, why don’t they want to take the vaccination? Do they believe they’re bad for us or they’re just not effective? No judgement just genuinely so curious as to why health professionals reject the vaccination.
"From the people who are vaccine experts"  Wow. Instantly trying to discredit a doctor who has worked the entire time treating patients.
Shame for him.
courage...... vs a bunch of pussies
Well done to the doctor, I fully support him!!!
They are afraid to speak out) sad
I really hope he is not going to lose his job because today people are not allowed to have a different point of view!
Absolute legend!
Biden, cdc, and fda are literally committing genocide on the American people
hope he is ok
Medical license revoked
What a moron the Minister is.
The body language of the nurses says it all, well done Dr. for protecting your staff from a sensitive question
Respect this 👨. Wake up people
Bravo 👏
Their reaction say it all. Fair play to that doc!! Hero
Hero! ❤️
Commie Brits will erase this.
Most of hospital staff around the world are refusing the vaccine,makes one wonder
I can’t be bothered anymore booster jab here next month new variant now another booster jab then another variant etc
Health secretary doesn't know anything about health. Squirming to the max. This guy just the talking head getting told what to do. Useless trying to get through to him.
Roll on April when we get rid of all the selfish drs and nurses.
The Nuremberg Code (1947) Permissible Medical Experiments The great weight of the evidence before us to effect that certain types of medical experiments on human beings, when kept within reasonably well-defined bounds, conform to the ethics of the medical profession generally. The protagonists of the practice of human experimentation justify their views on the basis that such experiments yield results for the good of society that are unprocurable by other methods or means of study. All agree, however, that certain basic principles must be observed in order to satisfy moral, ethical and legal concepts: 1.	The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision. This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.  The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs, or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity. 2.	The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature. 3.	The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results justify the performance of the experiment. 4.	The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury. 5.	No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects. 6.	The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment. 7.	Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability or death. 8.	The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment. 9.	During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible. 10.	During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill and careful judgment required of him, that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.
Doubt this doctor will see this, but he needs to know he speaks thousands of us. He is a breath of fresh air and hope in times of madness. God bless him.
There is NO public debate at all. All dissenters are silenced by a compliant media.  Bravo to this doctor for speaking up.  The nurses are simply scared to death of losing their jobs because they are regarded as disposable by the NHS.
A dr who runs a private breathlessness clinic against vaccination wonder what his motive would be 🙄
“Get the jab or off with your head!” —Antichrist
The silence from the nurses speaks a thousand words .
Legend!
‘The science isn’t strong enough’ but then proceeds to talk about his scientific opinion.   He’s an anaesthetist, not virologist. He would know the basics at best.
Fair play to that doctor at least he same some sense not like the rest of the sheep
I remember standing outside my house and clapping for the NHS now we are forcing them out of a job to protect the vaccinated. Madness.
Could everyone who agree with the doctor and/or thinks jabs should not be mandatory for NHS workers (nor anyone else) please come to the next rally in London on the 22nd of January? Unless millions show up supporting us, nothing will change - apart from having even longer NHS waiting times.
I’ve had 2 jabs now. Don’t know about the others…
Somebody who knows whata goin on tellin someone who thinks he knows whats going on
I agree with doctor
SO happy we are finally seeing some FAIR media coverage on this issue. It's disgusting that after all the amazing hard work and effort NHS staff have put in over the pandemic that our government are then going to force them into having a vaccination that they do not want and that doesn't seem to make a difference in a lot of cases. Well done on this brave doctor for standing up and giving a voice to the millions who disagree about these vaccine mandates.
Respect to the Dr.  Typical political bollocks from the politician.
Of course he's going to disagree he's being paid to tell people to the get vacancies
He probably feel that way because he is exposed so often...like he said.
icu nurse here from the netherlands, also not vaccinated
Interesting to hear that there are no arguments from anyone else..only that they are taking advice from the best ones there is. Vaccine experts. Would perhaps be more convincing if there were some real arguments.
WHAT HAPPENED TO REGULAR FLU AND WHY IS NO ONE ASKING????
Well done this doctor.  And No-vax Djocavic.  And children's author Julia Donaldson against masks in schools.
Maybe this backfired on said,...Possibly he was trying to make a point with the nurses to get boosted and their silence made the doctor answer to defend them as he did, And sky were just honest for a change and published it.
Disgusting how a Dr can stand there and say he's not getting vaxinated should fired him on the spot
Description of this video is wrong... He did not say he "...will not get vaccinated" he said "I have not been vaccinated, I don't WANT to be vaccinated" he also said this within the context of a reasoned point that he has antibodies.
That doctor knows his stuff and that's why doctors get paid a lot of money 👍👌
Vaccine experts,    ie  Bill gates .
Huge respect for young doctor,  he definitely managed to put Javid off balance with speaking the truth. Well done sky not hiding it under carpet
Firm handshake to this doctor 🤝🏻  Facts win👍🏻
If 90% have already had the vaccine, what's the issue?
"....vaccine experts"
No surprise the nurses are silent, they just do as their told, that's why I don't listen to them, they're useless.
Bravo, Doctor! Humans of all countries, united!
These doctors have years of experience working with patients who come in with some of the most contagious diseases and yet those patients were cared for by these doctors without any kind of vaccines available. If these doctors are sacked then who is going to replace them. Possibly trainee doctors.  Also these doctors and nurses are needed to care for patients. What is Sajid Javed doing wasting their precious time? I don't want to ever end up in hospital but if I do I can't imagine what would happen if I couldn't get treated because my doctor was having to wait In a queue  to get his monthly jab.
This has made my year already  Look at the daggers off of his  boss
Big respect to the doctor 👊🏻 power to the people ✌️✌️✌️ The government is falling and there house if cards is crashing, about time. FairPlay to Sky news for airing this.
Then he is risky virus reservoir candidate so he should be removed in the best interest of the citizens
It's all staged. For what reason!!?
Mass Formation Pyschosis
Vacine hotnot wil almal net laat spuit fokken idioot.
The problem its not COVID. It's the media breathing down your neck while still make difficult decisions. Tell the media to keep their mouth shut so that people can talk on an even level without  their lives being ruined by the wrong sentence
Common sense Dr
Jabbid: quick ask someone else.  This guy knows what he’s talking about…
Typical sheep response, "we take the best advice we can get." without doing any critical thinking for themselves. Of course taking a booster every month is ridiculous and unsustainable.
so nice to see hear in the uk we didnt see the full chat
This is the first time I have given a "like" to a Sky News video.
SKY now has 1 more subsriber for publishing this.
“Vaccine experts”… like Pfizer
Well done Dr 👏
Hypertensive people taking antihypertensive drug every day, some serious diabetic patient need the insulin injection every day, these are called practical benefits.
He is absolutely correct in saying that the vaccines would have to given every 2 months...it is not an option.
Hero
Well said
Health Secretary is a criminal
Absolutely appalling that this doctor refuses to be vaccinated. Where did he get his medical degree from? Clearly his knowledge of virology is lacking.
Well done 👍👍👍
“We take our advice from vaccine experts” (friends who have shares in big pharma)
https://youtu.be/7EYJjV9VJ5g
The politicians wear masks on camera and then party the hell out of their lifes afterwards
I find it amazing that the NHS personnel must get vaccinated but the private sector do not. Also - those experts whose advice this muppet is taking have not been able to provide a single solution or reasonable measure in 2 years, so I am sure they will get it right this time.
I do wish they’d explain exactly why that doctor is opposed to vaccination; apparently he told the BBC that the decision whether to get vaccinated is a “personal choice” but I’d be interested to know why his personal choice is to forego vaccination. We can speculate, of course, but it would be interesting to hear him explain his decision fully.
Crazy.
Total disgrace, Sajid should name those 'vaccine experts'.
👍👍👍👍👍
I am responsible for myself not my neighbor
Brave man 🙌
Who the hell, is a ridiculous MP that knows nothing, about health care preaching to a consultant anesthetist and willing to sack him over a pretend virus, we all know that they want to privatise the NHS, sajid has information bonkers MR whitty     well says it all    disgusting govt !!!!
Coercion, in the purest sense, is that which includes forced compliance through physical domination. Coercive-persuasion ranges from threats of violence … to unspoken potential for punishing and rewarding. … Persuasion, in the purest sense, is gaining the compliance of one who is completely free to comply or not to comply with the persuasive message. Thus, persuasion uses argument to compel power to give way to reason while coercion uses force to compel reason to give way to power. W. F. STRONG, et. al., Persuasion: Strategies For Public Influence, 1996.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻✌️🌍✌️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
It is easy for them to put pressure on the orientation of nurses
Shared this with EVERYBODY. Let this spread like wildfire!
Give this Doctor a medal
He is a nurse not a doctor
Well done doctor
Vaccine expert doesn't mean medical expert!
This was on msm news? Something's up.
A politician is...trained in the art of inexactitude. His words tend to be blunt or rounded, because if they have a cutting edge they may later return to wound him. EDWARD R. MURROW (1908-1965), Speech, 19 October 1959
Idiotic /Ignorant Dr, How did he get the job@ the Hospital?
Okay well done to the brave Doctor who spoken out his feelings and opinion.  Now someone tell me what on earth are we supposed to believe the people in front line or people in House of Parliament
HOW DARE HE!
Notice senior management behind Javid.I wonder what camp he supports.
. Bait and switch – a method by which the gullible are led to believe one thing; or are offered one product; or are offered an inducement; but sadly are shorn like so many sheep when expectations and reality diverge. DOMINIC W. MOREO, Games of Persuasion, 2000
he explained it perfectly that this booster mandate BUSINESS is nonsense, it has nothing to do with science and everything to do with vaccine business
They take advice from “the vaccine experts”... the same people who became billionaires over the last couple of years. Let’s keep that in mind. It’s a business. Businesses have money as their top priority, not people, otherwise they wouldn’t be businesses, they’d be missionaries or not-for-profit.
Where have all the many patients gone?
If he's only taking advice from V experts then why ask the nurses at all?
Awesome
Good on the lad
Very sad that medical workers (who have more knowledge and experience) are being silenced and being fired for not being lab rats. Doctors are loosing licenses because they have their own opinions. Just wtf
Anti Vaxed sperm is the next Gold
Brilliantly put.
"Nearly 90% of staff have already done so"   So even if half of the remaining 10+% chicken out last minute, that's still 5% of highly trained staff lost because of this ridiculous mandate. The economic cost is ENORMOUS.
No sick pay if he catches it in my opinion
Vaccines teach your body to react to a virus, that in turn produces antibodies DURING & AFTER an infection, they're not ment to be constantly circulating in your body. Both men are correct in thier own ways but I'm glad the doctor had the balls to speak his own opinions.
If we don’t hear from him or people from there don’t see him no more we all no why😂😂😂😂
I hope when they all leave the NHS collapses and they can see how stupid they have been! The evidence is clear vaccination doesn't stop transmission.
Hats off to this man 👏
So if the country's health secretary is not listening to the country's professional doctors, then who are people he is taking medical advice from..? 🤔
He is an anaesthetist. Epidemiologists and virologists are the ones to speak to. They understand the evidence in much more detail.
Evidence people can be clever in one way and stupid in another, what the doctor (all respect to his hard work) said can't be extended to 8 billion + people on planet earth.... Sajid made more sense to me - he's taking his guidance from vaccine experts, the doctor, who is not a vaccine expert, is giving his opinion
This doctor is a legend, brilliant,  100% common sense 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Brave NHS doctor 🙏💚 We need more people like him to bring up the truth….and based on scientific facts. The whole story is pure madness!
I don't think this mandate will go ahead now. The government is playing chicken . If I was an NHS worker, I'd call their bluff.
Protect that nurse/doctor . He is a legend.
Well done to this doctor! Albeit, I don't agree with his assumption about the 8 weeks, as vax don't stop the so-called covid spreading!  The rest he makes excellent points which can't be answered!
Wow
Don't go down in the comments my friends, the anti-vaxxers are busy sucking off each other in jubilation because they found a doctor who supported their views.
HE SHOULS NOT BE WORKING IN THE NHS IF HE IS PUTTING HIS PATIENTS AT RISK BY BEING A MORON AND NOT GETTING JABBED. FIRE THE DIMWIT.
and i don’t want any kin immigrant telling me i have to have one
The fact that the HEALTH SECRETARY can only respond with "we take the best advise as we can" is appalling. Covid has been around for a while now and i'm sure he's been in conversation with these 'experts' on a daily basis. Why can he not support his opinion better and give an evidence based answer back. I understand hes not a doctor, but surely he can hold a conversation regarding the subject.
https://youtu.be/hOlEYcd1nyI?t=59 "There will always be a debate about it" What feckin debate?! I was never asked about lockdown, mask wearing, shut down of businesses, medical apartheid, curfews, vaccine passports, mandatory vaccinations. The man is a complete liar, he is a Communist pretending to be a Conservative because he is being PAID big sums of money to look the other way! He,ll not be able to look away in a few years time because of his evil actions!
But how is he allowed his job still ???
There's absolutely no way on earth they will bring in this ridiculous policy.  There's literally zero evidence that vaccinated people spread COVID less than unvaccinated people.  Now that Omicron is the dominant strain, there's absolutely no justification for any of this, and there never was!  Boris needs to scrap this crazy policy immediately!
I love this guy! How brave of him and how calm he was, unlike the Jibbering Jabbit
And javid said me neither!!!!!!!!😉😉
💯 behind the NHS staff.
The manager is looking like he going to commit a murder. He's thinking keep your mouth shut son. This scademic make us big bucks and kills many people.
Jabid: We take our advice from V experts.  Who?  Top men,  ... Top men
Alas some actual common sense…… Pandemic of mental health
Those nurses are shameful Cowards I would have stood as a nurse side by side with him and given Javid a piece of my mind. I would have reminded him of total Informed Consent the outrage of a Government mandating its will upon Sovereignty and Bodily Autonomy.
Funny how the reporter got the last word
I Think its our hormones is fuckt up for older men!
🤐The Silence was louder‼️
Good on him
Well done that consultant 👏👏👏👏
Bravo to that Doctor bravo
Serius question what do the experts make money of?
Honestly can't believe sky have posted this ... 😳
He’s a chaval this secretary guy there’s no vaccine experts u idiot there can’t be experts in something that didn’t exist a year ago
Soon those doctors will treat the other health workers
They are taking advice not from doctor but from vaccine experts 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💯👍🤯😂😂😂😂
How we can convince ordinary people to got vaccinated, while a doctor evades to receive his jobs???
Surprised they allowed this on TV
Brave dr, well done
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 credit to the doctor for speaking up ... clearly see the nurses silent. Javid has not a clue and government don’t give a flying damn about our health.
This is all about money !!!!!
Vaccine experts 🤦‍♂️  my body is a expert in survival.
Well said by the doctor who is a professional medically trained person
Talk about undermining the effort to get this pandemic under control, to stop people getting too ill from covid.  To allow us to live with no restrictions and an open thriving economy. Yes we have to live with covid for years- but by having the vaccine jabs we can reduce its spread and its impact upon those who catch this virus. Reducing the impact on society and the NHS services that have enough to cope with, other than people dying from a virus everywhere.
Nurses look too scared to say anything and lose their jobs, that in itself is a telling story
Time for politicians to stay out of healthcare and listen to doctors
Based love it this man got balls
Professional reporting there. Let his own biased opinion completely intrude on the opinion of a trained professional in the field.
The Doctor has natural immunity, he doesn't need a vaccine. Natural immunity is more robust & superior to vaccine immunity. Ask yourself why our governments & public health institutions are not recognising natural immunity! This is about the implementation of digital ID's (Vaccine passports).
Such an arrogant Health Minister
Well done Doc
What a brave and courageous doctor!!! Making complete sense and isn’t it absolutely plain that HE IS AN EXPERT? That the silly man asking questions is already talking to an expert. I can’t even bring myself to type the name of the silly little man. Typical behaviour of npd. That the silly little man feels entitled to put a professional doctor/ expert in his place like this and has no shame or embarrassment.
Not very assuring if that’s the response from the Health secretary. Embarrassing if these peoples are meant to run the country and look after the public.  The doctor was absolutely right in saying there are many views, but he articulated in the best possible way. Can’t help but praised his intelligence in answering and making a strong case.   Very fine line here with mandatory vaccination as it could drive these good doctors and nurses away into another profession.
if that guy loses his job i'm going on a strike
I would never listen to Sajid the poisoner because he's a liar a Thief and part of a lying poisoning tory government. Nothing this Govt has done has any credibility.
Well done standing for yourself when your opinion is not flowing with current
Outrageous and stupid. That we are reduced to this. Well done Doctor.
What does the vaccine have inside that is so bad that people would rather not have it?
Bullshit!!!
He needs sacking. No messing, throw him out of his job. Make an example out of him.
He is a consultant and they only work for the health service part time as they are too busy coining it in private work (hence the crisis in the backlog of people waiting for consultations) !
He was there on call the entire time, and now they're laying him off?
but the doctor does not address the point that vaccinations continue to protect against serious illness. If everyone with covid was just left to deal with it and denied treatment in hospitals, it may well be a good plan to just allow omicron to spread as fast as possible, but the battle is to stop the NHS being overwhelmed with ill covid patients and the enemy is unvaccinated people.
Taking advise from the vaccine experts that are making billions of dollars. And silence the inventor of the MRNA vaccine Dr Malone for speaking up about his concerns regarding the vaccines and how it is being miss used.
We've spoke to the shareholders... Ermm, sorry the experts and they think one a month is absolutely necessary.
Well done
It’s funny how politics don’t have a leg to stand on
Wouldn't trust Javid with a packet of biscuits,  let alone my health.
Yes makes perfect sense to sack all the hero’s who kept everything going during the crisis. Should be personal choice. He’s right about the science not making sense, if he has antibodies why does he need the jab? Politics and money over science. He should be thanking the nhs and doctors not punishing them by dismissing people who don’t want the vaccine. Disgusting.
It's bollocks... The advice is flawed by the lack of information collected regarding covid immunity through infection 🤔 The whole population could well have had a dose of the coof and they wouldn't know...
snowflakes
How dismissive and petulant attitude toward a doctor that knows very well what he is talking about
Well done to the Doctor.
I hope he stays strong, and won't fired by the NHS.  don't take the vaccines
CDC days 79% of Omicron infections in US are fully vaccinated. 62.5% of the population is fully vaxed... do the math - vaccination is increasing peoples chances of infection.
Great to see such a respectful discussion about a sensible issue.
Well said Dr, 100 % agree with that
Clearly said by the man, we do what they want us to do, period. No need to bring in valued arguments.
This doctor has all my respect he has balls and on the other hand i piss on this politician corrupt and liar bold head
Next...... The monthly pill .....
The true meaning of the word mandatory is an agreement between two parties on whatever the issue is.
Javid should be be behind bars for his crimes against individual liberty.
I told my in laws this very same thing last weekend, that we’d have to get a booster every couple of months when something new comes along. I’ve had my two. That’s it for me. I’ll take my chances thanks. I never have a flu vaccine and I’m 45 now.
Much respect for this gentleman for speaking out!
Glad that doctor spoke up. Each to your own at the end of the day it’s meant to be a free state we live in.
My partner has to have the seasonal flue jab every year or she might be struck off, she works for the nhs aswell so how is this any different? Rules are rules. Don’t want the vaccine then don’t be a doctor
Sky News uploading this video increases my trust and confidence in them as a news source. I’m trippled jabbed, but we shouldn’t censor those (especially doctors) who are sceptical
Javid has no sense. He's a puppet to those at the top of the pyramid. His controllers push the agenda. The doctor is thinking practically.   Sadly, even if Javid was to go, the replacement would be the same. Under total control.
THESE NURSES REMIND MEPOLAND IN 1960-70 NO ONE WAS ALLOWED TO SAY SOMETHING  LOL
Javid mate, go and sell some curry and rice instead.
Yaay
First of all doctors are not virology experts , he is exposed to antibodies because he worked with covid patients in his own words where as general public is not...so don't be a fool and get vaccinated
Thanks Sky News for your unbiased reporting ❤
How long until Youtube pulls this video? I give it 1 more day.
This is how a hospital makes their money by killing people
Fire him
Jab is bullshit, this video says a lot about it, prove me wrong
The Anaesthetist needs to wear his mask properly.
Bye idiot
WoW sky 🌌
Hero standing up for free choice in front of colleague peer pressure and the health secretary! We need more doctors like this!
We take very best advice that we can - and kickbacks from pharma companies that are profiting immensely from vaxx and endless boosters.
I am vaccinated, and i do not support vaccination mandates. Only thing to be mandatory is bread and water, why not give that out for free, globally ?
Lol. Awkward...surprised msm aired this. Politician vs Doctor. On a medical subject. And the doctor is gaslighted. Not cool.
We should have a trained doctor as health secretary instead of this clown.
Question; who are vaccine experts in that global circus? 🤣
A very telling video hopefully common sense will start to prevail. I t would be interesting to know if the heads of the pharma companies would be willing to vax their families and themselves endlessly.
Grate job speaking out to the doctor
Well done doctor
STRONGLY agree with the physicians, had Covid I haven't been sick since 2019.. COVID attacks your nervo system, it was extremely hard to fight off COVID then again I have had worse through the history of my life... imagine to have to take a "shot" every month..dear Lord, NO Thanks. I do BELIEVE we should always have a mask from here on, REGARDLESS because it just makes sense. Blessings 🙏
Where common goods are above civil rights that's communism.  This ideologists took our freedom away with tiny steps and in plain sight.
Javid is unworthy
most all good doctors have already quit or been fired .  most moving to florida
140,000 NHS workers cant be wrong ?  Will they really sack them by next spring ? I suspect it will all have blown over by then, hopefully
Now that’s a man !!!
It’s a great shame that more news outlets did not run this story… what the doctor said made sense to me but I would love to hear a retort from a vaccine expert. It does seem crazy to fire medical staff who have worked through this whole situation when the vaccine does not do a lot to stop transmission! What a waste.
So happy someone is aware
Maybe the 17% pay rise the MP got should have gone to the NHS last year no the MP don't care about any buddy
I've never got COVID even when 4 others in my home got it....why? My wife had it and I refused to not sleep, hug and kiss her. I wasn't Jabed either.
Pandemic……more like scamdemic
This is a great post. I've had my initial jab and one booster. My Dad has Asbestosis and other respitory issues. I'd appreciate it if the anti-vaxers would refrain from attacking me on my decision because I did what I felt was in the best interest to protect my Dad. Regardless of your view on the vaccine, I'm sure anyone can appreciate the importance of family and their wellbeing. However my reason for commenting is that I won't be having any more boosters. My family and I have reached the point where we can no longer justify the need for it. It just doesn't make sense. Initially we did what we felt we had to do to prioritse my Dad's safety but now it's just a circus. I'd like to be clear that I still understand and respect that there is a virus. To dismiss that concept entirely is just foolish. I just fail to see any justification for this endless media scaremongering.
Dr. brah said there's not enough science
I have literally never heard that a booster lasts for 1-2 months.
There's a politician involved. So it's 100% lies.
Wasnt it the so called experts that didnt tell the people of the world for months after the virus was released namely the .who.or did he forget .
The government, regardless of which party they belong to, are nothing but clowns. Clueless idiots. I am happy to never vote again, knowing that if I do, I'll be supporting such lunacy.
the fact that the nurses are even scared to answer that question .... they know they will loose their job if they say the wrong thing
I just realised this is an Anti-Vaccine mouthpiece, clearly any views to the contrary will not go down well.
well done to the doctor with more qualifications than Javid's brain cells.
Other news Networks would not have shown this. Thanks sky news for standing up for the voiceless
Bless him!!!!
That Doctor is right! It's completely insane what policy is being enforced on the people. It seems like what we're witnessing now is simply government bought by Pharma, and government trying to do everything to provide the public with an illusion of safety when in reality there isn't one.
Surprised they aired this.
Blessings for this Man ! Well Done! Brave !
Ha!
Anyone notice how uncomfortable the nurses were to tell Sajid Jabbied they didn't agree with the vaccine shots?   Had they been in favour they would have spoken up and not felt uncomfortable about what their initial feelings were. This doctor is a true man of ethics, and deserves the utmost respect for being completely honest and forthright with Jabbied. No doubt he just painted a huge cross on his back for later.  Jabbied only wants to keep is job in cabinet so he can push for PM someday, that and keep his crony mates in money in the Pharma field. Who is to say this doctor is not an expert, he is a highly qualified medical professional, who understands latency and depletion of non-human chemicals in the human body, after all he' is an anesthetist, it is his job to understand these things.  Personally, I feel Jabbied wanted the staff to say yes we all want the jab and anyone not having it is a fool, but not one voice in favour of jabbing medical staff speaks volumes.
THE DOCTOR IS RIGHT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The only guy in the room with the balls to say anything
- Science is not strong enough on that. - That's your view....   WTF!
Wow! NHS Professionals receives no respect at all by their own boss, this speaks volumes dose it.
Legend
Good man
From people who are vaccine expert 🤐
Well done to the Doctor.  The people who r so called vaccine experts  r not looking at our interest. The doctor even explained yet the idiot didnt understand  a word
Massive respect to that doctor!!! If only this was the normal news instead of the bias bullshit pumped out 95% of the time!
Today I read that they’re thinking of charging for UK lateral flow tests due to financial reasons…so if the “professionals” are intent on re-boosting every couple of months (which in the long run will surely be unsustainable), then IMHO it’ll only be a matter of time before we have to pay for them also! So basically it’ll be “pay up, or increased risk of death from a global pandemic”! PS: Biggest respect possible to this Doctor…keep this video Trending for as long as possible!!!
Amazing!!! When a Dr talks to a health secretary who is not a Dr but apparently javid is getting the very best advice 🤣🤣🤣 don't give in Dr!!
Massive respect to this doctor, interesting how he comes across as informed, kind, honest and even assisted in deflecting away from those nurses being manipulated into answering a sensitive question.....Sajid seems to be in over his head seeing how he couldn't refute this doctors information so he bullies ahead with the narrative expected from him. Busted!!!
Well done Doc, a true king
I don't think this video will be available for long, this doctor spoke too well the nurses did not say a word in favor of the mandates...... a big slap in the face, hopefully, people start to wake up.
Was that really a group of actual nurses or a bunch of giggly 12 year old school girls who just happened to be there on work experience day?
its surprising this video hasn't been taken down in the way others have been which are critical of vaccination.
Boom!!!
What a hero this doctor is. Finally a intelligent doctor not a sheep like the rest. Xxxx
What a horrible, disappointing, pitiful excuse for a medical doctor. His license should be revoked. He has even cowed and intimidated his co-workers to the extent that they are afraid to speak up.
I congratulate this doctor his integrity. Well done sir!
Enjoy mental slavery friends... 😔 Mostly to that guy pushing the doctor to vax. The doctor is smarter then the rest of these tw@ts! 👍
I assume this doctor is not an expert in this particular field. He can resign any time he wants.
Good on him!
Well, feel free to resign.
biden thinks that guy is a selfish idiot. i know which one i’d trust more
Sajid Javid was not interested in a word the Consultant Anaesthetist told him. Looks like a real Tosser!
nurses are very enthusiastic about that..... the silence is soooo telling :-)
Those who didn't want it should have gone on strike.
I'd be embarrassed to work with him and I'd tell him to his face every day
Sounds more political than practical.
look at that fear in his eyes when nobody says anything
Haha being told by actual professionals.
Politician tells doctor who doesn't want the vaccine he doesn't know what he's talking about.
He’s against the brick wall of reality  As the doc schools him
How many times can the Human immune system be duped before it says bugger it and stops working as intended   I e been asking this question since I heard about the flue vaccine , and we can only make vaccines from what we have and by the time it's fully rolled out the virus mutates .
Respect to the Dr for speaking his truth.  At least Sky News have actually reported it and shown that real impartial journalism can still exist.
I can guarantee that they'll be plenty of medical experts in that hospital that would disagree with him.
Javid didn't want to hear it 😂 lol. I love how they tell us ordinary folk to shut up because we r not "doctors" & they also tell the doctors to shut up because they r not "vaccine experts" ... ok....
🙌🙌🙌🙌💯💯
This guy not even want to hear the truth ...
This man is a hero. Look ladies and gents a real hero! Where's his knighthood? I'll buy this man a drink myself.
Well done to the consultant anaesthetist:  Mr Javid with his eye on becoming PM faces an honest doctor who faces losing job and career to speak the truth.
Not all hero’s wear capes
Very awkward
My hats off and Credit to the Doctor Who stood up for his rights and his beliefs. They can’t keep injecting us with vaccines and our bodies have antibodies after we get the virus which is probably better than a vaccine. Natural immunity!
And this is a doctor he's talking to. A doctor would know more than this man from the CDC.
Met this Doctor in McDonalds this morning. He served me, and warned me the burger’s were transmissible .
If  nurses and doctors stick together all say that all leave if any mandates are forced that's the way to go.... nurses doctors stick together that all .... 👊👊👊👊
Sajid javid does not understand what he is doing, he is just playing with people's lives it's all a plandemic. He wants to scare and put fear into people shame on him. We are made out of science
Just looking at this it dawned on me!!! how stupid does it look with these people wearing masks which dont work.
I am in the same situation. I won't be working after 15th of March 2022 because of the Vaccine mandate. Looking for another job.  I believe that when one door is closed another will be opened.
Well Done 👏
I’m amazed this is shown on mainstream media. This is important I wish they’d all speak.
I thought we follow the science, not the dismissive "it's your view" hegemony of fools and politicians.
This Doc is spot on! It's absolutely ludicrous to mandate this waste of time "vaccine "
Sajid is so defensive and insecure it's hideous to watch. Nothing but respect for the Doctor.
Well said 👏🏻 👏🏻
The nurses know the score
They take advice from the people that "are vaccine experts" and are either sponsored or paid by big-pharma and bow down to the mainstream narrative or else they are censored... yes of course, we understand the lies.
Damn right, the mandates are ridiculous and ineffective. Not to mention illegal.
I am glad that 'a soldier in the field' has finally spoken some sense.
Stupid. Get vaccinated.
I wonder if they fired that Doctor after the interview…………….(Not that I want him to be fired for speaking the truth)
Vaccine experts!!!  Immunologists have been saying for the last 2 years that it’s not needed.....
We have to weigh it all up??? Weigh What up??? It’s a complete farce, it’s been a farce from day one!! This is all about making money........  NOTHING MORE
This doctor is wrong. He clearly doesn't understand why the antibodies created by the vaccine are better than the natural group from his infection. This video should explain why...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6leHWwqUUt8
This guy is a hero!
Steve James is a hero and I support him completely.
The doctor is the representation of those few free- thinking for themselves deciding strong and smart individuals of the society.... The nurses are the representation of the society
TRUE, that put Javid in his place! that doctor was brave, as long as people wear full PPE then allow them to choose.  At least they are not going around not wearing a mask gathering with others who are not wearing masks.
It is now time for all to say No to Medical Tyranny!  If not, everyone will have to be prepared for the monthly subscription to a pill/not a jab!
Good for him!
For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known. - The Bible Luke 12 verse 2
Lets see if that staff will be willing once they realised that they will at least take the vaccination every two months and that for the rest of their lives,  this vacination does not stop the virus, perhaps it does stop severity for some and for some it actualy courses more severe diseases. Why are they so persitant on giving the people the shot, knowing it does not make a differance
Nurses should tell Javid to shove the vaccine where the sun don't shine  But as usual they acted like a coward Bravo to the Doctor
That's your view.  Ummmmm it's actual science......
Why are reporters allowed in the hospital when relatives aren’t ?disgusting, the whole video is suspicious the media were not obligated to show this but they chose to, why ? trust nothing at this time, there will be an ulterior motive
Love the way the Dr thinks
👏👏👏 well done Doc
Javid is bought and paid for.
Good
So the doctors words were dismissed  He should Listen to the people on the front line. But won’t .., Rather go by the script given to all governments to follow. Why did China may 2019  Buy thousands of pcr test kits Why were USA and China intwined together regarding virus research in the wuhan lab  Manipulating nasty virus to enhance it This Gain of function is risking  Up to 50% of the population,  if one man made virus is released,escaped etc  Then what? On the plus side 1/2 the carbon emissions  More housing Plenty of food The earth could recover. Just a thought
Respect
Unfortunately nothing is shown to us unless it is meant to , always look for the underlying reason
I stand in support with the doctor. I really hope thousands of nhs staff call their bluff and refuse the vaccine. They will soon backdown
Respect to the Doctor !
Please give Doctor James the Health Secretary's job. Common sense given so humbly by a man who really knows what is going on, he gets all my respect. It highlighted wonderfully how out of his depth and incompetent Javid is.
What a brave doctor!! The protection from natural immunity is between 13 and 25 fold over two vaccine shots and the protection will vane not faster than a vaccinated protection. It is a shame that there is still no equivalency of natural immunity.
It's all about the money.
The question remains. Where are all the other doctors? The should all be speaking out.
Very admirable. He should be protected at all costs!
With all these boosters needed shows me that the vaccine is not very good ,at least not this one
Good man!
Surprised sky news are showing this. Has Bill Gates not paid his monthly subscription this January?
I’m surprised sky news have aired this.. got a feeling it will be deleted later
Good lad. Needed ti stand up to this governments lies and tyranny.  He will probably be the first to be sacked as savage jabbit will not forgrt being upstaged by a mere doctor.
It takes courage nowadays to speak plain truth because there is real fear of being ostracized, or worse, if one doesn't parrot the approved narratives of the government agencies, irregardless of their truth.  It's disgusting.  Kudos to this doctor.
Big up Steve James! The nurses silence speaks volumes!
This is the government all over.. don’t want to listen to a doctor, someone who is specially trained and knows knowledge way beyond there tiny minds…just because it doesn’t fit there agenda .. pathetic
The winds of change are a blowing.
Good on him it needs doctors to tell them... the only loosers are the money makers out of covid
What a man! We need to make sure this guy doesn't get pushed out. Takes a lot to voice his opinion there!
SPEAK OUT nurses! sheep need to turn to morally guided men and women!
This was staged. 🤔
All the ladies there wanted to say they weren't happy with the policy. It's oppressive. He's a role model for speaking up and showing integrity.
More people needs to hear this!
My comments and links to the doctors evidence was removed by YouTube….  Clear agenda
It was staged what utter nonsense
Politicians are way out of their depth, their arrogance has flourished during this pandemic. Hand over to the experts Javid (by the way no one from the Eaton brigade) we need anaesthetists not so sure we need Javids
Initially I started feeling sorry for that guy having been put on the spot, but he totally blew my mind by so calmly explaining his side supported by facts and figures so well that the others did not know how to counter it.. Yes, he makes absolute sense... My standing applause for this guy who was brave enough to speak the truth... We truly need more of such folks and less of folks who do stuff only because others are doing it too... 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Thats what reason and integrity look like
DOCTOR +NOVAK DOJKOVIC = revolution ......
So much bullying going on. It's despicable. Brave doctor. Much respect to him.
Look at The World Economic Forum website about gene therapy.  Look up a video which talks entitled 'Technologist's Views of the Future'. Gene therapy.  They don't deny it. Not for me, this gene therapy.
well done but the usual nhs staff dont want to say anything because of management politicans just dont listen
my frend work in hospital in POLNAD  he say that 50% of people in hospital now are VACINETED people.....
Difference between doctor speaking and nurses silent. When someone is financially independent, they can speak their mind.
corrupt goverment !!!! vacine$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
See those who have not been vaccinated are the ones in hospital and are suffering from it
the truth will win ....stay strong people
The women were too stunned to speak
DOCTOR IS HERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I work admin at King's, and I'm weighing how much I need this job. This mandate is wrong in so many ways. And it's disgusts me how our government now makes health care decisions for us. I've spoken to every doctor and nurse I have ever worked with and they say the exact same thing as this doctor. There is no science out there that says this move makes sense.
Doctors have been warning people about the vaccine and corrupted politicians at that start of the pandemic.  Look up Wold Doctors alliance and wake up people‼‼‼
Retarded politicians is the real pandemic
Wow
No one should've been jabbed!
Stood there talking through a valved 3M FFP3 Respirator. He maze well be stood there with no mask on at all,his unfiltered breath is contaminating the environment.
After me second jab my normal allergy problems tripled, no booster for me sorry 😐
politicians are all crooks i hope they get a horrific death soon
Finally a dr speaking up!
Massive respect to this doctor, he has been working with covid patients all through the pandemic so he knows what his talking about
The Doctor needs a MBE.
Weird.. everything that medical professional said made perfect sense, and everything that politician said made little to no sense.. very strange indeed 🤔
We were told get two jabs and that's it. Now we need booster and talk of a 4th. This will never stop until we start saying NO. The vaccine experts are the people that make them, the government can't see it.
So proud if that doctor for standing up to that paid for idiot..
Doctor's are over paid tossers. Hang the lot of them.
The nurses of NHS THEY ARE ANGELES
Every single one, and i mean EVERY single one of these comments is in support of this courageous doctor.   It makes me wonder if anyone believes this covid crap any more 🤔
the anti vaxxer comments wow  gross
Fantastic!!!
Politician…we take the very best advice…doctor….what he knows nothing…politicians…grubs with another agenda
Idiot. Fire that doctor.
Every 2 months yeah I pass..
NOVAK DOJKOVIC   AND DOCTOR  ARE HEROS OF 2022......and healf ministry $$$$$$vacine bussnes
There’s no reasoning with these demonic politicians. This isn’t about health.
Another scene showing how nothing these politicians say makes sense. Is it me or are they all talking like Boris the *********
Get the Jesus vaccine instead.
Brave man 1000000000 respect to him stand behind him all the way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxiQeZ21SFU
This Dr is an idiot. How is his remark helping NHS?
I'm absolutely furious at the way he spoke to that doctor!!!
Hope he gets sacked then. He swore an oath to protect patients wellbeing.
🤣 he didn't like that answer..I wonder why
GOD BLESS THE DOCTOR !!!
The Doctor is an idiot and judging from the comments here he is not alone in that regard.
Much love and respect for been true to yourself Doc. These tyrants in power have no idea what they are doing.
From the people that are "vaccine experts" ;big pharma. The Dr is correct.
👍👍👍well said dr
Stand up, be brave like this doctor.
Credit the SKY news for showing this, I’m quite surprised to be honest.
👏
These doctors know for good reason why they wont be taking it . If they wont then theres something very messed up .
Yes and respect to this doctor or nurse for speaking out . Keep it coming ?
THE DOCTOR AND NOVAK DOJKOVIC 2 HEROS !!!!!
YES. SPEAK UP.
we had hope on vaccine in stopping this pandemic ..   it look like  vaccines are not working as expected ... it problem may lie in vaccines it self , vaccination process or something else ... the governments and  pharmaceutical companies had invested a lot in vaccines  they are pushing for use to   .. there is a lot unknown ...
*THIS DOCTOR IS AN ABSOLUTE BOLD, HONEST, OPEN & KNOWLEDGEABLE LEGEND* 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 💪🏼 💪🏼  *HE VOCALISED EXACTLY WHAT ALL OF THOSE  SILENT NERVOUS NURSES & THOUSANDS MORE ARE TOOOOOOO SCARED TO SAY* *MAY HIS BRAVERY CAUSE MANY MORE TO  SPEAK UP & PROTECT THEIR BODIES!!!* 🙏🏽 💪🏼
They threaten  people  with losing their  job that's  why  they are silent , people  start to sale their  integrity  for money insted to get United and stand up !
Since it is an accepted fact that the vaccine does not stop a person catching the virus, and more importantly, does not stop an infected person infecting others, how can it be useful to forcibly vaccinate NHS workers and care workers?  Sorry, I'm not interested in the last-ditch argument of desperation that a booster will (read 'may') reduce symptom severity.  I want an answer to the main question.  Why force a vaccine that does nothing to protect the people these heroic NHS workers are caring for?
They are corrupted by big pharma
Is this guy not vaccinated against Hep B?
I love that doctor, tell them !
Well done to the doctor !! We need more medical professionals who will stand up and speak out about this madness and the governments last attempt to end OUR NHS .. we need more doctors like that highly educated man working for our NHS and sack all the blood sucking parasites sat pen pushing
And he's the only one wearing a flimsy surgical mask and letting it slip under his nose. He's an idiot!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f2OJX953KU
He does not want to hear real world facts. Only information from vaccine experts.
A politician telling a doctor he'll take his info from "vaccine experts". "We'll take the best advice we can"; code for we'll listen to the ones that support our agenda.  Here's a doctor who is opening up the much needed room for discussion and debate yet being shut down by a politician. The disclaimer at the end says it all... he's a brave man for speaking out wjen many others have  chosen the path of silence for fear of being ostracized or even fired.
Well if the NHS lose a large portion of its staff because they are not vaccinated there will be no one left to administer the jabs to those that do want it because the remainder will be looking after people that are actually in hospital.
Sajid Javid. What country is this again?
I agree with the doctor and I don’t think it’s right to walk into a hospital and start asking doctors their person preference if they chose to be vaccinated or not. It’s really against HIPPA violation but I’m glad to hear there are skeptic docs. Unfortunately as hoppy as I feel, I got both doses of vaccination.
the doctor fucked .. Health Secretary
Doctor makes complete sense to me
I'll never join this global cult.
Good for him...
Who are the "experts" if Dr Steve James is not one??? Lol 😋
Spot on.
Big shoutout to the doctor for telling Javid some home truths, time for more doctors to start speaking out!
Hero doctor!!!
The truth burnt a hole in the fog of lies.The entire planet had kowtowed to a fabricated reality.
This guy is a real one! look at them sheeple women who cannot speak 🙄.  He is so right! but Sajid was in finance before he sat in the health minister seat and he couldn't say nothing to the Dr.  Big up this doctor he's a hero for many who are sheeple and cannot speak up.
I would love to have such video live and not cut. Until this is not happening - I do not trust media. There is may be a turn in tide, but the truth is far from out. The little change in tone on TV or in some papers may be is the try to calm people down. If this doctor is real - fine - good for him, may be for people too, at least now, when their own life on the line, more NHS staff will start to come out and speak the truth. I do not believe all of them are dumb and greedy. I just hope it is not too late.
Why must we take it against our will?? If the NHS needs us and we’ve working since the begging of the pandemic?? We were good enough then, but not now? Good on the doctor. Shame on the nurses for not speaking up
Who else is amazed the comments section is open? and im glad it is as I thought I was the only one questioning this mandate madness.
That doctor is going to suffer for his honesty. Respect him for that but his job will be made harder for him. Feel sorry for him. Standing up to people in power is a tough thing to do. Hope hes alright.
(we take advice from vacine experts   $$$$$$$$ )....WHAT a JOKE this goverment is!!
Good man 👍
Will sajid 'trust the science' when it's coming from a doctor with an opinion that's different from the narrative?
💯
respect for the doctor
RESPECT TO THE DOCTOR !!!!! real HERO....HEALTH secretary just works for propaganda !!!!!!!!!!!!
Shut up javid
Respect to doctor!
anaesthetists  train for nearly a decade and do a very imporant job surely they have enough intelligence to decide if stupid vaccine is in their best interest or not ! this goverment is a joke
Give that man a Knighthood!  Tony Blair doesn't deserve the honor, this doctor has the character and virtues that should be celebrated and honored today.
panchgavya>jab
Here in India we use panchgavya instead of vax. Much better
Here in Germany we are risking of losing highly skilled professionals by forcing them to be vaccinated. Sad really. Well done for speaking out!
More and more people thank god are seeing through the lies .Shine light on the evil it hates it !!!!!
Respect to the Doctor there. God bless him
por fin alguien dice lo que piensa sin miedo! no fear!
Will only take an another jab if they are able to make an vaccine as effective as the ones given for polio. If I need to keep on taking booster shots every 2 months,then it makes no sense. Maybe these booster shots can be encouraged to old people and the ones with medical conditions not forced, but I don't see the point of taking these booster shots as a healthy man in his twenties, btw I contracted COVID before taking the vaccine 1&2 and was back to being healthy in a weeks time, only the sense of taste and smell took a while to come back. Plus this vaccine only helps with not contracting severe symptoms, one can still spread it if they contract it. My dad also got the virus before taking the vaccine and he had a major heath scare(14 days with oxygen support), so I see the point of people with pre medical conditions and old age taking the vaccine, as I said vaccine works since my grandparents also contracted the virus but they were vaccinated(both of them have pre medical conditions) and they got well very fast. So I will ask my parents especially my dad to keep on taking the booster since his immune system is not so strong but for me and my brother I don't think we need it.
This is my reasoning for not having the vaccine. I have the antibodies and delta never even made me feel that ill in the first place. I have better immunity than 90% of the vaccinated people and I'm in great health, yet I'm deemed "selfish and careless". I'm at more risk from falling seriously ill from the vaccine than I am covid. Why should I risk potential blood clots and heart attacks when my health and immunity are great without the vaccine? Why should my liberties be stripped?. Also, given the fact the companies like pfizer producing the vaccines have legal indemnity makes me feel uneasy too, because if I fall ill from these drugs, the companies aren't liable to do anything to compensate me.
As an an NHS staff member and member of the human race I feel it is my duty to have the vaccine/ booster and I have.
Hes gonna lose his job for not going along with marxism.
AND SHAME ON THE NURSES FOR NOT BACKING HIM
Hero of the day.
SO PROUD OF THIS DOCTOR AND THE SO CALLED EXPERTS WHO ARE ADVISING THE GOVERNMENT ARE THE MANUFACTURERS 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Courageous doctor trying to be polite while arguing with a mental midget health secretary stooge.
I’m surprised we were allowed to see the conversation.   What does it represent?
Totally agree with this doctor, massive respect for him for speak out. I wouldn't want to be hooked on a booster jab every month for rest of my life. No one should be threatened into taking the vaccine or risk losing their job.
Finally some unfiltered truth. Let people have their say and let others heart the truth.
The commentators here don't need a vaccine. They don't go out and their only social interaction is done online
Notice how he has no rebuttal/response other than just a blatant appeal to authority.
Its got to make people wonder if the MOD are batting for the white hats, or the corporate money grabbers.
That doctor is probably in a cellar somewhere now, tied to a chair with a nine inch nail stuck in each of his thighs.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCrrKZ-EFMPRhT4pCH8OaP1g
Bravo Doc; Bravo!
This has the largest likes, Sky news, or any news, has had, in a long time!
This is a real doctor.hats off to him.well done.we need more like him to represent the society.
This dirty politician walking into a hospital and thinking he is above them. It needs to stop
Epic. His experts are Big Pharma.
This is a cut video ,wheres the part where obesse and people with underlined problems were the majority of patients in hospital the doctor stated. Sky please stop cutting videos and show the real facts in the full video. What the nhs need is more people like him, who are afraid of loseing their job so have no choice but to speak the truth,until sky cut that bit out.
I’m a little surprised that Sky News hasn’t been suspended by YouTube for promoting misinformation about Covid vaccinations, as many channels have , even when just stating information provided by the Government. I should add that I totally support the right of all people to not have any vaccine if that is their wish, without fear of being dismissed from their jobs, or, being discriminated against in anyway. In accordance with international laws that this country is a signatory too.
All of the nurses bit their tongues...
Javid getting destroyed - do not comply.
Hilarious that the health minister asks the NHS staff there opinion,then goes onto tell them that they only listen to experts 🙄
Threatening people with their jobs to get vaccinated is now described as " encourage all NHS to get the jab " !? Really?
So this Dr and his Friend, and at least 10% of them do not want Jabs eh? BRILLIANT! Smart people!
Brave doctor, bravo! This illegal coercion on vax mandates has got to stop.
Wonder if he’s still got his job ?
Great more mumbo jumbo from the health secretary now . Arguing with a doctor .......
So this "health minister" refuses the "science" 🥴
The doctor should be vaccinated, absolutely shameful
This video won't be up much longer
This is what speaking truth to power really is.
The health Secretary think he was doing a propoganda walk through thing all nurses and doctors would follow the same agenda and bullshit the public by being all agreable that vaccines are good. Thank God the doctor disgareeed with this crap!  the Helath secretary didn't want to have any of it, quickly turned to nurses expecting a rebuttal since they dodn't saya word earlier. These people must be stopped lying to the public.. They will be held accountable some day.
Javid the banker knows best....NOT. His ignorance, when talking to a doctor, shines through. He is an appalling human being, I(I use the term very loosely), as are the idiots in parliament keeping this nonsense going. They are just puppets carrying out orders from their globalist masters.
Well done, I'm absolutely  agree,  I'm Nurse  with  30 years experience, in my opinion Government instead of supporting  NHS during  this difficult  time and improving  medical  care  services, they  do everything  to stop  the  system working  effectively.
Very uncomfortable that for Javid. It's one thing when a scientist goes online and says all this, but another when someone wearing the full protective gear, working in medicine, gives it to him straight. Wish more would speak up like this.
Brilliant fair play to this doctor well done what a man true honest speach
Give this Men a 🥇
The time to speak up and out is now, don't wait and don't be afraid.
I wonder how long before this courageous & scientifically correct doctor gets a 'visit' from the NHS Gestapo, & almost certainly loses his job? In 1-2y when we have started Nuremberg 2.0, he will be a very sort after doctor !!
No to cancelling opposing views. Freedom of decision over everything we are in the UK not Beijing.
Lot of likes on this one 🙂
👍👍🙏
Just publish in full the advice he is being given along with the counter arguments and data so that we can all make an informed decision, easy peasy unless someone is lying.
Outrageous sacking staff  for not getting vaccinatiobns who  have saved lives through out the pandemic. What's the real agenda Govt?
The other nurses there all wanted to say the same but too scared to loose jobs. Shameful government
So that doctor is in the mindset of herd amenity then …. and let not forget .. he pledged to ..” do no harm “ 😵‍💫
I would be surprised if the Dr is not sent to a concentration camp for opposing govt
More like they take advice from the people they've paid off to say whatever helps them gain more power. Piss on your vaccine.
Surprising this surfaced and props to the doctor. Most aren't as brave knowing they will get crushed for not following the propaganda.
God Bless that Doctor, he's one of the good ones. I pray he gets to keep his job. I agree with him 100%.
This will be the final time Javid takes questions from non pre-selected people
Doctor: "The science isn't strong enough" Sajid: "Well that's your view"
All the anti-vaxxers in the comments piping up, total shocker.
Javid wants to implement absolute nonsensical vax policies and yet there's noise about the NHS being understaffed and overwhelmed. A 5 year old could make better decisions than this 🤡
It’s not even a vaccine them vaccine experts don’t know what they are talking about
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
The fear in the nurse's eyes.  Very scary. I no longer trust the NHS.
Javed knows he's been rumbled! And is desperately trying to dig himself out of a hole.
The guy behind 😂🤣I love this doctor !! At least someone say truth and it’s in the news 👍🏼😀😀😀so happy xxxx
Wake up world ......its all about the vaccine ....
I understand that this has been edited, removing a section where the brave consultant anaesthetist mentioned that many of the people in the Cov-19 wards are obese with typical comorbidities.
The doctor will be sacked within a week I bet....
I was forced to take the vaccine. I am a nurse. We already doing so much in this time. They should respect our decision, is our body! After I had the vaccine I feel so tired, that I could not concentrate properly. I also  had the covid recently  with the same symptoms. The fatigue, tiredness still. So what is the point?? If I get.. I get it.  But I do not want to be forced to do the booster to keep my job, pay my bills and live. And exist as a person.
Talking to a doctor: "We take our advice from VACCINE EXPERTS" [if I say it loud & clear I'm gonna sound more convincing] Smells like desperation to me!
as much as I hate the tories. Sajid has a point, this man is an anaesthetist, he is no more qualified to speak about the science of the virus than those nurses he was asking.
The way he said it’s your view and dismissed him that’s rude
What the man said is true all these vaccines are just not working just look at the spread of this virus be it a milder form of the virus the vaccines every month quote I dont think so some how  no more of that crap for me
👍 for the doctor. A courageous person.
Forcing an object into someones body is never right, to legalise it would be absolutely barbaric.
Needs sharing with everyone in your contact list. If it wasn’t a thought crime we all would
They have a lot of people frightened to speak their truth it's so sad watching the nurses to afraid to speak their truth well done to the doctor who spoke out yet is opinion was basically walked over  can't believe this hasn't been taken down
i clap for this doctor (meanwhile im still immune to covid-19 but what the hay might aswell get the vacine so i can join the vacine gang)
Why are the nurses all sitting there as if a cat has their tongue? SAY SOMETHING
It's mad how they are letting this stay on the trending page, everybody needs to see this!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻TOP BLOKE
Thanks to all the knowledgeable people commenting here I've learned heaps
Javid has no answer to facts
Sajid's head looks like a boiled egg.
Will never ever get this poison!!!
Funny how the "vaccine experts"  don't seem to make decisions based on actual evidence but seem to be working for the PR departments of pharma.
Sajid is a sniveling 💩
My antibodies are stronger than the vaccine. The vaccine would therefore weaken my immune system, but not everyone is like me. It's an individual choice and some people need it more than others
What a brave doctor to speak out.  Thank god for people like this who are willing to stick their necks out for something that is so wrong and unfounded.
“We take the very best advice that we can from people that are vaccine experts”   *Pfizer and Moderna lobbyists wave*
Very disappointing response from the health minister. The government is backing vaccinations based on its scientific evidence and the advice of the heads of the NHS, so why didn’t he articulate that in his reply to this antivax NHS employee?
They'll still be dismissed for not taking the vaccine
Natural immunity is so much better then the vaccine. Their is no debate on this. Israel did a study on this and natural immunity is 19 times more effective then vaccine.
We need more brave doctors -like this one- that do their homework, and not just obey they are told to do…
Truth will out and charges will be brought.
*Happy to tell Javid where he can stick his vaccination. He bullied those nurses using his position. He is a disgrace. This banker should be run out of town. I pray there is a Nuremburg 2. The biggest lie ever. SAFE & EFFECTIVE. Maybe Skynews should play the whole clip. Well done to this hero Dr.*
How is it that he is more experienced than the experts. If he is an ordinary doctor then he is just a service engineer, by comparison. His argument is stupid. What harm would it do, for him to get vaccinated, if only to pacify others.
y1
First rational debate I've heard two years into this. Lots of New Years Honours and awards for bravery handed out though. Hmmmm
His PR guy just got fired.  Sad to see
This doctor is a fool.
What a good man, its people like that who give me faith. He stood there voice trembling and spoke the truth despite receiving no support from his colleagues,
Aaaannd....Javid's got nothing.
...he will take advice from the people who are vaccine experts not doctors...hahaha..This guy is a minister of health??? Never saw anyone who wants to sell products to speak wrong about it...Bravo for brave doctor. We want advice based on real since not marketing.
There’s always a nutter , doctors are nutters too. There’s nothing to say 100% of doctors are intelligent. And him being a doctor doesn’t make him a specialist in vaccines . He should be sacked , I don’t want that dirty doctor anywhere near me
at last some common sense
Hero
Our immune system is much more intelligent than our politicians and celebrities.
Doctors should promote public health and encourage vaccination . Take the vaccine not for your sake but for everyone else who look for your example.
Doctor provides good arguments, health minister does not respond as he is out of arguments and cannot really refute the doctor's arguments. At the end health minister discredits the doctor by saying that the health ministry takes advice from 'experts' in vaccines, which is a non-sensical thing to say in quite a few ways.
F A C T S
That doctor is not alone in what he is thinking and what he's eating is the very big elephant sat in the room that we're not allowed to talk about. WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY???????
Sajid is in it for the same money and power, as the rest of "the experts" he's referring to is.
That's your view? No, those are the facts. 🖕🏼
I feel a U turn coming
I hope that man can keep his job. And sadly those women huddled together looking at each other too frightened to speak are a representation of the majority of society.
sad he didnt kick his corporate head in though....he deserves it...always say no deal banker
Good for him for pointing this out. And what others have been saying too, but being censored by entities like Sky News. Still sceptical on what the mainstream have to gain from this. Because it certainly isn't truth lol.
If NHS had one like him in each hospital my family would have been still alive .
When the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care doesn't understand how the vaccines he promotes work.
No comeback whatever all he can say is we listen to the advice. Not to the people though obviously.
Again big  trouble ahead. When will the Authorities understand that the surge of omicron and also new variant in the world is not the result of nonvaccinated (5% -15%) as the variants are  new and recent ones. Further only vaccinated ppl are able to travel overseas to South Africa and other places where they were contaminated before returning back to contaminate others. The surge to covid and omicron is due to nonefficacity of one of the sanitary measures, which cannot prevent the variant from entering our body. The Authorities are hence responsible for these crisis and they don't care and are endangering the life of all these people, police included and their families mainly with the variant omicron prevailing as an air borne virus. The solution is to use essential oil eg amla oil to be rub regularly on hands, forearms and face and face masked and proper washing as the virus/variant is inert in such medium and is not able to enter our body. Already 6 millions of deaths since 2 years. The Authorities and those holding power on covid  have to change strategy with above Deus abençoe
Oops I don't think that was meant to happen.
Health secretary says "there will always be a debate about it", which is just not true. The only way is have the vaccine - there is no debate and this is the whole problem. If only there was a debate people could make up their own minds but with every other avenue being completely shut down , there isn't the possibility of a proper debate. The government has decided despite the fact that the science does not make sense! Huge appreciation for this doctor being willing to stand out from the crowd
So, the *checks notes* banker knows science better than the *checking notes again* DOCTOR. Insanityvile.
I guess the health secretary did not expect the strong view held by this doctor working for NHS to being anti vaccin mandatory.
Finally. Someone in the NHS with some balls
Their ‘science’ also says there are innumerable genders😜
Hero!
This doctor is a Hero. Honesty will always defeat Lies
Still waiting for the other views…
My new hero!
New varriant Found in Cyprus called deltacron combines the Omicron variant of covid19 and the Delta varriant just as infectious as omicron but just as severe as delta 😭
This doctor is a legend
So many likes. If we could see that dislike count, I bet it would be pretty low.
The nurses were quiet because they are just nurses. The doctor can afford to be brave as he can always get another job.
@1:55 "From the people who are vaccine experts" - Trust the science (Tm) and big pharma shills.
Well done standing up for yourself.  Dismissing over not having a vaccine is a outrage.  The nurses stayed quiet for obvious reasons.  They are scared of loss of employment.
WELL DONE DOCTOR
The truth is out there, but it’s being buried by millions of pounds by Pfizer
1:37 giving the man ideas haha
Well done Doc 👊
Vaccine experts: The big pharma companies  Absolutely hysterical, these pharma companies also produce the supposed science backed data & the ceo of Moderna has recently stated everyone on the planet needs to be vaccinated every year  No one sees a conflict of interest here!?
"The vaccine experts"  let me guess. moderna, pfizer, j+j.  get this guy off the stage!  this is done!
What this doctor is saying is everyone's views. Doctors and nurses were ok to work with covid-19 patients in the height of the pandemic and even contracted covid themselves.  Now they are forced to take the experimental drug because the government say so. If the Government used independent scientists and not take advice from the pharmaceutical companies who are benefiting from this pandemic, maybe doctors and nuses would be more onboard.
That man is losing his job, BUT it won't seem like such a big deal when he is 90.  I will not have the experimental injection until I can see AT LEAST three years  of safety studies, no job is worth your life.
OH GOOD. A BANK TECHNOCRAT IN LIEU OF ANOTHER BANK TECHNOCRAT IN TOP UK HEALTH-RELATED JOB. OK RELEVANT. THIS ONE MAY KISS LESS.
Respect to this doctor 👊🏽
We need to resist the health dictatorship being slowly implemented.
Go on son!
Sajid Javid is obviously suffering from symptoms of acute pomposity and terminal self importance. I sooner take advice from Keith Richards of the Stones.
good lad, i own a physio clinic and i havent had it either. I'm a physio.
Brave to think for one's self not for the purpose of self only but rather for the purpose of encouraging others to do the same. Think. Use your brains. Men and women  like this doctor should run their own healthcare facilities.
Lol Sajid Javid is totally dismissing what the Doctor is saying by stating that he is taking the very best advice of the vaccine experts. The vaccine experts who work for the pharmaceutical companies  and it's investors who profit billions from the covid vaccine and booster I take it. Be ready for more booster as  there more money to be made.
This Doctor is a true hero, telling the truth unlike the government.
Bravo,  colleague! We must speak out and tell people the truth!
Its not my fault blame the experts. At least javid has admitted he is ignorant and just doing what he is told, soon he and his experts will be on trial for crimes against humanity or knighted hard to know with this corrupt parliament.
The health secretary couldn't care less what the doctor said. What an arrogant piece of crap.
Because of unvaccinated people, there will always be a host for the Corona Virus to mutate....so sad to hear this from a doctor..hayst...unvaccinated people that doesnt have enough reason are creating caos to the world
Love that hospital ending statement, telling customers how obedient and stupid they are with 90% of staff playing with their own life like it's meaningless.  And those will take care of your life with they best care? I don't think so!
Surprised this discussion was made public.
A brave doctor that all other doctors should look up to and emulate instead of blindly complying with bullshit mandates and bullshit vaccines that DO NOT work
Jab all NHS and Police traitors for keeping quiet during the plandemic
What a hero !!!!
Sajid javid basically giving 2 fingers to the doctor . I think the doctor knows what he's talking about
The tories are all liars …. and all corrupt!
These vaccine experts he takes his advice from are probably the same people who are making and selling the vaccine to the goverenment
The nurses in this video are basically sheep. If this Doctor would've said "yea I'll get it" the sheep (nurses would follow suite)   But now the sheep might follow the doctor by actually standing up to this and questioning the so called "science"
The dr is an absolute icon 🥰
The problem is there is never no debating, well done for this doctor but there needs to be more that speak out👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Bald Cretin.
Doctor just told health secretary to have ppl re-vaccinate every month
This is true example of hands on experience against  bierocracy.This doctor is a hero!
This is probably set up! Probably setting up for people to have a weekly/daily vaccination pill in order to keep on top of the virus because unless we do that, having a vaccine every few months is pointless. Why would they record this talk?! It's all orchestrated nowadays. Bollocks!
I am so pleased to hear a senior Dr speaking up like this- on the news and to the health secretary. He speaks with absolute clarity the reasons on why he will not be vaccinated, they’re are totally logical and valid. I have have been an NHS nurse for 37 years and can see and feel the nurses discomfort around the questions directed at them- they will be genuinely concerned about how best to respond. HR depts are now working flat out regarding who is and isn’t vaccinated, the interviews we now have to do with our staff who are choosing not to be vaccinated, the stance we must take with them and of course what will happen on the 1st April - nobody actually knows yet. There is so much goodwill in the NHS, I genuinely fear what might happen should this go ahead. The next thing I’m sure will be making the boosters mandatory and that might be my time to leave 😢
👍
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHA  FINALLY. BRILLIANT TO SEE.  DON'T HAVE THE VACCINE 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Another truth speaker! And, sadly, another non-listener choosing to hide behind the credentialism of the so called experts so as to not upset his own confirmation bias.
Good for him. He has my support and my families well said 👏 ❤
If a doctor does not believe in efficacy of his own profession, he is in the wrong businnes and I do want him treating me. Surely he is on a disciplinary by now.
Huge respect to this doctor. This is what truth and basic common sense sounds like - the sound of which has been busily suppressed since this insanity began. Study Javids face and listen closely to how he reacts on being confronted by Truth - from an actual expert. Also as expected, the sudden face of panic on those standing behind Javid when this wonderful doctor speaks honestly. Of course, the absolute opposite of their intended narrative. Whenever the mirror is held up close and personal - when they can't run and hide - the truth always wins. which is why we need brave people - to be bold and stand for truth for the sake of all our futures. I have lost count now of how many healthcare workers quietly share how against these measures they are - some having given up their jobs already in the name of Truth and Freedom.
It appears scripted and staged.
The politicians just make it up as they go.  They have no clue at all.  God bless the doctor.
The opening seconds reminded me of that scene in The Office, Brent asking the new Swindon lot how they're getting on
👍👍👍👍👍
I salute this brave doctor.
What happens to "no jab no job"?
Propaganda is persuading people to make up their minds while withholding some of the facts from them. HAROLD EVANS
So this one Dr says he will not get vaccinated and everyone says "SEE LOOK! A DR ISN'T GETTING VACCINATED!" but yet the LARGE majority of doctors world wide say the opposite? People are praising the Dr because he's saying what they want to hear, not because what he's saying makes sense.
He’s absolutely spot on about the booster. Everybody would need one every few weeks if they have a short period of effectiveness, as they apparently do. This is unsustainable as you’d just be constantly be giving boosters all year round with a population the size of the UK’s.
Separation starts riots
"That's your view" impling it is not relevant. Savage JabKids is such an arrogant idiot.
He said it doesn’t affect young people that’s a lie and where is his duty of care towards vulnerable patients? Does he want to kill all the obese ? It really seems like he wants a natural selection of the human beings.
I wouldn't want him as my doctor
So he believes in vaccination, but only if they done far more frequently? Not exactly a revolutionary.
...a big bravo to doctor!!!!
It’s like gangster coming to collect his share, outrageous
Can I have your opinion please?  Yes it's opposite to yours alongside a way to make things fair  Moving on...
A seat warming chair farter with zero qualifications argues medicine with a doctor who obviously understands what he's dealing with. Seems like the norm now🤡
YES!!!!
This Doctor is a legend protect him at all costs 💯💯
This doctor is embarrassing.
I really would like to see which evidence this “doctor “ is talking about. The nurses are silent because he’s a psycho. Simple as that.
Obviously a dangerous trerrorist instigator
Sorry but we only take advice from the "vaccine experts"...who ironically are the very people who profit financially from the vaccine rollout
The nurses looked scared they didn't wanna lose their jobs
WHAT A GUY
Hah someone set the Health Secretary up nicely.
A lot of doctors had to speak out because they have the same views as this doctor has!! Those vaccines and boosters are more worse than Covid itself!!! Respect for this Doctor to speak out!!
this doctor is iconic
Well done doc. That showed him.
Lol.. hilarious this. Didn't know how to handle that did he
People are not free if the critical events of their society are systematically unreported or distorted. HOWARD J. EHRLICH, The Politics of Media Control, 1974.
It that was my son, I would be so proud of him. Well done x
THE SUPPOSED "VACCINE EXPERTS"SAGE ARE GOVERMENT SHILLS. ARE NOT INDEPENDANT, NON PARTISAN, WHO ARE PART OF THE CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE TO DEFRAUD AND ENDANGER THE LIVES OFTHE PUBLIC.   NOTHING WILL CHANGE UNTI,L THE MANY RISE UP AND HUNT DOWN THE MONSTERS IN PARLIAMENT AND SLAY THEM ALL.
Brave Dr !!!
Well....he wasn't expecting that was he.Should have asked santa for an emergency hole to swallow him up. "We've got our own experts" 🤡
NHS STAFF WHO ARE SILENT ARE COMPLICIT.
The doctors know! That this vaccine is bullshit. This poor doctor Wil lose his job for being honest which is sad.
Follow your heart. Not the “news”.  We must find Truth within.
They take the best advice from totally corrupt "vaccine experts". I'm 82 and will not have a so-called vaccine for so-called "Covid" because I have an immune system which, with judicious living, keeps me healthy. the whole set up is political not medical.
There are two major forms of lying: concealment, leaving out true information; and falsification, or presenting false information as if it were true. PAUL ECKMAN, Telling Lies, 1985.
I had both doses, booster and still had covid. We can't keep getting jabbed every 6 months, can we?
Absolute facts. Well done to this doctor for standing up!!!!!
What a brave man!
Sajid wanted confirmation that he was right then when he got dismissed he told the consultant that his opinion doesn’t matter because he’s not a vaccine expert lmao
Good for that Dr!
Get the jab for peace of mind
Excellent and lucid argument put forward but the consultant anaesthetist!
"we follow the science and advise from the experts" says the politician to the Dr... okay then.
Protect this man at all costs
This needs to be memed
Listen to the experts, remember?
I regret getting booster
Sajid: "we take the very best advice that we can..... from the people that are vaccine experts" Would that be the experts from Big Pharma who are making billions out of the vaccines? Or MHRA who rely on Big Pharma for their funding? The government does not take the best advice, it cherry picks science which supports their agenda and calls everything else Mumbo Jumbo.
I hope he keeps his job, i agree with the doctor here.
A reporter should have no personal agenda at all just objective reporting of a situation or opinion of others.
Good on the doctor!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMdpf8-7x0I
Am I the only one who is questioning if these nurses are nurses some of them could be doctors yk…?
Dr. Fauci is not a God he does not support true science, Dr fauci's is the one giving all the false information to the people causing chaos
Kings college hospital need to listen to the front liners who actually know what they’re talking about.
Strong 💪 man speaking out, and absolutely talking sense.   The egg head little turd has absolutely no answer, trying to force the others into an answer, because he’s a death salesman, those other colleagues agree with the doctor, but haven’t the balls to say.  Proper leader that Dr, protecting his staff and taking the stress himself, it was clear his staff felt the same.
When Sajid Javid says we have to weigh all that up for both health and social care is where the lie is, because it is not and has not been weighed up or discussed openly in any kind of scientific or honest manner. This is where the fraud lays in the continual upselling and pushing of vaccines all the while denying and suppressing other factors and data which might bring them into question, even when a new variant comes and exposes even further the limitations of such vaccines.
Stop looking to dr. Fauci for your information he is a liar
The vaccine experts? THE vaccine creator is telling people not to take it... So now what?
This doctor is amazing!  Sticking his head above the parapit like this.  I'm not anti vax, I've had 3, but I wonder now where it will end?
Someone that has had the disease and has gotten past it, has better antibodies then the vaccine, it's been proven by studies out of Israel, that it lasts longer than the vaccine by up to 8 months
Absolute respect to this Doctor.  Shame on the silence of the lambs.  "The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who remain neutral in times of moral crises".
Debate? Where ??? Well said that Doc💪 it's too obvious now what's going on....
“That’s your view”... turns away and asks for one that agreed with his Hahahahah FOOL
SNAP he gets his advice from the VACCINE EXPERTS! That was a frontline physician with research to back him up……… we saw what our vaccine expert Fauci did………It’s insulting that frontline personnel are not respected.
Good job for standing up! And thanks Sky News for showing this, it's the longest clip I've seen of this.
I'm in agreement with this hero
But won’t take advice from a doctor?
This says a million words!
And he couldn't give a valid argument back and he dropped himself in it... They have made a decision and passed something without admittedly 'weighing it up'. Imagine standing there and telling a trained individual capable of understanding 'the science' and having treated the presentations and behaviours of this all the way through.... We take the very best of advice.... His responses did not not correlate!!!!!
Wow they left the comment on.
As a NHS doctor, he have done very wrong because vaccines can protect himself and his patients, too selfish in his role now! If he is not a doctor( or key workers), he might choose unvaccinated option with less social responsibilities.
Well it’s true though he’s got immunity at the moment as he’s had covid. That actually make sense. But for people with no antibodies against covid, they need to be vaccinated. There are so many unvaccinated patients in ICU who are positive for 5 covid variants. Some of them have sadly passed away, others are still fighting for their lives.
Fair play to him.... This government has failed us. Always has always will
Medical experiment enforced by corrupted politicians
Boosters every month 😢😢😢these people will turn unto zombies period
Well done it’s his body and it’s his choice!!!
jesus christ this whole comment section is full of anti-vaxxers god help the world
How this issues should be resolved is the people many people need a new government, not allow some corrupted gov to control the lives of people, the only reason we have a bar government is people just accept it.
The Science is definitely not strong enough!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Then it became mandatory... that bald head cnt is just another puppet like boris, being pulled by some hidden agenda nonsense.  Also was it just me who felt many of thd staff where thinking "we ageee with him but are to scare to say"
It's totally wrong to force NHS staff to accept the vaccine. Just like it's totally wrong to force social care staff to accept the vaccine. Someone get this health sec outta here, stat.
The silent nurses are typical of people behaviour generally. They are either ignorant or lack the courage to  voice their concerns.  The propaganda campaign, blaming those who for a host of reasons don't want to be vaccinated, is staggering.  Question is, Where is the press? Media? Where are the journalists who should bring accountability across the board? Ridiculous to paint  Russia, China and other countries for being dictatorial when the western countries are in TRUTH the masters of misinformation.
Taking advice from Vaccine experts my hole, people who wanna make a lot of money ya mean 😂 At last a doctor talking sense but will just be ignored as usual!!
LOVE THIS!!!!
If Sky are publishing this, the narrative is changing.
the nurses 100% agreed with the doctor.
Well done him
Brilliant a doctor who knows what he's talking about talking to someone who's background is finance and doesn't have a clue but pretends he does......Sajid Javid is out of his depth its nice to see the walls are starting to crumble and the game is up !!
Those nurses remained silent knowing that far superior knowledge in the form of an experienced anesthesia Dr who did speak out. This retired RGN salutes those nurses  for not speaking out and double salutes that Dr for speaking the truth.
“We take the very best advise that we can.. from the people who are vaccine experts.” Desperate attempt to discredit the doctor who was simply stating the actual data on current vaccine effectiveness
Well done doctor 👏🏾
Get a Grip Javid. Take a Lemsip or a Beechams Powder, Cost pennies not Billions. Use the money to provide cost effective Utilities and better NHS and Social Care. Which at the moment are the big issues in this country along with people landing in Dover Daily. Hospital bed rates are being caused by lack of Social Care there are hundreds stuck in Hospitals all over the country. Who would normally be sent home and Care Workers and District Nurse would provide in home care. This creates False figures on daily cases verses numbers increasing in Hospitals.
Well said DOCTOR!!! Me too. I’m in the same boat. I have anti bodies from the very first most deadly virus. I don’t need a jab.
that is not "views" he shared facts !
100% respect for this Doctor...I think the best thing Sajid should have done was to listen and not try to undermine this Doctor at the end of interview....I guess this Doctor will now face the powers to be...🤔
I won’t even give explanation….they don’t deserve my expectations. I don’t like doing anything by force period…I choose death more than being force to do anything
Think this doctor is 💯 right well said doctor
Savage javid is so arrogant just waving off what an actual doctor says ,." We listen to vaccine experts" . Sorry but those experts are only interested in making more money for the pharma companies.
The doctor is lying about the duration of the vaccine efficacy.
Good on the doctor back him all the way
Look at the nurses 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 they're like "I know this is all BS but I've got a mortgage to pay"
Well done for this Doctor, he put some sense in to the minister.... Best advice means all In to line or else!
Well done doctor for speaking up, I feel the health secretary’s ignorance with his line... “we take the best advice we can....from experts” basically telling the doctor he’s not an expert, but I think the doctor makes more sense than the health secretary who’s job is to only listen to “experts” who also are capable of getting it wrong.
There is a reason why the death rate has decreased. Because many people have taken the vaccine. Yet some people think taking vaccine has no effect. Jeez
Balls of steel
Some of us have been saying this from the very beginning. T cell immunity can last for 90 years as shown by the research.
Please let my countrymen see this and wake up.
No Savid, S-a-g- e is not the best place to get advice; what about all the other top scientists that the Govern-ments  around the world have dismissed?
The Governments' experts do not want to debate with opposition doctors.They are hired to impose an agenda and this is what they will do. The Governments are going to put in jail all these brave doctors that opose the vaccin
Exactly Sir, well done for speaking out with the correct information is a bit sad that he still won’t accept the facts !
He's an anaesthesiologist not an infectious disease or pulmonary disease specialist and obviously he has his own views about the benefits for himself, but I'm not sure that others listening to him may have a full picture about whatever his full considerations were. I don't know if he's also considered how making a public statement serves to better inform others other than pushing for a choice for himself to continue working under new UK guidelines. But it does prove that not all established science leads to consensus and agreement.
Vaccine experts lol.
great doctor!! the people had fear to answer !!! nethertenless great doctor real man!!!!!
Well articulated points from the doctor.  Drivel from the politician.  Bet that doc gets his arse kicked for that though.  Hopefully not, should be promoted.
Finally a person wid sense is aloud to speak .
He is a spaz the dude is doctor on the front line he knows more than that idiot will ever know lock the dirty scummy traitor up
Wish my doctor had balls.
Ask the question then gets very defensive  :(
I trust the doctor, not the idiot.
Who is the vaccine experts, the ones making billions off it? Hmmm
I'm  proud of  this Man, well done,!!
What a brave man, I hope his courage inspires others to speak out.
I am vaccinated 3x and I think I have to respect that doctor if it works  for him.
Gollum looked speechless lol
A classic quote from Javid: "there will always be a debate about it". This, when the Government has consistently and forcefully tried to stifle ALL and ANY debate which is at variance with their narrative. And I say this as someone who has been double vaccinated (a decision which I now regret).
Javid is a moron.  He should resign immediately…
Omg what a superstar this doctor is 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 hopefully the red of the medical profession will follow suit!!! 💯 respect this doctor 👨‍⚕️
he probably voted for Brexit as well.
This Doctor is a Hero, well done for challenging the unscientific and completely political stance re Vaccinations This Doctor should be advising the Government   And vaccinations should not be now or EVER  Mandatory….’speaking the TRUTH is a Revolutionary Act”
Well done to the doctor sticking to his values.
Not all hero's wear capes he's willing to lose his job as a Dr to stand by his human rights how about stop bullshitting the public into this fake vaccine and booster bs he speaks so much truth exposing the bullshit government exposed here much .
It's okay not to be vaccinated  Just sign here please someone says  Then cames the terms and conditions
Key words here ladies and gentlemen are "we take advice from the people that are vaccine experts" Yes they are also cash experts too. Whilst standing in front of an expert on the front line form day 1. The scared look from the nurses tells it all. We need a booster every month lol 🤔🤔
Caw clap to him, he has some balls. To call the government out effectively 👌👏
Fair play doc !!! Fair play sky news for not censoring that .
Respect for this Doctor. Hopefully more and more health care professionals will stand up as time goes by. The whole thing is one big farce.  From day one they should have protected the vulnerable and let everyone else get on with their lifes.
A doctor with a backbone
The politician here is doing what's called "flapping" its a human behaviour that arises when someone is getting owned by facts meanwhile he's thinking about his back handers
Such a brave Professional Doctor saying what he knows to be the truth.  The silence of the nurses says it all.  So much RESPECT to these educated Professionals.!!!   The pharmaceutical Giants are making billions $ trillions £ selling this. Where will it end ?  What long term damage is being done to human DNA
Good on him, finally the truth is coming out 👍😊👍. The silence from the nurses says it all too.
That doctor is right. Good for him, for saying something
Someone should remind the Health Secretary that "EXPERIENCE is the BEST TEACHER" The DOCTORS and NURSES have all the "PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE" Day in and Day out someone with an "OPEN MIND" should "LEARN" to "LISTEN to THEM" We only stop learning when we Stop Listening to other people's *Point of View* and *THINK* that WE HAVE ALL THE *ANSWERS* !!!
A brave soul, well done
I dont get it,
He's not daft he must know about the contents of the 💉💉💉 varying from batch to batch.
This really shows the nonsense and discrimination that is currently abounding and destroyed at a stroke by someone more informed than the Health Minister. Doesn't that say all! Yet they continue this discrimination concerning travellers where unvaccinated travellers have restrictions,  costs and quarantine requirements and yet it is obvious that whether vaccinated or not one can equally be a carrier for the virus. Let's face it,  not many,  in the scheme of things, have had serious effects from the virus. This farago is globalism  and people control on an industrial scale.  Don't believe me,  then look at the annual death figures for the UK day from 2012 to present, look at the figures of death from flu.  Even an MP recently started in Parliament that the death rate of flu victims in a winter's day was between 250 and 350 persons. So take the mean of 300 and if one says einer is only 4 months that equates to 36000 deaths from flu.. whilst covid deaths which we know comprises such from Covid and with covid, so the figure is less has been 70000 each year.
The Good Doctor: "Youre not going to Vax people every month" Sajid Javid: "Hold my beer"
I'm very surprised Sky has put this clip out into public domain after 2 years of doing the governments dirty work and being complicit withtheir narrative of fear,cohersion & threats. Very well done to this Health Professional for speaking out like he did.The guy to his right whom I suspect was his senior in terms of rank was clearly uncomfortable that he spoke out.....the nurses stayed silent for fear of recriminations afterwards....This health professional did an excellant job of simply showing Javid for the phoney  liar he is.and this guy has one of the top posts in government.Clearly out of his depth and now people are speaking out against restrictions,rules and mandates. Time to have that discussion these politicians want to avoid around Natural Immunity?? Where are the rest of these Health Professionals that feel the same and that  the NHS and politicians want to keep quiet. With the data globally now showing that the vaccinated are spreading the omicron variant at a much faster rate than the un vaccinated people are now starting to ask "why do we have covid passports" & "why do we need more jabs"& "why don't we just stop all this testing"???

So that means, 10% of their staff havent and they are already sweating that 8% are, at present, in isolation. Oh dear!
He should have asked Javid exactly WHO they were being advised by and how much Pfizer pay them.
