@mowgs @CK_ANV
I like mowgs, but legit met a nitty that stripped him and robbed his coat and food, they burnt his ball bag with a blow torch as well in Northampton, I asked him on snap he said how the fuck do you know about that and deleted me 😂 it's confirmed
Mowgs needs to contact eyez and say sorry for biting his bars. "Up at the crack of dawn, just to sell the crack to dawn".   I rate mowgs but that's not his bar
Mowgz never misses
That crack of dawn bar got catted of eyez he spat that years ago on his jdz
Mowgs and Clavish need to link up!
Just supporting my bros lean habit literally 😢😢
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Drake type beat
Mowgs nines potter big link up com on
* In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.   (Genesis 1:1) * And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.   (Genesis 1:4) * And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.   (Genesis 2:7) * Thou shalt have no other gods before me.   (Exodus 20:3) * For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.   (Psalm 96:5) * For many are called, but few are chosen.   (Matthew 22:14) * These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.   (Revelation 17:14) * Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.   (Luke 13:24) * He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.   (1 John 5:12) * Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.   (John 3:5) * Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.   (Acts 16:31)
