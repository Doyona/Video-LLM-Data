The bogging is 21
Love how none of them guessed we had a number of teeth divisble by 4
The gag is they were all wrong about the seven half hours. It was 210 minutes. Seven half hours, so 7*30, not seven *and a half* hours
The worst part is I counted 32 but rounded up to 36 because my top row had 18 10:12
i love that theyre all wearing green shirts *and they act like siblings im DYING*
In the thumbnail the answer is 18 :) *I did not use a calculator so I may be wroung*

Thumbnail: 18 🤓
Doris is so me at math😂

"math is a social construct 😃"

Doris: math is a social construct, life is a social construct, to be real YOUR a social construct 😭
Not me getting 4230 min for " How many minutes are in 7 and half hours 💀
I learnt some of these before I turned 10. I agree that the American school system is TRASHHH.
I'm in Africa 😢😂😂😂😂❤
That’s true. Schools don’t teach Roman numerals like that and they need to I only know up until 5😂
The sun question i believe meant the actual light go through the atmosphere and touch earth wich doesn't take that long
this is the only trio that dosent have a duo in it
doriz looks a little bit like SZA🙂
At then end became an emotional movie
Mauna Kea's height from the base to summit surpasses Mt. Everest and takes the title of Tallest Mountain. While the altitude is 4207m above sea level, it measures 10,203 meters or 33,476 ft from the base to the peak. Btww!!(info from Google btw)
7:41 to skip ad

Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world
True it’s true
I ment to put q

Solid ligid & gas
It takes 8 minutes for the sun,s light to reach the earth I also know this because I have a high iQ
32 teeth I know this because I don’t stop studying
Jesus loves you all and he died on the cross for all of our sins and rose again 3 days later

Court I can’t disklike even tho I beat you 🌷🌺
I did guess 12:09
Wait a minute, the first question was: how many minutes are in seven half hours? How the hell is the answer 450 minutes and not 210? Like who the hell gave the answers?
I'm in 4th and I got it right😋
8:41 "lucky guess" HO- YOU PUT DOWN 343..
4:36 LMAOOO SOMEONE HELP DORIS
3:23 “Big Body Benz?” 🤣🤣🤣 5:43 10:37
The answer to the thumbnail is 18
3+3x3+3+3 BIDMAS or BODMAS is used  B brackets I indices D division M multiplication A addition S subtraction To work this out,you need follow the order from B to S 3+3x3+3+3 Multiplication comes before Addition so we work out the multiplication which is 3x3=9 Now we do addition,3+3=6 and then you have the 3 at the start  So,3x3=9 and 3+3=6 so 9+6=15 Dont forget your 3 at the start so 15+3=18 SO THE ANSWER TO 3+3x3+3+3=18😊 (Hope That Helps!😊)
Is my ahh dumb because I got 210 for the first one 💀
9:17 OMG. MY HEART DROPPED HELP AAAA
Nah but bro I said forty degrees before cause I thought that they were both high so I said forty and I was right True knowledge right here
I love y'all trio so much
10:42 LOL WHY WAS THAT SO FUNNY TO ME
The one in the pic for the vid is 15
Bro I love them soooo much theyre so kind (idk if its for the cameras orrrr) but when Courtney and Ariyan saw that Doris was like down bcz they wernt sining "reezy" again they saw sh was kinda sad or smth so they did it again (This is probably wayyyyy too long)🥰🥰😍
21
Ariyan writing a cute morning and post morning killed mè
WHEN THEY STARTED COUNTING THEIR TEETH I LOST IT
18:45
0:48 8:35 10:30
It's 18 in Germany we say "PUNKT VOR STRICH💀"
HELP ME ARIYANS FACE AT 14:04
I found this on Google A reezy or reezies are the best people on the internet. They are subscribed to Courtreezy and are automatically 10% more attractive than the average human being. Buying Reezy Merch doubles that. They are superior. It's just facts! Blame the science!
Ariyan-is this an inside joke? Doris-youre inside of the joke. BABEZZZ had me chuckling like a deconstructed giraffe
18
24
16:21  it’s mercury 😭
6:10 DoRiSsSSs!??!?!
The most iconic trio on YouTube 💅
12:03
Why are they all green it looks really good
For 3+3x3-3+3 = 12
THEY WERE ALL WRONG IN THE FIRST ONE
You guys almost made me doubt myself there for a second.  CORRECTION: Mercury is the planet closest to the sun, not Venus , Venus is the second closest and the hottest planet
Me and my best friends for no reason at lunch(and during class): 3:04- 3:34
This is easy 3+3 is 6 so 6×3 is 18 so 18 - 3 is 15 so 15 + 3 is 18 and the answer is =18
The title is 36 i calculated it myself
I’m in 5th grade and my new teacher taught us ROMAN NUMARALS on the second day of back to school 2024
doris had such a baddie intro 💅🏻
I'm sorry but like, how did Courtney get 5,900 minutes?  I thought she was calculating seconds by accident 😭  Wait... the answer to the temperature being the same in Celsius and Fahrenheit is wrong too 😭It's -40 degrees apparently, not 43.
Mathematica😂😂😂 3:42
I really thought y'all were gonna sing the that's so raven theme song I got all excited
12:13 it was not a guess I, earned it last year and I still remember it
For the thumbnail, the answer was 8 🤓
Bro for the science one for  how long does the sun take to reach the earth I got it right it was 8 minutes but she said I guess it 😭😭😭😭😭
12:14 no help😭 they all got it wrong and they said “how does that make sense?” To the easiest question in science history😭😭
3:04-3:35 git me dying of laughter and idk why
0:39 not doris in the confessionals😭😭😭
1:35 what was she drawing
THANKS COURTNEY I AM FROM SOUTH AFRICA (the best country in the world, no offense) I LOVE YOUR VIDS AND YES I AM A REEEEEZZZYYY I WISH I CAN JUST SQUEEZE YOU R !!👁️👄👁️😊❤😅
3+3×3-3+3=18
Ok for the Roman numerals am a 9th grader so yeah but, “XXX” means 30, “V” means 5 and “III” means 3 like 1+1+1. 30+5+3=38 I didn’t search it up but my science teacher taught us this so we labeled our documents and articles we read.
3+3×3-3+3=12
4.27 u put 75 instead of 7.5 lol
“My titties are north” BABES😰
I think the thumbnail answer is 18.
I was eating and I almost threw up😭

Me on the second question: 0,6
sorry to ruin the moment but all three of you had the first question wrong. they said how many minutes are in 7 HALF hours, not in 7 AND a half hour. you would have to do 30 x 7 which equals 210. not 7 hours AND 30 minutes! hope this helps love yall xx
40
8 minutes basic knowledge
This video made me feel dumb I HATE science
3+3times3minus3+3=12 check it on a calculator if you don’t believe me 😂

i just come back to these whenever i need to laugh 😭
Guys, I got 210 on the first question ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN I read the question as the number of minutes in 7 half hours (instead of 7 and a half hours) so i did 7*30 😅

Because it stumped me for half the video, I have to post the actual answer to the very first question.    "How many minutes are in 7 half hours?"  7 half hours is 7- 30 minute periods of time.  7 * 30 = 210 minutes.   Thank you, now I can rest.

15:36 it depends what it meant tbh. technically afro-eur-asia is the biggest land mass but yesh tbh i forgot about greenland and australia and said borneo 😭😭🙏🙏
I could never have predicted this video would have such an emotional ending and lesson 🥹😍
playing dumb when you're actually smart to overdeliver at the end is the smartest move you could make and the oldest trick in the book! all my nerds rise up
is it just me or did anyone see they were all wearing green?

"All I care about is north , south , east and west AND MY TITTIES IS NORTH"-Ariyan Reezy Rose

Im an expert at math and imedistely on the firdt question i answered "210" bc half an hour is 30 and 3 times 7 is 21 so 210. Love the video and i have been a reezy for a few months
I love how y’all are matching!
This is so sad 😂😢
The question that says what is the name of the triangle that is 90 degrees is actually a right angle
The thumbnail equation equals 18
Arian laugh so flipping cuteeee

Bruh I’m a kid and I got 38
3:57 Fish are actually really smart❤rawr

I thought the thumbnail problem is 6. Following PEMDAS
15:50 well Australia is a island (not a continent) but its not bigger thwn greenland
Why did I also get 8?! These were so easy! I can’t believe you didn’t get these rights! 🤣
Solid liquid and gas🌻

everyone got the first question wrong😭😭 it was 7 half hourSS not 7 and a half hour, it would 3:30 hours which is 210minutea
19:32 I felt so bad
"i'm starting a new SEGMENT called dum-" aaaaaand she never posts another video like this ever again.
Dorisxchi actually got the how many teeth does the average adult have question right
4:08 Courtney” Doris  don’t copy me” Doris “side eye”
I’m not even in 6th grade yet and I got almost all of these correct 😅
12:09-12:14 Courtney I love you so much and I am a ✨REEZY✨so please don’t take offense to this but I’m not even in HIGH SCHOOL yet and I got it right… 💀
I love how all of you guys are kinda matching in green
12:12 I knew it bcuz of a funfact.. (the sun could go out and we wouldn’t know until 8 minutes later.)
The nearest planet to the Earth is Mercury. For a long time, Venus was thought to be the closest planet to Earth. However, Venus is only the nearest planet when it falls between the Earth and the Sun during its course of revolution.
5:39 SHE DID NOT JUST GET A 6TH GRADE MATH QUESTION WRONG😨😨
Ariyan was wrong Venus is not the closest planet to the Earth and its not Mars either its actually Mercury research on google
HELP WHY WAS THE DRAWING ROSE DID OF A NAKED PERSON! IM DYING RN
You look in the comments even YouTube is a reezy😭🙏
Uhh we not finna talk abt the start

Omg you guys are all wearing green that is so fetch 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😍😍😍😍😍😍😀😀😀😀😀😀
If your wondering what the answer to the question in the profile is. The answer is 6
A big body Benz got me
the question that showed on the video is 27
i got 9 🕺🏾
No way they don’t know how fast the speed of light travels 😭 11:50
10:43 HELPPP
The only reason I remember Venus is closer than Mars is because of the "two moons". Venus looked like the moon at some point so.   Also Mars only was safer to live in because VENUS IS CLOSER TO THE SUN! THATS WHY IT LOOKED LIKE THE MOON BECAUSE IT ABSORBS THE LIGHT FROM THE SUN DKXIALALABSLla  Okay stop nerding self. I could even be wrong about all these theory anyway.
DORIS SAYING SORRY TO ARIYAN IS SO SWEET :,)
“You’re inside of the joke babe” 😂 that had me rolling on the floor
4:07 am i the only one getting 210.. it said half hours right?? doesnt that mean that its asking how many minutes are in 3 1/2 hours not 7??
Venus is closer but Mars is more habitable so that's why we're trying to go to mars first
this video always has me dying bruhh
My brother used to call me big body bandz not benz 😢
8:41 CHECKMATE. WITH THE GLASSES AND ALL😭😭
14:28 Mount Everest

5:53 shocked? girl u were petrified😂

i dont think everyone heard that doris said "lets just get to geography" on the angle greater than 90 degrees question 😭
1:24 😭

The random moan at 15:24 is crazyyyy

Courtney: I think my worse skill is definitely geography. Doris: Geography is not a skill.   Courtney: That's not a skill but I'm just not good at locating anything on a map.   LOLL
Arians real name is Essence I think because courtney called her that and it one of Doris's videos dorris called her Essence
It's the way they all got the first one wrong, but didn't realise it...  Pure chaos. 🙌

am i the only one that noticed that all of them got the answer wrong on question 2? it was 40(x) = 30, so to get the value of x you would have to do 30 divided by 40 which is 3/4 not 2/3
i was so confused by the first question  "how many minutes are there in seven half hours?"  me: half hour = 30 min.. so.. 210 min????   BUT NOBODY ELSE GOT THAT.. PLZ TELL ME IF IM WRONG OR NAH.
DORIS: No, thats not righttt ARIYAN: You counted wrong babe, and u got missing teeth to EAUGHADJG
I just wanted to say something venus and mars are both right because they are both next to the earth but in different sides
No
14:12 she got a little too excited 😭😭
its the way im almost a decade younger than yall and got that sun question right HELPP
No offense to Doris but she always looks like she is clueless especially when Courtney and Ariyan start "fighting" 😂
This video had me laughing 😭😭
Y'all so cute
Idk why but yall remind me alot like the chippets the girls from alvin and teh chipmunks  Courtney:brittany miller  Aryana:eleanor miller   Doris : jeanette miller  🤭😂
It’s 18
The answer is 18 for the one on the cover
3+3x3-3+3=18
answer  18
They don’t teach Roman numerals in my school district but I’m a mythology freak and love them. I’ve also seen multiple videos on the suns energy. My final score was  11 1/2 (a half because I changed my answer right before you revealed the answer)
Yoooooo I guessed fifty four and then when t was 54 I was shocked because I hate  Geography wait is it in geography to be honest I don’t care I only care I got the answers right… 17:16
It’s giving dance moms 🥰
waiting for the next episode.....
Wait… isn’t mercury the closest to earth
How does this video only have 1 like!? That’s gotta be a glitch cuz ain’t no way. These girls are the most entertaining group on all of YouTube just by having fun with each other! 😂
All i cared about was popularity but popularity didnt care about me FRRRR
(3x3)+{3+3)
Brooo, why is the math so easy, and im only in grade 7!
12:02 I literally said 8 minutes like what

3:02 this part got me dead. 10:23 11:34
They low-key remind me of the fairies from Sleeping Beauty. Courtney is like Fauna, Doris is like Flora, snd Ariyan is like Merryweather.
16:24 it’s actually Mercury ☹️
Why is this better than the Kardasions 😭
This is my favourite video on youtube 😂❤❤
I READ A FIRST GRADERS BOOK AND IT SAID THE TIME IT TOOK FOR LIGHT TO REACH THE EARTH WAS 8 MINUTES. A FIRST GRADERS BOOK. A FIRST. GRADER.
I’m so bad at math but I got half of them right then u guys did 😭💀
13:11 I literally said Washington DC, New york, California 🥲
This was hilarious, School is def a social construct and the cuts in between scenes like it was reality show was hilarious
It’s Venus got me dead
WHO MOANED 15:22
Roman numerals I feel like are pointless, yh if u have a Roman numeral clock but who is going to use them in the future for daily tasks, NO ONE.
This year is the most iconic year and no other replaces it many people see the bad in this year but many miss the good side. The fun we all had at home  I tried to make the most of that year at home and every time I am reminded of 2020 all I can do is smile
Doris:Hey hey shush 🤫 😭😭😭😭😭6:05
That is not a question so there is no answer

I’ll be honest, i put this on for ‘background noise’ and then I got interested and watched the whole thing, now I’m a Reezy.

2:49  “YOUR INSIDE THE JOKE BABE-“
“Thank you to all my high school teachers” but all of the questions were 7th grade questions or lower.
Ariyana rizzy rosè ✅
Doris" I'm actually pretty good at science you either know it or you don't and i happen to know  it
For the first one, none of you were right! The question was: "how many minutes are in seven half hours," not "seven AND A half hours." A half an hour is 30 minutes, and 30 x 7 = 210.
A 90 degree angles of a right angle but yo cares
Is that the book crush your hammering on??
I know what it is it’s 18 and I’m only in fourth grade😂😂😂😂😂
I had to dislike 😓  Nvm you thought 😂
The first question in math is actually 210 so don’t worry Courtney you’re not dumb
I love how you all are all wearing green💚
I searched it up and it said mercury was the closet. how is it venus?
I have 34 teeth
You should do a blupers video

Its 18
I did not guess the one with the sun because I watched a show and the main character had to run faster than the speed of light
2:49 till 3:37 is my fav part of the whole entire video
The first question is 210 minutes 😂
It was 18 I did the math in my head
Nah I actually got the Sun one right bcuz I watched a vid where it said that if the sun exploded then it would take 8 mins to reach us so I put two and two together so it takes 8 mins for the sun to reach us
me knowing it’s 8 mins bc i’ve watched this video multiple times💀💀💀
IT IS MARS THEY BE WRONG
Me 11 year old gets the sun 8 minutes right😂😂😂
not me lecturing courtney for not knowing how fast the speed of light is 😭
Math 1: 450 minutes 4:04  2: 0.6 repeating? 5:17  3: circumference 7:42  4 : 38? 8:09  Science 1: 32 or 33? 2: before midday and after midday? And now I give up…😢

That "EWOOO" made me feel you are nigerian like I am 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 00:06
ARIYAN MY GIRLIE ALWAYS LOOKS FIRE!!
15:56 did anyone notice that the answer is mercury
Me when we r going to mars bc of the structure of the planet rather than distance to earth 🫢
Its VENUS 😭  - Its mercaury 💀
When they said the tallest mountain was Mount Everest 😭 it’s literally only the tallest if you’re only counting mountains above sea level
The thumbnail equals 12:D
Doris: *puts 8 days* Me: Ma'am have you forgotten we see the sun everyday? WHAT DO YOU MEAN 8 DAYS- 😭
The question on the thumbnail,  the answer is 11
The roman numeral part, if y'all played Final Fantasy then it's comes easily
SHOOT SHE CAN SINGGGGG
The "MaThIMaTiTaS" made me laugh so hard that my brother and sis were like "the hail that sound coming from??"
Isn’t the question 27?
2:10 to 3:15 was so funny
best trio to exist fr.
Blueface and Chrisean suck and they need to be cancelled!
10:42 was my ABSOLUTE fave part
when y’all are together it’s a mess😭
“Um actually the first question said seven half hours not seven AND a half hours and seven half hours =3.5 hours which equals 210 minutes🤓🤓”
i seen this video over 10 times and each time i laugh like this is my first time seeing it. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
More than 1.2 million kilometres of cable—enough to stretch from the Earth to the moon about three times over—crisscross the ocean floor.
Not Courtney thinking 5x6 is 20
Roman numerals are considered math
45* x =30  x= 15
Do more of these please
NGL THO how did you get 8 days tho
I can’t believe I’m smarter than adults man 😂
Who else solved the problem on the thumbnail 💀😭😂
I'm sad my African people like me 😢
Doris:I got Mars Court: me too Ariyan:oh I have Venus Doris:.......... Court:ahahaha Venus anwser is...... Anwser:Venus Court:ITS VENUS Ariyan:OMG AH COURT IS STILL SHOCKED DORIS IS LIKE WHAT

5:44 I’m literally dieing eirg laughter now like muhahahahaha😅😂
3:21 this part got me soooooo much I literally have to play it over 1000 times BENZ
I love y’all so much omg.
When I got the Greenland one right I crushed the chip in my hand from excitement
12:09 i did get it right (holds head high like a proud kindergartener which i am not but you get what i am trying to express lol)
I love how the person came in the room and had the respect to try and go incognito and crawl behind, 🤣
But 7 HALF hours is 7×30 minutes I didn't see any "and a" in the 1st question. So none of them got it right....
The girl with the orange hair is right
Wait the answer is 210 right like seven half hours all together is 3 hours and 30 min now 3 times 60 is 180 plus 30 is 210 RIGHT
6:12
Is it just me, or are their shirts always the same color?
Why is everything in this video reliable😐...
I got all the science questions right Also me: I never pay attention in science  Almost got all the math ones right the Roman numerals one messed me up
15:30 SHE MEANS RAPA-NUI ISLAND?!? 😭😭😭
the answer is 450 i did the calculations
Wait I don’t know if I’m trippin but I got 18
2:02 why did you lowkey eat that note
Don’t second guess! I DONT EVEN HAVE A FIRST GUESS
Courtney:I think I’m gonna win, and that’s about it Ariyan:Dumba$$
Dear Courtney: I know that it take 8 minutes for the suns light to reach the earth because light can travel 186,000 miles per second. Now, why would a 10th grader who does average in school know this? Because I was bored of the education system and I decided to learn that on my own. P.S. I only got two of the answers in the video wrong. P.P.S. Mars is farther from earth with an asteroid belt in between both planets. Not only that but it is farther from the sun so it is controlled by less magnetic field. The main reason why people don't want to go to Venus is because it get's very hot there and it is not suitable to live there.
I thought i was getting dumb but no i got every single one correct except am and pm  I heard that for the first time
3:03 HAAAHAA “I RE-WROTE IT”😂💀💀  It’s so chaotic😂
None of you got the first one right man😭
seeing this rn im scared. what do they teach in american schools
If you think about it the sun rises in about 8 minutes. It doesn’t take 8 hours or  8 days  for the suns rays to reach earth 😂
Who else disliked and liked right after?😂😂😂
WHOS TITTIES ARE NORTH?
See the mountain answer yall picked both of the answers i was thinking.
for the question on which temperature is the same in celsius and Fahrenheit, the answer is -40 degrees, not 40 degrees
I love how they all are wearing green
WE NEED PART TWO LIKE RIGHT NOW.
12:10 I literally learned it at school today
18
8 minutes and 30 seconds 🤓🤓
i love love love the vids❤️ but PLEASE when using the timer can you do another timer sound because that timer gets me so upset from getting up in the morning on school days😂😂🙏🏾🙏🏾
10:38  *Doris turns into a straight up npc*
I still love yall
I'm 9 and I got the question about how long does the sun take to reach earth right😂😂😂
3+3×3-3+3 is 15
i got 10 right because i know that it takes 8 light seconds for the sun light to reach earth, 1 light second is equivalent to (roughly) 1 minute thusly it takes 8 minutres
Y’all are the cutestttt haha
Her: I don’t mean to brag but I was a math tutor    Also her: math is very hard for me I don’t know 2+2
When I tell you I cried while watching this  like I've never laughed so harddd😭😭😭
They are so hilarious😂
I got...    M:0/5 S:0/5 G:2/5
13:56 HELP
Ceence😂
There’s actually 4 states of matter, plasma
their personalities 😂❤
The way I laughed throughout this whole video 😭😂😂
inside joke😅😂😂ahhh
What big body benz mean ?
18:48  It’s giving Dhar Mann💀💀(if that’s how you spell his name)
The fact that there all matching green i luv them when they make videos together
BEST TRIO EVET
I guess I'm a bug
this video is very humbling. thank you.
12:05 hahaha, I said 8 min. lol yall said 8 days 8 hours, dude. I'm 12!!!!it's because I know science lol
Editing is so funny 😂😂😂
I'm literally so distracted by looking at Doris she's so beautiful
Whats geo graphy        😂😂😂
13:02 got me bro
Where's next part
okay why is no one talking about the coordinating fits thooo😍
16:19 wait, isn’t it Mercury??!!
She got it wrong because Australia isn’t real
3+3x3-3+3 = 18
“is this a inside joke?” “YOUR INSIDE OF THR JOKE BABE” Had my crying on the floor😭
1:58 PLEASE TELL ME YOU ALL GOT THAT!! I LITTERALLY LOVE THAT SHOW SM
meanwhile me who got a completely different answer after searching it up
11:13 THE WAY U AND ARIYAN R MOVING THE SAME WAY 💀💀💀💀
How did y'all get that much for the Roman numerals 💀  And I thought I didn't know Roman numerals lmfaooo
( I think this is right but it’s been awhile since I learned about Roman numerals) X=10? V=5? I=1 ( this might be wrong
Wow😂 she a comedian
This like they’re in a tv show 😂
it makes sense with the sunlight thing because i think that question wants people to think about the light waves and not just  all of its light at once so im guessing that each wave of light takes 8 mins to reach earth because of how far it is idk im just guessing if im wrong feel free to troll me and/or correct me
✨sciens✨
😂 😂 😂 yo this sht should be a whole dam show. Yall too funny
"DORIS DON'T COPY ME" gets it wrong while Doris gets it right
Big body benz 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Idk but I can see a collab between Bella rose and courtreezy
My favorite moments 2:09 "wait can we do it again" 3:04 "whyd you write stinky on my board🤨" 3:56 "no I'm dumb as a fish" 5:44 AWAAAAA💀 10:25 "and you got missing teeth😭" 11:34 "she was pinching me under the table"🤣

THE DRAWING AT 1:35!!!!!
Technically speaking, due to orbital patterns the planet that's closest to earth most of the time is Mercury. Same with every other planet in the solar system. For the majority of the time, Mercury is the closest planet to everything that orbits the sun.
I’m so dumb when the question was what planet is closest to the earth I said uterus🤦‍♀️
Are they siblings cause that's what the energy gives 😂
babe...i lost too so it doesn't count
Big Body Benz😭😭😭
planet near to earth correct
12:27 Ariyan laughing and then going back to sadness has me dying 😂😂

The thumbnail aryan rose was actually correct

SUN
its 8 minutes
X=10  V=5 I=1  so XXXVIII is 38
You guys always make my life better.  Example: I was working on a art project and I get distracted by basically everything but I was really focused on my project that I actually finished.
Nah cause y'all can't be making me laugh like this at this time of night, I'm suppose to be sleeping!!😭😭

M.Mental A.Abuse T. To H. Humans
The fact that the thumbnail shows 5th grade math - and I sat their and used my fingers to see what is was

Ariyan: I have missing teeth too~  Also Ariyan: I SWEAR I COUNTED 20 ON MY TOP ROW
3:13 I REWROTE IT.

OMD, UR SINGING AT 2:02 THO
Ok but Courtney got them vocals
Is Aryan's name Essence? I DONT UNDERSTAND IF YOUR USERNAMES ARE YOUR ACTUAL NAMES OR NOT
18:04 BRO THE PLOT TWIST
the reason that not all of the ocean is discovered is because what they haven't gone to is wide open nothingness. most or even all of the ocean floor has had a camera down there or a team.
LMAO EWO IS CRAZYY
Ariyan really said BIG BODY BENZ
Just so you guys know the cover of this video equals 11
I love it how Doris said sorry immediately after saying that to Ariyan😂
Me who memorized that LIV = 54 in Roman Numerals because I call my cousin Liv/Livvy (her name is Olivia) and when Superbowl LIV happened (Superbowl 54) it was written on the board and we (small children at the time, literally 2nd graders) were asked what LIV meant (I don’t think anyone got it)- and that’s how I always know what Superbowl it is………this year is Superbowl LVIII (Superbowl 58)
JUST OVER 1/7 INTO THE VIDEO AND I ALREADY BE GIGGLIN LIKE A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD UNDER THE COVERS PAINTING HER BESTIE’S NAILS AT 2AM WHEN I’M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE AWAKE ON A SCHOOL NIGHT SLEEPOVER-
I am dead 😭💀💀
Courtreezy: she won fair and Square yeah she won by one point but she won and it’s time for you to accept that loser 😂😂 Got me laughing so hard!
Everything about this was funny, adorable and wholesome 😩💕
the fact i dont know any of the answers
i learned that it was 8 minutes idk where
What does the first question mens like 7 and a half bourse or 7 half hours like 7 x 30 minutes
2:55 😂
AUSTRALIA IS AN ISLAND! 😢
The answer to the thumbnail is 18
Gerl it's 18
WE NEED MORE. \
#courtreezy you just look like Naomi Campbell 🌟❤️
Speed this up and it’s 10 x funnier
Ariyan: "I'm dumb as a fish"  Courtney: "Dumba**" 15 minutes later   Courtney: "I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A QUESTION RIGHT"
I'm a reeEEeeEEeeEZZzzZyY
im a reezy
I love how they're all wearing light green shirts
FOR THE EARTH QUESTION HOW TF WAS THAT GEOGRAPHY ITS SCIENCE😭😭😭
XD some of the "correct answers" aren't even correct. Greenland isn't the largest island, Australia is. Of course, the Mercator Projection makes Greenland appear bigger, but it is actually much smaller. It's not even a million square miles, while Australia is almost 3 million square miles. Also, I'm pretty sure the first answer was wrong, but they could have misunderstood the "seven half hours" as "seven and a half hours."
Answer is:12
“YOUR INSIDE IF THE JOKE BABE” GETS ME EVERY TIME 😭 2:53
The answer to the thumbnail is 18. At  least I think.
there is 4 forms of matter
I said 8hours
4:32 doris’s face 💀
Dose anyone think that the whiteboards they are using are the ones that Courtney stole from school🙂

Australia is a freaking continent
Is the answer 18?
PLS I SAID KELVIN TOO😭😭😭😭😭

I was the 160kth like!
This trio is amazing I can't-
They all matching that’s Bestie energy ❤🥰
Mars is closer

the fact that she said you got missing teeth it made me die
wow these are the most funniest friends i came across today
3:24  this is too funny
Are you from 🇳🇬?
I Googled what  nearest planet is near earth is it's mercury
I live in Australia thinking I that was right-
I know the internet thing from a tv show though…
I KOWN the question to the thumbnail  The answer should be infity
I love how they are all wearing green💚✅🍀☘️
The fact that I only noticed after watching the video for the 5th time that all of them are wearing green 😭😂
I didn’t dislike

KELVIN I'M CRYING HOW
You learned that it’s 8 minutes in 3 rd or 5 th so I understand how you could not remember that

It was not a guess I know it was 8 min
Not the dhar man music in the background
for the suns light one i got it right becuz it takes 8 mins and 19 seconds and i said 7 for continents in africa and im african

Man they 10 times smarter than me
The answer  to the cover to the video is 18
9:33 siense

The video thumbnail the number is 15
bruuuuuhhhhh i was playing the game and as we started i got the two first questions wrong 🤣😭     Question 1 i got 172 mins and for the second one i got X =  15  I wasnt 100% sure about my answer for the first question but for the second one im confused how Ariyan and queen reezy got X= 2/3.   So what i did was: 30 plus 15 = 45 then i reverse it to see if the answer would remain in whatever order it should be in , like this ....... 45 - 15 = 30 . So thats how i got X= 15 But idk how they get X=2/3 🥲
THE ANSWER ON THE FRONT BEFORE THE VIDEO WAS 13 AND IM WAYYY YONGER THEN THEM.
Naah when they said the answer for the second question
Please do a part 2
18? From the title!
Why y’all all wearing green?
Cute happy and amazing that's what i love about the video and it was really funny waen they did the math and geography keep it up

13:00 the answer is actually -40 degrees
When I saw the thumbnail I was like : IT'S 6!
Courtney:" If someone beats me at math they can dislike the video"  *Courtney knowing damn well YouTube removed the dislike button*   Courtney: " Y'all counting your teeth " 🤣🤣 Also Courtney: *Proceeds to count teeth*
you can tell it’s venus if you look at both the planets at night
this video makes me feel like einstein. thank you y’all

Ari Was right in the thumbnail
They really didn’t know it took 8 min
7:54 actually that's wrong cuz it's obtuse, straight or reflex
As a student in school, in genuinely angry
the second question’s answer was 2/3 but i said 2 divided 3 not realizing that it was the exact same answer so i thought i got it wrong-
3+3x3-3+3 =12
it was the start that had me cracking up🤣
17
Ariana was the closest the answer is 420 in the 7 hours thing
Ok so on The how many minutes are in 7 hours I got 10860 either my math got me fucked up or its cause did this
That embarazed moment when yr answer is diffrent than everyone else's in class😭😄but to actually figure you were right and they were wrong 🤣🤣
i confidently said 236 for the teeth thing 😍
Yall I'm gonna ace my test next week lol

this trio>>
I love rewatching this video ❤😂
this friends group reminds me of me and my friends
18 HAH
For the question about the counties of Africa, there are actually 55, the 55th being South Sudan. Because it is so new, a lot of news sources and websites don't credit it as an African country, but as time goes on, it is being recognized more and more. Because of this, it means that Ariyan was the closest, so she should've gotten the point.
I took Latin in 6th grade it was really fun so I got the roman numerals to question correct lol- Also Ariyan in my class we did addition and subtraction with them using Latin words.
“ITS VENUSS!!”
I don't think it's right for me to eat fruit and watch this I was eating oranges and I'll bust out laughing almost I almost choked I'm sitting up here trying to catch my breath cuz I don't know it was just so funny she was going to say thank you and she called her meat head I just busted out laughing
3+3-3+3=12
I guess im disliking the video -doris and me
yall are the funniest
This is my favorite video 😂💓
Everyone else just walks away sassy and Ariana is just laughing!
BROOO BOTH OF YALL WRONG ON THE FIRST QUESTION ITS 210
“All i care is popularity but popularity didn’t care about me”😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀

Courntey:one time dorris’s cousin called me a,a Arnary:A BIG BODY BENZ!😂 Sorry if I spelt the name wrong😅
Australias 4 times the size of Greenland. If you're basing the sizing of the world map its bigger because its a flattened version and the size of every country is wrong visually on the map. BTW love you court fav youtuber

When you counting teeth, its complicated. On the wisdom teeth, they might be 'split' in two, which you might counted as 2 teeth. Even tho its all just one tooth, and you mightve got a tooth taken out, like me. :')
The answernis 7 mins to get to the 🌐
I cant tell which one of you guys are the most chaotic
Me who got 210 on question one:
Wait the planet nearest to the earth is Mercury tho...

Hey                                                                                                                  Hi

hhello I am new to  your channel and you guys look so pretty! I'm starting to like this. you guys are so funny😂
Am i the only one who thought that AM stood for at midnight and PM stood for past midnight…😃✌️
Omggg u guys have matching tops
Did you know that if Australia is not a continent it would be known as the largest island on Earth due to the fact it is completely surrounded by water but according to Britannica it cannot be the biggest island because it is a continent but you would be correct if we did not have Britannica. And if we go further into facts about the tallest Mountain on Earth would be Mount Chimborazo if I am correct. Plus I think Mercury is closest to the earth.
18 I think is right
3x3+3-3+3 = 21.. I'm big brain
1:57
the thing about roman numerals is that it's pretty easy to understand if you were taught like its not that complex, but a lot of people just don't learn it
17:04
16:20  me when I didn't study for a test and I get an A+
I am pretty sure it is --------

doris is likea virgo
Lol the question about when the sun‘s light hits the earth my eighth grade science classroom learning about light for the past couple weeks so I knew that and it wasn’t a guess actually Hehehe but I love the video 😂😅
Ariyan is me literally
When they asked how many countries were in Africa I just said 54 as a guess and when they said 54 was right I literally called my mom to tell her that I was right, never learned how many countries were in Africa so I bet you it was the ancestors looking out for me. 100% guarantee
Ariyan: I was going to put 45 😞 Courtney: bUT YoU dIDn’T Doris: And you would have still been wrong? Ariyan: Yeah but I keep sayin- 😂😂

Doris is so funny
I think it’s in healthy how much I laughed during this video
Ariyan : “big body Benz” Me: *WHEEZ*
Venus is before Earth and Mars is after Earth that’s why it’s Venus
Courtney: Last name and…  Ariyan:Huh, Is this an inside joke  Doris: You’re inside the joke babe  Courtney: Last time she said her last name was Reezy and you said your MIDDLE name was Reezy  Ariyan: Oh, my middle name is Reezy Ariyan Reezy Rosé  Courtney: Why’d you write stinky on my bored  Doris: I couldn’t think of anything to,sorry  Ariyan: She say your breath stink  Doris: No,No,No,No,No please I’m sorry I’m sorry  Courtney: I’m so mad ok I’ll go  Doris: I rewrote it I rewrote it I rewrote I rewrote it!!!!  Courtney: Essence you’re an antagoniser,one time Doris’s cousin said that I’m um a what she?  Ariyan: Big Body Benz!!!  (Everyone  laughs)
Th video just started and we haven’t done any questions yet and I’m laughing so hard because of Ariyan and Courtney and ofc Doris❤😂😂
The thumbnail answer is the answer is 18
The answer to the thumbnail is 18
I actually calculated the thumbnail it's twelve ☠️

DOOO MORE OF THESE WITH THE GURLS!!!

Not the That so raven Song I watched that 10 hundred times
😢😭😭😭 I had to dislike the vid😭😭😭
i got 7 points 😔
This is my most favorite youtube video ever
Was I the only one who died when ariyan said what geograFIE
Did anyone notice how they say that a angle at 90° is obtuse angle but it's a right angle
Why did it turn into a Darr man video at the end XD XD
Well the tallest mountain on earth is actually Mauna Kea but most of it is submerged under water so Mount Everest would be wrong.
It equals to 0 I think
It’s Venus than mars
Part 2 is needed
201521
You all got it wrong about the ''closest planet to earth'' It's not Mars nor Venus, it's Mercury.
It's minus 40 degrees, not 40 degrees. 40 degrees Celsius is 104 degrees in Fahrenheit.
Me ahh yes 8 minutes without them finishing reading the question
Hi Courtney just for u to know Australia is a Country continent and island since it’s surrounded by water
I love how y'all all be wearing green
For the the three times is it 6? Idk im f stoopid
Wait why did i think it was japan
I'm bad at history🙃
lets just say ariyana rosé hacked the system i saw her ,i was the door
The first question's wording threw me off. I was thinking seven HALF HOURS (7*30), not seven AND A half hours (7*60+30).
I definitely feel smarter after watching this
1:57 was my fav. they're so good at singing 😭🤣
I’m just here to win I don’t need to talk hey you need to go back OK who invented math it was invented by the white men
I learned that and I’m not I knew it was eight minutes when if the sun explodes it’s gonna take eight minutes for the world to realize Dickinson thing is again I’m nine
I like your coordinated outfits!
Oh
10:00 THE QUIET COUNTINGG
8:05 I confidently said great angle
4:29 😭😭😭
4:07 BYE
1:52
Do more of these bc it's awesome
I never learned roman numerals! I never heard any of that mentioned in school, Ariyan was done dirty for this
They look the same. THEY LOOK THE SAME
I KNEW IT WAS GREENLAND. When I saw Australia there I was like: you are in for a big surprise, girls 👹👹👹
Answer is 24
Y'all are to much lmao 🤣
For the first one did she mean “seven and a half hours”? Because I got 210
Nahh I learn a lot from social media. I’ve been on social media since I was 4 yet the only questions I got wrong here were the Venus one & the Greenland one.. I said Australia too😞.     And before anyone says anything about bad parenting, my family was great. They were somewhat wrong for letting me have electronics but I wasn’t allowed on social media. I was just bad & sneaky🤣😭  (Edit: And I’ve noticed a lot of people say they don’t learn anything in American schools, we actually learned a lot. I have legit heard my old classmates say the same thing & I’d just be sittin there like “….MF U WAS IN CLASS WITH ME WHEN WE LEARNED IT!😭” I think a lot of Americans just forget what they’re taught because it doesn’t contribute to our survival😅)
According my investigation of google and school in 15:55  the correct answer is Venus and Mercury but I do have to say if you see on a google image its Mars but no actually its Mercury and Venus because if you see the kilometers and meters its Venus and Mercury cause earth is in between them and if it was closest to the sun its Mercury . {also love you guys so much <3 }
11:09 a cute morning post morning had me dyinggg
4:31 BRUH SHE WAS LOADING I WAS LAUGHING SO HARD WHEN SHE SCREAMED😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

You all are so dumb!!! Wow 😮 and I can say that because all of you went to school.
Babes isnt 90 degrees a right angle...
“You’re inside of the joke babe”😂😂😂😂😂😂😂no that was funny
Doris and courtney look so mich licke each other
Okay good congratulations go carnty
Okay good job all
MORE!!!!!
12:12 I got 8 minutes right because I remember the fact that said, “if the sun exploded right now, it would take 8 minutes for us to realize”
Isn’t it infinitely?
hey courtney! I saw ariyan look at your whiteboard  - Mrs. snitch
Courtney needs to come to SA
i literally got the same points like doris got
I can’t get over “BARACK OBAMA ✊🏽” Ariyan is so hilarious bro🤣😂😂
I'm pretty sure I got more right than them and I'm in 7th grade 😂
Its 18
I will not dislike this video
Africa has 55 countries ma am
I'm disappointed
We are just ignoring the person who crawled across the floor 😭🤣
ok this is hysterical
“i cared about popularity, popularity didnt care abt me” why is this so true 😭
DORIS HOW WOULD THE SUN TAKE 8 DAYS TO RISE IF IT RISES EVERY DAMN DAY??????????
Courtney don't fell dumb the first thing that came to my mind is Appalachian Mountain
15:20 no bc i know someone was going to say Australia😭😭😭
I LOVE THEM AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP SO MUCH BUT HOW IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THEM MATCHING CLOTHES COLORS!!!!???  SO CUTE!
yall don't know how fast light travels o-o... and im 9
The answer to 3+3x3-3+3  =18
how did i get them all- 💀💀💀
what what
This was the first video I watched from Courtney this made me sub
The fact Doris answered what’s three plus three
not the dhar man moment at the end bahhahahhaa
I think the answer for the thumbnail is 18
I luvv how they match their fits so cuttee🤍🤍
18??? DONT HATE ME IF I GOT IT WRONG
420..... is the first
my lil sis is 10 and she knows the first question from the geography
10:26 32 probably didn’t seem right to you, because they’re counting your wisdom teeth, which most people have to get removed. Without have 28
"And my titties in north." IM SOBBING ARIYAN WHAT??
PLEASE DO MORE
38 babes
EWOOOO
I knew mt. Everest was the answer and I’m going to 4th grade
Whoever told Courtney that Australia is a continent has no braincells 😔
no one gonna talk about that guy/girl that just crawled in??
3:21 OMGG 😭😭
I am gonna be honest, I did the math in the thumbnail and Ariyan Rosé is actually right. Remember that you have to multiply first ☺️
The reason people ain't talking about Venus or want to go to it because it's the hottest planet in the solar system mercury has no atmosphere so it doesn't take the heat. Btw Venus has like acid clouds and volcanoes.
I love how they match
I only got the sun right cause I was thinking light travels faster than anything so yeah
2:02 was goooddd 2:09
Points:   Courtney: 4 Doris: 7 Ariyan: 8
"School was made by the white man & we need to revolt." - Doris 2022  Me: Um, Doris, that's a little extreme 😭💀 (Yall are amazing btw)
Team tshirts when? I need team T-shirt when? I need a team Ariyan one
Obtuse Lmao
I love how their just hating on each other
2:11  PERFECT NOTE-  when doris said her reezy, you cant tell me that it didnt remind you of a lidl till opening.

11:12 court and ariyan were so symmetrical in this wow
How long does it take for the suns light to reach the earth: 8 days  💀💀💀💀
I know this was kinda a while ago but this is the most funniest video ever! I was cracking up the whole time
yall are so dumb please💀💀love uuu💖
I hate math tbh idk why it’s rlly hard-
Not me trying to act smart..
0:50 ICONIC
“Why did u write “stinky” on my board?” BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH THAT IS SO FUNNY I FELL OFF MY BED AND HIT MY HEAD BUT I DONT THINK IM OKAY 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The thumbnail answer is 18
y’all should rank tiktok thirst traps. you should also do a kpop edition (you won’t regret it).
Amazing 😂
I thought the first question was "How many minutes in 7 half hours..." as in 7 × ½ = 3½; 3½ × 60 = 210.... lmaoooo
My school prepares me from Roman numerals
Big boby benz 😂😂😂😂😂
I got 8 minutes cause I know
The question on the thumbnail = 18 I’m 13 btw😉
18:51 WHAT THE DISNEY MORAL OF THE STORY WAS THAATTTTTT😭😭😭😭actual tears💀
I already knew it only takes 8 minutes for the sun to come to earth at a young age
Am I the only one confused on how 7 half hours isn’t 210?
Answer for the thumbnail is 12
Okay so the Australian one has the most simplest explanation A large landmass that is seperate by a massive body of water.  It is also not an island because of it's massive size.  Greenland is NOT a continent because it isn't it's own tectonic plate it shares one with North America.  PS. Australia does have a tectonic plate
When I tell you that I was dying rolling on my floor 3 mins into this video 😭😭😭😭help
The answer is 18
The one on the thumbnail is 18
Um 😶 I’m 11 and I new most of those questions
Courtney can you renew this segment😭
the alarm is giving me trauma im scared
Mount Everest is acually the tallest peek not mountian
I LOVE the inclusion of a confessional after each question. High key, I have legit watched all of yal channels for three days straight. I am more hooked on yal than on phonics <3
Venus is very hot and Mars is not there is a song that says I’m closer to the earth in distance and some and it’s talking about Venus just look up the planet song
I love this 3 sm😭✨
This is the definition of trios can work
The thumb nail is 18-
who does not know that 2+2 = 22 who does not know that
The answer of the thumbnail is 27
Ya'll an actual VIBE 🤣🤣🤣
I started watching them today and they are so funny
POV you are in grade 5 and you know how long it takes for light to come to earth
I got the 8 minutes right, and no it wasn’t a guess 😌 lol
my fav part it 16:27 the way she was laughing
Isn't the answer to the first question 210?
My best skill in school was covering my body fat - got me dyeing 🤣😂
There all so BEAUTIFUL !!
10:31 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i love math but im bad at math
I thought I was smart. Now I know that I’m not graduating
Ariyan: “ *I personally think I am good at science cuz I made a lot of things explode* ”
Not Ariyan slaying the game btch
11:06 cracked me up I died when Courtney loss track of time and looked at the timer and she died when it hit 1🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's OK Doris I think I got it wrong to
OK so kind of like Ariyan My teacher call me 1 time looking over my shoulder and then she literally got these white boards and there are like covering every single person so all I had to do was just ask for pencil and then no look for it now just like oops I don't need any more
POV you are good at a hard subject and you watch other people's answers be like : 🥱🥱😒😒😏😏🤣🤣🤣
Jesus loves you so much and desires a Father and Son/Daughter relationship with you. Please repent and turn to God for he is the way the truth and the life✝️
Jesus loves you sooo much and wants to build a relationship with you🫶🏼
We love a Dharman conclusion to this video!!❤
0:33 The word "challenge" sent me back to 2014 *instantaneously*  Ice bucket challenge? Milk challenge? Takis challenge? Draw my life challenge?  Lord help me I'm getting old
Nobody: Actually Nobody: Doris: *"SCHOOL WAS MADE BY THE WHITE MAN AND WE NEED TO REVOLT"*
I knew that it took 8mins since I was 7 ^^
"My worst skill is geography" truly an american lady!
But like I googled it, Mercury is closest. So Doris won and that’s on Period. Lmao 🫥🫣
LMFAO THE BIG BODY BENZ COMMENT KILLED ME HAHAHA
At one point I started playing along and I was so hyped when I got the African countries question right 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹😭
"School was made by the white man and we need to revolt" -Dorisxchi 2022
You know not all Africans are black......
ok but the answer for the first one is actually 210 not 450. The question was worded improperly. it said seven half hours (as in seven groups of half hour increments, totaling 3.5 hours) not seven and a half hours (totaling 7.5 hours).
Isn’t the closest planet Mercury??? 😭😭😭😭 I deadass looked it up as I was watching I’m pretty sure it’s Mercury Ms Reezy 😭😭
You are right it was a guess
I think I disappeared... Sorry(my name is lydia)
"In my book, I'm right."   ~Doris 😎
If you put this video in 2x speed, it’s even funnier.
I I studied most questions in school
Y’ALL ARE SOO PRETTYYYYY❤️
I’m laughing with y’all haha hyunygvecedwsxqoim
I LOVE YOU GUYS
9:22 "No you can- you can just stand-"
honestly in sus of professor Wilson like why u hurry like out the room and how Lydia never told me about she was doing the thingy with prof Wilson?     that's sus
Courtney: the two smartest people I know! Doris:I'm just an illusion babe
Courtney: One time Doris's cousin said that I'm... um.. a.. what she say? Reezy bu- Ariyan: BIG BODY BENZ Courtney:😐🙂 Doris: *Runs away weezing* Ariyan: *Dying of laughter rocking back and forth*
Bro I'm 11 and I knew how many minutes was i n 7 hours and 30 minutes
AUSTRALIA-💀
Wait, the first question was "how many minutes are in seven half hours?" Wouldn't the answer be 210? Cause it's not seven AND A half hours, it's just seven half hours. A half hour is 30 minutes, and it's asking for 7 of those. So 30 x 7 = 210
Noone:     Me trying to figure out what the question in the thumbnail is: "so I got 24 somehow- I believe it's correct-"
who doesn’t know that it takes sunlight 8 minutes to reach earth 😭😭
3:07 the big body bens 😭😔
Doris freaking funny hahaha when the part that courtney said "fight each other" instead of fighting just walking out and got stopped by ari AND ITS FUNNY
Doing it with them is fun 😆 I stopped at the first one 1. 450 minutes
OMG CONTINUE THIS SERIES
I keep watching this and the question how many teeth do the average adult have was in my math lesson so I answered it and everybody was confused how I knew it and I didn't tell them that I learned it from here they all just looked scared
3 months later and I still think it’s hilarious how the changed the “That so Raven” theme song to match the challenge. 😂 Also how their all wearing green shirts!
These videos makes me feel like I’m part of the friend group and I love that 🥺😂
“I love you and PEE!”
8:40 “💅checkmate💅”
YALL IT WAS MERCURY OML
I can’t believe you actually made me laugh and cry at the same time my family was like 😶

"Ariyan: and my titties is north" got me😂😂😂😂
Courtney I got all of them correct and somehow, you, probably more than eight years older than me; didn’t. Lol
i literally love the challenges and videos with you 3, please do more!

The fact that y’all are matching tho is everything slayyyyyy
I have to dislike
Fun fact: mnt Everest is not the tallest mountain! It’s the tallest land mountain, but there’s a mountain bigger then it that half of it is underwater!
The way I remember north,west,east,south. I point at North and say never, then point at east and say eat, then I do the same for south, I say soggy, then I do the same for west, I say worms. So its never,eat,soggy,worms!
Is it 18?
Like if they're all queens 👑 ✨️💞😌💅🏽
1:59 THE VOCALSSS GIRL😭😭
3:09 ari laughing her ass of, Doris panicking, court being offended💀
I swear when I heard Doris’ answer to x was 60 I was just tryna drink my water. AND I CHOKED ON IT AND IT CAME OUT MY NOSE Y’ALL I CAN’T
when ariyan said she was going to put 45 cortneys face when she said "but you didn't" was  hilarious
Idk. Idk these words idk none of this. Not a thing. Idek what a right angle looks like
In the thumbnail the answer is 18
Ariyan REEZY rośe
Tell me why Ariyan is literally so cute- 😭💕
You guys are dumb for not knowing it was 8 min
The answer to the thumbnail question is 6-
omg. I'm following along and I-- THAT FIRST QUESTION, ISN'T IT 210?! Seven half hours. 7 x 30?! 450 would be how many minutes are in seven hours what I-- LADIEs LOL?!
ariyan is so cute love her
11:50 this one is easy, Obviously, 8 minutes. If it takes 2 years for the speed of light to get to the nearest star, then it takes 8 mins to reach earth.         edit: dont ask me where i know 2 yrs for the speed of light to reach the nearest star, i just read a specific book i wont tell you.
the amount of times i choked on my saliva from laughing is a crime.
2:00 amazing voice ❤
12:10 I been studying about planets my whole life so i got it right
gurl why did you keep tucking your thumb 🤣
I love how they say mean jokes about each other but they don’t take it seriously and personally they take it as a funny joke
I actually knew about the cables from university. Their is a lot more than you think.
2:01 Why is no one talking about how great her singing was in those 3 seconds.
nobody:             courtney: Literally getting  possesed by roman zolanski
3:38 “Matematikas” *sigh* **Opens comments**
Disliked the video gurl. 5900 minutes arr in 7 and a half hours?! Gurl I-.....
Me sees thumb nail         18
12/15 babes 😘😘😘😘 never felt better 😋
wait isn’t 7 half-hours 210 minutes??? girl i-
A 90% degree angle is a right angle
us canadians knew all the answers especially the conversions between f and c degrees
This made me question what i learnt😢
5 minutes in and im already dying of laughter
Wait I learned and study for months on how Venus was the closest…it’s actually *Mercury*
Part 2 pleaseeeee
Thanks for this 🤣🤣🙏💞
13:29 LMAOO
11:22 BWAHAHAHAH
Did she mean to say Seven and a half hours or Seven Half hours cause they got all that wrong if it was Seven Half hours
big purr
If the sun's light reached the earth in 8 hours/days we would all freeze to death 😭✋
When the roman numerals came up that was xxxviii I knew the answer right away and the rest of the math was hard for me except for when it came to geometry, and i got the sun question right, the sun is 94.313 million miles away and light travels 186,000 miles/second so if u divide 94.313 by 186,000 u would get 8 minutes, and im in 8th grade and ik this
No it was not a guess. Cuz I did pay attention in class ( sry if that sounded rude 😭🥲)
The small one with red hair is so pretty
Courtney having a inspirational moment   Also Courtney : and it’s time for you to accept that loser  Got me crying of laughter
3:23

rewatching this video like everyday 😭.. idk what’s happening LMAO
I got most of’em right lol.
i got so mad at the thumbnail cuz it’s 18 😭😭😭
Courtney:Look at y’all counting your teeth!      * proceeds to count teeth *
Bro, tell me why I was screaming the answer at the screen and no one got it right. 😭
how dare you not know how many countries in Africa... just kidding anyways love ur vids girl keep the up!! U guys make me laugh😂❤💀
Ariyan "big body Benz"😭😭🤣🤣😂
To solve the equation on the thumbnail, it’s 19
but what if i DID know that it took 8 minutes 💀 that was what i thought basic knowledge was tbh not to be rude or anything im sorry if it came across that way 😭 <333
“School was made by the white men and we need to revolt” RIGHT
I love ariyan rosè so muchh
Poor Doris.. she don’t deserve this , she was just tryna be on key  Btw no hate! Love y’all!
“I’m dumb as a fish” bro what😭
40°C is over 100°F…I think the answer was -40 maybe?
the roman numerals one is math bc you do have to add them to get the answer lol
Mount Everest isn’t actually the tallest mountain in the world, it’s the tallest one we know of.
9:22 who tf crawling on the floor 💀
3:04
not me picking venus because of the fact that it reflects light from the sun/moon and we can see it from the earth
slay queen
I DID get it right on the sun question because I DID know that answer COURTREEZY. Being a space nerd comes in handy.
Actually I learned the Sun light reaches. Earth in 8 minutes at school
16:20 the answer is both mars and Venus lmao 💀😭
are we not gonna talk about how good courtreezy sings like omg love you :)
Thumbnail answer 18
yall share that  sister humor that i love istg you guys need to post together more
I loooove the coordinated outfits! Green is all ya'll's color <3
Ok if this is wrong then don’t hate on my I’m going into 5th grade soon but I’m pretty sure they all got the first question wrong because it said how many minutes are in seven Half hours NOT how many minutes are in seven and a half hours so to get the answer to that you could do 7x30 and that equals 210
babes it's -40
Did you know Greenland doesn't get any sleep
XXXVIII is 38 😀 I learnt in class 1

10:06
I almost choked on my food cause i was laughing too much
Do these moreee
I don’t know if you did this on purpose or not, but I love how you three are wearing the same shade of green. It’s so cute 🥰
XXXVIII = 38  X = 10  V = 5   I = 1
As a nerd, how do you solve 45 times x equals 30? All I got was like 0.7
3:05 had me dying
I’m the first girl that have a math quiz
Y’all.....is it just me or did they all get the first one wrong
i thought am was at morning and pm was past mid-day 😭

When it said what do you call a angle greater than 90° I almost said obese💀
Doris I said the same thing on the fkn temperature question 😭
Half an hour is 30 minutes- multiply that by 7 and isn’t the answer 210 minutes? Am I dumb 😭
APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS 😂😂😂😂

12:48 -40
12:10 It wasn't
4:01 the fact that they all read the question wrong so they were all wrong-
Ok, I don't know if someone's gonna read this comment, BUT whyyy isn't there more videos like this on the channel???!!! It's so creative and funny and different! I don't get it...
A 90° angle is not A obtuse angle is a right angle
y’all during the planet question i said mercury and was SO confused when you said venus was the right answer but it actually is mercury not venus 😭
Why am I still in school and had no idea how to do the math problems 😭😭
Pls do more of the answering questions
But 40C is 104F ???😭
When your blood type is F

Guys aren’t they all wrong at the first question? How many minutes are there in 7 half hours (not 7 & a half hours) ? A half hour is 30 mins; 7 x 30mins = 210 mins   Or I’m the dumbest LMAO
I shouldn't even laugh I can't read clocks Also, *screams and cries in science fan*
How do people not know this stuff? It's not that hard!
why am is this giving mean girls-
On the first one you said "seven half hours" . In that case it would be 3 and a half hours and 270 minutes.  On the other hand "seven and a half hour" would be 550 minutes.
“u counted wrong plus u got missing teeth” HELLP SHE SWNDING MEEE
Answer 1: 450 Answer 2: im only 12 idk know this. Answer 3: circumference Answer 4: 38  SIONC. Answer 5: 32 (28 if wisdom teeth get removed) Answer 6: Post Meridian & ? (Couldn’t catch what they said) Answer 7: 8 minutes Answer 8: 40 degrees  Answer 9: Solid, liquid, fas  GEOGRAPHY  Answer 10: true Answer 11: Mount Everest Answer 12: Greenland Answer 13: Venus Answer 14: 54

my name is TT and the space question was wrong bc the news created a sentence to remember the planets and its my-mars very-venus  educated-earth mother-mecury  just-jupiter served-saturn up-uranus noodles-neptune  or the Mars and the mercury is swapped together
12:11 I genuinely got it right and didn’t guess but don’t be callin me a know it all because that my or may not have been the only question I got right I KNOW IM DUMB 💀
i like how they are all wearing green , i love this trio 💀
My Quimestry and Physics teacher used to tell us that if the sun exploded we would only know after 8 mins and die so yeah i wasn't a guess kkkk
for the 8 hours 8 days things i literally said “idk 8?”
Hon suggested for the video grab the girls play hide and seek And whoever gets caught has to answer a math science And whoever gets caught has to answer a math science or geometry question if you get it wrong then you lose 10 points and you each get 30 point To start with
Question: what is a number that is the same in celcuis and degrees? Doris: *K E L V I N*

I was counting my teeth with themm
40°C is 104 Fahrenheit. To get from Celsius to Fahrenheit you have to multiply by 9/5 and add 32.  (40x9/5)+32=104 So there is no number that is the same
THAT BOOK ARIYAN WAS HITTING I READ THAT BOOK LMAO
I CANT WITH ARIYAN "what is geo-graphy?"
I got the 8 minutes right because I aced science 😍
istg doris so beautiful
I avoided with video for like 1 or 2 months after I saw it came out but now I feel like coming back for some reason lol
THIS HAD ME CRACKING UP😭😭😭
I guess your friends aren't very smart JK
courtreezy: and im the winner of this game  ariyan:  No No NO doris: SIKE JUST KIIDDING
Am I the only one that caught that the first question was “how many minutes in seven half hours” and not “how many minutes are in seven and a half hours”? So technically,  none of y’all got it right cuz the answer is 210 not 470💀💀💀
PLS I LOVE ARIYANS LAUGH
9:47 not me deadass saying "261" without questioning it. The average adult has 206 bones tho and I kinda sounds similar so I think that's where I got the idea from
Courtney is definitely a Nigerian
The thumbnail ans is 18 so ez
2/3 people voted Courtney as the winner and she got the lowest score
I ment you got violated
You got
I love you guys ❤️✨
12
3:21 thats all i need to say
i cannot even lie i didnt stop laughing the entire time lol
When you live in australia and you've been told your whole life its an country, continent and an island????? Have I been lied to?
Light travels at 1,000 miles per SECOND so yes it does indeed take only 8 minutes for light to reach earth’s surface
the planet one is actually mercury
The thing about roman numerals is that you kind of have to do addition to get the number, so in a way it is math with a mix of algebra if you see the symbols as variables with X's representing 10s, V's 5s, and I's representing numbers up to 3. If an I is placed before a symbol such as X or V it is considered subtracting from that amount, so IX would be 9 and IV would be 4. If it is placed after, it is considered to be adding to the symbol, so XI would be 11 and VI would be 6. So XXXVIII is 10+10+10+5+3 (or 8) which would be 38. In conclusion, the Romans were extra

“I would say my greatest skill in school was definitely learning how to hide my fat.”   IVE LITERALLY NEVER RELATED TO A SENTENCE MORE WHAT THE FUCK LMAOOOO

It’s 6 bc of Pemdas
I love when all of you guys do videos together. the energy is everything.
I got the 8 minutes one and it wasn’t a guess like do y’all’s science teachers teach you that in middle school? I learn it in 6th grade 😃
Omg you should make more vids like this,I am very surprised ari won
The thumbnail equals 18
Ariyan: "BIG BODY BENZ" Ariyan & Doris: "Hͥ̽ͣ̃̔Ḛͭ̉̇͟Hͥ̽ͣ̃̔Ḛͭ̉̇͟ S̵̙͕̀̃D̶͔̭̪̻Hͥ̽ͣ̃̔S̵̙͕̀̃Hͥ̽ͣ̃̔Hͥ̽ͣ̃̔D̶͔̭̪̻G̩̱ͩ̏͜S̵̙͕̀̃A̷͙ͭͫ̕" *SEAGULL NOISES*

12:09 I read that fact in a book so I got it right sooooo…sue me 🤪
Yes, you finally got 3,000,000 Subscribers!  You deserve so much more.
I'll  be answering all the questions in the video as I watch! (Y'all I'm twelve, I ain't no genius) Answer is 32 for the question in the thumbnail. Answer is 450 minutes for the second question. I think the answer to the third question is -15. Answer to four is the circumference. Answer to five is obtuse. I don't know what six is tbh.
I like how they all matching with green
OMG BEST YOUTUBER OUT THERE, U MADE ME LAUGH THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE DAM VIDEO LIKE BROOO. KEEP DOING VIDEOS AND UR FRIENDS ARE SO FUNNY.

ariyan out here giving great advice👩🏽‍🏫
i misunderstood and said kelvin like doris as well😭
I love the constant roasting of each other. It's always funny to me that the more you get comfortable with a person the more you insult them...for fun of course 🤣
Bro every 11 year old who has a science class knows how long it takes for the sun's light to reach the earth 😭😭😭
How did I know the answer in geography I'm in 4th grade almost in 5th grade in August (it's a public school and they don't about geo that much)
“All I cared about was popularity, popularity didn’t care about me”                                                                             - Ariyan 2022 ✨

Nothing times 45=30
The 3 math problem on the thumb nail the answer is 24,
I actually knew it was 8 minutes 💅
L LOVE YOU SO MUCH YOUR SO FUNNY
It's OFFICIAL! I AM JOINING THE REEZY QUEENDOM!
90 degrees is a right angle not obtuse
For math 90 degrees is called a right angle not obtuse
I got the celceui and feranhaight question correct

i still have to do one of those teacher thingys for me to remember to north, east, south and west- like i gotta do "never eat shredded / soggy wheat"
THEY'RE CALLED MOÁIS GHWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
12:10 no babe i know that because i know that if the sun exploded it would take atleast 8 minutes until we would find out about it but not everyone can have access to that knowledge so you getting that wrong is valid
Lmao, it was the Ewooo for me😂😂
I’m still waiting for part2
It’s them counting their teeth for me 😹😹🌚
Ariyan is the kind of person that said she didn't study for the test and then gets straight A's
Not me being like "it's eight  minutes"
Nick. Ah
THIS WAS SO ENTERTANING I CANT
youre channel makes me laugh so much and it makes me feel so much better. i have a really hard time finding things funny but seeing you and your friends laugh and make jokes makes me happy and laugh. thank you so much

the suns light is always on the earth the earth just rotates
This group is the besssst 💅💅
oh this was the day b4 ma bday
lol so people want to go to mars instead of venus because on venus it rains acid and there's even more dangerous things there. mars is more similar to earth because of the landforms, four seasons, and many other reasons. even though mars is half the size of the earth, rovers like perserverance have been discovering even more similar traits between the two planets.
The end turned into a dhar man ending when they say "so you see"

I knew it was Venus .Only because our teacher gave us like some kind of song for the planets. Don't ask me why but I still sing it when I have a planet question. And this is before they said Pluto was not a planet. So here it goes My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas 😅😅

Honestly, as a 5th grader, this was SO easy! I loved this video! Pt 2 pls! Ilysm Queen Reezy!
Wait the first question, I’m confused, was it seven and a half hours or was it supposed to be 7 separate half hours. Because if it’s the second one then they didn’t do the first question right. Sorry it’s early for me and I’m a stickler for getting math correct which is dumb but just thought I’d ask

The Raven reference

The thumbnail number is 18 you dummies
I don't know why you put that either "Hey Hey Shush"
The introduction to every contester like it's reality show lmfao i love it
Love your vids❤️💖
So I think one of the girls is the makeup artist that was bad in the video from two years ago when she went to the worst makeup artist in the vid the girl I think it was Adriana
Not them singing the THATS sk raven theme song and the other one just being like. NO NO NO
the answer was 3/2 not 2/3 tho
“BIG BODY BENZ” had me dying 3:21
Duma**
It’s the fact that they don’t know that 90 degrees is a right angle

XXXVIII is 38 (in England they teach Roman numerals in school) 😋  I hate science and I’m not the best at it 😅
In the thumbnail the ANWER was 18
Wait, I thought Mercury was the closest to earth
12:09 I did get it and it wasnt a guess I just like astronomy and astrology
1:58 omg little mix???
17:35 the laugh LMAO
I snort-laughed 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣
I think the answer is 24 in the thumbnail
Doris: my last name is ✨reezy✨  Courtney: ariyan what abt u? Ariyan: what did u just say-
3 + 3 x 3 - 3 + 3 = 12  Because if you solve 3x3 its 9 and use 9+3 and it would be 12 and you take away 3 from 12 it would be 9 and then put 3 back then its 12 again so thats why the answer is 12 ♥️
I have a major girl crush on Doris🥺🥺
I got the 8 minute answer right
I said “at morning “and “past midnight”…
I know this is off topic but i wanna see you react/play episode also I love u
I love how they matched their outfits ❤️

BARACK OBAMA- Ariyan rosé 2022

doris’ nose contour is AMAZING
I actually never learned the roman numerals that was interesting to hear
The thumbnail answer is 18
Ohhhh hope I can learn some facts
Lol such a funny trio
Any Australians watching this, cause when they put Australia as an island 😭It's a continent and a country!!!! But Courtney also at 15:14 was so confident! poor Courtney
I’m African and I don’t know how many countries are in Africa 🤣🤣🤣
7 half hours= 30 * 7 = 210. It ain't that hard 30 is 2/3 of 45. Therefore X is around 0.67, but I guess you could write it like 2/3 too Tbh I don't know the word of angles in English X=10 V=5 I=1. So it's 30+5+3 = 38 Uh this ain't math but lemme count... around 28? I can't remember wierd English abbreviations rn sorry (also not math) 8 minutes? because speed of light is fast none? the right answer isn't right though, it felt wrong so I looked it up, and it's actually -40 Gas, liquid and hard? idk what they're called in English (almost! hard sounded wrong though)  The one in the thumbnail was 3+3*3-3+3, right? Well then it's 3+9-3+3=3+9=12  False (isn't it like signal waves through the air? or something idk how to explain). huh ok lol Mt Everest cause I have common knowledge Euroasia? or whatever the abbreviation is. I think I got this one right. It's just one big island. But my guess, if it didn't count was actually Greenland Mars? no according to Google it's Mercury I'm gonna guess and say it's 24. lol I was way off. it just didn't feel like more than 30 for some reason They should've asked real geography questions like states, capitals, rivers, oceans etc.
I knew the 8 minutes one without the options hehe
the degrees one has me confused bc isnt 45°F really cold but in C its hot as fuck . smth isnt right 😭
10:55 I really said “ AM means morning and PM means night 👍” 💀
YOUR INSIDE OF THE JOKE BABE😂
IS THAT THE CRUSH BOOK 😀😀😀
The sum in the thumbnail is 12 so the girl on the left so how is she dumb?
Didn't they all get the first question wrong? 7*30=210... or is it just me?
I really like your friends because they are really funny and friendly I wish I will have friends like yours  when I get older
YESSS PURR YALL WATCHED THATS SO RAVEN IF U COULD GAZE INTO THE FUTURE U MIGJT THINK LIFE WILL BE A BREEZZZZEEE
wow ariyan rlly thought there were 43 teeth in an average human’s mouth
12:12 I got it right. yes
It’s sad because I had to dislike the video 😂
By the way it’s 12
You guys have the best vibes
"i dont even have a first guess" killed me
I got 210 for question 1 and 1.5 for question 2 so this explains why i fail at math and life cause I'm clueless
I got 38 right 😍

Doris: How do u look at anumber and think it’s another number.  It’s math Doris everything is either different or a social construct.
Everything is a social construct in this video
My first name is reezy
Courtney: being confident and making ariyan feel bad about saying Venus.  Ariyan:😔 Answer Venus  Courtney getting mad: ITS VENUSS😲 Ariyan:😏
mEcUrY vEnUS eArTh
Yes it was very much a guess
7 half hours = 3 and a half hours which is  210 minutes
Them: If you got the speed of light question right, ur either guessing or u got it wrong.   Me last week reviewing the speed of light and other stuff.   Also me: It’s minutes!!!! Yelling thru the screen
Thumbnail: "99% percent of people don't know this" Really being a simple PEMDAS problem I guess I'm Einstein then.
LMAOOOO Big Body Benz I can'tttt
The biggest island question is not true because every single content state and country is on a island so the answer is Europe.
I got the sunlight question right because we are 94.331miles mi and the speed of f light is 299 729 458 m/s
I thought it was like anti matter, black matter and white matter
3+3 3x3 3-3 3+3 =18
The answer is 18
I just discovered your channel,and I’m so happy!
It’s not mars
For some reason 4:30 had me wheezing and I still am typing this-           Edit: Are we not going to talk about the mo-...sound effect, at 15:23 x_x

Ok I feel like I’m in twilight zone here ! How many minutes in 7 half hours , 7 lots of 30 (30 mins being half an hour) 210 minutes ?! What am I missing ?!!!

0:49 made LOL 😂 😂
around 4:30: All y'all are wrong cause 7 half hours in minutes is 210 😭 Anyways, I got 7/15 so I'm stupid 🤪
The reason why Greenland is called Greenland is that the man discovering it wanted people to come and pay him money to live there. Nobody wants to really live in the cold, so he called it Greenland.
But can we get a joint youtube for these women!!! It has to be doneee 🤍🤍
yall i think the answer to the question in the thumbnail is 16 lmao please correct im also very dumb
Huh?  2:50

I got it right and it was a guess 😎
Everything is a social construct 👏🏻
Isn't the answer to question one 210 ?  seven half hours = 30 * 7 (if it was 7*60 it would have said seven and a half) (sorry if I'm just being dumb XD)
Me looking at the title   Oh that’s 18 I’m not smart just estimating
This is turning into a comedy show
That's so raven misters as me that's so raven nobody can beat me
*this can be a youtube show and i'd pay for it.... i laughed almost every 2 mins.... i love everything about this... y'all're naturals*
Doris is in it to win it <3

Im the SMARTEST here😌😌😌hahahahahahahah jk
The thumbnail pic was 6
I'm super confused lol wasn't the 1st question "how many minutes are in 7 half hours"? So that would be 210 minutes. There are 30min in a half hour so, 7×30= 210 minutes. But I looked at the math they came up with and I guess the question was suppose to be "how many minutes in 7 AND A half hours?" That "and" is very important. Lol it could mean a whole other number
For how long does it take for the sun's light to reach the earth I got 8 minutes and I didn't guess because my dad told me this
My lung is just pumped when i saw this trio 😭, please make it this collab more!!
12:10 i mean, as someone who KNEW IT but doesn't understand it, i can confirm this false.
The answer on the thumbnail is 18
HOW DID YALL GET A GRADE 1 QUESTION WRONG 😭😭😭
1, 450 2, 2/3 3, idk 4, obtuse 5, 38 bc x means ten and there is 3 of the them so 3 x 10 =30 v is 5 so 30+5=35 i is 1 so 1 x 3=3 35+3=38
QUEENS
I’ve literally never had Roman numerals MENTIONED in any of my classes in all of school lmaoo
16:38 bro mars is the closest planet to the sun not the earth
I couldn't stop laughing I want more of these
4:33 Courtney: wait a damn minute  Girl was so confident😂
BIG BODY BENZ 😭😭😭😭
Solid liquid and gqs
The light travels 7-8 minutes to reach earth and if the sun stopped shining we’d have about 7-8 minutes before we all freeze to death
It’s sad cause I’m 21 and need to teach myself Roman numerals
I counted 26 sooo
LMAOO

"8 minutes" "If you're watching this right now I know you didn't get it right" I definitely got it right.. "And if you did get it right it was a guess" ....
It’s 6 😂😂😂

You guys need to check your answers for the first question because the answer is 420 and PS: i'm only ten and I knew that

When Courtney said ewoo  l died

"I was gonna put 45 "    "But you didnt:))))"
The answer to the numbers on the thumbnail is 21 because 3x3=9 9+3=12+3=15+3=18+3=21

"we don't actually know how the world looks so for you to sit here and tell me that africa is over there and americas over here for all we know i could be in cuba right now."  -dorisxchi, 2022
The person in the middle of the thumbnail is the dumbest because the answer to the problem would be a multiple of 3 and her answer isn't one. Also, the person on the left got it right.
Is the thumbnail 18?  Or 12
I’m a minor didn’t have anything to write on did it in my head got it first and got it right on the first one
BRO FOR THE AFRICA ONE I GUESSED 53 AND THE ANSWER WAS 54 BRUUH
12:06 no cause I'm in year 7 Britain and I only just recently learned that  I'm 12  YEA. I got alot correct  Surprisingly   Yes I corrected that word    BTW Australia is a country  Australasia and Oceania is a continent
God I felt so dumb at maths  Literally in bottem set in school  But angles  Easy man
I stared at the thumbnail and said 18  Told my sibling how I did it  And started saying I got it right except I forgot bodmass  And I was like. "I honestly don't care about bodmass"  "that's why u in set 5 maths"
13:57 "Geography is a social construct" The subtitles: "GROGRAPHY is a social construct" 💀💀💀
I watched this video 10 times 💀 fave vid EVERRR!!!
In the thumbnail the question is really easy becuz... Aryan did it correct the answer is Right! It's 12....
DO MORE OF THIS ITS SO FUNNY
I can’t with these intros😂😂🤣🤣
Lol y’all are too cute! Ahh I’m white and I feel you on the “lessons” being taught. I think too much energy and time is spent on concepts that don’t matter and not enough time or experience on things that do. They doing too much and trying to mold us so much into what they want instead of teaching freedom and skills.
The fact that mercury has a the closest to the earth._.
I KNEW THE 40 DEGREE CELSIUS/FARENHEIGHT
k, so I might be dumb for this, but if you have 45. x =30 how could there be a valid answer? because 30 is way less than 45 and if you are multiplying 45 it would come out to be a whole lot more than 30!?!? and plus THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE VARIABLE IS- how could they come up with an answer so confidently if there isn't an answer.....
Why is the into like Kim Kardashian
I got the sun one right because I’ve heard it before
Girl I got 210 minutes for that first question

12:08 THE SUN IS 8 MINS AWAY FROM EARTH THATS WHY
when court saw Doris's answer then she was like "OWAAAA" I died 5:43
We just found a cure for depression, and that's it
"Maths is a social construct" yasss I totally agree. Purrr 💕💕
3:04 here
I think it’s the fox guy
I see ariyan as the funny bff/sister; Courtney as a celeb; and Doris as a LEGEND
I got the 8minutes right … only bc in science class it was one of our lessons
Isn’t the closet one to earth mercury 😃
But there are four states of matter… why does no one ever remember plasma 😔
1:59 I DONT KNOW BUT IS THAT THATS SO RAVEN ??
I just noticed they are All matching
The fact that no one disliked the video bc we know she’s a queen 👑
This is so funny but i gotta dislike this video because courtney told so 🤣
I am 3 minutes and 37 seconds in and my esophagus is already dead
16:31 also a reason why they don't want to go to Venus...it's fucking hot there
Technically Australia is the larhest island but since it's a continental mass it doesn't count
7:52 Obtuse. This question was so easy I had to answer
REEEZY👍
Astronomy belongs to science dumb Betch cuz geo mean earth in greek so obviously it study the fricking earth!!!!!
We need more videos with you dori and ariyan  P👏🏾E👏🏾R👏🏾I👏🏾O👏🏾D👏🏾

The outfit coordination is 👌
YALL BEST BECOME A REEZY TODAY BEFORE ITS TO LATE!
"math is very hard for me, i don't know 2+2, maybe it's 6 maybe it's 8." -ariyan reezy rose, 2022
The question onthe thumbnail is 18 I think.
THIS TRIO IS EVERYHTING I NEED PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO MORE LIKE THISSS
You guys seem so fun to hangout with I love it keep it up🥰
Y’all are genuinely so funny. Like I was cracking up the whole video.
Its always my favorite when they are all together!!!
Imagine if u choise number “69”😳
2:50 i’m crying
18
“all i cared about was popularly and popularity didn’t care about me” same
Yall are the literal power puff girls
Doris reminds me so much of gold (Kim) lmaooo
Venus is also the closest plant to the sun to
Was the first question how many minutes are in 7 half hours or how many minutes are in 7.5 hours because I thought it was the first way but 450 is the answer for 7.5 hours. The answer for the way that I thought it was is 210.
The question on the thumbnail is 6
I love when u guys collaborate
I swear this is exactly the inside of my brain. three braincells doing they job😆
does anyone know if switchcraft is free?
Fast forward to 5:42 when she said "Ewooooooo". Kinda sounded like the "Igbo Tribe" in Nigeria. Made me curious are you Nigerian?
Listen, I got 210 on the first question, coz wouldn't "seven half hours" be 3.5 hours? Either the question is wrong or y'all are
Ariyan: *"Is this an inside joke?"* Doris: *"YOU'RE INSIDE OF THE JOKE, BABE"*
The  reason why Indian students don't go to school is that they teach all this stuff in class 2 😭
Please do more 🥰
I got one right lol. But I got the planet one right cause it said the one going into Earth Witch is Venus because mercury Venus earth mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus neptune
Ariyans laugh is the cutest thing XD
the fact I got the 8 minutes one correct shocked me
X=10; V=5; I=1, literally never learned roman numerals but...
Venus ain’t the the closest planet to the sun tho it’s mercury
4:27 has me cry laughing ☠️😭
I couldn’t stop laughing! Made my day <3
The reason why astronauts aim to mars is because venus is a pure ball of fire with land. High carbon in the atmosphere with lava. It is the hottest planet even though it is not the closest to the sun.
BIG BODY BENZ???? CRAZY LMAOOO
3+3x3-3+3=18
Y'all gat the first one wrong it said 7 HALF HOURS not 7 AND a half hours which means the answer would be 210
I LOVE THIS OMG HAHAHA
👍👍
babe it's saying the sun's light (LIGHT) so the light is fast😁😂🤣 so it's not a lucky guess to me lol.
THE ANSWER IS 18 😭
Thanks Reezy, I learned more stuff today than my whole life in school
I'm pretty sure switch craft has something to do with the book I've been reading called witch boy Because it sounds like the book
Them 8 minutes?! Me who got it right cause I saw it on TikTok:😎😎😜😜😎😎
my favorites r 3:00 to 3:25
Doris: She has a lot up there. A lot of meat, but a lot of knowledge as well.  Ariyan: Aww thank you Dor- *sudden realization*
"babe youre inside of the joke" got me🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well technically for which planet is the closest it’s technically Mercury because has a small orbit and is mostly closest to the earth and every other planet because it has a small orbit it goes for every single planet so technically mercury is the closest
Wow, in India a fifth grader can fail these three dumb heads..
The confessional-style intro for our "contestants" was IMMACULATE   Edit: We send stuff to Mars, despite Venus being closer, because Venus is an atmospheric shitshow. Much more challenging landings due to extreme heat, turbulence, and pressure, plus poor sun exposure on the surface, so rovers would be dependent on their nuclear power. Mars is farther away, but FAR easier for our technology to survive.
A ANGLE THAT IS 90 DEGREES IS A RIGHT ANGLE AND YALL SAID OBTUSE NAUR
“if youre good at geography youre a b-“ me: i got A on my IGCSe… 🥺 IGCSE IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT MAAM

Why are they giving me destiny's child vibes
None of them were right on the first question though… It was how many minutes are in 7 half hours, not 7 and a 1/2 hours, So the answer would be 210 not 420
this is my comfort video
I LAUGHED SO MUCH IN THIS VIDEO OMG😭

11:49 the only reason why i know this one is because the song Come, Sweet Death is 8 minutes long, which means it is the perfect song to play for when the sun explodes.

Where are you COURTNYYY. I'm waiting for ur new vid. MISS YOU :(
I'm in 6th grade and I know that Everest is the tallest mountain.
The answer to the thumb nail is 12-9 which is 3

15:46 its actually a funny story, in the time where ppl used boats and wanted to conquer the whole world, idk remember who maybe Spain, found a beautifull green area full of life and amazing weather, to svoid anyone going there, they called it Iceland, and when they found another land, but ice-cold and almost impossible to live, they called it Greenland, so everyone could ignore Iceland and go conquer there, for the peomising name
MovieStar planet really prepared me for most of these questions 😭😭

y’all are hilarious omggg 💀💀 not the Darman ending 😭😭😭 18:48
tumnail anser is 18
The Answer to the "Roman Numeral question" is  X = 10  so 3 x's is equivalent to 3 10's which equals 3 x 10 = 30. V = 5.  I = 1. so a V and three I's equals a five and three ones which equals 5 + 3 which = eight.  so XXXVIII equals 30 + 8, and since 30 + 8 = 38, mah girl Doris is CORRECT BUT  still, rely on me beforehand cuz I took Roman Numerals in school bish! also y'all (specifically Ariyan) should really pay attention in school. if it's the other way around, like courtney beebee over here is talkin bout, like if y'all are not learning Roman Numerals in public schools, y’all and y’all’s *parents* needa get on that cuz I was homeschooled and I learned that shit in like first grade so.
This was classy lmaoo 🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Okay wait to be honest I would’ve gotten dumbest mo matter what according to my math teacher
First question said 7 half hours, which would mean 30 x 7 right? Cause a half hour is 30 minutes….am I dumb?
nah but fr tho who was taught roman numerals in school? i wasn’t ik how to read them but def didn’t learn that in school
*There’s infinite information to educate yourselves with online!*
Social media and/or the US being against education in order to manipulate and control everyone because knowledge is power…
Girl I love when I come back to so many videos to binge 😩
I had to figure out the thumbail before clicking.
Australia actually is a bigger island than Greenland
I knew it is 8 minutes reeeeeeeeezy
Girl!! Can you adopt me!!
Love the matching outfits colors 😍 love you girls
"Big body benz" had me dead💀-
For the thumb nail I got 18 for my answer
Greenland? The place is not even green😂😭
I laughed so much even in the first like 5 minutes. Wow!😂😂😂😂😂😂
when Courtney got the first Q wrong is that moment in class when everyone has the same answer but you😭
32🤯
Can we talk about all there outfits are matching in color?? Like purrr😻😻
OKKK PURRR WE SEE THE GREEN THEMEEEE
PLEASE THIS WAS SO CHAOTIC. ✋😭
16:32 *its mercury..*
“Time flys when you’re having fun.”  *me thinking the video is 10m long but is actually 20 min long 👁👄👁*
The beginning is so chaotic
Lmao I said 53. I was hella close where's my prize lol
LMAO Ariyan Reezy Rose...
8:14 girl how do u think u can feel the sun? U sitting there for 8 days? Or 8hrs? 🥲
I am in 7th grade and got all the questions except the AM and PM one...
16:19 think for a hot second, all you need is one second. Like its mercuy. Where and who told you that it was venus. Props to the funny comments (in the video) and jokes!
You said i had to put a 👎 if You GOT it RONG so i did
Ariyan laughing her ass off while Doris was trying to apologize to Courtney made me hyperventilate
7 half hours equates to 210 minutes💀 a half hour is 30 minutes. Just multiply that by 7. All 3 of you got it wrong💀😭
this is literally one of the funniest videos i have seen so far 😭😭  thank you girls so much for making my day ❣️❣️

*”BARACK OBAMA✊”*
i like astrolomy, so i knewhow many minutes it took for the suns light to reachearth :))
3+3x3-3+3 is 3+9-6 which is 5 (I believe)
“Checkmate 😎” I LOVE DORIS SO MUCH

me watching this while being in my math class hits different
Why do y'all remind me of Kim, moesha and niecey

Why does Doris look like Megan thee stallion
their dynamics and chemistry r so mesmerizing; like u really love to see it, it's such a good time (this video is so funny, i can't even point out one clip without referring to another lol)

the ending really sends me 😭😭😭😭😭
12:54 😭😭💀
I feel like i might be smarter then them tbh
who was that passing by
Australia is NOT an island its a Contente
Venus gets closest to Earth at only a certain (short) time, 50% of the time it's at the polar opposite side, but Mercury is the closest planet to Earth for the longest time
Na why is the sad music still playing ina end
Can I get an 0:06 owa?

I say again, you and Deb Smikle neeeedddd to collaborate And it’s the fact y’all are all wearing green.
My mom always says, “ it’s an inside joke and you was outside.”
First question: "how many minutes are 7 half hours" 7x30 = 210 minutes  ?!  5900?! Girl?!
I think it's 18..... I mean he image for the vid I think the answer is 18
That 40° stuff was taught in secondary school 🙆🤣🤣❤️

Courtreezy ur so sleezy #pubichair#pubicitch
The first question was how many minutes in 7 half hours. Therefore you're taking 7 x 30. It's not saying 7 hours or 7.5. So the answer is 210 minutes 😭
12:56

Every time I hear the teeth question I start singing "My Shiny Teeth and Me" to find the answer(can't count cause I have 28)
You guys made me spit out my water so many times💀💀💀😩😩
Blooming
If your wondering what the answer to the thumbnail is its 18
DORIS IS GIVINGGGGG💕💕💕

DORIS IS LITERALLY THE PRETTIEST WOMEN ON EARTH WHAT 😍💞💓💕
So like the closest planet to earth changes because of their orbits and stuff,  but the one that is closest must of the time is actually mercury 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️

Ariyan smile so pretttyyyy🥹
I guessed 32 yeasty😂
Hello
Btw the answer to the thumbnail is 18
Isnt the first answer for marh be 210 min because 7 half hours would be 3  and a half an hour is 60 min 60 × 3 = 180 and then a half an hour would be 30 min 180 + 30 = 210 min
Hey I have an idea how about you react to people doing scary make up with your friends
was i the only one who thought mercury was the closest to earth👀
Courtney sounds like Dhar man at the end
I really hope this becomes a thing because I love it!  I'll be playing from home
I learned the light one in 5th grade😭😭
Y'all are so toxic to each other but it's funny af 😭
Ariyan's hair is so freaking cute!
The answer to the question on the thumbnail is 6  3+3×3-3+3  = (3+(3×3)) - (3+3) = (3+9) - (6) =12-6 =6
15 my answer
12:13 it’s basic knowledge
IM DYINGGGGGGG!!!
The answer is 12 on the picture
Doris cousin sounds Jamaican😭😭 big body benz
Y’all are dumb I am in 6th grade and I know the answers like 90° is a right angle not a obtuse angle
NOO DORIS’S CHECKMATE LOOOOLLLL
😳
"Girl what?!" - my exact reaction. C-treezy's mathematic confidence almost had me gaslit too ...
"Is this an inside joke?" "You're INSIDE of the joke, babe!" I'M SCREAMINGGG I CAN'T BREATHE😂😂😂😂
for the question on which planet is closest to earth, the reason why no one talks about inhabiting venus is because it has been shown that it would be very hard to inhabit, and there would be a higher chance with doing so on mars.
Dead ass I started guessing on some of those and I got them write five times
NOT THE INTERVIEWS 😭😭😭💀💀💀
"All I care about is Popularity, Popularity doesn't care about me." -Ariyan, 2022
16:20 NOOO 💀

The answer to the question on the thumbnail is 18
I know how the sun light thing works Basically light travels really fast right so we are really far  So if the sun exploded we would see it 8 minutes later  Hope that kinda helps 😃

This is the first video I’ve ever laughed at from start to finish, you 3 are my favourite people ever!
Wtf 8 hours and 8 days do you all don't know how fast light is 😭😭
18:47 not the sad music playing in the background and the dharr man lessons🤧💀
This is accyaly so funny i havent laughed like this in months
Its 420.. Theres 420 minutes in 7 hours💀. I was solving the equations with them, and when that  question came up, I solved it and got 420 but they got 450. I literally said "wtf how thats wrong" LMAOO I was so mad too😭😭. They did long multiplication... you were supposed to just multiply and thats it bestie-
please keep this up! this was very fun I enjoyed it, the editing was amazing and you guys are funny as always! lots of love!
okay but seven HALF hours is different than seven AND a half hours. Which is why I got 110. I would have got 450 tho if I didn't question life decisions like this! I second guessed myself
this has soothed my college finals anxiety tysm I love yall
I found this channel and was like “this girl looks just like my cousin Courtney.” And then I saw her name was Courtney…. Uh….what is your last name??👀
i thoroughly enjoyed this lmao, yall are so funny
These ppl are the funniest😭🤌 I SWEAR!! THE BEST ACCIDENT THAT I HAVE EVER DONE IS COME ACROSS THEM!! 💕💗💖
BRO I CAN’T BREATHE OML STOP I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
I did get 8 minutes right bc I'm a smart girl and I learned it in 6th grade
I never laughed so much and so loud🤣🤣🤣
Ooh Greenland
I SAID MT EVERST TOO
2:11 so in harmony 😍😍😍
10:54 I only know AM
Don't people on average have 32 adult teeth, but 4 of them are wisdom teeth- so subtracting that leaves you with 28 teeth left? I mean if you're missing some teeth, there's nothing to be ashamed of ♡
I love the video but I'm good at math so I have to dislike it
you should deffo do more of these 😂😂
I love how Courtney was tryna condone violence between Doris & Ariyan when Ariyan said that Doris had missing teeth lol 😂😂🤣🦷.
Ik I wasn't the only one that heard them sing Thats so raven in the beginning😍
I'm on the floor dead 😂...Love this video ❤
The only reason I know Roman numerals is because I went to catholic school
FAVE TRIO, WHO ELSE? 🙋🏻‍♀️
I loved everything about this video... The energy and all... Y'all funny asf.. I wish I had a  friendship like yours ❤️❤️❤️😂😂😂🦄
Ariyan rosé: " is this an inside joke?" Doris: " YOU'RE INSIDE OF THE JOKE, BABES"
The answer for the 3+3×3-3+3=28
Second class questions..easy.. But when i will be on camera or stage my brain stops working.
Can we talk about how they are all matching with green
Wasnt the first question 7*0.5 hours = ? minutes That'd be 210. If the question was supposed to be 7,5 hours = ? minutes then they shouldve added an and so its clear the seven and half are a single part of the question.
They're so fun 🤭😂🙊 I love them 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I just love your Energy, i just wanna sit in a room with yall 😂
MORE. OF. THIS. PLEAAAASSSEEEEE!!!
9
I could be in Cuba right now🧚‍♀️💅 purrr periodt🤣🤣🤣
i love how doris is so nice like she just saw ariyan make a sad face and she immediately apologized:))
4:04 isn't the answer not suppose to be 210?
Idc what anyone says, watching this at night when you're supposed to be sleeping, trying not to wake your parents up with your loud ass laughing is the *most* hardest thing to do.   Try change my mind
Y'all are absolutely chaotic and I'm living for this 😂😂😂😂
Aryan is killing me right now with her laugh🤣🤣💀💀
I genuinely love when you three do videos together! However, I need yall to stop making me laugh out loud like them hyenas from The Lion King tho, this is not a good look for me!
American moment
I got every question right and I didn’t guess any of them-
4:33 Did you really just think the question said “seconds” instead of “minutes”
its 420
They messed up on the "WHAT IS THE ONLY TEMPERATURE WHICH IS THE SAME IN FAHRENHEIT AS WELL AS CELSIUS?" they said 40, but he answer is -40.
the alarm sound is triggering my fight or flight
When they were asking how many country's were in Africa I... uh... said...         7 😭😭😭😭😟😟😟😟😫😫
you guys are so funny... I was really engaged  and playing along!!! 🤓❣
it’s two am and i am STRUGGLING to hold in my laughter. pray for me 🧎🏼‍♀️
When I first saw this video I was looking at the thumbnail tryna solve out the problem 😭😭😭
i literally clicked on this and screamed “OH MY GOD THEIR OUTFITS R SO CUTE THEY’RE MATCHING COLORSSS.”
Acute morning obtuse morning
I don't think the first one is right
This video gave me so much serotonin 😭 also can we agree that Ariyan is the funniest one
I got 8 minutes cause light travels STUPID FAST. Also Venus popped to mind cause it's Earth's "sister planet", but then I double guessed and thought mars 😔
HOW ARE THE PLANETS IN THE GEOGRAPHY CATEGORY
PLEASE DO MORE MY FAV VIDEO EVER
I thought 7 half hours meant 7x30 minutes = 210 minutes. 😗   "7 & a half hours" means 7 hours & 30 minutes.... I'm in the Midwest USA so, idk if this is a language difference. Or if all of ya'll actually got it wrong lol. Regardless, love ya'll together. You always make me laugh. 💕
how many minutes are in 7 half hours? why is it not worded as 'how many minutes are in 7 AND  a half hours coz they different
ariyan : "i only care about popularity, popularity didn't care about me"
This is PEAK bimbo (affectionate)
I LOVED THIS SOOO MUCH!!!
I've never laughed so hard in my entire life throughout the whole vid y'all they are like the funniest triplets evarr babes y'all should make more videos together 😂
The answer to the sum in the thumbnail is 18. I solved it myself.
i did it with you three
The thumbnail is 20..
Its -40 and you forgot plasma.
I don't think science was science. Well kind of but not really.
Dorischi:Casuallywrites “stinky” on courtreezys board while talking

3 + 3 = 6 x 3 = 18 - 3 = 15 + 3 = 18 math masters am i the %1 (this math equation is based on the thumbnail)
3 fine ass black woman
The title which was a number question the answer is 18
i can label a world map but im TERRIBLE at math

Please make this a continuing series!
Your matching outfits are adorable!
10:25 hahahaha🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 part 2
Are you knew this. Even  though iam 10
The question on the front was like 18
i actually got 8minutes right because i remembered it in school
10:32 "FIGHT EACH OTHER" *hugs*
please explain, how did i laugh for 10 minutes when only 5 mins of the video had passed
This is the most I have laughed in months 😆
NOT ' BIG BODY BENZ' 😭
I thought of it like this, If the sun burned out it would take 8 minutes for us to realize. So therefore 8 minutes to reach the earth.
16:53 its ok i am from south africa i live in south africa but i dont know how many countries they is in south africa even tho i learned it this year at school i am really bad at geography
THE END WAS GIVING DHARMANN
"Is this an inside joke?"  "You're inside of the joke, babe."   That's the funniest response holy hell
All of you got the first one wrong LMFAOOO ITS 210
me fact-checking every answer
i love how yall make all these jokes ing the middle of the vid and yall are such a vibe like u make my day
Mt. Everest isn't the tallest mountain. Mt. Everest is the Highest Mountain. The tallest mountain is Hawai'i's Mount Kīlauea.
I love the matching green 🥺
mannnn 14:14 had me ROLLING OMG yall r so funny!!! that whole bit where ariyan was hysterically laughing was hilarious LMAO great video
ok but why did i actually search up reezy on the internet
In the thumbnail, the answer is 18 ^-^!!
I'm dying of laughter this is the funniest thing I've seen in a minute
✨REZZYYYY EEEE EEEEE EEEEEEEEE
New fave reality tv show
i kinda knew that internet was traveling over underwatercables by watchng a daily dose of internet video
14:56 Mount Everest would be the highest mountain. Not the tallest. :P
40C = 104F
Court babes the answer is in the thumbnail lol
I love how all of them are wearing the color green!
i think the answer is 18 smh...
Girl you guys are the funniest trio ever! Like I have been dying thourout the whole video! <3 u guys so ty for making our day
I got 8 minutes and I’ve never done that 😍
Love how y’all all r wearing green
“School will come back to you one day”
I can’t wait for the next dumb dumber dumbest video!
It was Aryan answering ‘Venus’ and her reaction when she found out she’s right for me.😭👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾😂😂😂😂🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 We need a part 2 / ep. 2 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙌🏾
The amount of time i laughed at this video...
YALL ARE FUNNY TBHH
courtney i love u but wouldnt seven half hours be 30 x 7 = 210? you guys did 7 and a half hours instead of SEVEN HALF HOURS
“In school I really cared about popularity. Popularity didn’t care about me” TRUTH. I CACKLED SO HARD ISTG
This video made me cry in laughter in my kitchen while i was drunk and eating cold takeaway burger
YALL ARE SO FUNNY I CANT😭😭
It's 18
The confessionals are killing me 😂😍
“dOrIs DoNt CoPy Me”, I started pissing myself 💀
Doris: if your good at geography your a bug  Me: 🪲🪳🐜🦗🦟🦂
I love how you guys always wear something matching such as the color of your clothes and and others
I did the first one in my head lmao
Is this are u smarter than a 5th grader questions Becuase if I was I don’t know if I’m qualified
Them counting their teeth 🤣🤣🤣🤣 P.S. I got the speed of light question correct. The shortest amount of time. Light before sound- that's how I remember.
13:43 IM CRYING
An angle at 90 degrees is a right angle 😭😭😭
I watched a video saying when the sun explodes, we would only know 8 minutes later
The answer for the temperature question should be -40 technically.
Courtney: I'm sorry to all the Africans Me an African: babes I don't know either💀
POV: you are African and also don't know how many countries are in Africa 👁️👄👁️😅
I got none of the math ones correct besides obtuse so 😅
Wait but it was worded "7 half hours", not 7 and a half hours". 450 is 7 1/2, but if it's "7 half hours", that's just 7x30, which is 210.
IM A REEZY AND SO IS MY MOM SHE LOVES U SO MUCH!
I got the time it takes the light from the sun to reach earth right but only because I just finished earth science and the last chapter was about light and the sun and plus my teacher always asks that question hoping we didn’t remember
We Definitely more of this!!!!!   The world needs this kinda comedy 😭😭😭
Yall make my life happier 💓
It's 18 does any one know
Every time the timer went off I thought it was my phone lmao
I thought Ariyan and Doris personality’s we’re switched- this is so unexpected.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂the intro of  y'all is what we needed
yall are like not smart...
The thumbnail is 18
45 x X = 30? Was it? Well i dont think that exists- i think it should be 45x = 30 so u have To find out 45 x what = 30 :)
18:31 made me feel like i was watching a drah man video
ARIYAN IS SO ME WHEN I WAS AT SCHOOL I KNOW HOW TO HIDE MY FAT STILL TO THIS DAY
NOT THE “EWO” IM CRYING
Why this is so funny ?!? 😭🤣 Literally one minute and I'm laughing loud 🤣 What a great trio, thank you so much 🥰🌹
doris makes me laugh so hard everytime i see her, help i love her
wasn’t the first question 210 minutes?
The intro was✨key✨
I love this video!!! DO MORE
MOREEEEE
DO MOREEE
Ha! I did actually know it was 8 minutes because I saw a YouTube video once that said, “if the sun suddenly turned purple we wouldn’t know for 8 minutes after it happened. It’s interesting
proud to say I have been here since 400k
My favorite video ever
Isnt question 2 1.2? (or x = 1 1/5)
No bcz I really thought AM is After Morning and PM is Past Morning (well at least english is not my birth language)
Ooh I can explain the internet cables under the ocean one. It’s true because if you think about it, people who live at an elevation closer to sea level have better internet connections than people who live at a higher elevation. That’s why you’ll rarely have a good connection, if one at all, if youre going hiking or camping of what not.
This video is fun af, but Im gonna try to solve it maybe it is 18 I am not sure  Feel free to reply <33
All the viewers who just watch her videos without subscribing  Let's call them *Ghostreezy" 🤡😭😂 Ps - I'm a reezy btw purrrrrr💅💅💅
I LOVE THIS VIDEO OMG I WAS DYING
the fact that i tried doing the thumbnail problem and Arian(idk how to spell-) got it right/ i can’t lol
I died 💗😭
Me: thinking that school is not going to help me. Courtney reezy: post this video Me: ok never mind.
It’s 12. Definitely. PEMorDAorS people!
I'm an African and I didn't even know 😂
Why is your laughter so contagious tho😂
Sorry court i couldn’t bring myself to dislike the video, it was too funny
My answers, coz I feel like playing along😂:  Maths 1) 450 - correct 2) 2/3 - correct 3) Circumference - correct 4) Obtuse - correct 5) 38 - correct  Science 6) 32 - correct 7) Anti Meridiem and Post Meridiem - not spelt right, but correct anyway 8) 8 minutes - correct 9) 45 degrees - incorrect 10) Solid, Gas and Liquid - correct  Geography 11) False - incorrect 12) Everest - correct 13) Greenland - correct 14) Venus - correct 15) 54 - correct  13/15. that was fun.
Literally everyone got the first question wrong 🤨
Im pretty sure th closest planet to the sun is mercury i learned it in school
Ok everyone got the first question wrong though 😆 it said seven half hours not 7.5 hours
y'all the first thing i saw and thought when i saw this video was they all had light green tops
U guys r fucking funny I'm wheezing so bad
I disliked because they beat u at math.
Reezies are the best people on earth, i literally checked every dictionary in the universe.
Ilysm Courtney..
so no ones talkin bout the dude crawlin by lmao
pls i love this
i love how all of u guys are wearing green ❤️
8:02 I DEAD ASS SAID OBESE HAHAHA
this was actually so fun pls do more of these ESPECIALLY THE CONFESSIONALS LMAOAOA
Love your matching shirts!
The big body Benz part from Ariyan had me dying so hard🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 y’all be so fuckin funny, I literally can’t breathe
Y’all’s vibes are immaculate
These girls 🔥😂 btw, i thought no one got the first question right LOL. English is not my first language but the way the first question is written on the screen looks like its asks “how many minutes are in seven half hours” = 7x30mins and the answer should be 210 minutes. But I guess the question the went for is “how many minutes are in seven AND A half hours = 450 😂. Am I the only one who noticed this?
PART 2
PART 2
I’m sorry but did y’all even show up to school??? 😭😭😭
Venus isn’t the nearest planet to earth it’s mercury
“how did you get your grades up?” I watched this video.
How were the majority of the science questions related to science
THE DISLIKES
2:01 OBSESSED WITH HER VOICE
This was so so so so funny 😂. Loved it
Giiirl, it was supposed to be -40° 💀💀💀
Doris going "mm...so listen"
I love you
bark
“Not y’all counting” begins to count hers
gurls im sorry to tell you dis but i'm smarter and im 12  💀
Nahhhhhhh this friendship is something elseee😭😭😭 but I’m here for itttt🤣❤️❤️
YAAL ARE SO FUNNY I CANT BREATHE I AM WHEEZING-
10:38 Dorris turned into an npc
I got 8 minutes right and it wasn’t a guess😎
I also never learned Roman numerals or at least don’t remember at all
I think it’s the whole school staff including that Mr.Wilson he so suspicious he always showing up in moments when we suspect him and that head lady with the orange hair
this was so funny definitely make it a series
Courtney on her own is funny but when she has her friends its the whole circus
Courtreezy: “SEND HATE TO DORIS!!” Me: ”🫡” Me: “Dear Doris,  Courtreezy is better than you.”❤️  But being real, love you.❤️
YOU GUYS ARE HILARIOUUSSSS🤣🤣
WHO WAS CRAWLING OB THE FLOOR😭😭
name a trio that funnier than them
um actually, plasma is another form of matter 🙄
14:28 like I am 12 and I just guessed that it was Mount Everest and It was correct like what 😆
15:54 that should've been a science question! lol
I love the colour coordination. ily
You and your friends are the funniest people on earth! Please continue to do videos together! 😂😂😂
This makes me feel dumb
*dramatically coughs blood  COURTNEY your forgiven  on my half  All zambian🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲 watchers here
11:52 y'all I was told that shit meant "after midnight" and "past midnight" and never cared enough to google how tf is after not the same as past and why what how
Ya’ll are one of the only ones who can make trivia funny 💀
i guess i got the 8 minutes question wrong
8 MINUTES AS IN 8 LIGHT MINUTES BOO
i just realized they’re all wearing green😭
Chille that first question literally made me think that it was 7 half hours instead of 7 AND a half hours. I’m over here with 210 all confused.
I really do agree that social media is ruining our brains.
Why those she look like gold from it's funneh
A yes ✨ΜΑΘΗΜΑΤΙΚΑ✨ the best subject
“If you’re good at geography, you’re a book” LMFAOOOO 😭😭😭😭
Is Ariyan my fav person and the funniest💀?

YALL ITS MIDNIGHT I GOTTA HOLD MY BREATH TO KEEP MYSELF FROM LAUGHING. I BARELY SURVIVED THE FIRST MINUTE 😭
its -40° courtney. not 40°.   negative forty degrees
timestamps for meself 2:48 3:04 3:22 3:40  4:35 5:34 7:51
Am I being stupid because there is 60 mins in an hour so the equation to find out how many minutes are in 7 hours would be 7 times 60 and that’s 420 not 450
12:12 Courtney you didn't have to call me out like that 😂😂 but 8 minutes made the most sense to me 🤣
I am the dumbest of the dumb of geometry
Me being Australian and thinking that Australia is an island too 😳
big body benz.💀
Courtneeeeeeeeeeeeeey
I didn't know courteeezy is friends with megan
10:27 Ariyan is so funny i cant with her 🤣🤣
3:32 this part really got my stomach hurting I cant stop laughing
Not a BIG BODY BENZ got me over here laughing 🤣🤣🤣
what she say? "BIG BODY BENZ" ISTG i already watched this a 100 times since the past 2 daysLMFAO
Imagine watching this and not being a reezy✊
11:11  I said  At morning / past midnight
It’s 18 :>  And I forgot to watch the video-
I 100% knew the answer about the light getting to the earth sksksks
PLEASE DO MORE OF THESE!!! 🤣🤣
This video has me dead
i suck at geography and some how got all of them right 💀 i’m still surprised i got the Africa one 💀 i think i learned these from tv 😭

thumbnail is equal to 18
3:04
It’s actually negative 40 degrees.
Yesss. Please do more of these. Maybe you can add Martin to the group.
THE FACT THAT IM IN HIGH SCHOOL AND STILL DONT KN0W ANY OF THESE
So wholesome and funny af
Ohh this video is GREAT! please do more of this type of content
Trio is back bitches 😌😌
Anyone goin to talk bot the person at the back
the way courtney said matematicas killed me then revived me
its the way yall are matching for me
18:42 was giving Disney original movie vibes 😭
omgg court, you n ur friends next video should react to ishowspeed's music video god is good
“BuT YoU DIdN’t”- Courtney
15:44 DONT WORRY AUSTRALIS IS THE LARGEST ISLAND it just counts as a continent
The first questions answer is actually 210. The question asks how many minutes are in 7 HALF hours. Therefore, you multiply 7 times 30 since 30 is half an hour. You do not multiply 7 times 60. 450 is not right. Also if you did multiply 60 and 7 you get 420 not 450.
Ok I'm not a bully but I learned that it takes 8m for the sun to trable to earth in 3rd grade guuuuuuurl
12:57 courtney looks so derpy here i can’t LOLL
We need more of these
these r 8th grade questions- is it sad that im in 8th and got half of them wrong
I DIED
i spit it out my at big body benz
The right one won. 👏👏👏👏
I’ll be honest I only got the sunlight one cuz I remember constantly being told it would take 8 minutes for the sun to reach us if it were to explode so- I’m still stupid just also holds onto unnecessary information-
Geography is literally a social construct, they found an island and named it greenland for some reason.
ok am I the only 1 who got 8min immediately and never learned it
Not me dying on everything they say because I can’t stop laughing 🤣
its mercury
Omg please do more of these I love watching you guys interact and this was so entertaining 💜💜💜💜
Was I the only one who learned in 8th grade science that the sunlight takes 8 minutes to get to earth
Obsessed with the testimonials between the questions 😭 you girls are literally so mf funnyyyyyy
Bro that thumbnail wrong, where the hell you get 10 from, you put dumbest on the wrong person. 😭  This is a joke, but at the same time a joke, but at the same time where did you get ten from?
Y'all are to funny, I can't 😭💀
16:25 bruh its mercury who agrees
should i dislike? i literally beated court in math😔
I LOVE THIS TYPA VIDEO
And they said trios don’t work 😏😉
Its Venus cause mars is after earth
Courtney rlly hit the disney character act towards the end😭😭
It is 450 dummy
Math is the easiest things ever
The fact that the only reason why I knew how long it takes for the suns light to reach earth is because everyday I think about the sun exploding and we would not know it happened until 8 minutes later 🧍🏽‍♀️
I got the one about how long it takes for the sun’s light to reach Earth correct, and no it was not a guess. I learned that in class this year. 😂
i did get it right and it wasnt a guess miss gurl
Nah this is one of her funniest videos 😂😂😂
You are too funny 😂 🥹(wipes away my tears).
we good 😂😂✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾 we everywhere!!!
For the first one, all y’all where wrong💀
8 mins is basic science😭
I actually knew it was 8 mins for the sunlight to reach the earth and I didn’t guess skjskshsksjs
GREAT AT ALL BUT SCIENCE
Please do more this was so funny lol
Love how y’all are all colored coordinated 😭
Bro this is 5th grade stuff😨✋
and I was rooting for ariyan!
not me dying in the first 5 minutes 😂😂😂😂😂
For the thumbnail i was like It’s 18
you guys made me choke on my tea.🤣🤣 Not once but multiple times.  I literally had to spit it back in my cup🤭🔥🔥
1:45 I’m wiping my tears with my geography degree 😭 it’s so much more than locating things on maps!   It can be broken up as Physical geography, cultural geography, and geospatial technologies; all of which are underrated sciences!!
18:42 It's giving Dhar Mann
I AM AN 11 YEAR OLD KNOWING 100% A FACT THAT IT WAS 8 MINUTES I was disappointed in this video 💀
Being imperfect is perfect and guess what ‘’Im perfect “ Doris reeze
Expect the Unexpected     -Doris reezy
I was watching this in the night, not a good idea, I almost died laughing 😭😂
I have watched this already 3 times for Doris and the laughs
They are such a vibe
I love these girls. ❤️
Ariyan has such a contagious laugh it's hilarious
I love this
The math work out for me the cover should be 18?👀
Vibes on vibes when y'all are together
It's the ewo for me 😂🤣🤣🤣
Lmao y’all are so funny...would love to see more of you guys together ❤️❤️❤️❤️😂😂
This was great!  I was shocked on what I thought I knew and was wrong. Lol
How I knew the suns light takes 8 minutes to arrive here is because if the sun exploded we wouldn’t know for another 8 minutes
Courtney said "ewoo!" Typical Nigerian exclamation came out ASAP😂
Fun Fact: Australia isn't the continent it's Oceania 😌
I'm sorry, I had to dislike the video. Math is a social construct
Ariyan is an ✨icon✨
Courteezy do troom troom like before
doris is such a mood
this with tati and zach next
lol wait till they hear that there are actually 5 states of matter
You didn't get the Africa question right Courtney, but on behalf of all Africans who are also Reezys you're forgiven ✊🏾
The girl on the left got the 3+3×3+3-3+3 question right ✅️
I wasn’t taught Roman numerals either 💀
Love the cut interviews for this😂😂 Absolute masterpiece🤌✨
I actually got 8 mins not cuz I guess it’s cuz the question asked when the sun LIGHt will reach earth or smthng like that. And it doesn’t take long before the sun does
big body benz 🤪🤪
Venus is not the closest planet to earth its mercury so Ariyan got it wrong.
Played and got 9 right 😂
On the title I’m literally nine years old and I know the answer, it’s 18
99% people should not know this manmade bullshit rules
no, i’m a Reezy! 😂
3
I knew all of them and by the way they were not guesses eg the sun we literally learnt about it in grade 6
Btw for the ppl who were struggling with the thumbnail equation the answer is 18 ;)
I love this so much such good content
BABEH IM DORIS IN THE BEGINNING 😭
Aryan is beautiful
You guys are so funny, but it's the colour coordination for me 😝
Hello! I just wanted to say that Mount Everest isn’t the tallest mountain in the world! It’s actually Maura Kea that mountain starts under the ocean!! But in surface it’s Mount Everest!
Love this video Also, Its actually Mercurery For 15:55
you gotta do what courtney says to do.
But she was labeled " Dumbest " in the tile- NINE WAS CORRECT
Can you please do another reading our confessions
7 HALF hours is 210 minutes… am I trippin?  30+30+30+30+30+30+30=210  Where did 450 come from?
why is no one talking about how they ALL got the first one wrong lmaooo it was 7 half hours not 7 & a half hours
these are easy questions?
MORE.
YOU *HAVE* TO MAKE ANOTHER VIDEO LIKE THIS ON GOD!!! I WAS LMFAO💀💀💀😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️❤️
»Math is a social construct.« - Dorisxchi 2022
omg i loved this video!!
Also Courtney saying she would win but loses with 4 points 🤣 no hate on u my black sister
Courtney is she dumb not to offend her but she literally asked what's geography like girl what type of question is dad shes a adult.
plz do moreeee💛💙
I have TEARS in my eyes from how many times I laughed while watching this ToT
This trio is hitting different hahahah
You guys doing the math I do in school
I actually knew that the sun took 8 minutes to reach earth cause I payed attention in science
ACUTE MORNING AND PAST MORNING PLZ
18:45 Y’all just gonna ignore the Dhar Mann moment ? Masterpiece!
Bro is no one gonna mention the person who crawled from the door 😂😂
The dumbness starts with choosing not to use blackboards so we can see what they write rather than a whiteboard where i don't know what i'm looking at.
the thumbnail:  *Ariyan getting it right but says dumber*
15:08 WHY DID I SAY RUSSIA
i wish this was longerrr i was dying laughing 😹😹😹😹😹
🕸️🕸️🕸️
an island is a landmass surrounded entirely by ocean smaller than a continent, so australia doesn't qualify
let me not be the only one who noticed the cute matching fits
DO MORE OF THESE OMGG
Mars is the third planet! Moon is the second. And it's tidally locked so you only see one side.
That meathead moment made me laugh so hard I threw my back out. I’m literally crying laughing over here 😭😭😭
North Africa you mean of course. Had no idea there were that many countries. Knew there were a lot. Learned something new again!
Their friendship makes me joyful 🥹
this video was vv chaotic,and im here for it 😭
Mars is after the moon.
I luv it when you guys make vids together! 😁❤️
The moon is obviously the nearest planet to earth. It's actually a chunk of earth because we were hit early in the solar system formation and we had a lot of planets that collided with each other.
Smart, neutral, stupid
This video gives me old yt vibes and I'm here for it, love u girlsss 💗
Is the big island of Hawaii the largest? There are so many. I think I got that wrong. Greenland? Darn it! Forgot about that. I was wrong. What do I know from islands. Well I learned something new. I'll never forget Greenland in the future.
POV: 12:10 you get this question right after watching the episode of bullsh*t about how long ago you’re viewing Saturn
I think Mt. Everest is the tallest mountain.
More please
I believe some telephone cables used to be under the ocean. Now we have towers.
The three states of matter are liquid, solid, and gas.
These 3 makes these videos perfect. They vibe so well with eachother. I love y’all.
I got the sunlight question right because I KNOW!
8 minutes it takes sunlight to hit earth.
I'm learning so much here! Had no idea what AM and PM meant.
Roman numerals are math. Ya just have to learn the value of each symbol. It was hard to learn but I got it.
School doesn't prepare us for anything? You got the hours question I didn't get. You know how to count and read and write and learn all sorts of stuff.
XXXVIII=38. X's are 10 each, V=5 and the III are ones. So we have 10, 20, 30 +5=35 +three 1's =38.
12
The answer to the thumbnail is literally 18
I love Doris😂😂😂😂
It's the big body Benz💀
Australia isn't a continent the continent is autralasia as well
The answer for the pic on the video is 6
😂😂😂this was hilarious and it was an awesome video. I won't lie I was getting the answers wrong on this side too...biggest island... really?🥲
When I saw your thumbnail I was like “I know I can solve that”
I was stuck at question one. The question said seven half hours, not seven and a half hours. The former being 210 min and the latter being 450.
Well I did get 8 mins correct but hunn that's bec I'm was school in the uk
3+3×3-3+3 = 18 AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
😂why y'all apologizing for not knowing the no of countries in Africa though? Even I didnt know...
WHY DID DORIS GET UP LIKE A MPC AND JUST STOOD THERE LIKE A MPC💀💀💀
The end was giving Dhar Mann!! 😂
Answer to the thumbnail is 18
i know she dont be obsessed with that game
Y'all need to do more collabs. Y'all made me laugh so hard now my stomach hurts. 😭
NAH DORIS I SAID KELVIN TOO I MISUNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION TOO💀💀
7 half hours =7 x 30min = 210 minutes so how is 450 the right aswer?
There is actually a 4th state of matter called Plasma.
For the first question I guessed 420
Yes do more of these please!
Why dose YouTube keep unsubscribing from  you
i thought the answer to the first question was 210😕
BARACK OBAMA✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
This is hilarious
Isn't that 0 I think-      Right? (I'm talking bout the thumbnail)
16:19 , actually Mercury is the closest one i think
Dumb girlier really played us . She got brains
for anyone who does not know, The math question on the thumbnail is 18
I just like her friends there so funny I wish I had friends like that lol 😂
They forgot how fast light moves
19:31 THIS PART LMFAO
Its 12
YALL ARE SO FUNNY I NEED MORE OF THIS TRIO SJJDJSJDJS
the sad movie music at the end.
for the thumbnail, the answer is obviously 18. 3+3=6x3=18-3=15+3=18 and here, i present you, i am smart. actually this was really easy.
Typo on the first question? Was it supposed to be how many minutes are in 7.5 hours, or 7 * ½ hours?
25 ....is my number I got from the click bait
it's mercury not Venus 😭😭
This was so funny 😭😭😭
This video was perfection.
i did this with yall & only got 5 right😭😭✌🏾
The death note sound 😂😂

"All i cared about was popularity Popularity didnt care about me"
Nobody: Them for absolutely no reason: ✨✨✨✨✨REEEEeeeeZYYYYyyyyyYy✨✨✨✨✨

"All I cared about was popularity.  Popularity didn't care about me." 😂😂😭
I nead moooreeee
Did anyone else notice that none of them got the first question right? It is "seven half hours", not "seven AND a half hours", so the answer should be 210 minutes (7x30).
I LOVE YALL
✊🏾 Another video yes!! Was funny asf as usual!
Too much trash in one video!👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎

Bro why haven't I found this channel earlier- i'm three and a half minutes in and im already wheezing
MATH IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT
Well let's see. How do I say this without offending somebody. Seriously, WTF do I care. Black Culture had destroyed your brains before you were even old enough to say Social Media. But oh that's right, you're black. You're the victims, it couldn't possibly be your fault you didn't learn shit in school
😭😭
ariyan’s hair color is everything frfr
i did get the 8 minutes right and i guessed .. sue me
Im pretty sure all y'all got the first one wrong. 7 HALF hours = 7 x 30 = 210 minutes... Nobody said seven AND A half hours smh
Is no one going to talk about how GORGEOUS they all look in their matching outfits!
Courtney react to the channal Anna solves.....they nearly have million subscribers
12:11 nah it's easy, got it right

4:23 the realization hella funny 😂
I'm so proud of Courtreezy because she's on trending. We've gone so far Reezys. But I just know that this is just the beginning for us and our queen.
I searched reezy meaning and it said reezys are handsome, talented and kind people
i was in tears at the end
Jesus loves you so so much and he died for you so we can be forgiven and go to Heaven with God if you accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior so repent from your sins. God bless you🙏🏼
ARIANS LAUGH WHEN SHE GOT THE OCEAN CABLE ONE RIGHT I CANT

The only temperature that Fahrenheit and Celsius is equal is negative 40 not 40.
I think it’s the headmaster and professor woods or whatever his name the one that thinks he’s cool but not I forgot his name
Ariyan all I cared about in school was popularity but popularity didn't care about me same 😭😭😭😭😭
Technically the closest planet to earth changes every once in a while based on the orbits
0:37 “except the unexpected” So if you expect the unexpected that means you’re expecting it so what do you do?
Yay I play switch craft it’s so good and addicting
Australia is bigger than greenland and also technically the Americas and Eurasia and Africa are bigger than Australia and are all technically islands
BIG BODY BENZ 😭😭😂
This video actually made me laugh LMAOO 💀💀
seeing yall laughing together makes my day
Man these crackheads 😩😩
-40 Fahrenheit= -40 Celsius not 40
If you ask Siri, it says Australia is an island

Bruh the Appalachians are shorter than the Rockies
There’s four states of matter actually. Y’all forgot plasma
the planet nearest to earth is mas whattt
Ms , reezy didn't get no answer right

These niggas all look slow.
Too funny😂
The way y’all cut this like reality tv got me laughing so hard 🤣🤣 great vid 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I think y’all a wee bit to mean to doris
If dumb is funny and fun ,then -it is funny fun.
12:09 I did actually know it. Vsauce coming in clutch 💀💀💀
am i going crazy or did no one get the first question right? 'seven half hours' is 7 x 30 = 210. they put 450 which is 'seven AND a half hours'. maybe smth went wrong in editing and their question was actually 'seven & a half hours' but if it is exactly as it's written/stated in the vid then they're all wrong 😭😭
Best trio to ever exist.
Wow that was a great video, it was so funny.
PLS MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS, I LAUGHED SO HARD 💀💀
CAN WE JUST APPRECIATE THE FITSSS FOR A SECOND LIKE MELANATED QUEENS PURRR
This was sooo sooo soooooooooooooooooooooooooo FUN!!!! Please do more of these LoL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

BEDMAS is the order of priority  Brackets Exponents Division Multiplication  Addition Subtraction

This was very entertaining ladies!!!🤗
Doris reminds me so much of Gold for ItsFunneh I swear-
Courtney is such an instigator 💀

Fact- there all wrong it wasn’t an obtuse angle it was a right angle
6:41 u look like an emo girl
You guys are so cute 😂😂💗
them saying school doesnt teach us about roman numerals but i learnt roman numerals for an entire year at my school 😭
best trio
I WAS LAUGHING THE WHOLE TIME WHILE I WAS WATCHING THE VIDEO!!! They need to make more videos with each other because they funny as hell! 🤣
I thought they were gonna do the equation on the thumbnail.. 3+3x3-3+3 lol.. And it showed their answers as 12, 10 and 9. Which are all wrong. Anyone else waiting for that?
I lost it at the “big body benz” LOL
Please do an off brand dhar mahn video
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!

Please do an off brand dhar mahn video
Pls do an off brand dhar mahn video
Please do an off brand dhar mahn video
“BARACK OBAMA”
they are all wrong on the math question because it says how many minutes are in 7 HALF HOURS so the answer would be 210 not 590 or 450.
18
Courtney “not y’all counting your teeth (then counts her teeth just in case)”
I enjoyed every second of it 😭
All y’all are wrong 🤨🤨 isn’t the closet planet mercury??
Best friend I'm offended for the Africa one 😭😂
Isn’t the thumbnail 19?
#canceldoris
I LOVE THESE VIDEOSFEOIDJS
yall are so intertaining to watch
Negative 40 degrees. -40* Celsius
This was hilarious 😂😂🥰
THEY FR SAID 8 HOURS GDHJXSHGDHJS 🤣
THE ENDING 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 sticking up for you friend and the mea head reference I’m fucking peeing my pants with this encouraging ass musiccccccc 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
omg you posted on my birthday :,)))
the answer if correct the first girl is right its 12
Ngl the answers y’all had put that were supposed to be are incorrect. For example Greenland looks bigger then Australia on the Mercator projection when in actuality it isn’t. The Robinson projection is much more accurate when it comes to sizes.
Y’all are the 3 funniest people I’ve ever seen 😭😭
Title screen is easy. 3 x 3 = 9, 3 - 3 = 0, so 9 + 3 = 12. Boom
This is so funny.
A 90% ANGLE IS A RIGHT ANGLE NOT AN OBTUSE
the way i thought all of them were wrong on the first one bc the question said "seven half hours"
The emotional ending gave dahr man vibes
Yall too funny I was laughing, rolling on the floor, and I sounded like an absolute maniac in the first 5 minutes 🤣🤣
I swear this is like the best nontoxic best friend trio I’ve ever seen 🤣
18:44 pls I love y'all💀, yall funny asf
I really laughed, this was very entertaining
i love yall!! 😂 💘
Three minutes in, and I realize why I don't date...
The sun light one is easy yall good? Did you not pass grade 4 science
Your so Funny also i can BEAT YOU IN MATH 🌚
I actually learned Roman numerals in 4th grade for history
Lmaooooo my favorite TRIOOOOOOO
18 is the answer dummies
ok but I got taught that australia is the largest island in the world and I live there have I really been lied to my whole life
Doris is so hot! My fur is on fire!
PLEASE DO IT AGAIN
I just remembered that Venus is earth’s twin
lol (thumbnail) before common core and no child left behind it was PEMDAS. Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. 3+3x3-3+3 ... 3+9-3+3.... 12-6... 6.... But you know, 1 banana plus 3 grapes equals 6 unicorns now.
Reezy actually means handsome kind and talented and that’s very true
AGREED
She’s the best and the funniest!Do more vids with your friends !
Pretty sure 40 degrees isn't the same in F and C. Not sure where that answer comes from but the correct answer would have to be a negative value. Maybe it should be -40
this was sooo funny!!!
The answer:18:0
I got 6
Y'ALL'S CHEMISTRY IS CRAZY
THIS VIDEO CRACKED ME UP BRUH😂😂😂😭😭
i got greenland right and was so confused how i got it right😅
MORE. MORE.
I KNEW THE ANSWERSSS 💪🏽
BEDMAS, it has a funny sound and explains how to answer that problem.  For those still in school, it's the order in which you solve/write equations.    Brackets Exponents Division/Multiplication Addition/Subtraction  Yes, it will apply later in life and make you appear smart even when you aren't. :) Like me. :)
The Dharman moment at the end ! 💀😭😭
The answer for the on win the thumbnail is 18 :>
i, loving the harmony
6
So nobody is going to call out the fact that they wore matching coloured outfits.umm..... ok
Never learned Roman numerals in my life
12
Oh my God this is so funny🤣🤣🤣 the reality tv show callout was soo good and all the questions were easy but you guys made it so enjoyable 😂😂😂 Oh i love being a Reezy🤭🤭🤭🤭

I'm pretty sure social media doesn't make you bad at math.
When the girls are together it so funny
You all are a mess together in the best way possible.  I love it & you're all beautiful. Great job on the intros/"interviews" lol.   Is it just me or did they all misunderstand the first question? It said how many minutes are in 7 half hours, not how many minutes are in 7 and a half hours, right?
The thumbnail equals 18 idk why you need to know but yeah
as someone who has failed every single map test they ever took, i agree that geography is a social construct
Y’all I’m in middle school and I almost immediately knew the answer to the teeth one
Enjoyed this a lot!!!
Please do not think 40°F and 40°C are the same. 40°F = 4.44°C 40°C = 104°F
WHEN COURTNEY STARTING SHAKING HER HAIR AND START TYOING FADT HAD ME ROLLING
Babes, it's gotta be -40 c/f not 40. 40 in f is chilly and 40 in c is desert-like.
i love how ariyan tricked us all! her plan worked well LOL
Lol Easter island is in Chile not Greenland  💀
Doris saying “I forgot what I counted” is the story of my life.

Australia is not an island it's a continent 🤣. EVERYONE knows this
The end turned into Dharr Mann video way to quickly
32 teeth, 28 if your wisdom teeth have been removed which the average adult should have their wisdom teeth removed.  I was in my late 20s or early 30s when I got mine removed so, maybe it’s not average.  Lol!  I thought most people got theirs removed at 18.
the first one in the thumbnail is 3  DANG IT WHY DID YOU MAKE ME DO MATH
16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. 19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. 21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God..
It’s Dorisxchi’s cutaways for me 💀
First question how many minutes are in 7 half (30 mins) hours where did 450 come from cause I got 210😂

Damn dude ive been watching you for a minute and your video is on the trending page so proud!!!
Doris is gorgeous!!!
More of these!!!! I love this😂
Social media is as about as dumb as anything I I ever heard of why don't you all get a life and a job
A crying African 😀✋
I don't understand the thumbnail cause who you called "dumb" had the right answer-?
Doris: *SCHOOL IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT* Doris again: *MATH IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT* Everything is a social construct🤷🏽‍♀😂😂
Lol I swear it didn’t feel like 20 minutes lol
Please keep this series going! invite me if you want....
This is fun, pls make more episode of dumb dumber and dumbest

I hope their friendship never comes to an end
court: one time doris’ cousin said I’m a- what’s she say?    *ari: BIG BODY BENZ 👹*
I think the only time you'll really learn Roman Numerals is either in an english class or if a teacher wants to be funny and give you random facts. Other than that you really only learn it on your own when you're curious about it. But I think it's like learning to write in cursive as only certain teachers, schools, districts, or states really teach you how to write in cursive. I had learned that fact after moving to Florida from North Carolina when I had someone ask me if I knew how to write in cursive. That was my first year in middle school.
6:05 “hey, hey, shoosh” - Doris Reezy Whatever your last name, dumb dumber and dumbest YouTube video.
The person crawling makes me think of the sound “just gonna sneak on by ya here” 😂😂
I’m sick and I was physically hurting myself by how much I was laughing at 2:47 to 3:36 tbh the whole video in general was hilarious
4:36 look at Doris’s face lol
y’all might say ur middle name and last name is reezy, but baby my first, middle, and last name is reezy 😍
5:44 the African in her just jumped out 🤣🤣😭😭🤣🤣
The answer to the thumbnail: 18
I love this trio so much 😭😭
i spat out my water thank you
Y’all all just so cute & funny in different ways I love it lmao ❤️❤️
YALL ARE HILARIOUS PLEASE DO A PART 2 IM BEGGING..
You ALL got the first answer WRONG. I did the same exact thing as Doris and Ariyan at first. I calculated 7.5 hours instead of 7 HALF hours. The correct answer was 210 minutes, not 450.
courtreezy i swear you make AMAZING CONTENT
I FUCKING LOVE ARYAN
I did get it right it was not a guess 😃
Your friend that said the sun rises up in 8 days that was so dumb because if the sun rised up in 8 days we would not have the sun for 8 days ask your friend if she thought  about that and it is office that the sun rises in 8 minutes tell your friend that past she is smart😀😀 I am sorry ❤️ for you that you said 8  hours🤨
I’m sorry— but the beginning gave me a whole ab work out before school it made me laugh too much I fully started to cry 😭
LMAOAKSJA yall so funny
I find it so charming how in all their collabs, they always keep their positions. Arian on the left, Courtney in the middle, and Doris on the right.
12:17 i’ve stayed up long enough to see, 8minutes. yes, one time my brain has wondered that far😃
This girl is a miracle. I was getting my hair done and I was watching her on my phone and time passed by like a blink
The Darman monologue at the end 😂😂
Ariyans intro oml…
Why is nobody mentioning that everyone was wrong on the first question lmao
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST VIDEO EVER IM CRYINGGGGG T-T
Oh my god this video was so good and also funny but oh why is she mad that she is a loser 🤣😂🤣😂 but she mast shut up and I can't  believe that the two of you did not know that the internet was under the  ocean what did they teach you and your friend in school oh I know they teach you and your friend to be  dumber and dumbest I am  joking but I have to say I loved the video you should do a nada part please I am a big fan 😉🙂 I liked the video to
Ariyan is both cute and evil, I love her so much!
Hey, Indian here. Got all of them right. 😐. Seriously surprised at how they couldn't answer half of these extremely simple basic questions. I am just 18. The 40 degree is same in celcius and Fahrenheit comes from the formula : f-32/9=c/5. You just had to put c=f in this equation. Yes it takes 8mins approx to reach light from sun to earth. Even if u didn't know, you could have calculated using the speed of light. Rest all other questions were literally class 1 level.
can you please play episode? its a CHAOTIC game,i feel like you would love it!
8:40 “check me” PURRRR
For your thumbnail I think it’s 18 because 3+3 is 6 so 6x3 is 18 and 18-3 is 15 and obvi 15+3 is 18
8:40
"Big body benz"💀💀💀

"In school I did what I had to do and I dipped" can I get a amen 😭✋
Apparently, the fact that Venus is the closest planet to the Earth is a total myth. Mercury is not only closest to the Earth, but it's the closest to every other planet as well!

The way Courtney said gaaame 2.00 min in the video😍🤩🤩
The thumb nail is 15
i just discovered ur nigerian like me
14:11 the only reason i know the answer is because a shark or something chewed those cables and that makes the wifi in my house turned off as well as all the people using that same internet connection. I found it on the news lol, i would never have learnt it in geography
Doris : *having 5 pts* Ariyan : I'm actually mad Courtney : I'm actually confused   LMFAO YALL ARE KILLING ME

Geography 1/5 shame on me i have B+ at school!!! That was amazing totally lov that new theme video totally waiting for future!!! P.s. MARS AND VENUS AND MERCURY(this one is literally closest planet to every planet, space is strange place and everything changes all the time) THEY ARE ALL CLOSEST PLANETS TO EARTH! So yeah we all win there!!!
Ariyan getting the question about Venus correct and Courtney just running off 😭😂

Y’ALL LOOK SO CUTE AND ANIMATED
I CANT STOP CRYING THIS IS TOO FUNNY
It was a fun video
Honestly NOBODY on youtube can beat this trio, my cheeks hurt from laughing 💀
I was WEAK this whole video 😂😂
3  +  3  x  3  +  3  =   21 3  +  3  =  6 6  x  3  =  18 18  +  3  =   21 done and yall are so funny and pretty🦑🦑

OMG I just realized Doris looks so much like Priya from turning red 😩😩
I was 3:20 secs in and by then i was gonna take this vid off because i was crying tears of laughter and couldn't focus but i held on for dear life
the editing is ✨ G O L D ✨
I know dog did not just do the walk of shame in the middle of the video 😭😂
But everest is not the tallest! I mean kinda but the same time no! Whatever it is tallest MOUNTAIN so yeah
15:51 Australia is a country, it can be considered an island and it can be considered a continent, but it's not often considered all three.
I'm 12 how am I getting specific answers right and they all getting it wrong. And the reason why people are going to Mars is because it's better temperature and has good material for humans  compared to Venus
Ariyan is correct with her answer 56 countries in Africa just that only 54 have been recognized...there are 56 countries in Africa but only 54 are major
12:43 why 40 degrees? isnt it -40
"how do you look at a number and think it's another number"  *me and my handwriting will be leaving now yall*
Yall are so hilarious 🤣😂🤣 i love being a reezy🥰
YALL ARE SO CUTE AND COORDINATED IN THE MATCHING COLORS :sob:
This video made me become 💫reezy💫
The actual tallest is in hawaii hut since its sunken underwater the tallers over sea level is mount ever.

‘checkmate’ 😭
Nahh cuz doris saying "Umm listen" while taking of the glasses is my response to almost every situation

You three together is the best collab ever💕💕😭😭😭😭I want them to have a channel together.
you three have such a fantastic dynamic, i love watching y'all collab in vids <3
The Australian deserts cover over a million square kilometres of the country. Australia is the only continent without glaciers. While Australia is significantly larger than Greenland, Greenland often appears larger on maps because of the distortion caused by proximity to the North Pole (I copy and pasted this from safari, don’t attack me)
okay but what’s dorris’ lip combo
I'm so obsessed with this channel right now
cackling the whole time i love yall
We need more of these 🤣🤣 videos so funny and i learn a lot of things too 🤣🤣🤣
Yall are so funny😭😂🤣🤣🤣
Please do more of these. I absolutely loved this! <3
Not to be THAT person, but: There are 210 minutes in 7 half-hours. 1 half-hour = 30 minutes. 6 × 30 = 210. If the question was how many minutes are in 7 AND a half hours, then 450 minutes would be correct. 1 hour = 60 minutes. (7 × 60) + 30 = 420 + 30 = 450.
yall so pretty and funny its just a joy to watch
I might not feel good today and still have to go to school but this made me laugh and smile 😊🥰💜
The introductions had me weaakk. This is some top tier content right here 🤩
Lol i first didn’t see the “ ** “ sign at Dumbass so i kept reading Dumba like how you pronounce Bumba

Courtney I’m South African gotta say I’m kinda disappointed in you for not knowing how may countries are in Africa 🥺😂😂🥺🥺

“ I literally haven’t heard anybody’s talk about Venus unless it’s Venus from Tennis” that part had me dying

I was so confused as to why any of y’all got that first one right lol the question said 7 HALF hours so 30min. (210) But I’m pretty sure y’all did 7 AND A HALF hours. (450)
I became a reezy today I didn't regret it ✨✨✨✨

THE REALITY TV SHOW FORMAT IS GIVINNGGGG
THE SISTERS ARE BAAAAACKKKK
Hi there stranger. You don't know me but I wanted to spread the good truth of Jesus Christ and I encourage that you stay and learn more❤✝️.  See God created the first of humankind and gave our first descendants dominion over the earth and things in it but we soon rebelled against God and so sin was born into the knowledge and actions of humankind. Thankfully enough we have the opportunity to rid ourselves of sin and reconcile with God the holy father through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ the son of God. He died on the cross for our sins and took the punishment we were supposed to receive, defeating sin in the process and freeing whosoever seeks salvation in him.. giving unto them a new and beautiful life with him as a born again child of God. I would love to see each and every single person on this earth receive salvation and avoid eternal damnation so I spread the good news in hopes that I can get as many people to repent and receive Christ before his second coming. The kingdom of God is near. I pray that who ever reads this considers a life in Christ and repents from the wickedness of this world before it's too late. We don't have much time. I urge you please get right with the one true living God.Jesus loves you and so do I <3 Be blessed my loves<\3 JOHN 3:15 -21 MARK 1:15🤍❤
I dare you to read Wattpad stories

“Being imperfect is perfect, and guess what I’m perfect” imma start saying that 😅 I love this content!!
Fun mathematical way to do the teeth question: Count from one of your backmost teeth to the nearest front tooth. Then multiply by 4 because that’s half of half of the amount of your teeth. At the end, add back in however many teeth you know you are missing. I have no wisdom teeth so I did 7x4+4 and that ended up being 32, which was right. I am a god.
the the thumgnail answer is 18 :)
everything is a social construct 😭
TECHNICALLY Australia is the largest island in the world but it's been labeled as a continent so Greenland takes the title of "largest island". Australia is nearly 4 x the size of Greenland purrr
OH MY GOD YALL-💀  I literally searched the meaning of reezy in the urban dictionary and it has an actual definition.                                   It’s official,reezy’s are the best people in the internet.

I only knew that -40c and f was the same cause I saw a Canadian say it online once and it's stuck with me ever since.
It's -40 degrees not 40 degrees
Y'all crack me up EVERY single time without fail😂
These questions humbled me💀
Underrated joke: "what is geography?" 😂

18:40 ✨Disney tings✨
This was such a great video, everything was top tier!! Love how much fun you guys have together, it warms my heart ♥️♥️
I got the sun light question right because I talked to a guy in some space science major
the ending; what in the darman
*negative 40, buuuttttt doesn't matter 😌💅💯
It’s 18😭
-is this an inside joke? -YOU ARE INSIDE OF THE JOKE   PLZZZZZZZZ
the alarm going off for every question caused me physical pain
I read the question as “seven HALF hours” not “ seven AND A HALF hours” so I got 210 cuz 30min times 7 is 210 😭😭😭
I love the color matching, QUEENS
court listen. i watch all of ur videos and you’re hilarious asf but when yall three come together it’s SUCH A BANGER DUDE !! if u guys collab more often you’ll all get way more recognition because you guys are just so genuine and HILARIOUS PLS
The intros? Bye 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
13:44  all we care about
"Popularity never cared about me." 😭
learning+comedy is just a whole w
That was too good😭
I LOVE HOW THEYRE MATCHING
I answered “minutes in seven half hours” as 210 and then questioned my whole being when I saw 450 before realizing they solved “minutes in seven AND a half hours”
I LOVE HOW YALL JUST INSULT EACH OTHER 💀
3+3x3-3+3=18
my fav mf trio y’all are so beautiful and hilarious <333
my favourite trioo!!! 🔥🥺💜
Big body benz
please do more!!! love this trio
Nothing better then being a reezy 😌
i loveeeed this video <3
I’ve never laughed at the first like 5 minutes of a video more than this lmao  Edit: I can confirm the rest of the video was just as fucking hilarious. One of the few videos I’ll actually save to watch again later.
The fact I knew the sun takes 8 minutes because someone told me that if the some blue up we wouldn’t notice until 8 minutes after
The first question says “how many minutes are in 7 half hours” instead of 7 and half a hour so I put 210 because 7 half hours = 210… I beat y’all in writing…
ugh, Ariyan Rosé literally made. my day in this video. Ur charm and constant laughs always get to me!!
she said “to the earf” lmaoooo 😭😭
This made me remember while i was in 7th grade when my teacher said what does h2o consist of and i said h, 2 and o
Can we just appreciate that note Courtney hit at 2:03
I love how their all matching with green!
Ariyan out of nowhere: BARACK OBAMA ✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽
Editing was super good in this one! Laughing the whole way through
more this pls, i love the reality tv style interviesssss
This is a whole show 🤭
can yall do this again? so good
12:08 No. I knew the answer cuz it came in my final exam of 7th grade
“I counted twenty in my top row” got me dead💀💀💀🪦
Aryans arm direction confusion is killing me 😅🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Y’all killed me with big body Benz😭😭😭
“Geography: Geograph-HE…… do you *hear* the patriarchy???” Lmfaooooo
😂❤️❤️
Aww I love the matching fits. Y'all are so cute <3
Ariyan : " is this an inside joke?'"  Doris : " Babe you're InSide the joke ! "  Cracked me up 😂
Ariyan laughing after her "missing teeth" joke.... *chef's kiss*
I love you guys together, have me dying !!
I love so much how yall are matching😍💕
guys pls tell me the first one is 210. bc if it’s 7 1/2 hours that’s 3 and a half hours so 210 minutes. or do they mean 7 and a 1/2?
not the color coordination looking beautiful like always <3
18:54 I DIED
she said "is that an inside joke" "you are INSIDE of the joke babe"
Okay, but I think many people get their wisdom teeth out, so it’s 28 teeth, not 32.
watching this while i'm supposed to prepare for my math exam i say i'm doing it
Tell me why I read the English trans of the Roman numeral as thirty five three
the confessionals... the matching outfits... the cinnamon toe graphy... mama this is art. love it and pls do more

OMG THE “I’m the winner of this gAaAAaAaAame” SOUNDED SO GOOD
17:14 if you round 54 to the nearest number it's 2 because you can't round from a 4 to a 5, if it's 4 it's below 4, if it's five it's over 5
I will literally watch anything you three do together. It's just the vibes 😂
Shouldn't the first question have been 210 minutes? Since the question was how many for 7 half hours and not 7 AND a half hours.
i see y’all with the color COOR👏DIN👏ATION
16:22 ez pizzy 😝
the venus question was actually wrong it's mercury ahahahaha
Courtney I thought that you were Christian so why would you support a game based on witchcraft and lgbtq
I love that you’re all matching with green . Pls moreeeeee of these
DISLIKED😝😝😝
Courtney I thought you were Christian but you were supportive to a witch craft game and lgbtq
The cartoon Arthur taught me that there's "54 things to see and to explore in Africa"
12:43 It's actually -40 degrees... Btw, love y'all 💖
answer to the thumbnail is 8 I think btw
"Is this an inside joke?" "YOU'RE INSIDE OF THE JOKE, BABE"
4 minutes in and my mouth hurts for smiling so much
THIS WAS SO FUNNY
my flex is that i knew the greenland one. dont ask me abt them other questions though LMAO
Me after I solved the thumbnail: *I guess I'm just smart*   *P.s I was wrong*
NAURR SEEENICE
Ok but the short  silence got me😂
12:12 I feel so fckn smart rn bro I'm 14 and I confidently answered 8 min cuz I like astronomy and sci-fi videos... the power I WEILD. Also AYYYEEE I got 7 right 💪 Ps: Venus isn't actually the closest planet to Earth, Mercury is.
"See-ence💁🏾‍♀️" 🤣🤣🥰🥰
Fun fact: the term "Reezy" has been added to urban dictionary multiple times.

Lol loving the matching colour
Not me misreading the temperature questions and thinking there was a whole other degree system
I hate being this person... but there's actually 5 states of matter: Solid, Gas, Liquid, Plasma and one that was recently (overall) discovered called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). That's one of the only few things I learned when I was in the college of math and physics for animation (don't ask)
It said 7 HALF hours. 😭😭😭💀
Did anyone else see that they all were rocking green?
HIII
does anyone know the music name of the outro song? its such a banger and i need it
Yall too cute love d vibes
THIS IS SO FUNNY IM CRYING 💀💀

Btw, i think the answer for the equation on the thumbnail is 6
Actually the nearest planet to the earth is mercury did I hear it wrong
I'm currently sick and this trio makes feel so much better- LOVE YALL 🥺💞
That first answer wasn’t 210 minutes or was I reading it wrong?? 😂😂
I SPIT MY DRINK OUT WHEN YALL FOUND OUT VENUS WAS THE ANSWER

Ariyan’s laugh is so contagious! I love y’all’s chemistry! Thank you and please keep making people’s days better with your friendship ❤️
the color coordination 😭
i love you guys so much together! you guys always make me laugh😭❤️
the way Courtney put 343 on te Roman numeral one 💀
So... No one is talking about the cute matching clothes they look like queens periodt 🙌❤️✨
❤❤❤ I swear this is me and my homegirls
You three are a force to reckon with
Best collab ever ❤️❤️❤️❤️✨✨✨✨
it was venus and mars
😍 love this group
the intro is liiiiiiiit gj giiirls
Babies are born with a total of 52 teeth. Only 20 of these are milk teeth, whereas 32 of those are adult teeth.
Yall have no business being this funny lmao
ik it was 8 mins cause my dad said if the son were to explode we would all die in 6 minutes
"you didn't count right babe, and you got missing teeth" the scream i have scrummeddd this was comedy gold ahahahahaha
HOW CAN THEY BE SO FUNNY
Me sitting and laughing uncontrollably while knowing im dumber than them….
I love u and ur videos ur my role model
Lovingg the channel collab's!!
Ariyan: is this an inside joke? Dori: You’re in the joke babe!!   That got me 😂😂😂
12:15 nah I knew this cuz I was apart of the astronomy club and took part in astronomy internships and apprenticeship
your look beautiful african girls  👩🏾👩🏾👩🏾
This made my day
This video got me dying the whole time
love the matching outfits!!!
I looked it up and it said Mercury is the closest not venus
It’s 12. I calculated it
For the teeth question i just remembered chip skylark's shiny teeth and me and he said something like "when ive got 32" 😂
I’m currently in school and I have never once learned 1 Roman numeral
When the guys started crawling on the floor 🤣🤣 this video really took me out!
It’s illegal to be this funny 💀🤣
8:40 "checkmate"
Pls do more videos w them with the individual segments also. This is so sad but girl I got no friends and this genuinely makes me feel like I’m apart of a funny friend group
DORIS WRITING KELVIN SENT ME
11:14 Ariyan’s and Courtney’s head drop was in sync y’alllll 🤩🤩🤩😉😉
Am I the only one that was confused by the first question? Wouldn't 7 half hours be 7 times 30 minutes?
“YOURE INSIDE OF THE JOKE BABE” i’m crine this how slow i be😭
mount everest is not the tallest mountain 😭
Its 12!!!!!!!
Did we really just got a Dhar Man moment at the end 😍
OKAY BUT ARIYAN ROSE IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL NAME
y'all were all wrong on the first question it's 210. seven half hours = 30 minutes, 7 times. 7 x 30 = 210 minutes
I haven't laughed so hard in a long time, it's always a banger to see you all happy and having fun together! I really love this new series and can't wait to watch more of it. Thanks Courtreezy for this awesome video! Btw the editing is also top tier, we love to see it <3
the problem on the thumbnail the answer was 21 lol took me like 2 seconds to figure it out
i bet ariyan is still riding that venus high
It's the matching fashions for me
I love it when you 3 collab
BRO WHAT’S THE ANSWER TO THE THUMBNAIL I NEED CLOSURE
Technically we’re all on big islands. 😀
i learnt a lot of stuff today thank you babes
the iconic trio has reunited 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Not y’all having a Dhar Man moment at 18:40 😭
*She won fair and square* _EUUHHWW_
are we just gonna ignore that there are 4 states of matter?
It's so funny that it took them 4 MINUTES just to start the video. Like they kept playing with each other and I was getting impatient 🤣😭
Love the switchcraft ad 😍 it actually is a good game. The story line is really good in the beginning at least.
I’m pretty sure they were all wrong on the first question 💀 seven HALF hours, not seven and a half hours. That means 7 30 minutes. So the answer should be 210
court act like she in a teen drama every 5 seconds 😭💀💀
Why did I get 18
These girls are so funny I love them❤️
court act like she in a teen drama every 5 seconds 😭💀💀
I love their friendship. I wish I had at least two friends like that. Heck, I wish I had one friend.

Thank you so much.
i was patiently awaiting for your upload from this day, and it was so worth that wait
the "reality show" type in this video is just... 🤩
yessssssssss moreeeeeeee
Thumbnail awnser is 15 because pemdas parentheses exponents multiplication division addition and subtraction multiply first because of the order so 3x3 then add  the addition +9 cause 3+3+3 = 9 so 18 then subtract 3 and you get 15

“Geography is a social construct.” Youre so fright Courtney! Abolish boarders solely so Geography as a subject doesn’t exist anymore.
This is hilarious.  Please do more of these.
First of ALL, Mercury is in fact the closest planet not only to Earth, but to the remainder of the 6 planets (or 7 depending on if you think Pluto is a planet).

noti: The American School System title:
AHHH THEY’RE BACKKKKK TOGETHER😍😍😍✨
HEYY
It was hilarious
I did that in my head  =18
I want this kinda friendship😭
it was Big Body Benz for me😂😂😂😂
3+3×3-3+3=18     *And I will despise the calculator forever. And yes I just guessed.*
purrrrr the color coordination if yall dont know also my first name is reezy soo
you looked emo when you were talking about the sponsorship
They sounded like they were in Dhar Mann in the end 😭
I'm obsessed with this trio ❤️❤️❤️
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH
gonna end up making a vid about this in a few minutes  3 + 3 x 3 - 3 + 3  lord please read this pls pls pls  tl;dr: possible answers are 18 and 12. (for those who didn't see the reply under courtreezy's comment)  there are two ways that i see to solve this. (honors math student here)   the first version is straight forward. 3 + 3 is 6.  6 x 3 is 18. 18 - 3 is 15. and 15 + 3 is 18 again. therefore a possible answer would be 18.  now let's try order of operations. the system for order of operations is PEMDAS order. (for multiplication and division/addition and subtraction, it could go either way since when you go from left to right, you do which you see first) Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction.  3 x 3 is 9. 3 + 9 is 12. 12 - 3 is 9. and 9 + 3 is 12. so it could also be 12.
This was so funny. I loved these types of videos
YALL ALWAYS MAKE ME LAUGH LMAOO
This has easily become my favourite video of yours, y'all are too funny :D
16:20 I CANT

I cannot! Y’all are too funny🤣🤣🤣
Y’all am I the only one who got 210 for the question “how many minutes are in 7 half hours? Because a half hour is 30 minutes and then 7 x 30 = 210  ????
This video gives me good vibes. Just three friends having fun
I love it when you three film together! Guaranteed laughs! 🤣😃💖💖
Doris and I are matching hair!!!!

Everyone’s introductions got me rolling on the floor 😂 😂 I CANT 🤣
When you're so early to the video you notice the title change
“If you got the answer right, you guess”   FIRST OF ALL I SAID THE ANSWER BEFORE YALL WROTE ANYTHING!!!💀💀
Ngl the questions are low key hard.
They technically were all wrong on the first question tho 😭 it asked about 7 half hours rather than 7 and a half hours so the answer would be 210 minutes
I wish I had friends like this!!! I would be so happy omg!
Hii
yoooo i can’t breathe 😭😭😭 16:20
Y’all are so funny 😭
Yall please do this again!!!!😭 hilarious
I love everything about this. This video is everything. 🤣
“Watch this video whilst trying not ✨LOL✨” challenge 😂😅cos I failed…miserably.
yes
the celcius question was wrong because its 40 and -40 <3
Y'all are too much 🤣😂😂 I love the energy you guys give lol and y'all are wearing matching color outfits too!!! That so wholesome!
Are they siblings??
No offence, its -40°, not 40°. 🥹
no courtney we all got the 8 mn one right without guessing just remember speed of light is incredibly fast <3
Thumbnail question answer: 18 (I think-)
Did you guys all plan on wearing sage green? Because yall look amazing 👏
Help for the math part at first I got 4,260
i love that you guys edited this like a reality show lmao
"She won fare and square, It's time for you to accepted that loser"

The awnser on the cover of the video.. is literally 6,
y’all got the first one wrong 😂 7 half hours = (7 x 30min = 210) had me questioning myself lol
❤❤❤
i just had a really bad day and seeing that notification pop up on my screen saying that you posted with the girls my day automatically turned into a ten 💞💞
“Is this an inside joke”  “UR INSIDE OF THE JOKE BABE”  💀💀💀
I hope everyone else loves these three as much as me.
I luv them so much they are my fav trio on the internet❤️❤️
When y'all said that Venus was the closest to the sun I was slightly confused. My teachers - and google - have always told me it was Mercury. So, I can't tell if I'm dumb or—
you should make another round  :) Congratulations to the winner, Ariyan was the best !
Ariyan is the secretly smart one I love herrrr
Aryan: is this an inside joke?  Doris: YOURE INSIDE THE JOKE BABE 💀
Y’all are always so funny together 🤣🤣🤣
I was taught roman numerals for maybe a week in sixth grade, never seen it again in school since besides sections or chapters in a book
I think the answer is 18
Courtney: “American School System has failed us” Me: “ASS has failed us”
I got it right where the question was “how long does it take for the suns light to reach earth?”. I didn’t guess, I got it right bc rn my unit of inquiry at school is about space
I love how they were matching lime colored clothing, especially Ariyan, her fit was so cute!!
I love you and your friends
Why this outro music 😂
What I’ve learned from this video: everything is a social construct
I love Ariyan's laugh! 😂😆
Ariyan has me DYING! HER LAUGH IS CONTAGIOUS 😂
Courtney: "As you can saw in the title" Me: *is she ok*
A crime was committed 😂
At 3:16 is when i spit my noodles out XD "bIg BoDy BeNz"
Me: Thinking my homegirls are gonna get the Africa question right. Also me after their answers: 👁👄👁                                                                 💧

Ngl Doris did have a point in the beginning..
you guys should do song association again hehehe
I was just doing my maths homework and studying for tomorrow's exam and i see this on yt I'm feeling positive..  (I still haven't watched the video tho let's see how it goes)
The editing and the introductions had be cackling
Wait y'all saying Greenland is bigger than Antarctica??? Cuz Antarctica is most definitely an island, and is absolutely massive.  Also no one talks about Venus even though it's closer than Mars because it's covered in toxic gas. Pretty sure. Don't quote me.
The friend group I wish I had.
PLEASEEEEE THIS WAS SOOOOO FUN ILY SMMMM 💞💞💞💞💞
3 of them matching green is wholesome
Why yall all wearing green and who was that pokemon crawling on the floor ur brother?
“BIG BODY BENZ” I CANT- 💀🤣🤣🤣🤣
As someone who knows a lot about astronomy I already knew it took 8 minutes for suns light to reach the earth

10:52 was it just me or did anyone say "at morning and past morning"
Am I the only one that didn't have interest in the game until she brought up the representation 🤣
Doris looks so funny with the glasses 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m in 5th grade and I know all the answers to this like lol I can’t 😂
"Fight each other" 😭💀
OMG PLEASE KEEP MAKING THIS! THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST VIDEO YOU UPLOADED YET
Everything is a social construct
Isn't 1.5.is the answer for the second question?
I wish I was as smart as Ariyan, and was as close with my friends as y'all.
Stop i litterally cant stop laughing
why at the end it become a dhar mann video!?🌝
So funny!!These are my kind of friends
I love watching your videos and i am a Reezy

Giiirrrlll I done found Lydia but it’s get crazier!!!
I'm early
“Is this an inside joke?” “YOU’RE INSIDE OF THE JOKE BABE.”  💀💀
Omg y'all so pretty
Everyone talks about Mars more because Mars is in the “Goldilocks” zone/close enough where it isn’t too hot/cold for life to potentially live/exist while Venus is too hot and covered in gas
53 mins early🤭
16:55 If i don't get it right I'm so sorry to all the Africans out there, ✊ 💀💀💀💀
I’m sorry the thumbnail isn’t it 18?
Wow now I fell dumb
The picture for the video is 18 lol
THIS WAS TO FUNNY
This video was funny just like the other ones and y’all should do more together ❤️❤️❤️❤️
When Courtney said “Ewo” in that Nigerian accent I was dead💀😂😂😂🤌🏾🤌🏾
Enjoyed this video soo much
Man y’all killing me with your intros alone 😂
DORIS IS SO FUNNY 💀
Pls do more of this ❤️
BIG BODY BENZ 😭
next time you all should do general knowledge questions. it was reallly funnnnnyyyy
12:09  Me who got it right bc I actually knew:  👀🧍🏽‍♀️
When the answer to the first one was actually 210 and yet they counted 450 as correct 😭😭😭😭😭😭
All I care about was popularity but popularity didn’t care about me 💀
Haven’t even watched this but I know it’s gonna be real good
12:10 no bc the way she looks in the camera and calls me out makes me feel like she’s right in front of me, judging me 🤣
Pls make more of this
This is the best video of the fantastic trio. Come thru Queens ❤️
You made my day 💖
I literally love you guys😭❤️❤️❤️
“My titties is north” - Ariyan 2022
"All I care about is north, South, east, and West. And my titties, is north." 😂😂🤣🤣
I LOVE THE COLOR COORDINATION
What is Ariyan name essence cause that’s mine too
I didn’t know Courtney was such a good singer
Wouldn't the answer to the first question be 210 mins? It said 7 HALF hours which is equal to 3 and a half hours. There is 60 minutes in 1 hour and 30 minutes in a half hour. 3 full hours would be 60 three times which is 180 and 1 half hour means 30 minutes. 180 + 30 = 210
As a Spanish speaker, the way Reesy said "matemáticas" sounded so fancy!
I'm so glad to be a reezy
OH MY GOD YOU POSTED THIS EXACTLY ON MY BIRTHTIME AND MY BIRTHDAY-
12:12   I didn't guess, Courtney 😂😂🤲🏻  Una well done ❤  Edit: Moment when the mean girl in the high school cliché movie gets the talk from her friend(minion) about how she should loosen up. Then the mean girl sees reason(lol)
this trio reminds me of my friend group every answer gets dumber 😭😭😭
in my school you only learn roman numerals in advanced so...yeah
The challenge hasnt even started and they had my laughing so hard
DISNEY'S RAVEN theme song lolミ
“How many minutes are in seven half hours?”         Wouldn’t the answer be 210 minutes or am I over thinking????
God loves u all! Share the gospel not forcing
BTW ILY COURT!<3  I hope the best for you in life :}
omg i need all the videos like this!! y'all are hilarious!!
“EWOOO” 😭😭 typical Nigerian

watching this felt like i was fighting for my life lmaooooooo y'all are so funny together pls do more of this
Wait yall if i'm correct didn't they all get the first one wrong😭. Since it said how many minutes were in 7 "half hours" which is just 7 × 30 = 210, not 450? (If i'm wrong ima just go ☠)
I love these three 😤💗
“is this an inside joke” “YOURE INSIDE THE JOKE BABE!” IM CRYING 😭😭💀

COURT I HOPE U SEE THIS, U MAKE MY DAY AND IN LOV UR VIDS SO SO MUCH ❤️
Is it just me or did they all get the first question WRONG. The question was how many minutes were in 7 half hours not 7 AND a half hour. The answer should’ve been 210 minutes not 450 minutes.
great videos
*All i care about is North South East West, and mah Titties is North*  What a poet
"is this an inside joke?"  "YOURE INSIDE THE JOKE BABE"  y'all i need your collabs more often plzzzz
I'm actually a Genius I have been my whole life and even I knew it was 450
I sure hope this was a social experiment... cuz I can’t— 😭😭😭
It the Dhar Man moment in the end for MEeEeee
Yall queen is back 👁👄👁
I love this trio
Ariyan slays in red hair 🤭
umm 90 degree angle is called a right angle
I LOVE WHEN THE GROUPS ALL TOGETHER
hi
CAN YOU REPLY TO MY COMMENT ITS MY DREAMMMMMMMM
The music for the fake CONFESSIONAL is sending me 🤣🤣😭😭
I'll tell you why it isn't mars, Mars is the 1st planet and Venus is the 2nd  so if Earth is the 3rd planet that means Venus is closer
Yo I think the first question is supposed to be 210 because it's 7 half hours, so 7*30 = 210. Unless you meant 7 and a half hours, 7.5 * 60 = 450
im early or late, idk
Y’all should try a black history one
The fact that im so much younger than them and I knew 32 🤣
COURTREEZY I LOVE YOU AND YOUR VIDEOS 🫶 thank you for posting
I’m an astronomy nerd so I actually did get the sun one right… 💀 yikes does that mean I’m a total nerd? Lol edit: oh no I got the Venus one right too because “it’s our sister planet so it must be closer” and when they said “nobody talks about Venus” I’m like “oh no I talk about Venus all the time” I’m done for
finally a video more than 13 mins 😪
Tell me why they all look so gorgeous??? There pretty best friends. 😌✨

3+3×3-3+3= 18
I got off of switch craft to watch this
“is this an inside joke?” “you’re inside of the joke babe”
THE TRIOOOOOOO
I love how we get a little "interview " in the beginning of the video 😇😇
I love the matching color outfits!
IM IN ELEMANTARY AND I KNOW THAT IT WAS 8 min like icantbolive
Dorisxchi using the "is a social construct" argument every single time is such a mood. Lmao
I’m early ❤️
15 MINS AYYY
i love you courtney<3. so glad that im a ✨REEZY✨
i got the question about the sun right because they taught me that in school lol
THE BIG BODY BENZ FUCKEN SENT ME And sent Doris runnin’
Glad to be a reezy, imagine if I was the judge having y’all do geometry.
Courtney is such a instigator and I love itt 🤣🤣
YALL BE COUNTING TEETH 😭😭😭
I started counting my teeth too 😭😭😭😭😭

Bro on the thumb nail…the answer is 18
I.....I'm still struggling to figure out how they got 450 for the first question......did I not understand the question? 7 half hours...7 sets of 30.....210....
Can we talk about the person crawling in the back?!😭😭😭😟☝️😰
YESSSS THE TRIO ARE BACKKK
I love that you guys we’re wearing the same color
I loved Doris confident in the beginning 😭
If you go to an African or Asian school the system is so much broader and better than most American or western schools. It’s also very competitive and prepares you for everything. That’s why I’m grateful for my mom for enrolling me in a Nigerian boarding school 💕💕
I love these videos lol. There so entertaining! I’m glad I’m a reezy!
“school was made by the white man and we need to revolt” 💀
“Don’t second guess” *”I don’t even have a first guess”*
