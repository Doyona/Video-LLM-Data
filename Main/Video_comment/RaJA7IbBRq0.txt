Wait is this an nba youngboy diss? I might be late but I just put it together.
You guys ain't heard nothing if you haven't  heard "Someone to love" and listen to Queens version it is epic and Freddie Mercury is one of the only people I respect as a singer and my list of those people are very small he had charisma of a God. This song is an extremely bad song it's 1/10. I would say 0/10. Freddie Mercury songs are on a scale of Their Own

† We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing in our hearts that Jesus died for us, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we have done or will do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                          †  Romans 10:9

HE IS THE GOAT whenever he drops i feel it too my core
Don't put your trust in men, put your trust in God. Jesus is coming soon and it's time to repent. We are all sinners in need of a Savior. No one is perfect. We cannot earn salvation. It is a free gift from God. Mary doesn't save you, confessing to a priest doesn't save you, religion doesn't save you, self-help doesn't save you, meditating doesn't save you, Buddha doesn't save you. Only faith in Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection saves you. The Father gave His only begotten Son to die for our sins, and whoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life. Cry out to Him now. He loves you so much.. but He won't force Himself on you. True love allows freedom to choose. If you don't want Him, He'll give you what you want - eternity without Him in hell. If you genuinely admit you're a sinner and need His sacrifice to pay for your sins, He will cover your debt and give you life forever with Him in heaven. I hope and pray you choose life.   This is realer than you could ever imagine.
Always a banga❤️‍🔥your the best fr,that aside I hope you okay and if you ain’t I pray you do get better and also achieve all your dreams🦅❤️
that beat fire. the flow jus inconsistent
My grandma dead I wish the other one would love me more

For 175 days, Bloodthirsty Russia continues to kill Ukrainian children, civilians, destroy infrastructure and even kill prisoners of war, as in the city of Olenivka. Since the beginning of the war, 361 children have died, 711 children have been injured. Russia has started a war, arranges gas blackmail, because of Russia there may be problems with food in the world. Russian troops continue shelling the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. To recognize Russia as a sponsor of terrorism is to prevent nuclear terrorism and the threat of a new terrible catastrophe to the whole world. #russiaterroriststate #olenivka

Repent and believe in the Gospel of Jesus Christ before it's too late, God loves you!   For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;   Romans 3:23 KJV   But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.   Romans 5:8 KJV   For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.   Romans 6:23 KJV   that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.   Romans 10:9 NKJV   For God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   John 3:16 KJV     God loves you, Jesus loves you! Repent and believe in Jesus Christ today with a sincere heart in faith, and by the grace of God you will inherit the gift of eternal life! If you believe in Jesus you will NEVER die! (John 11:25) God bless you!
