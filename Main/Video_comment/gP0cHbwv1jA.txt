I love your short hair! As I’m writing this I’m at the part where you say you’re getting a Brazilian blowout lol and this is what I was here to comment on. If you get a Brazilian you may not need the extensions since it’ll be flatter and smoother and changes the texture so it would be much less maintenance!
hahahahaha the last bit
Omg I usually watch all your vlogmas. Here I am bingeing to catch up! 😅
Nothing like going up the stairs and all I start to hear is ummm. I’ve never laughed to hard😂
the umms had me in laughing so much at the end hahaha
Ah. You met your lobster 🦞 😂
instant tears at the club scenario
😂 Alfie’s payback
Question: does your anxiety spout from solid reason. e.g: ottie, vlogging pressure etc, or does it come out of nowhere and is mostly unexplainable. Love you guys x
Question: Do you see eachother in a rawer light after having Ottie?
19:00 - I also couldn’t burp and had botox and was cured! I drink carbonated things ALL DAY now. Highly recommend looking into it.
loved the compilation at the end alfie !!!
dying at the um's hahaha, Alfie ur a legend
I love hoe Alfie calls her gorgeous as her nickname😍
Allfffiiieeee the "ums"!!! You didn't have to do her dirty like that 😂😂😂😂
Funny how the editing changes the videos up!!  I Love how both of you just light up when talking about how you met!!  It was a wonderful  magical time !!
Alfie going “It’s not all about the size but I’ve got big pieces is all I’m saying” 😳😳😳
I love that some of the "um"s were longer or shorter than others 😂😂
Um bloopers in every single vlogmas please it’s like a little ending jingle haha auto tune it to a Christmas song for extra points 😅😂
Whoever is interested: Saying um really isn’t something to feel bad for, it’s a hesitation marker that gives you a bit of time to plan what to say next and shows that you intend on saying something else. I’m studying Linguistics and when I learned that it really reassured me😅
That was sooooooo great , made me laugh 😂, the love you have for Otti was so beautiful in the Q & A . Thanks so much ❤️
Watching your videos everyday just makes me so happy 😊
OMG I LOVE THE END 😂😂
What straightener are you using?
The end was EPID😂🫶🏼
Loved the um's! Thanks Alfie !!!😂😅🤣
I literally have so many new baby hairs after loosing hair post partum! Sometimes it just looks like I got really short bangs LOL
When that fridge bibed I thougth it was my own firealarm.. I got so scared 😂
One of my favourite zalfie videos! The um part was cherry on top 😊
Also i love your teamwork!!!! It’s the best ❤
You've just reminded me to order fire extinguishers and fire blankets for my house and car, thanks for the reminder! We had a fire when I was a teenager caused by a light bulb pointing at a plastic box which melted then set on fire 😳 My Mum made sure we had a fire safety plan/exits from every bedroom after it :/
The best 😂❤🎉 and so glad you’re all save 🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
fun fact about the "how are you" question: I live in Hungary but work at a multinational company and I've heard it so many times that Hungarians are too honest :D it is not custom for us, to answer "good, how about you?" to this question. if someone asks, we will tell you exactly how we are, good or bad :D so anytime someone from UK or US asks me this I have to remind myself that they most likely don't expect a personalised response to their question. I do think that there is value in honestly checking in with each other even at a workplace, I hope some foreigners living here also find the beauty in it:)
Possibly one of my fave vlogmas’ all cosy and pure! Loved the q&a!!🥰❤️
The very end 🤣🤣🤣 I’m loving vlogmas sooo much
I can’t burp either 😂
LOVE THIS SO MUCH!❤️
I need an um compilation every day if vlogmas 🤣 it made me laugh so much.
YES the ums at the end 😂❤❤❤
my dear Zoe, the way you spoke about your hair... "frizzy" is just undone and burshed out curly hair. You have curly hair !!! you should try and look up the curly hair method/bowl method. Just wash you hair, apply leave-in conditioner, hair gel / gelee, scrunch, and then you're done <3
omg team no burping!! I can only gurgle too hahah!
Have you seen the Lights for Fun sale eg .Halloween huge reductions !
The end is the best 😂😂😂❤
that ending was perfect 🤣
There is something really special knowing Alfie is editing Zoe's vlogs. Even though you really can't tell it's not Zoe. I think it's because and maybe I'm describing this badly, you see Zoe through Alfies eyes. You can feel the love. It's been so lovely watching these. Obviously seeing Ottie is a huge highlight and of course Nala ( I have 2 pugs thanks to watching Nala) seeing Zoe and Alfie has been really lovely. I know nothing in life is perfect but at the end of the vlog before the umms lol I thought that's a pretty perfect picture of two great people. Xx
IM CRYLAUGHING AT THE ''UMM'' 😂
I loved the  Ummm  Edit at the end 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The end!!!😂😂😂 love it ❤
THE UMS ICONIC
I can't burp either and do the turtle burps too! 🐢
hahahah love you guys so much <33
We need a “Um”compilation at the end of each Vlog now 😂
Um…………
I mean the way Ottie turned the vlog camera on and pressed record we could have a little vlogger on our hands 😂💗
Lovely 😍 when I was a kid I also set fire to our antique dresser the same way. A candle with decorative foliage at the base of the holder. No fire alarms! I just saw flames reach up and lick the ceiling. I threw water on it and made it worse! But somehow I managed to dampen it with tea towels. Yup I never light candles with foliage at the base any more either!
I'm a fellow emetophobe and I can't burp either! I've just assumed it's because of the phobia 😅
What straighteners do you use to curl your hair?
I do the turtle burps too!!! I hiccup a lot and then that weird throat thing but I don’t burp. I’d rather than bruh tbh 🤣
Zoe I could not relate more to what you said about the anxiety and overthinking with being a mum. I’m a mum of two and get exactly like that. X
Alfie Deyes 🤣 I laughed my ass off with the montage of Zoe's 'ums'
You placed your… WHAT??  I have to know! This story was so cute 😢
I laughed so hard at all of Zoe’s “um”s. Thanks, Alfie!
The um’s 😂😂😂
I can’t burp either Zoe and I feel so seen rn hahahah
use Pipe cleaners or cable ties on the tree dec's.x
Really enjoying zlogmas December feels complete love Alfie’s editing xxx
The um's at the end literally had my crying laughing!!!🤣🤣🤣 You guys are the best. Seriously.
Um...  here till the very  hum  end ahahaha btw I LOVE their humor, guys I love you more and more over the years, you're my fav youtube family <3
I can't burp either and I just do turtle burps too!!! (Except in my family we call them frog burps!). 🐸
I really enjoy watching both your videos separately, but doing vlogmas with both of you in it is amazing. Really amazing.
OOOh Alfiee:')
Please try the curly Girl method!! Bring out your natural curl 🥰🥹👩‍🦱
stop the UM compilation at the end 😭💌😂
I just burst into tears at the very end🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Uuum?
Look up Handball - its a big sport in the world! You throw the ball with you're hands and jump! I think Ottie would love that and be great at it!
Them: „She loves to throw balls and she loves music”. Me: “obviously she’s gonna be Troy from high school musical” 🤭🕺🏼
We have big flickering battery operated candles to put in between our Christmas foliage.. works a treat and is fire free :). Also, I'm loving vlogmas!
Ahahhahah  1. How Alfie was fully concentrated on doing his puzzle whilst Zoe was answering the question 2. That “choose the best “umm” at the end
Ottie looks so Pretty in her  Party  Dress 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Love the umms at the end xD omg alfie
Alfie did not have to do her like that at the end omg hahah I'm dying they do love having a laugh at one another lol can't wait to see what Zoe thinks tomorrow 😆
Recharge days are so important! And I think that's one reason the standard nuclear family is so detrimental for everyone... You're already very lucky that you guys got Poppy and Sean and Amanda and Nick so close by and Zoe's mum seems to come around from time to time and I think that support is super important both for you as parents and also for Ottie! 💕 "It takes a village" really isn't an empty saying 🥰
hahahaha the end of this vlog is everything 😂
THANK YOU SO MICH ALFIE YOUR THE BEST FOR DOING THIS
OMG cry laughed at the umm's and then my husband was like you know you do that with uhhh and know I'm not laughing so much :'D
storytime was so so lovely! thank you for the vlogmas guys, you save the day everyday.
The "erms" at the end genuinely made me nearly spit out my brew 🤣 I was not expecting that bloopers part. Totally here for it haha!! Absolutely gorgeous vlogs and getting me through my 12 week of pregnancy 😊 it's been a rough fee weeks!!!
I’m absolutely cry laughing at the ‘um’ compilation at the end of the video 😂
THE ENDING 🤣🤣🤣
Hi Zoe, my hair sounds like it’s pretty similar to yours…keeping going back to fix the style and humidity ruins easily. I’ve found elvive dream lengths wonder water has helped smooth mine out better ❤
I could happily spend hours listening to Zoe talk about anything!! she should so do a podcast!!
Don't worry about not being able to burp Zoe. I burp enough for the both of us...and about ten other people 🙊
I throat burp too haha, it’s a weird feeling sometimes 🤣
the UM edit at the end brilliant!
Zoe the “um” was like a song at the end. Someone add some beats hahahaha 😂 bravo Alfie!! Made my night😂😂😂 love you both. Been here since Jim leaked your pic 😅 and I now have a 20 mos old myself. I love growing up with both you🎉🎉🎉🎉 (hello from Chicago 🇺🇸)
That’s a Christmas number no1 😂
OK, this video makes you human more than ever and I LOVE IT! Your meeting story, the fire episode and ehm section...thank you for that! 🙏🙏💛
Oh the ending 😂😂😂😂
The “um” compilation at the end 👏🏻😂
How nice was this vlog😍😍😍😍 loved the end thanks Alfie😂😂
When the ums started I was trying to listen out for what song you had made with them 🤣🤣🤣
excited for the extensions and brazilian blowout! ginger or a rich brown would look fantastic on you especially with your blue eyes! <3
Thumbs up if you wanna find out what Zoe was saying at 40:06 😄 I fully respect their right to privacy but it sounds super adorable!! 😍
Love all the “UM”s at the end😂
OMG I CANT BURP EITHER I THOUGHT I WAS WEIRD it’s so cool knowing that I’ve been watching your videos for 10 years and i never knew you couldn’t burp either LOL i feel more connected
I love that your both doing vlogmas as a team ❤❤
I have the exact same experience with burping. Burping often feels and sounds like throwing up and as I’ve also got emetophobia I suspect it’s a natural reflex not to burp.
I knew it! I knew you’re gonna do something like this 😂 I thought it would be at day 24 just to have time to gain zoe’s editing trust but man 😂😂😂 this made me laugh so much! Nice one alfie 😂
I am so desperate to se Zoe with fizzy hair 🥺 I think it will be so great fo Zoe to be a bit curly
zoe definitely has grown so much anxiety wise. i remember when she had a book signing for her first girl online book (the blue one!) and alfie had to carry her out because she just broke down. now she’s smashing it. she should be so proud of herself. she’s worked so hard and she’s come SOOOO far
Just a word of advice on the Brazilian blow dry I had one last year and it changed the texture of my hair long term completely! My hair used to be able to hold curls all day now I’m lucky if I get them to last an hour if that x
no please do ur natural hair one time!
I have missed your vlogmas so much, loving these videos and loving the editing 😂 I think you could make a Christmas carol out of your umm’s xx
Alfie your editing is brilliant 🤣👌🏼
I have the same hair issues as you.  The older I get,  my hair is getting frizzier and curlier. Short hair is no longer an option for me.  I need the length  to help weigh it down a bit.  Or I too,  will have the Wendoline look.
This vlogmass so far has been so lovely to enjoy. These videos are my down time and chance to relax, smile and laugh along with you both. The team effort with the editing is brilliant. Thank you to you both x
Oh my gosh I have the same thing with not burping 😳😳😳 glad I‘m not the only one
Okay, but now we wanna know about your first kiss!!!!
omg the end!!!!!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭
Oh my gosh!! The uhms in the end had me LMAO!! its golden!
Alfie 🤣the very end! 😂 "um" oh, we love you Zoe!
The bloopers 😂
Nothing better than the umms. I can almost tell when you edit them out I was just waiting for you to put in something like this at the end amd it was totally worth every umm. Had me in fits of laughter
Have you ever heard of the term Highly Sensitive Person? When you are talking about your anxiety and trying to describe it, it reminded me of being highly sensitive. Look it up, but basically you are extra sensitive to things around you like energy. Over thinking, having your energy zapped, getting overwhelmed by small amounts of social situations. Every highly sensitive person reacts differently to things and I think that depends on how we cope with things. It just totally reminded me of it! Anyway, I am loving vlogmas, loving Alfie's editing, it's fun to see you guys interact in that way! Thanks for the wonderful Christmas vibes!
Alfie did you dirty at the end Zoe 😂
I also can’t burp!! I heard your turtle burp (I call them the gurgles lol) and was shook . There’s a big subreddit called /noburp and I’ve learned so much and felt so validated.
Zoe taking Alfies compliment and turning it into “Waffle a lot of shite” is iconic. 😂
HAHAHHAAH I love this. The ums at the end made me laugh 😂😂😂😂
OMG THE UMS 🤣💀 also, Zoe i turtle burp!! I've probably real burped twice in my life and felt like I was gonna throw up 🐢
It’s seriously so crazy that I’ve been watching you both since I was 15 and now I’m 27 with two kids watching you both also be parents, this is the COOL part of social media.. you have been such a big part of my life and I’m so glad you are still making videos!! Love you guys so much!
Oh my god I can’t burp either and my throat makes those exact noises all the time!! People never believe me that I can’t burp but I literally wouldn’t even know where to start
The "UM's" Alfie did you so dirty!🤣
Oh God, i can't burp for my life 😂🥰 Ottie is getting so big she is adorable that taste test was great 🤪☺️
Loving these vlogsssss!!!
Uhhm mm uhhhmmm Alfie you are the best for that last bitttt!!! 😅
Love the ending of all the umms zoe says so funny 🤣🤣
We wanna see your curly haaaaaaairrrrrr
That conversation about the two of you coming together is going to be a treasure to Ottie some day.
❤
Last year my Christmas didn't feel Christmassy without Zoe. I'm so happy she's back 💓
i genuinely love you guys so much 💛
My mom went through chemo treatment when I was young and when her hair grew back it came back ultra curly. Before that her hair was straight. Regrowth can be weird!
LMFAO UMM
Umm
The end got me 😂😂😂😂
love the "um's" at the end !!
To see the tweets they might be viewable using the Wayback Machine!
Alfie! Why did you do Zoe dirty like that 😂 #Ummmm
ummm - Zoe 2022 🤣
Thank you for sharing the bit about anxiety postpartum. I feel the same way and it’s nice to know I’m not alone 🫶🏼
the way your faces just glow talking about Ottie... so cute
Omg the "uhhms" in the end had me actually laugh crying 😆
All the ummms at the end were hilarious 🤣  Crazy I’ve watched for over 10 years!!!
I was thinking yesterday that it would be hilarious to get an "um" counter but this ending was gold! I absolutely know if I was on camera I would be just as bad if not worse 😂
Ummmm.   This was fantastic! I feel so honored that you both have shared so much of your lives.   I lost my father in the spring.. So, the holiday season has been hard to get inspired and involved. But seeing Zalfie has just shifted me.  Thank you both...  I cried, laughing with the "ummm"
The last clip tho😂😂 loved watching ye take a trip down memory lane!
The ums!! 🤣🤣🤣 What a lovely video guys. Thank you🥹💕
Make sure to get one that is for electrical and greace fires. Because some of them don't have that.
haha the ums at the end
This is so funny, the “um” part at the end made me cry laugh 😂😂😂 Alfie should do the editing from now on, not only for vlogmas
I wish you guys had a podcast! It would be so fun to here you guys chit chat like this all the time!!
Omg I can’t burp either. Never have I love that you call it turtle burping I call it croaking (like a frog). I had also seen a video on TikTok and it made me feel seen. My family and friends always pick on me for it (in the nicest way they can), but hearing that other people can’t burp helped make me feel more normal 😂
I was just about toe comment about how COZY and wonderful that chat was, as the video was coming to an end…that ending threw me😂😂😂! Umm um um, we’ll that’s all I’ve got to say! Xx
i’m freaking out right now!!! i’m not the only one!!!!  I can’t burp either and I make the same noises you made, I call them my grunts hahaha I’m so glad I could relate with this 😂❤️
Loved the very very end.  Alfie is loving this editing job a little too much.
Time to try the Curly Girl Routine! You have curly hair and it needs the right products and NO HEAT!
I am so happy that you are doing VLOGMAS this year I look forward to it every day!!!
This is the only YouTube channel I've consistently watched since 2014, you and Alfie will always be my comfort content it fills me with so much nostalgia and watching you both navigate parenthood is just so lovely to see ❤️
Oh my god I also can't burp and do turtle burps!! I must've picked up the phrase turtle burp from these videos because I call them that too hahaha
how tf have you not aged a damn day!!! lmao
The fact that Alfie could have made the "uhm"s to the sound of Christmas carol & didn't is a missed opportunity! Love y'all! Happy Vlogmas 😂❤
😂
"um"
I can’t imagine you two to ever argue😆
i love love love the love story!
Me cracking up! Love you guys!
The umms are in different tones as well. Imagine making an edit where they sound like a Christmas song
Oh my gosh! That ending of “ums” made me laugh! I’m loving Alfie editing these vlogs!
The umms tho 🤣🤣🤣 thanks Alfie
the ums killed me pls do it everyday
maybe a curly hair journey is in store :)
Lmao! Alfie, really the ending 😂
Using phrases like “Um” and “like” in sentences is actually something that people, especially women, will sometimes use in speech as an indicator that they’re still talking so people don’t interrupt them. When you’re so frequently interrupted by others it’s a way to hold space and indicate that you’re not done talking. Ideally we’ll get to a point where that’s not necessary and space will be held for everyone when they’re speaking no matter what. Something interesting I thought I’d share since it was pointed out in the video and I do it as well:)
i have been watching you guys for at least 10 years now (i actually went back and checked lol) & it is such an honor to see you all grow as people & now as parents! Ottie is gorgeous & adorable & at such a great age! can’t wait to see her in all her festive fun this vlogmas! <<<3 happy holidays!
Zoe’s vlogmas always puts me in such a great mood!!!! The ending was hilarious
Umm Lol Alfie got you good! See you tomorrow! 🎄
Um um um hahaha that was hilarious!! I bet i am just like Zoe hahaha or I better say um um um
The Effort to put in the Umm compilation tho 😂
The next set of ins needs to be to jingle bells
Hahahah the “um” at the end! Someone please edit this into a song
Omg so scary! 🔥
Please tell me Zoe saw the "umms" 😂👌
the guilt as a mom trying to do nothing is SO REAL.
This vlogmas feels like prime vlogmas times and I’m here for it 🎄🎅🏻
The “um” compilation is top tier
I also can't burp! I know exactly the throat bubble you're talking about. Been this way my whole life, glad there's more of us out there haha
You both are the sweetest  couple!
I already commented but, my father in law can’t burp either!
I love that we have vlogmas ❤I also love that final edit 😅
I don’t burp either! My friends call the air popping/turtle burping my “throat noises” 💀
I can totally  understand Zoe Sugg,I have anxiety too and Some people can’t understand why this “reset” time is so crucial por people with anxiety. It’s not that we are lazy !!
The hums at the end 😂😂😂😂
Ottie’s face when she tasted the Twiglet was HILARIOUS! 😂😂😂 “yeah… no mum, that’s not for me”
Um um um um um 😂😂… ALFIE you’re savage 🤣
Alfie really did her dirty with the ummm collage 😂 also what are the odds that my hair caught on fire from a candle right before the story you shared about the mantle!
Can someone count how many times she said um in the last clip 😹😹
After baby #2, my previously wavy hair went super curly, but stayed with a straighter layer on top! It has been such a pain to style ever since! Embracing layers and the curly girl method has made my life a whole lot easier. It only took me 15 years to get the hang of how to manage it...
The end was the cherry on top!! Alfie’s editing is too good 😂😂😂
It truly brought me back to 2013 when Alfie and Zoe started talking about the beginning of their relationship🥲 the way Alfie got all red and embarrassed at the end of Zoe explaining their night reminds me so much of the whipped cream challenge Idk why🤣 great video!
the um's at the end 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 sounds like the mission impossible song
I've done the same thing, had a shelf in my bedroom I kept fake flowers and candles on. For my birthday my dad got me a candle that sat in a glass candle holder and had pottery around it. Lit the candle for got about it and in about an hour I was in the living room. My brother ran downstairs shouting fire! Fire! Thank heavens for his fast acting or our whole house would have burnt down. Ended up that my room was just full of smoke I had to sleep in the guest bedroom that night but no other major damage.
I have very similar hair to you and I’ve been getting keratin treatments which is what you were talking about with the Brazilian treatment. ITS LIFE CHANGING!!
ALFIE!!! Don’t make a fun of her!!!!
Lmaaooooooo ALFIE THAT ENDING!!!! I’m cry laughing I wasn’t ready lmaooooo
UHMMMM 🤣🤣🤣
NOT THE UMS AT THE END 😂😂😂😂
I think i've watched the umm compilation 100 times! feeling very grateful that you guys are working together to bring us vlogmas!!
Alfie please make an um compilation where Zoe is singing a Christmas carol.
When you said Brazillian blowdry i was thinking like brazillian waxing, so like a pubic blow dry hahaha 😂🫣
omg me! I can't burp either, just make little croaky noises - its so funny! 😅
No matter how much time passes, and how many new channels and creators I start to love and follow, yours has been and will always be my favourite, my safe place on the internet. It feels nostalgic, and at the same time so much has changed for you and also for me in my life. I grew up watching you (and Alfie) and watching you gives me a comfort that I can't explain, it's like being 14 again for a few minutes in this beautiful craziness that life is as an adult(I'm now 24 btw hahaha).  Thanks for being here and sharing everything with us for so long. Lots of love from Brazil.
Lmfao UM
I for sure was looking at the clock hahahah
Thank you for your honesty and talking about recharge days and being an overthinker and feeling guilty. I'm going through this. And it was so nice to hear that.
Uhm
Regarding your hair type changing, I’d suggest updating your Function of Beauty hair goals and adding curl definition. My hair started going through changes a couple years ago, and in the last year, I added curl definition. It’s made my hair care routine so effortless, with more “good hair days” than ever before. If I remember correctly, you’re a Function of Beauty ambassador and I think you’d like it!
The og know about the start of zalfieeeee and how we shipped u harddddd
someone please make an autotune song of the ums
Zoe, I wanted to thank you for mentioning recharge days. I have generalized anxiety disorder and last night I was feeling very overwhelmed with everything and I just had to take a day for myself. I called out of work and I got things done that I needed to get done. I'm grateful because I'm glad I got things done, but at the same time I always feel so guilty for calling out of work and I overthink that I'm going to be yelled at, fired, etc etc. I know this is not the case but even still I know I needed that day today. Thank you for speaking about this and your anxiety in general it really means a lot and helps me, and I'm sure others, a lot. 🤍
Alfie was wrong for that last clip why you do her like that 🤣🤣🤣
lol the last bit love you guys thanks for the lovely Q&A
Dead at the ending. Couldn't love them more.
Literally died at the end with the “um” compilation 😂😂
I can’t believe Alfie came for her neck like that! I’m deceased hahaha 🤣
I would love to see you try the curly girl method!!
Alfie saying Zoe is a good talker then makes an edit of her Umms is hilarious
Sweet! Vlogmas has been lovely! The “ums” at the end 😂.
Zoe! I'm the exact same with never being able to burp, and I also have weird 'turtle burps'! So strange but I am also totally okay with not being able too! no botox in the neck for me hahaha
I was wondering if the "ums" were going to be mentioned in things Alfie's learned about Zoe, but the ending was even better.   Also, loving the collaboration on Vlogmas this year! I am feeling especially grateful and nostalgic. I think I've watched your Vlogmas since 2013 and I look forward to whatever holiday videos you put out every year.
Ummm 🤣 amazing. Definitely put a smile on my face
This is the most smiley and happy I’ve gotten from a vlog in a while zoe😭all you guys did was talk but seeing you two interact and converse with one another apart from j little chatty bits and pieces in any normal vlog was soooo adorable and happy and the bloopers at the end had me in a fit 😂
I can’t burp either. I’ve definitely googled it before to make sure I’m not the only one. Whatever is happening for me though, comes out kinda like a hiccup🙃
I LOVE THE “UM” EDITS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 love to see more alfie’s notes and pov of editing vlogmass!!
Alfred you did not with the uhms lmao!! Priceless
Really enjoying Alfie’s touch 😂
loving the vlogmas and the compilation at the end *chefs kiss*
The “um” compilation was a masterpiece.😂
YES!!! I remember chatting to people on MSN on a desktop computer until we 'heard the birds outside' and then going to bed and sleeping until 2pm 👌 💖 I can't imagine doing that now. 😂
Would love to know what creative games you please with Ottie? I struggle for ideas 😅
I literally showed my boyfriend a clip of you from the previous vlog to say “hey.. I love her hair and this length. Probably going to go with this look for my next chop!” I love your hair Zoe!
Alfie, Thankyou for the Um compilations! This vlogmas makes me feel like it’s 2013 all over again. I cannot believe I’ve been watching you guys for 10 years now 💜 sending lots of love and well wishes for the festive season xxx
Editing Alfie trolling his future wife at the end. Um, haha
Um😂
I loved this q&a so so much it felt nostalgic 🥺
Oh my god Alfie you cracked me up on the end 🤣🤣🤣
Staying until the end 😆🤣
the um bloopers at the end were so funny
So strange I live in America and everyone has mini fire extinguishers in our kitchens, it’s like a given. You guys are SO lucky! Great video
I LOOOOVVVED this video. So sweet and then the UMS. I laughed so hard.
Alfieeee 😂. The um compilation at the end was so unexpected and funny
Can we give Alfie and award for the “um” compilation
Lol. Thank you to Alfie for making Vlogmas happen for this year. All the umms... 😆 I don't even notice them in normal conversation but we all use a lot more words whiskers than we think we do, huh?
Love the ending 😂
That ummmm at the end just got me 😂
finals week at my university has me SO stressed out and watching your videos every night before bed has been such a de-stresser :)) so so so excited that vlogmas is back 💞💞
I’m a fellow turtle burper and i would haTE to burp properly it would freak me out
23:38 “Your child is your priority” but in order to give your child the best, you have to be at your best. Also still make yourself a priority too ❤
The ums were hilarious! The food table was presented so beautyifully, too.
YES! My hair has completely changed after having my daughter! It has become a lot more frizzy! So crazy how that happens!! Love your cozy vlogs. My faves :)
Currently in the all my hair has/is falling out stage (4 months pp). Had also not anticipated it growing back differently 😅 finally going to get myself to the hairdresser next weekend because Something has to be done 🙃
Ummmmm that was the best! :)
19:25 not me and Zoe having the same tiktok fyp😂
I need the um’s edit to be available on Spotify please😂😂😂  you both are the best❤❤
That's the best outro to a video I've ever seen 😂👏🏼 loved this vlog
The word um sounds so weird now lol
Zoe, over years you had your hair trained to do what you wanted it to do..the new hair may just need time to be trained to do as you'd like it to drive! I've always heard that you can train your hair to a certain extent..there's also the other side of the coin, and it may never be the same again because of the hormonal shift that your body went through..it's all worth because of beautiful baby girl love! I love you all! Wishing you the most wonderful Christmas season! 🥰🙏
Zoe was really trying to meet her essay word count 😂
THE end of the video HAHAHAHAAHAHAH😅
best 34 seconds ever.
Zoe's ums are hilarious 😂
The end 😂
I absolutely love the little Alfie edit Easter eggs lmaooo
This Vlogmas is gonna be the best one yet I reckon, it’s being created with soooooo much love and it radiates!!! 🥰🥰
Omg I don’t think I know how you met?
10:31 she’s so funny😂🥰
That ending was the best!!! Love watching these vlogs, love you guys!
46 minutes??!! Corrr🤝🏼🥳😍 After they’d said, we won’t film too much as it’s a busy day😂
loved the walk down memory lane.
Absolutely loving the vlogmas!! Going through exam season at uni and I look forward to your vlogmas videos on my study breaks😅 but I’m waiting on Ferris showing up in a video!! 🫶🏼🫶🏼
i will say, i'm quite chuffed that zoe is ending her own vlogmas videos, i mean it still early in the month but it wouldn't be a proper vlogmas if zoe didn't fall asleep and alfie has to end the vlog for her / wake her up to say goodnight to the vlog!! 😅
It’s the “Uhm” with prayer hands for me 🙏 😆
I can't burp either!! I do these weird "throat gurgles" instead. I remember once I had to get a barium swallow test done and the technician said "please try your best not to burp until after the test is over." And I thought omg is this finally going to make me burp? Nope! And then the technicians were SO impressed with me being able to hold it together 😏
The ending😂😂😂😂
Zoe is indeed great at talking!
YES I CANNOT BURP SOS 😢
Ottie is just sooooo adorable omg❤❤❤❤
Loving vlogmas this year, with little ottie, such a lovely little family. X
Really enjoyed you two chatting. Lovely
Otties face when she ate the twiglet was adorable
I was in a house fire in London where I was living. It was in the middle of the night and sadly one of our neighbours in the building didn’t make it out. It was so awful and terrifying. I’ll never underestimate smoke alarms (unfortunately, our building didn’t have any but now I make sure they are everywhere 😅). We lost absolutely everything, only had the pyjamas we were wearing when we ran out of the building but we were one of the lucky ones to get out in time, so we felt like we had one the life lottery. You guys were so very lucky and a very good point you made was getting a fire extinguisher. You never know when you might need one and fires get out of control so quickly. I’m glad everyone was ok. 💜
The um bloopers at the end was hilarious, please keep doing that Alfie!
that last part 😭😭 i need to know what happened that was so cute stop
The end was hilarious 😅❤️
I think someone needs to make a compilation video of Zoe saying “um”. Hilarious! 😂😂
i can't burp either!! and whenever i tell someone they don't believe me, but we are out here, we exist!
The ‘um’ compilation was something I didn’t know I needed 😂🫶🏼
a trip to that Woodland retreat ? You’ve been to a couple of times that would be fun.
I really appreciate the editing, Alfie! 😂
Alfie Deyes, what an ABSOLUTE LEGEND for the clip at the end 😂😂
I can't burp either and my throat does the exact same thing.
LOLing so much at the end of the vlog xD
That ending! 🤣
the um edit at the end hahahaha XD
I cannot with the end of this vlog. 🤣🤣🤣 Alfie editing in all the 'ums' at once- what a legend! 😂  Some of them sounded like 🎵Dashing through the snow, in a one horse open sleigh...🎵
I CAN'T BURP EITHER!!! its actually a serious thing 🤣 Loads of people have it and its not spoken about but if it is your called strange 😂 feel your pain with the random outbursts of turtle burps🤪
It is crazy to think I've been watching your channels for over 10 years, back when challenges and collaborations were so popular. Here you are now with a little one-year-old. Your videos will always be so nostalgic, especially vlogmas!!
Can somebody please count how many “ums” there were? 😂😂😂😂
The Umm compilation is everything 😂❤
I really appreciate you talking about how you have to take “recharging days”. I have anxiety as well and I have to do the same, and I’ve found it’s hard to explain to people who don’t because I think it can come off as laziness when really it’s what helps me function on all other days. I’m sorry you don’t really get those days as a parent but I hope you’ve found other ways to recharge 😊
HAHHAHA Alfie editing these videos has been the best thing ever. Also I love you guys and ur family ❤❤
Um 😂
Once again, thanks for another um, great video! I’m an “um-er” as well, Zoe! Also, just fyi, we have a fire extinguisher in our kitchen, in a cupboard near the stove, in the garage, and near our fireplace. I’m SO happy to hear that there was no damage to anyone or anything! I really enjoyed this Q&A! Take Care!
The end was just the best I love Alfie’s add ins on the edit
lol the endcut um lol
46 minutes!!! WOOHOOOO
Alfie just crushing the puzzle while Zoe pours her heart out 😂
Ummm
THE POST CREDIT 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
um
Ums  at the end was a nice treat lol
Zoe’s Vlogmas is exactly what i need to feel xmassy🥰
Um um um ummmmmm um um 😂
Ummmmmm
I looovee it everytime Alfie calls Zoe “Gorgeous”. ❤
I had seen Alfie’s story on instagram saying he did something special at the end of the video before I watched the actual video so while watching the q&a part about their relationship I was already a little emotional thinking I would see the tweet they were talking about and some old videos of them with some emotional music, I just saw it coming with my eyes of imagination, ready to tear up and then the “um” part came…I have never recovered so quickly from being emotional before 😅 It’s like wanting to sneeze so badly and when you’re ready to sneeze, it just goes away like that.  However, I love the “um” part. ❤
The  “um”  at the end so funny love it ❤
Get the flickering flameless candles  from Pottery Barn or from a UK store....Hum :))
Firstly, I'm loving this Vlogmas, I'm simultaneously watching 2020's too because I was really ill back then so didn't watch any.  Secondly, The Um edit at the end, we need to keep this going 😂😂 Finally, I LOVE vlogs with the both of you in. You can really see that one of Alfie's love languages is touch. It's nice to see a couple still going strong all these years later.
I thought it was so weird I couldn’t burp! So glad I’m not the only one 😂
I don’t comment much, I’m a bit of a silent watcher but wanted to say I’m loving vlogmas this year and really enjoying Alfie edit too!! :)
The "um" compilation was epic hahaha do it every video hahaha
Ohhhh PLEASE grant us with more cute Alzoe storeis!! Soo heart warming maan☺️♥️♥️
Um best ending ever.  Now set it to Christmas Music♥
I'm cracking up at the "ums" at the end!
me me me im a turtle burp-er
This is one of my favorite vlogs to watch in a while! It was so cute getting to hear your origin story because it was so fun watching you two relive it!
Actually cry laughing at the ummm bloopers. 🤣
the sweetest thing is that when you talk about chatting and meeting for the first time, you can tell how much you two adore each other still 10 years later.
The ending 😂
The last bit totally reminded me of robin shebebhdhdbd from himym lol 😂
Zoe’s um montage caught me so off guard
Yes!! I also can’t burp, there are more of us out there haha!
It was like an um song
The end was the absolute best part Hahahhaha go on alfie! Editor of the year!
Um
I have never burped either I get the same air things that bubble in my throat and I have a phobia of sick so I would not like to burp
Nice one for the “um” bloopers Alfie 😂😂
The “um’s” at the end killed me off😂 could’ve been mistaken for Boy George meditating in the jungle but also sounded like the theme tune from a game show lmao
Im FINE thanks🤣🤣Thanks for answering my question guys, glad the two of you are powering through it 🥰 Really enjoying the vlogs gives me a lot of nostalgia 😁
Ohhh no hahahha how could Alfie do that to you🙈😅
I CANT BURP EITHER AND DO THE TURTLE BURPS. OMG. i feel so validated!!!
loving all the videos so far! thank you Zoe ( and Alfie for editing) !!! hugs from a mexican friend!
Watching/listening to you talk about the fire, reminded me of the time a candle exploded at your old house on the window sill in your kitchen,  I was waiting for you to say something about that time. Frightening times. Yep, I have been watching your videos and vlogs for a long time 🙂loved all the edited out um's at the end Alfie 😀 xxx
Priority vlogmas
Hahaha, all the "um's" at the end 😂
Um, um, ummm, um , um 😂😂😂😂😂
We could make a song out of those "um"s... anybody here clever with garage band?? :")
I started watching Zoe and Alfie when I was 12 years old! And now I’m 23, I can’t express how much you both have been role models to me. Couple wise, personally wise, just all the content you guys have put out, genuinely is good for all, the soul, mind, and just overall happiness, and I still look forward to watch your videos right when they come out. You guys just get it, care and have built this great community where I know I am with people who care to. So thank you so much. You guys even at 23 set goals for me and advice and give me things to aspire to that I want to do in my own life. Merry Christmas! I appreciate your content all the time but especially this season for volgmas, it’s so special ❤️
you describing the story of how you first met and became closer was the sweetest thing ever. these videos never fail to make me feel warm and fuzzy. hope you guys are having a lovely december <33
I love the fact that Alfie is editing, I’m so into it😂❤
i’m obsessed with the fact that you also can’t burp!!! I’ve never been able to burp even as a baby and it’s so funny to hear you say that you have the same thing as a person who i’ve watched and looked up to for so long. Throat burp gang🙋🏼‍♀️ (although i will say i will never get botox in my neck because i also saw that tiktok and it looked absolutely awful hahaha) x
I just want to say how lovely it is to see such a beautiful display of a healthy family life. Being someone in their mid 20s who has watched you both since my teens this is so special to see! You guys give me hope and perspective for the future; what it looks like when you put in work to achieve your goals and the beautiful blessings that fall into place because of doing so. Keep it up adore you both!!
I’m cry laughing… um 🤣😄😄
Um like a Christmas song 😂
Really appreciate that alfi is helping zoe out this year so we all can enjoy vlogmas. It really makes my day to watch your Videos and especially vlogmas. Watching both of you since 2012/13 🍀🙏🏻
Ummmmmm……
The ums at the end was so funny a little payback for Zoe putting him on blast about the little hand thing that he did that first night they hung out together 😂also wouldn’t mind a q+a once a week for vlogmas if it would be easier! Thanks again for editing alf
crying at the um bit at the end. gonna take a shot every-time zoe says it
Minute 15:55-16:15 lmfao I love this. So cute.
love bloopers at the end jajajaj love love
Alfies editing is unreal😂😂😂😂
Not the "um" compilation 😂
omg I can’t burp either we call the noises I make frog noises 😭😭😭
I also can’t burp! For a long time I thought I was the only one until I saw that Botox tiktok. I always use it as my fun fact about myself for icebreakers 😂
Alfie must’ve been salty he had to edit all of the long rants in this video when he created that “Um” montage 😂😂😂😂 i died laughing
Buy real flame candles you can get dinner candles along with others - much safer especially this time of year around foliage etc ❤
It’s been so nice winding down these days with vlogmas and the joint effort seems to be fun for both of you 😂 thanks for all the joy you bring
Couple goals, such a lovely couple 💕
Can I just say I love you guys so much to see u guys go from relationship to a family is crazy
Alfie and the UMM edit 😂😂😂😂😂
OHMYGOD VLOGMAS
Omg i proper laughed at the ending of the video 🤣🤣🤣 LOVING your joint vlogmas 🤍🤍🤍
I could watch you both chat away all night until the birds start chirping tbh. These vlogs are just making my December. I love you both so much ❤❤
please do this at the end in every video 🤣
That Ending!!!! 😂😂😂😂
It’s official, Alfie must edit all of Zoe’s videos from now on! That sneaky little blooper blip at the end was too funny! 😂❤
I had the absolute worst day at work today. And this video was like my version of that recharge Zoe talked about. Clean house, kids asleep, vlogmas on. Perfect.
Hilarious omg 😆
Lol the ums at the end were spectacular
The last bit 😂👌🏻
Hahahahahaha the end
Ummmm ❤😅😅
The end 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The ending is hilarious… 🤭😂😂
Yess, I can't burp either Zoe, it's a condition called RCPD! It's so annoying just making random noises in public infront of people who don't know what it is loll
I feel like Zoe’s ums could be edited as a Christmas song like jingle bells😂😂
been loving vlogmas! The vlogs feel more personal idk cant explain it but really like their style :)
haha love the um montage at the end!
The last 30 seconds😂
The ums at the end made me laugh out loud!  Loving the videos so much ❤
The end I’m deaaaad 😂 I m living for Alfie editing the vlogs. Feel like we get to see zoe under a whole new light. Always liked her but she’s just so funny without even trying to!
uhmm is me everytime im telling a story to someone
these bring me so much joy - and the end bit had me in fits of laughter!!
Glad you and your family are ok! Fires are scary! It’s good to have a fire extinguisher on each floor so that it’s easy to grab in an emergency. Never know when a candle might tip over or electrical malfunctions.
Lol the Umms at the end!
Zoe!!! You get the gurgles too!!! It’s called RCPD! Fellow RCPD gal here & I want the Botox too!!
I am so so so happy that zoe is doing vlogmas!! Love you guys
Does anyone know which hair iron this is at the start ?
What hair tool is she using?
For a second the rhythm of the ums sounded like the start of the Eastenders theme tune 🤣thank you for doing volumes this year it's just lush
Love you two..three ❤
I am so happy I found your channel you both are so genuine
Ummm
The Ums outtake just made this the best video of Zoe Vlogmas history. More please!! 😂❤
The "ums" at the end 🤣🤣🤣
Great video 😊 what a lovely spread the Food looked amazing 😻 .   OMG thats was scary😮 shaun with his bare hands trying to get the flames out 🫣 . Thank you for your video. Just lovely to see you both  have a Good night ❤. 🤣🤣🤣hum  poor Zoe
These videos really give me a sense of festive familiar nostalgia 😊
was so excited to hear you were doing vlogmas this year, really giving me something to look forward to coming home from college every evening as i've been finding it so hard!! so cosyyy <3
LOVE THE UM
You guys need a podcast
the 'um' montage 😂😂😂
The um compilation…priceless 🤣🤣
Omg the UM compilation at the end hahahahahha
if you didn't know Alfie was editing these videos already that last clip made it obvious! proper made me laugh! great vlog as always!
Here for the ums 😂
Dying on the last part with Zoe’s um 😂. I’m loving your vlogmas so far.
rem
Just Alfie editing your Vlogs makes it extra special Vlogmas this year. And it´s so cool to see that there is still something new and exciting happening especially in more than ten years of youtube. And the umm´s is just such a throwback to old school how i met your mother
Omg Alfie. The clips of Zoë's "umm" at the end made me laugh so much. Thanks for that 😂😂  Sooo bloody happy you are doing vlogmas, I cannot even tell you 💕
The last clip cracks me up ily guys 🤣🤍
Not being able to burp is definitely a thing!! I'm one of them too, I related so much with everything you said 😂❤️
It’s been so hard for me to get into the Christmas spirit this year after losing my brother in July but honestly these Vlogmas videos are helping me so much! Thank you❤️
looking at the vlogmas intro...REAL cinema is BACK!
They need to do an "um" counter
love hearing you guys recount how you met, so nostalgic and sweet! &  loving the "um" compilation !!!!! 😂
Too funny Alfie 😂😂
Omg - those UMs 😂❤
I'm going to say it again thank you Alfie for editing the videos and thank you for making me laugh at the end, love you both ❤️
Lmaooo Alfie is so shady and hilarious for the ending 😂😂
I can't burp either haha
ERM ERM ERM ERM ERM erm erm ERm ERm ErM ErM ERM eRM erM
The ending cracked me up AHAHA, so relatable though I cut out so many 'ehm's from videos and voiceovers 🥲
Not the “um” montage at the end 😂
The uhm compilation was chef's kiss!  Also, the Q&A was nice. Wish you guys would do the old school tags in an updated version with newer questions.
I am really hoping in the next vlog we see the reaction to Zoe watching the "um" part 🤣🤣🤣
Zoe you totally have ADHD lol all of those things you describe about your brain match up!
Zoe please make ur hair parting straight 😅 20:42
If y’all ever did decide to have a wedding I can’t even imagine how incredible it would be!!
Belly laughing at the very end ummmmm 😂😂 loving the vlogmas ❤❤❤
I can’t burp either! Hahaha. I make weird like stomach gurgles noises but in my throat, always happens at the worst of times as well
Alfie yet again a savage again with the ending 😂😂😂😂
Have you ever heard of a “highly sensitive person”? There’s a great book by Elaine Aron which explains the behaviours you were describing – give it a read, it might just change your life!
19:20 I also have silent burps haha
Turtle burps! I have the same but I call them crocodile burps.
zoe talking about how she doesn’t like now she can’t recharge made me feel so comforted somehow, it’s so refreshing to hear people honestly answer that question but also I’ve been feeling the same recently (not that i’m a mum) about not having as much time to relax
to Alfie; UHM, but make it a christmas tune 😅!  Enjoyed the vlog as usual !
loving vlogmas so much! this was one of my favourites, love the chats about how you first met 🥰🤍
love a Zoe vlog ❤love a Alfie edit! 😍
Not them um at the end 💀I love Alfie😂😂
Um, very nice vlog! 😊❤💙
HAHHAHAHA ALfie the end is LOLs... urm
Alfie taking the Michael with the erms fml 🤦🏽‍♀️ auto tune them into jingle bells. #bants
I can’t burp either! I have the exact same popping feeling in my throat too. I also make strange gurgling/growling noises in my throat 😭😭
I think it is so cute that they're still so giddy when telling the story of them meeting, even though it was over a decade ago. The cutest thing ever!!
Omg the umms at the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I wonder if Zoe watches the vlogs before they're uploaded to see what Alfie's done 😂I'm sure it's always light-hearted fun! On another note, I was having a really rough day today and having this Q&A chat felt like a nice check-in chat with friends. Thanks for always being real and sharing your lives with us 💜
I love your vlogmas Zoe! Always gets me in the festive mood and I can relax for a bit from an otherwise stressful everyday life ❤
Take a hair skin and nails vitamin daily and use a daily hair oil. It will make your hair less frizzy, shiny and manageable.
Did I miss your annual Bath & Body Works candle haul... 🤔?! Usually you used to order a big box around September-October, but I can't remember any candle haul 😊 #NoPressure Just wondering, of course! #CandleJunkieHere
zoe you're the most comforting person ever, i dont know how to explain it but i've been watching you for years and nothing makes me relax more than watching your videos and hearing you talk for a while, thank you <3
I'm currently getting help for ptsd, I've not been able to watch any TV for about a year now. I saw you were doing vlogmas and i used to enjoy watching so I thought I would give it a try. I've enjoyed every moment and started to reclaim my life back. Thanks for sharing.
Vlogmas is making me so happy this year thank you :) it’s exactly what I needed after working at the hospital 7days in a row
The um compilation 😆 Alfie, you are a little monster 🤣
Umm so funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oh my gosh Alfie!! The “um’s” at the end are hilarious ! 😆😂👏🏻
1 million percent resonate with what Zoe said about recharge days as a parent. I find it so hard too. The guilt is there but then I also just want to be with her 😅 and my brain feels so full with everything for my daughter and our family (like random stuff like apps and bin days etc). It’s so hard to find balance. I feel like men just don’t get it 😅
Alfie with the ummm montage at the end. Made me proper cackle, thanks for that 🤣🤣🤣
The ‘um’ montage at the end had me crying 😅
One of the best vlogmas you have done. Love seeing ye together and chatting 😊💖
I can't burp either!
One of the best vlogmas you have done. Love seeing ye together and chatting 😊💖
the UMMS at the end, sent me XD
Alfie!!!😂😂😂😂
Ummm ...... Love Alfies editing
She was nooooot kidding about the word ‘um’ jesus christ 😂😂😂😂😂
erm
thought i was alone with the fact i can’t burp the only time i burp is before i throw up lol 😭
The um bloopers are iconic 😂
Love the ehmm part 😂
Omg the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣
HAHAHA the ‘um’ part 😂😂😂
omg I love end of video why did it just make me laugh sooooooo much!! ummmmm Zoe are you ok?
this kind of ending needs to be included in every video going forward. incredible
Not Alfie including an “um” blooper reel 🤣 cackling 😂
Alfie you need to turn the um compilation into a christmas song
The end 😂😂😂😂😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
That happened to me only it was my skin. My skin used to be combination/oily but now postpartum it’s dry. So none of the old products I loved for my skin and makeup are good for it anymore 🤦🏻‍♀️
You could make a song out of those “um” 😂😂😂😂
Um, I love the end!!! 😆😆😆😆
Ummmmm… 😂😂😂 on dayes! Love you Alfie 🤣🤣🤣
C'mon now! You can't just leave us hanging at you two in bed and then Alfie placed... What did he place? Lol. Clearly it was impactful. 😂
What puzzle calendar do you have
it makes me so happy seeing that u are doing vlogmas again!! and now with ottie. such a cute baby, is crazy how time goes so fast
I feel like it was urhm because of her accent
Aw it was so sweet hearing you guys talk about how you met
The ending had me cry laughing 😂
Ummmmmm, loving vlogmas so happy it’s back love your little family 😊
I’m cackling at the “um’s” 😂😭
seeing them go down memory lane made me feel so warm and fuzzy but also so hopeful <33
uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm I found that funny
I can’t burp either, I hiccup or make weird sounds 😂😂😂  I get the mic taken out of me for it😅
So glad vlogmas is back!! x
Aaahahahhaha the ums are soo good!!!
The end 😂😂😂
Lol Alfie having fun with the editing at the end 😂
ahahaha I love that final edit with the 'uhms'. Letting Alfie edit the videos is the best collab ever. I love these so much <3
As someone who also has emetophobia and doesn't burp, it would SO unnerving if I started bleching too. I do little burps that are more like gasps of air (but I love the name turtle burp) and I like it that way.
Alfie was just in a silly goofy mood with the “um’s” at the end!
HAHAHA omg Alfie! I am absolutely cry laughing at the uhm edit! 😂
I don’t trust anyone who doesn’t like cheeslets, sorry Ottie ! Haha xx
THE UMS AT THE END HAHAHAHA
Love love love the effort put in the last bit of the vlog 😂😂 so goooddd! Can't wait to know Zoe's thoughts on that hahaha
Enjoying this years vlogmas with the family❤and the house looks gorg!!!!!
All Zoe’s Um’s could be edited into a Christmas tune 😊😂😂
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
eM I really enjoy the vlog.
Thanks Alfie for the laughs that the “um” clips at the end brought me 😂
This makes want to go out and buy a puzzle
Ammmm. loved the vlog!
do you guys ever plan on getting married
I have had a mini fire in my house and I do wake up at night sometimes in a panic.  also in the summer I've woken up from the windows being open and just a hint of bonfire will jolt me awake and I'll sprint through the house checking. it's terrifying
Not the “um” collage at the end 😭😂
The very end 😂 I wish we could see Zoe’s reaction to watching that. Loved it Alfie 🥰
the umhs part at the end of the vlog was hilarious 😂😂😂🤭
I have been loving Vlogmas this year. Seeing Zoe and Alfie being parents is the best! I have been watching both for over 10 years! We have a one year old as well (going to be two in March 😭) and seeing how they are handling parenthood brings me so much comfort that we aren’t alone! Zoe and Alfie are doing it too!  Also, Alfie’s edits are great 😂 I love the little things he leaves in that I think Zoe sometimes cuts out. And making fun of her for the “um” 😂
Ähem-Party 🤣
I can’t express how much happier is my every day now in December. I absolutely love vlogmas, I’ve been watching them ever since you first done it. Your family has a very special place in my heart❤️
hahaha the ums
uRmmmm
The end, Alfie you did Zoe so dirty ahahah😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anyone else stay till the very end 😂😂
Zoe's Vlogmas always inspires me to be more festive and puts me in such a good mood! So glad you are doing it again. Hope you keep doing them as long as you are able/they are fun for you too!
That ending 😂😂 thanks for the amazing video guys
UMMMM love you both 😂
There are actually really nice fire blankets that you can buy that you won't mind having up on the wall because they just look like decoration. Or there are other ones that almost look like a box or a coffee table book. It's a perfect holiday gift for family or a house warming gift.
Hahahaha the uhm edit 😂 amazing 🤣 happy to hear that you're all safe and good! And the house didn't catch fire whilist Ottie was upstairs.. What a nightmare 😟 Really enjoyed the video. Thank you for the lovely Vlogmas so far!
The compilation at the end literally got my cry laughing straight away!! 🤣🤣🤣
I’m absolutely loving vlogmas this year, thank you both for making december feel like normal and festive again 🤍 also the last 30 seconds of the video had me laughing so hard 😂
I am absolutely loving this year's vlogmas, making me feel so festive and you two make such an amazing team💕💞💞
The umms at the end! Good one Alfie😂
I also can’t burp 😌
Not that ending to the vlog 😂😂
Definitely have a fire blanket in the kitchen, best kept next to the stove top or oven...I've already had so many situations where it was needed 🙈
“Um um um um um um um um” ah yes i know exactly what you mean Zoe😂
Very good point about asking people how they are without interest in the answer. I used to have a friend who would ask and also give you the only response she was willing to take in: 'How are you doing? Good?'. See what she did there?! That's why we're no longer friends. Well, one of many reasons.  Surround yourself with people who are genuinely interested in how you are.
NOT THE ENDING
I can’t tell you how much the last 30 seconds of this video made me laugh  😂😂😂😂😂
Those ummms in the end 😂 Lovely vlog as always ❤️
I'm gonna miss your short hair 😥💖
HAHA all the "uhm" in the end 😂
Almost 35 here I have two kids, now 5 and 7 and my hair came back DARKER courser thicker oh and 2x the amount of greys at the temple, forehead hair line which is where I lost it all post baby twice 😅😅😂😂
Umm edit at the end😂 Who remembers courgette?Alfie ,was this payback time?😂😂😂😂😂
The vlogmas is definitely an Advent Calendar in itself! Also, thanks for the “ums” at the end 😂
The umm compilation at the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Vlogmas is helping me survive the 4 month sleep regression with my baby girl, it helps me start the day so happy and ready after a rough night thank you guys xxx 🙏🙏🙏
the ums at the end had me weeping. hilarious! xxx
Eeeehhhhmmmm 🤣
The end with all the umms killed me 🤣 🤣
ummm
re pregnancy question: I’m pregnant with my 3rd and I’m still constantly learning new things about being a mother ☺️
Get the fake batter candles for the foliage 😅
The ending is killing me 😂
Best Vlogmas yet!  AND we're 4 days in! Omg! I LOVE 2022 VLOGMAS! 👌🏽❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
No way! I'm the exact same, I cannot remember the last time I ever properly burped. I get these throat gargles if that makes sense hahaha xx😂
Zoe: "About 20 of Alfie's family are coming round Sunday, so I won't be filming much." Also Zoe: Posts 46-minute vlog 😂 No worries! I love long vlogs!
I would love to see you try the curly girl method! It may help your hair be more manageable
Something very special about this year’s vlogmas, its my daily dose of happiness :)
The "UMM" montage at the end😂 😂👏
I’ve been here so long that I remember seeing people speculate that you two were together on Tumblr 😂 everything about this vlogmas is nostalgic!!
Thank you Alfie for editing these videos so we have Vlogmas this year!! Definitely missed it!
The ums at the end killed me 😂
You guys are smashing out these vlogs, love the um bloopers that Alfie put together at the end, that was a lot of ums Zoe, love it! 🥰🤞🏻🤩
um
I absolutely loved you talking about your anxiety and how it changes when you become a parent. I felt like you were talking about MY LIFE!!! Could relate to everything you said 110%. I have found that since having my 2year old my anxiety has got worse, because like you say you have to power on through and it's harder to take that precious time to yourself. I just finished 8 weeks off therapy because I've not been so good at having early nights, making the time to read, have a bath, go on a walk, do yoga BY MYSELF! You don't realise how important your alone time is and to let go and relax until you become a parent x
Haha… great editing Alfie! Love the “uhm” compilation after the vlog 😅
Whoever stayed till the “um” bloopers are the MVPs 😄✌🏻♥️
The "um"s at the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣🧡🧡🧡 True love right there.
Loved the “ähm” montage at the end 😂 thx Alfie ❤
I am dying at the end 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I fully cackled out loud at the umm edit at the end. Completely caught me off guard. 10/10 edit, Alfie 👌🏻
Thought the video had started again until I started laughing like an idiot at all the "hums" ahahhah
living alone i get pretty lonely sometimes and watching these makes me feel like I'm hanging out with old friends
Omg Alfie, please help zoe edit her videos all the time, the Um's at the end was not expecting to be in fits of laughter with a zoella vlogmas video hahahah
After having my babies my hair turned into ringlets. I always had wavy frizzy hair and could make it curly but after the babies it is totally different
The ummsss in the end 😂😂😂😂😂
The “ums” had me 😂😂😂 nice touch Alfie! Hahaha
I blinking love you two, love your content, and Alfie Alfie deyes amen to you for that Um ending!!!!!! You actually made a 42 year old(and very young looking 42 year old) spit out her drink from laughing so much.....did zoe know? Lol
Go through all Zoe's Vlogmas and do a count of the number of times she says 'so cute'. It may even be tipping the thousands! :D
When u guys talked about how you met i felt soo included bc thats how i met u guys as a couple ahah i watched zoe’s videos and then i started watching alfies and then you guys were together and since then i’ve been a fan . Whenever i watch u guys i feel so loved , its crazyy 💜 love from portugal
The compilation of the ums..... Halarious 😂🤣😅
the end HAHHHAHAHAH
Vlogmas makes me have this feeling like it’s undesirable. It’s a good feeling. I can’t wait to see what is to come this month!! 🤍🤍🤍🤍
This year’s vlogmas are so good and special 😊
i have been watching zoe since i was 12 years now i am 21 and it feels just the same i loved growing up watching her she is such idol and vlogmas is something i anticipated every year when i was young i love watching it now even more
CRYING of laughter at the ending of this video omg 😂😂😂
UUUMMMM
The ummmmm had me in stitches, thanks Alfie for that, I love vlogmas❤
My hair also changed after pregnancy. My hair went from curly to more of a relaxed wave. I miss my old hair! 😢
crazy how we've all grown up together 😭 💖💖💖💖
The last 30 seconds 🤣🤣🤣 thanks alfie😂😂
Love love the um at the end lmao 🤣
The "Umm" compilation at the end is amazing 😂
The "um's" at the end really cracked me up! 😂
I absolutely LOVR the end! 😂 I am so glad the fire wasn’t worse! How scary. Definitely buy a fire extinguisher 🧯
Thank you guys for making such an effort this year. Absolutly loving the videos so far😍 also the uuhms at the end killed me😂😂 Zoe really wasn't kidding when she said she says uuhm a lot🤣
I am loving the "ehm" part at the end 😂
i knew when zoe said some vlogmas videos may be just 10-15 minutes long, that it couldn’t be true. a true zoe vlog could never be under 20 minutes and we love it❤️‍🩹
Hahahahha the last 30 seconds!!!! 😂😂😂
ummm
MESSAGE FOR ALFIE!!! thank you :)
the ending😭 alfie’s editing is the best
Omg the end 🤣
Wow! So glad y’all are safe!   You should look into fire escape ladders also for upstairs. I saw them at an Airbnb once. They are stored in like backpack type things but hook on windows so you can climb out if a fire is downstairs.
the last 30 secs of this vlog omggg
The umms at the end was incredible
Um um😂🤣😂🤣
Alfie .. erm .. I erm .. think you smashed … erm. That edit. Erm. Well done!
Not the um’s at the end 🤣😭😭😭😭 had me dying lol
I found the postpartum hair regrowth the worst part of the pregnancy and PP together! My son is 13 month old and my hair is terrible! I have short bangs that go sooo deep back and it looks horrible ☹️
I don't think you guy's understand how much we love the long vlogs istg stop apologising we love u, and Zoe u don't ramble we love it, I was around 14 when I started watching and now in feb I turn 21 now that is loyalty 😭😭❤❤
Hahaha the last 30 seconds 😂
💇🏼‍♀️ You should get a straightening keratin treatment on you hair! It has helped me a lot with my hair and I’ve had it done multiple times.  …Ahh you just mentioned the Brazilian blow dry - it’s similar! It’ll definitely help and you might not need the extensions after all ☺️ I love the shorter hair 😍
Oh my gosh, the compilation of "Um" in the end is hilarious. I love that since Alfie's editing, he could just take the piss 😆
Umm this was so good 😂
the ending 😂
AAAA you made my day by reading out my question. The mere thought of you guys reading my comment makes me so happyyy ❤️❤️
Omg the ending!! 😂 I cackled, we love the Alfie edits! Loving this Vlogmas guys, best part of my day!!
Umm ummm ummm Loved this Vlog.😜 Zoe you can also try Hair Botox to help your situation .
You should give zoe a promise ring. Promise to be the best partner, father and friend xxx you are both such a lovely couple
I’ve never laughed so much at the ums 😂 God bless Alfie

The um’s at the end and knowing Alfie is the one editing this makes it’s so much more funny!! 😂😂
Haha love the Q&A so sweet and classic. The um thing was funny! Cutest 😍 couple ever!

The UM montage at the end is killing me😂
I cant burp either...😂
the ums at the end 😂
I also can't burp, I just make this weird silent air noise
I couldn’t burp until a few years ago!! It was SHOCKING
The "um" compilation at the end really got me hahaha so stinkin' funny!
Thank you so much Alfie for 46:04 & onwards 😂😂😂😂😂 this has to be you
Ummmmmm 😂
Haha that ending! Loved it
I have the throat burps too Zoe!!! LOL
Honestly, loving the edit Alfie 😂 Don't get me wrong I love Zoe's editing too but the end of this video was just so funny. I couldn't stop laughing. LOVED IT.
Was not expecting that ending.. 😂😂😂 Alfie...... rofl 🤣 😂 🤣 😂 🤣
My hair grew back coarser, frizzier, curlier, and darker?! What the heck!
All I can picture now is Alfie sat editing that clip of Zoe's Errrm's at the end and laughing to himself as he clips it on the end.
You guys have told the how you met story before and you guys told it the same way you did before! That’s so funny! 🥰♥️ looking forward to the rest of vlogmas!
OMGGGGGGG IM CRYING WITH THE LAST PART OF THE VLOG AMMMMM 😂😂😂😂
the umm compilation cracked me up😂
Just loving these vlogs ❤🎅🏼
The ums at the end gave me a well needed belly laugh 😂
Pre Christmas with joe and Dianne!!!
Not sure if its available in the UK, but I get a treatment called Magic Sleek to calm down my curls and frizz. Cuts down my styling by an hour! (I have very tight curls)
Omg I can’t burp either 😂😂 never burped in my life. There’s a lot of evidence that suggest people with emetaphobia can cause themselves not to burp through anxiety and it effects the muscles in the oesophagus
Alfie, does Zoe know what the last 30sec of her vlog is?! Made me laugh😂 enjoying vlogmas thanks for making it possible💗
I look forward to these videos everyday!😁
These vlogs are bringing me such daily joy, thank you alfie and Zoe for putting them together for us. I look forward to watching them each day ❄️✨🌲 Also - to your smear test mention the other day, very important. Mine came back abnormal this round even though it’s been less than 3 years since my last one. Having another checkup/follow up testing Friday 🙏🏻 So ironic that you mentioned it in your vlog. Thanks for this important reminder Zoe!!! 💕
omg I can't burp either and my friends used to think I was weird making those noises but now they just ignore it ahaha
You have to try the Girly Girl methode! Your hair is NOT frizzy it is just curls wanting to happen. The new hair is just healthy hair which curls much easier. Would love to see your natural wavy/curly hair. Love the short hair 💜
Maybe try extentions that are medium length instead of super long? That my help you find the perfect hair for you, since you like shorter hair but need longer to style? I'm sure whatever you decide will turn out great.
OH MY GOD I WAS ABOUT T BUY THE NIBBLIES CHEDDAR AND SMOKED PAPRIKA TODAY but i took it out of my cart last min before heading to the cash register . your reaction just made me wanna go get it tomorrow.
Zoe, you need to try the Colour Wow Dreamcoat, it's amazing for frizz !!
So happy you're doing Vlogmas ❤️These are my absolute favorite! I love that you're also such an early riser like me. I wake up at 5h30 every morning even though I start work at 8, and I'm in bed by 9 😂 and I'm 25 w/ no kids!
The ummms in the end hahahaha!!😂
This Vlogmas and all the lovely people here, just brings me joy and happiness! I just love this community that you created, and thankful for so many lovely people here! :) 🥰🥰🥰🥰
I’ve been an on and off viewer for like 9 years, now my toddler and I love watching this year’s vlogmas together 💗
