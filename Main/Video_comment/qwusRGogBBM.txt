Omg can't wait finally 💙
Oh my God, literally the most annoying couple I’ve ever seen on the Internet and that says a lot. And by the way, arrowhead is dirt water.
Imagine what the boy’s life will be like.  He’ll be in preschool, and he’ll bring a picture of Mom’s vintage car for show and tell!  Awesome!
It's so beautiful with the lights on the hillside. I'm so glad you got yourself a new camera. I also purchased myself one. As mine I loved was stolen year's ago and I replaced it but with nothing expensive. Yes I found one I could not resist the one I purchased myself for my Birthday. Was a Nikon digital. It's the most beautiful red color. I would love a nail, lip and car the same shade. Yet I was so happy and excited to see it when it arrived. Yet I've not taken anything with it. Just look at it. I'm not a very great deal. I understand how you feel. When I was pregnant with my Son. I went into real labor not the Braxton hicks the Dr. Bet I was in. I had to go in for a checkup. He had to exam me. The first thing he said was G.D. Your not ready to have that baby you haven't gained enough weight. I was 7 months and barely showing. I only gained 26 lbs total. The last 8 lbs. was the day before they put me I to the hospital. I was put on bedrest for a solid month I was scared to death. I was told to stay in bed and take the medicine I was given to stop my labor. Since it was too soon. I had the worst back pains. My husband purchased me a beautiful wooden rocking chair. Which I fell in love with. I would rock and put my hands on my tummy and talk to the baby. Of course I had to have a seat cushion because of the pressure on my pelvis. My Baby was the best thing I've ever done and I am still so grateful. Our marriage didn't last. The way I had hoped as for me it was forever and a day. Yet we were together 10 years. I was told I most likely unable to get pregnant due to some issues I had. So when I held my baby boy for the first time. I was counting his fingers and toes. Congratulations to you both. 💕💖💕💖🦋💐🫶
You are both so different irl compared to your persona's on tiktok. I personally have never heard Maverick's voice and he's hilarious, and your original voice is beautiful. You guys are amazing people and parents. So glad you were blessed with Midnight after the long journey of trying to get pregnant and being told it wasn't possible. I wish you and your family the best and most amazing life
Awh so cute
💙💙 Congratulations you finally started your family
I know what you did 9 months ago.
She really looks like maralin minro
Hey Jasmin I hope everything is alright with you and her beautiful baby boy midnight I hope you and Mavericks are doing good I really enjoy your videos very much but I thought you were going to post a couple of times a week and now you haven't posted for a very long time on your main panel yes I've been watching Tik-Tok yes I've been watching short but we make your videos twice a week I miss you a way to make money you need to be consistent on your Channel you don't lose a lot of people who watch your videos if you don't post for a while people won't watch anymore I will always watch your videos I won't ever leave because I really like you midnight is so handsome and you are so beautiful please don't post things like the week even once a week miss you please come back

You are not only beautiful and very sweet. You’re an angel and have the patience of Jesus. You have a ton of excitement in your life lol whew ❤
Umm.. I think Jasmine Looks so Much more prettier With a baby with No baby she is so pretty!
You're hands are so sweet🎀💕 My sister and I just adore your femininity🙂🌹
CAN WE JUST HAVE A MOMENT TOO APPRECIATE MAVERICK, GOD TIER HUMAN RIGHT THERE!!
Having lots of sex can and will bring on labor!
Not rlly sorry but he’s so fckn annoying Like why tf is he screaming It was so awkward like painfully awkward rude & weird af
I'm not going to lie but when u had ur vintage outfits u kinda reminded me of Marylin Monroe and I just love her style and when u r in that vintage u was very pretty but u r very pretty in this video (don't take this comment in a wrong way pls)
How did you and your hubby meet?❤️
I was 1cm for almost 4 weeks!! I feel you girl!!
Maverick is so entertaining 😭✨
january 6th was my bday
Also if you ever need a break just tell us we will be okay.
You are so lucky!my older sister just got married I can’t wait for her to have a baby :d
aw beautiful family jasmine!! <3 im so happy for you n ur husbands a goofball lol
I would have never thought maverick acted that way through the tik tok video love how goofy he acts 😂 beautiful family 🥰
Awww 🥺🥺💕💕💕
omg i live for Maverick you guys balance eo out so welllll!!! 🤍💙🤍💙🥰
I don’t understand why people expose their kids on internet when they can’t give consent or have a say in the matter
Omg, Maverick and his legos LOL
I remember seeing your baby bump just starting out! I was watching every video you posted!
Ready to binge watch all 4. Watching these for the first time! It was worth the wait!
I love her aura she’s so pretty 😍
This was almost how my prelabor with my son was. He was way over his due date and I had to be induced. And I tried for weeks to get him to come so many different ways and nothing worked. I had to be induced. And that was insane.
We also like seeing maverick... Such an awesome husband and dad.
Thank you for sharing this. It is so personal and it is so nice you shared it. Thank you. And congrats on your beautiful baby boy.
january 10 is my birthday ❤️
Maverick is so funny lol  Jasmine you are such a strong woman so proud of you 💪
Your husband is so much fun !!! Haha love his personality
maverick is hilarious 😭😭😭
What kind of camera did you buy
Here from tiktok!! I am having my first baby, also a boy, in 7 days by c section because he is breech. Really nervous but I know it will all be worth it!!
You can see all in maverick face he felt like he would take the pain away if he can.
everything about her relationship with her husband makes me feel very safe. theyre gonna be the best parents
First of All, CONGRATULATIONS! Secondly, Thank You for this collection with so much included. I know you guys will treasure these videos for all time. My babies were born in '87, '91, '96 & we only have a few precious photos. My favorite saying in this video comes from Maverick, seeing you through his eyes. Lovely.
When said he's camera shy awwwwwn 😍
When said he's camera shy awwwwwn 😍
It's so neat how all the homes ate like at different levels (if I make any sense...lmao). So neat to look out and you can look down and see house lights or look up and see another home and it's lights. Just different then say here in NJ where I live. We look out and our neighbors homes are literally right next to us....front yard, back yard and side yard...lmao. We are all equally spaced a part and next to. Just looks so pretty when she shows us it got dark way to fast for her walk. I know it is the "Hills" but it looks so neat and beautiful. I wish I could see if the land was actually like this or if it just looks like it in the video. I hope again, this even makes logical sense as others are reading this comment.  Haha.
Mav is giving me such ADHD vibes and im living for it 🤣💗
The baby is gonna grow up and love these videos. Also how insane is it that she looks like she’s actually glowing! Not a lie when they say pregnant women glow.
Hi
Have sex. What they use is bull sperm to start labor. (Just what makes labor start)The semen softens up your cervix... So sex !!
Your husband is the cutest!!! I follow you on Tik Tok and decided to follow you here too and I feel like I’m seeing a whole new look into your life vs on Tik Tok!! Love this ❤️❤️
Jan. 10th is my Birthday... Lol!! Congratulations you 2 beautiful souls!!
maverick is such a great husband. my exes name was maverick but he was a horrible boyfriend 😔
congrats on the baby!!! i love your channel it’s amazing!!!
arrowhead and doordash please sponsor mavrick.
Omg I love you so much your so pretty
Breathe of fresh air.. keep being you
Amazing video
Jasmine I love uuuuu 💕 😘
Be yourself, and let Maverick be himself too!   So it won't be so awkward lol 🤣🥰
You are beautiful 😍 he’s so sweet to you
OMG YOUT HAPPINESS GIVES ME JOYYY🥰🥰🥰🥰😆😆😆😆😆😍😍😍😍🤩🤩
Congrats he so cut we done u al the pain is worth it ect ur brave record it all ect
Hi Jasmine it's wonderful to see what happened before your baby came. You look wonderful and your husband is fabulous. 💞💙
I hope whenever I get pregnant and go into labor that I have this kinda calm energy. I know she’s in so much pain but she’s so chill about it all. I have a feeling I’m gonna be walking around crying, like that slinging snot all over the place kinda crying and cursing every other word 😂
I want to hear your accent more
❤️
Holy smokes.... Is your husband always on level 10?! 😳 That would drive me insane... Especially during labor! Whew!
When they were still at the house I felt so bad for her, if you think the contractions are bad now girl just wait 😳 they get so much worse 😑
Mavericks just screaming JACKKK and jack be like :/
Hi your so sweet
So excited!! ❤
Y’all are so sweet ❤️❤️❤️ I love your voice! It’s addicting 😍
I just can't stop smiling when Marverick is so energetic in half of the video taking over.<3
this is so precious i’m gonna cry
Complain on girl complain on
omg you definitely have the pregnancy glow! you’re so gorgeous! I know you’re a new mom so no rush !! but in the future can you share the foundation and blush you use? ? it’s been really hard for me to find a foundation!   anyways lots of love! 💖
My oldest son was born on Jan 10th, but 23 years ago lol
Your husband is so funny and chill! You caught a quality guy, plus being human sunshine yourself. Now a little baby! Perfect family ❤
Cannot wait for part 2!
This may be posted somewhere, but I had to ask. The psychic from your previous videos mentioned the female spirit which we assume is Marilyn is attracted to you. Some of us may know that Marilyn had miscarriage as part of her story— have you noticed any activity or attraction to Midnight since he’s been home? @jasminechiswell
What camera did you get!
hearing his heartbeat at the doctor's appointment made me remember how much I miss that sound 😪🥰
Also Jasmine… You looked absolutely stunning during your whole pregnancy.
his name is midnight
Maverick is my spirit animal.
Omg
I love this so much because it’s not like the “typical” youtube couple thing. I don’t know, just feels like I’m watching a documentary or even older movie. It just has a totally different vibe. I love it! Congratulations on your beautiful son, you guys are adorable 🥰
Your husband  is a wirdo
thank you so much for sharing something so personal❤️❤️ you’re gonna be an amazing family omg
hello
welcome midnight ❤️❤️❤️
Midnight is literally the cutest thing ever
Cuutteee
Jasmine ❤️ you are like my favorite person to watch. I love Marilyn Monroe so I decided to check out your videos, I now adore you ( not in a creepy way) lol. You are beautiful but also so kind and sweet, it just radiates from you. Congratulations on your new baby boy he is absolutely adorable. Also anyone that hates on you is just jealous don’t take it to heart. Usually people who act like that hate themselves and want everyone else to feel as miserable as they do. ❤️💕❤️
Iv been watching you Throughout my pregnancy. All your reels on Instagram about pregnancy. I was due on Valentine’s Day but I had my baby on Jan. 15 2022 and I can’t believe we ended up having our baby’s on the same day I remember being board in the hospital and I looked you up to see if you had your baby yet.  It’s such an amazing thing to give birth and have a baby. Being a mom is the best thing iv ever done in my life. I’m sure you feel the same. Enjoy it 💕
I feel so bad but im happy you have such a suportive husband💖
I'm so glad I watched this you really get to see the awesome relationship you and your hubby have 😊 adore you guys congratulations on your baby boy 💚💚🌟🌟
you look amazing and always do cant wait to see part 2 and cant wait for all yr memorys sending love from yr home scotland xx
I was 2 weeks late with my first 🥰🤗💋👶🏽
Every woman deserves a man who is willing to support their wife while giving birth to their child/children. Maverick is a great support system.
You look beautiful 😍
Do you still live Marilyn Monroe old house
Her accent is so cute! I can't place it, though.
maverick apologizing every two seconds for saying something that could be even a little bit offensive, he's so wholesome... 😭
Maverick is a natural behind that camera
💞🙌💗🙏💕
Is this your real voice? It’s so cute
“jasmine has kept me up”  jasmines face: 😃   LMFAOOOOOOOOOO
I love yall so much
it is hers not yours dont
Is Maverick drunk 🥴
Aww I'm so glad he's here xxx I remember waking up when my Mum was in labour she was in so much pain!! Congratulations 🎉
Congratulations to you both! Can't wait to see little man grow! You guys are going to be great parents
Would you ever consider daily vlogging Jasmine?  Love your videos :)
I want that couch
Where is part 2
Omg I can't wait until part 2!
I’m not sure if this is offensive or not but is maverick like behind mentally or something, idk something is off
The whole tiktok was waiting for you and soups baby 🥺❤
I love mavericks energy
Childbirth is emotional
Congratulations! I’m so happy for you! I wish you the best!
I had membrane sweep Thursday 2/8 I went into labor 2/10.  :)
I love ur energy
Thank you for allowing us to come along on your increditable journey. As a woman that wasn't blessed with the ability to make a child it's been so fun watching you and Mavrick through the highs and lows. Your honesty and raw emotions, your love for each other and now the overwhelming love for your son will be something I'll never forget.  💜
My son is 18 and he was due on the 8 th January but didn’t come tell 12 we’re I had c section he didn’t want to Come Lol he was born with jaundice so I had stay in hospital with him for about 2 weeks  There was some Compactions later into my pregnancy with him he has asd which I still think to this day it was due to that .  Anyway enough about me congratulations for your beautiful baby xx
The symptoms you were describing 2 days before your original due date was the exact thing I went thru with one of my sons. I had a placenta rupture sadly and a 9 day nicu baby :)
I’m at 39 and 2 or 3 now. I’m feeling the same way now. I legit only have 3 little stretch marks and I know it’s stupid to complain. But you just … don’t FEEL like yourself. You feel swollen and weak and uncomfortable and stretched and achey and it just makes you sad about your poor body haha
Maverick is annoying AF
Her face when Maverick said "Jasmine has been keeping me up" 😂
we got a lot to talk about on our Show. We are dropping clips before we let out the whole episode. Come by and enjoy.
What’s his name
I was so hoping for a jam 10th baby. That's my son's birthday! Congrats
Who’s your injector and plastic surgeon?
Part 2 plz!!!
Milk that YouTube money milk milk milk
I'm sure the kid will grow up well adjusted after involuntarily being online their entire life...
Part 2 plssss
Oh my gosh you are so sweet 🥺🥺😫
Mavric gives me Lin well Miranda energy
Why is this shite on my recommended?
Can we get a family channel
I love how excited you were before giving birth to your baby 😍 you're such a sweetheart and you always bring me a smile when I see you. I love your personality Jasmine. Again congrats for your beautiful boy ❤️🥰
Who are you ? and why is it in my recommended 😡
ThAnkyou so much for sharing this with us 🥺🥺🥺🥺 this was so so beautiful!!

Child support incoming!
Maverick is fucking killing me 🤣🤣🤣 He is so hysterical

Who’s remotely interested?
I love Maverick's chaos camera skills 🤣
Congratulations you guys
ITS THE PERFECT TIME to complain😂. Also, your hubby is a handful 😂.   he will need it for the toddler stage❤️
Why is maverick giving me RED FLAGS 🚩 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩
Who cares waste of time.
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
OMG! WHO THE HELL CARES!
When I am 17 this baby boy will be 7!!!
Remember when people just had kids and were happy and didn't try to use it to get views and make money?
really hope you found the validation you were looking for thinking your any more special than any other family out there sharing the same beliefs that this doesnt need to be a youtube video. think about your kid years down the road having to look at this feeling uncomfortable bc his life had to be presented to the world on youtube. feelin sorry for him already
Who tf cares??
bless your heart jasmine ❤️
Maverick seems so fun to be around you must never get bored with him lol
Congratulations, can’t wait to watch him grow up.
This video just seems useless
"I feel like I've been pregnant for 10 years"..."I feel like you've been talking for 10 years". Why did you make a video all about talking! I think you need to rethink video ideas and write down or think about what you are going to say. It's NOT very entertaining to see people talk and talk and blab about nonsense. You could have just made a shirt video of part 1. No one sits there watching you talk for 18 MINUTES!!!! 18 MINUTES!!!! 18 ONE AND EIGHT...EIGHTEEN..AND 29 seconds..you should have just made a 10 min talking video. For crying out loud WOMAN!!!
i cant believe how beautiful you are!!! youre 9 months pregnant, LITERALLY GIVING B I R TH looking like a g O D D E S S YOU QUEEN! congratulations to you both!!!! hope you are recovering well!
Maverick and his Legos 😂 ahh how exciting! You are always glowing ❤🙏🏼
Is this the walmart version of Marilyn?
Omg I never imagined Maverick being so funny lol 🤣
i feel so bad for that child
You look exactly like Maraliyn Monroe
We need part 2 Jas!!!
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates- 🎈
Maverick and his Legos  ahh how exciting! You are always glowing ️
I can’t wait for baby to grow up and be the most beautiful boy💙💙💙
You literally just having a baby for yourself and you're all about having a baby as soon as the kid grows up you're not going to want anything to do with them cuz you're going to f*** them up and not teach them how the f****** world works I hate b****** having kids for the publicity and trying to act like they're going to be the best mom for their friends to be impressed
SO HAPPY FOR YOU ALL!! 😍😍😍
Your hair and makeup on ur due date was so BEAUTIFUL 😻😻 can’t wait to see more content like this and hair tutorials when you’ve rested. You and your family are sooo lovely to watch! Love how excited Mav is ! ❤️ congratulations on your new addition.

Hi
Hi
Aw if he came on January 9th he would have the same bday as meeee xxx
KAEOT President Calls for More International Cooperation to Stop the CCP’s Atrocities Lee Seungwon, president of the Korea Association for Ethical Organ Transplants (KAEOT), said that the world has been paying attention to the incredibly evil human organ harvesting in China since 2006. Unfortunately, since 2000, countless Koreans have received organ transplants in China, mostly supplied through illegal channels.  “It’s a disgrace that Korea, a nation that practices democracy and legal justice, gains such a shameful reputation,” he said.  He said that KAEOT had submitted a list of Chinese doctors involved in organ transplant crimes to the Korean government last year and urged the government to ban the doctors from entering Korea.   “I believe all the determination and actions to stop it are evidence of the human conscience. The society of health care, law, politics, and civil organizations around the world have to work together to make things right,” he declared.

Your makeup is flawless, please do a tutorial! 😍
Someone count how many times she said ‘so basically’ or ‘basically’ 😂 it’s the ‘I need to remove that from my vocala…. Volcamblhr…. VOCALBARY!’
I am assuming the father will be present at the birth. He should not expect any instructions to come with the baby
So happy for you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
god she s self obsessed
The hold out on the name is so unnecessary
What's babies name he's so beautiful jasmine omg
Can I ask what accent that is, at time sounds southern and then English 😂 so confused
Thank you so much for feeling so comfortable to show this to your followers and fans. I’m really thankful to see this it’s such a special moment for you. I hope to become a great mother like we know you’re going to be <3
Makes me laugh so much that the chat from the premiere is basically only people saying "can you say hi (name) please" and not talking about the video
Yes! YES!😊😊😊😊😊. I'm so excited that you have a beautiful boy, Jasmine! I'm proud of you! Cheers to you and your new baby! Happy 2022!😊😙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙🍾🌷💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉👍. And Maverick is a good gentleman with great achievement!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👍

I told maverick that if people watched your YT videos they would know maverick is a good guy. So exciting Jasmine!  P.S You’re trending! 🥰
Did you say the birth of your son siz?
maverick make a YouTube !!
This is the end. Everything foretold in the book of revelation (written in the Bible) will unfold. The Lord is returning shortly for His people. They are a holy, righteous, and blameless people. They have been prepared and made ready by the Holy Spirit. Those who desire eternal life must come to Jesus Christ now before the doors of mercy close. They must also reject the Covid-19 vaccine and warn others to also do the same.  It's not God's will that anyone perish but all repent to receive eternal life. Jesus Christ loves everyone. The Lord didn't die in vain. He is the King of Glory. His name will be Glorified throughout the earth by His servants from around the world.   If you're willing, now is the time to repent and prepare for the return of the King. Those who are left behind after the rapture will suffer unimaginably. They will have to die for their faith in Jesus Christ. They will be killed by the antichrist. Seek Jesus Christ now before the doors of mercy close. I don't want anyone to be disappointed for all eternity.
Ughhh why didn’t you start posting before he was born 😔😫
Sooooo exciting
Really looking forward to part two ❤️
https://youtu.be/MmxQR1qr6r4
I’m so happy for you Queenie! Love u to 💖
Jesus Christ! I hope we don't see some pregnant birds clacker!
I feel like this shows such a more real side of you guys and I love it so much!!
Guys it's 11th on trending aaa
awe a whole family channel
The way he said "I got one sock 😎" LOLL  and I carnt wait to see the baby grow up ♡♡
Maverick is amazing. Reminds me of my fiancé he’s a goofball when I give him my phone bc he doesn’t have an IG only I do. And then I find random pics of me very tired, eating etc on his phone and he’s confused bc he says “oh but you looked beautiful”. He too likes legos. The energy is a lot but these kind of men are treasures 💕
Jesus died for all yall out here and loves u wherever youre at ❤ none of us are promised tomorrow where will u spend eternity? Is it not worth thinking a bit more about? Be blessed yall ❤
Maverick and his Legos  ahh how exciting! You are always glowing ❤️
Family and YouTube hasnt exactly mixed well in the past hope nothing bad happens but I got low hopes
she’s so adorable
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hope part 2 comes soon...congratulations
this video should be called 18 minutes of Maverick shouting
Y’all are so wholesome 💙 Really enjoyed watching y’all Maverick had me laughing for sure! You are gorgeous even in pain and are soo blessed , thank you for sharing your journey with me
You’ve got a wee American twang going on 😂
It’s a lie that baby doesn’t move as much when there about to born and if baby isn’t moving as much you should go straight to hospital as it can be a sign that something is wrong. I know you’ve had your baby now but that’s really bad advice.
shout out to jasmine for having SO MUCH patience with maveric. im sorry but i could never (especially pregnant)
why is mavric literally yelling
Congratulations to you both 😍 Maverick and his legos 😂😂
When maverick said, “if only they could see you how I see you” MY Heart!!!!! 🥺💗
So much of your days leading to baby reminds my of the weeks before my daughter was born. I was going through very similar pains to you. I ate spicy food while pregnant sure as much had no affect on my daughter making her appearance sooner! This is so fun to watch!!
Keep noticing your accent keeps changing 😂 One minute you sound American then the next Scottish. 😄
I absolutely loved this, so excited for episode 2!! Jasmine, you’re genuinely so effortlessly beautiful, thank you for taking us on this very special journey with you and Maverick! Sending loads of love from Manchester UK!  P.S I had my first baby when I was 15, I went 10 days overdue and was induced. She was just not budging! I had a baby girl, Phoenix Skye 💗 she is 11 now and has three more sisters! First babies are pretty stubborn! Xxxx
no one cares women have babies every second of the day in the thousands its not special
The wigs in the back are like 👁👄👁
♥️♥️♥️♥️🥰 woooww! Such a precious thing! 😭
Jasmine already thinking about another baby😂😂
I could never go through labor. That is why my mom is the best.
Marilyn Monroe?
Soo exited cant wait for your cute baby🌈💓
eee
Love from Pakistan 💚🇵🇰
My beautiful 😍😍😍❤️
I'm so happy for you guys I know that you'll be the best parents thanking you for sharing your journey with us
This is so Precious and Special!! 🙌🏻❤️❤️ Thank You for sharing such a beautiful part of your pregnancy with us! It’s touching!
Can’t wait for part 2! so happy for you guys. Such a cut / adorable family💕 👱‍♀️👨🏻‍🦱👶
If you have another baby I have a book recommendation for you 😊😊 it's called hypnobirthing it helped me so much in my second pregnancy/ labor
I am 27 weeks with my second son I love seeing these videos ATM to remind me of how magical the last few weeks are I can't wait to meet my second little man so much your son is so handsome and you look beautiful xx
Lol. You guys are so adorable & hysterical. Lol. It's the final countdown. Get it? Lol. Jasmine you are a beautiful mama to be.
Omg you would have been induced on my 20th birthday. My mum was late with me and was told she would be induced on the 19th and my mum was adamant I wouldn’t be born on the 19th as it was the anniversary on my dads mums death. So I came early, always the way
Maverick seems like a really god supportive birthing partner and he keeps you laughing 🤣 you look beautiful Jasmine 😍
Part 2!!!!! 😍😍❤️❤️
She’s an absolute doll isn’t she🇬🇧🥰
9:19 so gorgeous !!!!!!!!!
Oh my god i absolutely fucking LOVE Maverick. He is such a goofy and happy go lucky dad. He is such a cutie. He needs to appear in more YouTube videos. I want to see a tour of his Lego.  Maybe we you could do a Maverick Monday where he does a video of something and edits it so that mumma can have a break but still get the upload benifits ❤️  Edit... HOW THE FUCK are you that pregnant and look that beautiful 😍 pregnancy has really suited you ❤️
Congratulations again to ur beautiful baby boy! 💙🍼 Sidenote: Maverick is so funny and hyper I can't 😂😂😂 when he lifted his shirt I dieddd 🤣

How does marlyn feel about the new beautiful baby?
I like how she just went like” oh frick” when she said “I’ll record you urself” I don’t think you’ll be getting any of sleep 💀👌
How does it feels like a 1st time mom
Do u get charged $ everytime u go to L&D triage. Cuz u went like 3 times
Such sweet precious moments 💞💖💜
OMGG CONGRATS JASMINE!!❤ You and Maverick will be the best parents ever! Sending love from Sweden <33
He’s so annoying and not your aesthetic. Took away from your baby. Sorry to say. But baby daddy is a douche.
maverick is hilarious 😂😂😂 but i’m so happy for you both ♥️♥️♥️
I am so OBSESSED with her skin, she is literally glowing🥰
Yay! Love it!
Omg  he’s adorable one question tho did you want girl💕 or boy 💙
The Quality of this video is so good ! You are so so beautiful!!!!
When I was born, I ended up being a MONTH past my due date! We always joke that I didn't want to leave because it was just so warm and comfy!
Omg I'm so excited for part 2!!! I love you and your videos and I am so so very happy for you guys! Your little one is so adorable 🥰 much love from the Hawkins family in Alton illinois
We're birthday buddies!! So happy for you!! <3 <3
You are beautiful
Imagine having such beautiful parents. Especially a mom who looks exactly like Marilyn Monroe. Congrats!
So excited, you are such a great Mom!
You’re definitely going to get a bigger following because of the camera !😄
I wish you would use your natural voice all the time, we don't need you to put on a show or be somebody you aren't ❤️
so excited for you ❤️
You look beautiful!
My 3 old Year old son name is Maverick . And so sweet and crazy 🥰 I love that name
i am so happy for you!!! and you have had my full support all through this
I believe if your friend had a hairstyle similar to Jane Russell then u 2 could remake my favourite film ,its uncanny
here for the Jack & Lexie content 🤣❤️
Yay so excited to see more videos! So awesome you got to film these final moments.
Maverick is so funny excited to watch more of this series 😄
He is so cuteee!! And super lucky to have such great and genuine parents!!
So happy for u girl!! ur gonna be a great mom!!
Oh how remember those looong last few weeks and being so scared about the delivery 😬 So happy that you and the baby are doing so well. Those first days of him being in the NICU had to be so very scary. He's just a beautiful little boy and I'm so happy for you guys 💕 Look forward to seeing the little guy grow up!!
You are so beautiful that pregnancy glow. I just want to say I struggled so much with postpartum depression and I had such guilt with not feeling like excited I had this beautiful baby girl but all I could think of was my son who was born sleeping. But I made it through with the help of drs and support I know postpartum is not talked about a lot but if anyone needs someone to talk to I'll be here. I wish the internet had been this big when I had my daughter cause I have meet so many wonderful ladies.
What a beautiful video! You are so sweet and so beautiful, love your energy. I can’t wait to see the next part of this series! 😍
Was he born on the 15th or 16th bc if he was born on the 15th it shares a bday with my brother if he was born on the 16th it shares a bday with me
Hey just a question but have you announced his name yet or have i missed it, and don’t feel pressured to put it out whatever you decide is great was just wondering.
I had the membrane sweep 4 days before due date and gave birth 1 day before due date!
1:33 the birth of my son what?
Maverick is sooo animated hahaha. I need that couch!!!

More, more videos please! I love watching these birth adventures❤️
I can't believe she didn't name him Dallas      Ok so it's a joke 😅 because she looks like Marilyn Monroe
Maverick randomly flashing the camera is immaculate
Totally didn’t bump in to a wall while watching this….

The pain you feel during contractions I feel is the absolute worse and you will not experience any worse pain after child birth. The pressing down on my stomach didn’t feel any worse nor did the after labor pains is what they call them
Your husband is hilarious

Hi Jasmine, what’s the bubs name?
Maverick is such a funny man 😂
i love you!! you’re so cute and i love your personality
So so happy for you. I can’t wait to see the memories you choose to share with us. 💕💕
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Just for future and people in the comments, babies actually SHOULD move all the way up until birth! Obviously everyone has different experiences and it doesn’t always mean somethings wrong but if you notice a significant change in baby’s movements, you should always get checked out! 🧡 I’m so excited for you and your journey into motherhood, it’s the most special experience in this world.
Wishing you blessings with your new adorable addition! Hope parenthood treats you both well. Love you so much!! 🥰💕💕
THE 15th IS MY BIRTHDAYYY OMGG
Congratulations on your son❤️
I was so excited when I saw this by the way I'm obsessed with mavericks personality he is so funny and supportive😂🤍
You look absolutely beautiful Jasmine.
Girl I had no idea you have a YouTube channel!! I can’t wait for the second half of this video!!
Also ahhhh when is pet two coming out I’m so excited
I thoroughly enjoyed every second of this Jasmin 💗 such a beautiful insight into your pregnancy x
I can’t wait for the second part!
I never came to YouTube this fast
Maverick trying to flash us 😂😂 I’m dead

Where's the "birth"? This video should have been titled differently, its misleading!!!!!!!!
January 10th is my birthday
OMG i am so proud of you im so happy for you and ur baby i love you so much and i hope ur little Boy is well and healthy ❤❤❤❤
Lovely video. Congratulations on your baby boy 💙
So beautiful ❤️
Congratulations, love bug! 🥰 Motherhood looks amazing on you! Sending all of my love your way! ♥ ♥ 💕
I totally relate to you with having a fear of needles!! I was induced with my first son and had the WORST panic attack over the initial IV. To this day I feel so bad for the nurse that put it in, she had to give me oxygen and was so patient with me! 😂 Ironically I did fine getting the epidural, but I think at that point my body was in so much pain that I just didn't care anymore. I'm getting induced tommorow morning with my second kiddo and I am so nervous!!
For everyone wondering his name they recently did a TikTok on the husbands and he pointed his finger when the word will came on which makes sense in all her hints she’s given so his name is Will and I’m willing to bet my life on it 😆 or William whatever one don’t matter haha 😂
Congratulations on your sweet bundle . I have 4 boys and they are amazing . Enjoy and he’s handsome.
Love from Northern Ireland 🍀💐
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ur baby is a Capricorn ♑️! So cool !!
i’ll never forget when my first niece was born, she’s turning 7 now tkme flies :)
you are so amazing!! i can tell you guys will be outstanding parents 💗💗
Who else came from her TikTok lmao
Wait did you say in the video the birth of your son sea? 😍 did I hear that correctly
Congratulations jasmine x
I love this jasmin!! I think you should do lots of a day in the life with a newborn. And just lots of family vlogs. I’d say also baby’s first outings but with Covid I’m sure you are dad are not really going to bring him out to really public places to expose him. But do remember it’s good to expose him to some outings like a store while he has a car seat cover so he doesn’t catch Covid. He still needs to build up his immune system or he’s just going to be a extremely sick person growing up so it’s good for him to get a little cold or fever here and there! As a first time mom you’re probably thinking “ this lady is flipping out of her mind nuts” I promise I’m just one momma helping you as a new momma out with some pointers. But no one knows your sweet angel boy but you,dad, and baby’s doctor!! Congratulations mama!!!!!! 🍾🥂❤️
❤️❤️❤️
You’re a sunshine and you always bring a smile on my face, you deserve all the good things in this world: I’m so happy for you! Thank you for all you do, sending all my love <3
👏👏👏👍👍👍🙏🙏🙏👱‍♀️🤰🤰🤱🤱🤱🎈🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎁🎁🎁🎁
This is gonna be amazing !
I literally love her so much... she's so strong and brave! So excited! ❤
Congratulations on the baby!!!!

Hi
OMG YES SO EXCITED
Wow
This is just the sweetest💚 he really loves you. I have to say I wish someone would have told me then what I know now... all the hard moments and frustrating times we go through in pregnancy and raising up our little ones, someday those will be the best and fondest memories in our life. I would have never thought it in the moment.... But damn if it's not the truest thing ever spoken to me. Embrace the good and the bad💚I can tell you have a lot of love around you. When life feels heavy look at the tiny fingerprints you created in your tummy and know you can do anything💚 God Bless!
Thank you for sharing your journey and beautiful family with us ❤️
