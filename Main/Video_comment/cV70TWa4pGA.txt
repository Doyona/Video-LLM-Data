Why are American bridges being attacked as of April 2024?
#whypictures
This is the flimsiest story. This guy is a plant!!!   The car went in the air and a ball of fire.   So the car exploded in the air according to what he is saying. Nonsense.   Something else happened to promote a false flag
Such a informative video...
😮😮😮😮😮😮
So, it turns out to be Americans trying to attack the Canadian border? 🤷🏻‍♂️
These days reporters behave like total idiots. They try to put pressure on the witnesses and want to tell them what did not actually happen. They behave like mafia. Kudos to the man for staying cool.
If on,y the media covered gates and googles ties to Jeffrey Epstein like this incident..or the Ukrainian war failure.
Nice to hear an honest, accurate report than the msm l i e s .
From this eyewitness account I would like to know what happened. Was his car an electric car? Did the car malfunction? Did the man die suddenly just before the border? (You know where I'm going with the last one.)  Very sad for the lost of these 2 people's lives. So sad. 💔😭
Thanks to the witness
His memory is so good
I'm always impressed by how shitty professional news audio is lol
Suicide…marital problems
what if they dropped poison into that water
Operation Susannah 2.0 begins...
The voice of those reporters is so acute and annoying
Turns out the wealthy couple who were from Grand Island ny were driving a Bentley. hmmm wonder what year and model? there was a recall.  "2018-2021 Bentley Continental GT and Flying Spur recalled with risk of stuck accelerator A manufacturing fault could cause the accelerator to get stuck when engaged, according to the manufacturer.  "Bentley has recalled 400 examples of its Continental GT and Flying Spur, citing a potential fault with the accelerator assembly.  The affected vehicles are stamped Model Years 2018-2021.  The recall notice, lodged with the Department of Infrastructure, says: “Due to inconsistent fitment of the fuse box and the electrical harness the A-post lower trim can protrude into the cabin reducing clearance to the accelerator pedal. If the accelerator pedal is fully pressed whilst driving and is unable to return to its resting position, the vehicle will continue to accelerate, even when the driver's foot is removed from the accelerator pedal.  "This could increase the risk of losing vehicle control, potentially resulting in a collision and/or serious injury or death of vehicle occupants and other road users.""
Interesting what you can deduce from the video and a map. Where the car comes into view is at Punjabi Hut adjacent to a left turn lane onto Rainbow Blvd. You can see a left turning vehicle being passed. From there to the curb where the car launches is 300 feet, traveled in 1.5 seconds. So conservatively they were going 130 mph when they went airborne.
Seems like a straight-up guy ... Sounds like it was very acary.
For a moment I thought the flying Ford Anglia flew across the border
Believe in the lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved. God bless you  :)😊
I'm guessing drunk driving, coming from a casino, but who knows.
Guy is a Bruins fan….knows full well it was that kook Milan Lucic driving that car but won’t admit it.
So random and also scary
omg these questions are a headache just asked him to repeat himself 15 times
Blame Canada
Turns out it was a couple leaving a casino in a Bentley, running late to a Kiss Concert on the Canadian side, hit the customs building doing 100+ miles per hour and exploded. Idiots again.
Interviewer is a reel "Tool".
hi😮dd$$$x".7û
Great eye witness account. Clear, accurate and no embellishments. I've learnt so much more about what happened from this man, than from all the news reports.
Be a Model not singing💃
Turn towards us turn towards us!! Lol
This is why the United States needs a war time President and a war time Congress. The Knee Jerk reaction of shutting down 4 “points of entry” in to the United States on the busiest travel day because of a lack of border security. No one had any Reasonable Certainty what was going on.
The footage they released matches EXACTLY to what this witness described. Good for him for his honesty and not trying to blow this up ( no pun intended) beyond what it really was as other news reporters have been doing.
M.I.B agent walks in frame after mentioning police - 2:48
1-You shall have no other gods before me. 2-You shall not make any idols. 3-You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain. 4-Remember the Sabbath Day.    5-Honor your father and mother. 6-You shall not murder. 7-You shall not commit adultery. 8-You shall not steal. 9-You shall not lie. 10-You shall not covet.    You will have to face God on Judgement Day.He sees lust as adultery, “Whoever looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”(Matthew 5:28)   he sees hatred as murder,”Anyone who hates another brother or sister is a murderer, (1 John 3:15)   Will you go to Heaven or Hell?Here’s a quick test: Have you ever told a lie, stolen anything, used God’s name in vain, or hated someone?   James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.” If you have done any of those things,    God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day? God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross.Jesus took the punishment upon Himself,       “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)   Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus.

I believe this guy ... not at all.
First truth , like this man...Now we are getting Big Guns cover up...
Horses mating  Horses mating
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
When news uses old phones as equipment.
WOW... I swear this guy looks like Ray Epps.....  could be brothers.
He tells this story and reporters will say this man jumped out of the way as the car attempted to hit them and then busted into flames as it clipped a car and crashed through the fence.
Took days before info came out about the Kenosha Christmas parade driver because his ethnicity,  fb anti white post didn't fit their narrative
Officials have ruled out terrorists but they don't know what it is. How do they know its not terrorists then😂
Search Car fires involving magnesium  components. Things may seem very familiar.
Thanks to the witness!
Watch Hollywood Bones and Ashes.
The fence didn’t send him 20’ into the air, it was the curb and/ or a small hill... just sayin.... like the ‘fishtailing’ part tho🥴
Great witness. . .
A False Flag attempt!! Failed! Funny no cameras caught this car. 😂joke!
Wrong border!
A Bentley or a Chrysler 300 can carry a lot of explosives. In my Chrysler 300 you could fit 4 bodies in the trunk.
This eye witness said the car was going to Canada!! WTF!!
Driver allegedly got really effin mad he spent so much money on a Bentley and people still thought it was a Chrysler 300.  Wife was just along for the ride.
"Elevated up"
Interviewer sounds like he has no sense of making a connection. Such brainless interview.
If i was this dude, i would have just  walked away when the reporters begin telling me what to do with my body as i am explaing what happened. I would be like "Listen you idiots, i saw this happened, and if youre going to be like that, I wont share what i saw." (Turn towards us...screw you...turn towards me if you want the story.)
Canada needs to build a wall to keep the Americans out!
Depending on what you say, yes You can get yanked off of this media platform.
“Incredible”
He experienced a big trauma event.
🤔,, remember Anne Heche ,, how her car was speeding ,, like it was out of her control ,,,, I wonder,, IF it's possible that this also happened here ...
What a stupid tv reporter
Not a TA, just Ferris Buellier
this title is nuts
"it looked like a Chrysler 300 but somebody told me it was a Bentley but they're similar cars". Bwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahagag.   They both have 4 wheels I guess.
FOX said it was a terrorist attack of course
They didn't ask him what color the car was.
Ferris Buelliers Day Off II😷
Dude looks like a fed
Sad for the loss of lives.  Does anyone know who was inside the car
WELL DID YOU HAVE BREAKFEAST FIRST LOL AND WHAT DID YOU HAVE LOL TO THEY WORK FOR CNN LOL
DID YOU SEE THE PERSON LICEN PLATE LOL LOL  LOL
REPORTERS IS DUMB
When the guy doing the interview dont know how to listen 😂  Remember people bidens administration wanted an open border policy.
Now he is working as a reporter ig, lmao
There's more to this than the narrative makers want anyone to know if they don't tell us the names of both occupants inside the vehicle and where they were from.
Electric “Smart” Bentley vehicle goes rogue and explodes into US/Canadian Bridge… was it hacked???
Sounds like a suicide.....police should look into how much they gambled before this happened...Casino is like 2 blocks from bridge entrance....Does public realize how many suicides are hidden about Seneca gamblers.... Something casino likes to Keep quiet...My gut tells me they gambled too much and anger came out on ride out of casino
Reporters so untrustworthy the ppl  witnessing I trust
Of course we believe
the FBI Special Agent-In-Charge and the Governor of New York just announced that the couple were heading to Canada to exchange money. So it's finally confirmed that the car was from the States.
Canadian?
One helluva thing to witness, shocked but well spoken dude and his wife have a lot to unpack, and buy some lottery tickets.
Kathy bogus has the nerve to say this wasn’t a terror attack
He seems like a sweetheart
Conspiracy Theorist: “It looks like a terrorist attack. Cars just don’t explode into small pieces like that.”  Governor, hours later: “It was a planned terrorist attack.”  Have you noticed that the time between conspiracy theory and confirmed conspiracy are becoming shorter and shorter?  Well, one thing I suppose we can be sure of is that it didn’t involve the religion of peace.
The reporters are a bunch idiots
SURELY THIS WAS A ACCIDENT, MECHANICAL FAILURE FOR SURE..
Trudeau was caught leaving the scene I heard. 1:26
That Damm Foxx news reporting it as a Terrorists attack unreal that's false
pay me asshole! and ill tell you story.
The car bottom was torn right off after going by car it appear it hit a hi curve because it was air born going over 80 in the air so it would be ingolfed in flames after hard impact....
Good man, obviously not a confused Liberal
They were on the way to see the Kiss concert at Ottawa which got cancelled. They had just finished playing in Senaca casino.
What was the name of the driver
Pweaze, tell me da story again about da fwying car, da fence and da fire baw.
Everyone at first genuinely thought it was an attack, until half of the internet kept looking into it, and it just seemed more like the craziest accident that nobody expected to be as violent
I would watch this man telling story, to tell story all the time lol
Just a routine accident with a car filled with explosives? No.  You would never  blame a terrorist for any act of evil!  Probably just taking a over cooked turkey to mom and dads and it blew up while car was mid flight into a border crossing.
So that reporter should have that all turned around by the time he reports it because he asked the guy three or four times and the guy told the same story.
If that was a Bentley as he described,thats a big car with a big gas tank,it probably blew up when it hit the building once airborn.
Did you hear any voices from the car? Something like  "All ahu Ak bar."
oh, my god. can you people seriously grow up? its the reporter's job to FIND THIS GUY, not be the one telling you what's happening
This will be taken down soon.. .bet
These reporters are dickheads
Probably never hear from this dude again
*And the audio mutes to ZERO after **0:13** because ???* (I have reloaded this several times)
These reporters are obnoxious
Disgraceful and disgusting how reporters try to make this man sound like he's not being truthful. How many times do you need him to repeat the incident? Give him a break. Might want to start at the nearby building surveillance cameras and show actual footage.
This is why western nations should have never got involved in the problems of those middle east nations.  Now these failed governments have adopted an enemy that's going to be a thorn in the side of the world forever!
I wonder if the car got droned.
I only believe the witnesses.  Not a word from MS media.
It was a Canadian citizen fleeing the carbon tax, but got confused by Myorkas' border policy.
And the terrorist attacks begin. Nice job Biden.
Reporters asked really dumb questions
No explosion.  The gasoline tank was ripped open.
Terrorist attack, one hundred percent. Its gonna get alot worse real soon. Remember people, our border has been open for our enemies to come right in. Thanks to obama and joe biden... Damn devils....
Classic Canadian bruins fan
The reporter is an idiot!
Omg, rude reporters with unnecessary questions, open your ears reporter, Have a wonderful thanksgiving sir, and thank you sir for the info🫶🙏✌️ Damn 20 questions dude 🤐
So it wasn't a terrorist attack
There’s a 0% chance it was a Bentley
Awesome Job Witness!  However, let's get you a new hat.  A Toronto Maple Leafs one.....
Possible malfunctioning EV vehicle ...hear stories of cars suddenly accelerating fast on their own & the driver aren't able to stop or even shut the car off.
Fear factor at work here.They want you to be afraid to travel. Not going to work with people that have common sense. Nice try though.
I want to know how WBEN went from "2 people intentionally blew themselves up" to the current narrative. That's a huge discrepancy!
Holy crap I understand the guy the first time. Reporter is a tool. Making him repeat the story and over and over. Get the earwax outta your ear and listen. Give the witness his job.
Man, the wording of the title made me think the actual waterfall exploded at the rainbow bridge.
The road looks really wet. If that person was speeding and maybe was under the influence, that would explain why the car fishtailed and this whole thing happened. Maybe there was a lot of alcohol in the car or a gas container. Those can explode from impact as described by many firefighters who have seen such incidents. Another thing to consider is there was a passenger in the car. This could have been a homicide/suicide. Why do I think so? I've been in potential situations like that myself in a vehicle being driven by an abusive ex-spouse, that's why. A lot of such incidents happen on/around holidays.
3:24   From the video that I have seen, showing the vehicle hitting the fence (and/or concrete abutment?) and going airborne, there was no fire from the car prior to it impacting whatever it did and exploding into flames.
Great witness reporting !!  This really shows how bad main stream media is worthless !!!!
This reporter sounds so annoying
Wow, your account of the incident is as vivid as it's hair-raising! I can't believe how observant you were amidst an event so chaotic and shocking. Thanks for giving such a clear, detailed description. I hope you and your wife are doing well after witnessing something so intense.
I'm truly surprised that NBC is even reporting this! Does anybody know if NBC actually got "PERMISSION" from the Biden Administration to interview someone telling the truth?
this guy is an outstanding citizen  thank you for being helpful
You turn the camera towards me and no, I’m not repeating myself - me absolutely.   They sound like trial lawyers not reporters.
This the only channel who always say whay really going to happen. 💯 on the contents.
First 400 mph lies who was driving John force gtx car  dragster😂😂😂😂
Evidently those reporters don’t listen to the word the man is saying. Like they can’t comprehend race, saying it blows my mind how many times they ask him the same question over is like are you not listening?🤪
"Have you ever seen anything like this before?" Always that type of question!  No, no, this is a quiet country, with no mass killings in schools, bomb threats, nuclear tests, civil wars or anything of that nature.  My own first thought on seeing the headlines of course (as I am cool to the zeitgeist) was that it was an EV, doing what EVs seemingly do.
Hey reporters, “Can you hear the words that are coming out of my mouth?”
Glad this is recorded..everyone save this news clip.. there is already so much mis information about this..
Cringey reporters. Witness did a great job
This guy has a Master's degree in witnessing accidents.
Obnoxious reporter handled like a real gentleman. Hire this man!
Cool hat.
The car is still smoking and they confirm exactly what it's not. Sounds like if there was a straight path we would be in mourning for some toll booth collectors.
Best witness ever , top marks , so refreshing
😂 turn towards us while pointing his mic 🤦🏾‍♀️
Because I believe this guy, more than the MSM, a question come to mind. Would a crash and explosion because of gasoline, completely destroy the car into little pieces? I've seen the pictures at the scene. It sure doesn't look like a gas explosion to me. It looks to me like the fire started because of the crash, followed seconds later by an explosion.
Was the car an EV? We know those batteries can blow.
What does 100 mph look like?
Well, I woke up to get me a cold pop, and then I thought somebody was barbequing.  I said 'Oh lord Jesus it's a fire!'.  Then I ran out, I didn't grab no shoes or nothin' Jesus, I ran for my life!
Bruiiinnnnnnnsssss
But it was not alarm purpose
FALSE FLAG FALSE FLAG FALSE FLAG
And the FBI says no terrorist  attacks  . BS Who the hell drives around  with  explosives in their car or Truck . How damn stupid  do they think we are . Beware America  it's  happening  . Thank you Joe !!!😢
We  know  for certian that   we dont know  anything and will tell u  every thing known when we finish  finding out what we make up like the fake video dems made to lie a bout ben gazie znd the  non terror gejadie  attack on the  U.S  EMBASSY IN LYBIA THAT KILLED AMERICANS AND OBOMA AND HILLARY ,BIDEN  , LIED TO ALL OF US FOR MONTHS AND THE DEAD FAMILIES ..  SAME HERE.......
Joe Biden and democrats trying to get us into a war thats what it is all about. They want to fake terrorists attacks so they can create a reason to go to war and invoke a war act to prevent Trump from being elected!!!!!
A Broons fan in Sabres country 👍
A Bentley...😢   See no rudeness, just effective, albeit a tad obnoxious, reporting.
Play stupid games and you win stupid prizes
Please EVERYBODY plea the Blood of Jesus Christ over your life before leaving and arriving home. I also want to say Jesus Christ is coming back so soon, will you be Left Behind or will you escape God's wrath to come? REPENT of your SINS and stop SINNING, live for Jesus Christ, admit that you are a Sinner in need of a Savior and that SAVIOR is JESUS CHRIST. Put your Faith and Trust in Jesus Christ, JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU and HE DIED for you on the cross, for your Past, Present and Future Sins, was buried and rose again according to Scripture. We are SAVED by GRACE through FAITH in CHRIST ALONE, not of Ourselves, not of works shall any man boast. For God gave his only BEGOTTEN SON that WHOEVER BELIEVES in HIM shall not PERISH but have EVERLASTING LIFE. JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON! REPENT and TURN AWAY from SIN.
Appears to be a mostly peaceful car bomb.
Good eyewitness report. Likely drunk guys coming from casino launch and crash their car at high speed causing it to explode, and GOP dumpsters went wild with fear-mongering. Ted Cruz posts this was a terrorist attack, lots of other GOP also spreading similar false stories. The Faux news itself had story about Iranian passport being found, and confirmation of terror attack that was apparently a car crash. Guaranteed the tin foil hats will cry cover-up, not one GOP dumpster, or Faux employee will apologize or retract their statements.
Could it have been a lithium battery pack that exploded
How did a surveillance camera track and follow that? It also doesn’t make sense that it would fishtail and hit the curb on at least two points and still go airborne that far. That’s a lot of lift. Hmmm…
my 🔥
So other news agencies are giving a different story about the direction of the car.  I doubt the police will call him, they'll just make up their own story about what happened and spin it into something else
There have been instances where EVs go out of control at high speed..driver has no control over this ..maybe this was the case here? However the resulting fire would have been very high temperature and would not have been able to put it out ..hope investigators find the cause of this tragic accident ..
A Bentley if it was a Bentley that's probably not a terrorist attack but if it is they choose the wrong vehicle. Nevertheless it is still disturbing
Wow that is horrible.  We have human trafficking, illegals or drugs going 100 mph THREW OUR TOWNS at least 5 a day.  We don't have the explosions but AMERICANS have been killed in Southern AZ.
Like most all reporters today this one SUCKED! Kudos to the witness who stated facts consciously and clear.
I was probably two Americans trying to escape the Hell that has become Joe Bidens America
So the car was trying to leave NY to go to Canada? Interesting.  I'm happy no bystanders got hurt and nothing serious for the Border personnel.. That's a new twist to suicide by cop.
Yet ALL the MSM news outlets SWEAR this was not a terrorist attempt.
HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY FBI IT WAS NOT A CASE OF TERRORISM.  A vehicle had crashed after driving at a high rate of speed and burst into flames
For ALL traveling this  dreaded season: BE ALERT, Listen and be  Vigil.  Avoid travel IF possible.
Thanks for being a great witness to what u saw, we need more people like you  around.. WOW  great job!!!
That guy was brilliant at describing what happened concisely and calmly.  He even recognized the car make and model.  Impressive.   o
Fox News is still reporting it as a terrorism incident
This was a wealthy man driving a $300K Bentley who was upset that a Kiss concert was cancelled so he snapped and crashed his car killing himself and his wife.
*A REAL DOOZY !*  *IM GUESSING BY WHAT IVE READ IT WAS RIGHT WING EXTREMISTS UNDER CONTROL OF CHUMP... THE BIGGEST THREAT THE USA FACES TODAY AS A NATION IS FROM THE THREAT WITHIN: CHUMP SUPPORTERS*
At this point, this is just a really shitty accident. Imagine how horrible that was for the folks in the car.
Keep your drama over there, America.
Newsflash >> Everyone can cool their jets about a terrorist attack. This Canadian from Ontario, CORRECTLY described the car as a possible Bentley, {which it was, worth $300,000). The 2 people in the car who died, husband and wife, (in their 50's) were going from the US to Canada, to a KISS concert in Toronto, but they didn't know it had been cancelled, because Paul Stanley has the flu.  All your conspiracy theory bubblies, have just been BUSTED.
WHERE'S THE SOUND.?....IDIOTS
What fence?
Which era was this? They have flying cars?
National reporting an Iranian Passport was found on site... Terrorist attacked foiled!
Wow how many times does the guy have to repeat the same story, did the reporters not understand the 1st 3 times. The guy described it perfectly clear. I'd have lost my patience.
The driver 56M was upset that the kiss concert was canceled. He was driving his 300k bentley in a roadrage manner due to his anger from the cancellation of the concert. The driver and his hot young wife were neutralized on impact, he was wearing his kiss tshirt when he was cremated. The fire was worthy of anything the kuss roadies could ever put together. The kiss band nodded in appreciation at the fallen kiss army fan.
Clearly this man loves the Boston Bruins!
I would have stopped talking to these idiots the second they started waving the microphone at me demanding I turn back around. But yes this gentleman did a great job recounting the event.
Electric car explosion
another MAGAt goon proving Darwin was right.
This reporter is very annoying.
He did it!
Canadian terrorist expats from middle east. Stay away from crowds this holiday season. More stuff might happen watch  government try and cover it up to reduce panic.
Turn towards us, oh boy
Thanks for your report. Go Bruins.
The first reports were of an explosion, but the true headline should have been: "Vehicle going over 100mph, explodes upon impact with US/Canada x-ing."  If the news channels need a more competent writer, let me know, I would be happy to help.
WARNING: *"russia’s ‘TROLL FACTORY’ impersonates Americans to sow political chaos."* (PBS)  - check it out on Google!
Bet they were screaming allah akbar 😂😂
Sounds like divine intervention it could have been a lot worse.... It sounds to me like intentional but who are these 2 men?
Murder/suicide?
Haha😂..and they are saying it was just an accident
I'm only gonna say it once so listen up news dicks
NBC News just reported that it was a Buffalo area businessman and his wife, who had just left a casino and were heading to Toronto. So... domestic argument, heart attack, gas pedal stuck? Meanwhile all the idiots on here going off about nothing.
Apparently it's all okay though. A great New York Governor Buffalo Betty said it wasn't terrorism
😮😮😮
There was fire yes but it was from the crash, there was no explosion from like say a **mb
B😢😢😢😢
CIA did it
All people trying to hurt USA  are starting to show themselves  We need better leadership and real support from within ❤
Aloha Snack Bar
It could have been immigrants stealing a car..... Not driver license...no identification....
This guy described everything of importance that he knew in the first 30 seconds of questioning, then through ineptitude, the reporters somehow managed to stretch things out for almost 5 whole minutes by just asking the same questions over and over again. Folks, you CAN just turn and walk away.
Why does the audio randomly change from right to left?
The disgusting media is trying to make it something that it’s not.
So basically there was a car driving at high speed that lost control on a wet road! Thank you honest man of the day!  So maybe later will get the facts of what was in car instead of jumping to conclusions!
So car was heading to a Canada from US,not the other way around.
Things happen so fast to look at how many passengers were in the car and obviously ambulances attend accident scenes. Dear Report please stop 🛑
The fence that's not there anymore.
Amazing eye witness. Thank you Sir.
This man took the the video game Burnout 3 too seriously 😂😂
who let Henry Ruggs out to drive?
Dr. Emmett Brown, AKA Doc in Back to the Future"  "If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious sh*t."
No explosion.... nobody said it exploded. It was obv was a large car wreck. stop clickbait with the word explosion. This is why people don't believe the media.
Lord Have Mercy Jesus 😮My Prayers and Condolences too the family During this Difficult time 🙏🏽❤
Sadl sad.  I was born and lived in Niagara falls and we went across the rainbow bridge all the time and I'm just stunned.
Very good attention to detail from this man on what happened here.
this guy should replace the moron reporter
The official surveilance video and post photos clearly show this was an explosion (bomb) with it's objective to kill civilians.  The terrorist dumba...exploded too soon.
Pub artist who misused technology and abuse corpse or methodical used a self driving car to get away with pre mediately homicide!  The car was going from USA to CANADA * people swim that far daily *
Runaway E  V - almost guaranteed. Regular cars don't just burst into flames.
You can thank Biden and his traitors of the Democratic party for this. You like open borders, this is just the begining.
And all those stupid racists who asked to close the mexican border ,  must be feeling like  a Clown now.   LOL.
It looks like a Nassan Altima
Jeez this man is asking too many questions.
Maybe an out of control car accident?????
Maybe there was an issue with the motor
Elderly couple experiencing a medical emergency.
Only person I’ve seen say it was headed to Canada
Nothing to see here folks... The government and news media is saying there is no evidence that this could have been a Terrorism incident. Hmmm, speeding car attacking border checkpoint with huge explosion. No terrorism... BS. Biden, you let them in, we have to pay the price.
Seems like the gas pedal got stuck down. Or the driver was trying to do suicide to/with the passenger. It's not at all plausible someone would do terrorism in a Bentley.
The news and media need to learn how to ask questions. This interview is for kindergartners. Wow 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
what a great witness... rare
But he didn't explain how Trump instigated this...I'm sure CNN and the White House will explain this to us.
terrorists were Biden supporters
I thought the driver was going into the US not canada.
What was the point we can't hear it
Lol nothing to see my god the drama and this is what the news wants fear fear!
I would have walked away after explaining myself the second time.  Pay me$$$
someone buy this guy a beer
Just a good old boys Never meanin' no harm Beats all you never saw Been in trouble with the law since the day they was born Straightening the curves, yeah Flattenin' the hills Someday the mountain might get 'em, but the law never will
EV's batteries explode when breached if someone has been racing it. Not if it's leaving the US. Can't see terrorists in the US going to Canada to make the US pay.
Another EV blew up.
This guy is a local mechanic and will tell you every problem about your car. He an honest guy
Sounds like a Pinto got rear ended.
Trump terrorist pissed off it's called "Rainbow Bridge."
All these cops borders closed fbi involved for a car accident that was speeding and crash then it exploded it probably had a full tank of gas that just blew on impact what am i missing here for all the law enforcement to be present and borders closed its not just the rainbow Bridge that they shut down what is going on
MSNBC'S report corroborates this man's story, and they have footage of the car flying. Just ignore the anchor using "tiktok" as a verb, everything else in the report is pretty straightforward,  not sensationalized.
So it was a car accident not a terrorist attack...bad news for the mainstream drama peddlers
President Biden has been briefed and immediately freed up more Iranian funds.
Hey rude reporter, stop being mean to this sweet man! 😠 😡
So a car chase then
Wtf ?
This reporter is an idjit, man, what horrible drag out.
Brace yourselves for the giant cover-up. No way the current administration will admit that this might have been caused by our completely open southern border.
Terrorizing!!
I love tomatoes and there is no way I cut them out of my diet.
A key  eye witness, and the fbi didnt detain him,? Wtf
This is terrible .. we MUST raise taxes immediately to resolve terrorism
Ev battery explosion perhaps.......
I was thinking it was a vbied but sounds like just a mental midget driving like a psychopath
Reporter asking the dumbest same questions 🤦🏻‍♂️
Drunk drivers and holiday time
The gentleman was great eye witness better than other reporter said the car came from Canada.
Man. Reporters need more manners.
And this is terror related how? I smell bull crap.
how can you believe a guy wearing a Bruins hat in Buffalo?
Whys ot a he?
What a crappy news crew.
These reporters are dinks
In essence it dwarfed a Hollywood Blockbuster.
People in this world have lost there shit
Was going into Canada so I highly doubt this was a terror attack. I think everyone jumped the gun but we will see.
This man is salt to the earth! I'm happy to see they continue to exist in USA! ❤❤❤
Shut down all the borders to the US immediately ban flights from countries that want to destroy the United States
The car was at the casino for while before it crashed
I wonder why the car's driver raced towards the border station at such a high speed  -- with a passenger?
$000ooo i$ thi$ gonna be another one of those thing$ where. Although THAT BORDER ha$ camera$.... EVERYWHERE.....we won't get too $ee a $econd of the footage for........ MONTH$.....? If ever?
The NY Governor gives a presser before law enforcement?
my man, you can get hurt around here just wearing that hat.....GO Bills
So it’s now been categorized as a “terrorist attack” but this witness is describing an out of control driver who crashed. Maybe it was a DUI driver who thankfully didn’t kill or hurt anyone else?   Great witness account and just a really honest believable person.
Glad these witnesses are okay.   Just out walking and wowsers.😮😢
Some news outlets are already trying to say it was a terrorist. The way this man is describing it, it just sounds like a crazy driver.
Wish our government would stop lying to us. Everyone knows what this is
Video surveillance was just released rawalerts on x
probably more info there than you get from Governor HorrorShow or the FBI
It was some Brandon voters hauling a to get out of America before Trump wins for the third time. 😂😅😢😢😢😢
CNN lies and says the vehicle came from the Canadian side.
GoBruins.
MAGA so quick to blame an immigrant with a bomb . SMH!
Could be FF!! Hollywood special effects A car going 100 mph how can you tell what kind it was. Sketchy!!! The reporters telling him what to say. Again Sketchy!!
Well Trump did warn the American people that this was going to happen under Joe Obama administration
Sounds like an accident and the gas tank just exploded. So is wasn't a planned attack?
Finaly some truth, us media says its not terrorists, but canada is closing all border bridges? Us say no explosives found, well of course not the all exploded on impact! Crazy
This man should teach reporters how to report
I bet it was a bunch of gays fleeing to America
this guy never watched dukes of hazard  they used to do that all the time..
Could a car explode like that?
Gotta be a terrorist, right?  Insane how everybody starts yelling "Terrorist!"  The number of times terrorists attacked Canada or the U.S. from either country is so immense that I can't even begin to name them (in fact, I can't name one).  All of this hype to find out in the end that it will be an old couple that had their foot stuck on the accelerator.  Most cars explode when hitting a concrete barrier at 100 mph.
He may end up missing if the gov wants this covered up.
Fireball? Bomb?
This reporter is an idiot!  Does NOT know how to interview!
Thanks to dems for total disaster
Americas radicalized right wing MAGAts are now targeting Canadian Socialists
False flag for more government tyranny.
Great eyewitness reporting,  The witness was precise, fresh, calm, said exactly what he saw. He had a good sense of how fast the car was going, and what type it might have been. Doesn't sound nefarious, probably just a stolen vehicle, with idiots trying to ship it overseas.
Aye...tell that lamo reporter to "take off you hoser!" Aye, get lost!
Save this before it... he... disappears.
That doesn’t sound like there was a bomb. He would’ve set off the bomb after getting into a better position but what do I know. I’m just speculating. Waiting to hear what the fbi says.
Probably another car malfunction!!! If it was a terror attack why did he swerve to avoid the other car? Keep an open mind peeps.
So this wasn't a car bomb after all?  If you rely soley on what the "News" networks are saying, you'd think that it was a terrorist attack.
Do you know their names?
The difference between Chrysler and a Bentley is about 100k!
This will be idiots who were protesting for Palestine. Guaranteed
His story against media speculation is hilarious. 😂 Do better. 💯
lithium battery fire from an EV
Story will Disappear .... CarJacker Idiots
Let's all say something STUPID IN HERE. TERRORISTS DO NOT KILL THEMSELVES AND NO ONE ELSE.!!! WTF....WAKE UP!🤪 STOP SPREADING FALSE INFO....That's CNN's job.
Going 160km/h crossing the border? What was that guy on to go that fast jesus
US's meddling!! People are angry and look at the crazy stuff they're doing to protest.
Hey Biden tell Obama he ordered all the terrorists into the USA to commit terror.  Looks like the terrorists are coming for Obama now.  But they blew themselves up first.
We The People...Demand borders be closed immediately!
So this  was accent not a terriers attack… I bet now they are going to twist this around ….
They were trying to blame Canada but it's clearly that the car was coming from the USA
Made a movie about that years ago, that one was a false flag
Won’t be the last of these attempts. Stay vigilant. 😢
Cameraman should have told reporter to turn around, so we can see someone fail reporting!😟
i know this border every inch of it.  This is NIAGARA Street heading west 2 blocks east of the bridge.  The car was travelling westbound and drove into the EXIT and secondary inspection as you are cleared from the first booths.  The fence is the EXIT fence and the car hit it and then blew up in the area between the primary booths (black ones) and secondary booths (white ones).  This was not at the toll booths back to the right to Canada.  This was an intentional act to hit the guards from behind.
We have top of the line CCTV cameras spying on us but our cameras at the border are crap
Hoser Level: Beauty, eh!   It's interesting how they posted the raw footage. The reason it's so repetitive is because they're interviewing for sound bites to edit together for the new report. If the subject says something interesting, you prompt them to tell that part of the story again in detail. Or if he slurs, or coughs, or rambles, or goes off-mic, you can get a clean take of an important segment.
Uh yea... mr. Lame reporter...we usually read a cars plates and and count passengers at 100+mph whizzin by us.. thanks for that awesome question!🤪
So no terrorism. It was reckless driving. We need to encourage the media to slow down and quit the fast reporting.
Islam
Go Brandon
So it wasn't a terrorist attack... I'm sure Biden and his handlers are going "Well crap. We could have used that to keep the American people on edge until we "won" the next election.
It is just an accident but the Media is going to spin it around for a while for fear-mongering.  They will try to use it to quell the pro Palestinian demonstrations.
For them to come in
Hamas are here in America also Iran fighters, No border wall  open for the to come in any time they want
POLICE/FBI HV NO INTEREST IN SPEAKING WITH WITNESSES....DOESNT FIT THE TERRORIST NARRATIVE
I give this guy a ton of credit for staying so cool. These reporters were being obnoxious as hell towards the beginning.
Bill Murray was there!
My god bless you USA America and Canada 😂
So there was no explosion and it is not a bomb threat that these idiot reporters are trying to make it out to be. Gas tank exploded in the crash.
Did he say it looked like a Bentley ? Could of been a Chrysler 300 also.
*Speed Kills again*
Did he say it was a Chrysler 300 or a Bentley as the two cars are very similar. Sure, only about $300 grand difference between them.
I think it was Joe Biden who was test driving a new presidential limousine but of course old Joe got confused between the gas pedal and brake pedal.
Keep this video folks.  The news will change the information again
I wonder if it could be a mechanical problem that caused it?
Joyride in one of those new EVs, they sure go fast and go out with a bang.
Interesting, the news I see on TV say the car came from the Canadian side approaching the US...eye witness reports are important
i lheard  people whisper and rumors..... Thanks to religion of "Piece"
Dumb "journalists" ask for and get a quite good witness report of a single event. Not good enough. Back to the start. "Did you see what happened" type question. Again and again and again. Did the police come? Did the ambulances come? Good grief.
CLOSE THE BOARDERS!!
Why were they going so fast? There's nothing that good in Canada 🤔
He explain better than all reporters..
Very honest witness, shame the journos are so thick.
Thank you Sir, Great job explaining what happened, clear and concise.
this chat was not worth publishing as is, should have been shortened. first minute ok, the rest was just repetition.
Apparently he is undercovr FBI , conspiracy , go time...  Joe Biden's body double was in the car , with JFK jr... Sounds bat s**t crazy possible / probable ...
BREAKING NEWS…. The car was coming from America going towards Canada . AMERICAN MEDIA FIRST OBJECTIVE IS TO GEY YOU TO SHIT YOUR PANTS
This seems rehearsed. PSYOP
Paid this man his a great witness 😂❤reporter is rude ..
Just a car accident Zionists making it big
😮😮😮😮
Oh oh
God gosh
This is what happens when you don’t have a script to read.
A Bentley?  Hmmmmm
Terror attack*
What a shitty reporter LOL did you see weapons did you see ,,,,,,,,, fckn douche bag
Hmmm wonder if Driver passed out, or trying to commit Suicide, lost control?? Doesn't sound like a terrorist attack like some channels are assuming
it was a Bentley???
They all want to hear is a terrorism attack to use as an excuse and go to war with Iran! It looks more like a car accident!
So there was no bomb, no terrorist attack, just someone traveling at a very high speed that crashed igniting the fuel tank causing the massive fire, how quickly things get blown out of proportion to the actual facts.
Fausses informations
Fox news already claimed it was a terrorist attack and explosives were found in the car. They are bad journalists who like to manipulate and misinform their already paranoid viewers
Reports say 2 died and one injured.
Are they not showing a video of the event because it will show there wasn't an explosion?
Could be Some American 🇺🇸 dude lost a fortune at Niagara casino and came back for a revenge? 😎
Thank you sir. For an honest truth.  Before box office media spin the story.
Magic mushrooms and motor vehicles don't mix. This is not a terrorist attack it's a full tank of gasoline
Why is this eye witness the only source of information.... All your flinches  please stop calling it a terrorist attack
I did not read the word "explosion" in the statement given by the witness ( I use closed captions).
The reporter needs to be sacked! The man who described the situation, told what happened so well that don't need to be repeated! My word! Brilliant man with his description. That reporter, NO!
Somebody please put this man in charge of news reporting.  Clear, concise,  transparent, elaborated the details to let the audience have a visual, and no fluff,  spin, ir agenda.
This reporter needs a new career
The eyewitness does not say there was an explosion in his initial statement.
Sounds like Drake
Big bang theory
Sounds like Jesus took the wheel 🙏
Everything is super accurate about this man’s account except a Chrysler 300 and Bentley are not similar cars Lool
Pride explosion 💥  🌈🌈
So.. "apparently " it was just a wreck and the gas tank ruptured.. not a terrorists attack.  Media get it right and stop fishing for bullshit
"Turn towards us" says the trash media goons. Don't tell what to do when you lie to us daily. He can turn how he wants to turn.
The terrorist group's guiding philosophy is detailed in "The Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement" which was adpoted on August 18, 1988.  It says that the duty of every Muslim is "Jihad", that "there is no solution to the Palestinian question except through Jihad", and says "the Jews will not be pleased with thee, neither the Christians," until they follow the ways of Hamas.   The Palestinian "civilians" are complicit in these acts of terror. They are well aware of Hamas philosophy and yet keep voting them in power. You peace loving Muslims need to take a stand against Hamas and the Palestinian people. They are not innocent.
Just another fear tactic from our government to make us fear enough to give up our god given constitutional rights like they did with the patriot act!
Bidenomics refugee?
Joe Biden's open border policies will damage the USA and Canada for many decades to come! Wake up America and vote that incompetent clown out of office!
Thanks to the witness! Great job
Was this the terrorist threat they were warning about today in New York?
These reporters are stupid pls stop trying to get more out if this guy than he knows. He hit the fence went airborne and exploded is that not enough for you ? Well keep your eyes open this ain't the first and won't be the last, maybe you'll be lucky enough to be a part of the next one !
Think just another DWI nothing more.  He wouldn't be "...fish tailing down the road"
.#zZz#.⚡⬇️⬆️💀☢☣ЭКСПЕРЕМЕНТ - УДАЛСЯ💀💀💀💀💀💀⚡⚫⚫⚫⚫⚫💀💀💀💀💀💀⚡⚡⚡
Over 100mph -right because he is a radar gun.
Damn I live minutes from the bridge.
The border control agent was said to light up a fatboy on the fire ball after the crash. The East German judge deducted points for lack of a driver toe point. More news at 11.
Where's the fbi and DHS ? No FBI or DHS. What are the powers that be want us to focus on this as a distraction.  Look here, not over there.
Canada will start building a 40 feet steel border and I dont blame them 😡😡😡😡😡😡
Going to Canada?
Maybe gramps should shift those 83,000 new IRS agents to BORDER SECURITY
REPORTER: OK now we need you to describe it in a more menacing fashion and SHOW some grimace too!!!
So Joe Biden allowed this bs . With all the cameras all the phone spying all police Joe Biden could not find his ass hole with his finger what a looser let some more in keep the boaders open let’s go Brandon
Terrorists in a Bentley?
You mean the FBI is going to leave praying grannies alone?
Not the explosion the FBI planned out...they need to get their money back.  Dems will have to come up with another Red Flag.
Thank god this nice gentleman was there, if he wasn't they would say Muslims did that for sure!! save this video😉
This Man is a better and more honest than 99% of Reporters
Who’s lieing? This witness or all the news media? Was it going into Canada or coming from Canada?
Forbes and other outlets are calling people who are discussing this "conspiracy theorists."  That was not a normal car explosion.
Honnest man. Whatch the media put words in his mouth
Chrysler 300 loooool lmfao
The car that blew up was just a distraction too what was in the car in front but that guy who was the reporter was kinda rude to the guy doing the interview
Any One Who Tries To Coomitt Acts To Any Country You Will Caught & Charged & Jailed
Like a Hell Ridah.😣
Now the police need to interview the people in the car that the wrecked car passed before it crashed.
My humble opinion I would look for what was going on at the exact same time. The hand is quicker than the eye scenario.
Must have been a guy that lost all his money at the casino lol We can know this is not normal It'll be interesting to see what lies are made by officials
This guy is a great witness!
Elon Musk is crapping his pants as we Speak!?!
A Bently and a Chrysler 300 are defiantly not similar. The media is going to hold back information to protect their masters.
Driver was probably just going nuts or whatever launched the car into the air tore the fuel tank open. Sometimes the impact of a car hitting something can sound like a small bomb going off. A guy turned left into me with a small pickup I was riding a motorcycle and when I hit the side of the truck box it was really lowd as I was flying through the air I wonder if I was knocked out or dead just sort of dreaming or something because I just felt calm and not any pain and just thought it wasn't real because of the noise. The truck needed to be towed because it separated the drive shaft and broke the passenger side of the rear axle loose from the chassis except for the rear spring shackle and the brake line.
Failed false flag
Good thing there was a fence
Close the borders.
Release video footage of the explosion. Thanks.
So this guy, who witnessed it, says the car was IN the U.S. going TOWARDS Canada.  Other news sources are saying  the car was headed towards the U.S. FROM Canada.   ?????
Hope America and the whole world understands who to defend and who not to. WAKE UP.
Hey WGRZ-TV get some working equipment if you're going to do some reporting.
Witness needs to be a reporter, very clear on what happened, appreciate the info!
The RAINBOW Bridge?? That is sending a big message.
Probably a car from Quebec. I've seen two of them burst into flames during the F1 weekend in Montreal.
This reporter is an amateur.
Doofus questions geez
What a douchebag reporter.
Sounds like a stuck throttle, swerved, impacted and burst into flames. All the debris suggests the vehicle disintegrating, IMO....  Maybe this wasn't any kind of malicious act?
Based on this witness it doesn't sound like TERRORISM GGOOOODD
The news doesn't like eye witnesses.
The person did not really describe an explosion.
It's probably a crysler 300
What an idiot of a reporter..
The media guy is a stupid man
Thank God for this witness.  The US governmetn and media are trying to spin this thing to high heaven.
Fire the interviewer, and give this guy his job!
Praying nobody is hurt and everything is ok.
The Chrysler 300 the poor girls Bentley
This witness sounds Canadian because he says “aboat”.
So news is reporting coming in to US and he say from US
Joe Biden and the demirats policy's 😂😂😂😂
gave us a lot more information than O.P.P.  did so far.
Now extra surcurity at the borders. Why don't know who is here illgeals
CANADA and US must prepare,. The Conflict in Israel will reach in the west and europe..
Well we do have open borders, so nobody should be surprised.
And SO IT BEGINS. ARM YOURSELVES AMERICA. THEY ARE HERE
Why is NBC reporting that the vehicle came from Canada when this witness says otherwise?
Won't say  terrorists attacking the 🇺🇸 😢
Let's build a wall and make Canada pay for it 😂
Thanks weak corrupt governor, weak corrupt president, and weak corrupt DOJ, amazing 🤮.
Well would you look at that 🤔 it wasn't the southern border 😂
Your News reporter sucks
Fbi false flag Fjb
Build the northern wall asap!
This is the first coverage that finally told me what direction the car was traveling.  3 different news agencies reports and I had no clue.... to include BBC.
This thumbnail implies it will show the vehicle in the footage and does not.
Hollywood is back. Thank God, it was getting really boring with wars in Eastern Europe and the middle east.
So glad these people are ok, and in good shape.
Just another reason to own a gun! U never know what can happen these days especially with no border and the flood of Muslims Obama let in.  Thank God for the right to bear arms
On its way OUT of the USA?  I knew things were rough down there... but slow down.  The election isn't for another year.
U can blame Biden and the democrats for no border control!  Blood 🩸 are on the democrats hands
So the people in this car just killed themselves.. they attacked themselves, doesn’t seem like a terrorist attack
Was the car electric? Maybe the driver was not in control
Can't watch Canadian news on CBC....the whole world except CBC knows these Terrorist attack details: Bomb filled car rammed toll both 2 suicide terrorists are dead border agent injured Iraqi passport found Looking for second car FBI warns stay away from NYCity fear Macy's Thanking Parade may beca target
Go DEFCON 1 ,good luck USA !😮
Hard to believe that this beauty Canadian is treated rudely by an American reporter. What are the odds?
MSNBC helps create this
Thank you, sir!
Seems like all the news reporters and govt officials need to listen to this guy. Clearly the vehicle was not directed to the secondary inspection area, it went airborne to the other side of the road where that inspection area is and smashed into it. There's even a nice ramp there in the median to go all Thelma & Louise off of. Chrysler 300 would probably explode on its own without any help.
Very interesting. The people in this world seem to be going mad. Everywhere we see inexplicable  behavior. Was this a suicide ?or a drunk. We live in a society that is run by people who display magical thinking  (a clinical mental illness symptom). Boys do not become girls just because you mutilated their genitals. Pedophilia is not just a sexual orientation. 2+2 does not equal 5. Not because of racism but because math is objective not subjective. The chemicals that the government  sprays on us might be causing this breakdown.
Who knew, with open-border policies, that a bunch of lunatic terrorists would invade our countries in order to destroy our freedom?
The Rainbow Bridge is the main route that connects Niagara Falls, N.Y. to Canada.  This bridge is not low lying, it spans over the Niagara River Gorge and is heavily traveled.  It's a very very long way down to the river. The Peace Bridge is the only other nearby bridge to cross into Canada, which is about a 20 min  drive from Rainbow Bridge.
Y'all looking for the wrong people! No life loving Muslim would do this! This had to have been two old white racist Trump supporters, they were maga Republicans!
Well, America is not sending her best.
This reporter is a complete jackass
Very good I witness account.. Condolences to the families who loss loved ones in this horrible crash.. Praying their strength and comfort in Jesus Mighty Name 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
LauraLoomer thinks this was a Palestinian car bomb. Really. She does. Called on the president to close US borders lol.
Sounds more like road rage than terrorism
Bruins fan A+++
Great account, more info than any other news report.
The media will blame on climate change ......too much co2 in the air made the driver to go wild. ...
This gentleman described it perfectly the first time. But why ask him to repeat it? Was the reporter expecting him to add made-up details to the story?
Well now, hey now. This is NOT the LSM story of it being asked to go to a secondary inspection and it just happened to crash.  TY TY TY Sir, for telling a story.
The reporter was very rude this nice guy!
And so it begins.
Wait. News says car was coming from Canada into thr USA.... this guy says the opposit.. .
Great witness, Great questions from the reporter. My concern is they want to redirect traffic to another bridge, making it a bigger target. Day before Thanksgiving, 11/22/23 I don't think it is a coincidence.
Heading towards Canada! Lock down the Canadian Borders.
The car blew up! But did you see any kind of license  plate?😂😂😂😂 what a moron! Props to the man reporting!❤❤
I just had a Terrible thought.  What if this is what happens to Electric cars when they crash.  😮
CNN Brynn  said they were coming from Canada int US  ??
Gaza health ministry confirmed 5,000 Palestinians died at the US-Canada border explosion.
Media will turn it around three times
Funny officials telling the public vehicle was coming FROM Canada so I’m going with our asylum state (NY) is not safe
Rude reporter!
Don't forget we only have 45000 troops in the middle east and two ships. AMERICA HAS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS
Give this MAN a JOURNALISM JOB... 😁👍👍  Way better then those Useless Lakies👎🙄🥱
Must be the Islamophobia the Biden administration keeps talking about.
Was Ray Epps seen talking to a guy in a Chrysler 300?
And just think our great President is on vacation like all the time
Set up
Reporter not nice
That was set up there trying to push marshal law pple are waken up
It's all over the news across America, so the FBI, ATF, Homeland security, Biden, the CIA, the military, are all focused and going crazy about a car blowing up with two dead on the northern border and NOW it's a national terrorist threat. Meanwhile, 10,000 illegal immigrants full of terrorists and ex prisoners and Communist Chinese and Syria and Iran and 186 other countries are walking across the southern border every single day via the cartel for over two years bringing in fentanyl and child exploitation and they are all silent about it. Shows you what this is really about. Where's the national news footage of THAT?! When are they going to close the SOUTHERN border like up there? They have 1,000 times the terrorists walking across but Mayorkas says the 1,200 mile long border is closed. It's not.
News is saying the car came from canada but if this guy is in the states and hes saying the car came up the road going towards the border...then..isnt it trying to go to canada from the US? This doesn't make any sense.
A hole reporter
got the jab turned into a torpedo from heart atttack
I like this guy, he has Joe Pera vibes
Imagine if the car missed the house obstruction part the guy was referring too and just jumped his car out over the cliff into the river. I can already hear the song now: "Just the good ole boys.....never meaning no harm......"  As Tommy Boy would say...."That would be awesome"
🤔🤔why wouldn't the cops take his statement and just get his number?
So the sound go out or .. ??
Welcome to Joe Bidens America. It's only going to get worse 😥
I THOUGHT I HEARD IT WAS COMING FROM CANADA INTO AMERICA??
Last week san fransico br idge
Strange that most mainstream media is saying that it was coming from Canada. I wonder what they're trying to do.
Doesn't sound like a bomb. Maybe a drunk driver?
You'd think we'd have the ability to have rapid law enforcement response to an incident at the border. 😉
wtf is up with the no audio? annoying
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
this eye witness says car was coming from US toward Canada and news is saying car was coming out of Canada. People this is importants facts to get right.
A lot of details.....
Wow, great reporting.  So, was he trying to hit the border border guards but instead got fenced?  They are cameras for sure all around that border, so it's on video. We will see it soon, I'm sure.
Something is not right  with this story.
Who is the reporter? Fire him and hire the old man
What if whoever those men were just planted some bombs somewhere here in the US and were headed back to Canada cause this man says they were headed towards Canada . So that means they were not coming INTO the US like some  News Stations are reporting. Sounds like they were LEAVING the US. But WHY did they still have so many explosives with them ?? All I know is we are living in very dangerous times and since BIDEM took office all hell broke loose EVERYWHERE !!!
Sounds like it was just the gas tank exploding. I could be wrong but I don't think it was  an act of terrorism .
This Terrorist Attack was Brought to you by Joe Biden's Open Boarders
All the official reporting says the car was going to opposite direction- from Canada into the US.  So which is it?
Vaccident and its gonna be named terrorist attack.
Does not seem to be terrorism. A terrorist would take out the border check point. Not speeding and hitting a building.
Six Seconds in Ramadi comes to mind...these bad actors always looking for a way to test both our American Cousins and our Canadian resolve. Now only if the Canadian Government would respond with vigilance rather than a wait and see approach. Speedy recovery to the CBPS Officers , Thank You for keeping us safe at home and abroad !!
Stuck gas pedal ,  ....
Bidens America
It will be blamed on Trump
Thank you Sir 🙏🏼 This is scary 😞😔😐
First Chandler now this! Something doesn't add up here?
doesnt sound like terrorists.
Save this video because it might be hard to find if authorities have any reason to alter the story
If car was traveling at speed towards US to explode at checkpoint then this guy should have been on Canadian side. He is on US side and clearly says car was going into Canada!!
God bless him
Sound like the people  in the car didn't  want to kill so many people
Hide that guy
Thanks sleepy Joe
i love how the reporters are just straight jerkoffs
The man says he was doing 100 mph The reporter says did you get the license plate on it😂😂😜
I can not believe this is happening. Four crossings have been closed in Ontario. Is terrorism coming into our country? 🇨🇦
I bet he was from jersey
did ya both poo yur pany's?
You need to be careful, dude. They might kill you because you're gonna tell them the truth. Looks like they're trying to make something out of this explosion.
Thanks for bad audio
0:38-- If you turn on Closed Captions he says "he was flying over a 100 miles an hour. There was a car in Ottawa."  The conspiracy nut jobs knows what that means😁😆
Buckle up folks. We know what this is and we can expect more.
So it's not terrorism you see don't jump to *conclusions*
So was it someone just speeding (or having some kind of episode and driving erratically) and the car caught fire because of the big crash or was it some kind of planned terrorist-y  thing?
Guy trying to get to canada for the black friday sale on meth.
I bet it was a 300 not a bently...
yet nationally its (terrorist attack from Canada) The evidence provided even without this video directly contradicts coming from Canada and blowing through a 2nd checkpoint. This was just a fast car losing control and ending at the bridge.
Why didn't the news camera pan in on the place where the car crashed?
Welcome to Biden's America. Joe recently sent Hamas one hundred million dollars.
Even the police made a statement that the car was going into the US.
screaming Allah Akbar all the way.
Driver screamed allahu akbar before he hit the fence
Good witness but your reporters are SHIT WGRZ. Wow they suck
It's coming people. This is test how American reactions.
LET’S GO BRUINS
So the car was in the US at all times? All the other lame street media and Drudge is reporting the opposite. Excellent reporting from WGRZ.
So basically everybody relax it was nothing more then a speeder having an accident. Pushing his vehicle beyond his driving abilities 💥💥
Why is WKBW channel 7 saying the car was coming from Canada and into the US?
Joe Biden is destroying America with open borders,  Hamas is coming across to America from open borders
God Bless North America…..Amen
Could you tell if all tyre pressures were the same and if the tread depth was equal on all tyres? Did the car have furry dice and if so what colour?
What a Stone Age here in Canada and the US -- no street cameras even at the border....to register events, so they need to ask around the village dogs what happened))  In Europe and Russia you have high tech cameras at every corner, plus every car has an in-built camera, so it is easy to document events.
I was at the boarder about 2 hrs ago all lanes closed Car coming from usa to canada towards rainbow bridge. So all lanes going in to usa are closed
1:53
Can anyone tell me what the millions and millions of dollars to the biden family was for, and why did it come from our enemies??? I seem to be in the dark here!?!?!?!?
sounds like the fence ripped open the fuel tank
They cut the audio
It's a bit confusing at the moment. A lot of media outlets are saying the vehicle was travelling from Canada to the US. This guy is saying it was travelling from the US into Canada.
You an't seen nothing folks, thanks to senile joe this is just the first.
SORRY TO SAY, BUT MORE OF THIS WILL BE COMING. STAY ALERT!
Sounds like the average Niagara Falls driver
I saw saw on another channel 1 guy 25 27 yr  in hospital  many injuries  1dead
Every other report says the car came from Canada into the US.
I can't imagine the divisive rhetoric and dangerous rhetoric of this current government, AND ITS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR MEDIA, being any cause of this.  or the open borders with no criminal checks, the constant violence rising due to the same people and divisive rhetoric... yeah can't blame this on any of that yet... but when we can.. we will. Is it wrong of me.... That a good chunk of my heart HOPES that this was just an EV going kablooey due to the glaring design issues/dangers that everyone has decided to ignore?
😮
Biggest run on sentence I have ever heard and then the reporter made him say it again.
Was it an EV?
can someone please tell Hochul the rainbow bridge is in Niagara Falls, not buffalo
The customs surveillance video will prove conclusively where it was coming from and going to.
straight to the facts
Wasn't  this guy at Jan 6? FBI ?
I hope its not one of those follow my religion people 😢
Odds are it was someone driving foolishly.  There are many more dangerous risk-takers than dangerous terrorists.
Stolen elections have consequences
Great eye witness account
Now they are saying this was a terror attack
#fjb for this #closethebordersnow
Evel Knievel tries to jump in Niagara River
He knows his cars, he said Chrysler 300 or a Bentley, they are similar in appearance.
Canadian news says it was coming from the US into Canada. I don't know, but it may have been Canadians who bought fuel in the US, but that doesn't explain the high speed described. We'll have to wait and see.
Why am I not surprised ?  #Trump2024
During the entire interview no one focused down where this man was pointing?
Using the classic SpaceX description...that vehicle experienced  a rapid,  unscheduled, disassembly!!!!
Sounds like the reporter is handicap and doesn't know what is said to him
Oh canada
This is what happens when you have open boarders letting the illegals in. God help us all and pray for peace in America.
was it trumps republicans - oat keepers or prud boy - where was tiny trump and gym jordon when this happened
Man can this news crew be any more rude towards this guy why are you wasting your time with these Bozos. Find a news crew that will give you some respect.
This is a different account than what the news is reporting. What is the truth?
Why is the audio cut at first?
The thumbnail photo of the car will tell you that this was a bombing. Not a vehicle catching on fire
excellent witness!!!
So they swerved to avoid hitting a car(weird)  then he saw a fire coming from the car and then more smoke.     He never actually said an explosion.    Reports already  are saying car FULL of explosives.   Keep this interview before the narrative changes
Huh.  Authorities were saying the car was going towards the USA.
Guaranteed the reporter repeaters will have this entire story flipped over the rainbow arse nightly news.
And so it begins.  Just in time for the holidays. Not sure what realy happened.  Just hope the sleepers are not waking up . Stay safe, everyone  . 2 eyes open now
One of Justin Trudeaus imports most likely. Sorry USA.
My son inlaw works at duty-free and saw it
Everyone has a different story if what happened...terrorist...mob hit...aw man
Amazing how  stupid the mainstream media  is shut up and let him talk
Thank you Biden for screwing America up
Great reporting with a witness. Good questions.
This man is the cutest♥️Prayers to everyone involved.
The reporting is very misleading…An “explosion” is very different than a “speeding car that crashed, then exploded.”
What do you mean the northern border is closed. Thats Racist......
Bentley- fast.  Chrysler 300 - not no fast
Just a fire from the car impacting something, or an explosion? Thats the question.
Know the area well. Seneca Niagara Casino is in the background (purple sign) so he's clearly on the US side. He's stating the car was travelling toward Canada from the US, but all news sources say it was US bound from Canada. Can't wait for an 'official' statement.
Fox News is reporting it was a terrorist attack, but it's starting to sound like 2 guys travelling at a high rate of speed crashed a stolen Bentley.
That guy on the bridge said move b.... get out the way.
It's not a bomb, even though the turned itself into one,  you'd think it was a MAGA or a ISIS terrorist, judging by all the medias response.
Wasnt a terror attack. I live here. People are spinning things.....
The facts are wrong according to all other news reports.  This video might be BS
The reporter is super rude ,stupid and disrespectful.
Wow these reporters are smart
These reporters are idiots. Can't they understand English. God bless this man and his wife
This must have been an attack by the most peaceful faith of all glorious Islam, right??
Props to a guy for the patience...
So this sounds like either, malfunctioning accelerator, medical issue or some dumb ass speeding and lost control. I know exactly where this interview is held and I don’t think the border was a target. Thank you kind sir.
Did he say it was a Bentley?
BREAKING NEWS: Diddy committed suicide.
O.M.G.!  How scary!  That driver was probably totally wasted big time.  What a shame and then a day before Thanksgiving too, very sad.
Hmm, sounds like a typical Tesla driver that crashed their car
At the southern border, they'd have to drive pretty far into the USA before they hit a wall
Amazing ppl commenting on how great the eyewitness is and not what is actually happening in both countries. My God talk about zombies!
Omg really. Listen to the guy will you. Stop putting words In His mouth friggin media always such fools.
They are so weak and stupid they manage to blow themselves up.
well trudeau did welcome them to Canada come on in and I'll bet this is just the beginning of our diversity strength
Pretty darn articulate for a Bruins fan.
If an interviewer talked to me like that,  I would tell him to feck off
SO DID IT BLOW UP OR NOT
In a hurry to get some French fry’s and gravy
People are crazy!!
Nothing but a suicide. Was not a terrorists attack. The mass media wants to seize the moment.
The Office of Disinformaition will be working OVERTIME on THANKSGIVING !
Maybe it's just some idiot speeding and hit the fence which caused it to explode. Everything isn't a terrorist attack.
Someone buy this dude a beer.
So all the other news are saying the car just exploded like there was a bomb. No, he was hell bent for leather at 100mph.
Did you see the police with weapons drawn? Were the police following him?........C'mon man, the police had to be doing something wrong.
What’s odd to me is, this witness clearly states the driver was heading INTO Canada FROM the US.  News reports are saying the opposite. Why?  And one news site says the border security had time to inspect the vehicle and pull it to stage two. REALLY?!  So, what are they not wanting us to know?
Thx Biden
This is going to be a daily occurance, thanks "religion of peace".
His story doesn't match the video footage that has been released
The reporter's apparently believe he works for the station.
Great eye witness account.  Clear, accurate and no embellishments.  I've learnt so much more about what happened from this man, than from all the news reports.
Pulling weapons???  Really, on a fireball.. lord..
Electric car????Out of control!!!!
Was not a gas explosion
what this doesn't make sense, wasn't the car going into the US side from the canadian side ?
Wow, he did a great job of concisely relaying what he saw. Give this man a reporter job!
Dude pay attention to what the eyewitnes is telling you, I got it the first time, but it seems that you weren’t paying attention or you need hearing device
Congrats man.  You just saw your first car bomb.
What evidence do "they" have that this was a terro attack?  We had a similar incident of a car that came flying thru our condo drive way and crashed into the dumpsters and then flipped and crashed into a support pillar.  Turned out that the driver had a heart attack and totally.seized.up with his foot jammed into the accelerator.
Biden/Harris - The Gift that Keeps on Giving 😡
click bait
A Chrysler 300 and Bently are not similar 😂 but I know what he means
And it begins...
Great witness! Hopefully no one was hurt walking about.
The interviewer is the worst.
This is the only honest video about what happened on the Internet
What is wrong with these reporters?
No wonder w open border Fjb bidencrimefamily
Terrorists are in the air almost daily spreading poisons on us
Sounds like a terrorist bomb went off quicker than it was supposed to.....thus the high speed.   Only the first of many I'm afraid.  Thanks Joe.
That’s good that there’s eye witness accounts, so it makes it tougher for the powers that be to spin another story.
This is just the beginning. It's going to get MUCH worse! Thanks for the open Border, Traitor Joe!  FJB
There will be more of this crap thx to biden supporters.
If you’re LEAVING Canada, you would stop at US customs before entering the US. Same thing if you’re LEAVING the US and trying to enter Canada, you approach the US customs checkpoint. This car was leaving the US and approaching Canada Customs checkpoint and redirected to secondary inspection before it exploded. Long story short..this car was heading INTO Canada..not leaving Canada
So this actually came from the US side? Wow so much misinformation. The news outlets are blaming this on Canada for fuck sakes.
Reporter is such an asshole
Thank your idiotic local and national Democrats.  Brace yourselfs for more.
Here we go again. When the people begin to voice their opinion and put pressure on the Government and politicians to the point where “We the People” become sick and tired of their foolish leadership, sending our money and resources to other countries, a terrorist attach happens to divert our anger and frustration away toward our Government and we seek their help in security. Dont be fooled people. I’m not saying this is false or anything. What I am saying is focus on one issue at a time. Regardless of what happens, we need to fix corruption first!!
"It took 10 minutes for police to arrive or do anything.. Then suddenly there was police..." - The Value of Eye Witness Testimony folks 😂😂😂😂
This is the exact opposite of news reports
On new channels they are saying that the car was coming from Canada whereas the eye witness says it was going from Canada to US
Canada shoul build a wall
They said the car was going in the direction of Canada, looked liked it went in all directions.
This guy was OOT and ABOOT walking with his wife.
If what this guy is saying is true, it sounds like someone stole the car and was trying to get away across the border, probably had a plan and fake IDs or something. Probably happens a lot in whatever city it came from.
Trudeau still sucks!
How many times do you have to ask him the same questions over and over and over again!!!!!?????? It was Suicide Bombers! Duh!
Walking in the rain and your hat is dry. Fake news  fucking liars.
Something doesn't add up. Witness is from Canada but says miles per hour. Confirmed he didn't see a driver then says "he was swerving". An FBI plant. Rainbow Bridge. Obviously a Two Spirit Indigenous Person protesting Thanksgiving Day.
Describe it again.
It was 2 Suicide Bombers
Pedojoe’s unvetted illegals starting their nonsense
Classic road rage, the car in front cut them off a mile or so back.
Is this canada side or american side?
Does anyone know why google search results show this was uploaded 11 hours ago? Fixed now.
The car exploded into flames....sounds suspicious. Will we ever know the "real" truth...I doubt it
Made some gasoline bombs for films and 12 gallons of gas makes a huge fireball. The fuel tank was breached.
What are the CIA/FBI up to now?
I guess the driver wanted to cross The Rainbow Bridge 🌈😉
Check out Google Street View - this interview is at the corner of 2nd St and Niagara Street in Niagara Falls, NY, and the witness is describing the car was speeding down Niagara St westbound.  Seems like it was in the US speeding towards Canada, not the other way around like all the other news media reports are saying.  But it is a developing story so errors are likely to be made.  Not enough information at this time to speculate if it was a crime or an accident.
The audio dropped off
Was the vehicle a Tesla ?
A Bentley? Maybe Geraldo Rivera distraught over his firing?
.. stuck gas pedal.
Did the driver shout anything about the greatness of the divine?
Blame white supremacist!
The reporter trying to make the witness to sensationalize the narrative so his storie gets top-notch billing in the papers or on the news. News reporter just report the truth.
probably one of those dumbass MAGAt  tRumpers who thought there were too many  Gays crossing the border over the  "RAIN BOW Bridge".
Nothing new here. Americans trying to illegally enter Canada. :) to escape the gun violence.
Your going to find out that most of these shootings are being done by followers to show what they can do
People need to stay away from activities this holiday. It’s just to dangerous
Who was driving the car?
Make sure that ALL USA residents know that our Prime Minister  JUSTIN TRUDEAU  allows terrorist safe haven in Canada!  He is aware and does nothing about it... In Fact, there have been rumors that the one terrorist who was killed in Canada not long ago may have had an affair with one of the Party Leaders, Either Liberal or NDP !  How sick is that!  Not sure it's true, but it's been talked about on news channels.  Feel free to blame Canada.  Our Prime Minister must be replaced.... for all our safety!
Reporter, just let him turn towards the road to show you. It makes more sense for him to point that way, look that way,  from the real vantage point that he had. What an stupid admonishment to keep looking towards the camera!!!  Very low class!!!!  Makes me not want to watch ch 2 news.
Thumbs up for the adorable man, but thumbs down for rude reporter.
So he was walking, walking, walking and saw a fishtailing flying car and a fireball.
electric car battery blew.  dangerous vehicles
Nice hat! Go B’s!
The whole story seems off..another fed hoax possibly
Wow!
So he has never watched NASCAR. 😂🤣😂👍🏼  America seems to hope it was a terrorist attack...... Was a trump supporter driving? There the only terrorists you need to worry about 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 your all dumbass 💩🍆s over there 😂🤣😂👍🏼
You tube star 🌟  Thank you sir Better report than the news stations
Why does he need to say the same thing twice. Open your ears. “ look at us sir”  Stfu
Farking terrorists
Way to go joe Biden. Your  open borders now at work.  Of course  democrats will blame Trump for  this.
Wake up people this is going to happen all over of country if we don’t close the borders now and send back all the people that cross over that has no papers of legal immigrants 😱
What a ridiculous interview , let me see the cameras footage
love the hat!! go bruins!!
The terrorists stated a month ago that I’d we got involved in the Israeli conflict that they’d come to us on our soil! Thanks Biden ya dummy good God!!
TIME TO DEPORT ALL OF THE MUZZLES OUT OF CANADA AND THE US
The media has made it out to be it was on the canadian side. Now this guy is on the american side.  Journalism 101 get the FACTS then report . 😅😅😅😅
That's another reason why we need Mr Trump back in the white house ASAP👍
thanks ay
Omg
Thank God he didn’t get through to NY!
Was not bomb I bet it's more propaganda from your brainwash my control government
Where. Is. The. Video?  There are a thousand cameras there.
Keep voting Democrat.   This is their shit storm they have created.
The religion of "peace" again?
OMG. They keep asking the same questions. Give it a rest.
Bentley car bomb? idk seems strange.  hope this isnt a jihad if the car was a bentley i doubt it
Was he brown ? Just ask him
Thanks Biden
Why is CNN reporting the car was in Canada coming to US ??? but this witness says going to Canada from US
Oh well America as been blessed all these years with no terrorist acts......huummmmm
Drugs
my right ear is jealous
"This one time . . . in Niagara. . . " and that. 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Reporter seem a little slow to comprehend. Your ok? Well the dude is standing in front of you in one piece isn't he...
so the reporter needs to pay more attention to what the witness told him the FIRST time, jeez....
That is to say he saw the car
Yea prolly a car bomb
If it turns out to be a terrorist attack, this is only the beginning
someone should let Bloomberg know about this witness. It was a hedge fund manager leaving the US with your retirement savings....lol
Werid cut at the start
The witness was great. Reporter annoying as usual.
Is it on CCTV  sounds really sketchy was it a medical emergency
Fleeing New York? Was it as EV?
the police news release stated that the car was coming in from Canada in to the US. This witness said the opposite.
FBI will be investigating white parents that attended school board meetings
I never heard of this ‘rainbow bridge’. The only rainbow bridge that I know is the one from Midgard(Earth) to Asgard. That’s the Bifrost
THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED IT WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK. OMG, SO SAD. PRAYING FOR ANYONE WHO GOT HURT, AND THANK YOU TO ALL WHO WERE QUICK TO THE FIRE
Great interview!  I'm glad he & his wife weren't hit during all that.  I've gone over the Rainbow Bridge so many times....this is just so scary that it's so close to home.  Hopefully, it wasn't terrorism & just some idiot being reckless.
Man even apologizing to interviewer. 🙏
So WKBW is reporting that the car was traveling into the US but this witness is saying it was traveling into Canada.
Sounds like a crazy person crashing his car and causing it to explode. Its that holiday meth binge...
Crispy Cream delivery ????
This guy says it was heading into Canada but the reports say the opposite..
translation  - that's 160 km/h
Why does google say this was uploaded 11 hours ago?
So the world is dropping purple twinkies over a car accident. Back to work, everyone.
Main street is on the American side. No mention of crossing a bridge. Car going towards Canada.
Just open it like the Mexican border and you won’t have to stop cars
Clues - name of the bridge 🌈 psyop 22/11 = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6!
they're here.....
Amazing , this is what it's gonna take to close the borders , 😔😢, Unbelievable,If thats True and they finally closed the borders, WE CAN ONKY PRAY 🙏
Imagine the media get everyone all scared and living in fear even more than they already do. Imagine ‘more’ things happen that turn people against other people. They are wanting a race war globally. Beware. Be wary!
The reporters want to ask so bad if there is anyway Trump was involved lol 😂
I wonder if any public Thanksgiving celebrations will be cancelled tomorrow in New York, as this was probably a suicide bomber or car bomber  attacking Thanksgiving that's gone off early.
having a boston bruins hat as a canadian should be a crime
Someone rushing to get a bacon sandwich from Alans Snackbar
Audio sucks
bentley and chrysler are similiar cars?!
Psyop 👀 ??
Sounds like someone lost all their money at the casino and they killed thrmsrlves.
This is the result of open boarders bad job biden administration
So why is ABC saying the car was coming from Canada into the U.S.A. ?
After about 11 seconds the volume went down wtf
Rainbow 🌈 Bridge? Anything Rainbow is dangerous now
👳
how are all the news agencys fucking thins story up   everyone is saying  Canada to USA border   and this guy said USA to Canada     0:55
It was Dylan Mulvaney in his Subaru Outback.
Great reporting. I think they are closing down all four bridges
is this a terror attack in regards to Israel vs Gaza?
Another unvetted individual trying to get into Canada
Probably just crashed and ripped open the gas tank.
Next we need Ja rule to explain it
TRUDEAU AND BIDEN ARE TOO BLAME
too late to close the borders now that they been wide open for so long now
Terrorist attack
Reporters mad rude to bro for no reason
The Chrysler 300 and Bentley are practically identical
I love it how people are implicating an unknown 'terrorist' when it was obviously just a very enthusiastic consumer jumping the gun on Black Friday. Of course now if it really was a Bentley, as this guy suggests, I'm siding towards the conclusion that we won't have P. Diddy to kick around anymore, not that I'm a proponent of idle speculation or group gossip.
Great interview.
Probably an electric car.
This is comic gold
So it was an idiot who was in a car accident…or a terrorist attack
Where's the audio?
Whys this all muted for me?
Bruins fan!
My gosh... Fox and cnn trying to make this into a terrorist attack. 😆
If the driver was going 100mph... that tells you something...
Driver: Allah hu Bomber!
probable the real first account of what happen but if the government want's or needs you to think differently bet your bottom dollar that this video disappears  then they will spin the narrative to bet suet thier agenda  if this wasn't it in the first place          never let a tragedy go to waist
So glad we took the Queenston/Lewiston bridge. Even though we were trapped on it for over an hour, that better than being fucking killed by an exploding car. How terrible. I really hope no border officers or people in line were killed.....
it was a dam drunk and you all bowing this sht out of porportion
Go Bruins!
And here we go. I have been expecting an attack with the border open. I fear this is only the first of many.
I don't think this is a terrorist attack. It sounds more like somebody tripping balls and/or drunk and driving recklessly.  Americans, you can put your pew pews away for now.
Crap audio
Pretty scary eh?
Oh ya, sounds like it was on purpose for sure bud. 🤣 All the news about this and this polite Canadian who was actually there just calmed me down. Just some stupid guy speeding.
3.2k views 28 minutes ago
how about panning the camera toward where the witness was pointing???
lmao the guy describing the scene is so adorable
Waiting for conspiracy theorist saying that the FBI knows this is coming and let it happened.
Good interview
As an american living abraod .. must say this is a silly episode.. Thank you HARRIS, da Borda TZARR, Biden, Obama, Mayorkas, and da other Dems.. it is your fault.. the USA is sunk .. thank you all...
Terrorist Attack or Vehicle Explosion at Rainbow Bridge Closes all WNY Border Crossings Between U.S. and Canada  In the hypothetical scenario of a terrorist attack or a vehicle explosion at Rainbow Bridge that results in the closure of all Western New York (WNY) border crossings between the United States and Canada, several critical aspects need to be considered. This situation would have significant implications for national security, border control, emergency response, and international relations. The following comprehensive analysis will explore the potential consequences and responses to such an event.  Impact on Border Security and Cross-Border Traffic  The closure of all WNY border crossings between the U.S. and Canada due to a terrorist attack or a vehicle explosion at Rainbow Bridge would have immediate and far-reaching effects on border security and cross-border traffic. Law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border would need to implement heightened security measures to prevent any further threats and ensure the safety of individuals in the vicinity. The flow of goods and people between the two countries would be disrupted, impacting trade, tourism, and daily commutes for residents in the region.  Emergency Response and Crisis Management  In response to such a crisis, emergency response teams, including police, fire departments, paramedics, and other first responders, would need to mobilize quickly to secure the area, provide medical assistance to any injured individuals, and assess the extent of the damage. Coordination between U.S. and Canadian authorities would be essential to effectively manage the emergency situation and mitigate its impact on public safety.  Investigation and Intelligence Cooperation  Following a terrorist attack or a vehicle explosion at Rainbow Bridge, law enforcement agencies, intelligence services, and counterterrorism units from both countries would launch thorough investigations to determine the nature of the incident, identify perpetrators if it was an act of terrorism, and gather intelligence to prevent future threats. Close cooperation and information sharing between U.S. and Canadian authorities would be crucial in this investigative process.  Diplomatic Relations and Bilateral Cooperation  The occurrence of such an event would also test the diplomatic relations and bilateral cooperation between the United States and Canada. Both countries would need to engage in open communication, mutual support, and collaboration to address the security implications of the incident while maintaining the integrity of their shared border.  Reopening of Border Crossings and Rebuilding Confidence  Once the immediate threat is contained, efforts to reopen WNY border crossings between the U.S. and Canada would require careful planning, security assessments, and public reassurance measures. Rebuilding confidence in border security and restoring normal cross-border operations would be essential for regional stability and economic activities.  In conclusion, a terrorist attack or a vehicle explosion at Rainbow Bridge leading to the closure of all WNY border crossings between the United States and Canada would have multifaceted implications for security, emergency response, international cooperation, and public confidence in cross-border travel.
I think Best Buys in Canada just started their Black Friday sale early, so this makes sense
Probably a terror attack 1 of many no doubt. Or maybe 2 people racing each other 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Bad audio at beginning!
The fuck he can see the license plate when going around 100 miles an hour. The guy’s too stupid.
Most likely a loan wolf Muslim attack
One time I'd love to see the video.
FJB
False flag small hat operation.
