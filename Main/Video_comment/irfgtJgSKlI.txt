The 13 year old: It don't matter literally means IT  DONT MATTER
That's cool.  Now go to class and pay attention so you can graduate.  As Barkley said, too many of these kids think they are going to get paid to ball when only a very small fraction of them will.  Have fun, chase your dream.  You do you.  But don't put all your eggs in the football basket.  Can too easily be taken from you "just like that".  Peace.
Read, study and learn about everything imporant in your life.
Crazy how much bigger this shit is a year later....! still watching, love the growth a nd what you're doing for these kids man!
i love you <3000

Why is the DB out after a bad ball? Example at 29:00.
Well before you started the video you said that a receiver would get a thousand and a DB would get a thousand but then you changed it up at the very last second that's pretty fucked up for every receiver that came out there thinking they was going to get some money that would be like me going to a pool tournament and at the very last second they say Well since this dude has beat everybody if he continues to do so he gets all the money even though they were second and third places in the tournament you see what I'm saying
But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.God loves you so much John 3:16 says that he loves you so much he gave his only son to die for your sins

Michigann
I watched a few of these before and they were bearable…this video I had to stop after watching the third route. Sign a quarterback to travel with you who can throw the ball at even a D+ level in madden. My God these quarterbacks could be given an entire pool to hit a target and still miss. Absolutely trash, it ruins all of the routes where the receiver clearly burned the defender but the quarterback is throwing the ball twenty yards back and to the left of the receiver. The defender doesn’t even touch the ball or have to make a play. It’s absolute trash. Not worth wasting my time to watch, I’ll literally do it for you full time if you pay me $100,000 yearly salary. I threw 90-92mph and pitched in college D2 for a top 15 ranked school. I can throw dots to receivers just doing basic 1 on 1s…these KIDS suck. You lost a subscriber purely off the fact that I can’t watch this trash talent anymore. Comes to watch 1 on 1s and sees Baker Mayfield throwing shit passes instead. Unacceptable.
8:30 hillarious
Come to Houston

ohio cin come to pls
Great video! I don't know who is throwing the ball, he did the best he could but, he is supposed to throw it in front of the receiver, not behind the receiver so he has to stop and wrestle with the DB for the ball. You guys are awesome for keeping it friendly! This is what communities need to stop the drugs and violence.
Go to vegas
I don’t get the whole speed thing..if you are fast as fuck why not use that? What u mean u wanna see football? U think in the NFL if a WR is much faster than the guy covering him he’s gonna be like “ let me not use my speed gotta run good routes and play “real” football. Lmao get outta here

SO many of these kids just don't know how to run routes. Way too many stutterstep right on the line before taking off. That is bad bad form.
What kind of screwed up parent lets a 13 year old get tats. You know that kids days are numbered. He will be in jail or dead before he is 25. Guaranteed.

Baltimore has some Straight Ballers I would love to see a video of that
Chicago gang
Why do yall think age matters, 13 is considered grown in some regions, yall be petty asf for clout, as if a 13 year old isn't capable of being great on a upper level, understand being black comes with good genetic genes that allow us to do amazing things and we definitely shouldn't be ashamed to acknowledge it

"That was you? You fired." LMAO coach funny asf
By the way the quarterback's not just in one city most of the videos that I've seen the quarterback is just not there so most of the time
I've watched so many of your videos they're fantastic what you're doing is fantastic but most of the videos the quarterbacks I don't know what they're doing sometimes they're okay but most of the time they're just not really a quarterback It's not just the ability to throw the ball throw the ball hard it's more being precise
Bro I love Travis hunter and he can play legit any position on the football field
Excepting a few bad throws some mighty good routes being run.

Let me question something do you know where you will go after you die? If not let me say you can have a choice to either go to hell or heaven see 2000 years ago there was this man named Jesus who died on the cross for our sins and rose alive 3 days later all because he truly loved us he died for us so I question you now do you truly believe in Jesus or do you live for the world turn to Jesus Christ trust in him Christ has way much more to give than the world he loves us turn to Christ

95% of these people don’t know how to get open. They just know how to run frantically and constantly juke. And  in order to do these properly you need a QB who can actually throw the ball
Why do you dudes insist on acting goofy on a basic throw and catch? Shit is weird. Majority of these dudes wouldn’t know what a route is if they were looking at a map
I’m still waiting for fucking Norman Oklahoma youth man we be driving 1v1 at fucking school we ready my man come on

23:12 they dick riding the white boy! He should of gotten his band taken away first 2 routes. And they were getting rid of better people because of bad throws 🤦🏽‍♀️ like that receiver who jump mad high to catch that ball was way better!

99% of the WRs were so focused on going deep. Even why the beat the DB, they let them get back into it by going deep. Cmon.
travis is to funny we need to see hime more
come to Albany ny there's a good amount of people
Ok I know nothing of football or of this type of 1:1 so question: it seems like the distance of the catch doesn't matter right? So why doesn't everyone follow the same strategy as 20:45 ? Drive in then turn around and run back to get the catch? Or at least play with the distance a little more and not only run forward? Maybe there's a rule here I'm missing or something
Come to Fairfield. Vanden high just won state for basketball and football I think u should go to their school
The DBs did well but it was mostly due to these receivers not having a clue what they’re doing.
QB fucked alot of the WR too
The WR would kill if they went left.. I'm watching the WR get open on the left and turn right back into the inside or go back right, right back into the DB.. shit made no sense..  recap the video and watch how many WR was open and cleared space going left and fucked themselves going back to the right 🤦🏾‍♂️
Man QBs were ass this whole video. So many times the WR beat his man but the ball thrown into DB leverage
Fuckin muppets
Whenever yall come back me and my friends will pop out
Milwaukee Wisconsin
Deestroying vs Travis
I’m tryna be apart of the next ATL runs

Who you is?  So sad 😥
Are they telling the receivers what route they are to run BEFORE the play starts or is it all free-lancing or improvisation?
That’s at Tennessee commit?😂
1st was a bad ball
The crowd work and control in the beginning is amazing
Why is eveey reaction to every play so dramatic? It's weird.  Calm down
I can throw that ball
Travis looks tuff😤
azizona my dude
Baseball is > Giving out more college scholarships...more pro potential and MLB organizations offer to pay for your college education if you sign out of high school and don't make the pros. Football is an out dated slavery institutiion minded sport. Destroying your body for 2 years in the NFL and low pay isn't worth it. Sport is trash im sorry.

California
Bro hit da Madden spin 😅😅
This shit is sad… teaching wideouts to try and play against illegal moves by DBs… making them take off their bands after getting bear hugged and shoved to the ground n shi…
I grew up poor. Fast forward to 2022, I’m retired at age 45. I have a BA degree with a few speciality degrees. I personally paid for my college via part time jobs. After that, I took my first risk starting a business. Long story long, it failed. Next, it took blood sweet and tears to have two successful businesses. Zero bank loans.   my point: 95% of these dudes will do sssshhhit. If you’re all goo goo over this hyped up video, you’ve be failed. The only one successful in this vid is prob the youtube dooouchhhb. He’ll be done in 2 years….max. Meanwhile, I’ll send you pics from my lake property.   Conclusion: get an education degree. Find a way to contribute to Society.
Bunk.
Damn I wished I could've stuck to football I chose the streets tho
uhm, no contact after 5 yards???
I could throw better routes behind the pack then they could throw regular absolute trash lets go viral fwm De
fly out my dad but u have to find him
What is the narrative behind the use of a song containing multiple N-words and FBombs as the football team entrance song at Kyle Field? Many still do take offense to the use of these racial slurs.. One would think TAMU would want to be part of the solution, not the problem?  --
Come to manning Sc or Sumter Sc or Florence Sc or get the best ones from manning High all the high schools in Sumter and the ones from south Florence and Wilson high school 😎😎

Yup. Tattoos at 13, prison at 23. Good job parents.
That’s sad that guy committed to Tennessee that’s sad Tennessee is hurting
ay this bryson park 😂
Great content guys. Much respect to all out there. Class all around while still keeping it competitive and fun without clowns getting butt hurt. That's how it's done.
How was there no holding call on the 13 year old at the end? That guy molested him. First two receivers of the last three didn't seem like their route took that long, don't understand your time limit regulations.
Sup

JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU SO MUCH!!!

Ion like how yall called time the last round and no other rounds. Its like yall wanted to give him all the bread. Also wtf is all this contact 10,15,20 yards into the route? Anything after 5 yard is a penalty. GA dont got it. The crib the best in the nation.
Joe burrow
Man no one could get by me I’m to good of a db
And I could easily be a better thrower at 13 I can throw bout 50 60 yards

It isn’t a coincidence everyone fell. That turf is horrible
Im a good Qb
Wtf qb
Someone please keep that 13 year old on the right path. Definitely a lot of potential there.
Lamar Jackson as QB great
I love your content but I can’t help but think about how many quarterbacks would have been SACRIFICED/SMOKED while these ‘receivers’ were ‘running routes’ and trying to get open.  Maybe do like an hour before the 1 on 1s, teaching a basic route tree (1-9)?Teaching basic press/off inside/outside technique?   These kids could learn a lot from what you have to teach them.  This is a poor man’s And1 mixtape in cleats.
California
It’s out of bounce I don’t give a fuck god dam it catch that ball lol 😂
Should of tol Travis to get his HS QB to come throw some balls...

As someone familiar with the politics of sports, I'm certain anyone claiming they're 13 and keeping up with collegiate level players isn't actually 13. To throw any readers for a loop, the kids probably themselves don't know their birth certificates were falsified. It's the parents doing it. This practice is particularly prevalent in poor areas, where the success of a kid can get them out of poverty.
Ay dee u at Bryson park???
that kid should have got the money he is 13 and cooking people up
Va next👀?
