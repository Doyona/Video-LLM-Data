I lied
I love you Anthony and all your friends ❤️ y'all truly gave me the spark to live my life. I literally love you all so so much watching your videos made me realise this life is truly incredible thank you ❤️
Goodbye
You've just been Johhhhn Chunguessed
NOO okpop
Hey Anthony. I want to let you know (even though you might never read this) that you reminded me what the point was of life. And everyday I try and think of how I can live life to fullest and goofiest (Im not, but Im trying right now) and continuously I hope I can recreate a fraction of what your videos portray because I forget thats the point of life. To be goofy, funny, and sort of stupid in life and enjoy every second of it. Thank you so much for creating this channel. It is an continuous inspiration for me.
so nice bro
Honestly you should disappeared the contentd sfter this is not good.
This was 2 YEARS ago now? 😢 We got 1 more year left with Anthpo😻
exactly two years ago from today, my favorite creator gave me an emotional rollercoaster. Love you Anthpo. Favorite videos were your Perry the Platypus vids <3
i think i just realized anthpo was the first quirked up white boy with a little bit of swag who busts it down sexual style and is goated with the sauce. tchalamet before tchalamet
I found your channel last year , saw this video a year ago after that cult infiltration one thought everything has ended now for y’all. But you are back 8m ago and I’m getting to know it now😂. Happy for the comeback . Expecting great content from you .
a year later but im sitting on my floor right now and your message at the beginning was so needed
i really like coming back to this to rewatch it, came at a really good time for me
Bro tried retiring before it became a trend.
He couldn’t get a job 💔💔💔
Top 3 YouTuber of all time
I found this channel 2 days ago and am emotional over this
gg
i love you anthpo
haha sure bud
Love this song
This was the worst birthday present ever
I Thought This Was His Final Video
Life ain’t boring if ur cheeseball man💀💀
1:01 she cheated on him apparently 😭
Use this as an “Anthpo should go back on hiatus” button……..  🤚🏼🤚🏼🤚🏼
Now we know
NOOOOOO!
So Anthony was secretly dating Janice?
even after having watched all of your videos since u started posting 4 years ago, I still felt so sad just seeing this video of you saing goodbye, and I congratulate u on graduating college. I was so excited seeing ur hello video, and I know the upcoming videos will be truly amazing.
why cant bro stay gone
Would be better if You didn't return...
It took me more than a year to watch this, I didn't have the courage. At least Anthony's back
Honestly, I didnt want to watch this video because I didnt want to accept the fact that youre leaving. But now that you’re back, thank you for everything you are 100% one of the best youtubers of all time and I can’t wait to watch all of your upcoming videos!!
i know he came back but, 1 year ago? that passed hella fast
CHEESEBALL MAN
I'm really glad to see you posting videos again. I missed being able to smile at your videos. I graduated this May and this video really gave me a lot of energy to finish my college experience strong. Your words have really stuck with me, I've enjoyed watching your story and I will love to continue watching your story, but I've gone out and lived mine.
Who?
This is the highlight of the video. Everyone just checking who anthpo dated or is dating. 01:01
What bothers me is all the horny people that watch this video. The most watched part is kinda unsettling to think about why it is.
You lied.
Shouldve left for good.
cried the first time watching this and cried on the rewatch
Are people ignoring the fact that athpo left too? Like yeah he’s back now but he didn’t quit on April Fool’s day
ok cheeseman
Thankfully, this didn’t age
should've actually left for good. waste of air to be honest....
Liar liar pants on fire!
I don’t even know ur channel (yet) and I cried
I refused to watch the goodbye video when he left. Now hes back :)
hes backlkk
BRO LIED
me when I lie
It’s been a year and I still question if Janice and him are dating cause it pops up with them when he says “fall in love”
1:00
SAID THE LIAR!
A liar. I had known Anthony Po for 53 years. We had a beautiful friendship based on trust and pure lunacy. And what did it all lead up to? Anthony Po being a ***** liar. I feel betrayed, hurt, but most of all, disappointed. I had expected much better of Anthony Po. I don't know what to feel anymore. Perhaps I pushed him too far. Perhaps he pushed me too far. Perhaps nobody pushed each other at all and we were stuck waiting at the starting line. Perhaps this metaphor makes no sense at all. Perhaps I've the word perhaps too much, and have now lost the plot. but the fact is: ......furries ?
HES BACK !!
So it was all a pose
Ladies and gentlemen! We are back!
HELLO!!! Welcome back, bro
Welp… This certainly aged
He's back again lol... slay
Hello
hello.

Hello!

WHIS HERE AFTER HE CAME BACK? :’>
It might seem crazy what I’m about to say
Liar
LYIN ASS
Then there's me at 24, online school, struggling, working at a dead end normie job, with one day off every so often. Boy maybe I shouldve gone on-campus XD instead, I will vicariously live through anthpo, because this man is the youtube legend I had always wanted to be when I was in highschool. bro's videos NEVER have a dull moment.
Bozo lied
well nevermind ig
Hmm.. this aged well
THE LEGEND IS BACK!!!!!!!
WELL WELL WELL…..
Going through the comments and seeing everyone who missed him getting replies that he came back 💀 (welcome back Anthpo)

Hey Anthony, you and your channel are honestly some of my favorite stuff I’ve ever seen. And definitely my favorite youtube channel. The goofy vibes of you and your friends, and unending dedication to a video. And I really love the kinda chaotic/chill feelings of school. I know something big is happening today, and my friends and I are hyped. Please Anthony, however you decide to procede, just know that we appreciate all the content and experiences you’ve put out for us.
May 14 today Hope you are living well! We all miss you
It's been one year since he retired, I really miss those videos man :/
I hope may 14 lives up to the hype
We miss you Friends!  I Hope you are ok!
May 14
It’s officially been a year. We still miss you. But also, welcome back.
Goodbye always feels so permanent, I prefer “later gator” Excited for tomorrow :)
And then He just comebacks, messing around w/ our hearts +1 sub
Still not over this not one bit
I thank you Anthpo, I watched your first video and seen it , I want to do what you did through college and live my life rembered. Thank you so much :)
May 14???? The fart is going on here?!?!??!

Omg... i js discorvered ur channel by ur cult video:((( i really love ur video from that cult video and going to watch the others :D  Im so happy for you i hope u will live the life to the fullest from now and till then 💕💕
Goodbye fat yoshi man yo will be missed
he's coming back for the 1 year anniversary  my heart can't take it
Why😢😢
Even if the 14th thing is a joke it's crazy for me to see this 11 months late, like bro is Gone, but I check his twitter, and see a poast saying "To celebrate coming back to YouTube in 6 days I’m giving away a bunch of children on my Instagram :)"  Fun, genuinely. The cult video is how I found the channel and it sticks with me even when I hardly remember what happened in it sometimes. Just the raw vibes.
Can’t believe it’s been a year since he left yt
MAY 14?????
Anthpo when he lies :
Hang on may 14? Is he returning may 14
PAPA IS COMING BACKK, YOUTUBE WILL BE YOUTUBING AGAIN, RAHHHH WE MISSED YOU ANTHPO!!!!!

HES GONNA BE BACK
He's coming back!
HES COMING BACK LETS GOOOOOOOOO
GUYS HE IS COMING BACK
Im a year younger, and I want to say that Anthpo's videos have given me a lot of hope. At the end of my junior year, I had to leave for health issues, both physical and mental, and for the last year I haven't been able to attend school because my body hasn't recovered from it. Even when I was in school, I always thought I wanted my college experience to be like these videos, and although they didn't end up like the videos, the videos still give me hope that I can do something. I haven't been able to walk in months, and honestly, it feels really bad seeing everyone you know moving on with their lives while you're stuck in place and unable to move, but your videos, both when you were making them and now rewatching them make me feel like I'll still be able to do something. So, thanks a lot for giving us a bit of your journey, Anthpo. I'm sure it was a lot to go through to put it all together, but I reallt do enjoy the videos.
I heard from the okpop Instagram comments that Anthony is coming back on the day he left YouTube (may 14)  Edit: WE’RE BACK
Almost a year now 😢
f
Bro i just started watching you i didn't know you quited:(
Anthpo are you the cheeseball man

I can't believe it's almost been a year. I always come back sometimes to rewatch your videos because of the timeless feeling of them. Thank you anthpo

I was taking some time to unsubscribe from channels since I was subscribed to almost 1000 of them, I started going through them, and stumbled through your channel once again, I remembered the videos, and I didn't knew you had stopped making them, and honestly, I needed to hear and see some of this, thank you. I wont be unsubscribing from your channel btw as I even took time to write a comment. As parasocial as it might be, thank you for making part of my life at least in some way.  Sincerely, Chá.
I really wish you never graduated 😔
I just watched the twelve tribes video and was like "this guy seems cool, cant wait to see what he posts next!" And its just him leaving youtube.

One month, and it will successfully be the one year anniversary for the ending of this channel, love to see it
I can’t believe it’s already been a year
~ why do I keep finding great Youtubers that I’ve already left the platform?!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭 Actually can’t believe the fact that he actually left ! Just like he had promised! I just found the channel about an hour ago so I guess I’m just saving myself from all the heartbreak having to watch all his videos and then having to see him say goodbye to me! So yeah… This is it for me too. Bye-bye.   . . . . . . ~ 15th of April 2024 at 12:08 PM Monday
Ruh roh
just started watching you to find out you quit. 😭 hope you do greater things in life !!
3 years gone just like that 😔
11 months bro, will he be back for the one year anniversary??
Craziest dad lore of all time
It has almost been a year since he quit. I’m going to cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
Please come back someday, even if it’s on your deathbed. You’re a hero to me
No… my boy… I love you, goodbye…
Even tho i was late to comment in this video i genuinely enjoyed his videos and had fun im so sad that he had leave but he controls his life not us thank for the content anthpo
When are you gonna do the korra book for avatar series??
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉you are such a legend. Congratulations on your achievement
Pls come back
That’s a shame used to be my favorite YouTuber
My life means nothing now
First ever non anime content that GAVE FKIN CHILLS. i watched the haikyuu video then watched this sad to see u go but it really was amazing
My life seems sooo uneventful in comparison 😭
to be completely honest, when i found your channel this video was recently uploaded, im not a 31 year old divorced man or anything, i know that i still have alot to experience, and graduating college is one of them. but it makes me feel so nostalgic seeing people go, even though i wasn’t particularly there, and yes, i am a VERY nostalgic person so i hate stuff like this i love ur channel, but it does make me kind of happy (this is gonna sound rlly bad) but it makes me feel that way because i have alot to experience, and makes me remember to actually live my life because nothing actually will last forever (💔) and seeing ur memories comforts me   i guess life could be watered down into one thing - bittersweet, your not gonna struggle forever but your never gonna be happy forever, so i guess i should be happy I’ll experience different things but you dont always have to feel that way, like you said - its okay to not be okay.
Got my youtube account a few months after you quit. I regret not making an account during this era😢
BRUH I FOUND YOUR CHANNEL TODAY AND I WAS SO EXCITED CUZ YOU SEEMED SO COOL JUST TO FIND OUT THAT YOU DONT EVEN POST ANYMORE :(
just subscribed
Going back to reminisce over old stuff like usual. Won't say I was a diehard fan but I definitely enjoyed your content. Seeing you go from high school student, to high school grad to college grad was insane. And makes me really think man, time really does go by fast.  Around this time, before this video came out, I wasn't really living my own life. It was honestly kind of a blur for a couple years, where I quite literally did almost nothing but work and go home. And funny enough, around the time this video came out its like? A switch clicked for me. I've been confused quite often this past year as to what happened that made me suddenly start living my own life differently.  I was finally doing something with my own life, going out, seeing friends, talking to people when I normally wouldn't. Just living, essentially. I've experienced so much and done so much the past (almost) year that I forgot what I even felt or did the year before.  It's sad to see you go, but I man I do mean it when I say, I believe this video definitely moved me to start living my own life. And for that, I gotta say thank you. And I hope you're doin swell my guy.
can he come back he didnt make a skibidi video
Bro came back in the Bling Bling Bang Born video with the Anime men😭
No way bro captured the human experience in 3 minutes and 14 seconds
Just dicovered you two days ago and I just lost you.. but I’m going to enjoy catching up on everything yall have done on this channel ❤️🤙🏼

Goodbye Anthony. Hope you find happiness, somewhere else....
I have been following anthpo for over a year, he has brought so much and and happiness to me and I am sad he’s gone. What a happy birthday to me I guess.

that fact that now my high school is over, and I will be starting my university years, hits hard. I wish you all the best. Thank you!
I remember watching the highschool videos to you moving to college, this made me think about my own future as I'm now in college. I'll miss these crazy videos you have created 😂
Idk him but this vid made me sad

Miss u big man
I loved the perry the platypus video, i hope youre doing well
I hope you can come back to this video and find light in life again whenever you want :)
I miss the entire ACU
Noooo
I keep coming back to this video, because it always symbolizes how were all growing up. I remembered the first time I watched your videos in 2019, when I just started my 6th grade year of Middle School, to now coming back and watching your videos as a Junior in High School. Everytime I watch your videos after you left youtube, it just reminds me and probably everyone, that time and growing up are inevitable, and the things that you love, laugh, and enjoy will go away , but its the choice you make after to see if its either Misery or Joy.
Salute, agent P.
wtf Anthony, come back and finish attack on titan
nonthing gold can stay
I literally just discovered you and I see this?😭
Came back to watch this again today. It really gave me hope and made me appreciate how amazing life is. Thank you for all that you've done Anthony. We love you <3
awhh man i just found this guy but hes already gone
oh no not me JUST NOW discovering possibly the greatest YouTuber to have ever created actual good art on this hellsite only to learn they retired 10 months ago... well I was never a very punctual person. wherever you are now, I wish you all the best! Seems like you deserve it
This mf gave up 1.7 million subscribers to work a 9-5?
Wow its been 10 months and it feels like only 10 days, thank you Anthony.
I'm still here watching your old vids. They still make me laugh 🙏
almost been a year since he left. I graduated from college the same month this video came out and it made me regret not living my college life to the fullest. I still regret and I would do anything to have another chance to experience college again with no regrets.
I’ve genuinely have changed so much as a person since this video released and I have you and my college experience to thank for that Anthony, thank you so much for helping me become the person I am today. Hope to see you in videos again soon! ❤
I JUST DISCOVERED THIS CHANNEL GOD DAMMIT 😭
Day 1 of asking for a update
wonder what job he landed himself on other than behind the scene of okpop
I didnt even know this was posted. I remembered the channel, and now im just sad.
Pls mister, upload, I miss this channel
And we never got the every episode of attack on titan s4
2024 is the future buddy 😢
My sisters and I used to watch your videos, but we stopped watching them after coming to Jesus Christ. You had come to mind about a day ago and then I thought of you again today so I came to figure out how you've been and I see that you have graduated. I am very glad you were able to graduate and that God has spared your life. Now that the next chapter of your life is starting I just want to advise that you make sure that the Lord is apart of it. With him in your life there is hope. God's word says that you can rejoice in him, that he is a source of strength and that he can make us as surefooted as a deer (Habakkuk 3:18-19). To be surefooted is to be unlikely to stumble or slip and to be confident and competent (having the necessary ability, knowledge, or skill to do something successfully). Jesus (Yeshua, meaning save or to rescue) is the Son of the one true God and the Messiah (or Christ). He came down from heaven and came in the flesh, fully God and fully man, and lived a perfect and sinless life. Then he died on the cross, enduring mocking and pain from hanging on the cross and prior beatings he received. He died on the cross, enduring the wrath of God, on our behalf so that those who put their faith in him could be spared from the punishment we deserve for our sins (rebellion against a just and perfect God). When Jesus rose from the dead on the 3rd day, it confirmed his identity as the son of God and the messiah, thereby ensuring that those who put their faith in Christ have received the gift of salvation and eternal life. God loved us enough to give us grace, through Jesus' blood. His plans are perfect and good and if you give him a chance it won't be easy, but it will be worth it. You will see the world as it really is and you will have the best guidance there is. The God of Israel, I AM, will never leave you , nor forsake you. I hope anyone reading this considers allowing God to lead them through their life and Trusting Jesus with your all your being.
we need a year update in may
still cryin over dis
I'm annoyed I'm so late for the finale, but it's damn good to finally see it

Hope you have a good and bright future we will all miss you. Thank you ❤
Enjoy YouTube Retirement Anthony
I keep on coming back to this video and crying because we wont be able to see his content anymore and it genuinely was some of the best moments of my life to always have these to look forward to guess its time to do another full binge of both channels
It has been nine months
Anthony. We're the same age and I saw you from my first year in college and I dreamt of being you
my favorite videos of his are from 3 years ago and it's the avatar videos they are so funny to me and will always be
I just keep coming back hoping you came to but you haven’t miss you
Avatar
Still supurised he did this... i watched it on release date then it came back in my recommend
Is that supposed to make me cry? Mission complete
I teared up watching this And barely know this channel???
I'm always confused on why so many  people stop their youtube channels when they graduate college
I miss you.
I just discovered your channel and your contents are great. I was happy to find a new channel to watch and follow. However, when I clicked on the latest video I didn’t expect it to be your goodbye video. I was so looking forward to see new contents but I guess I was too late.
O nah fuck that you have to come back now i miss you 😭
wholesome af
I am so thankful for your videos Anthony they helped me get out of my comfort zone and meet new people. Even tho it’s not always going great I am on a good way. I am so thankful for all your videos and it amazes me how you really quit and not just said you would. I hope you have a great time right now and I am so thankful that I could watch and learn from you videos
Imagine seeing an amazing youtuber and you watch his videos and then, month later he says goodbye. I was sad and still am. Even tho, it was amazing, take care!❤
WAIT HE QUIT?????
damn its already been 9 months...
hey again miss u. pic with moistcr1tikal went hard asf tho
Damn well good luck in life hope you have an amazingly journey
and again, i came back to check for new video but just to have tear in my eye. Thank you Anthpo.
Crazy how far you've come. You went to the same high school I'm in rn and I always visit the places where you filmed your Perry the Platypus videos. Teachers never forgot you and Kingsway still remembers you as a legend. Good luck in the future
Nah I just watch the 12 tribes video to come look at your most recent video and it was you quiting😭 goddamn it
i cant believe this video was 9 months ago, it feels like yesterday
I JUST subbed, omg
i swear he will make a comeback
holy fuck, this guy has had a W life
thank you Anthony for everything you did, make me laugh smile once again thank you for sharing me your 4 years I hope you live a happy life with the people you love Goodbye Anthony i hope you come back.
bye
he left before remaking the last season of aot :(
They're all leaving.  Everyone is leaving.  So many youtubers that I love are quitting youtube, and when I discover a new one, the last video is "goodbye". 🥲
Oh my how much I wish I did this with my highschool journey :(
Somebody please just make a movie of anthpo videos and this video just be the ending
Why every amazing YouTuber are leaving YouTube 😢
I’m not crying your crying your crying 😢
I haven’t watched your videos in a while but seeing this video made me remember what you have accomplished   May fat yoshi and perry the platypus be in your favour. And i’d like to to say thank you for creating these videos to make us enjoy it.  Good luck with life
I suspect this is the yellow deli's doing
I aspire to do what you did in college
No please don’t make me emotional while watching, it’s too much, congratulations on becoming a college graduate and we hope you a good life out there. You are a good man, don’t forget that! Good luck on your journey out there! you are gonna need it.
Its been 9 months, huh? Feels like yesterday. Hope you're doing fine, Anthony. Thanks for the memories, it's been fun.
this is my roman empire
I miss him
I saw you in Moistcritikal’s ig post
Tomorrow is another day This other day won't see you unfortunately  But it will remember you forever, for each day to come
Anthony thank you for all the laughs, i always knew something like this would happen when the countdown went down and its super crazy seeing u go from high school to college congrats anthony im happy for you
Did u get kicked out of okpop?
Is it just me that didnt know that Anthony and Janice was together?
No
Im still back here
I just started watching your channel, but I'm so glad you had this much fun :))

Thank you for everything. I wish you the best.

We all thought that youtubers started quiting in 2024, but it seems Anthony started the trend. Go off with a bang, we still love ya.
have fun at yellow deli lmao
Bye hotie ❤
I don't know why this is viewed as the end and not a new beginning...
HOW DID I MISS THIS WHAT THE FUCK
Worried he left because of the cult and not cause of college
I just found your channel and i hope you keep making videos 💚
thanks for making all of us laugh, you’ll be missed! super late to this video, but we’re so glad you shared these years of your life with us. ❤
:/
Almost been a full year since you’ve quit wild
we will miss you very dearly
6 years from now the "Let's Begin" video is gonna be a blast.
Cried when i watched this for the first time 8 months ago, and im crying again right now. We'll miss you man, thanks for sharing a bit of your life with us <33
For the past 3 days i sat my butt down and watched every video of anthpo i could in chronological order. I found this channel after seeing Anthpo on Alpharad and when i looked the first video i saw was this one. I watched a couple mintues of it but stopped because it really didnt mean anything at the time. Now it does. have a good one Anthpo. I might be starting college soon after a small break.
after watching the cult video i was very afraid this was gonna be a totally different upload 💀
its been 8 months man... we miss you
Freddy Mercury
you will probably never see this but I hope our doing well and achieve your dreams
We'll miss you man!
It's crazy how i only found this Chanel now, wish i saw it before
This makes me nostalgic for an adventure I didn’t experience, wish I had found this channel earlier.
I'm a very sickly person, always in bed, homeschooled, and yet I still watch your videos at 2am, when I should be asleep. I have no friends that visit me, so I find comfort in you. Only discovering now that you graduated, I want to be happy, but I have to feel a bit of sorrow as well since one of my favorite YouTubers is no longer Youtubing. Thank you, for everything.
so… now what
8 months later and I'm still emotional 🥺😭 we all still wish you the best and I hope we can see you again one day friend 🥺❤❤
Just posted on his story about May 14th so new content coming soon??👀👀
I hope Anthpo is doing good! :D
This is sad, I just found this channel and watched the Deli video and got hooked on how you breakdown everything and the flow of the video, wisg i could have been here for the journey  Take care wish you the best
Coming back 8 months later, I’ve really missed anthpos videos. Hope he’s doing good in life, much love man. So emotional to see where you started from, with the highschool videos all the way to graduating from college. Your videos never fail to pick me up when I’m feeling down in life.
Man, I can't believe its over. I haven't watched you in a year, now its over. We will miss you, you legend.
"Bro literally said go and get a life 💀"🤓👆
I’m just glad we have a time capsule of these moments. That’s for all the laughs anthpo
wow 8 months allready Anthony we miss you and hopefully you come back one day thanks for all the great content over the years.
People please I preach to you out of love belive on the lord jesus christ and trust in him for you salvation and not in yourself christ came to die for our sin we have all sinned and deserve hell but god is so merciful and jesus died on the cross to take our punishment so that who ever belive on him will not perish but have eternal life john 3:16 romans 10:9 if we confess with our mouth jesus is lord and belive in our heart that god rose him from the dead we will be saved we can not earn salvation it is the free gift from god
❤
Is he coming back? :/
this channel made me nostalgic for things i've never experienced. Thank you Anthony <3
brrrrrdfrdr
I just discovered his channel and found out that he quitted :(
This video kicked off YouTubers retiring in 2024
bro ill beat the shit out of you if that time capsule dont come in 9 years
i would have been a different person if not for yt suggesting that phineas and ferb video
Anthony, I love how this page of your life ended with a bang! Quite a good sight to see among the sad retirement vids that have popped up on trending. I sincerely hope you're making a good life for yourself out there!
wow i watched this back after 8 months and it still hit the same 😢 we miss you anthpo
It's crazy to think about how hes been gone for 8 months I really miss 😢
Bro I need him back :(((
:(
Ive only  just watched two videos.... to start. But thankyou ❤
it's crazy to think it's all over, i know i'm just a drop in the ocean that is ur viewers but ur channel meant so much to me. watching u grow and change, add new people to the cinematic universe was such a journey. ur channel made me start documenting more, taking pictures any chance i could. weather it was a small hangout or a school dance, i made sure to make a memory out of it. thank you anthony, for changing mine and so many other peoples lives
this is sad
0:37 this shot is so pretty
🧌 a moment
I miss you Anthony😭😭😭
I’m so glad you graduated! You started off as some perry the platypus cosplayer in high school, now look at you, a college graduate. Good luck out there! I wish you the best and most successful future.    (Sorry that I’m late, I didn’t know 😔)
I've watched this a few times. Found some of your high school videos years ago, and instantly loved them. Miss you, man. Kick ass out there!
Definitely gonna make a channel like this when me and my friends are in college. We all have plans to go to the same one so hopefully we all do :D
It's been 8 months since this vid, and i honestly stitll miss him. I hope he's doing good!
I still miss you Anthony Po
alright you can stop the bit now
Chills man.
Somethimes you gotta close a door to open a window.....
Finally watched this video and the baqunet video I watched his channel from senior year through a bit of community college right now I’m working. I actually teared up watching these becuase even though I haven’t lived the “college experience” like anthpo and his friends it was like I was actually there now it feels like I’m closing a chapter on my life and opening up a new one. Can’t wait to see what will happen next in years to come.
No... it cant be...
I haven’t even watched you in months and I still cried
First matpat and then Lynja and now... :'( but congrats! I will love and miss this cahnnel forever..
(Wow I can’t believe its almost gonna be 9 months since this. Time moves too quickly) I know it gets annoying when you hear this but I’ve been watching you since back in highschool where you would dress you as perry the platypus. I loved your content and watching you’re videos inspired me to do better in life and that life isnt all that bad. I’ll still keep watching your videos no matter what, I wish the best for you in life thanks for everything dude❤
i miss you 🥲
I just subscribed damn
I love this channel as I found it randomly year back and it is so sad to see this adventure. The best video was “Hot dog at my school”, one of my favorite raps, pleas make into a song that would be great lol🌭🌭🌭<3. Goodbye never forget this man.
WHAT
Thank you for sharing all those wonderful videos, they really lightened my days! I wish you all a good life and only the best! 🍀✨
NOOOOO YOU HAVENT MADE SEASON FOUUUUUUUUR
WHY ARE YOU LEAVING US 😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Hearing this as a highschool student lost asf and not knowing what I wanna do as a living this really helped me

Come on, l literally just found this channel🙁   and i knew i will love it It's not fair 🙁 Anyway,i wish you the best 🌸
Hi

w8ing for time capsule
Happy New Year Anthpo! Life's been pretty tough to adjust without someone to brighten up your day as much as you.<3 Thank you for being a genuinely huge inspiration in my life and in many others. On the behalf of others, I wish you a very happy new year, and the bestest of luck for you, your family and your friends.  And for the last time, I give this to you with all the love and admiration in my heart, thank you❤

wow
I just found this channel today and now I find out it's over. Ah well, at least there's a backlog.
wtf ive missed out
why end the channel after college?
It’s just over?
It’s a new year and I always come back to you thank you for taking us along with you for your adventures it truly felt like we were involved like we were apart of the friend group ourselves love you man
most impressive part to me is that he actually left. a lot of people want to stay in the spotlight but he chose to leave and archive all his good memories
I just subscribed this channel, then I saw this video…  appreciate your hard work!!
damn i just descovered your channel but I hope you do well in life the videos I've seen have been hilarious
GODDANNGIT, I'm late to the party. I just stumble upon your question crew videos man.
I literally found this channel today and was ready to subscribe 😭
I finally came back to watch all his old videos and.. I really can’t believe he’s done
we miss you and hope your adult life is going great
I just found your channel again but i found out you leaving it was nice watching you and a fun journey watching, laughing, and seeing you improve your work i miss your content but you have to leave things behind sometimes bye. 👋
You have given many people light in their lives that they didn't originally have at some times. I want to thank you, and wish you the best.
huh lol
Now that there's a goodbye, the whole journey feels like a movie.
I hope one day Anthpo uploads again just to show us what he has accomplished in life, that would be awesome!
Bro I randomly remembered that this channel existed and was like why have I not gotten any notifications in a long time? Come over to see the goodbye video was uploaded on my birthday. 😢 I loved this channel so much as someone who was watching since fat Yoshi this is really bittersweet to see.
Damn bro… what a ride
Damn I still can’t believe I had his snap before he stopped accepting
Thanks for the Shinkeki No Budjet and Avatar Last Dollars for Budget, Anthony! I'm positive that you made millions of people, including me, smile, Good Luck in life!
Anthony has always been the main character, and even if we cant see what he is doing anymore im still convinved he will forever be the main character of this world
hope you had a good chrismas dude
bro i found this video by watching is ben 10 highschool video and went down a rabbit whole😭
i just got this video as a recommendation and im binge watching all the videos.
I noticed that every comment here has atleast one like, I know it’s unlikely but I like to think that it’s him, just coming back every now and again to see if people still remember him.
How does one throw away 2 million followers..
I hate how good you were at this because it makes me miss you just that much more
Still hurts
WHAT NOOOO I JUST DISCOVER YOUR CHANNEL FROM THE CULT VIDEO 😢 but hey, I’m hoping the best for you man
I might've found this channel earlier than some people of here, i loved the way you did those videos about your life and doing the most funniest things with your friends. Sadly, i just found out today (12/25/2023) that you said a "goodbye" to this channel. I'm mostly sad but happy to see you graduate and being happy with your friends I love you and i wish you the best Anthpo, you were one of my favorite channels around Youtube wich i loved the most
still hurts man
It’s been 7 months since I last smiled
merry christmas po, we miss ya
hope he's doing ok
Thank you.
Its been 7 months.... i hope youre doing well
i cant believe hes gone. we will always remeber you anthony <3
It’s been 7 months I still think about it
This video still hurts 😢
Anthony godbye we hope the best for you
good luck and we love you Anthpo <3
He ended his Youtube Career as a hero.
I remember when the fat yoshi video came out
Dude I hope you're doing well! This has been a ride and a half it was so fun!!!
IM GONNA MISS U!! UR VIDS MADE ME FEEL BETTER WHEN I WAS AS MY LOWEST!!!!😭😭
I miss you and your Perry the platypus videos 😔
Maaan I’m so sad I just found this channel, but I’m glad I did. Its always nice to see someone just living life and accomplishing their goals. And even though there may not be any updates its still pretty cool to know that you’ll do great and your life is probably going to be full of fun and blessings even if you aren’t sharing them with us anymore. I’ve only watched two of your videos so far but I feel inspired to get my group of friends from college together from all the different states we are at and doing some spontaneous fun shit ❤️
i miss you
🎉
This goodbye video has a lot less views and public reaction then one would expect.
i found your channel today (actually knew other videos like the perry and fat yoshi one but didnt know it was you) and watching that is actually sad we will miss you
oh okay i wanted you to pursue but that's fine have a great life.
I wish you the best.
I just one video about joining a cult and then the conjuring and im super sad that hes not posting anymore:(
I am just now finding this channel, and I can't think of one better to summarize who and what I want to be. This man is an inspiration and a living legend, and I'm beyond excited to look back on everything that you've created here. Thanks Anthony.
i just found this account yesterday i didn’t know he was gone
So is he done with this channel?
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH I HATE MYSELF WHY DID I REWATCH ALL HIS VIDEOS I KNEW I WAS GOING TO CRY
Thanks Anthpo
oh a good youtuber (sees this video) *fu-*
:(
so i found this channel watched a few videoes loved it and decided to subcribe clicked on his pfp and this video showed up.
why did i only discover this channel today this guys videos are so entertaining noooo 😭😭
This is six months old and I’m still crying in the club rn
we miss youuuuuu
I literally just started watching you...
This is my first video what is this channel about
Even after six months I'm still crying.
Don’t cry over what was, be happy that it happened, and that y’all got to see him, i found this channel 2 months after this video
Its sad to see this channel go even though its been 6 months
I just refound this channel dang
i just watches the cult video after it came up in my recommended and this is the next video from this channel that ive watched
i found this channel today after having an epiphany that my college life was bland. seeing a goodbye video as i am about to graduate and knowing this chapter ends for all college students was very reassuring to me, i’m happy to be an unseen comment
I LITERALLY FOUND THIS GUY THE DAY HE POSTED THIS VIDEO IM SO SAD I DIDNT FIND HIM SOONER😭😭
good for you & thank you!
💔
Negawatt I just found this channel.
Why did he stop uploading?
Bye and be good.
Please come back 😭
Which video is the one where he was traveling in the beginning of the video. I son't think I have ever seen that video before.
Does anyone know his other Socials or somthing 😭 Idk I find him fun to watch
Good riddance
Rip I literally just found this channel 20 mins ago 🤣
goodbye man
Hello Anthony attack on titan is finally over really hoped you could've singed my war and rumbling but hey im proud of ya man goodbye :)
i still miss you bro and will forever respect the grind
6 Months Later and i have watched all his videos and still can't believe he's  gone );
We miss you. You’ve made us smile and now your gone
Anthpo, all I can really say is that what you have created here, this community you have brought together, the videos you've made, and the overall joy you have given to so many people.. It's all a true representation of what life itself is and what it looks like. The beauty of being yourself, experiencing the lows and highs of life, it's what ultimately brings us together as a community in the end and makes life what it is. You are such an amazing person, not that you haven't been told that already, and I am so glad we got to share all of this with you. Safe travels, even if you don't see this, and keep being great.
aw man, im going to miss this content
Come back!!!
So far it’s been sixth month since you’ve quit and it’s still hard to see the goodbye video as the top one. Your videos represent college life so well and this video perfectly resembles the bittersweet ending and reminiscing. I’m excited to rewatch this when I graduate college and feel the same bittersweet moment. Cheers to new chapters
I arrived on the channel today and I already miss you so much bro :(
I goon to this video to cope
Wait, so you quit making videos and going to college?
Your videos have been periodically popping up in my recommended page throughout 4 years, and it's crazy to realize that I've been watching someone half a world away from me go through an entire stage in their life. I'm graduating HS in 6 months and I feel like you kinda made me prepared for what I'm about to experience in college. It was a nice ride, thanks for everything. <3
why did i have to find this channel then see this 💔
God damn man you were awesome thanks for everything!
I'm still waiting for haikyuu
missing anothpo and crew hours
Ive never seen this guy before but now im in tears.
cozy
Nah i just wanna know why he quit and left
RIP 🪦
i guess
wait what. i just found this dude today
Now its time to go live yours......That hits so hard.
Sadly, Youtube Recomended me this 6 months later.   Im happy for you, it was alot of fun. I hope that you have a great life
I just found this channel today and he’s been gone since 6 months ago 😫
so did he make a channel just to show what he did during college? never heard of him till now?
good riddance
Thank you anthpo, you’ve done so much for the viewers and me.❤
Plot twist he left YouTube to join the twelve tribe cult he visited months prior
not me finding his account just now and loving him, for me to see that he ended 😭
It’s been 6 months and I’m still waiting to hear from Anthony again we love u ❤
i just watched your cult vid and this, being the second vid i've watched kinda made me 📈📉☹️ felt like an any% speedrun ngl
we miss you
6 months man
six months and counting...
merry early christmas!
Now this, this is what youth feels like. I'm definitely 4 years younger than you but would've loved to have had the same confidence and goofyness you've had. I'll try in college though.
Im sorry if im late, hope you're doing alright. You have a bright future Anthony.😇🙏
I only recently found your channel but let me just say your an inspiration man, and I mean that your content is engaging and creative you have a great personality. Really what inspired me the most was that you were a student at Rutgers a college not very far from me. Im currently a college student myself and watching your videos gave me the confidence to take that leap and buy my first camera so for that I thank you Anthpo.
pls come back anthony !! maybe a single upload every month or 2 months
i only found this channel a good hour ago and honestly some really fun content. i really hope anthony is doing well in life :)
hello! just came across your channel from the cult video, i hope youre doing okay!
but i just found this channel
Thank you Anthony for making me laugh and smile so many times, I think you are amazing and you inspire me to do stuff I wouldn't usually do and try to be  more confident. you inspire me so much that you even make want to go to college! (because you make it look fun), I know its not only having fun with friends and it costs money and stuff but that's not the point, you make me wanna just leave the unimportant things and go out and make new memories with friends and film it all.  Thank you for everything, you continue to be my favorite content creator, Because of your content but I think you take the number 1 spot because of you personality and your way of looking at life you are much more unique, you are just a fun person and you look like a person everybody would like to know and have you as a friend.  Again, thank you for everything, and Good Luck :)
i still miss you
I will miss you Anthony 🥺
Its been 6 months Anthony i miss you so much when ever i am sad i watched your videos i cant believe its been 6 months already anyway i hope ur life is good
this would be a crazy story for your kids just imagine showing how loved you were and how you had such a big legacy in your college years.
I miss him
Its a joke yall
Cant he be just a full time YouTuber?Hes already gained so much😭
Dude, I'm just getting to know your channel :((((
its been 6 months man,  wishing you the best future. Thank you.
I just found this channel and ive got to say im sad it has already come to an end. Glad I got to see his journey
I feel like time went by SOSO fast. Wishing you the very best Anthony, you made me smile with everything you’ve posted throughout the years and you yourself have gone so far. Love you lots!
Its been 6 months hope this guy is doing well
Noooo
I cant believe its been 6 months . Lord
All my fucking favorite YouTubers have been leaving I’m sobbing
Man, dad's taking a while to come back with the milk
Wow its been 6 months and it feels like only 6 days, thank you Anthony.
I still cant believe this but im so grateful i got to see this videos and get up and inspired😢❤
its been 6 months
That's awesome! The best channels are the ones with an end in mind.
I'm not crying....   After seeing the traction and views he was getting, I thought there would be no way he ended the channel upon graduating...   We need him way more than he needs us. Damn that sounds like my last relationship. Now I'm crying for real.
Spy gaming
Goodbye I guess
Bro when he said "Now its time to go live yours" It was like gold roger telling me to go and find the one piece
Its.. almost 2024 I havent forgot about you
im sorry but you forgot attack on titan season 4 all episodes
Something I realized is that for most youtubers, graduating college is the beginning of their youtube career. For anthrop it's the end of the youtube career but a beginning for a new life
Its been 6 months, still cant believe you are gone. Sure im feeling sad but we all know u will do good things in the future and we are all proud of you and how far youve come. Ive gotta say ive even grown up with this channel. Definitely my favourite youtuber, cant think of anyone better. So long anthony, do good in your story.
so hard to believe it's already been 6 months
missing the videos
OMG I swear to God, I saw you on campus back in March but I go Rutgers I'm a sophomore now and I've been watching your channel forever. I didn't realize that you went to rutgers to thank you for being such a cool person and having awesome videos. Hope to see you around. Best wishes keep doing you.
Gracias por lo videos tan divertidos
Thx for the laughs bud❤
i miss you
Ant, if youre reading this, i hope if you ever feel down, that you can read our comments. we all have our regrets, like you wishing you werent so shackled to youtube, but you made lives better for everyone around you. thank you.  its gonna be half a year since this video was posted soon, and ive recently gotten back to watching his videos again. i think it was the return of OKPOP that reminded me of Ant's videos.  all that i can say is, we hope youre doing well, man. keep on going. o7
keep harassing ppl with fat Yoshi. we will mis you 😔
How has it already been 5 months, it feels like we JUST said goodbye to our internet funny man
Goodbye...
But who will make the AOT for season 4 😭😭😭😭😭
Already been 5 months…
I miss the anthpo cinematic universe 😔
I don’t accept this until attack on titan season 4 be like comes out
Bruh I’m 5 months late 💀   Bye bye Anthpo, hope you had a great time with us 🎉 And a great time in college… or high school I forgor
I don’t know shit but damn 🎉
Never finshed every episode of aot
i found him way too late :(
Why are you quitting YT!
Man I didn’t realise I would miss Anthpoe’s videos this much.
Found out I went to Highschool with this guy after recognizing the school in the background in one of the senior prank videos. Even found myself asleep at lunch in the background
Dude! Come back and do ONE last video for Attack on Titan Season 4!!!!
I’ll never get season 4 of the Attack on Titan Parody series 😨
o7
So Total Drama Small Town Isn’t Coming
i still miss him
<3
nononnoooo every episode of attack on titan
ANTHONY! ATTACK ON TITAN SEASON 4 IS DONE GET BACK HERE!   Also R.I.P.
It was amazing to watch your life even if it was for a short time, it was amazing!
no shot its been 5 months. holy shit time has moved so fast
He is gone 🥲
Why did you quit YouTube?
Look I respect your decision, but what about every episode of attack on titan season 4?
I really hoped this channel would go on it was such an amazing channel. And I’m happy that it happened but sad it ended.
I just started watching you and now i know this will be the last video i will see of you
Noooooo keep making perry videos I believe you please not give up thank you 😢😢
I didnt want to watch it when it came out because i was sad that he was leaving - but here i am, five months later. I wasnt there for the whole ride, but I enjoyed every video that I did watch. I think what made his videos special was how genuinely fun and wholesome they were. They truly felt like he was taking us on a journey with him, and we got to peek into his life and the lives of his friends. His videos were also meaningful and had a commin theme of putting yourself out there and living your life to the fullest, which I appreciate. I think giving his channel a proper ending gave it an impactful meaning, just like with Unus Annus by Mark and Ethan. Its meaningful and beautiful because it had an end, a purpose. His videos also showed me how fun life can be if you put in the effort and time to turn something ordinary into something special by sharing it with those you care about.  Thank you for all the laughs and for all the heartwarming moments.   P.s. im glad he didnt private or delete the videos, so we can rewatch them if we want.
Ngl his banner make it sadder
Sayonara...
this was the happiest montage ive ever seen
and here i was just looking for the guy who made the funny mystery gang yellow deli video :( congrats on graduating dude!
most wholesome quit i've ever seen
Already 5 months wow

He Left as things started to pick up!
I'm already 5months late but i didn't want to miss saying goodbye to Anthony. A lot of people have already said so many heartwarming things and mine probaly won't amount to them ever but i just wish the best for everyone Anthony and his friends and anyone who's reading this comment i wish the best to all of you. Anthony has probably made all of us and me laugh and smile with all his hilarious, heartwarming videos. In my lowest lows and my highest highs I've watched Anthony's videos and laughed and cried. In the end I'm glad he has a new bright start in life even if i miss him I wish him best of luck in life.Thank you Anthony and everybody.
This channel is very nostalgic and stuff, but man I'm gonna miss this

damn i miss him. hope you and your friends are doing well
Holding my breath until he comes back
What happened to him???
he was actually the main character
Truly tho i think you gotta do a reunion in like idk 1 year? 2,3 idk but do a reunion
Okay, we get it now. You can come back!
Miss you and your incredible energy so much it’s so bittersweet. Hope everything is working out and you’re living a happy, eventful, and successful life 💕💕
Anthpo will go down as one of the best YouTubers of all time
Anthpo will go down as one of the best YouTubers of all time
It’s been almost half a year already since you quit bro I swear it felt like a month ago
I really miss you man, congratulations and I wish you the best for the future,
Haha very funny Anthpo it’s been five months, you can quit with the joke now lol. anthpo?
A quote from Spider-Man Far From Home, "Everywhere i go, i see his face." Because i still get his videos in my for you page. I will miss Anthpo and hopefully everyone is doing great.
Truly one hell of a ride
We'll miss you, man.
WHAT!?
Coming back to this video just to know how it feels to lose all of my friends again, which will happen in 2 weeks.... Shit.  How are you doing, future me?
we'll miss you
4 months
We defo need a life update video in about 10 years
Sometimes I run through the park in the 2nd clip and think of this video
It's been 4 months since this video came out, and I just remembered this channel existed, and I'd forgotten how much it means to me. I first discovered Anthpo when I wasn't doing too well in life, and y'all genuinely helped me through that. Now I'm going to college soon, I just hope I'll be able to have some fun while I'm there. I doubt my comment will stand out in the sea of others just like it, but if any of you guys are going through some shitty times. Trust me, it gets so much better, you just have to find the people who're willing to help you make it better. Also, to this wonderful community. I don't know any of y'all, but I can confidently say you're all amazing human beings who deserve the world, love you guys <3
4 months but I always rewatch his videos <3
it's been 4 months and i miss him already
i still cant belive it
It's been 4 months, thank you man. Still miss you :]
Ad Victoriam brother
I still can’t believe this was 4 months ago it feel like a year 😞
I’m a few months late but you definitely deserve it Anthony congratulations and I hope you live your to the fullest P.S. tell Paul I said hi
gawdamn
I JUST FORWARDED SOMEBODY WHO.THAT I LOVES THEIR CONTENT NOW YOUR GONE😢 it’s ok ty you for making my day you seem like wonderful person ❤ love stranger!
I’m gonna remember that one minute of adventure time summary badly when ice king said I’m gonna torture you with gender bend fan fiction
If he's a college graduate why is he quitting like he can still continue right?
Lil bro come back 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Four months has passed. Never uploaded after graduation. Still one of my favorite Youtubers.
its already been 4 months since this video came out wow
cant belive its been 4 months
I watched this the second I was heading off to college ironically 😭
Still here reminiscing
You would have to be pretty stupid to give up a opportunity in the top 3%
Who knows maybe he’ll return one day?
I cant believe Anthony left Smosh again
We love you have a good life
😭🫡
It took me 4 months to watch this video I just couldn’t gather the will to, but honestly I’m so happy I did
R.i.p of a area
~ Time is an illusion that helps things make sense So we are always living in the present tense It seems unforgiving when a good thing ends But you and I will always be back then You and I will always be back then ~  See you whenever.
Been here since near the begining bitter sweet to see it end but glad it was on your own terms. Goodbye!
Im revisiting this a few months later, as im once more feeling sentimental
Can’t believe it’s already been 4 months:( so long anthopo
raised me through middle school and i graduate in two years now lol have a good one anthony
i just had to find the channel after it already ended😭😭
I'm Going to miss this man,  not going to lie tho totally wanted to see more total drama backyard. But to give this man credit he actually did leave youtube (hopefully) Not a lot of people can say they became a niche internet celebrity and left willingly.
Anthpo come back we miss you
four months
The best type of college experience
Okay, GOODBYE. From today I want to live every moment.
the Anthpo channel was like UNNUS ANNUS: amazing (arguably legendary) content, while it lasted, but all good things must come to an end, as time continues forwards…   live your best life, Anthpo, and best of luck to you in your future pursuits
God I miss him
GOOD LUCK!!!! Anthony with how your life is going, I really hope your doing well<3(I also got a national warning test while writing this soooo)
Thank you for your work bro!  Your's adventure time serues and others make me to not kill my self and fight against my heavy god damn depression, and now maybe im still same shit as before, but im still alive and live is pretty cool shit. Tahnks to you and your friends, you save my live and im not kidding, thats great to find so positive freaks like you in the internet when end is so near Good luck in future life bro. Thank you so much. Btw, the girl who plays Marceline is the most beutiful women i ever seen on my eyes and im fall in love so hard, yo girl call me xD <3
I can't wait for anthpo 2: from job application to retirement.
I watched him when he first started to make videos and I just found him again and I’m starting high school
Coming back to watch vids
A true goat,I’m sad you’re gone but I’m glad you can get a career
I'm back here after 4 months
At the time I’m commenting this it’s been about 4 months since he uploaded this, I found anthpo when he was in his sophomore year of college I believe and he has always been funny. Hope one day when your comfortable with social media again maybe you’ll come back. We can only hope
I miss you ❤
miss u bro
I miss Anthony
Thank you Anthony
Come back 😢
Please don’t go we are not ready but we have to be so O7
Its been 4 months and i miss it
I dont wanna say goodbye
rip fly high🕊🕊🕊
He never finishes aot recaps
Perry to platapus
I literally just found this channel, why do I keep missing everything?
Man this hit like a truck filled with bricks, I wanna say thank you, you’re content helped me through highschool, I’ve just started college myself and I’m feeling better then ever, you’re videos showed me how exciting life can be and they always helped me when I was down and out of it, thank you so much
You've done your life well. Now it's time to live it. You got this, bro. Thanks for all this. <3
When i first saw this video, i didn't fell like i had the importance to comment on it. I now feel sad that i didn't and didn't  care enough to understand the video.
It was nice knowing ya anthony
I'll miss anthpo fr and the funny part is i know this mf's cuz the " perry the platypus " video fr :]]]
I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE IT HAS BEEN SO LONG WITHOUT YOU ON THIS PLATFORM.  Anthony if you see this, I want to thank you for making people's lives just that bit  happier.   Live long and Prosper. ❤❤❤❤
I miss your videos so much anthony ❤
Nice outfit
This keeps on appearing in ny tl, but i deliberately avoid it because I'm not really ready yet and finally watching it just made me cry. You will always be a bug part of my life
here 4 months later. I miss your scooby videos
Wait, did you end this channel _because_ of graduation?!
I don’t even know you, but gb ig
I watched the fat yoshi video when i was a child, and i just randomly stumbled into ur channel, and for some reason i decided to see what ur first video was. I really hope i get to be as happy as you were and have friends like you had in school
I feel so stupid because this is four months old and I didn’t even know this was going on and now im all sad😭😭😭😭😭 he was so funny I’ll miss him
I just now found out about this channel and it's been over for 4 months? Maaaan
Please don't leave come back soon
It’s been 4 months since this video and well, I really miss him still he was on of if  not the best YouTuber in my book
I’ve watched Anthony since the fat yoshi video came out and showing it to my friends in highschool. I thought his sense of humor was amazing and it brightened me up in one of the darkest couple of years in my life. All I gotta say is we will miss you Anthony. You have a gift and I know you are using it for a lot of good!
I didn’t even realize you left 4 MONTHS AGO! I’m gonna miss ya, man. Thank you, Anthony.
don’t cry because it ended, smile because it happened
I hope Anthony is doing alright, it’s a big adjustment going from having fun in school for all those years and then going into the working world. I feel everyone has this feeling, it can be lonely for a time but it takes time to enjoy the new things around in your life. I hope you never stop having fun!
I came back here because I just listened to okpop after finding it on my Spotify following even though I joined the journey pretty late I still miss anthpo and I wish he'd come back sooner
It’s been 4 months. Why do I still expect a new video tomorrow.
Damn I’ll miss this channel. So many great vids and good times.
This feels like a climax of a movie where the main character defeats the final villain and saved the world
Even of we never see you again, we will always remember all of the amazing moments you shared with your audience. Best of luck to anything you put your mind to.
🥹
can't fathom he's gone, like gone? like real gone. like like dissapeared, like like
Just found your stuff ,, I wish you made more Adventure Time videos , but I hope whatever you do , I hope your happy and having fun 😊.
hey anthpo, i know you probably won’t see this and that’s okay but i just wanted to let you know your impact on my life. 4 years ago i watched the fat yoshi video for the first time, i was 11, and i thought it was the funniest shit i’ve ever seen, and so i just continued watching. only a couple years ago i got my yt acct and i finally subscribed and i was so happy to find a new youtuber i enjoyed. i remember i got really invested in your content with the ATLA series, and when you got into college i realized i wanted my life to resemble yours. last year i decided i was going to have fun and do wild shit with my friends and be stupid, and that landed me in a 3-day stay at the psyche ward LMFAO. now i’m 15, i’m in my first year of community college and honestly it’s not everything i wish it was. i wake up everyday and go to my first class, do my homework, then go to my second class, then go to bed and repeat. i still wish my life resembled yours in the way you could make friends and have fun with them. i know i’ll have to wait but until then i’m still going to watch my favorite youtuber have fun with his friends, go to college, attack people with a zucchini, and have presentation nights. i hope you’re doing well anthpo,  sincerely, someone who wants to bring people happiness just like you have<3
I remember getting recommended fat yoshi, I thought about how some people really do live life to the fullest and as an introverted person, I actually started to get out of my shell a bit because of that video, I just found this today and definitely want to say, happy graduation
I mainly remember you from Jimmy Zhang’s IRL Yugioh battle playing Joey Wheeler. You’re an amazing personality period.
Goodbye agent P
I will be waiting for the april fool's day 2024 video
Bro it's crazy that it's already been four months since this channel has ended. This channel was something else, it was one of the most entertaining channels I have ever watched.  Especially the Mystery gang stuff they did.
I literally just found you and now i figure your gone
:(
dude i just discovered ur channel
This is just a beginning of your new adventure Anthony. See you later old friend 👍 And thank you for everything
It’s been 4 months ago, I miss these videos for 2 years he has been making videos, and he finally graduated 😢
Why would you quit doin this.
I should've worked harder in high school so I could've gotten my own college years  Instead I just work all the time now  When instead I could be *making* something
I hadn’t seen you on my fyp for a while and when i search you up i see this. Goodbye and good-luck.
I guest that's how a end😢
Good bye man, We will all miss you
god i  wished i stumbled upon this channel a long time ago
Oh snap!!!! I didn't even realize he was gone!! Thank you for all the laughs man ❤
🥨Pretzel🥨
Congratulations  and to meany days ahead of all of us
Oh man ❤
Come back I want to see your video
I’m back to just enjoy seeing you grow up
Anthony, we love you. It is genuinely smart that you not only will go out with a bang, but your mental health will still be okay. So long.
In a time were youtube became videos about money and creating a big network you bring it back to its roots making videos about having fun with your friends and just having a good time. Thanks for sharing that.
stuck around for since 2017, always missing your awesome videos
Your telling me you made your girlfriend the doormat of your channel? Wooooww... /j/j
Goodbye anthpo
Today I discovered your channel and I liked it so much I started watching a bunch of these videos. Then, I saw this video. It's hard to say goodbye. Watching your videos I really felt like I was in the video itself and it was awesome. Congratulations on your graduation. I hope you compete your dreams
Those were fun videos dude
I am sad, I just found this guy :(
And when we needed him most he was there and we miss him now that he has vanished

The amount of fun i’ve experienced in this channel made me what i am and i am happy for who i am, once again, bye mr anthony.
See, the problem is. I don’t have a life.
found this channel two minutes ago, already crying.
Alr I guess I’ll leave a comment since this is the last ever video anthpo will ever make🫡   I’ll miss them but It’s life gotta move on at some point and I feel like we should all say our final goodbyes and live our life’s like how they lived there’s   Goodbye anthpo you made me smile,laugh,sad,and cry but overall you make my 2021-2023 a lot better🫡🫡
👍
Big chunk of my life

🫡
the saddest day of my life hearing this him dressing up as perry the platypus is what i would watch to make me happy when i was because it always made me laugh. we'll miss you anthpo.
I've put off watching this video for a really long time. I had gotten attached to the channel ever since the 'cult' video, and since then, have watched every single video. It's been months since this was released, but now I'm catching up, and it feels like such a great watch.
yo the frick hes still gone
Damn I came back and half expected to see new content. Kinda heartbreaking but also really beautiful. What incredible content you made over the years and letting it go and just live on without continuing to add is a beautiful thing
Goodbye, our friend.
So is he not posting anymore
you will forever be missed.
Damn I just discovered your Chanel ;-;
We fr just watched bro grow up
This has been my comfort channel, the only one that brought me back to easy simple days of YouTube where every silly thing was possible so thank you!
Darn.. i would occasionally watch some of your videos these past four years, kinda makes me wish i went to college just to have friends and fun like you did. Thank you for making all these videos, congratulations on graduating college, i hope you have a good life
It’s joever
I just found you bro already saying goodbye ?
This video restores my faith in life and love and fun and what it is to be young! ✨✌️🙌
come back pls  i
Good luck on future adventures dude, thanks for living life and sharing it for the people who couldn’t
I literally started crying and this really inspired me to start living my life thank you Anthony thanks man!
bye
My favourite thing about scrolling through this comment section is I cant find a single negative comment and I love every single one of you guys for that, thank you all and thank you Anthony for being part of our lives I hope we can all prosper :))
Miss you bro
Sorry if this is a late comment, but congratulations on graduating! Have an awesome life, anthpo.

Oh no my friends, they in fact always come back. Maybe not doing the same genre of content but it always happens.
s0 he’s gone forever?
You were and still are my favorite YouTuber since day one. Your Avatar videos were my favorite and I still watch them on repeat as I do your others. I know I’m a bit late on saying this, but thank you for an amazing four years. Hope we can see you again in the future 💜
Miss you man youtube will never be the same without you
I came back to this video I last time, wishing it was fake, but it wasn't.
:0
i don't have a story
that's what a rainbow looks like
I watched one video and then saw this goodbye. Don't have a clue how we got here, but sad all the same
3 months after and we all miss you Anthpo
Thank you for everything. I've been with you since your high school days. It's been a wild ride, godspeed.
bye, hope you make content again, you're good at it
Willing to bet when he’s broke in 3 years he comes back
cant believe i fucking find this channel today, and, is also iconic that the number of views of the video is the same as subscribers . . . i will miss you guy, even just knowing you today. Cant wait to see previous videos.
Damn its been three month. Wow .
thank god
I know i'm really late but your videos have made me laugh so much, and whenever i watched them, they have always been the highlight of my day and sometimes my week or even my month. I can't believe you're gonna be gone now, but you have been one of my favorite creators ever that always made me laugh. We love you anthony, and goodbye.
Isn't that the Hxckno user?
i had to pause a couple of times bc the emotions were overwhelming lol
Wow I am now emotionally destroyed I had been wondering what happened to you think oh surely he still has time but I was really wrong and it’s gonna be tough man now that you’re gone I remember near the beginning when you started I watched you and it was just pure joy you are so funny and honestly will be missed you were a great part of YouTube one day I hope you come back but at the same time you did everything you wanted so thank you Anthpo for being one of the funniest people to bless the earth

its already been 2 months - wow
This is so sad. I just discovered you. 🥲
We all miss you Anthony im not ready to say goodbye😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Goodbye
Been watching you since you were in high school and now you’re a college graduate? Wow. Thanks for everything, all the very best
no, its not okay to not be okay, feeding people that idea will just keep them depressed and down and possibly develop further problems with themselves which will hurt them further. if you have a problem you need to find the root and figure out how to help yourself to get through what youre going. keep trying and you will succeed eventually.
I know ive already commented but GOD DAMN IT I REWATCHED IT AND NOW IM UPSET AGAIN. AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Dude, good luck.
dang i legit just found his channel
I’ve always thought that the end would show that nothing could come after. But you proved me wrong right now by showing me how can anyone make his story full of crazy things like yours. I wish you a long and happy life
I still miss his video's D:
i jist found out abt thsi channel today and today itself i find out that theyre not doing vids anyomore :")
all it took was watching a few videos today only to be upset about this—
I hope we never forget Anthpo
Dang bro all I did was watch your Perry the platypus video
I don't even know why I came back to this video maybe I wanted a quick laugh but I don't know maybe I thought you uploaded a new video which clearly didn't happen maybe I didn't say goodbye although I probably did goodbye anthony see you next time I want to laugh.
Thanks for the memories anthpo 💗💗💗
Not fair... I JUST DISCOVERED YOUR CHANNEL MAN!!!
I am gonna miss this channel a lot this was one of my favorite YouTubers, it took me 2 months to decide to comment on this
2months later and this is hitting so hard man we miss you
I want him to come back in 50 years as an old man
Is he leaving YouTube he was the best
F**k 😢
two months have passed and i already miss the bastard  hope you have a good life bro!
DW guys he’s just going to stop Dr. Doofenshmirtz and come back.
Just realized he grew a fanbase without being cancelled or getting into drama like- ever
Crazy how life can seem so simple and joyful for this guy on YouTube having great experiences, making money, graduating college, moving on, when most of us in the world are just trying to get by everyday, most of us try and avoid wars in out country, most of us try and get out of our country, there is no college, no good or bad times. You are so privileged and you are lucky and I wish I was like you
NO INTERNET FOR 2 MONTGS AND ANTHPO GO BYE BYE
I’m going to be quite honest I saw this video but I never actually watched it. It took me two months to process before I could finally bring myself to actually watch this and I just want to say thank you this whole time you’ve been on YouTube this whole time you’ve been making content your entire platform it’s always just brought a smile to my face and it’s sad to say goodbye but it’s part of life. Goodbye.
i just found this channel 20 minutes ago🥲😭
I just found your channel today with the cult video and thought man I gotta subscribe to this dude, then I saw this video. Its kinda poetic how that all ended so quickly but I am very grateful to have been part of this, even for a little while, and I wish you the absolute best on the rest of your journey.
i just binged the entirety of the anthpo cinematic universe and now feel empty. it feels like i graduated without even graduating man
Fucking finally, you were losing your head
wait, anthpo and Janice were dating?

We all still commenting in 2023 this channel still entertaining us all. THNX Anthpo
Thx for everything
ANOTHY OFF OF HINGE AND POST 😭😭😭
Okey now i want to cry
I still miss this guy
im four years younger, and it’s been comforting watching anthpo graduate twice before me and do all these things first and have so much fun. thank you anthony, it’s been surreal watching you since i was in middle school now i’m going to college. you make it look like so much fun. i still watch you daily
wait so he gone? naw ik this boy lying aint no way he gonna leave with a mid exit
I miss him
I literally thought he died till I watched the video, but why does everyone have an understanding of why hes leaving cos i still don't get it....
😔
o7
can somebody explain to me what is happening? he decided to close youtube channel to pursue other work for which he got diploma or what?
This like unnas anus all over again
So long space cowboy. Here's to the next adventure.
I MISS U BROOO BUT GL WITH YO LIFEEE AND LIVE IT WELL
I’m not ready to say good bye, I’m a 17 year old baby, but honestly this was awesome, you were a big part in my life, congrats on graduating
2:45 That sentence just hit something inside of me. And I have the sudden urge to find out what....
so long king
Dudes so privileged and rich that he just throws away a YouTube career when 90% of people would kill to have a successful channel. Pretentious douche
Anthpo your probably not going to see this but I’ve been watching you since the zucchini video and you have changed who I am as a person I used to be always sad but now I’m happy and thankful for everyday
I'm sad to see this channel go...maybe Antho will one day make a new channel or maybe this is where his career or video making ends...no matter what path he takes, I hope he is happy. Just know, I'll always miss the hilarious moments.
✌🏻
If I was more outgoing and willing to record myself some more with the few moments I have with my friends I would do so to highlight some of our best moments in our young 20s.
Goodbye 😔
FFS, I just subbed to this channel & the 2nd video I see is this...
SHows over peoples
That clip of you with the trees n flowers ...thats buccluech park.. I fucking roller skate there all the time?!?!? How have I never seen you. You went to rutgers. That college is literally 20 minutes from where I live. You seem like such a dope person. It's crazy how the world is so big. Yet so small.  Hopefully you stick around in jersey for a little while. I'd love to meet you one day! I know this sounds way creepy from some internet stranger... but I swear I'm not a creep. Just a girl who enjoys your videos and had a hard time making friends lmao and you just seem like a lot of fun to be around and a sweet, caring person.   Congrats on finishing college! You're going places !
I miss you anthony
So this means no more videos
Sorry man even you and you put weird weird videos you still gonna be our fairy youtuber
Hey, Anthony thanks for the videos and the fun times you have shared with us and the ups and downs I'm gonna miss the videos. All i can say is, thank you.
can i?
Ideky
See ya
I'll miss thess guys...
Im a little late to this, but imma miss u and ur vids bro. Good luck in life!
Goodbye agent P
he never did the aot video
Noooooooooooo!!
I only recently found your channel after this video was made but trust me you will be missed and it’d be really cool if you ever came back
I hope I can have memories like these. I go to college in a month. We'll see.
Happy birthday ! Your birthday was yesterday !
Congrats! But I’m really going to miss this :( i wish you could still make videos, at least every once in a while?
i subbed from ur fat Yoshi vid, so glad ur doing well
Been here since the channel began and now its beautiful that its ending this way. Thank you for making videos that entertained us in a way no other channel could. We love you
Two months later, I’ve achieved my dreams of becoming just like Anthony by finding an Asian baddie to love and respect, Godspeed Anthony
I’m curious, what happened to him?
Its not about the end its about is
GOODBYE
Hi Anthpo. I want you to know that your videos are one of a few things that really changed me as a person in my teens. Along with some James Veitch videos, The Prestige, and a general boredom and lack of belief in objective meaning, they inspired me to make life more fun, which requires taking initiative and ignoring what's considered normal or reasonable. For instance, this easter, I hid plastic eggs around my campus. If you were to find one, you may initially be excited; there might be candy inside! And when you open it, your suspicion is confirmed: it appears there's gum or fruit snacks in there. But, alas, the wrapper is already opened, and the candy already eaten. Instead there's a note inside, which reads:  Dear whoever is reading this,  I gravely apologize for eating your candy. I’ve been stress eating a lot lately because I’m going through a terrible divorce and a custody battle over our 54 children.  Sincerely,  Craig Thompson (this part in hand-signed)  (the Easter Bunny)    Oh, and by the way, my account name isn't just a joke. I actually legally changed my name to Jo Mama.
why did this just now pop up? sad sad sad but also congrats! graduating is huge! being on the other side of it is momentous and enormous and wild and heartbreaking! always a fan, see you around the internet (every once in a while, hopefully) my good dude
I'm not even kidding, I'm watching this vid while this channel hitting 1.69M like.. congratulations bro and good bye 👋
Anybody else checking in after 2 months of the channel going dark?
Goobye Mr. Anthony Po

Happy trails man I wish you the best in your next endeavors bro
i only found this channel maybe like a fortnight or so ago, and coming across the question crew videos and the yellow deli's and conjuring house, and then finally coming across this video made me look back at your other content and i realised that even though i wasn't here at the start, you've been entertaining over 1 million people for the last four years. you're a great guy and i love your content, i wish you the best anthony 👍
Even though you left the channel this year, I bet you will keep on getting subscribers in the future. Cause I just found this channel today and I've become a subscriber. I can't believe how much comfort your videos have brought me. T0T
Ofc I find this channel as soon as it ends😢
Man. I am glad to see you succeed, but it will be sad not seeing anything new from this channel. I hope you have a great life. ✌🏿
I don't know if I can say this for being a new fan,I became a fan of yours when I saw haikyu,you are a really great inspiration and a YouTuber I admire,you made an impact on my life for being such a relatable man,and I think that you will do great in the future
kanye west graduation

No no no no no no no please no

I'm gonna miss this a lot but it being fleeting is part of what made it special.

I like to come back to this channel sometimes with hope that he came back to us.
I come back to this video every once and a while everytime I miss this guy
its been 2 months and its still hard to accept. Thank you for your videos dude, I hope life is going well for you.

Da fudge! I literally JUST found your channel!
2 month check in baby 🙏😭 so sad
Hopefully you come back and make future videos but until than thank you ❤  I’ve watched you for a while but I didn’t realize you made a farewell video 😭
Still cannot believe its been over two months since he left 😭
I just subscribed and you’re telling me that this is it no way 😭
No don’t leave I can’t say bye😢
Bro, why'd you have to leave now? You have 1.69M subscribers... The jokes would've gone crazy 😭
What a beautiful and wonderful experience the ride was, this video was sad but heartwarming, I love this guy, he is quite literally the embodiment of "go live life to the fullest" and "don't be sad because it's over, smile because it happened." I wish Anthony and anyone reading this comment the best in life.
:( gah dam this shit hurt more than my dad going to buy the milk :(
Goodbye, I’ll miss your videos,  good luck. I hope you do well further in your life.
recently dropped out of uni to start doing full time work, i completed only one year of uni but the memories and friends i made just in that one year is something that i will never forget. life gives you opportunities, could be a new job that you dream of, or the chance to dress up as perry the platypus, but know that making the most out of those opportunities is what shapes us as people and shapes our future. living life with no regrets and spending it with the people you care about are the biggest values of life in my eyes. thank you for sharing your journey with us Anthony.
Thanks anthony you're one of the best channels ive come across ❤
Feels kinda sad to be late to the party but, I’ll always remember your videos man
*you can hear baby blue start to play..you feel as if you’ve accomplished what you’ve wanted to..as if you died doing what you loved..*
PLEASE COME BACK ANTHPO PLEASE
Bye Anthony I will miss you and your shenanigans
I genuinely have not felt this much overwhelming emotion from a single youtube channel. Thank you and the gang for all the laughs and smiles you have given us. You are truly perfect and i speak for everyone when i say we hope you live a wonderful and perfect life because you are truly an amazing human being. All love to you and the friends you met along the way. thanks for everything ❤❤❤❤❤ (im crying my eyes out rn)
Even though I pretty much only arrived right before you left, This was a fun ride, no matter how late I got on the bus... Have a good future Anthony, enjoy your life :)
Best 2 years man goodbye man
come back plz i just found out w are bday twins
Not even kidding, I actually cried watching this
So he’s just leaving? 😓
Anthpo, by chance you see this comment, but knowing that there are thousands of comments on this video there’s a very slight chance that you see this one. I really appreciate your videos. They make me smile so much and ever since I discovered your channel, they’ve made me so happy. Every single video you’ve made has made me smile and you are the perfect content creator. I understand that you’ve graduated and you’ve decided that you don’t really want to upload anymore or that you’re not going to upload at all entirely. I know my opinion doesn’t really matter, but it really upset me when you told us that you weren’t going to upload anymore. if there’s any chance of you coming back to YouTube and uploading again and may it be by this comment, I just want you to know that you’ve done an amazing job you’ve changed my life personally and I know that you’ve change the lives of others as well and the advice and help you’ve given to everyone is absolutely amazing. And thank you personally for how much that you’ve helped me and how much of an impact your videos have had on me. Thank you for everything Anthpo <3
I hate this song

Found this channel just as i was entering my first year of high school. It's crazy that i am now graduated and moving on to university just as you did anthpo back when I started watching this channel. I really don't know what the future holds for me and I am scared. But, your videos have shown me the that there's always a bright side to life and that you can make life anything you want. Thank you for the fun antics that taught me so much about myself and life.   Thank you for being my greatest teacher through my darkest times! I wish you all the best in the future! :)
Can’t believe it’s been a month😢
We will miss you
-Fin

Thank you Anthony for making content that everyone can enjoy you will be missed from all of us
I found this channel when I was at my lowest of lows and seeing now that his college story is over, all I can say is thank you. I think I can speak for hundreds of people when I say I wish you the best. Sad you're gone, but glad you came. <3

Keep making
🦊
I just stumbled upon this amazing channel and it makes me quite sad to see that you’ve left, but good luck in the future!
Bruh I just found this guy
Well, guess what I was on my oculus. And someone was saying about my health and my family.
I wish he would make more content but everything comes to an end, this just came to an end a bit faster than most things

I hope you enjoy your life your videos have helped mine
good luck! :DD

I will miss you man....
Rewatching this hurts
I'm gonna rewatch all your vids now.
I miss you.
Wow, its already been a month. I cant believe it.
I can't believe it's already been a month
The "now its time to go live yours" hits hard as an incoming college freshman dude
I remember 3 years ago coming across your perry the platipus video and having the loudest laugh I had in a long time, I subscribed immediately. I never really watched all your videos and when I do is when it shows on my YouTube recommendations, but they make me laugh a lot, and by the end of it I feel kinda regretful for not enjoy my life as much. But this is good because it inspires me to go look after good memories.  Thank you so much for making me feel like this! Hope you have a great life from now on
It’s already been a month. I hope you’re all doing well.
It’s already been a month, but it feels like a decade
POV you just randomly stumbled across this video, and have no idea who this guy is. 😅
i’m genuinely crying omg
Bro i just found your channel his day wtf and your channel one of the good channel here
GOOSEBUMPS WHAT THE HELL 😭
the emotional support that these video have provided me the past two and a half years has been absolutly insane thank you for being a part of my life even if you didnt even know ift you have touched my live in indescribable ways <3
It's sad to see him go but this journey we've taken with him has been great. Thank you for the laughs anthpo, congratulations on graduating, and most of all, good luck with everything to come. We love you Ant ❤️
Cant believe it’s been a month already 😢
Bro legit unlocked the graduation completed achievement
just watched your video about the yellow deli to find out your no longer uploading. wow, such bad timing on my part
I’m so late but is this it? Is it over no more videos just the memories and the past and watching old videos imagining that it’s still happening? 😢
Much depressing
Just got an anthpo video in my recommended and that kinda hurt
a month and i’m still crying
Wait, you cant go! I JUST FOUND YOU! 😂
Anthpo you probably are like literally the coolest and probably inspired me to be a nicer person in life. I wasn’t here for the start (hell I don’t think I was allowed to be on the internet at the time) but I definitely loved experiencing this journey with you. Lots of love and good luck on your next journey in life!
what now?

Is just like unus anus all over again
This feels like the end of phineas and ferb
He wasn't that funny

nothing you ever do will make me forget this man, thank you anthpo❤
So sad to watch a great man go

Just discovered the channel, thought it was not really a goodbye until i saw the other comments. Damn you will be missed. But excited for your future. Have a great life ahead:)
I’ll miss you Anthony I’ve always loved your videos back then then I just remembered this Chanel and I saw this vid thank you

I remember when harassing people with fat yoshi came out. I went to the library and printed out pictures of fat yoshi. I watched every vid since. I’ll see you Ant❤
Miss you, dude.
It feels bad to say goodbye but it feels good to know that's ok.

Goodbye bro
:(
Wait, so why is he quitting?
you were one of the best content creators on the platform. thanks for all the amazing things youve made, and for all the times youve cheered me, and thousands of others up. have a good life man. youll go far.
i will miss You😢
Why did he leave?
This channel has been such a massive source of laughter and fun for me. It made me see just how rewarding it can be to be brave and view the world with an open heart and mind, and to seek out the joy of life. You have given me hope for the future, and for a life where, despite the struggles that come along with living, someone can have friends and go on adventure and LIVE. I think that's one of the biggest things this channel showed us; The value of being alive and experiencing and enjoying the world.  To any person reading this; Go out and live, to the best extent you can. I swear to you, even just calling a friend to say hi or going on a walk around the block will be worth it. Life is made for living, and I learned that from this youtube channel where university students fill their rooms with cans of beans and participate in volleyball tournaments wearing anime jerseys. Thank you, Anthpo!!! Good luck!!!
Miss u already king 👑
DO U STILL MAKE OKPOP MUSIC??
Does this mean that you’re quitting YouTube?
Late but goodbye have a good life! You will do amazing
Nooo not yet I love your videos 😢😢
Bye lol
I miss you..
KMS 💀 wtf will we do without anthpo
Bye bye
this reminds me of unus annus
So what no more videos
Ok I’m a bi late when commenting on this but I’ll say it now. It’s been insane to to come back every month or so to see how your channel is doing. And now that it’s done…. I’m honing to be sad but it’s time to move on. Thank you for showing me that it’s ok to do whirs shit with my friends and to be a dumbass.  Thank you Anthony. You are my idol. Good luck in life.
ive dug 2 graves for us my dear.
Highs and lows  Good times and bad they all shape us into the people we are and your highs and lows made you a fine person
As someone who graduated a couple weeks ago, it’s a pain to see you leave YouTube. You brought many laughs and entertainment to the community and we will miss you! ❤
the legend quit that day.
I cant believe it’s been a month already.. we’re all going to miss him :(
I will always treasure this memories but I’m sure everyone will also. ❤
im a junior in high school and this video  this video makes me so excitingly scared for life after college my best friend kenz and i we have this plan of moving downtown where we live and into an apartment and doing online college and wed travel across America and this channel inspires me to make that a reality but also makes me completely horrified i hope i make new friends and have new experiences and go out and do stuff but its so intimidating but also i still have a year and a half to think about that kind of stuff
this man really gathered as much money as he could get so he could put himself through school and then dipped when he didn't need his viewers anymore for money. good riddance
Man congratulations. I didnt see this video till now because I've been so busy. Thank you for sharing your highlights with us. I've been here since the perry the platapus + yoshi videos so this serves as a reminder on how we're all growing up. I wish you great things on this new chapter of life! I remember you inspired me to use perry the platpus to explain the bill or rights back in middle school history class lmao. Your videos have impacted many people and I know you'll continue to do so without them. Wish you the best <3 🥳
when you found a new and interesting channel to sub and start liking it, and then later found out that the guy already quit yt months ago
Isn't this the guy who dressed up as a platypus? (Disclaimer; JOKE)
I watched you a lot for months and I loved ur channel….. Goodbye❤❤
came for beeg yoshi, stayed for the memories
wait is he going to be gone forever? i’m confused
Guy was my literal childhood
i watch this every few days and start tearing up. i've been here since the beach marathon video and i'm just so happy to have been here for it all.
its been a month. i miss you so much po.
Shinzou Sasageyo ✊
It's been a ~long way with you my friend and I will remember all about it when I see you again.🍕 🎉
RIP anthpo
I’m proud of you!
I don’t get it is he quitting?
We are all going to miss you 😭❤
We wish you a happy new journey! We thank you for everything!
Crazy how it's already been a month ;-;
We will all miss you Anthpo I’ve been watching you since your yoshi videos
Wait I don’t understand is he no longer making content  Edit as I read more replies I get why he stopped making content please do not make anymore replies as it gets kinda annoying
Bye Anthpo.
loved your videos man, have fun anthony, thank you for everything
been here since the first video, have a good life man o7
Wtf I just found this channel and his gone? Damn.  Well good luck
I’ve been watching your channel since the beginning, those were great times, i still have about a year left before I graduate high school, so college isn’t really close for me, but still is somehow, so thank you for the past 4 years, and I hope all goes well for you.
i just watched my first video on this channel and was so excited cause i loved the vibes so i went to the channel to watch the most recent (this) and find out that it’s already over?? dude 😭✋ well i’m about to go watch the rest of the videos lmao
😭😭Bro I’m not ready to say goodbye!! Thank you Anthony for everything
How did I miss this video
hi anthony, i didnt follow you and I'm not a fan but you seem like such a wonderful person from this video im so excited to watch your content
Damn, we will miss you!
Nooooooooooo😢😢
Thanks for the ride, that was great. Hope the best for you and your friends
DAMN HE WAS MY BIAS
I started and graduated in the same timeframe as Anthpo, now we’re both starting our lives…that’s crazy
no stop please i can’t take it
Anthpo must be majoring editing in college with this level of skill, goodbye anthpo!
:(
Bye
congradulations it might be sad and we will miss you but thank you for all the work you put in
Can’t believe it has been a month seems like just yesterday when i saw your cringey yoshi and Ben 10 videos. I am still consistently watching your videos. 😢
I’m so sad you are gone, I wish you the best in the future
So he’s tweeting YouTube now
so he quit?
R.I.P. Anthony. he will forever be missed 😭😭😭
The End...
Thanks now I know that I can do stupid shit in college
Wow.
Been here since the beginning, I graduated from school and entered med school. Also had my highest height and lowest lows. Through that time I enjoyed every single piece of content of yours. Thank you very much Anthony <3. bless you and good luck on your path.
😢😢😢
Man this guy really made me think of all of the great and dumb things all of my friends did and i am really sad 😢 that you had to stop this great thig but all great things come to an end.(hope you are doing well)
Coming back to prepare myselft for senior year
the cult took him guys
one month later and I can’t bring myself to watch this video again since the first time I watched it. I miss you
i really hope he gives us updates every so often on how hes doing ❤
can’t believe it’s already been a month since anthony graduated 😢, even tho I’m sad this channel ended, I’m so happy for anthony and for everything he did. Thank you Anthony for creating the best videos ever on this platform
Ur a god. Stay healthy and safe!
he did the best aot videos
I couldn't watch this video for a while. Anthony has gotten me through my high-school career. And now, when I attend my college orientation in three days and begin my next chapter, I can be a little less scared. Because I know it will be so exciting as long as I make it that way. Thank you Anthpo, enjoy your life to the fullest 🫡
can we get much higher😢
Thank you for all you have done
Thank you Anthpo
Can’t wait for the next video!
It's been a month since the legend has left us
Well we will miss you legend
O7
This video (and your entire channel for that matter) hits especially hard because of the time I have spent watching your videos, and how I am starting my first year of college this August. Thanks for helping me look forward to my next 4 years.
It has been 1 month and I'm pretty sure you won't read rhis. You changed YouTube in many ways :)
Can you make the last one season four of attack on titan pls
F**k I loved your attack on titan episode I’m so sad
GoodLuck with your life Anthpo. We will miss you . LONG LIVE THE PLATYPUS KING!
BRO I MISS YOU STILL
Good bye 👋,  have fun!!!! ❤😢
Thank you Anthony =3. We love you and wish you the best for your extremely bright future
So long partner
why does this remind me of a local tv station shutting down and before its final moments, it shows a montage of all the things its done with the community, all the laughs, all the cries, all the times it has done something good in the community. then at the last second before its shuts down, it says a heartfelt thank you to everyone. And turns to black and/or static
Are you actually leaving us..? Please don't... Please, just upload every now and then... I will miss you. I can't believe 4 years has already passed. It really makes me feel sad that you have to end all of this.
Goodbye, Anthpo 🙂
HE MADE GRADUATION! HE MADE GRADUATION! HE MADE GRADUATION! HE MADE GRADUATION!
Dam Congrats :)
It's been a year daddy 😔, i reaaly really miss you 😢.
Right when I get into your videos 💀💀💀
I discovered your channel on a whim years ago. The absolute fun you were having was so contagious. You have gone from a guy terrorizing his high school dressed as Perry the Platypus to a young man about to enter the “real world”. Just like with college or any challenge, there are amazing highs and awful lows. My prayer for you is that you keep your head high, your dreams and goals in sight and never lose focus of your true friends and family who will have your back. Whatever you choose to do in this life you will do wonderfully❤ Congratulations and good luck!!
Where is the attack on titan season 4-5 :(
i'm graduating soon, this video means a lot to me. especially the line " Thank you all so much for sitting here and being part of my story, now it's time to go live yours."
o7
We will all miss u
Anthpo, you’re one of the best YouTubers I’ve ever seen, and I’ve been on this site since 2005. Every video you made was EXACTLY my sense of humour and the sort of stuff I wanted to do with my friends. Problem was, your videos were so personally funny I got jealous for the longest time. I wish I had friends like yours who were willing to do stupid stuff. Sometimes it seems like I’m the only one who wants to go nuts, but I’m probably just lazy, I don’t know. I think it’s time I start leaving some superfluous things behind and focus on what I want my life to be.  I wish you luck wherever you go man, you’re a great person and an inspiration.
Damn, that’s it? I literally just found your channel again today lol. Good luck on your next venture man.
happy graduation dude. gonna miss watching you enjoy life. goodbye
IT HAS BEEEN A GOOD JOURNEY THANK YOU ANTHONEY!!!!
Thank you Anthony, for everything! Living life to the fullest :)
Miss you baby cakes
i normally dont make comments but i feel the need to make this comment :)  Got really emotional while watching this, i've been watching your videos with your friends for awhile now! The way you incorperated all the clips and your editing the song choice just brings all this together. I wish you an amazing future and a fun life with all of your friends. Have and amazing and bright future, full of your loved ones.   congratulations on graduating, you deserve all the success you've gotten.  have a great one! we all love you too!
Thank you for sharing your world with us these past fews, it has been so much fun watching your videos and very uplifting. I'm sure you'll go onto do awesome things, thanks for all the epic videos Antpho!
A fat Yoshi picture changed this mans life
I miss you
Fuck he's gone. what now?
i loved ur videos man im sad ur leaving but peace out
wherever you go, whatever you do, I hope you find joy and adventure and continue to grow and learn
I remember when i first watch him back in 2020 i think like pre-pandemic whenever i am sad i go to this guy's channel and made my day even better.
Why is he stopping tho?
Well I don't really know who you are but congratulations!
Not your average college student
I literally grew up with you and you were one of my role models as i grew up ,i loved your content and will appreciate you for forever.I hope you will be happy as much as you made me happy while watchin your videos.I rarely get emotional but seeing this video got me tearing up fr.I love you and i hope you live your life the fullest and in the best way possible.Farewell
Yo I’ve joined this later than late. But why do the vids need to end after graduation?
I discoverd you a few months ago anthony and you already became one of my favorite creators i'm sad to see you leave but have been watching your older videos and my favorite one by far is the cult on man i love your work and hope you make a return or just post ocaisionly
Bye😢
Damn i remember watching you a lot during the house nobody asked for, i came back and find that your leaving us already, good luck with the rest of your life bro, we’re all proud of you 🎉🎉🎉
And thank YOU for all the smiles and laughs man. Whatever you do from now on, I hope it only goes further up hill. Take care dude.
I’ll miss you
I just graduated high school today, about to go to college. This video hits harder now.
Youre gonna do amazing Anthony,all well wishes.
LOVE YOU BOY I WILL REMEMBER YOU FOREVER 😭
This channel has been amazing
Of course I find out about a really interesting YouTube channel as soon as they are quitting. Really wanted to see a lot of this guy.
Man i founded this channel 3 weeks after the ending, i feel so sad
I found your chanel when I was in 8th grade going into my first year of highschool. Your videos would always make me laugh and wish I could have the highschool friends that would feature in the videos. Now as I'm going into my senior year of highschool I've found those friends. I've learned most of these friendships might not last but to enjoy them while they're here. Thank you for everything you've created.
man
damn I just found the channel 😢
Ofc I find this channel right after it ends… Welp time to binge these-
Came back to check on your account, this broke me dude lmao
I hope he posts updates on his life
I'm on 2nd year of high school and honestly, finding your channel during quarantine was really motivating I hope you have many more adventures, and may God bless you! Cheers!!
It’s all downhill from here
You already know the 69 videos were intentional in the until graduation playlist
W anthony
BRO ITS ALMOST 1 MONTH
Fuck man... i just discovered this channel
<3
goodbye and goodluck anthpo...
your channel will remain an inspiring story for years to come. i remember watching goofy highschool Anthony running around making people laugh with funny gimmicks, i remember how seeing you grow inspired me to take action and try to live my life to the fullest while i can, i remember how i wanted to be just like you when i got older. now that i have that oppurtunity, i think i will, and that's thanks to you. have a good rest of your life and stay true <3
🖖
honestly this dude did better job at advertising rutgers then whole rutgers marketing departament
I’ve been watching these ever since I was in elementary and I just can’t make myself say goodbye
wow hes actually gone
I’m gonna miss checking up on this channel from time to time, thank ya brother you’ve helped me enjoy life a little more and I still will now that you are going wish you the best
Farewell king, college was fun
Just noticed that in "Until graduation" playlist, this video is noted as the 69th video, also we will miss you anthpo
Wait is he still making videos I’m confused
bye
Just found out about this channel, now im crying.
Does this mean OKPOP is breaking up😢😢?
ts sad that it has to end but for the past 4 years you have entertained everyone watching. From "USB mouse making my car fly" to making a kpop group you have been an amazing, funny and great entertainer. 4 years have gone by really fast and I can't belive today is today. All have the friends you have made along the way have been hilarious ( Hanbon collin and gavin are my favs) Your videos are amazing and I always rewatch them no matter how cringy or old they are.   I hope you have a great time ahead of youtube and enjoy the memories you've made over the past 4 years. 👁👄👁
Congratulations from the bottom of my heart, o7
Shit
i wish i discovered this youtube channel why earlier
Hope you'll do more i don't want to say goodbye yet
thank you for all the funnies (i might do something like your Perry the platypus vids when i get into collage but with a flamingo.)
man when you explore the channel 3 weeks after its ending
This, this just made me cry, but its that you made me smile through my tears. You made me realize how I want to live MY life, so, thank you. I will never be able to say it enough.  I wish you luck in the world, I know I don't have to wish you a bright future because you already have one. <3
I never thought one day he would graduate.thanks anth.wishes u the best
oh fuck he actually quit.
This guys is a Fuckin legend and I know for a fact that he going to have a great future and from the bottom of my heart thank you for all the laughs and just being such an amazing guy your the best and good luck with your future
coming back to this video just to say goodbye for one more time :)
I’m gonna miss you Anthony😢
I know im three weeks late, but i had only found this video until now. Its sad to see you go. your videos have never failed to make me smile. Good luck with your future endeavors. Thanks Anthony.
this is like so modern baseball haha what?
The end of an amazing chapter in life
Honestly talking I didn't even notice I'd been this long since I started following you, I started scrolling through videos and found the first video you uploaded to be the fat yoshi one. At the time I was 14 and going through a rough patch, but that video made me laugh like no other and I decided to follow you. Honestly, a lot has changed in that time and it feels insane that was 4 years ago, it feels like yesterday Overall, I just wanted to say: Thank you. Thank you for all the laughs you've given me and I'm sure thousands of others over the years. Thank you for everything
It was a long journey
when is the next upload?
Goodbye Anthony, thank you so so much for everything you've done. I hope you live your life to the fullest
NOOOOOOOOOOOOLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
so dramatic ☠️☠️ if u were ready to go leave bye
This is lime Unnes Annus created by markiplier where they created videos for a certain time then said their goodbyes man I’ll miss you Anthony you filled hours of my life with excitement
A star was born and went out with a bang his “ Debbie downer shit” hit me hard and motivate me. goodbye  You undoubtedly will be missed god speed
Thank you Anthony, you have helped me so so much in my life. I wish you the best in your life!
I haven’t watched you in forever and seeing you quit made me cry as I had so much fun watching you before and hope life is great.
coming back here after graduating high school is so surreal. i never realized this channel would emotionally prepare me for college in so many ways. been watching since my freshman year and it's made all the difference through hard times, and ESPECIALLY the pandemic. never failed to make me smile. thank you so much anthony.
bro got me crying in the club
😭😢😩
Aw man I just found this channel and now it’s all over 😭😭😭💔💔💔
Honestly wish I had lived half the amount this man has lived so far. Dk how he did it.
damn i found your account 3weeks too late
I cant believe it has been 3 weeks already since graduation and yet every day i look on here and hope there is i new vid 😢
Back in 2021 when I first transferred to a four year school, I rediscovered your channel after seeing it initially with the Yoshi, Ben 10, Perry, and pre-Covid shenanigans. I watched a few videos before I had to stop due to the overwhelming feeling of FOMO I was getting. I was alone at a new big school and living on my own for the very first time in my life. I was starting from scratch and DYING to have a friend group or even individual friends in general. Seeing you doing EXACTLY what I wanted to do made me restless and drove me to close the tab and put myself out there to make that a reality.  After seeing your goodbye video, I went back and watched ALL of your videos in order. From that, I'm realizing how much I relate to you. Being the friend that cares more about your friends than they do about you, being the friend organizing and getting everyone together, etc. Watching your conversation with your dad was oddly comforting to me. I had felt the same way you did in that video many many times, especially since I transferred to this new school.  Now, I am getting ready to graduate next semester and I'm reflecting on how much I have done with how alone I used to be. I know so many people who start where I was and never leave that place. I always wonder how I was able to make my situation better when so many others have either failed or never tried at all. What made me try in the first place? I think your videos were the catalyst. They proved to me it was possible; my ideal life was already achieved by someone and was well within my reach.  Thank you for doing that for me, Anthony, and for the hours of content that you've given the world. I hope you do something else creative and express it with the world. It would be a shame to lose such a unique, artistic voice that shines so brilliant in a sea of artificiality and mediocrity.
hey man, i'm a bit late but cya i'll miss you a whole bunch, anthpo
I also graduated this May and have been a subscriber for all my time at college, this is hitting really hard man😭 Good luck to your next phase in life!!❤
Thank you Anthony ❤ congrats 🎉🎉
aint no way parry graduated
I have been a huge fan of your channel for years, and you've been my favorite youtuber for a while. Your videos always used to cheer me up when I was down. Thank you for all the laughs and all the times you have made me smile throughout the years. This will always be my favorite channel from your dedication to make videos for us and your sense of humor. You will be missed so much. I hope you have a great life.
idk who you even are and this made me emotional
i spoiled myself and watched this ending video because i was very proud of him, i still havent watched your other uploads because of my pact to watch it all when you made this goodbye but i ruined it. i just wanna say that thank you for making my college life less shitty (im and undergrad at the moment but been watching him since the pandemic) and make me realize that college can be in a flash no matter what the situation is. thank you king, and take your time in getting that milk.
You actually helped me through a lot thank you so much
He is an icon. He is the moment.
Goodbye, you definetly will be missed. :)
i cried lowkeyy
Remember don't be sad because it's over, smile because it happened.  -Dr Sues  Thanks Anthony.
*This isn't goodbye lol I know you're coming back*
WE LOVE YOU ANTHPO!!!!!
Hi me in 2027 you graduated I hope :)..................................

I cant believe I missed the goodbye I knew I was forgetting something, I live in Australia but I hope my university years will be as fun as your college years. Thank you so much, I love this channel and I hope this comment remains here in time forever. Thanks so much, hope you love out your life to the fullest and enjoy it ❤❤❤

Naah no way, I've just discovered you by watching video about the cult, and I thought "wow this was really good i have to subscribe this guy" just to see that you're leaving :c
Wait, will he ever come back?

Absolutely Cannot believe he’s gone. This will always be my favorite channel from his dedication to his hilarious sense of humor. He ended this channel at the best time and definitely made some of my favorite videos I’ve seen. You will be missed man. I hope you have the perfect life
Noo I just discovered your channel 😭 😭 😭
only love and hugs <3
I was here
What about our SEASON 4 of Attack on Titan and the movies?! :(
I will miss you Anthpo. I hope you seek greatness in your future. Edit:I won't forget all your misadventures with your friends.Especially the time when you infiltrated in Yellow Deli with your friends,and one of your friends were brainwashed by the cult's indoctrination for a second.Ah,good times.
It feels weird seeing this being here from the start 😢 I hope the best for you anthpo for me I just finished high school so I have new things waiting for me and I feel like I may try to start something like you
i will never forget the video where you harassed people with fat yoshi
Did a lot in 4 years
thanks for everything anthony.
Thanks so much for the memories, man. I hope life treats you well—never stop with the Yoshi pictures though, that’s a meme that has to live on, YouTube or not 🤌
do you have a plan to comeback or somth TT I already miss you
damn it's already been 4 years ? 😥
Anthony, I discovered your channel on a whim years ago. The absolute fun you were having was so contagious. You have gone from a guy terrorizing his high school dressed as Perry the Platypus to a young man about to enter the “real world”. Just like with college or any challenge, there are amazing highs and awful lows. My prayer for you is that you keep your head high, your dreams and goals in sight and never lose focus of your true friends and family who will have your back. Whatever you choose to do in this life you will do wonderfully❤ Congratulations and good luck!!
Congrats, but why did you quit?
Found this channel today and already felt sad watching this goodbye video. Thanks for the laughs you've already caused. Can't wait to watch previous videos I haven't seen. Good luck on your future adventures Anthony!
O:olilli junhicih u by u  ((  yuh   U8;
God I remember the fat yoshi video and the perry the platypus one, time flies huh, I'm about to start Uni in September :^)

Your videos never failed to make me laugh. With a heavy heart, goodbye. <3
I don't even know who you are or why you popped up on my feed. I've never seen you or your videos before. But please enjoy your time off.
The end of an era... a start of a new.  Anthony's era may have ended, but our stories have yet to be told.
I literally just found about anthpo and now he’s gone :(
This video is preety well made. I haven't watched any of your videos (YT just recommended me this one).  Yet, I feel connected to your message.
Hey who knows maybe he will come back. With even more things to share, or maybe his kids will be the next thing to explore,if he’s willing to have kids
Wait! I just discovered this channel!
god fucking dammit why is it that whenever i see a good youtube channel they are no longer active /stop posting
it's been only two weeks yet it has felt like an eternity, i genuinely wish you the very best and i hope you realize how many people you have positively impacted during your time on youtube. we will never forget you.
We love you too❤
I lvoe you MAN IM GONNA CRY
Good riddance. Never forget your joke the first day Ukraine was being bombed
I just started watching him yesterday and now i see this video 😢 and it still feels bad

We say goodbye to a legend
Can someone explain? Is this channel just over now that he's graduated?

I first started watching you when you made that crab video it's been a good ride. Good job on graduating and goodbye!
I’ve been watching this dude for a pretty long time, it’s kinda sweet to see him move forward like this
i put off on watching this and i still cant process it
Goodbye Anthony. Thank you for sharing your story.
does this mean the channel is over...?
Good bye anthpo! And all of the wonderful cast and friends made along the way! I found you as a freshman as the same year/age as me and watching this was beyond bittersweet as I was able to witness your journey despite going to community college rather than university. Wherever you go will mark a beautiful future for you and your friends; thank you for letting us tag along side us for those who were not able to experience those things first hand :’)
wait your quitting youtube
Gonna miss you
Not gonna lie, I thought this was Ben of the week
Idky but I was tearing up watching this and reading the comments. You know you’ve done good when you made an impact on your viewers and the people around you. Gonna miss your videos dude.
His Bio says Graduated 😭 make me sad but it's it's been the best 2yrs watching him graduate time flies very fast
Thank you for brightening the days of millions of people all around the world. You truly are a great man.
Bye
love you man good luck and congratulations and i have enjoyed the videos you have made goodbye
what i just got here!!!
so is he actually leaving youtube or is he just graduating? because almost at 1 million subscribers is crazy
i just now saw this 2 weeks later but you made going through high school much more fun to me as you made me realize that it was easier to just not gaf abt others and just have fun
Gosh I teared up 🥲 This really just makes me wanna live my life to the fullest and enjoy it, doing stuff I like with people I like, experience more than just the confines of my own room and creat something I can fondly look back on like you right now. I truly wish you the best in life and thank you for sharing so much joy <3
We will miss you ANTHPO THE GOAT. Good luck with what you have next
I'm not going to be ok.
The fact I’m seeing this as I’m about to go into college is soo sad to me😭
God I remember when I saw that fat yoshi video for the first time and you immediately won me over. How time flies, you’ll be missed Anthpo, hope you have a great life
bye
And I found this dude now?!
I knwe it was coming all along, and yet somehow I'm still surprised and sad. It was an amazing journey following your adventures, thank you.
Bruh i just got here
Tbh I’m actually in tears this channel helped me overcome many lows in my life and presented me a new perspective of life and the way I live it. You are the best ever and I want you to know that. If you can come back please do but it’s your choice.Anthony I hope you can have a successful life and journey. Now it’s the part where we say goodbye on the behalf on all of my friends…….  GOODBYE                         -Benjamin Bui       P.S: You are my hero and idol .You taught me how to live life for the ups while the downs are something else. Just note that you inspire people like me to have more courage and bravery and like I say I kinda look up to you!Like a man once said “If you live life to the fullest, then life will pay you back” - A very wise man    Update: I’m about to go to middle school! Yippee Hooray I came back to this video so I can update people on my current life right now. I’ll keep doing this till college,just like Anthony. I hope that I can share my current life moments with this great community. So for now… Signing Off
Bruh I just Discovered your channel and it’s all over already. 🤦‍♂️
Even though he is gone i have opened his channel multiple time to see if he has posted, out of habit and then remember he is really gone. I love you guys and really appreciate you bringing me smiles the last few years
NOOO I JUSY FOUND THIS ACCOUNT
adventure time font
saw this dude sneak into a cult with his friends, went to check his channel bc the video was good, only to find that there will be no new videos, damn. AND this video hit me even though I've only seen one video, DAMN.
Come back
Wait is this actually the end? Like is he never posting again?
Ow thank you so much for your time! wish you the best!
I remember when you posted the High School graduation video and that hit me so hard. Thank you for all the laughs, have a good life. :)
Thank you Anthony, for all the laughs these past years ❤️
Goodbye Anthony and thank you <3
omg i miss them already
dont leave us PWEASEEEEEEEEEE
You have really inspired me for the past Dw years. Going into high school, I was surrounded by people who I really couldn’t be my true, goofy self around, and watching your videos gave me the courage to not hide that side, but to embrace it. I found friends that were equally, and if not, even more crazy than me and it was so comforting finally finding my people. I truly wouldn’t be the person I am today without you and I thank you for that. Have an amazing time in the real world and congrats on graduating!!!!
Oh woah, good luck bro.
I'm gonna miss his channel a lot and I hope he might come back. I know he won't but still
man name is going down history books:(
i cried watching this - it's unreal to think i don't have any videos from you left to look forward to, you were a light in my life man. I loved your channel so much, enjoy your life, i wish you the best anthpo
i love you anthpo
I'm new here and I really enjoyed your vid then I stalk you but found out you're going to leave I will watch all your videos I'll be waiting and hoping you'll comeback
I LOVE YOU ANTHPO I FUCKING LOVE YOU IM JUST SEEING THIS OPPS BUT I LOVE YOU. I will never forget the yogi video that led me to this channel
So this is it, this is the end, Goodbye y'all I hope everyone will get to their dreams and paths! Love you all!
This channel has been my favorite since I could remember Watch Anthony progress through high school and college was so amazing The fact that my favorite channel is gone is haunting but in a way represents the future I love this channel and it in part made me the person I am and got me through alot especially in his high school Era I'll always remember it and I'll miss it forever
Oh my god.
Wait so he is quitting or something I didn’t quite understand
I will miss you
I hope he come back😢😢😢😢😢
I'm tearing up lol thank you and wishing all the best dude <3
I'm not very good with words but I'd like to say this channel was one hell of a journey, thank you so much for everything, goodbyes suck, but the memories we made along the way was worth it.
When are we gonna get the harvard edition of anthpo
Byeee o/  Thanks for 4 years of good content and laughs, I don't know about anyone else but I'll still watch your old video's for two weeks at least
I love it

What 💀 I find your account for the first time and now you're leaving LFMAOOO
are you kidding me, I just found this channel
don't cry because it's over, cry because it happened
Cya
the video is pi long
I never noticed how short you were
Anthony thanks for everything and maybe i'll see you around someday
Been here since fat Yoshi and all I have to say is thank you Anthony for entertaining us these past god knows how long it's been and hope your life continues to be fantastic. Goodbye
Nice
*Wait what? I literally just discovered this channel like 5 minutes ago and I was ready to subscribe till I saw this video! Noooo I was too late😭😭*
I hope to see you again someday
Why is it so fast 😢
what a pleasure it has been to grow up the same time as you. happy graduation and good luck with everything next
Everyone says it so much, but.... The ending hurts and I made such a big and convoluted speech on the goodbye party video when I should have just said fuck it there's no point why make this shit sad when its not meant to be you might as well and go read it some of what I said I want to get out there about this guy but hey life is life and we may never find the answer but until then try youre best and do whatever the fuck you want. Go do dr3gs kids! p.s. I feel like I have to say that final sentence was a joke.
i found him today and hes already leaving. great😭
i aint gonna lie i didnt watch you that often, i just subscribed to you cuz i thought u were a cool guy with cool friends and stuff. Regardless though best of luck to you Anthony.  Also is no one gonna talk about what he said at 1:01
Is he leaving forever? If he is I don’t want him to because he was the best YouTuber I have ever watched
Ive been watching since i started high school and i just graduated too! i will miss your videos
I remeber back before i knew your channel would end when you graduate, to when i found out thinking itll be so far in the future i dont even have to worry, but here it is Best of luck anthpo :)
it's okay, i love you too. Good luck with whatever it is you're gonna do !!
Good
Thanks for your videos anthony!! I found you from 1 minute talk show back when I was a junior in high school and your content has stuck with me the past 4 years
Nice
Nah mate 1 more video eating a can of beans
who is this gay guy on my fyp
😢
WOW! I just found this channel and am so bummed to not have been apart of the journey. Guess I'll be binge watching to catch up Lol
OMG NOOO
It's a new chapter for the main character of the anthpo verse
There might just be a hole in my soul right now, we will all miss you.
this was sad to see and hear 😔
I'm so sad
This is a sad day😢
damn. what a journey. from harassing people with fat yoshi to winning a volleyball tournament in anime uniforms to having a successful kpop group... we're going to miss you, man.  now after binge watching all of his channel with teary eyes, does anyone know any channels similar to his?
PERRY
dawg i literally just discovered this channel
what is an Anthpo
I've been watching this channel for nearly 3 years, since the late high school days of fat yoshi. I feel like I've grown and changed so much since I first found this channel, I've almost grown up with it in a way. I've never been a very outgoing or adventurous person and I'm not sure if I'll ever be but this channel and these videos have brought such a comfort and inspiration to be that way. Whoever and whatever I become these videos are something I won't ever forget and I'll everything they've taught me all my life. I put off watching this and the few videos leading up to it because I knew it was coming and it's bittersweet to watch this channel go but I'm glad I finally did. It's been really hard figuring myself out and I've got a long way to go but thank you anthpo, through all the highs and lows you've made over a million people's days even just a little happier. "it's okay to not be okay."
Bruh why I love your attack on titan episodes 😭
Bye
cya
shit I just found this channel today and I've been enjoying his videos and I just stumbled upon this rn and I'm already teary eyed cuz damn it I discovered him so fucking late :( goodbye anthony<3, I just met you and I may not know much about you but I really liked your content and how fun and wholesome and menace of a person you are, I wish the best for you in the future! good luck!!!!
12 days since he’s gone yet it feels so long
I'll miss you perry the platypus guy...
im new to this channel, cann someone plz explain? is it like he created this channel for the sole purpose of documenting his high school/college years experiences, then after he graduated he would stop posting videos?
I JUST SEEN YOUR CHANNEL WHAT THE HECK IM SO SAD
NOT THE DUMBASS
this is what I get after just finding you ??????????
Damn thought it was a joke
Shur up nobody asked
The aot final is never happening
Bruh I start watching a person and he stops making YouTube videos dang
OH
Wait so u quit YouTube?
So why is he doing this?
Every video of yours always has made me laugh and smile and made my day so much better, so thank u for being the person u r, good luck with what ever u choose to do with your life, u will go far in what ever u do, thank u again for being such an amazing guy and making amazing content for the last few years, congrats on graduating and good luck
You know that one quite where it talks about how you become more like a person the more you are around them? I feel like I have gained a little bit of that from watching Anthony. I have been here for around 4 or 5 years now, and I have watched Anthony be himself that whole time. During covid I had to be part of an online class, and couldn’t go hang out with people much. When I got back to school, I was kind of a social mess, but over time I started to become better, and I think that can be credited to Anthony. His videos have made me a lot more open minded and social, and while I never could be Anthony, it feels good to try. Thank you Anthpo.
I will miss watching avatar parody
I hope the best for everywone, really , for all the internet. and i really srry; see you in a couple of years   3:12 .
This is the I miss anthpo button
I was on the verge of tears during this video. It's sad that this is the end, this channel really helped me get through some stuff. it made me laugh so hard sometimes I couldn't breathe, thank you for making these videos. remember everyone “Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.” Goodbye.
I remember finding your high school videos and always finding them making me laugh, then I remember when you started college and making videos there and I can't believe it's over already. I really never understood when people would say "where do the years go" but with this and a lot of other recent stuff, I find myself saying it. The years truly did fly, and you made it enjoyable. I hope whatever you seek in life, you do it with upmost happiness and bring as much energy into it as you have with your videos. Not seeing a new anthpo upload is gonna hurt, but the memories will make it easier. Please take care of yourself, and thank you for all the smiles and memories you made along with everyone. Thank you so much Anthony C:
I’m so heartbroken I didn’t find you until recently but it takes a strong individual to know when to walk away from something so beautiful
This feels so weird, it feels like yesterday I was watching your perry the platypus collage video when it first came out You really left a huge impact on us all dude and I thank you for that <3
This man single-handedly convinced a bunch of confused teenagers that college is really worth it, and it can be one of the best periods of your life
WAIT I JUST FOUND YOUR CHANNEL?!!??!???!!!????
sad fr
Damn😢
You’re amazing buddy, started watching your videos in grade nine and I’m graduating next year, been an honour seeing your whole journey, good luck with the big world!!
Please comeback 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Everyone’s said what I wanted to, so 1:01??? I knew there was something between them, the romantic tension was too strong. No wonder 8illy roasted Anthpo by going “Anthpo when he sees asian girls” with a drooling face.
I just subscribed! watched 4 of your scoobydoo videos and i loved it, seeing this video somehow made me sad, i wanna see more content but i also understand. even if i haven't stayed for long thank you for 4 years of making videos that people enjoyed.
goodluck man
Dude you were in my choir and you never told me you had 1 mil+ subscriber channel?
Nice
Squeezie ??
Another Anthony of Youtube flutters off to greater and more exciting things in life.
he will not make videos ANYMORE ?
day 11 of crying over a dude i know off youtube
Bros definitely gonna be back he aint gonna find any better opportunities than this
Nice
Congrats and good luck Anthony. I grew up and graduated alongside you so this is an ending for me as well.   All the best to you in your future endeavors!
Sobbing. Cant believe it’s over. So proud of you, thanks for being the best part of the internet
damn, didnt think it would come so fast. weird how life can be.
Noooo :(

Good bye 😢
Wait I don't get it why is he leaving...? I had so much fun watching his vids please anyone tell me why he is leaving
💕💕
Bro i been subbed for this guy for so long. Crazy to see him grow
Cya dude
❤️
Who knew the fat yoshi perry the platupus guy would one day have this much of an impact on so many people. I'm glad to say I've been here since the high school days and while I may not have stuck around as much as others (at least I've still got videos to watch even tho you're gone), I'm glad you're doing what makes you happy.
Good video
bro you have made me so so happy and watching this, i actually teared up. I love the content you have made these past 2 years and thank you so much. You gave me so much confidence <3
I just found this channel,  through this video, and his voice is so genuine that I'm sad too, and I don't even know his name
I missed him already
I fucking love you Anthony po
Damn I hope you’re doing well bro
Thank you anthony, you gave me and my friends and family millions of unforgettable laughs and inside jokes. Thank you, and i wish you the best in life ❤
F a t  Y o s h i
holy shit this means we’ll never get aot season 4 😭😭
Damn I just got here 😮‍💨😔
this feels so bittersweet.
I just subscribed
i just found ur channel and this the first thing I see as soon as I clicked on ur channel.. you have great videos man, we wish you luck and much happiness.
I'm super sad because I've watched this man's college path while I was having my highschool one. I'm graduating next year and not ready at all.
I know some people have said this already but I also procrastinated watching this video because I didn't think it would all be over so fast... This is the end of my Junior year of high school and I've always been really scared for my future but this has definitely given me some hope that maybe it won't be as terrible and lonely as I think it will be. Have fun with life, bro.
dont even know this dude but congrats
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Thank you so much for the amazing content over these past 4 years. Since high school I've been inspired by your videos, I can't express how much of an impact they had on me. I earnestly wish you well on your next journey in life, thank you.
You know part of me never wanted this day to come. But then again I’m glad it did. Some good things must come to an end and I’m glad you shared some of your life with us. Congrats on graduating college. And goodbye.
I've been watching since we were both in high school. I'm still finishing college and unfortunately I havent been able to have this same exciting college experience as you, but honestly I've loved watching. It keeps me outgoing and optimistic. Congrats!! and good luck :)
i'm sobbing
NO GO BACK FOR ANOTHER DEGREE YOU ARE TOO FUNNY
Ok
sobbing
It sucks that I just found this channel but have seemed to be closing
Take it easy! Enjoy life!
scrolling through the comments and seeing everybody have the same thoughts and experiances is just wild. Thank you so much anthpo for idk existing lol, wish the best for u and ur friends. good job man
I have been a subscriber to your channel since the Fat Yoshi video- one of your first viral YouTube moments. For me, it was a joy to have followed this part of your life. Anthpo, thank you for the smiles and laughs. You made content that represents what is quintessentially YouTube- just sharing videos of happy and silly moments for the sake of sharing your experiences with others. I wish you goodbye and good luck for the future, Anthony! 👋
Goodbye
Showed up from fat Yoshi era, started college with him and left here with my own degree. Crazy how fast time flies.
Honestly I feel like you were the equivalent of having fun and enjoying life and I liked that, I'll miss you but life goes on
Ive never seen or heard of this guy or his channel but thia goodbye hurts for aomw reason. Its like the end of a series and its never going to return even if he is still alive and existing. Cya mate.
Well, that sucks. I only just found you today.
I can't believe I just found your channel today!! I am gonna binge watch all your videos, you seem very fun. Wish the best with your life bro!
I BEEN HERE SINCE DAY 1!!!!!!!!
WHAT
anthony, will you keep guest appearing on other people's videos(like alpharad)?
God it’s sad that it’s ending but idk
Goodbye Anthpo, thank you for helping me and so many others get through tough times
it was fun while it lasted :)
goodbye forever?
wait has it been 4 years??  mom where's the go back button  *MOM WHERE'S THE GO BACK BUTTON*
farewell mr po
I discovered this channel in 2021, and haven't been around as long as the others but the impact this channel has had on me is massive. I have always been socially awkward and shy, and seeing you do the goofy shenanigans you are known for helped me break out of my shell. I have become more extroverted, had fun in my life that I wouldn't have if I was still my old self. I also asked out a girl for the first time (I'm still in high school) and although I got friendzoned, I still feel proud because I had the courage. It is still hard for me to accept that you are leaving YouTube, but I'm sure you will enjoy your life to the fullest and do great things. Thank you Anthony, for carrying me through lockdown and improving my life.
4 years ain't enough dude - aim for a PhD to give many more years of content.
Nooo :(
o7
Just found your channel!
This is so bittersweet. Thanks for all the effort you’ve put into sharing some of your interesting experiences with us. All the best with whatever you’re going to do next!
i miss him already
I'm join this channel for a very long time, but I didn't want to see the new videos, because the pressure and the heartbreak I'll feel in this video is too much. Thank you Anthony, I wish you all the best ❤
I remeber watching the perry video on a whim some years back and thought it was a lot of fun watching it. Didn't notice how long ago that video was made. Just to click on the channel today and find out that your graduating college the same year I graduate highschool.  Still lost on my path, still confused and don't know what I want to do in life but what you said kinda helped in a sense. Thank you
You will be missed so much, and THANK YOU for the best four years of watching a content creator. Life after college is hard
I just graduated yesterday
I dont know who you are but uh good luck and uh have a safe one too
i first saw the fat yoshi video, then youtube recommended me another video and i thought it was kinda entertaining and well made. i kept watching more and when i did, first i laughed because the humor in those videos were great, then i had a phase were i wished that i had a friendgroup like that, i was also depressed at that time as well and those videos helped me to forget about the depression even if it was just for a while. then i kinda continued watching  just because it was a new anthpo video and i had good associations with the videos before. it just became a thing to watch them, but it was a good thing. sometimes i had laughs, sometimes i dreamed of friendship, sometimes... well sometimes i didnt enjoy some, but then i came later back to watch them again and they felt ok xD. But now its over and it feels like something is missing. although im sure to forget about the missing feeling in the long term, i can see myself in the distant future where i stumble over a anthpo video and think, man those were great times seeing a new anthpo video and being exited about them, and then i will be sad that those times are over. Anyway,  i honestly think you are a great person ( from what ive seen),  and some of your videos will stay forever in my memories as videos i enjoyed and had a great time watching like the kissable studends associations video or the haikyuu video. it also made me happy to see you liking haikyuu as much as i did when i just recently watched it and finished it in one go. Thank you for making all of these videos and sharing them with us. I hope you find what you are looking for in the future and i wish for you to be well.   Good bye :)
good bye for now
haha okay anthony its not funny anymore, you can come back now
If you ever return, even if it's just for 1 more video in 15 years, we will be here to watch it
I have been watching anthpo for over 4 years now and watching Anthony grow from messing around with Kieran at his highschool to forming a literal KPOP group which is awesome considering I use to think him slapping lobster out of peoples hands while wearing a lobster onesie was his best video. You have grown so much and you better make more music for OKPOP.
This was definitely the best quitting video I’ve ever seen
Farewell Anthpo
Imagine he makes a comeback in like 5 years
“Don’t be sad that it’s over, be happy that it happened!” -someone probably
;(
Im starting college in August, i hope I manage to make friends like you
i don’t understand he is quitting youtube? 😭😭 he can’t be that serious he really made my days ❤
We love you
I only just found this channel 3 days ago and now I'm sad
Great success, you did amazing and unique videos rhat have an enourmous value to everyone on the internet, we felt like we were a part of your (weird) college experience! Keep on creating!
are you taking perry with you too?
I keep coming back hoping I'll wake up and this is just a dream, a dream that this ended but I always get pulled back into reality, and as sad as it is I'm genuinely happy for everyone who has been a part of Anthpo’s videos and I'm glad they get to close this chapter of their life with a happy ending.. I'm sure he’s out there starting a new adventure on his own without us watching. I wish Anthony and everyone else the best of luck for the future!!!
ANTHONY THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE FOR US AND MAKING US SMILE KEEP SHINING BRIGHT AND MOVE FORWARD TO YOUR DREAMS ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
i hate it when things end why does it have to end u dont have to quit youtube but it seems like hes wants to which does not make any sense to me at all i just dont get it i dont think i ever will my brain thinks he does not have to quit he just should do it as a hobby not a job because fun but if he does not like it then well...... i just want to know if he is happy with this because i would and could never be quitting while ur a head makes sense but why not got out with something i dont  even know what i want and why i even care i started watch this after he quit like i did wtch 1 of his videos from like 2 years ago but then never after that i  more think that he could do so much more and go so much high then where hes at now 2m 5m 10m 100m subscribers i think he could be amazing  with the little i have seen of him but i guess thats just it.
Oh god it’s a video about college memories. Anyone else go through a whole year without making any friends or doing anything?
Your content and many others is the content i enjoy, random people on the internet doing goofy shit with friends. I thrive for this content and you have really made a mark. Thank you.
This is unfair, I just started watching your content..
See ya later, Perry the Platypus. You are the definition of bros before hoes.
im not ready to say bye 😔
o7
I can’t believe Anthpo died
Wow... the music really made me feel this. Good luck with your life Anthony, i'll certainly miss your new uploads, dearly, but the ones you've done, they're still here for us.
bro, its not real dawg i been watching u for like 3 years and this shit is so weird seeing you fucking graduate wth
🖖
Brooooo I found you today 😔
End of an era
I cant believe an Anthpo video would make me cry. Thank you for everything Anthpo. 🥲
Goodbye Anthpo 😔🤙 We will never have Every episode of attack on titan season 4
Thank you for all the great moments and the laughs. It was worth the time it took to watch all the videos because each one made my day. Thank you for everything and hope you have a good future.
u really just watched a fraction of this mans life in 3 minutes. god damn
bro it was a good ride and a good end
It's weird I have only watched the perry video of anthpo yet I feel so emotional watching this probably because of seeing how much uou enjoyed your life and so many of your experiences  Best of luck for your life Anthony ❤ I hope I could life a life filled with experiences like you Goodbye
love you anthony wish you the best of luck in your future <3
What are the odds I just discovered this guy's channel a week after he quits youtube lmao
Legend.
goodbye anthpo you were a pretty funny guy
Bye
Wait, I just discovered this channel few days agoooooo. 😢  Congratulations on graduating! I just finished watching the volleyball one. That was really inspiring. Thank you and goodluck to your future endeavors
Please leave my head why do you have to be so great of a person. Why couldn’t you just peak at high school with the yoshi and perry thing and not go on to become my favourite person ever just to leave
ok bye
Thank you for great vids and gonna miss you ❤
dAMN
Thank you. Goodbye Anthony.
Thank you for everything Anthony. We all wish you well, and we know that you will do great things in life. Goodbye, go have fun and live your life. 💙
Gg
for once im glad the youtube algorithm didnt send this to me a year too late. im 8 days late but fr, if it wasnt for this recommendation, id usually check that other video with the countdown every now and then. Best of luck in your future- I remember watching your airbender stuff from back in the day as well as the ben ten arc. didnt really keep up with the college content but once i saw the countdown I decided to see how it'd end. It was pleasant
I don’t think anyone was ready for this. At least I wasn’t. My heart drops whenever I see it. If you come back, or make another channel, do share it with us! (Please we will miss you horribly. Only if you decide!!)
very bittersweet, thank you for these four years
It is kinda sad to say goodbye. I've been following Antpho since his earliest high school videos. All I just want to say is thank you for being an inspiration to enjoy life more, goodbye Anthony you have a bright future ahead
I can't believe it has already been four years and I also graduated not from college but no matter where you go we will support you even if we don't know where you are
Graduated recently myself, and almost immediately had a mental breakdown the following Monday, but I digress. I wish you the best of luck moving forward, and hope that in your low points, you'll remember that things will always get better. Thank you for the laughs.
This was such a wonderful experience, I've never seen a YouTuber do what you did Anthpo. We love you and we hope whatever you do in the future is prosperous and brings you joy❤️❤️❤️
Wish you nothing but the best in life thank you for everything 💯
im confused your channel was only for the 4 years you were at college? i used to watch you all the time since then ive watched off and on so if you are just done thats pretty crazy
Loved your channel since middle school, your videos have never failed to make me and my friends laugh. Congrats from all of us. W e all love you and thank you for these years of funny and amazing vids
ooh good job on graduation.  one day maybe we'll see you again
Somehow I click on this, my sons goes to collage this year, Good luck young man 👽👍🏻
Goodbye, thanks for the laughs and I hope you and your friends have a good life.
Oh no! We'll have to find some other spoiled pretentious rich kid to oggle over now. Fuck!
whats going to hapen to okpop :(
We love you Anthony
God ybye
Congratulations Anthony, all of your fanbase is wishing you well and we’re all happy for you. This channel will also teach people of past and future generations that nothing good lasts forever which is why we should make the best out of it with the current time that we have. Hope you have a good life and cheers to whatever the future holds🥂
🤝
Feels like when Samurai Champloo ended. Thanks for the videos.
dude, you really helped me to keep my mind during pandemic and inspired me after. thanks for everything!
i cant believe its over. Congrats on graduating mann,  Ive loved watching your stuff these last 4 years. I hope for the best for you man
I've appreciated your channel ever since I found it. Your videos have always been fun mood boosts no matter the day. Heading into my senior year of uni this fall, I'm headed towards the end of this chapter in my life and your videos have been inspiration and a reminder through university that I don't need to go big to make memories and enjoy life to its fullest. Take care and thanks for sharing this time with us.
Thank you for this
bro looks like ted bundy
To think it all started with a goddamn dinosaur
Does anybody remember what he majored in?
This feels like Unus Annus all over again. Atleast we can come back and reminisce
Thank YOU Anthony wish you the best of the best
im proud of you and happy to be part of this community , thank you for make me smile and laugh goodluck for you and everyone
Time to delete YouTube
Goodbye Anthpo you will be missed
anthpo Im going to miss your videos, sometimes I take breaks from them but I always end up seeing them again. I remember the first video I saw was the fat yoshi one with my friends. I havent seen all of your videos but now I want to watch all of the ones I missed because now your not making anymore. Anyways goodluck and continue to have a great time!
thank you for everything 🥺
this man will always go down as a youtube legend.
First off; Who the fuck are you?? Second; im gonna miss you.
The people who disliked this video were blinded by the tears in their eyes. Goodbye Anthony, we will miss you.
Great video rip Perry
I have 0 idea who this is and why its in my recommendations XD
this king is part of internet history
so like...i just got here today bc of a recommendation video of OKPOP then i came here to watch some videos and I'm amazed at how beautiful they are...it shows so many funny, emotional, kinda crazy videos and i just feel sad by the end of this channel :( can somebody tell me why is ending?  but regardless, thanks for letting us watch these amazing and incredible moments w your friends! they really taught me how life can be so so amazing sometimes!!!
thank you anthony for being you and making us laugh. goodluck in the future!
I found you last month and now your done with the whole youtube thing. Well understood.
thank you for the best 2 years like ever anthony 💗🙏
The journey was awesome man, I'm so glad I got to be apart of it,  Goodbye :)
does this mean youre quitting youtube now?
<3
im gonna miss you and your friends, and getting excited to watch a new video of you guys. i wish you the best, thanks for everything
Nice
Ok
Thank you Anthony, we’ll miss you :)
I’ve been holding off on watching this video
Goodbye
I think when he realizes how hard it is to get a job with good sustainable pay in this day and age, no doubt he’ll be back in less than a year. But good luck
Man…it’s been real ant keep it real big dawg peace ✌️🫶🏿🤘🏿
Goodbye lad.
Well looks like this is the end of the story of a legend and time to start ours, thankyou for showing us stories for four years
ANTHPO PLEASE DONY GO NOO PLEASE WE DIDNT EVEN GET ATTACK ON TITAN 4 PARODY NOOOOOOOO
crying rn
All the best man. You're a good egg.
you calculated it to be exactly 69 college videos before you graduated didnt you
man wtf i just found your channel
I didn't think it would be this hard to say goodbye but it is.  Goodbye, Anthony, it was fun!
This video is probably going to mentally prepare me for a leaving school for the last time, I'm still young so its far away but this is gonna be a reminder for me that some day it's going to end.
Jesus, Chunky Yoshi was 4 years ago?!!
Will you come back when you hit 2,00mil
it’s been a week. missing you all.
I watched you for the first time in 2019, thanks for the laughs and I wish you the best
i remember watching your high school videos. wow. it's been so long. i can't believe it's over. it's been nice. ♡ thank you
Give him a year or two...
I think it’s safe to say that I grew up with your videos. From the first video you ever posted, until your college career, until you started counting down the days you had left on this platform, I was impacted strongly by you. Now that it’s all done, I believe it’s just the beginning. As I’m just about to start my first year in college, I am beyond thrilled to begin this journey and i hope to create a journey that is just as beautiful as yours. You are and will forever be my favourite YouTuber. Thank you Anthony.
Been watching since the yoshi video also my comfort channel through out pandemic😭😭😭
thank you for the memories, godspeed
I truly lost my passsion for youtube after covid, but you and your friends have brought such joy to me nad my friends. We love you man, you and your friends are so brilliant.
Goodbye, you will be missed
Hey Google play 'Missing You' by BTOB💔

“Ah, jolly good show.”  - Pops
one week without anthpo sadge
I was dreading for this day and I am going to miss Anthony and all of his content that he produces. Good look Anthony we will miss you!
<3 been a week already, definitely missing your crazy new ideas, but the videos you've made are more than enough. hope you're doing well Anthony!
Thank you, it's all thanks to you if I came twice dressed up as Perry The Platypus at school lol 🙏❤
Damn I watched u back when i was in middle school and now I’m going into my senior year
You graduated this year and i am about tk go college this year. This was a beautifully made journey. Good luck on your next one.
Crying because it’s scaring me how fast time is flying
Oh there you are Perry
It’s been a wonderful time these fast few years I’m sad to see you go but happy knowing that you’re going to do great in the future thank you so so much for everything
what
didnt even know u existed until now but i loved your goodbye video and hope the best for you <3
i've loved your videos since you were in high school and all those shenanigans you've done. ever since then, I haven't kept up with your videos much since i also started my high school year and now that you're leaving i'm graduating senior high school and moving on to college. thank you for these videos that you created that have made everyone happy, I'll definitely watch all the things and videos i missed out on when i have time, in the meantime, good luck to you!
I may be late but I'll miss this mf. Watched him for a long time and made me laugh goodbye ant👋
After watching your vids i can proudly say im quite excited for my future college life!
fuck you, dont stop this, youre so great
Damn, only been a week and still missing him so much
Im currently a rising junior in college, and watching your videos made me excited for what was to come. Congrats, and thankyou for taking us along for these years!
I've never seen this guy before why have I been recommended this.
Bro left to OKPOP
Well done bro been watching you for so long
Your graduating college right as im getting ready to enter. Your videos have been such an inspiration to me and have encouraged me to live my life to its fullest potential as well. Thank you for sharing your story with us, with me. I wish you the best of luck with all of your future endeavors.
good luck old friend, we will see you in another time and another life
Goodbye
I'd cry if he ever deleted this channel
You graduated when I graduated. Two diff chapters but it was still a vibe to go thru highschool watching your channel. Will miss u
There it goes… Time to start a new adventure.
Bye I wish you luck in your life thanks for always having your channel here to make me laugh good luck with life and congrats on graduating!
finally
im so glad we could share this part of your life with you.
Bye mullet child
This Was Such A Good Experience
End of an Era. You will be missed Mr.Anthpo
I remember fat yoshi as yesterday, GG
getting unus annus flashbacks for some reason
<3
Thank you Anthony, I've been watching ever since your high school days and enjoyed every minute of your shenanigans. We all wish you well in whatever you do next, and just wanna say thank you for sharing your good times with us and making us smile. I'm not really ready to say goodbye but all good things have to come to an end so I just wanna say, Goodbye and Thank you.
Good luck with everything you do
No video anymore?
Wasn't this video originally like twenty minutes long?
So is the channel done?
This kinda hits hard. My brother just graduated high school and is moving on to college and leaving me behind, but it just hasn't hit yet, but watching this is actually making it hit. Thanks for all the laughs and giggles you've given everyone, especially those that are in a dark place. They needed it. Thank you.
Y'all think this guy is really gonna quit? Don't be so naive, dude has almost 1,7 million subs. You don't just throw that away. Probably gonna go on a hiatus for a bit, then do a big comeback.
Saw one of your video once about Ben 10 and that’s pretty cool, Goodluck out there
If I’m being honest here I did not watch many of your videos but just by watching a few I could tell your an amazing funny guy and it sucks to say goodbye because your an amazing content creator and I hope you the best of luck in life.
As an incoming college freshman, this feels kinda trippy. Like, I've looked up to you since Middle School, and I've also had dreams of doing the things that you do, but I've always been told that it was inpossible and wouldn't matter anyways. I want to enjoy life outside of my house, and seeing you be able to do that makes me have hope that I can do it too. The thought of hanging out with people and participating in my community sounds exciting. Thank you Anthony for making Anthpo and these videos!
I still can't belive he is gone
congrats on graduating!!! your videos were so wonderful and I wish you the best of luck with your future :)
I cant say i kept up with the channel but as someone graduating hs and moving onto college, this kinda hit hard for some reason
wiw
This is the first time I cane around to your channel and it was through a video called "Every episode of breaking bad". I wanted to see your lastest videos because I expected to see the same style of comedy and this is what I run into. So typical.  I hope you have a good life, found a wife, get a god job and have time with your friends and loved ones. I hope you make great memories in hour life and we can't expect you to be some kind of robot that just shoots videos like it has no other purpose and if Im 100% honest, people who get so emotional or freak out over someone quiting the entertainment business, I feel like they didn't see that person as a human. Maybe the saw him as he is a flesh and blood but they had these expectations that this person's only purpose is to entertain me.  I see that I missed on a lot and people usually don't appreciate things well enough till they don't have them anymore and that's how most of your fans feel like. I'll still be watching your videos, Im sure there is some great stuff over there and even thou this is the second video I see from you and its in kind of a sad tone, everybody atleast left with a good taste in their mouths. Age well my brother 🧑‍🎓
He’s like the Tarantino of YouTube. Only made a certain amount of videos and knew when he was gonna quit from the beginning. This channel will always be special.
Bro didn’t even finish AOT series
<3
i’ve never been a “huge fan”, but nice to watch this man right here at times, but seeing him graduate and finish this channel, congratulations on graduating! ❤🎉🎉
Never actually expected to see the day where it hit's zero. Always felt so far away
Honestly this feels like a vtuber graduating tbh. You've been watching their videos and suddenly... Times up. It's finally time to let go and live our life.. even if ive only known Anthony's channel for 5 months I've already grown attached to this guy as if he was my friend... Stay safe my friend and congratulations.
NOO
Literally the first video of yours I’ve ever watched Edit: nevermind I saw the Yoshi TikToks
i can’t stop crying wth thank you for sharing part of your story with us, wishing you the bestest for the rest. i will miss you <3
Goodbye
I am so sad but happy for you guys at the same time ! Congratulations on your graduation and I hope the future holds its best for you !
Im sad
I never knew you existed until this video lol
crazy to think I started watching you when I was a freshman and now I’m a senior
I’m not ready to say goodbye yet…
wait he's not ginna post anymore? :(((((((
commenting to help this video get seen by more people
Well, it’s been a journey, and I don’t know if it was on purpose or not, but the playlist “until graduation” with 69 videos, made me laugh in this goodbye moment… have the best life out there Anthony ❤
These 4 years have been awesome, thank you and wish you the best of luck in your future!
:(
It’s been wonderful to watch you these past few years. It’s over, but the memories are all still here! Thank you ❤
Tysm for the 2 years goodbye
NOOOOO WHY DO YOU HAVE TO QUIT !!!!!’n
I actually start university this year, so I hope I can have great times like you did!
Im not ready to say goodbye so I'll say thank you, thank you for the joy that you brought into my life and for the joy you brought into the world  Edit: 3 weeks after this video, Im ready to say goodbye. I hope you do well in your life, I hope you follow your dreams and your passions and most of all... I hope you dont stop being so goddamn amazing. Goodbye anthpo, Im glad to see you go off into your life

Goodbye Anthony. Thank you for the memories, the laughter, and the moments that will forever remain in our hearts. Farewell, and may your new journey be filled with endless happiness.
I, gotta say “Thank you”, anthpo. You’ve been one of my ideal ways to live. Unfortunately, nobody knows about you here, Japan. But keep making me smile forever!!
I was here for beeg yoshi, but stayed for the antics. Thanks Antman
Nooo i just got heree
Been subbed to you since your highschool vids!! Loved them!! Sad to see you go but Good Luck for your future!! ❤️
early to witness his goodbye, late to see his beginnings. :((
I have to say for a while now I wans't keeping up with your channel as I used to, but I can't help but thank you for all the moments of laughter and comfort you brought. At my lowest your videos used to britghen my face even if for a short while. It was a surprise to me seeing that you have graduated, but I hope everything goes well. Thank you for everything Anthony, you'll always be in our hearts!!
NO

Loved growing up and graduating with you
Im ready to say goodbye but Thank you for the past 2 years of memories
I love how he uses somebody to love by queen:((( WE LOVE YOU ANTHPO!!
Thank you for everything. I loved every day and watching everything unfold, you've helped me so much, truly it's been an amazing experience and experiment. Best wishes, Godspeed.
My final school exams are in 2 weeks, then I go to college. I remember all those years ago seeing your videos and thinking how cool this kind of life would be, now it's my turn. Goodbye!

Bro no why does it feel like all the ogs are retiring 😢the new yt like Kai speed not so new just yk but pls don’t leave
Thank you for making great content.
I’m so glad I watched the whole journey of this channel. I discovered anthpo when he was at just 20k subs. I practically watched him grow up with this channel, and saw him live his life to the fullest.
Man imma gonna miss you
Not gonna lie this hit me hard. I'm legit crying right now. To see you go from a humble lil fat yoshi to a college grad. How time flies. May success come to ya bruh.
We’ll meet again, don’t know where, don’t know when. But I know we’ll meet again some sunny day
It's been an honor watching these videos, and watching you grow-up from such a long way.  Thank you for all the fun you've brought us, I hope to see you again someday...
God bless.
I remember when he first announced he was gonna stop posting when he graduated, and I was really hoping that he wouldn't be telling the truth. But he is stopping, and idk what to say. Anthony, you've brought me so many laughs and I can't thank you enough. Enjoy your life!
I graduate tomorrow, I feel like that final message hits pretty hard. Thank you for all of the laughs, man. I've really enjoyed watching you go through life just being you (and causing meme worthy chaos). Here's to new beginnings, I guess
Bye
Thank you for everything. This channel made me realize how much I should value time with friends and to try to make the most of life. I wish you nothing but the best for the rest of your life and hope you can look back on this chapter in the future and use it as a form of “Time Travel” machine to see all the people that care about you and all the adventures you have gone with your friends. Take care Anthpo❤
And to all a good night
Good luck in your bright future ahead of you, im gonna miss you alot man, thank you for every video you've made, really did impact me alot. we're all gonna miss you, but good luck and goodbye. <3
I don’t even know who you are, but bye I guess.
<:)
who is bro
Fricking legend!
I’m a new viewer, and I didn’t even know this video existed. Now that I do, it just makes me sad. As short as my time has been with your channel, I still want to thank you for making my bad days better.  Edit: Holy freaking crap
His channel still exists  Is this really goodbye?!?!
Thank you. I hope you know how much your content has positively influenced people, myself included. I'm starting college this fall, and I didn't think I would make it this far, and content like yours allowed me to hope that one day, I may have something similar to what you do. Thank you again, it hurts to see you go, but I know you'll go on to do amazing things.
bye
Never seen a video of yours, but I can feel how hearfelt of a goodbye this was. From the montage in the video I can tell this channel was a trip to go through, almost like a time capsule, and although I never got to see it for myself, I'm glad it's all here so even if I missed it, I can still see it all. o7 Anthpo, I might not know you as well as the other people here but I hope everything goes as well as this channel has
I can't even believe it. This flew by. Thank you for bringing joy to all of us. I hope we can be apart of your next chapter in some way because you are hella talented and hilarious. Thank you. 🫂
Thanks
Adios mate it was nice knowing you and I hope you live life to the fullest. 🎉🎉😢
Zamn
no way i’ve been here since the beginning
Im crying right now bro, ill fucking miss ya man! Love you❤
I don't even know who you are, but you already saying goodbye smh
Just wanna say that I've been watching your content since 2020 and I gotta say that as a now freshman going through high-school, this video has taught me to appreciate and cherish the memories I will experience throughout these 3 years I have left,  and for the 4 more after when I go to college.  Enjoy the much needed break, as you can finally rest now for how many years, or decades you want, or just straight up retire. But for now, if you're reading this, goodbye!
Tony P solos
The first video I see from this person and its titled goodbye. I love life.
as your leaving college I'm entering it. I can only hope to have as great a time as you. thank you Ant, enjoy your life.
This made me teary eyed. i will genunely miss Anthony and the content he puts out, but nothing lasts forever. Good luck to Anthony and the rest of the ACU!
Toodles !
goodbye anthpo we will miss you dearly.
The anthpo cinematic universe has reached its conclusion. I'm gonna miss you Anthony🥺
howd he get away using queen without a strike
This has probably been one of my favourite channels ever. Watching this brings me back to 2020 when I watched your high school campus videos about how you disturbed students as perry the platypus. Or 2021 when I watched your squid games video. This channel amazing, and I really get brought back to those times when I watch this. Thank you for this channel, I hope you succeed in life, whatever you do next.
W
Goodbye what a great story :)
Later sk8ter
that haikyuu shit was awesome
I’ve been watching this man since I was 15 years old. What a ride it’s been😂
BYE
I can’t believe that it’s over. I’ve been watching your videos for years now and they’ve always put a smile on my face. But unfortunately I lost my old account two years ago. Now I found it again and find out this legend is leaving. Man. It went from a guy harassing people in hallways with pictures and etc. To this man being a legend. Cheers anthpo. Wish you the best for your future.
finally
What the. I literally came across this channel today from the yoshi video
Just another person to unsubscribe from
Goodby Anthony good job
:)
Congrats Anthony!! Thank you so much for bringing us these videos for the past 2 years
I know im late but we'll miss you man
godspeed anthony, godspeed
idk who you are xx
3:14 the legend is over
Dont know who you are, but best wishes with your future endeavors,🫡
HAS ALL THIS TIME PASSED???? I am not a super fan of the channel, but I kept up for like, 3 years and half, I REMEMBER THE YOSHI JUST APPEARING IN MY SCREEN FOR THE FIRST TIME
bye!! 🤣
I’m sad we couldn’t see S4 of Every Episode Of AOT
Thank you Anthony, you've been an inspiration to me throughout my college life, I really loved being a part of your journey as you were a part of mine. I wish you the best in your forthcoming journeys!! Au Revior, Anthony!
congratulations. we love you and will miss you dearly.
Congrats on the graduation Anthony, gonna miss you
anthony man, im just a guy who lives far away from y'all but i gotta say something. whatever you do man just be the man who is always fun and positive, dont be a boring grown up or some shit that whos always serious and mad at people. stay young bro. take care and goodluck w ur life💫
I've seen you pop up in my feed many times in these years, but guess what? i'll only start watching you now that you left yt. hope you had fun and made some good content cause i'm about to watch it all. good luck with everything anth <3
Cya
thnks fr th lghs nthp
damn.
damn.. ill miss seeing his fine ass..
amogus
we wish you the best anthpo. it has been a magical few years.
never seen this channel in my life and yet i found that emotional anyway :')
It has been a pleasure man, I wish you the best, thanks for all the laughs you gave me throughout these 4 years ❤❤❤
the the best bro ❤
This is just so crazy. I can’t say I kept up recently, but I’ve been here and subbed I before he went off to college. Started off with the Perry video I believe. It’s insane to see you’ve made it this far from harassing people with Yoshi. Best of luck to you man
Wait so there won't be any other videos in the future? :(
good luck with life my dude. thank you for sharing your joys and sadness as well showing a fun and silly young adult life. you are going to do something amazing for yourself later in your years.
happy ending
Ive been watching since day one you will be missed so much
Thank you for everything. Seriously.
I've been watching since your high school Perry the platypus video and its been great. Every video I've watched since has always put a smile on my face. I've loved every second of it and its crazy how fast time flew. Being a fan of you since you were in high school to you graduating college. I'm glad I discovered you and took this journey with you as a fan. I can truthfully say everyone will miss you and we all wish you the best on whatever path you take next :)
Thanks for everything, man!! We'll miss you but never forget about you and the impact you left on all of us!! <33
Ill be honest, ive seen a total of at most 2 videos from you, but i have to say that those 2 videos were peak youtube.
Cya 👋
An absolute legend, we will miss you so much ♡♡♡  Thank you for making me smile and laugh in my lowest of days
who tf are you ?
Crazy that you’re not making another channel or anything. You made some insane connections and have grown a substantial fan base that you could shift to another channel and grow a new type of channel.
See you Space Cowboy...
...I love you man... Thanks for being here for us.
Even though I was never an insane hardcore fan who watched every single video, you've had so much impact on my life and this video means so much to me man, have a good life dude :-)
i was here since you where give people the big yoshi paper 🙏
Thank you for making amazing videos and making so many people's days better. Your content has brought so much joy to so many :) We love you Anthony, best of luck to you and your friends!
this is sad and the sad thing is when you are a youtuber you have to make a commintment
I just started watching this guy And now it's already goodbye that was fast. Is he gonna post more videos?
Holy shit I can’t believe that its already over.  Thank you so much anthpo for the amazing content you’ve put out. We all wish you the very best in your future and wherever it maybe
Whew. Coo-ee! Don't think i've ever heard about you before, but it sure does feel like you brought good days to a lot of people. You deserve to be proud of getting this far, it definitely is one heck of a accomplishment. Cheers from Brazil!
Hmm can someone please tell me what his channel was about, and why does this video mean bye? Did he quit YT?
GOODBYE ANTHPO
Then end of an anthrogalion
Hard to not shred a tears after this video. Your channel have been part of my life for the last 4 years and it's always hard to say goodbye. Farewell, I hope you'll do amazing in life, thanks for all those moments share with all of us and for the laugh you gave us at the right moment in our life. See you on the other side <3.
Who is this guy and why is YouTube recommended this to me😅
Wait where are you gonna go
Goodbye bro
WAIT I JUST REALIZE YOUR THE GUY WHO HARASSED PEOPLE WITH FAT YOSHI
What no DONT LEAVE ):
Done for ever?!?!?!?!? 😢😢😢😢😢
this channel gives me tv show vibes, like every video is a episode of anthpo's life with setbacks on the way and this is like the final episode which looks back on the whole series it kinda makes me wanna cry lol
this is like the ending of a really good slice-of-life show
Anthony, you did so much for the people on the other side of the screen, and I know you’ll be doing great things still in the future
🫡
I loved watching your highschool vids and now I am graduating it myself
Goodbye… I loved your perry the platypus videos. Thanks for making us laugh when we can’t. Congratulations 🎉
I've never been good with goodbyes, so hello. *Precedes to walk away*
Have a good one.
me now graduating highschool waiting for college. i grew up watching a good amount of your vids. that’s crazy.
I have never seen you or your channel before.  But… Hello! Goodbye! Good luck.
Well it was good time
❤❤❤❤❤
I had a dream that this channel had another upload. Not sure why as I have never dreamt of a YouTube channel before.  The video was "Sneaking Chicken Nuggets into People's Food", where he'd run around a cafeteria and put chicken nuggets into people's trays.
I still remember when my friend and I saw your video of the zucchinis and recreated it in our high school 4 years ago. Thank you Anthony, actually this year I will be entering college which is ironic.
Goodbye Anthpo, Ill miss u along with everyone else that laughed, smiled, and was inspired by you. Thank you, and best of luck for the future.
it was fun
It all started with harrasing people using fat yoshi 💀
wish i had friends.
anthony i watched you yes i did goodbye
my favorite video of his was when he went to his school as pary the platapus
are you going to miss making youtube videos?
oh well, see ya in a couple of years when u realize the yt is too good of a job to leave it
😢 goodbye
Idk who this is but congratulations 😊
I don't even know who you are
i remember you randomly popping up on my recoms, decided to watch you and never had a better laugh when i watched you. I hope you have the best life a person could ever imagine.
Im about to graduate high school and start my 4 years of college. You have motivated me to do something. Idk what, but somthing
Me last week: “hey Anthpo exists I wonder what he’s up to”.   Congrats on the degree… I have a long way to go on mine. One quick question tho: what was the inspiration for your name?
We're graduating at the same time, congrats! i've been here since fat yoshi, it's been a pleasure being here for the ride <3
That’s it I have been watching this guy’s contents . Never been a big fan but he was a part of my own college journey I guess. And that’s it I am going to say it today: you look like young Paul Rudd.
The brightest stars fade away the quickest. Truly one of the most underrated channels in youtube. You will be missed anthony. So so much
i'm gonna miss you anthpo! I hope the best future for you
I fucking cry
not gonna say i kept up with the channel but i do remember watching u when i was in middle school and now im going into my sophmore year. i had just moved when i was transitioning into high school and one of the people that made me happy when i had lost all of my friends and teamates, was you anthony. thank you for all the laughs you will be missed.
As someone who's only seen his video of harassing people with big Yoshi, I think I can say that he was a revolution to us all, and I hope the best of life for him and his big Yoshi career.
Good luck buddy, we'll miss you. Enjoy your graduation and hope things go well for you.  Thank you for the amazing memories.
0:37  Asian parents: "Allow us to introduce ourselves"
Ugh im starting to cry a little, you were a vital part of my childhood and it was so good seeing your channel grow and stuff. Goodby anthpo, we're all going to miss you greatly. I hope you will be ok wherever life takes you
Is he leaving YouTube
Tcho!
damn, that "go live yours" hit different, I guess I should live my life...    cya anthony
Thank you so so much for everything you have done. You have moved and made a great impact on so many lives, including my own. Your videos would always brighten my day even at my lowest point. We will miss you so much and never forget the amazing things you have done :)
goodbye
Wow you were at Kingsway!!! I’m at Kingsway now as a freshman and it’s so shocking❤❤❤
You're cool guy. Watching you was like going back in time with my friends at the high school. Thanks for sharing that. Cheers from Brazil.
As much as i didnt keep up with this channel, it still makes me both aad and proud to see him graduate, to see him say bye is both heart breaking and heart warming, i hope his life goes well from here
See ya around partner to infinity and beyond!
Goodbye anthpo,you’ll be remembered for your perry the platypus cosplays.
This feels like Unas anus all over again we will miss you have fun king
WHY IS EVERYONE I KNOW AND LOVE QUITTING YOUTUBE AT THE SAME TIME?!?!?!
It’s like Unus Annus all over again :,)
I loved the Avatar videos
0:54 Is that what I think it is? Haikyuu!! Volleyball Uniform.
Thank you. Update us in a few years!
Noooo we love you so much❤❤❤😢😢😢😢😢
It is genuinely frightening how stron of a connectiong with a guy that I've never met in real life (and probably never will) through the videos that he's made. This experience felt very personal and I don't think I've ever felt this way online. I know that I'm asking for a lot but accepting that this is the end is a little harder than I would like to admit. Deep down I still want you to make videos and I believe that you will in some form. For all this channel, Anthony, Thank you.
I was 5 days late but,  goodbye and goodluck
its been 2 years??? bro this is first video of you i watch
thank u always <3
Goodbye then
Thanks for all the good times 😊
we will miss you so much 😢
bruh i just found this channel..
Okay, but why are you quitting?
Even though I've only watched one video of yours. I somehow still felt emotional! Goodbye, and I hope you are doing well!
Bye
Don’t care
You'll be missed homie
I don’t know who you are but I’m sure you’ll be missed. Good luck.
I expected this video, the only thing I can say is, Thank You.
Really? haha... Dang Idk why, but this feels... idk...  I'm about to enroll in college, and seeing you saying goodbye since you finished college... Idk, it hits different haha
bye bye 😢
i cry
Most respectable college graduate since John College himself.
I’m kinda sad that this means he’ll never make an every episode of Aot s4 video but I wish him all the best <3
goodbye anhony wish you the best for your future endeavors
Your Perry the Platypus and Ben 10 video got me watching your channel. It's been a journey Anthony
Godspeed, Anthony "The Platypus" Po
You will be very missed. Thank you for this years!
We Love you. Its sad to see you gone, but happy for your future.
Congrats Anthony!!
thanks for all the great memories anthony 🫡
i hope you go on to do many a great things anthpo....and anyone who might read this i hope you do the same!!!! <3
Honestly, you gave me a lot of laughs and helped me find hope and happiness in a tough time. Godspeed! I remember when you said you were going to college. I went to college 1 year before you but this was my year too, 5 year track. It’s been a ride man. Some of the best stuff on YouTube. Fat yoshi will not be forgotten
take care man
wishing you the best anthony! thank you for your dedication to bringing people joy with your content
Good luck in life Anthony , u will be missed
You graduated and i'm entering college. Your videos always cheering me up in my highschool days. Thank you antpho..
I was watching since fat yoshi, Goodbye anthpo
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Why is this like the ending of a movie from the early 2000’s, when is the sequel?
Thank you for everything! You're one of the coolest dudes I've ever seen!  *Burns Perry the Platypus Suit*
Goodbye bro
*cries in Spanish*
Good riddance 🙏..& thank you (:))
NOOOOO
thx
Going to graduate senior high school this june! And months later im going to college! This channel inspired me and alot and alot of people... Thank you Anthpo for letting us see your wonderful adventures and that letting us know that what matters is enjoying the time you have left to spend whether with our family or friends. I realized how much money we spend, waste our energy, and get achievements.. what matters alot is just living to the fullest.
Bye😢
Have a good life ❤
Congratulations
Can someone remind me why Anthony is quitting YouTube? I remember he said something about after graduating he’d end it, but I completely forgot why.
Don't ever stop being a goofy goober Anthony 💙
goodbye!

I first Saw u through that fat Yoshi video and followed after that Ben 10 one, i was a college sophomore back then, watched your Perry video, walk on the beach, that super Hero one,and lotsa more. I havent been seeing the newer ones in a while but everytime i watched one of your videos it feela really fun and genuine like it feela like a bunch of friends just hanging out, and i always wanted to random stuff like that especially with my friends. well congrats on graduation day hope you'll enjoy your life while still having fun with your friends.Right now i still havent really dini college but IM getting there, especially after seeing theres like no one around anymore as my friends almost all have graduated before me, after i graduated maybe i can be with them and have fun again too
idk who u r and ive never watched u but bye ig
anthony i'm so glad to have been a part of just watching you grow not only as a youtuber,but as a person and seeing all the great times you've had in life. thank you so much for making my beginning (and the nearing end) of high school much easier for me to handle. we wish you the best and love you so much. <3
thank you for your contents
dear anthpo, i just wanted to say thank you for everything. you’ve always brought a smile on my face and inspired me to do things in life. you’ve taught many lessons and gave advice in which i still use now. i hope you do well on your journey in life and that you find a true passion. thank you again for everything anthpo. love you always and remember to stay true to yourself. ❤️❤️
You will be missed so much, and THANK YOU for the best four years of watching a content creator. Life after college is hard but once you find your way it’s amazing.
Goodbye and good luck, to all of you.
Were gonna miss you so much<3 , goodbye Anthony. I hope you have a good life.
As a junior, I had a lot of social anxiety, which ultimately made me depressed. Seeing your videos made me realize that everyone is doing their own thing and no one really cares about what you're doing (in a good way). It made me step out of my comfort zone, and as a senior, I've made so many new friends that I would have never approached if your videos hadn't inspired me too. You remind me that it's best to live in the present with friends, families, etc. I thank you so much, Anthpo, and I am grateful for you too. I hope you and everyone else have a wonderful life!
Damn. You telling us to go live ours really hit home. I just finished my freshman year of college and now it feels like I really need to just go out and live my life, for real this time. thanks for the laughs!
loser
To speak for the malaysians that you’ve probably made smile  Terima kasih Anthpo
I’ve been watching you since that viral yoshi video you made in high school, you’ve come along way since then but what hasn’t changed is your dedication to make people laugh and smile. Congratulations on graduating from a fellow college student!! I wish you all the best as you take on this next chapter of your life Anthony 😊
Finalmente, esto es cine, disfruté cada momento de este canal.
congratulations :( will miss uu
im gonna miss you bro
love u anthpo 🫡
congratulations
Ah man, I hope this isnt a goodbye, most likely a see you later. Goodbye man
I love this guy´s college
Not a hardcore fan but, I am happy for you, I don't know if you will take up this youtube thing again but, I hope you have a great life. Thanks for the memories from when I first started watching youtube. Live on anthpo.
From stealing hearts with perry, to stealing the hearts of your piers. You've been an inspiration to us all anthony, I wish you the best in your life. And I hope when you look back on all the memories you've made that all you can do, is smile. Good luck, and God bless! 🤙🏾
Wish I did what you did. But I wasn't lucky enough to be popular or accepted.
okay bye.
Goodbye perry the platypus
☹
Congratulations dude, 4 years with good & bad. I'm hoping for at least a little of a similar thing
.    o 7  / l              goodbye, have fun.   / \
I’ve only watched a few of your videos but man are you an inspiration you will be missed have a good one man. o7

Damn
Say April Fools 😢  Time Capsule Reunion in 10 years?
I immediately thought of the perry the platypus videos when someone at my school dressed in a perry the platypus onsie for our school dance, you brought a lot of laughter to me and my sister when we did see what you made, Thank You. (Also my school is a middle school the dance wasn't for charity unfortunately but we got the money from penny wars)
o7
Goodbye, I didn’t not watch all of your videos but whenever I was recommended them it would send me on mini binges. Seeing all your cool experiences with your friends just showed me how when you find your people anything can be fun and bring joy to others. And you deciding to share that joy online means so much to me and many others, that joy helped a lot of people and will continue to do so. Thank you and I hope you and your friends have good, prospective futures.
congratulations on graduating!! you honestly deserve the best thats coming for you in life, If im being honest I just found out your channel a couple months ago and you've put a big smile on my and many other peoples faces, thank you for taking the time to say goodbye and I really hope the best for you in the future <3 thank you again anthony, thank you! :)
Actual protagonist
i just found this channel, only to find out that it's ended. congrats on graduating! your videos are epic and i'll take my time watching them kinda surreal ngl
I don't even know who you are but I hope you have a wonderful life goin onwards. Make your life an amazing story for the people to be inspired.
I’ve been watching you since I was a freshman in high school and now I’ve graduated which is crazy sad to see you go but do what you think is right and enjoy your life bro🫡
You've given many laughs and smiles, so I have one thing to say. Thank you. Even though it is sad to say goodbye, at one point, we must. Achieve greatness. Goodbye, until next time.
Its been a hella of a ride, thank you, guy who harassed people with fat yoshi, you've brought me plenty of laughs
the passage of time is quite the killer haha! i remember watching the videos you made in high school, and here i am graduating too 🥲 It's been a pleasure.
Can’t believe its changed this much. The future is full of excitement and dread. Sometimes, it’s hard for us to make out what is good and what is bad. We wish to hold onto something forever but we must let it go for the better of the future.
i start college this fall and i can't wait to have as much fun as you've had. it's been an absolute blast, anthony. enjoy your bright bright future <3
Congrats Anthpo for succeding college 🎉🎉
Wait is this channel over? Why can’t he continue it?
You'll never make more money or a huge positive impact on the world like you could with this channel, but not everyone can handle that. Enjoy the 9-5, it's a lot less stressful. Take care and all the best man, you're content was awesome.
bye
Saw a few of your videos my senior year of high school in 2019. And I’ve found you on and off throughout the past 4 years I’ve been in college and am just shocked coming here now and realizing that you’re finally done the exact same time I am. Those 4 years went by way too fast. What a beautiful channel
I might have not watched every single video, but, every one I did was amazing and hilarious. You and your friends are wonderful. This channel will forever be in my heart. Wish you the best in college!
i'll see you in ten years when you open the box
Don’t leave
Gracias! Go live your life to the fullest and always remember we all adore you. To infinity and beyond ❤️🌠
I still don’t understand why your leaving
i wish you the best
We got to see you graduate from highschool into college. Then we got to see 4 years of laughs, 4 years of hardships, and 4 years of Pure, unorthadox chaos. all the way up to your graduation.  Thanks anthpo. i hope to see you again someday. (even though that probably won't happen.)
Cool poster in the back
Damn bro gonna miss you, Thank you for everything
woah it's here already? i'll miss u
A part of me just died😢
NOOOOOOOOOO
Comeback in 2 years
Man I can't believe it's over, I remember subbing years ago when u were in high school. Congrats man, I hope you make a yearly video to update us on your life
I dont understand. I watches a handful or 2 of your vids. Was it always a thing that you were only gonna use this channle while in college?
so many, so many youtubers, WHY ARE SO MANY LOVED YOUTUBERS LEAVING!
congrats and bye
This is hitting really hard today. I just graduated high school. Watching you grow through college while I grew through high school gave me something to aspire to achieve one day--not something academic, but something communal. Thank you for everything, really.
good luck out there Anthpo. i wish you the best. thx for all the smiles.
You will be missed 😢 but looking at this video this feels like a sitcom 😭
NO
I feel like him being so far away from this moment was just yesterday and I'll truly miss anthpos content Good luck with the rest of your life anthpo and thank you for making all of us laugh. 💝
Noooo youve made me laugh so many times.😢 But i guess its your life and if you dont want to be a youtuber i get that.
yay!
🫡
It reminds me of a fushigi
Hey Buddy, your life ain’t over left so where- where you heading??? Come on there is still so much do to- I mean- seriously. Come on, like you could be a thing that works for money😥 right?

Been a day one fan bro.. KEEP IT UP 0=
I did not expect to cry when this day came, but I did. Thank you, Anthony. For bringing everyone who watched your videos true joy. Even as you say goodbye, you made sure you did it leaving a smile (and tears) on people’s face as you show all the memories. With, of course, a notably sad song. I found myself both smiling and crying. Thank you Anthony :DD
Great Videos keep up the work!  in all serious, thank you for letting me laugh at the shenanigans you and your friends go on
As i suspected when i first saw this announcement so long ago, we graduated at the same time. It has been a pleasure growing up with you anthony  You may not know me, but thank you for helping me into adulthood
Just found you and you’re leaving. From all of these peoples responses though, you’ve made many people happy. Congratulations!
i love u anthpo. i will always wonder why, but will always respect your decision <3

My brother went to the same college as he did. He's actually a pretty cool dude and it's nice seeing how he was irl and in videos.

Loved this. I subscribed to the channel a few months ago but i completely felt a lot of emotions watching your videos and i can say that you found yourself a family no matter where life takes you. Thank you for being real and sharing to us a little not yet big part of your life. Keep doing what you love and thank you for inspiring us. ❤
Thank you for all the videos you've made. I only became a fan of your channel recently but I've laughed at ever single video :). This video made me tear up. Good luck with the rest of your life and goodbye <3.
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Wow. I am just going to say this. You have just said what I’ll live by. “It’s ok to not be ok.” Thanks for being one of the best you-tubers out there.
Man thank you for all the amazing videos, I hope the absolute best for you in the future!

TONY HOLY CRAP
No puedo creer que conozco este canal justo cuando lo van a dejar ir... 😢
Thank you for making me and everyone else laugh Anthpo, we'll miss you!
Video length 3:14, pi, the unending number. Poetic.
This is the most happy sad video
Here since your senior year of high school.  The time? It went by fast. Anthony Po, happy trials good sir.
If i hadn't wasted my college years and focus on myself and what i actually want, i could have had a good 4-year to remember. But i let myself to succumb to false targets, unnecessary attitudes and unreal expectations. Now that has waken me up recently, i realized i only have 1 year left, not much time left. I know there will not be much to remember. There's noway to fill up the experience or the time i have lost. Now i looked back, i know i could have been a better person, a better version of myself, i would have learned more, achieved more and even expand my network to the extend which i will be amazed of.   I've been watching your videos since my freshman year, until the end of second year. Then the third year is when i neglected myself. Up until now, i haven't really got myself together. I have made myself a mess. I regret it. But i guess things won't be bad in the future, i couldn't make my best 4 years, i will remember this forever, but i bet if i keep trying, the future won't be so glommy.  I should have written these in my own notes, where my words might be truer than here. But i guess i have to write when i can remember for maybe tomorrow i won't be able to think thoroughly.  Never thought a YouTube comment section is actually where i chose to read the most.
Have a good life man, goodbye.
its 1 april right guys😭
It feels surreal to go from chonky Yoshi to goodbye. It was one hell of a ride XD
I will never unsubscribe from this channel.
Man I remember being a sophomore in highschool first seeing your yoshi video and loving it. Fast forward and I’m seeing you leave and I’m about to start my second year in college, time flies but I’m just glad I was able to see someone as amazing and cool as you also grow and mature. I speak for everyone in saying thanks for the memories and laughs🥲
I'm gonna miss you so much, Anthony. 💕 Thank you for the laughs and the effort, you're a great content creator. Follow that bright future that awaits you!
We all wish you well in life anthpo <3
he is secured in the youtube hall of fame now We love you man
Thank you so much for sharing all of the crazy things you've done over the past four years. It was an amazing experience, and I hope whatever the future holds for you and your friends is bright.
Congratulations
Im so proud of you😢. Thank you for making my years amazing, you are an amazing inspiration to me.💖💖💖💗💗
You're welcome and thank You for sharing these moments with Us Goodbye Anthpo.
this video is giving me chills. It's been amazing watching you live your life with your friends. I'm about to cry by watching it end. I hope you have a great life, you deserve it man.
Oh no and I who literally just found your channel and got so excited :( Aww... wish you all the best
Watching this as I'm about to graduate high-school a few hours from now makes me equally excited yet sad. Just wow
thank god
U look like logan Paul
Damn man I remember when I found you with that perry the platypus video
Im so confused. What. Can youtubers only have a channel for for years
Have a cool life man, hope u don’t have too many lows. Such a bittersweet day rn :/ 👋👋
bro made my high-school years something special, Thank You Anthpo for everything.
Anthpooooo 😭
End of an era
Cya, Anthony!
Anthony, I really loved the videos that you make like the volleyball, basketball, wii, and etc. I was really sad that your gonna quit youtube. I wish you the best in life, I know my message is not that meaningful but I hope your dreams come true and if you can please upload.
He quit!...
When I say I was crying for you in the last video I was in tears home alone 😭
I haven't heard of this channel before, but I definitely have missed out on something. Because if a goodbye video that encompasses an entire channel's lifespan can make someone with no context feel something, that's something special.  Good job, and good luck anthpo
Ima little late but im glad to have watched you for the times I did
have a good life man
Thank you for these four years!!
I'm sad but i'm ok have a good live.
bye
oh shit you went to rutgers?? I got a friend who goes there lmao
Squeezie ?
I’m glad we got to go on this adventure with you :)
Thank you for all the laughs, and good luck with whatever else you do ☺️🥰
Absolute pleasure
congratulations on becoming a graduate, I hope our wishes for your success come across even half as much as the inspiration you’ve given us over the past few years
see ya around some day. ❤❤
You don’t know what you’ve got until they upload a goodbye video
bye wbm
Can't wait for the next vid!!!
Oof, time flies huh.
to be real with you, i put off watching this video for a few days, these past few months have been very very hard for me, and the end of anthpo wasn’t a thing i was ready for, but then i watched all the videos i had missed in the months that i struggled and didn’t really watch anything and kept to myself, and decided i was ready to say goodbye. i’m a freshman in highschool and i remember finding this channel when i was in middle school, anthpo’s videos made me excited for highschool, and i didn’t really experience it like those videos, watching this video made me realize that all things come to an end, but they were so beautiful while it happened. i am so lucky that i got to witness the growth of these people into adults, even though i’m still a kid, this channel has made me look forward to all of the life i’ll get to experience. to be real with you, i’m writing this in my algebra class, there’s 5 days left of school, and i want to cry, because this channel means a lot to me and has been one of my biggest inspirations and laughs. thank you to the entire ACU for giving me something to laugh at.
I got really emotional watching this. Seeing you grow from being a menace at your high school, to being a menace at college, to being such a good content creator was a wonderful journey. Thank you for the laughs Anthony. I know you're gonna go far in whatever is next for you.
Cmon bro, post sum
bro wtf i was listening to my way 2008 remastered, and I loaded up a new tab on youtube and saw the title goodbye and the wave and the "For what is a man what has he got" part came up, so fitting. goodbye athpo, im gonna miss u ❤
Thank you for the  4 years of happiness, we love you and wish you luck in future endeavors.   Damn this video was bitter sweet.
Thank you Anthpo. Please, do not become a tramp 😘😘
We wish you the best!
I just graduated high school about a week ago. I've watched your videos through-out my 4 high school years. Now i'm entering college at the same time as you're leaving. This channel has been an inspiration to me to go make friends, be goofy, and make silly memories. That will absolutely carry on into my college life. Thank you Anthpo.
<3
i jsur discovered your youtube.. guess ill watch more.
Thank you for being who you are, Anthony.
goodbye anthpo

Quite a coincidence, but thank you for making YouTube enjoyable for me during those 4 years man, been watching you since 6th grade, now I'm at 10th grade and I'm moving up/graduating as well! I don't know what life throws at me, but I'm ready to send it back at it!
You will always ve remembered by your friends and by everyone,not just because of the memes,but also bc of the person you were,and showed us who you really was,thank for everything,ant,peace.❤✌️
I will graduate from high school and starting my college life this year. I found anthpo on Youtube recently, and unfortunately I came here with a bad timing. But I'm glad to say that you gave me strength and courage to enter this new chapter of life. You also inspired me to live my life to the fullest.   Thank you Anthony... for everything. I wish you success with whatever will you do next in the future. We'll remember you, always. So long, anthpo...
Glad I've been here since the beginning. This man has given me so many laughs and I wish him nothing but the best.

the go live yours part seems funnily accurate since in September ama go to uni
I was only ever a casual observer for this channel, but you always made me laugh. I’m so proud of you for making it through college and all that you’ve accomplished. Enjoy the rest of your life, Anthony. You really deserve it!  PS: I hope the residuals from your channel act as a good financial cushion for a while for you!
bye........ we'll miss you
this shit enough to make a grown man cry…. And that’s okay.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😭

🥺🥺
It's funny how I just subscribed yesterday and you're out.  And I am watching your this video today🤡😂
I’ll miss u bro
thank you.
Hope your life is filled with even more highs So long friend🎉
Hey by the way youtube will be removing channels that have been inactive for 2 years. I don’t know how your gonna fix this but in order to keep these memories you’ve made, you gotta do something about it
this the end of the movie guys
Yeah yeah, give him a couple of months and he ll be back. That's what all youtubers do 🥱
I was never a die hard fan but I've been here since pretty much the beginning. Thanks for the laughs homie, take care
no not like this
sad
Is he gonna stop posting videos and stuff 😭?
Bruuuuh I think I subbed like 2 weeks ago... Dang it
I’ve been a fan since the perry the platypus videos and I’m deadass finna miss you bro and thank you because you helped me get through middle school I am happy that I actually found someone this goofy and entertaining that kept it real on YouTube, But like Tyler the Creator said “Don’t say goodbye bye, smell you later Anthony and once again thank you
Goodbye! It was fun!
I’ve only discovered this guy several months ago and… wow I’m still in high school trying to make the most of it and making as much friends as I can and I’m just SOOO THANKFUL you shared this whole channel as an example of how  Beautiful life can be if you just LIVE it. All the doom and gloom in the world recently and oh my gosh man, you’ve been one of those lights. Bless You Anthony 🎉 CONGRATULATIONS
Goodbye old friend, may the force be with you.
Thanks, Anthony. It's been real
You were a great youtuber.
still wont forget the day where he traumatized that one guy in the toilet stall with fat yoshi. love you anthpo, best of luck ❤
goodbye man
Its joever.
omg i love you. I wanna live my college life just like you did, thank you.
As someone who has been alone for 15 years because of social anxiety I really hate this video. It makes me sad.
da hood lost a real one 😔🙏
we love you bro TwT
from being a channel that had a tiktok house, giving out fat yoshi , wore a perry costume, etc. to some really inspiring videos and a bonding channel between anthpo and the viewers.
I can't believe its over :( Godspeed you magnificent bastard
I can't believe it... it all went by so fast.. we will all miss you very much and congratulations for graduating <3 we'll miss you and wish you the best!
I can’t believe it’s really ending.. Goodbye.
I'll miss you.
I'm not crying YOU ARE.
I'm so glad I'm one of the ppl who was here in the beginning and got to see the end of it, the amount of emotions I feel when seeing this video, thank you for everything 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
Wish you a great rest of your life ❤
will miss U dude
the tears
*so he's quitting??? And if so why... I'm sure YouTube is making him so much more money than his real job ever would. I started watching from the beginning but eventually fell off and only checked in every now and then so idk why ):*
It was fun to have accompanied you these 3 years that I have known you, I hope you have luck in your new life as a graduated adult :D
<3
IT WAS 4 YEARS AGO?!!!!!!!!
Bye buddy I hope you find your dad
Coolist dude I have seen your just so intelligent and I look up to being like that but I dont got long (17 junior) for that but however I will try my hardest and I hope you go and do what you love because no matter what i know you will do great thing : ]
He appeared suddenly in my recommendation..  Well Bye!!
Wow. Meanwhile me, having the worst experience in the college, I hate this place and wish I never came and wish I had made actual friends here, not just a bunch of egotistical people who don't care about anything that's not about them   I miss my school days though...
This is goodbye goodbye? Like you're not making any new content after this. 😔💔
I remember watching you for the first time, cracked me up. Thanks for all you've cone, and I wish you the best with whatever you choose to do in life!
A legend left us but you will be missed and you still have a special place in my heart
damn
Already?
I just subscribed yesterday 😂😂 time to binge all of the old videos
cool, mate
as someone who just started college, this means a lot, I don't always watch your content but I enjoy em when I do, I wish you goodluck on your future endeavors, it's been fun while it lasted
Gotta love your energy man. Hope you do well in whatever next chapter you're at!
I'm gonna miss you so much Anthpo, I really didn't think it'd end this quickly. The selfish part of me doesn't want you to leave.
Bye anthony, really loved all your content all the best to your future
I can confidently say that while many YouTubers or content creators I follow have had an impact on me, not one has taught me as many valuable lessons as Anthony and his friends have. Through your content I’ve learnt to appreciate my friends more and understand how important it is to make memories with them while I can. I’ve learned to cherish little moments and not take life too seriously all the time, even when things get tough or complicated. I’ve learned that college and growing up in general is only what you make of it, and it’s up to you to find the people you connect with and keep doing what makes you happy. Anthony has inspired me and reminded me to always be myself, because those who I truly love will accept me and support me no matter what. I’ve always admired Anthony’s work ethic over the past 4 years and have been inspired to continue working at my passion while also taking life day by day. I could go on in on, but long story short, I just wanted to say thank you. I’m sure I could have come to realize these valuable lessons on my own, but thank you for making them so clear with your content. Not one of your videos has failed to bring a smile to my face, and as much as I’ll miss seeing all these beautiful faces having way too much fun together, man am I glad we had it while it was here. If you’re reading this, I’m wishing you and the rest of your friends the best of luck in your futures Anthony, and as for now I’ll be finishing my last 2 years of college :)
Is there really no more anthpo??
this hits very hard and i really hope you will happy i appreciate your work from the deepest of my heart
This makes me so sad and happy at the same time
Goodbye, to you, Mr. anthpo
Fs in the chat but I'm gald I was here to witness it
Aw congratulations on everything homie :) Thanks for the entertainment and laughs, youre awesome <3
Fuck man. I love you and this channel. Thx for everything
I only just came across you, but it seems that what a community you have made. So much fun you have had. The amazing memories you made, you will cherish them all. I’m sure a lot of people will miss you. Thanks for making content for people to enjoy! Have an amazing rest of life 🎉
Don’t know you. Bye!
ive been here since you posted freakin fat yoshi around your high school and i gotta say it almost brings a tear to my eye to see how you have evolved but still manage to be human and an overall amazing person to yourself and others, im going through college rn and it gives me hope to see people like you still pushing through thank you for all you do!
No es un adiós, si no un nos vemos.
Goodbye. Thanks for all the laughs!
jesus man i never thought this day would be here
i speak for millions : "beeg yoshi will always be with you anthony!"
See you space cow boy.
Goodbye Anthony. Congratulations on graduating.
Congratz, good luck and enjoy life, thank you for everything.
man one of my favorite channel is ending and it happened on my bd XDDD but still live a good life man and cya
It’s been fun :)
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
God, I can’t believe it. I remember watching your fat yoshi video in middle school and  dying at that video. Now, I’m in high school, bawling my eyes out that a big part of me pre teen years is coming to a close. Thank you for the endless laughs, and thank you, for making my days brighter.
I think this channel is the greatest definition disproving the high school teachers when they say "they won't let that slide in college"
i am feeling so many emotions :’)
Brought me to fucking tears dude. I’ll admit I haven’t watched your videos as religiously as I would’ve loved to, but every single one that I have in engraved in my head. Wishing you the best.
ggs
Thank you for making my life a bit more bearable Anthpo :) I'm gonna graduate in 3 weeks and I thank you for being apart of my high school journey
Goodbye it was a wild ride!
If he uploads tomorrow I swear to god
This channel unironically carried me through high school. Anthpo managed to be there for all of my lows, thank you for wishing for my highs. Have an amazing time in the real world, king. The world is your oyster.
Goodbye!!!!!! We loved your videos!
Thank you so much for the awesome content throughout these years, we will miss you and we will always love you, thanks for sharing your amazing journey with us ❤
I can only wish the best for you.make sure you enjoy life.
Fuck man NOOOOO Im gonna miss your uploads so much, always loved how random and entertaining you are :)

No way bro I remember the vid were you said you were gonna upload until graduation, it was yesterday what, I'm gonna miss you tho
Nooooo Anthpo
END OF AN ERA ❤❤
Tf? He’s dating janice?
goobye anthpo
Bro this is crazy! I’ve been here since the first video! I subscribed to you when you were only at a few hundred. So sad to see you go, but thank you for all the great entertainment! You will be missed! I will be framing a picture of fat Yoshi, in your honor. Thank you again!! If you ever decide to upload again, we’ll be here waiting for you!
No.. This cant be.. Well, theres nothing i can do so.. Goodbye
Gonna miss your videos so much 😢😊
Good luck bro, im suppose to start at rutgers in a few months
Bitter sweet... I wish I found this channel sooner...
man im fr crying just watching this. thank you anthpo, you made life seem so fun, and youre right, now its my time to experience it :) thank you sososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososososossososososossoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much man, may you prosper and continue to bloom in life
Thank you for everything!!
Its sad and all, but im happy that this had an end, i prefer that, rather than just keeping uploading and just dissapearing one day, i guess its a goodbye
What!? I just found out about your channel and i just saw this! I am truly missing everything from you
So long pal, i wish you only the best in life 💕
I've been here since the Fat Yoshi videos. This channel has also inspired me. Your outgoing nature in college really helped me with my first year of university, so thanks for that, we will all miss you 😢
I can’t believe it’s already time, feels so soon, you’ll be missed, by all of us
:(
We will miss you :')
👏👏👏
Go on my man, hope to see you turn up some day. I know not here, but perhaps somewhere else...
From Perry the Platypus to all you've become... thank you Anthony. You've been a constant in my life during the last 5 years, both in the good and the bad times. Hell, even during my own college experience in the US, something that wasn't remotely in the picture when I started watching your videos. Now both of us have graduated and new things await, but in your college years I see my own reflected. And I want to thank you for that, and wish you good luck in whatever comes next.
godspeed anthpo!!!
nice
So happy to have been here throughout the journey <3 love your content and your channel, thank you!!
Enjoay
Thank you for so many laughs, Anthony. High school sucked a lot and sometimes the only thing I would smile or laugh at in a day would be your videos. I’m gonna miss you so much and wow I’m tearing up writing this. I wish you nothing but the best in the future💕
I started watching back when I was in HS. About a year ago and despite not really graduating at the same time, it feels like I was along for the wild ride. I think many others will the same thing.
Its been a great time watching these amazing videos I only hope for the best for anthpo.
I’m starting college next semester. And there’s nothing I’ve been more terrified for. So thank you sharing your experience with us. You may never know me, but it helps.
It was really fun watching your videos over the years thank you
i can't believe i'm graduating at the same time as you. video makes me think not just of your own channel, but also of the fact that i'm leaving a major chapter of my life behind too. congratulations anthpo!!!
Thanks for letting us watch you grow. Good luck brother.
Bibi
Goodluck man! You've made me smile so much through the years and I hope your life will be as great as how you've made us feel!
Haven't watched the video yet, but oke dokie cya later anthpo; hope you print out a beeg yoshi for me
Damn it I just found this channel... at least I have some videos to catch up to but goodluck to u and the next chapter in your life !! <3
It's sad to think you'll be not uploading anymore, Anth. I'm glad you were able to share with us a small part of your big life. You have passion and it will take you far, no matter where you go.
Are you gay or dating Janice I can’t tell
This is so awesome. I remember watching your old videos and as you’re graduating college I’m going in. My graduation from high school is on the 23rd. It’s been a journey. Thank you Anthony.
Thank you for making my day better every day. I am sad to see you go and I loved this wacky channel. good luck out there in life, and thank you for being here for us.
Thank you, Anthpo. You made me smile from the first time I saw the fat Yoshi video. You have been an incredible source of light and joy in my life and I’m so grateful you shared your shenanigans with us. Have an amazing life, Anthony. We’ll miss you. ❤
I haven't kept up with Anthpo for years, but the videos that I /did/ watch are some of my favorites ever.  Thank you, Anthpo.

thank you for everything anthpo i wish you luck in life
was hoping wed get a feet reveal but ok
:9
Thanks for everything man
Surreal watching all the time pass. I hope the future goes well for you. Congrats on graduating and all your friends 🫡🫡
I thought you were leaving Youtube. Disappointed.
did anthpo really just use my favorite song for his goodbye video…  thank you so much for everything, your videos took my entrance into junior high school, a very dark time for my mental health, and made it just a little happier. i’ll miss you so much.  (p.s. i start high school this september!)
I know its a cliché line but its the only thing i think needs to be said right now. Its been real.
i dont know what to say. i will miss this channel so much, and it literally pioneered my childhood. i will miss this channel so much. everyone else wrote paragraphs, but i just cant articulate my words right now. goodbye, i will miss you.
Wow I want to cry right now. I never thought it would end so soon. I really don't want to accept you're stopping content creation
Woah bro went to rutgers? If ide have gone to another campus I could've met this dude that's wild to me. I'm so glad you had amazing friends and experiences through looks like a legendary time
i liked the part where it didnt end
I was wondering where you went on my fyp bro, I’m sad that this is the last time I’m gonna see one of your videos but honestly this short journey was one of the most sweet and memorable things I’ve got the privilege to see. I wish you guys the best
PLEASE DONT GO, NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO😭😭😭😭😭
One day he will be in his 40's looking back, this is why i love youtube to begin with the ability to have highlights and videos to look back one for the future
🫡
went from harassing people with a zucchini and fat yoshi to being a college graduate that brighten everyone's day every time you uploaded, im honored to follow your life 4 years ago and its gonna be sad to see you go, but we all have to move on and make memories just like you did, so goodbye anthpo ill forever remember you, you helped me through my depression and made my days better, where ever youll be in life i just hope your happy
WHATTTTTTTT I THOUGHT THERE WAS LIKE 27 DAYS LEFT??? NO IM GONNA MISS YOU ANTHPO 😭
2 weeks away from my high school graduation. Imma miss you buddy.
Going to go terrorise people with fat yoshi in your memory
Your channel has given me so much hope for the future. Thank you, Anthony. We will cherish these memories.
anthony we all would love to say that this was the most emotional, wholesome, and warmest vieo u have posted and that we hope you get great opportunities in the future.   to one of the most greatest youtubers out there we hope u have a good life

Guys I just got here whats going on
Thank you Anthony. Best wishes. Happy graduation.
i remember when you first made this channel. its amazing how far you have come and how far your going. i also have grown along side you. only being a year younger. i wish you best on your journey's anthpo. thank you for an amazing channel, and past few years of quality entertainment!
This is like unus annus all over again
Noo don't goooooooo
The start of an era where we sit and watch a guy recreate avatar, do silly stuff, hopped into a Korean band. Anthpo. The legend. The platypus. The person who has nerf battles on campus. The Era of his time on YouTube has gone. We hate to say goodbye but it's life. You gave us a mindset, and aimed us to use it wisely. Thank you. ❤️ :)
Thanks yoshi man for all the laughs
😭 sobbing congratulations tho❤
Always interesting when you get recommended one of these goodbye videos and you’re just like… ‘wow which funeral did I stumble into this time? I’ll just pretend to cry so I don’t stand out.’ Since well, I sure wasn’t here for those four years-
Thank you for this experience Anthpo, there’s truly not any one like it out there :)
A perfect ending to a chapter :( bye anthpo
who are you
Your content was amazing, i hope for the best in your future ❤❤❤
We will miss you! ❤
❤❤❤
NO WHY NO PLEASE NO
burger
Bye
Yo Anthony idk if your gonna see this but I have a brother who’s name is Alec who goes to Rutgers and you popped into my feed I’m like wait a minute I know this guy.. small world dude
you're actually the goat
I found out about you through the fat yoshi video a few years back and since then i'm very glad that I stuck along with you and your channel and you have truly done such a great job at making tons upon tons of people happy and sharing your funny life experience with school with all of us. I'm so glad I was here for the whole ride and maybe one day we could see you in the future again. It was truly amazing to see your channel grow and to see you grow as a person in just a few years. I think I can speak for everyone when I say we all wish you the best of luck with whatever you are trying to pursue in life and we all hope the best for you.
i didn’t watch you so much but you were cool. good bye anthpo
also don't go on some speech just say goodbye and get the hell out of here
Finally like god man no one really liked you anyways and we could use the views man
Best of wishes to you, thanks for everything
I’ve been watch for so long bro and congratulations on graduating I hope you live a long prosperous life Anthony <3
But you didn’t finish the stranger things skits
This made me tear up, everday i was looking forward to your videos, now... there gone Thanks for all the laughs Anthony
Thank you Anthony.  Your channel has helped me through some seriously tough times in life. Every time I felt down or alone I'd put on your videos and you'd help me through it. I'm graduating highschool in 2 days and go off to college in August. I hope to find friends like yours and make as good of memories as you did. You're an inspiration to us all and we all love you very very much. :)
Congratulations, and good luck in the future. Thank you for all the great memories.
thank u...
screaming crying
Thank you, I tip my hat to you, and the good laugh you gave me. Love from France, congrats for everything, and good luck for the futur
Who r u
I started watching this channel four years ago at, that time I was in my last year of high school. This channel has inspired me to enjoy every little moment that I go through during my years of studying, my graduation from college is exactly 30 days away and I'm doing the best I can to enjoy life with my friends while being myself. I've enjoyed watching this channel from the beginning till the end. It gives me goosebumps when I see that my studying trip is ending with the end of this channel, it's both sad and happy. life never stops and we must move on and focus on ourselves and our dreams. Thank you anthpo for the great content, and I wish you the best of luck for your future.
I started watching you when you posted the avatar videos I’m going to miss u
Im graduating hs this week so feels appropriate
I perfectly set my sound to 50% without having to struggle getting an even number today.
What an amazing end and start to my college experience. Thank you anthpo you taught me maybe even a weird ass dude like me can have fun in a place full of strangers lol
wtf is you
May these videos forever be remembered
This is one of the 1st videos of yours I’m seeing. Idgi did you make a deal that you’d stop YouTube after graduating?  1)why? 2)from this video you seem like you’re super good at this, would be a shame to end this
I thank you for being a part of my college life as well. Love your content, I wish you the best of luck! 🙂
Congrats!! I'm so glad I was able to watch your journey even though I haven't been here every step of the way, I love how dedicated you were to make fun experiences for all of us. From the bottom of mine and many others' hearts, thank you!
Man this hurts, I've been subbed since the high school days and seeing you live the life that I wanted to was awesome. Best of luck, and keep it up. :):(
I am not ready
Thank you so much for everything….. This channel made me so happy. I wish the best to you and the rest of the gang❤
People will come back to this an realize how much fun this channel was to have experienced along side each release, but at leat new viewers will get to also experience it, maybe not as the same as all of us, but still
I can’t do this
As an anthpo watcher for 2 years im left with bittersweet feels. Continue your story, live on proud. o7
Thanks for keeping it real, Anthpo. I'm going to miss your uploads but I'm so happy for your graduation and I'm impressed by your decision to just go out and live your life. You've been my favourite youtuber for a couple years and I know I'll look back fondly at your videos in my future. I wish you all the best! You're a certified classic :)
It was awesome
:')
Congradulations,thank you for the laughs and smiles i wish you the best of luck❤
i love your vid but ill hope the best for u
I remember watching this channel before he graduated high school and now here😢
Good riddance
real one fr
NOOÒOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
why does he have to stop doing youtube tho?
screaming. crying. on the floor. 😭
absolute legde
I don't cry when I watch videos but this one almost got me the moment I saw fat Yoshi. ;-; that video was the very first Anthpo video I watched and Ive been subbed since. I didn't realize his presence was temporary 😢
crying rn. im gonna miss looking forward to your uploads so much and i know im not the only one that genunely only wishes the best for u. please keep your head up high even when u feel at the lowest. all love <3 .
The worst part is that in 2 years this guys channel might be removed
I literally bought a perry the platypus onesie because of you, and i won't stop using it now.
Stumbling upon this channel was one of the highlights of my life, and it helped inspire me to just go do things with my friends while we’ve still got the free time to spare.  Thanks for harassing people with fat Yoshis, running around in a Perry the Platypus costume, and most importantly just bringing joy to everyone who’s found this channel. Best of luck in all of your future endeavors.
Nah you ended after 4-5 videos anyways. Cya.
We’re going to miss you Anthony thank you for everything, farewell ❤
Thank you so much Anthpo for giving us all hours upon hours of entertainment, wishing you well!
Why did I find him a few days after quitting. YOUTUBE YOU SON OF A BITCH 😭
See ya space cowboy.....
Man, glad he's done. No more competition for future creators lol
I'm not ready to see you go.
I wish I was surrounded by family and friends that have such a loving atmosphere like your do. Just watching your vids make me feel part of your group. Thank your for thag

From seeing you break dance in a Perty the platipus costume to graduating college. The end of an era for sure, thanks for sharing your journey with us and all the smiles you place on our faces. Good luck in your next chapter in life!
Going to miss the goat of irl content 😢😔
I was offline for a while. And I came on to find this! Not what I was expecting and definitely not what I needed. We’ll miss you Anthpo. You were there when no one else was. Thanks for these wonderful years. I’m not sure I’m ready to officially say goodbye, I don’t think anyone is. I’m currently bawling my eyes out. We love you Anthpo. There’s really no good in goodbye is there? See ya Anthpo.   “This isn’t a goodbye, it’s a see you later.”
goodbye anhtony good luck
delete the channel you wont.
Crazy your graduating college I remember the video when u graduated high school
Cannot believe the first video i see of this awesome guy is the the video where he says goodbye, Gosh darn it youtube. Anyway, i wish you good luck in your life now that your gonna start living it yourself, with your friends, loved ones Goodbye Anthony We'll all always remember you♥️
Congratulations on graduating Anthony!!! I have always and will come back to your videos when lost. Thanks for these past couple of years.
Congrats. <3
Hey man, thanks. I'm glad I was able to be a part of this... ride? If this was a ride, then it was probably a rollercoaster which had broken rails with a crazy blue platypus following me, and I enjoyed and cherished every part of it. I hope your journey goes well and you find even greater happiness, and I hope your life is fulfilling and enjoyable. Live a long life dude, you deserve it after brightening all of ours. These 4 years were incredible, so thank you, and goodbye Anthony, anthpo. - Chiefy
This will be one hell of a video to show your kids
Damn.
Ive rewatched this so much, remember stumbling across the old videos in recommended early days, then kept coming back for each upload❤ you truly gave me such an amazing break from life and i am so grateful, i know that you are ready to move on, but i hope that one day in the future you will give us an update just to tell us how mr fatyoshi is doing ❤
I have followed you since the beginning, and I am very happy to have seen your development as a person. I hope for the best for you and  have a good trip  goodbye
i think i’ll miss you forever
Damn, from an Australian dude who’s loved the vids since the Perry the Platypus highschool days, best of luck in the future mate. We’ll be cheering for you.  Welp. Glad to see you’re back (HE WENT TO A WHAT⁉️)
bub bye
I think that it was late in the pandemic when i started watching Anthony. Pretty sure it was the Yoshi paper video or the one where he dresses up like Mario and chases around kids or something. I just couldn't stop watching and now it's over. This isn't just a goodbye and he returns a month later type thing. No. This is real and I'm happy I was there to seem him progress. Thank you Anthony.
esse cara é daora.
"don't be sad it's over be glad it happened" is what I would have said if i was basic, but SIKE we gonna go out with a bang 🎆
The ride was fun man, I hope one day we will see you again.
Goodbye man! Have a fulfulling and fun life!
This is one of the most depressing yet joy making videos ever
You're gonna be missed, man- Sorry to see you leave.
Congratulations all the best for your future
Now it's time for so long But we'll sing just one more song Thanks for doing your part You sure are smart You know, with me and you And my dog, Blue We can do anything That we wanna do!
goodbye, anthony po, i wish you very good luck in your future endeavours, and thank you for making my life in these past years just a bit better 🩶
How long until he misses it so much he comes back? 😅
It's sad because I still kinda expect to wake up and see that little red dot by anthpos name.
The last year I haven't been around the channel much but i'm incredibly glAd I came back to see this, I look forward to catching up on what I missed.  Thank you Anthony for being a great person.
Is OKPOP gonna disband?
thank you for every smile anthpo! you were such an amazing creator, i'm very proud of your jorney.
dude we love you so much, thank you for this amazing journey you shared with us. congrats and good luck for the future man 💗💗💗
Hi. I've been watching you for a while. Maybe 1 or 2 years? And I fell in love with your videos. As someone who has a very hard time staying focused, finding videos that interest me, and sticking with them, your videos have never failed to entertain me. If I was asked the question "Who is your favorite person?" that would be obviously pretty hard to answer, but I was thinking about it earlier, and I think if I had to choose a favorite person that I know/know of, I think it would be you. Thank you for being funny, kind, understanding, and pretty transparent. Your channel means a lot to me, which is funny to think about, cause I don't even know you. I aspire to be like you. Or at least the you that you portray to us. But I have a feeling, even though people say not to meet their idols, if I met you, I wouldn't be disappointed in the slightest. Because you are a good human being. And I appreciate that. Thank you for sharing your journey with us, congratulations on graduating, and I truly wish you the best luck in life. Just know, whatever happens, wherever life leads you: You are a good person Anthony. Keep an open mind towards people. Keep being s good friend. You are allowed to do things for yourself. And, thank you for making my, and so many others lives better. Perry would be proud. Have an amazing life man, you deserve happiness. (Not to say that other people don't deserve happiness, but with all of the happiness you spread, you in particular deserve to be lifted up just like you life others.)
NOOOOOOO but YESSSSSS because u graduated
God I’m gonna miss your channel I hope whatever you do in life is successful you’ve inspired to come out of my shell to really experience life and I could never thank you enough for that love you and your channel!
I was here
I don’t want to say goodbye but it’s not my choice you’ve made me laugh for the past year through some of my worst and it’s hard for me to let go but something that comforts me is knowing that in 10 years u could be… you could be…
See ya m8
Dont know who you are but gl
goodbye anthony, been here since day 1 and stayed until the end.
i don’t even know who u r lol
SOBBING MY FUCKING EYES OUT
never been so upset in my life
bye
Congrats Anty !!!
I'm actually tearing I can't believe this is the last video, this was one of my favorite channels since 2018 and to see them go its upsetting..congratulations on graduating I wish you the best future goodbye Anthony
It feels like it's been more than 2 years
Mans quitting youtube because he can’t vlog becoming the US president <3
Dude ur making me cryyyy
GODDAMN… congrats anthony <3 and happy retirement <3
Thank you Anthony, tomorrow is my final day of high school before graduation day. I’ve been to 3 high schools and as much as it hurt starting over so many times, it honestly made me who I am. I wish I could see everyone I’ve met graduate at the same time, but that’s not possible so I’ll take what I can. This message has really helped because life is really only getting started.
Just watched one of the first videos I ever watched on your channel and I feel sad even though I barely even watched your channel hope you have a good life
Goodbye Anthpo. You were an amazing content creator and I hope your future is a happy one.
It's like a big brother moving out, thank you for everything. We love you
God tier content, Goat tier Anthony. You just made me want to make content again thank you for the motivation I’ve been looking for, for months
Crap
I honestly don't know what to say... I came acrossed some of your videos because of the perry the platypus videos but I forgot to sub and didn't start coming acrossed your videos until a couple popped up in my feed recently, what crazy and awsome journey! Great video to end an era.😂❤😢
I think I never wrote a comment a your channel before, but I watched your videos since like 2019 and always enjoyed them! It was so much fun, but also learn things about life and to make the best out of everything. I started watching the channel in school and now I´m at my second semester in University in Germany. Your videos helped me to be more open and take every opportunity possible to connect with people, find friends, have fun and enjoy life! I´m so thankful for that and you will always be a great inspiration for me!  Thanks for everything!  ps. It is really interessting for a German to see, how life, school, college, people and the USA in general is, throw the view of a american and someone who is similar age then me :)
That was lovely, goodbye Anthony, wish you the best !
I just subscribed not too long ago I hate that I just became a fan of yours not to long ago but I am glad that I have seen some of your videos you seem like a great guy and I hope that you reach your goals in life!
This is gonna be his last video?
This hit me hard. I can't believe it has been so long. I first found you through your Adventure Time video, one of my favorite videos from my favorite tv show. It's crazy to see how much has changed so far for us all
Congrats anthpo, I followed since the beginning and it's nice to see a happy ending, don't stop being weird now that you're done with college
Happy future!!!
The fact that I also graduated college a few days ago made this last video even more bittersweet. thank you for the past 2 years and good luck on your next journey!
Although it will be sad to see you go, sometimes it’s better to go out shining like the brightest star in the sky, rather than slowly fading out into nothingness.    Good things never last forever, after all   I wish you all the best of luck with what is to come, and hope that life treats you well for all these years to come.  Maybe one day you will come back and see just how far you’ve come.    But until then, and one last time…  Goodbye, I wish you all the best of luck in your future endeavours. 💖
And I thought the end of Unus Anus was emotional 🥺😭
Im gonna watch all of the videos aslong as you say that you will make a last video
I'm seeing this as I am about to graduate high school in 3 weeks. I've watched Anthpo since my sophomore year and I've always loved watching the total chaos in every video. It's crazy knowing all of this is going to be over and it's starting to finally hit me. No more of that sappy sh!t though. thanks Anthpo <3
I'm sad but happy u r happy
This made me so emotional as I've been watching you basically grow up for the past 5 years. Your content never disappointed and kept getting better with each video. It was such a normal part of my own life  so I am sad to see it go, but I am glad that you are finishing this chapter on a high note. Take care, Anthony!
please tell me you will make more vids!!!!! i loved your vids ecspessialy the bed race:(
i’ve been watching u for so long so it actually being the end is just so amazing 👍🏽
Thank you for everything :)
Thx man I don’t what to say so Thxs man see ya
Im really going to miss you anthony.
I genuinely forgot about this- but anyways, it was a fun journey and i hope the future brings good things your way, thank you Anthony! We’ll miss you! <3
Always sad to see another channel  go, welp your channel is up there with the other's ive kept in my mind for years rent free and shaped who i am as a person. Unus anuss, Cow Chop, The Creatures and now you, may this channel have my thanks
Sad to see you go, but Glad I was here to watch everything over the years. I salute and wish you the best.
Idk who you are or why I'm subscribed. Goodbye, I guess
fucking legend
So.... no head?
Screw you (in a good way) but honestly thank you anthony po for the smiles and the tears, we love ya but i wouldnt say bye yet
I haven't been an avid Anthpo watcher, but I've seen some of the collab work, and it was great. Now, seeing this little highlight reel and feeling the joy oozing from every frame, I may have to go back and watch it myself. Have a great life!
An incredible journey ❤
i cant bring myself to watch the graduation video because if i do then its over
Goodbye internet friend :) , congratulations on your graduation
thought that was logan paul for a second
Wait is he never posting again?
do a last yoshi vid
We love you so much,hope we can be much better than before.Thank you for being my friend for so so long,Anthony.Goodbye.2023/5/18 23:12❤❤
love u
been here since the big yoshi video. thanks for all the laughs!
I'm not gonna act like I was a hardcore fan and kept up with this channel, but you have really gifted so many people with laughs as a result of your hilarious content that even I have loved and watched from time to time.  I still remember lowkey binging your high school/early college videos when I was in high school, and now I will graduate soon too. Thank you for existing. We wish you the best 💙
Thank u man ❤
makes 4 years of amazing content, refuses to elaborate, leaves.
Im just wondering if he'll still be in some other youtuber vidros every now and then like Alpharad
Good vid bro, can’t relate with the “Now it’s time to go live yours” cause I am 19 year old shut in neet loser. Anyways good luck and I hope you have a wonderful future.
Best of luck for you ❤
Wow this channel is amazing! Since the start, it has been an inspiration to help others enjoy their lives. And it ended with that purpose. I am so grateful this channel exists, thank you Anthpo for your videos!
Only you could make college a fun experience
o7 anthony, o7.
Congratulations on graduating, good luck!
Getting the goodbye tattooed on my arm, thank you so much genuinely from the bottom of my heart Anthony. I’m severely disabled meaning I can’t do a lot of fun things and I’ve never had any friends my whole life and getting to live vicariously though you and seeing what a friend group is like… this experience was like gold to me I wouldn’t trade the last two years for anything. Thank you for getting through college, and thank you for getting me through the pandemic. Godspeed brother.
pi
Damn.
I hope you fly far, wherever your journey takes you.
found this man when i was a freshman in high school and he was a senior giving out fat yoshis. time flew. im wrapping up freshman year of college and hes done with school😞
proud to say i’ve been here from the very beginning. Sad to see you go but I think I can speak for everyone when I say I can’t wait to see where you go from here. Congratulations bro
❤
so happy for you dude. this youtube channel has been my go-to eating entertainment channel since forever. i was always so lonely and every one of your videos always cheered me up. i hope u know how much of what you've done had impacted so many of us. life WILL take you to great places ! so excited to see it !
My brother in Christ. It has been a fun ride. o7
Congrats on graduating!  Even though I don't know you personally, I'm so proud of you, your content has made many people laugh in hard times. You had an impact in all of us, and I'm so grateful for it, you've created such a wonderful thing, and I will never forget about it. We'll miss you, Anthony. :) <3
Neber heard of him but the youtube algorithm brought me here
thank you man, so gif damn much for being here.
I’m gonna miss you and all your shenanigans Anthony
Who are you
I’ve loved all your videos from the beginning to the end, especially during quarantine just seeing you still make videos and power through being yourself was very inspirational, Anthpo will always hold a great place in my heart and I’ll probably end up rewatching a lot of these videos, so for one last time, Goodbye
I'll miss this channel so much
wow anthpo is so cool i wish i had friends
I loved everything you shared with us, thank you and wish you the best always
farewell ant o7
ive been watching since 3 years ago and ive got to say in a blink of an eye everything flew by. i wish you all the best and hope you one day come back to this channel and upload a life update. goodbye anthony
wait, wtf I just got here
Thank you anthpo for making me smile and entertained me every day, this is probably the most wholesome channel I’ve ever seen, gave me chills every single time. Thank you for everything❤️
Congrats on graduating, Anthony! All the best for your bright future!
GG lets go man, you did it!
thank u.
Bye bro! Best of luck!!! Thanks for all the fun videos!
so i might have missed a few videos but why is he leaving?
GG thanks for everything
Thank you for the adventure you gave us
goodbye
2:46 it hits to hard dude but its weird that this is the most impactful advice anyone has ever given me. you were like my comfort zone and to lose you is like losing a best friend but to get this attached toa youtuber is pretty stupid so thats my bad and i guess ill just see u in ten years 😉
This feels surreal. Thank you for sharing so many beautiful and extremely hilarious moments with us, Anthpo. This feels weird to say on literally the last video but I believe this is why YouTube even exists in the first place — a place to share human experiences and the emotions that go along with them. Again, thank you so much for being there with us on this journey! Love you, Anthpo.
day four of missing anthpo
If you even consider changing your mind, we will stay with you till the end.
Almost cried watching this, big congratulations on your journey and what you’ve achieved
o7 for the bravest youtuber ive ever seen.
peace out
my favorite people keep leaving me
Nice
You're a G, bro, loved the content you put out for the past few years it was an amazing journey! Glad I could be here for it!
Goodbye mate.
I can't say goodbye :(
This is really the haircut and outfit you chose for this occasion 😭
My favorite YouTuber + my favorite band? Oh man, I'm tearing up 😭😭😭  Thank you for all the laugh!! 😭👍
About to graduate college in a few days like you. I gotta say it's feels so special that I'm in the same year as you, watching you grow the same time I have. That's one of the big reasons why I subscribed to you, aside from your hilarious content. And before you know it, now we're gonna be set off into the next stages in our lives, and I'm glad to know that we are on the same page here. Godspeed to adulthood, Anthony, and all of the Class of 2023.
Well we will miss you man. Thank you for the good videos Anthony.
I was here when dof kick perry the platypus 😢
will miss you anthony, hope u post a video someday and update us about your life
Thanks Anthony!
You set the mood for my time at university. I'll be doing all the weird shit you were doing cause it is what makes life so funny and awesome.  Thank you for sharing your life, it has made me believe in mine.
See you guys next year when I randomely have the urge to watch this video again
Never seen this channel but it was recommended...
Goodbye Anthpo. It has been good times and sad times. I will always remember you as the greatest college student who made youtube videos. I know you graduated now and not making any videos now, i hope you make a comeback in the future.
Goodbye
I feel like now is a great time to share this story, back, before covid, when i was still in high school. The school i was attending decided to change the school identity (our previous one was the rebels) so in a pinch they scrambled together some boring ass options, HOWEVER at the time anthpos BEEG yoshi video exploaded. And so the school had rallied to get big yoshi to be the front runner. People took action, announcing  it over the PA's,  random students would take to the halls in political rallies for the beeg yoshi's, it was all in vein the school was called the jets in the end. But it was fun, goodbye anthpo, thankyou.
nice content
My question is why, mans is probably making more than enough to live off of from his videos so why stop.
It has been a long journey like all journeys it comes to a end
Thank you man for this great channel. It has been a journey, and i and everyone was glad to watch it. I mostly remember the time in 2020 when i watched my first video of this channel and made my day instantly better. Have a amazing future!
Wait he and janice are dating?
Are you playing security guard in the fnaf movie?
This is a good prank, Anthony actually graduating? That’s hilarious he hasn’t attended a class, ever. (I love you Anthony, goodbye) ((not in a parasocial way))
This was an awesome run to watch!!!
so goog
Great job on your accomplishment!
Please do post here occasionally. It's super depressing. Don't leave us entirely.
Noooo😭  I'm gonna miss u so much😭😭😭
congratulations my friend, im so happy to know you graduated. Your videos were such an important part of my whole recovery from a severe depression i had to go through, your videos filled me with hope, the hope of getting better everyday, the hope of trying my best everyday, the hope to live an actual life, not the "life" i lived where i just layed in bed for 10-12 hours a day. Now im so much better, finally entering college and starting a whole new life. Thank you anthpo for all the good moments, good memories and the strength you gave me.  (sorry for the bad english, im not native and i haven't practiced in a while)
I really didn’t want this to end, this journey has been very fun. Congratulations on graduating, thank you, and goodbye. 🫡
This made me so genuinely happy, we’re gonna miss you sooooo much Anthony :) I hope life treats you well
I won’t cry, I won’t cry…… ❤
I hope you have a fulfilling life!!! Congrats to you!!
Saw your first few vids when you were in highschool, time seriously flies. Gl on the next chapter of your life
This makes me so sad
Your videos always made me laugh , thats Anthpo for the amazing time! We wish you the best for the future. Im not even upset , im so utterly happy for you right now it was a beautiful journey.<3
i cant believe it. thank you anthony ill see you again one day
NOOO AOT S4
this was so heartwarming
Did not realise how much I cared for this channel till this moment, lots of laughs, and stupid moments shared throughout the years. Thank you, Anthony!
Go be an actor now
We'll miss you so much Anthony, I still can't believe you went from harassing ppl in a perry the platypus costume to (in my opinion) being one of the best Youtubers in the 21st century.  Love u man and all of ur friends too ❤❤.
I just graduated high school today so tomorrow morning I take my first steps into summer and then the beginning of the rest of my life good luck mate
WE’LL MISS U ANTHONY ♥️♥️
I remember this dude running around his high school as perry the platypus. He did a really good job growing over Covid and so forth. o7
See ya mannnnn... I’m not ready for this😭
One of the best channels in a long while
Congrats Anthpo, you've done it, you've made a fantastic channel all before graduating college. Have a great life man
Damn, started watching with beeg yoshi when I was a sophomore in college, never thought I’d still be in school when you retired but I’ve got one more semester of grad school left and now I’m feeling old af, thanks anthpo
Thank u for everything Anthony seriously.  I love y’all and I’ll miss y’all sm y’all have no idea😭😭🫶🏻 (I called you and Janice from the beginning btw)
damn… i guess thats it….. i cant express the feelings im feeling right now… you were one of my favourite youtubers… i cant belive you’re leaving, heh, kinda makes me feel like the whole eddsworld situation, thank you, for everything you’ve made my life…. better. take care, wherever you are now. goodbye.🤝
I started making videos because of you, and I'll always be greatful. See you in the stars.
I'll go live my life in a minute or two, once the tears are gone. I just need this moment to sit.
:( goodbye anthpo youve achieved over then less of my expectations
man. 🥲
girl i'm about to graduate 8th grade what the hell
Thank you🐐🐐🐐
im watching this for the second time now (the first when it was first was uploaded) and i am a sobbing mess. there will never be another anthpo. and this channel  was seriously one  of the few channels that encapsulate what i value the most; friendship. friends are always there for you and while they are sometimes rude or can end up not being good people. you will always have those memories and be able to reminisce on them. i'm almost 18 and still in high school and this anthpo was one of the few youtubers who i looked up to during this time. i know nobody cares about what i have to say and i feel like im just trying to make something thats actually a good thing look like a bad thing but its not. im so proud of anthpo for graduating and making the most out of every moment during his college years. it just had fully hit me how close it was to actually being over. and it's important to always make the most out of everything. you will have bad days and you will have good days. but one bad day doesn't define the rest of your future. it will get better. thank you <3   -rei
Man when I found you I watch every signal video enjoy watching them and there where the best!Thank You for making me laugh non stop Anthony 👋
Thank you, Anthony. I've been watching you since the Ben 10 stuff, the fat yoshi pictures, and the Perry the platypus suit videos. Every video you have made has made me smile. Thank you, not only for entertaining all of us for these past four years, but thank you for helping me through rough times in my life, and thank you for everything. I wish you the best of luck in the rest of life. Goodbye.
Graduating high school in like 4 days and your channel has been a very nice, consistent source of joy throughout the past 4 years.  Thank you so much for the fun your channel brought. Your videos actually helped inspire me to be more confident, and showed me that just being yourself unapologetically (As long as you're not hurting ppl obviously) is one of the best things you can be. Thanks man.
Off topic but did anyone else think he dressed like Arthur Read in the best way possible here 🫣😭
Have a good life anthpo we well miss you so much goodbye.
loved the content you made
I’m confused? There was always a set plan to quit after college? I graduated college and still have hobbie time
Started by harassing people with fat Yoshi, little did he know he made all of our days a little better. We will miss you Anthony!!! Thank you for making me a happier person
goodbye young  soul
(written straight after waking up so might edit later lmao)  I don't leave comments much, but I guess I gotta get it out of my chest because you uploaded 2 videos in my dream already 😭 I'm here thanks to Perry the platypus in high school video. I checked the rest of the channel and I really liked it. The content is so weird in a good way. Was in 9th grade back then, now I'm a first year at the uni.  You were brightening my mood with your every video. I kinda wish be like you: funny and so damn confident, but social anxiety kind of overshadowes all of my wishes sadly, however it got a little better recently!! It hurted me when I first saw the "goodbye in ____" video, but I tried to not think about it, maybe it won't be like that- Definitely not ready to say goodbye, but I have to. Thank you for everything, Anthony. I wish you to have as much fun as you had in college. I'm gonna miss you. Goodbye man ♥️
Does this mean no more videos
Amazing
To quote George Washington     "Live your life, my G"
Haha I love late April fools😂😂
Fuck man, he made it very easy to laugh when I was down, Anthony, dude, I wish the best for you, thank for your videos, I shed a tear
Goodbye anth
I officially just graduated highschool at the same time you finished college. I’m right alongside you, and have been since freshman year. Thank you for everything.
Don't be sad because its over, be happy it happened
I wake up on my birthday, to find this. It made me cry, 4 years of entertainment that i'll miss, thank you for every laugh.
I plan on going to a trade school/ technically college, I hope my experience is close to this.
Goodbye to you sir, I enjoyed it while it lasted, but get a job and make your parents proud!
There isn’t anything to to say but Thank You
Best of luck anyhony and thankyou for making our years more special❤
just graduated anthpo, you make me very excited for college
Bruuuuh you have such a solid youtube career! Why quit now?! :(((
I don’t want to lose another of my heros. I lost techno last year. I’ll miss you man. Good luck in your future endeavors. Thank you.
Goodbye Anthpo.

Man this one really hit different, Iv'e been watching for a while and what's crazy is as you leave college I'm about to start my own college career. Thanks for making me laugh all the time.
Oh my god
All I have to say is, Thank you, Anthony
"Now it's time to go live yours" Hits way harder when you're in your graduating year of highschool. To 2023, to the end of the end, and the beginning of the beginning.
I've only started watching your videos recently. However as someone who is about to start college in the fall, I just pray to have a fraction of the fun you had, always wanting to make others smile. Go do great things man.
We’ll miss ya man :(
IT’S BEEN FOUR YEARS??😭
is anthpo quitting youtube after graduating? why?
Now it’s time to go live yours got me man I hope your still the same amazing person for the rest of your life
I hope for the best for you Anthony, and hope that your wild antics never cease🥲🫡
I’ve never seen this guy before, this video came up on my recommendations. But why would someone with 1.6m subs just quit YouTube? Can anyone explain?
Bro let’s give a shout-out to freddy mercury for singing for anthpo
Don't cry because it is over Smile because it happened  Congratulations, Anthony!
dream
thank you anthpo for this.
I just know this man’s videos will be the kind to randomly pop up in people’s recommendeds for decades to come.
he died 💔
Toodle-oo!
Ive always had a hard time saying goodbye, and this is probably the most bittersweet goodbye ive ever had to be apart of. Anthpo i just want to say thank you for making this channel in the first place, ive been watching for years and it almost feels as if i was apart of the ride itself. Time is like a rollercoaster, some parts go slow and others fly by, but in the end they all have to stop somewhere. Thank you anthpo for giving me a release from everything and instead enjoy your experiences through these videos. Im a Senior in high school next year and its now hitting me that im going to be in college sometime next year. Nothing ever stays the same, so thank you for letting me enjoy this
why do i always get recomeded goodbye videos
Bye 😭
See ya.
:(. this makes me kind of sad, but i'm happy for you. while i'm glad you had an awesome four years, i'm sure they won't remain the best--you're a really cool person, and even better times are ahead, i bet. i'm partially saying this because i also want to believe it. but also thank you :)
watching this as a high school graduate (as of 3 hours ago!) really makes me excited to go off to college and the world beyond. watching you do crazy shit in your videos has really helped me get further out of my shell and have more fun with my life. thank you, mr. anthony po.
👋🏻 Goodbye Have a nice life
who did he fall in love with?
I've never heard of you before but I'm still tearing up. That's art right there.
Thank You Anthpo for Everything you have done, Congrats in Graduating, And Stay strong, Anthony.  Its been a Fun Ride...🫰
This is worse than Unus Annus...
im crying
o7
I don’t even know what to say. There has never been anyone like you on YouTube. I have enjoyed watching your videos for the past 4 years and I’m sure me and many others will always remember you and this channel fondly. Thank you.
Damn it hasn't felt like that long since your first few vids
so why exactly are you quitting (if you're quitting?) because you graduated? idk I feel like this leaves so much loose ends idk what he is trying to say, but I don't watch this guy so maybe i'm lacking context
great video to watch on the toilet thanks
this channel will always be such a comfort for me. thank you for everything anthony <3
Thank you Anthony
CONGRATS ON GRADUATING ANTHONY!!!!! im gonna miss your channel and seeing new videos from you but im so happy that you made it. this was a fun and wild ride. happy trails anthpo!!!!
I'd be lying if I said I saw everything you did for the past 4 years and such, but i remember your videos being great comfort vids for when im not in the greatest mood I hope they will stay out there, cuz I know I will soon it lower lows, and I need someone to make me remember that life can have higher highs. Have a good one, Ben Tennissen.
Hiiii

Thank you Anthony. Congratulations and goodbye.
Goodbye in 64 days goodbye in 23 days goodbye in 1 day goodbye
'Now it's time to go live yours' thanks I'm keeling myself
We don't know you lil bro💀  Jokes aside I'm not some extreme long term viewer but I've been watching for around 6 months, I found you thru the big fishing vid and was surprised when I saw another one of your videos in my recommended and saw that you were the same person that made that video too! I rlly loved this vid and it sucks to see you go but I'm glad you finally graduated
this actually feels so great, I'm so happy for you all! It's been a hell of a ride for us, audience as well c:
Nah cuz ima fuckin cry
Man… I’m gonna miss this channel…
Dear Anthony and Co, Thanks for making me laugh on the bad days and smile when I didn't feel like it. You guys are amazing and thank you <3
Be seeing you king
good luck in all of your future missions, we all mean this when you will be gone but not forgotten and i know that my comment will be another in this sea but, thank you, for all that you have done. p.s. you have done more than you think for us.
I dont think I'm ready to say goodbye but I guess I have to  I must say it's been some of the funniest 3 years I've had on this platform. I picked up this channel at the start of the pandemic and have stayed since. Thank you (and your amazing friends) for taking us all on this ride of yours. I hope you've had as much fun making these videos as we have had watching them. I wish you the best in the future to come. It's been real, Anthony. Stay you dog 💪
I cried man-
godspeed soldier!
I'll miss you
This is my my third video watching this guy and now I feel sad
That’s fine. Content hasn’t been great since high school anyway.
Why’s he quitting?
Good luck!
Buh bye
Thank you for everything ❤
You'll always be the perry the platapus who harrasses people with a photo of yoshi who done crazy stunts and presented how the backyardigans is communiest propaganda to around 1.65 million people on the internet guy. Thanks for the great content.
We will miss you, cya when i rewatch, hopefully living my life
ty!! i have been here since your high school videos :] such a great experience getting to see you grow and experiment through your teenage years!!!
I know it's a goodbye and that's sad, but actually this vid managed to make me feel a little better. I felt anxious lately because of a lot of changes in my life and I needed a reminder that sometimes things just end and that's okay. It's okay to let go. anyway, goodbye <3
A farewell to one of the greatest youtubers i have ever watched , it was an honour being able to watch this channel and i wish you well anthpo..!
Thank you for everything you’ve given us. I hope that one day you will return to us maybe, but until then. Goodbye! Thanks for everything👏🩷
ANTHPO NOOOO 😢 WHY LEAVING?!   my tissues are finished man so dont leave

Bro I just got here 😭
Congrats on graduation, Anthony :) We'll miss you, but I know you have a bright future ahead of you. I hope you know how much joy this channel has brought me and millions of others!
see ya
Heyo Anthony, Anthony here. It's an honor to see your college journey come to an end. I really don't wanna say goodbye but, guess I do. You've motivated me to have actual fun in school as well, and gave me a couple ideas of things that I can do to mess around with here. It's amazing to see how you inspired all of us for these past 4 years. Your channel just proofs how much fun you can have with friends in college... Congratulations on graduating and I wish you the best of luck with the future.
you've got me on the verge of tears but thank you so much for what you have done to make my life better.
👋
:)
It’s already here
Good bye 😢  We will miss you guys!   :)  👋
Dude another vtuber reaching graduation... gl man
first of all- congratulations on graduating anthpo!!! Your content always brought a smile to my face.  I had seen your videos pop up around YouTube over the past few years, but only this past Winter did I start actually watching your channel. All of your videos highlighting the funniest moments with your friends, giving advice, playing games, and even just living mundane day to day life- it all inspired me to go make my life just as great! Even though I'm not one of your oldest fans, I truly appreciate everything you've put into this channel. I'm really sad to see it go, but you ended it on the perfect note. It's just as you said- It's time for you to go on living your life, and time for us to go on living ours. I know your channel will always be one I can come back to when I'm feeling sad, or just want a laugh. Thank you so much Anthony. For everything. The internet, as crazy as it is- wouldn't have been the same without you. Neither would the world, honestly! I hope that whatever life you go on to live is a good one. Thank you Anthpo. <3
Thanks man, it's been the wildest 4 years of your channel, I may be lost in life but I hope I can reach your happiness and positivity in life hopefully...
damn this is actually so sad, i’m gonna miss the funny moments with anthony harassing people and doing stupid things
I remember watching these 2 years ago then finding you again a year ago Anyways goodbye it’s been an amazing time
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
He'll be back
Thank you so much <3 i found your channel close to the beginning and i found it hilarious with all the random stuff you did: becoming ben 10, buying all the cookies, fat yoshi pictures. It was all such a wild ride and i was so happy i could watch :))
PLEASE BE JOKING 😭
Discovered this channel this morning, binged a few videos, and then ~t h i s~ pops up. I didn't go through with you on this journey at all, but I wish I did. Your stories are beautiful, sometimes batshit crazy, and kinda inspiring. I wish you and your peeps the best down the line even though its very unlikely you would somehow end up seeing this message out of the thousands that get shared by the hour. It feels kinda weird that I'm starting to follow your story literally right as you leave, but I guess that's poetic in its own way? Regardless, thanks :D
I wish u da best for your bright future rising gang 👍
I feel confused. Like I swear he just started college and now he’s graduating and now I’m starting college. And now I’m confused.
It feels like I just found this channel, and now I'm sad that it's over :(  We all appreciate you anthpo ❤️
He will always be my parry the platypus
I’m still waiting for the video titled sike
R.I.P. anthony, i cant believe you're dying tomorrow at 4:32PM EST at 40.636380202420426, -74.29211795507062 😭😭

Anthpo man you changed my life you inspired me to make as many memories with my friends, do embarrassing stuff, do as many good things for my friends. I mean I wore a Mickey Mouse onsie to school because of your perry the platypus stunt. So thank you if it weren’t for you I might’ve been a completely different person goodbye anthpo I’ll live the rest of my life in honor of the shit you did.

thank you for all the laughs anthony we are going to miss you, wishing only the best for you and your friends
Well godDAMN what a moving man, best to you good sir
Bittersweet. I shed a few tears watching this, only time I ever cried to a goodbye video was Unus Annus. Man I’m gonna miss Anthony’s uploads. Although they weren’t consistent, every video was a burst of dopamine. Thank you, Anthony Po for these 4 years of happiness. I wish you well in the future.
No....
stop rn.
I remember watching your videos when i started high school and thinking they were the funniest thing on earth. I havent watched every single video since but ive definitely been somewhat keeping up since then, and i’ve now i’m a sophomore in college myself! Thank you for the incredibly funny, impressive, and ambitious videos you’ve been making since the beginning. I am sure you’ll go on to do great things with not only your degree, but the experiences learned from your time here on YouTube! Goodbye and good luck!!!
Thanks for the time an effort you put into your videos to entertain us, loved your videos. I hope you do well and stay safe Anthpo
Goodluck for your future anthony <333
I'm starting my last semester of community college this Autumn, getting ready to transfer to a State College, and all of your videos have made me so excited for what's to come. Congrats man, hope things go well for you.
GOODBYEEE<3 AND GOOD LUCK IN ALL YOUR ENDEAVORS, THANKS FOR BEING SOMEONE I COULD GROW UP WITH
will he post again ?!
: (
What about OKPOP
thanks for the 2 years Anthony🥲
Selamat Anthony! Congratulations for completing college and thank you! For all the videos you and all your amazing friends have worked so hard to make, all the laughs that you've successfully ripped from us!   I was so lucky to have been here since I've found that yoshi video haha. It has been such a good three? Or was it four? years. Terima kasih, for all the good days that you've made. Your videos has been such a blessing to watch whenever I have a particularly bad day, especially during the long winded years of pandemic. I will definitely rewatch some of your videos, it's just really well made, both in intentions with the harmless fun and the editing and the scripts and everything!  Goodluck in all your future endeavors, and once again, salutations, thank you for everything! Goodbye! 💜💜💜
I never really watched any of your videos but you've been appearing in my reccomendations, But well... Goodbye, I havent even reached college but seeing the goodbye videos makes me feel... Weird, To see a stage of your life go with so many things of it and people left behind... Is something im not prepared to experience, Let alone letting go of anything, Which is something i am VERY not experienced in, Its not like i was ever that fortunate in life anyways, But yes, Best wishes to you and everyone involved, Good luck and... You'll need it.
you make me wanna go to college
It's been a wild ride - thanks for all the memories <3
Thank you Anthpo, for all the good laughs.
about time,
I think this channel emanates “Don’t be sad it’s over, be happy it happened”
Thank you Anthony. You’ve done well
Goodbye Anthpo. Thanks for all the fun and joy you've brought to us. Good luck on your adventure!
Bye Anthpo, good luck 👍
I've avoided these last few videos because I've been to sad to say goodbye, but now I know that was a mistakes. See ya.
Good presentation
One of the best youtubers on the platform, hope you are living the best life for you
thanks for the journey you brought us along, anthony o7
Congratulations on graduating!!!Thank you for being an inspiration, anthpo. These videos mean a lot to me, so comforting and heartwarming. I'm gonna really miss these updates but every once in a while when I come back here for support, I wanna remember my good times too. I watched your vids through hard times and happy times. These videos supported me so much and bought me comfort... So thank you for that. Thank you for sharing this with us. Finding your channel while it was still active was probably one of the best things to happen to me by far. I hope you continue to prosper in whatever you do in the future. I just want you to know that you have made a huge emotional impact on the lives of so many people, and your videos will stay in our hearts for a long time. So, once again, thank you for this channel. Thank you to all the people involved in this channel. Rock on you guys!!!!
damn, and just like that no more perry the platypus busting it down sexual styled (goated with the sauce.) a cheerful ending for a bittersweet taste
Unus Annus all over again 😞
Its really sad because this channel was one of the only channels I could actually relate to and enjoy watching, but i still wish the crew a good life

Memento mori the reminder of death and the importance of life, goodbye
Pekpek
I didn't want this video to end
It's funny to say that this is the first time, I write a comment on YouTube because I really have the need to state this somehow.  I mean I don't have to repeat what's already told in the comments so I just want to say: I never felt this way before it's like I (or I might as well say we) experienced a great loss and great gift at the same time.   thank you anthpo thank you for everything you made us learn and experience
i don't wanna say goodbye because this one means forever
i actually can’t believe it’s over  i’m glad i was one of the lucky ones who was able to experience this channel from pretty much the very beginning when anthony was in high school.  i hate to see it end but i love that i was here to see it in the first place. anthony has many times made my and probably many others days with his videos the uplifting and exciting energy always made me smile when i was having a rough day. thank you Anthpo, we all wish you a happy future. goodbye
This is so sad, but yet we're also happy for you. Congratulations anthony
FUCK FUCK ALREADY??? man good luck in the next steps of your life man 💛
It feels like Unus Annus all over again, but this time im not sad. im just happy that it happened. best of luck man ❤

Thank god.
congratulations on graduating!! i hope you are content with everything you have experienced!! see you later :)
ive never been so upset yet so happy for someone at the same time. i still remember the countdowns in your videos saying things like "487 days till graduation" and i never thought anything of it because it felt so far away. I can't believe that days finally arrived, but watching this channel has made me realise how much everyone has grown up. im gonna miss you and all the others, thank you for all the laughs, love you all so much <3
I remember the fat Yoshi vid and me absolutely loving it It's gonna be hard without Anthpo, but it was  good while it lasted

From watching you harass people as perry the platypus to watching you harass people as other characters, you were/are one of my favorite channels. It’s always sad knowing when something is ending. But it’s nice to know I can always look back on ur videos for a laugh. I put off watching this video for a couple days because I knew it would hurt my soul but that’s okay. You lived laughed and slayed. Thank you for sharing your life with us Anthony! You brought so much joy to so many people and I’m sure you’ll continue lighting up other peoples days. We salute you <3

Goodbye to someone who makes millions of people feel safe, to a man who feels like a friend to all who watched we wish you well King.
Wait, who are you?
it was really cool to see all the time and effort you put in to make cool/funny stuff, not just for content but genuinely creating good memories for the people around you. as someone who really enjoys making videos and spending time with people, i felt like i was watching someone that's similar to me, and it helped me realize that it's possible to make some of the dreams i have in my head a reality. watching your channel is/was really inspiring and entertaining and i'm glad i was able to witness part of your journey over the past couple years. good luck with the next chapter of your life!
watched ur channel sense u were in high school. gonna miss this:) congrats dude, you r  truly amazing <3
Anthony my first video i saw from you was the every episode of avatar last airbender and i loved it so when i rediscovered you a few months ago i realized that, that was you and its honestly so sad that i wasent here for the whole journey but honestly youve made me laugh cry and even do both at the same time so thank you for being a true inspiration to me

I'm genuinely so grateful for this channel because it has inspired me to do more with the people in my life, and appreciate the little moments even more. As someone who's going off to college this fall, this goodbye really hits hard for me, and I'm motivated to make the most out of it. Thank you for everything, Anthony, I'll be back to rewatch these videos time and time again. 💜
I’ve been crying watching these last few videos. This is the group you strive for. Y’all have made me laugh so much, and Anthpo, you’ll always be my favorite person and YouTuber ❤
your videos with your friends have always been awesome to watch, best of luck to all of you :)
Goodbye anthpo
Leaving YouTube and going to onlyfans
I’m so glad I got to live in the timeline where you were still posting videos. I love you, Anthony, and I hope the rest of your life continues to be as or even more amazing than all of these memories combined. I really enjoy your personality, your editing, and the comforting feeling all of your videos gave me. Goodbye, Anthony. :)
I first found your channel when you uploaded the Fat Yoshi video on YouTube and YouTube randomly putting your super embarrassing videos on my recommended.  However, I am honestly glad YouTube helped me find your channel and I am glad I was able to belong to this community until the very end. Thank you Anthonty, I hope that the brightest future is waiting for you.
You kind of look like Logan Paul.
WE LOVE YOU ANTTT
I have one word. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
Hope they do a reunion one day ...... one day
I remember when it was just the start of 2017 and I came across your perry the platypus video. It’s genuinely crazy how fast 6 years have passed. I guess it really just shows to appreciate something while you still have it 😢
Gonna miss you man, stay safe.
Goodbye Tony P :(
even if I've never seen you before me and I'm sure the rest of us are proud of ya man
Goodbye, I'll Miss Ya.
As someone who was here since the yoshi video im so happy for you :) thank you for bringing me laughs for the last couple of years :D

Your channel is literally such a big inspiration to me I love your heart of gold and your just so kind to others and a really fun person. I really wish you the best after graduation and hope life brings you so much joy
ive checked on it every day thinking he will just pop back up. Nope still isnt there. I feel like this is a perfect conclusion to this channel though. With the simple goodbye just showing his best memories, ill miss you forever. When the time capsule happens ill be into college... time flies
Anthony it’s been 2 days and I miss you 😭
I remember when I felt down I watched your videos to cheer myself up. Soon I'll be at college too, and one thing I've learned from you is that I should enjoy my time with my friends.  I'm sad it has to end, but hey, it's like they say, sometimes you have to let go. We are happy for you Anthony and thanks for everything!!! <3
we'll miss you Anthony 💙💙💙
Anthpo you have so much joy into this world thank you
Bro i literally just started to visit this channel and didn't expect a goodbye
Aw geez, i knew this day would come but I never really expected it at the same time y'know? It's sad but, it's so happy at the same time. Good for you anthpo, live your best life! :)
i'm a couple days late because i was putting off watching this video. i've watched every anthpo video probably since fat yoshi or actually even longer i think. i'm really going to miss this channel but more importantly i'm so happy that anthony did this and i'm so proud of him for how far he's come. similarly i'm also starting a new chapter of my life soon and this is really an inspiration... you taught me so many things about friendship which i really value as a lonely person myself. i'll miss you and i hope the both of us can have a fun time in our next separate experiences :)
Feels like I was still in kingsway like a couple months ago and now I’m a junior in uni bruh 💀💀💀
goodbye anthony, your videos were amazing
Thank you so much for making my days better with your videos! You have helped me through so much and made me forget about my problems! I am so proud of you making it this far and I can’t express my gratitude because there’s to much! This is such a bittersweet moment, and I’m not ready to see you go just yet, but congratulations and i wish you the best of luck in your journey through life ❤
Goodbye Anthpo, you were truly one of the best. Thanks
Leaving my mark as wellllll love ya anthony and friends :) you guys never failed to make me smile
soooo you're not gonna post anymore? :(
Been here since “harassing people with fat yosi “ so sad to see u go but happy for this new step in your life

Mullet man
Goodbye I don't know you u popped up on my YouTube but bye

I feel very sadddddddd
When you find an awesome channel to follow just when it has ended. I hope you don't delete your channel but keep it as a place to safe keep all the memorable times you had in college. The best of hope and blessing to your future.
if you really love something  youre willing to let it go
thank you anthpo for everything you were all ways there for me when my parents werent its sad to see you go.....yeah
it’s been 2 days and i’m still cying
Noooo don’t go!
This kinda gives me depression. Glad for you though, congrats 🎉.
It’s so strange to think it’s over
Didn’t even watch your content. However I will also say goodbye my friend. See you on the flip side.
WE LOVE YOU ANTHONY!!!!! LIVE A GOOD LIFE YOU DESERVE THE WORLD
Bye bye
Congrats on graduation🎉🎉🎉🎉
I’m graduating high school next year and to be honest, I’m scared. I’ve been in the education system for as long as I can remember and post secondary education just seems so different from the regular grade format. The elementary school and high school I go to are very interconnected, pretty much everyone I knew from my elementary school goes to my high school, but I know that college or university or whatever won’t be like that. Post secondary always seems to be where people split apart. I’ve been nervous to move on from the system I’m familiar with, but when I see people like you, there’s just a feeling within me that tells me it’s going to be okay. Hell, I wasn’t even sure that I wanted to pursue post secondary education until you came along. You’ve inspired me, along with so many others to live our lives to the fullest, find value in everything, do things for the sake of doing them. So, thanks for that  I don’t know what you’re going to do now, I’m not even sure if you know what you’re going to do, but I want you to know that whatever you do, it’s going to be great. I know it doesn’t mean a lot when a high schooler tells you that you’re going to do great things, but I’d be a fool not to say it. You and your friends are special, Anthony, you guys have made me cry, you’ve made me smile, you’ve made me laugh, you’ve made me feel all sorts of things, that’s not something anyone can do. Whatever you do next, whether we’re there to watch you do it or not, you’re gonna do something incredible, good luck. See you in 10 years for that Time Capsule, unless you don’t publicize it, in which case I’ll see you in hell <3
Lmao kiss her
Good luck Anthony, on your new chapter of your life
why would you leave a channel with 1.6 million subscribers? i know you're making a lot of money from this. dumbass
came here for the lobster, stayed for the playtpus. thank you anthpo
This video makes me want to go to college. Good luck on whatever ventures you may journey to, but we’ll never forget you. :)
congrats, man. we'll miss you
Man got Logan Paul in the thumbnail
Thank you too.
The past four years have been inspirational I hope my college years will be as awesome as yalls.
Wait- WHO WAS THAT THAT HE KISSED?
❤
The only word to describe this is “Legendary”
PEACE, PAUL
Good bye, hope ur future turn out amazing!
I’m gonna miss this
2:10 wrong emote
who are you and why are you on my homepage
Live you life anth, have fun!
Janice and anthpo ship is official????
thanks for all the fun and laughs farewell
wow. thats all I can say
So Many memories
Ayo never heard of you and 1:18 hits and I’m in tears… no way. You are special my dude. I wish you the best on your journey man!!
I've just been trying to comprehend how fast time went by. Lol anyway, it's the end and the journey felt short though it's been years. it was nice while it lasted
day three of missing anthpo ( will stop at day 7)
omg i just discovered your channel yesterday and subscribed dang
Good bye I'll miss you
I’ve said this before but seeing you and your friends grow up with me has been one of the greatest experiences I’ve had on this website. Of course it’s never been a real connection but I’m sure others will agree that it felt like we were all there for the fun. I understand how stressful being a content creator can get especially while you’re still young so I’m glad you took the chance to try it out while you did, we’ll all miss you but good luck moving forward and happy graduation. ❤
Nooo  Best of lyci
Wow just wow I can’t believe it’s really come to an end I mean it just doesn’t even feel real it feels like in the coming weeks I’ll see a new video appear with you and everyone else doing goofy things together with a deep message about life but I know that’s not the case it won’t happen the anthpo cinematic universe ends here and honestly I can’t think of a better way to close it I’ve been watching your journey from start to finish and well as they saying goes all good things must come to an end thank you for helping me through dark times Anthony I hope the best for all of you we love you and will miss you this is the end of our journey with you but not your journey and while we may not be able to see it I know you’ll go far much love
Wish you the best in the future! ❤
In Fat Yoshi We Remember
Good riddance.
goodbye, anthony.  have a great time, man!  youre funny as shit and i know youre going far, cuz your attitude is just... i dunno, great!  the same year you graduated from college, ill be graduating from high school.  GO WHITE BOY, GO!
This hits harder knowing that I graduate high school in quite litterally 12 days
This channel looks like a bunch of skits, I don't get how this is " highlights of your life ".   Idk why this is even on my recommended feed or why I clicked it. Happy graduation n that man. Idk.
been here since fat yoshi, in love with the content ever since. good luck in life :)
RIP you will be missed 😢 kind soul
IM CRYING NOOOOO
I only watched you once in a while, but every time I did I loved every second of it. Goodbye Anthony.
Been keeping up with your channel since you were in highschool, this is insane. Good luck man
here since fat yoshi ima miss you
WAIT HUH I LITERALLY JS STARTED WATCHING U NOO
Putting my flag down, i don't really comment much but this channel has seriously made my 4 past years, I'm still so amazed at how he could just come up with the best ideas with his friends, true friendship for everyone in this group, seriously, but stay safe antpho, cheering for u!
im honored to have gone on this journey with you, all the way from the beginning till now. you've been such a massive inspiration for the way I approach my life, and I've felt myself grow and change along with you.  i'll miss this so, so much. have the most wonderful life, and thank you for everything <3
Everything nice comes to an end, but it doesn't mean it's gonna be the best part of your life. Thank you for letting us be a part of your story, congratulations, and thanks for showing me hope. You have a bright future ahead of you!
thanks, man
this not the end right? 😢 right??? tell me he gonna come back and say that this is all a prank that hes planning for years
Good bye
You never quit YouTube. You just take a long break.
It’s a damn shame I only very recently started watching, I wish you the best of luck out in the world
bye
almost cried while watching this, which is saying quite a bit since I very rarely cry. anthpo defined most of my childhood, and honestly, whilst I'm sad to see him go, I'm happy he was a life ahead. I'm honestly so inspired by him, and I hope to bring chaos everywhere I go just like him. we <3 you anthpo!!!!!! enjoy your life!!!!!!!  Edit: for everyone being weird about me saying my childhood: I'm 14, and my parents did NOT do a good job of raising me.
thank you so much for your videos. The saddest thing for me is, that we will never see the 4th part of Attack on Titan from you QQ
thank you
About 4 years ago. I found a bizzare youtube channel about perry the platypus onsies, beyblade battles and fat yoshi. Almost 4 years later I'm still watching the same channel. Even though the channel is dead I will continue watching your videos until youtube probably shuts down or I die. And words cannot express how much I will miss this channel once I finish watching every video. Thank you for entertaining us for the last 5 years.
Thank you for sharing a part of your life Anthony !!!
I love you anthony you certain help build a apart of my childhood that I'll always come to love ❤ Thank you always for all those good times you shared. 😊
im not saying anything emotional, but thanks for everything
it was an honor being here thank you
I thought you will do aot s4
Thank you this made me cry but have a nice life bud
i still remember your hs graduation how are you graduating college already 😭😭
sad to see you go but im happy your leaving high and proud. love you and i hope you live a good and love filled life.
Cheers and to the future :)
Im not crying. You are.🥲😢😭
I just discovered your videos this morning, I cant wait to go backwards through the journey and experience what you've experienced. Thank you in advance!
I was here since day 1, thank you for everything, being with you on your journey was an amazing experience, even if this’ll be the definitive last video at the very least we’ll get to look back at every video and every step of the way. Happy graduation anthony :)
I´ll miss you Anthony! Have fun in your new adventures <3
Goodbye ant. This is a moment to be remembered as you were one of the greatest creators of our time. I hope you enjoy life
Been watching since the Fat Yoshi video. It's been real Anthony and thank you for all the videos!! <3
🫶 🫶
🎉
I’ve been following you since your high school videos and it’s been an honor to have been with you on this journey. Goodbye Ant hope you’ll be happy and remember the videos you’ve shared with us with a smile on your face, because you’ve brought smiles to so many other’s people’s faces, mine as well. Love you so much, take care of yourself. ❤
A legend   A jokester  And a fucking king.  You were really funny  Sad to see you go.
its gonna be hard but thank you for everything
Who are you
It's been a wild ride, From your beginnings to your ends, you have not only affected me but thousands upon thousands of people online. Whether it was from making parodies based on popular ip's, attending korean contests, or even taking long walkes on the beach, you always did something new and fresh and it was a pleasure to see them all.   Growing up along side you has felt like like a journey in itself. In some of my darkest moments these videos would always leave a smile on my face and felt just like hanging out with an old friend.   Even through they say all good things come to an end, I'm glad to have been there for the finale. Now I'm not really the best at saying goodbyes but thank you anthony and have a good life. You deserve it.
goodbye, anthony :D hopefully your future is epic !!
We need more more more more more MORE!!!
I loved all your videos
Anthpo i hope that you and all of your friends have a amazing life.and best of lucks🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Man I'm gonna miss this channel. Have a good life big man
The end of an era
Alright guys we can unsubscribe now
Anthony, thanks for the videos man you was the one YouTuber that made me smile or laugh as soon as your or your friends popped up on the screen. What a journey but thats what life is isnt it. I love your videos bro, pursue your dreams and finally,  peace. 👋
dam bruh never watched this dude
This is wild…
:( <3
You're very inspiring, I hope you continue a well and happy life as all who have watched you grow and flourish throughout your youtube journey. Goodbye, Anthony!
Bye bye
Whilst you have provided brilliant entertainment to all of us, I hope you can use your channel to look back on the memories and people you've met over the years and that it will make you smile over how much you've achieved and how much you will achieve. I hope the years to come treat you well and that this next chapter brings you so much happiness. Thanks for everything mate and congrats on graduating!
I stated watching you when a Perry the platypus video of a high schooler came into my recommended and ever since then you’ve had me hooked and I’ve been watching you over the last 4 years and it has been a blast and while I’m sad you’re leaving I’m just happy I found your channel, Thanks Anthony for always brightening my day :)
1:04 yah, umm this is the first  video of yours I’m watching
what about okpop
Thank you so much for 2 years of some of the most "made me smile" content I've been able to watch. Goodbyes are always hard but even though we never met you, we got to know you through your videos and I will miss you, enjoy your life and experience it as well as you can, and thank you for the content ❤
2:45 thank you so much, I really needed to hear that. Love you anthpo ✌
..
i still remember the first time i found ur vids. never expected you to blow up like this
this is the exact defintion of bittersweet, i'vr been following him for a while and it's helped me with my own fear of getting older and moving forward in life, im getting so choked up watching this
I'm going to miss this.
Wait wait was Anthony dating Paige !!!!!!
Goodbye man, I loved your haikyuu volleyball videos
a few tears slipped, i won't lie. thank you, anthony, and goodbye!
I unfortunately haven't had much time to watch the channel and I regret that, goodbye Anthony. Good luck in life.
Here before 100,000, this has truly been a journey. Thank you for all the good times.
It's been a hell of a ride and I am glad I was on it 'till the end.  Thanks Anthony for the great time. <3
Boy I just got here WHAT THE FUCKKKK
Have a great rest of your life man
damn bro i cant... i watched this video after Guardians of the Galaxy.
Thank you so much Anthony, for everything.
Thank u <3
I have to poop.
It was nice knowing you Anthpo, goodbye
dude am so happy i found your content, its been very entertaining few years of my life whenever a video of yours pop up. Wish you luck on ur next road in life!
damn... so when you do a fortnite video?
i wish you the best of luck anthpo :}
I wish that one day I will be able to live as fully as you seem to have done ! Congrats on what you have accomplished and good luck for the next one !
Dude I’m only 13 I can’t take this emotional baggage
Just wanted to say well shit never been so sad but happy for someone in my life been watching since before college and now im not gonna be able to open up youtube and see your vid and be like wtf 😂. Love you antypoo
Been here since your high school days and it’s been a blast watching you grow. Good on you for retiring from Youtube at your peak and I wish you all the best in what comes next in life!
Let’s make his legacy live on.
This was posted the day before I started my gcses I started watching you during covid and i really feel like I’ve grown up with you, thank you anthpo for being an inspirational part of my life ❤️
I'm emotional but nothing is forever. We have to appreciate what we have and strive to help others.
Holy shit I can't believe it's over. You had an insanely good run man, and you knew when to end things on a high note. I hope whatever you do next you excel at just like you did here.
no one cares
I've watched this about 10 times since this came out. And, even though everyone is saying this, I feel like I can't leave without writing a comment. i started watching anthpo about a year and a half ago. This channel has gotten me through some really rough and difficult times, so thank you. This also made me realize, I don't have much time left in school. "Now it's time to go live yours." Had me in tears the first time I watched this. I didn't realise this is supposed to be the time of my life- so I have to make the most of it. Thank you Anthony :)
Cant believe Anthony is passing away, this is so sad     (Me when i spread misinformation on the internet)
AAA JUST FOUND YOU TODAY AND THIS STILL HURTS
i haven't been on this channel for long, but I'm going to miss you guys a lot. I hope your friends and you have a great life after graduation anthony <3 I wasn't ready to say goodbye but every great thing has to come to an end eventually and I totally understand your decision. take care!
i’ve only been here for around 3 weeks and i wish i was here for longer, glad i was here for the end though, knowing that everything must end is both sad and beautiful at once
someone tell me who he is and why hes leaving
Congrats!
Im scared. Thankyou. Goodbye Anthpo.👋🏻
It's too early... I'm not ready yet...
i understand why you want to leave but i am begging the life out of you to remake the legend of korra like you did with last airbender
Goodbye
Have fun :D
you were amazing
It’s been fun to watch your content, and I pray the best for you in whatever you do ✝️❤️😄👍
Will miss you man
thank you
Ok bye
<3
I am absolutely crying right now. Cant believe two years passed by so fast.
I’m honestly not ready to say goodbye, but these have been the best past 2 years. Thank you Anthony.
There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation 'Til school comes along just to end it So the annual problem for our generation Is finding a good way to spend it.  And that you did. It's been real, man.
Wishing you the best of luck for all your future career endeavors!
</3
Goodbye.
I remember watching your Perry the platypus video for the first time and i couldn’t help but stop watching your channel ever since, I hope where ever life leads you I hope it good. Thank you :)
Goodbye 😢
crazy how i started watching with the fat yoshi video and now it’s over 😭 best of luck on your future endeavors!
what is the music 0:45
<3 Such a nice video  I have been here since the fat yoshi vodeos  ❤🎉🎉❤
Thank you for everything anthpo ^^ you do not know how much your videos touched many people.
say goodbye
Glad to have been here.
O7
WHAT
Why   you  go
Man this hit me and probs others hard but goodbye
Ok so I'm new here but idk why I don't want him to leave 🤣😭
I have always watched your videos since the Kermit video, yet I never subscribed lol.
I don’t know what to say but I can say thank for all the laughs and memories you have gave me and everyone else that has watch you
This showed up on the trending page, can anyone explain what's going on? So he decided to delete his YouTube/stop posting when he graduated....?
good luck for whatever's about to come anthony
love you and will miss you always man. to a new era!
❤❤
Se ya man ! Excelsior!
Ez ok goodbye too
I don't think most of us (including me) are ready to say goodbye to this channel. I've been watching since you did the stupid stuff in high school, and I have loved *EVERY* upload Anthony has posted. You've been one of the biggest inspirations in my life, making me want to work on a YouTube channel, and just to have fun with the people I appreciate in life. Thank you so much Anthony for just uploading, and I hope that you're successful in whatever endeavors you take on now.
Here since Fat yoshi
Thank you for everything Anthony ❤
When you eventually propose, I hope you make a big production out of it if you have the means. Although I feel it’d be insensitive to monetize a moment like that on YouTube so idk man.
sooooo……no more Tony P?
Nice knowing you and your friends, Anthony.  Im also graduating soon from my college in a few weeks. Even though it may not have been as eventful and fun as yours, I'm glad that i get to see you enjoy your college life and I'm glad get to expierience it together through your videos, it was fun and really made my colourless day better, even if it's just a little.  Anyway, best of luck to you on your journey as an graduated. I also have mine journey to go through too. I will try to live my best life starts from now and i hope you do too.  Kind regards, Random Thai College student.
Truly an amazing finale to such a YouTube channel of all time  We love you Mr Pofessor  I mean... You knew that already
:((
Thank you 4 all the years entertaining me from the early pandemic until now anthony, as you began ur channel in highschool, now i must sadly say goodbye to u during my last few months as first year in highschool, hope to see you soon in the future
I’m holding back tears right now, this channel saved my life as a lonely middle schooler and inspired me to find real friends and connections who would make me as happy as you all seemed in your videos, since then I’ve only gotten happier and happier and started moving on from this channel to experience that joy myself instead of living vicarious through these videos, and now you’re all moving on and finding your own happiness outside of YouTube and I couldn’t be happier for you, it’s been a great 4 years, I hope you all had as much fun as I did.
We Cherish Memories Cause We Lost Them And Will Never Feel The Exact Moment Not Like You Won't Get Any Other Best Day Of Your Life But That Very Specific Moment Will Never Arrive And That Is Some What Haunting But Beautiful
I've been watching your vids since the yoshi printing one. It's amazing and bittersweet to have come this far. Wishing you the best.
hold on- I just found you 😭😭
Soooo.... I got recommended this and I've never watched any of his old videos 💀
Damm watched ever since your first video and I love how your content change encompasses life experience for gen z and what it’s like to navigate life and growing up. There was a period were I had a bit of distaste for your content as I felt it glamorised college friendships but I love how in these closing videos you have really outlined the reality of it all it’s really moving and also encouraging. Your videos have really inspired me to go out of my way for my friends more and make some lifelong memories in collage whilst I am still here. Sure moment’s won’t be YouTube worthy but it’s the people that matter not the events. So again thanks for everything! Good luck with your adult life!
so he IS dating Janice?!!!!!! 😍
I’ve really enjoyed your content the last couple years I’ve been watching, hope the rest of your life is amazing
Byebye Anthpo, youll be missed<3
As someone who's also graduating with you, this made me so incredibly emotional
I havent been a fan for very long but im so sad thats its over i hope😢 youre living your best life as a college grad🎉
saying goodbye is so hard
Thank you for the past 4 years. I remember clicking on your yoshi video, laughing my balls off and, since then, I haven’t stopped following your absurdity. Thank you for making my days better, my smiles wider, and laughs louder. Its the wrenching feeling that eats me knowing this all ends here but, sometimes, you  gotta close a door to open a window. Thank you anthony
Goodbyee anthpo
been here since fat Yoshi this is so sad we'll miss you sm
Who cares? I don't even know who you are.
Crazy how I wanted to go to Rutgers
Enjoy the rest of ur life ❤
I discovered Anthony's channel start of pandemic, im grateful. Its lot of fun as im a college student too i can relate somehow, im just ahead by a year and graduated last year, i wished my journey is just like Anthpo's but it is not. Im glad that i witnessed their friendship. Have a great life dudes and dudettes.
Thank you for everything. Have a good one!
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, WE LOVE YOU AND WISH YOU THE BEST! ALSO WE WILL BE HERE FOR YOUR BIG COMEBACK ON 23 JULY 2025

Well now I’m sad. But hey, at least I enjoyed the journey.
I’m waiting for the reunion in like 3-4 years
o7
I’ve only just found you but I have to say what a wild ride you must’ve had, congratulations man! Good luck in whatever comes next.

o7
We salute you my friend. College ain't easy but the fact you had so much fun with your friends, graduated, and made this incredible channel means that anything truly is possible. It's sad to see you go but something tells me you're gonna do great in life hell you already are. Thanks for the the laughs and for 4 incredible years brother 🎉
If anthpo goes to graduate school would that mean he runs this channel back?
Sad to see you go, but thank you for the last four years.
Please stay
:( welp
I literally just found this channel yesterday 😭
ive never heard of this guy before, why he leaving
It's surreal that it's finally over. Glad to have seen it since the Perry the Platypus school invasion :) You've inspired me to have more fun while I'm at school. Thanks Anthony
Ive been watching since the Fat Yoshi video and have never not laughed at a single Anthpo video since. There's so many real and raw moments you've captured with you and you friends throughout all these years and its a privilege and honor to have been able to experience it all through your videos with you and the rest of the community from the beginning. You've given me so much inspiration from start to the very end and I'll continue to hold on to this inspiration to keep going and move on to do the things I want to do in life, I'll always come back to these videos whenever I need that push or boost during my lows because they always seem to help lift me up and remind me to live in the moment. I love you and the rest of the crew, thank you for this experience❤️
GG well played
I just started watching you so this is sad
:(
anthpo's life montage really hits hard
Awh, good luck and goodbye anthpo <3
Thank you Anthony for bringing joy to me and many others for these past few years. We will truly miss your inspiration and energy. However, we all hope the next step in your life is just as amazing.
wow thats sad... Really sad
no :<
Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened. Enjoy the rest of life's ups and downs Anthony. Congratulations, this channel has been a surreal experience.
damn. started watching since the video of playing volley tournaments in haikyuu uniforms and here we are.
GG

Dam bro i started watching when i was in elementary school, now im going into high school. Thank you for all the memories Anthony
Thanks Anthony, for these 4 years of laughs, thank you. Now go live the life you deserve to live.

Will be missed greatly, thanks for the laughs
Sup remember me ill miss you bud

Pleasure meeting you and your gang.  i wish you Good Health, Happiness and of course prosperity.. Congratulations

I'm gonna cry 😓 BYE
I think me and many others aren’t ready for your departure but it’s been an honour watching your content for the past 4 years. I started watching from the Perry video and ever since I’ve stuck around and am extremely grateful I did
The fact that Im just starting college this year 😢idk menn aaa i wanna create my own content to u inspire me sksks See u Anthony
goodbye favorite youtuber
I knew it was going to end… but why so soon?
Thanks Anthony, I know your chanel since the video of the fat yoshy, and stil I can't belive this has ended :')
For this one i didn't watch "BIG BOOTY LATINAS TWERKING COMPILATION" Instead, goodbye ant.
I will definitely miss seeing all the fun and great YT videos that has come into my feed every time you upload, but everything must go on and I am grateful for everything that you have done with this channel and the happiness that you' brought us with your friends. Congrats on graduating 🎉

This is the best goodbye video I have ever seen😭😭😭 Thank you so mush for being such an inspiration, I'll miss you!!❤❤❤❤

I just finish my final presentation and left a month before my showcase, but I felt mixed emotions of sadness and happiness until watching this video made me felt reassured with the memories I made in my degree and the future I'm heading to. So glad to see how far we have come,  so goodbye and thank you for the memories :3
gg
Been a wild ride these 4 years and it's hard to say bye but damn thanks for the content and the content you've given us Don't know what else to say i'm in shock that we've reached this point
wait so he'll stop making videos?
4 years fly by so quickly, thank you and congratulations Anthpo! Thank you for this amazing journey, it's a bittersweet feeling and although I'm not ready to say goodbye, I wish you sucess in your life and future. It was fun while it lasted <3
i’m very happy 4 u and thank you so much for everything
don’t cry because it’s over smile because it happened
hey i’ve been watching you since 2 minutes ago when i saw this video on my recommendations and i’m gonna miss all the times i thought what is this channel who is this guy and wow he has lots of subscribers.  Anyway good luck!
Thank you. You are amazing and all your friends too. Thank you for sharing, we all hope everything works out for you! Congratulations on graduating Sr. Anthony!🎉
bye loml
Aaaaaaaahhhh
We love you. Go live you're life. Goodbye and Congratulations  ❤🎉
Ant was an inspiration for me during my college years to truly make the best of every day. He inspired me to come out of my shell and have fun outside of my comfort zone. Honestly, I don't think any other youtuber has left an impact on me like he did. Wish you the best Anthony, and thank you.
Man just decides to just quit youtube and what i can assume is a channel that makes a good chunk of money to go out into the real world where the money he made on youtube will never ever be met with money gained from a "real" job
You can't leave us without one last "Every episode of" video...
:,)
Incredible, thank you for the joy you shared
Have a bright future goodbye
I can't really say a lot but I did came in a few times and I always laugh and have a smile on my face when leaving so thanks for that man and take care
Thank you
all these years.
Your content fr gave me so much happiness, when i get older ill make my life like yours hopefully, thank you for everything <3
Now its time for Anthpo shippuden
Why'd he quit?
I just wanted to say thank you. I've been keeping up with you for fucking forever.  I graduated high school last Friday. I'm happy to say that i've made so many friends and have had so many good experiences because your videos inspired me to do so. For once in my life I got off my ass and put myself out there. I aspire to bring happiness into the lives of the people who surround me, just as you do.  Your content brought not only me, but so many other people joy. I look forward to college now because of you, and Im excited to see where I fit in and who I become through the next four years of my life.  Anthony, you are truly a wonderful person. Your personality shines through your content, and we, your viewers, can all truly see how amazing you really are. Not only your content, but YOU are a blessing. Im sad to see you go, but thank you for all that you've done and all of the smiles you've given me on some of my worst days. Wishing you the best on your future endeavors, Ant. We love you.
napoleon...  and als the boy in the trailer in canada who survived and did not die... please try to become man. loose the diamonds, please?
So he’ll be gone?
Anthony, thank you for all the laughs I've had since 2019. each video I've watched and smiled and laughed at. thank you for being a somewhat comfort to my life for these few years you've been posting. seriously i cant imagine that the guy I've watched in 2019 wearing a Perry the platypus costume or handing out Yoshi papers to people in his high school and shoving a page of one in a soda vending machine would spiral into so many great memories and excitement of when you would post more. truly you've inspired not only me but all of us to go out and live our lives to the very best extent. its going to be sad seeing this last YouTube video age with the coming days, months, and then years. but ill always have these few funny memories of what you posted. ill miss you Anthony or to be said, anthpo. you're amazing and ill know you'll accomplish amazing things in this life. thank you once again, for the videos I first saw of you, the videos of thnaf on tiktok in the 2020 pandemic which always made me laugh and was truly happy when you guys posted, to now these last videos of 2023 and this, this last video I'd imagine to be the last video forever. youre amazing, have a blessed life. much love ❤, -Tobi
No way bro, This was way to god, I dont want yall to go diff ways, yall where to good. Pls do content outside college, Just atleast once
*Goodbye Perry The Platypus 😢*
I was there, and now I'm here forever.
must be nice to look back on all these memories after a few years
I guess it’s time to start from the beginning
Unbelievable..😢😢😢
Aw man
Lowkey sad going to miss you ant and everyone, but i hope you guys have a wonderful rest of your life. Keep having fun.
Dude, you are definition of the youth. How it should look like. Thank you...! ❤🎉
bye :(
Bye anthpo, we'll miss you
Gonna miss you man! Good luck out there!
I remember finding your channel when it was in its humble beginnings with Fat Yoshi and Ben Ten at your high school. I was already finished with high school but watching your videos back then made me feel as if I was part of that fun even though my high school experiences were the opposite. Your videos since then have brought me so much joy. Thank you for sharing your humor and journey with us. I wish you all the best in your next endeavors though you will be greatly missed :')
Gratulations! I gave up school and now i try to become a youtuber :D
First time crying at an anthpo video. We’re all gonna miss you
I don’t know how but I just discovered your channel a few weeks before this last video! From that highlight reel alone I think I’m gonna go back and start from the start! Best of luck! :)
watching this while on the final day of high school hits different
Adios dude.  Thanks for the memories. You given me alot to remember and enjoy the things from my past and present.   Goodbye and take care.
ending this channel with queen is the best thing you’ve ever done i love you
Thanks Anthpo, for helping us through the quarantine and life in general, I hope you get to live a beautiful life and I hope everything goes good for you, again thanks for all the laughs and I will never forget you  o7
Here’s to hoping this is one of those goodbyes that lasts for a little while before a dank reboot of the ACU
i feel like i’ve lived all those memories all those experiences with you and the others, nobody is ready to say goodbye but we’ll all miss you we love you anthony❤️🫶🏼
I discovered this channel about 2 years ago, so I was always nearing the end, I always knew this was gonna happen.  Anthony, thank you for the content and laughs that you gave us; unlike a lot of content creators who just ended their channels abruptly I already knew that this one was going to end sooner or later and it's still sad to see it go despite knowing ahead of time. We will never forget you.  Edit: No wait, we still have one video left; the time capsule in 10 years.
We knew it was coming, but none of us were ready to say goodbye. enjoy your life Anthony, you deserve it after spending 4 years making a random 1.65 million strangers on the internet smile. And I hope everyone lives their lives well.  "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people's thinking." -Steve Jobs
NO
Gonna miss your videos, they always made me smile no matter how i felt before hand, i wish you well in the next chapters of your life
Your videos are truly the best man
Anthpo more like anth-poop               Anyway i love ya vid
I'm not ready to say goodbye.
Can't believe it's actually over. It's hard to say goodbye but as you say all good things must come to an end. Good luck on wherever you're going Anthony. Thanks for everything.
It's sad to say goodbye but there's always a new beginning after the end so I hope you enjoy it ❤️
i really wish you could stay but it's alr. ur the best anthony :)
I wished this day never came yet I’m still happy for you.congrats hope you have the best life possible I suppose all good things truly do come to an end yet that end shall be a new beginning
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I LOVE U PAPA ANTHPO TAKE ME WITH U
I kinda hate myself not knowing you sooner. Thank you Anthony, goodbye.
Thank you so much Anthony. I can't convey in words how happy you've made me and so many other people throughout the past 4 years. I know it doesn't mean much from a random guy on the internet, but I truly hope you have a great future, one filled equally with the happiness you've given us. Goodbye Anthony, and thank you again.
Damn. I wasn't a really big fan, only seeing some of your videos, like some of the "every episode of"s, the haikyuu volleyball tournament, the irl Squid Game, the Asian beauty pageant, your episodes with 1MTS, etc. But I can really feel the love through the screen, and it'll be sad to see you go. Wishing you a great future wherever you're going. :)
I still can't believe that you're leaving now. But honestly now I do have an understanding as to why you are leaving, so the least that i can do is thank you for making such amazing content all this time. I started watched a few of your vids in 2018 but did way more and continued ever since 2020. Who ever knew time could fly this fast. I am so happy that you and your friends got to go through this journey together. your power of friendship has always found a way to heal my heart so i wish nothing but the best for every single one of you guys. if okpop somehow gets even more fan than I out of many are considered "real ones" for supporting an enjoying since day 1. But regardless, even though this video made me cry the first 3 times (watched it when it was posted 20-30 mins ago) watching everything all at once just amazes me  I wish you nothing but the greatest journey of your life, we will all forever love you so much. You've made changes in our lives, so make the best change for yourself. 💗
God im so jealous. My college years haven't been anything like this. What do I do.
I’ll miss the beyblade battles, yoshi and perry the platypus. I’ll miss you Anthony. Thanks for being my favorite YouTuber for the past 4 years
Thank you so much Anthony for everything. I'm going to miss you and all of your friends, but I'll never forgot the amazing journy I had watching you guys, live, laugh and have fun. Congrats on graduating, and I wish you luck for the next stage in your life. Goodbye Anthpo. Love you ❤
This is so crazy and sad at the same time :( I graduate high school next friday and I'm going to a completely new state for college and i hope i can find friends like this and do fun little things like this. i wanna live my life to the fullest and just have the best 4 years ever like anthpo
Wishing you the best and further happiness in your pursuits and endeavors!
An era has ended
Legitimate goosebumps
See you later alligator
All the best in the next chapter of your life.  First found you from the perry videos and then when you did the chopper meme printouts.
Smell ya later, anthpoop
I don’t know why but i just feel like someone really important to me just left, it’s somber. Nevertheless i’m happy for Anthony and i hope he finds happiness in his new chapter of life. We will miss you
It's not ok to not be ok.
I'm getting that unus anus heartbreak all over again but for anthpo
I may have only started watching a year but I have loved every video thank you
imy
Anthony started college the same year i started high school, and its been an absolute delight watching him throughout the years, I've seen myself change and develop as a person, and now, graduating high school, that last bit hit hard, as if he was passing the torch. The year his college journey ends is the year mine begins, and if there's anything I've learned from him, its to make the most of it, because the years will fly by.  Thank you Anthpo, from the bottom of my heart. Here's to a bright future, for all of us.
I’m going to miss the videos you made it always made
I was here since the start and this hurts
I really cannot express how proud I am. Although, we’ll all miss you, it doesn’t feel like the end of an era and the start of a new one. It feels more like loosing a friend. Thank you Anthony, it’s been quite a ride and it’s an absolute honor to get to experience it with you!!
Damn, not to be parasocial, but I’ve literally watched Anthony grow as a person and YouTuber for the past 4 years. I find it crazy when I started watching him also as a high schooler and now as a university student.   I want to imitate the fun he has, and the group of friends he has. I really am distraught at you quitting. Imo, there’s no channel or YouTuber that has come close to what he has done due to the niche nature of the college setting, it’s only four years, but you grow so much. I’ll be waiting for what you have in store later, but I’m hoping you can really live your life without needing to worry about YouTube.
Thank you for everything Anthony, your videos have helped me a lot throughout these years. Still remember the first one I saw, and how that Yoshi video inspired me to copy you and doing it at my high school, which even helped me to do more little fun things during my last years of school. Thank you for this journey, wish you the best.
hate to see you leaving but i understand why and truly wish you the best <3 thank you for sharing these past 4 years with us :)
I used to watch your channel all the time when those parody vids of tv shows and movies were coming out. After that, I watched a few funny college things and then I kinda stopped. It just wasn’t interesting for me at the time, cuz I was still in high school and all I cared about was goofy avatar parody. However, these past few months, I came back to this channel, and seeing how much you’ve grown since the old days was incredible. These final videos especially made me kinda regret not watching the rest of them. But, I’m in college now and I don’t really think I need to, because as you said, it’s time for me to live my own story. Your future is extremely bright, and I wish you the best of luck in whatever you do next. OKPop👌 indeed
Bye baby boi 👋🏻 thanks for making me laugh sense high school.
It's been a long journey since the first video that I watched (I think it was the Yoshi one or one of the Perry ones) but it has been one of the best contents in this plataform. I want to thank you for those awesome videos. Thank you, and good bye. (Sorry if my english is bad, that's because I'm brazillian)
This is bye for anthpo, but not for Tony P 👊
Love you anthpo

Goodbye and have a nice day
Ah fuck I told myself I wouldn't cry. We'll miss you, and we love you! Thank you for all the laughs you've brought us <3
I think I speak for everyone when I say that I'm gonna miss his goofy ahh
It's hard to think that this is goodbye. Thank you for sharing your life with us, Anthony!
it’s kinda crazy to see that it’s all over now. watching your videos give me a hope that i’ll be able to live and experience the things i wanted that i thought i didn’t have anymore and i’ve honestly learned and grown a lot from you. thank you for so much, from the fat yoshi video to the end. i know you’ll do well wherever you go and i wish you luck, goodbye anthony :)
“Falling in love”   *show Janice*   *me slapping my knee*   FUCKING CALLED IT
Number 15 of trending is crazy
Thank you for the stories shared, thank you, and best of luck.
Please don't sto0 making videos
Bye Anthony I have to go to school but I love u too bye :)
bruh i jus saw a kid passing out fat yoshi pictures and now bro is graduated
Thanks for letting us come on this journey with you, I know whatever you do off YouTube will be just as great even if it’s not the same. I’m soon off the college and this channel has shown me that I can make the most out of it. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed watching your videos these past few years and wish you the best  goodbye!
Thank you for the impact you have made on my life. Hope you can find what you are looking for.
will he delete his videos? i am honestly not ready for that 😭
been here since the fat yoshi vids ✌️   thanks anthony
WHAT THE FUCK I CANT BELIEVE IT WENT BY SO FAST 😭😭  IMA MISS UR CHANNEL BRO CAUSE UR CONTENT WAS SO FUNNY, I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST EVEN BEYOND COLLEGE ❤️❤️
Goodbye Anthony, lysm <3
Legitimately teared up at this one, such a good reminder to love every moment. Thank you Anthpo
Thanks for everything
Bye. Good luck!
i’ve been here since the high school vids and it’s so so sad, yet so exciting to see you go. good luck on life Anthony:) you’ve truly inspired me so much to live my life to the fullest
Be happy that it happened and sad that it ended
Anthony, we appreciate everything you have done. I was very very fortunate to have had been able to enjoy your content and to think that it was just pure chance that I was able to stumble upon this channel. It's nothing short of astonishing what you've accomplished and we hope that you live a joyous life and achieve whatever else want to do in life. Bye, Anthpo
Cheese was here, and is crying 😭
I just realized this but I started watching these videos when they came out and Anthpo was still in high school at like 17 and I've watched him to this day and now I'm his age when he started making videos and it is just really bizzare
Anthony thank you for all you have done for us, it’s sad but we have to move on I hope the new chapter in your life or whatever you are doing next treats you well, farewell AnthPo.
denial isn't setting in yet but congrats on starting a new chapter and making my life so much better with your videos and giving me a genuine laugh.fingers crossed you start taking content on another channel maybe:) really gonna miss you and your friends energy.
What no 😭 I didn’t know he was gonna quit I just joined the community
You've ended a chapter of your life, the next one will be greater than the one before. Just wish I could be in your next chapter.
Hey, don’t know who you are but got recommended this. Have to say, I noticed the Omori icon on your previous video. Good taste my man
thank you for all the laughs, you did amazing things :)
I didn't think i would cry. I am cry
no
thank you so much for your channel. i've been watching you since your highschool days and stuck with you until now. sending love.
youve graduated at the same time as me... wild that he's my age...
Thank you for everything Anthpo we all will miss u 😢
o7
its too soon doint leave 😢
Let me start off by saying that , Anthony , You have done something truly incredible with your channel and life . i remember being sad with my own life , but by watching your videos gave me strength to be strong and Empathetic like you ! Thank you so much for the last few years , from your highschool to college, it's been wild but a happy, joyous ride ! I have also started with my college this year , and you have shown me how to be better , Kind , Humane and most importantly a Funny Guy :) Bye Anthpo , I wish you nothing but the Best for your future endeavours and I'll genuinely miss you and the friends. Excelsior!
Say sike right now *sniffs* please...
I remember when the high school grad  video came out. Congrats.
I can’t believe I missed this lol.
Never cried so much. He went from harrassing people with fat yoshi, to slaying dragons, and now, he’s grown up. THNAF got me through some tough times, and I have never laughed so hard as when I watched the play video. I hope he goes onto doing great things, and if he returned to the channel a few years from now, that’d be amazing
Goodbye man great memories watching you
I hate youthbe for showing me new youtube channels WHEN THEY ARE DEPARTING FROM YOUTUBE 🤡. But you look like a fun guy, and I hope you enjoyed youtube to the best of your ability.
I’ll miss you :( I remember cracking up at you harassing people with images of fat yoshi
WAIT ITS BEEN 2 YEARRSSSS 🧍🏾‍♀️🧍🏾‍♀️🧍🏾‍♀️I’m not ready
First time seeing this guy.  Random click.  So...he started this channel on entering college.  Now, he's graduated and is shutting it down.  Have I understood the situation here?  Interesting idea.
goodbye
honestly, it only felt like yesterday when you announced that after college, you’d stop posting,, i remember thinking “that’s a long time from now, no need to worry.” i also remember getting worried after every video, seeing that countdown even if i knew that time was nowhere near “near”. now, that time finally came. thank you for all your videos and all the laughs. as someone who’s been here, watching ur videos since forever, im glad i was able to find you. you and your friends made my days go by so much quicker, especially in the pandemic. all the parodies, costumes, games, moments really inspire me to make the most of my childhood too, to just be myself, doing whatever i want to and having fun. i especially loved that tiktok arc of your life. you also introduced me to so many funny content creators, really just bringing happiness and inspiration in my dull life where i dont really have people to spend time with me like this. thank you so much for these many many years! we really can’t thank you enough!!1!1!
Goodbye Anthpo! may you have a great rest of your life and enjoy every moment, thank you so much for all the laughs and the wonderful videos you have made for us, it's sad to see you go but i'm glad and I think everyone else is that you have done all you have for us and show us the wonderful aspects and highlights of your life! may you enjoy every other moment <3
Damm
this is it then, goodbye anthony. thanks for every laugh i had and we'll miss you so much ❤
Whatever you left us, we go with you
👨👉👍
Its been a great journey. I'm glad this was all able to happen and we got to live through your story with you. I hope that the rest of your life will go well, and we all will miss you.
I've been following your YouTube journey since the harassing people with fat Yoshi video and have stuck with you this entire journey. I've watched every single video and seen you grow from a high school kid messing around and doing fun stuff that I would've never thought to have done to the wonderous and talented person you are today. You're YouTube journey may have ended here but I know that you are going to rock this world with whatever's in store in the future. As someone who personally gathered a bunch of like minded individuals that has blossomed into wonderful friendships that'll last an eternity, I appreciate how much you've impacted so many others probably as much as they've impacted you! I wish you the world Anthony, and once again, Thank You, for bringing me so much joy these past few years. You've got the makings of greatness in you, and you're gonna rock the stars Anthpo!
Congrats dude
Didn’t ask.
Thank you for the good times and congratulations on graduating 🎉
Thank you
Goodbye Anthony, It's been an amazing time watching and enjoying your vidoes!
i have no idea who you are ngl
thank you so so so so so much for your videos!!!!!!!!! im so grateful that i got to be here to see your youtube journey happen :) best of luck to you in the future!
Ive watched this video 5 times already im really not ready to say goodbye but this is just such a powerful goodbye
tf, this guy is a random
I don't usually comment, but I wanted to say something here. Thank you all for helping me get through the past little while. No sappy quotes from me (because I wouldn't know how to put whatever this is into words haha) but I genuinely appreciate everything you've done and while it's bittersweet, I wish you the best with whatever comes next for you. ❤ We'll miss you!
this is the worst day ever
Goodbye,  and I do hope you will return someday
I always thought of making somebody to love by Queen a vidoe like how he did it’s cool
My two greatest inspirations on youtube, ChubbyEmu and this guy, they both made it a personal journey for me made me grow and make me feel human. (Some of you who know Chubbyemu and are saying what? well watch his older content and the transition between his content was probably most inspiring thing I’ve come to live by in my life)
YouTube hey here’s a guy who you’ve never heard of and it looks like he’s done with YouTube ok now we are gonna recommend you his videos.
Goodbye
Bye again Steve 😢
This is so sad oh my
what a ride
Congrats! Thanks for sharing your journey!
Miss you already man. Thanks for all your hard work at making people laugh and smile. Just bringing joy to the people around you directly and then kindly sharing that joy with hundreds of thousands of others. I know I'll find myself revisiting this channel time and time again, whenever I'm feeling nostalgic, whenever I'm feeling down and just wanna chill and watch something delightful and goofy and motivating. Thanks for all the hours of editing and filming we never saw, for making crazy plans and following through with them, for being the best goddamn example of committing to the bit anyone could ask for, all while literally going through college lol. You made it. You did it. We love you dude. Congrats<3
I have cried two times in my life…  When my parents told me that I was adopted…  And when I watched this video knowing it was Anthpo’s last video.  Anthony, if you are reading this, thank you for all of the memories and afternoons I spent watching your videos.   Good Luck, and enjoy life. You deserve it.
THANK YOU, ANTHPO, FOR NOT DELETING THIS CHANNEL. THAT IS ALL I WAS SCARED OF, BECAUSE THIS LOG OF YOU IS SO ENTERTAINING, AND I CAN’T WAIT TO WATCH IT ALL OVER AGAIN. (I don’t know why I wrote this in all caps.)
I can belive, I reached here, I'm watching this video, you are now a work guy now, I am not sad because it's over, I'm happy that your existed, and your videos, and all of your channel, thanks and congratulations Anthpo.
i guess ill be in mourning for a couple minutes now, bye 😭
You and your friends have created some amazing memories and were kind enough to share them with all of us. While it's sad to see the people we have enjoyed watching for so long go, everything has its time, and the time you, and everyone involved, have spent putting into this channel will always show that no one is perfect and that it's ok to embrace each other's differences. The memories, experiences, and friendships you make along the way are what matters the most to learn and grow. You guys will surely be missed but never forgotten. Congratulations for the Graduation!!
Thank you for being an inspiration and an amazing person. Wishing you all the best on your future journeys, through the highs and low.  o7
Later king o7
Guys (press de traduz button) não fiquem triste porque acabou, fiquem felizes porque aconteceu.
I cant believe this day would come. I don't know what ill do without your you and the gang now, I haven't cried this much in a while and its crazy how one youtuber can impact so many people lives. I really hope you post updates on your life on social media, your videos were the most entertaining and you were my favorite youtuber. Live your life man, me and everyone else will hopefully see you again. <3
Goodbye Anthpo, we’re gonna miss you. Thank you for all the fun times you gave us. I wish you luck for your future. I’ll always remember you.
Good bye Anthony, been here from the yoshi days and i basically grew up with ya best of luck to your future
Anthony you've been a way to forget everything around me and have a really good time as if I were  experiencing this myself, you´ve been a part of my life i won't ever forget, it's crazy how fast time passes but it really feels as an eternity(in a good way), seeing the content you make has brought many so much joy and I hope it did to you too. I know you will be great in anything you plan to do ,so thank you.
Even if this is the last video you will make and the last day of your college experience but in our hearts you will forever be the loved and crazy and funny teenager that never grows up
thank you for everything.
thank you for entertaining us these past years, and congrats on graduating, u made it through school so good job, thank u for everything m8, have a good life :-]
Thank you Anthpo, for all the adventures, for all the videos, for all the feelings and all of the things you did in those 4 years. Im gratefull to say that you changed my life for better in many ways. Some years ago I wouldn't even though of being the person that I am now, that talks to a lot of people, that tries to do coll stuff and mainly try then, even if im afraid of, all of that being inspired on you all of the time. So thank you for being who you are and helping me in though times and making me a better person, hope you the best Anthony, lov u man. <3
Bye
how quirky
Thank you for the memories anthpo we will miss you
Sobbing because anthpo made me seek a new way of looking at life and I feel it completely changed me for the better, thank you anthpo for everything. All your videos made me laugh but by the end of some I was crying because you truly knew how to appreciate life and the people around you ❤
3:14 is the actual time of the video
I'm Glad I could be here while you went through your school years. It was awesome and Funny lmao. Especially the parry the platypus thing. With that being said. I wish you luck in your future endeavors and i hope you have a nice Life. Catch ya when i catch ya
im half a month and a semester (hopefully) away from graduating highschool. then ill be in college (maybe). watching anthony's videos and watching the final goodbye, made me realize, that i might not have the best college years. but, ill come back in a couple years when i graduate college and respond to this, whether or not i had a good time or a bad time. so, future me, how was it?
adios 👋
Dang....It's been a ride, it sucks It's ending but I'd rather that than be in a timeline where this channel didn't exist at all. Thank you for the laughs
All good things come to an end😪😪
Wish you the best future and brightest future ever <3
So bittersweet to watch, I’ve loved this channel for a couple years now and I hate to see you go but I’m so happy for you. I graduate Highschool extremely soon so it’s kind of a cool coincidence. Good luck!
cool okpop finale
Anthony! I will start this by saying that I haven’t been a devout fan nor have I watched you since the beginning, but I would always click your videos whenever they showed up on my recommended and you definitely deserved my sub. I’m glad to at least have joined in on the ride, and it’s crazy to think that we’re almost the same age but you’ve done so much more to create an impact on the world than 90% of us already. I aspire to also finish off my last year of college off well before getting into our respective careers. Take it easy man, you have touched the hearts of millions of people! Good luck on your future!
OMG THIS IS MY FIRST VIDEO OF THIS GUY! WHAT DID I JUST MISS OUT ON?
Graduating highschool in 6 days, your content has been such a big  motivation for me in the past 4 years for not only personal development, my social skills, and confidence to go out to talk to people and try new things. Watching yout videos inspired me so much throughout the hardest times in my school life, thank you for all the smiles and advice you have shared with all of us ❤️
thanks for being a part of my life
I WISH i could say i was a long time fan. All of the videos you post on here literally ALWAYS make me laugh and it feels so good to know that these are all like.. proper _memories_ someone else got to experience. Hey, now you can never say your college years were boring :)
hope to see you around in the future. May your channel rest in peace.
Good luck with your life forward you have helped me whole thick and think just watching your videos and the meaning full words at the end so thank you and goodbye.
miss ya man
The chonk Yoshi dude is gone :(

Ever since that fat yoshi video I've been immediatrely hooked on watching you Anthpo. You are genuinely the funniest Youtuber and your content is absolutely amazing. I hope you can find whatever your looking for, and I hope you can have fun with your friends without slaving away at your PC. See ya buddy.
thank you anthony <333 we all love you so much, good luck
Thank you for the memories. Keep on living.
we will miss you anthony :(
Thank you Anthony <3 You’ve definitely brought joy to a lot of people, and inspired me to step out of my own comfort zone while I’m in college. I wish you the best of luck in all your future endeavors, and thank you again for all that you’ve done
A time capsule of being young and dumb... youll have it forever. Thanks for the 4 years man :)
God dude am actually crying the high school videos were so awesome
Good bye jive turkey 🦃
❤
Winning
Bro's capping. There's probs gonna be a new upload tomorrow. No way hes fr about giving up that YouTube dough.
So the end  😐 goodbye for ever i guess
Ehhhh
Another amazing channel coming to an end 😢🎉 wish you goodbye anthpo
this channel was truly a saga. we’re the same age and I found your channel in high school. I was even a part of your discord server that you used to come on - remember that lol?? I wonder if any of the fans remember that server?? it really seems like a relic of time.  anyways, it was fascinating keeping up with a channel that mirrored my own life stages. I don’t think I’ll ever have an experience like that again. thanks anthony. I may have not had as fun of a time in college like you, but it was really nice to live vicariously through you lol.
From seeing you run around your high school dressed up as Perry the Platypus, to you, well, recreating every Phineas and Ferb Episode, and even more recently, sneak into a cult, its safe to say that you have accomplished what only few dream of, enjoying what you were doing. take care now, and please don't forget us
congrats dude! im happy i watched this proyect, good times, you deserve the best
I changed my major 2 years into college from Comp Sci to Animation since I love art and comp sci was too stressful for my mental health. My parents were very happy for me, even though we’re Asian or South Asian depending on where you’re from. So that really surprised me.  I recently started seeing every single one of my friends posting images and videos of their graduation and I felt really bad since I feel left behind. But it’s fine, I’m okay with it since I’m doing what I love and not something that was forced upon me.
I'm so incredibly sad this channel is over. The creativity that went into it was always entertaining. I know I'll be visiting in the future to reminisce.
I started watching your channel as an 8th grader, when you were a senior in high school. Now you've graduated college, and I'm going to be a college freshman! Your videos make me smile, and I admire that you were truly doing it for fun. I can't wait to take inspiration from you and do many wacky things with my friends in college. Thank you, Anthony 💞
who am I gonna watch now
Thank you :)
Just today I remembered you and looked you up only to find out that you’re leaving Thank you for all the videos you’ve made and for bringing joy to me and many other viewers through your videos! We will miss you!!!
Thank God! Goodbye I won't mind you 💋
Thank you man
Why are you having to leave us this was the first video I saw and I can’t see anymore of your videos first time I saw you I am not even subscribed😢😢😢😢😢😢
Ngl being younger then him and watching all his videos when he was first in that tik tok house shit with 8illy and watching him going to college makes me upset on how he’s saying goodbye but I would love to say I learned many things from anthony and like lessons from him.
crazy to think how i’ve watched anthpo since middle school and now im about to graduate high school. good times for sure, i really enjoyed your content anthpo! much love and i wish you all the best :)
i had to give myself a day before i could watch his last videos. thank you anthpo
I'm gonna miss your content a lot, congratulations, it's crazy to look back at my discovery of your channel 4 years ago and how far you've come since then, hope you enjoy YouTube retirement
I found this channel recently and became and it instant favorite for me...I wish I was here from the start. Wish you all the best! I will keep watching all the videos in your channel(still catching up)😊
Only watched a handful of videos and feel like his best friend. Hope he has a successful future waiting for him.
thank you for having existed in my life, your videos helped me a lot to create the courage to put myself out there and try new things. Good luck in your future and I wish you nothing but the best
I’m going to get lost in this out pouring of love for you, but that just means there’s a lot of love in these comments to get lost in. So really I don’t mind, you deserve it all. This is a fucking essay goddamn. I’ve been watching since my first or second year of high school and this is my last year. I’ve always been uncertain of the future, but this channel has been apart of seeing me through and has encouraged me to try new things outside of my comfort zone. I used to really struggle with anxiety and it used to stop me from going out and doing things that I wanted to. I couldn’t walk into a store without freaking out at one point, had trouble talking to others and admittedly I was super awkward. After finding this channel and seeing you do crazy shit, it encouraged me to go out and take the first steps I needed into the world. On a whim I signed up to an acting group outside of school and I was shitting my pants but I did it. And I never went back, but it proved to myself that I could do things outside my comfort zone. Since then I’ve done a lot of crazy shit, done a lot of public speaking, made a lot of good friends, had a lot of experiences and caused a lot of mischief. I would have never gotten the courage to do all these things if I hadn’t watched that first video. It was the push I needed to become who I am today, who I will be tomorrow and who I will be in a few years from now. Of coarse it’s bittersweet to see it end, but this decision reinforces the main message you’ve put out since day one. Live your life, try new things and live life to the fullest.   It couldn’t have ended any other way. You have grown up in front of us and we’ve grown up with you and we’re all so proud to have seen you achieve not only in the amazing experiences you’ve had with your friends but grow into a person that inspires, teaches and challenges every person that watches these videos to do better and live unapologetically. You’ve changed my life, and I would not be who I am today without fat yoshi harassing people or you buying every cookie on your last day of school. I’m still uncertain about the future, but it’s not scary to be uncertain anymore, it just means there’s opportunity to do more crazy shit and have a lot of fun. It’s been real, so proud of you man.
Bye
i know you since 2019, and watch all ur videos since, i cant believe it already passed 4 years... we will miss you
GOODBYE PERRY THE PLATYPUS
Goodbye
I found your channel when I was in middle school. I’m now graduating high school, and I didn’t do it a traditional way. My mental health kept getting in the way of how I really wanted things to go, but your videos always helped cheer me up. I didn’t go about high school the way I had thought or planned to, but thats okay.
Ur graduating the same time I’m graduating Highschool. I’m in an incredible music program full of incredible people. And I was scared to leave. But you make it seem okay
what a ride
Can I have you’re channel. I mean if you’re not using it. I could borrow it for a lil while
See you later Anthpo 😭😭😭
Thank you
Godspeed, Anthpo.
congratulations anthony! we love you and will miss you. your channel has been a rollercoaster, with both the good and the bad. but just know that we were with you and enjoyed it all. wish you the best! hope to see you again one day, whether it be in a different form or the same. <3
have a good life, wish you the best in whatever you decide to do 🎉 o7
Thank you Anthony, I wish you the best.
I WAS HERE TO WATCH THIS LEGEND FROM BEGINNING TO END!
🦗Now grasshopper the real adventure begins.🦗
Although I haven't been here for long  I got attached to your videos so thanks for making me laugh it was nice for awhile  Anthony
dang bro this really hits different when you're just about to go to college
goodbye
Even though the channel isn't being deleted, I'm getting the end of Unus Annus vibes from watching this video
I'm guessing we aren't going to get that Attack on Titan season 4. Ah, well, those 3 videos are so funny I can love off of them forever. Season 4 was really heavy and depressing so maybe it's for the best
Thank you Anthony for the Perry the Platypus running around the school meme! That will be your all time greatest video! Miss you already
Just graduated college yesterday too! Let me just say: your experience looks way more fun than mine ever was lol.  But no doubt about it, your vids helped me get through so much of it. You're hilarious, creative, and you let people know what's important: it's okay to not be okay. Thank you, Anthony! You have a great rest of your life :)
uhhhh this my first time watching you sooooo this is weird
Goodbye
I’ve been casually watching you for the past 2 years like I haven’t even seen that many videos but I’m so emotional rn 😭 this is so sad but so great BYE BYEEE
Who is this guy
it was like you were still in highschool yesterday
I can't say goodbye. Your vids have kept me going even at my lowest. I love all your work and I have nothing but respect for you Anthony. Take care buddy! :,)
ive been watching since 200 days ago. whenever i watched your videos, i feel like everything bad just disappears. you made me laugh so much, but also get a little worried watching your videos in public. ill miss you a lot, and whenever you need something, your fans will always (maybe) be here. have a good life, and thanks for making ours bright with every video you post
Who is this guy?

Bye
i loved ur vids man, i wanna make videos when im in college too now. what college did u go to btw it looks lit
I'm gonna miss this channel, and it sucks we never got to see "Every Episode of Attack on Titan Season 4", but this was a wild ride. As someone who's been here since the first Perry the Platypus video, watching you guys has been so fun, and I only hope my college experience is at least a little bit as fun as yours appeared to be. Goodbye!
Congratulations Anthony!! You’ve brought a smile to my face anytime I saw one of your videos, your personality and videos are amazing. You’ve inspired me to do reach out of my comfort zone and have fun. I couldn’t be more grateful. You have brought happiness to so many people and your content will continue to do that. We will miss you but you have a  bright future ahead of you. Make sure to make the best of life and stay true to yourself. Thank you so much and Good luck!!! <33
Congratulations Anthony for completing college!!! I can’t believe that it’s already been 4 years since I’ve found this channel and see some highlights of your high school and college experience! You’ve helped me through some though times but I do wish that the future has amazing things for you! Goodbye!!!
This is truly the end of an era. Thank you Anthony for everything. ♡
I’m not ready to say goodbye at all but these past 4 years have been an absolute honor to go through with you, you laughed, you cried, but all good things must come to an end, in the end you must go your own separate ways, I can’t thank you enough for all these amazing years, and i could not be any more proud of you and how far you’ve come, Thank you for everything Anthony ❤
day two of missing Anthpo
Thanks so much Anthony, for everything <3
Thank you. You’re awesome.
Does this mean we wont see Every episode of Attack On Titan Final Season 😢 sad times
Graduating in 3 weeks.  You let me expose my weird, my wacky and wonky throughout high school. you showed me that it's okay to not be okay and to be, being different is normal. I will absolutely miss your videos. but it is my time to live in the moment more, and to live. I love you. Thank you so so much.  ~NN.
Whyyyyy
please tell me I'm not the only one crying rn...honestly, Anthony was such an inspiration for me and I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was the same for others. I'm going to miss the videos he put so much effort, feeling, and passion into, and I'm going to miss the ACU just as much. I hope that one day I'll be able to touch people's hearts the same way this channel did. Thank you for everything, Anthony
cya
I'll miss you man
I hope you go so far Anthony 💓 we’re all beyond proud of you and thank you so much for such amazing content this past for years 💓💓💓💓
Imagine he’s just like “JUST KIDDING IM GETTING A PHD” and comes back for a few more years
im like actually sobbing rn anthony i've been watching ur videos since i was like 11 and now im almost 16 and the amount of inspiration and laughs you've given me is insane. im so glad to see u graduate and i hope u know how many ppl love ur videos
Thank you Anthony!
We’ll miss you! Have a great rest of your life :)
Goodbye anthpo, hope you have fun in whatever you do next in life
Bro I’m confused is he not going to post any more????????
watching this knowing that this is his last upload finally hit me that this era is over but im so glad he shared all those special moments with his favourite people with us. i can kind of understand what its like to be the one constantly recording your life, and although not the same as anthony, i understand why hes decided to say goodbye. ill be going off to uni out of town (possibly to america from canada) next year and initially i was scared because i didnt think id be able to make friends but i think thru watching his videos i understand that u can make friends no matter where u r. thanks for all of the amazing content uve given us and we'll miss u and continue to love u, ur friends and ur videos!
I watched your content since your high school moments man. Thanks for all the content and we all love ya!
The Yoshi man I'll always remember you😭
peace
Is this really the end? After everything he did on this channel it's just over?
Thank you for the great times, Anthony. Well done and good luck!
Fuckin love you Anthony
Thank god
Damn. Thank you, and good luck with your future endeavors.
Congratulations for graduation!!! You have been amazing
i just got here you cant leave
It’s so inspiring how as some guy I’ve been watching on YouTube for 5 years is leaving college and months later I will be starting my own college journey. Have a good one Anthpo
Dang it really hurts with the realization that this is it, and theirs no more new uploads of friends goofing off again. Nonetheless, thanks for the videos Anthony and have a good one.
Anthony's whole channel is proof that you can have fun with a bunch of friends without doing any harm. The past few years and memories have all just been exciting moments that could make you cry, laugh, or try something new. Whether you're stepping out of your comfort zone, or encouraging others to do so too. It just makes you realize how you shouldn't take everything so seriously all the time, and how much friendship can actually do for you. It's nice to know that we grew along with Anthony and even with his friends too. Just as a viewer, watching his videos can make you feel like you're there in the moment, as if you're a part of their friend group. And to those who ever feel jealous of what Anthony has, try something new. Anyone is capable of having something like this whether it is filmed on a camera or not. Life's too short and the destination gets close with each passing day. You've probably heard it about a million times in your lifetime, but do make the best of life.
I don't know how to feel, Anthony has been one of my favorite YouTubers for the better part of a year now. I'm glad he's going on to better things. But I'm just gonna miss the joy I get from seeing one of his videos. We love you Anthony and hope you go on to make many more people smile as you did the millions of people wacthing you 🙏🏾
could you explain more in fortnite terms
cya
i havent wateched the video yet but omg i remember yesterday i remembered about you making a video saying your leaving in like 400 days. i remember i used to watch you sm and i was just sitting there wondering if anthpo hwd left youtube already. i just wanted to make that but u were an inspiration and i hope u have a good life😊
goodbye anthpo. we will miss you very much. i can't even believe that it's over. goodbye.
i feel like technoblade just died a second time but this time its anthpo. live your life to the fullest, bro.
Thank you for the past few years. You're one of the most real youtubers out there, and watching your videos truthfully made me green with envy. You made me question what I'm doing with my own time, because I can see you living life to the fullest. Watching you with your friends just having a good time reminded me of early 2000s Youtube and that I need to go outside and touch some grass, because there's always so much to do. You clearly value your relationships and are an overall kind person, and I think you got to experience things only one in a million people would get to experience. Thank you for being a positive influence and reminding us to make the most of our time. I wish you the best of luck moving to greater heights and making improvements to the lives of people in the real world!
bye lol
Rip bro
Ummm well it’s been good I don’t know what to say and I hope that your life is going to be good even if it might be hard and I hope you never forget this community who will never forget you 😢
Finishing my a levels at the exact same time, and its honestly really healing to watch someone say goodbye to a part of their life, while appreciating what they did, rather than focusing on the negatives. So thank you anthpo, for the amazing content over the years and for making me cry.
I have barely missed a video since first watching you when you originally released your big yoshi video, this has become a big part of my life, so it’s sad to see it go. I hope everything goes well in the future. I will really miss this channel. It’s helped me get through some darker times, helped bring a smile to my face.  Thank you, Anthpo.
I LOVE ANTHPO I LOVE ANTHPO I LOVE ANTHPO I LOVE ANTHPO I LOVE ANTHPO I LOVE ANTHPO I LOVE ANTHPO I LOVE ANTHPO I LOVE ANTHPO I LOVE ANTHPO I LOVE ANTHPO I LOVE ANTHPO
this felt so quick 😢
Thank you for all these years of joy , keep being yourself 🔥 Congrats for the graduate.😎 Farewell old friend🥺🫡
I can’t believe this, congratulations thank you for entertaining us 😕
Tony P would be so proud
1:16 HOLMDEL TWILIGHT MEETSSSSS
Thank you Anthony for all you have given us with these video’s with the memories we’ve had just watching you and the memories you’ve made along the way with your friends and family and everyone else in your life its fine to struggle in life bc it just part of being human is with enjoying moments you can’t explain with some moments that you can’t even have the urge to say but the point is you’ve made so many people be happy in your own creative way with your friends that shows that we don’t have to grow up to find  Enjoyment in things but to be Happy within ourselves and finding the right people out there. -❤🫶🏻Love Izzy  POWER OF FRIENDSHIP IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER💥🫶🏻
👏🌝👏
This video made me cry, thank you for all your great videos, and congratulations on graduating college.

My friend and I have been watching your channel for a year and your videos are always something that we look forward to. You’ve made so many good videos over the years, and as sad as we are see you go we wish you the best in whatever you want to do.            Also who gets custody of paul we are very willing to adopt
Adiòs.

Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
As someone who was there since fat yoshi... Thank you and please stop making me cry over someone dressed as a platypus leaving school.
I haven’t been following this channel for very long, I’ve not experienced a majority of your videos, but the ones I have have been so fun and joy filled. I’m glad I could experience it.   Safe journeys.
Slayy Anthony, going out wit a bang bigger than JFK
Ngl doing youtube atleast for me sounds like one of the best jobs so why quit it? Just replace college with other
WAY TO GO ANTHONY! GOOD LUCK IN YOUR FUTURE ENDEAVORS!
Thank you so much Anthony for the amazing adventures you've had. I cannot express the smile you put on my face when I watch your videos and I'm crying because I'm going to miss you so much. We love you, stay safe, and be amazing like you've always been. <3
o7
i'm gonna miss you so much omg your videos were always something that made me smile even during hard times and it's gonna be weird to not see you post them anymore... I wish you the best !
Ggs Anthony Po 🫡
My last day of school is tomorrow and tbh I didn't want to get out of bed this morning because I was trying to procrastinate time itself because I don't want to say goodbye to my friends. This video is really, really helping me get a grasp on everything I'm experiencing by reminding me that I'll have the memories I made for a while, even if I don't see my friends regularly anymore. Thank you, Anthpo. I don't think you know how much this is helping me.
Hey Anthony! Thank you so much for all you've given us when you weren't obligated to. I'm an 11th grade student in Canada about to enter college next year and you've made it less scary and more exciting for me. I've been watching you ever since the begging, being the fat yoshi video, thank you again for everything you've done
Noooo dont go, dont leave me alone
Love your videos ❤❤❤
Thank you Anthony for an amazing 4 years
Best wishes !
"If you ever feel like stopping never give up push to the end" Thank you Anthpo for making my life for what it is today I or we will remember you forever as the years go by.
Goodbye anthpo, been watching you since the perry the platypus vid, hope you are achieve all your goals🎉😢
rip bozo
Thanks for everything goodbye anthpo.
kinda sad right now
It's sad but, it was great. All that starts will eventually end, I'll miss you certainly, keep doing good in life Anthpo
It’s safe to say we’re all going to miss you and your videos that helped make so many happy and brighten people’s days with laughter. I’m not ready to say goodbye but these past couple years have been amazing, thank you Anthony.
Anthpo, I started high school  5 years ago, and now my first exam is tomorrow morning,I would just like to thank you for entertaining me for all those years and I hope you return someday in another form.

Bye :)
gone but not forgotten, we will always remember him as the perry the platypus guy
the final part hit so hard for me. Thank you for sharing your wonderful adventures with your friends anthpo, and thanks for motivation to live my own life to the fullest ❤
mannn
I cant beleive it's been so long. Im currently watching this after just having my last day of school before heading to uni in September. It was a bittersweet day and it made me realise the amount of time I spent stressing and thinking of the future rather than living in the moment. I think watching your videos the last few years and then seeing this goodbye has really hit me in that when I go to uni I need to live in the present and make the most of my time before heading to 'the real world'. Thank you so much Anthony and all the people in the ACU, its been amazing and I wish you all the best post-graduation :)
Thank you, for everything.
If you told me back then that one day I'll be sobbing uncontrollably because of the "fat Yoshi kid" I wouldn't have believed you, but here we are. Thank you Anthony for all the laughs and unexpected life lessons trough the years. Sad to see you leaving but you deserve to go out and find your own happiness and feel fulfilled. Love you man
We're going to miss you Anthpo, but go and live the great life you and your friends deserve Thanks for all you have given us ❤
i miss it already man
Thank you for sharing these chapters of your life with us! Your channel has been a major source of positivity and inspiration to me - you’ve captured so many special moments and memories on film. It’s a joy to see how far you’ve come, all that you’ve done, and the people you’ve met and impacted coming together to celebrate!   Go enjoy your post-grad adventures Anthony - with the power of friendship! 😁🥳
Good luck and goodbye my friend best of life to u, u deserve it!!
wait is this dude one of those weird white guys that only likes Asian girls?
He graduated college, and I’m about to graduate high school, and I’m going to college. I’ll miss this channel so much
God damn it man, your making me cry rn
Literally found your channel today… already sobbing having watched this video and read all the comments of people you’ve brought happiness too through your existence.  Glad there are people out there like you and your awesome crew, and happy you get to forever say this was a part of your life at some point. Wish you, and all the people you love, the absolute best this world has to offer.
Goodbye man
First video I've ever watched from this channel🥲
Thank you for your entertaining content Anthony. Wish you the best in life. Love, Afternoon.
Legend.
Thank you for all the fun and happiness, you make my high school life more fun and exciting you showed me how to live my life to the fullest  I'm going to college soon and really nevious but your videos teach me how to stay positive and having fun and understand that something things just need to change  Good bye. Thank you for the past 4 years of fun and happiness
The end of an era.
Im gonna fucking miss you man
i dont really know what to write but as much as im am crying right now i am so happy to see you complete this one hell of a journey with so much you & your incredible friends managed to achieve and make out of your time toghether, all these weird but meaningful things you showed & tought us really serve as an isnpiration to me and i belive to many more out there. on serious note thank you Anthony for everything, it was an amazing experience and good luck on your journey foward, I'll miss you a lot
Goodbye Anthony we will always watch your videos when we miss you
I still cant belive its over, this channel quickly became a comfort thing for me after I rediscovered it a few weeks ago and began binge watching all of your videos. congratulations on graduating, you changed my life as well as many others with your content, and I cannot thank you enough  also seeing that you played omori (hehe) I think this quote from Basil really fits for you right now, "Look at all of us... These are all of our memories together... They're a little sad now... But we should be happy that they happened at all... Let's make some new memories together, okay?" Have a good rest of your life man, I know you'll go places and do great things :))
Happy graduation, hope you have just as many laughs after college, good luck Anthpo!
Thank you, Anthony.
Bye
*intense sobbing and crying*
The only two youtube videos i cried watching where technoblades death and this one. thank you so much for making these videos, they really helped me and i loved the whole 3-4 years i've been watching you.
“Thank you for sitting here and being a part of my story. Now it’s time to go live yours.” I’m graduating high school in a month and moving to college soon — this hit SO hard. Tearing up rn. Thank you anthpo!!!
Congrats!!!!

Wow. Can't believe I've been around to see the end of this. This has been an awesome channel, I've loved the crazy stuff you guys have gotten up to. Best of luck!
I have been watching you since your first video and seeing all of this makes me nostalgic, I hope you have the greatest life dude ♡ :')
Thank you for these years of content you've inspired me to not huddle in a room and to go out into the world and do whatever
the description change from “counting down till I graduate” to “graduated” 😭
Bye
:)💧
THE END OF AN ERA
Thank you Anthony for Everything, you have helped me through tough times with your hilarious videos, and well, it’s sad to see you go, but overall I am happy for you and your future, So goodbye Anthony and have a great life! 🙂
wow this got me so emotional. Anthony, you've done truly amazing things and I am so glad that all of us could go through this journey with you,=, thank you so much <3 you've made the last couple of years is amazing.

I hope i can do something similar of what you did someday. Thanks for the time and dedication you put out in every video that you made!
Damn really gone, I thank you for the laughs you’ve given me and I wish you the best goodbye.
Anthpo is like Malcolm in the Middle in the sense that it was a great show that not enough people give attention to but will always be loved for being different from the rest  I hope Anthony and friends live great lives because this truly brought smiles to my face even in the worst of times Thanks Anthpo 🎉
bro is single handedly making me want to go to college
Goodbye brother 💥❤️
Goodbye as I too have just graduated and finished undergrad 😢 gonna miss ya!
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                             ,./,/. ,/                    ,/. .,/.,/
Since watching you in high school you’ve always been my favourite YouTuber and sad to see you go but it has been a great time
Cya
This Goodbye really resonates with me as when I found your channel through the first Perry The Platypus Video I was barely entering Highschool as a Freshman, that is soon to be 4 years ago now and I am now a Senior that is soon to graduate Highschool. I feel like I have grown with you and seen you grow into this inspirational and creative Youtuber who has learned to make hopefully long lasting friendships and make the best out of college, as I am soon to be a new student at my college I just hope that I can make the memories and friendships that you have. From the bottom of my heart Anthony I thank you for everything I will always miss you but as always anythings possible with the Power Of Friendship!!!❤❤❤
I love you way too much
1:01 THEYRE CANON?!?!
Thank you Anthony for letting us be a part of your adventure! This year was also my senior year, and all the change was pretty scary, but as you and the crew have showed me, investing time with the people you love, making every minute count, is only more worth it because of the limited time we have to spend with them. Thank you Anthpo! The Power of Friendship! ❤  P.S. I also got my yearbook photo taken in your merch :3
goodbye anthony.
Damn
I discovered you yesterday...
I'm so glad i clicked on that college powerpoint video. It seemed like another quirky low budget video and i almost didnt click but im so glad i did. Your content is so pure and wholesome and it really took me on a journey. I appreciate the authenticity and great vibes. Made me happy so many times. THANK YOU ANTHPO💖
thank god you’re gone
Subscribed since fat yoshi and stayed the whole time! Hope you find something else to do that you enjoy :)
Can you maybe just maybe come back one day for a life update just one video? Please?
I want to thank anthpo so much for inspiring me to pursue content creation, I know he won't read this but, thank you anthpo.
one of the most funniest youtubers ever and we will miss alot
goodbye Good luck 😢😄
But he’s going to keep his channel right?
Bye man your a legend I will miss you have a wonderful and amazing life
there is absolutely no fucking way i found this channel the day he stopped uploading, I'm v upset about this lmfao
damn
Goodbye its been a long ride
Congratulations!
Please in like 5 or 10 years make a recap video so that we can check up on you please we will miss you so so so so much
thanks anthpo o7
Im gonna cry dude
Found your channel with the "Every episode of Phineas & Ferb" video 3 years ago and I've been watching it since. I always had a great time watching your vids. Thanks for everything.
Watching this video over and over I will always remember the past 2 years of the videos made and honestly thank you Anthony for making my life better and to give me a reason to watch YouTube.
im not crying
Goodbye Anthony I will miss this greatly but i am so happy for you and I’m excited for you and your future I hope you enjoy life
Thank you Anthony, I'm so happy for you and wish you the best, thank for inspiring many many people across the world. You will be missed :).
Goodbye antpo and thanks for all the fun.😢
it is a sad day in history
Goodbye anthpo o7
I’m not great with encouraging stuff so I’m just gonna say I certainly have loved seeing your journey through college and some of high school so just good luck with whatever you choose to do next
This is sad
thank you for including us these last four years. your friend group reminded me so much of the friends I made in high school and the shit we would get up to ; we're all still very close but also in our mid 20s at this point and that just means we've all got school, jobs, whatever, and I've missed the days we all had the time and means to act like goofballs and really thoroughly enjoy life at its most absurd.  watching you and your friends go through experiences that would have felt much at home among me and my own (who often sat and watched your videos with me for the same reason) always made me smile even when life was suffocating and a slog. you guys were always a reminder that the world can still be fun, that people are not just willing but often delighted to be part of the joke if given the chance, that there's no shame in engaging with the world earnestly and passionately.  I'll miss seeing notifications from this channel but I'm so glad to have been along for the ride; I wish you all the best in the future and I hope we'll see you again, even if in a different context, one day. thanks for everything, anthony. <3
I'm not ready 'goodbye my friend it is the end' so bitter sweet words i have cried at this video i really hope this isnt the end
i’ve watched you in an out, but it still feels weird to say goodbye. thanks for the entertainment all the time anthony. Enjoy the rest of life!
Good bye and don't look back.
I’m not crying you are😢
Thank you for the content Anthony and good luck with everything you do in the future!
Good luck with your life
This is such a great ending to an amazing journey ❤️
Respect
We all love you.
❤
Please stay
Thank you for making so many people smile for so long
Been watching since fat yoshi, Not ready to say goodbye…  But time can’t stop. Much love Anthony ❤️ Best of luck in your future endeavours ❤️
Thank you for being and showing us every moment of your life that matters and makes you happy, you made us really happy and I hope your nexts moments are amazing in your life<3
Feeling so emotional right now, but thank you for all the fond memories. Love this channel, and while I’m sad you’re leaving, I’m happy for you :)
thank you anthony
Thank you Anthony, we're gonna miss you. I hope you have a great rest of your life! ♥♥♥
Damn. Just damn. Thank you. Thank you for all the joy you brought us. Peace and strength, my guy🫡
Thank you so much for all your incredible videos, you’re an inspiration🥹
sad to see u go, but happy to look back on it all.
Are you deleting the channel or just stopping the videos?
Congrats on bein a college graduate, and over the years I've watched your videos it's been really great. Sad to see you go but I hope you do what's good for your future 😤👍🏾
🫡
It was a beautiful journey, thank you
Nice
I met you through the first Yoshi video, and honestly, for one or another reason, I watched only a few of what you posted all these years. But this, this feels like a genuine goodbye, as if I was never going to see a friend who I've always wanted to be friends with but never had the time to again. The part in which you said you found love touched me deeply and makes me think of all the things I could've gotten in my college days had I been half as an amazing person as you are. My deepest congratulations and may life have amazing things waiting for you. Thank you and farewell, my friend.
Goodbye Anthpo. You will be missed. I wish you well in your future endeavors.
Thank you Anthony for making me laugh and inspiring me to just live life and be myself. I hope the next chapter of your life fulfills your heart, soul, and mind and that you will have loads of fun. Stay amazing anthpo ❤
I might never new him but he's got a point hope he has the best life ever 😢
This channel got me through secondary school, and in September I will be starting university. Can't wait to make these kinds of memories myself! Thankyou for everything Anthony. All the best for the future, you've got a bright one.

Goodbye!!! Thank you for sharing all the wonderful adventures you experienced in your college journey. You'll always be an inspiration to college students. I wish you, Anthpo, and all your friends the best for the future!!!
Ok...and? Bye.😐😒
There’s no amount of words available where I can express how happy and sad I am too see this graduate student go, always there to make a smile and now I want to give back all the joy I got from this channel towards my last year of college. Thank you Anthony!!

thank you.
Why waste your following? Use this for a different business idea, or sell it to someone else. A following built over years is valuable
Very cool 4 years

I have been watching since the omts days. Watching your videos gave me the confidence to be extroverted once I got to college and that’s allowed me to make the friends I have today. Thank you for a beautiful experience :)

Thank you Anthony for always making me and I think a lot of other people smile in those past years. Love ya <33
Every good story needs an end after all :,)
Thank you for bringing me so much enjoyment and laughs during a time I really needed it. Wishing you the best of luck on whatever you decide to do next king!
Anthony thank you. i cant believe this is goodbye i wish you so well in ur next chapter!
I've watched this channel over the years of going to highschool. I'm in exams now, but hopefully, I will start college after summer. Your videos were great! Best of luck to anything else you set your mind to.
Farewell old friend
I DONT WANNA LET GOO
the kids are alright…
ive been watching since the perry the platypus days, and its so sad to see u go :/, but im so happy that this channel was a thing i got to experience <3
Don’t even know who you are but bye ig
fucking legend
<3
Im gonna miss you and your friends so much anthony. I never thought when i first saw a video of some kid handing out pictures of fat yoshi that your channel would mean as much as it does to me all these years later. This platform wont be nearly as much fun without you, but knowing that you're happy and successful in other areas of your life is enough for me. Adios amigo!
This channel was awesome. Thank you Anthony, good luck, and goodbye.
Thank you and good luck for everything from Italy <3
HOW COULD YOU LEAVE BEFORE THE LAST ATTACK ON TITAN VIDEO? YOU ABANDONED US BEFORE THE JOB WAS DONE ANTHONY 😭😭😭
crying a bit. AUUUGH. thank you anthony, and the entire team, for making this channel <3
Me at 13h today: Damn this guy that youtube pushed on my page and that infiltrates a cult seems nice, let's see his videos Me at 14: Oh...he's leaving...thanks youtube xD
2:57 "Thank you for being part of my life, and now it's time to live yours" man.. I just graduate from high school right now and I don't know what life haves prepared for me, just.., thank you Anthony and we're going to miss you <3
No way its been 4 years already
your videos will be missed <3
Is someone chopping onions?
Been watching you since high school and currently I'm in my third year in college, just want to say thank you. Really, this channel was always a safe place for me to come back to, and that wouldn't change in the future.
i literally JUST found you guys lol
i can’t believe we’re at the end. thank you for an awesome few years of sharing you’re incredible memories with us!
Thank you for everything Anthony
I’ve watched Anthpo for awhile, he made me so happy when we were locked up for quarantine. I was alone stuck in the house and didn’t go anywhere for months but his videos were there. Thank you <3, good luck on your future endeavors
Goodbye and thank u
✌️
Goodbye, Anthony
This feels like the end of a great TV show
This is so weird.
thank you for the content you've provided us ❤
Leaving my mark here. I've watched ever since the "Fat Yoshi" video and have seen every video you've uploaded. It's been such a wild ride and the fact that you're gone won't sink in until after the fact (as does everything), but I can still say that you've been one of, if not, the best YouTubers I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Thank you so, so much for being such an inspiration and spirited, gentle soul. Farewell, Anthony.
Thank you Anthony for inspiring us to be better and live life. We all wish you the best in wherever you go and whatever you do. We love you man, and good luck. :DD
thank you for beeing my favorite youtuber, keep going forward.
ok goodbye cunt get off my home page now
I waited two years to say this.  🖐️😲 Ok, bye!
Everything must come to an end and that's okay. I started watching your videos during quarantine, when i was a fragile high school student who was just looking for something fun to distract herself. I am now in the first year of the medical university i wanted so badly, enjoying life despite how hard and demanding it is. You inspired me to appreciate and love myself and the people that care about me. I wish you the best of luck in your future and i hope you get to live your dream life and be your best self. For me, there's 5 more years left until i can achieve my dream of becoming a doctor, but i am enjoying every step of the way. Let's go💪
you are the college life ive never had
Ill admit that ive only seen a couple handfulls of these videos before but i still almost cried watching this. One day ill finally get around to watching the rest of these and im sure i will be bawling my eyes out. Goodbye anthpo
literally not a single vid on this channel that misses to make me smile. this is seriously one of the best yt journeys ever, i hope anthony and his crew have the brighest days ahead for them <333
Can't believe he's dead rip my bro ❤❤❤
Always gonna appreciate you for the content you made and the positive impact its had on my life.  It's really crazy because so much has changed since I started watching you in 2019 and seeing how your content has matured is amazing.  Wish you the best in life❤.  Edit: This comment sounds so Parasocial but that wasn't my intent at all I have just been watching the videos for a while and wanted to comment something😭
Thank you so mush for everything. I honestly will miss u <33 bye bye
"The adventure only ends when another begins."  Anthony and his friends have graduated from college today. And I will be starting my own college life next year. And I am happy to say that you have given me all the courage, strength, and motivation in the world that I need to face this next chapter of my life. Thank you, Anthony. Thank you for everything. We love you.
We're gonna miss you, Anthpo! I've been following you since your high school days.  It's incredible to see where you've come.  Now, on to new adventures! Thank you!
Its been about a day and I don’t know what to do now
damn
Aww life hasn't even started for you yet just wait it get alot worse
from watching Anthony as a smelly 5th grader wishing I was in highschool pulling fun pranks and all that. to being in freshman year of highschool watching Anthony in college hoping he'd never actually stop the channel. but here we are. thank you for making me laugh so much over the years man. I really appreciate it.
I've honestly enjoyed the ride! Thank you for sharing these moments. You'll have them forever ❤
i can’t live like you, but i’ll sure as hell try. i’ll enjoy every last second till my final exams are over. I have about 2 weeks worth of exams spread over 6 weeks and i’m gonna study, do the work, get the grades i want, and enjoy my life during it. nothing can compete with your spontaneous high school life, but i sure as hell can do the bare minimum for enjoyment. as pewdiepie once said - ‘it’s been a wild ride.’
Thank you, man
Thank you
we will miss you bro hope yo have a good life
I just subscribed to you yesterday though 🥺❤️‍🩹
To all my brothers and sisters in Christ advancing God's Kingdom, please know that God sees your work for His Kingdom. Don't let anyone discourage you. What you're doing is right and good. Just make sure that your spreading of the Gospel is in love, no matter what. Y'all will be in my prayers. Jesus Bless ❤️🙏
Damn were gonna miss you😢
Bye bye funny funny man :^)

been watching you since 2019 when you still made videos in high school. thank u for everything
Man, it's so weird that it's ending, but it was pretty dang cool to see how it ended. You're a real inspiration, man. I remember seeing your stuff on insta and following back then in high school, and now I'm about to finish my first year of college. You showed us a good time, I wish you the best with your life
The fact that I found your channel today is pretty ironic…

Bye Anthony, thanks for all the laughs and crazy tales that you convey with your videos. I wish you all the best man
It’s weird to think it’s over I have always love watching your videos they were always able to help me when I was in my lows or just need a laugh after a long day and the day has finally come for you to go off on a new journey a new chapter and I can only wish you the best and can’t wait to see what amazing thing you will accomplish. Thank you Antony ❤

Who even are you? 💀
I am so sad this is ending but at least it was good wilst it lasted
I literally don’t even know who this guys is and I’m sad lol. Idk even know how I got here. Why does YouTube always recommend me goodbye videos.
goodbyeee!~
see you round
So long, goodbye I'll see you when I see you You can pick the street I'll meet you on the other side So long, goodbye Do I really have to finish? Do returns always diminish? Did I say that right?  [Pre-Chorus] Does anybody want to joke When no one's laughing in the background?  [Chorus] So this is how it ends I promise to never go outside again  [Verse 2] So long, bye I'm slowly losing power Has it only been an hour? No, that can't be right So long, goodbye Hey, here's a fun idea How about I sit on the couch And I watch you next time?  [Pre-Chorus] I wanna hear you tell a joke When no one's laughing in the background  [Chorus] So this is how it ends I promise to never go outside again  [Bridge] Am I going crazy? Would I еven know? Am I right back where I startеd fourteen years ago? Wanna guess the ending? If it ever does I swear to God that all I've ever wanted was A little bit of everything all of the time A bit of everything all of the time Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime I'm finished playin', and I'm stayin' inside If I wake up in a house that's full of smoke I'll panic, so call me up and tell me a joke When I'm fully irrelevant and totally broken, damn it Call me up and tell me a joke Oh, shit You're really joking at a time like this?   [Outro] Well, well, look who's inside again Went out to look for a reason to hide again Well, well, buddy, you found it Now come out with your hands up We've got you surrounded
so glad your creativity and amazing energy found your way into my life. you're an insanely inspiring human anthony love ya for life

“This was once a channel of greats, with a man like no other. But now it remains a ghost town”
Goodbye Anthpo, we will all miss you!
been watching since you started college. congratulations on graduating. i wish you all the success in the world with whatever you end up doing next
CHANGE IS SCARY, BUT SO IS STAYING THE SAME. -some email sent to all the graduates at my college  I'll miss you and your art (yes "art", not "content"). I bonded so much with my roommate by watching your vids together. But what's vastly more important is that you have a good time out there in the real world!! You got this!🎓✌️
I started watching Anthpo when i was at the end of my school life and it really helped me during the pandemic. I just joined college and i feel like i grew with Anthony videos and now it's time to make my own story. Thank you so much Anthony!
I love you anthpo, Thank You. No more need to be said.
Clicking that fat yoshi video 4 years ago was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I hope that all the joy you’ve put out into the world through your videos is repaid to you in full for the rest of you life.  God bless :)
Man it feels just like yesterday when I was watching you harrass people with yoshi
thank you for everything anthony, i wont forget you.
This can’t be happening…….😢😢😢😢
This is like the end of your favorite TV show.
good luck with life man, and thanks for making such amazing videos
i literally started watching you two days ago and im crying over this 😭😭  aww man i really wished i found you sooner :(  anyways all the best for whatevers to come and thankyou for all the wonderful content<33
Memento Mori, Anthpo.
Congrats Anthony!! Thanks for all of the tireless work you put into your videos. Your college era made me excited to attend university when I was a freshman in highschool, four years later now I’m a senior graduating myself.
Thank you!
Thank you Anthony for the great years of vids and laughter.
Thank you anthpo
Thank you, goodbye.. Anthony :)
Thanks bud for all these years, good luck in the future!
This is really the healthiest thing I’ve ever seen someone do on the internet 😂 I’m glad that you’re not letting yourself being burdened by the expectation to “be someone” online and instead choosing yourself and the life you share with the people you love.  I think a lot of people could learn from you, congratulations and best wishes!
Don’t leave us Anthony
going to miss your videos, but thank you for the content
Yes this brought such a big smile to my face!
Goodbye! Thank you Anthony, your videos always cheered me up.
PhD crossover when??!??!
Have a nice day, also vote for Kılıçdaroğlu.
I also just graduated and I didn’t enjoy it nearly as much as Mr Po did, but as I move forward into the next chapter of my life I’m determined to be better and go live my own life to the fullest. Thank you for the memories AnthPo
There's a strange beauty in such bittersweet endings. My theory is that, it is so because it's more or less an imitation of life. We start out weak and dependent, not knowing what to do and where to go but as time passes, we grow and eventually learn and walk our own paths. And through thick and thin we struggle on forward, through all it's ecstasies and miseries we carry on. Until eventually we reach an inevitable end. Maybe we find things beautiful because of it's limited nature, the fact that we may never see, hear, experience certain things is what makes them worthwhile. In the end "art imitates life"
Anthpo saw vtuber and idol graduation and thought 'that looks nice, let me try that'
Thank you so much, Anthony. I really hope I can remember to carry the messages you’ve given us, hold them close to my heart and apply them to my life. Thank you so much.
gg
I love you anthpo. I am so proud of you for graduating and stuff. The message felt real.
Peak humanity we cannot go bigger than this
I only recently watched your videos and watching this now breaks my heart, especially because I am also a uni student and a sentimental person and not good at goodbyes. I, and whoever has enjoyed your videos, will all miss you and the rest of the gang.

goodbye anthony, thank you for all
I will live my life, promise

Been watching anthpo for a long time. The high school memes were fun to watch and the college videos were amazing. Thank you for the journey Anthony.
Thank you for the best 4 years ever
I started watching this channel in highschool during low parts in my life, and now I’m in college. It’s crazy man. I’m sad that I won’t have your new videos to look forward to, but I’m so happy that you’re listening to yourself and continuing to follow your dreams. You got this Anthony.  Peace n love ✌️
Damn, it feels so weird that it’s ending. It really feels like its been a few months since I discovered Anthpo through the Perry the Platypus video. It’s been a great ride man, hope everything goes well in the future!
yeah tony p was better anyways
i’m sad now
:O
Thank you
You will be missed so much
<33
good luck.
i really hope he will change his mind and understand that what he built here for the past 4 years is nothing short of  hard work + sweat going into it. and leaving it behind is of course his choice but its kinda sad to see it just doomed to sit and age. never the less. i've been watching you for a few months and your style of videos and general content is top tier.
I wish you luck in your future man Thanks for all the great times
Goodbye, Fellow Anthony 😢
Now it's time to live yours... thanks  man
thank you anthpo, good luck
bye

I’m just about to graduate high school and this channel has made me so excited for college
Thank you Anthony
Rest in Peace, Anthony.
I just started watching your videos :”) which you the best in everything!
This will be apart of yt history  Thanks dr Anthony🫶🏼
neat
The greatest tragedy is that we didn't get to see Attack on titan s4
💗
You and your videos will always be an inspiration to me and many others. While you may be leaving the youtube scene, I'm sure whatever you chose to do in life will be just as tiring, but also fun and exciting! Thankyou for everything, Anthony, and I hope you the best!
Never in my life, would I have expected to shed a tear over ‘the guy in the yoshi onesie’ Thank you for this channel, you made me laugh, a lot. ❤❤❤
Crazy to see this day finally come. Thanks for all the videos, I myself am in a stage of uncertainty right now with my future career and plans but your videos have convinced me that it's never too late to have fun and make friends. Guess its time to live my own life now
Bro thinks hes unus annus 💀
I don’t got much to leave here but thanks for the comfort videos whenever I felt down and making me laugh for the past few years :)
2:50 man he just told us to touch grass
Time sure flies, and I can't help but tear up til the end of the video. I'm going to miss your content and you so much, Anthony. I hope you get to be successful and live a good life out there :) If your YouTube channel stays up, I'll be sure to continue watching your old videos and stay supportive no matter what. You will be missed by all of us <3
this channel has reminded me that the best things in life always have a finish line, an ending, a place when it stops.
haha your shirt is yellow for pee and your pants are brown for poo
cant believe anthony po is dead. thas crazy.
Im so happy to see you finally graduate anthony!! go have a happy life and i hope you can keep contact with your friends

I will miss these types of videos. Hope the best for you anthpo
Bye!!! Thank you for sharing your fun college experience! Definitely made my days brighter to see you post. Gonna miss this.
Farewell
Thank you for everything Anthony. For these past years, you’ve been this undeniable bright spot for me. From my highs to my lows, you’ve always been there for me whenever I needed you. It’s been such a journey getting to watch you go through school and do all these crazy things. It’s so inspirational and beautiful seeing you get to hang out and have fun with all your friends. You’ve always been this happy place for everyone, it’s so sad to see you go. Words cannot express how sad I am, but I’m also happy I got to spend time with you. I’m happy that you’re going out on such a high note and ending it at the right time. Thank you for letting us sit here and being a part of your story. Now I’ll go live mine.   So long Anthony, it was quite the wonderful story
It has been a fun ride. Your channel has inspried me greatly and made me smile and laugh during the toughest days. I will also soon be graduate from university and I do hope you the best of luck with your life after graduation. Thanks you for the past 4 years
I'm really hoping this is all a joke but bye and thank you for everything. 🫡
I got recommended to this vid so I'm technically not part of the family but goodbye
Kinda harsh and sad how Anthony like gonna stop
gg
congrats and stay safe <3
thank you anthpo. You made so many peoples lives brighter.
Thank you for such a enjoyable yet channel
U WERE THE LAST YOUTUBER THAT FELT LIKE OLD YOUTUBE 😢
Thank You Man.
I will be honest, this is sad to see, anthpo really did help me when I was feeling down, but like the saying all good things must come to an end, it was journey and while he may not post anymore, hope he has a bright future, thank you anthpo
Noooooooooo
Goodbye, Anthpo. It was a fun journey, you gave us a good laugh
Thank you for everything Anthony and have a good life
What a beautiful tribute.
“now its time to go live yours”
thats so sad ive only watched like 2 of ur vids but still noooo 😭
Lmao who are you? You supposed to be somebody or? No one knows who you are outside this cringe comment section bud.
goodbye :’) you had a good run, we all wish you the best of luck in your future and we’re excited to see where you go next even if we don’t get to be with you along the way. we’re like over supportive little league moms, we may not be able to directly affect the game you’re playing but we can show all the support we can give ❤
Thank you Anthony for everything. Your channel has been a bright spot in my life. I wish you the best you will be missed dearly
I feel like i grew up with you man, good luck on your journey!!
Thank you for all the laughs and memes, and I wish you and the rest of the group the best of luck moving forward. We will forever miss you!
Im crying man some kid who once terrorized his school in some platypus costume is making me fcking cry man wtf
made me tear up a little cried myself to sleep
now he's gonna get a real job :(
You started your journey my freshmen year and now I’m seeing you end it my senior year, this was great to I guess grow up with? Grow along with? Seeing you and your friends just be friends, have fun and enjoy school encouraged me to just have fun along my school journey too. Thank you for being that pick me up I’d need when things got tough. And happy graduation to class of 2023 :)
Thankyou
NO WAY YOU'VE ALREADY GRADUATED!! I REMEMBER YOU WERE BARELY IN HIGHSCHOOL DUDE🤧
Anthony 😭😭
Such an inspiration, we'll miss you Anthony <3
Dude I didn’t expect to get so emotional over this. I knew it was coming, but when this video came out making it official.. it’s a lot. This channel inspired me, I know that’s weird to say but when I’d watch your videos and see you having fun times with your friends I’d think “I’m gonna be that person”. When I started following your channel I was a really quiet kid, with a big personality. I wanted to do fun stuff but never had the guts. You were my inspiration to finally break out of my shell, because why not? Life is short, and crazy, and I gotta make the best of it.  Anyway, though your time on YouTube was short, it made an impact on me, and so many other people.  Ngl I did tear up watching this video, it sucks, but it’s also understandable. I’m glad you’re moving on to see the rest of what life has to offer.  We won’t forget ya anthpo!
thank u for all the memories i made from seeing u guys make ur own memories, im prolly never gonna stop rewatching ur vids
Goodbye Anthpo/Anthony, i have watch your vid in my darkest time and your vid is on of the only thing that keep me going through my life, i subscribe to you 2 years ago and its sad your going but everything must come to an end right, i hope you have great life and the last thing i want to say to you is. Thank You.
I’m just here to pay my respects to some true wisdom, goodbye Anthpo I wish you the best in whatever you choose next.
Nooooo I just found ur channel and subscribed 😭
Tysm Anthony, your videos made me realize that life isn't just working and studying, you've make me be a better person, someone who enjoys life and everything it brings. Hope you have a great future <3
Adios anthpo 🫡
It was a pleasure to follow you along those years, I hope you'll have a great life !
i only found this channel like 2 months ago and i still cried over this
thankyou.
There are no words. No phrase, no emotion, no quote, no song, no piece of art, nothing, that can explain (and I whole-heatedly believe) how much we all love and adore you, Anthony. We've had so much fun being part of your story, so much fun being part of this very chapter, and now that it's time to flip a new one, we have to be happy that chapter two has passed, and chapter three is here. Thank you, Anthony. 💙  Genuinely hoping Anthony returns one day, that would be like, the final boss comeback of all time.
As a senior grade of high school in Korea, I can tell that I always felt love and the essentials of life that no one taught me through your video. Thanks for your every highs, lows, and just everything. Not even sure what to say but I should say this. Thank you.
thank you
te amo cara
NOOOOOOO ANTHPO NO YOU HAVE TO STOP I MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO STOP
I already know I'm gonna randomly remember Anthony in like a years time and deep-dive where he ends up
Thank you and I wish you the best Anthony 🫡❤
Thank you anthpo for these four amazing years of laughs you gave us. May you live until you die, just like you have done until now :)
You have brightened up my high school and college days. I will miss this channel but I truly hope the best to anthony for his future.
From finding Anthpo from the first perry the platypus video, to then the Avatar series and THNAF, I’m so glad to have stuck around and saw this amazing channel grow. We’re gonna miss you Anthony, thanks for all the laughs and great vids ❤️
We’re gonna miss you anthpo!!
Thank you Anthpo for making me smile so much over the years!
thank you anthpo
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU BRO! ❤
Anthony you were the friend I think all of us wanted and needed in our lives and although we are not ready to say goodbye, at least let us say thank you so much. For everything.
Goodbye Anthony!
DUDE I JUST REALISED MY GRADS TMRW. WE ALMOST GRADUATED SAME DAYWTH
Thank you for everything and goodbye Anthpo
woooooooow
Godspeed Anthpo, I just want you to live your best life as an adult with nothing holding you back, I will support you throughout your life journey no matter what.
I just got a flashback of the Perry the platypus costume
Goodbye Anthony, I hope everything will go your way! Don’t think about the channel, WE ARE NOT STOPPING YOU FROM LIVING YOUR LIFE. I have been subscribed to this channel for many years and I think it is time, so just remember no matter *ANYTHING* we will always support you. ❤
Uh huh, now will this be like old YouTubers who actually meant it when they said it or is it the usual viewbait type of scenario? I mean, seeing as this and the video announcing it 2 months ago got better views than the rest of your videos in recent times, we'll just have to wait and see but my money is leaning towards the latter.
we will miss you!
Congratulations, anthpo! Goodbye, we’ll miss your unique and fun content, but what you’ve done will forever be here to help us remember the great times!  Thank you so much for what you’ve given the past few years, and I hope the future brings more greatness!
thank you anthony
07 sir. Good Luck and Yoshispeed
I don't know him. This video popped in my recommendations. Clicked on it, he seems like a good guy. Why is he leaving youtube?
I can’t believe that it’s truly over! It’s been an incredible journey but all good things must come to an end. Goodbye Anthony Antpo <3
Thank you Anthony. Your videos made me want to experience things I would’ve never done and always made me laugh, thank you ❤
Goodbye :(
goodbye Anthony best wishes on your future.
Where is bro going
I remember finding you back right when the beeg yoshi video came out, and i have been watching ever since. It was so surreal to me finding a youtuber who was my age, and experiencing a lot of the same things as me. You have been there through both the highs and lows of these past 4 years for me, and you have helped me learn to live life to the fullest every chance i get. Thank you for these 4 years Anthpo, and have a good one
Thank you Anthony.
I really do hope that anthony doesn’t delete all the videos, somehow, his videos always manage to make me laugh and actually have the courage to “live my life”. I’ll be an exchange student soon and I’m honestly afraid, but anthonys videos are a big comfort for me, I know I’ll be okay.
So does this mean he won't make videos anymore?
End of era but thank you Anthony.
True Chad
Thank you for sharing your college experience and the quality content you have always put out. I do hope you enjoy everything that happens in your future endeavors.   It has been wonderful parasocially feeding off you, and through the algorithm I shall find more souls to sate my endless need for content. You may be able to live your life Anthony, but I shall remain on this site awaiting the next Raven simp to feed me endless demand for sonic meme videos.
I felt like graudating again ❤❤❤❤
wishing you lots of happiness and health and success in the future anthony <3 ! !
:((( your videos make my day!!! i was here since forever and until your very last video. i'm so happy i get to see you go. thank you for everything!!
Thank you and good bye
Thanks for showing us what it means to live life in the moment.
🫡
Thank you!💗
it was a good time
i couldn’t not leave a comment. thank you for so much you have done. you’re such an incredible soul. you have definitely made me change several views. i wish you nothing but success in this life <3
o7
what a dork
please do well from now on :) goodluck anthony!
Darn, I just found your channel. Despite missing new content, I'm happy that you're happy and big congrats on graduating! May your future always be bright!
I can't believe I've been watching you for the past 3 years. You have shaped my life. It's hard to say goodbye but I find satisfaction knowing that whenever I feel low I can watch your videos. Best of luck to you Anthony.
You will always be Perry The Platypus in my heart.
I’ve been here since seventh grade when I watched you harass your fellow classmates as Perry, and holy crap has it been a wild ride.  Thank you for all the incredible memories you have given us on this channel, I wish you the very best life has to offer. Thank you, Anthpo, and to all of your friends, for everything. ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you men, you gave my life a little more of you than usual
I have enjoyed the 4 years watching you, and now i hope you will enjoy the rest of the years.
NO I was having a good time about to bake and now I saw THIS
He even show us his unlisted video T^T omg Anthpo I first watched you when I was a high schooler but now I'm going to college, Thank You for everything.. Thank you "Now it's time to go live yours" Yes, It's time. Thank you again buddy
thanks. ❤
After watching your channel since you were in high school, its sad to see it end, yet i’m happy that you chose the path you wanted to chose. I know that everybody who has been watching your videos these past years will miss you and everybody else from the Anthpo Cinematic Universe who we’ve seen come and go. You guys have created and shaped a community with videos you can’t place in a genre. From the goofy ideas to the serious conversations with your friends, these fragments of your life have stuck with us and brought us all a lot of joy. You’ve created a lot of people’s favourite youtube channel, including for me, and we’re all very grateful that you have done so. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you Anthpo and all of the Anthpo friends. I wish you all a bright future and the best of luck, we love you.
omg
Thank you anthony from the bottom of my heart thank you
you had a good run mate. have a great life
Anthony when i met you harassing people with fat yoshis i knew you were the best youtuber i ever met but haora bye
"It's okay to not be okay" Hit a little too hard.
Goodbye :)
The second I saw the notification, I felt like I didn't want to watch it. I wasn't ready for this journey to end. I truly enjoyed every video, from beginning to end. I remember watching your antics so long ago.   Everyone has grown in ways I can't explain.  I am so grateful to have found your channel by pure accident. It was a blast.  Best wishes to you and all your friends.
I got this feeling that we will meet again, I'll catch y'all later.
i was here.
Thank you Anthony! You've brought so much joy and fund into all of our lives <3 May life treat you well in your onward journeys
Thank you Anthony, may your future be brighter than the fucking sun.
I guess this is goodbye. Honestly, am not ready to accept it yet. But i think i can move on. And i hope that you find your dream job! We will miss you anthpo, and i hope you would miss us too   Note: maybe someday, ill be like you. I'll post my highlights of my life in highschool. The friends that i soon will meet, the journey with my new and old friends. (I hope 😅) Probably wont edit them lol
Weird question but is this a common thing? All those moments in this video looked like in a movie. Friends and doing many many things together and having fun. I want that too but I don't have anyone here who would like to do things together in the freetime. Does anyone have memories like that or is living that right now?
Thanks for sharing Anthpo, Goodbye!
i watched your ben 10 and perry video , subscribed and has been watching you since ,  thanx for sharing your moments and take care ,bye :)
Been watching you since you're in highschool. Goodbye Anthony,and thank you and everyone in the crew for the memories
Am I the only one in disbelief?😢
It sure has been a journey These 4 Years have been fun Thank you Anthpo aka the "perry the platypus in college" guy
You've made me happy since the day I found your channel 4 years ago, and it'll honestly be really difficult to see you go, nevertheless I wish you the best in your life, because if someone deserves to libe happily it's you guys. You truly are the main character. Farewell!
Man no one in the real world actually cares.  You're just another narcissistic "content creator" on YouTube. You have done nothing.
Thank you for all the laughs and thrills Anthony, we’re honored to be part of you story, and we thank you for helping us find ours 😊
goodbye anthony ill miss you hoping the best for you!
16/05/2023 been a fun ride everyone cya
Honestly im so gladd i found your channel there is no video that i didnt enjoy pushiing me to fiind new experiencces in life so i am so happy to get to see it happen in real time since your high school videos, todey im graduating high school so i thank you for entertaning me and everybodey else for these past years .
This journey was legendary
Thank you Anthony. You’ve been a great YouTuber. It’s crazy that I’ve grown with you from being in middle school to this being my last year of school. You’ve always brought me joy and a laugh when I needed it. Thank you
Cheers to the end of a wonderful channel, and to a wonderful era 🏆 We all wish you the best of luck in whatever you do next.
things have been so shit for me in the last two years in my social circles. These videos were honestly there to remind me that there was still hope and maybe a chance for things to get better.  Things are still not the greatest, but its way better than before, and im looking forward to living my life comfortably for the first time. Its honestly poetic that this video came out at the same time. Thank you, Anthpo, for sharing your wonderful stories with us.
You're a legend dude. It's sad to see you go.. But everyone gotta move on at some point.
I guess there's nothing really left to watch on YouTube now?
All I have to say is this man is a LEGEND He made me happy for four fucking years and please PLEASE let us all wish him a amazing farewell for he will stay as one of the greatest
Goodbye Anthpo! Thank you for inspiring me to literally go outside more, talk to more people and socialise.  I will always remember you as my inspiration for college haha I hope you have a good life❤
Leaving my mark here. Thank you for everything
im sobbing rn...
this video was a tough watch. i’ve been watching since the trolling with fat yoshi video, so i’ve seen you and your channel go through a lot. never thought that graduation day counter would really hit 0. thank you for many years of extremely entertaining videos, hope life serves you well and you keep finding the same success in any endeavors later on. thank you, anthony (world’s #1 youtuber)
From yoshi to this
How do you make your friends like you that much?
😭
You're Amazing bud.
Wathcing you grow has been some of the best years of everyone’s life I’m sure so glad you got to share it and have a good life good luck with everything you do going forwards (:
Imma miss you anthony
Good luck, and thank you for this! ❤
Thank you for showing me how to create memories in a correct way, you're the best!
I literally just joined this journey wth NOOO
From harassing people with fat Yoshi to this, you are one of my favourite YouTubers and it's sad that I have to say goodbye😢
I just got you on recommendation. But bro. Congratulations... Like really congratulations bro on a journey well made and experienced.. And as a lot of people will say. It is mostly always the beginning.. keep on exploring.. Kudos to you and everyone who knows your tale your friends, family, fans and all..
This feels, unreal. He made me into the person I am today, I want to be a person like him. To have a highlight in my life, a community, to be able to look back and know I had fun. U made more than 1 million people happy, it feels a bit sour to know that I will never see fat yoshi again.
The good times don't have to end when college does. Good luck on whatever's next man.
Thank you Anthony for all the great laughs and moments, they definitely did not go to waste. I wish that we could get one last year of your videos but there is so much we can do. Good luck with life Anthony ❤
Yo, later Anthony
I remember finding this channel because of attack on titan, and in these 2 years of had so much fun with this channel, so thanks Anthpo
💗
bye and thank you, anthony!
absolutely fucking legendary run
Thank you so much for so many wonderful videos!!
The past few years have been amazing. Thank you, Anthony. For everything. You and your friends have really put a smile on my face during my lowest moments, and I’m forever grateful. I wish you all the best future.
goodbye, king. you will be missed, but not forgotten 💙
During my first year of college I was so lonely and watching your videos made me feel like I had someone and they really helped me survive that first year. Now that I now have my own group going into my junior year I can’t wait to live my life! Thank you for all you do and good luck in the big adult world<3
Good luck. Hope life will go your way in the future ❤
he is living the wattpad college life😂
thank you anthpo for making me a better friend. I've been here since the beginning and it's sad to see you go but exciting to see how far you came and no matter what direction life takes you, i'm sure you will do amazing
Goodbye and thanks.
Man, I'm sorry to see you go. As someone who has been supporting you since 200k, I can tell with confidence that I enjoyed every single laugh, tear, and smile while watching your videos. You showed me the importance of living a life that others would remember and the importance of savoring each and every moment. All the adventures, goofy moments, and memories you made with your friends changed my personality. I'm starting high school next year and can't wait to make such memories with the people I love. Honestly, bro, it's been one hell of a ride, and I will remember what your videos did for me for the rest of my life. Thank you Anthony <3 YOLO.
At similar crossroads, while you finally graduated from college, I'll now be graduating from high school and entering college, now leaving the hilarious and stupid, and the sad and bittersweet memories from this chapter of my life. Being so physically distant to the close friends you had, makes the next journey a bit lonely. The first time I saw your videos was the High School Yoshi Video, and ended up binging to your other videos of tomfoolery during high school up to your anime and Breaking Bad skits. Makes me remember the dumb skits we did in our classrooms. The future is surely a frightening place, but I hope we'll be able to carry on, and we'll get to "live the life that's surely ours."  Thanks for this channel, Anthony.
I've been watching since your second video, and all i can say is thank you. Your videos helped me stay hopeful. They inspired me to post silly shit of whatever i want to. Good luck with your future, i'm sure it'll be great.
Congratulations and farewell, Anthony!
Nice
It was amazing to watch you grow from Perry the Platypus in high school to now. Love the vids, and good luck in life 🫡
All this and his most watched video is still harassing people as perry the platypus
Goodbye man, see you one day, YoshiMan.
Thank you for being here with us. We are going to miss you brother. Thank you for my teen years.
Farewell, Anthpo, I hope we will see you again, even if it’s in 10 or 15 years
I am graduating this year too, thank you for being here🙏best wishes
Great and funny videos. I'm glad I got to watch them
❤
Goodbye and Thank You! You have been inspiring to me!
“NO NO STAY WITH ME. DON’T LEAVE ME”- Batman
As someone who’s starting college in a few months or so, thank you for being a role model.
I’ll see you later! I first discovered your videos junior year of high school and now I’m officially a junior in college! Regardless of what you do next you’ll find happiness! Thank you for the laughs <3
bye
Fuckin' love you man. I'm... I'm legitimately, absolutely, without a doubt, going to miss you my dude. - You are amazing Anthony.  <3 o7
Goodbye
imagine this channel was just one big college exam final submission   we will miss your content anthpo
GOODBYE ANTHPOOOOO If i am gonna be honest i haven't watched your newests videos in a while but i'm sure they're all great and i hope i can one day i can have the same amount of confidence like you to do those silly stuffs like wearing a platypus suit in school, having a photo of fat yoshi and handing it out to random peoplee and such. Also your skits are great and well all your videos are good to be honest. Oh well that's all i just wanted to leave a comment i guess GOODBYE ANTHPO
Thank you anthony for being a part of my life. I found your channel 4 years ago and time pasts by so quickly, I didn't realize that it already ended. In 2 years I'm going to university, I've made new friends, learnt new things and found myself in a relationship. I hope my life would be as fun as yours, and I hope you have a decent life in the future.. Goodbye Anthpo
A letter to Anthpo:   Dear Anthony Potero, also known as Anthpo,  What can I say? Truly, what can I say that would express an 1/100 of what I feel. I've watched you channel for about 3-4 years, more or less. I was in high school yet, and you were already making this amazing content. You're absolutely one of the best youtubers out there (After Tony P. of course), and I'm sure you inspired, and will continue to inspire, many people around the world, myself included. I found myself binge watching your videos multiple times, from the High School saga, to the THNAF arc, to the acclaimed College series, wanting to be your friend, wanting to be with your friends and participate in your videos, laughing all day and all night long, treasuring all these memories and now that it's over I...   I'm not sure what to say.   While watching this video I almost cried countless times.  No, let me rephrase rephrase that.  While watching *all* the videos this last month I almost cried countless times. The dates going down and down, each video really pulled the strings of my heart.  And now...  Well... What can I say? After watching this channel for years, this really hurts. I want to cry. I want to cry so much.  But I won't. Why? Because all these videos prepared us to the end. And never with _just_ a sad tone, but with a cheerful one.  "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened."  Wherever you go, I wish you all the happiness in the world Anthpo.  You deserve it.  God bless you.   To the Power of Friendship.  With love,  Mario and all of te ACU fans.
I’ll miss you

man I'm going to miss him </3  all the best anthony tysm for the smiles and laughs u've given us!!
I'm gonna miss  this channel
Why is he leaving the channel when he graduates? I don’t get it
Goodbye Anthony.
Anthony's channel is one that I check in on every so often, when a video that caught my attention appears on my recommended. I've never been an avid watcher, but I've found since he announced the end of this channel that I have watched more and more. I didn't expect to be emotional, but hearing Anthony say "now it's time to go live yours" as he graduates and as I sit my A-levels before I start uni next year. That got to me I cant lie. Good luck in the future, I hope you continue to have fun
thanks, just thanks
Thank you
Thankyou Anthony, thankyou.
Thank you Anthony:)
Thank you anthony, for everything
We’ll miss you 🫡
thank you for taking us along for the ride, we will never forget the adventures trust me. Thank you for everything, be safe and live well. I hope that you have a good life anthony

THANKS BRO BYE BYE !!!!!!!!!!
❤
I just found your videos about a month ago and will be watching more, but this one brought me to TEARS. Wishing you and your friends the very best!
Wishing him the best
This is so bittersweet. I'm glad anthony got to experience what he truly wanted from youtube, and was able to document the highs, lows, and everything in between for our entertainment. This channel is a glimpse into the passion, creativity, and soul that anthony puts into each and every video, and I'm just glad to have been along for the ride. Thank you Anthony!
This channel was one of the highest times of my day. we all knew it was going to end, but we didnt think it'd be so soon. live ur life mate. Good life to u
Thanks for this, I'm starting my first year of high school / college next year, I hope it will be the ride of my life. Goodbye, we'll miss you.

Thank you
“Now it’s time to live yours”
Thank you for everything Anthony, your channel was amaizing and youre an awsome person, i wish you the best of luck in your future and in life. You will always be rememberd as a legend on this platform and i will always remember you as the man who inspierd me to get out of my comfort zone and be more confident and social. Your channel is a work of art.  Thank you for everything.
you can’t do this to me anthony
Bye Anthony! I hope you enjoy what else you’ll do.
Its sad to see people like you go, thanks for brightening our days, wish you luck and happy graduation Anthony ❤
I'm really sad to see you go, as your editing style was one of the best I've seen on this platform, and your videos were incredibly charismatic and captivating to the point I could just watch it over and over. I hope you will make the best of life with the new opportunities you'll create.
Goodbye Anthpo, It was a wild ride, we'll miss you here. thanks for all the great videos you made.
See ya
Damn this was amazing time remember when my friend showed me your video with yoshi 1:13  and we started watching you since then . Man have a great rest of your life , you made it better for everyone watching this ❤
I just wanna thank you, i never thought i would find such a meaningful content in the chanel, or in any other chanel. Your development, wow, easily wow. Through you, i learn so much about a lot of things, but most importantly, thanks for teaching us the power of friendship. You give me so much motivation to understand people, you give me so much understatement of what i really hope to become. There's only thank yous for you, man. I really hope you never forget all the lessons you learn through the years, and you keep getting more and more, keep growing and adding more qualities to the impressive human being you actually are. Thank you for these years, i hope you have a life full of the meaning you teach us, and more. Thank you.
Well tbh i have no idea who you are and i never saw any of your videos and i have no idea why this video in my recommended but nice to meet ya and good bey
This is surreal, im boutta graduate high school and go to college and man it’s been crazy watching this journey over the years 😢
Crazy what you've managed to do in all this time and the effect it's had on so so many people. I still have a small fat yoshi printout my friend gave me four years ago. The fact that it's been that long is insane. Wishing you the best! ❤
A
we love you SO much anthpo, I wish you the very best in your future. Your videos got me through some shit times and I'm sure they will continue to do so. You have made countless lives brighter, thank you for all you've done for myself and many others
I’m both excited and a bit melancholic. I’ve been staring at my screen for quite a while, thinking of what to type, but all I really know to say is thank you. Thank you for the videos and the memories. I’m sure it feels weird to see so many strangers send you heartfelt messages, but I, like many other people here, felt like I had to say something. We all wish you the best, Anthony!
Farewell Anthony. Have a great life
Wow, I didn't realize this day would arrive so soon. Seeing your videos made my childhood filled with laughter, and I just wanted to thank you for that. I enjoyed watching you grow up, meet new people, and do many fun and great things. It is with a heavy heart that I say thank you and goodbye.
Shit was dope, thank you
o7
😭😭😭😭dam
I will miss you <3
Congratulations on reaching this significant milestone as a college graduate! As I watch your farewell video, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions. Over the past four years, you have shared the highlights of your life on this channel, and I want to express my deepest gratitude for the laughter, experiences, and genuine moments you've brought into our lives.  Life can be both challenging and mundane, and it's reassuring to hear your reminder that it's okay not to have everything figured out. Your authenticity has been a breath of fresh air in a world often dominated by false expectations. Through your videos, you have created a community where we could laugh, travel, and even fall in love alongside you.   As you embark on your next chapter, I want you to know that your impact goes beyond the screen. You have touched hearts and inspired many with your openness and vulnerability. We are grateful to have been a part of your story and will carry the memories and lessons you've shared with us.  Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors. Farewell, anthpo, and thank you for allowing us to be a part of your incredible journey.
Goodbye Anthony <3
been a good however many years, anthony. good luck with the rest of your life, we will miss you.
Truly I’m not ready to say goodbye… I’ve been watching you since before Covid and your videos really helped me get through all of it. I’m so glad to have been apart of this experience and I’m crying a lot but that’s also probably because I’m sick.  You remind us to live life to the fullest and to not waste a second of it  Good luck in whatever awaits you in the future, Anthpo 💕
Aight, it was fun. See you in the future man.
Anthony i really wanted to leave a comment that was not cringey but i dont think i can do that.. Your genuine friendships helped me out of multiple toxic friendships, your content and you just having fun with friends made me realise i should be with people who love and cherish me not people who try to push my personality down or be ashamed of it, I have a very big personality, I'm a real softie who is always positive and  loves telling dirty jokes as well as being an absolute menace to everyone (basically just a massive middle finger to everything) and I'm not ashamed of that part of me in the slightest, I obviously have gotten out of most those friendships and am trying to to find people i fit in with like your friends, i love how quirky all your friends are and thats exactly what i want, and i know whether its now, in high school or in uni, I will meet those people, just like how you did, Antony i will miss you so unimaginably much and will most likely watch all your videos as comfort for bad times, Im so happy i got to see your experiences Good luck out there and, The power of friendship :)
Thx for the content bro, good luck and have fun with the rest of your future!
Thankyou and goodbye
i soert of "grew up" with anthpo, i mean i've been wathcing this guy since his highschool days and seeing him leave i am happy and also sad. Anthpo has been such a great inspiration to me and i know has ahs been to thers aswell. i hope whatvere you're going to do now it will be great. Thank you Anthony for all of it
Damn, this was one Hell of a ride. I do hope you have a great future, man. This could've easily gone down as a standard blog but no: you swung by, lead to interesting tales over four years, so on and so forth. Thanks anthpo... May you be well, wherever you go.
Thankyou so much for sharing these years with us. We all love your content and we hope you have a good life <3
Thank you Anthony, thank you so much   And Congratulations, im so excited to see how you change the world. Grow and prosper.   Thank you truly
Your increadibly creative so I'll be looking forward for your future projects! best of luck in your future activites wishing u all the best
I liked the last line you said- " Now it's time to go live yours. "   I think it's a great reminder to viewers that even if THIS channel is over, they can still emulate these things in their lives and carry on the spirit of AnthPo. And i think that's beautiful
I will miss these videos. But this is a amazing end of a channel! Its like the end of a show that youve watched for years finally end. It will be sad but the time I had watching your videos have been great. Good luck in whatever you do in the future antpho!
But does this mean he will make more videos?
The “Now is time to go live yours.” really hits home for me. I just graduated high school and now I’m going into college and beginning the rest of my life. There are so many exciting yet terrifying things ahead of me, and I can’t wait for “my turn” to begin come fall. Thanks Anthony, it’s been a wild ride, and i’ll do my best to make some more great memories of my own.
Thank you so much for allowing us to spend our time with you. Wish you all the best
Truly one of the only recent youtubers I've kept up with! It was great watching you, Covid wouldn't have been the same without your videos.
I may not be one of the first to discover the channel, but I got here early enough to realize that you really are worth it. Apart from the fact that your content has been just A-M-A-Z-I-N-G, I am sure that you've been able to inspire others to do the same as you or even other incredible things. Thank you for everything anthpo.
Thank you for everything Anthony. 🤍
this is so bittersweet…does this mean he’s done uploading i don’t want to say goodbye
IM SOBBING
Been watching your videos since you were still in HS and it has always been a joy to watch them and see you share your college experience as I just started mine this year. Thank you for entertaining me while I was simply eating or having a bad day from school and trying to "escape reality" for some minutes through your videos. I wish you the best in the future as well as for your friends and I hope I'll also make timeless friends like you did at college. Thank you again Anthony :)
Thank you so much for being a part of my life, Anthpo. Best wishes on your journey ❤
Have a nice life
I don't even know who this is, I just got it recommended. YouTube has us saying goodbye before we even said hello. Seems like it was an unus annus vibe, just living. Hope my bro goes on to live well.
What a legend❤🎉 Truly thankful to u man. Been here from the very start and do not regret a thing! Thank you for the cursed humor and best 4 years of my life💗💞
All I can really say is goodbye and thankyou so much through helping me in my life. Im going to sound like everybody else here anyways but you have helped me through many ups and downs. I found the channel from the first perry the platypus vid and its been a blast. Time flew right by after the countdown vid and I grew accustomed to all the videos and people so one last thankyou
1:12 that was the first video I saw from your channel, it was so long ago🥺
Killer music taste
goodbye Anthony you funny college man
cu
Goodbye indeed
thank you and goodbye, anthony.
Thanks for everything
what cool guy.
Bye bye
bye anthony, it was good knowing you. Have fabulous part of the next adventure you have.
You've made us happy for years, now it's your turn. Goodbye and thank you for everything, I love you all.
Iv never commented on a video but i feel that i need to at least in this one. Almost all of your videos are heartwarming, I always felt happy when i saw a new video in my feed, thanks for all of this years, lets live our lives for now on. Will miss you bro ❤
it is sad to see you leave but i will say this has been a fun ride
Hope life treats you well, Anthony! If you ever come back, we will be here with open arms! Cheers, and good luck!
This man shows you how fun life can be, but people wanna sit inside all day doing nothing, thank you Anthony for the amazing videos.

thank you anthpo! this feels like the only channel that never fails to make me smile, ive watched every video multiple times and they gave me confidence to go and put myself out there in my first year of uni and find a group of friends that bring me as much joy as I see you guys having. I'm the happiest ive ever been and you deserve a bit of that credit! thank you for all you've done
lets goooo sir
youve literally been a part of my life for the past four years… this is so depressing
I have Been watching since Perry and I have grown so much with this channel love and have gotten attached to evryone on this channel I’ve learned what real friendship is and I hope to have a bond like all of you guys had I hope that you’ll come back just for a check up or anything really because it’s going to be hard to make it without your videos and I know I’ll rewatch them until I know them by heart good luck 🫶🫶🫶
I can’t believe the years have gone by so quickly. Thank you for all the memories and laughs. I sincerely wish the best for you in life. We’ll miss you. <3
❤❤❤
Im just waiting for a video thumbnail in a fish suit saying:You really thought i could graduate college?!!? Really though i have absolutely enjoyed watching you videos and im pretty sure youve just inspired me to start doing what i want to do so thanks❤
thank you for letting us be a part of your memories. theres so much i want to say but i cant explain just how much you’ve given us by sharing the happiness and energy between you and your friends. that i would have never thought a random video of a guy going around his highschool giving people prints of fat yoshi that i stumbled upon years ago would stick with me for this long. i basically spent 4 years of my degree watching this channel and im so proud and happy to see you and your friends graduate as well. good luck for your future, and may we be able to see a glimpse of your memories again one day.
Wait, so he planned it all so that the "Until Graduation" would have exactly 69 videos in it?
Thank you anthpo for the moments you shared with us :) From goofing around in a perry the platypus costume (I had to bring that up because it's the first video I saw) to winning a tournament in anime uniforms, it was a really fun journey  I've been watching your videos for years now and they made a lot of my days better  I honestly think that you and the videos you created showed me how much fun it is to interact with other people and it made me go out and have more fun in my life   Thank you for that Anthony -> I wish you all the best and I smile when I rewatch your videos :D
F in the chat

I’ll be honest I haven’t watched this channel in some time, but it’s bittersweet to see you go. You make America look so entertaining despite what most media portrays it as, and I’m glad for that as a Briton. I hope you live a great life :)
the very best channel on youtube, somehow all the random weird shit motivated me and here I am at college too and i will make sure to carry your legacy, thank you anthpo for all the laughs and bringing me company for lunch(P.S I HOPE YOU SAY SIKE AND THIS IS NOT THE LAST VIDEO)
you have been a really amazing person on this platform. the videos you made stood out from most other content creators. now my sleepy ass will go back to sleep. goodbye, we will miss you.
thank you for memories. :)
Ok this is emotional and everything, but who gets to keep Paul?
Goodbye king.
goodbye and gl with life my boy, gonna miss you
ly bro 😔
you are what i want to become❤️
The end has come… I hope for you the best.This adventure was wonderful.Thank you.
This is wild. I’m graduating High School myself, and your channel has been one of the things making me so excited for college. Thank You!
I'm going to cry omg I wish you all of the best for the rest of your life ❤
Ok to be honest I don’t get why  the comment section is so sad about a YouTuber leaving I mean sure it’s a shame you don’t make videos anymore but everyone acts like there whole live was this channel. Anyways good for you with the graduation thing and all but please comments calm down
The fact this is the 69th video in the untill graduatuon playlist is perfect.
under 4 years, he made a lot of care-free memories. i wonder if i'll be like that sooner.. entering college is going to be my next step in life. thank you for being an inspiration and a part of my teenage life as well, anthpo. 🤍
Well I'm so glad that I was able to be here along for the ride, we'll miss you Anthpo but we wish you the best of luck in your future journies
Goodbye Anthony
Going to University or College as you Americans know it, this year, honestly it’s so nervewrecking since I won’t be seeing any of my highschool friends anymore and I’d be living there as well. I’ve always wanted to live alone but I don’t know if I actually can live alone, of course I’ll meet people and everything but it still just makes me a bit anxious about everything but I’m still very excited about what I’m going to be facing in coming months
I LOVE YOU MAN U GOOD THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME HAPPY
Wow bro so deep. No one cares
thank you
congratulations Anthony, you have brought me so much happiness as a child so i hope you find more happiness out in the real world
This made me smile and cry thank you Anthony
literally crying all over thank you anthony and to everyone in the ACU for making and participating in these videos that have been part of my life for many years. you made me laugh, cry, and feel like I'm not alone in the world. love you all and good luck with whatever it is life will bring your way♥
Thank you so much this has been the greatest channel I’ve ever seen I hope you do great in the new chapter of your life ❤️
Ok goodbye
I wasn't apart of this journey for long but I'm glad I was here for the rest of it :)
The end of an era. But also the beginning of a new one. We appreciate everything you've done and wish you the best on the path you've chosen <3
Blud, I'm crying ffs
This mf graduating? Shit we're getting old
we'll miss you, buddy. I hope you have a great life.
Thank you for everything, Anthony, and I wish you all the best in whatever you choose to do. I am going to live out my story now. Goodbye!
<3
You are positively the GOAT, Anthony. Love you so much, you got me and so many others through many hard times, thank you for all you've done and all the opportunities you gave us to live out those highlights of your life alongside you. It hurts to say goodbye but I hope that you live a lovely life. You have a bright future ahead of you.
WAIT WHAT JANICE AND ANTHPO LIKE LIKE THEY FELL LIKE IN LOVE???? WHATT
Gonna miss y'all. Best wishes for the future, I know you'll go places. (I know this sounds like I stole this from a graduation card, but it's true).
Go and get a damn haircut then
goodbye :((
Thanks
I'm gonna miss your content so much, man! But I'm really thankful for all the laughs and smiles you've gotten out of me. Have an amazing life, Anthony!
Thank you so much Anthony, it's hard to let go. This was truly an amazing adventure and I hope to make my life the best it can be.

Having come in about halfway through the journey after finding you from an Alpharad video, this has been an amazing time. Thanks for these wonderful memories and go live your life as well

Goodbye Anthony, thank you for many great years of your content.
Thank you for everything <3
:(
I'm gonna miss your videos, Anthony.. that perry the platypus video will always be my favorite video ❤
im glad to have found this channel right by my middle school years, setting an expectation of how i should approach high school. now that im actually here with 1 year left, i wont waste it. i love photos, filming and editing and decided this was something i wanted to go out and create, even if it wasnt as interesting as yours. the memories. i wanna keep them dear to my years with friends and teachers so im grateful for that. i know you wont see this, as will i after i leave this video. but i hope when i do remember this comment, ill have lived some of my best years just as did, and will, you in this near future Anthony :)
Thanks, your channel has been a huge inspiration to me in life. Stay safe wherever you are. I enjoyed my time watching your videos.
Thanks for the 4 years Anthpo I'll always remember you and I hope you'll have a prosperous future in whatever you'll do after this.
I just noticed he made 69 videos until graduation…nice! 😏
I can’t leave this video without at least saying congratulations. I love your channel, and even though I haven’t watched a video in a while, I’m glad to be here for the goodbye. Thank you, Anthony
Goodbye!
I'm going to miss you Anthony. You're one of the few YouTubers whom I've genuinely enjoyed every single video you release and it's been an amazing, wild ride. I feel lucky to have been able to see this channel through to it's end.  You have a bright future ahead and I hope you make the most of it :) We love you Anthpo <3
Anthony, thank you for being a part of my youth. I've been following you since I was ten, and to be honest, you've changed my life. You altered my sense of humor, demeanor, and the way I interact with my friends. Seeing you leave breaks my heart. Thank you for all that you do.
I don't think I can say anything other than congratulations on graduating, and thank you for everything Anthony. May you live the rest of your life to the fullest, or something. See all you viewers in 20 years when a random anthpo video is in my recommended and I get a wave of nostalgia. Goodbye.
Congrats on graduating college and making everyone so happy with your content
Currently in my first year in university, watching this gives me motivation to see it through the end and graduate myself. Thank you =)
I would like to thank anthony for all of the fun and joy😊🎉 that he show me thru out the years and yes goodbye is hard to say but he's now a man now gonna explore and have a happy life,but we will never forget the moment's that you made us laugh and enjoy thank you anthony❤😊 Btw congratulation's be strong    Since you are one of my favorite youtuber's . Goodbye❤❤
You've been one of my favorite YouTubers during the pandemic and helped me get through that those rough years so all I can say is, Thank you, Anthony
From Perry the platypus to this, glad to be a part of this journey

I've been here since the yoshi video im gonna miss you ,  you were one of my favorites these past few years I've improved so much becoming a varsity wrestler on my second season and im happy I got to have this channel these past few years
bro ive been here ever since you just starting to get famous and im so happy on all the things youve achieved even tho i cant watched all of ur vids anymore.  were really just getting old. good luck to the next chaper of your life
:<
Thank you so much for this channel, ever since I found your videos all the way from highschool, I fell in love with the humour and the weird videos you'd give us, the little fun snippets of your life. I'm going to be finishing college this week and I'm nervous about what the future will be like for me. Hearing that line, 'now it's time to go live yours', it gives me confidence in doing my best and getting the most out of it no matter how hard it'll be. Thank you Anthony as well as everyone else, wishing you all the best in life!
I'm not crying. You're crying.
we will all miss you anthpo your one of the greatest youtubers to ever reach this playform thx for all the content
You've made so many people smile over the past few years, and I think that's really the most important thing you can do in life. Your videos have helped me when I was lost, and I hope that the memories and all the lives you've brightened will remind you of who you are when you're lost, too. What goes around comes around. Thank you, Anthony :)
Thank you for everything you’ve done  <3  it’s been a fun ride and seeing your videos have made me feel very happy
you will be missed antony
"So long, Gay Bowser."
Anothy, you made my days so much better, you made me smile when i felt like crying, you made me laugh when i was sad, and you just overall made me look forward to you posting. i understand why your quitting, but really Anothy, we should be the ones saying thank you, thank you for being you, thank you for making us laugh, thank you for starting this channel, thank you for documenting your friendship, thank you for the late nights watching your videos because we couldn't sleep, thank you for sharing your memories, thank you for trying to post as often as possible, thank you for putting your all, and most importantly thank you for everything. ❤‍🩹
Bye anthony, you will be missed. Thanks for all the memories man, hope you the best in the future! God bless!!!
I can't believe that you're gone, I feel like I really took it for granted, thank you for giving me the joy I had gotten watching your videos Anthpo.

This feels like a weird thing to take away from this video but Anthony has helped me gain the courage to change my own circumstances, if only by a bit, to get closer to the life I wanna live.
Love

Aye congrats buddy I bet you had some crazy times i haven’t started college yet but you helped excite me I appreciate u

We will all miss you alot and i hope you have fun in the future and put more smiles on peoples faces
You know what they say, all good things must come to an end. Thank you, Anthony, for the great content over the years. I hope you find success in whatever it is you choose to pursue in the future, whether you're already looking for a job to go with the shiny new degree, or taking it slow for a while.
I understand you dude I am also a soon to be graduate student too.
Thank u anthpo :)
Man I came here thinking you were joking, I didn't expect to get hit with a truckload of emotions.  Thanks for the good laughs, Anthpo. Wish you the best in whatever happens next.  Still can't believe it's been this long, tbh.
I just watched some of his videos and then I subscribed yesterday and he quits💀
Truely an adventure off a life time wishing the best in your future endeavors
We will miss you so much man!! So proud of you!!❤❤

Thanks for all you’ve done Anthony. Your videos have helped me through so much, they’ve always brightened my day. I wish you the best now that you’ve graduated!
I was literally watching this video last night at about 11:30pm, i was feeling really emotional while watching this. My mom came in calling me to go to sleep and i said let me finish it. After i finish it my mom came out again getting mad at me, so, i explain to her about what i was watching and what was going to happen to Anthpo, in the middle of my explanation i suddenly started crying, but in the end i was not ready to say good bye. Thank you fro all your content and i hope veryone will give a moment of silence for this man
You made me smile and gave me joy during tough times I love you man
i'm not ready.
thank you so much anthony!
He liked my tiktok comment once my comment was the only one he liked, i liked that day.
It's really hard to move on sometimes, but I'm happy that anthpo will get to live his own life to the fullest without having to do YouTube. He really inspired me to do cool stuff and appreciate the present moment, so I'm really happy he gets to be happy himself
Wishing you all the best in your future endeavours. I literally just started watching your vids and was so sad to hear that you were leaving. Thank you for randomly popping into my feed and once again wishing you the best! 💜
Been here since 10K you are an inspiration to all, thank you for everything Anthony!

Hey Anthpo, thank you so much for all the videos you have made together with your friend and I don't think there will ever be another channel that can replicate your type's of videos, and I wish you prosperity and I hope life takes you where you need to be.
So long anthony. Hope that cash app sponsorship leads you for a long time. Good luck in anything you do
Nobody's ever ready for good-byes like this. But hey, it happened.
oh my god, thank you for getting me through these 4 years of highschool when it felt like all i needed was to go to college. now i'm a graduating senior and i feel excited and ready. thank you❤
Goodbye, and thank you
NOOOO COME BACKLKK

Have fun in life man :)

It's been a journey I'm going to miss this.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
it was truly wonderful
Nooooooo, this is sad :(((  I mean,  congratulations with graduating
I've been watching this channel for the past 4 years now... This sounds weird saying it now.
I dont know who you are but best of luck
I've never seen this channel, but congrats Anthony, you did the impossible, and I'm proud, fact is I recently got in high school, so i have a lot of catching up. either way, congrats on graduating, and party your heart out.
I haven't watched you since the first atla vid since your content didn't appeal to me anymore but congrats dude i'll check the channel out
Thank you for all the laughs and fun times you brought us. Good luck in your future endeavors <3
I wonder if he made 69 videos for Until Graduation on purpose or if its just greatest coincidence in all of history
got pretty emotional watching this video, another era of my life ended. i will definitely keep all of the things i have learnt and i hope the next chapter of your life is fantastic too Anthony!!
I'm so not ready for all this to be over but I treasure every moment   thank you for the years of amazing content because even though we only got to see the very best bits, we appreciate all of it. we're gonna miss you so much man and you're gonna somehow find a way to go even farther ♡♡

Farewell Anthpo, thank you.
I really hate that things change.

It sucks saying goodbye but its the cycle of life. Good luck and Thank you Anthpo.

Thank you Anthpo and friends for all of your adventures. This channel has impacted me so much, i never thought it was gonna end so quickly. Nonetheless, thank you.
So long and goodbye!!!
There’s another video to make a college reunion video of your adventures
It's really painful. I've been subscribed for the past 1 - 1,5 years. It's been a fun ride and I am grateful that I was able to watch you while you still did YouTube. I will miss you man. You make great videos and it was just so fun to see you and your friends fuck around. I hope you will enjoy your life now as a college graduate and as a retired YouTuber. Bye, Anthony.
Goodbye man. You've been a huge inspiration
Thank you for everything. Ever since I discovered your channel I have had a new outlook on the future. You make teens like me have hope for the future that otherwise looks bleak. Thank you Anthony.
Love you Anthony, thank you for everything, wish you all the best ❤
Im crying
Goodbye Anthony good luck in the journey that is adulthood you’ve helped me so much with your content that always makes me smile goodbye
Hard to say bye, been here since that car flying video and since than been a fan. Have a great journey in life man. I just realized that old nostalgic outdo music lol <3
I really hope he can look back on these videos in a few years and remember all the fun times he has because even tho they’re over all these events will be remembered
You will be missed <3 <3
goodbye thank you for the 2 years the 2 years of memes,the 2 years of school,the 2 years of fun.
🥲👍🏼Congratulations Anthony!!!!!!!!!!
can we still get the "every episode of attack on titan season 4" video?
So long Anthony
Congrats!     I have state testing today 💀
I started watching this channel at the right before start of junior highschool and I envisioned highschool to what is like in the videos and yeah it was like that. And now is coincidentally the last day of junior high. Today has been a emotional rollercoaster with laughs and cry's but that's life nothing's gonna stay forever.
dang you so short
Thank you for this
Thank you Anthony, for all the laughs, and all of the times your content made all of us smile. I hope you have a fruitful life. Explore, learn and enjoy what you have worked so hard for. Get out there and grasp the reward of freedom which you so desperately deserve. And most importantly enjoy life; laugh, and smile like you’ve made us since 4 years ago. Once more, thank you Anthony for having such a large impact on our lives and being there for us even in the most difficult of times.
We miss you!
Thank you for the whole 2 years where u made me laugh
goodbye
we will miss you anthony <3
Thank you Anthpo and the ✨the power of friendship✨! I hope all goes well for your futures! :D
Thank you for making us laugh, Anthony. We'll miss you but i think i can speak foreveryone when i say that we're excited to see what your future holds.
you will be missed
“Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened” -idk anymore, so many comments say it
Nice!
O7
Wow, I remember 4 years ago when you just posted the big yoshi video, time goes by fast
thanks for the laughs, have a great life, man✌
Thank you Anthony you have been a true inspiration! I will miss you tho :(
I've been watching your vids since I was in secondary school and now, I'm about to embark on my own university journey soon. Of course, I and all your subscribers would love for you to continue posting but all good things must come to an end. Thank you for the past 4 years of creating hilarious videos for me to laugh at while eating my lunch after school, emotional videos for me to reflect on my own life and how I want to live, and simply just for taking the time and effort out of your day to share your life with 1.65 million randos on the internet. Shoutout to all the people you met along the way too and appeared in your vids eg high school, the house nobody asked for, and college. Your love for those around you, from your friends to your family, is so apparent like ngl the way you show your appreciation for them so openly is smth I look up to. Best of luck for all your future endeavours and the next stage of your life!! We'll miss you, thanks for everything :)
I saw your video where you said you were leaving YouTube, then I didn't watch any of your videos until this one. It feels like no time has passed and it's just kinda weird
thank you anthpo. take care.
i only started watching you a week ago but its already so hard to say goodbye you make the best content thank you
through this channel i think you were able to push yourself to makeup for the time and memories the pandemic took from your college years, and more than that you found a large group of friends not just in college but in youtube and tiktok. I hope that it means you will always have atleast one person with you in your times of need and not fall to the drought of true friendship we experience after college ends.  Goodluck with what's next anthony, you may feel you need people to make videos or maybe that's just what you do best as a leader but sometime in the future i wish you come back even as just you :)
goodbye mr platypus man
Its been a long ride but its sad to see it end so fast. Goodbye Anthony😢 (happy grad btw)

These years haver been magical. I wish the best for you. Goodbye..
I'm going to miss your channel a lot. Know that you've brought happiness, hope and inspiration to many. I smiled a lot watching your channel and it helped me trough some tough times. It's bittersweet to see you moving on, but I know it is for the best. Have a good life and continue doing great things with it. Bye <3
So, what does the future hold for you? I’d love to follow whatever your next story is.
Hi Anthony. My name is Carlos and I’m just a Spanish guy that has been watching your videos almost since you started with the mouse plug flying car video. I know you don’t know me and maybe this sounds like a stupid fan but I want to tell you that your videos have made my high school and university stay really enjoyable. Here in Spain, the educational system is really different, we have good things but I always missed the type of things you do: clubs, group activities and many other things. I want to tell you that even than you don’t know me. You have been a good friend for me and your videos will always be in my heart. Thank you Anthpo
I LOVE YOU SO DAMN MUCH ANTHONY WISH YOU LITERALLY THE BEST IN YOUR LIFE
BYE ANTHONY WE WILL MISS YOU❤ Thank you for the wonderful content. I’ve been watching you since i saw the video of you dressed as perry the platypus 2 years ago and since then you’ve became my favorite content creator
IM GONNA MISS YOU SO MUCH 😭😭😭
I've been watching you since your 'harassing people with fat yoshi' era. And I'm also about to graduate this year. So watching all of your videos feels like a journey that I also participated in. The content that you made taught me to appreciate all the time that I had with my friends and to keep those bonds strong even after parting ways. So thank you, and I wish you the best for your future!
Thank you for showing us so much of your life and experiences and I hope in the future you will live your life to its fullest and find where your journey leads you. I didn't want this day to come to be honest but I'm glad you are growing up and living your life and wish you the best. We'll miss you!!!
Imagine having a life, couldn't be me. You guys were/are literal slice of life anime lol.
Thank you Anthony, for all the smiles you've given us these past years, we wish you the best in the future.
literally only came across your channel like 2 weeks ago and it has been the best 2 weeks ! short lived but all the best you and your friends are really cool
I didn't get here until late. Like- 3 weeks ago late. I can't say I was here for that one I think Kermit meme, or that I've been here from the start and watched his experiences. But I can say those three weeks of watching Anthony's videoes were a fun 3 weeks and though I haven't been here long, I'm sad to see it go.  Good job Anthpo, you were able to make someone who just watched your video on autoplay invested in your content as if I'd been here for so much longer. I felt welcome and appreciate you for that. Happy graduation and cheers to a bright future for you and all your friends. (Also my friend loves OKPOP)
To everyone in the comments section, hope you have a great journey ahead, full of fun and great friendships. ✨✨✨
goodbye
I only recently subscribed 😐
the journey has finally ended.
Don't be sad that it ended,be happy because it happened
Goodbye Anthony!! Thank you for everything, we wish you and your friends the best in your future. I'm glad i was able to witness your journey from harassing people with yoshi to graduating, the wonderful and amazing adventures you guys have been through will always be remembered 💙
have an amazing life, anthony 🖤 we'll miss you
Gonna make me cry holy. Im so glad i was able to be here from the start and sadly the end, i dont wanna say goodbye 😭🥹. Thank you anthop and ur friends you guys are literally amazing and i wish everyone of you the best in this world and i hope you guys have a good future. 🥹🥹( im not crying you are )
I know that probably no one is going to see this comment , but I wanted to say, thank you for everything Anthpo. I have discovered this channel somewhere during 2020 and have watched it since then. I’ve always loved all the videos, the random skits, your stories, your travels. I am still very young (turning 13 in September) but your videos have inspired me and brought a smile to my face in so many ways. It’s sad saying goodbye but I’m glad I got to see all these things, and will definitely look back into it for the next couple of years. I hope that whatever you’ll be doing now will bring you happiness and that life will treat you well. Once again, Thank you for everything. 🫶
you are the best person to be a friend
Au revoir, mon ami.
Farewell Anthony, I hope you have a great life, even if we aren't there to see it anymore
dude it's been an awesome couple of years thanks for sharin it with all of us strangers on the internet best of wishes for the rest of your life man
but why waste an already quite secured path as ur on youtube... bah
bye
I've been watching for a long ass time, and you've been one of my favorite channels throughout the years. You've brought joy to me on days when I'm feeling awful, and I know that's the same for many others. Good luck with your life Anthony, you deserve an amazing one and I know you'll make it amazing, even when times are tough. Goodbye!
Goodbye anthony <3
Anthpo the goat fr, imma miss ant 🐜
Insane how this dude blew up from a meme and kept the momentum going from there. Imma miss this channel
Thank you for making fun and interesting videos... It made me laugh and happy like dressed as perry the platypus or harass people with fat yoshi and also forming groups to accomplish something. Congrats on ur graduation. We will miss you!!! ❤😢

Love your videos anthpo and you too thank you for all the good times❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I think it goes without saying, we'll miss you, Anthony. Thanks for the videos that you've made. Without you, I'd probably lose my mind in quarantine. Anyways, thank you <3.
In the wise words of The Spaniels   Good night sweetheart, well it’s time to go
This is truly the end of an Era, we love all the content you have given us Anthpo and you have made so many such as myself eager to see what Uni life story has for us. Best wishes in the future!!1

Can’t believe this is really the guy who inspired me to be Perry. I’m so proud of you man and I want to be just like you bc u are just so inspirational.
:'C
so long soilder do great things and have a great life i salute you. (funniest time in my opinion)
Man, it's been a wild ride.  Quite frankly, i'm not ready to let go of this channel. It has been a huge part of my life since the pandemic. Thank you for making my days brighter. 😁
your videos will be greatly missed
That's one hell of a life you got there anthpo - and it's only just beginning. I wish you the ultimate the best of what your life's got next for you. Rage and love.
It is crazy that I go to the same school as you, Anthony now that I’m in kingsway High school as a sophomore and all I can say is it’s been pretty boring since you left I can tell that because all the kids are well dicks 😂
i have been watching pretty much since the beginning, and always watched your videos whenever i needed a laugh. your friend group and all the fun things you do is something everyone wants to have, and i'm so happy you shared this with all of us. i can't wait to see how far you go in you life, and as sad as we are, we are also excited and happy for you!  you truly showed us the power of friendship and i hope to have this much fun in college in the future <3
Goodbye.
:(
im legit in tears rn.
No one will ever see this comment but I just feel so sad for feeling like im leaving and never seeing a friend group that I was never even a part of :(
SOBBING
Farewell, I will miss all of your whacky moments. Thank you for having us on this long journey :)
Good luck anthonny
last line went hard
Amazing last line. Thanks man❤
It was your "saving my college as Ben 10 video" that brought me to this wonderful community,it was very soothing and wholesome to watch your videoes during the evening. You really took the thing "A good story is not complete without good ending" literally but anyway thank you bro for all the giggles. May god bless you 🙏 Best of luck for your future endeavours.     With love(no homo 😂), ~ Karthik(subscriber from past 1 and half year)
you are extremely hot
I remember him wearing the Perry the Platypus suit for the first time. Thanks man.
What now?
thanks bruh
Best wishes for your upcoming life
Man I'm gonna miss this channel. Your videos were a highlight in my week, always fun and entertaining. You're such an amazing guy and you can be sure of me revisiting this channel over and over during the next few years to rewatch your videos. I wish you all the best Anthony, you deserve it!
Well, it was about time.
God damn, just man. I'll miss you like everyone one else will. Good luck in life
We're gonna miss you man. Thank you anthony, I wish nothing but the best for you
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
byebye! it's been a real one! everyone on this channel is ridiculously bright and i hope these years will boost your every step into the future!
I remember when I first saw your video where you went around your high school in a Perry the Platypus costume and I thought it was the funniest video on YouTube. To be honest I haven’t watched a lot of your college videos but with watching these clips I think I’ll go back and watch some. Congratulations and thank you for everything!
Started watching during the perry days and after that I’ve been hooked and thank you for being one of the main sources of happiness during my life goodbye anthpo we’ll miss you.
I will not cry on the train rn. But I did. Not comparing with anyone here but I’ve personally been watching Anthpo since grade 5 or smth. Initially I thought that he was just some silly guy that appeared on my feed but I subscribed to him anyway, which was probs one of the best decisions ever because he ended up being one my favourite YouTubers with his own uniqueness and authenticness despite him possibly hiding a lot more behind the scenes since he still has a life beyond his channel which he’s moving on to right now Anyway As simply viewers, content creators can have different impacts on you whether they’re your favourite or not, a single video can offer you an existential crisis that WILL stick to you for a lifetime. YouTubers jit give you an experience if done right. There’s so many videos on this very internet, some you just glimpse for a second, then you’ll move on from . But Anthpo certainly doesn’t feel like one Despite mostly just showing moments of his life and him narrating parts of it, it feels like we’re a part of it, it’s hella comforting Ahaaaa tbh idk what exactly I should say anymore But anyhow, Anthony has fr given a lot of us something unforgettable, something worth admiring. Some stuff might still be silly at times, but it gives us inspiration and a sense of comfort somehow.  (Aha what am I saying, this is a mess lmao) As a person who’s now finally in the hellish depths of Highschool, idk  how things will go , nor do I know what I’m saying anymore, but anyhow, thank you Anthpo,  I will do my best to live my own life And to others who stayed and is able to see this very moment rn, I hope that you are able to do so too
I never thought a random perry the platapus video in my recommended would lead me to a channel that I would continue to watch for 4 years, but I'm so glad that it did. Thank you to everybody who put all the time, effort, and love into these videos.
Makes this even sadder because I’ve been watching since the start and he’s now a college graduate…and when Anthony said thank you for being a part of my story now it’s time to live yours…it really hit since after the summer I’ll be going to college
congrats on graduating and thank you for these videos!
goodbye
If i can make impacts like you, then im ready to dive in college knowing you were my idol in all of this journey🥹🫶
For me it started with the Fat Yoshi video 🥺
Did like everyone know he was in a relationship with Janice?
Bye Anthony :( love your videos
Goodbye.
BYE 💀😭
Thank you for everything and good luck Anthpo!
Thank you Anthony. For everything
Thank you man.
I rarely make comments, i have been watching since fat Yoshi. When i discovered your vidéo i would rewatch them a lot. You're the only youtuber that made me whait for the next video with excitement. It was truly a hell of a journey. Thanks you for all the laugh.
Only found your vids recently and saw a handful, but got a GREAT impression from you and loved them. You seem like an amazing person, thanks for what you've made and I hope you keep loving a wholesome BANGIN life babyyy! 🎉❤
Thank you for everything, you're an inspiration have a great life
i have to admit that i cried throughout the course of this video. i've been watching you since i was in early middle school, and now, im almost done with high school.  i'd be lying if i said that i didn't grow up with this channel. i know im just a random stranger on the internet, but thank you. thank you for entertaining us and allowing us to be part of your college experience. it's been an honor to have been part of the audience watching the anthpo cinematic universe, and to have been able to cry, laugh, and smile with you. i wish you the very best in the future, and potentially (only if you want to) wish to see you at some point again. we love you so much <3
I think you are the person who inspired my content the most, thank you im gonna miss you

Thank you Anthony, for always being there for me to watch at the high and lows of my life. Farewell
love u
I've been there. I've been there since the Perry the Platypus onesie. I've been there since the Fat Yoshi. I've been there since the Avatar videos. Anthpos videos aren't like the rest. Thank you.
Damn bro I remember watching u back in 2019 freshman year of high school. Now I'm gonna be a sophomore in college 😢I will never forget your content over these past 4 years ❤❤
It was fun while it lasted :')
👍
sobbing we're gonna miss you so much

Dude I’m so not ready for this goodbye ugh anth thankyou for making my boring life a way better day , I hope that I make videos like you since I look you up to be like you as YouTuber thank you so much ☺️ and fair well
Nobody Else Quite Like You
NOOOO
Thank you for everything, Antpho.
damn bro im sad i didnt get to be here from the start, im for sure going to watch all of the videos you guys made...  its a big commitment to stop recording all of a sudden, and i wouldnt be surprised if you made a second channel to use your popularity even longer, but if you dont just know that this channel and these people are hilarious mfs, thank you for this journey, i and many others (1,65 million people) hope to see you succeed in whatever it is you want to do, cheers!
god i'm going to miss this so much more than i can imagine
i was here in the zucchini era. proud to say i was here from the start
you will be missed..
im not ready
so sad yet so happy for you <3
thank you for all the memories, I'll miss you anthony
Anthony,  I hope this finds you, but if it doesn't, thats fine, cause it's for my peace of mind too. Even typing this out feels weird and parasocial, but It's hard to put into words how much you have truly enriched my life over the past years; I still remember the day that walking into high school in 2019 when my bestfriend showed me the perry the platypus video, You had 60k and I've watched pretty much every video since. It sounds silly, cause I'm just a name and some text to you, but I truly wouldn't be where I am today without you, approaching my last year of university as a writing student. I was directionless for a while as a teen, until you posted "life advice from a doofus" and something there just got to me. It made me reevaluate where I was going in life, prompting me to take a course that was for me, rather than society and I've watched it five times since: every time filling me with joy and memories and it genuinely made me enjoy and value my life and friends in a new way. So I just want to say thank you, for being you, for giving me some of the best advice and content ive received and for just being there these four years. I'll miss you and I wish you the best wherever life takes you. Im sure you'll make the most of it!
o7
wish i could go back in time to that fat yoshi video just to watch it all happen once again <3
God, I can't believe it's over now...
Thank you so much anthony, your videos honestly helped me a lot when i was at my lowest and they never fail to cheer me up. It's super sad saying goodbye like this but I wish you and the gang all the best in your new chapter :)  We'll miss you anthony!
Thank you Anthony for this gem of channel and journey it , truely beatiful to see this come down in such lovely and hearfelt way.
:') thank you <3
congrats on graduating and for giving us such happy memories <33 will always miss u guys
Thank you Anthpo, goodbye.
I cant say I've been a viewer as long as anyone else in this comment section. But the past month of getting to know you and your friends have made it clear what your message is - that friendship is the most important thing. And that all good eras come to an end, and that its time to move on with the next chapter of our lives.  Thanks Anthony. For the positive impact youve made on everyone youve met's lives.
i remember when he was harassing people to racing in a bed, goodbye anthpo and friends. the memories of what you've done on the internet, and how you shared it will never be forgotten. i hope you have a wonderful life ahead of you.
im ready asf af goodbye gangy
I remember being here since the Perry days and I just got to say the past few years with your content genuinely helped me and always made me laugh. I'll never regret coming across your channel. Thank you for all the amazing content you've put out and I hope your future endeavors are successful and bring you joy the same way your videos brought joy to me and many others. Best of luck!
Im not ready for this channel to die
You'll always be one of the best creators out there, never forget that.  Thank you for all Anthony. (●•◡•●)❤ <333
I have been watching since the video of the flying car which isn’t even on the channel anymore and thank you Anthony for all the great laughs you have spread with both your friends and the internet
I’ll miss you for sure,what a great 2 years it’s been 😔 😢
I knew this was coming up but I didn’t expect it to be so soon. I’m wishing good luck for his future and I’m definitely gonna come back rewatching these videos.
Thank you for giving us fun videos, i wish the best fo you
Thank you anthpo
Thank you for all the wonderful content over the years! It was truly fascinating and inspiring to watch!
Damn, it's over. That's crazy. What a ride though, and you've made enough memories to last you a lifetime. I'm sure we'll all appreciate if you decide to come back, not consistent uploads but any random uploads here and there, whatever you're willing to make we'll be grateful to watch.
Goodbye Anthpo 07
your channel has influenced me to enjoy the little things in life, to let go of the seriousness every once in a while and embrace the oddities that come along my way (and sometimes be the oddity myself). I've been here since your high school perry days and it's been such an honour to be able to come along with you on your journey and watch you grow up.   thank you, anthony, for everything. we'll miss you, but just know that all of you are rooting for you, whatever you decide to do. <3
Do drugs rn or I unsub
Thank you Anthony for letting us beeing part of a small snippet of your life. I rly appreciate that and just wish you the best in life <3. You made me laugh on my baddest days. maybe just not only me. Perhaps more people. So the last I can say is only: Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.
I’ve been watching your content for years and I still can’t believe the countdown is finally over… thank you for all of your work Anthony !! good luck with your future endeavors and thank you for making us smile for all these years ❤️
It was a great four years, I won’t forget you! Congratulations on graduating!

I just wanna know if the fat yoshi is still under the vending machine or not😢
Thank tou Anthony for all the fun and exciting videos about your life and just having fun. We'll definitely miss you for real and congratulations on graduating!❤❤
Thank you for this journey. I am a high school graduate, although in my country it is a bit different then in the US. You accompanied me when I was in both good and bad mood, your content always brightened my life. I said to myself: I want to do same shit when I am in college as you. I hope my dream would come true and I wish you all the best in life right now. Something ends, something starts, I am sure you will find yourself. Once again, THANK YOU!
thank you for sharing your precious memories with us! I'm really sad cuz it ended but I'm also happy that it happened, I'm happy for you! I hope you have a great life from now anthony!!
No matter what you do, even if you never reveal ur face to the public again and we never hear from you again, I hope you suceeed and do your best no matter where you go. Thank you for the fun man.

thank you so much anthony for the amazing content!! you’ve made me laugh so much. i’ll miss you and your friends!!!
More channels need to end like this this is a true showing of how a youtube channel can be more akin to a movie with a resolute ending thank you for the years of content
I can't believe I started with the Perry the Platypus High School video, look where we ended up!  Thank you guys for letting us be a part of your College journey, and I wish you guys the best. Thanks Anthony.  P.S. Please Don't delete your channel, keep your videos on here to preserve your history.
I will do my best to live my story you just carry on doing what’s best for you mate

goodbye
The counter reached 0, goodbye Anthony, i'm going to miss you.
Thanks man! I am grateful to the first moment that I saw you on youtube giving yoshi photos to others until here. You were a really good creator.
so janice and anthpo are a thing?
Thanks Anthony. To many more great memories
first watched you wear a perry the platypus onesie to high school, now seeing the end of this channel with a montage of this channel's shenanigans, glad i was able to be here on this journey and i hope my life will be as hectic in this way! o7
Thankyou for all the laughs we’ve had together ❤️
Thanks. I wish it could be longer, but thank you nonetheless. This channel was fun.
What an amazing journey, from fat yoshis to one of the most touching and memorable friendships I have ever seen, I’ll miss these kind of video Anthony.
I'll miss this.
About to go to university in 2 years and... honestly man Anthony, u have given me the motivation to make sure I live my life the fullest when I go for university..... been hell of a 2 years watching these goofy videos ❤
aw man now im sad
"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened." - Dr. Seuss
I discovered your channel just about a month ago, yet I never thought I'd grow this attached this quickly. You've shown me how to 'live my story' and I will do it. Thank you for everything, we love you and best of luck for the future!
Thank you Anthpo o7
We will miss you anthony. Thank you for everything. We all love you.  ;(
Goodbye Anthony! Thank you for everything ❤
Thank you!
Crazy how i’ve been watching Anthpo since freshmen year highschool and i’m a senior now. Love you Anthpo
Thank you for the funny sht you've shown us for these two years, the fond memories you've made, made us happy too 🎉🎉
aight cya
Man this vid nearly made me tear up, but it was nice while it lasted man have a great one.
Congrats on your graduation and thank you for everything
SOMEBODY SOMEBODY SOMEBODY SOMEBODY CAN AAAANNNNYYYYYBODY FIND MEEEEEEEEEEEE SOMEBODY TOOOOO LOOoooOooOooOoooooOooooooOOOOOVEEEE
I feel sad about myself. Cause my college life never will be this amazing
there goes my hero!
I LOVE YOU TONY P ❤️
congratulations and goodbye anthpo❤wish you the best in life.
I can't express all emotions in this comment, but thank you for these amazing 4 years of gorgerous content! Good luck on your future projects!
damn.
i started watching your videos when both you and i were in high school and now you have graduated college (and i am about to graduate too) where the fuck does time fly.. thank you for everything <3
I've never gotten around to comment on videos and as a student, life also has gotten busy for me throughout the years following you - with its ups and downs. Lately more downs because that'sjust how life is. Your videos brought back something YouTube was lacking and it's always been fun to watch you and your friends just fucking around with silly ideas and having a good time. I do admire everybody's creativity in all of this... It's sad to see you go despite knowing the day would come eventually. But all good things come to an end. Ngl, the last videos were some sort of try not to cry challenge to me (I failed). Thanks anthpo for having been around and for sharing your memories with us! I'll revisit the videos every now and again.
Like they say in Chinese 😞, say no nah rah Anthony-sun.
❤
Thank you for everything Anthony, I'm not ready to say goodbye, but I guess this is it, wish you the best!
And just like that he’s gone, the youngest content creator I’ve known since he blew up with yoshi and now he’s gone before even the oldest YouTubers, crazy stuff man. Love your stuff Anthony, everyone’s lives will be different but I hope ours can have just as many good memories as yours has at such a young age
Ну пока, ок
✌️
Honestly Im not ready to say goodbye, you were one of the few youtubers, where I would watch every single video the moment they were out. So im def gonna miss that but nonetheless I wish you a happy life and im looking forward to seeing you live a "normal" life with a "regular" job Love to all of the ACU
Fat yoshi forever! We'll miss you
Love you man! Thank you so much!
"Now it's time to go live yours." I sobbed when I saw this line, your channel has been a million fond memories that I've watched with friends from school and uni, and now as a second year myself, I've realised with a year left till graduation, it's time to live out my own story with the people I love too. You've inspired me so much and lifted me through some tough times, and I'm so glad to have been there watching you. Thank you Anthony - I'll remember you as I go and live out my life too!
I  will miss u anthpo
BAIIIIIII :3
MQN IM CRYINGGGGG
Bye Anthony! We ❤ you! 👋

I don't know who you are , this is my first time coming to your channel.. but seeing someone go inactive (get off their channel) just makes me sad.. All the best to you❤
Glad to have been able to comment on the last one
Wait wtf? I thought there was still like 24 days or something
I only discovered this channel a couple months ago. And now the journey is already over.. I hope you know Anthony that your story and life is an inspiration. I wish you all the luck in the future for whatever you decide to do.  Best of luck on the rest of your amazing journey
Beautiful video!
Thank you for all the amazing content Anthpo it’s been a blast watching your content for 4 years and tho I am very sad that you are leaving all good things must come to an end, good luck to your future endeavors in life and thank you for making mine a little more fun 🫡
Thank you for everything, its been surreal seeing everything happen, good luck.
Ill miss this channel so much, it felt like i graduated with you 😭 ill never forget the first time i stumbled upon your yoshi and perry videos  a long time ago. I fell in love with your humor SRSLY. Thank you and have fun living out your life even outside of youtube man !!!
i personally dont really have a 1000 word essay i can write in here, but i just wanted to say, thank you.
:)
Idek man.. just thank you so much Anthony. For everything. You’re such a big inspiration to everyone you’ve reached. I’m so glad you shared your journey with us. Wishing you all the best in the future !
This will definitely be one of those channels that i watch again and again. Thank you for everything. Byeee 🐈
Have a good life man always loved your content been watching since youre high school days
I started watching from the beginning, when my brother showed me the fat yoshi video. It was nothing short of the funniest thing my 2019 self could have seen. You fell off my radar, when I found it again, and realise you were actually making content that wasn't harassing people.  I have loved watching Anthpo, the Question Crew, and all the memories that you have made while on camera.  This may be the last time you upload, but I can be sure that it will not be the last time your successful in life. Congratulations Anthpo, congrats on everything you have done in these 4 years.
Y'know i dont comment much and i know i'm like 10 hours late but i just wanna say were gonna miss you man no matter where you choose to be in life we'll support you all the way stay cool man
The internet people of the internet will definitely miss you, I also hope you'll sue Nickelodeon for copying your incredible Avatar series sometime in the future, they truly did you dirty, anyways, this channel will definitely be remembered as one of the channels of all time, thank you for the laughs, thank you for the memories, and good luck in the things you'll pursue in life, so long
man just stubled upon this guy  . and felt like skipping to the end of a entire show
:(
Take care man have a great life brother its been a really fun and happy two years i hope you get to where you want to go goodbye
Good Bye 😭😭😢😢
We are all going to miss your videos, content and laughs! I hope your next path will be awesome!
I think I speak for the millions of people that you've made smile when I say, Thank you Anthony <3. We love you and wish you the best for your extremely bright future
Ill miss you Anthony!
Godspeed you magnificent bastard. May you find incredible success in whatever path you choose.
This has been such a good 2 years, and it has really helped me mentally, so, thank you Anthony.
Goodbye, collegiate youtuber
Thank you Anthony , it was a beautiful journey and I wish you the best for your future !
Thanks anthpo.. because of you.. im starting to try and have more fun in life. Im graduating middle school! Thanks for everything..
You really shouldnt stop making content you are soo creative and have a huge audience. even if its not the same kinda thing you should carry on even if its on a new channel. Whatever you do its been a fun few years and good luck with whatever you decide to do now you are done with collage
Like a lot of other people here, I don’t think I can leave this video without leaving a comment. I just wanted to say thank you, Anthony you are one of the most geuine and real creators too be on this platform having hilarious funny videos too brighten our days but they come with a message to live life and too make the most out of the situation you are in to concentrate on the things that you are truly passionate about regardless what others think you have giving us so many life lessions that i'm going to take moving forward i started a youtube channel because that's what i always wanted to do but i didn't have the confidence in myself  but after watching you and taking you advice to heart i decided to go for it thank you for everything i hope you can find happiness in whatever you decide to do next because you gave 1.65M people so much happiness over these past 4 years
I hope i find these kind of friendships one day :)
A few years ago, I was spending the last couple days with a class I'd spent years with and could almost honestly call a second home. I was manning the computer because that's what I do, one of the students requested to watch Phineas and Furb, the teacher said she'd think about it. Then, and idea popped into my head, "Wouldn't it be really funny if I showed them the perry the platypus guy?". I was always the quiet kid who didn't really do anything to stand out, but I wanted this time to be different. I looked around and saw that literally none of my friends were in class so I hesitated, but I thought to myself that Anthpo probably went to school the very next day after he did some of his wacky antics, and he was proud of it. So, I stepped out of my comfort zone a little and showed the class your video, they loved it, even the teacher :D  That wasn't even the last time, by watching these videos, I kinda realized that to experience life to it's fullest, you need to get out of your comfort zone. So that's what I wanna do from now on, when you can't do it "for me". I encourage others to do the same, this isn't fiction, you can do it too. Many hopes for the future of you and your friends, Anthony.
Thank for being a cool guy! A reminder that all it takes to be cool is to love the people around you and loving the time you have :). Ur gonna fosho feel a type of way when you rewatch these as you get older xD
It was a fun journey while it lasted, and im glad to have been apart of it. Good luck anthony!!
thank you anthony for these great videos over the years and good luck for later in life. see you!
Even though I haven't been around for long on this channel it still feels weird to see you leave.
Thank you Anthony. I used to watch you since the fat yoshi videos when I was in middle school, and now Im almost a senior. Your videos never fail to make me laugh or entertained. We will miss you so much, wish you nothing but great success and for the best. Take care always and goodluck in your next journey!
The good ending
I'm unable to say goodbye yet, but I will have to eventually, we'll miss you and we appreciate you anth.
it's been really cool seeing you grow through all these years, have a good one
Thanks for all the laughs and smiles you've put accross my face, you guys are great

WAIT ANTHONY AND JANICE DATED/ARE DATING 9idk the relationship status sorry) HUH!?!?! also amen for the queen song my fav ever too best of wishes for you anthony i hope you have the best life and if you still poost on other mediums it would be great to see it!!! have fun post college
so many laughs to never be forgotten
<3
bro really ended the channel with essentially "go outside bro"
this is how you end a youtube channel   it’s like tv shows like gravity falls and avatar the last air bender, we may want to see more, but deep down we know that it’s better to end the series with a great conclusion than to watch it die a slow death. Thank you, Anthpo, for letting us be apart of this journey. I wish you and all your friends the best of luck with wherever your life takes you.
one of the most legendary youtubers ever- you've been so influential to me through the years and i'm happy you get to end this journey the way you chose (even if i'll miss you). much love <3
THANK YOU!  Your Avatar series is one of the best skit I have seen anywhere.
Thank you anthony for sharing your life story, and im happy to see how much youve taken your college life to the fullest. :) your videos really made me laugh Ill be graduating highschool this year!! Im sort of sad to say goodbye to my highschool life but I think im ready to also go through the college life to experience the highs and lows. (Wish me luck >_<)   Go on and live your life with no regrets. Your channel will always stay somewhere in my heart :)
Love you man, loved everything you did, you made my days a lil happier than they were, so thank you man.  Hope you have a great life❤
We’re gonna miss you dude thanks for everything
Thank you sir
love you Anthony 💖

I found your channel just a couple weeks ago, and I'm gonna miss you a lot. So, goodbye anthpo, and thank you for all the laughs and genuinely wholesome vibes you managed to put into my life in such a short time. I really hope you and your friends continue living fulfilling and happy lives.
thank you for this amazing journey
good luck w everything!
THANK YOU SO MUCH ANTHONY!!!! WE WILL MISS YOUR AMAZING CONTENT
Because of your videos i get to live vicariously through a crazy, fun, and wholesome american college life. Thanks for the memories and being a fellow gen-z trying to redefine the meaning of youth as our generation navigates out of quarantine. Wishing you the best for your future endeavors, anthpo 👊
Goodbye Anthony Anthpo. It's been quite the ride. Thanks for all the laughs and entertainment, and I wish you the best in your future endeavors.
I stared watching these back in year 11 and now im about to leave college , what a great adventure its been, good luck out there anthony!
bye
damn
When I first watched this video it was so surreal. I didn't process it all that well. Fast foward now I rewatched it and I am in tears. I had been following since fat yoshi 2 days but only really fell in love with the channel during the graduation countdown days maybe it is because I had just started college and I was at the lowest pt on my life and simultaneously the highest. Your vids had me genuinely smiling for the entire duration. (so much so my face began hurt for the longer vids). From the bottom of my heart thank you Anthpo,Hanbon,Henry,Janice, Abhi, Ankit,Paige,Kieran,Enzo,Zoe,Gavin, James and the rest of the ACU. Congratulations on graduating!
This was such a fun journey to follow, thank you Anthpo, and the best of luck in wherever you end up next
It's been a hell of a ride Thanks, man
Good bey

This is like watching the finale of a show that you've been watching for so long. We'll miss you Anthpo, best of luck to your future endeavours.
No amount of words can describe how much you, your friends, and your channel mean to people. So thank you, thank you for living your life and thank you for inspiring people to live theirs too 🩷

I'm gonna miss you man. your content was insanely entertaining to watch and its a shame to see you go but I'm glad you accomplished so much. Take care of yourself man stay safe.

ily
Thank you so much for taking us though this awesome journey. I’m quite literally speechless… I remember the first time I came across your content, you were in a lobster costume and I thought it was the funniest thing ever, now I am watching you take your leave and starting another chapter in life. It was a real treat, Anthony, and I only have undying hope for you and the amazing people you’ve met along the way to thrive in the future. I will admit that I will miss this channel, but it puts a smile on my face knowing you’re living, growing bigger and better each day. You guys are going to go so far, and I wish you the best. <3
Thank you for everything. And congrats on graduating!!
BRO YOU SO COOL I’LL MISS I love you. . 😘
Ill be waiting on that reunion video
GG King
Like most folks commenting I was also a part of the silent majority but I couldn’t go without leaving a comment. Your videos and outlook on life and friendship have inspired me so much - enough so to start creating my own videos, not for a youtube channel, but just to document some of the best years of my life with my friends and family. If anyone ever asks me what inspired me to do so, I always send them your way. Thanks for everything Anthpo :)
Congrats!! 🥰
amazing stuff bro.
i just cried.
I’m a Junior in highschool. I’m scared for where life and school will take me, but I know I want to live like you did in college. Congrats ❤️
Bye you are out anyway
I have to say, thank you Anthony for creating a super creative and fun environment for others to enjoy. It’s been a blast seeing this channel grow since my college freshman year and I really am going to miss waking up to another one of your videos posted. Enjoy life to the fullest, go explore the world and thank you for being you 💙
Who are you tho
thank you anthony, for everything.  goodluck with the rest of ur journey, and say hi to tony p for me.
Thank you for everything
Thankyou for all the good vibes
Thank you Anthony. Through you and your channel I managed to make friends that I still hold close to me by watching your videos. I would never have bonded with those amazing people if it wasn’t for you.
Thank you
Thank you Anthony
Thank you man i been watching your video since high school❤ i still remember that time
I have too much to say so I'll just say thank you for the endless amazing entertainment you served up through out the years🖤
Good bye mah bruddah, I'll always remember the memories
Thank you for everything, Anthpo and friends! We love you all! <3
thank you
i started watching at 1.7k and i remember thinking “wow this guy is so underrated how does he not have more”. and now, you’re at 1.6M- almost 1000000x more. i’ve loved being able to share a little part of your life for these years you’re a joy man
Man anthony your such a inspiration!
Wow
I can't wrap my head around the fact that it's all over now. I knew that this day would eventually come but it still hurts to see you go. Goodbyes are never easy, especially this one. Thank you again, Anthony.
I'll miss ur goofy yet funny video, bye.
Antpho you're gonna make me cry
I hope you live an amazing life Anthony, thank you for entertaining everyone that watched your videos.
I’m going to pee your pants for this
You were an inspiration of all and were glad we got to see your memories go by with you. Goodbye.
Thank you Anthony. I was already past college when I found your channel. College unfortunately was the worst time of my life, and I’d never go back. But watching your videos was in some way a little healing. Your joy is infectious. We lived vicariously through your videos. Thank you for all the fun and laughter you’ve brought to us. All the best to you in your bright future ahead.
Sobbing
Ending it all
Your videos will forever bring comfort and joy, thank you Anthony ❤
I’m kinda new but was this channel only to make content while he was in college?
😭😭😭
Thank you Anthpo. I could write a ton about how this made me feel like all the others have, but I'll just keep it short. Thank you.
Goodbye Anthony I have many memories of this great YouTube channel and it's amazing content over the past couple of years and good luck with your future I'm sure you won't let us down
Well... I guess its time to say goodbye🥹. I wish you the best for your future ❤️
he just deletes youtube never opens it again
thank you for everything, man. i would watch your "every episode of adventure time" series over and over for hours on end and i've just loved watching the content you've put out. grateful for everything you've done, you're an inspirational, creative, funny and charismatic guy. wishing you the best for the next part of your life, live it well. thank you for everything :D
Thank you Anthony for all the great content. I loved your videos and they helped me through I won’t say a dark time but times when I just felt bad. Your videos bring me and many others comfort and joy, though I understand why you have to leave so. On the behalf of many others we’ll miss you. Thank you Anthpo. ❤
As a wise man once said   *“Every good thing is got an end”*
What a journey 🥰
Been watching since the Perry the Platypus days, thank you for the good times. Wishing you an amazing future 🙂
CAM SOME1 PLEASE EXPLAIN IM SO CONFUSED
Thank you for the years, Anthony.  Best of success down the road and see you next time.
*Yoshi sadness noise  -love you anthony
Wow. It’s been an honor growing up with you and witnessing these beautiful moments you’ve created for the people you’re surrounded by. Truly one of the most sincere and most inspiring humans on this platforms and probably my overall favorite creator. Hope the next part of your journey treats you well anthpo. It was a pleasure to be a part of the ride 😭😭
Goodbye, thank you for giving us great content
I’ve been here since the Yoshi pics and I’ve been hooked ever since. Congratulations on graduating and thank you for all the laughs
Had a great time watching the journey
thank you Anthony for everything. you have made this community's lives so much brighter and happier. i wish the best for you and your future. thanks for all the laughs <3
The end of an era
FALL IN LOVE⁉️⁉️⁉️
was here for 1 or two weeks... still sad
from one stranger on the internet to another, im so fucking happy for you man
good luck anthony and friends! thanks for keeping my 2 and 1/2 years less miserable :D
“The key to immortality is first living a life worth remembering.”    There’s no doubt that you Anthony are nothing short of an inspiration.  You may say you’re not but you are.  An inspiration for truly enjoying life regardless of what others will think.  To cherish the people closest to you in your life. Whatever happens here on this channel or beyond, I hope you don’t stop living the way you have been for the past few years.  Your journey on YouTube may have ended.  But the world has so much more left for you to do.  It’s been an absolute pleasure watching your content.  I hope to carry on life with the same passion and appreciation as you have.
I have math in 2 minutes and I’m bawling, I’m gonna miss you and I hope you have a great life. ❤ ily Anth
Goodbye anth. We loved the journey <3
Idek when I found you Anthony. Like idek. I know it was around highschool maybe or not? Idk I just know I’m 21. I’m about to be a senior in college and your vids helped me laugh and in low points and the high points it felt like I always had friends somewhere randomly across the internet at Rutgers university named Anthpo and Co. you niggas were just so funny and also truthful and honest and I loved every second of it. I think I know what I wanna do with my life but rn just hoping I made the right choice, and Ik you’re wondering that too. But Ik you’ll do just fine bro. Trust. I had a feeling you were gonna quit but it’s sucks a bruh. I don’t wanna cal it quitting so let’s say a fitting and satisfying conclusion. I saw a vid yesterday that said Steve Carrell didn’t get his “big break” on the Office until 42! 42!! That’s literally 21 more years from now. What I’m trying to say is that it’s ok if you don’t know what you want to do yet or if your dreams don’t immediately come true, but it’s never to late to give up because one day they will come true. Good luck wherever life takes you Anthony. I hope you keep your kindness and people skills because I think that’s what’s going to get you far in life. You always wanna make people laugh and help realize there’s more to life then just being sad. That’s like me. We both just want to make people laugh and we always silly wnd joking and making jokes so people can laugh when times are stressful. In simple terms, we keep life fun and simple for people, and I hope the biggest message you’ve sent your fan base, is to be yourself because if you be yourself then look at all the great things you’ll accomplish, and I think this YouTube channel is a great reflection of that dedication and hard work and shows how being yourself can lead so far. You wanted us to know that and now your vids will be used as just that. A memory and a way for everyone, even you, to watch and laugh and just remember the times you spent. Im going to miss you but I’m also glad. Because this is just another bandaid we had to rip off, but it wouldn’t feel this bittersweet, this sad, if it wasn’t the most fun and most enjoyable experience everyone one of your lives and your fan base.
You're awesome man, hope you do well in your life <3
You’ve got a real good heart Anthony. Thank you for opening it up to us. Your friends are so lucky to have you ❤
I wasn't here for long but I loved watching his content and I wish.. I WISH i could've found his channel way before 2 months ago but I can't really reverse time before those 2 months I was hopeless didn't know what to do but here I feel so happy that I was able to find your channel before it ended. Thank you Anthony for making me smile I hope you have a great life :)
Thanks anthpo for so much. i enjoyed watching your channel so much and i hope that you for the best videos that i have watched in my life
Truely the end of an era, the anthpo era. Started watching your videos when you were still in highschool and now you have graduated college. I know that you will do many great things in the future so I say goodbye.
Thank u Anthony
I didn’t think I was meant for college for so long, or that I didn’t deserve it, or that I wasn’t fun or smart or motivated enough to stay there. Finding your channel gave me a window into the good parts of what college could be like, and made it a more realistic goal. And I made it! I’m going this fall!  No matter how late it is! Thank you so much for helping me get here ❤
3.14159265358979 keep reciting the digits of pi guys and when we reach the end of it he might return
I miss you already and wish you the best!
Thank you for all the content you managed to put out,it was an amazing two years just watching the channel grow,from harassing kids as perry to making a whole poop group,it’s insane what you’ve managed to do with your friends,congrats on graduating! I hope you and your friends can live your lives to the fullest :)
Good luck in your life. Anthpo, if you read this, what advice would you give to someone who's going to uni in 2 years?
Bye bye 👋
The amount of joy I feel watching this, the yearning I feel to experience what you have experienced. The nostalgia it invokes of past experiences and the hope for myself to share future experiences. Anthpo, I want to live like you.
I did not prepare for this day, but.. thank you anthony.
❤❤😭😭😊😊
Thanks you Anthony. I found your channel when you were running in your high school dressed as Perry and wow, your channel just grow so faster. Your videos have meant a lot for me through this years, you and your friends (Hanbon, Janice, Henry...) just help me a lot with my social anxiety. I hope you guys can have a great future after the college and do everything you want. Ily Po,, thanks for all this adventures, we will always remember you. Goodbye Anthony <3
Anthony, it’s been a legitimate honor to have you share four years of your life. You’re one of the people who has really hooked me to watch these vlogs, I cannot believe my first exposure to you was you dressed as Perry The Platypus harassing people, then to coming back to your channel to the Avatar. Thank you for the many laughs, and tears. Godspeed Anthpo
L bozo
It’s funny, the compulsion to leave a tiny little mark on a little piece of history in your life. So here I am, adding to the pile of comments. Words that’ll get lost and forgotten, but will never be truly erased. Thank you, Anthony, for the years of smiles and laughs. Thank you for the glimpse of light in dark times, the inspiration in lows, and the nudge to reflect on all the wonders of my own life I should cherish. I’m so proud of you :) live well ❤
I've been a casual watcher until recently when ive actually started watching all of your videos and it feels sad I didn't watch you sooner because I love all of your videos and I know other people also agree. Goodbye Anthony, you helped me fill the paul shaped hole in my paul shaped heart
I will miss Perry the platypus messing around in college
I dont even know what to say like this is so sad TT. this weird guy was so fun too watch and was such an inspiration and I'm definitely gonna miss this
I think the thing that got me to your channel was Perry the Platypus outfit during your high school years and I feel honored to be part of this and to witness it. I hope and wish you luck wherever you go next in life! :}
See ya man ! Have a good and beautiful time at life !
CONGRATULATIONS 🎊 👏 💐 🥳
Cya
thank you so much anthpo you've made us laugh so many times and I'm so grateful that you've been able to share your experiences with us. Thank you.
Thanks for everything Anthony, your videos has always been a joy to watch. But more importantly would be ur attitude towards life and how you tackle it everyday, being able to do what you love while being so caring towards others. Truly and inspiration for me to follow, and hopefully I could follow ur outlook of school life, and be able to make the most out of it. You are really such an amazing person and hope you know that too!
Ty for the memories men, this 4 years were an amazing ride for sure. Ty for being part of our lifes

That Somebody To Love bit was absolutely incredible, we’ll be seeing you, Anthony
it was about 4 years ago, when i was just starting high school, when i found your channel and now im graduating, its been a ride, sadly we wont see everyone together again, but i hope everyone does well in the future!!
i’m crying so much and for what? I’m gonna miss this channel sm but it’s good that he can go now and live his life without the pressures of the internet
All good things must come to an end.  You are probably one of the funniest content creators I've ever seen.  It's been a lot of fun and I wish you the best of luck in whatever you decide to do in the future.  Goodbye Anthony.
Goodbye
Today, I am watching the final video of Anthpo, and for the years to come I will return to watch the final video of Anthpo.  Right now I'm watching it on the day it's over. Wow.
Thank you, Anthony. And Godspeed! o7

I just recently found you and damn I’m so sad you will go but I h know you will great things to this world!
Nooo!  I didn't want this day to come.. You could make so many different forms of vlogs and content outside of school related videos dude!  You can do so much more dont limit yourself to school content!
was hoping he was gonna pull something like its the end of "this" channel but there will be a second
I just found your channel for the first time. I am a college student, going into my final year. Teared up watching this, I am going to graduate next year and its going to feel just like this. I know it. Man, so inspirational. Best of luck with whatever you do from here. Mad respect,

I started watching you from the haikyuu video and Im glad the youtube algorithm shared with me your channel. I genuinely enjoyed all your videos and while I am sad you're going Im glad I was here for the wild ride. Damn never thought I'd get emotional from a white guy sharing his college experience.
thanks, Anthony ❤
A chapter has ended. Good luck on the next one,goodbye Anthony live your best goddam life❤
Thank you, Anthony. For all the laughs and entertainment. Your videos have also encouraged me to be better, enlightened me, and just shaped me to be better. I’ll miss your silly little adventures, simple or outright insane. I’ll always be happy to hear that you’re returning to content creation, whether it’s because you’re desperate for cash, bored, or passionate about it. Just be you and I wish you and the gang the best throughout all of your future endeavors. Goodbye.  (P.S. i said to myself “i’m just gonna type a short little “Goodbye” and here I am in tears. LOVE YOU ANTHONY)
Welp I'm entering college. Thanks for the memories Anthpo. I love you guys, and I thank you for all the giggles and shits you gave me.
It’s been a good run
I know anthpo probably won't see this, but from the bottom of my heart I just wanna say thank you. Its incredible to see how the channel has grown and the community its created. And especially, thank you for just making the day a little brighter when you upload. Wishing you all the best for the future and this next chapter.
Goodbye Anthony 🥲
Goodbye Anthony 🥲
I honestly only found your channel a couple of weeks ago, but in this short video it's obvious you've had an amazing time with this channel. I wish you the best.
ive been watching this channel for a while, and its been one of my go to's whenever i need a fun video :"). its sad to see you go, but i wish you the best in whatever it is you'll do next :D!! you did amazing :")
Thank you. Goodbye.
Real
Thank you so much for all the great videos and sharing the bits of your life with us, we will never forget you Anthony!
Bye its been a good one
I can't believe this is happening. Watching the number of days left go down started being sadder and sadder as it reached zero. Now, someone could say; Our time has run out. But no. We had a great time laughing at your videos and smiling even through hardest of days. I hope you have a great and long life, Anthony, and I hope you cherish every moment. You taught me to do the same. I'll still be subscribed. I wanna rewatch every single video.
Thank you so much for sharing your stories with us, I hope you and your friends the best in your futures!
thanks anthony
Sad to see you go even if u reminded us every day of this
Thanks for everything you've done and posted, it's really inspired me to keep going and to try more things. You made college seem less scary coming from someone who is about to start their college career in the fall. Watching you grow as I grew and changed made life a little easier so thank you and I wish you well on your future endeavors!
thank you for everything :))
A true legend you’ll be missed
Thanks Anthony for the past few years! Your videos have been always a pleasure to watch and never failed to to put a smile on my face. All the best in whatever you do!
Thank you for giving us the best content throughout the years. Thank you.

good ending. hope they ,make an anime adaptation of this great film.
Joined late but so glad to be here❤🎉
Thank you anthony, i can’t believe it’s already over
Goodbye Anthony 😢
Thanks
Этот канал сделал меня счастливее.
I remember years ago I found a video of a silly guy giving out pictures of fat yoshi.  And today I'm watching that silly guy grown up and enjoying life.  I don't know why seeing a stranger on the Internet being happy and going out of his way to enjoy life makes me so happy. But it makes me want to go out of my way to do those things and try new opertunities.  Your videos made me so happy and I'm sad to see them gone. But I just want to say that I'm so proud of you. And I hope you enjoy your life beyond YouTube.
W human
<3
Thanks a lot for bringing us on your journey!!!
i am so sad
Thank you for everything anthpo
damn
It's sad to say goodbye but it's been a hell of a ride and i couldn't ask for more
Good bye anthpo I am gonna miss you.
Thanks for the 4 yrs man
any kind of graduation video always makes me cry. any kind of goodbye video makes me cry. i think i discovered anthpo while surfing thru my recommended in mid quarantine, i havent watched in a while, but its upsetting to say goodbye to channels that made me laugh. we thank you very very much for filming your journey with us, your moments of having fun, etc. happy graduation man
Hey king before you leave, 👑 here you dropped this
been with you since perry, gonna miss you lots 🫶
Fucking crying
Thank you, and goodbye.
Thanks 🤍
your videos inspired me to be who i am today and have helped me a great deal, love you and goodbye anthpo
Thank you <3
It's been an incredible experience to watch this channel and  I'm so grateful that I'm alive in the time period of this channel tysm Anthony  and I wish u luck on whatever it is your doing in life.
Thanks man, as some that also just graduated its weird how fast time flies. I wish you luck with future endeavors!
I'm not someone who comments in general but I feel like I need to, even tho it will do and contribute nothing. I have been here since the harassing with Yoshi pictures and dressing up as Perry the Platypus videos etc. era if I remember correctly,  and boy hasn't it been a long time. Your channel was so wholesome at times, yet so chaotic. I assume you did this to archive your college life (I don't want to be wrong or assume wrong so, correct me if I'm wrong) and you did it perfectly. Your sheer amount of randomness and willpower to continue what you started it is mindblowing. You even risked your life trying to see a ghost in a haunted house, are u okay :((, okok  getting off topic lmao lemme continue seriously. Your channel has been in my top 3 fav channels, if not 1st because it makes me see the warmth of friendship. This video was a bittersweet ending to such a good channel but,  all good things must come to an eventually. Thank you for all you have done. Have a good rest of your life.
i discovered this channel like three months ago and its already over
Bye
Good bye Anthony, thanks for the videos :) especially the perry the platypus ones
Ahh. Shit :( well it was coming and thank you for the best four+ years of my life
Will miss you anthpo <3
“But how do I say goodbye”
Thank you for making me less scared for college :)
thank you Anthony for the awesome videos, I only have been watching for a month but this past month you have truly shown me that I just need to go out and make the most of my life, and to not care what anyone else thinks,  I plan to take everything you have shown here and apply it to my life, so thank you, you truly feel like a close friend of mine and I am grateful for that, even if it was only a month long😅.
goodbye anthony <3
I remember seeing the senior graduation video during my freshman year of high school. Now I'm a freshman in college, and you're graduating from college. Thanks for the laughs.
Thank you for making me laugh during the roughest four years of my life. I’m graduating too next week and I’m getting ready to start the next chapter in my life. Watching your videos made me feel a lot less alone and it always made my day when you guys uploaded a video. Goodbye. I’ll miss you guys. Congrats on graduating!
You will always be remembered as the Perry the platypus onesie guy! We will miss you man thank you for the entertainment!
Thank you Anthony. We wish you all the best going forward and thank you for all the laughs you've shared with us along the way. We'll miss you, take care ❤
bruh this like to view ratio is crazy
Thank you!
It’s been a wild ride glad to have taken part from Phat Yoshi to K-Pop it’s been a a great journey
The combination of that beautiful montage showcasing his growth and those last lines of the video hit so damn hard. I remember first finding the fat yoshi video in my last year of middle school and now I graduate high school in less than a month. Time really does fly and the memories and moments are what we get to cherish for a lifetime. Thank you Anthpo for your channel and a glimpse into your life, it’s been one hell of a ride
thank you for every laugh, smile and giggle over the years you have been on this platform. Your channel was a constant in my life, a place where I could go to laugh when I felt down, a place to feel like I belonged when I didn't feel like I belonged anywhere and most important to me a place where I could always go. Though it will be sad to see you go I wish you the best of luck in your future career, friendships and life. thank you for giving me and many others a chance to be part of your life, to be part of a community and something greater than our own lives. Once again, thank you and goodbye ٩(ˊᗜˋ)و
anthpo I remember dying laughing at your videos from 1mts, especially the acronyms video. ever since, I have loved watching your content and the hilarious videos you make. thanks for providing some amazing entertainment, and best of luck in your future endeavors!
:) o7
Thank you so much for all the laughs you've given us when we were feeling sad
Anthony will never quite understand the huge impact he’s had on every single viewer.
This is my first time stopping by on any of your videos (thanks YouTube for the super random recommendations) and the title of this video is honestly what made me click and watch it - no expectation whatsoever. It just feels a bit odd that the first thing I had to watch from your channel is for you to say goodbye. So goodbye, I guess 🥺
The video conversation with your dad made me cry. I remember having a very similar conversation with my mom. I was worried about the same sort of stuff.  The power of friendship slogan is funny, but the best part of the videos is you, Anthpo. It's fun to watch the goofy shit with your friends, but that's not what makes the content great. You are so genuine and human and relatable and kind. With your past video, I don't think there will ever be another creator like you. The level of vulnerability you express through your videos is so impressive and brave. I hope you read through these comments and enjoy the impact you've made on so many. This is beyond shitty views and numbers. Thank you.
Goodluck!
Nooooooooooo
Thank you very much for everything Anthpo. You and your friends were the best.
Thanks for all the amazing vids
As someone who has been watching the channel since your high school days, I cannot leave this video without a comment. Thanks, Anthony, for sharing your experiences with me and the rest of the internet im 2 years younger than you and I feel like I grew up alongside you and your content. Overall, I'm just happy I discovered your channel. Thanks for giving me more joy in my life by watching your silly videos and your success.
My first time commenting. I'll miss you bro.
I remember watching your high school graduation video when I was just starting high school. That video was the sole reason I realized how important it was to keep a record of these important moments that I've shared with people, and do everything within my power to make life meaningful and fun. Now I've just started college, and you've graduated. Where did the time go? I know that this collection of words will just be filtered in with the millions of other people's thoughts on the internet, and you may never read this, but you've made a difference in my life. Keep being a beautiful human
What a fucking Journey
I’m not kidding watching your videos have been so amazing and are just so funny, but no really your videos are amazing and i’m grateful that you can just look back on your videos whenever you’re sad, bored, happy or even just worried about doing something.  Anthony Po always remember you have the power of friendship on your side. (ALSO ANIME YOU NERD)
Thanks for making these 4 years memorable This just ab made me cry 😭😭
I know one day on the future i will see my own comment and think "yeah, those were some really good times". Apart from that, I hope life keeps on smiling at you, Anthony, thanks for all the good memories, sport!
Thank you Anthony for making us all laugh. You’ve inspired me as well as many others to get out of their comfort zone and to see the good in people. We’ll miss you but we know that you’re starting a new, even better journey now. ❤
goodbye
we have spent so many years watching and enjoying ur content we will always love u anthpo and we pray that where ever the next chapter of ur life takes u we will support u

Hello Anthpo,  I started watching your videos when you made the Kermit to work video and thought that your videos are so cool that I should just subscribe, and I did. I liked more and more of your content and even bought your 2nd place and Anthpo T-shirts which I don't really like to wear anymore (sorry) but I just wanted to thank you for your amazing videos and wish you the best in life. - Dog with clout goggles
gooby
We gonna miss this
it been a interesting ride but it was amazing best of luck in the future
thank you anthony, i hope life treats you just as well as you did us. love ya
Sad to see but congratulations man, so this is the end for the channel?
Wow, is it really over…?
Well Damn, Don't really have much to say but thanks for the videos man. but apparently I haven't subscribed yet bruh. Guess it's never too late. Thanks again for the laughs.
Goodbye.
Memento mori. Unus Annus.
I think its very fitting that the song is somebody to love, since basically this whole channel was basically Anthony finding people to love.
best of luck anthpo and everyone! follow your passions and make the best out of your life ❤
I hope you have a great time with your life man👍
Good luck Anthony
❤️
Just a reminder, life is faster than you think
I'll be honest, I thought never I watched any of this guy's content until I clicked on this video but then I saw the printed out Yoshi and that random memory came flooding back.🤣
I’ve been a fan since the high school days and this makes me feel old 😢
Goodbye bro :)
Ok but when perry the platypus in college?
What now?
This man truly understood the task of being a "YouTube creator"
yet another V-tuber graduation :,(
Thank you
im not okay
I been watching athpo for years and I don’t want to end
Made it just in time, had to watch the last 2 months of content first and loved it! Congratulations Anthony, you deserve this!
See you soon ❤
I still think this is going to be a prank and po would be back with bunch of videos soon
goodbye
I will never forget anthpo especially Perry the platypus
I started watching when the perry the platypus video was uploaded. During that time, my parents were apart, I’d watch you every weekend when visiting my dad, and these videos got me through SO much. Thank you.
Thanks Anthony for everything
AGAIN?
Thank you for the laughs Anthpo, for the memories and excitement. Hopefully the revenues from YT is able pay off whatever college loans there is, and we all wish you the best of luck. :)
I’ve watched you since 2019 and I just had my last day of Year 13. Once my A-levels are done, that’s it, it’s all up to me now. But watching your videos for the last four years have made me a feel just a little more excited than scared to go into the world now. I know I need to make the most of everything and everyone around me and stop fear from holding me back, so thank you. I truly wish you the best from here.

It's been a fun ride, I'm behind you by 2 years in school, and it was seriously like getting to peek ahead at what life could offer if you take the time to appreciate every moment you have. Even if the journey ends here, the memories will last a lifetime, as well as that sweet sweet ad revenue. Thank you for inspiring me to get out there and make the most of my college experience

cya o7 0:09
Won't be able to listen to somebody to love without think of you now
Its officially Joever...
thank you perry pajama man for amazing content you've given us
i watched you every day before school (Australia timezones). So saying bye and not having something actually fun to watch sucks. But I get it, without college, there is no fun videos with you and all your friends. Goodbye Anthony, Hanbon, Kieran, Collin, Paige, Enzo, Janice, Abhi, Paul and all of the others (I forgot the names woops). And fare well on your life!
👋😢
Goodbye, I joined you channel late, but loved your content. Goodbye again
HAVE FUN IN LIFE HOMIE!!!! WE LOVE YOU!!! <3
I don't want to say goodbye yet but i guess all good things must come to a end, Thank you Anthony for being the goofy guy that we all love.
To think that I will also graduate this year is surprising honestly, man I have been a fan of your channel since 4 years ago. At that time I was also a new student to my highschool and it started bad tho, but I managed to be ok at least. Thank you anthpo, really like I genuinely thank you for the content you make, for the laughs that you've given us. With that being said, Congratulations on Graduating❗❗ and I wish you the best of luck on life❗❗
Thank you so much for the incredible content over the years. You've truly let an impact on all of us <3
Thank you for being inspiration for us all showing that we can still have fun while planning the future, You changed many people opinions about college🎉
It's been a wild ride. Thank you for everything Anthony. o7

Congrats Anthony:)
sad to see you go but happy that i was able to spend this time 'alongside' you. really proud to see you graduate man!!! you will always be my favorite white guy <3
I found the harassing people with yoshi video 4 years ago and I thought it would be a good idea for me to do the same but with Sans on my first day. Needless to say I ended up embarassing myself. Still had a lot of fun and made some friends because of it. I always found light in your videos and have been more inspired to see what life has to offer. This is the first time I'm ever writing something like this to a youtuber so I'm not sure what I can add or say. But truly from the bottom of my heart, thank you for everything.
Thank you for letting us live parts your life Anthpo!  From defending your school as Ben 10 to winning a volleyball tournament in Haikyuu unifroms, The amalgamation of these past few years truly was a journey like no other! Thank you for showing us that being weird and funny is cool. Your college life was like no other, and it feels like a blessing to have been able to view glimpses of it. Best of luck for all your future endeavours!
Thank you Anthony for the most entertaining four years of our lives. I wish you and your friends a wonderful and successful future.
THIS IS LIKE UNUS ANNUS BUT LIKE A WHOLE LOT MORE SADDER
Gonna miss you anthpo
See you later alligator
It's still crazy to me that I watched you go all the way through university almost at the same time as me, and also the fact that you're younger than me haha.
Anthony, you are wholeheartedly the youtuber which has had the most impact on my life. Whatever you do, we're here for you. We love you man. Don't ever stop being the person you are!!!❤
WHAT ABOUT AOT SEASON 4?😢
Congrats and good luck with your future, your videos have comforted me a lot with worries with so many things, especially now with me finishing high school soon, been here since you we’re still in high school and your videos have always been a comfort, wishing you the best to always be the funniest mf in the room
Thank you for the memories!
Thank you Anthony for all that you’ve done. We’ll all miss you so much!! Honestly Anthpo is my biggest inspiration to keep going through high school, because I want to experience this type of friendship🙏
You will always be perry to me brother, rest easy
I'm gonna miss this channel sm, congratulations on graduating, and best of luck going ahead!!! I can't believe 69 days are already over 😭
☹
It's my birthday today, and I will really miss this channel, these kind of videos, and all of you guys.❤
Thanks for being Anthpo these past years, wishing you good luck as Anthony now that it's over
Its crazy how you made your goodbye video a complete celebration of the many years you’ve been on Youtube, and a sad but very congratulatory send off.   I’ll miss you and your content, but I’m also happy for you graduating, and I’m sure you’ll get a great job, and have a good life.   Nice seeing this seemingly small but very important and incredible part of your life, Mr Anthony. Now go have some dessert if you have any, you deserve it.
Haven't watched since 10th grade (almost 3 years ago) but really gonna miss this channel, always felt a sense of relatability to it
Bye dude i will miss anthpo
Thank you for everything Anthony, your Perry the platypus videos made me laugh so much
This is really hard for me to type, because im crying all over the place. Im really happy you’ve found the courage to end the channel you way, and not just let it fizzle out based on content you’re not interested in. This next part is definitely wishful thinking, but I hope you upload at least once every 2 years because I don’t think I could handle myself if I didn’t know you were happy and doing okay. I can’t wait to come back in a few years and rewatch every last video. Good luck in this next chapter of your life, good bye and I want you to know that all 1.65 million of us have been blessed by you. ❤️
I was here since you fucking around in school while wearing a Perry The Platypus pyjama. Very great content, you deserve all the fame you had. Good travels, Anth.
Goodbye
yo he was dating janice⁉️⁉️⁉️
Loved every single one of these videos! THANKYOU ANTHPO
I'll miss the humor you always brought in your videos. Your videos were always unique and brought a smile to my face. Good luck with your future endeavors!
man i remembered when i was in 6th grade i found the yoshi video... and now i'm in freshman year. Thanks anthpo
Hardest watch in a while thx for the videos 🫡
I'm not crying you are. Jokes aside, thank you so much for those years, I wish you the best
Thank you Anthony. For the last two years I have been watching your content while in my last year in high school to my first year in college and you’ve always put a smile on my face. I’m wishing you nothing but the best in the future, i guess this is goodbye :)
I’ll miss this anthpo fella, been watching ever since he started… favorite video is the bring your kermit to school day vid ❤
Goodbye. Brother Anthony <3 Best of wishes in wherever life takes you. See ya on the otherside.
Don't cry because its over, smile because it happened
Thank you so much for sharing your life with us. It’s been amazing, and sadly, as they say: all good things must come to an end. I wish you the best!
Thank you Anthpo, for all the amazing content and times that you shared to us;  I remember first finding your videos through your Avatar: the last airbender  series (back when I was obsessed with it) and it so sad to see you say goodbye, but i guess it is time for all of us to go make our own stories after watching you and your friend's for so long  Thank you <3
I know everyone is saying this, but as you finish your journey on one thing. I'm starting fine. Thank you for being there when I needed inspiration for high school. Now im in college and I'ma do my best lving my life. thank you and have fun on your journey !!
Congrats Anthony on graduating  These 2 years had it's up and down  congrats on making it :))
Can you learn really made me laugh more than some of my oldest friends, I wish you the best of luck in life. But maybe make a video every once in a while I still need some good laughter. I hope you’re very successful in life and I wish you the best, thank you for making laugh during the hardest times in my life. I will never forget you.
It is crazy to watch considering I also just graduated college.  2 completely different college experiences. Pretty interesting to see, but I wish I had a friend group so willing to do random stuff though.
Woah I literally just started watching his videos - can't believe he's saying goodbye!  Does someone know if he's always had the College graduation cut-off for his YT channel?
Thanks for all the laughs Anthpo, your wacky ideas have given me inspiration to do whatever that wacky stuff comes to mind, no bards. So with that, I congratulate your graduation with a big… HIP HIP HURRAY!!
Thanks so much man, it's been a blast
Bye
Why did this get me emotional? Thank you for all the amazing content over the years Anthony, we love you too <3
Seeya in the next life
Hey Anthpo! Wanted to say congrats and that I also graduated college this semester, been awesome having your channel along the way
wow
I've been here for a while Anthony, and you've created something amazing, and I'm glad we were all here to experience it, good luck on whatever's next for you man, it's been a wild ride. ❤
Idk this guy but bye 😢
Congratulations and Goodbye Anthpo, I hope we meet again but this time not on screen.
Love you bro
This is so sad I just found you and I already have to say goodbye?!? I wish I could’ve found you sooner but none the less I’m still happy and lucky to have found you at all and see what you and your life is like I wish you the best
It was fun. See you around.
Crying
All great and beautiful things must come to an end at some point. Thank you anthpo for sharing the last 4 years with us.
Idk who you are but fair well and enjoy your life!
This is sad but perfectly goes with my life. Me completing my high school and your videos has given me a hope that college is gonna be great or maybe I can make it great. Thank you Anthpo. POWER OF FRIENDSHIP!!
Thank you Anthony! For these beautiful two years<3 this community and you are like the greatest people ever and I wish the best is coming for you and never change who you are<3
This is my first ever comment ever. I’m so glad I found your channel you are an amazing person and might have even inspired me to start college so thank you for opening my eyes to how great the world is. Truly thank you :)
peak
Somebody should make a movie about your college years
I was hoping this was a April fools prank, but i realized it's not April.  Thanks for lighting my day for 2 years. Goodbye and enjoy your new life!
Thank you Anthony for this crazy journey.
Goodbye and farewell Anthony, I think I speak for everyone when I say we wish you the best of luck outside of college !! 🏌‍♂️
So like what happens to us npcs now that the main character is done
Maybe just get another degree?
Damn goodbye man thank you for making good videos.
Thank you Anthpo. You have made youtube wonderful for 4 years and you deserve the best of luck in the future. Congradulations on getting your degree
Bye.
1:55 but okay whos kid is that?
im actually crying of happiness right now. thank you anthony. for the past few years ive been going through a lot, but every time, you managed to leave me with laughs and happiness. to fat yoshi, to perry the platypus, to screaming bloody murder as a witness to your lobster family get murdered, to the m.i.l.f's, to winning a volleyball tournament in haikyuu costumes, to rutgers university, and to so much more, THANK YOU!
Good luck on the road ahead, and thank you for sharing your life with us no matter how short the time may have been
Thank you Anthpo. I wish you the best that this life has to offer you. You were always a bright point to my day whenever you'd drop a new video. Thank you so much for sharing this small part of your life journey with us and letting us know, through select moments, that life is precious and not to waste it. Much love to you and the gang.  P.S. I'll be keeping an eye out for the 10-year mark Hanbon mentioned in the last proper video. I'm curious to see what the time capsule she mentioned means 👀
sad to see you go but im glad your doing whats best for you; take care out there
Wait so on more videos
😢
thank you for everything anthpo and friends, it’s been an incredible, hilarious and memorable ride that myself and so many others will never forget! Best wishes to all of you, and in every path you take i guarantee you’ll all find endless success, support and love. It’s been a wonderful 4 years and i’m so grateful to have found this channel. Anthony’s (and a couple others’) editing and videography have inspired me to pursue film, and the friendships you’ve formed over the years constantly inspired me to better my social skills and take chances whenever they’re offered to me or even just within my reach. I’m unbelievably proud of everything you guys have accomplished and although i’m sad to see it go, i know it’s for the better. Good luck, you all deserve the world!!
I hope it's just a prank and he'll continue posting videos.
Hopefully he cuts his hair now 💀
I never thought a youtube channel could have a closure like this. Its an awesome concept. Like any gold movie, It feels sad but you know you have to move on now and that makes you feel like these videos were very worth It.
Crazy how I've been watching him for 3 years already, I'm 16 now. Time is at the essence
what a crazy ride
I’d like to thank you Anthony for the amazing ride and in a way. Teach me how to savor the good times with the friends I’ve got. Good luck in future endeavors!
Sadly, im still a new person on your channel 😢
Noooo I love it so. MUCH
it was one hell of a journey bro, good luck to your future and whatever you do from now on bro!
Goodbye Anthpo :)
Thank you so much Anthony for everything! I’ve really appreciated your videos and they have helped me through a lot. I’ll miss you, see you soon bud.
I'm really going to miss this, all the adventures were so fun. I suck at communicating but these videos helped me get out there and try. Congrats on your graduation!!!
noooooooooooooooo
Damn dude already?
Good luck wherever you go, and thank you for the entertainment these last few years
welp... bye, im not ready for it but im glad i stuck around this long
Pretty badass to call it at the peak. We’ll all look back at this channel & remember it as a god tier channel from start to finish.
Sad to see the legend behind "Harassing People With Fat Yoshi" and "Total Drama Backyard" go but it's been a fun time. It'll be hard without you. I wish you all the best. ❤
How many Youtubers have said goodbye but then come back again 😑😑 it's like people doesn't know yt
Goodbye anthpo :)
I remember finding this channel with the yoshi video, time flies man, good luck.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
You had a good run...
*Screaming, crying.  I cannot believe it . But  we are so proud of you. I was a junior the first time I watched one of your videos , now I 'm in med school and this feels like the end of an era . Thank u  Anthony,✨✨•́⁠ ⁠ ⁠‿⁠ ⁠,⁠•̀
Wow, it was fun while it lasted
🎉❤❤
Just watched the series finale of Anthpo, pretty good
This made me cry so hard 😭😭
When I first subscribed he had less than 50k subs and now he's done with college with over a million, I'm so sad to see him go but I'm so happy i could see him grow♡😊
Now its time to go live yours
I saw ur channel yesterday and now ur quitting 😂😭😭
Honestly I can’t handle the fact your leaving but thank you for the laughs, the memories and Paul.  Thank you Anthony for everything
It is amazing that you could do all these awesome things over these past years and share all of your moments with us. I really don’t want your amazing channel to end. I grew very fond of it and have had so much fun watching all your videos. You have made us all laugh and even now, touched our hearts. Thanks Anthpo for being who you are :)
It’s strange, I’ve never started crying out of sadness with a huge smile on my face, I guess that’s what happens when you see something beautiful end  Thank you Anthony and good luck
Thank you. I've never been all that great at coming up with things to do but you've inspired me to just do anything with cool people, and I'm bound to have fun in the end.
Goodbye and thank you ❤
It's sad to see you go, but thank you so much for sacrificing so much of your time into making these videos.  I hope my own college experience will be as fun as yours was and i hope the best for you wherever life may take you in the future
I respect your decisions and everything you choose to do, but please don’t leave us😢
I’m gonna miss him.. He’s gone to a better place. I hope his family is okay.
AAAAAAAAAAAA - well done
I literally cried when I watched this video. It was a collage of so many amazing memories from the last through years. These past few years have been really hard for me, but when I watched this amazing group of friends I felt genuine happiness and laughed so hard I wanted to cry. I always wished that I would find something as special as they have, and I feel that they really showed me ✨the power of friendship✨ god, I’m going to miss these dorks. I love you guys so much and I can’t wait to see how far you go in life Antony, you’re a wonderful and talented person, I’m going to miss you ❤
i'm glad i was here for the ride, dude. i hope you and your friends are successful in whatever comes next for y'all. have a great life :)
That was it???? I was a fan since the yoshi videos. And I will say this sucked man. I genuinely skipped over the montage part :/ Please don't come back.
Anthpo I have been watching you for the past 2 years and  I am very attached to your channel I will never forget this And I am not ready for goodbye
Amazing channel goodbye man
This is such a beautiful goodbye, your legacy will live on forever <3 Thank you for everything!

I'll miss them so much
This is sad…
Goodbye King. There will never ever be anything like Anthpo.
It's so crazy i found this channel in highschool and now it ends as I'm about to go to University myself. Thanks so much Anthpo for helping me feel less lonely and bringing us all so much joy. And thanks to your friends for being awesome. I hope I'll be able ro find a friend group to help me through my four years lile you did
ngl i was hoping he would say SIKE at the end.                but in all seriousness i hope he continues to be a good person and does well in life ❤
Goodbye old friend

I'm surprised to feel sad at you leaving anthpo but I'm enjoying watching your videos again and the general message of being in present moment, caring and having fun with people is very aspirational for me and im gonna say 99.9% of the people here feel the same way.

I’ve been watching you since 2019 and honestly you’re videos have always but a smile on my face so thank you so much for everything you’ve done and its a new chapter for you, I’m sure it will be even better than the last x  Remember: mind over matter
it was a good run guys :)  We'll miss you a lot Anthony
He started from flying a car with a mouse, then showing Fat Yoshi to everyone, to becoming a real Haikyuu character, to having an OKpop group, to now.
Thank you ❤
The end of an era.
Love you Anthpo!
Dear Anthony, I started watching your channel since the very beginning (2017ish). No words can ever describe how much you've helped me and so many other people. Your channel is filled with happiness, laughter and never fails to put a smile on my face. Thank you for being the joy of so many lives and letting us watch your growth in your college journey. You will be incredibly missed and we wish you all the best in your future endeavors!
I always knew this day would come, ever since I saw the first video of when you were gonna graduate. And sometimes when I'd see your channel pop up in my recommendations, I begin to remind myself you'd be gone by the end, and I never expected it so soon when I was up tonight. But I just wanted to say, Anthony you've inspired me to keep going on through life, even with the most silliest and dumb moments, or going on through the sad ones, you've always cheered me up with your videos. You were also my main inspiration for buying a platypus onesie for my last year's birthday, and I've never regretted it since because it makes me laugh. Through all and all, I think these videos are sort of implying that we all have to keep living on in our lives, with our friends, and focus on the positive things. Us ourselves can make situations fun, even when they're boring or stressful. Thank you so much Anthony for always making everyone's days brighter, I will always remember this precious channel as a whole.
I hope it's a joke but if it isn't then happy graduation and goodluck po I'll definitely miss you though 😢
when i saw this video pop up i immediately started tearing up. i didn’t know this day would come so soon. thank you so much for all the laughs i’ve endured while watching you. it’s so sad to see you leave, but it’s nice to know that you’re opening a new door where this one has closed. i wish you the best of luck in life anthony. goodbye🫶
Gone, but never forgotten. Perry the Platypus Guy, Mr KSA, Po. Glad we were all here to witness your college adventures.  edit: It has been a month already and Im so upset that Im seeing no uploads :(.  edit 2: its been 2 months and now without anthpo content it doesnt feel the same. My expectations were exceeded with your amount of hard work on youtube :)
As someone who just stumbled apon this channel literally hours after their good bye video; I feel like I just missed out on years of good vibes
end of an era.
THANK YOU ANTHONY WE"RE GONNA MISS YA
goodbye anthpo
I was pretty sad when I saw the countdown being down to 3 hours and I now only realize that Anthpo channel has really come to an end :(  When I started watching your videos I was in 8th grade of high school and now I'm a junior. I didn't have much expectations for college life because I thought it would only be about studying but since you shared your college life with us I've been really excited about it as you showed how many great memories you can make with college friends if you find the right people  🥹  And even if you have lows it's okay: it will make your highs seem higher  We all wish you the best in life Anthpo and may Jesus bless you !
Thank you
Goodbye.
i'm so sad to you leave us but i'm so happy to see you happy. check in once in a while! we''ll miss you & we'll always be there for you!
Wow
You pushed me to keep making content, keep studying to make better content, but most importantly you kept me laughing and even just smiling through my best and darkest days. Thank you for being here for me and all your fans for the past 4 years. We're gonna miss you Mr. Anthpo
Thank you for keeping some of us company during the most isolating parts of our lives. I truly wish you nothing but the best for your future.
Bye.
Congratulations Anthpo!! It's been a blast watching your side quests.
We will miss you man. It has been incredible watching your vids. Thanks alot for everything , your content always made my day. Best regards for you and the gang.
Thanks for everything Anthony.
I remember the first time I stumbled upon this channel (it was the Perry the Platypus in high school one) and honestly your videos have helped get me through tough times. Congratulations on graduating college and I wish you the best of luck in life 🎉❤
I’ll miss you Anthony I loved your videos every time you uploaded my day only seemed to get better I’ll miss you man it’s been wild
ill miss you man. I hope you succeed.
Thank you Anthpo, you have given me many laughs throughout the year. I wish you well in your next chapter of life.
I can see he is content with it all and that's something I envy
Holy shit, I've cried more in the past hour than in the past 6 months. Thank you so much Anthony for making all of this amazing content, you have really been the only person that I've looked forward to their uploads. You have not only encouraged the people around you to be more open but also your viewers, since watching your content I have been way more open with everyone around me and I would not have had even a quarter of the opportunities and experiences had I not have found your content, I'm fairly certain that you won't see this comment as there are many like mine, but I still would like to think that you will, thank you so much. I'll miss you and I wish you the best.
wow, just wow. 2 years have flew by way too quick but at least we get to appreciate such a hilarious, fun and awesome journey!
You really are a great guy 😭
im so thankful to have found this channel soon 3 years ago. you inspired me to go out and do silly shit, have fun with my friends and live my own life unapologetically. so thank you, im sure we'll all miss you, i wish you all the best on your journey :)
So we aren't getting every episode of attack on Titan season 4?  Edit: guys there's still a hope!
Been here since your harassing people with yoshi vid; it’s sad to see you go, but I’m thankful for your channel man. Congrats on graduating! I still hope for some content, maybe not as much as before but at least some updates about you and your journey in the adult life. Proud of ya, we’ll miss you<3
Thank you for making amazing video.💟 Good bye 💟
I'll miss this man
is anthpo also not ever gonna post on his other socials? like instagram? to let ppl know hes alive? or is he just like quitting from youtube only
❤
Thanks Anthony for all the entertainment over these past few years you will be missed and I hope you enjoy everything that the rest of your life has in store for you
o7 been here since the fat Yoshi days can't believe its actually over.
I hope you have a great life man,i cant wait to rewatch your journey again, anyways anthpo,we love you!❤
Holy shit. I knew this dude when he was just a kid. And now he's man. I'M PROUD.
thank you for everything!
I’ve been following you as a high schooler ever since your first-ish videos and you quickly became my favorite YouTuber, now seeing you graduate college and looking back on all the things you’ve done, as someone who’s only a grade below and graduating next year herself it makes me feel so nostalgic an melancholic…. Watching Anthpo do all sorts of goofy things was a highlight during these years for me and I’m very sad to see him leave, but I’m also pretty thankful and I truly believe that this will remain in my memory as one of my favorite channels of all time, wishing you and your friends the best Anthony!
😢😢😢
Ever since fat yoshi your videos were honestly the highlight of many of my days, you truly are an inspiration to myself and many  more. Thank you and wishing you all the best on your journey in life Anthony. o7
It's been real, anthpo Thanks for entertaining me for the last couple of years
Thank you for everything you have done! No words can describe how much of an impact you have made on us. Thank you Anthony, best wishes for the future
go to grad school we will have you for 2 more years
Thank you for everything, Anthony.
Thank you for beeing this great, you are one of the best entertainers/creators on youtube and its a great loss for the platform.  But life goes on and where one door closes many others might open. I wish you the best in life <3
Thank you for these videos These videos really helped me in my dark moments, giving me hope for the future. Not in the grand future of the world, but hope for the small bits of memory I will have in the future. It gave me hope that I'll be ok
I pretty new to Antpho, but the way he just clicked with me is crazy, I'm gonna miss you.
Goodbye Anthony, thank you for posting this incredible content for us to all enjoy and sharing your best ideas as well, i think i talk for everyone when I say we will all miss you.
Really appreciate your channel man, you made me want to be more confident in myself and step out of my comfort zone. I'll miss one of my biggest role models.
Bye anthpo !
I'll miss your uploads a lot. Thanks for all the laughs and good times.  I've made a lot of good memories watching your videos, and I sincerely wish the best for you and your future shenanigans. Thank you, Anthpo Anthony Po.
I respect the hell out of this but damn I’m going to miss him
Thank you Anthony for sharing your college years with us all. I wish the best for your next adventure
You have truly inspired me like no-one else. Thank you.
Damn...
So long-a, Anthpo.
Thank you <3 Will miss you
Anthpo, I don't comment much on videos but for once I just want to say  thank you for all the memories, you've always managed to bring a smile to my face and I'll miss you but as they say all good things come to an end. THANK YOU ❤.
it's been an amazing ride
Hi Anthony!!! You’re probably never gonna see this but oh well, here it goes anyway. Your channel and your friends brought a lot of joy in my life, and motivated me to try out new things, have fun with my wishes, and it even pushed me into creating my own YouTube channel and putting out my ideas!!! And yes, one of my videos has one of yours (legally marrying a teddy bear) as a base, but I’ve been having so much fun!! So from the bottom of my heart, thank you Anthony, you and your friends, take care of yourselves and each other, and maybe we’ll see you all around!!
bro is the main character
Honestly I can’t believe it’s over, I started watching your channel when I was in middle school( which were the years I felt incredibly sad and angsty) just so I could feel better and laugh along with you and your friends. Now I’m entering my last year of high school, I’ll move on in life. It’s just so crazy how this is the end of an era, thank you so much Anthpo for making me laugh when I cried. I hope you have an amazing time on your next journey and that we’ll see you again sometime :)
Though i knew this day would come, i still can't believe that this is the end. So many good memories, i still remember the time you harassed people with fat yoshi twice. Great times. Thank you Anthony for giving us good content and being amazing
Thank you Anthony, for everything
Thank you anthony it's been fun
Farewell, Anthpo. You will continue to be an inspiration, a source of joy and a legend.
I can't believe I found out about this channel by clicking onto your AoT parodies. After that, I started watching your videos and literally every video you've made, has made me laugh and brought a big smile to my face. This also inspired me to make the most of the time I have left with my friends, and I did just that. Now I'm more happier than I ever have been.  Thank you so much for your content Anthpo. I Love You!
Honestly thank you antpho for making us laugh all these years and thank you for entertaining us when times are tough
I grew up with your videos, and you also you grew a lot. Thank you for everything I hope you'll enjoy your life.
it's been good, just finished my first year of college and made some good memories and had a lot of stressful and boring nights too, but I'm really looking forward to the rest of it :]
The first ever video I saw of you was the haikyuu video and the last ever video I’ll watch in this channel is this
Imma miss all of his content. I might now be able to get channel out my head and i think that a wonderful thing.
I've been here since you dressed up as Perry and harassed kids at your high school lol. It's been an amazing ride and this is such a bittersweet video. Thank you for making such genuine and lighthearted content in a time where it's desperately needed. Wishing you and everyone else nothing but the best as you go on into the next chapter of your lives. <3
I just wanted to say how thankful and grateful I am that I found your channel. You made me realize how important it is to make friends and how they can give you the best moments in life. Even though I am in my first year of College, I will try to make sure that I will do everything to make great friends and memories with them. I'll probably will never meet you in person but you taught me a lot of things about college and how it can be great with friends. Thank you Anthony, I wish you all of the best in life.
I love how he went fully copyrighted music because fuck it. What gives
this has been a wild few years, thank you so much for all the laughs
:( this is the first time I had ever heard of you and I’m so sad that I missed out on this!!!
Bye anthpo
At least we still have Tony p
he'll be back
Goodbye Anthony
lol happy you're doin well my dude, congrats
It's been real. Thanks, Anthpo.
Anthpo. I know im late to watch this video but I only found out about this channel this year and I’ve watched all your irl videos in high school and college. People always ask what’s the point of college. Next time someone asks, I will show them your YouTube channel and say this is why. I love your content sooooo much and will rewatch till the day I die. Most YouTubers get successful and sell out or just lose interest over time but you kept growing until the very end.  you are probably the first YouTuber to quit while theyre ahead which is super admirable. I hope you have an amazing life and never lose the friendships along the way. Peace
Honestly super sad. I just found your channel recently and I wish there would be more to watch! Best of luck in all your future endeavors!
Mr. Anthony potaro thankyou for making your vids they really made me laugh back when i was in highschool post pandemic class of 21 you have been an inspiration to me
omg im gonna miss this- goodbye
man this is emotional
Well, like many others I dont think I can leave this vid without one last goodbye. Thx anthpo :)
This is officially the first time I've seen a youtuber retire when I was still watching
i’ve been watching your videos since you were a senior in high school, now in a few months i’ll be a senior too. genuinely thank you for giving me hope for the future because college is still an obstacle i’ve yet to overcome. although i’m like super sad, everything still feels extremely full circle. i’m so proud of you and i wish nothing but the best for you and your friends. 💗☹️
Thank you.
Goodbye, Anthony. This channel will be held in a special place in my heart. Goodbye :)
I haven’t been here for that long, but I appreciate all of you guys. Thank you for al the laughs and also for some serious notes. Gonna miss you, wish you all the best <3
ive been here since perry the platypus and i enjoyed every second of this season. Plz make an Anthpo season 2 i will pay to watch it all over again
"Son, let me tell You a story about the legend of anthpo..."
I started watching you in high school and it blew me that some kid the same age as me was raking in millions of views harassing school mates with fat yoshi. Then I realized how genius it was. And I never stopped watching. Kinda regret not doing something like this when I had the chance.
This slams, I'm entering my third year. Power to you, Anthpo. We will never forget you and your friends 🎉🎉
This my first comment ever, I have been watching this channel for over two years, and have wished it never ended. Sad to say goodbye, all the best for the future :)
I can't even fathom that this is all over. You have made countless people's lives better and lifted the spirits of people needing a little laugh. You have made videos on a consistent basis even when competing with the struggles of college. The future awaits for you Anthony. I'm glad you made your decision. Cya round. :)
Been here since the beginning. Thank you for sharing.
Im not really good with words, so all I can say is: Slay
man
Damn, we're proud of you anthpo, hope your journey after graduation is a smooth but fun! We'll miss you!
thank you for making the best videos and making everyone's life better and happier. I'll miss you Anthony
never commented here before, but goodluck out there to anybody reading this.
You’re gonna keep the channel up though. Right?
Thank you for making the last 4 years of my life a wonder to go through.
Came here for the fun videos, leaving with tears. Thank you very much Anthony. For giving us this much joy.
Now to do what everyone does when their favorite show finally reaches the series finale. Start it over from episode 1.
See ya, cowboy
This cannel was something truly special, goodbye anthpo, and may you live a life you will be happy and fulfilled with.
gonna miss ya man, love.
thewre better bve a video titled " IM BACK"
Long comment warning ooh scary:  I've been watching your stuff on here since pretty early on in the channel and I'm gonna miss you and all the guys just doing stupid shit together. You guys have done a lot for me and so many others and it was super hard for me to not cry while watching this video seeing how far you've come.  All I want from you (besides hopefully a return in the far future) is to keep hanging out with the others. Seeing everyone together in that banquet video really made me miss all my friends I had growing up and made me want to be more outgoing and try to make new friends. Although I'm not really good at it cuz now I'm all shy- anyways.. thanks for these few years of fun. I'm gonna miss you.
It's been a journey man
It been fun everyone, I’ll miss you all, hope we can meet each some day again.
Goodbye anthony i wish you the best.
Thanks for all the laughs
it's been a good 4 years man thank you for everything and we all love you. Take care bro
Thank you Anthony it’s been an incredible ride :)
i remember seeing this one comment where this dude (jokingly) wrote about how anthpo is not going to college and wow he just graduated and is moving forward with his life. gonna miss him but good luck anthony.
Been there from the begining, thanks for all the laughs you brought when I was in a bad place, it's been amazing. Thanks for everything, good luck and enjoy your life ❤
I remember first watching the Yoshi video and have been a fan ever since thank you may life treat you well
Thank you
I started watching your videos as a freshman in high school wishing to graduate like you at the time. It’s crazy to say that I ended up loving high school and now wish with all my heart that I could live all the time that the pandemic took away from me. I’m now finishing my freshman year in college.  Time flies and never returns. Thanks to you too.
this is the Youtube equivalent of Steve leaving Blues Clues. It's been a ride Anthpo.
WAIT, who's not going to talk about Janice and Anthpo dating? Is this new information to everyone, or am I tripping?
I was cryingg this whole video.. been here since your high school days and this closure is better than anything i could ever ask for. Please live a happy life for all of us, as you have made my life better since you became a part of it. I love you so much, and i will miss you more
I just wanted to say thank you anthpo for all the great and unique content you put out in all these years, and giving us these highlights❤❤. Thank you for all the life lessons you taught us so goodbye Anthony and good luck in life.❤🎉
Hey mate wrote in the last video but I feel like I owe it to you and mysel to write again. Thank you I owe your channel so fucking much, you inspired me to actually get out of my lethargic fucking state and actually actively search for human connections and friendships and it worked!. These past two years have been the best years of my life I have gotten a group of friends who apreciate me I have gone to parties with them I have gotten drunk I fucking play DnD with them now I have been fucking blessed however high school ends in a week for me and that would mean each of us going on separate ways. I'm not ready for it to end i'm not ready to fucking say goodbye but this video showed me that I could you showed me that if I do something that I love with people that I love I will be ok. I will not fucking let this just end I will continue treasuring my friendships and I will make new ones. I now owe it to you and myself to have the best 4 years of my life and to acomplish my dreams big or small. So I thought as a silly little thing to write each year of my college life here what I did what I didn't do just for myself really I will fucking do this.   Year 0:Haven't started college yet, I want to get into cosplaying,cooking,I want to learn how to draw and I want to learn japanese currently going thru finals as i'm writting this.
Goodbye. Ngl, probably going to miss you, but, we can always come back to see what you experienced these two years, and what we loved to see you experience. Again, Goodbye, Anthpo. Hope everything goes one thousand times all right to you from now and forever after
Thank you for all the entertainment! It's been a pleasure to watch.
😭😭😭
It's hard to believe that time has flown by so quickly
im gonna miss yall, its been a wild 4 years huh
To think this all started as a kid in highschool making vines for the fun of it and to end it on such a crescendo is just beautiful, i cant say i was here for the full ride but i think being able to get to the stop and breathe in the fresh air nothing beats that feeling. Hope that the future stores new memories for you and I. Thank you and Goodbye, best wishes
even though I knew this was coming, it still feels so sad
I knew that this was coming and yet it still seems so out of the blue. I, and so many other people are going to miss you Anthony, but thank you for making such amazing videos for the past years.
Good luck with whatever you do in life have an amazing life you helped me through the toughest part of my life and your videos served as a great constant throughout the pandemic good luck everyone <3
hope you don't force yourself to not make videos of any type in the future for this promise, however we all hope you find your happiness in life. Love you antpho
Man, I am not ready for this to be over yet. I found this channel a couple years ago and have been watching ever since. Now, I'm graduating high school at the end of this month. I would be lying if I said I didn't start crying halfway through the video. Thank you, and goodbye, Anthpo. I have genuinely enjoyed watching your videos over the past couple of years. They helped me be a little less terrified of starting college. I will miss this channel a lot, and will definitely come back to rewarch my favorite videos often. :')
Good luck
Goodbye Anthony
gonna miss ma boy, thank you for years of laughter and joy that your brought e through your high school and college life
Bye
Wait a minute, I actually watched some of his vids. Holy shit me and my friend watched you before going seperate ways
i remember the first time i watched your video i bust out laughing so hard i broke my chair it was "harrasing strangers with fat yoshi" it was like i opened a new gate to a new world ❤ i hope you live a good life it will be difficult to not watch your videos GoodBye
I was first introduced to your channel through the perry the platypus videos, and have enjoyed your content every since. I am honored to be able to be a part of your channel and university journey. Thank you for the wonderful memories
started watching you videos years ago. haven’t been the biggest fan these past couple of years, but have been so happy to watcha video whenever it comes up. gonna miss you man
congratulations on graduating! I’ve been watching since you were making videos in high school. Thank you for sharing your life with us I hope you go on and live an amazing life and do amazing things.
For some reason, becoming a freshman and then graduating (a few weeks from now) feels like its been a lot longer than watching your vids since the fat Yoshi video until now.
Bye Anthony. I have always loved you videos and you will always hold a special place in my heart, it’s been a great time thank you Anthony.
This guy really made this the 69th video on the ‘until graduation’ playlist. Absolute legend!  On a more serious note, thanks for the all the free entertainment. Your videos were some of the most entertaining, and have made me generally more excited to see where my life takes me, who I’ll meet and where I’ll go. Thank you!
Haven’t been here since day one but I first watched your volleyball video. Such a great story and an Amazing Journey! We will all miss you. I have always been interested and found your videos funny and extremely entertaining. All of you guys such a great friend group fun ride but you have reached your destination Congratulations on graduating Thanks for all of the entertainment! Bye and hope to see more videos.🥲
I’m sorry but who are you? Why are you in my recommendations?
I’m gonna miss you so much. I remember watching you since you released the perry the platypus video, and the more I watched, the more I realised ur not really perry the platypus, ur an outstanding human being and an inspiration to content creators to be different and not follow trends, but to purely live in the moment
Goodbye Anthpo, you’ve truly been such a great inspiration!! we love you so much!! ❤
God it’s like phineas and ferb all over again
I'd say something well thought out and heartfelt, but everyone else has beaten me to it. Thank you for everything Anthpo, you're a great youtuber and as far as I'm concerned an even greater person. Best of luck with whatever you choose to do after this. Watching your content has been great. Thank you.
Thank you Anthony. You'll always be an inspiration to me and I'll never forget the amazing things you've done.
Godspeed you magnificent bastard.  -me
_Just wanna start by saying that you've managed to entertain 1.65 million of your audience with amazing and silly content for these past years. When I first heard of you through your yoshi video, I noticed myself coming back to your channel all the time whenever you post something. Now you're a college graduate planning to pursue other things in life. Although this is the end of your channel, it's an opportunity for everyone to continue their journeys. Thank you Anthony for being a part of our lives too !!_
I will always come back to rewatch all your videos  Also, am i stupid or did anybody notice now that Janice is his gf?
Atleast we still have Tony P. and OKPOP
That last line really struck my heart. I'm really gonna miss you and your friends. Damn it's been 2 years since I found your channel. Thank you for all the memories that you shared with all of us. May you have a prosperous life.
It’s been real chief See you on the other side 🫡
It's kinda crazy to think about found this channel my freshmen year of high-school with the fat yoshi and perry the platypus videos and knowing that I've been watching your funny videos up until my senior year of high-school it's got me excited to see what's out there for me I'll be moving to flagstaff with some friends and hopefully living a life that's as fun as yours so thank you for making my days better with your videos anthpo
Im so glad i got to experience this while it was going on. I hope you have a good rest of your life. You deserve it. Goodbye
thank you so much for the laughs these last few years, i hope you enjoy the rest of your life from here on out. it was really amazing to see how the ACU expanded and they all seem like incredible people. From today on actually my life will change quite a bit and so i guess it's a coincidence that one of my favourite channels is ending too.
I have watched your videos all the way since high-school and fell in love instently. You can't  imagine what you did for me when I saw a new upload before I was about to crash on my couch, or in my room lounging. Thank you anthpo for all of the fun through the years.
Jr fucking joking HOW R U GRADUATING COLLEGE ALRDY WEREN'T U JUST GRADUATING HS..... ohmigoddd😭💔
I found this guy dancing in a Perry the Platypus suit and im glad I stuck with him. Goodbye
It's been a best journey ant
Honestly it's been such a fun ride to join you on. Through the laughs and the cries, it has all been such an amazing journey to watch. Thank you
GOODBYE I GUESS.
I think there is a lot to be said about why he is quitting, though it's sad, this is his life and not everything can be filmed on camera. But it's been the best, he is one of the greatest YouTubers for his simple and old school style of just doing whatever he wanted to do to have fun with his friends. Anthpo could not have ended on a higher note.
Every once in a while, YouTube will recommend me these type of “goodbye” or “last video” and without fail I always watch them. It’s always from YouTubers I’ve never have never interacted with before. It’s kinda like going to a movie late and only watching the end, thinking “what did I miss”
Thank you for this giving us this. Your friendship is something I wish I could find in the future with people around me. It’s going to be weird not having you around anymore, I actually used to think there was more time, but we’re here, so thank you so much for being you and for this wild ride that you showed us. We’re going to miss you.
till next time logan
I've been watching your videos since the first fat Yoshi video, I love your youtube channel so much and I'm not ready to be without you, thank you, for putting a smile on my face countless times, and thank you for your funny content that cheered me up in a hard time, thank you, and goodbye Anthony. ❤😭
I’ve been watching this channel for about 2 years now! this sounds extremely cheesy but it’s completely true, anthpo has changed my life. I’ve  been terrified of any type of social interaction for all my life, so I had very little friends. 2 years ago I started watching anthpo hang out with his friends and it made me so jealous i just started talking to people! and it worked!! I now have 3 little friend groups, and they’re the best! they’ve gotten me through rough times and I don’t know what I would do without them  so thank you Anthony! You will have left youtube having made a difference, for me atleast
For the past two years I have been watching your channel. Now that I am about to graduate high school I look forward to creating fun memories like this for myself once i go to college. Thank you for giving me something to look forward to because i was genuinely scared of starting this new chapter in my life.
Im sorry, but anthpo making his "til graduation" playlist 69 videos long is really funny
Goodbye
BYE SNOOKUM PIE ILL MISS UR CONTENT 😢😢😢😢😢
'Don't cry because it's over, be happy because it happened'
Sorry im like seven hours late to this but Godspeed Anthpo, godspeed. I think I can say for certain that we all wish you well and good luck on whatever your doing into the future.
It's been a great ride, and I'm glad i stayed from the beginning 'till the end. Goodbye
Thanks for everything
Nu😢
Thank you anthpo
will he be back soon? i dont know. only time can tell.
Been here since the yoshi days 😢 This is going to be hard to say goodbye to, but thank you for everything you've shown us and the wonderful videos you've made.
I came with a Perry the Platypus video. I left with tears in my eyes.
I can’t believe it
🫸🏼🫷🏼
I remember watching the goofy yoshi video and subscribing immediately, curious to see what you think of next. Now I'm 19 and going to college, filled with excitement rather than fear, thanks to seeing how many amazing things a person could do during this time. Thank you 💕
Goodbye Anthony, thank you for everything :))
It's joever
bye bye
thank u for everything, anthony. <33333
It was fun to follow along these past couple years cause I also graduated at the same time, but man seeing that counter go down was always stressful, haha.
Thank you so much Anthpo for the laughs. The first video I watched fro you was your fat Yoshi video when it came out back in my sophomore year of high school. Since then I've rediscovered your channel and watched every video and you even inspired one of my YouTube videos (How To Eat A Banana). Good luck to you in life, we love you and goodbye. OOOOOKPOP!!!👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
some great things always come to an end, good bye old friend
Thank you anthpo for all the laughs, it's been such a fun ride being able to get home from school or work, sit down, and pull up the latest video. 100% gonna rewatch your videos from the start! Cheers bro
This is crazy how life lines up like this. Anthony  finishes his story well I start to make my way towards college. Throughout my high school years I was afraid of college or more specifically the fear of growing up. Thank you Anthony for taking away my dread of moving on. We'll all miss you buddy.
damn what a ride this has been. wish you the best of everything you did and i hope you're able to accomplish the goals you want to achieve moving forward. been watching you since the yoshi video and got many of my friends hooked on your content. best of luck man
So when are you starting grad school?
I adore your videos anthpo 😢 peak college
I’m happy for you and that you got to graduate I’m so grateful to have shared some of your memories🩷 may you have a great future and follow your dreams🩷
Thanks for everything! Fellow class of 2023 grad here and I wish you the best. Congrats!!! You've brought so many smiles to the world and will continue to do so in the future whereever life takes you. Thank you for existing :)
I have been watching since the volleyball vid congrats and I honestly cant see you go awway we will all miss you!
I've been watching all since the start, hope you find success whereever life takes you!
I'm gonna miss you Anthpo. You've changed my life and you'll always be one of my favourite youtubers ever. I can't believe it's over, but I hope you have a good life after graduation <3
Man, Fat yoshi brings me back, that was the first vid I ever saw back in 2020. What an ending!
"Thanks for being part of my story now it's time to go live your's". #1 im sad #2 im two years out of high school in a dead-end minimum wage job with no idea what I want to do to with my life. WHAT STORY?
😢
Goodbye, you amazing meme man and keep walking on the pathway that is life, anthpo!
I’m not ready 🥲
It's been a wild ride! My time in college is also running out and I just wanted to say that it's been fun going through it with you and your friends. Knowing how hard college can be, I'm impressed and greateful that you took the time to give us so many videos even though it must have been tough at times. I'm a bit sad we're not getting an aot part 4 video, I was looking forward to hearing you sing Rumbling but you gave us absolute bangers with Okpop instead so it's all good. Come say hi every now and then if you want to but no pressure though! I hope all the best in life to you and all your friends, I'm sure you have a bright future ahead of you! Thank you for everything! 💕
thank u for everything ❤
Bye😭😭
Thanks for all the amazing videos anthpo! Thanks for all the smiles. Stay safe and good luck on all your future endeavors. It has been a great ride. See ya!
1:10 goddamn you spitting banger bars
Bro aint you the guy that made aot parodies pls come back
seeing the days count down until the end of this channel has been weird. tomorrow is my last day of high school, and its really scary to be moving into a new stage of my life. but it's been kind of comforting and reassuring to watch this channel do its thing and get closer to the end. it reminds me that things are always going to change, and be new and scary, but that i'm still going to have friends and do new things and have fun. i'm glad that we were here at the end, and i'm thankful for all the laughs and fun and heart that the ACU gave us. much love to anthpo and crew, i wish you guys the best <3
I have been watching you all the way when I was in high school in my softmore year and now it's been a year after I graduated good riddance school, but anyway it's a shame you have to go, you are the funniest person I ever seen on YouTube wish you the best of luck goodbye anthpo
I can’t say anything but that I will truly miss not only anthpo’s content, but his personality and genuine love for this project. I personally started watching his vids only two years ago out of shear boredom and nothing more. I found something to laugh at when I was feeling down, or to learn about new stuff every day! It inspired me to continue art, want to breach out into filmmaking, and crack just a little bit out of my shell :) It was this complete gem of the internet that has made not only my day but so many others. A bittersweet ending, the beginning of the end. Shall we all use the power of friendship to lighten our way through our lives, love and compassion for others <3
Holy shit anthpo ive grown with you this whole time, I graduated same year and im also in college but I still got 1 more year to go. Seeing this journey youve taken and seeing how much youve grown makes me realize that Ive been holding myself back. Ive been holding people like you on this high pedestal saying I could never make friends and have fun the same way you have but I can. Ive just been too afraid to try, unlike you. Imma miss your videos man, thanks for everything.
thank you for letting us be a part of your story. we all support you in whatever you do next
I'll miss you'll, crazy how you are ending college and I'm starting mine❤
Heading into college and im ready to start that same chapter of my life and honestly I'll look at my memories of watching you fondly, jolly good show.
Growing up is such a magical thing
I've just finished my first year if college, and your videos have always inspired me to live life to the fullest and make meaningful connections with people. Congrats on finally graduating, and keep living life to its fullest!!!
Thank you bro ❤
I know this is goodbye and all, but do you think you will play 8illy in smash again for all the marbles?
I have been watching your videos since I'm like 14, I will be starting college in aroun 3 months, this has been a great ride, I hope anything you do goes well. thank you for the videos !!!!
I knew this was coming but I am still struggling to accept it. Thanks. Best of luck with your future endeavors.
I came across Anthpo only recently and found I connected in so many ways with his ideologies and his love for his friends. I am fortunate to have a strong friend group and have been inspired to engage more with them, share in amazing experiences and to not let anything get in the way of that. I graduate next year and I can't wait for what the future holds thereafter. Thank you everything!
Thank you bro. Have a blast! love you!
My comment is going to be buried under, but I've been watching you since the Big Yoshi 2 video. I was one grade ahead, but due to some double gap year shenanigans, I'm graduating a year from now. One of the reasons I was really drawn towards your video is that I was also the class clown/class comedian, I also dressed up in different costumes and acted as different characters during high school, however, never at your level of quality. You inspired me to push myself to the next level and to go beyond what I was doing before. I ended up on the pre-med track in college and didn't have time for such bafoonery, but it was such a nice feeling to pop one of your videos on, and see you get into those hijinks, bringing laughter, filling a much-needed niche, and making the world a better, happier place in a way no one else was doing. Time didn't have its way and force you to compromise that creative force of yours, and that's very admirable. It was so cool watching your style grow over the years. Thank you for producing such hilarious content, and best of luck to your future endeavors!
Thank you Anthony, for everything
I discovered this channel about a year ago. Your videos reminded me of my friend group, so I instantly subscribed. I may have not been here from the beginning, but it was a wild ride watching your content. It made me realize that one day my friendships may come to an end, so I should cherish every moment I have with them.  I wish you and your friends prosperous futures. We will miss you.
this went hard
seeing clips of those really old videos again really hits different after all this time,,, once again wishing you the best in life! all of your videos are clearly filled to the brim with love and pure goofiness, which are some of the best characteristics to have imo
I started watching Anthpo when I was a Freshman in High School. Today, I am High School Senior awaiting Graduation in 2 weeks. I found Anthony's Channel at the perfect time in my life and at first I just watched him for the dumb antics, but seeing him evolve in making his videos better by incorporating his friends is something that has really inspired me. It really taught me a lesson of using unconventional ways to bring people together that I try and incorporate in my everyday life. I don't know if Anthony will see this but his content has genuinely made such a positive impact on my life both for entertainment and inspiration. I'm gonna miss the videos, but I know Anthony is gonna go on to do better things.
It was a good run, it’s best to end it on a high note
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I am sad that this is over but this has been such an amazing journey and I have been there watching these and so have 1.65 million people too! I am very happy that you have graduated college and started a new journey. Thank you for entertaining us and keeping our spirits up
i’ve been watching since your high school shenanigans videos. i remember watching the video from when you graduated high school and crying when i was in middle school. now here i am, about to be a senior soon and crying over your graduation from college video. thank you for all these years, Anthpo. you inspire me to try to talk to people, try new things, and really just try to enjoy life. again, thank you, and we’ll miss you ❤️❤️
Anthpo, you truly inspire me and you gave me so much entertainment and comfort through the past few years with your videos. i rewatch them all the time cause it's just fucking incredible. i wasn't ready for you to go but now when i hear you talk about being so tired of youtube and being burnt out, i'm like man. i'm ready to let go. i'm glad your videos will always be here for all of us to watch over and over again. i wish you all the best in your future for whatever you do. thank you.
Youre awesome bro! Thanks for all the good laughs over the years. I remember when you were just a goofy kid with a bunch of printed out yoshi pngs. Good luck out there ant
hasta siempre
2 years ago, I found this wonderful channel. I watched it and always found joy in it. Now, that it's time to say goodbye, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for being in this world <3
He graduated 69 days early
I’ll miss this channel
bye antpho cinematic universe! yall inspired me a lot and thanks for that
goodbye.
Goodbye Anthony. You sharing your story truly meant a lot to me and many other people. You and your friends made some great entertainment over the years and brought many laughs into millions of lives, do thank you
It’s been a rollercoaster not just for you but me as well. I too have just graduated college and it’s been a remarkable experience so many memories and friends. You’ve inspired me to continue to live like every day is just another adventure waiting to happen. Thank you for so much and I cannot wait to see what happens next for all of us!
I started watchinf you 4 years ago, when you posted that Fat Yoshi video. I was in my last year of middle school, or at least 7th grade, and I haven't stopped watching. Thank you for being funny.
It didn’t fully sink into me until this video that this really is the last anthpo video… thank you anthony for always making me feel better after a bad day with your amazing videos. I hope you succeed in whatever you choose to do next.
Good luck Anthony wherever you may be
Subscribing to this channel four years ago was the best investment I’ve ever made
This doesn’t feel real, Thank you for all the good times and best of luck in the future!
thank you for the fun and inspirational years anthony.
RIP to my brotha....no but really I do want to say something that has already been repeated 12,369(nice) times so far-thank you Anthony. I don't have a fuckin emotional story behind my viewership or anything crazy, but just a genuine love for your BS and antics. Good fucking jub and good fucking luck with your future-wherever it may take you.       PS: there's no way you never post another youtube video-you'll come back to us eventually and I'll be here waiting for you when you do.
Just realized the playlist has exactly 69 videos, god damn it
Dude as someone who has seen a lot of highs and way more lows on YouTube since the early days, your years of chaotic wholesomeness with your friends were one of the highest highs this platform was ever blessed with!   In times of the millions of short term trends and viewercount optimization, seeing friends just doing awesome fun stuff together was something, this platform didn't deserve - yet it desperately needed.  And for knowing how to leave on your own conditions, you earn my biggest respect. Maybe we'll see you again some time. Maybe not. Who knows what future brings? But for yours I will wish you the best, dear Sir!
I don't know what to say except thank you Anthony. Your experiences have honestly been a great help in moments where I didn't see a way out of difficult situations. Go live life man! Congrats on graduating!
Goodbye maybe not forever but I grew these last four years as much as the next person. And seeing someone enjoying their life always reminds me to enjoy mine.
I’m not ready. But, goodbye. :(
i need that tony tony chopper head near the end
Good bye Anthony. I’m glad you got this far, i enjoyed watching your videos
Nooooo 😢
NOT ON MY BIRTHDAY
I just realized that it's anthpo not antpo after 4 fucking years
CONGRATS ON BECOMING A BUSINESS GRADUATE, ANTHONY! I haven’t even watched you, but now I’ll miss you!   PS. Hope you got to meet Sir Henry (the Rutgers mascot.)
It's been real, your videos have made such a difference :')
damn bro I feel like I have been watching you for a lot of my life. I am a junior in high school about to be a senior and im not ready for this shit to advance, but I guess its time to take a dive into the deep end because everyone I've grown up with seems to have already swam across 🥲
Thank you exist man your entertainment has really brought a lot of people happiness hope your life goes well
Been watching you for i dont really know how many years but youve been a big part kf my childhood and humor. And also youve given me a huge list of stuff i wanna do when im in college so yay and thx. Sad youre leaving but makes sense this was just a page in your story of life and now its time to end this chapter and go into the next one. Hope its full of new joys and fun and you keep growing and being an awesome person ❤👍
thanks for all the entertainment, best wishes for your future endeavors🫡
Damn, thats really it. This channel meant so much to me so many other people. Thank you
It's so crazy that's it. Thank you anthpo for doing this amazing content for the past 4 years. I hope that whatever you do in life will truly make you happy. I still hope to maybe see you in an Alpharad video even just as a cameo. Thank you and go live your life to the fullest.
Thanks Anthpo, see ya
thanks anthony❤️
it was a nice journey my friend
It's hard to say goodbye, I cried while watching this. I've been watching and following along in your life since your first video. Thank you so much Anthony, your content has inspired me to do many good things in my life. Thank you, and please do well with the rest of your story ❤
anthpo, ive been watching since only a few vids. "oh this looks like a cool video, lets see what it is" past me would say, not knowing the wonderful channel i had discovered. i decided to watch more as they were always hilarious and fit my sense of humour. i decided to subscribe as you only had around 50k subs so i thought it would help and it would notify me of videos to come. every video uploaded i was like "oh nice, a new anthpo video! ima watch it" every time for almost 4 years straight. never has your videos dissapoint, upset or destroy anyone, but all of them brought the laughs and joy we all need. from janice drawing on the wall in the wii tournament to paul being my inspiration to get a djungelskog, never at any point has i thought "bro this channel is so bad ill just watch something better" because its the sense of humour that i like, everyone likes and the best part is, i know its not just me who enjoys it, thats why u have 1.65 million subs. think of it as 1.65 million people loves your shenanigans. 1,650,000. if u do continue this channel, i will be contently watching along.  Thanks for the memories, Anthpo. Congrats on graduating.
This video felt like an ending to the most funny and heart warming movie I have ever watched. It truly felt I watched a film about your life in college even making me want to go to college
Thank you.Thank you for the great memories.I started watching this channel in the pandemic and they used to always make me laugh.I was always excited when a new video came out.But now,i'm gonna live my own life,Make my own great memories and most importantly,make you proud.thank you,for everything.
I'll just leave a comment here, but I havnt watched the video. The last few days havnt been the best and I feel like if I watch the video I will definitely cry. Goodbye!
from harassing people at your high school with pictures of fat yoshi, to graduating college.  how time flies
it's amazing how much stuff you did just to make your loved ones happy that most people would think of as too much . thanks so much for a rly fun two years !!! wish you good luck :))
Goodbye anthpo, we're all proud of you. ❤❤
It was fun 💪🏾
So Long Anthpo
There's a lot I want to say, and while it's difficult to phrase, I feel like at the heart of what I want to write is just simply: congratulations, and thank you!! You've made such a huge difference on the people around you; your passion, love, and care for your friends and family shines through so much just through these fun videos alone. You've also built up such a huge community and sacrificed so much of your personal time and energy to share your positivity with all 1.65 million of us too, and I am incredibly grateful of all the dedication you put in to see this channel to the end. You have such a creative mind, and no one could ever replicate these ideas the same way you've experienced and developed them. You have so much to be proud of, and I mean that wholeheartedly. The effort that you put into your work here means so much more to us- and I'm sure to the people around you- than you'll ever realize. Even if there are some in your personal sphere that maybe haven't shown as much appreciation as mentioned in the last video, I just want you to know that your time was worth it, your sleepless nights were worth it, your sacrifices were worth it. People will come in and out of our lives, but I truly believe partings happen for a reason, either to learn something from the other person, or to teach them something they'll use on their own to grow in the future. However, the time you did spend with them talking and laughing in those moments is still something to cherish, because regardless if you've realized it or not, I'm sure their presence in your life has impacted you in some way shape or form. You have so many incredible, once-in-a-lifetime memories to look back on just in these last four years alone, and if you ever feel stuck or unmotivated, I'm sure you can use these past experiences for inspiration towards the future. Something I've been trying to teach myself as well is that regardless of what may lie in our future paths, as long as we dedicate ourselves here and now in the present to the things we're passionate about, then we'll be blessed beyond comprehension. "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." - Matthew 6:33 KJV Praying that wherever you may go after this and whatever you may do, that you put your all into it while continuing to share your love and drive with others. No fear, struggle, or worry is more powerful than the plan God has laid out for you, and you will come out on top because, regardless if you see it or not, you're not alone and these challenges will only help you grow more. Sending lots of love to you, your friends, family, and the amazing community that's been built up here over the years! Hope you were able to celebrate in a big way! Congratulations again, and wishing you all the best!
Thank you for everything forever and always, Anthony ❤️
I’ve been here since yesterday. That’s not a joke i subbed yesterday. Your videos are so cool and i wish you luck
Goodbye Anthpo
I'm graduating from 10th grade in a month and from my current school which I've attended for nearly a decade, and joining my country of residence's version of high school (which starts in 11th grade) in August. I've been watching your videos since early to mid 2020 and they've always made me feel part of something, a friend group and part of life as a whole. Now that this channel is an archive and you've begun the next chapter of your life, it makes me want to start my own life too. Thank you Anthony for your service to YouTube and to those who have been watching you.
It's enough to make a grown man cry
glad to have been here since the fat yoshis 💜💜💜💜💜
I have been watching your videos since the perry and yoshi days and they were absolutely hysterical. Along the way I must have stopped watching you, but when the first dares 4 swears video dropped, I was hooked again. I have been dreading this moment for at least 2-3 weeks, because you never want the good times to end, or the channel to end in this case. But I want to comment on this video ( I don’t have the power to watch the others yet) to tell you that you and your friends have all given me examples to follow in life ( as silly as that sounds) and countless hours of joy and laughter. I don’t want this to sound weird, I’m not too good with anything ending. Anyway, thank you so much for everything and good luck to all of you after college
You are the best, you inspired me to be in a Perry the platypus suit and enjoy your funny content. Goodbye 😢
Good luck and have fun with the rest of your life!
I cannot say how happy your videos have made me and im literally crying rn bc im not gonna see them anymore. But thank you for all the amazing work you have done and sharing your life with us. We won't forget you
Thank you!! hope the rest of your life is amazing haha
Good bye Anthony  thanks for all the efforts you done all these years. ❤
It’s tough to get the right words out, but the best ones I can think of is THANK YOU!
This feels weirdly coincidental because I start college in a few months and it really hit me when anthony said "Thank you for sitting here and being part of my story. Now it's time to go live yours."  Been here since the highschool videos and man am i gonna miss this. I am so grateful for the fact that I was influenced by you in my teenage years. Thank you anthony for always reminding me to have fun in life. <3
been here since you terrorized people with a printed yoshi and I can't believe we're here, to an end of an era 🥺  thanks for all these years, anthony! wer'e supposed to be in the same year but I repeated college bc of the pandemic and you telling me to live my life at the end of the video gives me so much hope that I'll get to live my college life close to the way you lived yours.
I guess i have to move on now. It doesnt feel as bad as I imagined. Ig the video from yesterday and the countdown made me prepare for the goodbye. Was a fun ride. Goodbye and thank you.
Its so damn hard to say goodbye anthpo.. you've helped me realize a lot of things in my life.. these past years have been nothing short of amazing. Being able to watch these videos had me like i was with y'all having fun together. You and everyone among the ACU has impacted my life very positively thank you again anthpo.. you've been amazing
thankyou anthony
"...now it's time to go live yours." That line alone reminded me that im about to go into that college life in the next 2 months, the life that I've witnessed through the small screens and your videos and how I longed for it. And now although I am not ready to say goodbye but thank you for the past years of the amount of emotions and all that good stuffs you have brought us along with your journey. Thank you Anthony.
Thank you so much Anthony for making me and everyone else laugh, cry, and I wish you luck with whatever you do!
Bye
i remember seeing the days until graduation in the 600s, thinking the end would seemingly never come. But now, it has. Thank you for the laughs and joy anthpo. I hope your life is an amazing one
im not ready man.
It may be over, but at least we'll have a story, right?
Goodbye Anthony and thank you!
Change da world My final message Goodbye 👋
bye
this is so sureeal
I stumbled across your channel because my favorite tv show is, and always will be, Phineas and Ferb. To me it holds a reminder that every moment holds a chance to live life to its full potential. Your channel quickly came to hold a similar place in my heart. I have been watching since you were in high school, and now I am a short 3 weeks away from graduating myself. I know I’m gonna remember you anthpo. When I’m walking across that stage to get my diploma and when i make summer memories with my friends before we all part ways and when i start my new life at college I am going to remember what I felt as I watched you live your life to the fullest each week. Through you I saw a promise that each end in life isn’t a bad thing. You just need to take these opportunities and make the most out of them. Thank you for showing me all of this and more. I just want to leave a time capsule of my thoughts to show that I was here in this moment. I was here for the end which is really a new beginning. In four years I want to come back and have a stockpile of videos and memories as great as anthpo’s.   Thanks for the memories anthony. See you soon.
Platypus Yoshi man, good luck with your life! Have fun Beybladeing and playing Bakugan in the future!
Congrats Anthony on graduating and thankyou for keeping me entertained throughout COVID
RIPBOZO
Thank you for all the memories Anthpo, we will miss you❤❤❤❤❤
Well, time to share MY story. I found you during the fat yoshi days before you even started at Rutgers. It's insane to think that through my college graduation, job hunting (twice), a 2 year relationship with my now ex gf, losing two grandparents, and making a ton of new friends as my life situation changed, you and YOUR friends were always a constant in my life. I was always so excited to see a new video come out, because I knew I was in for a good laugh and a chance to live vicariously through your many adventures. You guys have left such an impact on me and countless other people, and I cannot thank you and your friends enough for everything you've provided us over the years.  Anthony, thank you for EVERYTHING, and I wish you and everyone else all the best as you move on to the next chapters in your lives. I know you'll all stay friends for life, and I can't wait to see where you all end up in the future.
Like a lot of other people here, I don’t think I can leave this video without leaving a comment. I just wanted to say thank you, Anthony, for all the laughs over these last four years. From middle school to now, almost at the end of my high school career, it’s been so much fun to watch you go on this journey. And now, it’s over. You’ve graduated and a lot of my school friends are graduating too, but (and this is probably because it hasn’t set in yet) I’m not super upset. If anything, I’m just happy I was able to find this channel in the first place. So, thank you, Anthpo, for giving us all a little bit more joy in our lives ❤️
thank you for everything Anthony ❤
now, I gotta rewatch all your videos
I remember when I was watching your  perry the platypus for the first time. since I studied at high school . I think you are so cool. And now i got in the collage, still enjoys all the fun video you made until now. Good bye , thank for everything. ❤
Wherever you go, whoever you meet, whatever you do. I hope you continue to pursue your happiness and I have no doubt that you will have many more experiences that you'll cherish forever. Everything that you've done so far that makes you you, gives me no doubt that your actions will naturally benefit everyone around you and I'm grateful to see people like you still out there. Continue to do you and I'm sure you'll be able to accomplish anything you set your mind to, no matter how big or small it may seem. Even if you never seem to find fulfillment in your life, remember to look back and see how much you've done to get there. It's always about the journey.  Also I have a hunch/hope that you end up making movies for the big screens because of your talent in world-inspiring storytelling. Putting this here so I look like a time traveler if it happens.
You and I are the same age and graduated the same time, this send off feels the same to me as I felt saying by to all of my friends I've known for years. It's extremely bittersweet, hopefully we both find our next step in the world. I don't know what exactly you intend to do, but I just graduated with a degree in organismal biology and ecology, and am now in Hawaii ready to start conservation work. Hope your next chapter is just as exciting
Good
Damn gonna miss this channel, but it gives me all the reason why college might be worth it in my future. Next year will be my senior year of high school and time is gonna fly. Thank you Anthony for showing your ups and downs you a real one 🥲
Thank you Anthony for always being someone that could show me how, even when facing the unknown or not being completely sure of myself that, I can always show compassion and confidently face challenges in my way. Thank you for being a shining light through rough times and you will be remembered as a legend ❤
Goodbye and thank you, for everything
Dang it’s been such an awesome journey bro. Been watching since fat yoshi, hope that you find what you’re looking man.
NOOO, ITS HAPPENING, NOO
i watched and x amount of your videos and i still forgot to subsrcibe- bye bye tiny man
dude, I just found your channel a little over a day ago. My older sister just graduated college with her bachelors a little over a day ago as well.   So, although I don’t know you, you and my sister graduated high school and college in the same year. I watched her grow up to be the woman she is today and as you embark on your journey, in this new era of your life, I wish you the best as well❤❤❤   congratulations graduate 🎓🎉❤
You’re like those shows that we all used to watch as kids when growing up. You have taught us many things, and we have changed ourselves because of you. You had been there when some of us needed you and we’ve been there when you needed us. But now we reach the finale, and we all mourn that the end has came. But when those feelings come to pass, only joy will remain. You have impacted our lives even when you don’t even know most of us. We will remember you for as long as we can, and even when many will soon forget, the idea of you will linger with us all. This is merely a new chapter for all of us, and we hope you’ll live the rest of this journey with joy and content.   Thank you and Goodbye Anthpo, we wish you the best and keep being you.
The perfect ending
Thanks for the smiles, best wishes for your future journey.
can someone explain why he is saying goodbye?
It's been a fun ride. I remember watching your videos in high school, many years back. I'm glad you were able to fill that time with laughs and love. Good luck to whatever is in your future Anthony
I cant leave without saying how much joy youve brought me Anthony. Thank you for making so many people happy. You have no idea how much ive enjoyed waking up and cheaking if youve posted. I really cant say it enough, Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for everything. Thank you Anthony.
goodbye anthpo.
The hardest thing is to say goodbye and let go, but from the things you let go you could never know what will make them way back to you
Found you while procrastinating on an assignment. Proud of you
I thought we had more time... where did all the time go? Ah, well... at least I was here for some of it :,)
I'm gonna miss this channel not gonna lie, but I know it's for the better. It's been a wild ride Anthpo <3
Hey. It’s been real and thanks for sharing piece of your life with us! I’m really bummed i caught you at the end of this channel, but you’ve encouraged me to really enjoy life. Wherever you go, you’ll definitely light up the place. Proud of you man. Thanks you lighting up my world with even just a short time.
Saying bye to you and your channel doesn't cut it for me on a personal level, so I'll see you sometime later, Anthpo. Even if later never comes, just saying bye this way is better for me. ;-;
I remember the first time I watched ur videos u we’re just harassing your high school dressed a perry the platypus. I’ve been watching all of your videos ever since. I’m gonna miss you
I’ve literally only started watching your videos since a month ago, and even then I can still say you have helped me a lot. Made me realize that it’s okay to act goofy sometimes, to be loud, and to be free in the moment. And that it’s okay to struggle as well. Thank you for everything
Good luck bro, you're a true king. Thanks for making these videos. I started watching you around my last year of middle school, 8th or 7th grade, I can't really remember now. Now, I'm a junior in high school and will be a senior next year, a senior. Your videos made me think wth I wanted to do in my life, and the answer is, I still don't know. As you said in the video, it's okie not to be okie, and not to know. I'm still trying to find myself, and I wanna live my own life with my friends. I keep debating should I go to college or not, I think I will but ain't sure yet. Either way, thanks for being a part of youtube, and good luck with life, and wherever that takes you
i first discovered you terrorizing your highschool with fat yoshi, i couldn't be any happier for you my man, good luck with life!
mahn... it's been a journey, i'm proud to say that the first video i watched from you is when u were harassing people with fat yoshi pictures; since then i followed your channel to see what more shenanigans you'll pull. it's been a lot of fun watching your videos whenever i would eat and when i feel down. i can't believe that these 4 years passed by so quickly. now that im also graduating, you've inspired me to be "walang hiya", you've given me courage to be who i am with your silly videos and to just really be out there. thank you for sharing your story with us, Anthony, thanks for everything. i wish you the best of luck in you journey.
❤❤❤
Thank you Anthony for letting me watch those four weird years of your life. It was truly an experience.❤
im deep down so sad that ur leaving us but all good things come to an end.  Thanks for everything
Thank you, I used to be scared to grow up and leave highschool but after watching your videos I know that I don't have to stop having fun and you showed me that and for that I am very thankful. Thank you Anthpo
This is so bitter sweet but all good things will eventually come to an end, personally it doesn't have to but for this one it had an awesome run, totally changed my perspective on school in general that it can be actually fun in which unfortunately it really wasn't the case to me, it was mundane at best and horrible to some extent but yeah, good luck out there too if ever!!... 😭💗
How dare you grow up and move on with your life like this 😭😭😭‼️‼️
NOW WHO AM I GONNA WATCH DO WEIRD STUFF   This is so sad
Anthony…. I remember watching your videos back in middle school and thinking, man I want to do the stuff that guy does, I start college this September, just a couple of months to go, you inspired me to make the most out of my high school experience, and I swear I’ll make college even better, because your videos showed me that’s what life is about.  Thank you, I hope you live a happy life and reach all your goals, I hope one day I will be able to look back at things the way you did with this video.
This man lived his life to it's fullest and took us along with him. Thank you for the memorable days uve shared. ❤ From India.
I'll keep this short and sweet, thank you and I wish you the best. As well as anyone else who stumbles across this comment  Stay safe out there
Ay thanks man for everything, I will always remember the fond little memories we made on this channel, but I guess all  laughs and memories must come to an end. Always remember to keep your head up, and bad times don’t last forever! ❤
Thank You.
Forever the goat
Damn he got me crying good
Watching since the first vid, you've inspired me to enjoy and cherish just about every moment with the people around me and make new friends to experience it with, I'm going to miss you, you were an inspiration to me always. Love you man, and whatever you choose to do, we should support it 100%, make the most of your life.
As of this video I’m going into my junior year, just wrapped up finals. Thanks Anthpo for all the fun times, I liked watching your videos because it reminded me of my own good times with my friends. Different college, different state, still a cool ride.
Congrats on graduating 🎉 it’s been some great years🎉
Man I just wanna say go live your life man because I wanna live mines too ✌️
So much to say and so little time. You may never see this Mr. Po, but I just want you to know that you are possibly my favourite youtuber of all time. I'll miss you so much, and I wish you the best of luck on your future journeys. Thanks for everything man :)
oh dear
we will miss you anth take care<3
thank you for memorializing your life so we could be a part of it too :) with your creative talent and humor im sure wherever you end up will be so so so happy to have you. stay safe!!!!!!
o7 thank you for all
thank you Anthony for an amazing adventure. whatever the future holds for you, I hope you have a good rest of your life and continue to learn and grow. you started as just another silly channel I watched but turned into something with lessons and stories that became a true experience. thank you for letting us experience the past few years with you. best wishes to you and your friends/fam
Happy graduation!!!! We will miss you!!!! Thank you for a wonderful few years of great videos!!!
Man i'm just gonna say thank you
I'm being 100% serious when I say that the real Anthpo was the friends we made along the way.
I remember watching your yoshi video. Time flies. 😂 congrats on graduating
thank you for everything you've done for everyone. this channel really is something else and i'm sad to see it's over but it was fun.
Congrats you deserve it thanks for all the amazing content
Don’t be sad that it’s over be happy that it happened
I have been here for a while, and watched as many videos as popped up, I always knew it would end but I never knew now, but right now was a big turning point in my life and I just heard him say to live mine and I’m starting to tear up, while I do want you to make content still as many would, you should live your life, off camera
Bro peaked in college💀
I'm going to miss you. You made all of us feel like a part of your life thank you for all of these years. You've helped me in the lowest part of my life I don't want to let you go but it's your choice. Thank you and goodbye. I love you and you've inspired me. Ill tell my children and grandchildren about you
youre my hero man. this is corny as fuck but youre truly an inspiration to me and i love everything you do. whether its harassing people with fat yoshi or throwing a banquet for all of your friends, ill always be inspired by you. thanks for an amazing few years.
It's crazy to think that I've been watching you since you were harassing people with fat yoshi till now. It's sad to see one of my favorite channels go and I didn't think this day would come.
I know someone will give an update of his life after his college, I'm not saying Anthony himself, but perhaps some years later how his life turned out to be after graduation, it may be inspiring for people who want apply for his college or may be a big disappointment cause in the end nothing really chances POS graduation, but students all around USA need to know some examples that what happened years after you get your degree, buy Anthony I met you with the parodies of AoT opening and I miss your content, I wish the best for you in your new phase in life.
I was here with the Yoshi meme and here with the goodbye
o7
DEAR GOD THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING FAT YOSHI MAN
been watching you since your highschool days and now i seen you graduate.  my first year of college is about to end and seeing you graduate is a feeling that i can describe but im glad im feeling it. thank you anthpo for being the coolest youtuber i ever watched on this platform. best of luck to you.
Bye ig 😊
I always knew that this day would eventually come, yet I didn’t know it would come so soon. I’m so grateful for all you have done for us, the community. I know it’s only been a couple of years, but during those couple of years, you’ve inspired us and made our lives so much more brighter. Thank you for sharing your story with us, and I wish you all a safe journey toward the future. Much Love. ❤️❤️❤️
ive been watching your stuff for years now and all ive got to say now is thank you  thank you for making these funny goofy videos for us im starting my first year in highschool studying about a subject i have zero understanding at (programing lol) and from what ive been told its gonna be a rough two years but theres something from this video that resonated with me "Its ok to okay to struggle" its okay to admit that life isnt just some well paved road with no cracks or  trash on it because that notion is false, Sure life might not be the smoothest ride but it will be the greatest ride we could of ever asked for   so whatever you decide to do with your life from here i wish you nothing but the best of luck and hope you keep living your story to the fullest,  goodbye anthony thx for everything
A bit sad innit
thank you so much for everything anthony, you're truly a great person to us and we all wish you the very best... ❤❤
Best of luck and fun Anthpo and friends!!
Congratulations, I’m sure I’m not alone in saying you will be missed. Go make your dreams a reality everyone
Goodbye ☹️
you were awesome man. you were extremely cool person and i cannot wait to rewatch this channel in the future. you were awesome and really left and impact on me. have a good life. i genuinely watched so many of your videos. hell maybe even all of them. you really made me feel like i wasnt lonely. one thing i always looked forward to was your all episodes of aot season 4. it was awesome man seeing you grow. you really changed the internet for a lot of people and i will miss you. goodbye.
All I can say is thanks man. ❤
Anthony, I would like to thank you so much for what you've done for all of us and teaching me that I can be myself without being afraid. Im about to start college and am extremely nervous but that wont stop me from being my dumb old self and make friends that ill never forget. we all love you Anthony and hope you have a great life ahead of you. :)
it's amazing to see how much time can pass and it still feels like yesterday you've started all these fun videos. congrats to you and your friends for graduating!! and thank you for everything♡!!
Goodbye.
It's been such an honour watching you and your friendships grow anthpo. I know you'll do wonders wherever you go
I feel like you should do a video in like a year or something to maybe tell us all where you are in life. idk man, but congrats and thanks.
your videos have inspired me so much. to go out and make memories. to push myself out of my comfort zone. to live life as much as possible. thank you. as someone who’s getting prepared to start college i can say i hope i end up with a friend group as loving and crazy as yours and a passion as beautiful as what you’ve done with this channel. thank you for being you and changing lives
The remind me of the end of adventure time
I’m abt to cry😭😭 thank you Anthony <333
i'm not crying you are
It’s fucked how sad this is  I’ve been watching since 4 years ago, and it’s just a little cool to think that when you graduated is the same year I’m graduating high school.
wish this is a bad prank
Bye
End of an era! goodbye my friend ❤
Hey anthpo i wrote this song for you:) - You would not believe your eyes If ten million fireflies Lit up the world as I fell asleep 'Cause they fill the open air And leave teardrops everywhere You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare  I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems  'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs From ten thousand lightning bugs As they tried to teach me how to dance A foxtrot above my head A sock hop beneath my bed A disco ball is just hanging by a thread (thread, thread)  I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)  Leave my door open just a crack Please take me away from here 'Cause I feel like such an insomniac Please take me away from here Why do I tire of counting sheep? Please take me away from here When I'm far too tired to fall asleep  To ten million fireflies I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes I got misty eyes as they said farewell (they said farewell) But I'll know where several are If my dreams get real bizarre 'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (jar, jar, jar)  I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)  I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep 'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
Goodbye, Anthpo, you made a best videos of the life! We appreciate you!
ill miss this channel <3
Been watching you since you were doing dumb things in highschool. Didn't think you would even make it to college. 5 years later and countless adventures I'm proven wrong. People can do what they love and still be mature. Congrats on graduating Anthony. I bid you a tearful but joyful farewell. Go live your life. You've given me inspiration to live mine 🥹
Thanks for everything anthony!! your videos meant a lot to a lot of people including me :) truly inspired by everything you’ve done
It has truly, truly been a roundabout path. Thank you, Anthpo
<3
it’s been fun Anthony, not ready to see you go, but life is unpredictable. Have a good life man, glad you graduated.
Bye bye <3
I saw this channel be born and now i'm seeing its final days, it's been a wild ride friend, but life has been better with you, wish you all the very best, than you for everything
Logan Paul is that you
I salute, Thank you for the memories!! Farewell
Goodbye it was a fantastic ride with you , your friends and this  community . This Helped me so much through uni . You got this but most importantly we all got this . Thank you ❤
Been here since the fat yoshi video ✌️ your videos are always full of energy and charm! Wishing you a good time after this adventure, hope life treats you well!
its sad to see you go, good luck Anthony. will definitely do a complete rewatch of all your videos.
best of luck anthpo, thanks for all the memories <3
Bye-bye, thank you
✊
I’m so upset I didn’t expect it to come this soon when he first announced this but now that it’s here I just feel so…idk
Wtf bro I just started watching you
thank you for everything anthpo. congrats on graduating. we will miss you so much.
bye
See ya Anthony
I started watching your channel when it was the peek of the pandemic and now that it’s ending I want to say thank you for giving me joy over these past years.
proud to say i’ve been here since the beginning of it all. crazy this is the end. best of luck out there :’)
Wishing you the best! Kinda at a loss for words rn but damn. Ur awesome
goodbye Anthpo
Addio Anthpo, alla prossima.
Honestly i’m bad at goodbyes but i just want to say thank you so much for bringing a smile to my face every time i watch one of your videos, whether it be you goofing around in a perry the platypus onesie or surprising your friends. Thank you ❤️
This is like ending a comedy show... this will be missed
I could write a long comment, but I won't. It's been a good run. So long and thanks for all the memories Anthony.
I will NEVER forgive you for doing this to me
As someone graduating high school and moving on to my first year of college, I feel like this gives me some type of closure and a hope for new beginnings, I will never forget the bonds I made in High school and my friends and memories will be dear to me even if some of us drift apart. Thank you for showing everyone how to be themselves and how to cherish their life’s, CONGRATS ON GRADUATION
goat
u guys make me so happy
oh god
That was fast. Thank you, Anthony, for making us feel like we were a part of your college experience. I don’t have words for this. Goodbye.
I'm not ready that you really saying goodbye. I just started last month binging your videos because you are so unique to everyone else here in youtube. But I guess, I will still watch your old videos because you give me a reason to have an extraordinary life and enjoy it every moment! Thank you, Anthony! Cheers to your new chapters!
I dont know what else to say. The greatest 4 years of my life since ive found this channel and boy did it changed my way to see everything. Ive learned a lot of you guys; to try out things out of my comfort zone, to always try to give a 100 percent of me in the day like if it was the last one, actually, the biggest thing ive learned was to "try", cause like the warlock said: We are the ones who change our way, not destiny. Its sad to see this path come to a closure, it feels like if I was about to say goodbye to a very old friend. I wish nothing but greatness in the futures of every single one of the crew, but most importantly, a joyful and beatiful present.  It was a pleasure to witness the whole Anthpo Cinematic Universe Godspeed Anthony, we will miss all of you. And always keep the power of friendship, love you guys.
Thank you Anthony You live on in us and we live on in u.   It’s truly been phenomenal. There’s no need for words to describe this experience. We shall always love you. I wish you receive whatever you need when you need it. Lots of love, compassion and gratitude.  Take care friend, Goodbye.
bye bye
There's so many things I could say to express my gratitude since watching from the simple USB mouse flying car. The first thing that comes to mind is, Do we finally get to see the apology videos from the "white people" video? (I bet they were just thumbnails, lol) Who would you recommend watching on YouTube?  Thanks for not being afraid to let your personality show despite what some people may think. I really admired that about you, and I'm sorry you had bad days.   Keep making other people's story better!
This is a pretty silly choice but I understand. Have a nice life Anthony.
;-;
Just woke up, Goodbye man
Thank you Anthony, for sharing your life with us. I am forever grateful that YouTube recommended your channel to me.
Bop...
your videos are so funny and impactful, thank you for making youtube videos up till this point. your amazing!
I’m glad I got to see your story, I’ll miss you. Best of luck in your future!
Your videos have been great, and I’m gonna miss you, man. No matter what path we walk, we’re all under the same sky.
This journey felt way too short , Anthony’s videos truly made us felt like we were a part of his friend group along the way and now that I’m gonna enter college soon I hope to experience that friendship as well
Love you Anthony❤️
DAMN, this is as hard as when we said good bye to unus Annus. it is timed on when it will end with it was a journey with great message. I hope the best for you Anthony and your friends. good luck with your life.
I'm gonna miss you buddy. I've been following you since fat yoshi and even though you are only 1 year older than me I've looked up to you alot. I'm gonna miss you and all your friends too.
First of all, congratulations on graduating 🎉🎉🎉in a couple years and about to do that myself but I’m going to miss you your videos were always amazing and so fun from your first to your last they were some of the most entertaining videos I have ever watched good luck in the real world my friend good and have a good life
Happy graduation and thanks for all the videos! Have a great life 🙏
THE PHILIPPINE REPRESENTATION WAS CRAZYYY ❤️🥰🥰
I know i never met you but damm i will miss you like a friend that changed with me and grew as i grew thank your for letting us feel like a part of your life and thank you for showing me i could live my life as who i wanted to be you are an inspiration
oh god well anthpo is the only person that their videos can keep me so captivated. it started from his perry video, it came back after many years and saw amazing videos. thank you anthpo.
This video hits so hard since I’m a graduating senior in high school. I can’t believe we’re both graduating around the same time. It’s surreal. My favorite YouTuber and I are starting new chapters. This YouTube channel has helped me through high school and helped me not be as scared for the future as I used to be. You’ve heard this a million times already Anthpo, but you really have inspired me and changed my life. And so have all of your amazing friends. I wish only the absolute best for you and everyone 💖 Goodbye Anthpo. Thank you for the laughs, the cries, everything.
Thanks for the memories, I'll cherish them forever❤
have a good life!
The fuck am I getting recommended this for?
Congrats Anthony, hope to see you again somewhere someday
Your videos have brought me so much joy and I wanted to say thank you for sharing your experiences with us! I am really proud of you and I wish you all the best in the future! Once again - THANK YOU!
thx anthony
Thank you for helping me through the hardest parts of my life and through the best I can’t wait to make my own life like you
I found your channel with the fat yoshi vid a few years ago. It’s been a good ride. Have a good life
Dude, you've literally influenced my current sense of humour. Thank you for everything you've done here 🥹
I'll miss this channel so much. Goodbye.
D:
You gotta finish the aot series
Man, fuck it, been watching since the start and its funny to see you grow as a person and have your high school and college memories encapsulated onto here is kinda strange. And seeing how I've grown, and my memories made, it's kinda like so sweet seeing some one elses experiences, thoughts and feelings recorded and it can take me back to my good times and how I felt during those times. That's nice so thank you for that, and thanks for letting me watch your story
Sobbing
it feels rlly comforting but also very lonely that you’ll be leaving youtube. it feels so bittersweet since ur last video is on the birthday today. despite it not going well i wish the best for u and ur friends. i’ll always appreciate ur content as ti always brings a smile to my face! Good luck! :)
I honestly don't know what to say, thank you Anthony and goodbye
Damn who knew that watching one video about a platypus was gonna end up bringing me so much joy and guidance. Thank you Anthony ❤😢❤❤❤❤
Goodbye Anthpo , we are all grateful for the good times
thank you for making me a little less afraid to live life. im still scared of college, but im also excited, so ill do it scared (with you in mind) ‼️
I’ve been here ever since the Fat Yoshi video and I just wanted to say that you have impacted my life so greatly for the better and have inspired me to not worry as much abt the future but to instead be excited for what’s yet to come as I’m going to college in the later half of next year. I don’t feel ready yet to say goodbye but I’m glad you had so many great college experiences with friends and I’m glad you shared them with us.
I’m sure he’ll never see this but thank you Anthpo for dedicating your college and high school years for making this wonderful content. I’m sure anyone here can say that it’s been a wonderful experience and we hope for nothing but the best. Goodbye Anthpo and good luck on your journey.
Thank you so much for all the amazing content over the years, your Chanel means so much to me and so many others. Your truly a special being and one of the most creative people I’ve seen on the internet. Thank you so much for making this Chanel and letting us be apart of your crazy world. ❤(congratulations on graduating🎉)
I've been watching you ever since I was in 6th grade and damn, now that you're graduating, I'm probably going to miss you and your content and your friends. Thank you for the company, anthpo 🫶🏻
I'm gonna miss this guy
To be honest, i am not the longest follower of your channel like most people here are, my first exposure to your videos was the Haikyuu volleyball one lol, but from that point on i've been watching more of your videos, esp the ones where you make something special for your friends or just simply hang out with them. And those videos you made really inspired me to go out and put in the effort to do sth fun with my friends and create memories as well. You really inspired me to live life to the fullest and appreciate and hold on tightly to every single moment i have with my friends! I am graduating middle school and is about to step into highschool, and i'll be sure to carry along all of the inspirations and the motivations your videos have given me to make the most of my highschool years as well! Hate to see you leave yt, but i hope you'll be living your best life in the future! Thank you Anthony for making our life more fun and inspired in the past two years❤
Thank you Anthpo, thank you for this amazing journey. All the best in your future endeavours 🎉
It’s been an honor
its so weird to think that i've been watching your videos since you were in high school, especially the fat Yoshi and Perry the platypus, extremely funny and unique content and its all going to the end. But i wish you the best of luck anthpo! and ofc, ty for making enjoyable vids that i can binge watch, take care.
This is scary for other people and me. I don't think there'll be any other YouTuber like Anthony. He stuck out from most YouTubers and could make the most basic video idea into the most interesting and entertaining video I've seen. But if he wants to continue on without YouTube, I'll respect that choice. Thank you for all these years of keeping us happy.
I don't think my brain has processed yet that this is really the end, but man I'm gonna miss you. Best of luck with whatever you do next.
Goodbye Anthony 👋 🫂 ❤
First of all, congratulations to you Anthpo and to the graduates of batch 2023. Thank you for sharing all the moments you had in your high school and college, you don't know how much it means to me because I grew up watching your vids and it never failed to make me smile. To be honest I was quiet envious on how your high school life and college life is full memories that you can cherish with your friends and can look back into in this channel, but I know that being envy won't do much anything. Watching how you send your goodbyes and how you concluded a final message to share in this video, I am glad that I got to know such an amazing content creator and an amazing person in this platform, I appreciate the message you had given here, your story in youtube is done, but your journey in life is not yet over. Now that I witnessed your part of the story, today I'm going to live mine.  Thank you and Congratulations Anthony Potero! 🎉
Tangina napa iyak pa ako
Amazing… just amazing. I stumbled on this channel one day and I haven’t stopped watching it sense. Each video got closer to zero and I always what the last video was going to be. This is what I was waiting for and it’s perfect. I’m going into senior year of high school next year and I’m about to look into colleges. I’m scared for the future and what I want to do but watching you for the past year or two made me realize that no matter what decision I make… I will be alright. Thank you for everything.❤
Thanks Anthony, you have made my day so many times that I have lost count at this point.  Thank you.
Anthony will be one of the few who can truly say, they did everything they wanted to in their youth. Keep going king, toull do great.
Been watching since Perry and Ben 10 vids, thank you for the laughs and fun moments ❤
I’m not crying you’re crying
This is so weird, it feels like we just said hi, and that you just graduated highschool
As someone who’s been watching your videos since the TikTok house era, I’m a bit sad to see that you’ll be leaving, but thank you for the 4 amazing years. Thank you for sharing with us your memories and I hope you good luck and that you continue to have fun and put a smile on the faces of those around you. Good bye Anthony <3
Imma miss this channel
It’s surreal that this is ending. As Anthony’s 4 years of college is ending so are my 5 years of high school. I can’t believe that it’s over. Thank you for always making me laugh over these last 4 years. Have a good rest of your life ❤
happy trails, anthpo. thank you so much for everything you do!
Goodbye
Im sure you will be successful in life and I wish that we see you again thank you for making us happy and goodbye Anthony
This is the first and only time ive seen this channel and felt what he said at the beginning. Wish I was here from the start
Can't believe it's been 4 years. Loved your videos, Anthpo. Always appreciated the energy and thought that went into all of it. Thank you for all of it. I wish you and the rest of the ACU well in your future endeavours.
Honestly, this is sad, even tho I watched you only 2-6 times, it helped me know how college works. It has been a good 2 years, hope you can reunite, hope you can remind us that "All good things must come to an end", goodbye Anthony. We will always miss you.  I'm just not ready for you guys to stop, i hoped that you guys would continue. You have inspired many people Anthony, you have made people's day, especially the goofy things that you've done to make people laugh, I hope you and your friends have a good future.   I just want to watch your goofy and sometimes educational videos in the future, leaving a comment here will remind me how you stopped, this is just saddening, truly an inspirational man.
We’ll never forget you anthpo. Live your life you absolute legend
Massive W and congrats, big man! Happy to see you graduate and that you had as much fun as possible! Will miss ya man 🤙💖  Edit: MAY 14TH - SAVE THE DATE
You're great, thanks for all the joy. I wish all the best to you and your loved ones 💖
I'll miss you, man. I hope whatever you end up doing in the future, you're happy. Thanks for all the laughs.
Thank you Anthony , these words are too short for expressing my gratitude . From harrassing people with fat yoshi to win an Asian beauty pagent or creating our own pop band you have come a long way, so did i. I learnt many things from u whether it be how to make people laugh or The power of friendship. I was grateful to be a part of this journey . I'll miss you guys every time i'll listen to OKPOP in my playlist. I wish you guys have great lyf ahead and keep enjoying the life same way as u taught us to. And at last i would love to see u guys reunite in far future ❤   Btw it would be funny if leaving us all here was a prank and he would still make vids for us😅
The fact that he capped it up at 69 in the playlist is just aamazing
I was here since the beginning of it all! Just to keep a memorable note if I come back in the future. Thank you anthpo :)
got me emotional man
It seems like yesterday when that phineas and ferb video pulled me to this channel waaaay back then.  time flies
B...b...but... I've just discovered this channel 2 months ago 😢
It feels like forever ago when I first found your channel. I was in high school when your Perry the Platypus video popped up in my recommended, I clicked it out of curiosity, and I’ve been following you and your journey ever since. I’m about to be a junior in college now, and your videos have since made me think deeper about life and driven me to make the most out of the rest of my college experience.  Anthony, thank you for sharing your experiences with us, being a source of inspiration, and for pitting a smile on so many faces. You’ve worked so hard and you deserve some much-needed rest. Wherever life takes you next, I wish you the best!
Should let everyone post a video after some years on here of their future 😢 farewell
I just wanted to write something here before i click off this video. Your videos helped me trough my lowest lows. When i was in a bad place i would watch one of your videos and it would make me feel better. Been here since 2020 and i wont forget this channel. I hope i can get the same power of friendship you all had. You inspired me to not give up on trying to make friends. And now i actually got a group of friends. So thank you for getting me trough tough times and not letting me give up. Thank you💕💕

Goodbye Anthpo
I was here since the beginning... I'll miss you forever <3
Thanks for everything Anthony - the laughs, the memes, and the great vibes. It's been an inspiring and fun ride, I'll miss it. Goodbye
hes like the cool kid from my school whos graduating
what a legend. thank you for everything.
I remember watching you in high school and how inspired I was by you for how cool and confident you were when you were a high schooler. Now I’m in college, and I hope I can make the most of college like you did. Thank you anthpo.
goodbye anthony!! had lots of fun watching your videos and it has encouraged me to try new things in life! i’m going to go live mine now so thank you for everything ! ❤️
Roll credits guys
ahhhh ive been a long time watcher of Anthpo ever since 6th grade now im in 9th grade. Your videos really inspired me to make my own some day, let it be about in my life or through animation, youve been one of my long time inspirations in my life so thank you for everything (*^▽^)/★*☆♪
its weird how now that you stopped college, im starting it, thank you for all the laughs and amazing times, truly amazing
Thank you so much Anthpo for giving me and everybody else a wonderful experience on your youtube channel. You've given me so many laughs, from your avatar the last airbender series, to you winning a haikyuu tournament, and being one of the most creative and funniest youtubers i've ever met. The day that you are now leaving has gone faster than I expected, and I'm glad that you're finding the path you want to go. Seeing you cherish all the memories you made with your friends makes me feel so lots of joy from the amount of wholesomeness your channel has. Your channel has taught me to enjoy the time you spend with your friends, and especially with school, and to just enjoy your life growing up, so thank you for showing me all the fun things you can do in life, and thank you for all your hard work to create all of this content.
This is the best video I’ve ever watched on YouTube, I watched you guys for a long time and seeing this happen was wild, you showed us how fun life can be and everything that’s possible, all good things come to an end and I believe that too.  Goodbye anthpo and the ACU.
bye man o7 it’s been an honor
This could not have come for a better time for me. Im sad to see you go of course but man I haved loved watching you live and grow since those stupid highschool fat yoshi videos and seeing you go on with your life is so inspiring and reassuring to someone who just finished college themselves and is starting to take on the world, experience things I will remember for the rest of my life, and make some of my first big adult decisions. Thank you for being there with me and making me feel less alone in this whole scary and joyful thing. We love you man, thanks for the laughs and content to the end. Make us proud son 🫡
the human experience will forever and always involve two things: love and loss. :)
No 2033 reunion?
I love this Channel and now it’s time to let it go, thanks for sharing all those videos
My GOAT. im for sure making my firstborn watch all of the anthpo cinematic universe
naah he is just messing with us guys, he'll be back.......,right........? right ? 😰😰
Anthpo was an inspiration to my imagination and I really love his videos so much, thank you for creating this masterpiece and thank you for being yourself all these years through ups and downs no one can make a masterpiece as good as this story you told. Thank you Anthpo
see ya! this has been a fun channel but I hope whatever you do next works out just as well.
Thanks
honestly im commenting jus to comment lmao i sure wasn’t here from the beginning, more like just popping in once every few months, but the occasional videos that ive caught have been some of the best ive ever seen i dont really know what im going to do with my life, i dont know what the future holds, but your channel has given me hope that yeah, real friendship exists, and college isnt just all studying and stressing about what come after it  so thank you :)
i might not have been here for the longest time, but your videos have been such a source of happiness and laughter for me. they helped me get closer with my best friend, helped me develop my personality, and made me laugh so hard when i had covid for two weeks. thank you anthony for being such a joy and for being a very silly guy. i hope you do well in life.
It's so sad to say goodbye but it's been fun watching your videos GOODBYE
I am grateful to be a part of this historic moment. Thank y'all for giving me a new perspective on the college experience.
Thanks man
cya, you will be missed
I first saw your vid in 2021 with the diary of a wimpy kid and then I became a big fan. I hate to see you go but I respect you for doing what you wanna do. See ya on the other side brother.
Its sad that it has to end but for the past 4 years you have entertained everyone watching. From "USB mouse making my car fly" to making a kpop group you have been an amazing, funny and great entertainer. 4 years have gone by really fast and I can't belive today is today. All have the friends you have made along the way have been hilarious ( Hanbon collin and gavin are my favs) Your videos are amazing and I always rewatch them no matter how cringy or old they are.   I hope you have a great time ahead of youtube and enjoy the memories you've made over the past 4 years. 👁👄👁
I’m sad that I won’t be able to watch your amazing content anymore but thank you for the inspiration and the laughs over the past 2 years
LOVE YOU TOO ANTHONY AND THE GANG!!!
FAREWELL SOLDIER. ENJOY LIFE
Don't do it chief
I still remember that Attack on Titan summary video I watched when I first time I found you on here and dayum if this video didn't make me tear up. You are a beacon of what life is meant to be. Not perfect. Not always focused on objective things. But rather the experiences, the highs, the lows, the progress toward our goals, and most importantly, the people in your life. I applaud everything you've done, along all your friends, all the fun you've had and entertainment you created, and wish you all the best moving forward; because you've already done what I strive to do: leave the word a better place than you found it. And all the comments prove that! Love you Anthpoa, and I... no WE, will miss you. Take care bud
I have been watching on and off the last couple of years. I simply moved on and my content tastes changed. Good luck in life beyond YouTube! Thank you Anthony.
He'll be back in 7-10 years
This video is directed specifically to me
We all will miss you Anthony 🤧💞
goodbye anthony, thanks for everything.     DAMMIT IM CRYING
So Long Partner.
Who is this stupid cuck and why is he quitting again?  Haha
bye bye buddy
Thank you Anthpo so much for the past 4 years. Even though you are leaving, I'm sure that your videos will continue to inspire people such as myself to push themselves out of their comfort zones and to do things that we love the most. Thank you and I hope that your life will continue to be filled with memorable moments.
I keep saying I'm happy to see this go. But to be honest everytime i think about it I start to tear up. Partly because he will most likely never upload again but also just saying goodbye hurts. It always hurts. I hope somebody can really relate
Thanks Anthpo. Your channel’s brought me so much joy and inspiration. I hope that I can live just a fraction of a beautiful life that you’ve shared with us. I’ll be entering college this September; I’m gonna go out and live my life now. All the best.
Thanks
I’ll miss you😢 I’ve been watching ur videos since 2019, your content was amazing!
I have not known this channel for too long, but the content on this channel is the best stuff I have ever watched, and the creativity levels are off the charts. It's gonna be sad seeing you go, but you graduated college and that's honestly the coolest thing ever. Wishing you the best of luck on your journey, and thank you for the amazing content you have made over the past few years. Goodbye!
Bye I guess
Thank you Anthony. I wish you the best in life and I'm glad I was lucky enough to be here for the journey.   Cheers.
“Don’t be sad that it’s over be happy that it happened”                                                                                                                          - some random meme 2022
From being a platypus, to saving your children as a crab and then sneaking into cults, wow! What a journey it has been.  Goodbye Anthony.  Btw I also graduated previous month, I don't know what I am gonna do , but i am gonna sortit out.
It's sad seeing every good thing collapse before our very eyes in life, but you have to accept that nothing lasts forever (especially the good things)
Im never going to forget this channel. thank you
I think I can speak for everybody and say we are all praying on the opposite of your downfall. All love and excited for everything coming your way
Time to rewatch allll the old videos , good luck with the rest of your life Anthony. We’re gonna miss you🥲
Goodbye Anthpo. Thanks for being you and I hope life treats you well from here on out ❤️
You’ve brought me so many laughs and helped me smile and laugh in my lows, thank you so much and goodbye <3 I wish you and everyone else the best
you'll forever be the 🐐
Honestly it's been such a fun ride to join you on. Through the laughs and the cries, it has all been such an amazing journey to watch. Thank you for giving all 1.65 million of us such incredible content that not only shows how much of an amazing person you are but also how amazing you're friends are. The Power of Friendship™ truly is strong here. Goodbye Anthpo. And thank you for existing. Can't wait to come back to this in a few years and (attempt) to re-watch all of these videos. <3
let’s goooo #1 channel ever🎉
What about AoT S4?
o7
dang... i just started watching this dude like a week ago 😭
We salute you all . About the OKPOP lovin it.🤔😎👋👍😀
You've been a pleasure to watch over the past four years and I hope wherever you end up next will be full of new and exciting experiences. Thank you Anthony. We'll miss you.
Thank you for the memories!!!
watching anthpo videos were the best part of my day
can't believe it's been four years man. gonna miss it <3
Seeing you go from hs senior to college grad is surreal.. you are lucky to have these memories you can watch and go back on. I wish I could say the same 😔
I love you anthpo
best youtube channel ever. ❤
There's so much I can say to you that will never make as much of an impact as you made on me. So I'm simply gonna say thank you Anthony. For everything you did. Goodbye.
Leaving this here to say that I was here since the beginning
hi anthpo! it's been great watching your videos for the past few years, thank you for all the laughs and inspiration you have given not only to me but to everyone else too. thank you for the amount of effort and dedication you put into making these videos. thank you for everything anthony and i wish you the best for the future, goodbye!
I truly wish the best for you jn your future. God bless you.
It’s so sad to see this come to an end, and I wanted to say how much joy you have brought me over the years I have watched you, and how many laughs you have given. Thank you Anthony.
Now on to the corporate world. Congrats on graduating.
i never comment but i want to say that your videos have been a constant mood-booster. from when i started watching the perry and yoshi videos 4 years ago to your college videos now, they’re the perfect example of just living life and having spontaneous fun with friends. thank you for inspiring me to make the most of my own college experience starting this fall, you’ll be missed but all the best for your future!
As someone who has watched the beginning of this channel grow, this is extremely bittersweet to let go of. It was an amazing and inspirational journey of friendship and life that I got to witness through a screen. The genuine emotion and effort each and every video you make is heartwarming--- the impact that you have made to multitudes of people is beautiful. I hope life treats you, your family, and everyone in the videos from these past years well.
Goodbye antpo, I have only been here since the start of 2020 but can say, your videos really have been a highlight. Awhile ago I talked about how you'd be leaving in 30 days while I hopefully would be starting my college life within that time, and so I did get into the college I wanted to transfer to and will be going in August, I really liked the segment of going out and living our own lives now, but watching your videos I can say I have learnt many things, which I will apply to my college life to hopefully have an amazing experience like you did, Thank you, and good luck with whatever you do from now on!
Dang this makes my hearts ache but really thank you so much for all the times you gave us! It's been amazingly fun and exciting!! I could confidently say that anthony is truly the best content creator ever. Also, the Power of Friendship is forever!!
please tell me this is like "pranking my viewers by pretending that I'm leaving YouTube"
Thank u for your effort, for all the laughs, i don't comment a lot but i watched a lot of your videos, seeing this channel grow was wholesome, take care and enjoy your life, hope you have a bright future , we apreciate you Anthony.
Ahhh im literally crying, im a more recent fan of your content but i dont think its made it any less special to me, your videos have been my favorite thing to go back to on a bad day over these last few months and im so happy to be able to say i got to experience this channel even to a lesser extent than others before it ended. You've been a massive inspiration to me in many ways and i wish you the best of luck in anything you do in the future :3 Goodbye
Goodbye
This is the first video of yours I’ve seen. What a way to be introduced to your channel lmao
i’ll miss your content anthpo. thank you for everything and best of luck on your next stage of life!!
man. im crying
gg
Good stuff, I've been watching since fat yoshi so it's a shame to see this channel go, but it was good times while you were here  Good luck with life man, I'm sure you'll go and do great things. 💪
We love you Anthony! We wish you with good luck in the years to come. 🩷
good luck on your next journey
Hey man, we can all agree you've given us all a great few years, with some laughs and some lessons while being in places you shouldn't be. You showed me how important it is to appreciate the moments you have with the people you care about, to make the most of that time. Thanks, really appreciate it.
crying rn
So is he ending the channel?
thanks for existing anthony. :) you made our lives incredibly bright.
ill miss this
Watching your content over the past 4 years has felt like the longest coming of age movie I've ever watched. thanks for sharing your life with us. We're gonna miss you
The only thing I regret is that I found this channel late. Thank you for these videos and good mood. I wish you good health and all the best. I will try to live life so that I can say «I did something”
:) goodbye
Goodbye
I'm going to miss you guys so so so much. I spent the last 6-7 hours just watching your videos, even going back and looking at 8illy's videos :). I hope you guys come back one day because I'm going to miss all of you so much. It felt like I was a part of your friend group in the end.
Thank you Anthony, although i wish for you come back we have to remember.. All good things must come to an end and we should cherish those good moments we have in our life.  Once again, thank you Anthony ♡
I'm gonna miss this so much
Guess I can flex that I’ve been here since 75k now
thanks for the good times man. have a good one
Damn, we graduated at the same time. My ceremony was yesterday. I'll be honest, I was not a consistent viewer of your channel, I would check in every few months to see what you were up to but that was about it. Regardless, as much as being a random stranger on the internet allows, I did feel a connection to you, we were going through the same stage in life. It would be wrong to say that life starts now as the past few years have been some of the best of mine personally and based on this video, some of yours as well. But from now on, things may change but I just hope you just keep being yourself just as you always have. Anthony my man, if you see this in the ocean of comments, good luck in life and have a great time. Oh and before I forget, congratulations on graduating! See you down the road space cowboy.
I started watching you two years ago when your channel has started and it changed my life your channel helped me find my best friends and where I truly belong so I want to say thank you Anthony and I wish you luck in everything you do in the future I will always miss new videos but I’m happy for you and hope you can have the best after college life  possible I will always remember the many things you taught us like don’t write on a wall with marker when playing wii or always eat straws so fish won’t have to and genuinely just be around people who understand your humor. Thank you for these two years of many laughs and tears and while I wish it wasn’t over I will always cherish the memories you shared with all of us I don’t recall where you are from though I can say I give my full support from Boston ma.
It’s been great seeing your videos, your joyful experiences and greatest friends, I and the viewers of your channel had shown never-ending interest in your growth and journey. But every story has an ending, so, thank you. We wish you the greatest in life, Goodbye, Anthpo.
what an amazing ride, thank you for all the great content over the last 4 years! I wish you luck on next phase of your life
I can vividly remember stumbling upon the scaring people with pictures of fat yoshi video and immediately watching all of the other videos you had out at the time. Thinking as to how I, you, and all of us fans have changed and grown during this whole thing is quite crazy to think about. Despite none of us being the same as when we started, you and your videos have remained a constant. Thank You.
thank you for making this 2 years best of my life we are giong to miss you mann😢😢you will always be as legend in everyones heart😢         sorry for my bad english
I was been watching you for like two days and now I see thi🧍‍♂️
we are all gonna miss you man, you fostered a great community
im embarrassed to say ive only recently gotten into your content, but everything I've seen has shown how positive and creative a force you are. It sucks joining just as you say goodbye, but I'm excited to see what you move onto next. Keep up the great work, but never forget these good times.
I WAS HERE
this is crazy, thank you for sharing your experience anthony :)
Goodbye 👋
I don’t think there will ever be a YouTuber quite like you, so overall I’m gonna miss your Style of Contant and the amount of entertainment I’ve gotten just thank you.
Thank you for everything.

o7 anthony
as someone who’s been here from the beginning, it’s so crazy to see everything coming down.  i literally cried the whole video and idek know what to write honestly. you’ve been such in inspiration to me and i hope when i go to college, i can maybe it follow what you did. the memories from you will stick with me for life. thank you for the videos, the laughs, the smiles, and the memories. thanks you for letting me br part of your story, now it’s time to live my own. :))
It’s hard to say goodbye to the things that you love, but when you are ready too move on you move on. I’m glad you enjoyed your college experience we will all miss you and you dumbass energy.
Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.
😢
Having found this channel as part of a silly set of memes, way back when fat yoshi was just uploaded, I never imagined you'd grow into what you became. Reading everyone else's comments, I'm learning just how important and inspiring you have been to so many adolescents finding their way. I truly hope you continue to make the best of life. On behalf of all the internet strangers, we're both proud and grateful of you and everything you've done.
Damn how time flies, wish it can all last longer. But best wishes to all in their future endeavors 🫡
im sure everyones  gonna miss you so much anthony, i wish you luck with whatever comes next for you and thank you for bringing me and others joy with your posts throught the last few years, and thanks to the rest of your group and people we have seen throughout the years!!! im so glad i was able to experience watching your videos and looking forward to seeing new uploads as they came out. once again, I love you all and good luck
:(
I don’t think this man could ever comprehend the inspiration he’s had on this generation. Thank you for letting us all know we can do cool shit anthpo. Good luck to a legend of life 🫡
I wasn't expecting this to make me cry
It was hard to cry at this video even though I’ve been here from the start, just because of how happy you are doing everything you do and the dedication you put into everything you do is amazing and I’m so happy that you are able to do all of this. Thank you for providing entertainment for all of us and just being yourself. It’s sad to see you go but I’m sure we’ll see you doing something big soon enough. Thank you again for everything. 🫡
❤❤❤
1 big W for anthpo, gg, ez and please go get a masters and/or doctorate so we can see you again :')
Cya
You've been amazing these past four years, I hope that whatever you choose to do next that it's something that'll be just as full of happiness and fun as these past few years have been. Good luck to you and all of your friends and thank you for sharing this part of your life and being an inspiration for all of us
I'm not sad, you are. 😢
Mofo made sure there were 69 videos in that playlist.
🤍🤍🤍

It's hard to say goodbye, but it has been great!
I’m so confused what’s happening but I’m assuming you’re moving on with your career. Thanks for all the laughs
Ima cry but it is time to say goodbye ig Good luck :,)
Thank you so much Anthpo. You've inspired me to live my best life, and I'll always be grateful for that. ❤

Thanks to you, I’m not as scared as I was before to enter college. Thanks so much
The way I’m SOBBING

watching you guys all experience these last four years has made me sure that everything will be okay for me in the future. everyone involved with this channel is a massive inspiration to us all. here's a solemn goodbye, and here's wishing you the best of luck in your future endeavors. ❤️
❤
Thank you anthpo, I felt your message burning in my heart, I think that was what I needed. I hope I can live a life that I can look back and be proud.
Loved every bit of this journey Anthpo. This is a bittersweet moment for all of us. Have a beautiful life man, you deserve it.
You’re not going to see this. I know that. But I really just wanna put this out there. You have been the BIGGEST part of me overcoming my social anxiety. I will forever cherish your content for helping me talk to people. Without you I would have never had the courage to meet my lifelong friends and make amazing memories. I wish you the best in life and from the bottom of my heart I wanna say this… THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE’LL MISS YOU !
Thank you for showing me the real parts of life, i feel like most of the internet is so glorified and your content was so refreshing. Especially when i was struggling you truly helped me just by posting your little blogs. Goodbye anthony!🏹❤️
Just because you stopped uploading, doesn't mean we stop loving you
You should do like yearly updates of where you're at in life just something to say hi
Thank you so much for everything dude. You don't know how much joy you've brought me and countless others. Thank you for making this channel and all your goofy silly videos. I hope you and your friends have amazing lives after graduation. :)
Anthpo, thank you so much for your wonderful content and this amazing goodbye video. I’m graduating in 3 weeks and I’m a little scared of what’s to come but your videos make me excited to live my story. Truly, thank you so much.
been watching since ben 10, gonna miss this channel
Subscribing to you was definitely not a mistake, ever since I saw you terrorize people with pictures of fat yoshi I knew this channel was something special. Congratulations on your graduation, good luck to you and your future endeavors.
o7 :(
I've watched you since the beginning so it's a different type of feeling to have watched a youtube channel from beginning to end, but I loved every moment of it. Your videos have been consistently great and I have so many videos from your catalogue in my favorites video so it's just kinda sad to see you go but it's great to see you can do what you want to do and not be held back by anything.
Time to cry. Thanks for everything, Anthony.
You made my years man, glad  found you in my covid days and i  wish you a goodbye
As a high schooler, anthpo has taught me the way of living life to its fullest. Not to spend all day at parties getting wasted (which I luckily have never even thought about), but to spend the most quality time with your friends and family. Thank you so much anthpo, and here's to new beginnings
The legacy
Goodbye, Anthpo. You've been such an inspiration to me, I've even started making my own content on YouTube! It's probably nowhere near as wild and fun as yours was, but I sincerely hope to one day bring the same happiness you've brought to the world, even if I have a fraction of the audience.   From the bottom of my heart,  Thank you.
We will miss you Anthony but as you said this was your story and as much as you are happy that we where a part of it, I guess I speek for all we are happy to it was something so nice to see here in youtube it was not just some challenge it was not just a gameplay video it was pure friendship on this channel and this all was just a nice experience even tho I do not wanna say goodbye I need to so:   Goodbye Anthony I hope you have an amazing life now and maybe come back one time..
goodbye legend o7 fat yoshi will live on
I'm really sad that you're quitting but I wish you the best. You inspire me to be as hard working as you are.
yay
L
gg
literally sobbing this has literally been one of the channels i have been most looking forward to when i open youtube, thanks anthpo and hope you have a great life ahead of you o7
goodbye anthpo.
Good bye anthpo thank you
wait does that mean this channel will be deleted?
At the end of the day, the true anthpo were the memories we made along the way.
ahhh, goodbye, dude! we're all proud of you, and this was a super fun journey!
It's an honor to have been a part of it!
Anthpo, your content has been a personal highlight of this platform throughout these years. I started watching you when I was a freshman, and you were a senior in high school. I loved your content, and I still want to be like you one day - and just live life to the fullest and cherish memories made with the amazing people I meet. Whenever I'm down, I watch you to laugh, and I instantly feel better! It's crazy to see how the ACU grew, and watching all of these familiar faces graduate along with you. So, thank you Anthpo. You made me proud to be from NJ. Greatest of luck on this new chapter of your life, you truly are the best of us.
Crazy how much someone has got so much out of life. Makes me reflect on my own and feel I’ve passed up a lot of things due to my choices. Mad respect.
we were there in the beginning, and now we get to see how it ends
thanks for the ride man, I hope you can live the best life. made my last 3 years a lot more wholesome. there are not enough words. thanks all of u <3 you'll be in my heart, I hope I don't forget the power of friendship 🥹
So long, Paul
:((( goodbye anthony thank you

bye.
The montage and music of it all brings out so much emotions in me that I kept repeating it
Thank u
bye
I just recently started watching your videos, like 3-4 months back. Man you and the crew and these videos have been the best time I've had on youtube ever. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing your experiences with us and teaching us so many things. The most important one being, things in life end, no matter how much we love them, things in life are temporary and thats what makes them beautiful, just like this channel. I wish you and the crew nothing but the best, and again, thank you for everything Anthony.
thank you KING
Auughhhhnhghghhh I've had Alot of things in my life come to an end in these past few weeks and this channel was the littlest in terms of everything but the most painful.  Watching this channel over these past three and a half years has been a long, hilarious, winding and solemn road and now that we're coming out on the other side of it, I can only help but wonder: what do I do now?  I will never forget the hundreds of nights I spent staying up late watching you and your friends stupid videos, laughing my ass off.  I hope that you have an amazing time now that you're out of college, and I know that I will never forget you all.
I have watched you during covid in the thnaf and your content has given me joy i will miss your videos dearly
Truly was fun being here on this adventure of Your fun content. They always really Made my Day
fck I'm crying
I have been watching Anthony since he was in high school. Specifically, the first video I watched of his was when he was handing out pictures of fat Yoshi at his school. And.. can I just say, there will never be another YouTuber like Anthpo. His videos are just so genuine and amazing, and I can feel the love he has for his friends and what he does every day with them through the screen, and I'm so glad to have been part of it.. Goodbye Anthpo, and I hope you go so so far.. take it easy, man. And take care of yourself. Thank you for sharing your life with us.
Congrats Anthpo!!  But also 1:01 ayo?? Is that Janice? 🤔
I think I speak for a lot of people when I say you've been the reason why many of us are a little happier about our futures and lives. Me and my sis will miss you tons. I've gotten a different perspective in life because of you and your friends, nobody has ever made me look forward to my future like this channel has. Thank you, stay amazing.
this was a great journey....
LEGEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
thank you
Crazy
I’ve been watching you since the feudal video when you were in high school. I’ve been 2 years younger then you in schooling and you have always been a huge inspiration. I’m glad I discovered you so long ago and wish you nothing but the best in your future endeavors.
Thank you for inspiring me Anthpo
Thank you man You are a legend
Farewell Anthpo, we’ll miss you <3
As someone who just finished my first year of university, you’ve been such an inspiration for me all these years. Thank you for all the content you’ve created and I hope you have a wonderful life! I’m sure going to enjoy the rest of my experiences
aaaa
everything that can be said has been said. thank you and goodbye anthony!
What a sweet end — congrats 😁
This hits me right in the feels. Anthpo, godspeed and good luck on your future ventures. If you do ever decide to return, do it because you want to please and not because you feel obligated.
Thank you Anthony, we have had an amazing time with your channel.
Thank you bro. Can't express how much you've helped me. Bye, and we love you bro. <3
Even since I found your channel 2 years ago you’ve been my favorite YouTuber and always cheered me up and made me laugh so I thank you so much I hope you have an amazing life and again words can express how much I’m going to miss you but thank you
Here since Perry, wanna document that.
Damn, this makes me feel bad for not being here for the past few years, I feel like I've missed out on so much.
Well, time to say to goodbye
Great 4 years. Now for me to go on my own insane little path.
Anthony, you're a big inspiration to everyone here, to live the life as much as we can, to make experiences, to enjoy every minute of it. I still can't say goodbye, I have to process it. Congratulations on graduating, and thank you for everything!!!!!
Thank you for the amazing content! anthpo will be missed
Thank you man
I loved what you have brought to the community and thank you for sharing your life. I wish I watched you more in the past year or two cause I didnt think you would leave, but it's time for us to say goodbye. Have a great life Ant
I'm not crying I'm not crying I'm not crying I'm not aaaahhh I'm crying
I found you a few weeks ago and I'm not ready to say goodbye, these have been the best past 4 weeks of my life. Thank you.
HE’S WITH JANICE?????
This was amazing.
I remember watching your first video when I was in 8th grade 4 years ago & now im graduating highschool (as a junior if you’re confused abt the math) and about to start college in august. Your videos have truly made an impact and i really want to live life to the fullest at college & watching your videos has helped me see that it can be easy to just get yourself out there & make friends. Thank you for everything Anthony you’re a great man
Thanks for making these awesome videos. I wish you and your friends the best of luck for the future
cya, just started watching 2 weeks ago but still crying.
I got into this channel when I was doing online school for my freshman and sophomore years of high school. I’m almost done with my junior year now and now I’m terrified on graduating and moving on with my life. This channel helped me when I felt like I was isolated from the world and even more after I got back to in person classes and realized some of my friends had the same experience. As sad as it is to see Anthpo go it’s been a great ride and I wish you well on your future adventures. Thanks for being one of the best content creators on YouTube. God bless you
i was here.
Congratulations and thank you for an amazing two years, your content was really fun to watch and I’m glad that I got to watch it. I hope you’ll be happy with the rest of your life.
I remember being back in middle school and I came across the fat yoshi video and ever since I've been checking on to see what you're up too. I remember another really big video I watched was the volleyball tournament one and it's insane to me how it's already been 2 years. Your videos are awesome Anthony and thank you for spending so much of your time into making them. You're awesome and I hope wherever life may take you, that you have yourself a damn good one
IM CRYINGGG ❤❤
kinda poetic for me personally cuz im gonna start college this fall and anthpo is graduating. one story ends and another begins. i hope i can spend these next 4 years finding people and having as tightly stitched bonds as anthpo does with the rest of the acu lmfao
Why am I crying??? Thanks so much for all your great vids and showing us all how to have fun! wishing you the best with all your future adventures! :)
Anthony casually dropping a CLEAR hint that he’s been dating Janice with a couple sec clip lol
Started watching exactly 2 years ago, glad to be part as viewer to this channel hope you can continue with an amazing life
This is like when unas annus ended except it’s not getting deleted
I subbed just after the first Perry the Platypus vid. It’s been one hell of a journey, but we all love and appreciate you and what you’ve managed to achieve with this channel.  So long, and thanks for all the fish.
Anthpo. You have seen me through the last four years of my life. You have laughed with me at my highest moments and grounded in my darkest. You have brought me joy when I needed it and kept me going. I would not be who I am without you, nor would I even be alive. Your channel has been with me for my entire recent life and I would not want it any other way. Thank you for everything funny internet man. Thank you.
i haven't commented on your channel many times before but i've been watching you since you were goofing around in high school so to see how you've grown and progressed in life has been a wonderful experience. i'm now in university myself, and i can say with certainty that you haven't set any false expectations for me---you've really only brought laughter into my life and inspired me to live life to the fullest as well. thank you for everything, Anthony.
idek who this is
anthpo, I just wanna say, thank you for all the core memories youve filled, i am thankful for that one video that kept me watching all your vids, i am so thankful that i was a part of this growing, thank you anthpo for the last time, farewell...
you are the reason i study film.
cheers son      enjoy it, enjoy everything
See you later my favorite white man
I found your channel from the Avatar videos and now it's a goodbye. I was not ready.
Man when i saw this video i felt as sad as i did when i saw the Unnus Annus countdown, never forgetting those days when you scared random people on parking lots. Thank you, Hope life guides you well Anthpo (who is quite possibly the funniest fastest channel ever)
goodbye anthony! you are a huge inspiration to me and i hope one day i can recreate the same amount of happiness for my future as you have made in these past 4 years. we love you and good luck
i dont think im ready to say goodbye
This channel helped me when I was in an incredibly tough spot, I watched all of your content from the very beginning and I’m about to graduate next year to college and all I can hope is that I can connect to people like you have in your time on YouTube that you shared on here
wow being with you since the yoshi video makes me put this all into perspective. This is crazy. Proud of u big man
You the best
I love your videos Anthony and I wish nothing but happiness and success for you in your future journeys. Goodbye we will miss you❤
Thanks Anthpo & everyone for this wonderful journey. I remember the day the fat yoshi video was recommended to me around nearly 4 years ago. I thought the idea was kinda dumb (I still think so), but there was some charisma that made me keep watching your other videos as well. They gave me the best laughs, as well as a better & more positive attitude towards life. I'd say watching your videos changed the way I wanted to live my life. Congrats on graduating and I sincerely wish y'all the best! 🎉
Thank you Anthony and the gang for all the memories and videos, wishing you all the best
Aw, man
good bye anthpo. thank you.
Damn rip
This day snuck up so fast. I can’t believe it’s over, as someone who’s been watching since perry the platypus, this is an extremely emotional moment for me and I’m sure the entire community. Thank you Anthony.
The only words that come to mind after watching that video is Thank you; well done and good luck I hope the future holds nothing but good things for you.  From what I could tell through your videos is that you are a genuinely good guy and your only goal was to make others laugh. I guess my one wish would’ve been to see more videos lol.
good luck anthpo❤
I’ve been watching your stuff since I was a freshmen in high school and now a week away from my graduation it feels almost surreal for you to say go live your own story. Thank you for all you’ve done it means a lot. I and many others won’t ever forget you  :)
Have a good one
thank you for all the laughs ❤
Goodbye, legend
I remember finding this channel back in the fat yoshi days...  Thanks for everything Anthony, and good luck.
damn, love you anthpo
this is so sad as a senior graduating highschool
Watched tou since Perry Platapus video. Good luck, and thank you so much for the videos that portray beautiful, cheerful and friendly side of human lives. Goodbye Anthpo, and see you soon
He came in amazing and went out even better. I’ll miss your channel a lot Anthony. Thank you for making my days a little brighter ❤
I'm here since 2019, and is been a long journey, i laughed so many times, when i was feeling bad, the videos cheered me up, and im gonna miss all of it, all of the people that were in these videos, and specially Anthpo, thank you Anthony, for all of it
There isn't anything I can say that hasn't already been said, but this channel is the best example of true best friends. I'm still in high school, but I hope this is the type of shit I do I'm college.
Thanks, mate. And congrats. Have a good one.
See you in 10 years :)
I'm Going To Miss You😭
Goodbye Anthony, you’ve been the most real YouTuber I’ve ever experienced, and you’ve made my days so much better.
i’ll miss this
Have a great journey Anthpo, maybe we'll see you again in the future, who knows. It's been a fun ride, thanks for making us laugh and making me laugh.❤
It’s always so weird, almost like confronting mortality in a sense when someone decides to move on from their youtube channel after being a constant in so many peoples’ lives. I’m just one in a sea of many comments, but I still want to leave at least a goodbye.
I was here! I’ve been here for four years man and I’m sad your leaving. Don’t cry that it’s over. Cry because it happened.
I've been watching anthpo since freshmen year of high school and as of right now I'm going to college in 2 months and honestly if it weren't for these videos I wouldn't have been this excited to meet new people, now I know it's different for everyone but I really do wish I could experience something like this, thank you anthpo for helping me find the drive to go and live my life, make new friends and be myself, and thank you for your friends who made these videos a thousand times more enjoyable goodbye anthpo and good luck on your journey through life
A few years back, this random video of this random guy dressing up in a Perry the Platypus outfit popped up in my YouTube algorithm. I watched the vid, had a good laugh, subscribed and honestly forgot about the guy. I watched a few more vids here and there from the channel, and it just stayed in the back of my head that, yeah there's this channel in my subscriptions that uploads pretty funny videos from time to time. And then the last two years happened. It has been so great to watch Anthpo finish his college journey. I am about to start my college in a few days, so it's a bit special. Thank you for everything, Anthpo. I'll miss you. I wish you the best of luck with your life.
Bye! You made me have good laughs :D
Thank you❤ Just a big huge thank you for not only the amazing content but most of all teaching the importance of life and friendship. 🥹 I will miss this channel so much. Alas, good things always have to come to an end. Will take time to process but it is life I guess, one chapter ends and another begins, but we hold on to the memories we made.
Thank you so much anthpo for making these videos. I will start my college this year and I guess I know what I  want to do in college & enjoy it. I will miss you so much. All the best for your future
damn,thanks
make sure you come back in 10 years for the time capsule!
goodbye anthony
true feeling of content and happiness. you inspire me
I am currently a senior in high school and I have been so scared thinking about what will happen in the next 4 years of my life. You have shown me what it means to live life to the fullest, and I hope that I will be able to look back at this channel and think of some crazy things of my own that I will hopefully be able to experience with a group of friends. Thank you for posting these crazy shenanigans and for making me laugh at times when I hit rock bottom. I am excited for what is to come in the next chapter of my life, and I hope that you will be able to have some more crazy experiences later in your life too. Thank you
I’ll admit i haven’t even been the most regular viewer for this channel, but i’m still emotional like damn
Everyone else's comments sums up what I would say lol. Been here since the fat yoshi vid and I've been loving the videos ever since, thank you anthpo.
thanks man, all the best <3
I’m crying agh seriously dude thank you for everything, wishing u the best in life 🩷
I’m not ready to say goodbye. As much as I’d want you to stay, I understand full well that all good things must come to an end. I’m so happy that I got to experience your story, and I hope that I have as much fun as you in college. You’ve been such an inspiration in my life, and it’s so hard to say goodbye. You’ve been all that I could have ever asked for and more. I love your story, and I hope that when I start mine, you’ll love it too. I can’t wait to see where you go. Thank you for everything you’ve done, Anthony. Love, Raymond Klimbal Ps, you’ll see me on YouTube one day, maybe
Been here since day 1 and I truly gonna miss Antpho. Thank you for making this journey of incredible highlights and making the college experience more bearable.
This was such a beautiful journey to witness. I wish health and happiness to All of you, aswell as luck in the future. This really Was such an amazing thing that you all pulled off together and saying goodbye is obviously very tough. But we'll never forget This.
I can't thank you enough for making my hs and college years a little brighter than i've ever thought, we're going to miss you Anthony, but i'm sure we all hope the best for the future and we'll always be rooting for you.  thank you man, for everything.
Thanks for everything man !
One of the greatest channels to have existed. Thank you for being an inspiration and bringing so much joy with your videos!
gonna miss you, wish you the best
goodbye Anthony I havent fully seen your entire story but what i have seen from it its been hilaurous and also congrats on graduating
All good things must come to an end. This is another comment that probably won’t be read to say the same two words: Thank You. Anthpo, you have created amazing content, yes, but so many people have been touched by your content that it’s impossible to determine the impact you truly had. All I can say is that it’s certainly a great large positive one. I have fond memories of finding your channel for the first time and seeing your video of the Avatar series summarized, and scrolling back on what I found to be one of my favorite channels. I remember finding your Ben 10 in high school, and loving every moment of the shenanigans since. You are a delight, and your commitment to ending the channel on this date, even when you were already so burnt out, is a true testament to your character as an amazing person. You deserve the world, and I truly hope you’re able to find happiness and fulfillment out in the great unknown. I realize that you’re not likely to read this, but I needed to convey this in some fashion anyways, because of the great happiness that your videos gave me, if I had a 1/1000 shot to make your day better, it’s a chance I’d have to take. I hope you find your happiness. I hope you find your peace. And I hope that someday I can meet you, to tell you all this in person. Good luck, mate. Farewell.
Thank you
YOU AND JANICE???
Im going to miss you anthony
a sad day for youtube
Thank you, bye.
This feels like the grand finale of a big adventure, because it is.  I wanna be like you Anthony, just having fun with friends and enjoying life.

Good job man, keep on enjoying living.
I can’t wait to come rediscover this channel at the end of high school and the end of college. Good luck on the rest of life anthony
It’s been a wild ride. I first started watching your channel when I got into total drama and I saw your total drama backyard video. Since then I watched your videos. They have inspired me to get into film production and I’ve made all kinds of fun stuff. Though I’m quite sad to see this is the end I hope things go well for whatever you do next in your life Anthony. Thank you for everything
Forever thankful for these videos. Thank you, Anthony
congrats dude
Hey Anthpo Ik you probably won’t see this but your channel has meant a lot to me and gave me alot of laughs when feeling down and seeing you and your friends having fun has inspired me to make the most of me and my friendships. I hope to grow up and live a good life like you and make every moment count. (Also I have a friend graduating from high school this year and now I have you and him leaving I am heartbroken >:( ) goodbye antpho I will miss you 🫶
Thank you for the laughs bro 💛 Wish you all the best. Goodbye 👋🥺
I honestly thought i was getting jebaited, but i have to accept this is real. Thank you for all the videos you have posted all these years❤
I'm on my first year of college, I wanna quit so fucking much
Congratulations on graduating! All the best in your next chapter. Goodbye 💜
Anthpo, I know you don’t know me, but I’ve been a fan ever since Fat Yoshi. Thank you for sharing your story, and for letting us be a part of such an amazing journey. It’s been a wonderful adventure, and just as you have the rest of yours to live out, we have ours as well. I wish you nothing but the best moving forward. Much love brother ❤️
Congrats anthpo while I watched on and off when I did you brought me allot of laughs when they were needed I wish you the best of luck wherever your path leads I believe you will continue to lift people up again best of luck to you wherever you go
I’ll never forget that first yoshi vid I saw. Goodbye Anthpo
goodbye anthony :(
Thank you anthpo for everything 🫶🏼
This is an end of an era. Thanks for all the laughs, smiles, and inspiration. Please keep being you, because so many people like you for who you are. I wish you the very best!   P.S. Why he dressed like Arthur tho 😂
I just discovered this chanel last month. And you inspired me a lot to live my life. Thanks for everythings anthpo
bye :C
Thank you, you’ve inspired me in more ways than you could ever know
i found you way too late 🥹 like last two weeks late and it has been wonderful to see your videos 🫶🏻 i love seeing you and your friends enjoy life <3
It’s over already, how time flies lol
I'm seriously going to miss this channel. It was like watching someone grow up with you, and now just like in real life with real friends, you just decided to go down a different path than us which is totally okay to do. Thank you for sharing your journey with us and I hope things go well for everyone here
:(
I just hope you guys continue being friends even after college.  See you around, Anthony.
I love you so much dude. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. ANTHPO FOREVER BABYYYYY. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Your friend group is near and dear to me because of this channel. They're so sweet and you all care for each other so much. As someone who has always struggled with making friends because of autism, this gave me so many good vibes. And I am so happy that you got to share these moments on and off screen with these people. And it also gave me hope that there are people out there who are genuinely nice and kind-hearted. Best of luck and congrats on graduation!🎉
This channel is a beautiful little snapshot of how it felt to be a young person living in this specific time and place, and I think that's really valuable. Sometimes I wonder what we would see if, for all of human history, the average person had been able to make recordings of themselves and their friends having fun like this. I hope Youtube stays alive, in some form, and people in the future are able to look back and see how much of human nature stays constant throughout history. No matter where or when you go, I think people will always be goofing around and having fun.
you are my standard of how I want my college experience to be. You just graduated from it and I am just going into it. Good luck and thank you
I'm bawling. I wish you well in life.
thank you for a good 2023, live your life to the fullest!
I have been watching you since your videos in high school and I have loved every single moment of it. You are an insanely creative and talented creator, and your work on YouTube will be missed. Thank you so much for all that you’ve done, and congratulations on graduating!
It's been so fun of a journey, thank you Anthpo for the weird random videos you've shared with us💜
Goodbye friend happy travels
Thank you, Anthpo. You were always one of those creators I would see random videos from, no matter how obscure the subject was, or how long it had been since I checked your channel out. Nonetheless, I've looked up to you, and you've been an inspiration to me. Godspeed. o7
I’m gonna cry 😢I’ve loved your channel and I can’t wait for you and your friends to look back on your channel as a time capsule of what you’ve achieved in your college years
Have fun in life
We understand, thank u for everything hope ur life becomes what u show us
Don't usually comment much, but thought I'd leave one on this occasion. My 'college' years are over, it was sadly a 3 year degree lined up with 3 years of covid. Australia, Victoria was one of the most strict in the world with lockdowns. So it was fun to live through these memories you've captured during your time on Youtube. Wholeheartedly... Thank you.
I'm sad it's over, but what you've done for so many people will continue to have an impact even after this channel is gone.
NAHHHHHH MANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN COMEEEEE ONNNNN I RESPECT THE DECISION GO DO MASTERS AND THEN MAKE MORE CONTENT YK WHAT I MEANNNNN AYEEEEEEEE
I literally found your channel 2 days ago, sad to see you go
Thank you Anthpo. I've been here since your highschool stuff and every second, every episode, every single video I can say has 200% been a good use of my time. Thanks for the good times
been here since beeg yoshi, and I just finished my first year in college, and the way I've put myself out there is due in a large part thanks to you, and I couldn't be happier with the friends I've made so far. You're an inspiration.   Thank you.
I remember finding you back when you posted videos about high school, I'm so happy I got to be here for your journey. Here's to many more amazing moments in your life, Thanks for everything, see you on the flip side <3
Been watching since you blew up in 2018. Weird seeing you go. But I'm glad I got to experience your channel. Goodluck!
Thank you so much anthpo for all the joy that you've brought to my life. I still have a little over 2 years before I enter college, and your videos have been a blast to watch. I couldn't help but tear up, watching this final video. We love you so much man, and everything that you do ❤❤
Goodbye man, thank you for all the happiness and love you spread Hope we will see you some day Just keep Enjoying life🎉
One of the 3 youtubers Id go out of my way to watch every upload for. So long and good luck
It’s weird that four years have passed, your videos have been a great source of entertainment for me, I’ve always looked forward to all of your new and fresh ideas. It’ll be odd, the absence of your new videos popping up in my recommend, but thanks for sharing your life with us. Have a good one Anthpo.
I been here since the Ben 10 video days.  Thanks for everything.
I don't think I can walk away from this video without writing something here. I started watching your videos in 2020 during the pandemic. I was 13 and extremely isolated; I had lost contact with all my friends, I had no one to share my moments with on a daily basis, and I spent way too much time online. I started watching this channel and your videos made me feel like I could vicariously be part of a friend group and do wacky, fun things. Over the course of 3 years, I continued to watch your videos. I started going back to school in person. I fell out of some friendships, and made new ones. In the past year, I have begun to have the experiences I once only saw on my screen—sometimes silly, sometimes heartfelt moments with amazing friends. Now I'm 16, almost 17, and I have changed so much and grown to a much happier and healthier place than I was in 3 years ago. It makes me so emotional to think about the growth I've seen in this channel alongside my own life. Now that we are finally seeing you go, Anthony, I feel a sense of peace knowing that you will continue to live life to the fullest, and you've given me many little moments of inspiration to do the same. I say thank you because I mean it. Your work has meant something special to me and the others who've stuck around for every last shenanigan. Never change <3
This feels like an end of a TV show
I came close to tears watching this. I’ll miss you 🎉
Fuckin A man. It’s rare to see channels have an actual happy ending - one that isn’t caused either by controversy or a slow decay. Your videos have consistently made me laugh and cheered me up when I’m having a bad day. Whatever you choose do next, I wish you well. Good luck!
ty Anthony for all the fun memories I’m glad you are moving on
I didn´t watch all of your videos every time they were released, and I wasn´t here for all of those four years, but I still feel a little bit sad that you´re leaving. However, I hope you do even more great things and I wish you the best of luck in whatever path you choose!
I’m graduating high school next year and you give me the courage to have hope for my future, Hope you go far
not unus annus 2
I hope to meet friends like y’all in university
bye na
I cant believe this is it, you’ve inspired me to do a lot of stuff, I make videos for my class inspired by your style I hope where ever you start your new chapter, its going to succeed, thank you, po.
o7
Im sad that your not gonna post eny more but there is the upsid of this channal not gonna go too long that it gets boring
This is still so crazy, but I WAS HERE I WITNESSED ONE OF THE BEST CONTENT CREATORS AND HIS JOURNEYS!
Big love Anthony, anything you do, wherever you go, BIG LOVE
So he really dated Janice 😊😊😊
this has been the best four years of my life, I'm gonna miss you so much, and I may or may not be crying while writing this...i love you so much man
I know that you probably already had thousands of people tell you this same thing but we will all miss you a lot. I’m not saying you have to but maybe you can give us a little life update like once a year in a short video. I just don’t want to completely see you go
alright. see ya
Goodbye anthpo it was a really nice 2 years with ACU and thank you so much for your hardwork all this time. Hope you succeed in whatever you want to do next, cheers!
Just started rewatching him. Why
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. this is so sad. thank you anthpo😭🫶🏽🫶🏽
Man.
peril of the generations of the stars.
You brought me laughs that got me through a rough patch in my life. Thank you Anthony 🫡
thank you
I remember watching this back when I first moved to the United States back in 2019, and this entire channel really helped me find my identity, thank you Anthony, you’re amazing
I remember when one of your videos from highschool first popped up. It was early on but i kept checking. I am proud to say I have been a fan for so long. I wish you so much luck with this next step in life. And thank you.
your channel is so special to me cuz it’s the last thing i properly watched at my high school before the pandemic hit. me and a friend in my advisory watched some of your videos alone while everyone else in our advisory was out and it was the last time i ever really saw them. we were never close but they were always my buddy during that class and so you running around in a Perry the Platypus onesie will forever be a cherished memory of mine.
Thank you, Anthpo.
Later king we'll miss you honestly the most well hearted youtuber on this platform you're funny you give life advice you the full pakage been watching you since the perry vids i'll miss you we all will later man😭😢😢
I’m so emotional over this. I was here from the start and seeing you go is just breaking my heart. Wish you the best luck on your future endeavors, we’ll miss ya!

Has it really been a year?

Even if I wasn't there since the start, words cannot describe how grateful I am to have you share your memories and highlights to the world. All I can say is: Thank you Anthony. You've been a big inspiration to me, and i'm happy that this channel happened.
I started watching since the fish costume it’s been nice goodbye I’m gonna miss you
Happy graduation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
👏👏👏
Goodbye anthpo i loved your videos ever since 2 years ago, Goodbye anthony! <33
Man I'll miss waiting Anthpo
Fuck man, this is... I don't know like that 1 friend that leaves and finally grows up until they become a distant memory. Thank you Anthpo for well a hell of a watchlist I've done by watching you, and I'll always remember the laughs and those bubbly feelings I got watching you transform from Ben 10, Perry the platypus, Fred, to Anthony. Thank you and don't worry we'll be waiting for you.
I've been watching you on and off since you were in high school. I am a 21 year old shut in, and let me just say that you inspire me to go out and live life. Your videos make me feel like going out and spending time with friends is worth trying, despite all the anxiety and heartbreak. We know you'll do great things Anthony. Thank you for sharing these happy memories with us. You were a fresh of breath air in the youtube atmosphere and I thank you for that. It's like, these are genuine memories you've created. It just makes me so happy. Your videos were worth the time I spent watching them. Thank you for everything, thank you. Good luck in your next adventures. I believe in you.  I'm so sad that I didn't buy the paul plushies when I got the chance lol.
Good luck Anthony. Wish Tony P my blessings. 😢 Have a good rest of your life and keep working hard man.

I’m so grateful for you, your friends, and this channel. You guys have helped me smile even when it was a really non smile day. I know each and every person in the Anthpo cinematic universe will leave and accomplish great things. Thanks for sharing these amazing videos, Anthony. I’m glad you sent gonna like mass delete them to show that time is short haha. Whenever I’m feeling down, I know where to look. It’s been an amazing journey.

Now I gotta do something with my life now damn.
I’m starting college soon, and this gave me so much hope. Thank you, Anthpo. Good luck with whatever you do after this. You have your whole life ahead of you.
It really hurts to say goodbye. You've truly been an inspiration. Thank you, Anthony!!
As I approach the end of my college freshman, all I remember is staring at my phone.  I wish I was in US university to have a memory like you.
Bye Anthony, thank you for everything.
Goodbye Anthony, you made 2 years of my life really happy, wonderful and fun. I would love to do something like this in the soon future. All I have to say is thank you 😊
Good luck on the last few chapters in your book brother
what about okpop ?
😭😭😭
Thank you for everything, your channel is one I will always come back to in the years to come
I've grown with Anthpo since my freshman year of high school. Now knowing four years later we both are graduating from our schools at the same time is really reassuring. Cause if Anthpo can make lovable videos, graduate from his college and looking forward pursuing to his new future life, (and I can speak for everyone here who are graduating at this time rn too)   I think we can do just fine
Thanks for everything everyone, and good luck
Farewell Anthony

Will these videos stay? I love coming back and watching you guys having fun.
Alrighty, see you.
Man. I wish I could've watched you earlier, it's been like a year and a half since I started watching you. I wish I could've been watching you from the start.
Was anyone thinking it was gonna be Anthpo and Hanbon dating and not Anthpo and Janice? Thats a crazy surprise but I'm glad they are happy together.
Making me cry fr
i genuinely am going to miss this channel sm. i didn't find this channel very long ago. i remember seeing your volleyball video and just watching a bunch of your videos. i m currently in high school and really struggle w/ mental health and just not feeling okay and your channel has helped me so much. i always know where i want to go to watch something funny, or entertaining, or just fun. thank you for the past couple of months. i hope you do amazing things in life and never stop having fun. never stop enjoying life. never stop being you. goodbye!! <3

I thought he was gay
I’m going to miss your videos Anthony
Happy Graduation and thank you for the best past 2 years, Take care!
Your videos have been such an inspiration to me. They have inspired me to come out of my shell. To make friends. To not be afraid to be myself. And for that, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I will miss your vids, but I am so grateful for them while they came out. Take care, and have a good life <3
Congrats on graduating !!!! Thank you for entertaining me for these past few weeks. I found your channel late as hell. I wish you the best on your next adventure!
I graduated too. I graduated from Raritan Valley Community College Yesterday and moving onto Rutgers. I wish you the best.
Can you at least finish making the every episode of attack on titan. At some point in the next next decade.
Never consistently tuned into you but I was def here before the blow up n idc about that generally just want to include it, but you came off so dope n Ik you’re a human like the rest of us so I hope that you live a wonderful life stress less and find peace and understanding as you progress you seem like a cool ass dude that I haven’t met and even your friend group is polar opposites from mine
Goodbye, know that we all love you!
Adios old friend. Till next time
Im not gonna give a long wonded explanation of how i feel or how long its been all i want to say is thank you for the journey
🫡 Goodbye Anthony!
Whenever I was 12 years old, I found your perry the platypus video and thought it was one of the funniest videos. I wanted to *be* like you, confident, funny, etc etc. I watched your older catalogue and found myself laughing along at each one of your antics, as if I was there too.   Then, you graduated high school, and I couldn’t wait until the next series of videos came along with college. They were all just as fun as the old ones, but I soon started to notice something. Your videos started having *gags* p-p-p-positive messages 😟. Initially I was opposed to this, but as I grew as a person I appreciated these more.   Then, the bad times came. 2020 was a rough year for me, your videos, both the old ones of you messing around at school, and the new ones, of you on a greenscreen making tv show parodies, were one of the few constants in my life that I could always rely on for a laugh.   Then, as life returned to normality, you returned back to campus, and your videos were as good as ever, great ideas, alongside the introduction of a bunch of new friends to laugh along with. It was nice, but over time, it just became a thing in my life that was always happening. Years passed, but I’d still always see you in my feed, and you would still make me laugh. I saw you do event after event at your college, which then made me think of when was this part of your catalogue going to end?   I didn’t have to wait much longer though, as you soon posted a video claiming that in a set amount of days you will graduate, and stop making videos. Initially, I thought it was sad, but not to worry as we still had plenty of time. But time waits for no one, especially those that waste it. So as time flew, that clock ticked down and I grew more and more dreadful of the end, and honestly just sad seeing one of the most creative minds on the platform leaving so soon after blowing up.   And then comes today. It’s dumb that I’m so overcome with emotion for someone I don’t know, but as someone with several close friends graduating this year and next year, it hit me hard. I don’t know what the future holds for any of us, the past is best left in the past, so that only leaves us with the present:  Anthpo, thank you for the years of amazing content. You’re genuinely a once in a lifetime creator, which makes your early exit all the more sad. I, personally, will be inspired by your content and character as a human being for the foreseeable future, and I believe I’m not the only one. I hope you find happiness, joy, and peace in your next journey. Hopefully I will as well. Until then, I think I’m gonna relive this journey, one last time, before I begin my own. Thank you. Goodbye, Anthpo.  Much love, Jake.
Thanks for making videos man appreciate it and bye😁
I found your channel back when you were graduating high school and I was starting at a new college after taking a break from my old one. Your videos brought me so much comfort and so many laughs, especially during and after the pandemic when all my closest friends graduated and I had to keep trucking on. And after I graduated and was really missing school, watching your content made me feel a bit more at peace. The job hunt has been pretty rough (at least in my field) so I really hope you're able to pursue your dreams and that everything goes smoothly. Everyone on here has such a bright future ahead of them <3  I haven't watched every video over the last half year or so, because I wanted to have some new ones left after this. I'm looking forward to watching them :) Thank you for sharing so many incredible memories with all of us; it makes me happy to think that everyone in the ACU have these videos to look back on, that their time together gets to be preserved in such a wonderful way. To Anthony, and to everyone, thank you from the bottom of my heart. It was an incredible ride and we'll all miss you, but you're going to be amazing. Good luck out there! We're all rooting for you <3
love u man. hope u have a great rest of ur life and find a whole lotta joy in it <3 thanks for sharing all these memories w us
I've been here for both graduations, wow 😭
I remember my friend showing me the perry the platypus video and it’s been great seeing everything goodbye man
Man, the journey was wild, I got to share this college journey, but you’re leaving a year before me :( I’ll miss you brother. I almost went to Rutgers too
It makes me so happy to see who you have become over this time
Man im gonna miss you so much, I hope there's an Anthpo reboot one day. <3
o7
Goodbye anthony for all the good laughs I have watched you for years on different accounts you will be missed.
I've been watching your channel since middle school, even took some of your ideas to try on my own. I graduate next year and just wanted to say thank you for being an inspiration to your fans to get out and have fun and for making such amazing content.
goodbye anthpo! ive seen a few of your videos and they had made me smile. continue living like a king :p
Literally found this channel today wtf.
This feels so bittersweet, but glad I stook around till the end :,)
damn bruh thats crazy
truly going to miss you. these videos gave me a light in my life during high school. thank you for all your hard work, we are all so proud of you!
you made my life a better place, and i will always thank you, and your friends for that.
this feel so unreal, been here since the day Yoshi but now look we’re we ended up, I wish you the best man!
Thanks for everything Anthony
Goodbye
bro i just recently discovered this channel and now hes going away? I didnt know that what
Ain’t no way he stole my girl Janice
Thank you so much Anthony for the past two years. Your videos got me through some hard times, and I have never seen anyone on this platform as genuine and kind as you. You deserve all the success in the world, and I’m so happy you brought all of your fans on this journey with you. You deserve the world bro :)
69 videos Until Graduation is so crazy 💀😭 was that even intentional
You need to make a compilation video for all of your best Antpo vids.
I knew it was Janice
Man that it’s time to create your own story is hitting hard cause I’m starting college in the fall it feels like a passing of the torch. Thank you for all the great content over the years you’re videos have given me constant joy and I can’t be more thankful good luck on all your future ambitions 👍
I'm one of many who watched your videos as a high schooler and are now at the beginning of their college lives, and I can't thank you enough for letting us come on your journey with you, Anthony. You and your friends have truly inspired us to be more brave and to live in the moment (the good and bad ones alike) and we'll all carry that with us in our hearts. Wishing you the best on everything you do <3
Thank you Kanye, very cool
I really had a great time anthony. Thank you for all!
Thank you Anthony! This channel and your hijinks were a joy to follow along these past few years. Don't let anyone make you feel like you owe the internet any more of your time if it's not what you truly want.
Good bye Anthony! Thanks for all the memories :)
Thank you bro.
I have never heard of you in my entire life, But I wish you luck on the rest of your life
FIANLYY IM SICK OF THIS SAPPY STUFF 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
i remeber the beginning and i cant belive im seeing the end you did it anthony great job.
Unus Annus, Daft Punk. All over again 😔 goodbye will miss u.
No wait im not ready yet 😢
I found your channel about 2 years ago, and I was always so happy every time there was a new post from this channel and I couldn’t wait to see what came next in your adventures. Your channel has taught me to cherish every single moment that I have and have as much fun as I can and has encouraged me not to give up. Your channel has inspired me to have crazy adventures of my own and has inspired me so much. Maybe I’ll start a channel like yours one day and share my own experiences. Finding your channel and following your experiences have been so memorable for me. Two years have gone by so fast. Thank you, Anthony, so much for everything, and I wish you all the best. Farewell. <3
Bye bro
bruh i just started watching you i anit even get to watch that long :(
Sad that it’s over but at least we can look back and rewatch all the memories  This channel still has all the videos and we can be grateful for that My favorite was the volleyball tournament videos it was wildly entertaining and had some really great energy Thank you Anthony!!! ❤❤
Good luck out there, I wish you the best. Your content was amazing, it gave me so much joy during my really sad times. I'm really gonna miss you. Tou don't know me, but you mean a lot to me, so I want to say. Thank you. For everything.
Damn, he made it, hope the best for him going forward
When he said it’s time to live my story it really hits hard for most now during the end of our school year especially those going int high school just like me and those graduating or going to college. Thank you Anthony we all wish you a goodbye
Farewell, King.
i will miss u! Thank you for the memories you shared, i wish you the best luck.
i’m not ready to say goodbye😢
thank you for everything, anthpo.
I’m glad I found this channel in the beginning it’s been a fun ride also screw you for the water works 😭🫡
I remember stumbling across this channel in late 2019 and having been absolutely hooked since then, and I just want to thank you for all the laughs. It's been one hell of a ride and I'm sure this next chapter in your life will be just as great. Once again  Thank you
This is the college experience I hope I have, and I'm so grateful that I now know how to have it; because of *you,* Anthony.   I've been watching these videos for about 2 years, and every single one was better than the last. Being able to watch this journey, watch you and your friends grow was an absolute gift. It's a beautiful ending to a beautiful story, and I hope that one day I can start one like it. Thank you for being you, for making a heartfelt story through the craziest and most immature things you could do as a college student. For managing to make over a million people laugh, cry, and join you on your journey to adulthood; to life.  Goodbye.
Man, this is making me both sad and happy. You’ve inspired me to actually live life to the fullest and do what makes you happy, and for that I can’t thank you enough. I wish you all the best with whatever you choose to do with your life ❤
Thankyou forever
I've been watching your videos since that video of you harassing people with fat yoshi and I can't believe I've watched all the way to the end of your youtube journey. I'm actually graduating too in a month, not from college but graduating from high school is a pretty big step too. I'm starting college this fall and maybe I won't get to experience a college life as wacky as you but you and your friends have given me hope that it won't be as scary as it seems and you guys have excited me for this next chapter of my life. So thank you anthpo and friends for everything during these past few years and I wish everyone all the best!
Anthony’s documentation of his college life has shown me what’s possible when one makes the most out of their situation, good or bad. And how to live one’s life to the fullest even when beholden to the responsibilities of college; as someone whos JUST going to college in a few months, I’ll never forget these videos for being an example of what some are able to get up to while pursuing an education.
ive been watching for so long at this point and now im about to start college in the fall. thanks for all the memories
Pls don’t Leave us
Thanks for everything anthpo. ❤
biggest flex is i was watching until your first video
Thank you anthpo, what a wonderful 4 years this was, I wish you all the happiness in the world for your future, thank you anthpo 🫶
I've been here since the beginning and it's hard seeing you go but I'm thankful you were here. Thank you Anthony♥
thanks for the good times, atb for ur future man
Thank you Anthpo. Your videos were such a help for me in school. Helped me realize there's more coming in life. You're a real one
congrats on graduating!! I wish you the best for your future, and thank you for everything you’ve done for so many people! :)
Haven't been here much but congrats and goodbye man
I just started watching anthpo and now theres no more
God I grew up with this channel and I’ve absolutely adored waking up in the morning with my cereal and laughing my ass off at every new post. I hope you know how much you’ve impacted my childhood and my humor.  You sure did teach me new ways to have fun, laugh, and to enjoy even the rough boring things in life.  Thank you Antho and everyone who’s ever been with him in these many, many funny clips.
The best YouTube channel of all time. Thank you.
Goodbye. Thanks for the wild ride
Thank you Anthony, we may not be ready to say goodbye ourselves.
bruh this it's too sad for me poooo still hope u do great in whatever you do next
Sad to see you go but endings are what give anything worth while meaning. Congrats on graduating and the legacy you'll leave on the platform and the people you made it with
We all knew this day would come, but i don't think any of us were ready. Goodbye Anthony, you'll always be one of my favorite content creators. You probably won't, but if you do come back we'll always support you (unless you do a cryto scam lol)
Thanks for all the laughs and good times you gave us through your videos. Your channel meant a lot to me because I found it during a hard time, and I was also becoming a college student. You gave me an oddly specific encouragement to get out there in my college life and be M E. In parts to you, I am past that hard time, something that felt like I would not live past...literally. But now I get to enjoy my college life, despite the hard times. Thank you Anthpo, and have a wonderful life.
tnx anthpo it has been fun
It’s been an honor 🫡
I’m gonna miss his videos 😢
Been here since the perry the platypus and the beeg yoshi content, it was great watching you 🫡
This is both sad and amazing, you can definitely see the amount of effort and time that goes into making these videos, and how much fun they have creating them. These memories will always be remembered and I know this is just one sentimental comment out of thousands, but I just want to say, thank you Anthony, for taking us with you on this wild adventure 💗
O7
I have watching you all for so many years I Never thought this day would actually come thank you all for being there
real
What a journey, was amazing to follow. Feeling a bit sad and happy now lol
I remember my first time watching an anthpo video, it was 3-4 years ago and it's crazy that I watched every video you put out since then. These videos were a part of my life that I didn't know was so important to me before it was gone. Maybe the real anthpo was the memories made along the way
The 2 years I have been watching your channel are years I won’t forget watching your videos with my siblings and everyone else thank you king and thank you for being the most entertaining YouTube I had the pleasure of watching
thankyou for the best 2 years of my life anthpo we will miss you..
Thank you for putting the most biggest smiles on my face🥰 Goobye,and i hope life is good and happy for you even when your not documenting your experiences with us,but in all honesty THANK YOU for being one of the best youtubers ive ever seen and i will still have my account subbed to you even if your not posting,and i havent even finished all your videos yet,and I wish I was there from the very begining of this channel,and lots of love to you and your other friends❤️‍🔥💔❤️‍🩹❤️💖the videos you made inspired so many people to achive their dreams and goals,and i hope you can survive future hardships and stay your funny and fowl mouthed self🫡🫡🫡🫡and goodbye Anthony🫡🤗
Good work man, I wish you the best in whatever you choose to do from here on.

Bro really got his pay check and left
A wise person once said dont cry because its over smile becuase it happened.
Thank you.
He isn’t going to leave. This is literally his only form of income. Also, he wears nail polish.
Aw man, I'm gonna to miss you a lot Anthony, you brought me so much love and joy through your videos ever since I was in Middle School, now I'm graduating High School and your graduating from college it really does feel like an end of an era but I will always cherish the videos and joy you brought to us.  Much love, and good luck on your future endeavors!
I’m so glad I stuck around. Thank you Anthpo for all the fun times and good laughs. It’s been an honor having been along on the ride 🫡
BROTHER PLEASE SAY SIKE
Goodbye to the best fat yoshi harasser✊
Anthony, I know these are irrelevant to you, but seeing this made me tear up. I have been following you since you were in high school and you are such an inspiration to me and you have taught me to just enjoy life, so thank you and best of luck with your future
I have loved this channel and I just want you to know that it's helped me cheer up during hard times. I'll miss it but I hope you can find happiness where ever you go next in life. Thank you.
Try YouTube boxing
Goodbye, man. It was wild having you on here! And hey, who knows? Maybe anthpo will return in someone else’s videos. Even if we don’t see him again, man was it amazing to have him around.
i shall forever remember your beautiful face anthony
Thank you Anthony for the past 2 years (:  you've inspired me, and good luck in whatever you do.
a lot of people enjoy your content, one of the best YouTubers imo. it’ll be really sad to see no more uploads but congrats on graduating! it will be hard seeing no more videos. we will miss you and hopefully you will upload again.
Crazy how this is only the 2nd video I've watched of you
I love you man
you're such an inspiration, thank you for allowing us to follow your incredible journey with you <3
If you're watching this guy in 2035, he was a legend
Not the mr rogers inspiration
see ya around Mr.KSA of 2022
I can’t stop rewatching this video. Bye Anthony 🙂
Good luck, Anthony. I’ll miss you
thank you anthony and good bye it was a great time
It feels like I've been watching your videos for as long as I can remember. Back when I was first starting highschool, your random videos were the funniest things I had ever seen. Over the years you've made me realize that I can make what I want of my time in school. You have truly been my biggest inspiration in striving to do stupid fun stuff with my friends and to bring people together for huge events that nobody else would even think possible. Watching you just unapologetically have fun with your friends all this time has made me the person I am today. I would be a liar if I said that it isn't a huge blow to see it end, but like you said, I've got to go out and make my own story now. I've still got plenty of time left in school, and with the inspiration you have given me, I'm gonna make sure I enjoy every second of it. Thank you, Anthony.
It was hard to click on this video tbh, I don’t want it to end, but I wish you all the best with whatever you do in life and hope you succeed with anything you do. Thank you for the amazing journey :)) so many great memories
Nuh-Uh
Thank you for letting us into your life. I’ve loved watching you over the years and seeing all the crazy fun experiences you’ve had. ❤️ wishing you all the best
I do hope the channel isn't going to be deleted. I'd like to go back and re-watch some videos, and watch some I have yet to see.
From the bottom of my heart and my siblings’ hearts, thank you for the fantastic content. You’ve inspired me to be myself and not let people judge me for having a good time. I wish you the best for your future and hope you continue creating amazing memories. Thank you Anthpo.
Thank you for putting a smile on my face and making my days with new videos
Pvssy
thank you, goodluck, and goodbye <3
So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye…  Best of luck!
I can't believe I've been here since 2020
Never have I been able to be choked up and have the biggest smile on my face ever watching something. Truly this channel represents some of the greatest content to ever be published to this platform and it's inspired me and informed how I want to live my life through out high school, college and beyond that that. Thank you Anthony
NO WAY 😭😭😭
Been fun man, huge respect for you to end this YT thing and move on with another chapter in life. If you ever want to get some bbq with a random guy in Indiana off the internet, I'm just one DM away.
When you said now its time to go live your own life I almost cried, thank you for these amazing 2 years and thank you for letting us experience it with you, we'll all miss you Anthony <3 thanks for everything
Goodbye bro u gave me really good laughing loved your content hope you do well in life alll the best and love u ❤️
This is the first time I'm recommended this guy and it's the end lol

Dawg you inspired me to wear a perry the platypus costume at my school. Thank you for shared memories and I hope life treats you well ❤
❤
Good Run
I watched anthpo since his highschool days and I just want to say that it’s been an amazing journey with him throughout all of his amazing videos. They really brought a smile to my face whenever I came back from school and saw that he uploaded. I’m so happy that I got to experience all of this in my lifetime
Feels like my favorite show ending 😭😭😭😭
Duuuude, Ill miss seeing you, man. Ive still got the Anthpo Yoshi egg shirt!
I shouldnt have stopped watching the videos😭
Finally a video title I can get behind
Farewell Anthony
I wish I could say something but I cant think of anything to say... I wish Anthony and all of you the best of luck!
goodbye! Congrats!!!
No way, I seriously can’t believe you’re officially done. I’ve been watching your channel since the Avatar videos and I am so sad to see that this is your final video. I am hopeful that one day you may possibly come back because your videos and posts always made me laugh. Thank for everything!
Everyone is going to miss you anthpo and you made people realize that the true purpose of life and happiness  exists and that’s all thanks to you
This probably doesn’t mean anything to you, but you are my favorite content creator, even though you will stop posting I will continue supporting you in whatever venture you choose. Maybe in the future you could make an update on your life
<3
Just give me one more day. please let me have one more day of seeing you smile one more time
Been watching ya since early high school buddy. I just finished my first year of college and I'm so excited for the future, even though your videos will no longer be in it. I wish you all the best
Man why good content creator always go, All the best . I hope one day u make a video in the future
damn. it's good to know that a big part of my teenagehood was influenced by this guy. seeing this mans videos brought my spirits up every time. whatever you do now make sure you have just as big of an impact. thank you anthony
Thank you anthony for everything you have done it has been fun watching all of your videos and i would always laugh at them for being outlandish or goofy but i still am not ready to say good bye im glad you happend and im sad that your going but im still not ready maybe in a few years you can give us an update to your life i dont know but thank you and Good Bye Anthpo and go live your live anthony...
I’m not ready to say goodbye. I’ll miss you Anthony
Im not ready to say goodbye:(
And now we all click off
Go to grad school and start a new channel
I found out about your channel 6 months ago, but I've binged all your videos about 3 times since that, thanks for teaching me how to truly appreciate my friends.
Congrats Anthpo I loved your work here !!!!
oh my god man. this channel raised me and ik is so cringe to be commenting on a youtube video like this but you genuinely changed my life. like i kid you not i was 13 when i found this channel and i wanted to be just like you. but at that time all i saw was the fun. now after watching you grow and growing myself i realise that i don’t need to be like other people to be happy. i just need to do what i need, and you have been an integral part of me learning that. thank you to all of you.
been following since my senior year, now a soon to be college senior. its crazy to think youll be gone but i know youll continue to do great things! thank you.
Goodb ye.
“Now it’s time to go live yours”   This hit so hard   I’m about to be going to college   This channel has really taught me that the best in life can just be made by reaching out, finding some good friends, and doing whatever seems fun  I’m gonna miss this channel but while there won’t be anything new it’ll still be here to be a reminder to make the most of life
thank you for the awesome content and many laughs throughout the years! sad to see you go but i have a feeling you have a great life ahead. bon voyage!
Congrats!!! gonna miss you, its been great man.
I'll never forget this man harasing people with pictures of big yoshi
Goodbye Anthpo..thank you for all the memories and wishing u the best going forward!
aw man
Thank u po
I DIDNT REALIZE IT WAS SO SOON
gg man gonna miss your content, but is nice to see you ended in a high note.
The past 4 years have been amazing  thankyou for creating content for those 4 years even if it was stressful Thankyou anthony and everyone who participated in the videos. Thankyou for everything the videos really helped me through hard times and entertained me in good days. iI hope everyone who graduated and everyone who will, a good life 🫶
when you realize every episode of aot s4 won't be happening:,)
<3
Have an outstanding life
i just noticed the "until graduation" playlist has 69 videos lmao your a damn legend and we're gonna miss you so much. I remember watching your perry the platypus videos when i was a little too young to. you're a great guy and I wish you good luck in your future endeavors. happy graduation!!!
Smell ya later, alligator! This was something truly special, thanks for these videos.
Thank you Anthony, I didn’t watch every video, but you were definitely a part of my story as well, when you graduated high school so did I, and as you’ve graduated college I too will soon graduate, it’s weird to think that so long has passed since a video about fat yoshi but here we are.   Thank you for sharing your story with us all, thank you for being a part of ours, and I wish you the best in all your adventures to come
Honestly gonna miss you dude 🥺💕 remember during my final semester in high-school your perry the platypus video actually gave me the inspiration to be less of an quiet anxious student, you are awesome.
Sad to see you go Anthpo but, happy to be apart of your journey. Thank you and wishing you the bestest luck in anything that comes your way!
so proud of you dude :D thanks for your entertainment
Goodbye. I guess I wasn't ready to say it because I cried
thank you
Anthony, you are such an inspiration. From harassing people with fat yoshi to graduating collage. All I can say is that I'm proud of you. Although I may be younger than you I'm going through a similar experience of starting high school soon. As you said the videos are just the highlights of your collage Carrer, but I love how at the same time you can be vulnerable and admit that life is boring. It doesn't matter if you don't see this I'm already a little bit late to the video. But all I can say is congratulations and best of luck to your future Carrer.✌️
😭😭
the last line hit me so hard, this video comes out as im JUST about to start college. I cannot be more excited even if I tried. Thank you man, for making a random kid feel excited about life again.
Thank you Anthony for the last 4 years you have never not been able to put a smile on my face and best of luck in what you chose to follow next ❤❤❤
I'm so glad I got to witness this. It hurts to say goodbye, but congratulations, Anthony!
Happy to share these slices of life with you Anthony, will surely miss you and your friends! Wish you the best for days to come, God bless 🙏
I don't usually comment like this, but thank you for your contents. Its hard to find a youtuber that's so creative and passionate like you, and i am so glad that i found you and your friends, even if it was just on internet. Thanks again anthpo!
Going to miss you and all your friends! Seeing you all together was so comforting, thank you for everything
I started watching because of fat yoshi and now you've come so far congratulations and good luck bro
I don't comment much but thank you so much Anthony for all the smiles you've provided me with my years as an highschool now entering college later this year moving to the US. I hope my adventures can even reach a fraction of the fun I've seen through yours. I love you so much and you will always be in my heart for helping me go from being socially awkward to still being socially awkward with a bit more courage to fake it. Thank you man.
goodbye, ill miss ya. but congrats on your graduation man!
Really, thank you. I dont think I can understand how it is having 1.65M people know who you are and know about your personal life, but as one of those 1.65M, truly, thank you. I don't know if I can speak for all of us, but man, it has been one fun hell of a ride :)
Thanks Anthony for your showing me and others a glimpse into your amazing life and adventures. It has an amazing honor to watch your videos and thank you and your incredible friends/family for sharing. You have helped and inspired me so much and you don’t even know me, but thank you. I only ask one thing of you now that you are done. Have a good life, do that for us man, have a fantastic life! Thanks Anthony and goodbye. Congratulations on graduating and God bless you.
It's sad that the greatest YouTube channel has to end. But, maybe that's what makes it great. Thank you, Anthpo, for gracing this platform and so many people's lives. Best of wishes on wherever life takes you.
Im not crying.. You're crying!!!
Dam it ain't going to be the same anymore
It's been fun boys. Goodbye and Thank you
I'm gonna miss you anthpo, your videos have really inspired me to live a fuller life, now go live yours thank you and goodbye
You definitely inspire me to live my own adventures, thanks for everything, take care!
Idk who is he  But he seems fun Goodbye 🛐
I discovered your channel a couple weeks ago and I've really enjoyed your content. I know I haven't been here for long like some of your other subscribers but I'm still happy I got to see you do YouTube and watch your videos! Thank you Anthpo. 👋
Thank you so much Anthony. Thank you for what you’ve been reaching us. I love you man
so soo sad...  btw who is this?
Genuinely insane, all of you guys are godlike, wishing nothing but the best for you all
Thanks for all the memories these past 4 years, Anthony 💗
1:01  wait what he is dating janice
So happy for you but so sad for us
Thank you, Anthony.
I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT YOUR CHANNEL TODAY AND SADLY I HEARD THIS WILL BE YOUR LAST VID😔
Goodbye Anthpo
NOOOOO
That’s all folks
o7
These have been the best three years, watching this as a graduating high school senior with my future, this future, ahead of me truly hits different. Thank you for all of the laughs, memories, and inspiration
Stay awesome, Anthpo :D
I'm not crying, your crying
Noooooooo
Is this the me when your mom guy who got struck by lightning? I wanted to find out if that guy survived and was okay
Brb, just going to go cry real quick. Thanks for sharing your story Anthony.
I refuse to say goodbye. We will see each other again, don’t know when or how, but we share this earth, each and every one of us is connected
Gonna miss this T_T
1:01 Janice makes sense tbh
I hope the best for you moving forward
Lil bro thinks he is filthy frank😂😢😭
Anthony is making me BAWL my eyes out right now. You are my favorite youtuber ever this channel was such a wonderful idea and it captured so many memories. I hope you go on to do many more great things Anthony!
Goodbye
gonna miss you king
Sobbing, hope you have a great rest of your journey through life.
Thank you for sharing your experiences and bringing happiness to your audience everytime. We got to know the best way to spend your college days with people you treasure. I wish you all good luck!! ❤❤
You're hilarious. Have a great life.
Thank you, Anthony for being basically one of my favourite Youtubers. But, unfortunately, good thing come to an end. I hope you love a good and happy rest of your life. Have fun.
thank you so much anthony and to your friends as well. your videos have given me so much joy and comfort when i needed them the most. i hope whatever the future holds for you will just be as exciting as this channel of yours. wishing you the best!
please king, rest in power, we will take it from here.
I first stumbled upon this channel when I saw the thumbnail for the dressing as a crab video. I watched while I ate lunch and laughed my head off in the process… I really didn’t know what I was getting into but I’m glad I saw that thumbnail... when I saw this video I was in disbelief. it was like I thought your shenanigans would never end. I never imagined that  number would turn to zero. Thank you and the crew for everything, you guys are incredible(ly funny), congrats on graduating and I wish you all the best in the future :))))  goodbye anthpo
I will miss your content. Here's to the legend of Anthpo.
now time for me to go to college
thank you anthpo for all of the great memories <3 sometimes me and my own friendgroup would always watch your videos but. Thank you for everything, we love your silly videos and everything about it - We hope you're doing okay as a person too, not just your persona on the internet :) remember, we're always here, we love you
Goodbye man, I’m really gonna miss you. It’s been an absolute pleasure watching your videos!
My favorite video will always be Mr. KSA vol 2. It was like watching a fairytale come true! On the other hand, your "Every Episode of" series will live on to be Youtube staples for fans of those shows, and new fans in the future. Although your content ends today, we will revisit and view your videos until Youtube explodes. Farewell, and congrats grad!
NUH UHH
Well done, my friend..
Out with the old, in with the new. Good luck Anthony!
Good bye and good luck Anthony (:
Just wanted to say that I am in a period of my life where I can relate a lot to what leaving all of this behind must be; I am moving to the other side of the Atlantic, away from my family, friends and girlfriend, and it was coincidentally just by the time that this channel is over.   Seeing these videos helped me to better cope with the terrifying situation that is coming, which is change. It can be so hard to let go, but you inspired me by showing that we need to embrace the change, just like how you are doing with your friends now.   All the best in the world for you man and I hope we can both find happiness in this new season of life. Your videos made my day better every time they were posted and I am proud to say that I witnessed every step of the way of this channel. Cheers man.
feel :( but :) at the same time
As someone who is graduating high school this year, I feel like watching your videos throughout the years really taught me that although life will be rough, I shouldn’t let it deter me from taking chances and truly enjoying it, thank you.
Is there a reason that he is stopping once he graduates? I just discovered this page so Im curious
hell be back, money makes the world go round and he will realize he can monetize y’all
See ya, buddy! Gonna miss you but I'm glad you're still going strong and doin what you do.
This is the real reason they invented college.
Dude I watched you through highschool this is insane
Thank you
Thanks for the journey man it’s been real
Just leaving this comment here as a digital footprint that I was HERE since the VERY BEGINNING four years ago. I'm definitely going to miss these wacky, fun, and sometimes even educational videos that you and your friends have put so much effort in, despite the burden of highschool and college. I remember how I would be so excited for an anthpo upload, and it hurts to see that excitement go away. It felt like these years have just flown right by, so it was surprising when I had realized that we were nearing the end. I hope that some time after this, you will decide to start uploading again. Though, I am definitely going to rewatch the videos that you and your friends have grinded in these past four years. I will never forget this experience, and I am truly forever thankful for being shared this incredible, awesome, memorable journey. Hope we get to see more of you all. 🥰🙏❤
Thank you Anthony
Thank you name brother. For all the laughs and bullshit videos. Congratulations on graduating and good luck with any debt lol
“It’s okay to not be okay” that hit hard
It’s sad to see this wonderful guy go but I guess that’s the beauty of life, change. Things change, people change and the world changes even if you don’t notice it, though we all get share laughs, stories and make awesome friendships and relationships. Anthpo may you have a wonderful life and everyone else who reads this. 👋🏻
Been here since day yoshi 😞😞
I wish you all the happiness, success, love and prosperity in the world. You've help me to motivate myself to find that happiness, love and friendship that I lack in my life. From the bottom of my heart, I wish you all the best. Congratulations for the graduation! I wish you to have the most amazing life that you've could ever imagine.
thank you for reminding me that there is so much more to life. wishing you all the best and just know that we'll always be here for you <33
I remember watching Fat Yoshi on the bus on my way home from high school around the time when it first came out. To have watched someone only a year older than me achieve so much and have so much fun has been a blast. Anyone who knows me (including people who go to Rutgers) knows just how much your channel has meant to me over the years. I wish you all the best in life and future adventures.
I remember when one of my mates showed me y oh r perry the platypus video years ago I forgot about you till like 2020 when I just binged tons of your vids it’s been a good one thank you for all the laughs
W Channel
Already bro? I just started watching you last week ago. Damn.
Don’t be sad because it’s gone, be happy because it happened
Goodbye
I hope you're not planning to delete this channel like some channels did in past after completing their dreams, I want these memories stay here so other people find hopes whenever they need. but still thanks for your life adventure & lessons you gave us❤.
With every high, there’s every low. With every dark journey, there will always be a bright destination. I’m glad to see Anthony go. Even if leaving this channel leaves him a low point, all he can do is pick yourself up. I’m glad he isn’t strangling himself with making content, and although I want more, it’s always best to end things with a high note. Thank you Anthony, and hopes for a good life.
goodbye🎉😢
I’m sad that he had to go, but I would rather see a channel end at a certain point, then seeing it slowly for over time. Anthony’s channel has been there for me in tough times and I greatly appreciate it. Thank you anthpo
Well,  been great. From a small youtuber cosplaying ben 10 in school..  to entering cults and making a kpop group.. Thanks Anthpo! Keep on moving forward.
I've only been watching for a few months. But I watched because I loved how close you were with your friends and how much fun you guys had every time y'all got together and filmed something. I loved that every video you did was like showing that you crossed an item off your bucket list, and living life to the fullest, savoring every single moment. It actually managed to give me some hope for after I graduate high school in a month; it makes me a bit less afraid of the future. Now I know that the right people will make every bad moment worth it. Thank you, and I wish you luck in your future
Goodbye 😢😢
bye bye
Wow this has been a journey. This went from harassing people in a Perry the Platypus costume to one of the most funniest and awesome channels. I mean, you guys have had wii tournaments, nerf tournaments, winning a vollyball game and doing really good in a basketball game in anime costumes, and so much more. It has been so cool seeing how this friend group grew so much and I gotta say you guys have one of the strongest bonds I have ever seen. Just 2 years ago I thought this was never going to end, but here we are all saying goodbye. When growing up I bet a lot of people have been told to act your age because their too childish, I know I have. This channel has taught me that you can grow old but not grow up. So, thank you Anthpo, I hope you all succeed in what you guys are doing for life, and goodbye.
These 2 years really went by fast
It'd be fitting to say "Dont cry because its over, smile because it happened"  But crying Crying is fine too
im gonna miss the anthpo
gonna be a sophomore next school year, i can't wait to make my own memories!
bye anthony love ya
As long as the channel isn’t deleted so i can go back and feel nostalgic again
It’s feen the best four years thank you anthpo, I wish you good life in your adult hood
Anthpo. I can’t say much that hasn’t already been said. This is the toughest goodbye to a channel I’ve experienced since Unus Annus. As someone who just finished their junior year in college and who’s watched your videos since you were in high school; it’s been very helpful seeing someone go through the same stage of life as me. You’re videos have always been there to cheer me up when I have a bad day and you have such a creative mind that I know you’ll do well in whatever thing you put your mind too. Thank you for letting us experience your journey through college these last few years! You’ll never know how much it’s meant to us. Also, if you ever do ever decide to come back you gotta resurrect that Perry the Platypus suit from the ashes so for your sake you better stay gone.
I’m not ready to say goodbye but I’d honestly like to have Anthony do what he’s happy with
now im gonna miss yall, take care
I will miss Paul 😢
goodbye :) 👋
This will be lost in the sea of comments, but Anthpo, I look up to you. I aspire to be like you. Your outlook on life and impact on others inspires me to be a better and more outgoing person. I'm one year away from going to college, and I've been following your content since I was in middle school. You are such an inspiration to so many people beyond the funny shit you do. I thank you so such for all you've given us, and me over the years.
We’re gonna miss you anthpo! I hope my college experience goes as well as yours. It’s been fun watching your videos. Congratulations on graduating! We’re happy for you and I hope your successful in your future endeavors. 💖
thank you for those years anthony!! thank you for the content you made, it made me smile and realize that life is not that bad :D wish you the best!!
How did you graduate college in 2 years? I thought the average one was like 4 years 🤔
I'm watching this video as I finish up high school, and Anthpo has inspired me to put myself out there and try new things. Hoping to make college something different than my everyday life. Thank you for everything Anthpo
Not only can I say that as an avid Anthpo watcher that I’m so proud of you for doing this and creating such an eventful journey not only for yourself but for us, but also, thank you for sharing these wonderful moments with the world, it’s really going to leave an impact on the community that you’ve done this, congratulations.
Thank you anthpo, now I get why you're ending the channel. Now it's our turn.
BYE 😭
Thank you anthpo ❤️
Damn, hard to say goodbye to this gem of a channel.
See ya ig.
thank you anthpo
bye anthpo
You have been such a massive inspiration to me and I really feel like your channel has perfectly portrayed the beauty of the human experience. Its not just the goofy fun times that you invent, or the wonderful experiences you give to your friends-- its the genuine sincerity with which every video was created. You can tell no one is acting in these videos and you don't just cut together all of the happy-go-lucky aspects of your experiences, you leave in the actual emotion, the actual struggle, and the actual experiences you and your friends have faced over the years. I really am sorry to see you go, but I am so excited for you to have made this decision for yourself. I hope we get to catch glimpses of you living your best, most fulfilling life, and even if you never return to the public eye, I am happy knowing you took your own joy and fulfilment into your own hands. It's clear that you work hard, that you're unbelievably smart and driven, and most of all, caring and compassionate. I hope you take good care of yourself, and I cannot thank you enough for all of the work you have put in over the years to make us, your fans, random strangers, just a little bit happier in our days. Wishing you all the best with love.
I feel like you should reupload the old videos you took down such as the OG dressing as the mystery gang and the usb mouse in the car. Those old videos were legit the reasons I stuck around
im so happy to have had the chance to experience these past few years with you. im hoping that youll at least update us on your life here and there! we will miss your presence on this site dearly.
BYE LOL
Thank you for being an iconic, funny, Surprising, man💗
atleast tony p will continue to upload right?
I can’t believe it’s over been watching for 3 years and in my head there were so many more days until the end but it’s over you and your friends have been amazing to watch grow Goodbye😢
I graduate High School in 16 days. I remember watching Anthpo as a freshman and loving every second of it, even when my friends would say he’s overhyped. Watching Anthpo Graduate just made me realize I’m about to start college. I don’t want to get off the ride.  Since none of them will ever see this  Thank you Sofi Thank you Mia Thank you Ilan Thank you Hlib Thank you Liam Thank you Yentel Thank you Dalton Thank you Mateo Thank you Sauriel Thank you Orel Thank you Jack Thank you Nina Thank you Constance Thank you Elai Thank you Bella Thank you Eli Thank you Ethan Thank you Ariel Thank you Joseph B Thank you Joseph H  And Thank you Anthpo, for being there from the beginning to the End.  Go Bulls 🤘
"Now it's time to go live yours."   I will be going to college in 3 months, wish me luck!
Finally
NOOOOOOOOO
Thanks Anthony for this final video. I'm sad to see you go but I'm sure you will find something to do! Goodbye
I don’t know who he is and I‘m sad
Well...This is it ig- So...goodbye
Man I have been here since literally the start. So bittersweet
adios 🥲
JANICE AND ANTHPO SHIP PLOT TWIST WAS FUGGING CRASYSYSYS
from fat yoshi to now, its been a great time
Man...
Hey Anthony! I just want to tell you how much your content has meant to me over the past 4 years. You may just be another YouTuber to me, but it’s still sad to see you go. I truly hope that you live the rest of your life to the fullest! Thanks for being such a big inspiration to so many of us!
I’m gonna miss your content, good luck to you Anth!
:(
life is amazing -me
I haven't watch a whole ton of your videos, I've watched some now and then, but I've gotta say there's something beautiful about stepping away, finishing a project. You could continue this channel, you could make a living off of it. But instead you recognize that the life that you gave it is over, and that it's time to move on.
This comment section is giving me so much life. ❤ Thank you for everything.
What is there to say but thank you. No words can explain how amazing and genuine your channel is. especially nowadays, when people try to hard to seem noticed.
goodbye, you’re an inspiration!! we’ll miss you a lot but just know we all wish you the best in what you do in the future <3
Thank you Anthony. It feels so bittersweet knowing that you're leaving. I've been watching you since I was a freshman in high school, and now i'm gonna graduate in a little over a week. It's terrifying, to be honest. You're a real inspiration and I really will miss you. I hope whatever happens next for you is amazing, cus man you deserve it.
Thanks for making the videos you did!  I’ve never been a very social person, and I have little to no friends irl, some of your videos really cheered me up when I was feeling lonely! So thanks for it all ^^ I hope you have a great time doin whatever you decide to do in the future.
"Thank you all so much and being part of my story, Now its time to go live yours." -Anthpo 2023
i flooded my room with tears😭
thank you too
I love you. No homo tho. Youre great dude, thank you for the years.
To be honest, I don't even know who this guy is... But I'm tearing up anyways
:,) thank u for all of the amazing content, you will live on in our hearts <33
On one hand, I feel like so much more could be done on this channel, but on the other, it's a privilege to end things on a high note. Thanks for all the amazing content over the years, Anthony.
wait anthpo has a gf?
We've known this has been coming for ever now, and still this is so shocking. Thank you for all the laughs over the years Anthony, I hope for only the best in your future.
this channel will always have a special VIP suite in my heart
Been an absolute pleasure to follow you in your wild adventures, Anthpo. As the saying goes, all good things must come to an end.  Thanks for the ride. All the best <3
Happy I was there through the journey.
BY ANTHONY YOUR THE GOATT
Thank you anthpo for everything you've given us. I've been watching you since the usb car video (lmao) and as a brazillian, its really cool watching your pov living in the us. You've presented me into sooooo many stuff and im just grateful for the artist that you are. Hope one day I can see you again, idk. Luv u so much, thanks for everything❤
Bro I started your channel 4 years ago, Now its already my turn to graduate. Thank you Anthony
i’ll miss u sm
Been watching you since the big yoshi video, and I remember even then being inspired to do stupid fun stuff with my friends. Now I’m a year into college myself, and you’ve continued to inspire me to enjoy life, and embrace the highs and lows. I hope you keep doing fun stuff, even if we don’t get to see it. Thanks for doing what you do.
Goodbye
Thank you. It might just have been as simple as you being you, but,  You shaped many people, including me, into the person they are today.  Thank you for all the laughs. Thank you for all the stories.  Thank you for all the memories.  Just know, we’re all out here rooting for you. Your life has just begun.  Congrats, Anthony.   And thank you.
man i also graduated today this hit me right in the feels 😭
Okay, bye. But are you cut or uncut?
I can’t. I’m literally crying 😭 ❤ the memories you made oml I can’t ILYSM
My ass is going through the five stages of grief
Farewell Anthpo and friends
congratulations, thank you, and goodbye.   oh also i think now is a great time to mention how i couldn’t focus too well because i was distracted by how much your attire made you look like jon arbuckle during the first part of the video
Goodbye Anthony and thank you for the memories
It’s kinda crazy as your college journey ends mine is just beginning
Damn i just started watching this channel, and now you're saying goodbye 😭 WHAT IS MY LIFE
Can’t believe this is it. I remember seeing your perry the platypus video and later on being inspired by your storytelling and editing as well as the amazing friends you surrounded yourself with. Godspeed man, congrats on graduating college 👏🏽❤️🫡
It's been amazing watching your videoes all these years; I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sad to see them end. I always dreaded college, but watching you made me look forward to it instead. I wish you the best in whatever you decide to do in the future. Thank you.
been watching since the high school videos. can't believe it's over. thank you for all the joy. <3
Tbh this does not feel real I remember when I saw the count down for the first time and It being so long but it’s crazy how it’s here. Thank you Anthony for many laughs and smiles and thanks for an amazing 2 years of videos 🫶
Damnit Anthpo, of course it had to be 69 videos. Thanks for all the laughs, you've probably singlehandedly made my anxieties for college dissipate and have me looking towards the future with excitement.
The more I watched the channel, the more I realized that this isnt for us, but this channel is for his friends. We(the 1m+ internet strangers) are just a byproduct of anthony's personality and hobbies.
<3
goodbye luv!!! hope you have a good goodddd life! thanks for everything :)
Today we say goodbye to a legend, and wish him the best on his journey in life. ❤🎉
I can’t believe I’ve been here sense day 1 I’m so happy to see you’ve gone this far
What a way to show that you can live a "normal" life and it still be so fulfilling and magical. So thank you anthpo, gone but not forgotten
Shit, The Years have gone by...
This channel feels vaguely like a coming of age movie ngl
I recently found his channel and while I many not have had a deep connection with your content it helped show me what my college experience can be like if I put in the effort. Congrats on graduating 🎉 and many this chapter of my life be half as fruitful as yours was. Thank you for everything ❤
I ll miss u Anthony.good luck 😭
Hey Anthony, I know this is parasocial and whatever but I want you to know that I don’t think a channel has ever touched me or inspired me as much as yours. I also graduated today, but from highschool instead, and watching you over the years has inspired me to live out my college years to the fullest potential just as you had.
Everything that could be possibly be said to you has probably already been said but I’d just like to mention that your strength is admirable. I know that you’ve been through some tough times whilst having this channel from self doubts to criticism to probably a bunch of other things that we are unaware of but you’ve conquered those inner obstacles and made something of them.. and that is the greatest inspiration I got from this channel… good luck with this new chapter of your life and although it may be different I know you’ll conquer this as well
i've been here since the perry videos, this was a halarious journey and i hope you the best
I’m gonna miss this channel because it was really fun to watch. But this is fate so  goodbye and we all hope you succeed in whatever you choose to do next  after YouTube !
There's always grad school sometimes

It has been fun while it lasted thank u man for the laughs
Dawggg. I just realized Anthony was kinda my motivation for wanting to go to a uni. Like dang bro. Yes I’ve always wanted to go to one. But he’s made it so much better knowing the possibilities I could expect
Yo, you’re literally the greatest YouTuber on earth, bro. Gonna miss you.
Thank you Anthony, for making me remember to live for. For my friends, and to live for the bit. I am so proud of you and the amount of people you have helped. Thank you again, please be safe.
It was amazing watching your videos, you've impacted me in the best way possible. Have a wonderful life!
Ain’t this the perry the platypus guy?
Brb finna sob
I don't regularly watch Anthony, but I do enjoy your content when you do upload. I really appreciate the words you said at the start, acknowledging that was big. Not everyone has a bunch of highs, not a lot of people experience much. I'm going to go and have a look at some of your experiences, I have no doubts they'll be uplifting.
thats quite the knee slapper.
peace bro, thanks for the content over the years.
We will see him again someday or in the real world if we’re lucky sad to see you go but happy for your future
I'm so glad to have been able to witness the journey this channel has been on, and I've loved all the crazy ideas and videos that came to be on this channel. I'm sad to see the last of your videos, but know that every one of them has touched somebody with its exciting atmosphere or heartwarming message. Thank you, anthpo, I wish you the best. <3
its so sweet and melo at the same time. tysm for everything you've given to us. ily
End credits?
So what’s next? I’m shocked he’s not continuing on this channel with the massive fan base he has!
I've been watching since you graduated high school, and it's absolutely crazy to see it all end. Your video about graduating high school brought me so much comfort as I was about to enter by freshman year. I wanted to make memories like you did. I wanted to make the most of it. Now, I watched you graduate from college as I prepare to enter freshman year once again. I find myself so comforted knowing that people have these sorts of memories. So thank you for sharing. You've always helped lessen my anxiety, and make me excited for the future. I'm sorry that this felt like something you had to give up, but II'm thankful for all the time before. Thank you, Anthony. Please go on to do amazing things---or entirely mundane ones. It's up to you.
:O
Congrats Anthony. I'll be honest I did not stick around for the entirety of your journey but this was probably the most entertaining and enjoyable YouTube/ collage story thingy I've come across.❤❤🎉  Farewell.
This is one hell of a goodbye. kind of feels like im saying bye to an old friend of some sort. Thanks for all the laughs, goodbye
Thanks you for the content these past four years its been awesome, I wish you the best of luck on whatever you choose to pursue next in life!
Congratulations, I will really miss your videos that always seemed to brighten my days. Although I will miss you and your content I wish you all the best going forward
Everyday I would come home and see if you had posted a new video and it made my exhausting day turn around making me forget about everything from before and being happy. Goodbye Anthony. Take this for your journey. 🍞
hey anthony . i’m pretty close to graduating high school and I remember watching your life advice from a doofus video when I was a freshman. And it really made me think about how I wanted to spend my high school years. And when I tell you that it changed my outlook on how I wanted to live like my young life, I mean that. Your stupid antics and your funny videos made me think about how I wanted to be remembered by my friends by my teachers by my peers, so I thank you for that for giving me the inspiration to make high school a little less annoying. PS, my girlfriends cousin went to your high school and that’s so dope.
Thank you
I've been following this channel since high school, so this is like mega pain for me right now, lol... Thanks for letting us watch your journey, it was cool.
Thank you Anthony for getting me through the hard days, you will be missed. I hope you have an amazing life, one that you deserve. We love you 🫶🏻
Omg, I can't believe everything has come to an end. Although it's bittersweet this goodbye, I'm glad I was able to find your youtube channel. Your adventures have really inspired me to go out of my comfort zone and enjoy every moment I can with my friends. Also, learn to embrace every aspect of my life, the good and the bad. Honestly, I'm gonna miss your videos😔 I wish you the best, Anthpo. And happy graduation!
fuckin roller coaster man. good luck with anything you do next, wherever your profession takes you the venture will be lucky to have you
To think this all started cuz a guy decided to dress up as Perry the Platypus and Ben 10 at his high school and now he’s graduated college and is moving on to other things in life. I’m so happy I was here to see this amazing journey of yours Anthony wishing you the best in your future. “Don’t cry because it’s over smile because it happened”-Dr Seuss
Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart, im actually graduating highschool at the same time, and seeing all the experiences you have, and the friends you made, makes me feel a whole lot better for leaving everything behind. You have really changed the way I want to live my life, treat my friends, and man just thank you so much. I always watch your vids when im feeling pretty lonely or down on myself, and every single time without doubt you have found a way to make me laugh, or change the way I feel. Honestly, i wish your videos would never end, but we all knew this was coming. Ill make my college life great, just as you made yours, thank you so much Anthony.
And here it is, its finally over, i expected this and somehow it still hurts seeing something so good come to and end. Thank you Anthony much love and have a great rest of your new journey
this is really it… … I… uh… don’t know what to say 🥲
What an inspiration, thank you so much Anthpo! All the best for whatever you will be doing in the future
A bittersweet moment. I feel sad because honestly, Anthony, I'm gonna miss you. Your videos helped so much, and made my days infinitely better. You're such an inspiration and motivation. I will never forget the memories i made watching you. Though i am happy for you and that you graduated, I  hope you live a good and successful life and that you still have fun. Thank you for all that you've done.❤
goodbye anthony
not gonna lie, i was subbed for the first about year and a half but stopped watching so i unsubbed. seeing this video made me kind of regret that. that said, i still got 2-3 more years of college so maybe ill take some inspiration and live a more outgoing life. that said, as an engineering major i don't exactly have a lot of free time, but ill figure it out. ill be praying that your life goes well, as the shift from college to the "real world" is usually pretty jarring. God bless man.
It's crazy how the journey felt short, and at the same time long, that's so weird- And now I'm starting college pretty soon myself, with my highschool graduation being on the 22nd. Honestly, this all feels pretty crazy.
Goat. 🥲
bittersweet.
It was fun when it lasted.
i cant believe its the end, we’ll miss you a lot but your gonna do amazing out there. for all the comfort and laughs, thank you so so much Anthpo🫶❤️
When I saw his high school video like the perry the platypus, I was in awe. You are such an inspiration. Making other smile without causing harm.  Like I did when I saw you high school videos. I pray that you have a successful life and bring others joy!
Chills
