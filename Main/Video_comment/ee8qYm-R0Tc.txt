Surely someone could have found an Australian Race Director to sort this mess out  and ensure Red Bull got 1 AND 2  🙂
The irony of Max complaining about rules not being followed 🤣
Notice how lewis says a world champion up ahead. And not a double world champ 😂😂
Lewis has driven like this for years He not a dirty driver but he makes it difficult for other drivers  They should all drive in this manner
Not sure what Max is suggesting, but if it's that he was forced wide then that is 100% hypocritical and 100% ridiculous. The guy seems to have zero self awareness.
Thankfully, it doesn't matter how much Hamilton wants to play bumper cars. Max is by far the better driver and can afford to back out of things then pass at will any time he likes.
Hamilton is never happy
Max can't talk.
Max is the biggest hypocrite & cry baby in the world! it's hilarious watching his fans saying 'cry more' every 5 minutes, the irony to say that while supporting him...
If you share Max's personality traits you will be fan, if not you won't. I might be wrong but I am more concerned about his Dads apparent simmering rage in the garage.
Love how he refers to the rule brought in because he couldn't race fairly like the other drivers.
"When people get used to preferential treatment, equal treatment seems like discrimination." Thomas Sowell
Max talking about "rules" which was broken to give him his first title. Max who doesn't get penalised for running Lewis off track many times!
Maxi Crashstappen moaning about rules! 😂🤣
Max unbelievable, doesn’t like what he’s done plenty of now he knows how that move feels he’s whining like a spoiled child who wants everything
Always moaning take a chill pill you won
Wins a GP but looks like he came last.
Oh the irony
safe to say Mercedes are back
Let’s be reasonable. I’m a Hamilton fan but what Max said here was nothing outrageous. The title actually misquoted him, he said “those rules are not followed”, and then added on “but that’s fine”. He clearly was making a statement in general about those rules not being stuck to completely and therefore there probably being more of an issue with the rules themselves. When people make statements I disagree with, I’m all for calling them out, but let’s not overreact for no reason.
Max  masi and Fia best boy talking about rules 😂 the rules for 2021 was for you boy ...
What is happening and going on and what rules r not going on
Max can be soo unlikeable. Has the charisma of a plank of wood.
The 3 best drivers on the Grid!!
Max is unbearable. How is he complaining about the move Hamilton made after all his antics since he has joined F1. Most deluded athlete I've ever seen.
I'm a massive Hamilton fan but have felt his wheel-to-wheel racing has been a bit rusty, especially last season. Not today though, that lap 1 move was class.   It's ironic that Verstappen was complaining about it as he's the one who's taken crowding to extremes in recent years. He's forced others to race him in the same way he races them.
That's what they makes the rule for, to break it 😁
I think everyone in these comments would like to see Lewis win every race and world championship until he retires.
Pot and kettle there boy
One time world champion max moaning about following the rules.🥱
The diva of verdtspen always crying
Not even Max's father attempted sabotage of Peres brakes kept Sergio from gaining points in the race
The rules are not being followed:  you have to let all the lapped cars unlap themselves before a restart.
Max has that raw hunger and ruthlessness Schumacher used to have he keeps on this route he will  smash the next decade
Max runs everyone off the track ha ha holy crap.
Max still a cry baby just cant warm to him acts like a little boy very talented but come one you have never raced fairly so pot kettle black come one uve had everything your own way since redbull give massi a nice offshore account i think in yesrs to come the whole truth will come out
good job the rules weren't followed in Abu Dhabi 2021 😂
You have got to be kidding me, max/rb saying rules are not be followed. Remind me again what year it was max/rb cheated there way to victory.
I used to give Vercrashenhappen the benefit of the doubt. Sometimes English spoken, however fluently, by non native speakers gives a misleading impression but it turns out Max really is an arrogant spoilt cry baby
He really has to cry about being pushed off 😂
Nothing wrong with Lewis’ overtake, Max just loves a moan and talking about himself.
Haha he did the city a favour and cut the grass, Max cracks me up on open mic night.
Lewis had best car for 7 yrs hasn't now just shows its the car that counts not the driver. Max in faster car is he a better driver than Hamilton at the moment yes. Hamilton continually complains about the car perhaps he is not good enough now 😊😊😊
Remember max you won your first title with the help of the officials
No surprise Verstappen is losing fans, he's like a child that never gets his own way. If you're getting to be a stickler for the rules, atleast stick to them yourself. He's unhappy about the red flag because it stops racing yet he's unhappy being pushed off on the outside in a racing incident. Or you only happy if the rules suit you? Does not act like a champion at all.
Max...I am amazing....Every other driver...Humble... I wonder why his Dad was accused of some things in the past.
Grow up max all fair not complaining when the shoe on other foot
What shamilton meant to say was thank you to the team for bringing George in so I can take the lead
Max may have a championship car but is no champion.
Uh oh, here comes the hamilton ebrigade. Firstly, if you believe that Verstappen is wrong to force drivers wide, then you must also believe that it is wrong for hamilton to do it. Secondly, forcing drivers wide is a legitimate tactic; it's been used for decades and in fact one of the masters of it is hamilton. Third, the point of him bringing this up isn't to have a moan, what he is actually doing is testing to see what is allowed and acceptable and then he will use that to his advantage, as any racing driver should.
Max and redbul moan the most despite getting away with murder
..and look at the comments all hate towards Verstappen 😂😂
Max complaining about being pushed wide in an overtake, April 1st was on Saturday mate!
Okay, I fell for the clickbait title ... Haven't watched F1 since it became 'Entertainment with Fast Cars' ...
Max is an absolute muppet 95% of the time 😂 The guy has made a career of charging up the inside on drivers when he had nothing to lose but now he’s in the superior car, he’s got something to say about it? We all know he would have done the exact same in Lewis’s position, no doubt about it.
Yet again another completely stupid end to a race
Lewis left him space but he drove off track sliding around on his cold tires
Not a clue what Max is on about. Must be because I'm so deeply biased
The first time Max has to yield to Lewis and he’s upset. How many times has Lewis had to avoid Max? Especially in 2021, he had to swerve so many incidents.
Is MV just trolling everyone, he's been running drivers off the road since he was 12.
Young Crashstappen ought to be the last person anywhere near F1 to be talking about rules & regs.....
Max crying again even tho he’s won the race 🤦🏻‍♂️
Hollands own Mansell strikes again
Max saying rules not being followed, the irony!!!
The more I hear max the less I like Him
The highlight of Max's race was being overtaken by Lewis, other than that he seems bored. Sport implements rules and regs to shake up the sport, other than Aston Martin moving up the grid, the new regs have slaughtered upfront competition. This is not better than 2019. Lewis and Alonso, creeping around looking after their tyres might be clever, but it isn't racing.
Love to see the f1 ‘fans’ making constant toxic remarks stanning for certain drivers
Loving the copium here
Good job Lewis, I appreciate your hard work today, soon you will get in there I believe, and I believe your ability to hit it off the ground , good luck as you make the push up, thanks Lewis for putting smiles on your fans faces today, more positive results from now
Max really is the shining example of the spoilt little rich kid that made it isn’t he.
You won a championship because the rules were broken
You can like the second one because you wasn’t behind the Mercedes’ waffling as usual
Is it just me or does Max not seem 'that' thrilled he won? 🤨
if rules were followed Max would have 1 less world championship title.
Haha no one cheering during max’s interview shows how unliked he is. Great to see two world champions on the podium tho 🎉
Cant wait for Lewis to start pushing Max off the track & getting away with it. 😂😂 bring us the tears!
Max is the type of guy to rage quit FIFA if he doesn't score the first goal.
No thanks, YT, can't think of anything more sodding boring than car racing!!
2 years ago max thought he was driving a bulldozer the amount of times he pushed someone of the track
Dutchies crying and cheating? Who would have seen that coming.
It’s sad. Max doesn’t even enjoy winning no more 🤔 bland guy
Damn Max is really not a likable person. Great driver though but rubbish character
Max has some issues lol
What is max going on about again? Someone needs to show in Brazil 2021 when he shoved Lewis into Argentina. Nothing wrong with Lewis’s overtake today
Max complaining about other drivers being aggressive 😂😂😂
Max is getting a bit above his station... 😅
Haha, cameras showing Fernando while Max is talking.
Go cry Max
Max never cared about "rules" before, so why now?
Verstappen either has a very short memory or now thinks he should have a different set of rules applied to him from the rest of the field. That overtake Hamilton pulled on him today was 100% fair, legal and above board which is a lot more than can be said for him and some of his “overtakes” over the last few seasons. He truly is a great driver, perhaps one of the greatest to ever sit in an F1 car but his attitude lets him down badly. If the roles were reversed I’d be quite confident he’d have said it was a fair manoeuvre for the place. I also doubt Hamilton would have had any complaints if it were pulled on him, except to admit it was a fair overtake. We’ve not saw so much of Verstappen’s bad side over the last 2 seasons because he’s winning and driving the best car so he’s happy. If he was neck and neck with anyone and not in a fully dominant car I feel we’d see more of his real character. The 2021 season should serve as a reminder of what he’s really like with his behaviour under normal service.
Shock, Max moaning about ‘rules’ 🤣
Vestappen shouldn't say too much. His world championship was won because someone decided not to follow the rules and handed Vestappen an undeserved first championship. Hamilton would be 8 times World Champion.
When Max grows up he's going to look back at these interviews wishing he'd been a bit more gracious in victory
Max is just a Richard!!! nothing more to say.
The nerve of this man!
There is no bigger hypocrite in sport than Max Verstappen.
Max asking the overtaking rules to be followed 😂😂😂 Now he's the one with a lot to lose, he'll be a target 🎯 to people using his unic " rules"
The rules are the rules. Max moved forward in his grid slot before all 5 lights went out, so he should have followed the rules.
Sore winner and sore loser. Max showing true colours.
LOL, crashstappen complaining about someone squeezing him.
Max has zero charm.
Alonso somehow getting P3 every race, no matter what happens, is a meme.
Coming from him who’s motto is let me past or we crash
Max crying about the rules is like putin crying about war crimes
I don’t think max likes fighting for race wins in general. Like I know when he fights lewis it’s a different story but I think he’d rather have a stroll in the park and cruise to victory which don’t get me wrong any driver would want that but I feel that fighting for postion shows the true talent in f1 drivers. max just didn’t like the fact he was being overtaken even though he knew he would pass him
Wah wah wah I know f1 drivers have an ego and winge when things don't go there way but this guy is next level on the complaint front every time
Max Verstappen would hate racing against Max Verstappen
Very humble and professional by Lewis and Alonso. Giving thanks too. Over to Verstappen and he talks about himself only.  Shows who the true champions are !
That’s a bit rich coming from a man that has all but been given the last 2 WC.
He still looks such a miserable little fella even when he's winning!
Banger racing in Melbourne park👏
He's a Great Driver but I really Don't like Max as a Person!
The king of pushing people off the track is complaining he NEARLY got pushed off the track ?. Just when I start liking Max, he acts like a petulant child again...
1:25 4:15
Max is such a big baby! Not a great sportsman.maybe go tell your daddy! 😂
Rules aren’t being followed   Red Bull - “Hold my 2021 championship trophy”
Max will never learn
Everything is amazing when Lewis is competitive… but doesn’t he win and lose as a team? Car not changed since race 1… but it was engineers fault for not listening last year… but now car is p2… it’s all amazing again
Max what a moaner you are!
the GOAT wins again
Lewis blaming his tools yet again. The cars in the top 3 every race
I presume there’s no direct translation of the word hypocritical into Dutch?
I'm laughing at all these Max comments. Guys. He's world champion. This is gamesmanship all part of the battle . On and off the circuit. He knows it was a fair pass. But he isn't going to say that about a major rival.
Max complaining about foul play. Lol
that redbull car needs to be investigated
I've gotta say, Max being the new face of F1 sucks, brilliant brilliant driver in an absolute spaceship but he's so hypocritical and pretentious, like Joffrey Baratheon. Even when a young Sebastian Vettel was drawn up as a villain, we all knew he was a top man. I don't sense anything but self-entitlement from Max
*2023 Max* “I just tried to avoid the contact, there are rules”  *2022 Max* “I knew he wasn’t going to leave the space so I just went for it”  This guys double standards are unreal 😂
The tide is going to turn against Max, no matter what Lewis does, Max has an issue with it. That overtake from Lewis was brilliant. Just accept it Max.
Max is never happy with anyone doing a move on him. Yet all the moves he does are just perfect. The phrase "people in glass houses, shouldn't throw stones" comes to mind.  What a podium, it would be great to see Alonso win another title before he retires and it's great seeing Lewis back in the mix.   Max and that redbull car is still just two quick but nice seeing the others closing the gap a bit.
Even though it will be a Red Bull season. I cant wait to see how Mercedes vs Aston Martin plays out. Alonso deserves to be on podium and its great to see Hamilton back up there.
F1 is rigged
I want to see max lose for abit just to show people who he really is, I would also love to see him be robbed of a championship just see how he handles it, can you imagine 😮
I’m no Max fan but I’m glad one of the top 3 mentioned the shambolic red flags and race management 😮‍💨
The performance difference between the Red bull is so far ahead of anything else. I’ve not seen a car this dominant since the Ferrari F2002. Sad that the battle for 3rd will be the most competitive throughout the season. Was hoping the changes would of given us a year like 2008, with multiple drives being in the title race.
I won't pretend like I'm the biggest Max but it's funny how people aren't even conscious of the fact that they're haters of success or anyone that "wins too much". When Vettel was winning they hated him, they hated Lewis too and even Alonso at one point received a lot of hate, now that they're no longer the clear #1, people miss them being at their peak and want the successful return story for all of them. We all want to see Vettel return and become one of the top drivers, we want to see Alonso winning again and people want to see Lewis dethrone Max. Hamilton was probably the most hated driver just 3-4 seasons ago. When Max is no longer the #1 guy, give it a couple of seasons & watch how many people especially the guys hating on him right now begin to root for him😂
Difference is when max pushes people off he makes sure to fully ruin their position, Hamilton left enough space for V to continue in 3rd to fight another day.
The more time goes by the more unlikeable max becomes
The FIA show once again
The real debate is whether Max's jokes are just not funny or if it's just how bad he tells them
F1 will never grow as a sport if it stays in the absolute atrociously boring state it’s in now
But SiLvErStOnE
Red Bull complaining rules are not being followed...oh the irony
I had to smile when Max mentioned rules, the rules........ye the same rules or an interpretation of the rules that gifted him his first championship, rules 😂
Funny how times change....when Max was the driver with nothing to lose and Hamilton and Merc were the team avoiding contact Max loved the aggression against Lewis. Now Max has the dominant car he doesn't like the aggressive passes.
cannot stand hamilton and even more so verstappen
First thing Lewis does, Thanks the fans, last thing Verstsppen does thanks the fans
Cryshtappen 😢😢
All three reference a great day for the team. But Alonso and Max fail to even acknowledge their teammates.
Didn't red bull cheat last year and over spend. Max has the personality and mood of a teenage boy.
Just be glad to see the back of old Hamilton. Max will dominate for a while
Nothing wrong with that overtake what so ever, don’t care who you support you take that out of formula one the only place you can overtake is the straights.
Lewis gave max a lot room then max would've given Lewis had been the other way round.
This season could now give us many Alonso v Hamilton battles and that could get.....emotional. (The feed I was listening to alleged Hamilton was heard saying 'no way will I lose to HIM' on the radio, which the commentators presumed meant Alonso)
Don't like a dose of his moves  keep it up Lewis
Max just embarrassing himself now 😅
Verstappen is a ....
verstappen reminds me of a petulant child who gets miffed when thigs dont get his way, he won his first championship because the fia didnt follow their own rules so it would be done for money and sponsorship and they do the same with this race, the 2nd red flag should have been sc and all the way to the finish
Nobody likes Max
Yessss Red bull yesss horner yess newey yess max well done team see u In   4 weeks Bois and gals 👍👍👍👌👌👌👌
Lewis with the cheeky Freudian slip 🫡
Max 'do as I say not as I do' Verstappen.
Max is the last person with any credibility to complain about overtaking and rules
Sky F1 comment sections are one of the worst places on the internet.   Abandon all hope ye who enter here, if you even see my comment since sky blocks and deletes 90% of comments.
Max thinks his driving is better than Lewis when it’s being proven that the car is doing his job
Can someone helps me out here please? How did Alonso crash out 2 laps from the end and then come in P3? It shows nothing on the highlights... just crash.. then P3...??
Just wanted to say the British tears at verstappen is absolutely hilarious 😂😂😂😂 GONE ON CRY HARDER   NO MIKEY NO
Someone do a video of shorts of the max push offs during his races
Max needs to lighten up a bit. He's insanely talented but the entitlement he and his dad have and the ever increasing moaning since he became a world champion is getting a bit boring already. It's funny because it was almost like roles reversed today from 2021 when Lewis was the champion and Max was pulling those kinds of robust moves on Hamilton and even forcing him to take evasive action. Today Max was the tentative champion with Lewis taking the invite with both hands with not a lot to lose. He can't complain after how hard he raced Lewis a couple of years ago. Just get on with it man and take another title whilst you're in a rocketship. Takes the shine off the hard racer image when you're moaning about non incidents like today and still won comfortably.
How anyone can like max is astonishing.
First RULE of F1 club is: 1) Max always wins - no matter what the rules. The Second RULE of F1 club is: 2) Do NOT talk about rule 1) of F1 club. The Third RULE of F1 is: 3) Don't even bother - it's too tedious for words.
Max gave Lewis the space, clear he took the restarts easy because he had the car to overtake, when it mattered he blocked off Lewis. Lewis acknowledging  top 3 world champions🙌
Red bull cheats
Max has been driving terrible this season, without this huge car advantage he'd be getting smoked. 1 second a lap quicker and always complaining 😂
The thing about humility is…if you blink it will bite you back. Max is salty asf with a +8 second lead 😂
Great driving Sir Lewis nice to see you back on the podium. Looking forward to more podiums
Max looks bad here moaning, hes done it his entire career, just because he has the fastest car he doesnt like it done to him
If you look at the dictionary definition of hypocrisy, it says...see Max Verstappen!
When Max says "We won which is most important" he really means "I won which is most important".
Max is such a baby 🍼
Lewis got lucky with 2nd red flag Alonso was catching up.... Lewis 1st driver and only driver I heard on the radio saying debris everywhere calling for 3rd flag lol he wanted that win and secure 2nd badly lol
The overhead camera view - just before Lewis overtook him - looked a lot like a brake test by Max. Another attempt at intimidation - that backfired?
Wow Max complaining on rules not being followed,  when he won he's first title on rules that were broken so he could  win it. 👏👏👏👏👏
Fair move , stop crying max you finally race clean wheel to wheel with Lewis and get overtaken get over it .
Very bitter from Max. Not surprising when you have a role model like Jos.
Karen verstappen
There a surprise verstappen whingeing when things don’t go his way.
Max is literally the worst.
Oh my god ,the Union Jack wavers are at it again . Its all got to political and they feel Hamilton ( their Messiah) has got the right end of the stick they go ballistic.  This is why Britain-has become the worlds “ Butt of the Joke” .  It’s a race and things happen and many times it’s doesn’t go your way , that’s all part of the sport.  But to start throwing you toys out the pram everytime for nothing, makes you look like the more of the fool you are.  Britain is good at backing the fools and idiots ,them complaining.  It’s congratulations to all those who took part, be that First , last or DNF , there would be NO race without you all making the effort and taking the chance.
Cult44 have invaded the comments, take cover.
Plenty of room, Max....   complains even though he has a car that is way faster.
He spent years pushing people off track without consequences and now that he THINKS he got pushed off (he wasn't) he asks for the rules. Although seeing how much the FIA loves him/RB, I wouldn't be surprised if they somehow punish Hamilton after this.
A true rollercoaster of a race, just brilliant. The disappointing part of this interview is Max. He just can’t seem to reflect honestly on his own behaviour, it’s bizarre. Max immediately saying “I was careful because I had a lot to lose and they had a lot to win”, says it all. In 2019, 2020 and 2021 Max was driving more aggressively (and in my view dangerously going over the line multiple times) because he had a lot to win and nothing to lose. Now others are doing it because he’s the one to beat and he doesn’t see why his competitors are driving this way. I hope it’s just how he comes across in interviews and he’s better at analysing races than it appears.
Ha, Max crying over rules not being followed is just hilarious.
Hope alonso can get a p1 some point this season hope he continues for a few more seasons yet. Great to see Lewis up front again. Mardy max strikes again always moaning even if he wins
Good to "Legendary Hamilton" bk up in box seats 💺
Lol Max always 😢sour Champion 😂
He didn't worry about the rule when he robbed his championship 😅
It was a perfect move from Lewis, gave Max just about enough space to keep it clean and legal. Max crying about it is rich, he has no self awareness whatsoever
Nothing wrong with that lewis overtake on max
I'm a Max fan but think he's the last driver who should be complaining about being pushed off on the outside when side by side.
Max is funny, he has an entire championship because rules were not followed...
Max looks more like a inbred ever day
Rich from Max complaining about Sir Lewis' move on him. He got a taste of his own medicine.
2 world champions on the podium😮😅😂
Not verstappen crying over a move massively more space giving than he ever does… 😂😂😂
Anyone else notice how Max looks like Jackie Kennedy?
Consistency?? ...  Max grid start position👀
The ending of this race show Hamilton got robbed of that 8 world title
Max is a second a lap quicker than everyone else and he's still crying about a borderline move.
Top 3 are the top 3 drivers on the grid 💯
