5:07 ayoooooo VIKKKKK
Behz released his proper inner West Ham when he was freezing
Who tf all these new people recently, cant stand them i come for title "SIDEMEN" and i get this guy talking 90% of the time
u could easily revive josh there, pussio
9:38 hang on a minute
What are your upgrades for the M4
the best I have done so far Is a 12 kill solo dubb
Vick carries
Hola Álex y indio xD 🤭🤙
kinda sad saying your so good but play on dodgy french servers not even english servers
Drop the sniper ammo!
Ethan sounds like he’s drunk 😂
WAIT IS DAY MY GUY!!! KHAOS ADAM in a video with the sidemen LLLLLLFFFFGGGG!!!!
vik is actually very good
Hey vik love the content but would you guys be able to try freefire out it would really make alot of awesome content n to see the sidemen play this game would be even more freakn amazing
no one notice? u walking on water like god himself
p̷r̷o̷m̷o̷s̷m̷ 🍀
good content vik
Lol where is the rage all i saw was awesome gameplay 😂
5:05 ayo Vik
We need sidemen warzone again like in the lockdown please
Boss needs to tell bossman to stop saying boss
Can khaos do basic maths. 29 kills? They got 31
Terrible thumbnail might I say. Excellent video though.
IS THAT BIG MAN ADAM YEAH?! LET'S GO DUDE.
You could have stuck the res on Zerkaa in the end.
seeing adam play with them is crazy nice
Look at Adam man, so inspirational. Man is bigtime
goo on vik
bro really dissed Adam on the thumbnail lmao
Love watching the bois play warzone - get JJ on it's hilarious watching him play and not caring lol
Where can we watch the whole games?
https://www.twitch.tv/flezzuz trolling ppl (quickscope only!)
When u play with vik u have to listen to the captain
We need Vik at 10 Mill
Just left a self revive in the bag and didn’t say anything to anyone Lmao
this has to be the battle royal mode cuz dmz mode only allow 3 person team, but i don't remember there being AI's in battle royal, or a stronghold
Every time I watch vik play he’s never been very good at judging if he can revive people or not
It wouldn’t be a game with Ethan if his game didn’t lag or freeze😂
Josh is somehow still ignorantly stupid in every game he plays lol
If you dont like this looting system you just want to play an easy game.
Thanks for posting vik! ❤️
These thumbnails 😆
How did you run across the water at the end. You dived once so it's obvious you should have been swimming in that deep of water.
Hey vic, it’s not I tagged someone it’s I snagged someone ❤
I’m so glad it’s back just to watch vikk
is any one else sad that there is no rebirth at the moment
Behz will be in 2040 and still have game problems and blame the game
vik to 10 mil
4:46 “sur le toit fais gaffes, ouais c est mort, viens on prend de la hauteur medhi” thoses french rebeux got smashed 5:37 “ il est où ce batard 😂”
i need to play with vik we will get 5 wins in 10 games at least
Uncensored behz is the best behz
Daaamn vikk is still going nuts rven after being inactive for long time
Vikk hacks
I’m not trying to hate, but the game looks the exact same as warzone 1.0
5:05 bit sus bro!
Man like WADAM

Behz's loot transition from good to sh*t epic
