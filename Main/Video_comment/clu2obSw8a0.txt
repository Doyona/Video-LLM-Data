Great match up..shitty ending
Hellofagame
Wirtz is so underrated
WHAT A TIE!
Didn’t even show all the PKs!!! Come on
3:10 Same old ridiculous penalty. Running to the ball and then pausing for like 1 sec before actually kicking. FIFA needs to ban this BS practice.
Aspirin > Oligarch
Not sure which tie was better between this one and Rennes v. Shaktar
Florian Wirtz is sensational!
I'm a fan of Diaby. He's incredibly fast and every FIFA FUT card of him shows him cracking a smile, he seems like the happiest football player.
HOW DO YOU LEAVE THE BIGGEST CRUCIAL MOMENT/GOAL OUT OF THE HIGHLIGHTS?!?!??!?!?!?!?!
What a game
Nubel is just another Rensing. Bayern should just let him go as he wishes.
Of all the penalty shots, why would you leave out the crucial miss at the finale? They included multiple shots where each side scored, which could be skipped instead since they didn’t impact the ending like the penalty miss. Just how, how can you accept that editing? So much production work, beautiful hd camera work, commentary, etc. going into this, and this edit gets approved without the missed penalty? Come on guys.
5:30 tf 🤣
It is sad that the waitress passed away after a few months since the episode aired. She seemed like a good person. The

Monaco sells their super stars and always start from scratch and cant win shit
Diaby Upgrades LFG. WP Leverkusen what a fantastic game
quality tie and a quality ref as well dont think he made a mistake
DIABY UPGRADE!!!!!!!!!!
All the highlights and you did not show the one penalty that Monaco missed that became the decisive point of the match???? WHY?????
Trash as2 penalty at the end lol
Should’ve done Diaby sbc
Frimpong is a monster what a game
why you dont show the penalty miss wtf
Impressive performance from Writz. Somehow his one-two remind me of Benzama lol. But ye he's quite calm and visionary with the ball.
Needed this for my diaby
The Golazo show is the best in the industry!
why wasn't the penalty miss shown?
Wow, what a game!
Thanks for the diaby upgrade
How are you guys so consistently shit at making highlights.  Two videos from today alone that didn't even show a crucial penalty miss.  20 minutes for absolute garbage quality is comical. You lot HAVE to be better
Wirtz, Adli, Diaby, Frimpong etc. Leverkusen have a fine crop of ballers.
lol didnt show the missed penalty. what a joke
One weird looking stadium
am I smoking dust or did they not show anyone miss a penalty? who made this bruh
That was a battle. When the UEL outdoes the UCL. Love the energy. Edit: WTF SHOW ALL THE PKS????!!!
Wirtz is the best young player in the whole world
So who missed the pk for Monaco???
Bro the Europa League ties were better than the Champions League ties ngl.
My diaby card will rank up now thank god 😂😂 now I need Borussia to win so Malen can rank up. Bundesliga is coming back into the picture. Good. Bayern was making it suck lol
20 min vid and don’t even show the most important pen 💀
How do y'all not show the Monaco penalty miss? It was literally the most important penalty of the entire fucking match lmao it's what knocked them out ffs
Why would you not show the penalty that was missed? SMH
Don’t care about the game just needed my Diaby upgraded
This leverkusen team is something special
Who miss?
Leverkusen played so poorly in their last Bundesliga game so I knew it was gonna be a walk in the park for Monaco but they surprised me here
Good matches.  Plenty of goals between these two!
20 minute highlights that's a new!!! Congrats to Leverkusen for the hard earned victory 👏👏
Ligue 1 still a complete crap league.
CBS and Fox sports are the worst. They can't even give us true HD and then they show horrible edits where critical moments of the matches are missing. I pay for paramount+ and video quality on that isn't great either.
Wirtz is crazy
Two clubs with no fans.
0 french teams in the round of 16 of europa league and only psg is the french team in the round of 16 of the champions league, every season we have the confirmation that it is well THE farmer league
Wtf? Didnt show the miss?
Lol 20 minutes of highlights and they forget the critical penalty saves at the end. But at least we caught all the substitutions and time wasting at the end!
Why were so many of the seats empty?
Let's goooo Xavi Alonso what a game
Monaco goalie is so fucking trash 🗑️🤦🏽‍♂️
Diaby sbc upgrade
Is Nubel?  Neuer’s younger brother 😂
What a match  so many chances
How did they pass if no one missed
Why would you not show the penalty miss
Why didn’t they show the penalty miss by monaco smh
Props to the channel for getting this video out so fast
who else is here for the diaby upgrade
What a match-up, 10 goals across 2 games is insane
