Love west ham. City fan
Ward Prose is the man who lead West ham in 6th position, he is very very good player,  England national must need him !  not saka
Вест хем продажные команда его место 2 лиги Англии уровень своей вчера показал 0
besok aku main di west ham
Why wasn't the penalty retaken he had no foot on the line does VAR not work when people play Arsenal?
Play like that vs arsenal and play like full piece of s*** vs Brighton, how it possible ?
Thank you West Ham 😊😊😊
❤
Good

Amazingggg
Amazing
Thank u Westham
D Moyes won the Hammers a European cup last season and are doing exceptionally well in both the Premier League and Europa League this season.  Those who wanted Moyes out are crazy and ungrateful.
マヴロパノスおめでとう、これからも応援してます
Wow arsenal You suck how do You Lost with team the man city was right You a cold team
Amazing
Ok
Wow
West Ham 😎🔥
I might be biased as a West Ham fan here but why is nobody talking about Mavropanos header? Was an absolute bullet. Literally perfect, and his movement to attack the ball was great as well. Real top quality goal
Ward is a g for that corner kick❤❤❤

After THAT Newcastle "goal" I honestly didn't think I'd see anything as corrupt as that ever again. I was mistaken. This one is even worse. Nothing short of an absolute corrupt disgrace which, of this carries on will boil over with either the fans or the players. It CANNOT and WILL NOT continue.
arsenal is shit
Ok
As an Arsenal fan I could feel that we cant score. What a defending West Ham have.
😮😮😮
Amazing liverpool
Zinchenko, again
Var should be embarrassed same as the villa game today for the penalty for them to win managers train your players to come behind the person with the ball clearing and fall over you will get a penalty kick heard it here first believe me
London is west ham

Permainan yg bagus sekali west ham kalahkan Arsenal 2 - 0 amazing
They improved a lot well deserved win for West Ham
Thank u westham. Liverpool fan

Ward prowse is too under-rated, best set piece delivery in the league.
Pop- GOONERS 😂😅😊

A big fat L for Arse!😂 I'm Mcluvin it
Well done West Ham, from Man City!
wow
Luar biasa
tttt
Arsenal had 30 shots West Ham only had 3 West Ham  are trash Arsenal, going to win the league West Ham on, even going to make Champions League😢
Stupid arteta who signed zinchenko well knowing that he's not ready to fit in left back and he even said it when leaving man city that he wants to play in midfield so instead of foolish arteta to look for a left back since he never wanted Tierney he went to mess up with our money on buying havertz can you imagine that madness
Arteta out
Defensive masterclass
What! West Ham even missed a penalty 😂😂
I'll Do a Pushup every like this comment gets.
Amazing
Now you have a Greek in your team, winning the league is inevitable.
I speak for every Arsenal fan when I say that West Ham truly won our respect. A defensive masterclass against a timid attack
As a life long Arsenal fan it hurts to admit it but I have to admire Man City's business acumen  They sell Arsenal two duds in Jesus and Zincenco knowing they would do nothing and use the money to strengthen City immensely purchases  including the world's greatest striker.
As a Arsenal fan congrats u beat a champions league team

Karma is not a bitch,it's a lady ❤Ynwa 👌
West Ham... West Ham ..❤
Δεν ειναι γκει ειναι αυτος που εβαλε το γκολ και καιει!!!
West Ham are on Fire first Utd who us at Anfield failed to beat and now they hit up The Gunners Indefatigable and just phenomenal Well done West Ham
Stranded lose against terrible teams as always well done West Ham
I often wonder what’s the point of 70+% possession and end up  losing. Have to question strategy of it.
Mampos ars
When my body ‘shouts’ STOP, my mind ‘screams’ NEVER
When i watch West Ham on TV you dont seem to see much of Soucek in general play but the number of vital goals he gets is amazing.
WESTHAM CITY 🩵⚒️
They got some money in bank aswel west ham looking good
Dinos is back 🔥
United and Arsenal last 5 games same same. Respect united.
I love West Ham
Roy Keane predicted what we all know, it’s a north London thing #chokers

Moves out? Really?
That is a HUGE victory alright!  Go on the Irons!   Londons most iconic football club! YNWA
Hahaha arsenal 65mil man for nothing...
Paul Tierney's tem Ham... COYG ❤
thanks west ham that advantage for liverpool
thanks west ham utd once again for doing us city a tremendous favour just like last season..we owe u a lot ❤
The Real Teacher for Arteta
Benhrama missing penalty 😢, I'm gutted.
Rice became prime Maguire.
Unbelievable for Arsenal well done West Ham
Not going to lie, it's not an easy watching this west ham team play. We have so little possession against most teams, however there is no denying it's effectiveness by our league position. Great result.
I said we need a finisher period
Тот случай, когда Арсенал был не готов к матчу, а Вест Хем сыграл на полную. Поздравляю Вест Хем
Arsenal back in the mud pass it on
Big deal

Arsenal begins the downward slide 🛝 📊
👐 chill- Mavropados
Arsenal what happenend
dunno what people r saying but goal n1 should not of counted you cannot control the ball out of play and then proceed to score a goal . Should have been 1-0 . Arsenal , you could have done better
Bigups Mo KUDUS ❤️👍🇬🇭
Lupa nyogok wasit😅😅😅
Arsenal should easily win this. With All the missed chances arsenal should be 5 up ..pure hard luck..
Arsenal lawak🎉
asoooooooooooooo
Great job Hammers, well deserved!
As an arsenal fan, we absolutely suck. Congrats to west ham!!! Hope Liverpool win the league x
Bravo mauropanos from aek athens
阿仙奴太令人失望！註定冇冠軍相！！
Vamooooooooooooooo\o/ Hammerssssssssssss
Alvarez is mediocre at best. Why do you people have your bar so low? Don’t be conformists…
West Ham looking good lately. Climbing the table now higher than Newcastle, Man United and Brighton
The elephant has fallen off the tree 😂 liverpool is 1st
Fair play for Mavrepanos 👏
Arsenal isn't good for westham united period..  Home and away defeat
Bruh,moment! I wish I watched the match. As a massive LFC supporter I ve always thought the world of WHU.Brave guys,way to go!
I wonder how a hammer can break a gun😂
Coach Justin nangis darah
Hahaha Liverpool is coming buddy hahahahah 😂
thanks to West Ham, from a liverpool supporter
Final comment Arsenal doesn't deserve to be champions simple
Коэффициент 9.90)
Well done West Ham, from Man City!
Арсенал подвёл
Arsenal should try for Isco and de gea at that timeI m very upset about these things even if they try James ward prowse it could be happened at that time .Lot of good players are clubless at time.Now it’s too late .
The only thing would stop Arsenal from winning the EPL Championship is their defense.
Looking forward to that extra £20m for Rice
West Ham have good players, especially in midfield and attack, but does anyone enjoy watching teams that play like this? I love watching football, but I almost never watch games when West Ham are playing. This style of play can be effective, but it certainly isn't entertaining.
Не описуемый боль у которых  кто поставил на тб 2,5
1:15...THE BALL CHANGES TRAJECTORY BY ITSELF!!! Check how the ball moves after hitting the cross bar before it touches the ground during the second goal
That penalty should of been retaken raya cheated 😊
Thanks West Ham for winning me 50 pounds used it for shopping in Lidl 😅
😁
David's contract?
The gooners are back to bottle it again 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Arsenal are rubbish. Star boy is overrated. Rice is the worst
benrahma is shiiiit
Declan Rice….that was a 105 million pound tackle if i ever saw one 🤷
Who wants to sack our manager now? 😅😅😅 Glory to Moyes! Glory to Ukraine!
❤it Liverpools league 🎉🎉🎉
Liverpool 1
Well done Hammers! Peace to all...
Looking for the Moyes out crew 💀
MOYES ... IN?
Rice should have stayed. Poor Poor Man
The Alvarez guy is a loco 😅
Benrahma's wink before the penalty is a sign of friendship and I felt that he didn't want to embarrass his former teammate Rice. 😂😂
stupid arsenal ,how want english champion premier league
What a header that is from Mavropanos, goals that go in off the bar/post are always beautiful to watch!  That's a great goal, I'm so happy for him!  He's proving to be such a good signing, such an important player for us now! 😁 I still can't believe that we've won this game though, I keep pinching myself!  We've beaten Arsenal at the Emirates! 😳🤯🤯
MC back as favourites, Liv will get 2nd, Arsen 3rd, Villa 4th.
this basmati dude is fuckin sluggish
If someone said to me at the start of the season that we would get 6 points from our away games at Tottenham and Arsenal, I would have had concerns for their mental health.  ⚒️
westham and city my favorite teams
The fact we managed to take no goal without our duo Aguerd-Zouma makes it more impressive
As a Saints fan Im happy that Prowsey went to West Ham and nobody else! Good stuff 👏 👍
As a Liverpool fan, I just wanna say thank you. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
Westham on a "giant" killing run
Elephant hammered
Alhamdullillah❤❤❤ YNWA
Credit to West Ham for beating Man Utd at the weekend and beating Arsenal mid-week
Come on West Ham. YNWA
Top performance tanks for fans liverpool❤
Typical  gooners chookers..🙈🐔🐓
Thanks,, 👍😂👌
Credit where credit is due. Arsenal knew they would sit back and defend especially since the other losses were of a similar style. They should have changed tactics and allowed West Ham to attack and then countered. Lessons learnt hopefully
wonder kid was behind this victory!
West ham top 👍
It one of the best TEAM performances defensively from the mighty hammers I've ever seen,  very proud of this team and this whole year has been a year I will never forget ❤❤
Yes he done well to stop those 32 shots on goal 😂
Договорняк
No Moyes out today then
Why didn't go Souček to penalty.. in national team have 100% scoring
Nice game 😂😂😂😂😂🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
As a City fan, thank you, West Ham. Now, City's season begins from here.
great pen tbh just unlucky but we should for sure get bowen or paqueta on pens
My boy west ham baby
Arsenal no win premier league for ever for ever for ever
Man City Liverpool 2 teams england only
0:35 love how they skipped over the controversy
Huge respect to West Ham with 555K subscribers
As a Liverpool fan........I will say well done to westham
this is half of the season, it's time for Arsenal fall down😂
I think liverpool will win premier league cup... arsenal have already started shown there loss...
Let's laugh at saka 🤡
IIIIIIRONS ❤
This admin is biased he didn't show Arsenal's chances
If u cannot go the extra mile Arsenal looosers longtime...go to a chinese massage insteed 😮😂😂😂
West has conquered London!
i hate zinny
Chokesenal choking again
Take the dick as we say in Greece!!😂😂😂Enjoy your customers Mavropanos( blackpanos) 😂
Liverpool and Man City fans delighted with recent EPL results.
Said bernama 😅
Great win for west ham, Great defensive work, We were toothless and have been so in too many games, I don't think west ham fans would settle for that kind of football in all honesty though, That's not what they are all about.
This season is clearly fixed😂so many upsets it's unheard of
Come on City 😮
MOTM for the match is Ogbonna. He did very very well
the premier league is on sale. Bids accepted for the next match location.
ball out you clowns
Your first goal was out imo but other than that your team was an absolute unit
👍😝YNWA
Tetap semangat Arsenal, dan terus kompak sampai akhir musim,, saya yakin anda akan mendapatkan gelar liga Inggris 🎉🎉..  Dari fans setiamu  ,, salam dari INDONESIA
I’m just here for kudus 🇬🇭
Selamat ya buat westham dapat poin penuh 😊❤❤
Arteta and the goalie - no win proposition
Hats off to rice for not complaining about the penalty decision and a well saved penalty. Great result hammers 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Thanks hammer....
If they would've scored that penalty 😢
the way he took that penalty was completely unprofessional.
Based on the slipping scenario of no handball agsainst Odergaaed vs LFac surely it  shouldn't have been penalty against Rice as that was a bigger slip 😂
Arsenal have bottled another year
Arsenal on top of the table will always be like Day 1, they will def come down
As an hammer incredible performance, they had the ball majority of the game but we were crucial when we have the ball rarely Alvarez incredible performance same goes with paqueta before he got off what a game for west ham crucial 3 points there. Bit disappointing from Benny that game but it’s fine
hammermen ⚒️💪 on character 👏
KROENKE OUT !!! The Kroenkes are the Kiss of Death !! Arsenal have won virtually nothing with Kroenke at the helm and will not win anything of significance again until they are fully removed from Arsenal !
liverpool top of the table
Liverpool top of the league 💥 😂
Mid height, telegraphed, no element of surprise/trickery in it. A poor penalty. WestHam missed out on a chance to make it look really, really dirty, and humiliating for the hallowed, almighty le arse!
I don’t think I’ve seen a better defensive team effort from West Ham. Absolutely superb to block as many shots as we did and absorb so much pressure for 95+ minutes. #COYI
Арсик мечтает 😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
What the fuck is wrong with Arsenal
Every West Ham player deserves this win. Kudus joining the team has brought a dynamic change and pressure.
Арсенал,позор тебя
Guess who is going to bottle the league again .
We got robbed
Didn't expect arsenal to start bottling it so early to be honest.
Well played, Hammers! From a Liverpool supporter, you made my day.
Вест-Гем найкращий клуб Англії
Scoring against your former employer in their backyard is just satisfying
West ham made use of their chances Arsenal didn’t
Moyes - Westham True Love
И снова Зина привез...
That was a terrible penalty… the Keeper literally showed him where he was going. Should have been 3-0
Зинченко не уровень Арсенала, много ошибок.
Happy Hammer new year 🎉
Now I see why Emeritus Jose Mourinho Said to win the title M. CITY 51% AND Liverflop 49%. Arsenal no chance 😂 😂😂
You see Arsenal's FOOLISHNESS again? The team has learnt nothing from last season. Lack of CHARACTER! Could have wrapped up the title even as of now because the main challengers are....also messing around!
Arsenal the most cringe fans in the world. Anyone but arsenal.
Thanks for the Xmas present West Ham, from Liverpool.
Next time give the pen to Kudus ;)
Thanks alot Aresnal you useless pricks
Poor highlights
Thank you so much west ham, for letting us (Liverpool) retain the top spot at exactly midseason
Анониры жидко обосрались.
As man u forced fan, I am laughing at those arsenal fans who mocked man u at the hand of west ham last week. tit for tat. and this result means a lot to me as I want liverpool to remain on top instead of Arsenal.
😂😂😂😂i should have watched this match... Arsenal still winning the league
THOMAS SOUCEK  HE ALWAYS ARRIVES PRECISELY WHEN HE MEANS TOO  HE NEVER PULLS OUT  IN THE BOX OR OUT   POTATO SALAD !!!!
"The King of Kings" Triple H will be proud of this. 👑🦁🤼‍♂️⚒️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇺🇸
Arsenal bottled it 😣
Really, including yesterday, Arsenal have lost twice to West Ham this season and people still think the win was just luck and unexpected
David Raya is just a whiter version of Onana.
Some of our players like Martinelli have lost form completely. We need to trust of the academy boys
Sory i'am no subscribe
Sorry i'am no suscrebe
A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty
I dont understand how again title goes away from Gunners... I really dont, when others make wrong steps also Arsenal makes them and doesnt wanna take advantage of those... ❤ Arsenal lets go guys bring the title home
Liverpool fan here. Thanks.
Motivation will almost always beat mere talent
Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me
When you think it’s too late, the truth is, it’s still early
If you fall asleep now, you will dream. If you study now, you will live your dream
good job
Arsenal spoil my bet, just to score one goal.the will remain where the are.
Good win for the Hammers Arsenal was just toothless upfront
Μπράβο ρε Κωνσταντίνε! Άντε και καλύτερα.
Arsenal vs var that's it
Perfect Irons⚒
Thank you West Ham from  a Liverpool supporter 🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽💯🙏🏽
Ward prowse is too under-rated, best set piece delivery in the league.
Westham please why didn't you guys let Kudus play the penalty 😢. He could have scored easily
OMG!!! West Ham beats Man U, Wolves, and ARSEnal! What a way to end the year for the Hammers!!! Watching Soucek do his helicopter goal celebration is just the icing on the cake!!! What a time to be a West Ham fan!!!
Alvarez is surely on his way to becoming one of the very best DM in the world. West Ham need to keep Moyes and stop the sack rumours asap. Moyes will bring stability in the long term and make WH progress. He lacked trophies in the past but now that he's got one with WH, he will likely win more.
How i wish Kudus started the league with west ham.... like we would be in the top 3 by now😂😂...the guy is absolutely unplayable and difficult to dribble pass him.... The loss against Liverpool was just a problem with the coach because he had the selection wrong...  Kudus, Bowen, Paqueta,Alveraz, Prowse would have been hell... But he was trying to rest these players for the united game and it caused us greatly...  Love from Ghana... COYI❤
Liverpool 🥶🥶🥶🥶
I think it wasn't fair
Always show respect to every opponent despite how you rate them.
arsenal have let us down
👍👍👍
Maybe Westham can sell Arsenal their keeper in exchange for Raya.
A good team that deserves better technical guidance.
bro west ham away jersey looks smart.
Goat west ham
Well played West Ham. Don’t worry Arsenal, I’m a longtime Liverpool supporter but I’m not celebrating just yet because there are a lot of matches still to be played and plenty of time for you, us, Man City or someone else to win the title or lose it. Titles aren’t won or lost in December. It should be a good race to the finish with some exciting games to be played.
Up the hammers ⚒️
Is this a fookin Krankenhaus 😂😂😂
A few unexpected results yesterday which will help Liverpool and Man City . Leagues are not won at christmas but its a crucial period with games coming thick and fast . Its unlikely that any team will take maximum points from all these fixtures
Why you dont show the safas aureola l, his do a good job😊
Soucek new legend of WHU? He beat Lampard
I am not a West Ham fan, but can someone tell me why I am always hearing talk of Moyes being replaced? I dont get it
Emerson wow 😮
Kudos to kudus😊
WTF😢😢
I have no idea whats going on but Zinchenko is totally out off game
YES BOYZ ! MADE MY HPNY , COF x9 ON WEST HAM WAS BRRILIANT
As a liverpool fan thank you so much West Ham. One lucky draw at anfield and they started to think they are title winners.
Pains me to say credit to the irons😢
WEST HAM WON A EUROPEAN CUP LAST SEASON.... Liverpool are on course to win the league this season.... last time this happened ENGLAND WON SOMETHING.... KEEP DREAMING ❤
God i love this team.
😍
i am happier thna you cause i am a lverpool fan and now we are on top
Wow I'm glad I staked @0x0meta game on twitter, he specifically told me this match was going to end 0-2 Correct Score 😊
Declan Rice is a West Ham agent 😂😂😂
David moyes team is machine
let's go west ham i'm the hammers from tasikamalaya city
Fools just because of they beat arsenal abeg forget about west ham United
The camera man was so bad
Arsenal gave West Ham 3 points along with a 105 mil quid.  Love irons.
Michael Oliver should be in the WWE not soccer.... he's a  Freud... bcos he decided who wins
Michael Oliver should be in the WWE not soccer.... he's a  Freud... bcos he decided who wins
Alhamdulillah.....arsenal you lose....😊😊😊
Thank you Mauropanos from a Greek Liverpool supporter..!
Arsenal forwards have been whack of late. We need to change things upfront.
Michael Oliver  is a bad referee..... but they put him they to do their dirty job for them... Africans wake up those muthaf**kers are you f**kin with us
After loosing 5 1 to Liverpool, this was a shocker 😂
The same foul from saka to tsimikas,he did it again to kudu.
Great Arsenal ..we win together and lose together..Great game
Finally West Ham is doing great matches! Come on hammers!
Well deserve for Arsenal, loser
Not even 2024 and arsenal already bottling again
Haha mancity will crawl back to the top
Ziocenko is katastrof player out with hem
As Manchester City fan all I can say is Thank You West Harm for that. Indeed You are a brother.Shukran😊😂
Arsenal wasted a lot chances and that westham united GK is wizard 😅
Incredible work Westham United our brothers in arms😂😂 this is very happiest moment of my life it feels so sweets very very when Arsenal is crying 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Вау! Красавцы молотки!! Спасибо за игру 😎💪
Credit to westham. Thank you from city
Thank you west ham ❤
Ahi esta la diferencia entre el arsrnal y el manchester city!  Uno es grande cuando tiene que serlo junto con su tecnico ! Y el otro solo se conforma junto con su tecnico!
Arsenal don't deserve EPL
Up the Hammers!!! David and the team keep delivering the Xmas goodies!!
Well done the hammers
Hammers hammering all they neighbours. Arsenal can't seem to get a clean sheet with Raya in goal
Thank you, West Ham, and congratulations on the win. Villa fan,,❤️

If Man U hadn't sacked Moyes they would be a big club by now.

Amazing how the English pay thousands a year to watch migrant teams play football in the UK  why don't you also support teams in Europe
This current West Ham side is quality, the balance of the players works perfectly. Bowen and Kudus are excellent on the counter, with Paqueta, Soucek, Alvaraz & Ward-Prowse. All hardworking players in defence and also very capable in attack.
Arsenal kehabisan bensin 😮
Good job west ham(iam a city fan)😂💪
Poor performance from arsenal,how can we win the league if we can't score we really suck really really suck we need a striker n bench martineli he is is really costing us
Arsenal fans: we will win the league this year   Westham fans: I don't think so
Arsenal played shit
Just to be honest with you guys. I don't understand Premier League. Jesus Christ, how on earth Arsenal flopped like this against West Ham?   You'll never see thing like this in France League or German League. 🤣
كفو شخلهم شخل 😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

Woke up in the morning and knowing this game, what a good news 😂🎉🎉

As a spurs fan, seeing this is so good
I always enjoy to see Arse lose.
Another assist by JWP damn
Defeated Chelsea, Spurs, Man utd and now Arsenal... Moyes is cooking as always.
Arsenal just 😭= 🤭😆😆😆😆🤫
Good chance for Liverpool to cement the top stop with a win over Newcastle next week. Hopefully we get it 💯❤️💪🏻
WEST HAM UNİTED ❤❤❤ SEVİYORUZ
As a liverpool fan I am HAPPY
Это называется АПЛ.😮
@0:45 why doesn't Saka hit that first time with his left foot?
Penalty shot as not executed well, the last few steps gave it away!
Bravo🎉
Arsenal never disappoints us 😅😅
Cmom hammers💙
Moyes OUT survey 1%, Moyes IN 88% Not sure 11%! 😊
Thank you West Ham
Academic footnote 😂😂😂😂
Следующий матч Вест Хэм пройграет условному Шеффилду или Борнмуту. Это АПЛ детка😅
Hammered 😂
LIVERPOOL AND CITY ARE THE ONLY TEAMS THAT CAN HAVE A WINNING RUN OF 12 TO 15 GAMES IN A ROW. PPL FORGET THAT EVERY SEASON LIVERPOOL ALSO HAD A WININNING RUN. LAST SEASOB WE PLAYED BAD , BUT TOWARDS THE END WE WON ABOUT 10 GAMES IN A ROW AND DREW 1 GAME IN THE END. WE ONLY LOST ONCE SINCE LAST SEASON
As a Chelsea fan,i enjoyed seeing the beating arsenal  got
Edson Alvarez ❤❤❤❤ Mexico Forever 🇲🇽

West Ham for EPL TITlE.
I’m a Cardiff city fan through and through but a small handful of the ICF used to be friendly with the Soul Crew in the 80’s. They’d come and support Cardiff against other London clubs. My father’s love for the Hammers came from that and fighting on the terraces along side them and it’s passed down to us. I’ve loved the hammers ever since hearing about that.  Well done West Ham ❤️ From your Taffy neighbours!
Is Arsenal chocking again?
Quick question...no genuine question cause I don't actually understand ...why was there no west ham player near the rebound of that penalty
Modar luu
Zinchenko the most overrated player in PL
Kudos to west ham  As a Liverpool fan I thank you
matur nuwun west ham 😂
As an riverly Chelsea fan I see this is an absolute nothingness af 😑
Hahahha 🦩🦩🦩🦩🦩
FANTASTIC WEST HAM WELL DONE LADS GOD BLESS YOU ALL AMEN XXXXXXX
Thank you West Ham United. We City fans consider this as a gift. 💎
One of the worst penalty take!
lousy penalty take.  lucky it wasn't importantv
I love everything so far and i'm very happy about this result but please let trusted players take penalty shoots from now onwards😗. Today we might say "that's fine we still won" but another time it might be our only chance.
Thank you west ham 😂😂 #ynwa
David Raya knows the penalty direction of Said Benrahma, his ex teammate at Brentford 😆
Thank you WHU!!! YNWA
Factory reset
Straiker arsenal emang beda.  Tunggu hari yg baik dan pemain musuh galau baru bisa nyetak goll
A Saka Rice never beats a Paquetá Rice!
To @Arteta and team management: Nketia instead of Jesus in the starring 11... You will find out why I have reason.
So I guess Rice wasn't the reason West ham played well over the last few years.
Arteta:" we gave everything to Westham- 100ML Plus 2/2 wins: They deserve to win , Rice gifted them a pen.too!! Congz."
Rice problem  Ward prowse solution
Rice was the problem
Liverpool can beat WH 5-1, but cant beat arsenal in anfield😅
Буккмекеры сделали спектакль.
Which team has ever won premier league with Jesus as a lead striker? Not Man city!! When they tried , #Liverpool won their COVID trophy##The following  season Pep called his houseboy to take his offcut to Arsenal. Surely you cant with Jesus.I keep telling Arsenal fans.
good job Hammers!
Отмолотили
Kudus can do better with penalties so why didn't you allow him to take it?
❤⚒️
Thanks Hammer ❤❤ #YNWA
Being a westham and arsenal fan, mixed felling😂
COY Hammers
ไอ้ต้า มันปัญญาอ่อนรึเปล่า แรมเดล เหนียวหนึบ ไม่เอา แม่งใช่ไอ้ราญ่า อยู่ได้ กูยังไม่เห็นเซฟสวยๆ สักลูก
Wow😂 absolutely WH
Никто не хочет на первое место. Все лидеры теряют очки в каждом  туре. Поздравляю с победой.
Zinchenko always in the right time and place  . . . for the other team.
cop that declan rice u spanner never should of left
Thank you west ham for opening title race ik i could count on you guys
Every player on that field poured their heart and soul, giving an incredible 110%. The sheer fight and desire displayed were nothing short of brilliant. What an outstanding result for West Ham, and to claim 6th place is truly unbelievable! ⚒⚒⚒
30 shots to 5 and we lost. We definitely need a new striker
As predicted, Arsenal far from the premiere league title .
thx westham , liverpool fans
would of been perfect if benrahma scored the penalty. Cant make this up loving see this performance from west ham.
Mana yg bilang saliba bek terbaik 😂
As a Liverpool fans, Im...
I love westham, bcause kudus and Wardprowse. From Man United fans
glad to see rice on our side today 🎉
+3😍👏🏻
Álvarez and Soucek showing who the best defensive midfielders in London are
ASSernal back to the default setting ❤
Liverpool fans, thanks west ham.. 👍🏼👏🏻
Wow benrahma is a terrible player...give ward prowse penalties next time...as a Liverpool fan, thank you so much West Ham ❤
Haaaa ... Hot n cold gunners ... Gunners Hammered
From a Liverpool fan. Thanks hammers 😂😂🙏🙏🙏🙏
Moyes out crowd will be so disappointed with this result.
Kudos to West Jam for making FOOLS happy (to temporarily top EPL). 😂  For Arsenal, once a Gooners, always a Goners! 😅
lol lovely. Thank you, Hammers. ☺ You're going along very nicely now, eh.
Fair play to rice donating us a penalty x
There should be a thread started : As a Liverpool fan . Btw im not a Liverpool fan. .. , just sick of their fans  comments from Liverpool fans. Why not just give your opinion on the match and say no more . Ye are doing f all the last 32 years , 1 title
Sussex saved his team once again. It proves potato salad is better than Rice...
Good job West Ham! Thanks for smashing Assnal! YNWA😂
Revenge for Liverpool after the handball incident 🎉🎉🎉
Thanks West Ham ❤
М-да уж,посмотрев обзор больше нет вопросов почему Сити каждый год берет чемпионство)
WESTHAM ARE MASSIVE EVERYWHERE WE GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIOOO🫡💥 what a pleasure to watch. 🤌🏼
Nice nice west ham😂
Declan you wrong club
Up the hammers!
Fully deserved win. Well played from the hammers
Thanks for teaching us a lesson hammers
TQ west ham...anda hebat...  from YNWA😀👍
Thank you West ham as a Liverpool fan❤
As an Arsenal fan.... u honestly deserved it guys. We were shit af
Thanks The Hammers #YNWA
Arsenal is a joke 😂 We could have had 3 thanks to Ricey. Emirates is a joke, so are their fans. Up the ⚒️.
😂😂😂 Arsenal mleyot 😂
as a Liverpool fan I am over the moon 😂
Nice 🎉
Rangers; just because 🇬🇧
❤😅
Конченное дно Арсеноль,черти убогие👎👎👎👎👎
Benny chose to save the gooners blushes. just slightly. COYI!
Poor Rice,he move to bottler small club from Europe champion.He should move to BIG club who always getting Trophies.
ah, shyt.. why take a pinalty is so hard for some player..
Geniunely pondering why those who want Moyes out argue that our player's actual ability isn't fully utilised and that we play too negative. Every single player on that pitch gave everything they got, clean sheet with 2 goals away. If we did play positive we're getting pumped 5-1 again.
Thank you the hammer ❤  City stay margin points and i'm cityzen Indonesian
Shit started happening for arsenal
Take away the one winning player they have in Havertz & they collapse, shock horror
Yall cooked us fair win
Said so good
Alvarez cooked
Raya in goal😂😂
Funny seeing the ground empty after 85 minutes. Self entitled pri*ks. And lego head couldn't bring himself to credit West ham. Absolute charlatan.
West ham played brilliant football this season ❤
West Ham United Fc Senior Legendaris Muda U 24 All Stars
Un vrai Conard c'est benrahma
Arsenal gonna win the league my ass
Bowen on pens
Ez win
Ahhhhhhhh, this is the part of where the ELEPHANT 🐘 started to FALL 😂😂😂😂
JWP should be taking spot kicks
wuoww yeaaah nice west ham
Arteta should be responsible! When Trossard was on form he did not let him played on full, always rely on his 2 city players who are mostly useless, ramsdale is benched and many other mistakes! Arsenal will never win the league
Thank you West Ham!! A Liverpool fan speaking!
this is why man city will win the league
Bennnny, you spared their blushes aaaaaahhhhhhh. Man we move
I'm an Everton fan but I always have a soft spot for a Moyes team. Very very well played to take 3 points off of an excellent Arsenal side.
Thanks for the hammer blow. Can you sell Bowen to Liverpool. Please 😅
Arsenal should focus on UCL now! We can’t win the EPL
Arsenal gak akan pernah juara
⚒️⚒️the true master of London⚒️⚒️
Flat atmosphere (only singing Arsenal Forever gives a hint of an atmosphere), fans leaving before full time. Arsenal fans really are some of the worst in the league. Full credit to their team, at least they bring life to the Emptyrates
Oh dear what have we here a complete collapse from arsealls.
Hahaha. Rice
God bless West Ham!
Bro if Arsenal shot the ball on most of their chances they would have won. Idk what Arteta is saying to these players but whatever he’s saying it’s not working.
As a Leicester fan this is so hilarious 😂😂 Thanks trashsenal for this masterpiece of cold ❄️🥶🥶🧊
Yey otra victoria más de los Hammers apoyando al equipo de un mexicano porque no pueden estar solos 🇲🇽
Thank You West Ham...♥️♥️♥️
fn up ALL the over 2.5 !!!!!
Arsenal 😂😂😂
So no league winning this season?
Meriam lontong 🙏
Bukayo mama
200 mil, still can't beat David Moyes. WENGER WOULD NEVER!
Le goal keeper ya niker SA mere la puttain esti de calis de tabarnak
Tq to west ham
I feel that any team that took advantage of Liverpool will not perform well in the next match .
wankers costed me 554 quid
Arsenal needs a top quality striker and goal keeper.
Thank you West ham , from Liverpool fan
The good guys win.....
30.       shot.          4 80%.    possn.     20%
The Arsenal we know and love is back
hammers beatin the gunners this is why this league is the best.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭YaNWA 👍👍👍
Wet Ham
Congrats West Ham for that unpredictable win👏I am Liverpool fan and I so admire Bowen and Kudus both are amazing👌
Awakeennbeerus predicted this.
Cry to arsenal fans
Só esse arsenal me tirou , não vez nem um gol
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂...
MASSIVE ⚒️⚒️⚒️
Bukayo gingga one season wonder 😂
What happened lucas paquta🤔
The arsenal are Back
This just prove that west ham is doing way better without Declan Rice..
Not not good
😂😂😂😂 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😅😅😅😅
why on earth was benrahma allowed to take this pen.
I guess Man utd fans will understand now.
As a guy who believes in “London is Blue” I would like to congratulate Westham for this sweet win 😂💙💙💙
No noise now
Are you mugs still wanting moyes out   the man who keeps getting us into Europe and wins us a trophy in europe   , anyone who wants moyes out can fuck off the man has done miracles his kept us in the prem  left come back and done it again  and then top 6 and 7 finishes and a trophy   fuck me what more do you cunt wants
Bh
To mature is to realize that West Ham have individual quality that teams like Arsenal, Liverpool and City (best of the best) need. Paqueta, Bowen and Kudus all start for Arsenal at the moment, whether you like it or not. Massive credit to West Ham, they couldnt have spent that Rice money better
Win man utd and arsenal... well done
Thank you West Ham from Liverpool with ❤
Kuduuuuuuuuuuus
Arsenal starting to sink already its not even new year as yet😂
West Ham you played a great game🎉 Its up to Klopp and the boys now. YNWA❤
Don't underestimate underdogs
I'd only arsenal had a prodigy like Antony they'd win the league.
Potato salad baby
WELL DONE W HAM 😂😂😂. LIVERPOOL CHAMPION FOR THE YEAR 2023 FOR NOW!! 😂😂😂😂😂...YNWA
Someone ask rice what’s the score?😍
Already knew Bottle job imminent

What a solid defensive play,I've never seen West ham defend so brilliant as a team and i was proved wrong i must say
Arsenal had face WHU 2 times since Rice transfer and lost 2 games
Gotta feel for benny 😢
YUUGE win 🎉🎉🎉
👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️
That was basically our B team too. Zouma and Aguerd were out and Paqueta left in the 26th minute. Great win boys. COYFI
Ward-prowse is something else
🙏 Dear SantArsenal 🎅,, please give the ALMIGHTY IRONS a Victory ✌️ upon this day,...and it was granted!!! Man U & Arse back-to-back Baby!!! HAMMERTIME!!!  🛠🛠 ⚒️ 🛠 (CHEERS DEC, 🍻  MEET ME IN THE CARPARK for your money!!!) 😂
Arsenal runs out of ideas. Do not believe in magic
Satu kata untuk arsenal : Mampusssss 😂
Raya of his line pen should of been taken again. Arsenal are pathetic runners up 😂
Shameful refereeing...How can you not show a yellow card for that challenge by D.Rice, leading to the penalty?
Rice got cooked
We made the title race to so🤐🤐🤐😡😡😡😓😂😂😂🤩🤩
Rice had a little slip and lunges for the ball = Penalty. Odegaard had a little slip hand dribbled the ball = no penalty. EPL in a nutshell
With Álvarez on the field, our goal is safe. It arrived recently and I already love it.
Only a few chances but West Ham  grips them and turns into two goals. The counter attack is so effective and West Ham deserved a win.
Wheare are those ungrateful west ham fan who want moyes out 🤭😂??
Gotta laugh spurs fan thanking west ham for beating arsenal and get hammered by brighton
Saka is a fraud.
Thank you West Ham   Liverpool fan
great performance by west ham, arsenal were terrible
Arsenal, perfect bottlers 😂😂😂
Rice should get a red
Thank you West Ham, from a Liverpool fan.
😂😂😂😂
Congrats to West Ham ❤🎉
nice game, congrate hammer
Moyes out.😂 Fucking spastards..
Well played 😂
Good job to all the Westham players😊
they seem to have forgotten the part where the ball goes out before the first goal...
Can Arsenal win this year  The answer is no
Skill issue for arsenal
Terima kasih wesham liverpool ttp d pucuk
As a Tottenham fan thank you West Ham for beating arsenal
Beginilah yg di nobatkan sebagai Liga terbaik di dunia.. Nama besar bukan brti tidak mungkin menerima kekalahan,. Semua klub di Liga inggris selalu mengejutkan.
Shameful to see our fans leaving early, honestly it’s like they forget where we were 5 years ago.
Thanks west ham . ynwa
Coyi u r the best ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Arsenal what’s your problem now days your game is a fully dirty🤮🤮
Eddy is the best
A masterpiece of art from David Moyes, especially Mavropanos.
This season west ham 💥💣💣
Arsenal eskrepap😂
A missive result for @westhamunited⚒️
Every single one of those players gave 110%. The fight and desire was so brilliant to see. What an outstanding result...6th place is unbelievable ⚒⚒⚒
Credit to West Ham. No excuses from me. You defended as a unit and took your chances tonight, unlike us who lacked accuracy with tame shots. Fair play.
Unfortunately, Benrahma missed a penalty kick. We missed Benrahma 🇩🇿  level 😰
As a Liverpool fan but I also congratulate West Ham, a deserved victory. Condolences to Arsenal, but the season is still long and there are still many opportunities ahead.
First
Des coeurs ❤ pour West Ham 🎉🎉🎉🎉💋💋💋✅💪🏽💪🏽
