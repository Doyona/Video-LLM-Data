Truly my dear.theres no end to your decor.l love it.
A DIY for all this without going to dollar tree for buying
I would have spray painted after assembly.
Hi this is Cindy K.   Can you please do a floor candle holder design 🙏🏽.  Thanks 😊
Stack two or three for a taller table. Or do two or three wide adding a longer piece of glass.
Nice!! You were able to get the zip ties tight enough so that the dowels wouldn't  slip?
You are so talented
Olá tudo bem assista os seus vídeos do seu trabalho falo português mas seu trabalho é uma obra de arte a coisa mais linda que eu já vi
👌
Keep up the good work

Im😊cus she loves Gold.. me too

It has always been absolutely wonderful
I love your voice
You go girl. I love watching you create your masterpieces. Great incentives.
Love it
You are my new spirit animal..lol
I am going to use this idea or close to it for a room divider! Thank you so much for the beautiful idea
Real pretty
The cutting of the mats are not equal straught
love all your creations and ideas, I can watch you all day, love DIY's but in Italy there is no dollar store, everything is so expensive, could never find any of the material that you use.  and I have dogs that chew up everything, I can only dream
Thanks 😊🙏🏽blessings 🙌appreciate!!
I love how you added options for alternate materials to use This was so helpful
Beautifull
WOW. YOU REALLY THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. BEAUTIFUL JOB
Those are very pretty. I love your creativity. ❤️
Brilliant!  Very beautiful...
Good evening  I  love your videos you are so talented.
You're SOOOOOO talented! Keep up  the great ideas and making our homes more beautiful!♥️♥️♥️
Smart person you are everything you make is so beautiful ❤😊
It's Beautiful for All year and to sczh ish it up for Holliday's put some bulbs and leaves.. THANKX..🙏👍🐝🌄
You’re awesome! You make it look so easy! 💜
I thought it looked Great!
I was thinking room divider but you came through with a whole table. The queen of DIY for sure! I've been following you for years now and I still live your Diys.
I love watching you create beautiful  stuff you are so talented I’m retired nurse and would love to learn how to make stuff for my home where do I go to learn crafts
We used these for square lamp shades with silver paint also the round wreath same idea made a round lamp shade for our retro designed office space. It's a great idea we may add this to our walls in some way as well to add to the different decor of the office.
I thot u were gonna make a lamp shade
Ok love this idea , but…if you use zip ties to secure the mat to the frame it’s going to ruin the look.
Why didnt you paint the dowls and zip ties. That would have looked much better
Have you ever thought of having an online store selling your creations?  You would have to have your items mass produced.
Love !!! 😀 thanks for your creative genius!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤮🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
These are beautiful!
So so beautiful
Amazing job,i love it😘
Just gorgeous as usual,you come up with great ideas! I'm loving them. TY
Come to decorate my home 😁
it looks really cool ngl
How
Love this! I think it would make a nice room divider too ❤
Oh my goodness.  Would have never had thought to make this . Awesome work as always ❤️
Impressed.
You have an amazing mind.. absolutely awesome ☺️☺️☺️
Girl your mind is unbelievable out of this world creative what's next?
When I did this project the paint would not adhere to the bathmat no matter what I tried. I used different brands of spray paint but no matter what it stayed wet so that even days later (or weeks) if I touched it it would get on my fingers. I truly think you’re an amazing artist with the things you make but I could not make this one work
Love it I'm going to make it and I will try to add a picture canvas in the middle to see how it turns out. Thanks
That table is gorgeous.I like the wall hangings also.
You gave me some great ideas on how to make some things for my bunnies instead of spending all that money on those black grates that are very expensive! Of course, I will have to modify them a bit and keep them safe and pet friendly by making protectors to go along baseboards to keep your house bunny from chewing on them, and two make all sorts of bunny play houses and things to keep them busy! Girl, you have my mind racing! Thanks so much for all your beautiful work and great ideas! You were very very talented! You have some of the most tasteful and classy dollar tree DIY’s I have seen! Keep up the beautiful work! God bless❤
Love watching you create magic , beautiful pieces
Very nice
Very nice
Dollar Tree used to have battery operated led lights. That's another option for your first project. Amazing ideas. You did a great job! Looking over your other videos for some more great ideas.
I love you from Uzbekistan

Can you make a video on how to make a side table with a round glass weight scale?
Love your video.. Can you make this into a headboard for a Queen size bed?
Love it
❤️Aileen
Thank you sweetheart
Love this simple decor. Beautiful & easy!!
Lindo
I Love them all!!!  Very high end looking.
Both of them turned out simply beautiful.
Thanking God for you, I am moving to an apartment which have radiators that are mounted on the walls and I could not come up with a solution for them but this is a fantastic one, I will need a lot but I’m sure this design will work! THANK YOU.
Oh nice project! Thank you for sharing. I was seeing you put together a screen instead of a box. LoL
Yoduvh...you had me fooled with your 2nd project, the box. My idea is wrapping that box, put some lights inside and a big ribbon on top. Guess im too eager to see the Christmas Videos?? LOL
Love it and I intend to try it
HELLO YODUVH I LOVE EVERY PROJECT OF YOURS♥♥♥ I WAS WONDERING IF IT COULD BE MADE AS A TRAY FOR COFFEE TABLE?
😍😍
very cute and I can see that  being made into a wall divider tfs 😁😃😄
You are just amazing. I love this!!! I am on my way to the dollar store right now!! 😂
Great idea❤❤❤
Yoduvh, you always amaze me with your DIYs.  The way you take simple items and turn them into beautiful home decor.  I love the table and the sconces.  TFS, be safe and be blessed. 💙💙💙💙
I love the first idea!!  Definitely going to try that in my dressing room.
Beautiful
You’re a genius! You inspired me to start my channel ❤
Wonder Woman !!!!!! 👍❤❤ awesome
Awesome
IT'S SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE! ❤️ we love all that you do. OG subscriber here and just wanted to say how proud of all that you do. Definitely gave us so many wonderful ideas on upgrading our home. My family watches religiously ❤️
I love watching you create, you're so clever. I was just thinking however, you must have at least a hundred remote controls for your lights?! I would love to see you build a little box to organize your remote controls. How do you know which one is for which light. Obviously you have to put some kind of identification on each one. I thought it would be a simple project that you could glamorize! Great video they all are!
That table idea was my fav.
It’s beautiful I’m gonna try silver
Beautiful diys Yoduvh love them both thanks for sharing as always God bless you as you progress in what you're always doing
Hello, Many Blessings to you Yoduvh 🌹🙏🏽! I love the unique beautiful table and the wall hanging, I really love the wall hanging, because I sincerely believe I can make it with a lot of Prayer and encouragement! You are truly amazing, and such a wonderful pleasure to watch! 👍🏼🤗❤🌹
Quick & easy also Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
The ones on the wall could be earring holder for dangle earrings.
Oookkkuuurrrr the table idea is definitely a game changer💯❤️💯❤️
I love love ❤️ the wall design as the diamond shapes would look great on my staircase wall😂🥰🤩💕❤💕💜💕

Omg!!! You read my mind 😂. I have a shiny bath mat and I was just thinking…( I wonder what I can make with something like that) you are so creative  I love you!!❤
Both projects are awesome, but I love the second one 🤩
You never disappoint. Beautiful. You could also make the whole table then paint it instead of doing it one item at a time.   So cute.
Beautiful ❤️
