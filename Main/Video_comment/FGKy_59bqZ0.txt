Zach is still on the team! He’s working on things off camera, and will be touring for his music soon, that’s why he’s been on camera less ❤️
I hope some day you do you guys vs Mr beast
Trent with the jokes got me so good 5:05. Can i also get a pin?
This wall doesn’t even look 100 layers
I only see one layer
U
The red team actually had the best strategy, since they made the whole so high up they had a huge advantage as when they swung their weapons they weren't bent over at weird angles so they could put more power into each swing.
You are the best YouTuber 🎉 I hope you’re the top.
saying spread the hole is wild
I love u erik
5:11 was not expected
What is the background song called
❤🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤ i
I forgot how Trent is the best person in the channel
4:45 put it in .25x it looks so painful
It really cracks me up every time Dustin compliments their holes 🕳️🕳️🕳️🕳️😂
I de newest comment for now
1:20 Wile E. Coyote ahh scream
Trent is casually hulking around in every video
Trent still has 0.2 seconds! 6:46
Nobody wants eric
What about the Berlin wall...???
Bring and bring Zack back in videos oh Mr. stronger than Trent
Bringing him back break your drywall
where is subomi i missed hid a lot
trent should've just used the concrete block sledge as the weapon
Red team will win
Operation big hole?   You gotta know you that sounds ;-;     Im dirty minded i know😂
Die Mauer muss weg! Die Mauer muss weg!
4:59 I can only imagine what would have happened if it was the Axe instead... good thing Eric was using the Axe and Yasser the hammer cause things would not be good if Yasser was using the Axe...
yo dustin how long does it take for yall to do this stuff and i wanna go against trent. love the vids
❤
You should make a 1000 layers of concrete
I still wanna see a true 100 layer wall not just a slab of concrete or chocolate or candy but a real 100 layer
Justdustin your videos make me happy when I’m sad
Justdustin bro how do you make your videos so so good and can I be in a video with you please I
I feel so bad for them when don't have masks at the beggining and have to inhale all that concrete, this is hazardous 😮
I used to watch you guys but then I stoned and I forgot the name about your YouTube channel but eventually I remembered it and I am so glad I did
Does Dustin know someone in the cement trade?
I'll beat trent in a destructive challenge
Honestly as soon as i saw trent (sorry if it's spelled wrong) i knew his team was gonna win, like bro isn't a straight and breaking competition, of course the buff guy is gonna win
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST JUSTDUSTIN VIDEO😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why do you have a small hole and a big hole? Eric
Who new a channel of people doing   manual labor could be so entertaining.
5:07 Sigma Trent
@JustDustin do a first to brake threw 1000 layers wins your YouTube
your my fav youtuber and i subed
You hit the Wombo combo
AwAwAwAhAhAhOHoHo
Red team will win
Miners should hire these people
Trents voice is getting old 😢
😂
It’s funny how he almost lost a finger
Scilicosis 😣
I wish Zach the best of luck in his journey
Bro y’all got it man keep doing what your doing you guys crack me up Fr genuine laughter thanks 😂🙏🏽
I don’t know how people don’t get injured lol
smash what
poor Eric he is keep on getting hit with a hammer lmao 💀💀💀
I mean idk maybe if the new guy on the blue team new how to swing a hammer we would be in business
Jesus Loves you and died for you and if you accept Him as your Lord and savior you are saved.
Mexico should hire these guys
do  not throw the card
❤<3
How bored are you?  Me: yes
I just love it how Zack breaks all the rules and put holes in the wall all the time
they put masks on... NEVERMIND!!!
And you should put one or 2 rebar inside anything Trent needs to hit. That shhht really ain't fair.
The red teams rather win cuz he said you got to make the circle
Bro sounded like Tom from Tom and Jerry @1:20 lol
People at Home Depot every time Dustin comes in for more tools:Sr we have to ask why are you buying so many tool
I love you fo Eric no-homo
I miss the blame it in Eric days
E
Trent eats babies for breakfast
Add a workout sledgehammer to your weapon collection
Trent keeps breaking everything and now there's a club for it can I join in
Why Eric is not on team red😣😥
I actually think everyone looks buffer since they were introduced in the channel, except Trent, he was already at 100%
I have said it once and i will say it again trents team almost always wins
You know its over when Trent gets a hold of The Sledge
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👆💀💩💩💩💩
Just imagine Zach in this challenge 😅
Next video against trump’s wall 😂
)
Trent is a Best person e
Trent is a beast
This isn’t the biggest wall unspeakable made it.
Thanks!

everything past 9:39 without context sounds... odd
this is the biggest 100 layer wall on YouTube ever ahem  buildings prisons
I love de video
Say goodbye to weapon beauty and helllooo to lung cancer 😂☠️
Just looks like concrete
i fast forward and hear dustin talking about ppls holes
1:21
1:20 i cant... XDDD
Sik vids moreeeeee!!!!!!!!
Hi Dustin I am a little bit shy right now I always watch your videos in transition I don’t know why you must be working out right and I know you use epic photo editor or like something or Premier Pro but I am a huge huge fan sub see you later I subscribed oh and light
Red team sucks
Dustin makes so much effort in this videos
10:23 expected tthat lmai
Like your videos
It pained me to see them use hammers and NOT use the chisel with the upgraded hanmer
the teams are so unfair red team has trent.
Ahaha trent still didn’t push it through at the end 😂
teaming up with trent is almost always a win
At 0:28 Anyone else notice they used wood chisels? not masonry chisels, or just me?
Trent isn't even trying haha
Where were the other 99 layers
Ahahahaahahahaha  bule T. 🔨🔨🔨 uuououhhhhuuhhhhh🥴🥴🥴🥴
Der bule T  uuuuhhhhh🔨
Ahahahaahahahaha  bule T.
Ahahahaahahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂 bule T. Red 😎😎😎😎
we jus gonna ignore how chill and nice eric is every vid
I like the challenge but it's not really fair when one team is like "We have a Hulk."
These guys are the most determined people I've ever seen lol
Is this like an ongoing make a wish foundation thing for the big fella?
Is this like an ongoing make a wish foundation thing for the big fella?
i love your vedyow
Trent is a cheat code 😂
Does she have you breaking clutch
Me wishing I was there
Love ur vids bro
THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP inner goofy comes out
Thank you for everything Dustin and the crew really make my day
WHERE IS ZACK???
Not the Eric
Not the Jeremy
I'm pretty sure hé know but um still saying it. Tou know how he is almost always with hes friends onde videos and he almost never do videos that he do the challenges ? Maybe he is just famous cause your friends are in. I'm not saying that you are not famous but it would be more fun if you where doing the challenges too ya know? maybe your doing this just for them to have fun but maybe it would be better if you where doing the challenges with the ya know?
lol go  around the wall
Help I think I have released but I'm serious
i wanna know the name of the songs that you guys use
Zach is the reason there is a concrete shortage.
Team trent
9:49
He is the one who started it all
I think u should have trent b unlocked as a weapon for the teams
But Jeremy then
U should do a 5 vs 5 with trent as a power up
We should a get video of the new crew vs the old crew
Fun fact my parents were in Berlin within days of borders being opened when the wall was being destroyed by locals you could rent tools from local workers and help destroy the wall my dad had a hammer took all the skin off his knuckles but actually broke off a few chunks with graffiti on it we still have it and is a bit of history in our home he said the wall was so strong metal enforced super strong concrete people with power tools were barely denting it  but I wish I got to see what they did they were also in South Africa the same week apatide was lifted they witnessed two of their generations biggest historical landmarks towards peace and human rights and I have only been to Paris and I’m from the uk it takes 2 hours by train
If you want to read the Gospel, then I will put something like that in my replies, but if you read that then you should still read the complete Gospel. If you read it then like the comment so that more people can see it, and more people have at least one opportunity, because accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior is the most important decision that you will ever make.
Do a one layer of your mom that will be truly unbreakable
10:13 is a vibe
Unspeakable wants you to break mark the unbreakable cube
What about 100 layers of carbon fiber?
Can you watch unspeakables newest video about the cube bye
just use the cement on the sledge for more wieght smh
Facju 😱😱😱😱😱😇
Eric looking fit
Im a little sad that Jeremy didn't say not the curtain when the chisel flew out
Who are the 2 new guys?
That tom&jerry edit tho 😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
Do 100 layers of diamond
Where is old jeremy
you should make a duck tape wall out of every duck tape you used on a wall
I'm still confused about what 100 layers really mean to these guys...
the non pointy side of a pickaxe is used to dig big bits and the point is used for gems and sh**
The stuff in this videos can be taken so out of context
Trent’s mask= less power
I get some of these videos but where did a properly made full concrete wall inside his place come from
Give the other people a jack hammer theyll do good give trent a sledge hammer he destroys everything
Is Trent a strongman or something? Sorry I'm behind the times, just found this channel from HackSmith.
Spread that hole
Did Donald trump help make that wall 🤣🤣🤣
Dustin question what happened to Zach i miss him
just thinking, if you turn the baseball bat around this little nob on the grip will concentrate the force on the target
why do i feel like everybody bully's dustin
15 second unskippable ads
I love your stuff Dustin but what gets me is there was one YouTuber who made a pretty big 100 layer wall. Unspeakable did a 100 layers of cardboard and it was pretty big
is anyone going to talk about what happened to zack i miss him
OSHA approved
if you just delete the sound and keep them talking in and a black screen there just so sus sometimes lol
What’s Zach name in music
Me who plays sports in elementary svhool: hey trent
I want to die someone kill me
4:58😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
layers compared to what pieces of paper?
Is Zac gone 😥😓
You should let the concrete set for 28 days! It takes 28 days to fully cure and will be way harder!
wheres zach at
When will you guys do a weapon building contest
where is zach i miss zach bro
Bro operation big hole and the smash strat hilarious
4:58 Eric better be glad that was the hammer and not the axe XD
The amount of that what she said possibilities is there
9:26😂😂😂
Rip eric fingers
10:15 anybody knows that songs name?
Do an actual 100 layers
Trent dominates the whole game
Poor Eric
I am the 736 comment and seen the first comment
Also i think you should invite subscribers to try and beat Trent and if they win they get up to 200$
Also i think you should invite subscribers to try and beat Trent and if they win they get up to 200$
Weapon breaking club:  red team and blue team and zach

Great work with editing Jeremy
I'd like to see trent against a stone hewner
I love your concrete videos keep up the good work
What is the thing on your wrist called
What happend to zach though?
Good video but what a bunker on 100k on hide&seek but we appreciate all what you do for us
That’s sick
I like how Trent talks more
You guys should do best video game weapon. I want to see a borderlands buzz axe
My name is also Trent
Who else misses his 100 layer duck tape videos
Do you not notice that all your old videos were getting millions of views now your in the thousands. Go back to the old vids
Idk about the news people man
i feel like the sledge and small hatchet did a overall better job compared to the other tools
Love your video pls make some more soon😊😊😊
I dont like jermany
Where is zach?
I have been around sense 100 layers of aluminum foil wall and I have loved the hard work ever sense🙂
1:21 Tom and Jerry reference?
Hire me I'm good at destroying
I'm so glad to see you guys grow I watched you when the iphone 7 was out then I remember Trent joining you guy and know more people here it is  just exciting to see this channel grow. Also one day bring back the football tackle.🏈
Bro 100 layers of what? It's just concrete.
Trent go for the low space
i find it funny that this channel was named JustDustin, and here we are, mans got a crew. keep it up, videos are pretty cool
Froge
Good luck to the new guys and good luck Zachary with his tour
Thank you Jesus It  felt like he left
That’s what she said
I love your videos and all, but for the love of god wear masks sooner when breaking concrete. The silica crystals that are coming off can and will cause permanent damage to your lungs.....
That’s what she said
You should make more  unbreakable wall videos
Do you do maintenance in n your weapons if not eventually these videos will actually be impossible from how dull and used the weapon is
Trint brake ductin
They could’ve just went around the wall
ABSOLUTEly love the new editing style its so funny
Hi
This is the first youtiber that I watch with no Sus, Ayo's, pauses.
If I was a horse, I would cook Kermit T.Frog with Gordon Ramsey whilst watching JustDustin videos. In short, I like you content.
difficult
We love you to man
We love you to man
"We take a small hole and we rip it and make it bigger" -Eric😉
where is zack
Its funny when hiš trowing stufs
Why
Yo Dustin what happened to “Not the wall”!
I love red
Hi
Sledge from r6 would’ve won this in 19 seconds 👀
Tbh is it really 100 layers
man i used to and still do love those 100 layers videos they were great but keep up the great work guys
do you guys ignore certain strategies for the sake of the video? there are so many times in videos I feel you could have done a task so much faster by doing something a certain way, but it never even comes up?
unspeakable actualy did 100 layers
u look like airrack
Justduatin how did you lose at hide and sewk
Trent just needs to be a weapon he makes the game so unfair
100 layer line x wall ??
What happened to Zack
Bring Zach back
Soooaooahweeeeeeeee
Dustin be acting like a dungeon master in dnd Making up all these rules on the fly
We NEED a guest as strong as Trent so it's TRENT VERSUS A STRONGER GUY
Dustin just your Ma biggest fan
This is the biggest 100 layer wall on YouTube. Some dude: today we are gonna break through 100 layers of buildings
can someone tell me why Eric loki kinda look like dusty from stranger things lol🤔🤔😂😂
Do you wanna Isaiah photos team
i wonder why nobody noticed that, this concrete wall isn’t 100 layers, it’s 1 layer
Can I be in that club
Who are these new bozos
I think if I were there, I could've gave Trent a run for His money 💪.... I'm at least as strong as Zach, maybe Eric
Isn't the studio just a free gym membership?
Pls bring back the unbreakable wall series
should donate to ryan trahans feeding america charity
Break through the wall of your biulding as a challenge, or find an abandoned biulding and first team to knock it down (maybe two seperate biiuldingd next to eachother).
I am sorry that you didn’t win 100k
Cool, like MrBeast
Were is Zak
I'd say Eric is the second strongest out all you guys
Kinda want to see the best built shield challange or even a best weapon shooting build 🤔🤔
I would love to do this bc I'm a 14 year old that loves to break stuff
atp we need fan sumbmissions for new walls, have you thought about a wall made of pennies?
1:21 Eric
get it trent
the wombo combo
😂🤣😂🤣
How many time’s have the help there finger wit the hammer
Trent should be a construction worker
Team alboe vs the crew
9:40 child birth in a nutshell
Where is jeremy
“The power of what?” “The power of OwooOhHooOOoOOoOuuUh”
Who’s Trent’s partner?
Eric really pulling off Billy’s cut in stranger things
I just realized Eric looks like Dustin from stranger things but as an adult
Do 100 Layer of books
Oh god there a lot of sus things there saying
What happened to Zach
Fingers are not safe in this vid XD
You should do a 100 layer wall of polycarbonate
what would specify as a layer maybe `0.1 of a mm
1:07 justdustion jumpscare
They should just take the wall and PUSH it somewhere else  Edit: that joke sucks
Can we all appreciate how much Dustin puts into these videos probably hundreds of thousands of dollars. So thank you Dustin for putting in the extra work to make an amazing and entertaining  vid keep up the good work Dustin  and who's the new guys ??
What happened to Zack
LETS GO DUSTIN RETURNS WITH ANOTHER 100 LAYER WALL.
this is torture
The amount of times the word “hole” was used had me dead LOL. and I could watch Trent dance and get down in the club any time xD
I was worried about zach
Isaiah chooses paper, your move rock
These are so good to see, maybe do a similar one like the mine the diamond one but if they get more they could receive their specialty weapon, eg Trent is the Super Sledge and Zach’s the Reaper (if that is still there. Like a level 5 before the Jack hammer or Chainsaw.
4:03 thats what she said
Can you not have trent do one of these so it isnt entirely one sided?
Plzz make the og 100layer of something
Love these videos. Always looks like they are having fun Trent is the kinda person I think is awesome because no matter who he is against he is just going at his pace doesn't hold back, but also doesn't push to hard.
4:57 had me dead
Let’s go Trent and other guy
I miss Zach he is the best😁😁😁
Dustin you can make your own game about breaking stuff.
It’s been so long since you didn’t one of these
There's so many "that's what she said" jokes to be made in this video-
I like how Trent isn’t really trying to make it a close competition. Lol
bro even when trent has a team it feels more like trent vs everybody
I like red a hell of a lot more than blue
Eric went from the world's strongest baby to the world's strongest toddler, he's growing up and those arms are the measuring stick!
Bro Trent is a cheat code for your little games😂
Make a 1 hour long video destroying things with task they have to complete to unlock weapons
Why can't there be a Trent vs Trent competition video 🤔
I wanna see Trent vs bradly Martin boxing match
I miss getting a heart
Is it just me or do I wanna see a team with Trent and Dustin on it it seems like a stream team.
Io
I loved the hide and seek with Preston and loved this video kept making new videos and inspiring new people ❤❤
Are you Cristiano ronaldo
Hi
Hello bro
i know how to fix your walls you cut out the damage and cut out the same part of dry wall and take the dameged dry wall and put the other dry wall in( i am only 10 and i know this.
Where is zach 😂😂😂😮😢
Blue team win
That wall is not 100 layers it's on you one layer b****
They should do a 100 layer wall of flex glue and line-x  vs .50 cal
🙂🙃🙂🙃😈😈😈
18 hour gang
Aren’t you bored of doing the same thing over and over again? Switch it up a bit bro!
Safety mask guys and gloves. Just to avoid anything nasty from happening
Nice move trends
Come on. If you're gonna tell Trent to ease up to make it closer, don't make it so obvious
Fill the broken bat with cement
Who’s the other guy on Trent’s tram
You lost in Preston 100 youtuber hide and seek
combine all your 100 layer videos into one
Love from dubai and I am from Pakistan
Fuckin liar. 100 layers of cardboard was bigger
bro the mexicans already did this that's why trumps wall doesn't exist
trump would be proud
what happened to zach
For you next wepon video you should do for honor theme
For a channel all about breaking stuff, it sure has built up over the years. Keep being awesome.
where is sac touring and is there a link to his music?
I miss old just Dustin, actual 100 layer walls, Jim Zach and Wolfie, seemed less like acting and seemed like he was having more fun, back in the gym was the just Dustin glory days.
justdustin you were in prestons video you were one of the last one finded
The camera man almost died
Trent dancen is the best jajajajaja
Trent should be a fps character with a rage ult that makes him invincible and deals lotsa damage
Go back to you old vids we loved them ❤️ n also continue the great n amazing work love the vid tho hehe❤️
This video has so much meme potential 💀
Team Trent. Trent smash. Trent is the final boss. More Trent dance breaks.
Trent we know your an armor titan this is easy for you
Yo.. hol up, we need more Trent dance breaks...
ok
Cooooooooooooooollllllll
true fans remember that dustin used to make his walls in a gym
So how is it a 100 layer wall if there arnt any layers it's just a wall
any challenges against trent is just unfair lol
Yeah spread that hole 🤣🤣🤣
dude whenever someone walkes near the warehouse they think there is construstion going one lol
Y’all should do one layer of every wall y’all have done
Bro Trent has to be snorting pre workout to get them pumps in 🤣 love watching y'all frfr
i’m earlyyyy
Bring back the 100 layers of challenge like he did in the old warehouse
go trent
This is not fair obv Trent’s team is gonna win
I miss the old Dustin when it was only him and his camera man
When he got hit by the hammer, he sounded like Tom from Tom and jerry (the first time he was hit)
Only team albo member making YouTube videos still
This video was chaos 😂
But the fact that Eric, technically, beat Trent in a challenge… very promising young ones
May I introduce a bigger wall it is called the earth
Where's Zach man
I miss Zach
The middle part of video - challenge to get first "paid" upgrade by breaking box was really boring... Just saying not sure why that part was edited to be so slow and boring. Love you always tho
Should have made a song from the sounds of tools hitting the wall!
.... wait couldn't Trent just break the other guy's cart and win...
1:20 sounds like Tom, from Tom and Jerry
Bring back the war club with the spike on the end
Trent in himself is overpowered
So when you destroying 100 water melons and staying the night in one you promised you would if you got 100k likes on a vid and we doubled that so no lying do it
Am I the only person dirty minded at 9:55
Comment 420 for the win  Challenge idea 100layers of 100 layer walls
I like the new editor
they're hitting eachother and its making me laugh justin you need to make a funny 🤣moments of justdustin videos
Only the ogs remember when they did this all the time
What happened to Trent’s mask
Shout-out to the new guys!
you cud take the tools and brake the wall with the back
where did the new guys come from and the crew did i miss a video
wheres zack
Anyone remember when this man's was filming in a random gym breaking through duct tape by himself 😂
Of course Red Team won, they have Trent.
The new red guy is fun great work
Man. I remember back in the day when it was tape and raping paper. Oh how far we have come.
W video bro love your content!
You should try to make a 100 layer wall with a few layers of every wall you ever made
Trent is by far the best character he’s stupidly strong and he’s hilarious, I inspire to be just like Trent
Eric got smashed 2 times lmao.this was a epic wall.
Do a thousand layers of drywall
See if you can get Robert Oberst to face of with Trent
next time can you film the clean up for this, i wonder what it looks like.
I like about breaking wall and stuff especially your vehicles armored video
none of these mfs know how to use an axe or pickaxe properly. better form=more form and less strain
James is rated rookie
Dustin you the best you spend so much money and time in all you vids your my 2nd fav youtuber.
They like to break walls só Thats good
How do I get invited to break stuff? I could be Eric's power up ;)  Demolition experience, check Construction experience, check Big d**k energy, check
Subscribe tome
Trent is such a beast! Love that guy!
I would like to see 3 v Trent in these competitions.
Gearing up for new new generation of Just Dustin?
You just lost 100,000 dollars in preston challenge.
fyi : concrete dust is really bad to beathe in and you have the wrong masks to use as protection from it ... :(
They need to nerf Trent lol
you should do a hundred layer themed star wars
Welcome back zach!
1:21
Ello
Bro how do u make bangers every single video 🤠 Best youtuber ever
Where has Zach been?
When people ask me why so think sledge hammers are made, my mind just thinks TRENT
Who are the two randos?
A  Escape from a prison made out of 100 layer gel
at 1:19 Eric's scream sounds like Toms scream from Tom and Jerry. but still, loving the content you put out Dustin, keep up the amazing work.
Bro has his own concrete factory in his warehouse
Yes, 100 layers...
I have an idea for 100 layer wall. 100 layer wall of peanuts🥜
Blue team needs me lol I could have slugged that wall open like Trent XD
I love how Trent just man handles literally everything
come on bro wee need your content everyday
If Zach returns, I’ll eat my shoe.
You should bring Noel Deyzel oor someone big like him in one of your videos to compete with trent
I'm just shocked nobody broke a finger or their entire hand.
Thanks for letting us know justdustin
Thanks for letting us know justdustin
Can we all appreciate these numbskulls couldnt break a piece of plywood yet alone hone some form of problem solving or critical thinking related to anything outside their phone feeds. Unreal.
What happens to zack
That's a heck of a cold joint in the wall though 😳
anyone remember when dustin did the walls by himself and what happened to the very first person to be on his channel
Special mooove  ... hits with baseball bat.. trent is the best xD
He forgot to put music in most of it (did he mean to?) So it was just Trent hitting a rock🤣😐
3:47 pablo escobar
The sheer amount of innuendos in this video may be stronger than Trent......
Yes 100 layer when it's just a concrete wall
The song. The name of the rap song
Who the new guy?
10,000 layers of flex tape please😭
Trent is the best I never gets old seeing him win.
I miss Zach and throwing things
7:33 Congratulations your Eric has evolved from “Worlds strongest baby” to “Worlds strongest toddler”
where RORY?
9:54 thats what she sayd
You should get another body builder to go against trent
Who would have thought Trent's team won, I could have never seen something like that happening.
This just makes me want to see them play D&D together.
Luv you Dustin 👍
you did good in the hide and seek game that Preston did
I like the new guy on blue keep him
<3
Next video, first team to get through the Great Wall of China wins!
Why is the only OG weapon that hasnt been broken is the pick axe😂😂
balls 👌
Hu
Y'all need to do a Trent-less challenge to where it's an even playing field but.... Trent can be a power up.
Just a simple classic video, had a lot of fun watching SMASHING:)
Plz don't say souwee again that's gang slang for bloods where I'm from someone might take it offensive love the videos tho 😍
You should make a 100 layer of weapons
it isn't the same when Zach isn't here there's no wall breaking or curten
Nevermind, I don't know what to say, this is my other channel because the other one has my real name but I use to remember you at 2m subs and love you doing these unbreakable wall videos and most of it, the pain train. I miss what you use to do on your old videos, but I don't care, I still love you and your videos.
Where is your other friend I want to know where he is the black dude
At 5:00 it sounded like it was Goku screaming
Next time place some rebar into the wall
the two teams strats: red team: smash blue team: operation big hole
who are guys working with Eric and Trent?
What happened to Zack
Hey Dustin, you should find someone just as strong as Trent as a guest. Then Trent vs that guest and see if he has the strength to beat them lol
4:36 the timer is at .2
It’s not the largest but it is the strongest
We need more Zach! Put him off off camera and put him on camera!
How do you lot survive
This is the Sussest video Ive ever seen
Omg
I was playing Minecraft while the your video was playing and I think I have got more than 400 cobblestone.
This video sus 💀
5:32 this is why we need masks for the dust not going to shop with it on your face
Can we all just agree that jeremy’s mullet is sweet
Largest and biggest wall for the biggest and largest destruction youtuber.....LETS GOOOO!! SSSOOOUUUWWWEEE!!
SOOOOOWEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Fun fact, it doesnt matter how big a wall is, it matters on hiw big you make the hole
Wait did you actually fire the crew and get a new one after the eric incident btw love the videos hope you do well and sorry if your a baseball fan because toronto is going down today   to the tigers
Epic vid.
I guess Eric ain't just moral support anymore.
If you want to read the Gospel, then I will put something like that in my replies, but if you read that then you should still read the complete Gospel. If you read it then like the comment so that more people can see it, and more people have at least one opportunity, because accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior is the most important decision that you will ever make.
WHO TF IS THOSE B!TCHES
Lowkey Trent got movesss
wait didnt you guys do a video on Prestons channel
Can we all just take a moment to support and appreciate what this guy is making and how much money he's spending to make his community happy
I miss Zack bro…
I like how usually Eric is the moral support but now Eric has his own Moral Support

Hi!!!!!!!!!!!!
I dont like the new guys just not fun
Here before the first hour!
You lost in the hide and seek
There both trash
Where is Zach
Where is zack
I hope we get some action from Zack sooner remember he is apart of the Kraken that squad is unbreakable
Dang it bro you almost won the $100,000 Dollars
who are they ...
this is the most sus vidoe i've ever seen (opperation big hole/ make hole wider) lol
10/10
Love your vids Dustin I’ve watched you since you were in you old warehouse❤️
Can some one pls tell me who is jermey im new
You know what you have never done use the other side of the acts like the sledgehammer side
Treat pretty much auto wins these things unless he has a handicap or is holding back. As soon as he gets a good force multiplication device that works his much higher strength is multiplied to a much greater degree making him the winner.
Where were the other 99 layers?
If Trent goes to prison or jail he is gonna need a special cell
bro your old team was best i dont like two new guys but my openio doesn't matter 🤗
Love the vids bud
i really like the new guys, for the first time on the channel.
DUSTIN IS YOU EVER DECIDE TO READ THIS, You should add those sirens 🚨 during the challenges so it look more intense🚨🤯🤯
Invite V2 Vids because he has something you might like
Ayeee wassupbruh
AYYY I love your destructive videos 🙈
Let's hope you guys can pull through bill C-11 if it ever gets passed
This video just shows how strong the first crew really are compared to the new crew
I’m glad Zach is still here and love it dustin
3:14 the curtain!!😳
Wait, i see new faces, is it the Crew that we heard so much about that we never see what's under the mask
Hey
Trent makes big hole Eric make wide holl
Dustin, you should wear purple to signify that you are on both teams because red+blue=purple
Where zack
Where is Zachary?
First
I haven’t watched one of you videos in so long great to be back
So you guys break things and build things huh... What a hectic life y'all havin~  Sup!~ I'm Zero!~
Make a giant pirate ship and who can get to the treasure chest gets the $100,000 inside
Is there a reason that guy has earrings?
If you think about it.. The entire earth is a wall..
I would love to compete with Trent on my team it would be fun
These arent even 100 layers anymore
JustDustin I challenge you to break through a 100 layers Wall made entirely out of titanium i’ll give you till the end of the year of the year 2023 if you don’t break through titanium wall then you are called sus for life!
New two guy’s?
Video idea - you make a 100 layer wall but each layer is a different thing
I'm now on point. He makes up rules every video, in the middle of the video. And probably off camera too. What if. Confused 🤔
Trent’s officially got Legendary!
are you relatet to jesse james west?
they should've had a serious safety percautions because the way of sending the weapons by throwing from the back but not looking what in front of them is very dangerous  1:49 the bat could've hit them in the head 3:24 the sharp end of the axe nearly hit trent's hand and ripping it apart
shawty like a melody
we need another Trent its not fair.
Wow
My favorite kind of JustDustin videos are The Wall videos so this made me have a better day
First
i like how these wideos are geting more and more dangerous
When JustDustin makes an idea for the video be like: The rules before: [Insert empty book] The rules after: [Insert the entire wikipedia in book form]
Best of the best YouTuber's
This like is for Eric, who loves the audience.
Banger love the content I just miss the 100 layers with just you Dustin but keep it up man
Another banger from my favorite guys keep up the good work.may the sun shine down on you 🌞😊
First
young snowie i love your vids i still remember you and wolfie
gg
This video is bussin bussin sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
I also just realized that nothing ever actually is sized to trent
Zach is still on the team! He’s working on things off camera, and will be touring for his music soon, that’s why he’s been on camera less ❤️
Sucks for people who are broke cause nobody that broke gets to be in a video of anybody
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
what if they can glitch the cart into the wall?  Or try to do like in Fringe phasing through the wall  by vibrating the molecules of the wall?
