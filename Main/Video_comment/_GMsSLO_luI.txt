I’ve seen a few of the stories about John but to actually see him talking in interviews is so surreal.
Low quality titanium from china. Russians stoppped delivering the usual high quality titanium to usa.
He did not kill himself.  He was killed or forced to shoot himself probably by some hitman hired by opposers. The same thing happened to Brandy Vaughan who "whistleblew" or opposed "Big Pharma."  She was threated subtly, and whoever killed her could get past her alarm code, into her home.  She had it rigged "kinda like Fort Knox."  Someone Very skilled, someone who could get the so-called secret pass code, who knew how to make it looked she suddenly up and died.  Her 10 yr old son was left to grandparents.  She told everyone "Should something happen to me, it was Not I."  The same for this gentleman above.  They need to investigate and hold someone accountable.
They want it known
John Barnett
And now second death today…🤔
Hahaha corporate doing their job
Boeing and the fbi are the hell hounds for the very rich and powerful people
how are we NOT concerned that this is happening in US?! I'm from Russia...and this is a typical Russian move. HOW is this HAPPENING IN US?!!!
they killed him and im sure 100% the CIA is involved in killing him otherwise the government would had investigated it
CIA?
Easy!
Whistleblowers shot dead. Political opponents tried, arrested and probably jailed. Censorious and propagandist media supporting those in power.   No not Russia No not China. No not Saudi Arabia. But US of A
If they’re OK with killing him, what makes you think they’re not OK with killing us. They do not care at all.
Is it safe to say that the FBI won't research this either, because they are also part of some corruption? (I assume you guys living in the US know more than me).
I knew John and worked with him in South Carolina. He was a good guy and knew the requirements if he said there was an issue then there was an issue. I saw many management edicts that negated compliance verifications. I trained 135 quality technicians to perform process assessments but then they were later off or reassigned in 2017 the same year John reported nonconformities.
This man has balls to tell the story about boeing. Thank you John Barnett telling us the real story about. I guarantee for me  never fly on your peace of crap called boeing There is only one leader in this  industry . AIRBUS
Dont flying on Boeing!!
I mean come on, Boeing must be rollin with the Clintons
Damn he shot himself 7 times in the back of the head we need more suicide awareness
This stinks of foul play now the CEO is resigning from Boeing 🤔🤔
Investigation into Boeing? But not in the death of a former employee? What has happened to us as a country?
13 days further ...any out come jet? abouth this case...tracks...? dna ?
Profits and greed shame on you Boing
For such a high profile case they did an investigation like it was the president! FBI forensic investigation
The cops already said it was a self inficted before the investigation was over, I thought that determination comes at the end of investigation
Thank Trump again for deregulating another transportation system and causing kaos and death
“Apparent” is the key word.   it’s like they’re literary rubbing it in our noses and the know they can
Very disturbing!  I sincerely hope this is being investigated.  Why would he kill himself after reporting his concerns for public safety?  This smells fishy!  I send my condolences to his family and friends.  He had my respect for his bravery.
*WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON WITH ALL THE PLANE ACCIDENTS*? This is a video that explains why there are SO many accidents!!!  The answer is in the first half of this video…  https://youtu.be/9QbI5RPbHWo?si=avJg6IRkcJL17FA7
This will all be shown in the movie. I will never believe that John Barnett killed himself.
Boeing can literally certify there own plane  so they can make the worst and certify
HE WAS FOUND MURDERERD BY THE CEO OF BOEING
This government is evil
Thank God for people like Barnett who are not afraid to speak the truth even if it cost him his life. He cared more about doing what was right in the face of greed. I will remember for that. And being bold and fearless!! 🙏🏾
Wonder how much they paid the Hitman.
Only God can have mercy on the souls of the people who killed him, because nobody is believing that he did it himself
This some Jason Bourne, Enemy of the state shit
THEY think that they are so FLY and don't gaF.
They could have tormented him here longer so idk what's worse
Not not not suicide.  I seriously doubt his safety violations or his murder will be investigated.  Shame on Boehing AND our useless legal system!
He also told a long time family friend if theres ever a story that I committed suicide, do not believe it
Door blew off wheel fell off sudden nose dive yea he had enough
Yeah like almost every company in the world. Everyone focuses on health and safety until you actually work, then you gotta get shit done in time.
boeing is a major NGO of the deep state...they are involved in many many black programmes and of cause they have access to all the professional assassins that the 3 letter agencys have.
I don’t think I’ll ever fly on a Boeing made plane again? Are there any other planes besides?
Same hitter that got Epstien.
People sure do suicide often in America... When big names and money are involved.
hilarious how they make fun of anything not built in america yet this is what their production quality is like lmao
Okay let's be real, Boeing didn't send someone to "whack" this guy. This day in age that would be so obvious. My guess is he was being hounded by random psychos stalking him saying if he went to court it would be bad news for his family or something like that. Regardless this is very sad. RIP.
“Stop blaming the Jews!!! It’s anti-Semitic!!!”
Make sure you tell them it was “apparent” very “obvious” “self-inflicted”   It’s fucked up. When the music stop playing, that’s when people start asking questions.
Like soviet russia. In usa those sre just apparent suicides..
Fuck Boeing. They are terrorists
Was he killed in Mount Pleasant?
Thats easy. A detective with a kindrgarden degree could figure that one out. A sneaky trump supported probably did it.
I did not know Boeing was owned by the Federal Government.
Epstine be like you too?😂
Boeing hired Chicago Mafia and setup a suicide for him .
found dead = killed
"787 max 9" oh c'mon basic fact checking
Boeing most likely paid google, youtube, Facebook to delete the John Barnett interview video from every online platform, because i cant find it at all. Anyone else try and search that interview video  ????
Guy got whacked mafia style...  to send a message
Amazingly he popped himself twice in the back of his head. Experts speculate he popped himself after he died to make sure he remained so
He was killed. And this is yet another company giving into equity hiring practices. Hiring people that are mentally ill rather than qualified candidates.
They killed this man
If you are working in a job that is requiring you to lie to keep it, and that is putting people's lives in danger, you need to really ask yourself some questions.  I'm retired now, but I refused to lie and falsify reports when pressured to.  I left with my soul intact.  Will you be able to say that?  Believe me.  A paycheck is not worth losing your soul over!
Boeings problem's started with the introduction of the "Six Sigma" engineering and manufacturing program starting in the mid 1995+ era. Designed to cut manufacturing cost and improve company $$ profits. This was started by Jack Welch, CEO of General Electric and the CEO of Boring is a former GE executive. GE also in the same situation!!!
He didn't unalive himself. He was either taken out or the government put him in the Witness Protection Program. I haven't seen any footage from the hotel parking lot and usually the news covers it. The hotel should have video footage of the parking lot and we haven't heard anything about that or potential witnesses. It doesn't add up. He saved lives by speaking up and taking action and for that I will forever be thankful.
Silkwood. Now, Barnett. THAT'S going to be a real good movie! Say what you? R.I.P. Mr. B.🎉
🤷🏾‍♂️They whacked him and there was nothing we could do about it. Boeings were Made guys and he wasn’t.
Boeing's WOKE Culture is a Cancer & it shows & now Murders.
RIP John. Boeing is guilty. Many don’t believe that it was suicide.
Money protects Money! This dude and epstein and the obama chef dude all met the same fait. Boeing is such a great nice company 😂 IM joking Boeing we know dude had mental problems 🤷‍♂️
They’re not even trying to hide it anymore.
Russian's way of dealing  with cover-ups. Sad he lost his life this way
Where was he found dead and where was the bullet? Did he commit suicide and then put himself in the trunk?
2:01 ahhhh, the 787 MAX 9
This is not suspicious AT ALL!
It’s sad when people go like this. I had an Uncle that worked at the CIA for a long time and he wanted to tell us a bunch of stuff about “what they don’t want us to hear”. The next day he killed himself with 76 stabs in the chest, head, and balls. Everyone has their demons I guess, miss you uncle Ernie ❤
I mean yall elected the people who did this…you pay their salaries with your taxes…you let them control you with their police force…in the the end there’s more of you but that won’t change much lol
Most disturbing part of this is we are all going to let this happen in front of us even though it’s the most obvious murder ever and we will all continue to fly in Boeing planes and invest in their company with our retirement money.
Short that Boeing Stock!!!
When it comes to stories like this you could hire the worse hit man, it be a messy site and still the investigation will lead to a suicide......right....
The only thing missing in this set up is the crack sprinkled on him! Even if this wasn’t a hit, Boeing caused this man so much despair he felt no other way out. Either way Boeing has MORE blood on their hands.
Rest in peace
“We wish him well”- Tim Dillon, and representatives of Boeing.
Sad situation. Poor guy was murdered.
Our world is so disgustingly corrupt.
Hope they find who ever did it 😢
Rip John
This is called a murder and a cover up. wtf is wrong with cops these days? Their job is to protect the innocent not the murderers
He stabbed himself in the back 9 times and threw himself off a bridge.
They were supposed to protect him.
That's crazy!
Of course, it was from a self-inflicted gunshot wound! 🤷‍♂️
But Putin bad!
silent or silenced?
Demons in people were mad and had to kill the person who exposed their plans!   The man who openly discussed reasons why Boeing was NOT SAFE, killed himself? No. Liars!!!   Satan is known as the Father of Lies and comes to Steal, KILL and destroy. I only hope people realise this before it's too late, but most importantly that they know who governs this world that isn't a myth or imaginary creature.   Satan promised Jesus the world only if he'd BOW to him, which Jesus replied to him with his word, "IT IS WRITTEN." Look at celebrities, those high up in the world. They have something in common, they serve and bow to Satan. There's clear reasons why they mock and "joke" about these secret societies, being in Babylon (the great, abominable harlot and enemy of the living the God).   Know there's a battle for all on this earth. Don't sell your souls for earthly gains, its a trap! Jesus is the way, the truth and the Life. He is the king of kings and Lord of Lords and you don't want to be on the side that is going to lose aka Satan and his dark, demonic kingdom.   Jesus loved us so much that he died in our place, even as a sinless man who did NO WRONG. The people during his time before his crucifixion trial chose a criminal, a known murderer over him who healed the sick, casted out demons that tormented people mentally, physically, emotionally etc, fed thousands of people, made the blind eyes see, deaf ears hear, lame/sick be able to walk and were healed and made well.   THIS IS A REAL BATTLE WE ARE ALL SPIRITUALLY IN. Repent of your sins, know who Christ really is that Hollywood, the rulers of the world try to diminish, mock and twist his reputation/character around EVEN TO THIS PRESENT TIME!!!   Jesus is coming back... wake up!!!!
RIP
Epstein didn't kill himself
Whistleblowers should receive police protection
It was ruled that he was suicided and it took the poor guy 2 shots one to the front of the head and the other to the back of the head to cancel his subscription to breathing
Boeing... we didn't do it... but we paid who did 😂
Definitely murder  But now everyone knows their corruption and this story will blow up worldwide. I never knew anything about this whistle-blower until now. Now the world knows and his murder will  be talked about. This will majorly backfire on them and I hope the company loses big business through it. The dirty bunch of con merchants.
He was assassinated by Boeing, they hired the Creaky Information Allegations company to help 'fix' his car
Come saranno le indagini: approfondite o frettolose e superficiali?
It was David Calhoun, that might be the suspect of the murder of John Barnett, so David Calhoun is the ceo of Boeing, i looked his name up, he might be one that paid a hit man a hundred thousand dollars to murder John Barnett to keep him quiet to silence him.
I think the ceo of Boeing hired a hit man to murder John Barnett, it was intentional of motivation, so the ceo had to pay some to kill John Barnett that might be a hundred dollars, to keep John Barnett quiet. It was the ceo that paid a hit man that hundred thousand dollars. That ceo of Boeing should investigated for an arrest and interrogated and sent prison.
Instantly thought ARKANZIED.
Keep the lawsuit going
Folks it doesn't have to be a murder it can just be that he couldn't handle a billion dollar company coming after him. Focus on real conspiracies not fake ones.
I bet you they destroy the forensics evidence before people demand an investigation of murder.
Climate change?
Nothing to see here guys just another Epstein situation 🧑‍🦯🧑‍🦯🧑‍🦯
Safety is no longer a huge concern anymore for engineering industries today since Demand = money which is more important to them. What a shame…
The bolts are $3.19 each. The next thing you're going  to want us to keep the engines on the planes.
I want to PERSONALLY thank Boeing for this. You just made my decision on what type of plane that I will not spend another penny on (Boeing-made). Ever.
America doing what Putin does
His neighbor was Epstein's old cellie.
We need the Netflix documentary of what really happened!
looks like another freemasonic hoax...
Who has the biggest shares of Stock  ?  H..R. C.
This reminds me of a movie I never saw, it was just some trailer I faintly remember, where the government's trying to stop people from gathering because an event is inevitable, where people finding out something that has been kept from them by governments is trying to be prevented.  Heck, I thought that was a scene from that movie... lol
Jesus is everything going the Train industry route. Safety 4th on the most important things list. Prayers going out to this man’s family. 🤦‍♂️
HE DID NOT COMMIT SU*cide. They killed him. Why would he check out when he was about to beat them in court???? Where is Hilary??
CEO Dave Calhoun is the new Godfather . Al Capone, Jimmy Hoffa, John Gotti and Henry Hill would have been proud .☠️😱
He was suicided. I do not believe for one second he did this to himself. Someone got it the back seat, put the gun in the victims hand and forced him to pull the trigger. Cover up! If the janitor heard a gunshot why didn't he run to help. I guess all the camera footage will have techinal issues and no footage will be recovered.
New clintons
man was murdered no doubt.
Shoukd publish his testimony instead of his death
Where is the justice in the Perfect Country United States?
They don’t even try to hide it anymore
Boeing never taking responsibility and now they are murders 🤬 disgusting! This guy deserves justice and all the passengers affected
Apparent my ass
They silenced him
he was assassinated
I'm not buying that John Barnett commited suicide. The fact he was testifying against Boeing on the day he died? Anybody else buy that?
Wow. God rest his soul.
The USA is a first world country. 😂 Yea right
Where are we living russia?  Hold boeing accountable for his murder.
Boeing's statement should have read ""We are relieved he's dead, our troubles are now over"
THIS WAS NOT A COINCIDENCE.
This is SO sad.  "For the love of money, is the root of all kinds of evil"
Where was killary?
Don't like my comment.
I worked at Boeing. I remember the technicians would leave tools and spare parts in between panels of the fuselage. It was always a rush job.
The gov is in on it
Self inflicted gun shot wound... I get it, I think! But how does a person commit suicide with multiple gun shot wounds to their head. I don't get that... Sound eerily familiar to witness in the Hilary Clinton issues where the witness was found on a park bench with gun shot wounds to his head and no gun found... hmm
Well, that's quite the quality control plan...
it's not hard to put two and two together on this one... but wow. If it IS true, and someone decided to take matters into their own hands, the balls to do this with so much visibility is insane. Never fly boeing!!!!
RIP to Mr.Barnett, I hope his family stays safe and well over these upcoming months.
It was nice of Hillary Clinton to send her condolences regarding yesterday’s suicide last week!😂
Everyone is invited in observing the Memorial of Jesus’ death on *Sunday, March 24, 2024.* 🍷🥖 Will you show [your] appreciation for everything he did for us?
Hilary?
Is this the fault of DEI too?
There was a man who lived in Hoover. he was a whistleblower against the FBI. He committed suicide by shooting himself in the head not once but twice.
"Self inflicted"  If you are buying the official story take a bow, because you've won the special "retard of the day" award.
He killed himself by two shots in the back of the head.
I'm glad ppl are waking up
It's funny this happened right before the trial? There could be a Boeing hitman who could be involved 🤔
Bullshit
If any person does this kind of negligence, you will see prison time. If company does that, they will expected to find a way to fix their negligence. it's crazy....
just as fishy as the ''double tap'' to the head suicide linked to the clintons
That poor guy got Clintoned by Boieng 😢
Wasn’t suicide, could tell ya that
So.....Boeing is a cartel who murders people who speak up.  Tell me again why I should trust a Boeing aircraft?
Why would he kill himself. What an idiot.
Self inflicted???........riiiiiiiiight..*wink-wink* 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Apparently the government is trying to kill us in every way they can from food to flying .....time to wake up America
Boeing:”that’s right, our security division handled the problem. What are you going to do about it?”  Congress: “Not a godam thing”.
“Found dead” No  “Murdered”  Yes
And still the people of the country can't see that America today is no different than Germany under Hitler. Talk truth, and you mysteriously commit suicide. And for some strange reason the people vote for this. Sad.
Mafia style warning to future whistle blowers.
Boeing should be reformed. This is not American stand and it is shame without correction.
Yeah, was it like a three-bullet suicide ?  Who knows whom in the investigation ?  Who is afraid of whom in the investigation ?  Who has financial or self-preservational interests in this matter ?  Who in the FAA and Boeing had an interest in silencing this man ?  Yeah... I'm pretty sure it was a three-bullet suicide..🙄🙄🙄
This is how they try to shut the working class up. SMD
Stanley Allen Meyer we will.never forget
John Barnett we will.never forget
Pat Tillman we will never forget
It was the same suicide method that Jeffery Epstein took
The Boeing whistle blower reminds me of Karen Silkwood. The labor union activist known for reporting concerns about corporate practices related to health and safety at the Kerr McGee nuclear facility. Also reminds me of Vince Foster, Senator Wellstone, Michael Hastings, Deborah Jeane Palfrey, Gary Webb, Danny Casolaro, House majority leader and Warren Commission member Hale Boggs, Alaska representative Nick Begich, Jeffrey Epstein,  Seth Rich, Dr David Kelly, the Clintons, etc. etc. etc.
Not suicide
2/3 of Boeing shares are held by the big three - Blackrock, Vanguard and State Street - about 100 million shares, valued at $20Trillion.  If the whistleblower caused even 5% drop on that stock value, that’s $1 Trillion loss.  Would you let him live to cause another 5% drop?
I know im gonna catch heat for this and yes i know it sounds really fishy but it is possible he did it himself this man just ruined his career he worked his whole life for he'll never work in aviations again thats enough to drive some people to do sich a thing maybe im wrong but its not impossible
And the cause of death was a “strong movement after a technical event” by a weapon.
Suicide? Bullshit!
There is a war for your mind, example: Self-inflicted Suicide, is a use of language to reinforce an object of blame, manipulation thru language. It is like repeating 'you did it, you did it, you did it' over and over to insure you conclude that you did it. "Self-Inflicted Taking Of One's Own Life" says "it had nothing to do with anyone else, nothing to see here".....just Super His Fault!
Does he have a wife or kids?  If so has anyone seen any interview or social media post from them??
Trust me what he’s say is the truth. I work in the industry and that’s how airline industry works
Just the last gasps of a former competent company. Same tactics as our government and inner city gangs. Maybe they were always doing hits on people, but I have noticed a new casual culture of elites killing enemies publicly in such a way that it’s hard not to see them as losing control.
NOT SUICIDE.  WE ARE SORRY FOR BOEAING FOR BEING EXPOSED SO INTERNATIONALLY.
Let me guess it: The person that murdered him is a "patriot" helping the "interests" of this nation?
Sui***, very beleiveable
Sounds very suspicious, being a whistle-blower and Boeing very much needed to silence him. But those are just my thoughts😮
All of top management needs to be replaced. The company is contaminated with low morale and ethical issues. Boeing needs to reinvent itself.
Another whistleblower . Another suspicious suicide . Epstein
Self inflicted gunshot wound, using a shot gun he shot himself 5 times at the back of his head
Fuck Boeing even more. Never use their aircraft
0 support for Boeing. Boycott Boeing !!
The funny thing is his friends  and colleague  said he was in high spirits and showed no signs of depression...yeah ok boeing
"Self-inflicted gunshot wound" - I guess the Boeing employee was named "Self"?
They tried to do it earlier but they figured falling out of a window after drinking spiked tea onto 6 bullets was trademark infringement against ruzzia.
How can anyone in their right mind think he offed himself? Not in today's world, where Big Corporations have unlimited power to exercise mafia-style endings for unfortunate whistleblowers.
He was killed trying to keep people safe! 😩 I hope KARMA exists, this world is so damn corrupt!!
They better investigate the hell out of this if they want to hold any credibility with the American people.
John Barnett will not find justice, a sad world we live in.
boeing sucks at making planes
Boeing is the ‘sick man’ of the aviation industry, moving with crutches, yet still attempting to enter a marathon. How could that be possible? Murdering whistleblowers won’t immunize them from the competitive health of this business. Decades ago, it was the glory and pride of American industry, but not anymore. Their planes are falling at an alarming rate due to the wear and tear of their engines and parts. Currently, Airbus and a few others are the champions. 🏆
More puts on Boeing
All suicide cases were seen as homicide or murder cases. I hope this incident must be investigated deeply coz hes not an ordinary person. Hes a whistle blower who can destroy a company.
This is like one of those old Candid Camera episodes where the joke is to see how long the unsuspecting rube will continue to believe what they are being told despite all of the seemingly obvious facts that should reveal the deception.
Why are news reports all about suicide, and why is this conclusion released without investigation?
WTF??!!!!!!!!😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
"suicide".
MAGA
😳
Boeing needs to immediately reject this whole DEI, woke nonsense, and revamp their entire employee base by replacing all of the less-skilled DEI hires with the most qualified people they can find... like in olden days.
He was killed by Boeing henchmen. Did anyone see the movie Michael Clayton? Same thing here.
Now, not only does Boeing Kill passengers, they kill witnesses also.
....
Ruthless 😢
Boeing makes billions. No way this was suicide.
Don’t believe the suicide note.
I wonder if he ever met the clintons
"found dead" *wink wink *nudge nudge
It’s all down to the McDonell/Douglas management that took over after the merger.  If any of those bastards are still alive, they need to be prosecuted.
RIP John Barnett for thanks for speaking out and God bless you.to me it seems like you're a good person.
😮
He was in the middle of depositions against Boeing.  Most people know this was a Boeing and/or government directed murder but the boldness of this to be done in the middle of his depositions is disheartening.
He messed with the wrong people when he messed with Boeing
everyone: CONSPIRACY!! me: why would they kill him, he already blew the whistle, testified and moved on? everyone: There Are NO Coincidences!! me: this isnt the mafia or cia, its a company that in no way could afford more negative pr right now. you know, like a murder? evereyone: CONSPIRACY!! me: 🙄
They're talking more about Boeing than the circumstances of this man's passing. I have a feeling it won't be Investigated thoroughly and will be swept under the rug.
Boeing probably killed this guy.
Corporate power is authoritarian.
This was hurting the illuminati profits. So they went to work.
Epsteined……🤔
Free Julian Assange!!!
"Lockheed", please PLEASE get back in the airliner race .....     🙏
I smell mutiny. All  Of a sudden, he shoots himself. Huh while suing Boeing. And what is this with the coroner's office out there They determine Self-inflicted gunshot wound. How do they know were they there, And what about the police department's detectives If they knew he was a whistle blower. I would assume. That they're police department. Should have a conference meeting with the news, reporters. Especially homicide detectives. But here we have no investigation. No, detectives. Their corner's office Ruled self-inflicted gunshot Sure, like people are gonna believe that. I believe in a scripture. And it goes something like this Here.( What comes around goes around Boeing ) You took a man's Soul., And you.  Will claim thousands. It's just a matter of time.
Nothing to see here, folks. Move along…
This is straight out of Michael Clayton.
I don’t see why he would kill himself if he was in the process of exposing Boeing, does not add up. Definitely some foul play here
He was probably found with hands/feet tied, shot multiple times in the back and head but miraculously no gun powder residue on him.  You know typical suicide   There won’t be an investigation, it’ll be swept under the rug, forgotten, and anyone who tries to expose the truth will be called a racist conspiracy theorist.
Ok, so you're telling me that this gentleman fought Boeing for years,  drove to Charlestone, booked a hotel, gave his testimony for 7hrs for 2 days before but when the day 3 came he, instead of driving to the hearing, changed his mind and shot himself? Yeah, makes sense, case closed.
Red flags all over the place.
He was proud of retiring and now we are suppose to believe he took himself out?
What a complete debacle this is.
When it comes to money and shenanigans of the rich, somebody always dies if self inflicted gunshot! Glad I'm not rich it knows anybody that is!
Give me a break do they actually think that anyone is going to believe that this guy actually killed himself. I really and truly hope that there is an outpouring of outrage and courage and that they will hold these terrorists accountable!!!
They said the same about dozens of whistle-blowers, we all know it's a cover up especially with the proceedings were so close. Sadely it won't be investigated.
I thought they only make airplanes
Someone from boeing axed him off...
They’re so desperate
All corporations are corrupted … real raw truth … some are better at hiding it
SADLY MURDER IS RUNNING RAMPANT.
Either way I hope they really go outta business now..wow
It's so strange to see whistleblowers become suicidal like that.
I wouldn't be surprised if they paid them to say it was a self inflicted gun shot, smh they unalived that man
Seth Rich
So, the quality problem is resolved like that?!
Wow. It's absolutely crazy how many people who have the courage to speak up about wrong doing and corruption and major corporations are so SUICIDAL or very ACCIDENT PRONE 🤔  🤫
A MURDER CLEVERLY DISGUISED AS A SUICIDE NO DOUBT!!!!!!!!!!
He was murdered, not suicide
Nothing to see here, move along.
I wouldn’t commit suicide if I had a lawsuit. Kinda fishy
ASSASSINATION
Self inflicted my ass
When someone is in a 'life process' that is very goal oriented they do NOT k*ll themselves. People in the middle of a crusade- don't stop themselves in this manner. Sorry. This stinks to high heaven.
Not the Clintons again...
This country is just as bad as Russia, such a corrupt government on both side sides of the house
It’s scary
Rest in Peace Gary Webb, JFK, and now John Barnett
Was the self-inflicted gunshot in the back of the head?  It is curious how dedicated whistleblowers and political dissidents are to getting that angle when they kill themselves.
It's not nice when Boeing Kills.  When Ford used to blow up and incinerate It's customers it wasn't nice either.  Worse yet, is that it forced GM to invent their Special Killing Ignitions.  Then Johnson & Johnson had to start putting Asbestos into Baby Powder...  Republican Capitalism.
Uhhhhhhhhhh WTF could they have killed him?
Epsteins Ed By Boeing or the fbi?
So he went to a deposition and decided to kill himself before his third day of testimony? Does that sound like a suicidal man to you?
This country has gone to shiet
Maybe hire production staff based on merit instead of woke ideology.
We’ve become Russia now ?
BS
Boeing insiders did it
How sad. 😢
Either Boeing or the Clintons killed him!
Not Fishy....NAH...
I've flown twice in my life, once to the army and once back and that will be that. Never again for me. It just seems so risky to me and that's not how I wana go out
RIP JOHN
Yea RIGHT! Om guessing  momma Boeing hires a assassin that specializes in hits that look like accidents. I'm really surprised Mr.Biden hasn't tried that yet.
John Burnett didn’t kill himself
This man was killed cause he made trouble for them by being a whistle blower.
Boeing, once renowned for its engineering prowess, has shifted its focus predominantly towards maximizing profits. Boeing holds significant presence and influence in Charleston, SC, that is all I am going to say.
We are saddend bybhaving to off him. The corruption with the multi biollion dollar businesses is out of control
WE ALL KNOW BOEING, WE ALL KNOW WHAT YOU DID.
Infuriating! I saw him in an interview, and he said, "Just so everyone knows, I am not suicidal."
Didn't this happen to reporter 40 yrs ago?
Russia: Look who's criticizing me...😂😂😂You know why they say America is a not a nation but a corporation, it's because in other countries there are political assignations but in America there are corporate assignations. They don't spare anyone from politicians to reporters to ordinary people, in US corporate is king 👑
Whacked
Alright Biden, are going to ignore this "suicide" too? Because we know the FBdumb won't do crap!!!!
Another person un-alived by the Democrat party. MLK, Malcolm X, JFK, RFK, Obamas chef, and 47 of the Clinton's family associates are also on that list.
Hey remember a couple weeks ago the media was freaking about that guy in Russia? Free country my azz
He got Epstein'd
Nothing shady going on around here.
Don't need to worry about a lawsuit over your retaliation if the plaintiff is dead 🤔🤔🤔🤔  This is absolutely insane. Boeing planes fucking up literally multiple times a month, and the person who said there were problems half a decade ago (the face of the lawsuit against the very culture that is producing these issues) just so happens to turn up dead a few months before his lawsuit (which he would have won) begins.   The disappearance of the barrier between private company and government is actual fascism.
Boeing murdered him !!!!
They murdered him.
Not boeing to make assumptions
Boeing is so dumb! Seriously, no sane person is going to believe this bs!
You believe this? I don't! Easiest murder to pull off make it look like a suicide 😢
He got epsteined
We're gonna see how big big hush hush Boeing $$ affects  our politicians. One word. Silkwood.
Whistleblower. Suicide. Coincidence. Been happening too often lately. Hmmmm
Boy, that's about the most fake quote I've ever heard in my lifetime 😂.
Who was murdered not by bowling, but by the government the CIA
It’s no longer Boeing! When they sold the company many years ago it became a dangerous business! 😒 Not the highest quality it was to start with, it shifted to $$$$$$!!!!! At the expense of amazing employees and many passengers! Shame on them! 🤨
Yeah I’m not buying it!
This is why people need to just keep their mouth shut.
He was 100% shot by someone else.
Alright, where's Hillary Clinton?
Of course he was found dead like, he really committed suicide, right🤣 he was taken out why, he could damage Boeing greatly in financial wise and business wise it was just like Epstein committing so-called suicide😂 when he had a lot of bargaining chips that he basically could’ve gotten off with a slap on the wrist, he would’ve exposed hundreds of powerful people that’s more than enough reason for him to disappear.
this dude clearly made an 800 mile trip to where he was going to give a deposition for a court case just to kill himself, there is no conspiracy here this is very typical behavior
Murica !!
He was murdered and there's not one damn thing me, you or anyone else can do about it because we've let corporations and government get too rich and too powerful
All these weird deaths are happening during the Biden regime.
Sends a message.
We gotta stop the white on white crimes.. white ppl have to come together & do better.. yikes!
Power corrupts
Just think about it. This guy actually worked with Kenneth Pinyan at Boeing. Yeah. Mr 👋👋's.
Their greed is taking lives away. God see's everything...and you will give an account.👀🙏🏽 ✝️
Lets all boycott boeing
never thought boeing would pull off a hit job. well done dipshits... your now internationally known for assassinating whistle blowers. you have lost all credibility.
Remember Boeing is headquartered in Seattle a Left Wing city if ever there was one.   It is possible that some Leftie Boeing group was not happy with him for being a Whistle blower against Boeing and decided to take him out. Whenever I see a cause of death being a "self inflicted gun shot wound I remember all those friends of Hillary Clinton who just happened to commit suicide also.
Is this become of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ??
This " Apparent " Suicide " follows the Same Pattern as the Numerous " Identical Suicides “ during the Clinton Presidency . And a few during the Obomba Regime ! As I see it “ This was No Suicide “ !
I hope surveillance cameras showing proof of it are released or else how can anyone believe it was a suicide...
A strong message to all potential Boeing whistleblowers...
I can hear the conspiracy theorists printing out all kinds of cheap Chinese junk to sell on their channels.
they wacked him.
They did it & their going to get away with it . Wow , welcome to the Nation that's ALL about Justice.
they settled out of court!!!!!
WTF this world is beyond evil.
Dude got "Epsteined"
Not everything is a conspiracy and people actually do commit suicide.  Murder just seems to obvious. Was there a note?
Boeing said he did it to himself and "We're so sorry." All while privately agreeing and justifying it to themselves that this guy should have kept his mouth shut.  This was not suicide!  This was a hit job.
Just search the ammount of lobbying boeing does to the congress and senators big fish wont be caught if did then its corrupt legislature whos at stake
Not a suicide… A Murder….
Self inflicted with a little help!
If this was a suicide, then I'm sure that the emotional stress caused by this company help push him over the edge
Well, I think that if there’s one thing that Democrat and Republican voters can agree on, this might be a good start…
yeah, we'll see how boeing buys their way out of this one.  I am betting they do, just part of the what is so wrong in America.
Everyone knows he didn't kill himself
Did he know the Clintons?
I worked at boeing on the military side, and this was not my experience regarding quality culture. Maybe boeing should bring a team from their military operations to train the Seattle teams.
This was about the Boeing & its incompetency , this whistle-blower was talking since 2019 , he shot himself , why is this a conspiracy ?
Ohh I'm sure their "real sorry"? Riiiiigggghhht.
Scary to think that someone VERY high up in Boeing authorized this murder, AND that Boeing is prioritizing profits to the point of producing unsafe planes.
Who stands to gain? Ba, the g0bment & ELites especially who want chaos in order to get global control. Most are not fooled.
I doubt it was suicide and think it’s foul play!
"self inflicted" lol boeing is so over
Justice has been served,,,they will remain where they belong,,,prison. Depending on the TRUTH of being molested by their father? That is a focal point on determining some charges?
And, just before he was to testify. 🤔
He named names
Really?
Suicided!
Smells like someone took a page out of the book of how the rich and powerful get away with stuff
What is this, Navalny?
Self-inflicted ! Bull sh*t !!!
Vince Foster was found the same way at Fort Marcy Park off the George Washington Parkway. He had everything to live for except that he FAILED the Clinton's in the White House! I wonder how many Boeing shares they have in their portfolio?
Shut them down!!!
Epsteined.....
They should be investigated in response to this obviously “hit” type death..
It's unfathomable and, unfortunately, true, that 99.9% of people watching this say it's murder that won't be investigated.
it wasn't Boeing who was manufacturing those tools ,I better add, but another company for planes, night!
Russia probably owns Boeing.
As it’s Boeing the investigation on his sudden and unexpected suicide will probably be sent to Boeing to be handled in house by the government.
I wonder if the police at least learned their lesson from countless other botched initial investigations (Jon Benet Ramsey Colorado Springs), and treated this out of an overabundance of caution, as a homicide!   Lordy, Lordy, somehow I have a suspicion that they did not.  Most likely someone in a position of authority was paid off BIG to immediately pronounce it a suicide so that people would come in and trample all the evidence.  The only way they would be able to track down the killer is if they treated this thing like a homicide from the get go.  But I will say this...if even ONE person talks, or even ONE convincing bit of physical evidence emerges that indicates a crime was committed, the whole evil thing is going to collapse like a giant house of cards, in which case, I wouldn't want to be holding ANY BOEING STOCK.    This whole tragic saga would never have happened under a Pure McDonnell Douglas management and engineering team.  I admit they weren't great at selling their commercial line, but I'll tell you what...MDC,  N E V E R would have rushed a dangerous product (the initial 737 Max release) out, KNOWING there would likely be deaths, JUST TO AVOID LOSING MONEY due to late delivery!     That company was guilty of resting on its laurels for too long, I give you that.  A bit of commercial line sales technique problems, and a few lost military bids, and presto, a company which had at one time been the premier worldwide Defender of freedom  had sunk so low in stock value, that it became a buyout target.  But the founder, lovingly known as "Mr Mac" was an honest as the day was long, and neither he, nor Sandy, nor John, EVERRR would have done something so immoral and unethical!  Mr. Mac would have ordered his engineers to get the problems fixed PROPERLY so the aircraft was safe, and he would have chosen to take the Losses due to missing the delivery deadlines!!   I can give discreet examples of times that Mr. Mac CHOSE TO TAKE LOSSES in order to remain true to his hight character and integrity, and to "Do the right thing."
he works for Boeing and even his Charleston lawyer wouldn't help
I'd be a Master Quality Inspector for Boeing and I would do it for free if my job title was Inspector 69!
Cue the conspiracy theorists!
Boeing became McDonnel Douglas at the so called merge. Worked at Boeing 20 years and watched the quality of the work and management descend into what it is today. Since 1995 after the Golden Handshake early retirement quality had become a disgrace. If the FAA would review the vast number of rejection tags per aircraft they would pull Boeings Production Certificate. Boeing does not deliver new ir planes but refurbed airplanes. at Best!
I thought that was only in communist countries...wow they quiet him
The US government needs Boeing. Cant get around those defence contracts. If you know about Boeings shoddy work, you might want to get your affairs in order. Just saying🤷🏽‍♂
Author and investigative journalist Hunter S. Thompson also announced that he had information that would "Blow The Lid Off of 9/11". Shortly thereafter he reportedly shot himself in the head during a phone conversation with his wife about his upcoming book.   Sure he did.  Sure he did.
Another thing Trump was right about!!
if you fly anywhere better make sure its not a boeing!
nim sorry for those type o's, we know what happened and my son in law tried to report
SEE HIS RECENT PICTURE,,, 😔 .. just before his suicide, he looked like Hell.. no kidding, he looked a hard 20 years older, like some homeless guy with mental issues.
I am so sad to hear this. South Carolina factory was created when Boeing leadership thought the biggest problem they had were the two Unions in Puget Sound area. One was for the Machinists and the other Speaa for Engineers.   So they created the Nightmare of South Carolina. No experienced leadership, no experienced workers and no experienced Engineers.   It never got better. It is so sad what happened to such a good company.
Risk of injury in flights has been increasing steadily. 😮
Really,do you think anyone of us believe this garbage, no ,we know ,GOD knows, guess whammy sonic law tried to report about the tools that were not in synch with the planes they service, which means they were off ,not precise, guess what they ,the people selling them and the Germans were told, they moved the company to Chicago,hmmm,my son in law is a jerk, but this I can say ,he tried !
Cue the American bullshit.
Government oversight buttigege at his finest
Anyone seen Hillary?
This is what happens in a trump world. Can't some one just dump trump instead of an honest man.
Arkancide
Nothing wrong with this picture, right? Found murdered you mean?
Bolts? Who needs bolts on an airplane
There is a good chance he was murdered.
Every multinational corporation has the means to hire assassins.
You have to be mentally inept or a person that likes to tempt fate if you fly on a Boeing jet and of course United airlines. Stay far away from both.
corporate murder
MURDERED
Well, a criminal investigation should be launched about the death of this whistleblower. This is ridiculous in our country. Now you know it sounds like the Clintons again murdering people you don’t like they are gonna talk and tell you the truth.
Why would he kill himself if he had a lawsuit pending??
I believe it easily. Been going on forever.
THose calling this a real suicide in the comments; wonder what we would discover if someone investigated THEM?
"Died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound" my eye! He was silenced. Full stop.
Who murdered him? Boeing? For what reason exactly? The shit is already out in the open. Certainly not the Feds-- they are the ones now investigating Boeing aggressively! Ergo= You are all nuts
So very sad
This isn't suspicious at all🤥
Again with suicide?? Hillary’s hitmen again!!
LoL , so typical of what is going on in this $h1th0le country
When will the American people stand up and say enough is enough?
These bastards killed that man… Boeing has him executed.
Jeffery Epstine, this man, fishy.
Sure he took his own life. Not buying it makes the company look really bad
Another " Arkancide " .....like Vince , Seth , and Jeffrey .
Haha you cant even reply on any of the comments
GOD we pray for your help against this world's Elite . We pray for your Justice ⚖️ ✝️🛐
"We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing ..." 🎉🤣😂🥳🎊🤸🏻🕺🏻💃🏻💃🏻🕺🏻
Boeing is so stupid!!! 😂😂 They're gonna get caught like easy!!
Boeing insisted on settling out of court.
Self inflicted come on nobody believes that
Conspiracy nutz: ASSEMBLE!!
Was not a suicide
Self inflicted. Really? Absolutely no one in the country believes that. Lol.
Doesnt Dumpftd fly in a boeing 707
Boeing issued a statement "Syanora sucka"
Corruption
Apparently my comment about how nobody believes Epstein killed himself in spite of what the coroner said keeps getting deleted.
Well, it would appear that certain powerful democrats have a large financial stake in Boeing.   😕
They killed him!
Nothing to see here folks
Of course, it's a suicide! It's whatever they make it look like.
And we point  fingers at Russia,c Hina and Hungry lol☦️ RIP
Does a Clinton sit on the Boeing Board? Too suspicious
This is so egregious; suicide my a$$
He was SOOOOOO whacked.
Let me guess, he shot himself in the back...twice
I feel bad for his family...so sad, as if???!!!! he didn't want to be retired and live his life!!! NO WAYYY IT WAS SUICIDE!!! COMPLETE SCUM THESE COMPANIES ARE!!!
He did not harm himself. PERIOD
Clinton' sided
I feel bad for his family...so sad, as if???!!!! he didn't want to be retired and live his life!!! NO WAYYY IT WAS SUICIDE!!! COMPLETE SCUM THESE COMPANIES ARE!!!
Boeing said *"SHUT IT DWN‼️"* 😮‍💨🤌🏾 RIP to this courageous fellow 😩🙏🏽
this country is just full of evil politics
Apparently this guy had everything going for him and then he offs himself? I am curious to hear what the autopsy will report to see if he shot himself twice. I wonder if the Clinton’s have Boeing stock?
The Clinton assassination playbook... "self-inflicted gunshot wound."
They killed him!!! For sure!
Who controls Boeing
This a big deal, just dont comment , send an email to your news source and political rep. why as of now 4 days later cant find any info on any of this.  who is waiting for this just to disappear.   are you or any of your family getting on a plane in the near future.  think twice
I wonder the ratio of training vs DEI classes these employees have to go through.
Dead air is a real thing one of our dropped a 1000 feet while on patrol out of Kadena about 81. Ift ended up on top of the boarding ladder. Ord had box of CAD's dump on him. They aborted return to Base. For injuries precaution.
These people in this Beautiful world are evil pure evil.
Industrial military complex strikes again
We live in South Carolina now since we retired we are from Northern Virginia, and it's called being Murdaughed...
He was murdered.
Yeah, no, you're not sorry he passed, he was "assisted"
Sucide had several shots to the back of the head
Do the Clintons own Boeing stock?
Merely a coincidence. 🤔
The victim was found dead in his home. An apparent suicide, with 6 self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head.
And we'll never know the truth. This is what happens when you allow corporations to grow unchecked. No facet of American life or business should be allowed to sacrifice safety for profit.
I hope his family continues to fight for him. I'd also get a private investigator. Sorry for your loss. He was a good man✨
3 decades of service, retired in 2017 and then commits suicide after exposing  Boeing.. MT ARSE, DID THEY HIRE CLINTON!?  Epstein did kill himself either
In America you die for speaking the truth.
That's fkn insane. People are really getting assassinated right in front of our eyes for exposing greedy corporations, and not a single thing will be done about it. They will keep getting away with murder and so will our government. We are quickly becoming Communist China.
How convenient 😮
And it begins……greed is a killer. This type of murder is a government specialty
Oh my gosh John I'm so sorry what happened to you!  Praying for your family & friends!
They Deleted him,  those monstrous  creatures. Whistler blowers are very important. The world needs to stand up against bullying and harrasment at the JOB. Directors , supervisors and managers are ALWAYS harassing employees.  Why they don't get rid of those job titles in management.
WHERE WAS HIL I LIARY CLINTON
Were either of the Clintons in the area, when he died.? Whistle blower suicides are their specialty.
I will make a point to never fly on a Boeing aircraft again.  This is horrible and they don't fool anybody.
They have a strange definition of self inflicted.
I wasn't aware Hillary Clinton owned Boeing.
This definitely don't smell like a conspiracy. Boeing had him killed
He was EPSTEINED, BY BOEING, He knew too much.
Problem with a SF flight today also. Why I avoid flying as much as possible.
Our thoughts are with his family and friends. Should there be anyone else with anymore  bright ideas.
Hillary?
Yeah... that's not suspicious at all. 😶
Boeing is “saddened” by his passing. Everyone knows it was a hit and who put it out on him. Bastards.
Wicked. RIP 🙏🌹
You couldn't pay me to get on an airplane or cruise ship! I can see the world from home!! Ain't technology great!! Yea till it's not!
SURE it was self inflicted. SURE, they're sad...give me a break.
Imagine that 😂
he was killed by Boeing
Dead people dont talk do they boeing ceo
Must know the Clinton’s!
Wasnt suicide
Boeing sent John a Dear John letter. Attached with a Bullet...😮
Sends a message for anyone thinking to expose any company of wrong doing.
Clintonized.
Self inflicted? Murdered? How deep does the corruption in corporate America go? Jeffrey Epstein, the military industrial complex, Donald, Mike Pence...Mike Pence helped strip America to lawful bodily autonomy. Hes so interested in our bodies because that's what comprises his inner world. This is self evident that a man who talks and seeks control of others must fill his mind with thoughts of controlling women because thats whayhe did. Hes still doing it. He is utterly unaccountable to his pathology which is why he has a pathology of warped thoughts and identifying with those warped thoughts causes unnatural ends. We are witnessing those ends which means his end of a kind is coming. A massive election win giving Congress literal power to effect real change in real time by altering the constitution should only be done with the purest intent and humility giving ones self over to the service of the citizen equally and we can create heaven on earth right now. It may take years and years and the planet might have different plans but we will finally see each other in truth.
I consider anyone who thinks that someone else didn't off him a conspiracy theorist.
Never dedicate ur life's work to a corporation they clearly don't appreciate it..
Not a suicide!!!!
Very suspicious!! I call bullshit+! $#??
We all will have to give account for our actions in life.
Imagine that..greed over life.
Never flying again.
Wouldn't be surprised to find out Hil.lary's fingerprints on this too.
That is sad. We knew they were going to kill him that wasn't self inflicted.
Money, money, money.  We're behind schedule and production schedule is made for MAXIMUM PROFITS.  Quality control can be overlooked.  Happens all the time.
Reminds me of Terrance Yeakey who allegedly bound his own hands and then shot himself a couple times in the head.
You really believe the controlled media? Jokes on you! 🤣
I’m sure they are deeply sad what BS
Yeah yeah yeah and the sky is falling!  No way!
Definitely NOT self inflicted!!! They got to him. Boeing is ruthless 😢😮😮😮😮
The k.J.U./ puten play  book?
And like most suspicious suicides,nothing will come of it after an investigation is finally performed(after months of complaints from family and friends).
And yet, no one will do anything about it. The cogs will keep churning and this will be forgotten.
Taking examples from Putin, eh, Boeing?
I don't believe it was a suicide.
Come on, Man. This guy did not kill him self.
Blood on Boeings hands
Hillary Clinton?
Where was Killary Clinton?
Did I miss it?  I heard zero mention of an investigation into his death and OBVIOUS murder.
I'm an ex quality control person from Boeing too.  He's right.  Schedule was the only thing they cared about.  It is how they get paid though.  But yeah, they aren't above doing something shady to meet the schedule.  Quality is only a problem if the customer notices it.
Hillary, Obama, or Biden ?? Someone didn't want him talking..
RIP
Clintoned
Boeing should divorce McDonnellDouglas ASAP
Damn, just like Epstein. The shooter barely beat JFK to his inevitable suicide too.
This is what happens when any industry embraces DEI. Mr Barnett was going to spill the beans and they killed him.
Was a Quality/Process Assurance professional for 30+ years....can say authoritatively that my profession was always pressured by the demands of production needs, schedule to be met and mostly, the cost of delays caused by substandard practices. Ask anyone with my experience, they will have faced these challenges, while trying to assure that the very best outcome is user safety and satisfaction.
Sad that this is as far as this story will go.
Check the Clinton's phone, I'm sure she gave Boeing some tips or tricks  of the trade
Boeing hires hitman and engineer your susu
Imagine that...
All My Sons - a play by Arthur Miller.
SOUNDS LIKE BACK WHEN  THE CLINTONS WERE IN OFFICE  ALOT OF PEOPLE  TURNED UP DEAD THROUGH THE YEARS . ONE THING , WE MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENS  BUT GOD DOES  AND HE HAS THE LAST SAY  BEFORE  ANYONE ENTERS  ETERNITY WHERE EVER THAT IS .
I guess they wanted to send a message. Don't think we'll be seeing any more Boeing whistleblowers and they'll just keep having problems with their planes
I will NEVER, EVER, fly on a Boeing aircraft again.  My prayers and thoughts are with his family.
I don't believe I will be flying any time soon. RIP good man.
I blame Americans. This country has been "keeping up with the Kardashians" and worshipping the wealth and powerful, buying all their crap so we can be seen having "stuff" for the past 20 years. Our value system has been put in place by Wall Street Marketing Executives and we have dumbly allowed it. The Corporatocracy has become too powerful, and thus corrupt. Most of you don't even realize what CITIZENS UNITED is because it was passed while you had your heads buried in Kim Kardashian's arse. It was the most draconian legislation passed in this country's history. It muffled your vote and sold the country to corrupt multinational corporations. Stop buying their sht. Save your money and starver them out.
Yevgeny Prigozhin plane crash was an “accident” if this was a “suicide”.
SOON ALL WILL BE KNOWN BELIEVE!!!!!!!!!!
He was unalived by someone else's hand RIP John
Yeah,  not buying it.
Why am I not surprised. I used to work for Boeing back in the 80’s in a large office above a diesel refueling station. Employees would get sick and pass out from the rising fumes. When I first started there, I was shocked and told my Lead I was going to report this to Human Resources. He strongly advised me not to or I’d be fired the next day given that confidentiality between HR and management was a joke.  I was working 2nd shift and was informed the EPA just tested for toxins during the day when there was no refueling taking place. This told me that the EPA was in cahoots with Boeing so I transferred to another department asap, then eventually to a better company. Truth be told, Boeing has no regard for human life. It's a very toxic work culture, both literally and figuratively.
Damnn 😢if this was in Russian 😢😢😢
The democrats suicided him. lol
I wonder how much thehitter got paid
Sounds like Clinton operatives might be involved.
B. S.
This was a murder suicide
Ive never seen an entire comment section agree before....i know this man will never get justice though. Since he cant get his lawsuit we should boycott Boeing in his honor. His whistle blowing saved lives.
I'm sure Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide too.  I'm sure investigators, if they look, will find all the nearby video cameras in the area weren't working at the time. Imagine that.......
He was killed
Hey was hillary anywhere in the area?  or george s.?  Who knows anymore.
No way!!! They killed him or had him killed! He sure wouldn’t have done it in the parking lot! For Pete sake! Talking about some crooked people! They could care less if people get killed flying on their planes just get them in the sky!!!!
God will. All sin will exposed,  maybe not right away, but its coming.
This happens too often with the rich + powerful to be a coincidence. Just like Seth Rich after the DNC Wikileaks incident, and just like the three executives from the Trump casinos right before they went bankrupt in the late 80s
Boycott flying on Boeing planes...do your diligence
Wow tragic!! Man was onto something and they killed him.
Shades of Silkwood.
I wont be flying any time soon!
Customers should be able to know what airplane companies built their plane when purchasing a ticket. Unless it’s already on a ticket and I’m not aware of it.
It sounds to me like he was Vince Fostered.  I wonder where former president Bill Clinton was?
Dame.... He was Jeffrey Epsteined!!!!!
Daanng 90 days!? For a plan. Not to have it dealt with period, just for a plan. Big corporations have tight grip on every major aspect of our lives. 90 days… for a plan.
I believe this man was murdered, to coverup the crappy workmanship in a airplane, that has already cost several hundred people their lives. May John Barnett, rest in peace with the Lord & deepest condolences to his family & friends.
How convenient..
We are becoming a 3rd world country.
Did the Clintons have stock in this company?
Whoa
Damn, dude dead like that
Did Hillary get his address...🤔😉
SHOCKING!
Murder, plain and simple.
Door plug whistle blower got plugged.
People who want to speak up: Don't let this stop you! Hopefully this will be investigated by legitimate investigators, but we are all watching! We see what is actually happening! Don't give up!
Foul play?
Murdered after 30 years of service. 😢 They are getting bold.
redruM
Does this surprise True Patriots!?!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqgTcb8DqfY&ab_channel=ColdFusion
John Barnett & Jeffrey Epstein didn’t kill themselves...
So he kept his mouth shut for 30 years?
Fishy Fishy and Fishy. Lord have mercy on his precious family.
Boeing are a disgrace, I wouldn't fly on anything that rotten company makes. They are legendary for the crap they make.
That smells very stinky…
Was he close to Hillary??☠️
Self-inflicted... hahahaha
We are ruled by evil rich men.
Check the coroner's financials. There was no way this was coincidence.
Yeah...I bet that Boeing is "really sad about this." UGH!!!
No, he was murdered
Suicide? Bologna! Completely not believable.
Wow! Corporations can literally kill people for whistleblowing and the media writes the cover up. This is homicide. Not suicide.
Murdered
"Hey, I've seen this one before!"
Who wants to ride on one of their planes now? Answer: No one.
SEEMS 🤔 LEGIT.
The ole committed suicide excuse.
How about we shut them down until we figure out what the fuck is going on?
Hope he had hidden cameras around his place!!
Bullshit he was taken out.
I find suicide hard to believe.
Recruiting only the best and brightest  Boeing.....or those you can bribe?  Big business answers to The Chairman.   Disgusting.
Boeing easily mouths platitudes but they are probably heaving a sigh of relief. I am sad for his loved ones.
Cameras, cellphone data?
Corporate America does not give a sheet about their customers, greed is all they are about!
Not planning on flying Boeing planes in the future. Airbus only.
Why in the hell would he have committed suicide,  if he had a lawsuit against Boeing, coming up soon? That doesn't make a bit of sense! He Was MURDERED!!!
Oh yeah that sounds like get rid of him.
Self-inflicted gunshot?  Don’t think so.
Boeing looks like a criminal organization
Scary stuff
Damn they knew it was going to do damage  to there company
I call self inflicted Bull Shit.
Okay..how much Boeing stock do the Clintons own??
Boom yr dead. That's why no one will.come foreward and everyone is scared. The government big text and big companies. My sister worked for Boeing. She would be ashamed of they unqualified Dei. Hires the world has gone mad. Deport illegals
Boeing is out of a BLUE STATE!!  THESE PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE ABOVE THE LAW. COMMUNISTS NEED TO BE REMOVED!
Wow
Hmmmm...
Terrible
Removed from harm's way.
Clinton’s are probably involved
Poor guy went the way of Epstein.
Justice department can't investigate Boeing. They are funded by the government. Conflict of interest.
Let’s hope the Charleston Police have a ‘Colombo’ investigating this.
So was he cleaning his gun or what?
dirty follow the money
😵😳
Deep State wickedness
The poor bastard has been Dr David Kelly'd..... 😞😡🤬
Where did he shoot himself, and how many times?
Guess who was behind that gun!
If he was made unconscious, someone can hold a gun with his hand to make it look like a suicide.
They killed him
I can't believe they killed him. So sad. They didn't want him to win his lawsuit which he would've won. May those responsible for his murder be charged to the full extent of the law.
10 years from now we will look back on today as the day Boeing died.
Brandy Vaughan ... Seth Rich ... and on n' on...
Snitches get ......
And people like to say the deep State doesn't exist!
Fck Boeing
You didn't do anything about Epstein, you're not going to do anything about this guy. So shut up and go make me a sandwich.        Stop with all the outrage, please people making me ashamed to be a citizen of a country that runs like this
Sus
We all Know Who Killed Him, You never say anything  about $$%$$. Who cares about  employees 😢😢😢😢😢😢
John Barnett attorney
Watch your back Boeing. Vengeance is mine says the Lord?
Ya him and Ebstien killed themselves...WTF
How convinent for boeing
I would be looking  into  this. Any company affiliated with the government can not be trusted and will do anything to protect themsekves.
Stocks values matter.
Suing the big guy has its consequences like Jeffrey Epstein didn’t kill himself.
Who's pocket benefits from this? U on da radar foo
This is so sad..  self- inflicted???  He is probably the only one who would've spoken up. Now he is gone others will not say a word. Hope his attorney stays on the case for his family.
They killed him!
Very suspicious
He was murdered. I hope they investigate this.
He killed himself when he had a large lawsuit coming up that he was going to win.. yea ok
its always suicide... assisted that is lol
Russia did itto him       Oh wait! This is in the US so he did it to himself
Is there any question whether these war-daddy pukes play for keeps?
Im glad i am done flying
Never thought I'd see Boeing employ the Epstein solution... Is Bill Barr working for Boeing now?
LOL, and Epstein hung himself.
Boeing outsourses alot to CHINA
Cancel Government Contracts with Boeing
what ever happened to, get the scoop on subject matter... investigate, hit the street, look into before you report....oh i forgot there will be an update once they write the script..... nevermind....
Murder!
Yes Gulfstream is no bettet
"Killed himself"
Yeah Boeing is saddened about his passing. That's a lie
Boeing, going the extra mile for your money and not your safety.
I've read this John Grisham book. You know it wasn't suicide.
I hope they investigate! Sounds like a Putin kinda thing 😢
WTF!
NOT suicide. Being a whistle blower cost him his life. Boeing should be throughly investigated. Someone, somewhere in that multiple millionaire corporation is at fault. You will NEVER convince me he took his own life.
😢
Sure
He got epsteined
I bet Boeing paid a hitman to kill the poor guy in a simulated suicide.
Boeing has contractors to ELIMINATE problems !!!
If Boeing wanted to off this guy (RIP) they should've just booked him flights on their planes! It would be far less sus. 🤔🤨
Hillary s peeps did it
Here's an alternate angle - Airbus knocked him off. 😂😂😂😂
No credibility in the words "self inflicted", none. It was a contracted job and every one knows it.
Let me guess, like the old Soviet days where he shot himself in the head six times?
And nobody seems to care……
He knew things. Lots of things. I'm sure more Boeing skeletons are going to come out. Boeing is in freefall now. There are so many troubling things going on. So many. The rabbit hole is deep. There is no way I'm flying any Boeing plane now. Airbus or no fly. Watch the movie "The Insider" with Russell Crowe playing Jeffrey Wigand who exposed the tobacco industry and what they knew about tobacco. This is far from over and more tragedies are unfortunately coming. Incidents seemingly every other week now involving Boeing passenger or cargo planes. They are LETTING unsafe planes fly now with so many lax things going on now with Boeing being exposed.
This doesn't pass the smell test!!!!!!
They killed him
Why arent these audits happening regularly?
Yea he didn’t have anything to live for any longer ..!!!😅.!! Meanwhile he was sewing Boeing  ..!! Not sus at all .!!
Nothing to see here, go away, he was depressed and killed himself.
Epstein flu?
Probably C1inton goons.  Boeing and C1inton are very close.  I mean BFF level close...
Scumbags at Boeing cut costs to get bigger boats, and killed this guy for telling the American people about it.
Don't anyone worry, the justice department is on it. Going to do a thorough investigation. You can all sleep easy now.
Who protects whiselblowers? Don't believe it was self-inflicted.
What a week for Boeing!! Crashing planes, murdering ex-employees who spoke the truth!!  What will next week bring?
Oh how shocking a whistleblower of the military industrial complex found dead ? That cant be 🤔its disgustingly common unfortunately 🤮🤬
Why would he kill himself, when he was going to court in 2 months (date set), to sue BOEING.
He died from a coincidence.
Murder for hire by you know who
Yeah and epstein hung himself from a 6ft bunk bed
Maybe He got “Epsteined”
😳😡😡😡😡😡😳.  Wow you know he didn’t make himself dead.
I kind of hate that people call it “Epsteined”. This man seems to be a victim. Epstein was hardly a victim.
Boeing taking moves from Putin??
Uummm???
Sounds like a murder.  I do not believe he would kill himself.
I call it a government inflicted wound
How many times did he shoot himself, first two were minor flesh wounds, and he finally doubled, tapped himself in the back of the head, correct ?
Of course, he naturally killed himself….NOT.
Employees will think twice now.
SORRY FOR THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF THIS BRAVE MAN
They Killed Him!!!
Wow. Boeing is like Mafia now. It's scary. No wonder its business is still not closed after so many accidents and deaths. It's bigger and more sinister than Enron.
He didnt Epstein himself. He was taken by someone elses hand. And Boeing isnt sadden about anything. They had a hand in it
This reminds me of Epstein.
Kinda like Epstein killed himself?
Conspiracy theorists are just news anchors ahead of their time because no one does investigative journalisming anymore.
Of course they did it. Money can do anything 😢
Government and institutions murdering their own citizens .... I will not be flying anytime soon
Yeah, he was arkansided....
Yeah, he was arkansided....
They are saddened by his death. They said so. Must have been all the remorse for telling the truth and attempting to hold a large corp accountable for their oopsies.
Ok. Does anyone really believe it was a self-inflicted gunshot wound?
He was killed
They killed him
Boeing is all broken up over his passing, are they?! Somehow I don't think so.😢
Let me guess?: A self inflicted shotgun to the back. And, they never found the shotgun. Hillery must have Boeing stock
Well, that's not suspicious at all 🙄
❤IF IT IS TRUE THAT THEY MURDERED HIM .  ...WELL THEY CANT KILL EVERYONE CAN THEY ? ... I ONCE COMPLAINED AFTER FLYING FROM FLORIDA TO IOWA...BECAUSE THE DOOR WAS TRYING TO COME OFF WHILE WE WERE IN THE AIR ! THE STAFF DIDNT SEEM TO GIVE A CRAP! I NO LONGER FLY ! .. RATHER THAN CONDEMN A PLANE ..IT APPEARS THAT THEY WILL FLY IT UNTIL IT FAILS.....BECAUSE THEY GET THE INSURANCE MONEY THAT WAY..
The quote from Boeing "We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends' was followed by, 'hehehe, wink wink'...
As sure as the sun will rise from the East and set to the West and even if this guy was struck by lightning. Yup! Conspiracy nuts will scream MURDER!
They don’t even try to hide murder anymore
I truly believe in God's justice. That was not suicide. I pray for the family and friends.
Sounds like he got “Clintoned”…
Investigation ⚖️🇺🇸
he got Clintoned................or maybe it was Haley'd
This is how corporations govern. This is how they respond to public safety issues.
So much for whistleblower protection laws, every whistleblower that has come out against some big Tech in the last few months has either had to flee the country or been found dead
IT sounds it goes WAY BEYOND the issues of SAFETY PROTOCOL… why would a retired BOEING EMPLOYEE STICK HIS NECK OUT.., Something DOES NOT SMELL RIGHT… my condolences to his FAMILY and FRIENDS 🙏🙏🙏🙏🇺🇸🇺🇸😢👁️🤔
👀
This is quite terrifying considering I live in South Carolina and now the government's killing people here too
This is so sad!  But God knows the answer!
It's obviously a hit
Wow self inflicted yep and the earth is flat!
Nothing new theyve been in other corruption episodes. Some say thier secretly transporting children too.
Clintonized
This man died because he didn't want you or your family dying on a Boeing plane.  Don't forget him.
Of course it was a suicide with the help of an operative.
Right, he was suicided.  They made him an example for anyone else who was considering talking about Boeing.  Wow!  I am aware that politicians suicide people, but I didn’t realize Boeing does it too.
Sure! So was Epstein
Really! Self inflicted. By the other person holding the gun. You don't take a dummy to see that one.
Self inflicted gunshot. No. Gunshot inflicted by someone holding his hand with a gun. Don’t blow whistles on a government contracted employer or you’ll blow no more whistles.
Bullcrap
Epstein did not kill himself, and neither did this man.
Just like Epstein "killed" himself.
The government wants them to improve quality?  Then let them hire the most qualified.  And, Boeing needs to drug test their employees.  This is an aircraft!
The continued harassment by Buttajug's democratic leaders.
Reminds one of Epstein doesn't it?
HILLARY?
Biden America
Is Killary connected to Boeing?
evil souls in this world .
You really think your audience will believe the suicide story?
Well that just freaking figures 😡😡😡😡😡
Ask Niki and watch her expression...he definitely was murdered
Whistleblower John Barnett committed suicide on Saturday by shooting himself 3 times in the back. Police see no evidence of 'foul play'.😉
Boeing called Killary and she was glad to help--NOT self inflicted.
Boeing has become used to taking the government money and military industrial complex money and contracts. They feel they do not have to earn respect through quality anymore. Boeing is very connected to the American Mafia aka 3 letter agencies . It would seem like they could and would have a whistleblower murdered
Lol what a lie  Clinton’s probably sent a guy
He got Epstein
Kind of makes you wonder, doesnt it?
He was Clintoned
Prayers and condolences
They will cover it up even though we know they murder this poor guy 😮
Skynet exorcists better start getting some stock options and lots of money quick or more problems like this are gonna start happening. Proof you are totally confused and bewildered on what wrong with the planes and electronics.
Riiigggggghhht! He "suicided" himself the same as all the others now dead because they had a conscience and chose to speak up to try and fix problems like UNSAFE AIRPLANES that YOU will fly on. Boeing has massive buckets of blood on their hands ... along with just about everybody else in the Corporate world!!
He got Hilary Clintoned
I believe he killed himself as much as I believe Epstein did. Not. At. All.
Every comment calls BS on suicide. As a whistleblower myself, I agree.
He got Clintoned
He was probably told they'd eliminate his while family if he continued with the lawsuits and gave him two options.
Is it not terrifying that these corporations literally get away with everything...including murder?
HMMM 🤔 I THINK THIS WAS A MOVIE PLOT 😮 SOMETHING'S FISHY 🐟 CONDOLENCES TO HIS FAMILY
How far from his hand was the handgun?
a "self-inflicted" gunshot wound.
How’s this any different than what happens to other whistleblowers in other countries?
Time I heard David Muir,  ABC's  anchor  say Boeing whistleblower found dead from apparent suicide I came right here because I knew it sounded so FISHY !
What info did he have on Hillary Clinton?
💔
Another one that was "Suicided". How convenient. Remember Epstein!+
Is it just me, or does it sound like Boeing's DIE commitment is generating all kinds of issues?  Cause in the anti-White racist culture I've seen promoted by DIE's loyal wolves, it's expected that White men will do their utmost, but a black whose resume is 95% just "blm" gets hired without any serious QC. A black can literally put the bolts in poorly and whip out the race card if told to fix it.
Jeffery Epstein de ja vu. Let this be a warning to all Boeing whistleblowers.... make sure you record all the dirt you have on Boeing and send it to as many media outlets as possible.
BOYCOTT
He must have known something against the biden’s or Clinton’s!
The matrix kills again
Suddenly, he " killed himself." I seriously doubt it,
Anything but "self"
This is disturbing. They are failing to comply with THEIR OWN QUALITY STANDARDS!! His death must be thoroughly investigated. We all know people who fly on these planes. My daughter is a FA and I am frightened for her.😢
And everybody thinks the Russians are corrupt.
Apparent suicide. How fortunate for Boeing. Condolences to his family.
I bet there will be a white washed investigation, "No foul play found" if any investigation at all, just wait and see!
That man was about to cash out aint no way he did that to himself. I call BS.
Where’s Hillary? Bless him and his family
Boeing's CEO and the Board of Directors on how to deal with the whistleblower: Board:" Can we make him sit next to the window on his next flight? CEO: "we tried, he wasn't on the flight." Board: "What if a tire "falls" off a plane onto his car? CEO: We tried but missed the drivers side of the car. Board: "Why can't we just shot him and make it look like suicide? CEO: really I can do that?
I don’t believe that this guy and Epstein killed themselves
This is insane. Im tired of the rich
This stinks to high heaven and yes this guy was killed.
What happens is big money invests in these companies, and their main focus is money not quality.
Murdered
Does Hillary own any Boeing Stock ???????
Ему следовало держать рот на замке.
Self-inflicted by Boeing Hitman
This has got to stop! Sure self inflicted gun shot wound! He was Epsteined
I have a good friend that retired from Boeing in  Seattle for over 30 years.  He told me that the plant in South Carolina was putting out planes that were so screwed up that they had to fly them to Seattle to be totally disassembled and fixed then reassembled before sending to the customer.
Why  R  we  NOT  Supprised  ?  🎉
Boeing owns congress . Case closed .
They deleted him 😢
Do the Clintons have stock in Boeing
Do the Clintons have stock in Boeing

America is no different than Russia or CCP.
A special Prosecutor should be Appointed NOW!!!, all Boeing “affairs” regarding this incident should be PUBLIC!!!, all data should be COLLECTED by US CONGRESS!!! Any Criminal Activities and people involved should be prosecuted and JAILED NOW!!!
Murdered, IMHO
The corporations openly poison us, now they just hire hit men. . . I wonder where a Government Military-industrial Complex "contractor" could get ahold of a specially trained sociopath thats able to make it look a certain way. 🤔 we all know a stock ticker is worth more than any American life.
Welcome to Chile, 1975
I don't believe that he  killed himself.
😢
Anyway seems that Boeing is in a bad situation these days!!
May God bless his soul.........
"They" killed him... the local officials will be paid off or too scared to speak up... and it will be swept under the rug... but God Almighty knows... and never forgets...
What has Dave Calhoun been doing?
He Epstein himself… they would like you to believe so
Must have had dirt on the Clinton Clan.
The company released a statement saying they are saddened. Stop lying They are glad and responsible for his demise
Shot himself twice in the back of his head
Huh. No shit?
Dont f!#$ with Boeing, but yeah Boeing su€ks.
Something doesn't sound right?
Yep
W H O BENEFITS  ?LET US  THINK.    UM UM. UM. NO BODY COMES TO MIND 😂😂😂
Hmmmmmmm.....seems legit???
Sounds 🐟 🐟 don’t mess with airliners 😂
Another suicided whistleblower. Every time you whistleblow oligarchy misconduct, you get MacAfeed.
Oh yeah, nothing suspicious about this. Just one of those coincidences.
My God people, we are living in worse than soviet conditions here in the United States. Wake up! Truth tellers are murdered in plain sight, two teired justice system, journalists are being jailed, politicians trying to jail their opponents. Groceries we can't afford, housing costs we can't afford, insurance rates through the roof, printing money like it's meaningless, funding both sides of foreign wars while we are 31 trillion dollars in debt. This is not freedom, America as we knew it no longer exists. And half of this county doesn't care because it's "their side" that's doing it. Frogs in boiling water. What is it going to take for the masses to stand up for what's right?
He Epsteined himself? Strange.....
That didn't take long. What a coincidence. Yea, conspiracies aren't real. 😂
I would like to see them try to say he was sucked out of a Boeing faulty door and landed in the motel room.
My God.
Yep money money
Well now, that just saved Boeing hundreds of millions of dollars.  They could not hire more help to get all the work done in excellent condition.  I assume they pocket more money by running short handed.
Looks like Corporations have taken up Arkancide to send that message. Snitches get ditches.......
Ah yes, the classic self inflicted gunshot wound of someone who wasn't suicidal.
Hounded to death or Epsteined?
It takes a brave man to speak out. Do brave people who are willing to speak up take their own life?
Something fishy
Drove from Louisiana to shoot himself in South Carolina, call the Tourist Board.  I'm not a Forensic Scientist, but...I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night!
give us a break  it was Murder
I guess Haley really did admire Hillary....
What a coincidence.
Retaliation finalized.
We live in a world where fast production and shareholders and cutting corners is the norm. QC should be #1 priority  not how much the CEO can make. It's a airplane not the fast food industry!
He found out.
Vince Foster
Boeing Epsteined him
Wow they killed him  FBI needs to put away all involved or resigne their jobs
Watch out Boeing I don't think you want to follow the clinton's down that road
He was killed.
Self inflicted right.  Was Hillary anywhere close by?
Its called murder
Hillary's technique.
Smells like something  really going on
Government contracts? Get rid of all that bring testimony against the government or its contractors!
Coincidence....
A coroner is not part of an investigation. His job is to determine the cause of death. The fact that this un-named coroner immediately tired to suggest that he had "solved the crime' says to me that someone paid him to make this statement, and that both the local police and media were okay with that. Pretty suspicious, the "Nothing to see here, folks" conclusion comes up immediately.
EVERY COMMENT SAYS MURDER. That in itself is nuts. I believe the temperature of the USA has just been checked.
The corporate fixer handled it.
He murdered himself years ago , This was A hit job!
OUR GOVERNMENT ARE EVIL NATZIS. GREED ABD POWER.
Oh, look another Jeffrey Epstein how convenient for the Democrats😂😂😂
He committed " suicide?"
There's nothing at all weird or suspicious about that.mm
Sure. A guy who was looking forward to retirement.😏😏
Rip John Mitch Swampy Barnett, you will be missed
WOW, what a coincidence!
Welcome to Russia. Putin ain’t got shit on USA Administration. Bye bye Freedom and Democracy. We fkn lost
"self"-inflicted gunshot wound. fascism at its finest
Must have used the same coroner as Epstein
Wheres the FBI on this matter, everyone knows this murder cant go unjust!!🤬😡
So sorry to hear about this man. My condolences to his Family. Regarding Boeing, this is what you get when you run your company by a bunch of MBAs who don't know squat about engineering.
They know we are not stupid but they also know only a unified people could do anything about the obvious and they know that won’t happen because the left have divided us to the point they know a mass of United people are not possible at this point! Maybe, just maybe enough of us have opened up our eyes to the truth and will not be led any further by their power, greed and lack of integrity! If we don’t come together soon we are doomed! Our lives will not be our own.
He was in D.C. testifying. He lives in South Carolina.
Why did Hillary Clinton have him killed?
They killed him, plan and simple.
My condolences to his family and friends. I'm so sorry that this had to happen. I pray justice prevail's.
Contract hit.
Another tragic loss of life
God, shine Your LIGHT. 🙏
Clintonized
Lool at 737 history not good lots of Accidents.
“we are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends” sounds like a warning to me
No one seems to believe our glorious leaders or their presstitutes any longer. Gee, I wonder why..... 😂
Say hello to Seth Rich
It seems to me that someone wanted to shut him up! Quality seems to have issues with this man.
He was unceremoniously Epstein-ed  ⁉
The corporations are the real enemy of the people.
My question to you all are you still going to fly ? If the answer is still yes expect more death because this man risk his life to let us all know what’s going on with air lines and it seems like Boeing isn’t going to do anything about it. One word comes to my mine “ Depopulation “ because if they don’t have any time to fix the issues this man complained about, they sure hell will find time for investigations? Doesn’t make sense. Boycott and save a life !
Geewizickers! Who woulda thunk it. Boeing needs to be investigated CLOSELY!!!!
Haley's hit squad took him out
Coverup murder!!!!!!
No one seems to believe our glorious leaders and their presstitutes any longer. Gee, I wonder why....    😂
This is a thing .. I raised safety issues at home depot and they fired me days later.
Another apparent suicide?
Self inflicted? I dont believe that!
That man was a fellow Louisianan. I am very suspicious.
I hope the family asks for an independent forensic examination
Self inflected gunshots to the back of the head are always the worst.
The Clinton's suicide planner strikes again!
OmG, this is so sad! I feel so bad for his family, friends and loved ones!
WOW ... Just atrocious....
How sad. Praying for his family and friends.  Doubt it was death by suicide.
Keep on with this diversity hiring and it won't be safe to fly anywhere
Rampant speculation of murder and associated gossip is not conducive to justice nor helpful to victims of tragedy.
Wow. They just murder whistleblowers now.
Suicide? Is that short for murder?
No surprise. Hillaried.
Ah yes, that will be suicide by murder then.......
They killed him.
Bidens administration had him killed
He fell down an elevator shaft onto some bullets
Boeing
Seems odd.
No one is safe in America now! Muder is the new norm!
Hillary?
Right !!!!
Maybe the safety switch, on his revolver, was made in a Boeing factory?
Murder
Not saying Boeing kill the whistle blower, but looks kinda suspicious.
So he unalived himself in a public parking lot?
USSR regular practices.
It is never really safety first....It is money first....
Can't wait to hear what his family thinks of all of this.
Its all about the money.
Seth Rich: "Welcome to the Club John"
Nothing will happen. The Western world is just as nasty and corrupt as any Third World country the West may criticize. The West just does it smoothly and with more sophistication than those colored folks.
Check Hillary's call log to find out who did it
I'm shocked, SHOCKED, that this man got Epsteined!
The Pentagon is killing anyone who talks on anything the Government don't want the public to know
Oh god, wait for tye conspiracies  lmaoooooooooooooo😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm curious what his family has to say about this, did he own a gun or even seem suicidal at all?  How convenient for Boeing.
I’m not flying anymore if I can help it. This is wrong
Very, very, very suspicious. And apparently he’s been cremated. How convenient.
Boeing must have consulted with the Clintons.
Hit job.
🙏🙏🙏 for his family
I worked in Quality Control for many years, as well as Safety.  Companies are always saying "Safety First".  But when they are behind schedule and costing them money, safety is the first thing to go and then quality.  I think everyone already knows that it all boils down to money.
Shocker these cops are unbelievable. The 3 letter agencies are a disgrace.
What's a 787 Max 9?
A pro Hit. ..
COME ON MAN  he was taken out   PLANE and SIMPLE   big companies have their own ASSETS on staff  for these types of ISSUES   think about it   25k vs multi million suit    the 25k wins everytime   they have the same get up used in THE SHOOTER MOVIE with walburg
Nope..he was murdered
So is the FBI investigating his death???
each step in the construction of aircraft requires inspections. There are steps and processes for the construction of aircraft. Some negative finances must exist.
Epstein didn't kill himself either..
Hillary strikes again😂
Just another victim of the MAX.  When will they pull that effin plane?  The day Boeing stops funding Patty Murray and Cantwell.
BOEING had him snuffed
Probably refused to pay his phone bill.
Boeing is relieved at his death.  No wonder the Hilda Beast has been creeping around lately.
No doubt all the security cameras in the area will have been "broken"...
There will be zero justice
It wasn't self inflicted. Get real.
Murdered.
Found in the trunk of his vehicle.
Sounds really shady to me why would he commit suiside when he potentially could have been rich from a lawsuit against Boeing uh it just doesn’t pass the smell test ❤god bless him and his family
Here’s a movie plot: bring stock value way down , invest millions . Fix issues and make mega profits. Follow political ties and investing ( inside trading).
ABC bois real bad at faking suicides.
It just never stops.  I don't believe self-inflicted for a minute.  Why in the world didn't he record some of these conversations?
He committed suicide, yea right.
Someone did it!!! 😢😢😢....
I'm shocked....
Well,......what a coincidence 🤔 👀
Glad this can be seen for what it is. Everyone knows this suicide story is bullshit. Now we should figure out how to handle a plane company having the power to murder someone who spoke the truth about the deficiencies in their company that directly impacted the public. This should not be overlooked.
We all know who did that!
Murder
The company Boeing is insane.
Safe travels when flying everyone. This man refused to put his name on any planes being built out of SC due to quality! Boeing is willing to roll the dice of many lives to fulfill their greed.
Epsteined.
He got “Epsteined”.
Where were the Clintons?
Not surprised.
Wow all out  cover up?
ANOTHER ORCHESTRATED "SUICIDE" OF A WHISTLEBLOWER....MAGA TRUMP...FJB&NWO...
It's not suspicious at all that a whistle-blower kill himself, especially when he's set to receive millions of dollars from his retaliation lawsuit, noting to see here move alone.... 😮
You have to wonder, how much stock/money do the Clintons have in Boeing?
He was Madrid by the swamp!
Totally murder.
And that’s the last you will hear about this ever
No surprise him being targeted?
I knew him he was nowhere near killing himself.Very happy person
Nothing to see here.  Cough cough.
Every reason to believe murder.
So I guess they can fix problems
How convenient.....
That was murder clear and simple made to look like self harm
😢😢😢😢😢😢
when Boeing left Kansas and Washington State to "Diversify" to all 50 states, they adopted a culture of cost and quality cuts, de-unionize and flim flam the governmental inspectors for military and civilian aircraft quality control...they also destroyed the economy in Kansas. Destroyed the middle class and turned Kansas into a Christian nationalism Taliban state
Sounds like a hillary clinton-type suicide
What about all of the military aircraft the produce?
Of Course!!!  They will take you out if you talk to much
Clintons?  They're the best at disappearing people.
Who is paying the coroner?
John found Clintoned should be the headline!
its always "suicide"....when will the real detectives with integrity stand up and say the truth
John Barnett didn't Epstein himself!
God bless this man he wanted to.tell.us 🙏  he is a angel ❤.
What WS..
crash boeing stock
All these news channels have the same thumbnail and start with "whistle blower" and "found dead".... then boom... deflection...  That's crazy
He was murdered. Obvious to everyone.
That wasn't suicide 😢
POOR MAN KILLED USA IS SO CORRUPT
Because nobody likes a whistleblower
Self inflicted? BS
WHISTLEBLOWERS are SMART but ALSO Stupid. Why? THEY Whistleblow then are FOUND DEAD, like: Vince Foster Gary Webb Col. Sabow.  Whistleblowers MUST Tell EVERYONE They KNOW that THEY are NOT Depressed...Not SUICIDAL.  They need to BUY a GoPro with a CLOUD ACCOUNT to RECORD as SOON AS Someone Approaches that They DON'T KNOW... and NOT GO ANYWHERE ALONE...Nor be ALONE at HOME.
Self-inflicted gunshot wound that is such bullshit the man is about to go to trial he's a whistleblower and we all know that there's ways that you can set up to make it look like a suicide see this is the shit that these companies get away with because Boeing is a military contract
Self inflicted my foot
The dude was about to air the dirty laundry, the corruption that not only would affect all of the faa, deep pockets,  gov oversight,  dod, etc.. they couldn't allow that to happen.   He would have destroyed and shown how usless the faa and oversight is, in one interview.
Makes you wonder if Boeing has ties to the #DeepLeft like Pfizer, etc.
let me guess....🤔
BS INSANITY. FFF boeing.
hhhmmm so he was 'Epsteined' .. 🤨  I dont believe it 🤬
Trumps fault
So the Clinton's must have stock in Boeing
Weird huh
Jeffrey Epstein could not be reached for comment.
So Killary is now doing jobs for Boeing?
Did you notice that Boeing didn't have these problems until they left Washington?
Democrats  cough, cough
Suicided
They're not even trying at this point.
Bill and Hilary working for Boeing WTF
# boycottboeing
Haley was on BoeingBoard.
How convenient that’s what all call it what it is murder.
Do they think we’re stupid??
Someone Hillary Clintoned him
Ah! That is horrendous, it was not worth killing someone over! What a disgusting company.
🤔🤔🤔  🥸
He got Clintoned.. I won't fly boing ever.
Oh darn, another whistle-blower dies just before scheduled testimony.  Jeez, how do ya figure ?
Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DEI) policies. Hire incompetent people based on skin color, gender and sexual orientation.  I'd quit too if I was old school QC manager. Boeing is not the only company putting public safety at risk.  And suicide?  Yea right.
DEI isn't working out so good, eh Boeing?
Funny how it's always self inflicted.  Bull crap. They killed that man.
Wow
Corruption in government and corporations. This dude should of had federal protection .
Why hire the expensive hit-man? Boeing could’ve easily just made him take a flight on one of their jets!
Whoaaaaa.
Capitalism.🙄
This courageous man was murdered for what he knew and he was tenacious in reporting what he knew. Boeing wacked him. I will never believe he committed suicide. He was a thorn in Boeings side and he told the truth. No good deed goes unpunished!
BOEING 🤥🤥🤥 R.I.P. 🥀💔💝
BS ! This man did not kill himself
It's like you're in Russia and Putin and the KGB dealth with him.   Because the west is different 😮.   Nope, the west is worse than Russia and we just lie to ourselves.
THIS WAS NOT A COINCIDENCE.
How convenient for Boeing
When stock prices and money out weigh safety for every dingle airplane flying out there, it's time to stop. The reports on lack of safety protocols and  lack of a strict adherence to safety standards is frightening.  I hope Boeing is sued and individuals held accountable .
So he has a guts to be a whistleblower, hire an attorney and sue one of the largest aerospace/defense companies on the planet..then suddenly commits suicide.  Umm, ok. The DOJ isn't conducting a criminal investigation for ignoring employee safety concerns. There has to be something else.
Wow ..how convenient for Boeing....like Bertha Champagne, Beverly Eckert, Barry Jennings, Karen Silkwood...
Self inflicted my ass
I bet they are sorry
Sounds like the company I just retired from!  (C**br*** Exams)
Murdered!
Epsteined
Don’t believe he died by his own hand
Boeing whacked this dude to keep him from exposing how their obsession with DEI has ruined basic safety of their planes. All foreign commercial jet buyers should go elsewhere to buy planes bc Boeing is so concerned with protecting incompetence that it's Epsteining people.
Yell their sorry they probably had him killed so he couldn't take to court.
Who knows. The guy was divorced and maybe he was just sad. Also...  who cares?
Im driving
Camera, where are the camera films? Every hotel has them, where is the films?
Right self inflicted gunshot wound.!?  Who do you think your fooling....
WOW! PEOPLE CAN'T VOICE THEIR CONCERNS.
Strangely, he kills himself after letting the cat out of the bag. Really?
...can it be anymore obvious!?
Right they off that guy
Wow, I hope they know THIS WAS MURDER!!!
Our World is crumbling down
Hmmm. Rather suspicious...
Oh come on! How blantent can tou get!
he was Clintonized
Was Hillary nearby?
Epsteined!!
This man does not look confused or depressed!
A little fish trying to fight with huge whale? RIP🙏😢
Sounds like the Clinton’s are back in business
Bullshit - he did not kill himself!
He did not kill himself. See, how evil our government is. We have got to get the Democrats out!
I find this a bit incredulous
And besides the criminal investigation of the blowout from the Alaskan Airlines flight there also needs to be criminal charges against Boeing for the body of John Barnett, because we all know that was not a suicide. . . .
Murder by faulty planes, murder by help inflicted GS wound. Just another day for Boeing. They'll continue their abhorrent behavior.  I'm sure his family is THRILLED they're in Boeings' thoughts...
He was Clintoned
If only Boeing was as efficient at make safe planes as they are at murdering people whistleblowing their inefficiencies at making safe planes.
Whistle-blowers (real) are being exiled, arrested, or Arkancided.
Wow a self-inflicted gunshot wound is that something like falling out of a window in russia? I have no doubt that Boeing killed this man so he would not tell any of their dirty  secrets
Wow
I've worked with former employees that were let go and guess what...there was a good reason they were fired.  Two sides peopke.
Hillary Clinton must have stock on Boeing. I hope all involved are brought to justice.
They had him killed
You’re not fooling anybody Boeing .   His blood is on your hands.
Occam's razor - I think that he was murdered and made to look like a suicide.  Question no. 1 - Did he leave a note?  If a note was found, was it proven to be his writing,  etc.?
This is clearly a murder……is there no justice?
Imagine that😡
Very suspicious. This needs to have forensic experts called in to investigate.
Any ties to the clintons? Asking for a friend😏
Was he assisted by a professional?
Sad. But at the airplane plane it's.... GOING, GOING, GONE!
Suicide? Right. Big pharma did the same thing to a string of wholistic doctors, making it look like suicide over a decade ago. My own doc was one of them.
Gee wonder what happened. The truth was going to come out.
Holy shit... what other brands of planes are there to choose from???
Well nothing suspicious here?!!!
Gotta love the conservative Republican conspiracy theorists on here, ignoring the fact that THEIR party of choice works to DEREGULATE  such industries. 🤣🤷🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
The family/attorney needs their own autopsy.  And their own investigation.  You can hire outside the medical examiners office.  Do not trust them.  So many cover ups.  "What is right is wrong and what is wrong is right"   We are living it ~
#Murdered
If it’s a Boeing, I ain’t going 😳✈️
So sad for his family!🙏😥🙏😥🙏
Charlston ,SC is where the Boeing plant is ,what a coincidence
The inspections should have done many years ago. I've seen it also in the Everett plant
Redrum
No more blessings for u.
Our thoughts are with his family and friends? Y'all be safe!
I'll bet Boeing is really torn up about this.
May God have mercy😢 on his soul and whomever was involved in this death
"... our thoughts are with his family and friends."  Dear God, they're next.
This is disgusting. Obviously suicided.
This is a fascist murder, the coordination of powerful business, media and government bureaucracy, to control the people through any means. Pure evil.
Killiary did it.
I don't believe for one second that he died from a self inflicted gun shot wound! I hope they find the one or one's that inflicted that wound.😔🙏
Well, Boeing better get they’re  quality back on track. Stock will fly away like the doors on their aircraft
Rip John. Thank you for speaking out.
You know that wasn't suicide 😡😡😡😡
That look on his face says all you need to see!!!
That whistle blower was probably killed
Just like Epstein committed suicide...............
They killed him
Clintonized
They killed him.      Big companies. Hire ex military for security. And they will kill on given orders
Clintonized by Boeing
They will answer for this.
Little sus he supposedly shot himself while suing Boeing.  I think that death needs to be re-investigated.
Just like all jobs today! Only care about numbers and production, F#cK safety! SMH
Someone knows what happened.We pray that person cannot sleep from this day and will confess
He was murdered......come on people
Probably suicided!
poor man.
GOD BLESS JOHN & HIS FAMILY. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
At least Boeing got an A+ rating for Diversity.
So was pegigie hughes Hill
He got the Seth Rich treatment.......damm shame!
Oh really ray johndon said he was in south Carolina
This really stinks
He was Akansaded!
He was ark an cided
Pete Bootiejudge -   Hillary, We have a problem with a certain employee.  Hillary Clinton -  You leave him to me, Pete.
Seriously, what whistleblower kills themselves unless  encouraged to do so?               Sounds a wee bit 🐠 y
REDRUM
😮😢😢😢😢😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
That self-inficted gun shot was helped by a 2nd person guaranteed !
🙏🏾
Let me guess he was wearing a bulletproof vest but he shot himself in the head?
how convenient for Boeing...
Holly Mackerel , our justice system won’t do any investigation.
Wonder what he had on Hillary???
Murder
Where are we living russia?  Hold boeing accountable for his murder.
Epsteined. We live in a third world banana republic.
Who old him
This is so creepy. Look how many people the Clintons have unalived
Follow the blood trail , right up to the front door of the J Edgar Hoover building ! Corrupt AF !!!
I cannot be certain how this truthful, courageous man actually died. I do know that Multi-National Corporation use Professional Assassins. Faking a Suicide is a common strategy. Also, airplane crashes, both private and commercial planes sabotaged. Did this man have issues with depression? Had he ever attempted Suicide. I seriously doubt it.
If the world knew what he knew you'd never get on a motherfuking airplane again
Yeah, it's obvious who murdered him
There will be an investigation. Boing will say we had nothing to do with it. The government will say good enough for me. Business as usual
Seth Rich could not be reached for comment.
they killed him
The blatant criminality of american corporations is beyond belief
Be that wasn't a set up! NOT
🤔
Finding the guilt of the people responsible will be like investigating the Russian Mafia.
Dead men don't talk.
Murd&red
They whacked him. Sure he had more to tell. Or they making a statement.
The unequivocal transparency of this administration and followers is not as astounding as the fact that they thinking that they're hiding it from their 'enemy.'
Clintons
self inflicted my ass!
The Clinton/CIA suicide hit squad strikes again.
Hillarcided.
Yup. Just like the Clintons whistle blowers that shot themselves in the back of the head TWICE.
JesusChrist.and they critized Putin.
Boeing took care of that real quick. lol
This guy was murdered and nobody can do anything about it.
Murder.
🙏
Very suspicious that a whistleblower killed himself.  Has the coroner been bribed by Boeing to assist in a coverup?
"self" inflicted????
