One of the best songs, just shows u that you do not have to cuss to make a good song
I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. (Luke 13:5 [KJV]) And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: (Hebrews 9:27) Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. (Matthew 7:13-14) For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13)

See a perfect example of how the media portrays NLE and many other artists and athletes... Ive never seen one report or article about any of the amazing things he does for his community and others outside of his community.... But let him/them make a mistake or do something "bad" and its blown up across every station, YouTube channel etc. Keep it up Choppa.. Long live the 👑.RIP Von.

Bro u already know what I think!!! I messaged you and commented on this Masterpiece of a song the same time this Video was 1st released. But you never messaged back or atleast responded back to my paragraph long review that I left that I thought was one of the most positive comments you received so far. This song was such an inspiration to me and everyone I know that has listened this! So I hope you read this and also review the last comment I left you way back when I knew it was going to be one of my all time favorite songs I’ve ever heard! It has soo much meaning in every single verse from start to finish! Thanks bro! I really appreciate you!!! Your soo awesome bro!!!❤❤❤

I found this song on MLB The Show 23
I'm SO tired of people saying that NLE Choppa is gay. He is not! He's bisexual. I went to one of his shows in Maryland and afterwards he invited me on his bus. He let me go down on him but he was getting with girls too. I asked if he eould return the favor and he laughed and had me get off the bus about 15 minutes later. I still think he's a cool guy.

Why this music not getting the amount of views it deserves, you got to be kidding me.
Hats off to the director and nle

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful
i promise to everyone Nle going farrrrrr fr fr stop underestimating this man
I fw nle hard I love everything about this song but I feel like no one would have the same attention  if they didn't know his evolution as a writter and artist. And that's why I love/hate the music industry. Get the attention with emotional aggressive or sad music then make deep songs with more lyrical structure and meaning.
Because a mother should never have to bury her child the child should Barry their superior peers blessings to you Gawdd💯🏊‍♂️
Yo this is Dominic NLE bro I’m not trynna be that guy but why you have Kobe and Nip then your on the left Kobe is in his jersey and nips in his fit from the music video with roddy rich and then your on the right not looking with a muffled face kinda of brav and y’all bop in feel it but don’t wish for death so soon you thrown subliminals like  Beyoncé nem
Best song in the whole entire world

I was bout cuss yo out for not having my girl flaujae but nvm 😂🔥🫶🏼🙌🏽
slayyyyyyy
THIS IS HUGE. NLE changing the game forever
2023 IS NLE CHAPPA`S YEAR
Youngest to ever do it ❌🧢
Fire
I hate to hate on a positive message from NLE Choppa (God knows he's trying to secure the bag), but he capped with most of the cameos. Most of them don't even look like they know him, and the song is 5/10 at best. I get what he was trying to do, but it's hard to do when you lack lyrical capabilities. If he not rapping about violence, sex, drugs, and alcohol, he's trash.  I'd love to see him take a summer off and evolve into conscious, but he too superficial to do that.
Respect. I STAMP THAT positive motive.  💯..   Now lead me to the Hood shiiishhhh!?!?
Rip kingvon lil Tim I got you
Positivity overdose keep balling champ

No words, omg
Fiiiiiiiierrrrrrrr ✨❤️‍🔥✨🔥✨❤️‍🔥✨🔥✨❤️‍🔥✨🔥✨❤️‍🔥
Put Your $Money$ were your mouth is. I had to stop this video@0:53 because of that I will never loose line or whatever.  There is no chance you or any of you new young bucks can beat me in a free throw contest tell the new kid, "Anthony Edward?" I said that. I saw him play like one game & I was like wow this might be the one we need. Than he got hurt and sat on the sidelines wearing some kind of shirt saying he is the best or something & he never played good after that. That kid has so much potential & so do you.  I didn't have someone come to my rescue when they came for me in the fall when I was 15 in the middle of the night on a basketball court that isn't there anymore.  I became disabled when I was 15 & am now legal blind, "don't be said I get to smoke weed everyday now because of that."  You probably pretty much know more people that want to buy.  But I would almost guarantee I know more growers.  Do you want to play basketball on a pirate ship for marijuana?    I am just the guy that could make that most likely happen for you if you want.
Have a blessed day and know that Jesus loves you
Can we appreciate the fact that NLE has not made a bad song yet ?

I don't know if anybody wants to hear this but I'll say it to everyone reading.. Don't stop grinding and hustling until you feel fulfilled, it's not all about been on top, the highest thing is just to feel fulfilled as you. Love yourselves and believe in yourselves because that's what will fuel your energy each time you feel like giving up. I don't have so many subscribers but the ones I have are so special to my struggle so far. I'm grateful they believe in me, they're the reason i will keep putting in my best ♥️♥️♥️

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 2 Timothy 3:1-17 Jesus said to His disciples, You should know this, that in the last days there will be very difficult times. For people will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient to their parents, and ungrateful.Lovers of self and flesh for greed and haters of good that's pleasing to God's eyes.
W
yo choppa i met you in jerusalem u told me I was gonna be in your next vid..... believe in u legend
That is my Vibe
Proud of your transcendence neterkare 🖤🤍🦅 Asé
I’m your biggest fan I wanna meet you one day but you did good on this video
📖 Matthew 6:1-13 Jesus said:  Jesus said to His disciples: "Don't do your good deeds publicly, to be admired by others, for you will lose the reward from your Father in heaven. When you give to someone in need, don't do as the hypocrites do—blowing trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of charity! But rather in secret not for the entire world to see. 💯♨️💯♨️

Hello from România 🩷🌴
Wow, NLE Choppa never fails to deliver fire tracks! His new song is an absolute banger. The beats hit hard, and his flow is so infectious. It's impressive how he effortlessly switches between clever wordplay and powerful lyrics, making every line impactful. NLE Choppa's energy is unmatched, and this song is proof of his incredible talent. Can't wait to see what else he has in store for us. Keep grinding, NLE Choppa, you're definitely taking the hip-hop game to new heights!
